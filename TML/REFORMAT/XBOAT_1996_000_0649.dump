I would be very interested in the details of how you run a
Traveller PBEM (Play by E-Mail?) game.  I have many of the original
books from the game but scant opportunity to play.  Could you help?

There are tons of Play By E-Mail games running.  Some are on the
internet, some are on networks (like Fidonet, Tagnet or VNet),
and some are run on local BBS\'s.  If you are in an area where
there aren\'t too many opportunities to play live or you\'re on a
strange work schedule like me they can be great.

I\'m involved in several pbem games, and I can say three things
about them:

1. They *eat* your time! <g>;
2. They are lot\'s of fun;
3. They demand tons of patience.

To find more info on playing games by email drop by
http://www.pbem.com/pbem-page.html sometime.  That\'s PBEM.Com\'s
front page on the web.  They have lots of info on email games.
They will advertise your game, even set you up with a mailing
list if you ask.  They only charge a fee for games that charge
fees, IOW free game/no fee, paid game/you pay a fee.  I think
that\'s extremely fair!

If you have access to a VNet or Fido BBS, you can check the echos
there for information.  Fido has 3 very active rpg echos STARTREK
and STARTREK_RPG for Startrek based games, and SF&ANIMI_RPG for
all other science fiction rpgs.

The Trav-based ST game I\'m running is on the net..private email.
It\'s set about 40 years before the original series, just after
the Feds run into the Klingons.  The players are the Officers
aboard a scout ship sent to gather intelligence in an unexplored
sector that *might* be Klingon infested.  The ship\'s just about
to leave Starbase 6 and sail into the unknown.  It\'s been at that
point for over a month...here\'s where patience comes in
<g>...waiting for all the players to send in their moves and
such.  We\'ll do 2 - 3 turns a month once we get going.  I\'ve been
in email games that do 2-3 a week, but that will burn your
players (and GM) out if you keep it up for too long.

I\'m GMing a Twilight 2000 game on VNet. That one is averaging 2
to 3 turns a month.  That\'s about right for a fido-style network,
I think.

The Traveller game I\'m getting ready to run will be on fidonet in
the SF&ANIME_RPG echo...if I get permission from the moderator
that is.  <g> The players will be merchants/explorers/spies
working the frontiers (and beyond) of a pocket empire.  There
will be several other multi-system powers in the area to compete
with, as well as independent systems, pirates, and huge
unexplored areas.  A good bit of the characters\' business will be
commissions from their government to do undercover work.

Now, how do you do it?

1.  Find a game and play.

Check the newsgroups, pbem.com, this echo, fido/vnet/tagnet,
aol/cserve.  Find a game that looks interesting and ask the GM
(or moderator) if you can play.  If you *like* playing by mail,
then you might like GMing by mail.

2.  Prepare a game.

It seems to work best to keep everything as simple as possible.
Don\'t expect everyone to have a copy of the rules, so simplify
them and prepare posts to send out on how things work.  I hide
the rules as much as possible from the players.  I roll the dice
,usually, (when I want the players to participate in the rolls I
tell them to give me several numbers picked at random between x
and y, then I modify their "rolls" with rolls of my own),
generally I let the players concentrate on role-playing (as
opposed to roll-playing <g>).  Beyond that, do the stuff you\'d do
for a face-to-face game.

3.  Find some players.

Get on the fido style echos and lurk.  Decide who you\'d like to
invite to play in your game, and invite them.  It helps if they
know something about *you* before you invite them, so you
probably should do more than lurk, try you hand at playing.  Put
messages into a mailing list (like this one), in an appropriate
newsgroup (rec.games.frp.misc), and/or on www pages.

3.  Create some characters.

I tend to send out simplified forms with choices for the players.
They make choices, rank order lists of things from most important
for their character to least important, what skills they are best
at/worst at, things like that.  Sometimes all I get is a
narrative description of their character.  Then I roll their
characters up, describe the character to them in a post, and we
negotiate from there.  <g> I seldom give the player their stats
only in raw numbers, many of them don\'t have any idea what a 8 in
STR means.  <g> What I do is describe them.."You have above
average strength, superior intelligence, and extraordinary
dexterity."... and so on.

4.  Run the game.

I post a description of what\'s going on to a player.  They write
back with what they want to *try* to do.  If several players are
together they get one post (and maybe private ones too <g>), they
can exchange posts discussing what to do and then reply with
their move, and/or tell me what they try to do individually.  I
read their posts, organize them based on initiative, do any
rolling I need to do, and send them responses.  Sort of like what
we do in a face to face game, right?  <g> It just goes *much*
slower!

BTW, I\'ve found that when you get to bang-bang situations (combat
for example) you have to give the players *reasonable* deadlines
and stick to them.  If a player doesn\'t get his/her turn in then
the GM will NPC their actions.  Tell the players you\'re going to
do it up front, and give them the benefit of all doubts when you
do, but do it.  It keeps the game moving and nobody feels totally
left out.  I also make them give me *timed* moves (what do you
try to do during the next 5 seconds, or 10 seconds, or few
minutes depending on the situation) for actions where time is a
real factor..again combat is a good example, but so is picking a
lock before the guard gets back or locking onto the correct exit
point before the jump field collapses.

In the first pbem game I ran, I had one player whose mail *always*
arrived a couple of days after everyone else.  I wasn\'t using
*reasonable* deadlines yet, and I\'d respond to the other players
moves before my late player got his move in..so his move was
always getting stomped on.  It upset him..and me too!  I know
it\'s frustrating for players with fast mail to have to wait for
the players with slow mail, but again that\'s where patience comes
in. <g>

5.  Post regular Update Messages.

I learned this trick from Aron Head.  Every week post a
standardized information post to all the players.  Include in it
things like:  a roster of players, characters and addresses;
what everybody\'s character has been up to; what you expect
to be happening in the game during the next week; any news
about deadlines, changes of addresses, new players, etc.  Doing
this keeps the players up to date and involved even when they
haven\'t been doing much individually, so they don\'t all drift
away.  This is also where I warn players that they are in danger
of begin dropped from the game.

6.  Don\'t expect it to run forever or be problem free.

People move, get married, graduate, lose access, and just plain
drop out. Expect it, roll with it, and be prepared to bring new
people in. If you take on a player that\'s bringing it down for everybody
else..or that *you* can\'t stand..drop them.  It\'s tough, but do
it.  And, if it stops being fun for you, bring the scenario to
an end, and end the game.  You can always work up something else
and, armed with your experience, try again.

7.  Finally..just have fun! <g>

        I have a niffty little Windows program that I have written myself--
 still in the beta-stages really -- that generate UWP descriptions based on
 the "Classic" rules.  It does not incorporate any of the Scout manual,
 though.
        It allows you to "cap" population, starport and tech-level.  It will
 allow you to auto-generate names, and complete text descriptions of the
 world.  You can both print and save to database for use with another app I
 am writing (editor / maintainer--  allow you to "age" entire database to
 increase population, shift atmosphere\'s towards "tainted" and adjust TL\'s,
 as well as "hand-edit" planets).  It will create individual planets, or
 "batch" creates of up to 32,000 planets at a time.
        It is intended for shareware release sometime this year, but if you
 like I can make you my first beta-tester =).

        The biggest issue was cultural interaction, which was limited by ease
 of contact.  If the Europeans had not been sufficently motivated to emabrk
 on the Crusades, the hardships involved in making contact would have
 continued to allow uneven technology growth.  However, once the gap had been
 bridged, then trade allowed ideas to flow both ways.

        Same problem in the Imperium.  Until two neighbouring cultures/ worlds
 have a reason to regularly bridge the gap between them, they can be vastly
 different in TL and conceptualization of tech.

        I am running a TL10 game with Earth as the centre of Terran Sphere.
 There are two other spacefaring cultures within about 200ly of Earth, and
 all three are blissfully unawares of each other, simply because of scale
 distance involved.  When they finally *do* bump into each other, it will be
 *decades* before enough interchange has occured for one side to influence
 the TL of the other.

        In my humble opinion, anyway.

>What is harder to explain is how the Imperium has lagged at TL15 for so long,

I think you\'ll find that the real reason is  *player* reason rather than one
that was deliberately thought out for the *characters* and the game\'s background
history:

1. Regina was the first published sector. As such, it was on the border, and had
few high-tech worlds. Regina (the capital) was only TL 10, and the highest was
TL 13 (Pixie). For a character to acquire a TL 15 item was like a fantasy PC
finding a magic item - "wow, just look at this u-beaut thingy!"

2. When the Marches was published, GDW decided that TL 13 was "average Imperial
tech level" - it was the TL 15 planets that were anomalies. Just like that TL 17
world in the Regency, they couldn\'t advance any further - "who wants to buy
a high-tech gadget if you have to travel back 2 subsectors to fix it when it
breaks?"

3. When the Atlas of the Imperium was published, along with all that Library
Data (A-M, N-Z), the reason for the Imperial stagnation at TL 15 was never
really explained in terms of the background. "I mean, gee, the Imperium is at a
higher TL than all of surrounding space - what more do you want?"

4. The "game balance" POV - an example of *player* reasons - is to prevent PC\'s
from winding up with TL 21 Wave Motion Guns when even the Impi Navy only had
what was available at TL 15. This has not prevented one of my players from
desperately wanting a set of TL 17 mimetic battle dress, of course - it just
means that acquiring such an item means much searching, travelling, NPC
interaction - in short, ADVENTURING!! (which is what it is all about).

>Are there any adventures published that are set in the 5FW?

Offhand:

1. The _Spinward Marches Campaign_ contains a 5FW adventure, as well as details
of how the GDW version of the war panned out.

2. Early _Journals of the Travellers Aid Society_ (from issue #9, "War!"
onwards!) have a few scenarios set in or near the 5FW:
- "A Dagger At Efate" (#8?), just prior to the war;
- "77th Patron", where an Imp spy hands the Zho war plans to the PC\'s, prior
to the war;
- "Soft Bunk, or What To Do When The Zho\'s Invade";
- one set on Quar or Ruby or something, where an Imp archealogical team are
captured when the Zho\'s invade;
- two articles giving breakdowns on Zho and Impy troop organisations;
- a scenario involving the invasion of Vilis or Garda-Vilis (probably more to
do with the Sword Worlds than the Zho\'s (maybe this _is_ "Soft Bunk"??!);
- Striker II contains a scenario on Efate, during the height of the 5FW battle
for the world;
..um, I don\'t have my article list here, does anyone have any more?

3. _Adventure ?: Broadsword_ contained some scenarios involving Zhos during
the 5FW, especially on Garda-Vilis;

4. Alien Races (title?) had a post-5FW scenario where the PC\'s had to convince
some Zho\'s that the war was over (very Japanese-soldier-on-Pacific-island sort
of stuff).

Well, that\'s all I can think of so far. ;-)

Actually, technological advancement in the Imperium has been roughly one TL
per 300 years (_very_ roughly). Except for the TL 16 to TL 17 jump of the
last 80 years.

It\'s one of those reverse game reasons. _If_ technological developement in
the game progressed like it does in real life then Refs wouldn\'t be able
to envisage the society and players wouldn\'t be able to relate to it
(except for a few gifted individuals who would be too busy writing hugely
succesful SF books). Hence society has to resemble the one we know to some
degree. A plasma handgun may be higher tech than we have today, but it\'s
still basically a gun. you point it and pull the trigger. A "nanocyte
assault weapon" that seek out the target and tries to penetrate his nano-
cyte shield is a bit too weird for me to relate to ("Let\'s see. Your NAW
is TL 54 and his NAS is TL 53. Right. You kill him!") Let alone the gun
that will really exist exist in the year 5600 which I can\'t even begin to
imagine.

So obviously there are some fiendishly difficult research barrierers to
further tech developement waiting just ahead of present-day Terran TL.


Stefan Matthias Aust wrote some very interesting things about tech levels.
However, for Traveller purposes he makes the same mistake that GDW made of
linking TLs to specific time periods in the history of one single planet.
That some things appeared at a particular point in Earth history is simply
a matter of historical chance. Some things could have appeared much earlier
or much later.

My favourite example is the medical technology of surgery. All you really
need to make surgery work is a sharp knife _and the knowledge to keep the
wound sterile_. On Earth germs weren\'t discovered until the microscope, a
TL 4 device, was invented. Hence GDW and Matthias classifies surgery as a
level 4 technology. But if you knew about germs - if someone from another
planet had told you (or if some stone age genius had deduced the way germs
_work_ even if he didn\'t have a clue why it worked that way) - all you
really needed would be a knife and boiling water. Hence _I_ classify
surgery as a level 1 technology.

The mixup comes from confusing discovery TLs and implementation TLs. I
remember a piece I saw on TV where a scientist from our Atomic Research
Station told of a new discovery they had made a couple of years ago (TL 8,
right?) He mentioned that this _could_ have been implemented with the
technology they had had when they started in the 1930ties, only, of course,
they hadn\'t known about it then. So is that TL 8 or TL 6? IMO it\'s TL 6.

All you need for mathematics is a stick and some dirt. (Hides and charcoal

What\'s the difference between human muscles and slave muscles?

Horses can\'t be used at TL 0?

Writing is another one of those crafts that only need a stick and dirt (Or
stone and chisel or wood and knife or...)

>Weapon Tech: Bronze and iron weapons, siege engines.
>Medical Science: Primitive knowledge of body.

In the Traveller universe you can have a copy of Grey\'s anatomy (donated
by an off-worlder) and still be TL 0. Come to that, if some stone age
genius was motivated to acquire a sound knowledge of anatomy then he
could easily do it with only an obsidian knife (And a steady supply of
bodies, of course, but there are no shortage of that at any TL).

Archs were used by the Romans, optical laws, spectacles and mirrors only

highly complex devices that need fine metalworking. Is fine metalworking
a higher TL than ordinary metalworking? I\'m inclined to say so, but I can\'t

Somewhere in there you\'ve missed one of the most significant discoveries:
The horse collar. That made a horse more effective than human beings for

The Third Imperium was advancing fairly rapidly, up to MegaTraveller, and
the rate of progress was accelerating.  The Terran Confederation had
achieved tech-12 by the Ninth Interstellar War, but the problems of the
Rule of Man trying to prop up the collapsing Vilani society stopped any
further advancement in Imperial Space until after the Long Night.  The
Sylean Federation had tech-12 at the founding of the Imperium, and things
took off after that.  The Imperium was considered tech-13 by 300, and the
xboat system was nearly state-of-the-art when construction began.  It
had tech-14 by 700, and tech-15 by 1000.  Considering all the tech-16
worlds popping up in the Core, tech-16 by 1250 or so might have been
reasonable -- before the Second Civil War.

Actually, this is still statistically true for the majority of the Imperial
population, pre-Collapse.  Averaging tech level of worlds, weighted by the
world population, you get about tech 12-13.  Some sectors are more or less
advanced than others.  I suppose you could say that there\'s an "average"
Imperial tech-level and a higher number that is the maximum commonly in use.

Exactly what I am contemplating.  Does anyone have any such adventures?
Also, does anyone have a timeline, by exact date, of the events of that
war?  My group is in the Spinward Marches and it would be interesting
to track the progress of the various military forces so that I can see
if the "front" is ever where my characters are.

I think it is a real mistake to assume that because components of a thing
exist at a certain tech level, products that require a combination of those
same things should be available at that same level.

e.g.

>>Communication: Writing, signal fire.
>
>Writing is another one of those crafts that only need a stick and dirt (Or
>stone and chisel or wood and knife or...)

Sticks, dirt are available at any tech level.  However, writing, requires
someone to have an interest in preserving knowledge past tomorrow and
coming up with a writing convention.  This argues for writing to be available
in an age where the inmediate concern is not simply surviving past today.
You could make an argument for pictographs to be accepted as writing,
a need to express oneself and using materials at hand (variously colored
dirts, chalks, soot and naturally occuring cavewalls).  Writing also seems
to argue the necessity  of a society that is larger than the single family unit
or the clan that one belongs to.  In other words, if what you are defining
as writing that of a set vocabulary, with specific symbols that represent those
concepts then you must have a society that shares those symbols as a
necessary condition for writing to occur.

This does not happen at TL 0.

The same with surgery.  The argument that surgery could occur as soon as
sentients can wield a knife is a simplistic one.  One can open a body up with
something as crude as a rock, a sharpened stick or something as advanced
as a chainsaw.  The point is that the person doing the cutting has to have
developed the idea that cutting into the sentient under the saw will produce
the effect of curing the patient.  For that to happen, a good deal of time and
advances have been made between the time they first cut into each other,
the original purpose being to kill...

>>Transporation: Horses with saddle and stirrups, ships.
>
>Stirrups needs metal-working - TL 1.

They also need some understanding of tanning, horse training and the abilty
to put the three together...

Tech levels are s synergistic event.  To say that the only thing that is needed
is the essential building blocks for the subcomponents is, IMHO, a flawed
argument.

We understand in a theoretical manner what superconductors can do for us,
we have the materials knowledge somewhere to put them together, we know
about transmission of power and the essentials of physics to make it happen,
but we have not because we have not hit on the right combination.  That might
take something else htat helps us bring the entire package together.

This topic has sparked some great contributions. Recent comments seem to
prove pretty convincingly that the Imperium has never been stagnating -- looks
like it\'s my ignorance of tech level changes that is at fault.

With the information folks have provided, I now have a much better picture of
the Imperium\'s historical growth.

Hans makes some great points about problems with the concept of tech level,
The distinction between implementation TL and discovery TL is a good one.

Another way to improve a TL description of a world would be to list different
levels for different areas of technology-- Medical TL 10, Military TL 13, and
Transportation TL 11, for example. Or you could write anywhere from a
paragraph to a page describing the technologies available to a culture. If you
use the TL concept, it\'s got to be recognized as a shortcut.

Another thing to approach here that might be more relevant would be
economics. Given that it is pretty expensive to move about in Traveller,
(although much cheaper than any real method of interstellar travel we can
currently extrapolate), I would think that local availablility of resources
would drive the availability of certain technologies more than knowledge.
Knowledge would be the cheapest thing to transport.

Actually, it\'s hard to understand how interstellar trade makes much sense.
Much of the CT material has things like wine and exotic meats being traded
around (I\'m specifically thinking of The Traveller Adventure) and that doesn\'t
make much sense to me. However, in play I don\'t think I\'d much want to call
that into question. If anyone wants to rattle off a justification for this,
I\'d be interested to read it. I think a universe in which few goods but lots
of info are moved around makes more sense as an actual extrapolation of our
present, but when it comes to a game milieu, I\'d hate to give up Free Traders
and the adventuring opportunities they provide.

I\'ve thought for *decades* that a very useful project would be sitting
down and trying to produce a set of "books" detailing how to go from
"nothing" (ie you and the books) to any desired piece of contemporary
technology. A side benifit of such would be that you could classify
tech levels in terms of how many stages of "tools to build the tools to
build the tools..." you have to go thru.

And history bears you out. There is ample evidence of surgery of *some*
sorts being done with limited success even by neolithic peoples.
Trephanation, for example (cutting a hole in the skull to release
spirits).

But the *idea* of even arithmetic has to be *invented*. It was a major
discovery that you could "count" things by using a pebble to represent
each item. So if you come back later and there are fewer items than
there are pebbles in your pouch, you know that someone took one.

This seems obvious to *us*, but it is a major invention. Numbers come
much later, as do things like addition and subtraction.

Egypt didn\'t really *have* an "empire" until quite late. They were

Babylon is several steps above "stone age".

I\'d make it at least TL 1, as it requires several "steps" up from
"naked savage". Even the *earlist* glass requires more than just fire
and sand. You need soda and lime too. Without those, you won\'t get the
sand to melt at any sort of reasonable temp. Limestone is easy. "soda"
is not found laying around. You either mine it in the few areas where
deposits occur, or you *make* it, starting with things like seaweed.

> >Transporation: Horses with saddle and stirrups, ships.
>
> Stirrups needs metal-working - TL 1.

First you need the idea of domesticating animals, then you need the
idea of a way to stay on better.

If you are trying to "uplift" natives, you *will* have to teach them
the ideas in that order.

> >Communication: Paper.

Paper is a pain, and one of the *requirements* is wire screens. That
means you need high grade metal (to make decent wires) and the ability
to draw wire somewhat reliably. Papyrus isn\'t too bad. Vellum requires
domesticated animals, and *good* tanning processes.

Nope. Porcelain is *qualitatively* different from pottery. And it

quality raw materials.

The *true* arch came to the Romans fairly late as I recall. Glass
suitable for *any* sort of optical use is several steps up from the
"mix sand, soda, and lime then heat well" type of glass. Metalworking
has *lots* of stages.

> Gunpowder itself is TL 0, of course, but cannon needs some good knowledge

Sorry, gunpowder requires some "chemical" processing. At the very least
it requires mixing containers that are *not* stone, and shouldn\'t be
pottery. (I could send you a file on how to make saltpeter, It requires
*boiling* large amounts of liquid for *extended* periods)

While it is true that there *are* a lot of things you could get a TL-0
savage to do for you, to get them to do them for *themselves* requires
a few steps. While Stefan may have been rather pessimistic, you are
*way* too optimistic.

Reading up on the history of science and technology can be *very*
eye-opening.

 Phillip McGregor suggested that the Vilani Empire would have been
better off after it was conquered due to the "untrammelled Terran
techno" advance.  This assumes that technological progress is good,
absolutely regardless of its effects.  The Vilani Empire wasn\'t
suffering from the control of technological development as such, but
the stagnation, and the perception that technological progress was
bad, regardless of its effects.  This is where the essential
difference between Solomani and Vilani thinking effects technology;
the former forges on, even when technology is damaging the environment
and needlesly killing people, while the latter holds back, even when
technology could save people\'s lives and increase their standard of
living.

In MT, it was suggested that the success of the Imperium was due in
part to a synthesis or symbiosis of the Vilani and Solomani heritage
in the empire.  The Solomani urge to make changes and "advance" was
balanced by the Vilani wish to stick to what was known and be "careful
of change".  I don\'t know if this a correct sociological analysis of
the Third Imperium, but it\'ll do.

The Imperium went from about TL 12 to TL 15 in about 1000 years; is
that really a slow progress (as some seem to think).  How long did it
take Europe to go from TL 0 to TL 4?  In the twentieth century, we
have probably advanced from TL 4 to TL 8(ish), but perhaps we are not
typical.  Trying to come up with a theory of technological development
rates for an 11,000 world empire (and all the surrounding worlds) from
the experiences of a single world in a single century is v dodgy!
Social and political effects are probably stronger than we think.
There was a good book called the something or other Rose (sorry, can\'t
remember the title or the author) which posulated a Europe which never
underwent technological advances due to various fundamental
sociopolitical events going different ways.  The Catholic Church
remained in its Inquisition phase (that is certainly an historical
bogusity on my part), and technolgy was severely circumscribed.  This
was perfectly plausible, and showed a possible way in which social and
political differences can effect technological development.

    'body' => 'Several people have been commenting on the Traveller tech rating system, and
some interesting comments have been made; however, I believe that the *real*
problem has been missed (or, perhaps, it\'s been done to death in previous
Xboat "issues"?)

What is the "real" problem? Well, there are several, and I\'m not going to go
into all, or into the ones I do in great detail, but --

1) Let\'s consider "Personal Military Technology", pp. 26-27, MTrav Referee\'s
Companion.

TL/5 (c. 1930) = bolt action rifle, explosive hand grenades in widespread use
TL/6 (c. 1950) = semiauto rifle supersedes BA rifle, carbine, SMG and auto
                 pistol achieve wide military use
TL/7 (c. 1970) = assault rifle becomes main military weapon; grenade launchers
                 appear
TL/8 (c. 1990) = AR remains main weapon, RAM grenades appear, laser carbine
                 appears
TL/9 (c. 2010) = Laser rifles appear
TL/10 (c. 2100) = Advanced Combat Rifle, firing RAM grenade, appears

Now, let us consider this. What is the difference between a BA Rifle (say the
Lee Enfield .303 or the Mauser KAR-98k) and a Semiauto Rifle (like, say, the
Garand or the Gewehr 43) and between them and an Assault Rifle (like, say,
the MP/43-44) and between them and a SMG (like, say, the MP-38 or PPsh-43 or
M-3)? Apart from the fact that *all* were used reasonably widely in WW2, some
interesting facts should be noted -

* BA Rifles are *more* expensive, and actually take *higher* technology to
produce than ARs and SMGs!!! They require expensive high-tech (for the time)
*machining* of parts - ARs such are usually made from stamped parts (and, note,
the MP-43/44 series is still around today ... as the AK-47/74!!!).

* SMGs are even *cheaper* to produce, and take even *less* technology than an
AR. Take the Sten, it was produced in bicycle workshops by the Brits, and in
backyard "factories" by the Maquis in occupied France.

What we havem of course, is *not* a description of *technology* but of
*invention chronology*. There is a vast, and important, difference. There
is, in fact, no reason why a TL/4 culture (say around the period of the US
Civil War) could not produce a Sten or an AK. The only requirement is that
it has achieved an industrial culture with the required machine tools. And,
yep, they had \'em at that time. What they did *not* have was anyone who
actually came up with the *idea* of a Sten or AK. So, in fact, TL/4-5-6-7-8
and even the mechanical components of TL/10 ACRs, are *really* TL/4 *AS FAR
AS TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO PRODUCE THEM IS CONCERNED*

Again, look at Energy (pg. 29) -

TL/4 (pre 1930) = Steam Engines
TL/5 (c. 1930) = Hydrocarbon fuel and Internal combustion engines

then

TL/9 (c. 2010) = Primitive Fusion Plants
TL/10 (c. 2100) = 2000 l. min Fusion Plants
TL/11 = 1000 l. minimum Fusion Plants
TL/12 = 250 l. minimum Fusion Plants
TL/13 = Fusion Output = 3kw per l.
TL/14 = 100 l. minimum Fusion Plants
TL/15 = Fusion Output = 6kw per l.
TL/16 = 80 liter minimum Fusion Plant

OK, why are Fusion Plants - obviously only capable of incremental improvement
from TL/9 to TL/16 treated as *eight* TLs, while External/Internal Combustion
engines are treated as only two. Surely there should be separate TLs, on the
basis of the treatment of Fusion Plants, for Savery Engines, Newcomen Engines,
Watt Engines, High Pressure Steam, Forced Draught Steam, Steam Turbines,
Early Petrol, Diesel, Wankel Rotary, Electronic Fuel Control, Ceramic Engines
and all the rest.

Nope, what it boils down to is the whole TL system is a crock. It always has
been and there is no way that it can be made to work (and, yes, I tried when
i co-wrote "Space Opera" many years ago), simply because it focuses on the
wrong things.

The only solution is to look at a planet\'s technological *capability* - if
they have machine tools, then they *can* make all those neat weapons from
BA Rifles through to ARs and ACRs (maybe not the electronics of the latter).
They may *not*, but that does *not* mean that they cannot!

It\'s like I suggested in an earlier post here (or was it to the Traveller
list?) - the whole system (and there are clues scattered throughout all the
pre-TNE stuff) is a deliberately artificial construct of the Imperial Govt
which wishes to keep technology from spreading. The main fear of a vilani
dominated Imperium (and the Vilani really won the Nth Interstellar War when
they manipulated Estigarribia into his treason! Again, the evidence is all
there!) is that technology will get out of control before society (and the
Emperor and Imperial Nobles who, of course, control it - oh, and don\'t
forget the Megacorps; either Vilani, or Terran ones that supported the traitor)
is "ready" to accpet it. In other words, they want to make damn sure that
hi-tech doesn\'t spread too fast because it might stunt their little protection
racket - which is all the Imperium is! The Imperium manipulates whole planets
and whole societies (as we know from their manipulation of Psionics), and, in
this case, they are manipulating them into thinking that quite simple progress-
ions in tech ability are somehow vastly difficult because they are a "new TL"!

Well, at least you can make a quite good case for all the above. And it
certainly does explain the rubbish that is the Traveller TL system!

I think your rebuttal is viable but misguided.  Statements like,
[paraphrasing] "it only takes a stick and dirt to write, TL 0,";  "stirrups
require metallurgy, TL1";  or "it only takes a copy of Gray\'s anatomy to be
given to someone...".  All of these type of statements violate a basic rule of
technological advancement, stepwise increase.  A common language and symbol
system must be agreed upon before a stick and dirt will suffice.  Metallurgy
(beyond copper which is too soft for stirrups), Animal husbandry/training (ie
"horse" riding), and an advanced concept of animal control (more than hopping
on an animal to get from A to B, ie saddle, bridle, etc) all of these items are
prerequisites to the stirrup concept.  One exception to this might be a culture
(such as the tribal Mongol hordes) might devlop these things sooner.  The
suggestion of any introduction of advanced tech level, Gray\'s Anatomy is at
least TL 5, is an automatic bias.  Any person in any previous time period who
has access to advanced TL would be considered that TL in that area.  In other
words, a TL0 society with one individual (or culture) possesing TL5 medicine.

It would seem that the TL system should be applied by type of science, but this
has two major flaws.  One is the interdependency of most sciences.  The other
being practicality of use within a game system.  Like any other FRPG, Traveller
requires players to suspend reality in some measure for the sake of game play
and enjoyment.  I frequently have to remind players of this fact (as I myself
am often reminded).  Traveller is designed to have a variegated universe to
keep every place from being the same.

Exactly what I am contemplating.  Does anyone have any such adventures?
Also, does anyone have a timeline, by exact date, of the events of that
war?  My group is in the Spinward Marches and it would be interesting
to track the progress of the various military forces so that I can see
if the "front" is ever where my characters are.

To both of these people I say.  The Spinward Marches Campaign.  It gives an
entire backdrop to the War including progressive maps explaining the wars
progress from 1105 ? until somewhere in 1107?.  I own this text and would be
willing to share it with others.  I am not sure of the legality of sharing text
that is currently out of print.  I would prefer to exchange info, but again I
am unsure of the legality of this.  There is a great deal of Classic traveller
info I am interested in (not the least of which is the list of out of date
stuff GDW still has in its warehouse, that someone mentioned a few weeks
back).  Is anyone out there willing to part with any of their old data ( I have
kept my collection for ten to fifteen years).

There\'s excellent historical precedent.  All over the ancient and medieval
world, traders tromped huge distances, undergoing great danger and effort,
to bring luxury goods from the elite of one area to another.  Don\'t know why,
exactly, but it seems a fundamental fact of human nature that when you get
rich, you simply *must* have that lovely vase/rug/wine/spice/whatever from
halfway across the world.  And when the exotic goods you can get are actually
from another _planet_ - so much the better!

I really would like to get more source material on trade, too.  An expanded
and more detailed list would be cool.  One idea:

pets - craze for particularly lovable animals from planet X could go to
       extremes - (possibly endangering the native population?)

Anybody want to start putting together an idea database for trade?

Well, defining TLs only based on describing available technology seemed more
difficult than referencing an example -- earth. Unfortunately, that\'s the
only example we (or at least I) know of. When using this example, we have to
assume, that developing technology isn\'t only a random invention process but
some technology is based on other technology and that there\'s a causal chain
of inventions.

Perhaps you could explain the earth-TL reference with the idea that TLs were
introduced during the Rule of Man and later adopted by the Imperium.

>or much later.

But they haven\'t. Technological advancements aren\'t independent of political
or social events. As I understand, sometimes the "time is ripe" for an
invention. Sometimes, nobody has the right idea. For what reason ever.
Perhaps there\'re other cheaper solutions. Perhaps free thought is forbidden.
Perhaps society is following the wrong ideas (earth is flate).

>[surgery is TL1 if you\'re told how to do it]

The turing maschine (a theoretical computer) could have been invented with
Greek mathematics. However, nobody did it. Probably, the Greeks could have
built primitive calculation maschines if somebody told them how.

>The mixup comes from confusing discovery TLs and implementation TLs.

Yes, a good point. I thought about this and decided to classify the TL based
on the time, when the technology was broadly used. on earth, steam power was
discovered about 50 AD, but nobody realized for what to use it. Time wasn\'t
ripe.

That\'s the point. I would classify this TL8 because at TL6 nobody did it. I
didn\'t want theoretical TLs but real (that is on-earth) TLs.

You\'re right. I would classify Egypt as TL1. But most of the remaining world

As I understand, they aren\'t used in a scientific manner but only random. So
I woudn\'t call this use "science."

All you need to invent the zero is copying the "O" and nevertheless it took
centuries to realize that a zero is needed and how to define it.
Mathematics is a science, not only counting.

Slave muscles don\'t work voluntarily :-) Okay, it\'s more a social than a

Well no. Ridding horses are used from about 2000 BC, Asimov\'s Chronology of
Science and Discovery says. That\'s TL1.

>>Communication: Writing, signal fire.

I\'ve to contradict. You\'ve to invent some symbols and define their meaning.
You have to learn this, to teach it and to establish this technology. And I
would call a symbol language only a writing if the symbols are abstract
entities and not concrete pictures.

>In the Traveller universe you can have a copy of Grey\'s anatomy (donated
>by an off-worlder) and still be TL 0.

I feel, you can\'t try to cover off-world contacts with TLs. With my
definition of TL, this off-worlder would raise the local TL to at least 1.

>>TL2 - Era of the Roman Empire (-400-500 TT)

>TL 0. And not even just in theory. Remember the Babylonian clay tablets.

To record the own history, you need writing, so I would say TL1. But I
realize, recorded history isn\'t a good sight for TL2. Discard it.

>Glass needs fire and sand - TL 0.

You need the idea to melt a special kind of sand and the idea what to do
with that hot liquid. But we\'re repeating our arguments.

>Didn\'t we have iron weapons and siege weapons on TL 1?

No heavy armored soldiers, no siege engines as the Romans built. Precursors
might have exists on TL1 but broadly use was at TL2.

>>TL3 - Dark Ages (500-1500 TT)

>I hesitate to tie religions to technology.

Well, it\'s a way to see the world which is a way how to invent.
But in generally, I would agree with you.

>Archs were used by the Romans.

That were only Roman archs (they couldn\'t bridge more than a few metres).
Here I meant Gothic and Renaissance archs as used when building churches.

Tell this our ancestors and ask them why no one who used a watermill
invented a windmill :-) Perhaps because slave power was cheaper?

Do you know, when on earth this device was invented?

Thank you for your comments. I would like to know, what kind of technology
you would classifiy as TL10-TL15 besides jump drives and weapons.

PS: Would you agree with me to classify computers as TL0? Logic gates are
TL0. The needed tubes to implement the gates are TL0 because glass and
copper wire are TL0. Vaccum is probably also TL0. Electricity is TL0 because
lightnings are older than humankind. Punch cards to supply input are easy, a
punch card writer (for output) shouldn\'t be that complicated. An extern
clock to operate the ALU built from tube-gates could be supplied manually.
So with some endurance and some help it should be possible? :-)

    'body' => '     I have been lurking around the Tech Levels discussion with considerable
     interest. A real-life (!) example of low-tech manufacturing can be seen in
     northern Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border. In the town of Dhurra, the
     main industry is producing handmade copies of firearms, using pretty
     rudimentary techniques eg machining rifle barrels from steel reinforcing
     rods and making other bits from metal scrap, wood and so on.

     Primitive weapons, I hear you say? Apparently, many of these copies are not
     only more reliable and accurate than the originals (AK-74s, automatic
     pistols, semiauto rifles, etc) but they also cost about a quarter as much.
     The only difference in appearance is that the copies have no serial
     numbers, manufacturers\' stamps and the like - although I\'m sure they could
     add these at a reasonable price!

     Your average Afghan or Kashmiri rebel can now get their hands on a great
     deal of sophisticated weaponry with little effort or technology at all -
     what is needed is weapons to be copied: something that the Third Imperium
     has no shortage of.

     Add to this the quantities of ex-Soviet, Czech and East German accessories
     floating about today (eg night vision gear, telescopic sights, laser sights
     - a nice little man in Smolensk tried to sell me all this stuff in early
     1994) and you have all the toys for a very interesting war.

     Could this be the situation in parts of the Third Imperium? Is this
     necessarily the case only with weapons? If people want something badly
     enough, they\'ll find a way to get it.

Subject:       GDW Closing Down

>From the Industry News topic in the GEnie Gaming Category:

GDW is closing down. One of the oldest companies in the industry, founded in
1973 as Game Designers\' Workshop, GDW has endured years of tough times. The
company, which now consists of Frank Chadwick and Susan Schug (comptroller
and print buyer), stops selling product January 19th and expects to be shut
down by the end of February.

GDW is NOT declaring bankruptcy, and will not be selling its products at
discounts. Schug says, "We\'ll do the best we can to take care of everybody
and find good homes for our games."

Of these games, the licensed JOHNNY REB has reverted to its owner, Joh
Hill, and HARPOON rights have reverted to Larry Bond. CLASH OF ARMS  will do
the next edition of the HARPOON game. There are inquiries about the
roleplaying lines, but nothing has been decided.

GDW founder Frank Chadwick will now work freelance, mostly in historical
games. Schug says he will probably remain in historical games he designed
after they go to other publishers.

Well, so much for the happy new year. (Did I mention the prison I worked at
had an escape yesterday? Now I have to dread tomorrow...)

The Spinward Marches Campaign adventure component is set after the 5FW,
with the PCs starting in the occupied Sword Worlds territory.  The part
which details the progress of the 5FW is a bit haphazard as the maps
appear to contradict the text in places (and I seem to remember that some
of the text contradicts itself).  Another source of information is the
TNS printed in JTAS, which detail the 5FW.  One of the JTAS had
"Traveller News Service Revisited" which recaps the news of the 5FW.
This also contradicts the text in The Spinward Marches Campaign (Imperial
propaganda?)  I think the 5FW game includes TNS items leading up to the
war; any chance I could get those from someone?

Ok, here goes. Very briefly, I think too often it is assumed that all worlds
have the facilities and climate to grow just about anything - animal or
vegetable. Clearly this is not the case. An awful lot of \'planets\' are
actually asteroids, sun-burned balls of rock or frozen balls of rock in
vacuum. Although hydroponics, etc. could make up for this to a degree, it
would be the mass foodstuffs that are produced, with no space for, say, fine
wine grapes or free range chickens! Using valuable heat, light, oxygen and
food for growing meat cattle, etc. is VERY expensive - remember that farmers
on Earth get most of that lot for free! Even if the grapes were squeezed in,
you\'d always have someone saying that the wine lacked \'terroir\' (I think
that\'s spelt right? - i.e. the actual ground, natural sun, etc. give each
growing region it\'s own particular taste).

Okay, so I think there\'s a clear justification for bulk imports of many
foodstuffs. On particularly barren planets even basics such as grain might
be needed.

Population. Another big point to consider. If you have only 10 or 100 people
on a world (some Traveller worlds are fairly sparsely populated) then they
won\'t be producing food if there is some other factor taking up their lives
e.g. the starport is rated A it probably means most of them work there, or
they have TL15, in which case most are perhaps research staff or a
corporation site producing a specific high-tech component. This leaves
little time to worry about producing food and certainly does not allow the
production of all the basic materials required to sustain any society above
(approx) TL3. All those minerals that need mining, ores to be smelted,
petrochemicals for plastics, semiconductors... and then all that lot has to
be made into the telephones, televisions, computers, cars, etc. that make
life as we know it. Just imagine the complexities required to sustain TL10,
13 or 15! Some planets might even have a scarcity of particular minerals and
ores, making the first step impossible.

All these factors lead to any world of less than about pop level 6-7 being
(typically) highly dependent on other worlds for a huge variety of raw
materials and processed goods.

Now, Traveller falls down in 2 respects here:

Firstly it never really mentions the sort of bulk (megatons) carriers
required to make it economic to transport all the low price/low profit goods
critical to a planet\'s subsistence.

Secondly, when you expand systems using Scouts, WBH or the like, you may
suddenly find a range of other planets in system, some of which are perhaps
more suitable for growing food, or which might have the ores the main planet
doesn\'t have, etc. etc. Given a fully populated system, you can reduce the
inter-system traffic and get more of the raw materials in-system, i.e. you
get quite a bit of in-system bulk carrier traffic as well - suddenly the
bulk carriers become a lot more profitable, or you can use sling-shots or
mass-drivers to propel goods through the system!

I think this philosophy might help to justify all the trade goods given in
the CT and MT rules. One might ask why very small traders (Far, Free or Sub.
Merchants) are given cargoes of a few tons of worked metal. Okay, don\'t
regard this as just any old sheet metal - this is the 98652-A-TY bracket
required for high-stress low-pressure welding seals: 5 tons is a lot of
brackets and the destination world only needs a few thousand... 5 tons of
raw ore? Well, that\'s more difficult to justify, but perhaps it\'s because
there\'s a samurai sword maker on the destination world who insists on
refining his own metals? 5 tons of electronics? Easy - Mk 235 \'Talkie\'
Toasters - no one makes these on the destination world because of the
interstellar patent coverage purchased by the EatLots Toaster company... or
perhaps the 5 tons is computer parts for your pop 5 destination world. That
world might be marked TL13 for all I care, but no world with only a few tens
of thousands of people on it (even given robot support) will be able to
support a complete computer-construction industry from sand to working
boxes... PLUS all the other food and basic stuff-of-life production. At TL14
or 15 maybe robotics really do allow much more automation, but at lower TLs
you will always require sentient supervision which ties up people...

The Spinward Marches Campaign describes the progress of the war from 1107 to
1110. It details the belligerents and it provides maps showing the war
\'fronts\' at six-month intervals throughout the war.

It also includes material drawn from \'Citizens of the Imperium\'. The
adventure included in The Spinward Marches Campaign actually takes place
immediately after the war (as is the adventure from \'Alien Realms\', which
was mentioned here).

More useful to you are the majority of Amber Zone articles in JTAS from
issue #9 (the war issue) to around issue #22 or #23.

The FFW boardgame is, of course, a must.

The outcome of the pre-war adventure \'Twilight\'s Peak\' may have a marked
effect on the Zhodani conduct of the war.

My advice is to work out what your players will find most interesting and
design your adventures around that.

For example, the first time I ran a FFW campaign, the characters started at
Lysen in the middle of a Zhodani attack. They escaped that and enlisted as
soon as they reached safety. They then ran with a convoy to Darrian, and
then on to the Five Sisters Subsector where they spent most of the rest of
the war foiling spy plots and administering Imperial policy.

For my second FFW campaign, the players were interested in shoot-em-up
adventures. So, after reading about the SBS Agean Campaign during WWII, I
set up a small commando-style hit & run unit, and my players spent the
majority of the war blowing things up and shooting people.

In my current FFW campaign, which has just started, the players are
merchants who are trying to trade in the demilitarised zone between the Zho
and the Imperium (i.e. that blank area around Arden). I am also running a
TCS PBEM set in this area, where the players each have small commerce-raider
type groups.

If you have any questions, please email me directly (dave_elrick@ps.co.uk)
or on this list (it might tempt others to give it a try) and I\'ll try to
help.

Kind Regards

Well, for those of you who missed it, GDW
announced it\'s closing down. :(

I for one certainly hope that someone or some
company picks up GDW\'s product lines and keeps
them going. Too bad that it seems to be a tough
time for the industry in general - WoC drops
it\'s RPG line, WW lays off a few of its people
and now GDW goes down. I\'ve even heard some rumors
about SJG cutting back on the GRUPS line.

Well, Roger Sanger picked up the remnants
of DGP, maybe this is a good business
opportunity for someone else to try to
rescue the Traveller line.

With regard to fleshing out details on trade, a good place to start might be
to investigate trade in the real world.  Disguise yourself as a highway
patrolman, flag down every tractor-trailer rig entering town, and find out
what they\'re carrying.  :)  Seriously, there must be some survey-of-the-
trucking-industry type book that would provide a good starting point...
anyone want to track down something in particular?  Then you\'d just need to

You mean the vaulted arch with flying buttresses?  This was an innovation,

techniques hadn\'t progressed that far.



As to differing rates of technological progress in the 20th century:

These are at least partly an artifact of the TL system.  The differences
within tech 3 are much greater than the differences between techs 7 and 8,
for example.

Yup, me too.  :-(

Now, before we all get too depressed, let\'s postulate some silver linings:

If the company closes down (rather than being shut down by the creditors), and
the games are not picked up, at what point do they fall into the public
domain?

It takes more than a sharp knife and hot water to perform useful
surgery. You need to know the role of the various organs, understand the
circulation of the blood, and have a clear idea concerning the effects of
the process.

It\'s all very well to talk about implementation TL vs discovery TL, but
the fact remains that in the REAL WORLD (Tm), we have approx TL 8-9 in
the West, and TL3-5 in the Developing World. Sure, they know all about
germs and infection - we\'ve told them all about it. It doesn\'t stop
malaria being the biggest killer in Africa and the Far East (close to 1m
deaths per year in Africa alone).

Knowledge is a VERY difficult thing to copyright, as publishers are now
finding with the popularisation of the Internet. Ideas are the most freely
transmittable goods of all. IMHO, you can tell somebody how to make good
claret until you are blue in the face, but you\'ll never get the real
thing (Hello California!). Those Zillan Eisweins are here to stay.

Exactly - its bollox to say that all you need to use mathematics is a

Many steps (Early Stone Age began circa 2 million years ago with H.erectus)

>From the Industry News topic in the GEnie Gaming Category:

GDW is closing down. One of the oldest companies in the industry, founded in
1973 as Game Designers\' Workshop, GDW has endured years of tough times. The
company, which now consists of Frank Chadwick and Susan Schug (comptroller
and print buyer), stops selling product January 19th and expects to be shut
down by the end of February.

GDW is NOT declaring bankruptcy, and will not be selling its products at
discounts. Schug says, "We\'ll do the best we can to take care of everybody
and find good homes for our games."
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sounds as if they\'ve decided to liquidate their assets. Well, it was bound
to happen, IMO. They\'ve done a good job of hanging in there when so many
other old-time wargame companies have long since vanished. I can only hope
that wherever Traveller finds a new home the new owners will take a lesson
from GDW\'s many mistakes in managing this product, starting with the MT de-
bacle.

    'body' => 'I have often considered it a major playability failing of Imperium Traveller
that there existed worlds that had interstellar contact (in the sense that
they had a starport of a reasonable rating) yet had very low tech levels. I
found it difficult to beleive that the technology involved in the starport
could be kept hidden from the surrounding world. The question always
followed that if they were able to hide the technology, why would they do
so? what possible purpose would it serve, for either the starport operators
or the travellers?
Some conspiracy theorists might argue that such a condition exists on Earth
today, with hidden landings of ET vehicles at top top secret facilities in
New Mexico or some such for the purpose of gradual transfer of technology.
Maybe Einstein did complete his unified field equations and they released
the secret of interstellar travel to a few able to realise their practical
potential but have been suppressed because of the destructive horrors they
also promised.
However, starports in Traveller aren\'t made out to be like secure facilities
hidden in the frozen polar wastes or anything like that. Traveller starports
are normally and most usually (correct me if I am wrong) more like Moss
Isley of Star War or as Whangaparoa was to early New Zealand.
In my Traveller universe TL is more an indication of indigenous productive
ability rather than availability. For example TL 10 doesn\'t mean there is
nobody walking around or operating on that world with TL15 equipment ofr
facilities, it just means that the world has to import any products over
TL10. ie there is no indigenous PGMP and no locally designed and
manufactured Battledress. TL then is a good approximation of availability.
No doubt this is way many of you also referee your games. I still have
problems with justifying it sometimes. One would expect the gap in TL
between the world and the imperial norm to close very quickly once contact
had been made, especially for resource rich worlds.

They *did* build them! The remains of some sort of geared calculating
device were found underwater near some Greek island some years back.
It\'s thought it was used for astronomical work.

Another example is that there\'s evidence (not widely accepted) that
electroplating was known in Mesopotamia!

The problem is that until you get to things like printing, and
especially *patents*, people have a distinct advantage in keeping
inventions *secret*. So it\'s easy for them to be lost.

I can\'t recall specific examples, but I recall reading that the
archaeolgical record has numerous examples of things being invented and
then *lost* before they finally become widespread enough to "stick".

You have to remember that the mindset and culture were a *lot*
different until quite recently in history. And it\'s likely that they
would be for *any* "primitive" culture.

The transistor was patented around 1900! Only they didn\'t know *why* it
worked. So they couldn\'t follow up on it. And tubes took over.

Actually, if you are going to go by Earth\'s history, then TL 0 is
actually more like 20,000 to 40,000 BC! That\'s the "Paleolithic" era.
TL 1 is the "Neolilthic" era. (note that the names essentially Latin
for "old stone age" and "new stone age").

The Paleolithic (as I recall) has crude stone tools and hunter/gatherer
cultures. The Neolithic has much more refined tools, domesticated
animals, and agriculture.

The next stages occured at different times in different places, but
only occured in a very few places on Earth. In *all* of them, the key
factor seems to have been *organized* agriculture. In Mesopotamia,
Egypt, China, India, SouthEast Asia, and some locations in the Americas
the pattern was discovering irrigation, which led to the *requirement*
for supervised labor to maintain the irrigation systems. This led to a
ruling class, which led to temples and cities, as well as arithmetic
and writing.

We have *multiple* cases that are considered to be *independent*
inventions of "civilization". Mespototamia (Assyria, Babylon). Egypt.
China. The Indus valley. Cambodia (Angkor Wat). The Maya. The Inca.
Note that the last two are interesting in that they did *not* involve
rivers. The Aztecs were *heavily* influenced by the Maya.

> >>Transportation: Primitive carts.

Carts seem to be *late* Neolithic or even early "civilization". Canoes
are late Paleolithic to mid Neolithic technology (check out the
cultures that *used* canoes). Carts require a *lot* more work. And more
to the point, they require *roads*!

Better re-check the historical and anthropological records. Medicine
actually starts in *paleolithic* cultures! Primitive does *not* mean
"dumb". They may not have the scientific method, but they can still
notice cause and effect. They will have *quite* a variety of drugs,
and even some surgical skills.

Babylon was at least "early civilization".

After Roman times. It\'s one of the reasons they needed so many slaves.
Without the horse collar, a slave can exert more power than a horse!

And the stirrup wasn\'t really used until around 1000 AD.

Actually, back in the old days, they\'d copy *everything*, right down to
the makers marks. They weren\'t really sure what was necessary and what
wasn\'t.

One of the ironies of this is that when they first got their hands on a
"modern" rifle (back in the 1800s) they captured a *sniper* weapon.
Which they faithfully copied, giving the British no end of problems.
The old Enfield is still a good weapon...

The more modern stuff (AK-47 etc) is actually stuff that was *designed*
to be made by low tech means. It\'s just that the designers didn\'t
expect quite *this* low a tech. :-)

I guess the only thing I want to know is - to whom are they selling their
licenses?  PLEASE GOD NOT TSR!!!!!!
Sorry to hear them go, but (pure realpolitik here) I guess I would hope that
whomever picks up their stuff (my hope would be maybe steve jackson games
for a dynamic company) can rejuvenate it a little bit, and maybe take it
into new directions - there was a thread here long ago about the natural
appropriateness of Traveller being the first role playing game published
entirely in Hypermedia on CD - i mean think about it.  All the Traveller
stuff that you could cram onto a CD?  Sector/sytem/planet/character/ship
generator programs, maps, pictures (good raytraced ones!) etc etc.  Now THAT
would be a kickass product - one that unfortunately it would take a fairly
cash-rich company to be willing to try to do.

Copyright ends 50 years after the death of the author.  For corporate
copyright, the figure is 50 years plus X after publication.  (I think X=30,
but I\'m not certain offhand.)

So don\'t hold your breath.  (And also keep in mind that widespread copyright
violation will make acquisition by another company more unlikely.)

On the bright side, Runequest has survived a similar interregnum, so it can
be done.

The industry news about GDW going out of business after 23 years mentions the
reversion of Harpoon, Johnny Reb, and certain other titles, but their press
release is not specific about Traveller. The Traveller systems (including
Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, and New Era)have reverted, or will revert
to myself (Marc Miller).

Rest easy, I am working hard at setting the agenda for the coming years. Wish

The travller book you are looking for is Adventer 12 "Secret of the
Ancients".

 The Droyne were the true Ancients, they had reached tech level 10 when a
Mutation occurred and a Droyne(Grandfather) was bord with a fantastic level
of intelligence. He took over his world, he found a cure for growing old,
and invented jump drive.
  One day he decided that the Droyne were not intelligent enough to help in
the really important projects, so he decided to have children. He had twenty
children, and each of those children had about twenty of their own. At that
point,that was enough so he stopped. At about this time he adopted the name
which is translated as Grandfather.
  For a long time, Grandfather worked on wide variety of projects, assigning
parts of each to his children. Thay scattered across the galaxy in search of
infomation.
  Each of Grandfathers children and great grandchildren was in charge of a
work force of Droyne. Each took an assignment from grandfather and set about
finding answers.
  After a vacation Grandfather call to all his children to help him on a new
project, but many were to busy with there own project or did not come. So
Grandfather went ahead anyway, but soon found his children in his way and
decided that it was a mistake to have them. So he went about fixing it.
  It was war, and it went on for two thousand years. Staggering weapons were
called into use, including planet-busters, nova-triggers, bombardment with
asteroids. By the end of the war, Grandfather had beaten all opposing
factions and destroyed all his children. With droyne blasted back to the
stone age, Grandfather pinch of a pocket universe. Were he lives to this very
day.

Hope this helps you out.

I\'m mot. I\'m claiming that if the components of some technology is available
at some TL then that technology COULD exist at that TL _given the proper
knowledge_. Why? Because it dosen\'t make sense to rank TLs in the Traveller
universe according to the historical accidents of one single planet, not
even if that planet is Earth. In the Traveller Universe the Ancients spread
humans around on about a 100 worlds, and on about half of these the humans
survived. That gives us 50 histories right there and if even one of them
duplicated Earth\'s tech developements exactly I\'d be very surprised. Then
there\'s litterally hundreds of alien races each with their own histories (I
once calculated that there\'s a minor indigenous race per subsector on the
average (though I confess that I forget just what I based that estimate
on)).

It didn\'t happen at TL 0 on Earth (At least not if you don\'t accept Babylonia
and Egypt as TL 0 societies - which is OK by me). But postulate a world with
some more fertile areas where, say 4 people could gather enough food to keep
5 people alive (4:1 was the proportion of peasants to city-dwellers in the
Middle Ages). Right away you have a leisure class at TL 0. Remember the
"orchards" of Darrien? In that environment the Darrians could easily have
invented writing at a very early stage.

But the idea is not tied to a particular TL. (Indeed, as someone else pointed
out in another message, skulls have been found of people who have had holes
punched into heads and survived.) In the Traveller Universe you have 1000s
of non-interdicted worlds that has nevertheless very low TLs, some of them
even TL 0. How to explain that when they have access to the highest learning
in Charted space? The only explanation that makes sense to me is that
Traveller TLs are not what ideas you have, but what ideas you use. In
other words, what technology has been _implemented_.

None of which is beyond the ability of anyone once they get the idea. And I
postulate that the ideas are freely available.

But if someone came and told us how to do it, could we implement it quickly?
If we could then superconductors are TL 8; if not, they aren\'t.

But in the Traveller Universe the idea dosen\'t have to be invented. They did
that already on Terra... and on Vland... and on Zhdant... and on Darrian...

But they can be used at TL 0. I know that for a fact, because the Plains

Yes, but there\'s no reason why someone couldn\'t introduce the idea of writing
into a TL 0 society without further ado. The tools are all there for the
making: Sticks and clay tablets, ink and papyrus, hard stone and softer
stone, flint and wood - all are available at TL 0. You don\'t need steel pens
and paper to write. Oh, and there\'s the Inka system of knots in string.

Copper and iron are the same TL in Traveller (which may be wrong, but it is).

Sure, but saddles (leatherwork) is surely not a higher TL than ironworking?

By that token every Traveller society except those on interdicted worlds
would be TL 15. My point is that the knowledge is available. So TL is _not_
(except for the top "cutting edge" TL) a matter of discoveries, it\'s a
matter of wether or not those discoveries are being used on this or that
particular world.

Funny you (and others) should mention SJG. I first got the post on GDW
shutting down on the GURPSnet mailing list. The GURPS list is going through
one of its perrenial "Worldbooks we\'d like to see, and as usual people are
saying things like "GURPS Traveller" and "GURPS 2300AD". I myself have
started using GURPS for Twilight:2000 and it works wonderfully.

I\'d suggest that any Xboaters who are interested in seeing Traveller go to
SJG (if for no other reason than lack of a better company, unless the newly
revitalized DGP picks it up) contact SJG and GDW.

>I just thought I\'d ask what people on the list thought of Steve

Have they already moved on this? Where did you hear that SJG was already
planning to make some offers?

Sure, that\'s why GDW did it the same way, I presume. But it\'s still a mistake.
What\'s the point of having 11.000 worlds to stomp around in if they\'re all
going to be copies of Earth? Yet by making the Earth history some kind of
tech developement template, you make it that much more difficult to
introduce worlds with interesting variations.

Why? There are ample examples of things that are just the result of random
invention processes.

Of course there is. That\'s the whole essense of the concept of TLs, IMO. You
can\'t have TL 5 without some TL 4 foundations, etc. I agree. But the
inventions are already done. We don\'t have to wait for someone to invent
the microscope so that we can discover germs, because in the year 5600 AD
the microscope has been invented scores of times on scores of worlds and
we already know about germs and know how to deal with them.

But if you are a Referee preparing an adventure on Chaosheo (E87A788-1 in
1117) you couldn\'t care less about what the ancient Greeks did or didn\'t
do. What\'s interesting is wether the Chaosheans can have a turing machine
or not. Can they? Why not? If the ancient Greeks _could_ have invented it
then who\'s to say the Chaoseans didn\'t?

But was that because they didn\'t realize what they could have done with it
or because they _couldn\'t_ build steam engins of a useful size with their
metallurgy. If the first, then steam powewr IS possible on a TL 1 world;
if the second the it isn\'t. I think the difference is rather crucial.

But the useful knowledge is wether the natives of Rabwhar/Five Sisters could

or not.

Propably for the same reason why it took centuries from the time lenses

TL 9+ is something GDW defines and is thus less open to debate than the
historical stuff. I do have the notion that Terra today is propably of a
fairly high Computer TL - higher than TL 8, anyway.

Metalworking is TL 1, isn\'t it? And I did suggest that there might well be
a difference between early metalworking and fine metalworking - possibly
more than one. And there\'s a difference between making glass drinking
vessels and vaccum tubes.

A very crude, low-capacity calculator might be possible. In fact, it is.
It\'s called an abacus (and not so crude, either).

Get the old "Secret of the Ancients" adventure. According to it, the
Ancients were Droyne.

If you don\'t wish to go along with at least *part* of that, then feel
free to make the Ancients one species or many. And describe them as you
see fit.

For what it is worth, Traveller owes a *lot* to Andre Norton\'s books.
And the "Ancients" are clearly based on her "Forerunners". The
Forerunners were\'nt even one *culture* much less one species. It was a
catch-all term for all civilizations that had gone extinct before the
recorded history of any of the *current* civilizations.

All (or at least *most*) of the stuff is copyright by a *company*. That
means they get a straight 50 (or is it 75?) years form copyright date.

CT came out in 1980. So it won\'t be PD until at least 2030.

Anything copyright by the *author* is good for 50( ort is it 75?) years
AFTER THE AUTHOR DIES. Since nnone of them are dead, the clock hasn\'t
even started ticking yet.

Basicly, if it is copyrighted, forget about it becoming PD in your
lifetime.

Who says it is hidden? Take a good look around at Earth. We\'ve got
international airport in just about every country, yet aside from the
surrounding "airtown" there are many countries where the tech level
drops *drastically* once you get outside.

It\'s not just a matter of manufacturing capability. It\'s also a matter
of *money*. Many places, there\'s little money to *spend* on high tech
stuff.

And even in "resource rich" areas, what makes you think that the
*natives* are getting the profits from the resources? In some cases,
the *government* is getting a cut, but often that\'s as far as it goes.
The ruler and his cronies have money, and buy high tech stuff (often
things that the country really *doesn\'t* need). The people don\'t see a
lot of it except for the few cheap consumer goods that they can afford
(not even much of that).

You have to consider that much of the "high tech" stuff doesn\'t really
have much *appeal* to the average native. Again, look at things here on
earth. Medicine is wanted, because it solves a problem. Radios are
popular, because they bring useful info, and some entertainment (trust
me, that *is* the order of priorities involved). This in spite if the
*huge* cost of batteries (a reason why radios with solar panels are
popular!)

But laptop computers? What would they use them *for*?

To put it another way, why would *you* want a TL15 neutrino detector?
Unless you are a physicist, it\'s not of any use to you.

No more so than it has on earth. It takes *money* to build the
factories, and takes training to staff them. Take a good look at most
third world countries, and even at a lot of countries not usually
considered as such.

Lock of money and training will *always* slow down upgrading the tech
level. And at the lower tech levels, there\'s another factor, not often
considered. Few people in developed countries really *understand* what
terms like "subsistence agriculture" *mean*. It means that you *cannot*
take any significant fraction of the population away from food
production without causing mass starvation. That condition is common to
most TLs up until the equivalent of the 1600s or so.

Steve Jackson himself posted on this subject in rec.games.board and
Steffen (sp?) O\'Sullivan echoed that post to rec.games.frp.misc.

So far all I\'ve heard is that rights devolve to Marc Miller and that
SJ is interested and has made it known to Frank Chadwick (I think)
that he\'s interested.

I guess it\'s \'cross your fingers\' time.

I wouldn\'t care WHO put out traveller, provided they go back to the CT/MT
Backgrounds, and don\'t screw up the C-Gen or Playing rules too much.
HOWEVER, I don\'t want to see "GURPS Traveller" as the new rulesset; maybe
as a liscenced crossover, fine.

Personally, I want a return to the MT Rules, with full advanced generation
available for all 18 careers in the basic system, plus all the others that
have cropped up elsewhere.

I also would like to see alien modules as detailed as DGP put out. GDW\'s
were good for CT, passable with minimal mods for MT, but the "Hiver and
Ithklur" turned my stomach with it\'s sappy, sarcastic, unprofessional tone.
It seemed to be taken from a Paranoia crossover.

I want an equipment design system that has been thoroughly tested out; one
where guns that should weigh 20 pounds don\'t come in at 30 kilos!

I want a consolidated work that includes all the old TNS entries into a
single volume.

I think that GURPS Traveller as a crossover would be an excellent
idea.  Initially I am tickled pink by the idea of SJG picking up
Traveller.  However, I don\'t think that they would want to put out a
full line of Traveller stuff (I may be wrong).

I think that we would need to come to a new happy medium.  Personally,
I think that the character generation in TNE are the best out of all
of them.  I also think that TNE had the strongest skill system out of
any of the three (yes, even though it was the opposite of the CT/MT
system).  As for advanced character generation, I always found it to
be a tad too much.  The detail was excellent, however it\'s only real
purpose was to give a year-by-year breakdown of what the character
did.  I find it just as easy, and sometimes more fun to do this
yourself.

I like the product wish list.  I won\'t argue whether or not the tone
of H&I.  However, I will say that it was definitely comprehensive.
Much more so than the original Alien Modules.

As much as everyone wants to bust on FFS, we still use it.  It was the
first product that gave gamers the ability to build almost anything
technical in their game world (3G^3 was the first to present
comprehensive rules for hand-held weapons though).  So, I guess that
maybe we shouldn\'t bust on it too harshly.  Learn from it and realize
that game\'s rules system has to be consistent across the foundations
of the game rather than grasp all of the nuiances of modern-day
items.

I think the big thing will be creating sourcebooks for campaigning in
any era of Traveller.  This will keep most of us content.

1.  It\'s a shame about GDW closing down, but companies come and
companies go.  GDW hasn\'t been the focus of my attentions, it\'s
been the games..particularly Traveller.  I\'m sorry to see TW2k go
down the tubes too!

2.  I haven\'t been enthused about where GDW has been carrying
Traveller the last few years..never liked the Virus, even the
rebellion wasn\'t really where I wanted to to play or run games.

3.  SJG *might* be a good new owner for the Traveller products.
Are they interested in buying *all* of Traveller?  What about 2300AD?
What about TW2K?  Personally, I see them as a package.  But
anyway, SJ Games is an active and innovative publisher.  I like
GURPS well enough for it to be my second favorite system.  <g>
But frankly, I suspect they would treat Traveller more as source
books or world books than a system, and GURPify it as much as
possible.  I *could* live with that, but it wouldn\'t be my first
choice.

4.  Marc Miller has written that Traveller rights devolve to him.
I don\'t know why Mr Miller walked away from GDW and Traveller a
few years ago.  I\'ve heard it was because he was \'burned out\' on
trying to make a living selling games, but that\'s only second
hand rumor.  Would Marc be able or willing to do what it takes to
keep Traveller in print?  What versions of Traveller will he
support?  Will he have control over how Traveller history
develops?  What does he make of the Virus, for example?  <g> Will
he control TW2K and 2300AD, or just Traveller..and does that
include TNE?

5.  Wherever Traveller ends up, I think it will survive.  IMHO, it is
the only really good SF based gaming system around and as such
we\'ll be using it whether it\'s in print or not.  Until something
better comes along, and nothing has come along now has it?

6.  Whoever picks up Traveller will be in a position to do
something I\'d really like to see..a divorce between the Traveller
game *system* and the Traveller game *history*.  Yes, yes I
know..so don\'t start flaming me!  <g> I realize that the detailed
history is what sets Traveller apart from everything else, so I\'m
not suggesting that we dump it.  Just that we sanction and
develop more than one!

What I\'d like to see is a general game system (that\'s what the
TNE rules were going to be, I think), and several Official
Histories.  Three that I can think of right now:  a. the Virus
collapsed history; b. the Rebellion induced Hard Times history; c.
the Classic Imperium where the Rebellion failed and no Virus was
ever released.  Maybe there could be other Histories that are
officially sanctioned and supported as well, but that are still
based on the Same System Of Rules.

Well that\'s my two cents anyway.

[and other stuff snipped]

Other people have pointed you at the droyne and Secret of the Ancients,
but actually you should pay more attention to that "cryptic stuff".
EVEN AMONG EXPERTS (like your archeologist player) the Ancients
are still mostly a mystery. The Ancients have been a subject of study
for the last ten thousand years, and most questions are STILL best
anwered by "We don\'t know."


What _is_known?

They lived a quarter-million years ago, and were the most technologically
advanced race in existence, past or present. They ranged all over
Charted Space, and spread humaniti across the stars. They vanished
200,000 years ago in what is assumed to be a cataclysmic war, judging
from some of the wreckage (which includes asteroid belts that
_used_ to be planets).
     Their technology is estimated to have been TL 25-35, though it\'s
tough to rate anything that advanced. Complicating things further,
nearly every Ancients site seems to stem from its own
technological base -- standards, architecure, materials, all are
unique to each site, causing some to question whether the Ancients
were actually a single race. Remarkably, a rare few artifacts have
been found that were still functional, after millenia of neglect. Most,
however, are inert and have no discernable purpose.

The identity of the Ancients is unknown, but three modern major
races have _some_ sort of tie to them:

Humaniti: Terra is the only world with a fossil record of humans
and proto-humans prior to the Ancients period. Apparently the
Ancients removed some humans from Terra, and those humans
became the Vilani, Zhodani, and various human Minor Races.
Some minor races show indications of genetic manipulation.

Vargr: Terran canines genetically uplifted to sapience and
bipedalism. There are no known "Vargr minor races", so
it seems the Vargr were only placed (or survived) on Lair.

Droyne: Much has been made of the link between the Ancients
and the Droyne, but to put it in perspective, most of what is
known about the Droyne vis-a-vis the Ancients could just as
equally describe humans or vargr.
     The Droyne homeworld has never been identified. The Droyne
were spread onto many worlds, just as humans were. Many other
worlds have Chirpers, a degenerate, uncasted form of Droyne.
(Some researchers think using the term "degenerate Droyne" for Chirpers
gets things backwards. These scientists believe that the Droyne are
uplifted Chirpers, something well within Ancient capabilities, as it is a less
radical alteration than the vargr were.)

*******************************

Overall, your archeologist player will probably know the details
about assorted "cryptic player stuff" better than anyone else
and have a firmer grip on the breadth of general information,
but is no more likely to know the "real details" of the Ancients
than a merc, free trader, or plumber. The information just isn\'t there.
Ancientology is long on speculation and mysterious artifacts,
but maddeningly short on hard, verifiable facts.

This is sort of a generic response, but I thought you would like to hear
something as soon as possible.

Where Traveller Is Going  -  I

        In order to keep as many people as possible informed, I will (fro=
m time to
time) put out my opinion of where Traveller should go now that it I am
responsible for its future.

        Traveller needs to be revitalized with a wider audience who will =
appreciate
and love the game as much as its dedicated fans have in past years. Since=
 its
original publication in 1977, Traveller has been the pre-eminent
science-fiction game, covering role-playing, boardgames, miniatures, and
computer games. My vision is three fold=85 a comprehensive, rules system,
continually expanding background and history, and a wide variety of produ=
cts
in print, electronic, and other media.

        Comprehensive Rules System. The game system rules will be consoli=
dated based
on the original Classic Traveller rules (revised in light of 20 years of
role-playing experience). I envision adding to the basic rules a task sys=
tem
and a vehicle design system. The game rules will concentrate on the vehic=
les,
starships, and equipment players will encounter and use (rather than cove=
ring
every possibility). The key is that these rules must be easy to use, easy=
 to
understand, and accessible.

        Continually Expanding History. With two decades of experience pro=
ducing
material for Traveller, we now have a broad canvas against which to play.=
 I
envision providing in general form to players approximately ten eras (or
campaign settings), each defined enough to permit a number of adventures =
and
campaigns. Some (5 of the 12 or so) of these eras would be:
1.  Grandfather=92s Children. Adventuring in the heyday of the Ancients.
2.  The Long Night. The period after the collapse of the Rule of Man.
3.  The Early Imperium. The expansion of the Imperium into unexplored
territory.
4.  The Civil War. The many factions fight to take over the Third Imperiu=
m.
5.  The Virus Era.
(and others)

        Wide Variety of Products. In addition to print products like the
comprehensive rules set, campaign settings, equipment books, and adventur=
es,
I would like to see:
        The On-Line Traveller (through MPGN) get off the ground.
        CD-ROM of all Traveller materials.
        Big Traveller Poster. Consists of a map of the Spinward Marches, =
the
Imperial Map, some of the aliens.
        1996 Traveller T-Shirt
        Computer Referee=92s Aids
        Background Documents
        Novels
        Pseudo-Historical Sourcebooks
        Traveller Trading Card Game
        Traveller Story-Telling Card Game
        Posters and Art Prints
        Comics and Graphic Novels
        ID Cards
        Cardboard Fold-up Starships
        Cardboard Fold-up Grav Tanks

        Feedback is essential, so I consider this vision subject to chang=
e, and I
actively invite constructive criticism of this vision, with your own opin=
ions
of where we should go, and how we should get there.

        I am actively in discussions with potential publishers, artists, =
writers,
and licensees about Traveller. If you know of a potential participant in
Traveller, please give him or her my name and email address.

Thanks,

Someone has already mentioned my trade pages, but I\'ll advertise them again:

URL http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~spe/Rules/Trade/Trade.html

These are a hypertexted version of the rules I use for my Traveller
game.  I\'ve just realised that the all important tables are missing,
because hypertexting them was a pain.  These rules are based on the
Merchant Prince/MT trade rules, plus expansion rules from a Challenge
supplement.  I use the MT rules to determine the relative price of goods
between a gven source and a given destination.  As someone pointed out,
this doesn\'t work v well as a carrying trade goods from one world to
another gives you a similar price regardless of what they are.  The only
variation in price comes from the table at the end of selling; buying
price is absolutely fixed.  In addition, cargoes are given exciting
titles such as C-E Cr 3400 NiAg 540 kl.

I\'ve introduced tables (which I\'ve missed out of the hypertext pages
--sorry)  which allow me to roll up cargo types in a range of about 40
different types (eg. Meat, grain, livestock, electronics).  Someone
pointed out that it is ludicrous to reduce all possible commodities to a
small number of categories; however, it is the only way to get variety
and still provide tables to aid the imagination -- if you want "pets" as
suggested in an earlier xboat, then just say your next livestock cargo
consists of such pets.  That is the variety in types dealt with.
However, variety in type also results in a variety in price: Under
textiles, silk commands a higher price than sackcloth.  Thus, I have a
Quality modifier, based on the cargo type (again, these are in the
missing tables), which is multiplied by the base cost, and so represents
the range of different values which the different varieties of a given
cargo type can command.

The second point I\'ve solved is the fact that prices vary according to
the market.  Each cargo has a market value, represented by the Market
modifier.  This is also multiplied by the base cost to give an asking
price.  When the cargo is sold, the local market can be assessed to find
an asking price.  The price of a cargo is then:

Base cost/price x Quality modifier x Market modifier

I have my players roll uncertain tasks to determine the Quality and the
Market, and together these give a range of possible values for the cargo.
These rules introduce variety in the products available, and allow
uncertainty to creep into the trade process.

I\'ll try and post the missing tables, or perhaps include them in the web
pages as ps files.

     Someone forwarded your mailing to the HIWG mailing list to the general
\'old Traveller\' mailing list (xboat@mpgn.com).  Since you solicit feedback,
I\'m pleased to be able to write to you.

     If you don\'t mind, I\'d like to enthuse for a paragraph or two.  I have
been a fan of Traveller since the day after the first boxed set arrived in
my local hobby shop in 1977, although the last Traveller product that I bought
was Survival Margin.  (Not your fault, after your time and all that!)  I still
keep a copy of Starter Traveller (the most compact form of the rules) tucked
into my briefcase, just in case I feel like fiddling with it a bit.  My
collection of Traveller materials includes everything issued by GDW and DGP
for CT and MT, plus assorted things from other people (with Gamelords books
being my favorite third party material.)  I\'m very pleased to see that the
rights are reverting to you, and I hope that you will be able to get something
back into publication in short order.

     I would like to offer you my services as well.  I am a freelance proof-
reader as my second profession, and I am very familiar with the existing
Traveller corpus.  I would be happy to proof for your venture, and can hope
to spot mechanical errors in the process.  (A typical rulebook might take
two weeks, allowing for checking of the rules.)  For this project, you can
have my services at a very nominal fee, rather than the $0.85/page I get for
reading bodice-rippers...

    Now on to my reactions to your posted ideas:

Yes.  I really think that the DGP task system was one of the best innovations
added to the basic CT rules, and I\'d be content if it was carried over intact
into the new game.  I would also _strongly_ (!!!) urge that you give due
consideration to the maintenance of continuity with existing campaigns by
carrying forward the basics of character generation.  I consider one of the
strengths of D&D to be the fact that everything from original D&D forward has
compatible character descriptions.  (Theirs tend to become more elaborate,
but Traveller has done that too.)  In other words--I think that changing to
a totally different rules system was a rotten idea, because it voided my
fifteen years of accumulated work.  (So I\'ve been planning on carrying on
with the old rules when I next start up.)

I think that an SF game needs a design system, and I spent a lot of time with
the MegaTraveller system, which I rather disliked.  (Still, I have an archive
of over 300 designs, all of which were posted to the Traveller mailing list,
and a number of which made it into published Traveller materials via Charles
Gannon.)  A usable system, to my mind, is one which does not require a
computer!  I\'m less worried about whether various real world items can be
recreated exactly, and even less worried about the fringes of the system
where it starts to break down.  It would be nice, though, if both of the
latter points were addressed in some sort of designer\'s notes, so that
everyone would realize from the outset that there are holes, and to have an
idea of where they are.  I don\'t think that higher detail helps--just inspires
more questions.  No one ever had a problems with Book 2 starship design, as
far as I could tell...

??? What is this?  Something other that the mailing lists?

If you could put out an archive disk of everything done to date, I\'d probably
buy a CD drive to use it.  Hypertext linkages among the material would be
fantastic.  I\'d love to be able to hand the players a "library data" disk
and let them sift for the clues...

Maybe.

Another maybe--I wrote a program to do trade with book 2 rules once, and
I guess I\'d use something to generate animal encounters tables and planetary
data, but I\'d rather not need a spreadsheet to design a vehicle.

Unless they were really good, I\'d sonner read Piper, Anderson, Doc Smith and
the other inspirations for the game.

Probably I\'d buy.  Not anything for the Virus era though.

Blech.  No offense, but I really think the card game market is supersaturated
at the moment.

I\'ve been builidng cardboard buildings recently, and it\'s an acquired taste.

Well, if it\'s to be an SF game, get the robots and the aliens out early, and
my personal opinion is that you can\'t have too much background data.

I can\'t do calculus with a calculator. But I CAN do calculus with a
stick and some dirt. In fact, I HAVE done calculus with a stick and dirt
(well, sand actually).

I don\'t think it\'s bollux to say that Tech-Level is not the same thing
as Knowledge-Level. In fact, it may be more closely related to something
that could be called "Industry-Level". Knowlege level varies from
individual to individual. But Tech-Level, as I understand it, describes
a culture\'s capabilities, not an individual\'s knowledge.

To put things crassly, TL says what a character is allowed to buy, at
the manufacturer\'s retail price, when he\'s on a particular world. (Maybe
it should be called "Shopping-Level" :) ) Obviously TL is nothing more
than a broad generalization; the referee has to decide all the
particulars, as always. So what else is new?

I guess the interesting issue is why you can\'t buy anything anywhere in
the Imperium. There could be dozens of reasons for any given shopping
restrictions (ie, TL) for classes of merchandise on a given world.
Reasons could be economic, industrial, political, military, educational,
astrographical, sociological, theological, or even sometimes (as the TL
tables themselves might suggest) historical.  I guess this particular
will have to be left to the referee as well.

Just for the record, the only innovations I\'ve liked since the demise of
"Classic" Traveller have been:
     1) MT personal combat--it finally made sense to be afraid if somebody
pointed a body pistol at you.  Far from perfect, but IMHO an improvement over
"Classic"
     2) Task system in general
     3) more detailled ship/vehicle design
     4) Hard Times--with MT, the TRAVELLER universe had begun to feel more
settled and certain.  What\'s the use of the scout service and ships\' sensors
when you can just pick up an atlas of the Imperium.  Hard Times made things
uncertain again, which was good.
** All the above refer to MT only.  I\'ve glanced at TNE, and I hate the virus
and think the game mechanics are way too involved.  Besides, I was
emotionally attached to using just D6\'s.

5.  Wherever Traveller ends up, I think it will survive.  IMHO, it is
the only really good SF based gaming system around...

6.  Whoever picks up Traveller will be in a position to do
something I\'d really like to see..a divorce between the Traveller
game *system* and the Traveller game *history*.  Yes, yes I
know..so don\'t start flaming me!  <g> I realize that the detailed
history is what sets Traveller apart from everything else, so I\'m
not suggesting that we dump it.  Just that we sanction and
develop more than one!

What I\'d like to see is a general game system (that\'s what the
TNE rules were going to be, I think), and several Official
Histories.  Three that I can think of right now:  a. the Virus
collapsed history; b. the Rebellion induced Hard Times history; c.
the Classic Imperium where the Rebellion failed and no Virus was
ever released.  Maybe there could be other Histories that are
officially sanctioned and supported as well, but that are still
based on the Same System Of Rules.

Well that\'s my two cents anyway.

Eris Reddoch
----
I generally agree with Eris, except I\'d prefer some kind of threfold
division:  (1) TRAVELLER rules, (2) TRAVELLER setting, (3) TRAVELER history.
I liked the MT rules, but I liked the CT setting because it\'s so broad and
vague.  At the very beginning, there was a feeling that you could make it
almost any science-fiction setting you wanted.  As the years went on, and
library data piled up, the universe became much more certain and settled.  By
the time MT came out for example, you KNEW you wouldn\'t find Hivers running
around the Spinward Marches.  I felt I couldn\'t build my own planets or
subsectors, because I\'d be violating canon (even when I didn\'t have the
"canon" data).  Hard Times was a signifcant improvement because all of a
sudden, the universe was uncertain again and you could genuinely surprise
your players.

I accept most of what you have to say and agree with much of it.
However, I never said anything about equity or social justice. History has
shown that  the speed of development is often inversely related to equity of
distribution. In fact "Forced Saving" of one kind or another has been very
common in the development histories of many countries on Earth whether it is
imposed by an authoritarian regime or by the natural process of unregulated
free-market capitalism. History has shown that the speed of capital
accumulation and distribution equity are inversely related.

Mass starvation was a regular occurance in the history of the Soviet Union
and its cause was not just "extraordinary cold winters". Forced Saving - the
confiscation of food product to feed the workers in factories in towns and
cities in order to maintain production of manufactured goods - was the cause
of much starvation in rural areas. At the height of its development drive
the Soviet Union achieved (using comparable growth and development measures)
in 10 years what it had taken 60 years to achieve in the United States.
I don\'t believe in this kind of system but it makes my point that forced
sacrifice and saving are implicit in rapid development.

Having said all that, I accept that in many situations accumulated capital
would be channelled offworld and coreward as in the "enclave" type system
that some developing countries on Earth experienced. The more I think about
it, you are right in thinking that this sort of arrangement would be
widespread especially under the Imperium.

Module from NE. It was, for the most part, merely a word for word copy with
snide remarks thrown in. what little was actually reworked (excluding
system mechanics stuff, including CGen) was LESS detailed, and less well
worded, IMNSHO. I wound up using my old CT module more than H&I.

As to someone else\'s comment about NE CGen vs CT/MT CGen:

I want to see the old system for 4 reasons:

1: It provides more detail about the character\'s hiostory (under Adv Gen),
something my players have always wanted/needed/used.

2: It is inherently faster than TNE, as there are fewer player decisions.

3: It produces more realistic, albeit more a problem with players,
characters; I have had TNE Characters doing in excess of 15d6 damage with a
non-critical punch.

4: It is easier for new players to assimilate. Many of my experienced
(decade or more) gamers had difficulty understanding, using, and working
with TNE. Nobody I know has had anywhere near the difficulties with CT/MT
in either basic or advanced generation.

5: I dislike TNE except for the streamlined task system. FF&S.

The Ithklur were mentioned in a passing (what, about a paragraph or so
of text) in the original Alien Module.  It did an excellent job of
relating everything from Hiver anatomy to history to thier current
position in TNE.  The character generation stuff fit in perfectly with
the stuff from the rulebook.

My guess is that the reason you despise it so is simply because of
it\'s nature as being a New Era product.  No, I take that back, I will
admit that many people may not have found any humor in the jokes that
were presented in the book.  But that still does not make it a poor
reference material.

:

Only for Army, Navy, Scout, and Merchant characters.  I find that
every character I\'ve ever created with the advanced system had similar
backgrounds.  I would rather just make it up myself.  Hmm, he\'s got
Zero-G skill as a merchant.  How about if he learned it while serving
on a TL 9 free trader?  You know stuff like that.  I find that
player\'s create an infinitely more interesting history than such
heavy-handed rules can.

Plus, in the old system, a character couldn\'t change careers.  That
never turned out to be too much of a problem with the basic character
generation, but it got to be impossible with the advanced character
generation.

: 2: It is inherently faster than TNE, as there are fewer player decisions.

As a roleplayer, I should probably be offended by the last remark.
Not for the time, but for that player crack.  Players like generating
quick characters, but they also like to have control over their
destinies.  As an aside, I created a character using the MT and TNE
rules.  A three term character who spent two terms as a scout and one
term as a merchant.  MT basic and TNE took about the same amount of
time (for MT I created both a three term scout and a two term/one term
scout/merchant).  This came out to about 12 minutes.  Not the quickest
character generation compared to some systems, but not the half-hour
most games expect you to put into creating a character.

Uhm, I think those are the combat rules that you have a real problem
with.  The way derived values like HTH damage and the like are handled
aren\'t really caused by the character creation rules so much as they\'re
affected by the combat rules.

The problem I see here is that you\'re saying it\'s hard for all the
old-time player who don\'t want to adapt to something new?  Or is it
something else?  I was the first to blast (and blast hard) at the
changes that were made between MT and TNE.  I though "house system,
bah!"  But I actually gave it a chance.  I found lots of things that I
liked.  Granted, I also found lots of things that I didn\'t like.

: 5: I dislike TNE except for the streamlined task system. FF&S.

Wil, I think what you really mean to say is that you dislike the TNE
storyline.  I will agree with you that FFS is a fantastic product!
And I will give kudos to the task system even though I liked MT\'s very
much.

Remember, here on earth we have numerous examples of *independently
evolved* cultures, civilizations and technologies. At TL 0 there are
*hundreds*. At TL1 there are still a dozen or so. After that we start
getting too much cross-fertilizing.

But for TL 0 and TL1 (and even some of TL2) we actually *do* have
enough of a sample to make some statements regarding what tech gets
developed when.

Now *there*, we have some interesting possibilities. There have been
recent threads on rec.arts.sf.science regarding how tech would develop
for such things as water breathers.

Sorry, you are sufferring from a common misconception. TL0
hunter/gatherers have *more* leisure time than even *we* do. It only
takes a few hours a day to provide the necessities of life. The rest of
the time is free to do what you want.

The introduction of of agriculture *reduces* free time, and you don\'t
start getting it back until this century.

Writing develops *because* of agriculture. There\'s a need to keep
records, and that leads to both math and to writing. We\'ve only got a
dozen examples to go by.... And they *all* follow the same pattern.

Agriculture allows more people. Which makes you *dependent* on
agriculture. This means you need to keep good track of the seasons so
as to know when to plant. That leads to math and astronomy.

You also need to store food (the whole *point* of developing
agriculture was that even though you become a virtual slave to the
fields, you also don\'t have to worry about how to make it through the
winter). So that leads to more math, and to writing so that you can
keep track of *who* owns which containers, and what\'s in them.

Next, you find that droughts and uuntimelty rains are a problem. This
means you invent irrigation. This requires group effort, and surveying
and construction skills. At first minor, but quickly increasing. The
Egyptians got lucky. The floods not only removed the need for more than
elementary irrigation, it also fertilized the ground, so they didn\'t
wear it out. Note that most of the birthplaces of civilization are now
deserts and dustbowls... there\'s a reason.

Anyway, the Egyptains got pushed into better math because the floods
meant they *had* to develop surveying to keep track of who own which
chunk of land. But even that made little difference in their development.

Getting back to the general case, soon you need *lots* of workers to
maintain the irrigation systems, and build dams. You also need to build
storehouses. Bricks and pottery *will* be invented now if they haven\'t
already been.

There are several examples of cultures that got this far and then fell
apart after things like a major dam breaking at the wrong time
(someplace in Mexico) or the rains shifted (the Anasazi in the
Southwest).

About this time you start needing folks specialized in running things.
So you get kings and taxes. And you also get temples to the gods as the
astronomers have turned into priests. This is where you also get big
cities and multi-city cultures.

Angkor Wat in SE Asia is an example of a culture that got to this stage
(kingdom, verging on empire) and then fell apart. I\'d have to dig up
the references, but I recall reading that they fell because either they
"wore out" the land, or their irrigation system caused the jungle to
take over.

Note that we are now down to the dozen or so examples I mentioned.
China, India, Babylon, Egypt, the Incas, the Maya, etc. We\'re up to the
Bronze age (mostly). The *cultures* are distinct, but the *technology*
is remarkably similar.

But once you get past the point of "warring kingdoms", too many wild
cards pop-up. Even so, it\'s still worth noting that it\'s likely that
there are still patterns, but we don\'t have enough examples to draw on.
(We quickly get down to "the West", India, and China).

> >>>Transporation: Horses with saddle and stirrups, ships.

I missed this earlier. Stirrups do *not* need metalworking. Because
they don\'t need to be metal, and in fact, I\'m moderately certain that
the first ones *weren\'t*.

Depends on what you mean by "writing". Besides, Even *paleolithic*
cultures are a lot more advanced than most folks think. The typical
picture of a "caveman" is pure BS.

Do you have any idea how *hard* it is to get across the idea of
something like this? Once you get them to grasp the idea, they may take
it and run with it. Or they may look at it and say, "Gee, that\'s
interesting, but not terribly useful".

Again, check out history. Ideas like the decimal system took a lot of
convincing to get people to use them.

They are an example of a people "stealing" a useful idea from as more
advanced culture. Which shows that tech transfer *does* happen. But
only the bits of tech that the low-tech folks can understand and that
they *want*.

Of course, the Americas are a bit of an interesting case because the
larger animals were killed off by humans *before* the idea of
domesticating animals got that far.

So it\'s possible to argue about whether or not they were "really" TL0
*after* they stole the horses. :-)

But to go back to those Plains Indians... They *didn\'t* steal writing.
Why? Because they had no *need* for it!

The Inca system is thought to not really be "writing". It\'s a sort of
memory aid thingy. More than numbers, but not quite up to being
writing.  We\'ll never *really* be sure, because the Spanish did such a
good job of killing off the folks who understood them.

If I was designing a system from scratch, it\'d have a lot more steps at
the *lower* TLs. But I rather suspect that the Empire just used them as
a quick way of determing what sort of stuff you should be allowed to
import. Read "King David\'s Spaceship" by Pournelle for a good example
of what you can get away with in such cases. :-)

And that depends on various factors. Take a look at the way computers
spread (and are still spreading). We had some folks who took to them
right off, just because they were "neat". That doesn\'t mean we were at
"the computer TL" then. It just means that it was possible (with
difficulty to get them). They were a *novelty*.

Next, we had some folks discover that they could use the computer to do
things more easily. But they still were hard to get. If we were getting
them from traders, they be an expensive import.

Next, we\'ve got them being used a lot (pretty much the current
situation). But lots of folks still don\'t see any need to know anything
about them, and others refuse to learn. At this point, a Traveller
culture might start building its own, rather than importing them. The
computer is now a useful tool.

The next stage will be when "everyone" knows about them, and they are
about as remarkable as a toaster or a radio. They\'ll be a commonplace.

Finally, we\'ll get to the point where they are completely taken for
granted. The difference between this step and the one before is that
at the previous step there\'ll still be a few "reactionaries" who think
computers are a bad idea. At this step they\'ll be *so* integrated into
society that such an argument would be the sort of thing that draws you
up short and make you wonder about the sanity of the guy.

I\'d say that if we have to specify a point at which a TL has taken
hold, it\'s either the "useful tool" or "commonplace" stage.

But even *those* require a certain level of pre-existing base
technology. You can\'t "randomly" invent something until all the

Actually, you *don\'t* need a microscope for germ theory. You just need
it to help *confirm* it. It was propsed *before* the microscope.

Us. The Greeks could *build* a turing machine if we told them how. But
they couldn\'t *use* it. To *use* one, you need a lot of math and logic
that they didn\'t have. Since they didn\'t have the *theory*, they
wouldn\'t have any *use* for it.

I think it\'s a combination. The metals might not have been up to it.
But the *machining* definitely wasn\'t!

Again, I suggest re-checking your history. It wasn\'t all that long
between when decent lenses started being produced and when the
telescope was invented. There\'s no "centuries" involved. *Maybe* a
decade or two.

I have heard this as a first-hand rumor, i.e., from the GDW staff when I
visited them a few years ago.  [I claim to be the first non-GDW employee to
get T:TNE, because I bought it from Dave Nilsen in person the day they were
packing the boxes for shipment to distributors.]  According to what I was
told, a large part of Marc Miller\'s thinking was financial -- he could do a
much better job sending his kids through college as an insurance salesman than
as a game designer.  He remained a major stockholder, though, and continued to
be a member of the board (at least at that time).

I am very encouraged so many people are jumping in to rescue Traveller.  I
wonder if Marc Miller (who is getting the rights back) and Steve Jackson (who
has the resources) would get together...

SJG wanted to do a GURPS:Traveller years ago (around when TNE came out) but
GDW wasn\'t interested.

Maybe.  I liked it, but was annoyed with it\'s lack of maps, language
generation, etc.  Please, next time, whoever-get\'s-Traveller please
consider the DGP Alien books as the *minimum* standard!

As a barely-revelant aside, I don\'t hate the New Era.  I like it\'s rules,
Brillant Lances, Battle Rider, etc.   The only real problem is background
- soon to be fixed, I suspect.

Marc Miller apparently want\'s to create a brand new ruleset for
Traveller.  Please, please convince him not to: Traveller already has
three set\'s of game rules, and yet another rule set (Traveller\'s
fourth) would only exhaust the patience and good will of Traveller fans
and the general public.

I liked it.  After Dave Nilsen said why he didn\'t want to include
maps, etc, I could see where he was coming from.  I don\'t know if I
agree with all of it.  But I think that you\'re right, the DGP Alien
books were the best alien sourcebooks that I\'ve seen for almost any
sci-fi rpg!

I just hope that it doesn\'t get dumped.  While I may not have

fact is that it happened.  Granted, in 1202 I\'m hiding out in The

is still some support for the TNE.

GDW is dead but it seems that this isn\'t true for Traveller. Already three
people wrote that they would be interested in the Traveller license. Even
more people wrote about their opinion about the future of Traveller or made
offers to help in keeping this game alive. I would like to comment on some
topics too.

I bought the German edition of Classic Traveller 1985 (year of publishing).
I liked the overall idea of Traveller but was disappointed by the game
system. Some test games ended very unsuccessfully. 1988 the German edition
was actual dead. Fanpro, the licensee, lost interest (probably) because
Battletech and shortly thereafter Shadowrun sold better. My interest was
vanishing too. During university, I subscribed the (old) TML from time to
time, reading its articles with great interest. Especially the period from
the first announcement upto the publication of TNE was a time of great ideas
and great emotions. I experimented with an own system based on Cthulhu
rules. 1993 I bought TNE, curious because of all discussions. From that
time, I gathered more and more Traveller stuff.

I like and hate Traveller the same time. The background, especially all the
old stuff, is great. It\'s good enough to overlook all this little annoying
quirks. I hate the change with MT and TNE to more combat and military
oriented campaigns and I hate the slighty destruction of the background.
Probably I\'m biased but I\'ve the feeling that most Americans are weapon-fans
and like to play wars. This alignment towards military is probably one
reason that Traveller doesn\'t sell well in Germany. Well. Moral? Back to the
roots!

I know GURPS and SJG very well. I don\'t like the GURPS rules but the world
and source books are great. I own most of them. I wouldn\'t favor GURPS
Traveller rules because that wouldn\'t be Traveller anymore. However, a new
edition of Traveller by SJG would be a good solution (IMHO). (The same would
be true for Space 1889.)

But would a reprint of the current rules enough? I don\'t think so. It\'s a
difficult matter. A lot of old fans were driven away because of GDWs drastic
background changes. Some of them already disliked Rebellion. But could you
really turn back the wheel of time? Make it a general system without
background or with different parallel background? Better not. Another dead
system is RuneQuest. But its world, Glorantha is kept alive buy its fans
because that\'s the uniting common denominator. GURPS has tons of backgrounds
and there\'re a lot of GURPS fans. But they\'re not the same "family" as
Glorantha fans - or Traveller fans - are.

Marc Miller took back Traveller and made some suggestion how to save
Traveller. Rewriting rules is a good point but trading cards and all that
other merchandising stuff might keep a company alive but IMHO it gives that
company a very bad reputation. Do only one thing, but do that good. Don\'t
try to cover every market you can think of.

Someone expressed the idea to publish a free set of rules over the net to
keep Traveller (or SF games in general) in the mind of the people. I like
that idea! However, we would need the permission by the owner of Traveller
or do something similar without violation copyright laws (and American
copyright laws are strange). I\'d have no problem with a new but similar
background - in fact, currently I use such a background for my own campaign.
But I see, that\'s not "Traveller."

There\'s one big disadvantage with a CDROM based Traveller rules book - you
can\'t read it everywhere, say, at rest room.  Collecting and rewriting all
information about Traveller is probably a year\'s work, or even more. I don\'t
think that\'s something we would need now. Again, you can\'t compare reading a
book with reading some online documents. The second is less desirable.

A nice idea, I would suggest, would be a (free?) computer RPG game that
could also be used to generate characters, world and starships for a normal
table-based game. A little bit like the old Traveller games by Paragon
Software. But don\'t try to hide the game behind great sound and graphics
effects! (Okay, Paragon didn\'t. Both graphics and game play wasn\'t better
than average.) And don\'t make it an action game. Even combat should be
tactical.  The game would be something like a tutorial for the future game
master and you could play it to learn the rules and the background.

If I had three wishes for a future edition of Traveller I would wish:

* Keep rules and character generation simple. (Simpler that TNE or MT)

I use currently a variant of the Forgotten Futures rules (a shareware RPG by
Marcus L. Rowland set in the future of 1900 scientific fantasy novels.  More
information at http://www.tierzucht.uni-kiel.de/~sma/forgottenfutures/)
because they are very similar to the classic Traveller rules but more
workable. Perhaps one could license these rules.  Combat in this rules is
very deadly. Most weapons have a good change to instant kill a character.
But I like it that way...

Give players more control at character generation. Use both a random and a
point-buy system. I would suggest to lower terms from 4 to 2 years. Don\'t
emphasize combat oriented occupations. Use about 60 skills as a maximum.
Don\'t distinguish PC and NPCs. Make PC as simple as NPCs. I made the
observation that the less numbers the player has for her character, the more
she thinks about the character and develops a better background and surrounding.

Provide a lot of archetypes (at least 4-6 pages) players could use for
character generation and inherit their character from and the master could
use for contacts and encounters.

* Simplify the vehicle construction rules. (Complexity as in Space 1889
would be fine)

The original starship generation system was IMHO sufficient. I\'ve three
expectations from that rules. Speed and endurance of the starship, crew and
maintenance costs, layout (deck plans) and form. Only the forth point is
costs (most ships the characters can\'t buy anyway). Combat values are nearly
unimportant for me.  Being able to construct other vehicles is cool but
starships are the most essential vehicles. I\'ve absolutely no need for
design rules for ammunition or weapons. If you would like to add some
"design rules," then add some for alien creatures! All construction rules
should be usable without a computer.

Starsystem and world construction rules are okay. However, Law Level should
be more than only a weapons restriction law. I would add 3 to Law Level in
non-frontier regions. I would add some modifiers to population based on
physical world datas. I would rework Tech Tevels.

* Put more importance on spacetravel! (Sometimes I want more rules, too :-)

Travel between the stars gave Traveller its name. However, the one week
j-space stay isn\'t detailed at all. First, I feel uncomfortable with that
length. I currently use a system where a jump lasts 69 (don\'t ask me how I
got that number :-) hours at minimum. The larger the ship volume, the longer
the jump field needs to fade away. An 100.000t ship needs about 150 hours.
Larger ships probably can\'t jump at all (at current TL which defines an
upper volume).

During the jump, a lot of things could happen. Detail the effects of jumps
and misjumps. Describe starship routine. Include rules for improvised or
tuned machines - somethink you\'ll probably find on any character\'s ship.

As an example, my ships have to include a special kind of super conductors
to establish the jump field. These conductors have to be distributed over
the surface of the ship. Of course, damage to the ship could also damage the
jump-field conductors so it\'s wise to have more than needed. If not, jump
calculation becomes more difficult and misjump probability raises. You have
to overload existing jump conductors. You can use a calculated jump window
1D6 minutes. After this time, you\'ve to recalculate, a process of hours,
depending on computer power. The jump field has to include the ship,
including propulsion mass. This makes simultaneous accelerating and jumping
more difficult. To establish the field the ship as to spend a lot of energy.
At lower TL, ships include capacitors to accumulate the needed energy. Half
of jump fuel will be used to generate the field, the other half is needed to
cool the jump drive, engines and converter.

Well, just to say it. All this concerns rules issues because I\'m content
with the overall background. I\'d wish a little bit more "sense of wonder" as
included in the old adventures and articles, however. This was lacking in
the recently published books.


Okay, enough said. This were my 2/100 units of local currency,

        I\'d like to add my _very_ strong vote to this. While I recognize
there may be a need to make some changes, I would strongly object to Yet
Another Rule Set (YARS). There may be minor tweaks needed, and I could live
with that. Being personally of an engineering-geek background, I\'ve been
following the GDW-Beta list discussions on Brilliant Lances/FF&S Done Right,
and some of that effort should probably be considered for general
integration, while other parts should probably remain "house rules."

        Since you asked for inputs, I intend to try to write a little more
when I have the time, but this message seemed perfect to piggyback off of.
Thanks!

Dear mr. Miller

Okay, here are some ideas that are only in my very humble opinion:

As someone mentioned, it\'d be a good idea to get Thomas Peters back with
Traveller, as he is a great artist and generally influenced the look of the
game in a way I like very much. I can only second that motion. Other great
artists is Michael Vilardi and Blair Reynolds. Rob Caswell also did great
technical drawings.

I don\'t know how many of the original DGP staff is left at that company, but
I think that they all did a great job with the game. Noone mentioned, noone
forgotten, but I think it\'d be a benefit for Traveller to get as many of them
back working on the game.

There has been much discussion wich way to take Traveller now - both
concerning rules and background. In my opinion, DGP did the best Traveller
materials ever with their MegaTraveller line - especially the Alien books,
the Starship Operator\'s Manual and World Builder\'s Handbook. I think it\'d
create great consistency to continue this line. By making new products
compatible with these old products, it would ensure great quality and
immediate playability. I\'d be overdelighted to see Zhodani & Droyne, Hivers &
K\'kree and Humans & Nonhumans published, as well as the advertised Robots &
Cyborgs, not to mention the Clones & Constructs sourcebook, which was only an
idea at the time DGP ended their MT support.

Of course this would probably mean a return to the MT rules and setting.
Personally I love this game beyond all, because it\'s the most technically
consistent game I\'ve ever seen. Granted, there are some wierd rules, but
overall, I love it. I even think the vehicle design rules are great, and it
is quite possible to design vehicles and ships without the use of a computer.

What is most important to me is something with a quality like the DGP alien
modules, preferably consistent with the high quality products (ie. DGP MT
stuff) already made.

Sincerely

Mark Seemann

I almost agree with you.  My take on this would be that if a new rules
system is created, have an appendix in the main rule book.  In the
appendix there would be rules for converting between the current
edition and any of the previous editions.  This would also allow
players to convert between MT and new version, TNE to MT, etc...  If
it is really expansive, then it could also include ways to convert
most vehicle stats (a quick fix), as well as include ways to convert
from other sci-fi games to/from Traveller.  The last idea I\'ve seen
done in such games as Nexus and Over The Edge.  Fantastic idea!  Allow
people to purchase the background source if that\'s all they\'re
interested in and let them use their current system (or find out how
much they\'re missing and convert to ours. 8)

But then again, I think that a GURPS Traveller sourcebook (in
addition to the Marc Miller stuff) wouldn\'t be a bad idea.

Yes, I\'m the poor man who asked Santa for a CD with all the Traveller
tidbits/background, finally collected in one place. (One reply actually
asked what \'colour is the sky in my little world!\' )

While we\'re waiting for Marc Miller, Steve Jackson and Rodge Sanger to
sort out who\'s doing what, here\'s my personal wish list for Traveller.

A: Big sourcebooks.

I mean, 400 pg\'s big.  So big, that it may be a good bit wiser to publish
this stuff in CD format than in book form.

[Aside: oddly, I feel that the Basic Rules should actually be kept
smallish, maybe 100 or so pages.  Cheap, excellent cover, nice rules,
starter pack of equipment, fine illustrations, and lot\'s of basic settings,
including Imperial Stars [the Third Imperium, 1115], Rebellion, and New Era.
Carefully checked for errors and ommissions :]

Now, back to the sourcebooks.  Personally, I have no problem with
non-Classic books being written (either by whoever get\'s Traveller, or -
even better - by licensed third parties): but what I really want is more
and deep background for the Imperium.

The one sourcebook that would be used by all will be FF&S II.  This item
should run about 400 pages, but I suspect can be sold at a nice profit
(even in book form, rather than CD) *if* it\'s both comprehensive (See
GURPS: Vechiles for what I mean by \'comprehensive\') *and* easy to use.
There should be both the old-fashioned, every-little-detail way of
building things  (to satisfy detail freaks like me) and a modular, quick and
dirty style.  The book *must* come with a disk, containing spreadsheets
for the every-little-detail style.

The other books I\'ll mention are all focused on the Imperial Stars campagin.
(yes, I\'m really, really into the Third Imperium, even more than the
Rebellion or the Regency)

I\'d like to finally have a single sourcebook for the Third Imperium, at
400 pages.  It should contain carefully thought out information on it\'s
cultures, it\'s government, it\'s megacorporations, it\'s history.  The book
should be stuffed with adventure hooks, all tending to draw in the
characters into the pulsing lifeblood of a massive interstellar culture.
Some examples...       - MoJ agents tracking down rumour\'s of a
                         conspiracy by Ilelish Navy officers, supposedly
                         planning to kill the Emperor.
                       - A Megacorp group trying to outfox and outthink
                         an established competitor, to dominate the
                         production of - oh, low-to-mid tech furniture - for
                         all of Core sector.
                       - Liege servants for the Duke of the Spinward
                         Marches, who is in heated competition with a
                         certain subsector Duke for the title of
                         Archduke of Deneb
                       - Deep undercover Imperial agents, trying to get a
                         major Aslan clan to end a long-standing (even
                         violent) conflict with an Imperial megacorporation
                       - A major Imperial Scout expedition into Hiver space,
                         attempting to finally catalogue all of the human
                         races in that area
                       - Liasion\'s to the Emperor (characters must all rank
                         at least Baron\'s or Marquis), trying to get the
                         Julian Protectorate to agree to joint naval
                         excersises on Vargr space

(Hey, we don\'t *all* have to be free traders, hmm?)

However, in order to get into these situations, you need basic
information about the parties involved.  That\'s what the Imperium
sourcebook is for.  Finally, odd but interesting tidbits (like, say,
"Knighthoods of the Imperium" or "Current wars within the Imperium"
covering all those multiworld/corporate \'little wars\' ) that cover
the cover the Imperium should be included here.

A major sourcebook for the Spinward Marches.  With massive background
material, and hooks similar to that above, but instead of promoting
Imperium-wide adventures, instead goes into the nit and gritty of sector
politics.  (Including, finally, an outline of the sector nobles, covering
all dukes and several of the more important marquis and counts (ie. the
Count of Trin, the Marquis of Efate)   Show what controversies rage in
the Marches, which noble houses are feuding, where are the cesspools and
where are the wealthy.  Also, a good outline of the economic structore
and prominant firms is desirable, as well as some basic macroeconomics.

[For example, I strongly feel that
         - overall, the Spinward Marches is among the poorer regions of
the Imperium (only The Empty Quarter, Verge, and the Glimmerdrift Reaches
is poorer)
         - Jewell, Regina and Aramis subsectors are dangerously
dependent on the heavy Imperial Navy presence economically, while the
rimward regions are too dependent on the resource economy.  This would
provide a certain boom-bust cycle in the Marches, which provide their
own problems, which provide both adventure hooks and an avenue to deeper
player involvement in Traveller.       ]

It goes without saying that UWP\'s, xboat routes, detailed descriptions
for the 10 most important worlds of the Marches, and a primer on how
Marchmen are viewed by the rest of the Imperium (and how the rest of the
Imperium is viewed by the Marchmaen) would be included.

Another desireable sourcebook is The Imperial Navy (for all those
military nuts out there).  Finally, BL/BR Stats for the most common naval
combatants of the Imperium - *and* for the major non-Imperial states like
the Solomani, the Zhodani, the Aslan, the Julian Protectorate, large
Vargr nations and rading packs, the K\'ree, and the Hivers.  A \'roll call\'
of major Naval battles and a comprehensive listing of all Imperial wars
until 1115 would be present.  Naval organization and operational
procedures, the \'feel\' of the navy, how nobles interact with the navy,
and plans for the future should be included.  A host of naval
adventures and \'set pieces\' for Battle Rider fights should be included.
Finally, an updated version of "Trillion Credit Squadron" should be
included, to enable us to fight bigtime wars in a sector-wide scale.

I always wanted a book on \'Personalities of the Imperium\'.  All the
Sector Dukes - with character descriptions - on up to the Emperor should
be included, as well as famous non-noble personalities (in Military,
Entertainment, Scientific and Political fields).  This should be a good
deal smaller, say 100 pages.  It may be produced strictly on CD.

"Atlas of Charted Space" is another work that should be kept on CD, as
demand is probably intense but not widespread.  Here, finally, full
names, UWP, xboat routes, bases, etc. of all of Charted Space will be
entered.  And not just this, but descriptions of the ten top worlds in
each of the c.60 sectors, and an overview of each sector should be
included.  A good search engine is a must: also desirable is a number of
brief essays on each and every interstellar government of over 5 worlds,
and a number of essays on Charted Space, from the prominance of humans to
the lack of exploration + settlement rimward of the Solomani Confederation.

Finally, I\'d enjoy a number of slimmer, 100-150 pg. sourcebooks.  The
range that these books could cover is huge, including aliens (one alien
per book, please!), handbooks ("The Naval Officer\'s Handbook" "The
Scout\'s Handbook" "The Marine\'s Handbook" "The Merchant\'s Handbook" "The
Free Trader\'s Handbook" "The Noble\'s Handbook" comes immediately to
mind) that cover useful information for their carrer\'s, varient universes
(The Immortal Nobility, Rebellion, Virus, First Imperium, the Young
Imperium, Ancients!, Lucan Victorious, Zhodane Forever! Conquest of the
Marches, Return of Grandfather, etc.), and all those other sectors (Core,
Empty Quarter, Solomani Rim, etc.)

Of course, all these items should have high-grade writing, fine
illustrations, striking, realistic oil-painting covers by A.C. Farley (who
did such good work in _Vilani & Vargr_ and _Rebellion Sourcebook_), etc.

anyone knows where to get the miniature ships and rule books

Yes, and those statements are fairly useless for determining what technology
can be implemented at any given tech level. In a universe wnere 95% or more
of all worlds have been _settled_, the mechanics of technological invention
is fairly irrelevant. As I\'ve stated several times, I\'m postulating that
the _knowledge_ is freely available. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE INVENTED (sorry
to shout, but I want to make sure it is noticed this time).

Could you give me a quote for that astonishing information? If you did have
a tribe living in an area where everybody could gather enough to live on in
a couple of hours, pretty soon the population would increase to the point
where this was no longer true. Then some or all of the tribe would have to
go farther afield to collect their vittles and it would take them a few
extra hours just to move out to collect and to return to the tribe. Pretty
soon there would be more people, and eventually they would have to spend
most of each day gathering. Surely the reason for migration (and we know
that there have been migrations all the way back the long years of human
pre-history) is to provide food for people who would otherwise starve.

>The introduction of of agriculture *reduces* free time,

That seems totally contra-intuitive. Why would anyone change from their
pleasant pastoral hunter/gather society where they only have to work a
few hours a day to the back-breaking day-long toil of agriculture?

>and you don\'t start getting it back until this century.

Now that is manifestly untrue. Throughout recorded history the percentage of
society that was needed for food production has steadily fallen as technology
improved (and vice versa).

>Writing develops *because* of agriculture. There\'s a need to keep records,
>and that leads to both math and to writing. We\'ve only got a dozen examples
>to go by.... And they *all* follow the same pattern.

Wrong tense, even if the rest is right. Writing _developed_. Here on Earth.
Possibly also on the other "home" planets. But not no the 95% of all planets
that were settled by spacefarers.

> Agriculture allows more people.

Wait a minute. If one man can gather/hunt enough to survive in two hours,
then he can gather/hunt enough for 5 people to survive in 10 hours. Thus
20% of the society can support the rest. In medieval economy it took 4
peasants (well, people living outside of cities) to support 1 non-peasant
(or city-dweller). Of course, he needs a lot more land to do it, but back
then he did have a lot more land. Your claim just dosen\'t make sense. I
must be missing some facts. Please provide them.

That\'s a poor help for developing the society and culture of Faisal/Querion

No, and I don\'t see what that has to do with the subject under discussion.

And that\'s exactly what I\'ve been arguing: They _might_. Because writing is
TL 0, so if the Referee has the local authorities on a TL 0 world whip out a
bit of papyrus and a _ghifel_ feather and issue the PCs with a pass that
must be kept at all time on pain of death, he can.

>Or they may look at it and say, "Gee, that\'s interesting, but not terribly

So they might. So the Referee is quite entitled to have the aforementioned
TL 0 society _not_ know about writing. Now what about TL 1 societies? Are
there any level 1 technologies that absolutely depends on writing in order
to function? At what point does the Referee _have_ to include writing as a
local accomplishment? _That\'s_ what interesting about tech levels in the
Traveller Universe. Not what some 5000 year old Terran society did or did
not have.

AH HA! That is just what I\'ve been arguing that TLs are. A measure of what
a society can do if they want to. As opposed to what they couldn\'t do even
if they wanted to, because they did not have the technological basis for
it.

>But only the bits of tech that the low-tech folks can understand and that
>they *want*.

As for the want, surely that is in the province of the Referee. If he says
that these people have kept the art of writing alive because they worship
The Bard of Avon (Never to be mentioned by his True Name on pain of...)
then who are we to say him nay?

>So it\'s possible to argue about whether or not they were "really" TL0

Only if you argue that domestication of horses isn\'t TL 0.

Again, so what? The Plains Indians didn\'t steal it. What has that got to do
with TL 0 societies in the year 1115 Imperial? The Plains Indian society has
been dust for 5000 years. Some Referee\'s players may be visiting the
Chaoseans tomorrow. It\'s wether _they_ retained it (or imported it) that\'s
interesting.

>The Inca system is thought to not really be "writing".

But you can imagine a writing system based on knots in strings, can\'t you?
I can.

Of course you can\'t. That\'s the whole basis of tech levels, IMO. When you
know what tech level a society is, you should know what parts/material it
can produce and that should tell you what inventions are possible and what
inventions are not. Those inventions that are possible (but not mandatory)
at TL X are, I submit, TL X inventions.

I didn\'t say anything about germ theory, I said germs. As far as I\'m

Speak for yourself.

The original poster said that the Greeks had the necessary math. Don\'t go
changing the assumptions on me, it ain\'t a nice way to argue. In any case,
it\'s irrelevant, since mathematics is also a TL 0 science. So the Chaoseans
_could_ have whatever mathematical knowledge they needed to run the thing.
Remember: _The knowledge is freely available_.

So machining is a technology. If it\'s higher than what the Greeks had then
steam engines isn\'t TL 0. QED. Dosen\'t affect my argument the slightest.

(and I hope he is reading our mail) has in mind.

The universe is big (understatement award possibility) and Traveller can
fit all of our needs, it has for almost 20 years now and with the care
and intelligence that has been demonstrated on the lists, it will do so
for another 20!

Let\'s keep it up Folks!

His question to Traveller fans is this:

What 20 printed materials (i.e. sourcebooks, adventures, modules,

-> Subject: The Future of New Rules


-> everyone will be happy. So my suggestion is
-> "Support Them All!"
I wholeheatedly agree with you! The only way i can see that most
players will be able to play the Traveller they want is byusing
(letting them use) the rules they prefer. I own all three systems and
it would rREALLY bother me, if i had to buy a new one AGAIN! Let
everybody use the rules they like, maybe publish a booklet converting
the data from system to system , but do not a new system!
As to the backgrounds, i feel, that MM has found the right way by
making the game multi-layered as to the backgrounds! The only way i
can see this really happening, though, is by officially supporting
only 2-3 backgrounds and leaving the rest to the various DM\'s,
allow publishing on the net on the other timelines. (Maybe publish
one booklet for each timeline to set the stage and leave them alone
from then on, letting the players and referees elaborate on the basic
material without the fear it will be superseded by new materials
later on!)
That was my 0.02 Cr, any comments?

I\'ve seen this as well. I *think* it was in the set of atlases Joseph
Campbell was publishing when he died. And it\'s not just theory: it has been
observed in New Guinea within your lifetime. (I\'ll check if the debate

Infant mortality in these societies is so high that life expectancy is only
20-30 years. (See
_The_Human_Species:_An_Introduction_to_Biological_Anthropology_, 2nd ed., by
John Relethford, p. 463. Surrounding pages have more info about disease in
h-g and ag societies.)

I think they generally move as they forage. And they operate in
astonishingly small bands.

You give us too much credit. Why do modern people join cults or go to grad
school? We\'re a stupid species.

Seriously, early ag societies were *not* a nice place to live. See
_Plagues_and_Peoples (can\'t recall author).

Uh, just to give my opinion, while I like some of these ideas,
I don\'t think going the AD&D route is that great an idea. I always
liked Traveller \'cause the sourcebooks were good and not just fluff
you didn\'t need but felt you had to buy just for completeness.

My suggestion would be to put all thoses career handbooks (Naval Officer,
Scouts, etc) together into one book maybe. A fleshed out version of
"Citizens"

Personally, I\'d love to see a bigger Zhodani sourcebook. Hell, I\'d
even write it. Gads they\'re cool.

Actually, *we* can\'t build a Turing machine, because it requires infinite

You\'d be surprized at how subtle some of the Greek math and logic was, and
how little we\'ve advanced in certain areas. (Again, look for a recent
Scientific American article on calculus, "infinitissimals", and the Greek
paradox of Achilles and the tortise.) Granted they didn\'t think of the
Turing machine and its applications, but I suspect they\'d have jumped right
on it if a Traveller dropped down and explained it to them. Probably quicker
than the Traveller would have learned Greek!

  The above information is true - gatherer/hunters have more leisure time
than people in agricultural societies.  Migration was driven by
population density, not food shortage - your assumption about people
gathering until population keeps growing leaves something out, namely the
ability to limit birth rates.  Most cultures do so - freely expanding
cultures with high birth rates are the exception, not the rule.

  Good question.  There are a number of theories.  The most popular
points to the rise of agricultural in the arid river valleys of the Nile
and the Tigrus-Euphrates.  Seasonal flooding makes irrigation and water
control central to raising yeilds, so is adopted.  Other cultures in
other climates do not adopt widespread agriculture - American Indians in
the American Northwest, for example, knew about intensive agriculture but
did not adopt it.

  My favorite theory about the origin of agriculture is that people
cultivated grain not for food but to make beer.  Agriculture had its
origins in provideing a consistant sourcee of intoxicants, and only later
was a way top produce food.

  Agriculture has two advantages - a more consistant, storable food
supply (especially with grains like rice or wheat), and the ability to
support roughly 100 times more people per square mile of land.  Problem
is that it takes far more work, and you can\'t go back once you\'ve
started, at least not without massive die-off (chat with the ancient
Mayas about that one).

  Sorry - until the mechanization of agriculture that begins in the 18th
century, most folks were farmers - productivity increased little.  And I
would hardly argue that workers in the 19th century in factories had lots
of leisure.

  You make the false assumption that the gatherer hunter wants to support
all those other people - he or she will limit population because leisure
has high marginal value.

  Again, agricultural societies support far higher densities, roughly
x100.  Is this good for the people involved?  For the most part, no.
Read Lewis Mumford on this (Technics and Civilization is a good place to
start) - he blames most of the problems in modern society on the
development of agriculture, and makes a very convincing case.

Comments from Hans Rancke-Madsen <rancke@diku.dk> marked with ">",
comments by Leonard Erickson with ">>"

I mostly agree with Hans\' thesis----TL progression will likely be
different in worlds that don\'t have to do the inventing themselves.
But I think Leonard\'s grasp of the history of development on Earth is
much more accurate than Hans.

I\'m not Leonard, but I\'ll try to answer anyways.

Hans obviously overlooked the part where Leonard mentioned that the big
advantage of agriculture was to store up food for the winter... so you
would survive it.

For a hunter/gather, during the spring, summer, and fall food is
plentiful and cheap and very little time is required to gather enough
to eat.

In the winter, very little food is available and people starve.

>>The introduction of of agriculture *reduces* free time,

Reduces free time drastically----but increases the stability of the food
supply with equal impressiveness.

>That seems totally contra-intuitive. Why would anyone change from their
>pleasant pastoral hunter/gather society where they only have to work a
>few hours a day to the back-breaking day-long toil of agriculture?

Leonard didn\'t say "pleasant".  He said "lots of free time."  Starving
isn\'t pleasant.

This also answers Hans\' question, "why wouldn\'t the population
explode?" question----the population is limited by the food available
during the winter.  Free time in the summer can\'t provide food in the
winter UNTIL you invent agriculture.

Once agriculture was invented, Hans picture is completely
right----population expands in a matter of a handful of decades until
every last minute is needed to make enough food to support the
population.  But you need agriculture to be able to use summer time to
provide winter food.

>Now that is manifestly untrue. Throughout recorded history the percentage of
>society that was needed for food production has steadily fallen as technology
>improved (and vice versa).

*Recorded* history.  Hans means, though he ignores the fact, that this
is after the invention of agriculture.  Think about it.  Leonard and
Hans agree here.

History started being recorded to make agriculture work better;
pre-agricultural hunter/gathers don\'t keep written records.

Leonard says it better than I:

>>Writing develops *because* of agriculture. There\'s a need to keep records,
>>and that leads to both math and to writing. We\'ve only got a dozen examples
>>to go by.... And they *all* follow the same pattern.

>> Agriculture allows more people.
>

True----but why would he?  What\'s in it for him?  Why should he work all
day, when two hours suffices?  For the money?  Hasn\'t been invented
yet.  For the luxuries of life?  What luxuries there are, he makes for
himself, in two hours a day.

The invention of the economy, even a barter economy, requires a little
bit of sophistication.  At hunter-gather level, two hours a day
suffices to buy everything!  Why work more?

I think it makes more sense to construct a rules-set with the following
ideas:
- Independence from any one universe.
- Backward compatibility with old rules.
- Detailed rules for things like Cyberpunk and Cloning.


Some examples of what I am talking about ...
Psionics are a rather rare thing in Traveller because the rules for
testing and acquisition of psionics are based on Imperial and planetary
local law.


Tech Levels
The highest tech level that any world can obtain without Imperial influence
is 8. By Imperial influence I mean a Starport or a military base. This
makes it impossible for worlds with even a low jump capability from
developing. However they have at least in the Imperial Universe
since we all of these aliens. I suggest that instead that there be some
kind of sentient population test roll.

Backward compatibility should exist because there\'s lots of good stuff in
Traveller. I have not read any of the stuff from TNE but if their character
generation system does not have a survival rule then that is an improvement.

Alot of the stuff put out by DGP is very good, such as their detailed world
manager. I have a feeling they could update those for a new set of rules
if they needed to.

As for cyberpunk. Cyberpunk has become part of Science Fiction genre now,it
wasn\'t when Traveller first came out. I think its time to add rules for
its mechanics and some chip building rules. Please don\'t add more
stuff about Imperial Law and uses of it.

Jo, what an absolutely, bloodly *MARVELOUS* suggestion.
The rules are already in place, as are the campaign backgrounds.
It should appeal to the broadest possible audience.  Bravo!!

The _economic_ reason for moving to agriculture is that a given area can
support more people, even though they all have to work harder.  So, your
society of hunter-gatherers (with some spare time) grows until they exceed
the capacity of the land.  At that point their only choice to to take up
agriculture (or starve, or move...).

Yes, this is a simplistic explanation.  I\'m afraid I don\'t have time to
repeat all the material in my sources.  Gregg in particular looks at the
interactions between the two types of society.  Flynn\'s article is a popular
summary of analytical geography, and well worth reading.  I\'ll try to post

I didn\'t post the original quote, nor can I cite the source, but I *can*
corroborate it. In my anthropology course last semester, we saw a film and
read a chapter (well, it was on the syllabus and I\'m sure the people who
paid attention in class did) about a tribe in the Kalahari that lives at a
primitive huinter/gatherer level.

A study was done comparing their claric intake vs. the time they spent
hunting, gathering, preparing food, and so on. It came out to about a 37 or
so hour work week - and they didn\'t seem to have the population problem
postulated in the remainder of your post.

>That seems totally contra-intuitive. Why would anyone change from their

Because it\'s about as *consistent* as life gets. I can settle ad not have
to worry about whether or not the herds and grasses will be plentiful. I
can settle down and have a more stable lifestyle. The hunter-gatherer may
be moderately more carefree at times, but he never knows just where the
next meal is coming from.

Right, but more and more labor gets shifted into other roles. Women
rejoiced at the advent of the washing machine until they realized it meant
they had *more clothes* to wash :) Modern telecommunications let us
communicate faster than ever before - but instead of maintaining the same
workload and having more leisure time, we communicate more and accomplish
more in the same amount of time. THat\'s progress :)

Not neccesarrily true. Besides, any excess means that those who are
supported can become specialists. If I don\'t have to worry about gathering
food, I can concentrate on something useful, like pottery, metalworking,
number-crunching, diplomacy, or even becoming a thespian :)

Besides which, the figure I was given for these tribesmen wasn\'t
significantly lower than our work week for self-sustenance.

In any case, that\'s it for me. I just thought I\'d say I heard about this
calorie-counting <40 hour work week idea from a fairly reliable source as
well!

ATTENTION DGP AND TRAVELLER FANS:


Concerning DGP & Traveller:

I\'ve  been inundated  by queries  from fans  of Traveller and DGP
about DGP\'s role in Marc Miller\'s forthcoming Traveller odyssey.

Here  are  the  most  frequently  asked  questions,  and the most
interesting ones, followed by my responses:

    Will DGP aquire Traveller?

        No,  that is  not our  intention. Marc  Miller is back in
        town,  and  we   wholeheartedly  support  his  direction,
        wherever he may lead us.

    Will  DGP  publish  the  main  line  of  Traveller in its new
    incarnation?

        No. We\'ve got  too many irons in the  fire (including our
        own brand new game system,  and other huge projects - see
        below) to take on the whole darn thing.

    Will DGP produce Traveller goodies like it used to?

        The  precise details  haven\'t  been  worked out  yet, but
        tentatively,  "yes".  (Please  see  my comments following
        this FAQ.)

    Will DGP start up the Travellers\' Digest again?

        Let  me answer  this question  with another  question: Is
        this something you really really want?

    Will DGP make its past publications available?

        We  are looking  into the  best ways  to do this. (Please
        let  us  know  how  you  want  them:  Fried,  poached, or
        scrambled?  See below.)

    Will DGP  complete its unfinished  Traveller projects of  the
    past?

        It is too early to say. We\'d like to, but this depends on
        many  factors, such  as how  well they  would fit in with
        Marc\'s agenda for Traveller, how much demand for each one
        there is from YOU, and so on. :)

    What were DGP\'s unfinished projects?

        The Black Duke
        The Omnesium Quest
        Grand Explorations
        Battles of the Rebellion (with Marc Miller)
        World Builder\'s on Computer
        Second Survey on Computer
        Robots & Cyborgs
        MegaTraveller Alien #3 - Zhodani & Droyne
        MegaTraveller Alien #4 - K\'kree and  Hivers
        MegaTraveller Alien #5 - Humans and Nonhumans

        These  are  all  in  various  stages  of completion. Some
        barely entered the discussion stage, while others made it
        well into the writing stage.

    Will DGP make its library of Traveller publications available
    on CD-ROM?

        We\'re working on it. (See below)

    Will DGP ever finish A.I. (tm)?

        Hey, that\'s not a  Traveller-related question! Okay, I\'ll
        answer it  anyways. Yes, we  are working on  it. In fact,
        the  A.I.  (tm)  design   team  is  currently  recruiting
        kibitzers.


WHAT\'S NEXT?
----

BEFORE DGP can go into production of new material, we need to see
which way Marc Miller moves, and whether he decides that the next
step must be Traveller 4, or  whether he decides to retrench with
Classic Traveller, or Mega, or New Era.

In the meantime, DGP is limited in what we can develop and offer,
but  there may  be a  few  things  we can  put together,  without
conflicting with Mr. Miller\'s future designs.

Here are some ideas for  convenient gaming resources which DGP is
mulling over.  Please let me know  which of these you  would most
likely purchase if DGP made them available (in book form):

    THE GRAND TOUR -- All 21  episodes of the epic adventure from
    the  Travellers\'  Digest  Magazine,  compiled  into one book,
    complete   with  support   material,  and   of  course   with
    embellishments and enhancements.

    ADVENTURE  RESOURCE  --  All  other  adventures and scenarios
    published by DGP from its various publications and magazines,
    with relevant support material.

    TECHNOLOGY &  EQUIPMENT -- All  medical essays, technological
    essays, and  equipment descriptions, compiled  into one book,
    gathered  from  issues  of  Travellers\'  Digest Magazine, the
    MegaTraveller  Journal, and  from all  of DGP\'s  supplements,
    sourcebooks, and adventures.

    CAMPAIGN  RESOURCE --  A potpouri  of sociological  essays on
    Traveller cultures  and lifestyle, aliens,  history, regions,
    governments, agencies, Rebellion Factions, rules suggestions,
    and more. Arranged for easy reference.

If response is great enough, we\'ll submit a proposal to Marc.

;)


CD-ROM\'s and Such
----

We at DGP were delighted when  Marc expressed his desire to see a
Traveller  CD-ROM  created  --  We\'ve  been  wanting to put DGP\'s
entire archive of Traveller publications on CD-ROM for quite some
time  but decided  to hold  off on  development until the climate
surrounding Traveller changed. It finally has.

So, we\'ve started work on gathering, recompiling, converting, and
reformatting our  computer file versions  into some semblance  of
order, to  someday be placed on  one nifty disk for  your viewing
pleasure.

:)

This  will certainly  be a  long and  arduous project, which will
likely take us months to complete.

We\'ll need all the help we can get!

If you think  you can assist us with this  project, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Roger Sanger

Subj:No New Rules!

Marc Miller apparently want\'s to create a brand new ruleset for
Traveller.  Please, please convince him not to: Traveller already has
three set\'s of game rules, and yet another rule set (Traveller\'s
fourth) would only exhaust the patience and good will of Traveller fans
and the general public.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TNE pretty much exhausted what little patience I had left after MT.

I think MM\'s idea to go back to an enhanceed Classic Trav. system
is the best thing I\'ve heard in a *long* time.

Some folks are discussing the way things get invented. The above

Check out real Neolithic cultures like the Polynesians. They had
controls in place to limit population by *custom*.

Also note the phrase *hunter*. It takes a certain number of people to
run a successful hunt against most larger critters. So unless the tribe
*splits*, anybody who leaves won\'t have enough folks to get everything
done.

To avoid the unpleasant portions of said society. Things like starving
if they overhunt the herds. It may be *harder* to do large scale
farming, but the food supply is steadier.

But I\'m referring to the *amount of time* one has to spend each day
working to either raise food, or do the job that gets you your food.
That jumps *way* up when you start large scale farming, and slowly
decrases from there until quite recently (last century or so), when it
starts dropping rapidly.

Except for one minor detail. Namely, the "Why should I?" factor. What
incentive is there for those people to spend all day hunting for
someone else? There\'s evidence it did happen to *some* extent. But only
for the craftsmen types. If Joe is really good at chipping flint, it
makes more sense to let him do that and give him a share of the hunt.

But the number of people *needed* for such tasks is limited. So the
number that the rest of the group are willing to support is limited.

Agriculture allows higher population densities, not necessarily higher

Simple. Unless they can *see* a use for most math, they won\'t go to the
trouble of learning it. Please note how few folks *bothered* to learn
to read, write, or do arithnmetic until it was *required*. They figured
they had better things to do with their time.

So as I keep pointing out, lower tech societies are quite likely to not
be *interested* in upgrading their tech level.

More likely they\'ll be issued a clay tablet stamped with a special
"seal", or some oddly carved token. That is the sort of thing that
would *already* be in use at low tech levels.

A planet that had been settled and "backslid" would be more likely to
keep odd bits of high tech. A planet that had been *contacted*
wouldn\'t.

I don\'t have a tech level chart handy, so I can\'t say for sure. But
*record keeping* becomes necessary as soon as you go from individual
plots to "mass agriculture". And record keeping requires both
arithmetic, and at least written *symbols* for things if not actual
writting. Egyptian heiroglyphics are not all that far above that level.

Sureveying starts at that level or a bit above, as does the start of
civil engineering.

Well, any "natives aren\'t all that likely to pick up the idea of riding
animals from Imperial contacts, because the Imperials won\'t be riding
animals, they\'ll be riding air-rafts.

I *really* don\'t think that it\'s all that likely that planets with tech
levels *that* low are populated by folks who were formerly at a high
tech level and lost it. Much more likely is that they came up from
their own stone age, on their own until contact.

Fallen civilations and "new" civilizations have very little in common.
But "fallen" ones should be rare unless you go along with Hard Times and
the Virus.

Retained is possible, Importing it is unlikely, as they don\'t have any
*need* for it. In fact, they are quite likely to hold the Imperials in
contempt for needing to write things down to remember them.

True enough. But there\'s a *lot* of spread between when something
becomes *possible* and when it happens. And quite often, the difference
is "theory".

The materials and skills required to create a working radio transmitter
are available clear back in *Roman* times, if not earlier. But there\'s
*no* way anybody at that tech level would invent one randomly, because
even if they built it, they wouldn\'t know what it was good for.

But *discovering* germs doesn\'t get you anything. Realizing that there
is *something* that causes diseases and is spread by contact or close
approach, and can be kept from spreading by keeping things clean is far
more important, whether you call the vector "germs" or "evil spirits".

It\'s not what the vector is that\'s the important point, it\'s the idea
that there *are* vectors.

I disagree with the original poster. The Greeks had the technical
skills. They did not have the math. You need more than the types of
logic known at the time to be able to *program* a Turing machine.
Programming *uses* logic, but it is *not* logic.

And again, I don\'t think the Greeks would have seen much *point* in a
Turing machine.

Well, consider that the telescope was *reported* to Galileo in the
1500s. And that in the 1400s, Bacon *didn\'t* know about using lenses to
magnify things, though he does note that a *globe* of water can magnify
and focus light somewhat.

That doesn\'t leave much room for "centuries" :-)

Because agriculture produces a more consistent and predictable return than
does hunting/gathering, and allows you to stay in one place and develop
infrastructure instead of constantly migrating to keep food supplies
available.  It\'s a sure thing rather than a roll of the dice.  Can you
imagine how appealing a field full of grain, ready for the taking, is
to a hunter-gatherer?  Would you work to create that?

He\'s speaking of free time, not the percentage of total labor needed for
food-production.  It\'s true that technology has reduced the number of
farmers necessary to support a population: but many of the other people
have then become needed as the blacksmiths, animal-handlers, etc. to
enable that increased productivity.  The increased efficiency comes at
the price of requiring extensive non-farming work to support it.

Despite the drive-weapon uses mentioned in the first ed. of HG,
I\'m pretty sure the subsequent "pedigree" of thruster plates is as follows:

Originally, CT didn\'t specify what M-drives were, but they were clearly
reactionless drives. They worked as long as the power plant was
running, and had no fuel requirements of their own.

Later came the K\'kree book:
_Aliens Book 2: K\'Kree_ illustrated Centaur conservativism partly by
the fact that they didn\'t engage in space flight until they detected
a carnivourous race on their moon/sister planet. To quote:

    "Unlike most spacefaring races, the K\'kree never went
     through a phase of primitive rocketry; their first
     interplanetary craft were fully developed grav-drive
     ships basically identical to those still in use today."


When DGP was designing MegaTraveller, they merged the starship
design sequence into the general vehicle design sequence from
the original _Striker_. To distinguish between the sort of grav-drive
used by a starship from that used by an air/raft, they used
anti-grav modules (that dropped off in efficiency away from
an existing gravity well) for grav-vehicles and thruster modules
(which maintained constant thrust regardless of outside environment)
for M-drives. Starships, of course, could use anti-grav modules,
but would be hampered in their maneuvering unless they were
close to a world.

The "plates" of thruster plates came into being to explain why
ships with reactionless thrusters always had glowing external
engines: they _weren\'t_ exhaust chambers, they were heat
radiators (yeah! that\'s it! radiators! hem, haw, errummahh).

I\'ve read your question Kerry Harrison posted to the XBOAT mailing list in
which you asked for the readers opinion about the future Traveller products.
Here you are.

I would like to see new rules. I think, this a good opportunity.  I don\'t
care incompatibilities between the rules systems. I also don\'t care some
changes to technology and background if that fixes some of the most awful
quirks of Traveller. I think, it\'s more important to attract new customers
than the fulfill every wish of the Traveller-diehards.

Generalize the rules that they could be used with nearly any background. Add
alternative technology to be able to model Startrek or Babylon5-like
settings, but stay with the Imperium (about 1100) as default background that
is used throughout the rules as example. I think, this could increase
interest in Traveller as generic SF system.

Change Traveller\'s technology. Increase the importance of computers. Allow
AIs at for example TL 13. Don\'t introduce all space traveling technology at
TL9. I would suggest to introduce fusion power at TL9 but Jump Drives and
artificial gravitation at TL10 (Jump X at TL9+X). I don\'t like the static
one week jump duration. I like the idea that travel time is independent of
distance but I\'d use a system that let small ships (100t displacement) jump
in (for example) 69 hours and larger ships in more hours because the time
needed to fade away the jump field is related to volume. This would make
small ships faster and jump travel (IMHO) more interesting.

Don\'t use and overall TL but subdivide TL in transportation, power,
communication, medical, warfare, and so one. The TL in basic world design
might be an average value but more details world description should details
areas of lower or higher tech.


Book 1: Characters and Basic Rules

This book shall contain a brief introduction to role playing and the
Traveller universe as used as example background. Start with character
generation rules. I would like a fast a simple system as used in classic
Traveller. Use both an archetype and a die-rolling system. In my opinion,
about 60 skills is the upper limit, TNE has too much skills. Change the four
year terms to two year terms. Don\'t overemphasize combat and combat related
skills. For characteristic, use "a character with Strength 6 (12) is about
twice (three times) as strong as one with Strength 1" as rule of thumb, not
six or twelve times as strong. Don\'t use a proportional scheme. Don\'t tie
the number of skill to education. I use a scheme of no, basic, medium and
high education to allow learning special skills without malus. Medium
education allows most technical skills, high education is needed for
medicine and other science skills. No education only allows the most
primitive skills as melee combat, swimming and so one. All characters start
with basic education.

Character example: Dr. Christoph Crasemann, Age 27, Archeologist, 746869,
four terms university, one term occupation (archeologist), High Education,
No PSI, Bribery-1, Computer-3, Scouting-1, Driving (Ground Vehicle)-1,
History (Ancients, Darrians)-3, Communication-0, Slug Weapon-0, Space
Suit-1, Languages (Darrians)-2, Science (Archeology)-4.

It\'s my observation, that players will add more description and "life" to a
character with less "numbers." So keep character data to an absolute
minimum. This also allows to use the same rules for characters and non
player characters. (Don\'t use the two classes system of TNE.) Back to the
book. Next chapters would be skill system, combat, experience, environmental
rules (from falling damage, suffocation in vacuum to poison effects) and
equipment.

If you want to use a 2d6 system for the rules (which I would prefer), you
might look at the Forgotten Futures rules. FF is a shareware game, a bit
similar to Space 1889, by Marcus L. Rowland. (You could find the rules for
example at http://www.tierzucht.uni-kiel.de/~sma/forgottenfutures/.) Marcus\'
system is quite similar to the classic Traveller system but IMHO more
playable (hope you don\'t mind this :-)

Combat should be fast and deadly. Quite different to TNE! With FF rules,
most slug weapons are deadly. One good shoot and you\'re dead. That\'s more I
like it. I don\'t no your opinion about this, but I don\'t want Traveller as
military simulation but as role playing game with emphasize on exploration,
mystery (sense of wonder), communication and investigation. The rules
shouldn\'t offer combat as most successfully option for solving problems. The
equipment list should be generic. I don\'t need a dozen slightly different
guns, just state that most guns\' damage range between X and Y and that (for
example) von Neumann Waffentechnik megacorp offers the broadest collection
of deadly weapons.

An appendix should cover a subsector and detail one world together with a
short adventure.


Book 2: World Design

This book shall cover all aspects of world design. Starting this the classic
rules to roll up systems and planets to the more detailed rules of the World
Tamer\'s Guide. Additional I\'d wish better rules for different societies,
minor alien races and creatures. Please supply random tables because it\'s
easier to role something up and become inspired by the result (that you than
probably change anyhow) than to image and construct from scratch. Add animal
combat. Add rules for wormholes or pocket universes.

Please consider depending population on physical world data in the basic
world design and make Law Level more than a weapon control rating. For
non-frontier region, I would suggest to apply a malus to Law Level because I
(and hopefully also other people) believe in civilized private people don\'t
need weapons.

An appendix should details some ideas for colonization or exploration of a
new world.


Book 3: Starship Design and Operation

This book shall contain a simple and fast design system for star ships,
space ships and(!) space stations. I\'m not primary interesting in costs or
combat ratings but in size, form, deckplans, maintenance costs and crew
requirements. This book should detail all aspects of ship operations, space
travel and board routine. It shall also include zero-G operations like
repairs or space walks. Add a tactical star ship combat system which is
usable during role playing that means that give importance to character
actions.

I would like to be able to design ships without the help of a computer.
Detail level as for example in Space 1889 would probably be sufficient.
Choose hull size and form. Choose jump drive. Calculate jump fuel space.
Choose converter, power plant and maneuver drives. Calculate maneuver and
engine fuel. Add computers. Determine cargo space and living area. Calculate
crew. Add life support, cabins, bridge. Choose weapon system, ship boats and
additional systems.

Related to star ships are space stations and space ports. Add some rules to
detail and/or construct them. I always missed this in Traveller. Add it.
(Far Away#1 contains a useful article about this.)

As with the other books, add an appendix with some adventure ideas (lost in
space because of misjump, strange signals from within an asteroids belt, the
used ship parts auction, and so one)


Book 4: Imperial Sourcebook - Spinwards Marches

Draw from all the published material and do a fresh look to the (IMHO) most
interesting part of the Traveller background. Don\'t be afraid to change some
world characteristics, the (odd) 100t xboat-system or other parts of the
former games. Bring back some sense of wonder to the setting. TNE was
lacking this. The TNE settings weren\'t different from today settings.

This book shall contain two or three longer adventures.


Book 5-9: Alien Books for Aslan, Zhodani, Vargr, Droyne, Solomani.

Rules and additions for the most important Traveller alien races together
with their history, culture, believe, and so one. Add an adventure. I think,
it would be difficult to outdo the DGP alien books. Add typical equipment
and vehicles.


Book 10: Vehicle Construction

As Fire, Fusion and Steel (or even better GURPS Vehicles) provide some
simple rules to design all kinds of vehicles. I doesn\'t bother weapon or
especially ammunition design. Especially not about 60 pages as in FF&S. Even
if not total related to the title, add more equipment as communication
devices, protection equipment, medical drugs and devices, and so one.

An appendix, you\'ll probably guess, should give you some praxis with newly
design vehicles. An adventure.


Book 11: Strategic Wargame

Use an even simpler system to rate ships (and other combat vehicles) for
strategical combat. This product hasn\'t be direct related to roleplay but to
help image the Traveller warfare. It might be fun to play interstellar wars
or even relive prominent Imperial wars.

The appendix contains some scenarios as for example some fights of the Aslan
border war or the 5th frontier war. Of course, this book should include the
ships of all major alien races.


Book 12: Reformation Coalition

Start to support different backgrounds. Great parts of Path of Tears are
very well written. To accept this setting you\'ve to accept the virus
concept, although. The sandman-adventure of the Vampire Sourcebook has very
interesting opportunities. However, I always feel that most of the RC
setting was done that way to give nice opportunities for all kinds of combat.

Even more books could handle other settings, more equipment, worlds, and so
one. Together with this books, a series of adventures should be published.
(I would prefer something like the old classic Traveller adventure booklet
instead of Smash-and-Grab-like mission or most of the recent Challenge
adventures.)

Well, I hope this will help you in keeping the idea of Traveller alive,

    'body' => 'What\'s Wrong with Traveller

There\'s been a lot of discussions as to a "wish list" of options now that
GDW has gone (or is almost so) down the gurgler re the development of
Traveller, so I\'ll put in my 2 cents worth ... heresy though they may be!
My attitude is that, basically, when it came out in 1977 it was, purely
by dint of being the only SF RPG available, the best ... but that *that*
fact is all that it had going for it *at the time*. Since then, very little
has changed as far as the *game system* is concerned ... but the *background*
is the thing that makes it unique and worthwhile, nothing else.

So, what\'s wrong with it? Some of the things that *really* stick in my
craw are --

1) The absolutely, completely, *inexcusibly* unworkable Technology Level
system. Sorry guys, I\'ve followed the various arguments herein and I just
cannot accept that the system *as it exists* is worth a bent penny. Why?
Well, the areas that have been graced with TLs in the various iterations of
the TL charts make no sense.

For example, there is effectively *no difference at all* between the tech
needed to produce a TL/4 Cartridge Ammo weapon, a TL/5 Shotgun, a TL/6 Auto
Weapon-SMG-Autopistol, a TL/7 Grenade Launcher and, as far as the mechanical
components are concerned, a TL/10 Advanced Combat Rifle. Sorry, just makes
no sense.

Similarly, there is no real difference between the tech needed to produce
TL/3 Telegraph, TL/4 Telephone and TL/5 Radio & Radar, and TL/6 Television.

Environmental tech is also dubious. Cement structures not possible till  the
invention of Rifled Firearms ... tell it to the Romans! Cities in Rugged/
Desert (TL4), wellm I suppose it depends on what you mean by "cities", and\'what
you mean by "desert", but there are many old civilisations that managed large
cities (for the day) in desert areas, built around oases or other water
sources that had to be husbanded carefully. Ditto "cities" in "jungles".

Then look at those Tech levels that *arent* tech levels. Primiitive Fusion
Plants (TL9) through to Fusion Plants/80 liter minimum (TL16) are no more
deserving of separate TLs than TL4 Steam Engines and TL5 IC engines. If Fusion
engines are given 8 TLs, then Steam/IC engines are at least deserving of
several more "TLs" than they actually get.

I mean, for ghu\'s sake, "Mobile Worlds/Sublight" (TL20) is only one TL, and
one TL below "Mobile Worlds/Jumpspace"!!! Get a sense of proportion here!!!

The whole problem is in the areas that Tech is rated in, you can\'t rate Tech
by a what Terra has (or may in the future) do. Tech is not about inventions,
it\'s about *capabilities*.

More realistic tech areas would be -- Mechanical, Materials, Electrical,
Electronic, Computing, Biomedical, and Energy Generation.

And, at least as important as the above -- *Production* technology.

This brings us to the second major gripe --

2) The cost of items is ridiculous. TL/12 Air/Rafts cost more than TL/15
Air/Rafts. Just like a Model T in 1927 cost more than a Model T in 1917
(it didn\'t, of course, in neither absolute nor in relative terms). Tech
gets *less* costly as it matures -- relative to the wages of the people
producing it *and* in absolute terms. Ergo, TL12 Air/Rafts should cost
*less* than TL15 Air/Rafts -- a whole hell of a lot less! Or, perhaps (if
you want to get pedantic) TL15 *versions* of TL12 Air Rafts should cost
a whole hell of a lot less!

Part of the problem is that it is a game mechanic -- in the early days the
creators did not want PCs to get such useful items too cheaply (not that
ATVs were all that much more realistic an alternative, pricewise). But it
makes no sense, it\'s like Longbows being more expensive than swords in D&D.
No justification at all *in reality*.

The other part of the problem is, how do you relate 1 Cr of currency between
a TL12 (or any other TL) planet and a TL15 (say) planet. There is *no* easy
way of doing so. Think of it this way, you can live *very* cheaply on US$
in (say) China ... but not at US tech! If you want to live a US lifestyle *in*
China, you probably have to pay a premium *in some areas*. The reverse is also
true, a Chinese could not realistically expect to live *any* sort of life in
the US on Chinese yuan (or, to be more accurate, on a normal Chinese salary
*converted* to US$).

Not an easy problem to solve -- only TNE has come up with any sort of rule for
it all all, and there they assume that a TL12-TL15 character can save no more
than 5000 Cr per 4 year term. And that\'s cash *and* equipment. I would say
that there is no reason why any reasonable person could not save 20% of their
salaray per year ... ergo, 5000 Cr is 20% of 4 years salary, and this means
that they are earning 6250 Cr per annum! Compare this to the price of things
and see how ridiculous it is.

This problem with economics makes all the costings in FF&S *extremely*
suspect at the very least ... and that\'s just a small part of the whole
problem area!

3) Costs & Production: Think about it, we\'re talking about c5500 AD, right?
OK, there have been some "dark age" interludes (where some planets at least
kept space and starflight, so they didn\'t get knocked all the way back).
Yet it takes 12 months to produce a 100 ton Star/Spaceship! 9 months if its
a Scout/Courier, because they\'re so common. Hm, we can, *right now* produce
a Boeing 747 in, what, a day or so when the production line is fully geared
up? A 747 weighs around 170 tons *unloaded*.

Why so long? Sure, there are anti-Robot sentiments in the Imperium and the
Solomani Sphere, but surely we are looking at factories where things are
automated so much more than they are today. Thus, there seems no reason why
such a small vessel would take so long to produce. Sure, there may be
delays for the shipyard to work you into their schedule, but the actual
production time would be a few weeks at most (and that only for such relatively
nonstandard parts as the JDrives, *if anything at all*). Even the delays to
get into the waiting list would be minimal, especially for something like the
Scout/Courier which is in constant demand ... ditto the Far Trader/Fat Trade
and Subsidised Merchant.

For ghu\'s sake, we did better than this with Liberty/Victory ships in WW2, and
very well even with Warships! With automation that will exist at TL/15 we
cannot assume that there will be no improvements at all!

This automation of production has interesting implications for all prices in
the book as well. The effects of automation have been to increase overall
productivity and simultaneously decrease costs ... living standards (wages
and the like) rise ... yet the Imperium is strangely impoverished. Sort of
like a 5600 AD Stalinist Command Economy! (maybe that\'s the answer - the
Vilani dominated imperium like it that way!) Costs of items do not reflect
this factor at all in any way. A major flaw. The Imperium is obviously the
57th Century version of a handcraft and cottage industry level economy!

4) The Ship design rules, and FF&S in general, stink. I do *not* want to be
in the position where you need a spreadsheet and hours of complicated
tradeoffs as a requirement to be able to design a starship ... or anything
else, for that matter. High Guard was good enough for me and, I suspect,
for all the players that GDW must have lost over the years, as I presume
that if Traveller was still a major money-spinner that Chadwick and his
partner would not be winding up the company!

I (and *all* the members of the gaming groups that I have belonged to over
the years) thought that Megatraveller (and, now, FF&S) ship design rules
are an unmitigated disaster. Most simply refuse to acknowledge their existence
*at all* and use High Guard (or bootlegged copies thereof) ... though they
might use some of the stuff from MTrav to tweak High Guard designs a little
bit in a handful of cases. I mean, it stands to reason, if Traveller was
such a resounding success with MTRav and TNE design rules, they\'d still
be in business!

As for FF&S in general. Crap. Heresy! The system may well enable you to
design something similar to modern tech items, but the high tech stuff shows
no imagination at all. There\'s a lot of self-congratulatory rubbish about
how all the tech items make sense because they had to work that way, and
how certain technologies that are standard fare for SF are not allowed
because they aren\'t hard science. What rubbish. Look at predictions and
Science in the last hundred or so year ... for more than a decade or so
(at most) in the future they are not reliable at all. No Thruster Plate
tech in FF&S because it violates the Law of Conservation of Momentum! Well,
sure, it violates 20th century *understanding* of the physical universe, but
does that mean that 57th century understanding of the physical universe will
not have found out that ours is flawed and incomplete? Would Copernicus have
accepted Einstein any more easily than he was accepted by those who thought
his world view crazy heresy? Can we be certain that Einstein will not be
regarded as simple-minded and incomplete in 100 years, let alone 3000 odd?

The answer is, quite obviously, *no*. I would suggest that it is inherently
impossible to have a system such as FF&S that can really be regarded as
acceptable ... it will always have to be redesigned every five or ten years
to keep it "advanced". I mean, look at GDW\'s original Advanced Combat Rifle
of 1977 ... pretty much like the H&K G-11; now they are calling ETC ammo
"state of the art", and it probably won\'t ever get off the ground any more
than the turretless tanks in TW:2000 did. Nope, design systems for space
and starships are about as much as you can reasonably hope to do, and only
on the level of High Guard. For the rest, well, my WAG designs are just as
likely to be "realistic" as any that FF&S can come up with!

5) Megatraveller: Task Resolution -- I am surprised that there is *anyone*
out there who thinks that the Task Resolution system of MTrav was anything
but a complete waste of space. Never used it, don\'t know anyone who did (or,
if they did, who did for very long), longwinded, overly complex, and generally
unuseable. Even Classic Trav was better.

As for TNE, the main problem is that it is TW:2000 in alll ways. Now, don\'t
get me wrong, I think that TW:2000 is a neat little system, but it should
have been presented with the *roleplaying* elements to the fore in TNE. I
suspect that one of the reasons that TNE hasn\'t succeeded is because it
forces people to play a combat wargame version of an RPG ... and most people
are attracted to Traveller because of the richness of its roleplaying
background. You only have to look at the Space Vikings and Regency Material
published to date ... heavy on the firepower and military action. Even MTrav
and the Civil War didn\'t do that.

Well, there\'s a lot more, but that\'s all for now.

You would need to use a lot of bandwith for a full listing.  That has been

different studies of Amazonian, African, and Melanesian tribes (New Guinea,
Philippines) that I know of.

Well, no.  There are a number of factors that tend to keep their population
down,
including a higher than standard death rate, and often a knowledge that too
many folks eat too much.  So they hold their population down by a number of
social strictures.

Often, when they hit this stage, a tribe breaks up.  Or, if limited in range by
surrounding tribes, it cuts back on its numbers (see above) or tries to take
more turf from a surrounding tribe.

Consistency of food source, of course!  Hunting/gathering goes in cycles of
feast and famine - and sometimes for completely unrelated reasons fails
altogether.  Agriculture provided a consistent means of providing food,
especially in temperate climates where winter rather limited the available
food sources.  It comes at a price - you cannot move the growing crops, and
once harvested, you cannot easily move the collected crops.  Not all societies
wanted this limitation.

>>and you don\'t start getting it back until this century.

>Now that is manifestly untrue. Throughout recorded history the percentage of
>society that was needed for food production has steadily fallen as technology
>improved (and vice versa).

Sadly, its not quite true.  While the number of people manufacturing food has
shrunk, the bulk of the surplus (non-food producing) population has gone to
produce other goods and services to exchange for food grown by someone
else: factory workers (and there were cloth factories going back to the middle
ages and probably earlier), sailors, muleteers, soldiers, merchants, craftsmen -
none of whom had huge amounts of leisure time (at least here in the west and
over most of the orient).

jungle world or other type of ecosystem could provide food for lots of
people without ever needing the \'stability\' of agriculture.

Oh, I don\'t have sources on hand here, but the assumption that early
agricultural societies were nice places to be are false.  More work, less
protein, at least in the early days. Archeological records show that the
non-farmers in the highlands and mountains around the mesopotamian region
were were most likely bigger, stronger, and more agressive than their
farming cousins.  Early agricultural societies saw diesase run rampant
(something like the Plague probably wouldn\'t happen in a hunter/gathering
society, population is less dense) do to crowding and lack of sanitation.

Slavery of all sorts was probably not very common until people realized
that they needed lots of arms to till the soil.

The above being said, a race that never needs or wants to move past
hunting/gathering will probably not develop starfaring technology
either.  It is hard to say, with all of our points of view being
huamcentric by definition.

If it\'s cool with MM, I think it would be a great idea to get old stuff from
DGP (published & unpublished) out on the market.  Then it would feel like
TRAVELLER had actually been brought back to life, rather than the snail-like
pace of materials for the latest revision.  As for what should be published
(in order of preference):

        1)ALIENS, ALIENS, ALIENS!--They were always the game\'s strong point,
but that will be difficult to know if the stuff is out of print or it takes
six years to become available!

        2)Technology & Equipment--I always liked these bits in DGP
publications, and fond them the most generally applicable.

        3) Campaign Resource--These were also good, generally applicable bits.

No offense, but I don\'t think I\'d buy any adventures, especially not any
from the Traveller\'s Digest.  I\'ve got a large enough archive of old stuff
now that I could cook up any adventures I need, and I\'d prefer to run
adventures with characters made up by my own players.

Since there is all sorts of discussion about the rebirth of Travller, I have
done some thinking (along with everyone else) about formats, and I have a
question:

What do people think of the "Star Wars Adventure Journal" concept?

If you haven\'t seen it, it is a 288-page, trade-size, book-quality companion
to the Star Wars RPG published 8 times a year by WEG.  It includes fiction, a
regular columns on equipment, real news, storyline "news", etc. -- sort of a
JTAS on steroids.

I think this format (like the earlier JTAS format) has a lot of potential, and
I think including fiction will both help to flesh out the background and
attrack non-RPGers -- after all, the more people that subsidize it, the more
money Marc Miller has to spend on new supplements.  Every so often the best of
the supplements could be gathered in subject specific books (tech manual,
etc.) to supplement the original release and support books.

The advantage of such a system is that no one has to wait for the specific
supplements, yet all the information will eventually be collected in one
location.

One disadvantage is that carrying all the stuff you might need might get a
little harder. A second disadvanatage, which I think can be easily avoided
with discipline and forethought, is that it promotes "Star Fleet Battles
Syndrome", where every supplement modifies the existing rules structure.

[Of course, what I _really_ want is Alvin Plummer\'s series of 400 page
supplements...]

Actually it\'s only published four times a year.  And I agree, it is a
great supplement.  This was the basic idea that DGP tried to capture

The author of the aforementioned _Plagues_and_Peoples_ mentions parasitic
infections from wading in the damp fields of the early "hydraulic"
societies, and suggests that the resulting sap of energy directly aided in
the submission of the actual farmers to those who became their masters.

As with plague, small bands are not able to support the endemic diseases
(measles, etc.). But these can be deadly when they are exposed, due to an
unprepared immune system. [Slightly off subject: same author thinks many of
the famous epidemics in ancient history resulted from the introduction of
our "childhood diseases" into a population with no history of that disease;
this may have contributed more than gunpowder to the destruction of the
Aztec and Inca states by Europeans.]

If SJG followed their "standard" approach, they would put out a world
book in which all general background was presented and then all
three era\'s (Classic, Rebellion, and TNE) would be given chapters
so the reader could decide for themselves.

Hard to say.  They might use GURPS rules (which work well with
Traveller).  They might keep the original rules  (like they had
with some games).  Though, with three sets or rules already in
use, it might make sense to use GURPS to standardize the era\'s.

    'body' => 'I think all the head-scratching about why an individual or society would
convert from a hunter-gatherer system to an agriculturally-based system when
the H/G has so much more leisure time is all missing the point, a bit:

Certainly, if the H/G is in a sparsely populated area, food is relatively
easy to come by.  However, as populatino increases, the area required to get
this food increases, not even taking into account game/forage depletion -
another serious factor.

Even this is inconsequential when you look at it from a simply human nature
point of view -
1) an agricultural system provides much more stable food supply, sure not
perfect, but NOT subject to migrations, die-offs, etc.  Herding, my personal
fave for a transition betreen h/g to agri life, kind of gives you the best
of both worlds - as long as you can protect your food from other
h/g\'s...which is a nice segue to:
2) security.  the biggest threat to humans were other humans.  security in
numbers.  more security in big numbers.  even more security in big numbers
behind big walls.
3) comfort - i\'m surprised nobody mentioned this yet.  it\'s a pain in the
ass to pack up a camp every day.  even if your bedroll is a shitty little
thing, every day you DON\'T move, you can \'comfort up\' your surroundings.
every new site always has a new collection of rocks, knots, roots, and burrs
that have to be dealt with or put up with.
4) procreation - children -esp very young - do not move well.
5) finally, h/g is opportunistic.  at least, more so than agriculture.  sure
the h/g has more leisure, but never knows exactly where the next meal is
coming from.  now, if you know that, barring flood or drought, that whole
field of wheat will be there tomorrow, you can PLAN.  and PLANNING is what
societies are based on.

I know - the above contains some sweeping generalizations, but I think they
are justified.  Ah well.

For me, #3, #2, and #4 are the most important.

I wouldn\'t be so sure of this.  I would say that are a non-trivial
number of people using GURPS rules with Traveller (a combination
that works very well).

You\'ll need to get hold of the following Books: Hard Times and 3g^3. Hard
times is a GDW MT that gives the decrepitness prior to the virus (and most
of the collapse), pregravitic and multi-stage/sectional hull rules. 3g^3
can be used to convert the Muzzle Energy to MT\'s P/A D format. If you\'re
using aircraft, you\'ll need COACC for those. You might also want to note
that task difficulties in MT and TNE correlate as follows:

MT              TNE
Simple          Easy
Routine         Average
Difficult       Difficult
Formidable      Formidable
Impossible      Impossible

By the by, does someone out there have the MT wet naval design procedures?
I haven\'t been able to lay my hands upon them up here (Anchorage AK).

Excellent suggestions.  However, just a few things about 3G^3.  First,
it\'s currently out of print.  BTRC is coming out with a new edition of
it sometime early this year.  Unfortunately, it will not have any MT
support in it.  You can try getting (and I recommend) Guns, Guns,
Guns, the 3G^3 supplement that has the stats for over 500 weapons for
each of the systems that 3G^3 automatically converts to.  This is
still available from BTRC is you can\'t find it anywhere else.  It
includes the conversion guidelines presented in 3G^3 plus expands on
them a great deal as well.  And yes, this books printing is the one
that does have MT conversion notes in it.

Ha ha. I shouldn\'t think so, given the amount of inconsistency going the
other way, i.e. from MT to FF&S. The MT ship design rules, though flawed
(even after you\'ve got the errata for them), a little less flexible than
FF&S and thus there is going to be less possibility of variation between
converted designs - I\'m thinking particularly of things like hull armour
which is quite complex in FF&S but in MT requires only a % of the total
ship\'s volume (if I remember correctly).

Re changing your game\'s rules back to MT from TNE, I\'d be wary at the
moment, since it is a long way from Marc saying "I\'d like to..." or "I\'m
thinking of..." to actually seeing said rules in a printed rule book.

I would hope that whatever the revamped Traveller rules look like, they
won\'t _prevent_ you from continuing to play with one of the original
CT/MT/TNE systems if you prefer that.

A 37 hour week is roughly 5 1/2 hours a day, which is quite a bit more than
"a couple", but even so I can see that I have to revise some of my ideas.
One thing, though: What did these neolitic people _do_ with their free time?
Please don\'t take this as a snide remark; I\'m genuinely curious.

Ah, I see. But who besides you are arguing about the way things get invented?
Not that there\'s anything wrong with discussing that, and if some of the
other people here wants to, that\'s fine, but in that case let\'s mark our
postings in some way that makes the difference clear. Discussions are so
much more fruitful if the participants argue about the same thing. All
this time I\'ve been arguing about how technology gets implemented on
various Traveller worlds, and I thought I had made that clear. Obviously
I was wrong, but have we got it straigt now?

Actually, in the context I\'m discussing (tech implementation) it makes
possibilities _more_ interesting since, I maintain, there are quite a
few customs and technologies that are possible for a TL 0 society that
wasn\'t, historically, invented on Terra. So if one hunter can support
4 non-hunters then some very interesting social structures are possible
even on TL 0 worlds. Grist for a Referee\'s mill!

Yes, but there is a world of difference between "quite likely" and
"absolutely required to by the inexorable dynamics of TL 0 societies".
In the first case _they might_. In the second they absolutely won\'t.
Surely you can see the difference?

This is a remarkably parochial view. Not to mention totally boring. What\'s
the fun of lugging your players to an alien planet if their society is
going to be a carbon copy of some ancient Earth society?

Apparently you think that most of the low-tech worlds in the Traveller
universe are native worlds. I disagree. Of the 10.000 worlds of the
Imperium, 50 _at most_ have "native" human populations (in fact, many of
the 46 minor human races known were seeded on worlds outside the Imperium),
and many of those are high-tech. It\'s harder to tell about the minor non-
humans, because we don\'t know enough about them, so I suppose that\'s just
something we shall have to disagree about. But IMO most of the low-tech
worlds in the Traveller Universe are regressed societies. So I think that
retained technology is highly relevant.

Many "natives" are likely to be descendants of settlers who brought riding
animals to the planet because, unlike tractors and air-rafts, they can be
produced by a colonial economy and they manufacture their own replacements.

We shall have to agree to disagree on that. But let me try this: You will
admit that _some_ societies will be of that kind, won\'t you? So the stuff
we\'re discussing will be applicaple in _some_ instances, regardless of how
frequent we each believe it would be.

In a universe that has a drive which occasionally flings a starship up to

civilizations would be quite common. Not to mention the effects of The

Right! You _do_ agree with me, after all! The difference IS theory. Of which
any society in contact with an interstellar society can obtain any amount it
desires.

I get a distinct feeling of deja vu... Anyway, people in contact with an
interstellar society _would_ know what it was good for. And they wouldn\'t
need to invent it, either. Just to build it.

Precisely! Another instance where you agree with me. The idea is the

The notion that the fact that someone in England didn\'t know about lenses

Resident anthropology student here :). Basically, as far as is known (I
mean, really, how many of us were around when all these initial
conversions took place), population increases and a decreased amount of
available food resources is generally accepted as the reason for societal
conversion to an agricultural as opposed to hunting/gathering model.
However, that isn\'t all there is to it- As you mention below, stable food
supply and security are other factors as well. In addition, one has to
keep in mind that keeping a surplus in the event of disaster is much
easier when you are producing more than you need to consume...however,
there is far more to it than that.

While stable in ideal situations, agriculture has just as many problems
as hunting and gathering. Crop disease, the whims of weather (ask any
Prairie farmer about weather and his or her crops), a single hail storm,
floods...you name it. The only stable aspect of agriculture over hunting
and gathering is the fact that you determine what is being grown, where,
and how much will be planted.

Erm...actually, before the advent of \'civilization\', the biggest threat
to humans would have been other predators and not necessarily other
humans Human vs Human conflict generally occurs in situations where one
group maintains herds which can be pirated, or where one group has access
to resources (of one sort or another) that another group needs or wants.
Hunting and gathering societies tend to have far less conflict with other
human groups than herders, or societies which practise agriculture.

Don\'t be surprised. The comfort level in a hunting gathering society is
no different than in an industrialized one. What is any different about
packing up and moving, and spending so many hours a week engaged in
survival activities than spending 10 hours a day working in a factory,
paying bills, and trying to make ends meet? Nothing. Different socieites,
different comfort standards.

I\'m not sure who wrote the monograph, but there is an excellent piece on
the !Kung which explains in great detail why Hunting and Gathering
involves a lot of planning, and isn\'t as opportunistic as most people
seem to believe it to be.

  Note that the Kalahari is a desert - it\'s pretty tough to live there.
The figures for lower work times are for folks who live in more
reasonable climatic conditions.

  The additional time is devoted to socializing, storytelling, and
playing games, all of which have the side benifit of training the young
in their life-roles.  Humans are apes, after all - pack animals who like
to spend time with one another doing grooming and dominance behavior.

Don\'t know. Maybe they played games, sang stories, or just hung out and
talked about the weather - or perhaps they joined c-mail (clay-tablet based
mail) mailing lists about their favorite topics and discussed the merits of
Classic, Mega, and New Era spears and pots ;)

    'body' => 'Hi Mr. Miller.  The subject line is just my little suggestion as to a
name for the new Traveller rules set you are planning.  It captures the idea
that the rules will be generic and cover many historical eras (BTW, that
is an AWESOME idea).

I, like most Traveller fans, have a million ideas regarding the
4th generation of Traveller.  I\'ve already sent you one letter, and
here\'s another.  This one\'s quite lengthy I\'m afraid, but you _did_ say you
wanted lots of feedback :-).

First, some general policy opinions.  I completely agree with you
about returning to the CT/MT systems (with some tweaking and adjusting, of
course), and I also agree that the most important thing of all is to make
the rules simple and accessible.  I\'m the first to criticize rules
systems which pander to the lowest common denominator, but the reality is
that simpler systems do better in terms of sales.  Systems such as White
Wolf\'s Storyteller line and SJ Games GURPS attract a lot of fans because they
are easy to get into and allow one to concentrate on roleplaying.  The
original Traveller was similarly easy to understand, and the increased
complexity of later systems was a mistake, in my opinion.

I think the look and feel of the new rules set is important.
Another typo-ridden set of books would be unforgiveable.  I suggest that
there be less fancy layout work and more emphasis on clear and concise
rules which have been thouroughly tested and proof-read.  This is not to
say that the rules set should be devoid of artwork, I think art is
extremely important in today\'s gaming market.  But a large percentage of
the artistic resources for the project should be aimed at a really, really
good cover and some full-page works inside (i.e., instead of lots of in-line
images and so on).  And care should be taken to make things readable by
using good serif fonts and well laid-out tables.

In terms of the variety of products you suggested, I think that
they are mostly great ideas.  However, I personally detest collector card
games, so I would vote against that particular concept.  Though it might
potentially bring a lot of money, I don\'t think such a game would work for
Traveller (mind you, I\'m admittedly biased).  The T-shirts and posters are
great PR (I would wear mine with pride!), and the novels/comics/graphic
novels would attract new players as well as fleshing out the feel of the
game for old players.  But I think the single most important thing you\'ve
mentioned in terms of new products are the computerized play aids.
Traveller is a high tech game, and it should have high tech support.  If
it is economically non-viable to include diskettes or CDs with the game
("Be sure to specify Mac or PC when ordering your copy of OmniTraveller"),
then at least include a list of web resources somewhere and allow
downloads of things like planet, system, character, and equipment design
programs. I\'m sure you could find people on the TML and XTML mailing lists
who would program these as shareware (in fact, some good programs are
already available as you probably know, and would only need minor
adjustments to fit in with the new rules). The CD-ROM would be even better
than this, of course, but I wonder if that\'s not pie in the sky at this
point.

Now on to more specific suggestions...


CHARACTER GENERATION

In terms of a character generation system, I like the advanced
systems presented in MT.  I would like to see such advanced systems
provided for more of the non-military careers, though.  I would also like
to see characters get "hobby" skills as they do in TNE.  This allows one
to flesh out the character without sacrificing its viability.  I would
also like to see a set of rolls for generating background aspects of the
character such as number of family members and salient life events.
Cyberpunk and Robotech both have interesting examples of this.  Of course,
such a system would only be a springboard and players would be free to
generate their backgrounds without resorting to rolls.  It would also be a
good idea to include (perhaps as a sidebar) a quickie generation system in
which characters are designed using points (a la Traveller:2300).  This
allows faster character creation for "beer and pretzels" nights and
satisfies the subsection of the gaming public who think that characters
should be designed instead of rolled.  It also makes it quicker and easier
to introduce new players to the game (on this note, there should be a set
of pre-generated characters included for quick start purposes).  Any
character creation system should be devoid of survival rolls, which I
think were a bad idea in the first place (sorry), and should have a method
for "upping" hopeless characters (like in TNE).
In addition to the character abilities Traveller has traditionally
had, I would like to see something along the lines of "Alertness" and
"Appearance" characteristics.  The latter is less important than the
former, but I think some kind of basic roll for noticing things is
required in any RPG.


TASK SYSTEM

I like the basic idea of the MT task system, though I think it
would be best to go back to number targets instead of the "simple,
average, difficult..." concept (not sure why, that just always stuck in my
craw).  The task system should have provisions for extreme successes and
failures, and also for "unknown results" (I don\'t particularly like MT\'s way
of dealing with either of these).
The way I deal out extreme results is this:  If the player rolls
doubles, he rolls the task again.  If the new roll yields the same result
as the old roll (i.e., they are both successes or both failures), then the
result becomes extreme.  This works quite well because it makes it
unlikely for someone who needs a 12+ to get an extreme success (he needs
to roll rolls of 12+ in a row to get it), but still allows a slim
possibility.  The chance of extreme success goes up proportionally with
one\'s chance of basic success, but never gets exceedingly high (and the
same is true of extreme failure).  Even a player needing only a 3+ to
succeed only has about a 15% chance of extreme success.  Another advantage
is that even a character needing only 3+ to accomplish something has a
minute chance of screwing up completely.
Because of the even way doubles are distributed through the distribution of
possible dice rolls, one\'s chances of rolling them are always roughly
proportional to one\'s chances of success and failure.  That is, roughly
1/6th of one\'s successful rolls will be doubles, no matter what the
target is (and this is also true of failures).
In terms of "unknown result" tasks, I generally do this:  After
the player has made his roll, the Referee rolls two dice secretly, adding
the first to the player\'s roll and subtracting the second.  Thus, the
player has a ballpark idea of what his "real" roll was, but can\'t be sure.
For example, if he rolled a success, then he _thinks_ he\'s fixed the
air-raft successfully, but he might have missed something.  If his roll
was a borderline success then he\'s going to be even more uncertain of his
fix.  A situation can even arise where the character rolls an apparent
failure but in fact succeeds:
Tech: "I can\'t figure out what\'s wrong with this thing, I\'ve
taken it apart and put it back together, and I can\'t seem to find
the problem."
Pilot (pressing ignition switch): "Um, I don\'t know what you did,
but it seems to be working fine."
Tech (watching as air-raft lifts off): "Damn, I hate it when that
happens!  You never do figure out what you did right!"
(I\'ve personally experienced this many times while programming.)

 This system also allows for differing degrees of uncertainty in task
resolution:  for slightly uncertain tasks, the referee rolls half dice
(i.e. +1d3 and -1d3).  For highly uncertain tasks, he rolls +2d6 and -2d6,
making the player\'s roll only  a very rough estimate of the "true" roll.
Note that if the player\'s roll is an extreme success or
failure, there is no uncertainty roll as such results are considered
"obvious".  I\'ve found that this rule is the best way to combine the
above ideas, anything else gets clumsy.
I like the way MT allows abilities to affect tasks, but I think
the DM for an ability should be 1/3 rounded down instead of 1/5.  This is
a minor point, but I like the way this turns out:

Stat ValueDescriptionDM

1-2very poor+0
3-5poor+1
6-8average+2
9-11good+3
12-14excellent+4
15superior+5

The major advantage here is that ability DM\'s come out as being a very
similar scale to skill levels.  Of course, task targets have to be set a
little higher (1 higher than MT works for me) because an average stat
yields a +2 DM, but this is a minor detail.


PERSONAL COMBAT

Again, I like the MT system in general, but would like to see
some adjustments.  My only request is that whatever combat system is
used, have armor subtract from damage, not from chance to hit.  The later
idea is an import from the era of basic D&D and I think it is horribly
unrealistic.
A modular combat system would be a good idea.  Start with
something extremely simple and then allow optional rules for more realism.
In a non-military campaign, people should be able to resolve combats in 5
minutes, while mercenary players should be allowed to cram in as many
tactical options and gory details as desired.  If a CT type system is
being used, tables should be provided as in Snapshot so that players don\'t
have to keep track of too many DMs.  In general, efforts should be made
to reduce the number of DMs which have to be dealt with.


SPACE COMBAT

Again, a modular system would be best.  Perhaps start with an
abstract system similar to High Guard for really quick resolution of space
combat (no need to pull out the hex maps and miniatures), and then add in
a map-based system as an "advanced" version.  I have a suggestion for
movement on a hex grid which roughly simulates vector based motion (I
think the Brilliant Lances system is okay, but this is better, in my
humble opinion).  It uses 12 directions in the same way as Brilliant
Lances (i.e., hex sides and vertices).  A given ship starts each turn with
one of the 12 directions and a speed in hexes.  The movement goes like
this.

1. Initial Vector:  Ship moves, in the direction it is facing, a number of
hexes equal to its speed (zig-zagging if it is moving through a hex
vertex).  A marker is left behind in the hex it started out in.

2. Adjusting Vector:  The ship may move from its new location to any hex
within n hexes, where n is G\'s of thrust available.

3. Calculate New Vector:  Count the number of hexes between the ship\'s
final location and the counter marking its initial location.  That is the
ship\'s new speed.  The ship\'s new direction is determined by tracing a
line from the center of its initial hex through its present hex.  If
there is some ambiguity as to which direction the ship should be
going in, the player moving the ship simply decides between the two options.

I\'ve found this system is quick and gives a nice approximation of vector
movement.  It is also a little more intuitive than Brilliant Lances.  If
turns are made to be 10000^.5 seconds long (about 317s or 5
minutes), then hexes can be 1000 kms across, allowing for large planetary
templates with rings of hexes around the outside representing the gravity
well.  The ring goes out to whatever distance the .5g limit is.
Essentially, one is "rounding up" gravitational effects.  I realize this
is a bit unrealistic, but it sure is fun!  To add gravity to the above
system, you simply put in a fourth step whereby ships whose vectors pass
through gravity-well hexes are moved 1 hex towards the planet center.
This necessitates the calculation of a second "new vector".  It\'s like
Book 2 with hexes.
In terms of combat damage, I would like to see a system which is
a little more "deadly" than High Guard or Book 2.  A good way to do this
would be to make ships more vulnerable the more hits they take (e.g., the
hull is weakened).  This would help to make combats shorter so that they
could be incorporated into a gaming session without dominating it. Long
space combat sequences lead to boredom for players whose characters are
not pilots or gunners.
That brings me to another suggestion.  I\'d like to see a piloting
roll or better yet some sort of piloting decisions worked into the combat
system (perhaps as an optional advanced rule).  This would give pilots
some actual input into the outcome of space combats (something lacking in
Book 2 and High Guard).
As a sidebar in the ship combat section of the rules, there should
be a brief explanation of the physics of space combat.  Another sidebar
should describe the feel of Traveller space combat:  Less like dog-fights,
more like submarine combat.  Suggest Hunt for Red October and Crimson
Tide as inspirations for the sensor-based techno-warfare feel of it.


MASS COMBAT SYSTEMS.

No really specific suggestions here, I\'d just like to see them
included.  Once again, nothing complex, just a simple abstract system for
determining small fleet-level and platoon-level encounters.


DESIGN SYSTEM

I hate to say it, but I\'m not sure this should be included in the
basic rules.  Don\'t get me wrong, I like designing stuff, but I don\'t
think it\'s the kind of thing most roleplayers are into, especially when
they are just starting out with a game.  I think the design system should
be left for a second book.  Many people on the mailing lists have
suggested something along the lines of FF&S "Lite".  I think that\'s the
way to go.  Have a separate book with a design system somewhere between
FF&S and High Guard in terms of complexity, and include a lot of
pre-designed equipment and "standard option packages".


WORLD GENERATION

There have been a lot of calls for the world generation systems
to be adjusted so that vacc worlds will tend to have lower populations
and so that worlds will generally come out to be more "reasonable". I
completely disagree with this.  I think one of the great things about
being a Traveller referee is having to come up with explanations for
apparently illogical UWP\'s.  There is a nice little article on this at

http://www2.hb.se/sexet/goeran/twp/rules/unusualU.htm

on Goran\'s Traveller web page (one you should definately mention
somewhere in the rule book, it\'s really good. Joe Heck\'s page is another
must).

I like the fleshing out provided by DGP\'s rules (e.g. Grand Survey
and World Tamer\'s...), but if there is to be a complete Scouts-like star
system generation system, it should be simplified or computer-supported.
I\'ve made a few star systems with Scouts, and I\'ve got it down to the
point where it only takes me on the order of 2.5 hours to make a small
system. That\'s way too long.
There has been a lot of debate lately on the e-mail lists
regarding tech level designations.  I think this is just the thread of
the week and you shouldn\'t be overly concerned with changing this.  Of
course, that\'s just my opinion as I\'ve never had any problem with the TL
designations.


CONVERTING BETWEEN SYSTEMS

One thing which is a must for any new Traveller rules system is
the ability to convert between the previous incarnations.  A system
for doing this should be included in an appendix.  This will allow
players to access the wealth of material floating around out there from
CT, MT and TNE.  The appendix should also allow conversion to and from
GURPS.  This will bring in new players who, while they will continue to
use the GURPS rule set, will buy OmniTraveller (or whatever it ends being
called) supplements and other supplies.  It works for White Wolf and
their Storyteller line.  People buy the GURPS: Vampire basic rule book,
but then go out and buy all the Clan sourcebooks, adventures, and other
things.

Well, that\'s it from me.  I hope my "War and Peace" didn\'t put
you to sleep :-).

Traveller world-view (and what I still think is the dead end of FFS, even
excepting its un-necessary level of obtuseness in design), now, just to
show what a little bit of creative thinking can achieve -- the reasons *why*
the Imperium is such aa backward place!

There are actually two (related) reasons --

1) The reason for Terra\'s defeat of the Ziru Sirka at the end of the Nth
Interstellar war, and

2) The Terran Federation\'s *loss* of the Nth Interstellar war

(and, no, the above two statements are *not* mutually exclusive - bear with
me for a while!)

How to Win a Modern War

Here we are making certain important assumptions - that "modern" wars mean
full scale conventional wars rather than guerilla actions and the sort of
civil disorder that is masquerading as "war" in Africa and (to a great
degree) Bosnia and Chechnya; and that they are, ultimately *Total War* (i.e.
they are wars to the "death" ... or the destruction/conversion of one side
by the other).

Given this, and assuming that the US Civil War is the first of the modern
"Total Wars" (the Napoleonic wars don\'t quite cut the mustard here), then it
can easily be seen that the winning side is always the side that has the
largest and strongest economy. This was the case in the Civil War, WW1 and
WW2.

Now, although the initial Interstellar Wars were fought by Terra against
the local Provincial Governor on the Imperial Rim, by the end they were
occupying the whole attention of the Ziru Sirka. Given that, then the Terran
Federation would have lost. It doesn\'t matter that they may have had
access to more advanced technologies, they would have succumbed to Imperial
mass in the same way the Germans had better tanks but could not stand up to
US tanks simply because the US had many more than the Germans did (being
simplistic here). It doesn\'t matter that the Terrans had *some* vessels that
had the advantage of better JDrives (it is unlikely that they would have
been able to re-equip the entire fleet with brand new ships!), they *still*
would have lost.

Accepted that as a reasonable assumption? Well, then, *how* in the hell did
the Terran Federation win? The answer is simple -- *they* actually
outproduced the Ziru Sirka!!! How? Simple, there seems to be an assumption
all through Traveller (in prices of equipment and services, in all the
design rules, and in all the supplementary material) that the Imperium has
an industry that is basically the same as that of *here and now*. That is,
basically manpower intensive (after all, we are assuming a civilisation
some 3000 years in the future here -- the exact opposite should be true, tho,
of course, the term is quite relative)! In other words, most people go off
to work in factories that, apart from producing high-tech goods, are not
too different from those today.

This is quite ridiculous. Why would it be the case ... well, we know from
assorted source material that in both the Imperium and the Solomani sphere
there are anti-robot forces that have forced this on both governments. Or
so it is suggested!! This is not *entirely* true - the real truth is that
the inherently conservative Vilani social structure has rejected anything
more advanced (how does this affect the Solomani? bear with me).

The Terrans of the Nth Interstellar War period, however, had no such qualms
and produced increasingly highly roboticised factories that, at the end,
effectively became half Von Neumann machines (i.e. capable of producing
anything less complex than themselves) and, *right* at the end, *full*
Von Neumann machines (capable of reproducing even themselves). These autofacs
mined their own resources, refined the ores and chemicals, and produced the
finished products on demand, all without any (or much) human intervention.
Productivity was vastly more than it is now in 1996 (or is in the 6th
millennia of the Imperium), 100 fold, 1000 fold, 10000 fold? More? Regardless,
the Terran Federation were able to swamp the Imperials with tech at the
"cutting edge" and beyond that only they could afford to produce in bulk.

*That\'s* how they defeated the Vilani.

2) How the Terran *Federation* lost the Nth Interstellar War.

But I just explained how they beat the Vilani ... !!! Note the wording
carefully *beat the Vilani* ... NOT *won the Nth Interstellar War*. This
is important.

We know from Megatraveller (Imperial Encyclopaedia) and other Traveller
material (especially re the Psionics Institutes) that the Imperium has no
qualms about, and a long record of, manipulating the truth to turn the
whole of "accepted" history into nothing less than an organised lie.

Thus, the Terran Federation *did* lose the Nth Interstellar War even tho
they *did* defeat the Vilani! How? Simple, the Terran Federation - the
democratically elected government of the Terran Sphere - were betrayed by
bloody-handed fascist militarists under Admiral Estigaribbia!

The fleet elements that supported the fascists could not have been enough
to force the Federation to accept their rule on a long term basis -- a
significant proportion, probably a majority, would have remained loyal
to the civilian government -- so they needed assistance. And who offered
it to them? Who did these elitists have more in common with , the
democrats or the Vilani aristocrats? Answer\'s simple - they got the support
of the Vilani aristocrats and Megacorps, as well as the troops and ships to
enable them to occupy the key worlds of the Terran sphere with Vilani
forces to keep the majority of ordinary Terrans who loathed the military
plotters under "control".

What was the price for this assistance? Well, neither the Vilani Megacorps
(who would have been run out of business) nor the Vilani bureaucrats liked
the idea of technology run rampant, social disruption, and uncontrolled
change that the Autofacs represented, so they demanded that all the *really*
advanced models be destroyed. The Admiral and his lackeys agreed - as,
after all, *they* didn\'t want their precarious hold on power disrupted by
some new tech development either!

So, there we have it! The Imperial Data Packet is intended to *restrict*
the spread of technology, *not* foster it! The laughably stupid way in
which it rates technology is a deliberate ploy by the Imperial manipulators
to get the populace to accept some basically identical technologies as
*different*, to think of really outrageous technologies as "doable", and
generally have a distorted view of the *reality* of tech development. After
all, if you can manipulate the way a man thinks, that\'s a whole hell of
a lot better than fighting him.

3) How about the Solomani? Well, the Vilani occupation forces were *all over*
the Terran sphere, and they didn\'t just "go away" ... there was resistance
to the Imperials for generations. Thus, when the "Long Night" fell, there
were substantial Vilani populations on all the Solomani planets -- and they
felt the need to identify themselves with the locals during that period of
chaos, and so adopted Terran names and faked their backgrounds.

They were so entrenched in control of the bureaucracies of the Solomani
planets that they were exceptionally successful in doing so - and they
have remained successful to the present day! In fact, many of the senior
leaders of the Solomani Party are close to pure Vilani in genetic terms,
and they *know* it ... the whole "Solomani Supremacy" rubbish is more
about the power it gives them to take on the Imperium and be big fish in
a little pond (as opposed to little ones in a big pond) than anything
else!

See what a little paranoid conspiracy theory can do with the stuffed Tech
rating system? And *all* of the above either fits the "facts" as already
known or, where they may be minor discrepancies, this can be passed off as
the Imperial manipulation of the truth. And it all makes a weird sort of
logical sense.

That\'s one of the reasons they invented "society". All those complex
rules, raditions and taboos that "primitive" societies have exist for
two reasons. First, to help keep the population controlled. Second, to
keep life from being too boring.

This is also where art and many crafts come from.

Remember that they\'ll have learbed the hard way that too many people
equals starvation. So they\'ll not go *too* far in that direction. But
it can be a possibility. It certainly means that they\'ll have the time
ands inclination to hunt for things the Imperials want to buy or to
produce "narive crafts" for sale. Assuming the Imerials come up with
something they want as payment.

The problem I\'m trying to avoid is the all too typical one of "it is
*possible* (and maybe even *done* in rare cases), so why can\'t they all
do it". Rare behavior should *stay* rare. If you want realistic
cultures, only a very few will do it.

Actually, I\'d find the written pass "boring", myself. Also, consider
the flip side of this. The players may be able to counterfeit the
written pass fairly easily (give me a scanner and some native "paper"
and I bet that i could!). Counterfeiting a "roll seal" or some sort of
carved token is a *lot* harder.

For that matter, if violating the "rules" carries a death penalty, it\'s
quite possible that your "pass" may be a tattoo, or scar pattern or the
like. Not only hard to counterfeit, but a *literal* pain to get.

The idea is to look at what "primitive" societies used for "id", and
use things along the same lines. That\'s far more interesting than a
written pass. It also let\'s the natives keep the fact that they can
write in reserve as a nasty surprise for the players. Picture a player
who has pissed off a native being asked to deliver some "artwork" to
the folks back at the port. And when he gewts there, he finds out the
hard way that it\'s a warrant for his arrest. :-)

I\'ve *never* been comfortable with that sort of assumption. It just
doesn\'t make sense. *Especially* on hostile worlds. Natives make a lot
more sense, and fit in better with the sort of SF that inspired
Traveller.

In which case they\'d *already* have the riding animals. So they

Sure, *some* will. But it\'s going to require a relatively "friendly"
planet, *and* a good reason for them to have had enough people to
survive, but not enough to maintain tech.

It\'d have to be a *huge* ship to have a population that could survive
long enough to fall and then work back up. *Minimum* of 100 or so of
breeding age. Populations lower than that tend to die off from genetic
accidents and just plain "bad luck".

The "long night" situation isn\'t *that* much different. Some types of
colony (mining sites) aren\'t likely to survive long if contact is lost.
Picture a deep sea oil rig trying to survive if the supply copters quit
coming.

Places *planned* as colonies would be better of, depernding on how far
along they were. Anybody who designs anything other than a mining setup
or a research station that *isn\'t* iuntended to be self-sufficient is
too much of an idiot to have been in charge (though it will happen
occasionally).

Such places would lose tech for some things, but for the most part it\'d
not affect them all that much. Maybe we need to come up with a "how to
build a colony" set of "rules", and list what happens at each stage if
they get cut off.

>>True enough. But there\'s a *lot* of spread between when something becomes

Aside from our differences over what they *would* desire, I have to
point out that many "theories" require certain steps beforehand.

An Afghan gunsmith may be able to make a wonderful copy of a firearm,
but that won\'t let him design a new one. For that, he has to know *why*
it is put together the way it is. Likewise, many forms of even "simple"
engineering require that you not only know *how* to build something,
but *why* it is built that way. Which requires familarity with *all*
the theory, including the necessary steps leading up to it.

Mind you, there are a lot of "false steps" along the way, so you can
skip a lot of that if you have someone to teach you. But there are
still things you *have* to learn before you can learn the things you
want to.

They wouldn\'t build that sort of transmitter if they were in contact
with that high a tech level. First, it\'s *real* inefficient, and second
it really messes up the RF bands. But it *is* what a scout stuck in
such a society might put together as a distress signal.

A look at the third world is instructive. They tend to do several
different things. They buy "obsolete" equipment cheaply to use (that\'s
what has happened to practically every US and European phone switch
that was in working order when replaced by a higher tech switch. It got
shipped to someplace in the third world and installed). They also
"leapfrog" some things, for example, it\'s cheaper and easier to link
cities via satellite and and airplane than to string wires and build
highways.  Railroads are still a good investment in the places that
don\'t have them or roads though.

Of course, this *does* make them dependent on the high tech societies,
but it\'s generally worth it. There\'s little reason to suppose thast
it\'ll be any different in the Imperium *unless* there are restrictions
on technology transfer. In that case, you will see folks smuggling it
in anyway (Iraq and most of it\'s nuclear, chemical, and bio warfare
gear) and folks managing to smuggle in the knowledge, or even just
invent it themselves, knowing that it is possible.

Not quite. Ideas *do* require backing of the ideas they are built upon
in many cases. Germ theory *is* a fairly low level idea in the
heirarchy though. You mainly need the idea that it is *possible* to do
something about disease as a precursor.

A well educated, well read *scholar* interested in such things had no
knowledge of them existing in anywhere in Europe. And since you
specifically mentioned *glasses*, that pretty much takes care of that.
The only reference I can think of from before that is a vague reference
to Nero or one of the other Emperors using an "emerald lens" and it\'s
not at all certain that the reference is actually period, or that it
was followed up on.

Also, the idea of sticking one lens in front of another isn\'t at all
hard to come up with. It follows human nature.... "if one lens makes
things look bigger, maybe two will make them look *real* big"

Oh yeah, a society that has fallen from a higher tech level isn\'t
likely to wind up as hunter/gatherers. The idea that it is *easier*
wouldn\'t occur to them anymore than it did to you. Once they find
edible plants and animals, they\'ll start herding and farming. Once
they\'ve got a food supply, they\'ll worry about trying to preserrve
technology.

ps. I\'d suggest that we use "native" or "contacted" for indigenous low
tech societies, and "fallen" for the backslid type.

Well, as paranoid ramblings go, it\'s a good one. The Imperium is big

win because they had more tanks, they won because they had better
airplanes (in large part due to higher octane aviation fuel that allowed
higher power to weight ratios) that gave air superiority and battlefield

  A far simpler explanation for the Terran victory is the Plague of
Duskir.  Canonical Traveller sources credit the plague with contributing
to victory - my feeling is that it was the primary factor.  When
Europeans encountered the New World, some scholars estimate that 90% or
more of the Native American population died of disease.  Many of these
diseases were trivial (measles, mumps, etc.), but in a population with no

Too bad, but it seems to be the assumption that the Traveller universe is

It has made sense to a whole lot of fairly succesful SF authors.

You and I must\'ve been reading SF from two different parallel universes. The
SF litterature I\'ve read is chock full of regressed societies. As for hostile
worlds, that depends on the degree of hostility. But often the cause of the
regression IS the hostility of the planet.

No, they would have retained the idea. What\'s your point? They would still
be a low-tech society who had not had to invent all the ideas they use for
themselves.

A passenger liner full of people from a high-tech society misjumps to a
system with a relatively friendly planet. How many of them knows how to
cope with the basics of life? Sure, they\'ve got people who can program
a computer and maintain a power plant, but how many of them know anything
about primitive technology? By the time the spaceship wears out their
children will have learned to cope at a low tech level, but how many
retains any practical knowledge of medium-level tech? (How many had any
knowledge about medium-level tech to begin with?) None. That dosen\'t
sound like a fluke, it sounds like the standard scenario.

How large a passenger ship do you need to carry several hundred passengers?
Not very. And any planet with a sizable interstellar trade would have plenty
of cargo ships with crew of that size. (In my estimate _every single_ cargo
ship that we\'ve ever seen in any Traveller module is part of a 1% "luxury"
trade fleet. Bulk cargo is IMO carried on 100,000+ T ships and constitutes
99% of the merchant fleet.)

And, of course, if you keep flinging 12-man freetraders into the wild blue
yonder, once in a while one of them _will_ beat the odds and avoid genetic
accidents and just plain bad luck. What you seen to overlook is that if
something is 99% likely to fail then it is 1% likely to succeed. _And we
control the dice_. We decide what breaks a society that we\'re designing got.

I\'ve seen it argued that it\'s a series of low-propability flukes that caused
humanity to exist today, but I\'ve never seen a suggestion based on that to
the effect that we don\'t exist.

Mining sites are just a variation of the misjumped passenger liner. Although
they would be much rarer, I agree, because most outfits would extract their
people before they closed down. Unless the final disruption was violent
(like a war or ar Reaver attack on the staging world). But again, we can
decide that that was just what happened.

>they were.

Absolutely. But there we have other ways to muck things up. Human failure is
always a good way. A power struggle, a mutiny, a small war over scarce
ressources, a disease... The possibilities are legion.

>Anybody who designs anything other than a mining setup or a research
>station that *isn\'t* iuntended to be self-sufficient is too much of an

Self-sufficient how long? Enough to survive the failure of one or two supply
ships, sure, but who reckons with the possibility that your outfit _and_ home
culture gets scragged together? And if you\'re paying high wages to your
mineing people then you don\'t pay for an agricultural support group too.

In fact, I can\'t see how a high-tech outpost or a misjumped ship can avoid
back-sliding. All the way down to hunter-gatherer is a bit far, but there\'s
no way they can produce the things needed to keep their high-tech equipment
going once they are cut off from the parent society.

An interesting idea.

A good idea. I\'d suggest "evolved" for those that has had no contact as
all ("historical" societies on presently high-tech worlds with indigenous
populations and interdicted worlds), "contacted" for indigenous populations
in contact with the Imperium, and "fallen" for backslid societies (of either
kind).

Oh, btw. about wether primitive people would want to adopt advanced ideas or
not: Remember the Five Nations? They may have been slightly more advanced
than the Plains indians (I believe that they were agriculturalists, but I
don\'t recall for certain), but not much, and they tried to adapt to the
"White Man\'s Way". Did it very successfully, too, including writing and
newspapers and such... If the white man had been willing to let them, they
would very propably have made it.

Actually, yes.

If MM really does take Traveller down multiple timelines, then
there will be room for 1 or 2 *comprehensive* Traveller magazines
(probably quarterly) and several smaller specialized journals
covering the main divergent timelines.  TRAVELLER CHRONICLE looks
like 1 of the comprehensive magazines, *someone* should publish a
second one.  The specialized journals might end up being
"Fanzines", or "E-zines."


>    What were DGP\'s unfinished projects?

I\'d be most interested in these 3.

System and world building is a special interest of mine.  If MM
takes the game into "The Long Night" and "The First Imperium",
then exploring *new* (or at least uncharted) systems is going to
become very important.  The Traveller algorithms (and all their
official extensions) are quite dated now, and need to be updated.

Nope.  I\'ve got them all from the original magazines.

I doubt it, seeing as I\'ve got most of them.  I\'d prefer new ones
in a magazine format.


What I\'d like to see:

FF&S II, FF&S Lite, and conversion rules to get CT and MT
stuff into FF&S format.  My games us a lot of "alternate"
technology, and I loved the concept of FF&S..it\'s implementation
left some things to be desired.  I know you guys didn\'t do FF&S,
but you *could* do the second edition.

WORLD BUILDERS II and WB II on disk (DOS is still the common
denominator) to build systems.  Both my current campaigns are
running during a "long night"..not *the* Long Night..and the
players often run into systems about which they know nothing.  I
want to see algorithms that create systems that conform a little
more closely to what we think is reality.

Personally, I can supply the adventures. <g>

I\'ll bet you have!  <g>

I just discovered the Traveller mailing lists last summer,
after being a player/gm for 20 years.   I suspect there are
massive numbers of people out there that play Traveller, and have
*no* idea yet about GDW folding, MM coming back, or DGP\'s
rebirth.

Hmm post something to a mailing list? What a radical idea!
I subscribed to this list just before the GDW annoucement, what timing!
I don\'t really have much background playing traveller, just one
short adventure GM\'ed by my brother-in-law many years ago.
I did play GDW board games quite a bit, Dark Nebula, Imperium, Invasion Earth,
The Blood Tree Rebelion and what was that other space game about warfare
between planets in the same solar system, might have been in a binary star
system or something? (Tri-planetary?)

I recently borrowed all my brother-in-laws CT stuff, because I wanted to
borrow some ideas for a Computer SciFi RPG I\'ve been writing.
Reading through all this material got me interested in playing Traveller again.

I though I might ask the list what peoples opinions are on use of computers as
RPG aids and computer RPGs in general.

I do own a copy of MegaTraveller 1 "The Zhodani Conspiracy" computer game
which I never played much because floppy disk access was so slow on my Atari ST
computer and it was going to take forever to get the 2,000,000 cr for that
jump-2 drive you needed so you could get on with following the plot line.

It seems to me that rolling lots of dice and looking up dozens of tables
is not what RPGs are all about, they should be about interactions between
characters and the adventure.
Any automation of the game mechanics should be welcome.

Where do computer RPGs fall down?
They are a solitary game with no interaction with real people.
They often force you to follow a tightly scripted plotline.
Also you might like to have more a view about what is going on inside the
game engine

e.g. "Ace" fires his PGMP wildly and misses with plasma bolts zipping madly
      about the room because he has no energy weapons skill.


  "Venor" successfully makes use of his demolition-1 skill and blows the door.

To keep the traditional RPG flavour you might want to know how the computer
determined the result.

A lot of computer RPGs have real time combat, which turns the adventure into
an arcade-like mouse click fest.


I don\'t know if this has been raised on the list before but what about an
online traveller game played over the Internet with some suitable PC frontend
software that could resolve space and land combat, built in chat software
and a server machine with a GM pulling the strings of NPCs.

I guess this is already sort of happening with people playing on IRC and
play by e-mail but just think how much better it could be with purpose designed
software. I think this is where Marc Miller should concentrate is efforts.
I think this could be big. (I believe Origin are doing an Ultima online game.)
The front end doesn\'t have to be amazing graphically, 2D overhead view?
(Although I rather like the 3D view in the 3DO game console version of
Space Hulk, gives you some idea of what combat in Battle Dress would be like
:) )

Some more crazy computer ideas, develop some Traveller software for the Apple
Newton Message Pad PDA thingy, it\'s very portable and easy to take to
gaming group meetings. The Newton has builtin infra red comms and a Local Talk
network port. You could run a networked game of "Computer Traveller"
face to face if your players have Newtons and a bit of Local Talk cabling :)
More fun than all "3-10 players" crowding around the one PC if you are using
combat resolving software.


I\'ve ordered myself copies of TNE, BL, BR and Striker II out of curiosity
(coming surface mail so I won\'t have them for months),
also a second hand copy of MegaTraveller.

I would like some input on what other CT MT TNE materials are most useful to
have.
I haven\'t seen the MT or TNE rules yet but I think the combat damage system
in MT sounds more sensible than CT (from MT computer game) with armour reducing
damage rather than chance to hit.

I have access to: (care of brother-in-law)

       CT books 1-5
       CT supplements 2,3,4,7,9,10
       Best of JTAS 1,2
       JTAS 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,18,20,21,24

I hope people haven\'t found this post too annoying.
Be kind to potential new travellers :)

Hey, there\'s an idea! But then again, I seem to be one of the few
non-business people in the world who actually owns a Newton. I\'m afraid it
wouldn\'t make a very marketable platform, except for diehard
Traveller/Newton enthusiasts.

One trick I did when playing Shadowrun was to use my Newton as an actual
prop, doubling as a pocket secretary. One of the players was thinking of
getting one (never did before the campaign ended) and we were going to try
beaming pre-made adventure notes & clues back just as the characters would.

>face to face if your players have Newtons and a bit of Local Talk cabling :)

Unfortunately the Newton doesn\'t really support networking other than being
able to print to a network laser printer.

I would strongly disagree with this statement. [totally without educational

What predators actually PREY on humans?  Only the largest.  Sure, wild dogs
have taken children, etc, but i\'m talking about subsistence, not
oppportunity.  Once humans develop speech, and weapons (esp an effective
missile weapon) the activities of natural predators become almost
disregardeable.
I think the anecdotal evidence of hunter-gatherer groups *lack* of conflict
tends to result more from the geography and population levels of remaining
hunter gatherer groups.  I mean, all that are left really only exist on
marginal or remote areas- everyone else having advanced OUT of the H/G
stage.  I would think that looking at human groups that have relatively
recently advanced from this stage shows a significant history of warfare,
raiding, and combat - (and i don\'t mean to offend anyone here, i am just
trying to prove a point!) look at the tribal cultures in sub-saharan african
or the north american plains.  They fought ALL the time - if it wasn\'t
organized warfare, it was raiding.
Not to commit the naturalistic fallacy, but i think it\'s clear that WHENEVER
a group of humans has found ground fertile enough to cultivate (or some
similar aspect like fishing) they have 1) built a village 2) built a wall 3)
prospered except where the H/G around them were too overwhelming.

In sum, I really think that where life/death decisions like these are
concerned, people act for loss-minimization NOT gain-maximization.  At
least, people with families.  I don\'t think that point can be overstated -
there is a significant difference betweren the way people think when they

    'body' => 'Someone mentioned that the canonical reason for Terran victory in the Nth
Interstellar War was some sort of plague that hit the Vilani. Sorry, but
I\'ve never come across this one ... but will freely admit that I do not have
a 100% complete set of Traveller/MTrav/TNE gear ... so, *where* is it
mentioned? I have a friend who *has* as complete a set of Traveller gear
as it is possible to have, and *he* has never heard of it.

However, to be fair, "canonical" Traveller also allows Jump Missiles (2 tons),
when "canonical" Traveller *also* notes that JDrives cannot be mounted in
anything smaller than 100 tons! Even if such a plague *is* mentioned, then
we can assume that it is Rule of Man/Vilani *propaganda* history to save face
for the fact that they were outproduced and outfought by the Terrans. It seems
so much better if they succumbed to a filthy, perfidious, Terran *disease* -
those lousy Terrans weren\'t fighting fair!!!

Regardless, from what we know of the history of diseases on Terra, it seems
unlikely in the extreme that some sort of nasty Terran-originated disease
would have been such a killer that it would have enabled the Terrans to beat
the Ziru Sirka simply because of it. I would suggest that anyone who wants
to know why this is the case read "Plagues and Peoples" by William H. McNeill.

However, just consider a few facts that make the plague scenario unlikely.
One, the biggest killer in modern times, disease wise, was the so-called
Spanish Influenza which broke out at the end of WW1. It was, as I have been
given to understand by several sources, far and away the most virulent
plague of modern times ... yet it was really rather trivial in an overall
sense. Sure, a hell of a lot of people died, perhaps as many as died in WW1,
but that was peanuts.

More virulent diseases *do* exist, pneumonic plague, for example. However,
in that case, the disease is *so* virulent and *so* quick acting that it
basically kills off its human victims so quickly that it cannot spread (at
least at medieval rates of travel). Given that every Jump takes at least a
week, then such a disease would kill the entire crew of a starship while
it was in Jumpspace ... and leave no infectious material that I am aware
of that would still *be* infectious after the bodies were dead for a week
or more. Most of the really nasty diseases of modern times, things like
Ebola and AIDS, are so difficult to catch that you practically have to go
out and deliberately infect oneself.

Thus, even with something as virulent as Spanish \'Flu, the effects would
*not* be enough to win the war for the Terrans *unless* they were already
winning. (Did you know that the US Government actually continued to ship
soldiers to Europe in crowded troopships in 1917, at the height of the \'flu
outbreak, even though they *knew* that they were condemning hundreds, if
not thousands, to death as a result of putting them in the sort of enclosed
environment that guaranteed a high rate of exposure? The US provided the
troops that materially shortened the war ... and morale was evidently not
a problem despite this.)

Anyhow, given McNeill\'s evidence that almost all (if not *all*) diseases
have been crossovers from animals, and that not all such crossovers are
successful, then it seems to me that the Vilani would have encountered this
sort of problem on the thousands of worlds that they had explored and
settled prior to contact with Terra. Also, given the situation we know of
from Traveller sources re the development of human civilisation on Vland,
we can assume that there would have been mutations of bacteria normally
found on or associated with humans (and viruses, of course) that would have
made disease at least reasonably common in Vland even before contact with
other worlds. I have never been able to accept the blithe assumption that
the Vilani would be disease free and would have never developed the germ
theory of disease ... after all, they had first hand evidence of the
possibilities of such diseases from their long historical contacts with
the Droyne on their homeworld ... *and* they had an awful example of the
possibilities of germ warfare from what happened to the native Droyne in
their system when they regained contact (which is in itself doubtful -
the thought that the diseases that killed them off could have been so
specific as to only affect different racial types, *and* that they remained
unmutated for tens of thousands of years, is, frankly, garbage. Diseases
mutate over time, and many once lethal diseases are now nothing more than
a childhood nuisance, if that).

Nope, you can *still* explain away the supposed effects of this plague that
I have never heard about as a crude piece of Vilani propaganda that has
been put forth as "truth" by the RoM and current Imperium for so long that the
*true* story (my version) is not even recognised as "true".

Like I said, between my story and the certainty of Imperial manipulation of
the historical record, there\'s *nothing* that can\'t be adequately explained!

Still, I\'d like to see what the reference too this plague is!

Oh, and the damn listserver is *still* sending multiple copies of both
individual articles in the list *and* of the whole list. Is it possible that
someone could do something about it?

Hardly. Post-natal "abortion", is a *common* feature in such cultures.
If your group is too big, you leave the baby behind. Or otherwise
dispose of it. *Especially* if it\'s female (population is controlled by
how many fertile females there are, not by how many males. At least as
long as there are *some* males, and "primitive" societies are more
aware of this than we seem to be)

See above. If they figure the group is getting too big, they\'ll startt
eliminating extras by whatever the customary means is.

Other than the "post atomic war" type stuff, most of the US SF which
seems to be the basis for Traveller has that sort of story as an
*exception*. Look at Andre Norton, Poul Anderson, etc.

I hope you aren\'t basing your views on Perry Rhodan? :-)

You *were* talking about the natives *getting* ideas from the Imperials
or other visitors. And, as I pointed out, they *won\'t* get riding
animals that way (unlike the American indians).

Nor are they going to *retain* the idea for long if they don\'t have any
animals suitable for the purpose.

Quite a few will. More people than you think have hobbies that give
them knowledge of at least *some* obsolete tech. Some have quite a bit.
For example, I myself know things like how to make gunpowder, sulfuric
and nitric acids, and a lot of other chemical stuff starting pretty
much from nothing but raw materials. I note only know the *current*
methods, which require hard to produce catalysts and the like, but I
also know the *historical* methods, which are much easier, even if they
are less efficient.

I also know something about farming, raising animals, primitive
weaponry, metal refining from ore, hand forging, casting, etc, etc.

If the ship\'s library is intact, they *will* have more knowledge than I
do. What I listed above is the stuff I can do *without* reference
materials.

Given misjumps and the like, plus the "imperial technical packages",
I\'m willing to bet that part of the survival gear on a properly
equipped ship is a microfiche reader (or equivalent) that requires
nothing but a decent light source to use. And a "shoebox" full of all
the tech info you could possibly need to survive on a reasonably
earthlike planet.

Remember, the original edition of the Encyclopeadia Brittanica had
*all* the technical knowledge of the time in it! And it wasn\'t any
bigger than what I\'m proposing.

As I\'ve said before and will say again, that sort of trade volume is
pure nonsense. It costs less to make the stuff locally than to ship it
over interstellar distances. *Especially* once you have decent fusion
power. With that tech level, I can extract chemically pure elements
from ordinary rock. And it\'ll cost less than mining does. Dump your
inorganic trash into a fusion torch and plasma seperator and you have
100% recycling. Add some rock and you\'ll get the traces of whatever
gets lost. Plus, lots and lots of silicon and oxygen. Seawater is even
better.

The only places where being self-sufficient doesn\'t make sense are
things like research stations, survey teams, and the occasional place
where there\'s something like gemstones, or *really* rare elements to
mine. Anyplace where you are harvesting some sort of rare organic, you
might as well have a garden plot.

Once the population hits a million or so self-sufficient is the only
thing that makes sense (work out what it costs for food *plus shipping
costs* and several *months* of reserves, then compare it with what it
costs to have a few hundred folks raising and processing food).

And it makes sense to do it at levels in the low thousands. It\'s cheap
insurance, and cuts way down on shipping costs.

Yes, we control the dice. So we are justified in having *a* low
probability event occur. Even a string of them, if it gives us an
"interesting" locale. But doing so over and over again for hundreds of
planets isn\'t even "cheating". It\'s just plain lazy. And stupid, to boot.

So a *few* planets populated by the descendants of castaways can be
justified. But not the widespread numbers we see.

That\'s because the probability of an event that has already occured is
100%. Saying that an event is unlikely *to* occur is quite different
from saying that it is unlikely to *have* occurred.

Want to bet? It\'s a lot cheaper than shipping in food. Anyway, we
specifically *weren\'t* talking about miners. Self-sufficiency for air,
water, and food (in that order) are the number one things that will be
considered in setting up *anything*. The logistics get too unweildy
otherwise. Miners and small research groups do ok on shipped in food.
Maybe even on shipped in water (but the accountants will quickly point
out that recycling gear plus *lots* of spares costs less than a months
supply of water!). *Nobody* will want anything to do with a setup that
doesn\'t have *air* recycling, or a breathable atmosphere. :-)

You can feed miners MREs or C-rations for a while. Especially if
there\'s an emergency. But they are gonna want *real* food. And while
meat is a problem (though not as bad as you might think), fruit and
vegetables are not only fairly easy to produce, they actually *help*
recycle water and air, if you need to do that.

There are even lots of animals that work well as food animals in
limited space. Rabbits, Chickens, guinea pigs (a staple food-stuff even
now in Peru! Want a recipe? :-)

True. But that *doesn\'t* mean that they can\'t produce lower tech stuff.
And don\'t be so sure about the inability to rebuild things. Give me an
environment where I can breathe the air, drink the water without too
much treatment, and eat some of the native life, and give me the ship\'s
library. It may take me several *years*, but given the resources of
even a *small* ship I\'ll be able to do one *hell* of a lot.

It pays to study *real* ships. You will find that even the smallest
freighter has a full fledged machine shop, so they can repair things at
sea, or when in out of the way ports. Only breaking things that require
a foundry will put the ship out of commission. And they also generate
more *electrical* power than a small city! Heck, that\'s how New York
City got the power to restart the local power plants after the Great
Blackout (modern powerplants require some power to run the instruments
and things like fuels pumps. You can\'t start them without it). They got
a power feed from ships in the harbor. And in Hawaaii, after an
especially bad typhoon in the 60s, the navy sent a nuclear sub to one
of the outlying islands to fill in for the local powerplant until it
could be repaired (it was there for several weeks, and was replaced by
some airlifted diesel generator units.. The island wound up with a
better power system than it had started with!)

A *Traveller* ship can produce more power than most powerplants. And it
too, will be able to fix all the parts small enough to get to the
"shop" and lots of others that can\'t be. That\'s why "Engineering" needs
so much space. :-)

They *did* have the incentive of wanting to *not* be seen as
"primitive" and "inferior". Unfortunately, they hadn\'t counted on
racism...

There are several SF stories about cultures wanting to raise their
"tech levels" so as to get a better status when integrated into the
"empire" or "federation" that had contacted them.

BTW, some of the stuff I mention in passing above would make great
adventure hooks. Or just minor but fun things to fill in gaps. Like the
players landing at a Class D(?) port just after some sort of disaster
and having to rig an adapter so they can supply power to the natives.
(Just think, the natives will likely pay them *something* and they
might just wind up with a nice goody like a lifetime waiver of port
fees or something)

Or a ship has misjump, but isn\'t too damaged. Except they need some
"unobtanium" <grin> to do the repairs. And one of the passengers is an
amatuer geologist, or has studied engineering history and knows that
they *used* to use <fill in the blank> for that...

WATERWORLD: NEW EXTRASOLAR PLANETS HAVE BEEN
DISCOVERED, and they might support liquid water.  Scientists
discussing the new observations at this week\'s meeting of the
American Astronomical Society in San Antonio, Texas sense that
with solar systems other than our own available for inspection, a
new era in astronomy is opening up.  This study of regular planets
orbiting sun-like stars (planets around pulsars were detected a few
years ago) began only in October 1995 with the discovery of a
planet around the star 51 Pegasi (Update 246). That planet orbits
its star at a radius of only 0.05 AU (an astronomical unit is the
distance between Earth and sun), making it very hot (1000 C) and
inhospitable for life.  Geoffrey Marcy of San Francisco State
announced at the AAS meeting the discovery of two planets, both
about 35 light years from Earth.  One orbits the star 70 Virginis at
a distance of 0.43  AU with a period of 116 days; it has a mass of
about 8 or 9 Jupiters and a surface temperature of about 83 C (185
F). Liquid water and conceivably life forms could be sustained at
such a planet or on a nearby moon, Marcy said.  The other planet
orbits the star 47 Ursae Majoris at a distance of 2.1 AU with a
period of 1100 days.  It has an estimated mass of 3.5 Jupiters and
a surface temperature of -90 C.  Marcy notes that  some zones in
the planet\'s atmosphere could harbor liquid water.  Marcy hinted
that his long-term study of 120 nearby stars, carried out at the Lick
Observatory, would soon yield more planets.  Basically, his
evidence for planets consists of slight modulations  in the light
coming from the stars as a result of  the tug between planet and
star.  Meanwhile, Christopher Burrows of the Space Telescope
Science Institute reported  that the star Beta Pictoris, whose
circumstellar dust disk has long been thought of as a possible
nursery for planets, did in fact possess a Jupiter-sized planet.  The
evidence for this, he argued, was a warping of the inner part of the
dust disk caused by the tidal effects of a presumed planet orbiting
in the clear zone between the star and the inner edge of the dust
disk.

Hardly. Post-natal "abortion", is a *common* feature in such cultures.
If your group is too big, you leave the baby behind. Or otherwise
dispose of it. *Especially* if it\'s female (population is controlled by
how many fertile females there are, not by how many males. At least as
long as there are *some* males, and "primitive" societies are more
aware of this than we seem to be)

See above. If they figure the group is getting too big, they\'ll startt

Other than the "post atomic war" type stuff, most of the US SF which
seems to be the basis for Traveller has that sort of story as an
*exception*. Look at Andre Norton, Poul Anderson, etc.

I hope you aren\'t basing your views on Perry Rhodan? :-)

You *were* talking about the natives *getting* ideas from the Imperials
or other visitors. And, as I pointed out, they *won\'t* get riding
animals that way (unlike the American indians).

Nor are they going to *retain* the idea for long if they don\'t have any
animals suitable for the purpose.

Quite a few will. More people than you think have hobbies that give
them knowledge of at least *some* obsolete tech. Some have quite a bit.
For example, I myself know things like how to make gunpowder, sulfuric
and nitric acids, and a lot of other chemical stuff starting pretty
much from nothing but raw materials. I note only know the *current*
methods, which require hard to produce catalysts and the like, but I
also know the *historical* methods, which are much easier, even if they
are less efficient.

I also know something about farming, raising animals, primitive
weaponry, metal refining from ore, hand forging, casting, etc, etc.

If the ship\'s library is intact, they *will* have more knowledge than I
do. What I listed above is the stuff I can do *without* reference
materials.

Given misjumps and the like, plus the "imperial technical packages",
I\'m willing to bet that part of the survival gear on a properly
equipped ship is a microfiche reader (or equivalent) that requires
nothing but a decent light source to use. And a "shoebox" full of all
the tech info you could possibly need to survive on a reasonably
earthlike planet.

Remember, the original edition of the Encyclopeadia Brittanica had
*all* the technical knowledge of the time in it! And it wasn\'t any
bigger than what I\'m proposing.

As I\'ve said before and will say again, that sort of trade volume is
pure nonsense. It costs less to make the stuff locally than to ship it
over interstellar distances. *Especially* once you have decent fusion
power. With that tech level, I can extract chemically pure elements
from ordinary rock. And it\'ll cost less than mining does. Dump your
inorganic trash into a fusion torch and plasma seperator and you have
100% recycling. Add some rock and you\'ll get the traces of whatever
gets lost. Plus, lots and lots of silicon and oxygen. Seawater is even
better.

The only places where being self-sufficient doesn\'t make sense are
things like research stations, survey teams, and the occasional place
where there\'s something like gemstones, or *really* rare elements to
mine. Anyplace where you are harvesting some sort of rare organic, you
might as well have a garden plot.

Once the population hits a million or so self-sufficient is the only
thing that makes sense (work out what it costs for food *plus shipping
costs* and several *months* of reserves, then compare it with what it
costs to have a few hundred folks raising and processing food).

And it makes sense to do it at levels in the low thousands. It\'s cheap
insurance, and cuts way down on shipping costs.

Yes, we control the dice. So we are justified in having *a* low
probability event occur. Even a string of them, if it gives us an
"interesting" locale. But doing so over and over again for hundreds of
planets isn\'t even "cheating". It\'s just plain lazy. And stupid, to boot.

So a *few* planets populated by the descendants of castaways can be
justified. But not the widespread numbers we see.

That\'s because the probability of an event that has already occured is
100%. Saying that an event is unlikely *to* occur is quite different
from saying that it is unlikely to *have* occurred.

Want to bet? It\'s a lot cheaper than shipping in food. Anyway, we
specifically *weren\'t* talking about miners. Self-sufficiency for air,
water, and food (in that order) are the number one things that will be
considered in setting up *anything*. The logistics get too unweildy
otherwise. Miners and small research groups do ok on shipped in food.
Maybe even on shipped in water (but the accountants will quickly point
out that recycling gear plus *lots* of spares costs less than a months
supply of water!). *Nobody* will want anything to do with a setup that
doesn\'t have *air* recycling, or a breathable atmosphere. :-)

You can feed miners MREs or C-rations for a while. Especially if
there\'s an emergency. But they are gonna want *real* food. And while
meat is a problem (though not as bad as you might think), fruit and
vegetables are not only fairly easy to produce, they actually *help*
recycle water and air, if you need to do that.

There are even lots of animals that work well as food animals in
limited space. Rabbits, Chickens, guinea pigs (a staple food-stuff even
now in Peru! Want a recipe? :-)

True. But that *doesn\'t* mean that they can\'t produce lower tech stuff.
And don\'t be so sure about the inability to rebuild things. Give me an
environment where I can breathe the air, drink the water without too
much treatment, and eat some of the native life, and give me the ship\'s
library. It may take me several *years*, but given the resources of
even a *small* ship I\'ll be able to do one *hell* of a lot.

It pays to study *real* ships. You will find that even the smallest
freighter has a full fledged machine shop, so they can repair things at
sea, or when in out of the way ports. Only breaking things that require
a foundry will put the ship out of commission. And they also generate
more *electrical* power than a small city! Heck, that\'s how New York
City got the power to restart the local power plants after the Great
Blackout (modern powerplants require some power to run the instruments
and things like fuels pumps. You can\'t start them without it). They got
a power feed from ships in the harbor. And in Hawaaii, after an
especially bad typhoon in the 60s, the navy sent a nuclear sub to one
of the outlying islands to fill in for the local powerplant until it
could be repaired (it was there for several weeks, and was replaced by
some airlifted diesel generator units.. The island wound up with a
better power system than it had started with!)

A *Traveller* ship can produce more power than most powerplants. And it
too, will be able to fix all the parts small enough to get to the
"shop" and lots of others that can\'t be. That\'s why "Engineering" needs
so much space. :-)

They *did* have the incentive of wanting to *not* be seen as
"primitive" and "inferior". Unfortunately, they hadn\'t counted on
racism...

There are several SF stories about cultures wanting to raise their
"tech levels" so as to get a better status when integrated into the
"empire" or "federation" that had contacted them.

BTW, some of the stuff I mention in passing above would make great
adventure hooks. Or just minor but fun things to fill in gaps. Like the
players landing at a Class D(?) port just after some sort of disaster
and having to rig an adapter so they can supply power to the natives.
(Just think, the natives will likely pay them *something* and they
might just wind up with a nice goody like a lifetime waiver of port
fees or something)

Or a ship has misjump, but isn\'t too damaged. Except they need some
"unobtanium" <grin> to do the repairs. And one of the passengers is an
amatuer geologist, or has studied engineering history and knows that
they *used* to use <fill in the blank> for that...

Subject: Plague of ???? and Nth Interstellar War

Someone mentioned that the canonical reason for Terran victory in the Nth
Interstellar War was some sort of plague that hit the Vilani. Sorry, but
I\'ve never come across this one ... but will freely admit that I do not have
a 100% complete set of Traveller/MTrav/TNE gear ... so, *where* is it
mentioned? I have a friend who *has* as complete a set of Traveller gear
as it is possible to have, and *he* has never heard of it.

However, to be fair, "canonical" Traveller also allows Jump Missiles (2 tons),
when "canonical" Traveller *also* notes that JDrives cannot be mounted in
anything smaller than 100 tons! Even if such a plague *is* mentioned, then
we can assume that it is Rule of Man/Vilani *propaganda* history to save face
for the fact that they were outproduced and outfought by the Terrans. It seems
so much better if they succumbed to a filthy, perfidious, Terran *disease* -
those lousy Terrans weren\'t fighting fair!!!

Regardless, from what we know of the history of diseases on Terra, it seems
unlikely in the extreme that some sort of nasty Terran-originated disease
would have been such a killer that it would have enabled the Terrans to beat
the Ziru Sirka simply because of it. I would suggest that anyone who wants
to know why this is the case read "Plagues and Peoples" by William H. McNeill.

However, just consider a few facts that make the plague scenario unlikely.
One, the biggest killer in modern times, disease wise, was the so-called
Spanish Influenza which broke out at the end of WW1. It was, as I have been
given to understand by several sources, far and away the most virulent
plague of modern times ... yet it was really rather trivial in an overall
sense. Sure, a hell of a lot of people died, perhaps as many as died in WW1,
but that was peanuts.

More virulent diseases *do* exist, pneumonic plague, for example. However,
in that case, the disease is *so* virulent and *so* quick acting that it
basically kills off its human victims so quickly that it cannot spread (at
least at medieval rates of travel). Given that every Jump takes at least a
week, then such a disease would kill the entire crew of a starship while
it was in Jumpspace ... and leave no infectious material that I am aware
of that would still *be* infectious after the bodies were dead for a week
or more. Most of the really nasty diseases of modern times, things like
Ebola and AIDS, are so difficult to catch that you practically have to go
out and deliberately infect oneself.

Thus, even with something as virulent as Spanish \'Flu, the effects would
*not* be enough to win the war for the Terrans *unless* they were already
winning. (Did you know that the US Government actually continued to ship
soldiers to Europe in crowded troopships in 1917, at the height of the \'flu
outbreak, even though they *knew* that they were condemning hundreds, if
not thousands, to death as a result of putting them in the sort of enclosed
environment that guaranteed a high rate of exposure? The US provided the
troops that materially shortened the war ... and morale was evidently not
a problem despite this.)

Anyhow, given McNeill\'s evidence that almost all (if not *all*) diseases
have been crossovers from animals, and that not all such crossovers are
successful, then it seems to me that the Vilani would have encountered this
sort of problem on the thousands of worlds that they had explored and
settled prior to contact with Terra. Also, given the situation we know of
from Traveller sources re the development of human civilisation on Vland,
we can assume that there would have been mutations of bacteria normally
found on or associated with humans (and viruses, of course) that would have
made disease at least reasonably common in Vland even before contact with
other worlds. I have never been able to accept the blithe assumption that
the Vilani would be disease free and would have never developed the germ
theory of disease ... after all, they had first hand evidence of the
possibilities of such diseases from their long historical contacts with
the Droyne on their homeworld ... *and* they had an awful example of the
possibilities of germ warfare from what happened to the native Droyne in
their system when they regained contact (which is in itself doubtful -
the thought that the diseases that killed them off could have been so
specific as to only affect different racial types, *and* that they remained
unmutated for tens of thousands of years, is, frankly, garbage. Diseases
mutate over time, and many once lethal diseases are now nothing more than
a childhood nuisance, if that).

Nope, you can *still* explain away the supposed effects of this plague that
I have never heard about as a crude piece of Vilani propaganda that has
been put forth as "truth" by the RoM and current Imperium for so long that the
*true* story (my version) is not even recognised as "true".

Like I said, between my story and the certainty of Imperial manipulation of
the historical record, there\'s *nothing* that can\'t be adequately explained!

Still, I\'d like to see what the reference too this plague is!

Oh, and the damn listserver is *still* sending multiple copies of both
individual articles in the list *and* of the whole list. Is it possible that
someone could do something about it?

Poul Anderson was one of the authors I would have used as an example. I
find it difficult to believe that you haven\'t read any stories of
regressed societies if you\'re a SF fan. But I\'ll have a look at my
collection and give you the titles of a few books. (Offhand I recall
that A.B. Chandler has several stories about lost colonies).

Anyway, the un-interdicted TL 0 worlds in the Traveller Universe are
exceptions too. There is one in the entire Deneb Domain. TL 1-3 worlds
are more numerous (about two dozen), but still few enough.

But if an indigenous people did have a local animal that could be trained to
be a riding and/or draft animal and just hadn\'t gotten the idea of
domestication on their own, why should some friendly scout not be able to
teach them how? Primitive people aren\'t stupid, and something like that
would be seen as obviously useful. Look at how fast the American Indian
took to the horse.

I think you underestimate the tremendous effort needed to establish a new
impromptu colony. But that objection is easily disposed of: Have the ship
just barely make it to the ground. Or have one faction keep the ship and
have another (larger) faction run away. The faction with the ship
eventually succumb to those accidents and genetic drift you spoke of. In
the meantime the other faction has had to shift for itself and has lost
a lot.

Oh, I agree totally. But no system is so fool-proof that human ingenuity
and orneriness can\'t fuck it up.

Bulk transportation costs across one or two parsecs are fairly low.

By that token it would be cheaper to extract the stuff in a system with
fusion power and transport it to systems with lower TL.

But obviously things don\'t work that way in the Traveller Universe. Just as
there is no nano-tech devices in common use, and other such strange stuff
(Like the fact that there is actually a chance of missing your target with
a TL 15 weapon). This may be serious flaws as far as you are concerned, but
I\'m resigned to them. Because it\'s my belief that the future, if
_realistically_ portrayed is a fine place to live, but a damn dull place to
adventure in (Well, propably there\'ll be all sorts of neat things to do, but
I don\'t have the imagination to portray them). So I\'m stuck with what is
basically 20th Century plots (and older) dressed up in neat, shiny SF
trappings. Only trouble is, if I get too realistic, the plots don\'t work.

So obviously there are unforseen problems with using fusion power to
extract chemically pure elements from ordinary rock. Or, more likely, with
the 100% recycling bit. Or perhaps it\'s best just to ignore the whole thing.

Anyway, just sticking to established ships like the Tukera Longliner or,
better yet, the huge military ships, there are plenty of ships that can
provide the nucleus of a lost colony.

>Once the population hits a million or so self-sufficient is the only

There is quite a spread from the couple of hundreds of people that you
say is the minimum needed to make the survival of a population plausible
and a million. A population of a million is not an outpost or even a colony,
it\'s a mainworld. And I agree that it will be self-sufficient. As long as
they can build their replacenment parts...

That depends. Are you talking about "a few hundred" using machinery and soil
supplements imported from a high-tech world or are you talking about all
the people necessary to build the machines from scratch? Because unless
you\'re talking about the second, the colony isn\'t self-sufficient in the
long run. Those machines wear out.

Hundreds? Of un-interdicted pre-industrial worlds (TL 0-3) there are about
23 (give or take a couple, I ran through the listings pretty fast) in the
Deneb Domain. That\'s a far cry from "hundreds". Of these some may very well
be contacted. But many of them have populations of less than a million.
Some of them in the thousands (a few even in the hundreds). That dosen\'t
say "indigenous" to me, does it to you?

How widespread do you see it?

Exactly my point. We\'re looking at a world like Nakege (Jewell 1305
D591314-2 (Population 5000)) and we say: It\'s strange to think that the
passengers and crew of the proud high-tech ship "Nakege" has come to
this pass, but there it is. [Insert history of long series of disasters
that brought the orginal settlers low]. It was an unlikely thing to happen,
but as the UPPs show, it did.

Oh, I think we can squeeze a few more than two out of that scenario. It\'s
a big universe and the Reaver mentality is universal.

Never underestimate the ability of sentient beings to muck things up. But we
don\'t need a legion of such places. A few hundred - less than a thousand,
anyway - for the whole Imperium. And I\'m not saying that some of them can\'t
be contacted worlds. But there\'s a problem with those. They _have_ to be
aliens. The canon dosen\'t allow us more than one minor human race per
sector on the average. Now, aliens are all right as a change of pace. They
are also all right if someone else does all the scut-work of detailing them
for me. But personally I get more mileage out of using my time to detail an
alien human society than I get from detailing a totally alien species,
biology and mentality. Frankly, it\'s not cost-effective (for me) to invent
believable aliens. Takes too much time and creativity that could have been
used more profitably on other projects. So my low-tech societies are mostly
human. And that means regressed (or deliberately restrained) societies. YMMV.

>Want to bet? It\'s a lot cheaper than shipping in food.

Is that something that you\'ve calculated or is it just an assumption on
your part? If the first, could you let me see the calculations? I think
I once calculated the transportation overhead for bulk cargo at 1 Cr per
kilo, but I won\'t swear to it. I\'ll see if I can dig out my figures.

>Miners and small research groups do ok on shipped in food.

What is "small"? If it\'s more than a couple of hundred then you have a
nucleus of a population large enough to satisfy you (by your own earlier
posting). If it\'s more than a couple of dozens we\'ve got enough to
satisfy me.

Sure. And there are a lot of mid- and even high-tech worlds out there that
have population groups that started out that way. But the ship wears out.
You die. If you\'ve trained a successor it may be all right. If not then it\'s
too bad that the ship had that machine shop, because unless the people on it
were exceptional human beings, sure as God made little green apples they will
have based their society on stuff that can only be made with the facilities
of the ship. And when the ship power plant goes, they are in real big
trouble. Sure, you taught your children a lot, but did they teach their
children? Oh, I don\'t say that it\'s inevetable, but it dosen\'t take many
mistakes to ruin such a setup.

But they are a counterexample to your thesis that primitive people wouldn\'t
adopt (in your example) paper and writing because they wouldn\'t have the
motivation. Motivation is where you find it. Some low-tech societies won\'t
have it. But others will. And that\'s just what makes the difference between
Stave and Knorbes.

That is, a series of levels denoting the technological support someone with
all the necessary knowledge would need in order to be able to introduce a
new technology into a society that lacks it.

Note that this would solely deal with capabilities. There may very well be
social reasons - custom, religion, etc. - why such innovations won\'t work
(Very possibly the reasons why it hasen\'t been introduced before), but for
our purposes we presuppose that there are no such barriers.

It would propably be best not to tie us down to any existing tech levels,
neither Traveller nor GURPS nor any other. Perhaps, once we are done, we
can relate these Tech Implementation Levels (TILs for short) to Traveller
and GURPS TLs.

I propose the following definitions:

TIL 0 is any technology that a person with the proper knowledge and access
to the required raw materials can implement with little or no help.

TIL 1 is any technology that a person with the proper knowledge and access
to the required raw materials can implement with the help of the surrounding
society (in effect, if the local authorities says: "Give this man whatever
help he needs, within reason.")

TIL N, for N>1, is any technology that a person with the proper knowledge
and access to the required raw material can implement if, and only if, one
or more TIL N-1 technologies are available. (If several technologies of
different TIL are required, the highest TIL apply).

Note the "required raw materials". I would like to make this chart as
independant of Earth conditions as possible, but I don\'t think it can
be done altogether. For one thing, we have to assume the presence of the
appropiate raw materials. For another, we have to assume the ABSENCE of
any exotic materials. One could, for example, imagine an alien plant
whose pollen was as volatile as gunpowder and suddenly have TIL 0
explosives. This would IMO be unmanagable. So assume terrestial conditions.

I suggest that we first agree on what constitutes TIL 0 and 1. Some of it
will involve judgement calls. For example, it would propably be possible
for one man to make a crude iron sword all by himself. But the labor
involved in digging out the ore, refining it, building af forge, etc.
would, IMO, take so long for a single man that it would prove prohibitive.

Here\'s my suggestion for TIL 0 and 1. The categories are suggestions too.

My understanding of the issue is that it is presupposed that the Vilani
Empire was already on the verge of collapse.  The problem is that the
collapse of an Emire that size doesn\'t occur overnight.  Given
the huge differences in scale between the Terrans and Vilani Empire,
is hard to see (even with a tech edge) that the Terrans could have
given the Vilani Empire a big enough shove to make a significant
difference in the course of events.

To me, the idea of the a plague is that it causes a widespread disruption
in a system that is just barely functioning.  If you add this to
the a a number of other external threats, and maybe a rebellion or
two in various parts of the empire, and you can see the central
government just being unable to exert control.

Of course even then, you still don\'t have a Terran "victory".  They
just don\'t have enough people do overcome the even the scattered
remnants of the empire.  My presumption has always been, as things
came to a head, a number of Vilani generals saw the collapse coming
and decided that it could be staved off by coopting the some of the
forces pushing collapse.  This idea is that a portion of the Vilani
military, along with some reformist rebel groups, negotiated a
surrender in which the Terrans assumed control and ruled through
the existing power structure.  Then both the Terran and other
rebellious forces, and the forces the Vilani would have lost fighting
the aformentioned, could be used to stablize the situation.

The problem is that you a looking for a disease that kills a majority
of the population.  The Black Plague killed 1/3 of the population.
Some thing kills even 10% will cause a huge disruption to a society
(esp. since space travel, the backbone of the empire, will be hardest
hit).

If you have a biosystem that is compatible enough for humans to live
then you are going to deal with bateria.  However, virus\'s are another
matter alltogether.  In an ecosystem where you don\'t even share a
universal ancestor, it is possible to see how the threat of viral
infections could be trivial or non-existant (esp. since we know
nothing about what other biosystem might be like).

    'body' => 'OK, now that I know where it\'s from, it\'s *easy* to discount. The info is
from terran sources, and so is suspect, you say, in that it claims the
plague occurred *after* the war was over. Aha, but my premise is that the
Terran *military* were the ones who placed these "lies as truth" along
with their Vilani collaborators ... so we need to keep in mind that the
information on the plague is *not* planted by "Terrans" per se but by
"Imperial" (or "Militarist") Terran "Imperials".

Given that, it still makes no difference to my alternate history. Regardless
of when the plague occurred, it had a minimal effect on the course of the war,
and the real victory was won by Terran productiveness.

As for Vilani medical tech, well, I still believe that it would have been
good enough for the so-called "plague" to have been no worse than the Spanish
\'Flu. You mention the 90% (in some cases, not all) die backs of indigenous
populations in Terran history resulting from them encountering "modern"
civilisation and its many diseases ... but note that the main killer in these
cases was not the disease *per se*, but the social collapse that accompanied
it. Many of those people, probably most, would have survived if simple nursing
techniques were applied - provision of food/water, keeping them warm etc. -
but the fear engendered by something so obviously "supernatural" was the
kicker, and most of the people fled the ill, leaving them to die, nominally
of the diseases, but actually as much from neglect as anything else. (This
is thought to be a possible reasnon why Christianity was so successful in
the Roman Empire - during the plagues of the 3rd or 4th centuries, the
pagans basically fled for their lives, while the Christians basically
remained behind and provided the sort of basic care - "charity" if you will -
that saved many of the ill, who were so impressed by the power of their
belief and their god that they converted in large numbers.)

The Vilani are a different kettle of fish. They *must* have knowledge of
diseases - what I was trying to point out is that, even on Vland, where there
were no organisms closely related to them, there must have been food animals
which carried disease organisms ... and, *inevitably*, close association
with large enough concentrations will lead to some crossover simply as a
result of mutual mutation and genetic drift. Some basic precautions for the
treatment of such outbreaks would be part of the Vilani medical knowledge -
and their conquest of the empire would expose them to microbial and viral
organisms from other planets, the ones with the Minor races, at least, that
would be sufficiently different from their own "normal" microbial/viral
background to cause diseases and spur some basic knowledge of disease
amelioration and control methods. Also, consider their contacts with the
Vargr, also of Terran stock (and Influenza is thought, IIRC, to be related
to Distemper ... or is it Swine \'Flu, and distemper is related to some
other human disease? Really makes no difference, the point is still valid).

Also, there has, by the Nth Interstellar War, been ongoing contacts between
the Vilani and Solomani for several hundred years ... and you can assume that
many human diseases would have swept through Vilani space *already*. And it
is likely that the humans offered medical knowledge and vaccines to the
Vilani to treat these diseases, so they are aware of the problems. Look, the
sort of biowar plague that you are claiming the Plague of Duskir was is not
very likely to exist ... something that affects only Vilani, and is a megadeath
causer. Not given the ongoing contacts they\'ve had with humans ... and, given
the long period of separation between the two races it is just as likely
that the Vilani are carriers of some otherwise *to them* harmless virus or
bacteria that is a nasty surprise to their long lost Terran cousins.

Thus, the Plague was not likely to be a significant factor as a military
weapon, and is more likely to simply be a cachet given to a number of
different diseases that the Vilani had not yet been exposed to prior to the
Terran defeat of their military. Or that\'s what I\'ll claim, anyway, and it
makes perfect sense, and is not overly (or even very) complex!

As for the problems of hiding such a conspiracy. Well, why is it a problem?
Yes, there\'s almost certainly a *lot* of information out there that shows it
to be a lie, but who\'s going to allow it to be published openly? At the time,
no-one. And for the here and now, well, we know the Imperial Government
routinely suppresses information it does not want spreading - look at its
attitude (supposedly) to Psionics, the Domain of Deneb\'s manipulation of the
Imperial Library Database, and even the pursuit of Prof Kuligaan (? You know,
the guy who suggested the Imperium wasn\'t etenal in the pre-Virus period).

Then consider the Imperial attitude to "research" ... how the Solomani
Hypothesis was proved. The guy who did it did no onsite research, he simply
did a database search of *secondary* material! Now, since we know the
Imperium manipulates the database, then the material that would show the
truth probably only exists in hardcopies in University libraries and private
collections in the Solomani sphere (or what was *once* the Solomani sphere).
And a lot of that is probably suppressed or security coded, too. Especially
since the Solomani Party is dominated by ethnic Vilani from the occupation
forces who wish to keep their positions ... SolSec would suppress it as a
matter of course, and even more ruthlessly than the Imperials, in all
likelihood.

Then, there\'s the simple passage of time *and* the fact that the "official"
version of history fits all the facts - because all the facts that don\'t
fit have been suppressed. How many Japs know the "truth" about WW2? And
they\'re pikers compared to a thousand year old Imperium!!!

All in all - I don\'t see it as a problem.

    'body' => 'It has been suggested that the Gulf War is an example of superior technology
defeating mass and that this can and should be applied to the Terran victory
in the Nth Interstellar War. The suggestion is that a sufficient tech
difference would have been like "magic" to the low tech participants. This
is likely true, even allowing for the minimal *actual* difference between
most Traveller TLs. However, the main problem is that there was only a one
TL difference between the competitors ... the Terrans achieved Jump3 while
the Vilani had only Jump2.

Looking along the same TL lines, Jump3 is TL12 and Jump2 TL 11.

Personal Military Tech: PGMP-12, Gauss Rifle for Terrans; Combat Armor and
ACR for Vilani.

Heavy Military Tech: Fusion Guns, Dampers, Superdense Armor for the Terrans;
Repulsors, Meson Guns, Plasma Guns and Crystaliron for the Vilani.

Computers: Model 6 for Terra; Model 5 for Vilani

Commo: Translators for the Terrans; Personal Datalinks for the Vilani

Medical: Broad Antitoxins, Enhanced Prosthetics for the Terrans; Nerve Refusion
and Artificial Eyes for the Vilani.

Transport: Jump3 for Terrans; Jump2 for Vilani

Energy: Fusion Plants 250l minimum for Terra; 1000 liter minimum for
Vilani.

A qualitative edge, to be sure, but not big enough to account for the sheer
mass of the Vilani versus the Terrans. And, given the usual cost of "cutting
edge" tech, most of the Terran fleet probably still would have been Jump2
in any case. So there *still* needs to be an explanation of how the Vilani
lost ... and Terran outproduction by virtue of a different approach to
manufacturing is as good an answer as any.

(Continued from previous message)

  There ought to be a way for almost any obstacle to be solved
  non-violently by thought, even if it\'s also possible to do it by
  going after it with all weapons blazing.  Area-specific
  adventures are OK, but if they _are_ published, some guidelines
  on converting them to run in another area would be appreciated.
  Better still would be to publish adventures that aren\'t oriented
  to one specific scenario.

  Above all, the thing that needs to be remembered is _RELIABILITY_.
  If you\'re saying that _Offworld_ is going to be published every
  two months, then by golly, meet that schedule.  Ditto with
  product releases.  Don\'t sacrifice quality to do it (the way T$R
  did) - but don\'t let yourself get into the same pattern that GDW
  did, where any date that was published was an estimate of a
  fantasy, and schedule slippage was the single largest shipment
  coming out of Illinois. I just wonder, sometimes, how many people
  were _lost_ from the Traveller market because of it...

  Enough for now.

  I\'ve been watching the debate over what the future direction of
  Traveller should be, now that GDW has announced that they will
  kiss us goodbye, but I\'ve avoided saying much.  Having seen some
  opinions _and_ some thought-out suggestions, I think it\'s time to
  toss in my two centicreds to the debate.

  First, let me note that I _have_, privately, sent feedback to
  Marc, and I have also had some correspondence with Roger in re:
  Traveller IV or whatever it ends up being called.  I haven\'t
  copied the list on what I felt it was inappropriate to do so.

  I\'ll try to stick to one concept at a time in the remainder of
  this missive; please forgive me if I stray from that ideal.

  In general, I see good features to all three rule sets to date; I
  believe that a good rule system for Traveller IV (T4 henceforth)
  would take the best of the three existing rule sets.

  Character Generation:  There were two IMO serious faults in the
  CT and MT character generation systems.  First, both of them
  offered the opportunity to kill a character during generation.
  Unh-unh.  No way.  No way in hell I\'m gonna let Joe Blow, BABAA9
  bite it before I get to _use_ him (yes, I really rolled him up -
  but his name was Kamehameha Rabinowicz-Singh, and no, he didn\'t
  die during generation). I don\'t recall a character that I or any
  of my players ever rolled where we didn\'t have the "optional
  survival rule" (short term and immediate muster) in force, just
  in case. Second, the lack of provision for multiple careers - if
  you\'re starting a character out at age 18, by the time he puts in
  his 20 in one of the armed services, he\'s only gonna be 38.  Even
  today, that\'s young enough to be able to start a second career,
  even if it can\'t (normally) be a military one. Many NYC police
  officers, for example, do just this, sometimes using their
  "off-duty employment" as a basis for it.  TNE closed both
  problems - but _its_ major problem was that there was no
  equivalent to the extended CT/MT character generation procedure.
  A minor problem was that it didn\'t really allow for "off-duty
  employment" in careers where this is realistically possible
  (almost all civilian careers, including law enforcement).  WHAT
  I\'D LIKE TO SEE IN T4: Extended career generation for all
  careers, or at least guidelines that explain the logic behind the
  implemented system so that GDs (Game Designers; I always felt
  this most appropriate for things from Game Designers\'
  Workshop...) can implement their own in keeping with that
  philosophy; ODE availability where it\'s reasonable; no death
  during generation; ways to improve (within limits) UPP stats.
  Quite honestly, I think the TNE character generation system is a
  good _start_.  It\'s by no means a finished product, though, and I
  could see providing a little more "complex details" for some
  careers - recall my extended post to the TML (not to the XTML,
  though) on Law Enforcement character generation some months back.
  I\'d also like to see equally detailed character generation for
  nonhumans, and for major-polity characters other than the
  heretofore "focus" groups - the RC, the Pocket Empires, and the
  Regency.

  World Generation:  Inadequate in the base system; overly complex
  in both World Builder\'s and World Tamer\'s.  Gotta figure
  something out here; I like the level of detail provided by
  WBH/WTH, but about the only sensible way to use the procedures is
  to write a computer simulation - and I haven\'t, yet.  The short
  UWP probably provides enough information for a referee to come up
  with a "planetality", but there\'s room for expansion.  The WBH
  did this, especially with respect to law level and tech level
  data - but I think that it could have been done for Government,
  also; there are forms of government which are ambiguous as far as
  how to classify them.  For example, would the United Kingdom be a
  charismatic dictatorship or a representative democracy?  Would
  that change if the Sovereign had powers equivalent to the ability
  of the President of the United States to issue "executive orders"
  which have the force of law?  Also, an economic profile (see my
  comments on trade) would be useful; government decisions and
  priorities can _strongly_ influence the economic climate,
  including the desirability to foreigners of doing business there.
  Also, should the UWP reflect what the government _says_ is the
  case, or what is _really_ the case?  For example, the law may say
  that no weapons may be carried (law code 9), but if many people
  carry weapons and nobody seems to do anything about it, then the
  effective law level may be only 4 or 5. Which do you record?

  Task Resolution:  Just recently, someone posted some thoughtful
  comments, including a method wherein the "Huh?" factor can be
  taken into account.  I _like_ this; it adds realism to task
  resolution.  I would prefer a way that "_requires_" role playing,
  but that\'s unrealistic - I can\'t rationally expect a _player_ who
  knows nothing about computer programming, for example, to come up
  with a workable, coherent method of solving a computer-related
  problem - that\'s the whole _point_ of the task system, and it\'s
  my responsibility as GD to take the results, and dilute liberally
  with technobabble to integrate it into the
  adventure/campaign/scenario.  For non-combat tasks, I feel that
  the MT system was useful; modified to allow for uncertainty and
  "Huh?", I think it would do nicely for T4. Combat is supposed to
  be fast moving; I\'d like to see a combat system that is fast

  moving as well.  Realistic accuracy, penetration/damage, and
  armor factors are a must, regardless of the actual numeric values
  used; I\'d recommend a flat "to-hit" number, DMs + accuracy and
  character skill/ attribute, - target agility (within limits - you
  can\'t dodge a beam of light...); and damage based on penetration/
  damage less target armor.  This kind of system _requires_
  realistic assessment of the indicated factors, at least relative
  to each other, otherwise, you potentially end up with the
  ridiculous scene where the martial-arts expert goes up barehanded
  and bare-assed against the Imperial Marine with the battle dress
  and the FGMP15, and wins - that\'s OK for a Bruce Lee movie, but
  not for Traveller.

  Other play rules:  The trade rules I\'ve seen aren\'t satisfactory
  at all.  A good set of trade rules would allow for rarity on
  sourceworld, demand or lack thereof on destination world, and
  cost differentials based not only on tech level but on currency
  exchange differentials.  Not to mention dealing with the
  overhead, which could be different not only between ships, but
  between cargos, either due to inability to load the exact same
  amount each trip, or because of special handling needs.
  Unfortunately, to do what I would consider an adequate trading
  system would almost have to be virtually a whole game in itself.
  Maybe one of these days I\'ll finish working up the extended
  economic profile/system I started working on.

  Technical Architecture:  The FFS concept is good; the execution
  leaves much to be desired.  The numbers don\'t come out right, and
  it\'s quite difficult to follow the procedure, not to mention
  time-consuming.  There\'s also no way equivalent to the CT USP to
  quickly profile a ship as far as basic capabilities go.  The
  highly detailed profile that seems to have become standard is
  nice to have, when it becomes important, but having something
  like a USP would be convenient when you\'re about to enter
  ship-to-ship combat, and want a basic rundown on the capabilities
  of that Schlemiel-class zetzer as compared to your own
  Schlemazl-class tukhuspotcher.  At that level, there\'s only a few
  things you\'ll really need to know - how does its _X_ compare to
  mine, where _X_ is any or all of speed, maneuverability,
  offensive power, defensive power, jump capability, size, ability
  to jam my communications, ability to punch his communications
  through my jamming.  Those, at least, are right off the top of my
  head.  A good starship commander would have that information for
  the stock versions of each class of ship he would likely
  encounter - but my players aren\'t starship commanders; they\'re
  computer geeks, accountants, marketing reps, auto mechanics, and
  so on.  A quick comparison of USPs would provide a reasonable
  "feel" of having that information at your fingertips.  Similar
  systems for planetary vehicles (i.e., for ground combat or just
  normal use on a planet) would be appropriate for the same
  reasons.  Personal weapons probably don\'t need a profile string,
  although for completeness it might be nice.

  Sourcebooks:  I like the way _Vampire_Fleets_ was organized, with
  alternating sections of adventure plot and background info.
  However, the TNE philosophy of keeping the GD as much in the dark
  as the players doesn\'t sit well with me.  I like to know the
  whole story, so that I at least have some idea of what to expect
  if my players decide to go off in some wild unexpected direction.
  I like the level of completeness represented by much of the
  material put out for CT and MT, especially the DGP alien modules.
  Specifically, I like _information_, even if the presentation
  results in "moral" ambiguity.  This, to me, has been a hallmark
  of Traveller, that made its stellar societies _real_, rather than
  just being Americans in funny clothes - there was always enough
  _background_ to see how and why a particular behavior would fit
  into the society that it putatively stems from, rather than just
  being a funny habit grafted onto otherwise ordinary-to-20th-
  century-Terran-American-eyes people.  I like the proposed idea of
  telephone-directory sourcebooks, _provided_ that (a) they\'re not
  _required_ to play, or to understand adventure material published
  elsewhere, and (b) they are coherently organized, chock-full of
  real information, and properly proofread.  Coherent organization
  would also, in my view, allow the sourcebook to be published in
  sections, or even printed one article at a time in _Offworld:_
  _The_Journal_for_the_Dedicated_Traveller_ (benefit of membership
  in TAS).  Marc\'s idea of source material for multiple eras in the
  History of the Universe, including parts of history never before
  seen, is also a drooler for me.

  Using My Model/1:  Yeah, I like this idea.  I\'d like to see
  decent software for all sorts of purposes for decent prices.
  FFS2.  WBH/WTH.  CharGen.  Atlas.  Something like the Traveller
  Navigator seems to me not to be worth the money that was being
  asked for it, especially since almost any computer geek with
  Microsoft Word for Windows and the Microsoft Help Compiler could
  turn out something useful that looked a lot like the product
  portrayals from the ads in a small number of days (per sector).
  Don\'t rule out shareware, either.  I\'d have written a lot of the
  above if I had a decent compiler for a Windows language that
  didn\'t add gratuitous bloat to the code.  I\'d even consider doing
  stuff in DOS, if I thought there was a market for it...

  Published Adventure Material:  My group isn\'t into hakkenslash.

I don\'t agree.  First of all, there was also a huge difference in the
training and leadership involved (a difference that, in the American
Civil War, allowed Southern forces to acheive victory over armies
that were superior in both numbers and equipment).

Second of all, the advantage that superior technology gives you
is greatly diminished when you go from defeating forces to
occupying and holding territory.  In the Gulf War things would
have been a lot different if we had needed to hold territory with
a significant population.

1-10(give or take?). ALIEN SOURCEBOOKS

These could be presented as one per alien, in a huge compendium, or
something in between (a la the DGP alien books).  The important thing is to
get detailled sourcebooks out for aliens in the game ASAP.  In fact, I\'d
like to see rules in the basic game for generating some of the more common
aliens of the Imperium (e.g. Vargr and Aslan), so players can start playing
them right away.

Besides the major races, it would be really good to have access to all the
minor races that have popped up over the years.  Unless somebody has been
hoarding all TRAVELLER msterial ever published, they have no real idea of
what a Virushi or an Ael Yael is, and even if they do, they have no idea how
to properly generate (or play) a Vegan or "Dandie" (I refuse to spell the
real name out) PC or even NPC.

Also, somewhere in there, it would be good to have general guidelines
somewhere for referees who want to design their own aliens or adapt them
from other sources.  The universe is a big place, and it\'s teeming with life.


11.  I.I.S.S. FIELD GUIDE

This would:

a) Describe the history and operation of the Scout service in detail.  This
would be nice, but not necessary.  If, as people are saying, there will be a
number of possible time periods, it would be useful to detail how what the
Scouts do in the early days of the Imperium was different from what they did
circa The Rebellion/The Short Dusk/Hard Times/Whatever.  This would also be
a good section to suggest potential adventures for scout characters.

b) Give rules for coping with planetary wildernesses--extremes of heat and
cold, foraging, moving across rugged terrain or unusual environments
(mountain, water, etc.)  As with the aliens, this covers a lot of
information that people who aren\'t avid collectors just don\'t have.

c) Give rules for wilderness operations for starships.  This would go beyond
refuelling at the local gas giant and deal with things like how you ut down
a starship when you\'re landing on a flat patch of ground rather than a class
A starport.  Also, when you take your scout/courier on long surveys, just
how much space does a week of supplies take up?


12.  WORLD DETAILLING

Although many have brought up that the basic TRAVELLER world generation
system isn\'t very "logical", it\'s quick and easy and, quite frankly, I want
to change as few things as possible with the new system.  With this said,
some way of adding onto that is necessary--if for no other reason, than to
help referees figure out how long the local day is or what the temperature
is.  I\'m not sure if this should be like _Scouts_, _World Builder\'s
Handbook_, or something entirely different.  One nice addition, from 2300AD
would be some way of estimating what kind of major facilities (e.g.
university, trans-grav rail, etc.) are on the planet.


13.  DESIGN SOURCEBOOOK

When I switched to MT, I appreciated the fact that I could design vehicles
from the ground up.  Although I never played TNE and have heard mixed (at
best) reviews of FFS, I like the idea of being able to design *anything*
from the ground up.  I agree with what others have said, though, in that it
should be simple enough to do without a computer and that it would be good
to have a simple way of expressing an item\'s capabilities.  (Another
UPP?--"Universal Product Profile")


14.  ROBOTS and CYBORGS and ANDROIDS (Oh, my!)

Although some of these could be included in the above sourcebook, it might
be better to have something separate to keep all the "created beings" in one
place.  Just as I\'d like to see some alien examples in the basic game, so
would I like to see 1 or 2 robots in the equipment list.  It would be a
useful reminder that this *is* SF, after all.


15.  JTAS RIDES AGAIN!

Not that this journal per se needs to be resurrected, but there should be
some *regular* journal devoted exclusively to TRAVELLER.

16.  BELLS and WHISTLES

I like the idea of t-shirts, etc.  Also, things like the ID cards in
Supplement 12 were really neat.  If there is a journal, then there could
perhaps be a pge devoted to this sort of thing in each issue.



Thank you for listening.  I also have ideas on what I\'d like to see in the
basic game, but will save that for another time.

Sounds good.  Though its really fleshing out the comments in Book 2, that
the TL is a measure of the local capabilities, and affects whats readily
available for trade purposes.  Higher TL equipment may be arround, but
its imported - so expensive.

Some Comments...(anything snipped out has not comments)

> Technology Implementation Level Zero:
> =====================================
> CONTAINERS: Baskets, small clay pots, gourds, skin bottles.
Baskets need tools to cut and split the materials, you might not need to
split the right sort of reeds though.

> COMMUNICATIONS: Writing, smoke signals, beacons, semaphore, flags.
For smoke signals, semaphore and flags, you\'d need some sort of blanket
or cloth.  Would anamal skins be suitable for these tasks?

> FOOD: Hunting, gathering, kitchen gardening, salting, smoking, drying,
>       fermentation (?), winter wine.
I agree wth the (?) for fermentation, wouldn\'t you need some sort of
container, both to hold the fementing mash, but also for boiling the hops
etc..  Unless anyone knows of a recipie that doesn\'t need the boling process?



> Technology Implementation Level One:
> ====================================
> CONTAINERS: Large clay pots, glass bottles, leather bottles.
How would the tube (assuming blown glass) be made?  It could be made from
brass, though making tubes is quite a tricky thing.

> MILITARY: Chariots, war elephants, siege machines.
Chariots and siege machines probably need Iron age tools.  Although you
could make the wood working tools out of bronze, they don\'t hold their
edges well.
Its like the argument that the Egyptians who built the statues in
the Valley of Kings, had to be Iron age.  You can\'t carve Granite with
bronze tools!

> COMPUTING: Logarithmic tables.
You could have these at TLL0, all you need to make a set of Napiers
Bones, is some sticks and a knife.

> ENVIRONMENT: Carved caves, brick and stone buildings, sewers.
Again you\'d need Iron tools for most of the stone work.

A very good start.  Though IMHO the TL thing went down hill with MT.
I do like the Book 2 description, its easy to play with, and allows
variations.

There will be two forms of TL.  The planets that have "evolved" to that
TL, much like our world.  And those limited by some other factor.  If you
have C20 knowledge of materials science and engineering, along with
biology, chemistry, and physics.  You can make a better go of things with
a previous centuries resources.

An example (not a good one perhaps)
We know a lot about weaving.  You could perhaps create a loom capable of
quite good weaving, with TLL0 materials.  Because you know how wool has
to be spun, and how to weave.  It just need improvisation to make it work
with TLL0 materials!

Or bridge building.
With knowledge of engineering, and the apprpriate knots/lashings.  You
can make quite a good bridge, again with TLL0 materials.  Grass, reeds
can be made into ropes,  trees can be cut roughtly (just felled and
trimmed).

Steve Higginbotham once calculated that TL 12 navies have a 2/1 advantage
over TL 11 navies. Of course, this assumes that both parties build sensible
ships. If the Vilani were used to being the ones with the TL advantage then
their ships may not have been optimally designed at first. It\'s hard to
imagine that they wouldn\'t improve once they had some serious competition,
though.

He also mentions that when you go from a straight strength comparison you
can shift those odds by 1-100 depending on the strategies.

However, as has already been raised as a posibility, Vilani turncoats could
change the odds a lot. Add Vilani divisiveness, with provincial admirals
revolting against the Shadow Emperor, and you may have an explanation that
holds water.

I\'ve got most of Chandler\'s stuff. Though his stories are (IMHO) are a
lot less like Traveller than (for example) E.C.Tub\'s "Dumarest of
Terra" series (which *has* to be where they got fast drug and slow drug)
And Chandler\'s Universe has a history that was specifically set up to
*make* lost colonies likely. Traveller has nothing equivalent to the
"gaussjammers".

Still, that\'s rather common, all things considered.

Try and find a copy of Norton\'s "The Sioux Spaceman" for a story that

If I had a *good* reason. I know enough history to be *real* leary of
that sort of tampering. Too much sufferring has been caused by people
with good intentions trying to "help" natives. That\'s one of the
reasons the third world is in such a mess.

Interesting bit of data from folks trying to "correct" the problems.
It\'s easy to get the natives to adopt medicine, because the results are
obvious, and it almost never runs into any cultural taboos. But trying
to get them to adopt birth control, or even switch to crops that will
do a better job of supporting them, and they will *not* do it. Birth
control won\'t sell because the culture has it ingrained that you need
all the kids you can have, just to have enough survive to take care of
you when you get old. Even though modern medicine changes that, the
*culture* sees no point in changing. The new crops look different, have
to be planted and cultivated differently, and harvested and prepared
for eating differently. Again, they aren\'t interested.

Even in the middle of a *famine* it\'s not at all uncommon to have
perfectly good food thrown away or wasted, because it\'s not "normal"
food. A lot of "aid" has that happen to it.

It\'s not necessarily that the natives are *stupid* (though the lowering
of intelligence caused by long term borderline malnutrition may pay a
part). It\'s that these cultural values evolved over centuries as the
result of learning the *hard* way what did and didn\'t work.

It\'s *way* too easy to have things backfire. At least until the culture
gets to a medieval or later *social* level. As you note below, it\'s
hard to underestimate the contariness of people.

>>If the ship\'s library is intact, they *will* have more knowledge than I do.

>impromptu colony.

No. Depending on the local conditions they could have a *real* hard
time of it. But if they are to have *any* chance of long-term survival,
the air has to be breathable, the water has to be somewhat drinkable,
and available in reasonable quantities. And edible plants/animals have
to be available fairly close to the landing site.

Ever had any survival training? I\'ve had *some*, not a full course, but
enough to know just how much hassle is involved. On the other hand, if
you aren\'t *too* picky, there are lots of edible critters out there.

>But that objection is easily disposed of: Have the ship
>just barely make it to the ground.

So they don\'t have the power plant? Do realize that if there aren\'t at
least a few weeks worth of food onboard (even if it\'s some pretty awful
emergency rations) then the odds of surviving are just about zip. It
takes *time* to see if plants are edible, and even longer with animals.
Especially given the wide variations possible between planets. You are
very lucky if you managed to test one item per *day* per person you can
*spare* to do the testing.

Quite a lot. They\'d be down to paleolithic levels in no time.

Compare them to what it costs to move stuff inside a system. *IF* you
have to go to one of the other planets for it, it\'s easy to use solar
sails, or even "mass driver" tugs to start the cargo towards the
destination, and the same to capture it at the other end. So it takes a
year or two. The ore/ice/whatever doesn\'t care. And the costs are very,
very low.

If you can find it on-planet, then costs are pretty cheap too.

But it\'s *also* cheap to *import* the fusion reactor, techs, etc and do
it in your system. In case you haven\'t noticed, nations on earth don\'t
like being dependent on outsiders for anything critical. Expecting
*planets* to feel differently is ignoring human cussedness.

I deliberately went "high" on that figure. Depending on the tech level
the population *wants* a colony as small as a few *thousand* could be
viable. Picture a colony set up by the Amish... :-)

You really don\'t need *that* much machinery to have "few hundreds"
feeding "a million". And it *will* be repairable locally. Take a look
at the mid 19th century. Farm machinery had come into being, but was
still mostly animal "powered".

Fertilizer is *not* a problem if you design the sewage system properly.
One of these days, I\'m going to get brave enough to buy a tilipia(sp)
at the local store and see how they taste. They are a "designed in"
part of the integrated sewage systems being designed these days. You
run the sewage thru very minimal treatment and then into a series of
ponds and marshes. The plants in the firsty few lock up things like
toxic metals, and break down the organics. The last few are used for
raising fish (the tilipia) and edible water plants.

You can even recover some of the "metals" by harvesting plants in the
primary ponds and burning them. The ash will be enriched enough to be
processed (though only if you *really* need to do so).

It doesn\'t take many people to handle this part of things. Others will
be doing normal farming,. and that will probably use fertilizer
produced from the waste in process the fish and plants. They\'ll keep
you from getting tired of fish, rice, and whatever. :-)

The 23 is a better number for the whole of "known space"!

Depending on tech level, hundreds and thousands *can* be indigenous.
Remember, the population on Earth only hit a million in the last
thousand or two years. Back when we were primarily hunter/gatherers the
population was quite likely in the tens of thousands. And there was a
point *somewhere* in the last couple of million years when the
population was in the dozens...

See above.

Also, you are ignoring a somewhat more likely possibility. For worlds
with relatively low populations and a "low" tech level, it\'s possible
that they are colonies created by "back to nature" types. Sort of like
the communes so common in the late 60s and early 70s.

This gives interesting possibilities. They may *actively* not want high
tech.

It\'s not *that* big, and the odds against a "mining camp" surviving are
pretty slim. Especially given that reavers *do* have some brains. About
six months to a year after knocking off the staging base, they\'d figure
that the mine would be easy pickings...

Just *how* belivable they need to be can vary. It can range from
"humans in alien costumes" level seen in most of Star Trek to the
fairly well worked out stuff of C.J.Cherryh, Poul Anderson, and Gordon
Dickson. Note that all three of them seem to take the same approach.
Dickson has been pretty explicit about it, Anderson has dropped some
hints, and I have strong suspicions that Cherryh does what they do.

Study some terran animal that is at least *somewhat* social, and base
your aliens on that. Most of that sort of work is found under
"ethology", though some is under anthropology. You get reactions that
"make sense" but *only* if your players can twist their viewpoint
around the right way. You, having the researcher\'s conclusios in front
of you have no such problem. :-)

BTW, iyt can get a bit scary when you *do* manage to "warp" your head
around to see things from the alien viewpoint. Being able to "think
like a kif" was interesting, but not something I\'d want to do very
often!

Don\'t forget that you have much the *same* cost for *producing* the
food "on site" as at wherever the shipper gets it. Add in the extra
layers of "middlemen" (shipping brokers, wholesalers, etc) involved in
the longer trip. Figure a 10% "charge" for each layer.

Oh yeah. The *real* killer on some of this. How many foods *can\'t*
handle sitting around for a week? or Two weeks? So if you want *fresh*
food, it *has* to be produced locally. Damn little produce will handle
two weeks of shipping all that well. Meat will have to be frozen. Etc.

And I\'m sure Europe has the same sort of advertising campaigns we keep
seeing "Buy Oregon fryers, they\'re fresher", and all the other
exhortations to buy from local suppliers.

>>Miners and small research groups do ok on shipped in food.

A couple of hundred *aren\'t* going to survive if the place isn\'t
self-sufficient to at least *some* extent. How long would the bases on
Antartica survive if contact was cut off?

Now, compare that with someplace like the Falklands, or some of the
small islands that have bases/research outposts on them. If it\'s
possible to raise some food there (or collect it), they *will* do it,
simply because it gives some variety over canned goods, and gardening,
hunting, or harvesting wild fruits/vegetables is something to *do* in
your off time (ie it alleviates boredom).

And consider that since ships are not merely the *fastest* but the
*only* means of communication, that\'s another reason for trying to find
a local source of food. You can\'t call for help if there\'s a problem.
It also wastes *time* having "too frequent" supply runs. Even if a
scout can carry a month\'s supplies for them, how much does it cost to
operate the ship for the two weeks & two jumps involved? If it\'s a
bigger ship, the costs get *worse*, not better.

Yeah, but I\'m pointing out that given several *years*, a ship could
rebuild almost anything. Rebuilding the jump drive might be a stretch.
But it might be doable too.

True, which is why I\'d be trying for fixing the ship *first*, then if
that looks out of reach, you look at the resources you\'ve located, and
figure on what ought to be a "sustainable" tech level. You can *try* to
keep the ship going, but it\'s true that sooner or later *something*
would break that you couldn\'t fix (though it\'s possible that you could
build *past* that point if you got lucky on finding ore deposits and
the like).

But assuming a few hundred people, I see no reason for the
"sustainable" tech level to be much below 19th century. And a lot
*higher* in spots.

The idea is that you use the ship to help make the things you need to
make what you don\'t have.

ps. the heck with nanotech. We are approaching the "3d reproducing
pantograph". That is, a gizmo that you feed the CAD/CAM files in,
supply it with raw materials, and it makes the gizmo, all in one
"operation". Quite likely assembling it at the molecular or atomic
level by something that resembles "molecular beam ion implantation" the
way that technology resembles spray painting.

That\'d screw up a lot of traveller too. :-)

    'body' => 'Hi. One of the things that\'s really fun about the Traveller Universe is the
multitude of different quirks, systems and milieus that must be explained by
the creative (or not so creative) referee. I\'ve really enjoyed reading about
the Hiroshi-as-fascist conspiracy as an excellent example of a creative
theory that explains one quirk in a Universe which is almost as difficult to
understand (sometimes) as the real one we live in.

I probably won\'t adapt Phil\'s particular example into my own campaign,
as it wouldn\'t jibe very well with some of my own particlar "historical"
theories and rationalizations which I have been developing in my 17 years of
playing CT. But what I liked about it was the way Phil McGregor was
motivated by the need for a rational explanation for a strange aspect of the
CT Universe.  This same motive is what had driven me in my own developement
of the "history" of known space. (That\'s CT\'s known space, not L.Niven\'s.)

Right from the outset of playing Traveller, I was struck by several
hard-to-understand "facts" that needed rationalizing:

1)The Imperium is a feudal society. How can this be?

2)There is an immense range in TL from world to world. Hctb?

3)Technology has advanced very slowly over the last 35 centuies.

4)The trade rules make no economic sense (assuming a free market
economy).

5)300,000 years ago, the ancients knew which races (the six major
races) were going to get the jump (or should I say Jump-Drive) on their
competitors. We can surmise that this fact is true from the presense of the
Droyne, Humanity, Centaurs, Hivers, Vargr, and Aslan on their 3000- century
old coynes. (See Adv. 3, Twilight\'s Peak)

6)Devices such as jump drive, anti-gravity and black globes are
magical; they break well known laws of physics. They are also isolated.
Whatever science went into making them has not impacted technology in a wide
range of applications; magic does not commonly occur in CT outside of these
three inventions. (Let me ignore psionics at the moment.)

7)Why would the Imperium be so interested in settling the Spinward
Marches, which is on the other side of the great rift in enemy territory,
when there\'s all this empty territory rimward? The main thrust of Imperial
expansion was spinward even before the Solomani Rim seceded from the
Imperium. (Perhaps this was one of the Solomani motives for doing so.)

I\'ve made up a "history" that explains these seven "facts" in a
somewhat rational manner. And which jibed with all the Traveller
Canon I knew about until the DGP adventure on Kyusu. And here it is...

3000 centuries ago, after all his descendants were dead, Grampa knew
which species were going to get the jump drive because he knew which systems
he had left jump drives lying around in. He also knew that the hundreds of
other intellegent species in known space weren\'t going to make j-drive on
their own. This was because there are no indications in the natural universe
that such a thing as j-drive was at all possible. Therefore it would only be
by way of an amazingly improbable fluke that it could ever be invented
independently by a primative culture. (How exactly Grampa got j-drive is not
important to the history that follows.)

While these six races were learning how to copy Grampa\'s j-drive,
they also learned about his anti-grav. (They didn\'t learn about his black
globes or psionics till later.) These races DO NOT understand the physics of
these devices. Indeed they may not be intellectually capable of ever
understanding them. But they did figure out how to copy them, at least to
some extent.

When the Vilani were expanding and subjugating other races with
their new found technology, they hid from their subject races the fact that
they did not invent j-drive or AG. They used these technologies as proof
that they had Major intellects compared with everyone else. In fact, what
they had was a Major patron. When the other Major races appeared on the
seen, they too maintained this lie. To do otherwise would be to admit
inferiority to the Vilani.

As the Vilani expanded, their j-drive tech leaked to many of the
minor races on their borders, notably to the Vegans, who quickly expanded in
the region just coreward of Terra. The Vilani grew alarmed at the existence
of pocket empires all around their borders, so they began the Pacification
Campaigns. The Vilani used their tightly controlled J-2 technology (the
minor races only had J-1) to military advantage. They absorbed the
subjugated pocket empires, and clamped the borders of civilization shut,
lest technology continue to leak out of their empire.

Of course, they never imagined that other major races might arise,
because they never knew that Grampa had other proteges. Otherwise, they
would have never been so stupid.

And stupid they were, deliberately so. They had it pretty good. New
technology was a risk (it might be leaked out) so they settled for control
instead of growth.

The Terrans found j-drive artifacts in their asteroid belt and soon
after they contacted the Vilani. The Vilani thought they were just another
minor race and tried to absorb them. They did not succeed at first. In fact,
in the early Interstellar Wars, they lost the Vegan Polity, a heavily
industrialized, very high population, former pocket empire that was just
dying to escape the Imperium.

So the Vilani, realizing that they had to defeat the Vegans as well
as the Terrans, began to build a real navy for the first time in 1500 years.
It was a J-1 fleet. No sense in allowing the Vegans to get their hands on
J-2 technology thru captured ships. So the Imperium made a huge juggernaut
of a fleet that was going to roll over the rebellious rimward province. The
only problem was that the juggernaut was outmanoevered and destroyed
piecemeal by the Terran J-2 fleet.

The megacorporations were furious. The incompetent bums in power had
allowed the wolfling Terrans to steal their J-2 secrets! A major power
struggle ensued. The entire rimward province was purged of its incompetent
and treacherous hierarchy. Legions of executives and middle managers were
being put to death. While all this was going on, the Terrans continued to
gain ground as polity after polity quit the empire and joined the Terran
Confederation. The Imperial Navy was in shambles.

After some years, the Imperium stopped its hemorrhaging. It built up
a huge J-2 armada to defeat the Confederation navy and utterly exterminate
all rival possessors of J-2 technology. The armada was promptly destroyed by
the Confederacy\'s J-3 fleets.

Oops. It looks like the Terrans hadn\'t stolen Vilani technology
after all. They had an independent source for their j-drives. In fact, they
had better j-drives than the Vilani now.

It was about this time that the Imperium was contacted by the
agressive and rapidly expanding Vargr who came pouring across the corridor.

It was all over for the Imperium of course. By this time, the major
threat to the Confederation came from within.

The Confederation was ruled by a Security Council made up of 15
Terran nations, and by a General Assembly made up of 150 Terran nations and
about as many Confederation worlds. (One world, one vote, unless you were
Terra of course.) As the decades wore on, this arrangement became less and
less acceptable to the Confederation outworlds who, after all, bore the
brunt of the war.  After a century and a half of war, the Imperium was
conquered, and a debate broke out as to how it was to be administered.

The UN decided that each Imperial world was to get a seat in the
General Assembly. The voice of any single Confederation world would
therefore go from one out of 300 seats, to one out of 9000. The Security
Council remained entirely in Terran hands. (Actually, after an initial
protest, Luna was given a seat on the Security Council too.)

It seems incredible to Imperials today that the UN could expect to
get away with such an insulting decree. It reflected the ridiculously
insular and parochial views which were dominant on Terra at that time.  But
the majority (90%) of the officers and men in the Confederation Navy were
not from Terra. And they simply refused to obey.

Grand Admiral Hiroshi Estigaribia granted complete local autonomy to
member worlds. All interstellar authority was administered by the Admiralty
at Dingir (later moved to Ershur.) There was no bloody coup; there was
simply nothing Terra could do about it.

It was Estigariabia who first coined the term "Solomani" to describe
the rulers of the 2nd Imperium; the term "Terran" had fallen out of favor
with the Admiralty. "Vilani" is a Vilani word meaning "people of Vland."
"Zhodani" is a Vilani word meaning "people of Zhdant." "Solomani" is a
Vilani word meaning "people of peace (s\'lom.)" The term was politically
effective, as it reminded everyone that it was Estigaribia and his people who
ended the Interstellar Wars. The term was originally meant to apply to all
citizens of the new Empire, once their worlds had been officially re-admitted.

Well, as everyone knows, things didn\'t work out as Hiroshi planned.
But before I tell my version of that story, now might be a good time to
reflect on how Terra\'s winning the war with reconstructed grandpaternal
technology affected our culture.

The technology that the asteroidal archeologists had uncovered was
of immense military significance. Even before contact with the Vilani,
anti-gravity revolutionized the way wars were fought, and later, the way
people lived. After contact with the Vilani, it was the archeologists who
won the wars for us, in a much more striking (and important) way than
physicists had won wars in the previous centuries. After all,
archeologically related technology had saved our culture from extinction,
whereas physics related technology (it could be argued, and was) was darn
near guilty of complicity in our nuclear destruction.

Also, physics was seen, at that time, (rightly or wrongly) as a dead
science. Breakthroughs were quite rare in the 22nd century. And researchers
were discouraged. Physicists had told us everything they could about the
natural world, it seemed. And so it was, that among the military, the movers
and the shakers, and even among those intellectuals who knew about the
significance of the Ancients, Archeology replaced Physics as the Queen of
the Sciences. Most future technological advances, it was to turn out, would
come from Archeology.

Hiroshi\'s heirs were to invoke his name, and crown themselves
emperors of the Ramshackle Empire. The flag officers of the new empire, who
were in charge of all interstellar management, evolved into a feudal
nobility.  This nobility was not heriditary at first. But the opinion of
many of the naval officers was that the Vilani, as a race, were incapable of
self governance. High appointments were restricted to "genetic" Solomani. (a
social fiction - most Solomani genes were a mix of Terran DNA and that of
other minor races and various Vilani minorities who fought for the
Confederacy) In regions where genetic Solomani were rare, positions, quite
naturally, stayed in the family. In the rimward regions, a "tradition of
democracy" (if not democracy itself) and fraternity and equality lingered
for much longer.

Feudalism worked like this: Due to Hiroshi\'s decree, the barons did
not regularly have direct legal authority over the worlds they were given
charge of. So the barons established starports, where they could regulate
(and tax) interstellar trade. There was one starport per barony, and the
baron was entitled to a cut of anything going between his barony and
offworld. These starports were extraterratorial, the worlds themselves had
no control over them. If merchants tried to bypass the starports, they were
guilty of breaking interstellar law (which was legistlated by nobles) and
had their contraband confiscated, at the very least.

Baronies were grouped into marches, presided over by a marquis.
Marches were grouped into counties, and counties into duchies. Each duchy
was presided over by a Duke, who in turn presided over his counts and
marquises as they met in conclave to decide on the regulations that governed
trade and tariff between the baronies, and, incidently, to determine their
own cuts. The bounderies of the duchies were set by the Admiralty; they
normally coresponded to subsector boundaries.

In return for all this taxation and regulation, the nobility
provided for protection from pirates, maintainance of the spaceways, and the
keeping of the peace.

Of course, the nobility did whatever they could to expand
interstellar trade, and their cuts, as much as they possibly could. This
meant using the forces of interstellar economic competition (which they had
entirely on their leash) to encourage the worlds not to become too self
sufficient. One common example of this is reflected in the diverse TL\'s
within the Imperium.  A world rich with natural resources was discouraged
from developing high-tech industry. It therefore must import its technology
(of which the nobles get a cut) in exchange for its raw materials (of which
the nobles get a cut.) As long as the nobles keep their subjects secure and
well fed (as opposed to angry and rebellious) they can keep on skimming off
of the interstellar economy, upon which everyone, gentle and common,
depends.

This system of feudalism was to survive the long night more or less
intact. It was maintained in slightly modified form by Cleon I when he
declared himself ruler of the 3rd Imperium 2000 years later. Cleon was,
after all, a noble himself. He built the power of his empire on three
pillars:

I)The gentry. All imperial nobles swear fealty directly to His Majesty
the Emperor as well as to his own immediate liege. The emperor is entitled
to some taxes from his vassels. He regulates trade between duchies
(subsectors) through his Minister of Trade, whom he personally appoints.
The Ministry of Trade maintains a system of courts through which the peerage
may appeal for judgements of trade matters above the conclave level. These
judges are given non-heriditary, titular patents of nobility, so that they
may stand in rank with the plaintiffs they judge. These appointments are
made by His Majesty himself, or by one of his viceroys, subject to his
approval.

The nobility maintain the subsector navies, which keep the spaceways
open, and defend the realm. They are kept in line by the Imperial Navy\'s
sector fleets, whose assets are sufficient to put down the occasional
subsector rebellion.  The Imperial Navy is the personal property of His
Majesty. In wartime, it takes direct command of the subsector navies.

II)The worlds. The world governments swear fealty directly to His
Majesty. They are given complete independence in their internal affairs.
Even nobles are bound to obey their laws, although a noble does have the
right to have his case tried by an Imperial Court, before a jury of his
peers.

The worlds have their own military forces. In war time their navies
serve under the Imperial Navy (as their oath of fealty requires.) They
contribute a fraction of their military budget to the subsector Duke and the
Emperor for the maintainance of the interstellar military.

The huge populations of many of the worlds give the Emperor his most
powerful tax base. He is often a jealous protector of his worlds\' rights
against the nobility. This sometimes involves granting patents of nobility
to a world\'s rulers, so they can stand in rank with the peers and be heard
during subsector conclaves.

III)The Megacorporations. The Emperor grants certain companies, at his
pleasure, Imperial Charters. These charters, among other things, give a
company the right to move its property from one world to another without
paying interstellar taxes to the regional nobility, as long as the move is
not made with the purpose of retail sales. This right allows Megacorps to
amass large manufacturing plants on the surface of a world without paying
alot of overhead to the local nobility. These charters are not lightly
granted. (His Majesty does not normally make a policy of pissing off his
nobles.) Getting a charter for a company generally involves giving the
Emperor a fair chunk of its holdings. Charters are a way the Emperor has of
managing his interstellar wealth independently of the gentry.

----

OK. Feudalism is complicated, so it took alot of explaining. Most
people on this list will be horrified by my description of the 3rd Imperium.
(It\'s SO midieval!) You are probably used to thinking of the Imperium as the
Good Guys. But I subscribe to the old description of the Imperium as being a
corrupt and declining and incredibly bloated interstellar state. This
description is found in Adventure 1: Kinunir. (After all, that\'s where I
first heard of the Imperium!)

The emperors of the 3rd Imperium are elected by the Imperial Senate.
Senators are appointed for life by the Emperor. He can appoint absolutely
anyone he wants, but he usually appoints prominant members of powerful
families, major cultural figures, or religious authorities. These
appointments are NOT hereditary. The Senate has the power to counsel the
Emperor, and to elect his successor. In practice, they almost always elect
his chosen heir.

The Senate is Cleon\'s major contribution to civilization. It
provides for a uniform means of succession to the throne. Lack of such a
means, you may recall, was the single most important factor in the 2nd
Imperium\'s fall.

I based my conception of the Imperial Senate on my limited knowledge
of the old Byzantine Senate. I made it up before I ever heard of the Moot.
The Byzantine Empire has been a major inspiration to what I\'ve written
above. It too was based on trade, and it too was corrupt, declining and
bloated!

Well OK, lets look at my scorecard:
1)The Imperium is a feudal society. How can this be?
-Imperial feudalism mooches off of interstellar trade.

2)There is an immense range in TL from world to world. Hctb?
-The nobles interfere with "normal" technological
developement.

3)Technology has advanced very slowly over the last 35 centuies.
-Physics ran out of social steam.

4)The trade rules make no economic sense.
-It\'s a command economy. Of course it makes no sense.

5)Foreknowledge of the Six Major Races.
-None of them are Major, according to the Library Data
definition. They\'re all proteges of Grampa.

6)Devices such as jump drive, anti-gravity and black globes are
magical.  Whatever science went into making them has not impacted technology
in a wide range of applications. Magic does not commonly occur in CT outside
of these three inventions.
-Basically the magic devices don\'t have lots of applications
because they\'re voodoo technology. The engineers
who build them don\'t know how they work. And nobody
thinks that\'s strange anymore.

7)Why would the Imperium be so interested in settling the Spinward
Marches, which is on the other side of the great rift in enemy territory,
when there\'s all this empty territory rimward? The main thrust of Imperial
Expansion was spinward even before the Solomani Rim seceded from the
Imperium. (Perhaps this was one of the Solomani motives for doing so.)

Allright, I haven\'t answered that one yet. Here goes.

Early on in the developement of the 3rd Imperium, archeologists in
the Scout Service noticed that the "center-of-gravity" of the distribution
of Ancient sites was located on the opposite side of the Great Rift. Fearful
that the Zhodani might settle the area first, the emperors pressed hard to
settle the Spinward Marches. And they were well rewarded; Black Globes were
discovered there. The emperors are very possesive of Ancient artifacts.
Basically, His Majesty is the only person legally allowed to own one.

So the Imperator of the Third Imperium has traditionally followed
the footsteps of the Fuhrer of the Third Reich; he\'s a big collector of
magical relics from throughout the world/known-space. He believes that
control of such relics will give him power to rule over mankind. And in the
case of the emperor, he may be right.

Well, I guess this post is long enough now. I hope this inspires
more creativity of the type that Phil showed in his posts. I love stuff like
this! Please make lots of comments about this.

By the way Phil, I think the plague of Duskir was detailed in
"Solomani and Aslan." It didn\'t break out until after the Solomani
conquest. It was a factor in the fall of the Ramshackle Empire, not the
1st Imperium.

1.  I think that the point that is being made is that overwhelming
quantitive superiority will defeat technological superiority, and with a
terrible cost.  Take the Eastern front during WWII.  The Wehrmacht was a
technologically superior superior and much better trained force than the Red
Army.  The Red Army, however, was HUGE.  It is estimated that the Germans
killed some 20 million Soviets.  Losses like that would have bled most
countries white.  The Soviets just absorbed the losses and keep on fighting.

Not really on topic but:
2.  The Allies won for many reasons, air power was one of them.  As for the
Allies having better planes I guess that it depends on your definition of
better.  Both sides had excellent aircraft.  Air power alone cannot win a
war against a determined enemy.  You need an army to go in and take ground,
and in many cases a navy to control the seas as well.

Much of this is understandable if you remember that communications
is no faster than travel and it takes on the order of a year for
ships/messages to reach the frontier from the capital.  For these
reasons the Imperium is in a very similar situation as that faced
by the Roman and Spanish Empires.

>1)      The Imperium is a feudal society. How can this be?

It is forced by the fact that time delays are too large for direct
rule.  Fuedal systems arrose to handle such forced decentralization
while maintaining central athority.

>2)      There is an immense range in TL from world to world. Hctb?

We have an immense range from continent to continent (and even withing
continents).  Look at Africa.   And we have much faster trade and
communications between parts of the world than the Imperium has
between systems.

>3)      Technology has advanced very slowly over the last 35 centuies.

This takes a presumption that the modern western attitudes toward
technology and change is a passing one.  This is not that far fetched.
The concept of "progress" is one that sets western attitudes apart
from most historical cultures.  If you look at Ancient Greece, the
Roman Empire, several Chinese Dynasties, you see cultures that
could have made major technological changes and simply chose not
to.

>Marches, which is on the other side of the great rift in enemy territory,

The Spinward Marches aren\'t "in" enemy territory.  They were settle
because they were mostly unclaimed and undeveloped.  When Imperium
settlement in that direction ran up against Zhodani settlement
coming from the other direction, Imperial Expansion mostly came
to a halt.  Is the Imperium all that "interested" in the
Spinward Marches?  I don\'t see that they get any attention
disproportionated to their situation.

>The main thrust of Imperial
>expansion was spinward even before the Solomani Rim seceded from the
>Imperium. (Perhaps this was one of the Solomani motives for doing so.)

I don\'t agree.  When the Solomani Sphere was part of the Imperium
there was significant expansion.  Now, expansion in that direction
is blocked by the Solomani (who are still expanding).  The Imperium
expanded into the Spinward marches because there was no barrier
to doing so, and stopped when the Zhodani put up a barrier.

  Leadership yes, training no - Southern advantages had more to do with
superior battlefield direction.  As far as equipment goes, the South was
able to maintain battlefield parity in weapons until fairly late in the
war.  This was due to a combination of pre-war planning (Seccesionists
stocked Southern armories and funded a manufacturing plant i Virginia),
purchases in Europe, and arms and artillery captured from the Union.

  Actually, I\'ve seen it argued that the North could have won much
earlier if they had taken advantage of the new cartridge firearms earlier
in the war.  Conservatism in the procurement department prevented the
early fielding of large number of rapid-firing arms that would have given
Northern units a firepower advantage.  The South would have been unable
to match the Union\'s advantage due to lack of manufacturing capacity.

  Very true.  I recently watched the Frontline documentary on the war,
and it was clear that the Army, haunted by visions of a second Vietnam,
wanted no part of a march into Iraq.

  Boiling is used for two things in the fermentation process.  In beer
preparation (grain fermentation), boiling water is added to other water
in certain proportions to get the proper temp for the extration of sugars
through enymatic extraction.  Second, boiling is used to sterilize the
mixture prior to adding yeast.  Neither is necessary for fermentation -
there are plenty of bugs in the air that will make alcohol for you.
Problem is the other tastes you get.  The Sumerians made beer by tossing
a loaf of bread in a pot of water and waiting a week - tastes weird but
it\'ll get you drunk.  Oh, the above applies to fruit-based alcohol (wine)
as well.

  But you can carve with stone tools - the Pyramids were built with flint

  I seem to recall that in interviews, Marc Miller has atributed this to
the comunications limitation imposed by the jump drive - long delays in
command and control favor feudalism.

  As long as one assumes it reflects local ability to produce products,
no problem.

  This assumes that progress from tech level to tech level is linear and
each level takes the same amount of time.  it took lots of time to get
from 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 - why not long times for say 12 to 13?

  Well, the game would not be Traveller without jump drive, and the other

  This is the one point where you have something.  Vargr suppression is
my explanation, but who knows?

  By the way, we know that the Aslan did not discover J-drive themselves
- they got it from the Solomani.  Unless you figure Granfather arranged
that, well, it think it causes a bit of a problem with your theory.

Okay, here\'s a TL point for you all from a lurker (myself).   The
closest star to our planet (Earth) is Proxima Centauri at about 1.3
parsecs; the next closest star, Barnard\'s Star, is 1.8 parsecs away.
Now, from a strict constructionist POV, Earth achieves a Jump1 drive at
TL 10, which allows for one parsec jumps, but can\'t GET anywhere.  If you
jump towards Proxima Centauri, you come up just over a light year short
with a Jump1 drive.  Even if you are generous with the rules, a light
year is by no means a short distance.  According to the timeline in the
TNE main book, Terrans encounter the Vilani at Barnard\'s Star (1.8pc or
Jump2 away) 9 years after just _discovering_ jump drive.  That TL
progression seems a little speedy to me, considering how long it took
aviation technology to bridge the oceans, for example.  Kind of throws a
wrench into abstracted tech level definition.  If Barnard\'s Star was
another parsec in either direction, tech level would have been radically
different.

Just some thoughts.

For the most part, I\'ve ignored this debate about reasons for the fall of
the ziru Sirka, but what do you mean by "Vilani divisiveness"?  I have
always had the impression that the Vilani were the least divisive, most
co-operative Human race there was.  They make the mythical "Japan, Inc."
look like a Vargr frat party!  If you mean that non-Vilani would have been
happy to see anybody esle in charge, and would serve as a "fifth column", I
could buy *that*, but say it if that\'s what you mean.

While I\'m on the subject, why have all the historians of the future ignored
the Vargr?  They never took over the Imperium (they couldn\'t have and didn\'t
want to), but I\'m sure it didn\'t help the Vilani to have to fight wars on
opposite ends of their empire.

Not that any of this matters.  The Ziru Sirka fell, The Rule of Man replaced
it, and then the Long Night followed.  That\'s all that matters for me and
the game.

Let me just start by saying that I have never actually *played* 2300AD; I\'ve
only read the books and some adventures.  Therefore I don\'t have much
opinion on lots of practical issues.

The thing I like the best is that it has a very "hard science" feel to it.
There\'s no grav vehicles or artificial gravity in ships or "black globes".
Just about the only thing that works like "magic" is the stutterwarp, and
you\'ve gotta get past lightspeed *somehow*.

I also liked the aliens--what we know of them.  The Kafers and the Ebers are
both wonderfully detailled and *truly* alien, but it\'s a little frustruating
not to know more about other races, such as the Sung.  Also, there are
details that I\'d like to have on those races in game terms that just aren\'t
available--e.g. how equivelant characteristics such as strength compare to
those of Humans.  On the other hand, if there\'s information on the market,
players as well as referees will buy it, and alot of the mystery could be
lost (witness the case of the Droyne/Ancients in Traveller). Also, since the
aliens in 2300 are *so* alien, it\'s real work to figure out ways for them to
interact with Humans (with the exception of the Kafers, of course).

Then there are the ships.  I like what\'s in the basic set in terms of
describing ships, but it\'s not enough.  As an old _Traveller_ player, I look
forward to designing my own ships and would like some idea of how to come up
with deckplans for when they\'re needed.

The world generation system is absolutely ingeneous.  I love it to death.
It gives the characteristics that you need for a frontier world right away
(unlike _Traveller_ which is good for describing settled regions of space).
Also, I liked the way animal encounters were set up--making sure that
animals wouldn\'t be in locations that couldn\'t support them.

That\'s about all I can think of... right now.  Thanks for letting me sound
off; please forward to any relevant groups.

Thanks for a nice analysis.  I don\'t buy the all of the details
necessarily, but the overall premise -- that the Third Imperium is every
bit as corrupt as any other huge, old, government -- matches the tone of
my own Traveller universe very well, and I think that many of your points
are well taken -- especially the underlying reason for the
extraterritoriality of starports.

Re tech vs. mass

Let\'s not forget the recent experience of the United States in Vietnam and
the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.  The military forces of the US and USSR
indisputably had significant technological superiority during the entire
period of engagement, yet could not defeat the indigenous forces.  Factors
contributing to this result included, in no order, (1) superpowers\' lack
of domestic support for the war effort, (2) superpowers\' lack of clearly
articulated military and political goals, (3) indigenous forces\' ability
to retain local support and to "occupy the moral high ground" at home and
abroad, and (4) superpowers\' inability to use their technology -- designed
for superpower vs. superpower conflicts -- effectively.

As to mass, I don\'t think that either side necessarily outnumbered the
other in those wars (NVA/VC vs. USA/other SEATO/ARVN: those were probably
pretty close; does anyone have the numbers?  Likewise, the Red Army
devoted large forces to Afghanistan, but I don\'t have the numbers on each
side).

Maybe these have some application in the N Interstellar War situation.
The Ziru Sirka, already tottering and wracked by internal dissension,
lacked the political will to destroy each of its border enemies seriatim,
nor to purge its internal enemies.  The Terrans military and political
leadership was able to convince the populace that the end was at hand
unless everyone pulled together and _produced_ to defeat the evil Vilani.

(It must have been a nightmarish time:  UN Permanent Emergency Regulations
requiring everyone -- except the owning class and certain other elites, of
course -- to work at military production twelve hours per day; suspension
of all due process -- except for the owning class; food rationing, energy
rationing, medicine rationing, net.sex rationing -- except for, well you
know; drug testing to make sure that citizens were not taking prohibited
drugs and were taking required drugs; a lot of "everything not prohibited
is required", in general, except, of course, for the owning class.  This
could be a good era in which to set a Traveller adventure -- sort of a
very black Paranoia.  It\'s no wonder the Solomani are so fascistic in the
57th century.)

>1)The Imperium is a feudal society. How can this be?

I never liked this idea of a fuedal society. It seems to me to one of the
possible systems they could have used for the game. Because communication
times are reduced to travel times and some reaches of the Imperium are great
time distances from the core a large degree of autonomy exists in sectors,
subsectors and systems. To hold the Imperium together under such
circumstances would require a strong sense of duty to the Capital. Leaders
that owed their legitimacy to the Capital and the Core would provide this
sense of duty and would act to ensure their sphere of influence was
maintained within the fold of the Imperium. Democratic leaders on the other
hand who owed their legitimacy to the people or citizens of their sector,
subsector, and system, would have little sense of duty to the Capital in a
situation of large communication times with the Capital.
I guess that is how it is justified and maintained.
How it started, I have no idea. I too think it is kind of odd.
>
>2)There is an immense range in TL from world to world. Hctb?

I had a problem with that one for a while also. I still do a little. If you
think of TL as a measure of availability than of anything more substantial.
TL could be explained by a number of things. What explanation you give to
players for the TL of a particular world depends very much on what the other
indicators are for that world.
>
>3)Technology has advanced very slowly over the last 35 centuies.
>
>4)The trade rules make no economic sense (assuming a free market

Each world has its own regime and this determines how that world relates to
any supposed interstellar markets.
Also, because communication time is equal to travel time the type of free
market we think of today is hardly relevant. The best approx is
pre-telegraph times on Earth where communication times were the same as
travel times over large distances. Over short distances signalling by flag,
fire or light was used but over long distances communication time is pretty
much the same as travel time.
In circumstances where communication times are close to travel times and
those times are large, the structure of business would be a lot like the
grand English and Dutch East India Companies and the Hudson Bay Company.
That is how I like to think of trade in the Traveller environment and have
found that reading about these great trading companies and their rivalry has
given me a good feel for how to run it in the Trav universe.

I agree and believe that it is left like this to avoid unnecessarily
complicating the fundamentals of the game. There is plenty of scope for
individual referees to take up the task of incorperating the further
implications of these technologies in their own senarios. In my experience
it hasn\'t really been a problem. I would simply let it be known to the
players that it was commonly rumoured that research into the full potential
and other uses of those technologies was well underway in secret facilities
on many high-tech worlds. Authorities deny this of course.
 Make it seem like there are many things that appear as magic in the
universe that can really only be explained by a few scientists and other
people capable of seeing the wiring under the board. Players hate that - I
like to think of it as the "Call of Cthullu" or "X-files" effect.

    'body' => 'Someone noted that the Tasmanian Aboriginies were wiped out by a mixture of
being hunted down and disease, the latter mainly while in what he called
"concentration camps". Well, so what? The people in question were even more
primitive than the mainland aboriginies, and, IIRC, it was at one stage (and
may still be, I don\'t know offhand) regarded that they were wiped out on the
mainland *by* said mainland aboriginies.

They were a *stone age* people. We know that the Vilani were "backward"
*compared to the Terrans* in their medical technology. Nowhere does it say
that they were the equivalent of TL0 in medical technology! In any case,
AFAIR, the last aborigines in question died out as much because of neglect
*and the destruction of their society* as anything else ... in other words,
it was the *social* impact of the disease and hunting down that did them
in as much as anything else.

Look at the native populations in Mexico as an example of what happens when
your society is destroyed by forces that you do not understand ... you see
the victor\'s society as being superior to your own, and adopt it as yours.
Hence, the adoption of catholicism by said natives and the effective
destruction of almost all traces of the "old" society within a generation
or so. The "wisdom" of the elders is lost, and respect for traditional ways
are lost, the younger generation tend to have a poor self-image, and this
leads to destructive behaviour. Sure, disease may trigger this, but the
real and ongoing killer is, as I pointed out, the lack of care for others
and for oneself that comes with the social impacts of contact between an
advanced culture and a less advanced one. However, you would be wise not to
extend this sort of assumption to the situation of the Vilani and the Terrans.
For a start, there is a maximum of one TL difference between them ... sort
of like the difference between (say) between the 1970\'s (TL8) and the 1990\'s
(TL/9). Significant? Sure! But hardly enough to allow a massive victory if
one side has mass and the other has only a marginal betterment in tech.

Thus, since the Vilani were *not* far behind in tech compared to the Terrans,
there would have been no problem as far as this is concerned ... especially
as, as I have already pointed out, they had, by then, been in contact (and
conflict) with the Terrans since 2096 AD ... some **187** YEARS by the
beginning of said Nth Interstellar War. Surely you would not expect us to
believe that the Vilani were completely unaffected by any Terran originated
diseases during the 187 years, that they learnt nothing from Terran medical
technology as a result, that there were no Terran "mercy missions" to Vilani
planets during that period, when not fighting, in the good old tradition of
the Red Cross/Red Crescent? Come on, guys, by the time of the Nth Interstellar
war the Vilani just weren\'t the sitting ducks to "ordinary" Terran diseases
that some of you seem to think. As for the Plague of Duskir being a biowar
effort, Vilani propaganda pure and simple (the Terrans are pure and the
Vilani are simple) ... it was simply the result of partial societal collapse,
probably disruption of food supplies to isolated and non-self sufficient
colonies, destruction of hygiene facilities etc. that led perfectly ordinary
and normally under control diseases such as Cholera, Typhoid, Dysentery and
the like loose. Nasty, and only possible because of the aftermath of the war
and the fighting.

As for the Gulf War, tech did not win that. What won it was *training* - the
allies had it, and the Iraqis didn\'t. Tech gave the allies an edge, but it
was training that was the killer. The Iraqi soldiers were little better than
partly trained rabble compared to the western and allied forces ... good
enough to stand off Pasdaran (Iranian) "human wave" attacks, but nowhere
*near* good enough to beat the allies. I would say that an equivalent force
of 1970\'s allied troops would have been able to trash the Iraqis probably
just as quickly if they were trained to equivalent standards.

As for quantitative edges beating qualitative edges. I am not aware of any
conflict in modern times that can be said to be a "total war" *and* where
the side with the qualitative edge won against the side with the quantitative
edge.

Take WW2 as an especially good example - the Germans had better plane designs,
they had better tank designs, they had better sub designs ... they even had
better smallarms designs. (Me-262, Me-163, Ar-234 etc for the planes, jets
and rocket powered jobbies; Panthers, King Tigers for the Tanks; Type XXIII
? and Electro-Atlantic U-Boats; MP-43 ... the design of which the soviets
copied as the AK-47, and the MG-42, which the US copied as the M-60) What
they didn\'t have were the *numbers* of those machines of death and destruction
that the west had (or even the western supplied soviets) ... they were always
short of fuel, ammo, and even rifles (I recall that the Supply arm of the
Wehrmacht complained that the loss rate of *rifles* in 43-44 exceeded the
replacement rate to the extent that even existing stockpiles of captured
foreign weapons weren\'t enough to take up the slack ... or soon wouldn\'t
be). The Germans simply couldn\'t compete on a mass basis *at any level*,
they were outproduced and buried by allied industry in the end.

The situation in the Nth Interstellar war must have been very similar. The
Vilani suddenly realised what a threat the Terrans had become, and threw
everything that they had into the fight ... eventually even weakening the
Vargr border to the extent that the said Vargr incursions someone mentioned
took place. But even that wasn\'t enough. The Terrans were able to bury them
with their superior level of production. The Vilani never had a chance,
poor suckers.

(Oh, and note, I\'ve explained quite handily how the Vargr came to be where
they were on the k\'Kree border or wherever.)

And, as I pointed out, the Rule of Man (under the treasonous militarists who
overthrew Terran democratic government with Vilani help and installed the
traitor Estigarribia as Emperor), had from AD 2299 to AD 2742 (some 4 1/2
centuries) to suppress information and falsify the historical and public
record. Any source material that was left probably had a hard time surviving
the ensuing "Long Night" (almost 18 centuries) ... and we know that the
Third Imperium has a long history of suppressing and distorting information.

Ergo, the Terrans *did* beat the Vilani by outproducing them with factory
tech that they had their traitorous Terran militarist allies suppress, and,
so, the Terran *Government* actually *lost* the Nth Interstellar war!

Referee\'s Manual: "Ships of less than 60000 kiloliters (about 4400 displacement
tons) can be completed within 36 months by any competent shipyard. Ships over
60000 kiloliters require from 24-36 moths to complete, based on conditions,
volume of orders, and the degree of haste desired by the ordering government."

"Additional identical ships can be completed in 80% of the original time and
for 80% of the original construction cost."

Book #2: Starships (CTrav): See page 22, a 100 ton hull takes 9 months to
build, 200 tons 11 months, thru to 1000 tons at 27 months.

Book #5: High Guard (CTrav): See page 20, Ships of 5000 tons or less need
no more than 36 months and ships of 5000 tons plus require 24-60 months.

As for how realistic these times are, consider, as I said, the 747. Weighs
around 170 tons. Production time, when geared up? Around a couple or more a
*day*. Do they test each plane off the production line to destruction
before they hand it over to the customer? No. I don\'t know how much testing
it goes through before deliver, a week? Sure, you *might* argue that
Starships are somehow more complex than a 747 ... and you may be right, at
that. However, the problem here is that the quality control and testing
regimes of the shipyards producing them are *also* much more complex. So,
at worst, they have kept pace and the damn thing requires a week or two of
testing, may a couple of Jumps ... certainly no more than a month or so.

Like I said, look at the efforts of the US and allies with Liberty & Victiry
Ships in WW2 ... and don\'t forget that they had similar amazing production
time reductions for warships from DEs through to Aircraft carriers.

Sure, small production runs (like for large military ships) may require
some extra time, but for ships of the 1000 tons or so that most PCs are
going to have some chance of owning, they\'ll be of generic designs and
should take no more than a a week or so to produce. Forex, we *know* that
there are some 30000 Scout/Couriers in service throughout the Imperium, and
1000 in the Spinward marches ... and yet the damn things take 9 months to
build. Nope, sorry, maybe with 1930\'s production techniques, but not with
those of the 57th century.

There is a perfectly good explanation as to how JDrive missiles (2 tons
displacement) can be made to work. The *real* limiting factor was the
minimum size of the Fusion power plants (esp see MTrav, where they\'re
humongous!) - but there\'s no *need* for the Fusion power plants to be on
board the vessel with the JDrive! We know (from a variety of sources, inc.
the "Starship Operator\'s Manual") that the majority of the space allocated
for the JDrive is *not* for the actual drive, but for the extremely high
capacity output fusion reactors to provide the power needed in less than
the handful of hours that the zuchai crystal/energy capacitors can hold
the energy before decaying. The solution? Easy! Use the mother ship\'s JDrive
generators and dump the power into capacitors (see the Black Globe rules
in CTrav and MTrav, as well as in FF&S) on the missile and then launch it.
The actual *active* portion of the missile is probably less than 10% of the
actual generator volume ... even the mother ship\'s computers can be used
to dump in a course tape.

So. There we have it, a reasonable explanation for a Jump Courier Missile!

Surely the jumpdrive is _exactly_ the equivalent of gauss-jammers in terms
of getting people lost who didn\'t want to be.

And Chandler is not the only SF author who uses lost colonies. Bradley\'s
Darkover, Bujold\'s Barrayar, and McCaffrey\'s Pern are/were all lost colonies.
Harry Harryson uses them in "Deathworld 2" and "Deathworld 3" (and arguably
in a way in "Deathworld 1"). Pournelle has them, both in the making and as
such. Piper has a blueprint for how it could happen in "Cosmic Computer"
and a number of them in "Spece Viking". Mack Reynolds has some, though those
are of the voluntarily restrained variety. Vance\'s viewpoint cultures are
mostly high-tech, but his worlds are riddled with old cultures that has
degenerated in one way or the other (And he has one very funny short-story
("The Magicians" ?) where the people maintain the old energy cannon by
polishing the exterior to a fine luster).

Completely irrelevant. Not everybody have the same good sense you have. The
question was wether anyone who wanted to _could_ introduce such technologies.
Motivation is easy enough to provide. If something is a foolish thing to do,
all we need is a historical fool. There\'s no dearth of fools in human

Sure, but it\'s news to me that the agricultural sector was only 0.02 % of
the population in the 19th Century.

Is not! ;-)

I think you\'re letting your enthusiasm getting the better of your good
sense here. You can\'t really mean that you think that a population of
900 or even 9000 sentients can be indigenous.

Make that 10 million shortly before recorded history.

You can\'t be serious.

You talk about propabilities and then blithely suggests that even _one_
planet with a sentient species just happens to be at the point in time
(out of millions of years) where the number is in the hundreds? If you
are serious then say so and I\'ll just drop the argument. This is simply
too silly. I\'d grant you _one_ low-population indigenous species in all
of Charted Space, and even that is bucking the odds (but as I\'ve said,
low odds do come out occasionally).

No, those are much more likely, and I don\'t ignore them. Of course, _you_
are ignoring the possibility of such colonies being cut off during The
Long Night and changing from artificially maintained low tech to the real
thing. This could have happened a lot, if you maintain that such colonies
are common today, since they would propably have been equally common
before The Long Night.

Sharks and minnows. The Reaver fleet that can take on the defenses of a
mainworld wouldn\'t be interested in an odd outpost. Besides, raids on
outposts, colonies and even mainworlds are just the thing to push
societies into decline.

That is debatable, to say the least. There is something called economics of
scale, for one thing. But we don\'t have to argue about it. Just take a look
at the world today. Denmark produce more than enough food to feed all its
citizens. Nevertheless they both export and import food. The solution to
this seemingly paradoxical fact is left as an excersise to the reader.

So you haven\'t done any calculations. Right. Well, let\'s run with your 10%
for a bit. That means that if one planet can produce something 10% cheaper
than another, transport between them makes sense. That\'s well within the
variance (?) you can find between rival food producers on Earth today.

Damn few. I challenge you to name three bulk food products that can\'t take

that can\'t, but I\'m confident that I can name 10 that can for each that
can\'t.

I think things are getting muddled up a bit. We\'re discussing two
different things here. One is how much need there is for interstellar
bulk cargo transport, the other is the likelihood of lost colonies.
You seem to be arguing one way on one subject and the other way on
the other.

You keep making the assumption that everybody will behave rationally and
that everything will go right. I maintain that such is a really poor bet.

But let\'s make a thought experiment. You have a misjumped passenger ship.
The jump drive is slagged (and I mean _slagged_). The ship settles down
on an Earth-prime planet. You have 200 passengers and crew. You have a
minimum survival packet (as required by Rule of Man regulations). (Not
more than minimum, because noone really thought that they would ever
need it, and keeping it fresh costs money. Just be thankful that your
purser hasen\'t sold off most of it (That\'s going to be our next thought
experiment, right? ;-).)

First question: What are your ressources? How much food do you carry? What
other ressources? (Don\'t forget the five tons of mail ;-).

Once the captain has marshalled his ressources and accepted that his yet
unborn children are going to live their life on this planet, what does he
do to ensure them the highest possible standard of living?

A lot of people have been saying that 3D navigation is difficult.
It was so in 2300AD, but only because of the fractional light-year
distances and the fact that you had to know the exact distance to
calculate how fast you could stutter-warp to a destination.  With
Traveller, the problem is made easier because everything is in whole
units:  the maps are in whole parsecs, and so are the jump ranges.  Here
is my system for 3D navigation.  It utilizes hex maps 10 x 10 x 5
parsecs, which look much like old Trav maps, except there is a number
from 1 to 5 in the center of each world symbol representing its
Z-coordinate.
The depth of a subsector map is kept thin to minimize the number
of "overlapping systems" (i.e., one\'s that are "on top" of one another).
The galaxy is obviously deeper than 5 parsecs, but you simply have
different maps representing "layers" of space.  A sector is 4 layers deep
and is 2 x 2 in the x-y plane.  Yes, it is a _much_ larger volume than in
2D Traveller.  A campaign could take place in two subsectors (10 x 10 x
10 parsec volume).

Okay enough background blithering, here\'s how you navigate:

1. Look at the map and count the number of hexes between departure and
destination (just like in 2D Traveller).

2. Take the absolute difference between the departure and destination
Z-coordinates (i.e., the little numbers in the world symbols).

3. Cross reference on the following table:

DISTANCE IN XY PLANE
0123456
----
V S0|0123456
E E1|123456-
R P2|233456-
T A3|344556-
I R4|45556--
C A5|5666----
A T6|6----
L I
  O
  N

The body of the table shows the jump distance (in parsecs) to the
destination.  In this case, it is the euclidian distance rounded up.  If
you want, you could make it the euclidian distance rounded to the nearest
whole number, giving the excuse that jump drives can be "pushed" for an
extra half parsec.  Either way, this is a quick and approximate means of
doing 3D space navigation.

And that\'s all there is to it!  Admitted, this says nothing to the
political and economic problems converting to 3D would cause, but like I
said previously, it might be worth the effort for marketing reasons.
Lots of SF fans will be turned off by the grossly unrealistic concept of
2D space.

like combat intensive role-playing, neither when I am a player nor when I
am the referee (as it often happens).

More importantly, 2300AD was missing the big picture and grand scope
of Classic Traveller. Still, if I had to choose today between a TNE and a
2300AD campaign today I would try 2300AD (and for the same reason..).

One thing I found annoying in 2300AD was the lack of even the most basic
design rules for vehicles and starships in the basic boxed set I bought.
I was very much in favour of the CT philosophy of providing basic design
rules in the standard set and enhanced design rules in a suitable
expansion (especially when the two are compatible..). I also recall that
not much was available on world generation. Both were serious limitations
from my point of view, since I like very much designing
vehicles/starships/etc and also generating worlds.

The fact that starships are a rare commodity in 2300AD is also a limitation.
One runs the risk of reducing a science fiction role-playing to just
an ordinary combat/detective/whatnot  with just better weapons and tools.

As has already been pointed out, you don\'t need to "wipe" anyone out.
A 10% fatality rate is is more than enough to push a wobbly society
over the edge (especialy a technological one).

Even today, the sudden onset of unknown disease can cause problems.  Add
to this the fact that the Vilani were not only less developed in biology
(the implication I had is that they were were we were about the late
1800\'s) but specifically, they entire lacked the basis for forming any
working theory of evolution and genetics.  Finally, the lack of FTL
communication means that word of the plague will have trouble spreading
any faster than the plague itself.

So the idea that a society, encountering a virulent disease from a
source they hadn\'t needed to worry about before (virus\'s), for which
the population has almost no resistance to, for which there is little
or no warning, and for which they have no systematic understanding of,
would be in trouble is reasonable.

>>>1.  I think that the point that is being made is that overwhelming
quantitive superiority will defeat technological superiority, and with a
terrible cost.  Take the Eastern front during WWII.  The Wehrmacht was a
technologically superior superior and much better trained force than the Red
Army.  The Red Army, however, was HUGE.  It is estimated that the Germans
killed some 20 million Soviets.  Losses like that would have bled most
countries white.  The Soviets just absorbed the losses and keep on
fighting.<<<<

  Soviet failure was due to the purges done by Stalin before the war, not
tech inferiority.  The T-34 was the best tank of the war, bar none, and
the KV and JS series of heavy tanks could take on anything the Germans
had at equivalent times (plus their engines ran more reliabley as well).
Soviet Artillery was the best in the world (accuracy and range).  Soviet
small arms were at least as good as the German, plus they worked much
better in extreme cold.  Soviet aircraft were qualitatively equal, though
failure of doctrine and inferior, inexperienced pilots made the Soviet
air force ineffective until late in the war.

  The Soviets, with some lend-lease help, won WWII, and they did it with
weapons evey bit the match for those fielded by the Germans.  Our
perceptions of the Soviet war machine was distorted by the cold war and
the use of German descriptions of eastern front combat.  MAsters of
strategic decit and armed with quality weapons, Stalin\'s legions saved
the West\'s butt.

>>>>Not really on topic but:
2.  The Allies won for many reasons, air power was one of them.  As for the
Allies having better planes I guess that it depends on your definition of
better.  Both sides had excellent aircraft.  Air power alone cannot win a
war against a determined enemy.  You need an army to go in and take ground,
and in many cases a navy to control the seas as well.<<<<

  Allied aircrft destoyed the communication systems and fuel production
facitities of the Germans before the invasion.  After, Allied tactical
airpower made daylight German movements suicidal.  Note the succes of the
Battle of the Bulge, conducted when Allied aircraft were grounded by weather.

>>>>As for the Gulf War, tech did not win that. What won it was *training*
- the allies had it, and the Iraqis didn\'t. Tech gave the allies an edge,
but it was training that was the killer. The Iraqi soldiers were little
better than partly trained rabble compared to the western and allied
forces ... good enough to stand off Pasdaran (Iranian) "human wave"
attacks, but nowhere *near* good enough to beat the allies. I would say
that an equivalent force of 1970\'s allied troops would have been able to
trash the Iraqis probably just as quickly if they were trained to
equivalent standards. <<<<<

  Allied aircraft, like the F-117, enjoyed tech advantages that allowed
the destruction of much of the air defense net operated by Iraq.  Guided
missiles then destroyed much of the Iraqi tank force, as well as
infrastructure and the Iraqi soldier\'s will to resist.  Allied tanks and
artillery routinely engaged and destroyed Iraqi targets at ranges the
Iraqis could not match, due to gun stabilisation, rangefinders, and
depleted uranium projectiles.  Technology counts - training was
important, but superiour tech allowed victory to be achieved far faster
and with far fewer casualties.

  As an aside, a friend of mine was a reserve officer commanding a unit
equiped with M1A1 tanks.  On the gunnery range, they practiced fire only
with the computer fire system turned off ("degraded mode").  Why?  With
the computer on, they hit first time, every time, even with the tank
moving on uneven terrain - not much of a challenge.  Technology _works_,
as long as you train your troops to use it properly.

Yes, it always seemed to me that GDW made these wide variations in TL
to mimic the situation in our world today. But the wide variations we see in
Africa, Oceania, and the Americas today are primarily due to accidents of
history. The Guarani are not very technologically advanced because until
recently they were not exposed to western technology. They are rapidly
learning tho, as are the world\'s other low-tech peoples.

But in CT, by 1104 (the year Adv. #1 takes place) accidents of history
should be, well, history. The Marches have been settled for a thousand
years, and have shared a common history for that long.  There must be
another reason why TL\'s vary so much. In my previous post, I proposed that
it was due to fallout from the feudal political/social/economic system.
A case could still be made for historical reasons, but it would require
an interesting explanation.

I agree completely! That\'s why I took the trouble to rationalize

the one prevalent in the CT universe. Other explanations are possible of
course. YMMV.

Well, I clearly exagerated when I called Deneb "enemy territory."
Still, the Spinward Marches are on the Zhodani Side of the Great Rift.
They are as far away from Sylea as Terra is, and yet they were being
colonized 60 years after the founding of the Imperium. It wasn\'t until
four centuries later that Terra was absorbed.

There are scads of ways of rationalizing this. At first I just told
my players that there had been hostile states between Sylea and the Rim.
But when I read that Ancient sites tended to center around the Spinward
Marches, I saw a way to fit that interesting datum into my overall scheme
of the Imperium. 8^)

Yes, my scenario for the variation in TL implies that the TL is a
measure of implamentation ability, and not discovery. I guess I agree with

High Law Levels, and feudalism to boot! Yes it seems pretty obvious
that the Imperium must have a command economy. The only issue is what form

This is an interesting point. The coynes found in "Twilight\'s Peak"
were 300,000 years old. But the description of coynes given by GDW\'s "Droyne"
alien module seem to say they were a recent invention. Clearly, there is
a contradiction here.

Mark Miller, in an interview in the Digest, mentioned the appearance of
the Major Races on the coynes as a mystery remaining to be solved. (I\'d
love to hear his views on all this!)  This statement seems to contradict the
tidy explanation given in the alien module (no mystery there.)

Yeah, I read that issue of the Digest. I had been lucky in the past;
my version of the Imperium had been entirely compatable with the new "canons"
as they came out. I couldn\'t think of a way to retcon that change tho, so I
didn\'t. I decided I couldn\'t make my universe entirely compatable with
DGP\'s; theirs was just too detailed to jibe in every instance with mine.
(Sorry Roger!) I did manage to use alot of the stuff they published in
"Solomani & Aslan" tho; that was a great module! (But then, they all were.)

the "Starship Operator\'s Manual") that the majority of the space allocated
for the JDrive is *not* for the actual drive, but for the extremely high
capacity output fusion reactors to provide the power needed in less than
the handful of hours that the zuchai crystal/energy capacitors can hold
the energy before decaying. The solution? Easy! Use the mother ship\'s JDrive
generators and dump the power into capacitors (see the Black Globe rules
in CTrav and MTrav, as well as in FF&S) on the missile and then launch it.
The actual *active* portion of the missile is probably less than 10% of the
actual generator volume ... even the mother ship\'s computers can be used
to dump in a course tape.

Well, I think we\'re missing some arguments as to why a jump torpedo
may be feasible.  First, while it may work, it isn\'t exaclty a
guaranteed method.  More than likely, the jump torpedo will have some
sort of computer, a jump drive and jump fuel on it. Now, the same
computer that must do the final jump calculations must also store the
data to be sent.  Granted, could start the calculations on the firing
ship or dump to the torpedo from tape, but the computer on board the
torp is the one that is going to have to actually engage the j-drive.
Now, this is an action that is usually safely handled by your
well-trained engineer, so it almost always goes well.  Leave that hard
work up to just a computer.  Already you can assume that there\'s a
good chance of failure/misjump.

Automated yes, but definitely the best of solutions.  This allows the
j-torp to exist as an emergency messenger service for military ships,
yet because of the randomness of it proves that sometimes it is
important to have people behind the controls.

There are similar accidents of history in the Imperium.

Not true.  The inability of third world nations to keep up, even after
over a century of exposure to western technology, has been a source
of continuing frustration.  This is in the face United Nations (and
other) programs to address just that problem.  Given the Imperium
laise-faire attutude toward local development, backward nations are
faced with same catch-22.  You can\'t afford to import technology
unless you have the technology to make some thing worth while.
(In addition to the problem that, since technolgies are interlinked,
the lack of technolgies cripples your ability to use technologies you
do import).

And part of that history is one of regression and loss of trade.  Also,
large portions of the Spinward Marches weren\'t part of the Imperium
for all the thousand years (a lot of it still isn\'t).  If you add
in Imperial neglect and the fact that trade is restricted to only
those who can afford expensive high tech craft (imagine an African
village that wants to improve itself when everything has be imported
by Lear Jet) I don\'t see a big problem.

Because they were mostly undeveloped.  I see no evidence that coloniztion
was driven by anything more than lack of opportunities elsewhere.

Heh, you should have played in ours - with a little artistic license, the
history of Solomani/Vilani interaction  was begun by intesive infiltration
and surveillance of Earth & colonies circa 2300AD.  Of course, the
infiltration was discovered by some intrepid PC\'s, who were then faced with
the Vilani explaining that the Zhodani were also trying to infiltrate, and
the Vilani were trying to prevent that.  It was an interesting campaign.
Actually started it as a TOP SECRET campaign.  OK, I took some geographic
license too, but it was a fun game.

    'body' => 'I have always seen the fuedal structure as the "space between the stars"
being fuedalized, and the worlds answering to Sector dukes, Subsector
dukes, and local barons and viscounts. Marquis I place over small clusters.
The local naval units answer not to the people, but the nobles; COACC
answers to the local Gov\'t, Navy doesn\'t.

Here is how I run it (all IMNSHO):

Arch Duke: No real power til 1100 or so, then taxation and employment
reforms, as well as trade law reforms implemented by the archdukes. mostly
the emperor\'s stand-ins for negotiations with extra-imperial cultures.
Normally a retirement for an overly troublesome/meddlesome Sector Duke.

Sector Duke: Controls the Sector Naval, marine, Scout, and intelligence, as
well as sector wide trade and safety regulations.

Subsector Duke/Marquis: controls 1 reserve fleet, and collects taxation.
Same kind of trade governance as the Sector level, but more ability to
adapt it to local demands.

Cluster Marquis/count/Viscount: Administers combined actions of local
navies and
 SS navies. May have a localized "cluster fleet" if the duke allows, mostly
for code enforcement. No really big ships, but plenty of couriers and
patrol craft.

System Baron/Viscount/Count: Controls local navy, and taxes local world for
it\'s support. can be crippled by lack of local gov\'t cooperation, but can
blockade the world in that case. In systems with large non-mainworld
populations, will be a viscount or count. Also controls starport, and
regulates in-system travel. Normally leaves the world alone. Most local
world gov\'t heads are treated as Baronettes; they have to answer to the
baron in intersellar matters, and should take his advice on local matters,
but are autonomous of him, provided they pay their taxes, and provide the
required allotment of draftees or volunteers for the Imperial Forces.

I see the taxation as follows:
Secotr taxes subsector rulers, per capita residents. Charges liscence fees
on starships.
SubSector: Taxes either world nobles or cluster nobles, but not worlds
under a cluster ruler. Such taxes per capita resident.
Cluster: Taxes it\'s member world\'s nobles, per capita resident.
Local: taxes it\'s world on a per capita tax, raised by whatever means the
local gov\'t chooses; also places draft minimums into effect, and gets
percentage of profit from starports and spaceports in system, as well as
portion of local ship registry fees.

ANy noble can authorize "imperial corporate entities"; such entities may
conduct buisiness at any world subject to the chartering individual\'s
taxation, whether direct or indirect. Mega Corps are merely liscenced by
the Emperor or an Archduke.

Some sample costs from my GM\'ing habits:

Liscencing a commercial (passenger or cargo vessel): cr2/ton per year.
requires an inspection by naval or scout authorities, normally done during
annual maintenance. cr1/ton that for non-commercial vessels.

System Corp Liscence: cr1000 per year. Pay to the system noble. Negotiate
with local gov\'t for on-world status, though.
Cluster Corp Liscence: cr10000/year Pay cluster nobleman.
SubSector Corp Lisc: cr25000/year
Sector Lisc: cr100,000/year
Domain Lisc: cr 500,000/year
LIC: MCr1 per year. Pay Sector duke in home sector.

All liscences must be accompanied with a minimum 5% share of the company,
in lieu of income taxation. Ship liscencing allows buisiness to be done
without such a charter, although a line must have one.

Spaceman\'s ticket: = Apprentice cr 100/year
                   = Rating Test cr100 pass or fail, per endorsement sought.
                   = Skilled Liscence cr 200/year, any number of endorsements.
                   = Master\'s ticket (required for all commercial vessels in
                     excess of 499 tons) cr 500/year, endorsements for Nav,
                     Pilot, Engineer, Leader, Admin, Legal, and Computer
                     required to attain.

        Endorsements in my MT games: All require level 1 and a routine,
skill, edu, 1/2 hour, safe task. No retries allowed without paying again.
Standard Endorsements: Pilot, Nav, Steward, medical, Gunnery (each
separate), Gravitics, Vacc Suit, 0-G Ops, Admin, Legal, Broker, Ship\'s
Boat, Electronics, Mechanical, Computer, languages(each separate). Ship\'s
Troops rating requires vacc suit 1+, one close combat skill at 1+, and one
ranged combat at 1+, and successful tests in all three; passed tests do not
require retests.

Reading a person\'s ticket makes it one level easier to determine their
skill levels accurately during an interview. It also allows estimation (one
level harder than base) without meeting the individual. Such a ticket is
actually an ID card, with all the usual imperial ID bells and whistles.

Most crews look for ticket holders with the correct endorsements first,
then apprentice tickets and others without the sought endorsement but with
a ticket, and then for non-ticketed persons, whom they can get a ticket for
by the skipper signing for one.

My understanding is this: the coyns were used by the Ancients; they were
*reintroduced* to the "lost colonies" of Droyne by Grandfather, to help
them out. Colonies without coyns are chirpers, as per Research Station
Gamma.

The appearance of major races on the coyns found in Twilight\'s Peak
(which is implied rather than explicit, IMHO) suggests that Grandfather
knew about the existence of all the six "major races" and had a good idea
about their prospects of reaching interstellar civilisation -- he could
probably have done some psychosocial manipulation, like the subtle trick
of leaving war machines all over Vland -- *or* that the Coyns found at
Twilight\'s Peak were left by Grandfather after the end of the Final War.
(Then why didn\'t he destroy the base?) Another possibility is that the
coyns themselves are pyschoactive -- after all, they\'re used in a ritual
which is supposedly psionic in some undefinable way -- and may physically
change to represent the universe around them.

Picture the scene: a Droyne casteing ceremony, and the first coyn pulled
is one that wasn\'t there the last time the coyns were used... bet *that*
one becomes a sport 8-)

and used the initial edition of the \'2300 rules from 1986, when it appeared
in Britain for the first time.  Now Eric Ackermann wrote in xboat digest
511 about a possible future for this RPG given the breakup of GDW, and I\'m
not sure whether this is the right environment for the discussion of this
"other" SF game system but I\'d quite like my (briefish) "deux centimes"
worth, and would love to see it reborn and developed in perhaps more caring
hands...

The second edition rules became available from GDW in 1988 and were IMO a
positive development of one of the fastest, most flexible rule systems I\'ve
ever had the pleasure to use.  Possibly 2300AD found itself swamped during
MT\'s early years, maybe this is just the perspective from this side of the
Atlantic, but 2300 never seemed (certainly in terms of its published
adventures) to capture the full potential of its (almost) believable
"future history" and its hard science background.

Coming from a Traveller campaign I was immediately impressed by the Near
Star Map and associated information.  A 3D universe, at last!  Using the
"physics" of stutterwarp drives, this is how the near stellar neighbourhood
_had_ to be explored.  All games need a fundamental background to provide a
framework (whether it\'s Traveller\'s Imperium/Known Space, Space:1889\'s
Victorian Solar System, or whatever) and the NSM provided just that.  It
would have been good to extend the data well beyond "current Human
exploration" though, (+50 ly?) even if only for Referee\'s additional/secret
information.

I found that ex-Traveller players generally hated the lack of both
artificial gravity and anti-gravity, but it led to vacuum-bound starships
with spin habitats that were definitely "Not Traveller": this of course
forced the concept of "Dispense With All Preconceived SF-RPG Ideas".  This
_could_ be real.  This is how it _might_ really be.  Starship design was
(for me, always has been) fun.  Starship combat in "Star Cruiser" could
feel incredibly realistic.  Stay hidden.  Deploy drones and missiles.  Keep
quiet.  When players become paranoid about potentially successful alien
weapon sensor scans...well, I think that\'s a victory in game design terms.

Again, and recently mentioned in the digest, one of 2300\'s great strengths
were its aliens.  They were all excellent but the Kafers, whilst the most
humanoid, were truly and abominably alien.  Their reasoning was totally
flawless given their background and nature, but utterly foreign to Human
ways of perception.  There could only be the one result.  (And thank
goodness for DunArmCo and their assault shotguns, I often found myself
thinking, as the very corners were rolled off my D10\'s in panic).  (Hey, if
any _real_ aliens monitor the xboat\', it _was_ just a game, you know?)

What didn\'t I like?  Well, I expect that like most readers and contributors
to this mailing list, I enjoy altering, amending and adapting "official"
adventures to fit my players\' situations and my own referee-required goals,
but in terms of the published 2300 adventures, there\'s hardly a one that I
used at any level beyond that of background information.  Does this mean
that novice gamers starting on 2300 used the published adventures and began
to hate the very idea of gaming?  Or perhaps that parsec-weary campaigners
hated 2300\'s lack of any decent, continuing adventures/campaignlets that MT
was then in the process of developing?  I don\'t know the answer to this,
and would really like to know what other 2300 referees think, but it
certainly feels like it contributed to the long-term failure of this
otherwise excellent system.  There was also that bizarre and vast dichotomy
between the cyberpunk and decadent Core-World mindset and those trying to
make a (lower-tech, honest) go of it in the Colonies.  It was neither
"Bladerunner" nor "Optimistic 50\'s Heinlein" enough, and the adventures did
not seem to be capable of suggesting either a generic socio-Human feeling
that could create a link between these two World-views or provide the basis
for (rule-based) "home-brewed" options.  Where was it trying to go?  Did
you just use it as a dead-ended, "Aliens"-esque rules set?  I had to,
finally, and did.  Sure, the one-off adventures I wrote were fun for me and
(I think) the players, but I\'m a campaigner at heart, and 2300 as published
didn\'t seem to be the Universe for that kind of playing.

I regret that 2300 failed in the RPG marketplace.  It had some great
strengths and provided many people with a lot of entertainment.  I don\'t
think I can blame GDW for the demise of the game; maybe it\'s our fault
through lack of player support, but I\'d _really_ like to think of a
positive future for what was often a great system.

*** I\'ve just typed my above feelings to find the
<ad2300-request@mars.galstar.com> mailing list address posted on the last
digest.  Time to monitor that, I think, and I\'ll return to lurking here.

To follow up on a recent comment:

"I\'ve got most of Chandler\'s stuff. Though his stories are (IMHO) are a
lot less like Traveller than (for example) E.C.Tub\'s "Dumarest of
Terra" series (which *has* to be where they got fast drug and slow drug)
And Chandler\'s Universe has a history that was specifically set up to
*make* lost colonies likely. Traveller has nothing equivalent to the
\'gaussjammers\'."

While I agree in general, wasn\'t there a incident involving some
slower-than-light colony ships that provides the background history to
(Classic) Traveller Adventure 5: Trillion Credit Squadron? I seem to recall
some multi-generation colony ships getting lost and developing a thriving
micro-civilization in the sector they ended up in (Far Islands? Books are
home...). A jump-capable ship mis-jumps into the area and they discover it
and start to copy jump technology...

Also, anybody out there ever read Marc Miller\'s description of how to set up
a Traveller game, using his first session of running (Classic) Traveller
Adventure 4: Leviathan? As you may recall, Leviathan was actually written by
the folks of Games Workshop before they were swallowed by the Space
Hulk/Warhammer Monster. Marc got the manuscript (according to the article)
and started running it for the local group. The first planet they came to had
a atmosphere of zero (vacuum) but also had a population! So, he postulated a
lost colony, built along the lines of Fritz Leiber\'s classic SF story "A Pail
of Air" (a must read to show how you could adapt low tech to a vacuum
situation!). He threw in a few interesting tidbits along the way (including
some rather gross creatures), and ta-da! Instant lost colony...

Just to add my 2 cents...
Given the thousands of inhabited systems in the Traveller universe,
potentially each with multiple planets - inhabited or uninhabitable, some
much larger than Earth, etc., I don\'t find it at all unusual that there is a
HUGE variety of technologies spread across them in much the same way that
there will be a HUGE spread of population, history, religion, government,
economy, etc. An entire subsector could be left unexplored for hundreds of
years just because of some adverse encounter by the first explorers, or
because the explorers\' major religion suddenly turned inward and exploration
was frowned upon. Just look at the fight going on today to keep space
exploration funded! Every individual planet will have all the complications
of different atmospheres, flora, fauna, ecosystems, bacteria, etc. against
which any colony must battle to establish itself. Any colony that doesn\'t
reach a given size won\'t be able to support the infrastructures required for
high technology manufacturing, etc. unless they import - and to do that they
have to have something to trade. If you can\'t produce the high tech goods
initially then you have to produce lower tech goods and/or refine raw
materials from the system in which you\'ve settled. Perhaps in a hundred
years time you can grow the population sufficiently to support the next one
or two technology levels. That\'s assuming your populace hasn\'t succumbed to
the new religion which requires only every fifth woman to be allowed to give
birth...

Remember that there are always limitations to ANY system. As a simple
example, apart from jump drive, you can\'t break the speed of light. So radio
communications between two points will never get faster. Perhaps you can
increase the bandwidth to fit in more info, but eventually the whole radio
spectrum fills up (especially given the amount of data transfer that seems
inherent in most futuristic societies).... there\'s always a limit.

So, I can easily see where the diversity of techs, etc. across the Imperium
occurs. However, there are certainly a large number of
difficult-to-rationalise UWPs for many planets. If people can explain tiny
worlds having thick atmospheres, or habital worlds in systems where the
planet should be an iceball or a fiery inferno, then I\'m, sure a few tech
differences can be explained away.

Enough warbling. More work to do. :-(

There are several different sets of coyns. One (or more) are found in Ancient
sites and range in number from 6 to 38 [_Imperial Encyclopedia_ p. 21]. We\'re
not told if there are different sets or wether the smaller sets are subsets
of one standard 38-piece (In my universe I assume they are.) Grandfather
emerged around -75,000 and introduced a 38-piece set of coyns to the fallen
chirper colonies. On some worlds they regained the ability to caste, on
others (like Vanejen) they failed [_Droyne_ pp. 6 and 45]. He reemerged
from time to time and changed the coyns, introducing the Aslan, Hiver, and
K\'Kree coyns (at least) at a later date. [_Secret of the Ancients_ p. 32].

The 36-piece coyn set mentioned in connection with modern Droyne are thus
_not_ the same as the set (or sets) found in Ancient sites. (The Aslan coyn
in "Twilights Peak" is part of a set of fake coyns, not the one found in
the site).

More than a year ago I posted a request for help on this very subject. I did
get a few useful suggestions, but I still need help, so I think I\'ll take
the opportunity to repost my request, since I believe that there a number of
fresh minds have joined us since then. I also think you may find it
interesting, Robert. Apologies to the old hands who\'s seen it before..


----
I\'m doing a \'Secret of The Ancients\' adventure for my players at the moment.
It\'s a different secret than the official one for several reasons; one, that
I don\'t like the whole Grandfather business at all, and, two, that even if I
did like it most of my players know it too, and that tends to ruin their
sense of wonder. And IMO the secret of The Ancients ought to be full of
wonder.

I have, however, tried to make my version fit all the clues left behind. My
Ancients left the universe in much the same state than the GDW Ancients did,
they just went about it differently. So some of he things I work out should
be useful even to those who want to stick with Grandfather and the kids.

At the moment I\'m trying to work out how an Ancient set of coyns looks. We
know the names of the coyns in the set of 36 used by modern Droyne, and
we\'ve been told what some of them looks like. The Ancient set consisted of
38 coyns and some of the older coyns (Aslan, Hiver, K\'kree) cannot be part
of the set.

I\'ve listed the facts I\'ve used (numbered) and the assumptions I\'ve made
(lettered). If anyone can come up with facts I have missed or have some
good ideas, please let me know.

1) Coyn sets found in Ancient sites range in size from 6 to 38 pieces.
   [_Imperial Encyclopedia_ p. 21].

a) The lesser sets found are subset of one standard 38-coyn set, not
   alternate sets.

b) The Ancient coyn set is identical to a pre-Ancient coyn set used by
   pre-Ancient Droyne in prediction ceremonies.

2) Grandfather introduced the coyns as a tool of casting to a number of
   Chirper worlds around -75,000. [_Droyne_ pp. 6 and 45]. On some worlds
   the Chirpers gained the ability to caste, on others it didn\'t work
   (Vanejen, described in _Research Station Gamma_, is an example of the
   latter).

3) Grandfather modified the coyns on later visits and introduced the Aslan,
   Hiver and K\'kree coyns (at least). [_Secret of The Ancients_ p 32].

b) The Ancient coyn set consisted of six groups of six plus two specials.
   The six castes was one group. Void, Soil, Air, Gas, Water, and Fire was
   aother (these were the Droyne concept of elements: Earth (Soil), Water,
   Fire, Good (breahable) Air (Air), Bad (unbreathable) Air (Gas), and the
   absence of any of the other five (Void). 18 of the other coyns mentioned
   in the modern set were also in the Ancient set, though any grouping of
   them into sixes lacks common themes (the third group, Darkness, Cold,
   Noise, Signal, Heat, and Light are pairs of opposites  -  but so are
   Genesis & Death and Defeat & Achievement from another of the groups).
   Anyway, the abovementioned plus Aspiration, Sacrifice, Beast, Mercenary,
   Voyages, Justice, Change, and Phoenix (can\'t really be a phoenix, of
   course; it must be a legendary Droyne beast with the same characteristics
   as the phoenix) were also part of the Ancient set. Humaniti, Vargr,
   Aslan, Hiver, and K\'kree was not. Remains the Droyne, which was one of
   the two special coyns. The remaining special coyn disappeared from the
   set when Grandfather re-introduced it, presumably because it was no
   longer relevant to the new Droyne. I suggest Eskaloyt, the Droyne
   homeworld itself. We now have 30+2 coyns. We lack one group of six, all
   of them coyns that were subsequently removed. One solution supplies not
   only a group with a common theme, but also the explanation of why they
   became redundant: Six prey animals native to Eskaloyt. Used by primitive
   Droyne to perform hunt magic.

So I suggest that the Ancient coyn set consisted of:

Worker   WarriorDrone    Technician Sport  Leader
Void   SoilAir    Gas Water  Fire
Darkness   ColdNoise    Signal Heat  Light
Genesis   AspirationSacrifice   Defeat Death  Achievement
Beast   MercenaryVoyages    Justice Chance  Phoenix
Hissayt   EmissyobAyvaylk    Bestoy Nebbay  Hayyarn
Droyne   Eskaloyt

But I can\'t just hand a list like that to my players. I\'d much rather give
them a description of what the coyns look like. And that\'s where I need some
help. I\'ve come up wih a description of most of the coyns. Some I like, some
I\'m not thrilled about, and some I downright dislike, but can\'t come up with
a good alternative to. So if you think of something you think is better, let
me know.

c) The modern coyns that duplicates Ancient coyns duplicates their design
   too.

4) The first Grandfather set (in -75,000) consisted of 38 coyns and included
   one with a human and one with a flame [RSG pp. 4 and 38].

d) The set of six fake coyns menioned on page 13 of _Twilight\'s Peak_ are
   copies of real coyns (albeit modern coyns); they depict an aslan leader,
   a flame, a human, a cloud, an ice crystal, and a sine wave.

e) The depictions of the six castes on page 64 of TP and pp. 12-13 of
   _Droyne_ are taken from the coyn depictions of those castes.

f) The coyn shown on the back of _Droyne_ (two flames and the lower third
   is obsured by a droyne) is not a variant of the coyn wih the single
   flame.

Now to match coyns to descriptions. The first six are easy, thanks to
assumption e):

A massive droyne with digging toolsWorker
A tall droyne with sword and shieldWarrior
A flying droyne with a bottle[1]Drone
A medium droyne with tools and detectorTechnician
A slender droyne with ball and cupstick[2]Sport
A big-headed droyne with a spear[3]Leader

[1] A feeding bottle, perhaps?
[2] A cupstick (_feldoss_ in oynprith) is normally used by Droyne Sports
    to play a sort of team-gladiatorial game for the amusement of the oytrip,
    rather like jai-alai. In combat, the cupstick can throw a very heavy
    object with killing force, multiplying the strength of the droyne\'s
    spindly arms considerably via its added moment of inertia, and can also
    be used for delivering impact fuse grenades. It is usually only handled
    by Sports-- hence its appearance on the coyn.
[Thanks to Mike Metlay for input on _feldoss_"]
[3] A ceremonial spear, of course. See later.

The rest are a bit more tricky. The ones we know about, apart from the
Aslan and the human, was a flame, an ice crystal, a cloud, a sine wave,
and two flames. The flame and the ice crystal can be Fire and Cold. The
cloud could be Air, Gas, or Water (or any of the philosophical concepts,
of course; a cloud could be the symbol of hope to an agrarian community
("I do so hope it will rain")). The sine wave I eventually assigned to
Signal, which gave me a jagged zig-zag line for it\'s opposite, Noise.

Now, going down the list here are the symbols I came up with for each coyn:

Void    Nothing engraved. A blank disc.
Soil    A massive cliff.
Air    A white cloud (ie. the outline of a cloud).
Gas    A black cloud (ie. a filled-in outline of a cloud).
Water    A foam-flecked wave.
Fire    A flame.

(Except for the Void and the Fire I\'m pretty dissatisfied with these, but
they are the best I can come up with. Any suggestions?)

Darkness    Two different sized cresents (The moons of Eskaloyt)
Light    A sun.
Cold    An ice crystal.
Heat    A campfire (Two flames arising from a tree log).
Signal    A sine wave.
Noise    A zig-zag line.

Voyages    A sailing ship.
Justice    A ceremonial spear[4].
Chance    Six sticks in a random pattern[5].
Beast    A ferocious six-limbed carnivore in mid-jump[6].
Mercenary   A big-headed droyne with arms and armour[7].
Phoenix    A six-limbed animal surrounded by flames.

[4] Used by primitive Droyne leaders to dispatch those judged guilty or
    supurfluous to the community (This must have been before krinaytsyu
    became common; when it did, the Leader kept the spear as his symbol
    of authority).
[5] The Droyne use such sticks to generate random numbers according to
    the pattern they fall in; coyn drawing is not, of course, considered
    a random procedure since theyare assumed to predict future events.
[6] The _Stomfelk_, the most feared predator on Eskaloyt.
[7] I reasoned that mercenaries must be krinaytsoyni, and the most common
    krinaytsoyni are leaders. Hence a leader with weapons for a mercenary.

Genesis    An egg.
Death    A droyne skull.
Achievement A brimful cup.
Defeat    An empty, tipped-over cup.
Hope    Six stars in a random pattern[8].
Sacrifice   A droyne sitting with eyes closed[9].


[8] Well, what can I say? If I could come up with good symbols for Air
    and Gas, I\'d use the (rain) cloud for hope. As it is I\'m falling back
    on a Droyne constellation symbolising hope.
[9] A droyne commiting krinaytsyui, of course.

The Hissayt, Emissyob, Ayvaylk, Bestoy, Nebbay, and Hayyarm are various
six-limbed herbivores and omnivores once important to Droyne hunters. I
had descriptions of them all worked out, but those notes seems to have
dissappeared.

Finally the two special coyns:

Droyne   A group of three droyne, a leader, a drone, and a worker[10].
Eskaloyt   Some strange irregular outlines (diferent on the two sides)[11].

[10] In other words, an alpha-male, a female, and a beta-male.
[11] Polar projections of Eskaloyt. Since they don\'t have the lattitude
     and longitude lines common to human map projections they are unlikely
     to be identified as such by humans.

of TL across the Imperium and why TL hasn\'t progressed further than TL15/16...

To draw a quick analogy with the modern world, low TL populations are a
cheap work force to produce goods for higher TL populations.

There you have it. 50% of the reason for the varied TLs. The higher TL
people don\'t have any great incentive to bring their poorer neighbours up to
their own TL because then who would they get to produce all their luxury
home wares at such low prices?

The other 50%? Well, give people TL and they become dangerous. Particularly
anyone with high TL weapons. Just think of the destructive power of
explosives and nukes today. Do you want to provide your enemies (or even
anyone you\'re not quite sure about) with the TL to handle say radioactives
easily, or fusion power... Technology is POWER. No one gives power away
willy-nilly. Scale this up to Imperium level. Ever notice how the major
research installations marked throughout the Imperium are all... Imperial...
you can bet your bottom dollar the Imperium has a certain amount of limited
resources which have developed to TL16, 17 or higher. But if they let it
become common knowledge, then everyone will want some. e.g. today: got a
miraculous cure for cancer, but it costs a few million? Watch the
millionaires queue up, but is any government going to pay for its common
citizens to be cured at that cost? Worse, if it\'s military tech we\'re
talking about, thing of the worries if it falls into the hands of the enemy!
Then think about cartels. Look at what would happen today if someone came
along, "Man in the White Suit" style and said I\'ve created untearable,
unstainable fabric. No one need buy new clothes - these will last you your
entire life. You can bet they\'d be found floating in a river, dead from
multiple scissor wounds... yet another way of stifling new technology.

Basically, anything above TL15 in the Imperium is Imperium-run and quite
secret. And a wide range of lower TL planets are encouraged to provide cheap
labour and goods for the higher TL worlds.

Anyone care to work out similar or alternative strategies for the other
races: Zhodani, etc.?

It has been said that they shouldn\'t be allowed, as this would negate the
X-Boat network.

The jump-torpedoes would never ne able to replace the X-Boat network for
several reasons.
1. They have a limited storeage capacity for messages.
   Compare the space for storeage and transition media in an
   X-Boat with the torpedo.
2. They are not secure.
   You can\'t predict when or where a torpedo (or ship) is going
   to arrive in your system with any great accuracy.
   When it arrives a j-torp broadcasts its message reguardless of
   who\'s about.
   An X-Boat can establish a tight beam link with the IISS suport
   vessel to down load its messages securely.
3. Cost!  What is the cost per "unit message" of the j-torp and
   an X-Boat?  Are the torpedoes reuseable?  I understand that
   these are *disposable*, say for saving the ship\'s log if it
   looks like the ship is going to be destroyed.

4. "Politics"  The X-Boat network is the Govenments
   communications network (it carries civilian mail to help pay the
   costs).  Certain groups are going to highlight the unsecureity
   of j-torps, to help the IISS keep its patch.

1) That 747 that rolls off the production line twice a day (or more) as
being the end result of a year\'s work. Well, yes. But so what? If you trace
it back to each separate component, quite possibly some of them had to be
ordered more than a year before the actual day of production. Again, so what?
In a mass production situation, this is not a major concern, because, like
Henry Ford, you are producing in advance of orders anyway, in order to keep
the price down so that you can make a small profit on a lot of things rather
than a lot of profit on a few.

In any case, we are *not* talking Industrial Revolution technology here,
we are talking *post* IR production tech. Even the crippled sort of factories
that I suggest Traveller has (as opposed to the ones that I proposed in my
Secret Histories post) should be far more efficient than ourt current
ones. For ghu\'s sake, we\'re looking some 3.5 millennia into the future!
It should be the case that the factories/shipyards produce everything at
once from stockpiled raw materials run through robotic refining and milling
machines ... at that level of tech this should be no problem at all. Yet we
are looking at 20th century limitations.

I do not see that you have a valid point given the advances in production
tech that we can reasonably assume must have occurred in the 3500 years or
so into the future of the Traveller background. This is, of course, Travs
main problem, the future is so backward!

2) Liberty Ships being "throw aways". Well, according to my 86/87 "Combat
Fleets of the World", the US National Defence Reserve Fleet has quite a
number of Liberty/Victory Ships in mothballs for reactivation in emergencies.
OK, they haven\'t done a lot of steaming in that time, but they\'re still
intact (tho I believe that they were slower to reactivate for the Gulf War
than planned for) ... and a lot of the USN supply and support vessels are
WW2 (even pre-WW2) vintage. And *they* have seen service for all those years.
Nope, Liberty and Victory ships *and* all the "mass produced" designs made
for WW2 were just as long lived in most cases as their predecessors and
successors. Thus, building a crappy little 100 ton Scout/Courier shouldn\'t
take longer than a day, and this should have no adverse effects on their
longevity.

3) Jump Missiles: Hmm, so my proposition allows *larger* spacecraft to dispense
with the power stage of JDrives. Of course it does! This isn\'t something I
just proposed off the cuff, it\'s actually a part of my formal background.
Why, then, doesn\'t the Imperium use them *officially*. Well, we know that
the Vilani are ultraconservative, we know that they have tainted even the
3rd Imperium irrevocably with their brand of unltraconservative blindness.
So, the answer is obvious ... the idea has been suggested, probably many
times, but has always been rejected because its *not* the "way things have
always been done!"

You are partly right about distortions resulting from the Cold War and
descriptions.  As for your claims about the quality of the Soviet equipment,
could you please e-mail a bibliography of your sources?  I will freely admit
that my knowledge of the Red Army at that time is not extensive.  The point
that I was trying to make was that overwelming numbers can defeat
technology.  Maybe I used a bad example.  Perhaps the Anglo-Zulu war would
be a better example of how huge numbers can defeat technology.

All true.  I am not downplaying the importance of air or navy power.  But
again, air power alone did not win Overlord or the Battle of the Bulge, it
supported it.  No matter what, men are needed to go in on the ground and
physically remove the enemy from the ground they are holding, and then to
protect that ground which has been taken.

Here I entirely agree with you.  The trick to TRAIN.  Technology is an
important factor, but the most important factor is people.  People are made

  True, though 20+million casualties was a bit more than a "mistake."

  True, they had lots, but they were damn good as well - the Soviet
military has consistantly been able to build artillery that outperformed
anybody elses.  There was considerable fear in the Gulf War of what the
Soviet-made Iraqi artillery could do to attacking Americans - it was the
destruction of the Iraqi Command and Control network that negated that
threat.

  German equipment was made to very fine tolerances - the extreme (way
below zero) Russian winter meant that weapons refused to operate.  The
Germans had to change manufacturing methods (slopier tolerences,
essentially) to fix the problem.

  Most of my military history books are in Delaware at the moment - I\'ll
see what I can dig up at the library here.

  As for the Anglo-Zulu War, it does support your point better, though
there were real failures of leadership.  Think of Rourke\'s Drift for an
example of tech triumphing over numbers, though.

  Agreeded.  I shopuld have been clearer that the Allies were able to get
away with lower tech ground equipment by having higher tech aircraft and
high-quality artillery (proximity fuses, for example, not to mention the
US Army\'s exceptionally good forward observer/fire control system).

I agree. In fact it is likely that if j-torps were to be introduced it would
be by the X-Boat Service itself in order to service the areas off the main
X-Boat routes. Considering the way business is done in the Trav universe,
particularly on the frontiers, one would expect that contestability in the
interstellar communication market to be very low. One would expect any
competitor putting itself up against the X-Boat Service, a service of the
Imperium, would be quickly delt with.

So long as the jump time, which is so critical to the fundamental game
mechanics, remains the same for the j-torp,  I see no problem.
One would have to expect greater losses through misjump with j-torps, however.

Even now we can store large amounts of data in very small spaces, the

Secure!!  A torp would be secure, the message would be secure and
without any problem a torp could set up a tight laser link, we do that
now.

Cost is a factor in everything but \'unit message\' cost would not
factor in.  I always see a torp as a disposable, after all you are not
going to match vectors before the torp jumps and it will not be worth
the cost to recover and you may not be able to recover it.

Wrong, the X-Boat network is the Civil network, both the military and
the Imperial family maintain a fleet of jump 6 ships for passing
messages.  The X-Boats just carry the mail for everyone else, and they
carry the bulk of normal Imperial business.

There are a lot of limits on Jump Torps and their uses.  In one case
you have the complete jump torp which is just a starship without a
crew.  This is very expensive to build and operate, and you have a
large chance to lose it in use.  On the other hand you have the jump
torp that depends on the mother ship to power it jump drive and cut a
tape to use in the computer.  While smaller and cheaper it has its own
problems, such as the extra equipment required on the mothership and
the fact that the mothership must move away from the planet to use the
torp.
The X-boats are a cheap and reusable method of communicating while
jump torps are expensive to use and normally are just one shot
affairs.  But I have allowed jump torps at times, in one case the
player set up jump six route between two systems for humm shall we say
business purposes.  The jump torp had a mothership that serviced and
recovered it, normally the mothership would handle the insystem
movement to place the torp on the trajectory, charge the jump drive,
and program the jump computer.  When a torp arrived insystem the
mothership would recover, repair, and restock the torp for reuse.  I
had placed losses on the torps at 10% and required extra costs for the
motherships with the schedule he wanted to use. (He did not expect the
men on the ships to take any R&R and had to pay the price, and when he
wanted to move the motherships to another system he found out that it
cost a great amount to ship 400 ton insystem ships.)

Even one of my own characters uses jump torps for emergency messages
between her base (generation ship in deep space) and her companies.
These torps are one use only systems and cost as much as a small ship.
  Their main use is to call of help for the base.

Jump torps may have a place but that place is a very limited because
of cost, for normal business uses the X-Boat system is very cost
effective to use.  Think of it, your letter to grandma, the latest
profit figures, and a update to a library would cost a lot less than
the fuel used to charge the jump drive for the torp.  Now the
information about the Navy winning or losing a battle, a upswing in
prices of certain goods, or even the gossip of the court might be
worth the cost of a torp.

Zhodani: More interested in pyschic development than TL development at a
governmental level. No way the Consulate are going to arm people who
don\'t sincerely believe in the Consulate and what it stands for -- and
they\'re going to know! Commercial concerns will also stagnate tech
equalisation, as in the Imperium. Plus a lot of effort is going into the
Core Expeditions, not social development.

Solomani: Sol Sec probably want control of military elements themselves.
As we know, Terrans are rather pushy compared to Vilani, so there\'ll be
more of a Technology Rat Race, but the Party will dampen this a bit.

Vilani: The Ziru Sirk\'aa is too conservative (and too high tech) to
develop much new technology. I would expect a large degree of homogeneity
on Vilani-culture worlds; of course, later-settled worlds, or worlds with
"minor race" inhabitants, or "reserved" worlds (for later exploitation)
could all have lower TLs.

Vargr: Devil take the hindmost! Fiercely competitive, not given to
cooperation, Vargr tech levels are known to vary wildly from world to
world.

Aslan: Technologies can often be a jealously-guarded Clan secret; thus,
worlds which aren\'t entirely loyal to a single Clan may see less
development than those which are. Read "Shogun" if you want an idea of
what I mean...

Hivers, Kkree and Droyne I don\'t know about.

Darrians suffered from the Maaghiz; tech level imbalance there is a
relatively recent historical accident. The Spinward Marches have in any
case been developing for the last millenium, so it\'s fair to argue that
the Darrian "background" isn\'t stable.

Why so? I don\'t know what the debate on these lists over Virus was like, but
I have not met one person in the gaming scene locally who thinks Virus is
anything but a laughably ridiculous piece of ****. Regardless of whether
*you*, dear reader, agree with this summation or not, the point I\'m going
to make is valid ...

Why assume that anything is inevitable? Why not have CTrav and MTrav era
settings now republished as part of a *new timeline* for all those long-
term players who were totally pissed off by the bad joke that was Virus?
Have an alternative ending for the Rebellion ... and let the players work
their way through it, don\'t just jump 70 or 80 years into the future!

This in no way invalidates the TNE future ... keep on developing that
separately, assuming that Virus happened the way it did. Let the sales
of the assorted gear sort out the problem.

This leaves room for a lot of common ground ... the basic system (whatever
Marc Miller chooses that to be) will be the same for both, gear design will
be the same for both. Only the background will be different ... and the
CT/MTrav era stuff that is republished will have a lot of crossover value
for TNE era stuff anyway ... as "history".

Solves the problem neatly! Keeps everyone happy ... the "one true way"
supporters on *both* sides excepted, of course!

time of MTrav, is its mania with rating things in *real world* terms. As
we have seen, the "advanced" tech of MTrav has been replaced in many
instances with *different* "advanced tech" of TNE simply because of real
world developments.

Now, I know this is going to be controversial, but as a Designer myself,
I do *not* design design rules which use real world values! Why? Simple,
they are inevitably (and sooner than you think, *always*!) going to be
found too be incorrect (either too optimistic or too pessimistic).

The real success of CT Starship Design as laid out in Book #3 Starships and
Book #5 High Guard was that there was no crossover with real world values.
Everyone could happily design Starships without the least concern that they
may not live up to realistic values - there was simply no way to compare!

This should apply for *all* vehicles. As for other equipment, yes, even guns!
there should be *no* design sequence per se, perhaps some rules for having a
weapon *customised*, but no more. There is no realistic way that you can
do it and not be caught out ... look at the whole Traveller/Twilight 2000
/2300 AD universe. Look at the "advanced" turretless tanks of TW:2000 - never
got beyond the drawing board; the G-11 and Caseless ammo weapons, still not
in production (and given Bundeswehr funding cuts as result of unification,
seemingly never likely to, either), and likely not to be, ever; and now the
latest "fad" technology of FF&S, "electro-thermal combustion" rounds. In all
likelihood these, too, will fall by the wayside in a year or two - and FF&S
will have to replace them with something else "you beaut" that, in turn, will
have to be replaced soon down the track.

Nope, just give us some advanced weapon designs for each TL (after doing some
serious hack and slash surgery on the curreny TL rating system\'s idiocies)
and GMs will be happy enough to create new weapons based on what "seems
reaonable" compared to existing designs. After all, how in the hell do you
think CT Weapons (and MTrav weapons, of course) were "designed" - by the
"seems reasonable" rule, of course!!!

The rest is a mere chimera. Most players and GMs (as a number of people
have noted) have neither the time nor the desire to go through the design
rules as they exist, anyway. And for ghu\'s sake, make it possible to design
a spaceship as it was in CTrav ... step by step, with no having to cut and
fit step 13 before you can do step 3 as in MTrav and TNE!

Anyway, that\'s my 2d worth!

Whether or not Jump Torpedos completely eliminate the X-boat network
(and they will, at least, margninalize it) one has to face that they
significantly change the character of the setting.  No long do
you have to risk taking ships into a system to communicate.  No
longer do you need to maintain a network of Jump 6 ships to have
jump 6 communications.  Look at he timeline for the death of Stephon
and the Rebellion, torps would significantly alter thaty.

The Traveller setting is based on difficult comunications.  The
attractions of jump torpedoes is that they make communications easier.
For that reason they have to fundamentally change the setting.

I also firmly believe. Something may look hard science fiction for a couple
of years but it will not last long. A game should last more than that and
therefore should have flexible rules leaving a lot to imagination.

Traveller is completely unrealistic from several points of view:
social (govern by idle and protagonist nobles? you must be joking),
military (dukes order sector admirals? sure..), economic (low salaries,
no robotics), astronomical (abitable planets around Deneb),
physical (jump drive, antigrav, thrusters, yeahh), etc.

STill I consider it the best role-playing game of all times (I am
thinking to Classical Traveller).

Why? I do not care about hard science. I care about a roughly consistent
picture, I care about a bright future, I care about roleplaying, I care
about mystery. When you tell me that Grandfather was a power hungry
error-prone dictator I can accept it. When a grand-duke kills the
emperor I can perhaps accept it. But when you talk about a virus
I stop wasting my money.

Not only I would like to see a post-rebellion timeline without the
virus, I would also like a timeline without rebellion...

                                                   Massimo

P.S. as far as I can see real hard science fiction has more to do with
convicing politicians and public that some real smart idea is worth trying.
Bad thing is that scientists themselves disagree on what is a real smart
idea..

Well, I don\'t understand why the X-Boat Service as an organisation would
necessarily be "marginalised" by the introduction of j-torps. Remember, it
was the transcontinental railways who first introduced the transcontinental
telegraph in the United States. As I said before, it is most likely to be
the X-Boat Service as a business entity that introduces the j-torps.

     In the Rebellion, you have the secret J6 couriers jumping like mad for the

Just adding to the TNE/MT/CT and FFS debate -

Basically, TNE is the best rules set of the three (and YES I have used
them all). It is the only one that is comprehensive and developed enough.
The character generation is fine, combat rules are fine, the task system
works well etc, etc.

I do agree that the timeline used to reach the setting that was used was
rediculous, and it was that IMHO that is the root of most of the problems
anti-TNE types have with it. MM\'s proposal of having a universal rules
set with several different backround is perfect, it keeps everyone happy.

Quite why anyone wants to go back to MT I don\'t know (and as for CT, are
you MAD?). TNE is by far the most complete rules set of the three. I
believe that the majority of debate concerns the setting, which with MM\'s
plans is no longer a problem.

Now, as for FFS. Personally I think it is bloody good. OK, it has a few
problems with it and needs a few things tweaked, but the principle is
amazing. As was very well argued by someone (sorry, I forget who), don\'t
not publish an FFS style book just because some people find it too
complicated or cannot spare the time to use it fully. I you don\'t want
all that detail, DON\'T USE IT! Just look at the final stats (range,
damage, pen or speed, duration, and weapons etc, etc). Some people LIKE
the detail.

If you are just need a ship that the players are taking a passage on, you
don\'t need to design it with FFS anyway - all you need to know is size,
jump, maneuvre, staterooms, and weapons. Who cares what it\'s weight is
to the nearest metric ton? The same for weapons. If all you want is the
final stats, that all you need to use. Other people like the detail, and
anyway, the detail (ME etc) is only used IN ORDER TO find out the final
stats. They are only a means to an end.

Personally, if any new Traveller rules set does not contain a design
sequence as detailed as that in FFS, then I shall stick with TNE and just
buy a few of the new background supplements.

So there - all those who don\'t like FFS, don\'t bloody well use it, and
don\'t dictate to those who do like it what they should or should not use.

And I have to ask why?  J-6 is only for military couriers.  The
X-boats for private citizens are j-4.  Also, we haven\'t come up with
the cost of one of these beasties.  How are we to know that they are
cheaper and more cost effective than a X-boat?  My guess is that if
they were cheaper to use than X-boats they would be.  However, I\'ve
always gotten the impression that the j-torp was used strictly as last
ditch military courier tool (ie the ship that is carrying the
important message is about to get hosed, time to send the message out
on the j-torp and HOPE it gets to its destination).

The turretless tanks did show up as a few prototype-only models; I think there
is one in front of the big tank plant in Michigan (can\'t remember the location,
but I had seen it there about three years ago).  The G-11 is in production on a
customer-order basis, as far as I know; I have seen several working G-11s being
fired at some defense industry shows.  In both cases, somebody had a neat and
potentially-viable idea, but the cost-effectiveness of the idea left something
to be desired.

As for weapons design rules, the "slugthrower" rules seem to be the ones that
most annoy people from a reality standpoint; the artillery rules come out
fairly well, and I think most people who use FF&S are happy enough with the
energy weapons rules (especially after energy weapons were strengthened by
GDW)  There is still some controversy about laser power, but even the laser
rules seem to be accepted.  The lack of rules or guidelines for creating wapons
was a significant weakness in CT and MT.  The multiple versions of some of the
starship heavy weapons helped, but I always found the generic definition of
lasers and missiles to be ridiculous, and the very limited list of personal and
support weapons to be somewhat sad.

Not everybody wants to go through the effort of designing detailed weapons
system, but the sales and usage figures for FF&S show that there are plenty of
people that do.  I have no objection to people not using such rules, and I do
think there should be a large list of "pre-built" components that allows High
Guard-like quick ship and vehicle designs.  However, it is foolishly
self-limiting to insist that just because something is inconvenient to some
people, it should be removed.   If you can provide a consistent, simpler
alternate path for those who don\'t want/need detail, that is the better
solution.  It is better to cater to both markets instead of just mindlessly
alienating one of them.  The Virus/Reformation Coalition example should be
proof of that.

I have to admit that I never played the TNE rules, but that\'s because I
hated the look of them just glancing at them in the store.  MT was a
revision of CT, and (I thought) an improvement.  TNE, however, was an
entirely different game--both in terms of the setting and the system.  Once
you abandoned D6\'s and changed all the skills and attributes around, it just
wasn\'t TRAVELLER anymore, as far as I was concerned.

As for the "dont\' use it if you don\'t like it" argument for FF&S, you don\'t
always have that option.  If, using your example, characters are paying
passengers on a starship, deck plans could be important (depending on what
you\'re planning to do to them...), and  so it *does* matter how much tonnage
is taken up by engineering, gunnery, etc.

While I\'m here, I have to say that I fully agree with Phil McGregor on the
issue of keeping one\'s science fiction internally consistent rather than
having it agree with the latest scientific fads.  I would point out, though,
that the same argument could be made for keeping the tech level designations
the way they are.  It\'s a lot simpler than revising the old system (which
works) and also remember how vague the whole basic world generation is anyway.

Because the justification for the non-trivial ammount of money spent
on the Xboat network is as a fast network of communications for the
Imperium.  Jump Torpedoes are not only 50% fastet, the can be
sent to or from _any_ world.

Once you start thinking the consequences of jump torpedoes through,
the fact is they make a fundamental difference.  One, that I already
mentioned, is that, prior to the assisnation of Stephon, various
powers had been maintaining secret networks of jump-6 capable
ships.  They got a several week to month jump on the news of
the assasination.  With jump torpedos, that simply wouldn\'t
have happened.,

Another example, is the fact that, without such communictations,
a military vessel has to jump into a system blind.  The best they
can do is send two ships in with one to report back "all clear".
The problem is that those ships are easily picked off by a force
that the whole battle group could easily defeat.  But if you
send in the whole battle group you risk a major defeat.

Addition though can come up with more examples.  But more fundamentally,
how can the existence of faster, easier, unmanned communications not
affect a background that is based on the lack of FTL communications.

The fact is that X-boats are presented as the fastest form of
communications unless you can afford the huge cost of maintaining
a network of j-6 couriers.  This gives the big powers an edge.
Jump Torps, unless they cost almost as much as a jump-6 courier,
fundamentally mess with this (which is an important part of the
background).  You also have other side effects (such as in
military situations that I mentions).

You have to remember (and this is a mistake made over and over)
is that new technologies have consequences that don\'t immediately
occur unless you think about it (and sometime not even then).
If you introduce a technology (especially one that touches
on a fundamental limitation to the society, in this case
communications) you are messing with the background.

>Also, we haven\'t come up with
>the cost of one of these beasties.  How are we to know that they are
>cheaper and more cost effective than a X-boat?

I\'ve seen various schemes where you rule by fiat that the Imperium
plots against, or they are (for some reason) one shot divises, or
they are unusually expensive.  The problem with this, as you get
with all arbitrary "this is how it works" decisisions, is that
it just strains suspension of disbelief a bit further and makes
it all seem a bit hokey.  (and even then, you keep having to
deal with every new and unexpeted use the players can some
up with).

If you like jump torps enought that you are willing to make
a significant change the background, that\'s fine.  But you
have to be aware that you are making a significant change.

"Imperial Scout Service Guide to the Universe" at

Does HIWG formally recognise this map and the info (ie all the sector

have quite a but of "unoffical" information here, ie. the "Psivak",
"Brimdelish", "Dedrey", "Uuntrergab", "Hlygaash", and "Trakmani", all 2-6

If this isn\'t offical, pergapse HIWG want\'s to make it so?  I don\'t

1) After a long hiatus, Phil McGregor strikes out of nowhere saying that
we\'re all ninnys for not allowing them and proposes a plausible though
challengeable system for how they might work.

2) I replied that this presented a problem for the Traveller background
in that it would render the X-boat network obsolete and would allow "jump
gates" that larger star ships could use.

3) Phil retorted with "of course it does, that\'s part of my background!"
(paraphrased).

4) Alun came up with a number of reasons why jump torps could not replace
X-boats. Namely:  Limited storage, security, cost, and politics.

5) Someone (sorry I forget the name) replied with a number of challenges
to Alun\'s proposals.

6) A number of others have cited some minor references hinting at the
existence of jump torps.

Sorry to anyone I left out, but these are the salient messages in
my opinion.  Now here are some of my responses to these.

To Phil:
You can have warp drives and phasers in _your_ background for all I care,
but the debate here is about the Traveller universe.  Granted that jump
torps are mentioned in Leviathan, but that was put out by DGP and GDW
seems to have jumped on their apparent error after publication, stating
that these torps were Ancients artifacts.  Having jump torps and jump
gates in the Traveller universe is going to change it fundamentally.  As
others have mentioned, one of the fundamental aspects of the Traveller
universe is slow communication speeds.  GDW has specifically mentioned
this as one of the bases for their background:  The communication
system is analogous to the 18th century (paraphrased from "The Traveller
Book").
Your explanation for why the Imperium doesn\'t officially use jump
gates seems a little thin to me.  You basically said that the Vilani are
stodgy and don\'t like to change systems very often.  What about other
nations?  The Darrians, Sword Worlders, and Zhodani (to name a few) all
use jump ships instead of jump gates.  Why?  And why has their never been
mention of jump gates anywhere?


To Alun:

Here are your reasons for why jump torps could not replace X-boats, and
my objections to them.

Limited Storeage Capacity:  I don\'t think this is true.  We can hold
several terrabytes of info in something a few cubic meters in volume
now.  By TL 10 or 12, storage capacities should be virtually unlimited by
our standards.

Lack of Security:  Someone pointed out that you could easily have a jump
torp come in system and tight beam its message at a ground station.  This
is a TL-8 procedure.  It could then erase its messages to prevent enemy
interception.

High Cost:  This one is hard to figure.  Some people have argued that the
jump torps should be disposable because the cost of recovery would be too
high.  I disagree.  You just have to put a small dirt-cheap chemical
rocket or ion drive on it, and it can eventually guide itself into orbit
around whatever system body you like.  Depending on where it comes in,
recovery time might be days, weeks or months, but in a continuously
running communication system, this wouldn\'t be a problem.
The real question is a matter of reliability to cost ratio.  If a
jump torp only arrives at its destination 90% of the time, then why not
send two?  Chance of message not getting through would be 1%.  If the
odds of success are lower, just send more.  The only limiting factor here
is cost. If jump torps cost enough, and are unreliable enough, then this
scheme isn\'t economical.  But I can\'t see the torps costing much, as they
would be mass produced in droves, and would have no need for life
support.  Also, you save on salaries for a lot of people.

Politics:  You stated that anyone trying to challenge the Imperial X-boat
service would dealt with promptly, implying that they would be put out of
business by political maneuvering and so on.  This _might_ be an
explanation for the continuing existence of X-boats in the Imperium
(though I\'ve seen several posts arguing convincingly that it would not),
but it does not explain  why many other governments  use exactly the same
system.  Do the Zhodani and Solomani also have monopolistic
communications companies that crush any attempts at inovation?

All this to say that if jump torps were allowed by eliminating
the 100 ton rule (i.e., if they were allowed by the physics of the
Traveller universe), then they would be used extensively and would change
the Traveller universe in many fundamental ways, not the least of which
is the marginalization of the X-boat network.  X-boats could still be
used to carry cargo and such, but it would most likely be much faster
and more economical to have small unmanned vessels carrying the messages
if this was possible.

You seem to assume that j-torps are capable of jump-6. I\'ve
always had the impression that j-5 and j-6 drives were restricted to the
military. I can\'t remember where I got that impression (Traveller
Adventure, maybe.)

J-torps have been around a long time. People like me have been
thinking about their consequences for a long time. They are entirely
compatable with the CT background.

Even without j-torps, the navy has always had this capability.
Problem is, the information you gather is two weeks old before the main
fleet arrives. That\'s true with both j-torps and scout ships.

I\'m not aware that GDW ever presented j-torps as being faster than
X-boats.

I\'ve never had to make any change at all in the background.
(Well, I had to make one. Before I bought Leviathan, I had told my
players that jump vehicles couldn\'t be under 100 tons. After I bought
Leviathan, I had to tell them, "Oops, I was wrong.") J-torps affect the
X-boat network about as much as automated drones affect Federal Express
today.

The CT universe included Leviathan, which was one of the Little
Black Books put out by GDW. When I bought Leviathan, MT was not yet
imagined; I had never even heard of DGP.

When did GDW backpedal on j-torps? I never heard of them being
described as ancient artifacts. How would Leviathan get hold of ancient
artifacts? That sounds like a stretch to me. The Imperium would not let
its archeological treasures go out into the wilds of unexplored space
without good reason.

I\'m not clear on what jump gates have to do with j-torps. I\'ve
never even heard j-gates MENTIONED in CT. Obviously, they could affect
CT background by quite a bit.

P.S. The real reason X-boats have become unfeasable is that the new MT
ship design rules don\'t require the huge jump-fuel consumption that CT
assumed. In MT, it\'s trivial to build a cheap 100-ton ship with manuever
drives and j-4. In CT, it was impossible; X-boats had no manuever. That
poses quite a retcon problem. That\'s one of the reasons I never used MT
ship design.

Yes, there were a CT-sized books put out by FASA (I believe) that
covered the Beyond and Vanguard Reaches sectors.  IMO, they were great
settings for "space opera"-type campaigns.  If I remember correctly,
there were TL-17 planets out here in this conglomeration of
subsector-sized (and smaller) petty empires and client states of both
the Imperium and Zhodani Consulate.

They didn\'t.  And they never blasted j-torps retroactively either.
Also, they never said that X-boats were the fastest form of
communication, just the largest method open to the general public.  In
fact, they said that the covert Imperiallines j-6 ships are the
fastest form of communications travel, but that is reserved for
military and noble use only.

mail can be stored without problem.  The rest is devoted to cargo

I am sorry David but you missed my point. I have never denied that j-torps
provide a faster passage of information. The point I was merely trying to
make was that introduction of j-torps doesn\'t necessarily mean the
marginalisation of the X-Boat Service. I gave the example of Railways and
Telegraph.

I suggest you read responses to your posts carefully in future.

Let\'s not let our arrogance get away with it.  People like me have
also been thinking about the consequences and we have come up
with ones that change the background.  Just because you haven\'t
been able to come up with something doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t exist.

But, above and beyond the two week problem (which is not what I was
refering too), you also have the problem that you risk loosing ships
due to enemy action when they enter a system.  This is a fundamental
military problem that jump torps do away with.  (And, BTW, the
info arrives _two_ weeks after you sent it, but it is _one_ week
old.  I guess all your thinking is indeed failable).

Why can\'t they be.  Unless you want to impose some arbitrary
restriction on them.

Maybe you haven\'t thought it through as well as you claim.  Even
something as fundamental as the spread of the news of Stephon\'s
assination has to be changed (in addition to marginalizing the
X-boat system).

>(Well, I had to make one. Before I bought Leviathan, I had told my

Everytime your players use jump torps to do something they
couldn\'t do before, you have and example of how you have changed
things at the player level.

I\'m not sure what you mean.  Are you saying that if I could buy a machine

ever having to go to a Fed Exp office (or wait for pickup), to
any destination regardless how remote from federal express offices
it is, that it wouldn\'t affect Federal Express?  Boloney.

Well, you could suppose that.  This particular part refers to Matter
Teleportation and distances.  By TL21, you can teleport something 1
parsec, thus the reason to have starship-sized portals.

The jump gates that I refered to were the ones listed as alternative
tech in FFS that allow you to jump a ship 12 parsecs at TL15, etc...

The above information is based on the numbers presented in FFS since
it\'s the only Traveller reference to provide solid numbers on the

As many have replied, Paranoia Press published both the Beyond and Vanguard
Reaches, which included many high-tech worlds (sentient robots etc),
a ringworld, and a pretty gas nebula.

Chuck Kallenbach (original designer of Vanguard Reaches) has retroactively
modified the Reaches, saying that "wild rumours about ringworlds", etc, were
just that - wild rumours. However, to date I have not seen the new stats. They
*may* be part of the data available from the History of the Imperium Working
Group (HIWG). See Clay Bush for details of HIWG (email address in old xboats?
- sorry, I don\'t have it here, I\'ll try to find it).

Personally, I though VG was OK, it was only the Beyond that was a little
over-the-top.

BTW, I\'ve asked before (but received no reply); what do Campaign Outfitters DO?

I have always treated the 100-disp.ton limit as a matter of the smallest
*Survivable* jump bubbles, and anything smaller cannot use a hull grid
design, but must use one of the "old" coil based drives. Since few yards
use the old tech (in my useage, it\'s got a +1 to misjump chance under MT,
or a 1 in 6 chance of aggravation under TNE), they cost quite a bit (due to
custom manufacture), mass and displace the same, and cannot generate a
field smaller than that for a 100 dt field, so all small craft with J-Dirve
have coils. J-Torps work just fine, but still need to have the external
fuel source, as they require J fuel ammounts equal to 100 ton ships. And
need to be kicked away before they engage the full field (some 20m).

Notice, I HAVE rationalized the MT drives with CT/RSB descriptions of
J-Drive Tech.

Sorry to say, but in HG it\'s very possible to build J-4 ships with maneuver
at about 120-150tons.  Probably at TL15 these could be J-5.  You see, one
thing that always surprised me about any traveller design sequences was that
all the example ships built by GDW sucked!  I think that this was because their
ships were built by people who "knew" how they should turn out.  If you let a
bunch of players at the design sequences with a spreadsheet, then you\'d get some
quirkey designs compared to the "norm" as presented by GDW.

But this requires that the j-torp knows *where* it is on arival, *where*
the recieving station is, and the recieving station needs to know where
and when the j-torp will appear!  The mechanics of jump don\'t allow this
sort of accuracy.  You need some astrogation on the part of the arriving
ship to fix its position.  Either good sensors at the reciever or a
broadcast from the arriving ship to alert the recieving station to align
its tight-beam link.  A jump exit position can vary by several
hundred-thousand kilometers, and the time of exit can vary by upto a day
or so.
The notes on the j-torp in Leviethan sugest that the j-torp broadcasts
its data on arrival, reguardless as to who (if anyone) is listening.

Would all this, plus the guidance system, tightbeam link, astrogation,
jump drive, message banks, power system and fuel, all fit into a
jump-torpedo?

OK, I need a brief physical description, all the info on their psychology
(direct quotation from the JTAS 11 article preferred), and and other
\'soft\' info on them.  As I\'m developing the Empty Quarter for aa writeup
in The Traveller Chronicle, I plan to write up a brief (1/2 page to 1
page) description on every native sophont species there.

I have already done so for the other species (which I have personally
invented), but I also need to do so for the Bwaps (which was created
previously).

Incidentally, It seems that the JTAS article doesn\'t mention the Bwaps\'
homeworld.  Where is it published?

The problem is that the anology doesn\'t hold.  You are comparing Apples
and Oranges.
The Railways are a way of shipping freight.
The Telegraph sends information.

However, the existance  of a telegraph did indeed marginalize the
use of railways for information transmition.  No message of any
urgency was sent by train.

The situation with jump torps is even worse because, not only
are they faster, but they are available for use directly on
worlds off an X-boat route.  (ie you telegraph isn\'t just strung
along the rail lines, but goes to every town.)

lecture others on their failabilities.

I agree in turn, but the I think the rate of data size increase is slower
and more likely to hit a cieling value (e.g., there\'s no need for more
than 24-bit color, since the human eye can\'t distinguish finer gradients
anyway) than storage capacity.  In any case, a j-torp would certainly be
able to carry an adequate amount of info to make it practical.

hundred-thousand kilometers, and the time of exit can vary by upto a day

<<<<<<<<<<<

I guess there\'s no real way to resolve this issue.  It just depends on
how smart you think a j-torp can be made.  If it can do the following
sequence, then it\'s probably pretty secure:

1) enter the system and determine its position relative to a ground station.
2) send a broadcast message to a ground station saying "prepare to
recieve tight beam message from coordinates XYZ".
3) send a tightbeam to the groundstation.
4) erase all info once it has been successfully transmitted (or when
someone tries to tamper with the torp).

jump drive, message banks, power system and fuel, all fit into a

<<<<<<<<<<<

Again, it\'s a question of how good you think you can build a jump-torp.
Intuitively, I think all of the above could probably fit in something 50
cubic meters in volume (4 tons).  The Voyager probes have primitive
versions of all the systems you mention (except, of course, the jump
drives :-), and they\'re quite a manageable size.  With increased tech, it
doesn\'t strike me as implausible.  Any gearheads out there want to try
designing one of these things with FF&S?

I don\'t think your analogy is correct.  It would be more apt (IMO) to
say: J-torps affect the X-boat network about as much as the Galileo probe
affects the Space Shuttle Outer System Exploration Program (SSOSEP?).
That is to say, it renders it non-existant.  One does not send a large
manned craft to do what a small unmanned craft can do if one is trying to
be economical.

Well, if it cost a million dollars per package, each time you used it,
you\'d probably begin to think that Federal Express wasn\'t such a bad
deal after all. And if Federal Express owned rights to the technology
and got a royality every time you used the machine, they probably wouldn\'t
mind either way what you did.

If the machine had the possibility of going off in the wrong direction
and posing a hazard to the general public, there are various legal and
regulatory agencies who\'d probably care very much when and where you
used your machine.

Even though we\'re all using e-mail, the Post Office is still doing some
business. They haven\'t been completely marginalized by this example of
new and better technology. Reading the news, the PO is now attempting to
set itself up as some kind of controller for e-mail, applying some type
of virtual "stamp" to every piece of e-mail for starters, with the
implication that we would all be billed for this service. Think that might
have an impact on how we use this technology?

I have recieved a few suggestions about the gas giant: one of them
involve putting a small dense nebula in the way between the giant and
Earth.

Another, and more interesting one, involves dear old Gramps sucking out a
lot of the energy, and using it for one of his pet projects.

Incidentally, what should I name this star?  Any suggestions?  The
mainworld has already been named "Starsky".

P.S. When I said "Brighter as Antares", I meant we right here on earth,
right now would see it as brighter than Antares.

P.P.S. I named one of my systems Deyis II, in honour of the World
Builder\'s Handbook cover.  Has this name been published before?

This is Tom Trelenberg with another CT question (sorry, I finally got
rules for both MT and TNE, but.....I remain CT.  In answer to someone\'s
statement about being MAD for liking the CT universe...I guess I\'m guilty
as charged.  Well being mad isn\'t so bad....)

My question concerns a conversion between starship damage and some of
the 10D+ damages that can be achieved from weapons in Book 4: Mercenary.
Starship damage is done in "hits" (i.e. each laser that hit gets to
role once on the "hit location" table of Book 2, missles get 1D6 "hits"
and High Gaurd has other tables).  Is there any official (or working
unofficial) method to determine how many pts of damage (e.g. 16D)
constitues a "hit" if the weapon is used to fire at a starship.
If anyone has any workable scheme on this I\'d like to hear it.

Thanks for your comments

Actually yes.  In the MegaTraveller Referee\'s screen, there is a folio
adventure included that takes place on Deyis II.  I don\'t have the
information at my fingertips.

Anyway, as we find out later in MTJ 4, the race that seems to be
sentient on Deyis II is the same race (but in an earlier stage of
development) as The Primordals.

There are a couple ways you could do this:
        1) Apply/adapt the MT damage rules (which did give vehicle hit
tables and damage ratings for vehicles up to and including sarships)

        2) Adapt the rules from Robots (Book 8).  For the ship as a whole
and for each part that will take damage follow the following steps:
                a.determine volume in liters (13,500 liters/disp. ton)
                b.divide this number by 5 to get the points of damage it can
take before becoming inoperative (minimum 1 pt)
                c.divide the same number by 2 to get the points of damage it
can take before it is destroyed (minimum 1 pt)

Note that method #2 will give you ships *much* more sturday than #1--by a
factor of 10, I believe.

I hope this is helpful.

Of course my thinking is fallible, as is yours.

The moment before the fleet arrives in its target system, the information about
the system that it read off of the j-torp last week, is now TWO weeks
old. Think about it.

Well, actually I DO want to impose a j-4 restriction on them, but that\'s
beside the point. If you allow civilians j-5 and j-6 drives, then they
can build ships that can outrace the X-boats. If outracing an X-boat
route makes a problem for your campaign, then you need to come up with
an explanation for why it never (or rarely) happens. Once you have an
explanation that works for j-6 liners, I would imagine it might work for
j-6 torpedoes too.

I think I\'ve thought through the background pretty well.

News of Strephon\'s death travelled to the Spinward Marches through j-6
Imperiallines couriers. I don\'t see how j-torps (at TL15) could be any
faster than that.

You\'re absolutely right of course. The introduction of j-torps

and history of the Imperium.

Sorry my statement was so vague. Let me try again.

It wouldn\'t affect FedEx\'s earnings very much. (It would, of course
affect one\'s own relationship with FedEx a lot.) Such a drone system is
possible with today\'s technology. The drone could be smaller than a
FedEx jet, and it would be unmanned, so you wouldn\'t have to pay any
pilot\'s salary. But you and I both know that it would be ridiculously
expensive to build such a beastie. If you were rich enough to buy one of
the navy\'s experimental robot airplanes, you could obviously have your
own neat, high-tech replacement of many of FedEx\'s services. This might
affect your own life (and adventures!) quite alot. But the rest of us
drudges will go on using a more mundane courier. (\'cause it\'s cheaper!)
The overall business climate and culture of the USA would be unchanged,
I think.

You may think differently, of course, but that doesn\'t mean my notion is
baloney. Nor does it mean that I haven\'t thought through the
consequenses of CT\'s j-torps thoroughly.

Well I\'ve "droned" on enough about this...

I\'m pretty sure you\'re right about about CT\'s a posteriory reasoning of
many of their ship designs. But I\'ve usually been able to rationalize
their kludgy designs to the players by pointing out that they\'re so darn
cheap. (This hasn\'t worked with many of Book 2\'s small craft, which can
be obscenely expensive!) I too have, on occasion, designed little j-5
and j-6 craft using Book 5. But as I recall, they were pretty pricey.
If you can come up with a j-5 or j-6 ship for near the price of an X-boat,
(using Book 5 rules, I still don\'t know what to make of MT or FFS,)
please mail it to me! My players would be very grateful!

This goes under the heading of imposing arbitrary restrictions
to make it work.  (in this case making j-torps arbitrarily expensive).
Aside from the problem that these restrictions always have their own
side effects (how do you enforce these restictions, are their smugglers,
if so why don\'t you see them?  it still doesn\'t explain the fact
that jump torps don\'t eleminate the need to have hugely expensive
networks of jump-6 couriers [since they are secret anyway you aren\'t
going to worry about a few  regs], or why you don\'t see them outside
the Imperium, etc.  Then you need to put in even more arbitrary
rulings on how things work, but then these all have their own
consequences), the main problem is that imposing arbitrary conditions
so that a technology doesn\'t have any effect but one carefully selected
one tends make the background seem the mush more arbitrary and that
much more hokey.

Introducing new technologies that seem cute without thing through
all the implications has ruin many a good background.

And how do jump torps do any of this anymore than an X-boat?

Well, in fact they already have been partially marginallized.  The
only thing they are used for is (aside from packages) is slow, cheap
delivery and delivery where you need the original.  Anything else
is either e-mailed or faxed.  This process is continuing.

I\'ve not heard of it.  Probably because it is just a dumb, pointless
idea that won\'t even come close to the light of day.  However, even
it were to happen, it wouldn\'t be what you are claiming.  The anology
wouldn\'t be banning j-torps to keep x-boats around (which is as doomed
to failure as trying to ban e-mail to keep the mail service going) but
more like the people that run the x-boat network setting up a
jump-torp network (either way x-boats still get replaced).

[Note, just so we don\'t forget, loss of the x-boat network is only
one problem that jump-torps introduce to the background (I\'ve
mentioned some before) and even you patch enough arbitrary restrictions
to keep x-boats going, you still have to deal with those.]

Generally speaking a personal weapon can never do significant damage to a
ship.  An average hull can take 1000 points of "personal weapons" damage
from lasers before a man-sized hole is made. Even an iris valve can take
100 (both of these figures are in "The Traveller Book" I think).  So even
a weapon doing 10D needs to fire three shots to get through a valve and
about 30 to get through a hull.  This assumes that someone is just walking
up to the side of the ship and trying to blast into the hull.  You could
rule that someone walking right up to a turret and firing an FGMP down the
barrel would disable the turret (but, of course, that\'s a _bad_ place for
your FGMP toting guy to be :-).

As far as I know, other than these 1000 hit point and 100 hit point
values, there are no conversion from personal weapons to starship damage
in CT.  Going the other way, I vaguely remember reading somewhere that a
laser can make a 50 meter radius beaten zone by rapid firing from orbit.
Any human in that area is toast, and I imagine most vehicles as well.

Hope this is useful to you.

Let us not make Marc Miller into a piece of rope to tugged toward each
individual(s) taste/opinion of what direction he should take in Traveller.
If you like/prefer a particular version/revision of Traveller, then point
out the errors that it has and try and point some positive way(s) to improve
it without suggesting going to the next version/revision. If you do not like
a particular version/revision also point the things that detract from play.
There should be enough players of that version/revision to present ways to
correct it. Let us present to Marc Miller the errors in each
version/revision of Traveller and possible solutions from different angles
(Gearhead and non Gearhead especially) that will correct the errors. That
way he can evaluate each version/revision on it\'s merits and what will be
needed to make it more playable to wider group of players. He just might
take all of the information that we all have gathered/created and make
atleast three different sources for backgrounds. That way "to each his own"
can occur. If needed why can\'t we have three different mailing list for each
area ie Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, and Traveller New Era. In that way
we will not have so many feverant opinions being displayed with very little
value to the rest of the readers. We could also have a list for those that
just like "nitpicking" for every verison/revision. What we can try and do is
to maintain a listing of the errors/problems/nits that each version/revision
has and a list of possible solutions. All of this is because if all we do is
get embroiled into fruitless discussions over opinions then Marc Miller will
not take us seriously at all. He will then listen for the input that he
wants to hear and then go that way , ignoring anything that does not agree
with what he wants. If you want you can look deep into the archives on the
Net and on Genie and can see what happened last time when GDW made the change.

As to which verision/revision that I prefer well "The Thing Speaks for Itself"

really began actively playing when MT came out.  I stopped playing when TNE
came out for several reasons: 1)I did not like GDW\'s house rules (from what
I heard, these are owned by Frank Chadwick anyway); 2)I did not like the
fact that other than pulling a Rip Van Winkle, you could not integrate a
current campaign into the new system; 3)I have a very intense dislike for
the "Virus"; 4)To me it looked like the only reason that GDW rewrote the
system was to cut MM out of any royalties.  Now that MM has regained control
of Traveller, I am again looking forward to playing Traveller after a 4 year
hiatus.

The arguing going on on these two lists seems pointless to me in light of
what MM has stated that he plans to do.  He has plans to publish support for
several different eras of known space history, thus covering past eras, CT
era, MT era, TNE era and (future?) eras.  He also has stated that he is
going to use updated CT rules (hopefully including the task system).

What we need to do on these lists is not to argue over which system is
better, but to give ideas that can be used by MM to make the new rules
better than any of the preceding rules sets.  As someone else on the list
stated (I can\'t remember who), we had better work together to give MM
constructive ideas before they are published, or else we again are going to
be rebuilding the rules after they are already published.

P.S. One suggestion to MM: as the rules are designed, publish them to the
internet for beta testing.  With all these fans out here, any bugs in the
system will be worked out within a matter of days.  Personally, even if I
got copies of the rules this way, I would still buy the rules as they come
out because: 1)I hate having my rules books in binders and unindexed; and 2)
most importantly, I will buy them to support my favorite game.

P.P.S. See if you can get the Andrew and William Kieth back where they
belong, writing for Traveller (along with their other books).

"The smallest Jump Drive possible, at any Tech Level, is 2 cubic meters in

Hmm, that\'s only slightly larger than a 2 ton Jump Torp requiires for J6!

So, it seems that even GDW agrees that Jump Missiles *are* possible ... which
means all those that oppose them as "non-canon" or because they allegedly
invalidate the XBoat system should, perhaps, reconsider their arguments?

It seems that they are *not* non-canon. It therefore seems that some of the

ships to be streamlined in all versions of Traveller if they wish to make a
planetary landing on a world with an atmosphere?

Or, to be more accurate, as seems to be the case in all versions of Traveller
*except* TNE.

What am I getting at here? Well, consider this, in CTrav and MTrav, Maneuver
Drives are basically reactionless thrusters and Contragravity lifters. They
enable spacecraft to reach fairly decent speeds in atmosphere, if they are
streamlined. But why should this be the case? From what we know of these
drives, they have no "stall speed" (none is mentioned anywhere) ... no minimum
speed at which they have to move the craft or it will fall out of the sky.
Ergo, even if the craft is shaped like a (large) housebrick, then the only
limitation on its ability to maneuver in atmosphere should be the maximum
speed it can achieve before it starts taking friction/heat damage. In other
words, if you *had* a spacecraft the shape of a housebrick, then why can\'t
you simply de-orbit at, say, 100 mph? So it takes an hour to land, so what?

Obviously, no-one from the design team ever considered the implications of the
matter! Even the argument that the unstreamlined vessels do not have the
internal bracing to withstand the gravity of a world they land on obviously
cannot hold water, as they are capable of withstanding at least 1G moves with
whatever they use for MDrives!

And if you look at CG Lifters (FF&S page #75), then you\'d note that the
description there even notes that CG lifters allow a craft to simply "float"!
This means that even Gas-Giant refuelling is possible to completely unstream-
lined vessels. They simply waft down into the upper reaches of the atmosphere
and pump fuel aboard (rather than make a high-speed skimmer type pass through
the atmosphere)!

Isn\'t it wonderful how you can break the rules apart when they give too much
detail!

Why isn\'t/hasn\'t it been done? One possibility is that it may require some
higher than normal degree of piloting skill ... unlikely, as any decent
computer should be able to handle something that simple. Worse, on most
civilised worlds they would presumably even have some sort of ground based
assistance for controlling the approach of such vehicles.

So, no longer need civilian craft be streamlined to land on a planet!

I\'m sure this will cause various people to spit chips and rant that it isn\'t
Traveller "canon" or that it shouldn\'t be allowed because it\'s not what GDW
meant. For the former, sorry, it *is* canon, whether you like it or not! For
the latter, sure, I\'ll even agree that it isn\'t what GDW meant, but so what?
It\'s what the damn fool rules and explanations of same *allow*!

Hi Tom, this is Rob, a fellow CT fan.

There is a method for doing this, but it uses the Striker rules for
vehicle combat, not the Book 4 rules. The rules are detailed in an
appendix called "Integration with High Guard" in Book 2 of Striker. (The
vehicle combat rules themselves are detailed in Striker-Book1.)

If you like CT Book 4, I strongly recommend you get hold of a copy of
the original Striker boxed set. It has wargame statistics for all the
weapons from Mercenary in it. Plus compatability rules for CT.

How does one subscribe to the Jtorps mailing list?

Just kidding!   Hm, you can remove your claws from my face
now.

MHO about J-torps:
1) For delivering mail:  It seems to me that unmanned jump torps for
delivering mail would be unreliable;  no engineer on board, no
guarantees of how things go once the jump is completed, no defense
mechanisms, etc.  Sending email through j-torps means taking the risk
of losing your mail.  Also j-torps cannot carry parcels, just data.
It seems to me that market pressures would push j-torps use to a few
niche markets; 1. Bulk mail  2. Military uses.
1. Bulk mail is rarely urgent, so the jump drives would be
something like J-2 rating on average.  This is consistent with the
rate of information progpagation across the imperium.
2. Military uses is what Dulinor used. :)

2) As a weapon:  The only problem I see with this is that if you use
a relatively realistic drive (i.e. no reactionless plates) your
missile will need a lot of fuel, and so be on a size comparable with
very small starships.  Not a stealthy weapon at all.  You also need
to feed your nav computer with accurate intelligence so as to hit the
right target. Intelligence gathering is relatively expensive, and now
your have to risk million-credit missiles on it.    Not a very good
gamble.
There are 2 ways out of these problems; One is to use micro-jump
missiles, which reduces your need for intelligence, fuel, and since
you only need a jump-1 drive your missiles can be quite small.  IN
fact this could be a very good strategic weapon, if you coordinate
your fleet with your j-torp/j-missile arrivals.
The second idea would be to not send a simple j-missile, but an
actual warbot with strategic planning programs.  The size of a medium
starship, it can jump into a system, latch onto an ore-rich asteroid,
deploy its autofactor and starts building an arsenal in-system.  Of
course this is a long-term device but it would be almost undetectible
until it\'s too late for the ennemy.  I admit this is more far-fetched
but hey, it sounds fun to me. :)

Maybe I should warn you that my Traveller world uses modified
HepLar engines (very low fuel consumption in athmosphere - but if oyu
need to manuever in space, you better plan it beforehand!) and
instantaneous communications in very limited cases - and it still
feel very Traveller-esque.  So maybe you should take my ideas with a
grain of salt. :)

Me:
Hmm... I guess I don\'t see how anybody (you included) can avoid making
arbitrary restrictions on j-torp technology. Steve and I arbitrarily
restrict them by assuming high production costs. You arbitrarily
restrict them by assuming they can\'t exist. (At least, I think that\'s
what you assume; this thread has been going on so long now that I may
not remember correctly! (^8"  ) Every game system requires restrictions.
And when the game is about something that does not exist (and can not
exist!) like "Jump Drive," these restrictions are going to be arbitrary.
There\'s no way around it!

The only non-arbitrary solution is to abolish all jump drives, in
torpedoes and in anything else. But I don\'t propose to adopt any
solution so reasonable as that. It just wouldn\'t be fun! 8^)

Hokeyness is a perennial problem in all science fiction, Traveller
included. Since arbitrary restrictions on magical technology cannot be
avoided, one has to cover up the hokeyness with well reasoned
environments and good old fashioned showmanship. I always thought that
CT did a particularly good job with this. It\'s why I like the game.

I couldn\'t agree more with the principle. But I need to point out that
j-torps are not "new." They\'ve been around for quite awhile now. Longer
than FFS by a decade.

Back to the old argument regarding military tactics. I believe
you said words to the effect of, "J-torps make it safer for a scout ship
to jump into an enemy-occupied system. A scout ship can launch a j-torp back
to the main fleet faster than it or a companion could jump back itself.
In the pre-j-torp universe, such scouts might be blasted before they got
a shot at returning."

I don\'t think the tactical situation will be any different with
or without j-torps. Here\'s why: The scout mother ship can launch a
subsidiary starship as fast as it could launch a torpedo. (See the Book
5 rules for launching ships.) The way I see it, the introduction of
j-torps changed nothing in the cannon. At least not in this instance.

It seems my analogy doesn\'t hold. You are quite right.

However, the issue of the  marginalisation of the X-Boat Service depends
whether we are talking about the X-Boat operation itself or the X-BOAT
SERVICE as an organisation. If we are talking about the X-boat runs
themselves, I agree completely that they would be cut out when it came to
transporting urgent messages. If we are talking about the X-BOAT SERVICE as
an organisation capable of making R&D and investment choices relating to
what it considers to be its core business - transporting information, then
it is likely that it would introduce the j-torps to its service and would
restructure accordingly.
The Railways, as large organisations, initially established the first
transcontinental telegraph to coordinate their own rail operations.

  The only essential central theme will be the Traveller history - as

important - if rules were important T$R would have gone broke long ago.

it "perfect."  The best thing we can do is buy, buy, buy - that will keep

I did.  The message they recieve off of a j-torp is 1 week old.  You
2 week number depends on an arbitrary assumption about what they
are doing and what they are going to do next.  Quibles about how
old the information is when they finish depends on what they
do with the info and is just semantics.

The Imperium didn\'t restrict X-boats.  They just chose to build
the network at jump-4 (and nobody else has the means or the desire
to build their own).  Restricting j-trops to jump-4 is like
resticting people from building jump-6 ships.  It\'s a significant
change in the background.  As I already mentioned, you have to
explain why they did it, how people in the Imperium feel and
react to the restiction, how they can enforce it, why you don\'t
see them outside the Imperium, etc. (and those explinations will
each have their own consequenced).

But even then, you aren\'t out of the woods.  Even at jump-4 j-torps
offer service to the majority of worlds that don\'t reside, meaning
that being on the X-boat network doesn\'t mean much.  Also, you have
the problem that if j-torps are availble how were some people able
to get news of Stephon\'s death faster by mainting hugely expensive
networks of jump-6 couriers.  Additionally, not matter what the
timing, a jump torp is a way of getting information about a system
without risking ships.  These are only the problems that have come
up so far.

>If outracing an X-boat
>route makes a problem for your campaign, then you need to come up with
>an explanation for why it never (or rarely) happens.

Outracing X-boats with expensive systems of jump-6 couriers is
a part of the Traveller background (it\'s how a select few have been
able to get a monopoly on timely information).  Introducing torps
that make the capability widely available fundamentally changes
that.  Reread the description of how word of Stephon\'s death
was spread and who benefited.

>I think I\'ve thought through the background pretty well.

So do I, and I\'m not impressed by claims that you are somehow
more up on the problem.  Particularly when I don\'t find the
arguements themselves that convincing.

The problem there is that such news was only available to a select
few because of the huge expense of maintaining a fleet of jump-6
couriers.  Jump torps make this available to factions that didn\'t
have the news.

You have a technology that is so useful to PC\'s but has no affect on
the society as a whole?  Even without the problems mentioned above
this strains credulity.

First of all, effecting how the Imperium relates to the X-boat

Apples and Oranges.  The problem is that you aren\'t sending your
Fed Ex drones through space where they can\'t run into anyone or
anything, but into airspace crowded with civilian traffic flying
over more innocent people.  Also, you preprogram a ship to jump
and off it goes (one of the reasons for postulating j-torps in
the first place), unlike flying an plane.

I don\'t dislike the Traveller system, it was a very goodone for it\'s

gaming had made (plus I like GURPS :-).  Or, to put it another way, I
was looking for background for GURPS and Traveller was always my style.

I wrote yesterday suggesting the use of Striker rules. (Rule #75 from Book
2) I\'ve since re-read rule 75 and saw that it was pretty simple so I
thought I\'d outline it here:

CT Book-2 starships have a Striker armor factor of 40. To find the hits
on a starship, roll two dice on High Guard\'s hit result table. Add six
to the result. Then add the Striker Armor Factor (40). Then subtract the 
weapon\'s Striker penetration value.

Then look on the HG table; you have your hit!

Here are the penetrations (at effective range) of some of Mercenary\'s
weapons according to the Striker rules (which are now out-of-print):

	Some things to note:

Striker Combat between starships is a very different animal than regular
starship combat with Book-2 or High Guard rules. Just about every hit
with a beam or pulse laser will result in Critical damage, and turns are
30 seconds long instead of ~20 minutes.

This shouldn\'t be too surprising since Striker combat ranges are on the
order of 10 to 100 km, whereas CT Book-2 ranges are on the order of
100,000 to 1,000,000 km.

This makes Striker starship combat far more brief and more exciting than
the normal style at long distances. Something to keep in mind when you
close on a vessal to board it...	8^)

Even at jump-4, starships offer service to the majority of worlds.
A starship can deliver any message a j-torp can. The introduction
of j-torps adds nothing to this situation.

How would the introduction of j-torps make the capability any more
widely available than starships? J-torps can\'t do anything a starship
can\'t do. To say that j-torps destroy the CT background is tantamount to
saying that starships destroy the CT background. Since starships do not,
in fact, destroy the CT background, it follows that j-torps don\'t
either.

This doesn\'t strain credulity at all. My players have a starship. They
NEVER book passage on liners. And yet the loss of their business somehow
does not put the big merchant princes into bankruptcy. That\'s because
most people do not own starships. Just like most people do not own
j-torps. Players are not most people.

The fact that my players\' characters own a starship has a profound
effect on their lives. It does not, however, make one bit of difference
to the CT background regarding liners.

All of the problems you mentioned for drones can be gotten around. The
one problem that can\'t be gotten around is one you don\'t mention.
Expense. Widespread use of drones is economically unfeasible.

Comparing x-boats to j-torps, it seems to me that the latter will have a
limited storage, significantly higher cost and (marginally) lower guarantee
of arrival. I believe that for all major routes, the economies of carrying
the gigagigagigagigabytes of data which will go between systems will make
the x-boats the only sensible option (we\'re not just talking electronic
postcards here - remember the amount of banking, administration, etc. data
which must pass between major systems - all heavily encrypted). To carry the
same amount of data as an x-boat you might need to have 10 or more j-torps.
Which if they\'re not recovered add to the garbage floating in space (even a
self-destruct leaves debris).

Another consideration is the law. A j-torp entering a system from jump is
small and difficult to detect; even with automatic collision advoidance,
there may have been incidents in the past where such things nearly hit other
spacecraft or (more likely) were fired upon as potential missiles. Having a
pilot along (ala x-boat) gives you someone to blame and someone to take
action when the computer runs out of ideas...

For Leviathan, the ship was operating in a _frontier_ area. It _couldn\'t_
use x-boats and the rules restricting j-torp usage wouldn\'t apply because of
the lack of shipping in the area. There seems to me no reason whatsoever why
such an expeditionary group couldn\'t have got special dispensation to use
j-torps.

There has been some discussion on military usage. Naturally this would be
less restricted (since the military tend to ignore or make the rules as
suits them). No, they\'re not inherently faster than using normal ships to
carry messages but they do have a stealth advantage. This could lead to a
sudden proliferation of jump-capable attack torpedoes for world bombardment,
much like the asteroid/mass-driver attack discussion which we had some
months back (no, please, don\'t start that up again!).

PSIONICS STEPS IN...

Not j-torps no, but it is known that the Imperium uses psi\'s for its own
intelligence purposes and some psi\'s can communicate telepathically across
interstellar distances. In my games this is used as the Emperor\'s private
commo system to all his sector governors. It\'s only used in emergencies, but
it does allow him to act before anyone else gets word via the x-boat system.
Then there are his groups of psionic advisers who look into the future,
check the minds of all around for assassins, etc. The Emperor in my games
really is the power centre of the Imperium and much of the feudal hierarchy
of dukes, et al. is sustained by his power rather than just on the say of
some voting body like the Moot!

THE IMPERIAL BOOT

Oh, and when people are talking about whether common ships (e.g.
adventurers\' ships) can be jump 6, etc. then I would point you toward the
care with which Han Solo in Star Wars had to hide his ship\'s capabilities,
and compare it with traffic police today. Anyone with big engines and (for
starships) weapons who can\'t show why they need them is going to be in
trouble. Every ship that lands at every major starport should be visited by
customs, quarantine, safety engineers, etc. for landing checks.
Irregularities are quickly noticed unless carefully camouflaged...

"Morning, sir."
Jake Blaine noticed the slight edge of sarcasm in the customs sargeant\'s
voice. The compupad was in the man\'s hand, carefully angled so Jake couldn\'t
quite see what was on the screen but the officer\'s eyes kept sweeping down
it as though he had to keep reminding himself of a substantial list of
irregularities.
"Anything... wrong?" Nervous, though Jake, and added quickly "Officer?" in a
more confident and friendly tone.
"This ship\'s license never seems to have been updated to include the engine
upgrade..." said the officer, steely eyes staring into Jake\'s.
"Ah, well, I felt it was a little underpowered-"
"It is a trader, sir?"
"Yes, of course-"
"And the 6-G drives save you time getting out to the jump point, eh, sir?"
"Yes, of course-"
"And it would just be ridiculously silly of me to think that these drives
would be for out-running customs ships, wouldn\'t it?" The man assumed a
fixed lupine smile.
"Er, yes - it\'s purely the jump point-"
"Hmmm."
Jake fell silent.
"Anything else?" asked the officer.
"Errr..."
"Like a complete history of the local universe, isn\'t it sir?"
"Sorry?"
"Well, clearly the economy is tightening for speed to jump point to be so
critical as to invest MILLIONS OF CREDITS on the extra drives, then there\'s
the clear indication that star law enforcement is waning and piracy is on
the increase..."
"Whaa?"
"I refer of course to the extra pop-up turret. And clearly the pirates are
becoming more sophisticated, hence your need for long range jamming
equipment-"
Jake choked but the officer continued.
"-which, to prevent falling into the hands of any boarders, you thoughtfully
concealed beneath the deck plates under two of the passenger cabins... then
your personal armoury-"
"Ship defence!" coughed out Jake.
"Hmmm." The officer began reading from the list. "Two suits battledress, two
FGMP-15, two PGMP-14, ten Gauss rifles, 5000 rounds of ammo... that was just
in the FIRST locker we opened... then in the hold... how exactly did you get
hold of a grav\' tank, Mr. Blaine?"
..

whereas:

"Morning, your excellency."
Duke Josiah Deerguard made note of the appropriate deference in the customs
captain\'s voice.
"No problems I hope?" asked the Duke rhetorically, some inflection or tone
somehow managing to convey the messages that there had better not be or (a)
the officer would get an earful, (b) whichever engineer or administrator
among the Duke\'s staff had failed in their duty would be looking for a new
job.
"None sir. I just wanted to explain the extra few minutes delay in
processing your landing forms because of the extra checks we\'re obliged to
make now on the new Duplenix Jump-6 drives. I\'m glad to say that yours are
in perfect working order. No doubt a necessity to a diplomat of such

PERSONAL WEAPONS VS. STARSHIPS IN CT

Hmmm, everyone\'s answered this one already, but I would like to reiterate
Charles\' canon quote (from a wide variety of CT books) that "...an average
hull can take 1000 points of "personal weapons" damage from lasers before a
man-sized hole is made. Even an iris valve can take 100..." and I usually
rule that this is assuming they are making a careful effort to cut/blast
said hole. Using a FGMP at close range to do this is dangerous because you
will get significant back-blast (molten metal, et al) from the energy bolt
hitting the hull. To put it in perspective, yes it\'s a canon quote (from
Mercenary I think) that a ship\'s laser makes a 50 meter radius crater/blast
area when fired at the ground.

CONTRA-GRAV & ANTI-GRAV

Phillip McGregor pointed out the problem with (particularly TNE) that
manoeuvre drives are supposed to be contra-grav now, so ships can just hover
in to land with no need for streamlining even on a world with an atmosphere.

Well, in my games I rule that:
(a) All grav\' devices create a gravitational force. They don\'t just
neutralise gravity. i.e. it\'s just like any other thrust-based system - it
has to be directed and controlled. And you can just hover downward through
the air, but any bricks had better hope that they don\'t try landing on a
\'just more than 1G\' world or a world with high winds, etc.

Alternatively, you could rule:
(b) That contra-grav does neutralise gravity but that this is not on an
automatic 1:1 basis, i.e. considerable amounts of control are required to
ensure the gravitic forces are balanced. So a grav\' cart is easy - always
used at the same altitude on the starport field, it needs only a single
setting to always hover 6" off the ground. However, when it meets a 9"
barrier, it doesn\'t just \'lift itself\' over - it can be lifted to a new
height by a user (e.g. to 12"), and will then stay there - the difference in
c-g settings is so minimal that the unit will act a bit like one of those
ceiling lights on a spring that you can pull down to a given height and it
always stays there until adjusted. Naturally flying a grav\' vehicle or ship
is a slightly more complex matter, and that\'s why you still need pilots to
do it. Remember that a c-g non-streamlined ship which gets blown off course
when landing is a bit like a balloon with a propeller engine - i.e. not very
controllable. The restriction on having at least minimal streamlining might
well be a legal requirement for landings, to ensure no mishaps occur. Then
again, worlds with a lot of floating grav cities may be so used to the
concept that flying bricks are (literally) a part of their existence...

    'body' => 'David P. Summers have been arguing about the un-canonicality of jump
torpedoes
for a while now. However, it is quite possible to make a jump torpedo without
violating the 100 T drive envelope restriction. The concept is simple: You
take a jump engine (actually you only need the jump capacitor part of a jump
engine, but I don\'t think we know just how big a percentage of a jump engine
is capacitors). Around that you erect a collapsible framework or inflate a
ballon or something similar. You then put a jump net around it (The most 
elegant solution would be a ballon with the jump net already around it; the 
framework suggestion is just to anticipate any arguments about wether such
a ballon can be fashioned with TL 9+ technology). You use your own computer 
and your own jump engine to energize the torpedo capacitors. In the period 
of grace you have before the capacitors have to be discarded (the same 
period of grace you use to get drop tanks away from a ship that uses them) 
you uncouple the torpedo and push it away from your ship.

The size of a torpedo thus becomes about size of a jump drive, minus the
engine part of a drive plus the message medium, radio, collapsible framework
or balloon and the jump net. Roughly 2+ T for a jump-1 torpedo up to 7+ T
for a jump-6 torpedo. It should be reusable, though.

Now, if I were to run "Leviathan" I would make the jump torpedoes work this
way to avoid discussions with the players.

$0.02 worth.

Using FFS, I constructed a TL-14 X-boat with 1,000 (yes, I said *one
thousand*) flight computers in addition to the five model Fb computers. 
Why?  Well, because:

	a) I needed something to replace the non-existant maneuver drive
(and fuel);

	b) I needed a way to simulate the "extensive array of databanks"
the damn things supposedly had (but never really did in the official
write-ups) since the earliest days of CT.  

Why use flight computers?  Because for X MCr, I could have Y TL-14 Mod Std
computers, or Y*1000 TL-14 Mod Flt computers.  If each flight computer
(which is 1/10 the size and mass of a standard computer) has just 1/20
(i.e., 5%) the data storage capacity of a standard computer, I\'ve still
crammed *fifty* times the capacity of a standard computer for the *same*
cost!  

What does this have to do with the discussion, you ask?  Well, since an
X-boat can carry such a *huge* amount of data (at least, in my campaign),
it now becomes economically feasible for the IISS to run the X-boat
Network.  

And as for the jump-torps, I\'ve built one using FFS that had *one* flight
computer in it.  That\'s one-tenth of one percent of the capacity of an
X-boat.  

Conclusion: X-boats *are* feasible, and so are jump-torps; but each in
their own special circumstances.  The analogy of the X-boat Network being
the USPS and the jump-torps being FedEx is a good one.

Hope this helps!

I actually tried to design something like this.  I was working on a
socket liferaft using FFS.  I think that I designed a three-ton module
that had j-4 and a cold berth that could be run for up to 50 years or
so.

The toughest part was designing it to fit into such a small space.

You could theoretically design a j-liferaft where upon exit from
j-space, the pilot puts himself into cold sleep.

I would think that the pilot would put himself into cold sleep upon
insertion into J-space----it is a escape so, by definition, the place
you\'re leaving pretty much has to be in worse condition than the place
you\'re going.

You success in jumping is basically already established when you start
the jump.  You set everything up before hand and then you push the button.
Once you are in jump space there is little for a human to do.

Actually, it would be the opposite.  Jump torpedoes would be used
just like X-boats, to send data, particularly urgent data.

And now you have to explain why a few factions in the Imperium
went to the huge expense of mainting fleets of j-6 couriers
and why j-torps didn\'t make such information much more widely
available.

Not really.  The math is trivial.  The problem is that your definition
of "old" depends on how long it takes to get to a certain point in one
course of action arbitarily chosen from a whole set of possibilities.
In fact, I can think of one where the information from the torp is
not only not 2 weeks old, but it isn\'t even 1 week old (you send
it into the system and jump near the system to recieve the data).

Well what you said was...
"Well, actually I DO want to impose a j-4 restriction on them"

If the Imperium isn\'t restricting them, what is?  Are you going
to arbitrarily say they can\'t go faster than j-4?

You did also try and claim the restriction was besides the point
because otherwise civilian ships need to be restricted to
avoid out racing X-boats.  Specifically, you said...
"but that\'s
beside the point. If you allow civilians j-5 and j-6 drives, then they
can build ships that can outrace the X-boats."

However, this only points up one of the problems with j-torps.  The
fact that only a few factions of the Imperium can afford the huge cost
of keeping up a network of j-6 couriers means that they can out-race
the X-boat network and get important info before anyone else.  The
high cost of j-6 ships is a partial restriction, and cheaper J-torps
make such a information available to factions that can\'t keep of a
network of couriers.

>Even at jump-4, starships offer service to the majority of worlds.

To many worlds, visits of any ship, let alone a jump-6 ones, are
infrequent.  With jump torps a world can keep torp sitting around
to send off if they need.  It hardly pays to keep a jump-6 ship
and a crew just sitting around.

[Regarding jump-torps vs networks of jump-6 couriers...]

Fine if a jump-torp costs as much as jump-6 courier and requires
a crew as costly just keep around.  Regardless of the implausibility
of this (which has already been covered), let me ask...  Do you charge
the cost of a jump-6 courier ship to your PC\'s for every jump-torp
they have?  Do you require them to maintain an whole new crew just
to use one?  The cost of a jump-6 network is prohibitive to all but
a few, cheaper jump-torps makes such networld pointless.

Most people don\'t own starships, but everytime someone sends a message
it goes by some who does.  And just like jump-torps affect your PC\'s,
they affect these people (and those who might be able to compete
with them if jump torps were around.)  By affecting how every message
is sent, they affect the whole Imperium.  You want a technology that
is important to your PC\'s to have no affect on the Imperium, technology
doesn\'t work that way.

It depends on what you mean by "gotten around".  The problems
of your drones are more fundamental than for jump torps (as
I pointed out).

>The

>Expense. Widespread use of drones is economically unfeasible.

Because the cost of totally restructuring the air traffic system,
and resticting a very profitable passenger system, makes the
cost of such a system more than an order of magnitude than
the system now in use?  Are you claiming that j torps cost more
than a jump-6 ship?  (see comments above).

However, if you could "get around" the problems, then your drones
would, in fact, marginalize Fed. Ex.  However, this wouldn\'t
actually happen because Fed. Ex. is already being margninalized
by fax and e-mail (just like X-boats and mail boats would be
marginalized by jump torps).

The restriction on jump-torps is based on a minumum size for a jump
unit which is easy to accept and also fits with other aspects of the
game (like why there aren\'t an ships under 100 tons).

I agree it\'s a perennial problem, which is why one needs to
be on the look out for it.  A friend was telling me about the
one-suspension of disbelief rule.  Most people will allow
you to suspend disbelief one fact to set up a story.  If you
keep forcing someone to suspend belief on facts, things just
become more and more hokey.

Traveller is based on the belief that FTL travel is possible.
Everything else is pretty much a logic extrapolation off of how
they have set it up and how techology might have evolved. (there
a few minor things, but it\'s too late to try and remove them).

The problem with j-torps is that, to be done believably, you
really have to follow through with all the logical consequences.
This involves fundamental changes to the background.  It would
be a playable background, but it would be a different one.

They were mentioned in one adventure, not written my Marc Miller, and

GDW and, after they realized the consquences, they just quietly

No.  That wasn\'t my scenario.  There are a lot of scenario\'s.  You
set up a torpedo for two jump-3\'s (or make one a bit bigger so it
can do two jump-6\'s) and have in jump in and out of an unknown system.
Or you send in a torp that broadcasts sensor information and you jump
in near the system and monitor broadcasts as you come in through normal
space.  Or you have spy ship and it uses jump torps to send back
periodic reports without having to leave the system.  You can keep
coming with such secenarios.

Looking at it more fundamentally, Having to risks ships to jump into
a unknown system is one of the basic dilema\'s in Traveller, as is the
inability to send reports back without lessening your strength or
abandoning the position.  After all, jump torps make communications
easier and difficult communications is a fundamental premise of the
Traveller background.  They can\'t help but affect it.

Um, no.  I\'ve been arguing they mess up the background.

[actually proposal on how to get around size restrictions and make
a jump torpedo deleted.]
You might be able to find a loophole in the rules to make a jump
torp.  This isn\'t the point.  Since they mess up the background,
you either don\'t try and interpret the ruless to make them
possible, rewrite the background, or play with fundamental
inconsistencies in your setting.

The problem with j-torps is that they change the background.  If you
are willing to rewrite the background (which, to do a good job, is
a non-trivial task since there are a lot of issue to address) all
well and good.

This has already been covered in other people\'s posts, we already can
store enough information in a small enough space.

>significantly higher cost

Already covered by others.  Basically, there is no reason they should
be so expensive and to not have any affect at all they have to cost
more than a jump-6 ship and it\'s crew, which makes them mostl pointless
(ie you can\'t have it both ways, if they are cheap enough to be useful
they will be used and affect the background).

Even X-boats don\'t carry all the informtion transfered between systems.
You have mail ships, but the use of X-boats to carry imporant, timely,
information has marginalzied them to cargo and unimportant data.
Even if a jump torp can\'t carry a similar amount of info (which is
debatable) as an x-boat, the ability to carry the most important
data will marginalize the X-boat network just as the X-boat network
marginalizes mail ships.

Even ignoring the fact that the amount of space 10 diameters out from a
planet is huge and probabilities of loosing a ship by such collisions
is going to be miniscule compared to other things that go wrong, the
fact is that by simply broadcasting it\'s location a jump torp won\'t
be any harder to detect than a ship.

[Regarding military usage.]
The main use is not as weapons, but to find out if a system is safe
before you send in ships.  This has already been discussed.

The j-torps originally came from Leviathan (CT), in the ensuing debate

Myself I\'ve never even got hold of the MT rules, let alone the TNE rules,
so references to them are difficult to follow.

I do remember haveing a go with the MT ship construction rules, I tried
putting a Type-S together, and found I needed something like 8500 cubic
meters of fuel - in a 1400 cubic meter ship!

This is not to critisise the MT rules, the construction rules were a good
attempt to try to use a single system.

Being a fan of CT, and sticking to this system, I try to avoid having to
resort to MT and other sources, as I find they do mess a few things up.

Its very usefull to see how other people run their games, but not usefull
to say "that\'s wrong... In *my* game...".

Its good to be able to put ideas up here to get comments on them, but
they are always going to be in the context of that referees "house

Subject: Thanks

First I would like to thank everyone (especially Robert Flammang and
his "Striker" post who responded to my "starship damage" line.  It
has helped a lot.  If there are any more ideas out there please
keep them coming.

I may be out of place here, but I would like to make a request.
When I signed up on Xboat, I thought it was an extremely good
resource for trying to get a handle on rules that I thought were
vague--by seeing how other people handled them.  I could then
chose the interpretations I liked and disregard the rest.  Each
ref. has his universe:  if its workable, ref and players alike
have a great time,  if its to "hokey" (to use a recent xboat
word) the ref. usually finds himself without any willing players.

I\'m going on about all this due to the recent Mass Driver Masequer,
Tech Wars, and now The Nth J-torp war.  People present their ideas
on Xboat because they work for them and their players; in such
a situation there is no right and wrong.  If a ref. is a no-nonsense
stiff rules-are-law type and it works for him--thats great.  If
some of us bend the rules a bit thats OK too.  (Rebellion--what
rebellion?  Stephron--who\'s he?  These aren\'t in my rules so I don\'t
really mind if J-torps mess this up.  Yes players can use them but
they also open up opportunities for me as ref.  You cant slam me for
using them any more than I can slam you for progressing with newer
rules and sticking tightly by them)

In short, everyone\'s E-mail address comes with their post.  If you
simply MUST argue, do it off xboat.  Once you\'ve worked out a mutual
solution THEN (by all means) let the rest of us know the outcome.
Lets have the atmosphere on Xboat be a little more friendly and
cut down on the number of incredibly long posts with people bickering.

(As a start, if your going to whollop me for sending this post--spare
everyone else and send it to me direct)

On a positive note:  This is an incredible resource, full of good ideas.
Lets keep it going.

Thanks

Tom Trelenberg

(P.S.  I\'ll mention again that if anyone knows where to get Superior Model\'s
Starfleet Wars miniatures (i.e. collector\'s clubs, etc...) please let me
know.  Thanks)

David, even though jump torpedoes are perfectly possible under CT, you\'d
still need ships (or space stations) to fire them off. The torps have to be
sent off from somewhere away from a gravity field. The torpedo capacitors
have to be energized by a jump engine and programmed by a sufficiently
large computer. Unless you want to throw the torpedo away (an expensive
way of sending a message) you need a ship at the destination to go fetch
it. If you don\'t want the torpedo to broadcast the message when it gets
to its destination, you _have_ to go fetch it in order to get the message.
Even then the torpedo has to broadcast a homing signal, which will hardly
enhance its popularity among people who went to such a lot of trouble to
keep their J-6 couriers secret as we\'re told they did. In short you need at
least one ship per node of a J-torp network. Plus the support structure to
keep the nodes manned (shipped? ;-) all the time. Add to this the impossi-
bility of keeping a J-torp network secret and the convenience of being able
to convey live people secretly by the couriers and I see plenty of reason
for the existence of Imperialines and equivalent networks.

If you\'re near enough to recieve the data in less than a week then you\'re
near enough to collect it yourself. Besides, scout ships are _not_ at risk
when jumping into a strange system. Star systems are big places. If they
choose someplace off the main intra-system trade routes (like somewhere
off the plane of the system) the odds of a defensive ship being within
attack range of their point of emergence is vanishingly small.

But with couriers you don\'t need a network to outrace the X-boat net. You
only need ONE J-6 courier. Granted that it will loose a day refuelling at
each intermediary system, but it will still outrace the X-boats. Given
pre-placed fuel dumps the loss can be cut to hours. And expensive as they
are, there are thousands of worlds with the budget to keep one courier
stationed permanently at Capital (I don\'t think many would, but they could.
Certainly there are not a single sector-wide organisation that couldn\'t
afford it. Heck, there must be universities in the Spinward Marches that
could afford it). Compare that to the cost of keeping a ship on standby for
every 6 parsecs the message must travel, and the J-torp network dosen\'t
seem nearly as attractive.

(And, yes, I know that Imperrialines have many couriers. Certainly. That
enhances the flexibility of the system and allow you to routinely send
messages back and forth at J-6; and such a system is propably too
expensive for anybody except for the Navy, the Scouts, the Bureaucracy,
the Archdukes and the 14 Megacorporations. But a cut-rate system, one
that only allows you to recieve advanced warning of truly portentous
events, is within the budget of any cut-rate government and sector-wide
corporation.)

But that\'s just what they have to have in order to send a J6 torpedo. You
can\'t send a torpedo without a jump engine and a computer.

Not so implausible after all, as I\'ve just demonstrated.

No, of course not. All it costs them is the price of the torp itself and the
storage space it takes up (which is _not_ insignificant to the average free
trader). And of course they can\'t use torps of a higher jump number than the
ship\'s engine.

But wich dosen\'t actually restrict jump torps at all. The true restriction
is that you need a comparable jump engine placed outside a gravity field
in order to send them off. (And a ship to fetch them unless you want to
pay (what is it, jump engines are 3 MCr per ton, arent they?) 21 MCr per
message. Even if we decide that the capacitors alone are only 10% of the
price of a jump engine (an assumption that I don\'t believe myself  -  I
think those zuchai are quite expensive) you\'re still talking 2+ million
credits for a torp. Oh, you\'d definitely want a ship around to fetch
them in.)

Now, that isn\'t possible under the rules unless you include the necessary
fuel for the second jump _and_ the engine in the design. Even then you
have to define that it is possible to calculate a second jump a week
ahead. It may be, but that is not established anywhere. But if you can,
you can do the same with an unmanned ship.

I already have, but I was running a whole planet in a TCS campaign so I
used multiple scout ships for the spy system. Believe me, when you have the
ressources of a world you don\'t strain at using a few score scouts to
set up spy posts.

You don\'t risk ships by sending them into a strange system if you\'re
intelligent about it. And you don\'t lessen any force that includes
10,000-100,000 T ships by detatching couriers. Compared to the cost of
the big starships, the cost of a couple of hundred couriers is
insignificant.

That wasn\'t a loophole. That\'s the logical concatenation of a couple of

Well, first of all, you haven\'t convinced me that they do mess up the
background. A J-torp network won\'t be nearly as cheap as you think, and
it would have several downsides.

But now you\'re the one who is trying to impose arbitrary restrictions on
the setting. I\'ve just demonstrated that a jump torpedo is possible under
the rules. What are you going to do when one of your players works out a
proper description, walk into Bilstein Yards and plunk down the money to
have a prototype built and then try to flog it to the Navy? Are you going
to have the Navy procurement officer draw himself up haughtily and say:
"Sah! _Gentlemen_ daun\'t use jump tahpedoes! Begaune!" ?

I\'d much rather try to convince my players that a J-torp network isn\'t in
use in the Imperium because it\'s inferior to couriers (Or even that a smart
X-boat manufacturer had "convinced" the Imperium of that). At least I\'d have
a shot at making my players believe me. Saying: "You can\'t, because I say
so!" has a tendency to irk them.

We already know that the reason the X-Boat network isn\'t J-6 is a political
decision, so that\'s why they don\'t use J-6 torpedoes. The people who can
afford a J-torp network can also afford a fleet of J-6 cruisers, and there
are advantages to the cruisers that the torps lack. Thus the cruisers only
have to be in the neighbourhood of the J-torp network, pricewise. And, of
course, there are one situation where a jump torp is still useful, even if
a manned courier is more versatile: When you have storage space for a torp,
but not for a courier. For _emergency_ messages. In fact, just the situation
that is described in _Leviathan_.

Trying to implement several solar system generators
made me wish there were a system that was relatively
exceptionless -- that is, there being few or no branches
to take in the process.  Such a system would be more
elegant and straighforward for implementation on a
computer.

Last weekend, I set up a loose framework for such a
system.  The idea behind it is here:

1) generate the number of orbits and
           the object in each orbit.  use a
           statistical process like 2d6 or 3d6...

2) calculate some value (based on the
      combined masses, for example) of the
           orbitals.

        3) use this value as an index into a table
           to determine the star type and class,
   as well as orbit and habitable-zone
           info for that star.

4) determine the orbits of each orbital,
   using its orbit number, neighboring
   masses, and any orbit multipliers
   based on star type.

The result: not bad.  It was very very easy to write
a 4k script to churn out 1000\'s of them, and the systems
seem to be reasonable.  I sacrificed some granularity
in my program (stars have no magnitude, just a class),
but that\'s not inherent in the algorithm.

Any suggestions or something I hadn\'t thought of?

Someone who will remain anonymous (popular guy, isn\'t he?) suggested to
me that there should be a nebula in the Empty Quarter.  As well as
obscuring the sight of that giant, it would make the area seem empty,
thus giving rise to \'the empty quarter\'.  Moreover, it would make people
in the sector have comparatively \'empty\' night sky\'s.

SWWRA was thinking about just obscuring the supergiant from Earth\'s line
of sight, but I\'m thinking of a massive, dense, sector-sized nebula.  Is
what I want possible?

This is all equally true of X-boats.  However, you certainly aren\'t
going to need a ship the size of an X-boat tender to handle
a jumptorp.  Regarding the issue of secrecy.  Even if small planetary
craft (even with the torp) were just a fraction of the cost of
a jump-6 courier, tight beam communications would be sufficient.

[Rest deleted]

OK, you are somewhat contridictory here.  You point out that you
need to be close enough to collect data but then claim you can
not be close to be safe from attack.  The fact is that a j-torp
could be sent right in 10 diameters from the main world, something
that could be too risky to do with a ship.  It can then broadcast
info which can be picked up by ships that have jumped to a point
outside of sensor range (and are relatively safe).

Firstly, as an aside, which is mostly irrelavent because it doesn\'t apply
to the jump networks the major factions did indeed maintain (because they
did, in fact, need them, read the Rebellion Sourcebook) but applies to
people like (taking your example) a university that wants fast
communications to one point.  For the cost of both the jump-6 ship and the
maintenance of a hole string a fuel dumps, you could probably have one guy
just sitting there with a communications setup (and call also be used for
general electronic espionage) who recieves the message and turns on the
next torp (and send messages faster and still save money).  This is
especially true of message over short distances because if you want to send
messages over only one or two jumps (like from one university to the other)
this is even more true since the large cost of the jump 6 ships dwarfs
everything else.  (As you think about jump-torps, you keep coming up with
more and more ways in which people would want to use them, which is exactly
why they cause so much trouble with the background.)

Secondly (and more importantly), if you want to spread information widely
and at the fastest possible speed (like the major factions needed to), you
need a network.  In travelling across the Imperium the continual loss for
refueling and
lifesupport replenishment (which you negelect), would meant that you message
would arrive weeks later than you oppositions.  Furthermore, having one
jump-6 ship will be useless if the message needs to go to more than one
place, or doesn\'t originate where you expect (you may need to send an
urgent message to the capitol).  For all these reasons, the major factions
in the Imperium did indeed find it necessary to maintain a whole network of
couriers, and it is this network that jump-torps would have rendered
obsolete.

This is exactly the point.  It is that hughly expensive system of couriers
that allowed some factions to get critical info first.  While a system
of torps would be expensive, the fact that would only be a fraction of
the cost of couriers would make available more widely.  Not to everone,
but to a lot more people than were actually able to have them in the
Rebellion sourcebook.

Um, no.  The jump torps that people talk about come with a jumpdrive
and small computer (this is why there are those discussion of how
small you can make a jump engine).  According to the rules, you
can\'t send anything that doesn\'t have it\'s own jump field generator.

If you do it this way things get worse because now one jump-6 ship,
which could only take a message to one spot, can now send messages
simulataneously to every world withing jump-6.

Not realistictic.  A real organization has limited resources and wasting

OK, I had real trouble understanding the point of that sentence, but
it appears to ingore the main dilemma.  If you keep your force together
to enter every strange system; a) you risk loosing the whole war in one
blunder, b) you can\'t respond to enemy activity else where (because you
need to keep that force as big as possible to deal with what you find
when you jump in).  If you send in scouts you suffer a stead attrition
of men and materials.

It was a debatable concatentation.  You were using the rules to address
issues that they clearly weren\'t intended to cover and blithly assuming
there would be no problems.  It\'s not an unreasonable _possiblity_
but it is just that, only a _possibilty_.

This is a matter of viewpoint I guess.  I find the attempt to have
jump-torps so useful in some cases but have no affect on
the background strained (for reasons scattered over many posts).
The idea that every ship needs a jumpdrive is, in fact, part of
the rules and, since we don\'t have a theory of how jump drives
work to contradict it, the idea that there would be a minumum
size to a jump drive is very reasonable.

Deciding that one introduce new technologies with out changing the
general setup, only to encounter major problems as the unforseeable
consequences of those technologies play themselves out is nothing
new.  It teaches us that new technologies get used and make a
difference.

Again, this can\'t be true.  If a jump torps costs as much as a j-6
cruiser to build and maintain there would be no point to them.
The fact that people are using jump-torps because they are
so much easier than sending a whole ship means that a network
of torps will, in fact, be that much easier to maintain that
a network of ships.

>When you have storage space for a torp,
>but not for a courier. For _emergency_ messages.

In fact you have pointed up yet another problem with jump torps.
They make emergency messages possible.  For example, a spy ship
can now send the info collected so far and then go into the
risk venture.  Before they had to way the risk of what they
might be able to collect against the fact that they might
not get anything back if they don\'t leave right then.  (For
me, facing such dilema\'s is a major part of gaming and to
just eliminate it by writing "jump-torp" on a sheet diminishes
the game).

1. Torpedoes are not manned.  They are not armed.  There is a
better chance of seeing Dulinor wearing a bright red suit than having
a military organization basically put sensitive intelligence in a
unmanned, unescorted 4 megacredit bottle big as a speeder.  Yes, it
might
be almost impossible for an ennemy to detect it, but the chance
exists.
Also you need 2 (30 MCr) ships to launch and gather the torpedo.
A single 30+ MCr courrier (given J-6 rating) might be more
economical,
and safer too.

Unless a *network* of J-torps is established, there is the problem of
knowing when to expect a torpedo.  MilSpec Message torpedoes will NOT
announce their arrival in a system.  They\'ll just wait for an encoded
radio signal to reach them and use a laser comm to instruct the
collector
ship of its position.  Unless there is an established routine, (or
you have autonomous j-torps, which are not much smaller than
courriers
after all), it will be costlier to use a j-torp than a courrier.

 there is no proof that they did not ALSO use J-6 message torpedoes.
This doesn\'t affect the Traveller background one bit.

2. Why aren\'t J-torps more common?
        Let\'s assume that they ARE rather common - as j-4 and j-6
 torpedoes.
 The J-4 torps seem less expensive than XBoat.  However there is
still
 the problem of autonomy and retrieval.  A Xboat route does not
simply
 carry messages either.  And XBoats are a guarantee of certain
Imperial
 standards.  Planets on XBoat routes are generally better off than
 planets who aren\'t on the routes.  So it is quite possible that
 most systems will lobby for a XBoat route instead of a JTorp route.

 What about the planets not on the routes?  They probably won\'t use
 JTorps because of obvious mail robbery problems.
 The place most likely to use such a route would probably be for
 aslans sending email back to their home quandrant through the rift.
There
 is very little reason to send parcels back, the few systems useables
 for that can be easily protected and each clan can have its own
JTorp
 route back to the main aslan equivalent of XBoats.

 As for J-6 torps, do they affect the background so much?
 Well, one way to see how their existance did not affect the
background
 so much is to realize that 6JTorps are a single, point-to-point
shot.
 There are no J-6 networks because they\'re too expensive (especially
 considering the various taxes imposed on J-6 drives by the
goverments:)
 and also because there aren\'t that many places where TL15 spaceship
 tech can be maintained - especially closer to the frontier.
 MegaCorps will gladly pay that much money when there is an emergency
-
 from one point to another.  Not as a network.  And MegaCorps keep
their
 info to themselves.  So the way the information spread does not
 necessarily contredicts the way it has when there were news of
Strephon\'s
 death, for instance.

 In any case, that is how I fit J-torps in my campaign and I don\'t
think
 it messes up the background at all.

 I suppose someone will have to come up with correct figures to see
if
 my argument holds up. :)

PS: Considering how malleable Jump Tech has been in the past (ah, the
glorious days of jump tugs :) I believe people should tolerate
J-torps
as at least semi-canon.  After all Leviathan was published by GDW. :)
Oh - there are only 2 rules against it, really:  The minimum size of
a
ship, and also that ships require at least 2 crewmen.  If you stick
to
the rule too much, you get some silliness.  Ah well, maybe if we
strap
the pilot and the engineer to the outside of the torpedo? :)

    'body' => 'Jump Drives, Improved Performance & Tech Levels

The standard Traveller Jump Drives are *allegedly* available from the pseudo-TLs
of 9-5
and, basically unchanged from CTrav, require (1 + JNo)% of Hull Volume for the
actual Drive and (5 x Drive Volume) for fuel. These are obviously *not* really
"new" TLs as they all cost 0.3 MCR per ton and mass 3 tons per cm to TL/13,
2.5 tons at TL/14 and 2 tons at TL/15. Only the latter two levels could really
be regarded as "new" TLs. Now, bear with me for a moment --

                    Maximum Drive
Jump Value          Mass    Fuel Mass       Mass/J1    Fuel/J1

J1                  2    10                 2           10
J2                  3    15                 1.5         7.5
J3                  4    20                 1.33        6.65
J4                  5    25                 1.25        6.25
J5                  6    30                 1.2         6
J6                  7    35                 1.16        5.8

(All figures are as a % of Hull Volume)

Obviously (and it confirms this in MTrav and TNE) the fuel requirements go down
for 1 Parsec Jump whenever a "new" TL of Jump Drive becomes available . . . but,
we are asked to believe, even a TL15 world capable of producing a J6 drive, can
only produce a TL9 equivalent *efficiency* J1 drive. In other words, that TL 15
world, capable of producing a 1 Parsec jump for 1.16% of Hull Volume in Drives
and 5.8% in fuel can only produce a standalone J1 Drive as inefficient as a J1
TL9 unit!

Surely they *should* be able to produce a J1 unit @ the reduced volume (and,
thus, reduced mass and cost) and reduced fuel requirement, as *should* be the
hallmark of any real improvement in technology? After all, at the higher TL,
they are more efficient art producing the effects of low tech and low tech
equivalent equipment with their hi-tech industrial base!

Again, it seems completely against all logic that "improved" technology is so un
realistically limited. It\'s like trying to get us to accept that a 1996 technolo
gy produced Maritime Steam engine would have the same hp/wt ratio and cost
the same in relative terms, not to mention having the same fuel efficiency, as a
n 18th century Newcomen & Watt Beam engine! In a word, unlikely! Seems to me tha
that you\'ve either got to accept that the TL rating system is seriously stuffed
in a purely
practical sense in that it cannot (well, *does* not) allow for these sorts of
improvements *or* you\'ve got to admit that J1 (and other J ratings less than the
current maximum) *should* reduce mass/fuel requirements as noted above.

Of course, those who treat FF&S (or MTrav, or CTrav) as "holy writ" won\'t come
at *either* idea -- after all, the "rules" state that J1 Drives are *always* 2%
Drive and
10% fuel *regardless* of the logical holes that the rest of the system punches i
into that -- or *has* punched into *it* as a result!

Sort of like Galileo and Copernicus refusing to believe that observable facts sh
owing that
the sun was the centre of the solar system just because the Pope\'s "rule book"
stated that teh earth was!

Sure, we\'re talking SF "pseudo-reality" here rather than the "real
world". but don\'t we have a right to expect some sort of system that *seems*
more real than Traveller allows.

OK. We accept (as someone noted recently) a number of "suspensions of disbelief"
to allow the game to work -- that is, gadgets or game system rules that are
completely ridculous (like the flat, 2d universe to make mapping workable) when
one
stops to think about them, or which are impossible according to our current
understanding of the universe (such as JDrives, CG lifters and Thruster Plates,
HePlaR drives, and Psionics). But the *rest* of the game system and background
has to have some semblance of corresponding to reality *or* we find our
boundaries of belief are strained beyond the point of credulity!

So, why should we accept, say, that a TL7 Portable Airlock (as described in the
Imperial Encyclopaedia, IIRC) is the last and final word in Portable Airlock tec
even at TL15-16 ... or at higher TLs? Are we to accept that such devices can
*never* be made more cheaply, of lighter but still as strong materials, or less
bulky materials? No! Nor should we, by this reasonable standard, assume that
JDrives never improve their efficiency and size for *old* models as *new* models
are introduced.

Well, that\'s my 2c worth anyway.

    'body' => 'Recently, I was trying to get a feel for the sort of volume of trade and
shipping which goes on in a place like the Marches. You get a vague feel of
\'Oh, such-a-number of Free-traders berthed at the port.\' and at places like
Rhylanor, a feeling of large landing fields, with numerous small freighters,
and an *unspecified* number of large merchantmen.

What I was after was an indication of the amount of shipping, hence the
amount of ships required, and also perhaps a feel for the flow of the
shipping. Kind of, bulk ore carriers go from here to there, and Machine
Parts go from this place to that place. In order to do this, I went back to
the economics of the situation with Adventure 5 (TCS), and Book 2 of Striker
for the formula for GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Without angering an
economists who might play Traveller, I wanted to get a justification for
        a) the amount of trade or spec cargoes available,
        b) the number of ships moving those cargoes,
        c) the direction the cargoes were headed.

I have created a spreadsheet for the adjusted GDP\'s of all the worlds in the
Marches, adjusted for their Tech Level, and for their Starport type. (a TL12
world with a Starport C has a credit worth roughly half that of a TL15 world
with Starport A). The TL15 Starport A credit is *The Imperial Credit*, and
can be roughly equated to the emotional value placed on the US Dollar diring
the middle to latter part of this century. It was accepted at face value,
even where it was not necessarily supposed to be accepted.

This spreadsheet has caused some surprises with the GDP of some planets, but
to determine trade, what I am really after is a feel for the percentage of
GDP which is exported/imported. For example, Australia exports approx. 12%
of GDP, and imports 14% (depending on the year in question.) In the same
year, the US exported 11% and imported 15% of GDP, and Uruguay (to take
datum points from all parts of the spectrum) exported 14%, and imported 20%!

Does anyone have any ideas for calculating the percentage of GDP which
becomes foreign trade? I don\'t care how complex they are (but hopefully they
can be expressed in Excel 5.0/7.0 and calculated in real time on a 486!) I
was hoping to consider the tech level, maybe law level, and starport type as
determinants in the final figure, although others may come to light.

Even at this stage, assuming 5% of GDP is sent off world, and (through MT
Ref\'s guide) the value of a ton of shipping is Cr4000, that is still an
awesome tonnage being moved. The most surprising example is Entrope
(0720/SM). While Rhylanor moves Cr8 Trillion as 5% of its Cr167 Trillion
GDP, this 40 *million* tons **PER WEEK**. Entrope has a GDP of Cr672
Trillion MEASURED IN IMPERIAL CREDITS. This represents 161 Million tons of
shipping per week. If you look at the map, *where does it GO*?? Mind you,
that would explain why the Sword Worlders want the Entropic worlds so badly.
Other High Ratings include Porozlo, Trin (before the TNE disaster), Mora,
Riverland, Jewell. These are not all the systems above 10 million tons per week.

With these sort of numbers, I want to really nail down a foreign trade
calculation. It does state a very good case for Bulk Carriers though. 1/2
million ton J3 or J4 freighters with set runs. Free traders pick up five
categories of cargo in this case.
        1) Overflow. Not enough to warrant an extra bulk freighter;
        2) Speculative or one-off trade, not locked into a shipping contract;
        3) Contract arguments, the old "I\'d rather send it by Nocturnal
Airlines!", so you get picked instead;
        4) Short runs, or runs to very low-GDP worlds (infrequent runs maybe);
        5) Niche markets.

This means that although the amount of trade assumed to be happening has
skyrocketed from my original impressions, and some places will have a bulk
freighter leaving every few hours, the trade tables will probably not have
to be revised. Also tradewars become rarer (Tukera is NOT going to be
interested in the average 200-ton trader or three), but much more intense
(the value of a single run has a lot of zeroes after it!) Ship encounters
will also be perhaps skewed in favour of (*Much*) larger ships in some systems.

If anyone is interested in the spreadsheet, let me know, and I will send a
copy of either the output, or the .XLS file, or if someone wishes to place
it on their web page or FTP site, I am happy to oblige, and inform the list.
The file is approx. 210Kb

I will publish more analysis, as I think of it. For example, looking at the
map, most of the high value worlds are best served by J3-J4 ships for urgent
freight.

Enjoy

Xboats aren\'t armed either.  They have security the same way torps
would.  The ship that launches the trop protects it at one end (or the
info gets sent on a tight beam moments before launch).  At the
other end all it has to do is send the info on a tigh beam
and then erase it.

You don\'t need expensive ships.  The cheapest thing is to
just preposition them in a distant orbit (perhaps even out
in the oort cloud) and just send the info on a tight beam.
Even if this wasn\'t true, you don\'t need expensive ships.
Any old interplanetary shuttle will do.  This are a small
fraction of the cost of a J-6 ship.

You answered your own problem.  The torp just sends the info to
a predetermined point.

XBoats have the same problem on a bigger scale.  An Xboat is
more trouble to retrieve than a torpedo.  Why do you think
there there is a class of ships designed just to tend X-boats?

OK, why doesn\'t the X-boat network convert to j-4 torps?  Why
don\'t you see j-6 ones in Vargr space and other places outside
of Imperial space?  Why weren\'t the jump-6 networks (which also
would have been taxed or kept secret) also converted
to trops.

(which would tell where the ship has been and what it saw there),
communication codes and protocols, and intelligence assessments made by
the ship\'s intelligence officer and by naval intelligence.  This
information could be accessed if the ship is boarded.

For this reason, warship computer security is strict.  Only certain
crew can access certain ship computer functions, and only at certain
times or with higher authorization.  The main security measure would
probably be retinal scanning, because it can be done through a vacc suit
(unlike DNA or fingerprints).  What about electroencephalograph
readings?  Societies making widespread use of psionics might have
computers with psionically activated switches.

Nevertheless, security can be hacked.  (A telekinetic PC once held a dead
crew member up to the retinal scanner and used his telekinesis to move
the corpse\'s eye left, right, up, down, as the computer ordered.)

For this reason, warship computers can be directed to purge their memory.
This purge can take the form of deletion of all information, including
how to run ship systems, or the computer can just delete all files
previously marked.  An analogy with the brain would be removing the whole
thing versus just a lobotomy.  Another purge format would delete ship\'s log
files in reverse chronological order, so that the most sensitive
information -- i.e., the most recent -- would be deleted first.  That
way, if the original owner retook the ship, it wouldn\'t have to rebuild
memory from scratch.

(though I doubt it :-).  This may be similar to something Wil Hostman (or
someone else?) wrote earlier, in which case I apologize in advance for
stealing his thunder.

The idea is this:  you allow J-Torps, but make them highly unreliable.
Specifically, they get a +5 to the misjump roll (if using CT.  For TNE,
the person launching the torp must roll a formidable test of engineering).
This gives the torp a high chance of misjump (41.66% using CT), and a
small chance of exploding (8.33% using CT).

Why is this a good thing, you ask?  Because such a torp, if reasonably
expensive, could not replace/marginalize the X-boat network, but it could
still be used to send out emergency messages (if they don\'t arrive where
you want them to go, they might at least arrive _somewhere_) and as
lifeboats.  This also minimizes the problem of J-torps being used as a
weapon (again, assuming relative expense).

One could justify this unreliability by saying that the 100 ton limit is
the limit for safe jumps and that objects below that volume have
problems.  For instance, one might say that objects from 50-99 tons
have a +3 DM to misjump and that anything below 50 tons gets a +5 DM.  These
figures are fairly arbitrary, but you get my drift.

Phil, before you quote FF&S again, I realize it puts no lower limit on
the size of jump capable ships, but that could be for any number
of reasons.  FF&S was supposed to be a technical architecture for all
sorts of backgrounds, and GDW may have wanted to allow the possibility
of small jump-capable craft in backgrounds other than the standard
Traveller one. Also, it may simply have been an ommision.  There are lots of
CT/MT sources which state the 100 ton limit, so I\'m going to take it as
canon despite the lack of mention in FF&S.

Finally, I would like to point out that the idea of an unreliable j-torp
is not incompatible with Leviathan.  The description in Leviathan is as
follows:

Jump Message Torpedoes:  Consists of little more than a jump drive, fuel
and a recording unit.  \'J-torps\' are used to send messages by
automatically broadcasting  a pre-recorded tape at the conclusion of
their jumps.

It says nothing regarding their reliability, and one could assume that
they are included as emergency messengers (yes, I\'m playing with
semantics, but it\'s a minor point :-).

Of course, one can play around with the DM/task difficulty to make the
j-torp more/less reliable.

One of the biggest dangers in any role playing game is that of upsetting game
balance. I\'m sure that the issue of long communication routes making the feudal
aspect of the imperium necessary has already been discussed, but it illustrates
a very important point. If you add new technology like this it really does
radically alter the nature of universe in which you play ( aha - play - we
mustn\'t forget WHY we are involved with Traveller - for myself, I like to PLAY
or Ref. the game ). Consider the rise of the automobile and highway over the
horse, and the radical changes that occurred because of that. It\'s not
neccessarily bad, but like building the atom bomb, you have to ask "should we ?"
rather than just "can we ?".

In fact, a better question than "How would it work ?" would be "How will it
affect my players, and the campaign they\'re involved in ?". And if the answer
doesn\'t equal more FUN, then avoid it.

I have yet to meet a referee who hasn\'t regretted adding new technology to
his/her game. Invariably  the new wonder toy turns into a monster, and you have
to pray you can find a way to dispose of it fast befre it wrecks your campaign
completely ( either by making your players too powerful [so they get bored] or
by making their goals either too easy, or meaningless in the greater scheme of
things ).

My advice : think twice. Great new ideas don\'t necessarily make for great
gameplay.

About three years ago, I did a similar analysis, covering the entire
Imperium.  I thought you\'d be interested in knowing what the results where.
>From my work (which used quite different assumptions and methods to reach
the same kind of conclusion), I found that the average Imperial Class A
starport has 29 Billion tons of starship traffic a year, which works
out to 280 Million tons of goods and materials moved per week (on the
assumption that about 50% of the average starship is cargo).

Our results are within an order of magnitude, and by tweaking the
assumptions we use, we can make our results match even more closely.
You might be interested in my breakdown of ships by size, and the
table which presents the frequency of starship flight operations.

Here\'s the entire analysis, reposted from a 1992-era TML posting:


Method:
I loaded the "new" rebellion-era statistics for all of the sectors for
which computer data files were available into a database and tabulated
the results.  The following analysis is based on worlds coded for Imperial
or Imperial factions, and should be accurate for the last years of the
Imperium or the beginning of the Rebellion.

The Gross Planetary Product and Taxation rules from Striker were used to
compute the GPP in Local Credits.  The Striker exchange table was used to
convert these to Imperial Standard (Port-A, TL-15) Credits, which were
then taxed at the suggested rates.  Rules from Trillion Credit Squadron
were used to compute the shipyard capacity of each Class A and B Starport.
The Trillion Credit Squadron construction rules were also used to estimate
the number and size of ships.

Summary:
The Third Imperium is a trade protectorate encompassing 10,497 systems
with a total population of about 16,731,817,153,000 sophonts.  The annual
Gross Imperial Product is 219,474,958,700,000,000 Credits.  This is the
total value of all of the goods and services produced on all the member
worlds of the Imperium in one year, adjusted to Imperial Standard Credits.
The Imperium imposes a tax burden of about 1% of the GIP, producing Imperial
revenues of about 2,194,749,587,000,000 Imperial Standard Credits per year.

The shipyards of the Imperium\'s Class A starports have an aggregate capacity
(all tech levels) of 5,098,672,838 displacement tons for vessel construction.
Its Class B ports have an additional capacity 4,367,049,593 displacement tons
for the repair and annual maintainance of starships.  The table below shows
the tech level breakdown for the Imperium\'s Class A and B starports.

Shipping Volume:
These figures can be used to estimate the approximate volume of shipping
within the Imperium.  A 10,000 displacement ton hull will be used as an
"average" to estimate construction times.  A hull occupies its tonnage
in the shipyard for its entire construction time of 160 weeks.  Ships
must also undergo annual maintainance; 4 weeks every year.  The yards of
the Imperium have an annual capacity of 265,130,980,000 ton-weeks of new
construction or maintainance, and 227,086,570,000 ton-weeks of maintainance
only.  Presumably, the Naval Bases, Naval Depots, Scout Bases, and Scout
Waystations contain additional ship construction and repair facilities
to build and maintain ships for the Imperial military services (this is
a logical extension of the policy that a world\'s survey data does not
include the personnel or technology of any military bases present).

Peacetime shipyards and ships presumably exist in an equilibrum, the
number of new ships constructed is the same as the number retired from
service; and all ships in service can recieve their annual maintainance.
In practice, there is always some spare shipyard capacity to provide for
regional differences, trade expansion, and so on.  Let us assume this
spare capacity at 10%.

The active lifetime of a ship must be at least as long, and probably longer
than, the period over which it is financed, 40 years.  There is good reason
(based on analysis of the Azhanti High Lightning class cruisers, the only
class of ships for which complete records are available) to believe that the
active life can be more than 100 years.  Let us assume that it is 80 years
(exactly twice the pay-off time).

Computation:
X = total tonnage in service
X/80 = annual tonnage taken out of service = annual new construction
160*(X/80) = 2*X = shipyard capacity in ton-weeks for new construction
2*X <= 0.90 * 265,130,980,000 (available new construction capacity)
4*X = shipyard capacity in ton-weeks required for annual maintainance
6*X = 0.90 * (265,130,980,000 + 227,086,570,000)
X = 73,832,634,000 displacement tons.

General Formula:
T = New Ship Construction Time in Weeks
L = Lifetime of Ship, in Years
U = Shipyard Utilization Factor
N = Ton-Weeks of Shipyard Capacity for New Construction
M = Ton-Weeks of Shipyard Capacity for Maintainance
X = Aggregate Tonnage of In-Service Shipping

Therefore:
X = (U * (N+M)) / (4 + T/L)

But:
X <= (U*N) / (T/L)

Interestingly enough, a 5,000 ton ship requires only 144 weeks to complete.
Therefore, 11 5,000 ton ships can be constructed for slightly less shipyard
capacity as 5 10,000 ton ships.  From a construction point of view, smaller
ships are more efficient than larger ones.  However, when carrying cargo or
passengers, larger ships tend to be more efficient. A balance must be
struck, and 10,000 tons was chosen rather arbitrarily.  The table below
presents a mix of ship sizes; the ratio column indicates how many ships of
a given size can be constructed using the same amount of shipyard ton-weeks.
For the purposes of estimating the number of ships, I will assume (again
rather arbitrarily) that a mixture of ships will be built so that every
10,000 tons of shipping represents an average of 1.6 ships; the Number
column shows how the shipping is distributed to get this total.

Trade Volume:
Presumably, Class A starports are also primary trade and commerce locations,
so that most traffic passes through them.  Class B ports would be
responsible for less of the trade, and so on down through Class E (slim)
and X (none).  The following table presents a possible breakdown.  The
ships column indicates the number of arrivals and departures (flight
operations) per week; less than half this number will be in port at any
one time.

It is interesting to note that there are 11,813,221 starships registered
in the Imperium; approximately 1,125 for every world.  The frequency of
flight operations at a Class A port is about as hectic as the busiest of
present-day airports.  For a commercial starship, between 40% and 60% of
the ship\'s volume will be cargo or passengers; therefore a Class A starport
handles about 8.25 million tons of cargo a week.  This is quite a large
volume of trade, but not enough to feed a planet of billions.

Many people have mentioned this.  I think this is the best solution

Now, I\'m not sure so please correct me if I\'m wrong.  The reason that
FFS doesn\'t impose a 100 ton limit was to make it fit in with some
original CT stuff.  I always assumed this to be j-torps and the like.
I clearly remember the 100 ton limit being in MT, but I don\'t remember
it being explicitly stated in CT.  Granted, CT is the only era that I
don\'t have everything for, so I may be missing something.

As for the standard Traveller background.  In TNE, there are under 100
ton j-capable starships.  They can all be found in the RSB, and the
most notable one would be the jboat.

Quite true.  The other big problem is that once you finish patching
the background so the technology only does exactly what it\'s suppose
to, it is clear that you are playing in a contrived setting.

Technologies need to be decided on (and thought out) before
the background is written.

This only partially mitigates the problem (esp. for military intell. and
espionage usages).  In fact it mitigates the problem to about the same
degree is makes them less useful to PC\'s, because there is a
fundamental link her.  If they are useful for PC\'s they are going
to be useful for other people (claims the contrary, PC\'s are
_that_ unique) and are going to have an effect.  If they are
to crippled, expensive, illegal, etc. then they aren\'t going
to be useful to the PC\'s.

Actually, I would suspect that vital warship components such as crypto gear,
computers, etc would be destroyed by the crew pretty much by the same means,
possibly with enhancements, that US Naval vessels take care of (or are
supposed to take care of) destruction nowadays.

Thermite or other destructive munitions would be used to convert the gear
into unuseable slag.

100 diameters.

OK, I\'ll grant you that. It\'s about 20-50 times cheaper than using an
unmanned ship. Still, an unmanned ship could be use if the admiral wanted
it bad enough. The torp makes that tactic a lot more feasible. But it
dosen\'t create a new option; just makes it cheaper (Btw. I\'ll have to
remember that dodge the next time I run a star empire). i was thinking
of such information as ships in system, which you don\'t need to get that
close to the planet to see. What kind of info are you thinking about?

You\'re getting your communications networks mixed up here. [Btw., note that
the J-torp that I\'m defending is the one that (I maintain) can be built with
the 100 T limit intact.] We\'ve got at least four:

1) The X-boat Network. That uses equipment that we already know is not the
   most effective available (this by political design). We\'ve been told
   that it averages 2.4 parsecs per week (which seems awfully slow to me,
   but that\'s what we\'ve been told.)
2) The courier networks like Imperiallines. These use commercial starports
   for refuelling and thus gets the message through in something less than
   6 parsecs per week (The starport stops add a day or so per jump, and you
   can\'t always find a proper starport precisely 6 parsecs away in the
   direction you want to go. Call it 5 parsecs per week. Such a setup is
   available at the cost of the couriers themselves. That\'s the one we\'re
   told the Imperial Bureaucracy use.
3) A courier net with refuelling dumps spotted at 6-parsec intervals. These
   would be faster than the Imperiallines-type setup since refuelling can
   be done faster (you cut out the trip from and to the planetary 100-diameter
   limit) and all the jumps can be J6 . Call it 6 parsecs a week. Such a
   setup costs the price of the ships plus the cost of setting up the fuel
   dumps PLUS the cost of _maintaining_ the fuel dumps if they are used
   regularily. Try working out the logistics of maintaining a fuel dump
   within jump-1 of a suitable base starport. It\'s not cheap. It gets
   worse the farther out the dump is from the base. Such a setup is more
   likely to be emergency use only.
4) The J-torp network. This requires a manned J-6 ship for each node. If
   fuel dumps are expensive to maintain, just wait till you have to have
   live crew on station. It would be cheaper than a type 2 courier system,
   but a lot less flexible. It would be a lot more expensive than a type 3
   system, especially an \'emergency only\' one, yet such a system is all
   any of the major players would need to explain the information-lag
   effects described for the Rebellion.

You can send messages one jump by J-torps for the cost of one ship at the
sending end and a cheap in-system shuttle at the recieving end, but if you
want to be able to return the messages or relay them, you need another
ship at the other end.

>Secondly (and more importantly), if you want to spread information widely
>and at the fastest possible speed (like the major factions needed to), you

Agreed. But a type 2 network of couriers cost less than a J-torp network and
only looses you a day per jump. For life and death messages you can maintain
a (usually unused) set of fuel dumps and get the same effect as a J-torp
network without having to pay nearly the cost of one.

>In travelling across the Imperium the continual loss for refueling and
>lifesupport replenishment (which you negelect),

The type 2 courier network will replenish their life-support at the same
starports where they refuel and I naturally assume that the fuel dumps will
have fuel for the crew as well as the ship.

I never said they didn\'t. I just questioned some of your assumptions about
the extent and cost of those networks.

>and it is this network that jump-torps would have rendered obsolete.

Now this is what I don\'t agree with you about. See above. A properly
designed courier network would be cheaper and just as efficient as a
J-torp system. And a lot easier to keep secret, too.

>It is that hughly expensive system of couriers that allowed some factions
>to get critical info first.

Remember that it is only a couple of bits of critical info that we have to
fit into any explanation: the various times this and that faction hears
about Strephon\'s death and their reactions. And a cheap, cut-rate type 3
courier setup is enough to explain those. And such a setup is within the
budget of a _lot_ of minor players. The Duchess of Mora dosen\'t need a
network that covers the length and breath of the Imperium. I don\'t think
someone like the Duchess would have such a setup, but if she did, Capital
is a very logical place to set up a node.

>While a system of torps would be expensive, the fact that would only be a
>fraction of the cost of couriers

Well, that\'s just where you make your mistake. It may be cheaper for
organisations like the Megacorps and the other Imperium-wide organisations,
*IF* we assume that they want to cover the whole Imperium. It\'s not if we
assume a few dozen key nodes (like all the sector capitals). It most
certainly is not true for the various spy organisations who only have to
get the info a long way, but dosen\'t have to bother with lateral movement.

>would make available more widely.  Not to everone, but to a lot more people

But the cut-rate courier system is available to a lot of outfits who
apparently didn\'t have it. The Sword Worlds, for example.

So does the ones I\'m defending. But the energy is created by the ship and
fed to the torp (since the torp dosen\'t have any fuel), so I think it is
acceptable to require that the ship engine be capable of generating J-6
fields of it\'s own.

Which is why the torp I proposed has one.

Worse how? Of course jump torpedoes allow you to do some things that you
can\'t do without them (Otherwise why bother?), but your argument is that
those capabilities will invalidate some of the Traveller background. Why
would the fact that one ship can send messages (at 21 MCr a crack) to all
worlds within 6 parsecs invalidate anything? I don\'t think they would be
used much at that price.

That depends on the scale involved. I did have limited ressources. I wanted
those couriers I bought to be available in a crisis. Until then I thought
they might as well do something.

A single high-population world could afford more than 100,000 jump-6 couriers
if they didn\'t spend their naval budget on anything else. Certainly someone
with the ressources of more than one world can afford a few hundred.

If you only have two or three courier ships you have trouble, yes. But a
Traveller task force would have scores of couriers.

Not unless you send them in close to the mainworld. A scout can collect
all the relevant material just as well from a few hundred thousand kms
away.

But my torps do have a jump drive and they do generate a 100 T jump field.

I didn\'t say that. I said that a J-torp _network_ required a lot of J-6
ships and thus cost on the same order as the couriers. Espescially when
you realize that to account for the Rebellion effects we have to account
for we only need a few hundred couriers all round.

What do you mean "before"? I\'ve never run a game where that was true, nor
do I recall any official adventures where that was an issue.

How often in your gaming have you faced that kind of dillema? (Just curious)

Well, that\'s a good reason for you to refrain from using jump torpedoes, but
I don\'t see that it has anything to do with wether jump torpedoes will
invalidate the Traveller background or not. Incidentally, there\'s plenty of
scope for making players leave behind jump torpedoes: They cost a hell of a
lot and they take up a non-trivial part of the average free trader\'s cargo
space. and if all else fails they can always break down.

David, I\'m glad you found the time to keep the thread going, because
I\'ve still got a bone to pick with you. (Forgive us Tom, but it looks
to me like there are still enough people interested in this argument to
keep it public for a little while longer.)

I agree with you that the issue that j-torps raise is one of background
rather than technique. Technical issues have always been trivial to
handle in any science fiction milieu. Retcons are more problematic.

Surely, you and I have the same motivation, the desire to protect the CT
background, while at the same time developing our own campaigns in a
manner consistant with it. And this common motivation underlies the
assumptions we make when faced with "new" situations. Like j-torps.

But I have gotten the impression in some of your past posts that you think
my hokey and arbitrary assumptions are somehow hokier and arbitrarier
than your own hokey and arbitrary assumptions. I just don\'t buy it. Here
are our assumptions, as far as I can see, laid out next to each other.

1)*I* assume that small jump drives are DIFFICULT to build.
2)*You* assume that small jump drives are IMPOSSIBLE to build.

Both of these assumptions do the job of preserving the CT background.
Neither assumption is in any way better thought out, technically
reasonable, or more consistant with background than the other.

True, your assumption has the relative advantage of being easier to
impliment than mine. You need not come up with design rules for these
small, hard-to-build jump-craft.

My assumption has the relative advantage of being fully compatible with
"Leviathan." I can understand that not everybody considers this so
compelling an advantage. That\'s fine.

My assumption has the relative disadvantage of intoducing a danger. The
danger that players might spot and exploit some loophole which I
inadvertantly may have placed in the jump-craft design rules. But since
I\'m not a total idiot, and have thought things through pretty well, this
danger is a small one.

I\'m prepared to discuss the relative merits of our differing assumptions
to some extent. (That is, to the extent that they affect more or less
objective aspects of the game, and not just personal taste.)

But hokiness? Arbitraryness? Incredulaty? Surely my assumption scores no
higher in these catagories than yours does.

Rob, your assumption is based upon an idea that makeing it difficult to do
prevents major impacts upon the published history; such a device, even as
an emergency lifeboat system, would have had major effects during the 4th
and fifth frontier wars, as losing sides could send out the message that
contained their attacker\'s force strengths, location, and such, as well as
known weaknesses. Such data becomes invaluable, especially if the fleet
sends 1 per ship to neighboring systems, where they can activate merchant
shipping and such ( even a few hours warning is a major change), as well as
step up monitoring for up to a week.

It all boils down to priorities on what one accepts as taking precedence: I
always took "Books" as having precedence over "Supplements", and
"Supplements" over "Adventures";I always took CT limits when MT had not
specifically limited them. With TNE, however, this approach doesn\'t work,
as TNE/FF&S are a generic system to which traveller has been
grafted/ported, not one deigned around the history of the traveller
universe.

        Okay, I have found an interesting (although somewhat unlikely

 to  please everyone) solution to the J-torp dilemma.

 Let\'s take a bit of a philosophical parenthesis here:

 Observations:
 If we were all unaware of the universe around us, the universe
 might as well not exist.

 There are 3 possibilities here;
 1 - The universe doesn\'t exist
 2 - The universe exists but is not observed
 3 - The universe exists and is observed

 The uncertainty principle states that you cannot observe a
 phenomenon without having an effect on it, however minute.  Now,
 let us assume for a moment that the \'stability\' of the universe
 depends on it being observed (i.e. wether the universe exists from
 one moment to the next depends on if a sentient creature can observe

 the causal characteristics of that universe from one moment to the
 next), because, once again, the universe doesn\'t exist unless
someone
 checks to see if it exists.

 Now how does that apply to Jump Torpedoes?

 Well, the simple (and useful) conclusion we can find is that
 Unmanned jumps are very risky!  Because one can imagine jump space
as
 being a separate universe and since there\'s no sentient creature
 aboard the unmanned vehicle, nobody is going to keep observing the
 pocket universe for its continued existence!  The jump pocket might
 collapse or might not.  The success of the whole jump might simply
 depend on wether someone is expecting mail on this torpedo or not.
It
 might actually get there without anyone thinking about it.

 Therefore networks of Jump torpedoes would be extremely impractical
and
 unlikely to succeed in getting mail through.  Most uses of jump
torps
 would simply end in failure, unless you have, say, people on staff
 who constantly worry about wether the jump torp actually gets there
or
 not.  And that would be unlikely because how can you keep your
thoughts
 on something all day long?  And also, Jump scientists haven\'t really
 figured out this theory. :)

 Anyway... I know it sounds pretty crazy but it\'s not that much more
 far-fetched that Psicoms! :)  It fixes most of the problems - no
 need to artificially make jump-torps drives unreliable or change the
 whole Traveller background.  There might be times when unmanned
 jumps have worked reliably, but this explanation doesn\'t preclude
 them from working fine; it just explains why all the
background-damaging
 applications would NOT work. :)

 What do you sophonts think?  Does jump drive play dice with the
Universe?

[I assume you meant to say "a _manned_ ship could be use if the admiral
wanted to"]
First of all, the loss of human life is more than just cheaper and better.
But even so, anytime you have an advance that eliminates the need for
a harder way of doing the same thing, you can still say that you can
do things the old way "if you really wanted to".  The question is,
why would you want to?  What you are doing is solving a fundamental
dilema in Traveller tatics.

That and more.  Just start thinking about all the kind of info a fleet
could use about a system it wants to enter.

No.  The design was j-4.  The equipment used to make a j-4 network _was_
the most effective available.  With torps you can have the same network,
at j-4 for the same reasons the old one was, and save the Imperium big
bucks.

Right.  And j-trops make such a network cheaper for a lot less than the
cost of the couriers (plus ships crew).

On the other hand a jump-torp makes this feasible.  You don\'t have to
maintain a full base (which, BTW, can simply be in the outer reaches
of a solar system, there is no need to make it so far you need to
jump to get to it) with jump-torps.  Since they are so much cheaper
and don\'t require a crew, you just need to fuel one and leave it sitting
someplace.

On the other hand, a jump-torp makes just this kind of network not
only feasible, but within the reach of a large number of the factions
involved (since, with torps, it becomes essentially the same as #3).

You just need a in-system shuttle at each end.

I don\'t see where you get this at all.  The cost of jump-6 ships is
huge.

If you are going to replenish life support you either need to land
at a port or maintain a full fledge base at every system.  In either
case either the cost or time involved was more than you were implying
in the appropriate message.

This is what the factions actually did.

You keep assuming the a fleet of jump-6 ships are "cut rate".  Why,
I don\'t know.

Actually ,they do have fuel.

OK, first of all, you are getting into something I just hate.  A
background that, instead of coming up with reasonable technologies
and having a background that fits, you have background where
one or more technologies "just happen to have" exactly the right
cost and performance so they have exactly the right effect.  It
just gets hard to ignore the fact that your character isn\'t a
realistic person in a realistic setting, but is just a set of
numbers in a contrived game.

Now it seems to me, (and I don\'t have my Traveller stuff handy
so I might be off) that you arbitrarily set the cost of jump-torps
at more than 1/2 the cost of a jump-6 ship.  Why?  you are making
them more expensive than a jump-torp with both a drive and
fuel.  And why even  bother?   Are your PC actually blowing 21 MCr
a crack?

Lastly, it doesn\'t matter what they cost, if the cost of sending
a jump-6 ship is even more.

>That depends on the scale involved. I did have limited ressources. I wanted

So you "just happened to have them".  Then what about situation where
you don\'t?

I\'m not sure where

Not if you could have a hundred system defense boats that can
turn the tide of a battle.  You are basically making the mistake
of looking at the resources of a large organization and not
appreciating that demands on resources will escalate just as
fast as the resources do.  Look at the US government, AT&T, any
large organization, none of them spend money on the premise that
they have some much it doesn\'t matter.  Because there is always
something else to do with it.  In a realistic setting nobody
have money "to burn."

You don\'t understand.  You are making abitrary assumptions.  Can
they be proven to be false, no (after all, I said they were a
_possibility_).  But you also can\'t show me a single thing
that says it possible for ship to send an object without
a jumpdrive through jumpspace.  In fact, passages on what
happens when a jump field generator fails during a voyage
can be interpreted as saying it\'s impossible.  If you want
reinterpret the rules to say that what you want works, that\'s
fine.  But that doesn\'t mean that you have shown objectively
that it will work.

>But my torps do have a jump drive and they do generate a 100 T jump field.

Then why do you need a ship with a jump drive to send one?

Gee, on every adventure where we have had to go in and collect information,

but could still collect more.

It doesn\'t these are two seperate problems with jump-torps.

Well, I will state that I believe you need to make some assumptions.
But this doesn\'t mean that once you make one assumption, making any
number of assumptions, regardless of what they are, is OK. Clearly
some assumptions are more of a problem than others.

>1)      *I* assume that small jump drives are DIFFICULT to build.
>2)      *You* assume that small jump drives are IMPOSSIBLE to build.

Well, in fact, if you look at traveller, even difficult jump-torps
have uses that one would have seen.  As I comment below, you have
the fundamental problem of changing technology after a background
is set.  Except for one slip-up (by someone who didn\'t write
the background), Traveller has been pretty consistent with
nothing below 100 tons.

Also, if you look at fields, critical properties, and economies of
scale, the idea that you need a certain size to be pratical is
consitent with our real life experience.  On the other hand,
you are proposing is a discontinuity in an otherwise steady
change of properties, our experience is that nature doesn\'t
work that way.

Finally, that a technology can\'t be done is less of reach than
to say it has to fit exatly a certain set of parameters.  This
is basically Occam Razor.  It doesn\'t say it can\'t be, it just
says it is unlikely (or, in games terms, implausible).

>Both of these assumptions do the job of preserving the CT background.
>Neither assumption is in any way better thought out, technically
>reasonable, or more consistant with background than the other.

I don\'t agree, but this is the sort of decision each GM needs to make.
However, it also needs to be remembered that, not allowing them
gets you away clean.  If you try and carefully introduce them
so they onely have one desired effect (and I don\'t think this
can be done) you will continually be in danger of an unexpected
consequence (and will either have to live with and inconsistency
or apply another complication to the background).

The fact is that the best time to make technologies available is
before write a background.  To do it afterward is fraught with
dangers.

I think easier is an understatement.  I would go with "not fraught
with diffuclties and unforseen dangers"  :-)

I do assume that difficult-to-build, ergo expensive, j-torps will not
require major changes or rationalizations to the existing CT background.
I think this is a safe assumption. Even without j-torps, a losing side
could send out a ship with intelligence on enemy forces, etc. Such data
will be invaluable with or without j-torps. I see no reason to assume
that these capabilities have ever been non-existant in the CT universe.
I know of no canon that precludes such intelligence gathering
capabilities.

Maybe you can point to a specific battle in the 4th or 5th Frontier Wars
and show me how canon states (or implies) that no "timely" information
about a battle be allowed to leave the system.

I can think of one counter-example. The fleet at Regina had advanced
warning of the invading Zhodani fleet jumping in from
<<A-nearby-nonimperial-world-whose-name-I-cant-remember>> a few hours
(or was it a whole day) before the Zhos kicked off the 5th Frontier War.

And here\'s another: While the battle was raging over Regina, news got
out to nearby worlds. Rhylanor received news of the battle before it
received word of a victor. Clearly, whoever sent that message out MIGHT
have been from the losing side (as far as he knew at the time.)

Please explain what you mean by "up to a week."

One of the major problems many people have with the Traveller background
(and that unfortunately often included GDW\'s people) is that it\'s difficult
to maintain a sense of proportion. Jump torpedoes would have no such effect
on the 4th and 5th Frontier wars, because your average Traveller task force
is big. I\'ll repeat that. It is big, Big, BIG! A Traveller interstellar
government could afford to build 100 T message torpedoes, if they were
useful, and battleships are big enough to carry them. This would be wasteful,
though, and what they would be more likely to have are scores of couriers.
Just how many is something one can discuss. But if such data really is
invaluable, then a Traveller task force who cannot get jump torpedoes
because they don\'t exist WILL have couriers instead.

So the impact jump torpedoes will have on this aspect of the Traveller
background is that a fleet can use 21 MCr torpedoes instead of 255 MCr
couriers. So if we say that the average task force has 20 couriers, jump
torpedoes will allow the task force to be about a quarter of a light
cruiser stronger. (Less, actually, since jump torpedoes must be regarded
as one-use only in this context, which means a task force would have to
carry more to do the same job. And they can\'t report back, either).

No, the place where jump torpedoes will have an impact is with the mid-
sized outfit. Not the small free trader, because even 6 MCr and 2 T is
an non-trivial part of a free trader\'s budget and cargo capacity, and not
the large outfits, because they can afford couriers and ships whose ship\'s
boats are themselves jump capable, but the subsector corporation and the
small one-planet government (the ones whose population are counted in
millions, not in billions). In short, such outfits as the corporation
in _Leviathan_.

To put tings a little in perspective: A planet of 10,000,000 inhabitants
in a dense area (50% chance of a star system per hex) will on the average
have 3 planets within 1 parsec, 6 more 2 parsecs away, 9 more 3 parsecs
away, 12 more 4 parsecs away, 15 more 5 parsecs away, and 18 more 6 parsecs
away. And it can have one courier for each of those 63 planets for about 3%
of its naval budget. And 63 jump-6 couriers costs less than one _light_
cruiser.

Aside from the fact you are treating all j-torps as being "lost"
(which I would say is poppycock) the fact is that you are treating
large organizations as having resources to waste.  This isn\'t how
it works.  Needs grow just as fast (sometimes faster) than resources.
In a war the Imperium is going to be short of equiment and (more
imporantly) manpower.  If you think the Imperium is going to have
ships and men just sitting around, or loose them sending them into
uncertain situations, when they don\'t have to just because they are
"big" then you are woefully mistaken.  They have a lot of other used
for these men and ships.

On another note, I am quite sick of the debate over j-torps that

the idea with the first few messages posted and decided it wasn\'t
something I felt my players needed or would add to the fun of the game,

The Atlas contained maps of all the sectors covered by the Imperium as well as
a few outside. Imagine a big rectangle drawn to fit the entire Imperium, and
every sector inside this rectangle is mapped (the original black map of
known space helps with this visualisation). UPP\'s were NOT included, but Hi
Pop worlds were named, and allegiance codes were given.

Stats for some Core subsectors can be found in a few DGP products such as
Digest #9 to 11 (pls correct me if I\'m wrong). Digest #9 was all about
Capital, the Emperor, nobility, the Palace, etc.

There should be data for all of Core available somewhere on the Net - can
anyone provide directions?

I\'ve seen several problems brought up on the lists concerning the rules
governing jump drives.

Notably:

1. There is a 100t minimum size limit in CT & MT that is violated in CT Adv
4 with Jump torps and is violated in TNE by a minimum size of JD being set
as 2 m^3.

2. In TNE the larger the ship gets the more of it\'s surface area is covered
by jump drive radiators.

I propose that jump drive size should be (at least in part) proportional to
the surface area of the ship.
As volume is cubic and SA is squared the smaller the ship is the more volume
is taken up by JD machinery (and fuel) until at some size it becomes
impossible to fit a JD.
There is no upper limit to the size of ship that may be fitted with a JD.
Note that different configurations would require different JD sizes.
Note that it is compatible with the "canon" of jump grids in MT.

Possible formula:

JD Vol = 1% x Jn + SA/s

where s is a scalar selected to give the minimum size ship we want or a
reasonable size JD at some "standard" size ship.
I think s should be about 20.
Though this does allow ships as low as 20 tons to jump, they are limited to
J-1 at this small size.

Your comments on this non-arbitary system are welcome.

Try looking in one of the subdirectories (called - I _think_ - =
"sectors/dgp-updated") of

ftp.engrg.uwo.ca/pub/traveller

There you\'ll find Digest Group Publications official (more or less =
anyway) sector data for lots of sectors, ca. 1120 (as far as I\'ve =
understood).

If you need data for a CT campaign, I think there was also a directory =
of "sectors" containing data for that \'era\'.

Definitely a CT subject, even if we are trying to apply MT (which this

But if getting messages out of a battle zone is so
background-shatteringly important, it can hardly be called a waste, can
it? What percentage of its budget does the US military "waste" on
intelligence? 3 percent? Less? As Hans says, the Naval Intelligence
budget is something one can discuss, but I\'m sure it won\'t be 0% of the
fleet budget!

That includes intelligence needs, too!

No organization likes uncertain situations, which is precisely
why they are often willing to spend a lot of money on intelligence.

Like putting them into big, blind fleets? I would love it if my
enemy had uses like that! Unfortunately, they usually spend some of
their resources learning more about me than I\'d like them to know.

Which is why I always spend some of my resources returning the favor.

Aside from the fact you are treating all j-torps as being "lost"
(which I would say is poppycock) the fact is that you are treating
large organizations as having resources to waste.  This isn\'t how
it works.  Needs grow just as fast (sometimes faster) than resources.
In a war the Imperium is going to be short of equiment and (more
imporantly) manpower.  If you think the Imperium is going to have
ships and men just sitting around, or loose them sending them into
uncertain situations, when they don\'t have to just because they are
"big" then you are woefully mistaken.  They have a lot of other used
for these men and ships.

But the point that Hans was making still stands;

J-torps (even though I don\'t use them myself) don\'t necessarily allow
a capability that isn\'t already present. Therefore there\'s no reason
to assume that their existence can\'t be accounted for within the ex-
isting canon.

Re Couriers vs J-Torps

In every case where couriers would have been sent off, the J-Torp AS
PUBLISHED would have replaced the courier for warning neighboring systems.

As to the "up to a week" of notice, a J-TORP AS PUBLISHED will leave
shortly after the battle has a definite flow (Some would have already been
sent) carrying current projections. This means that the couriers would have
been available to function as skirmish line units (anti-fighter, etc),
rather than being in jump. Also, the invading fleet needs time to refuel
before it can move on. In a war of Attrition (Which imperial warfare seems
to be), all combat effectives, of any size, inflicting any damage at all
have effect.

Also, J-Torps, no matter how expensive, if fitted as lifeboats, would allow
key officers to escape from a losing battle. And there were many such
battles from what I\'ve read. Outnumbered, out gunned, etc, early in the
war. Not a matter of winning, just a matter of making it cost as much as
possible.

In the Solomani rim war, the same is even more true.

Economies of scale and technical limitations sometimes have hard and
fast minima. (Nuclear bombs & reactors for instance) But more usually
these minima have to do with cost-benifit economics. Making the device
smaller is hard and expensive. (TV sets, computers, HiFi stereos, etc.)
These constraints won\'t always stop someone with money and a reason to
spend it.

My discontinuity is no more discontinuous than yours. And you just
mentioned critical properties and economies of scale which show that
nature does indeed sometimes work that way.

I assumed that task difficulties crossed over straight across (they seem to
be pretty much that way, especially in the operations end of things; combat

MegaTraveller tasks assumed to be [attribute/5] and [skill] based. (So Jo
has DM+1 from attribute) Maximum viable skill level is 8, as there is a
limit of DM+8 on normal tasks, and DM+18 on Psionic tasks. the level 7
table for jo is the maximum percentage chance allowed, because he\'s got +1
for attribute, and +7 for skill

Personally, I never really realized HOW MUCH a difference there was.

New Era prevents critical success at high levels of difficulty with NORMAL
RANGED SKILLS (levels 0-8). (It also makes 1 level of attribute equal to
one level of skill.)

MT makes critical success more likely, but makes harder tasks much less
likely. It also assumes that 5 levels of an attribute is equal to one level
of skill.

Not shown above, but important to note, is that MT allows critical failure
more than TNE. In fact, under TNE, Jo cannot crit fail any average task
which he has skill in! Thus, under TNE, the old misjump is non-existant for
anyone making a jump from 100 diameters with refined fuel. It cannot
happen. It even says so. A failure is simply a jump relativity error.

MT Skills are officially converted to TNE at either 1.5 times MT value or 2
times MT value, dependant upon which skill is involved (See _Survival
Margin_, GDW).

Note that there is no equivalent for Jack-Of-All-Trades (Jack-o-t or JOT)
in TNE, but survival margin allows it to make one attribute no longer take
the +1 level of difficulty on it\'s dependant skills for unskilled attempts.
So JOT-6 means you are skilled in every non-psionic skill there is to a
minimum level (Level 0). (It does not explicitly prohibit nor allow
applying a level of JOT to psionics, but that seems a little absurd
anyway.)

Hope this proves interesting (and maybe usefull) to some of you.

    'topic' => 'Anomalies with Material Tech in FF&S (and others)',
    'body' => 'Just looking at the FF&S Smallarms/Weapons design rules yesterday and I noted
something of an anomaly ... nothing like the USL problem (if only in terms of
absolute scale!), but still very significant ...

The problem is related to materials technology ... consider this, there is a
very specific developmental sequence for hull materials for spacecraft, with
a given mass becoming tougher and cheaper. Reasonable? I certainly see it
that way.

However, look at the Small Arms design sequence ... there is *nothing* like
this sort of sequence. The assumption is that all weapons from TL4 thru TL10+
are all made of materials that, for a given mass, always cost the same and
never become tougher. There is *nothing* in the design sequence that allows
for this. You can\'t even stretch existing things such as reductions in barrel
length (the barrels should still mass/cost less for a given toughness) etc.
The same sort of problem exists with Gauss Weapons, too.

This came up because I was thinking about Portable Airlocks - and someone\'s
statement that they are never improved beyond TL9 simply because they cannot
be! This seems quite ridiculous ... if hull materials are improved throughout
the TL system, then I can see no argument at all that a general improvement
in all materials do not occur.

So, consider this (based on the material in FF&S) -

TL      Relative Cost of Materials      Relative Mass for Standard Toughness

7       1                               1
8       0.76                            0.76
9*      0.7                             0.735
10      0.64                            0.71
11*     0.605                           0.66
12      0.57                            0.61
13*     0.57                            0.455
14      0.57                            0.3
15*     0.596                           0.27
16*     0.523                           0.24
17      0.5                             0.21

Taking TL7 as "1" and extrapolating those levels marked with an asterisk.
(Measured by taking a mass with the same Toughness - 4 - as TL7 Light
Composite)

Thus, a TL9 Portable Airlock rates as -

TL      Cost        Mass

7       1430        8.16
8       1086        6.2
9       1000        6
10      914         5.8
11      864         5.39
12      814         4.98
13      814         3.71
14      814         2.45
15      780         2.2
16      747         1.96
17      714         1.71

One could assume that similar cost and mass reductions would be possible for
smallarms and gauss weapons (or any other weapon, for that matter!) - though
the effect on existing designs would be enough in some cases to require some
redesign (for recoil purposes, mainly). Certainly there is no good reason that
such reductions in mass and cost *not* apply for, basically, *everything*
once it is introduced ... at least for future tech levels if not for previous
ones.

Just a thought.

    'body' => 'Ever wondered *why* you can\'t have a TL11 (say) version of a TL5 computer?
For example, Scout/Couriers have always had Model 1bis computers (TL6) - and
are normally constructed at TL11 (minimum for Jump2) ... but do they *really*
expect us to believe that a TL11 version of a Model 1bis is going to be
identical in mass, power requirements etc. to a TL5 one? Obviously they do!

But why *should* this be the case? No reason at all. Even now, you can buy
computers that come with varying capacities that, at our present TL, represent
everything from current "state of the art" to something that approximates the
computing power of one a TL or two (in Traveller terms) less in a laptop,
notebook, or even palmtop package at (in relative pricing, mass, and power
requirement terms) *much* less than they were produced at originally. It is
eminently reasonable to assume that this will continue to be the case in the
future.

Thus, using MTrav or CTrav (you can\'t really do it with TNE because the stats
that are required to make the calculations possible no longer exist in it), you
can simply divide the base model\'s Max CP input by the CP input of the lower
TL model required (or the CP multiplier, take your pick) and then divide the
mass, power required, cost etc by that factor.

Thus, a TL6 Model 1 bis masses 5 tons, has a volume of 20 displacement tons,
requires 0.03 MW power and costs 9 MCr (as per MTrav, Referee\'s Manual,
pg. #81). A TL15 Model 9bis masses 8.8 tons, has a volume of 35 displacement
tons, requires 0.02 MW power and costs 43 MCr.

The Model 9bis has CP Input of 500 million and CP Multiplier of 120; the Model
1bis has a CP Input of 7500 and a CP Multiplier of 15. If you use the CP Input
as the determinant, then the reduction factor for a TL15 Model 1bis
*equivalent* is 0.000015 ... giving it a mass of 0.075 kg. volume of 0.3 l,
power requirements of 0.0000004 Mw and costs 135 Credits! If you use the CP
Multiplier you get a reduction factor of 0.125 ... giving the TL15 model 1bis
a mass of 250 kg, a volume of 2.5 tons, power requirement of 0.00375 Mw, and
will cost 1.125 MCr.

Based on the fact that a TL11 Hand Computer (MTrav, Imperial Encyclopaedia,
pg. #56) which is stated as having the equivalent of a Model 1 (TL5) in
computing power costs 1000 Cr, masses 0.5 kg and has a volume of 0.2 liters
(even allowing for the fact that it may not have the same beefed up avionic
rating as aerospace computers and may have a slower CPU) I personally suggest
that the 135 Cr TL 15 Model 1bis massing 75g and being powered by batteries
is the way to go!

Of course, you can always declare the Hand Computer "non-canon" ... which
seems to be a standard excuse for some people. Its in the rules, it makes
sense on what we know and can reasonably project (and if HePlaR is more
"reasonable" than Thruster Plates, and so must be adopted, surely "realistic"
computers should be as well?

Excuses for ignoring logic are eagerly awaited!

First of all, I would say that being able to send something without
risking loosing people (or even tying any up) _is_ a capability
that isn\'t already present.

Second, just because it isn\'t a new capablity doesn\'t mean it
doesn\'t have big impact.  What if one made the cost of j-6 ships
as cheap as j-1 ships?  Are you saying this would have no impact.

a) There should be ships that are under 100 tons.
b) The cost of small ships (say 25-200) tons should reflect this

We don\'t see either.

>My discontinuity is no more discontinuous than yours.

It does when you look at how jump drive properties change with size.
If you want to completely rewrite the properties of jump drives so
that your cost of a jump-torp is consistent with costs of small
ships you could.  But that would have it\'s own consequences.

[And just for the record, I don\'t agree that even if you don\'t find
the idea that jump-torps should anomolously expensive to be strained
that it solves your problems.  Size, the cost difference that still
exists, and not needing to risk/tie up men will have an effect on
the background.]

On a similar note, a ship using thruster plates and accelerating at 4 g

I think I\'d stick with about 100 g-turns of thrust.  This still allows

dubbed it the \'Rancke jump torpedo\' to distinguish it from the \'Leviathan

jump capacitors similar to the ones put into a jump drive needed to
generate the jump field desired, and a recording unit. To use, the ship
expands the framework, generate a jump solution with it\'s computer,
generate the energy needed in its own jump drive and feed it to the
torpedo capacitors.

You assume wrong. If sending a jump torpedo to the 100 diameter limit to
collect info and relaying it is a feasible tactic then sending an unmanned
ship to do the same is equally feasible, just more expensive. If the
admiral wants it badly enough he can do it even without j-torps. Thus
J-torps does not _add_ a new option.

I didn\'t say J-torps wouldn\'t add new options. I said these new options
wouldn\'t make the huge difference you claim. If the knowledge to be derived
from such tactics is big enough to change the result of a lot of battles then
a scoutship  is a cheap price to pay. If a scoutship is too expensive to
loose on such a venture where a torpedo is not, then the benefit to be
derived from the tactic is not enough to invalidate the Traveller background.

No, we\'re talking about information available from an exposed position (like
the defenders 100 diameter limit) AND not available from a safer place in the
system. What would that be?

Was jump 4 the best available when the system was set up? Perhaps it was. I
don\'t have a timeline with me. What I\'m sure of is that the decision not to
upgrade the system was a political one. As for the rest, see my economic
analysis below.

Not if each node demands a jump-6 ship to maintain.

There is every need if you want a covert network. Ships in normal space can
be traced much more easily than ships jumping. But I didn\'t say a full base.
Just a ship.

What in the galaxy for? Leave food and oxygen at the fuel dumps and any ship

for morale, but it\'s not essential to survival.

I\'d like some quotes about that, actually. It\'s not an unreasonable thing for

No, I defined one type of courier "net" as cut-rate: The one where the
owner only want to maintain an "emergency only" courier on Capital. That
would only need a few couriers to maintain (depending on the distance the
message has to travel) yet is enough to explain the movements we are told
about in "Rebellion".

Funny, that\'s just the kind of thing I enjoy. Trying to reconcile two
seemingly contradictory facts. In this case some facts of the Traveller
background is defined for us. So is some of the physical laws (ie. game
rules). They seem to contradict each other. Yet we "know" both are true.
How to reconcile them? Obviously by either introducing some new historical
facts or introduce some new physical law that just exactly explains it. In
either case something apparently contradictory is shown to be possible,
which enhances plausibility. Not as much as a having a perfectly meshed
set of rules and a background built from it from the start, but we\'re not
going to have that with Traveller anyway, by virtue of the way the game
evolved.

>Now it seems to me, (and I don\'t have my Traveller stuff handy so I might

>the cost of a jump-6 ship.

Not quite. There\'s a jump-6 courier in _Fighting Ships_ that costs MCr 255.
I won\'t mind betting that I could make a cheaper one, but I like using
canonical background material. So MCr 255 it is. I can\'t calculate the
exact price of a \'Rancke jump torpedo\', because I don\'t know how much you
save by deducting the special fusion reactor part of a jump drive. Thus
I arbitrarily decided that such a torpedo would displace and cost the
same as a jump drive of the equivalent jump number. That\'s not an
unreasonable guesstimate, is it? We can also put it at the price of a full
jump drive PLUS the framework, but that would make it _more_ expensive and
bulky (thus less advantageous).

>Why?  you are making them more expensive than
>a jump-torp with both a drive and fuel.

What\'s the cost of a jump-torp with both drive and fuel? I\'ve skimmed through
_Leviathan_ just now and I couldn\'t find any mention of size, price, or
performance stats for their J-torps.

>And why even  bother?   Are your PC actually blowing 21 MCr a crack?

Not their own money ;) No, I\'m just defending a concept. My players have never
used a RJT. But a jump-2 torpedo would \'only\' cost 9 MCr and is more likely
to be the kind borne by a ship that uses such contraptions. Besides, they
would be marked \'Property of [the company that financed the expedition]\' and
you might get it back for no more than the salvage fee. (10%?)

>So you "just happened to have them".  Then what about situation where
>you don\'t?

But a Traveller fleet will have them. They\'re useful and they don\'t cost much.

>>Certainly someone

>
>Not if you could have a hundred system defense boats that can turn the tide
>of a battle.

Ah, but that\'s just my point. You CAN\'T have a hundred system defense boats
_that can turn the tide of a battle_. The cost of those couriers are less
than ONE _light_ cruiser. Call it system defense boats equivalent to two
light cruisers if you want to be generous. On the scale Traveller fleets are
usually built that is of absolutely no account.

>In a realistic setting nobody have money "to burn."

True enough. But they\'ll still use a fair amount on intelligence. And a tiny
amount (relatively) is enough to buy the couriers.

>If the scout can detect enemy ships, they can detect him.

Actually, I could give you an argument about that, given the rules about
signature according to size, but there\'s no need. You see, there\'s quite a
difference between the top speed of a ship and the top speed of a photon.
A scout can jump in somewhere hours or days away from the guns of any
defenders and still be able to see what they need and get out again
while the getting is good.

>You don\'t understand.  You are making abitrary assumptions.

I make the assumption that the Traveller rules are consistent. I don\'t think
that\'s so terribly arbitrary (Not borne out by the facts, maybe, but not
arbitrary ;-).

>But you also can\'t show me a single thing that says it possible for ship to
>send an object without a jumpdrive through jumpspace.

Except the _Starship Operator\'s Manual_. A jump drive consist of three things:
A jump grid, capacitors and a special fusion reactor. The fusion reactor burns
the fuel real fast and store it in the capacitors. The capacitors are capable
of holding that energy for a short while before it has to be discharged. When
they discharge the grid forms the jump field. Logically it should make no
difference wether the capacitors was charged by an onboard fusion reactor or
one exterior to the field. Once the energy is in the capacitors, the fusion
reactor\'s part of the job is done.

>In fact, passages on what happens when a jump field generator fails during
>a voyage can be interpreted as saying it\'s impossible.

Let\'s have a quote or two.

>>But my torps do have a jump drive and they do generate a 100 T jump field.
>
>Then why do you need a ship with a jump drive to send one?

Because the energy is generated by the ship (that\'s why you don\'t need fuel
space on the torpedo).

I guess it\'s time for me to put my calculations where my mouth is. Let\'s see
just how a RJT network stacks up against some other types.

Basic assumptions: The cost of maintaining a ship is 10% of its cost yearly
(this is what TCS uses). This includes crew training, salaries, and pensions
as well as servicing, yearly refits, and replacement of worn out equipment.

The cost of a X-boat link is 1 jump tender and 1 X-boat (actually, it\'s
half of two tenders and two ships, since a tender will be part of two links).
It\'s more expensive for an end link (one that is the last link in a chain,
but cheaper for a fork link (one where a tender is part of three links), but
I will postulate that they cancel out.

The cost of a courier link designed to allow one message each way each week
is two courier ships.

The cost of a RJT link is one jump ship and one torpedo.

The cost of a spy network is increased by the need to keep the tender
supplied with fuel from elsewhere.

All costs are in MCr.

X-boat link:Courier-6 link:X-torp link:Spy torp link:

X Boat: 70.652 couriers:J4 torp: 15J6 torp: 21
Tender: 157.2255.55 @J4 ship: 200J6 ship: 255
Supply ship: 50

MCr 22.785/year55.11/year21.5/year32.6/year

Finally, let\'s look at what I call the \'cut-rate\' courier network. That\'s
the one where you only maintain a single courier in readiness at Capital,
with order not to rush home unless something really momentous occur. Say
what someone like the Duchess of Mora might have in order to maintain a
lobbyist at Capital.

Distance from Mora to Capital is (roughly) 145 parsecs. Allowing for
ackward positions of starports suitable for refuelling it might take
29 jumps to get from one to the other. Assume you want the ship to stay
12 weeks and then return. You\'d need 6 couriers to maintain a constant
presence on Capital. That will cost MCr 155.33/year to maintain, which
is affordable considering that Mora\'s naval budget is MCr 3,500,000/year
(after Imperial taxes).

OK. So the X-torp link is MCr 1.285 cheaper than a X-boat link, yet the
Imperium chose to implement a X-boat network. Why? One possibility is
that jump torps was not invented yet when the network was set up. Another
is that the X-boat manufacturers rolled bigger logs than the jump torp
manufacturers. Both are historical explanations that are more than
sufficient. Or possibly there is a hidden cost with the torps. If you
simply assume a 1/36th chance of a malfunction in jump torps you increase
the cost of a X-torp link by 21.66 MCr/year, nearly DOUBLE the cost of a
X-boat network, while maintaining the usefulness of jump torps for
emergency messages (35 chances in 36 are good odds for a single use;
it\'s when you use them weekly the odds become ruinous). The advantage
of the last possibility is that it increases the cost of a spy-network
similarily.

The ones in _Leviathan_, true. But that\'s about all we\'re told about them.
They consist of a jump drive, fuel, and a recording unit. There\'s not even
a computer to generate a jump solution. Nor are we told anything about
their size, price, or performance. To reconcile this with the rest of the
canonical material is easy. I can think of several explanations:

Small jump drives are based on the inferior jump drive used by [damn... I
forget... was it the Hivers?]. Everything we\'re told about jump drives
concerns the regular jump drive, so we can establish any sort of rules we
like for the other kind (Except that they burn out after 10-12 uses (Which
will explain why they are not used for the X-boat network too)). Including
being able to generate a smaller than 100 T jump field.

Or it could be a third type of drive. If there are two different ways to do
something, why not a third? Again, the proper parameters will prevent them
from marginalising the X-boat networks.

Or we could limit the application to jump-1 or jump-2. Perhaps its a new
invention, one not fully developed. That will explain why it wasn\'t used
for the X-boat network: It wasn\'t invented back then.

No, I\'m saying that any admiral has to assume (worst case scenario) that he

that _for this purpose_ one had to assume they were one-shot. The default
assumption for manne couriers is that they\'ll propably turn up again.

No, I\'m treating tham as having vast ressources. After all, if that sort of
information is so amazingly valuable, then it can hardly be called waste to
provide the means to disseminate it. The question then becomes: Can we
afford it? And in the case of Traveller-type interstellar governments the
answer is: yes.

>In a war the Imperium is going to be short of equiment and (more imporantly)

A fleet courier costs MCr 255.55 has a crew of 5 men. The Imperium thinks
in terms of fighting ships that cost from 70 times more and has nearly
50 times larger crew (and that\'s for a light cruiser; a _Tigress_ costs
more than 1400 times as much and has a crew more than 800 times larger.

They wouldn\'t be sitting around and they wouldn\'t be any appreciable loss
due to sending them into uncertain situations.

>They have a lot of other used for these men and ships.

You mean, such information isn\'t all that important anyway?

A Trillion Credit Squadron could have (for example) 32 50,000 T Armoured
Cruisers and 30 5,000 T Fleet Escorts and still have money enough for 24
Fleet Couriers. Dropping the couriers will only allow two more Fleet
Escorts. If information really is that important (And I agree that it is)
then the couriers will be bought.

And Mora alone pays for 15 Trillion Credit Squadrons (That\'s with the 30%
of its taxes that goes to the Imperial fleets; the money Mora retains for
system defense will finance 35 TCSs).

I am not sure about 100 per cent CT fans, I am a CT/MT fan and in the
last weeks I have avoided reading any message that had to do with either
TNE comparisons or jump torps (personally I think they are inconsistent with
everything  else ergo they are not in my universe. I am sure I
cannot/don\'t want to  convince others to follow my view).

TNE is another game (and has his own mailing list). I have chosen not to buy
any TNE expansion and regret having bought the basic manual. My attitude
versus TNE has been that of sitting on the river banks waiting...It seems
I might have been lucky.

In any case I find the discussion on intelligence etc interesting and
I do not think it has really anything to do with the existence of jump
torps. AWACS planes or soviet spy ships are/were not especially small. It is
very likely that  building an efficient and cost effective starship
analogue will require more than 100 tons in any case.

The Imperial Navy  AWACS ship that I posted some time ago (see
http://astro.sns.it/~mstiavel/Traveller/equip/AWACS.txt) was indeed 800
tons. I have not played enough MT battles to be sure that that design is
really cost effective and I suspect that even minor changes in the way
sensor tasks are performed would have radical effects on the design of
similar starships.

The experiments with the Iridium Brigade that were discussed on xboat
this summer confirmed the role of intelligence also on the battlefield.

The importance of intelligence in its various forms has been recognized
since Sun Tzu\'s time and seems to me to be proportional to : 1- the
ability of your opponent to move rapidly and 2- the degree of lethality
of firepower (if you are throwing snow balls at each other you probably
do not need intelligence).

If one had available Boccob\'s Infinitely Ranged Ray of Instantaneous Utter
Destruction (sorry I have been playing some other game lately..) he would
probably spend most of its remaining money in intelligence: an enemy
seen is a dead enemy.

I suspect that the importance of the various forms of intelligence will
only increase in the future as weapons become more deadly.

The J-torp as published has no defined price, volume, performance, or
limitations. Until we know those factors we can\'t tell how useful they
would be relatively to their price. We do know that couriers have one
advantage over them: Couriers will return to the fleet on their own
accord.

The Fleet Courier carries two triple laser turrets and two triple missile
turrets and a model 6 computer. Anyone who\'ll put them in a skirmish line
against properly designed fighters is either a fool or has never played a
TCS campaign ;-)

But a Fleet Courier isn\'t _combat_ effective (No ship that dosen\'t have
the best available computer can be said to be combat effective).It isn\'t
designed to be. It\'s designed to jump 6 parsecs.

1: One of the retcon suggestions to limit jump torpedoes was that living
   tissue can\'t survive inside a jump field smaller than 100 T.
2: Key officers can escape on 100 T lifeboats just as well.

That\'s how I do it!  Ships in my games are usually shaped like
slabs (bricks) or fat ovoids (rugby football), with large
extendible fins or wings.  The fins are for cooling not flight.
Ships \'float\' down through an atmosphere at 3-400kph.  That\'s not
to say they can\'t drop or lift at much greater speeds, they
usually can, but the effects on the planet aren\'t pretty.  Just
imagine the sonic boom a 20,000 ton ship would make!  <g> I
haven\'t set it up yet, but I envision a scene where a massive
ship is floating down toward the surface with jet fighters
zipping around it taking pot shots.

You bet!  That\'s one of the major skills of a space pilot..being
able to launch and land the ship through an atmosphere.  Winds,
magnetic fields, and especially the interactions among the
atmosphere, gravity, and CG make for a good deal of difficulty.
About twice as much as a Zeppelin helmsman would have had, I\'d
guess.

As for the computer, I\'ve got that handled.  <g> In my ficton, the
CG effect plays absolute havoc on microelectronics.  In my game
computers are big, slow and dumb; built with mechanical switches,
rheostats and big heavily shielded and high voltage vacuum tubes.

Ever wondered *why* you can\'t have a TL11 (say) version of a TL5 computer?
For example, Scout/Couriers have always had Model 1bis computers (TL6) - and
are normally constructed at TL11 (minimum for Jump2) ... but do they *really*
expect us to believe that a TL11 version of a Model 1bis is going to be
identical in mass, power requirements etc. to a TL5 one?

I always figured that the lowest tech devices were used to allow easy
replacement, in case of a breakdown  when "wandering" in the hinterlands.
Better to leave the space & power for the primitive version, just in case.
Although there\'s no reason why a higher-tech version can\'t be used most of
the time.

    'body' => 'Something else I\'ve been considering (in relation to the ridiculously over-
priced vehicles in all versions of Traveller, amongst other things) - what
are wages and working hours like on a High Tech world (TL14/15, but even at
TLs from 10-12+)?

Look at what has happened in the last hundred years (what, two or three TLs?) -
we have gone from (industry/mining) a 70+ hour week to a 50 hour week, a 48
hour week and, at present (in Oz) a 35-40 hour week. Consider why this has
happened/been possible - mechanisation has made individual workers vastly more
productive and it has been possible to increase standards of living through
application of this in private lives as well as reduce working hours. There
is every reason to believe that this sort of trend will continue - certainly,
Traveller assumes that computers become more "effective" (at least at
controlling Starships) and that they are an integral part of life in the 57th
century ... otherwise how could even *they* believe that Virus would work
(ignoring the other problems with Virus).

So, how long is a work week/day in the 57th century? Considering the current
rate of decrease, where it has halved over around 3-4 TLs, we can reasonably
assume that it would halve, and halve again, from TL8 to TL15 ... if not more!
So, we have a 9 hour work week ... perhaps three 3 hour days and a 4 day
weekend? Probably much less than this given the improvement in communications
that cut out travelling time for workers who can telecommute from home.

This raises interesting problems for Traveller Starships as they have been
described to date ... or for their crews, at least. They are vastly overworked
and vastly underpaid! Most of the smaller vessels - Scout/Couriers, Far/Fat
Traders and the like - have crews that could not man them at TL15 work hours!
Of course, they are produced at lower than TL15, so, perhaps, that explains
it ... but, of course, TNE has changed all that by increasing their base TL
(the Scout/Courier now has TL/15 rather than TL/6 computers, for example).

Even if they are not overworked, their pay must be below the poverty line.
Consider: the best savings result possible with TNE for a character from a
High Stellar TL world is 5000 Cr per 4 year term ... 1250 Cr per term. Now,
assuming that they are able to save 20% of their salary (a pretty reasonable
figure), this seems to indicate that they have a salary of 6250 Cr per year.
Now, given that 1 Cr seems to be worth around 1-2 US$, and given the costs of
equipment listed in Traveller\'s various versions, this means they *are* living
beneath the poverty line! It has some interesting implications for either the
cost of gear *or* the amount of savings a character should be allowed to
accumulate in character creation ... or both!

Also, if you think about what I am suggesting, it makes the almost requirement
that Hi-Tech Hi-Pop worlds are the guts of the Imperium (as per the Rebellion
in MTrav) somewhat dubious. There is considerable evidence to suggest that
increased standards of living (regardless of religious factors here) lead to
smaller family sizes ... and this seems no less likely to apply to the future.
Then, on top of this, allowing for the complete roboticisation and
mechanisation of factories in the future, how do you envisage them ... with
hundreds of workers bent over manually operated machine tools? Or one or two
supervising engineers who make sure that the automated, self-repairing and
maintaining production lines don\'t manage to stuff up in a way that no-one
had anticipated ... and even *they* are probably just supervising computers
who do most of the actual error checking! So what are the rest of the people
doing? They must be in service industries ... and even there automation and
computerisation would reduce the numbers required, so working hours would
be reduced *and* the number of workers would be small.

So, there seems to be no direct connection between the size of the population
and the high-tech rating of a world. Given that it seems likely that such
worlds would have industries that would be quickly reconfigurable (its all
computer controlled and probably with multi-purpose factories rather than
specialised ones anyway) for any demands that might be put on them ... and
they probably have a *very* considerable export trade to worlds of lower tech
levels (all effectively automated). This should mean that prices of goods on
such worlds should be low and/or wages should be high - which isn\'t the case!

What would all these people do outside of their 9 working hours per week? Well,
a whole rethink of leisure would obviously have been important in such
societies, and leisure activities would be very important ... sports, hobbies,
artistic and craft pursuits etc. would be (presumably) *very* big! Also, we
can assume that, for some people, education and study would be important ...
and would boost their technology further as there seems to be evidence that
suggests that the number of people involved in such pursuits as a percentage
of the overall population is an important influence on the speed of such
change.

All in all, 57th Century cities provide much food for thought!

First of all, I would say that being able to send something without
risking loosing people (or even tying any up) _is_ a capability
that isn\'t already present.

Second, just because it isn\'t a new capablity doesn\'t mean it
doesn\'t have big impact.  What if one made the cost of j-6 ships
as cheap as j-1 ships?  Are you saying this would have no impact.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What I\'m saying is that it "doesn\'t *necessarily*" have a significant
impact.
This allows existing canon to stand while also allowing the existence
of J-torps. You can argue that they *should* have had an impact & I\'ll
simply reply that Imperial history shows that, as anomalous as it would
seem, in fact they didn\'t make that much difference, for whatever reasons.

Of course you\'be just revolutionized the whole concept of space travel in
Traveller. It is typical of attempts introduce a technology which will only
have a selected effect is that your attempts to patch it to work just one
way have their own side effects.  What you have proposed eliminates the
need for ships to carry their own jump fuel.  Instead you just have a
reactor at 100 diams in each system that launches ships into jump space.
Take any ship design and start cutting out the space you need for jump fuel
and you can see what a big difference this will make.  In fact, travel will
start working a lot more like Bablylon 5 (with installations that launch
smaller and civilian traffic but with military ships going their own way if
they need to).

A) It also more risky.  If you have enemies sitting there your men are dead.
B) There is nothing "just" about more expensive.  We are talking about the
  resources you need to fight a war.  Saving them can make all the difference.
C) It also ties up manpower, also a limited comodity.

You seem to feel that the loss of a few jump torps compares to the loss
of jump 6 ships and their crews.  I find this absurd, but none of
this isn\'t stuff we haven\'t covered before so we will have to let
each reader make up their own mind.

Either they do or they don\'t.  As it turns out they do.  They let

This is more than simplistic.  You seem to be claiming that if tatics
are important then ships must be cheap or that if ships are cheap then
tactics must be unimportant.  Why you think this must be is unclear.
The fact is that tatical information and ships are _both_ important.
This produces one of the fundamental delima\'s of traveller warfare
(one that separates tatical brilliance from mere competance), how
much of the second do you risk to get the first (and reduce the risk
to your fleet as a whole)?  Your approach just whips away this dilema
with a new gizmo, and not only changes the background, but also
(IMO) diminishes it.

Aside from the open quesiton (among others) of how you can get a torp
to safely jump when it\'s being fed energy from another ship  (a ship
can\'t even be close to the torp, to just assume that an energy beam
right to it won\'t cause a misjump is questionable).  The fact is
that even then, you save money on each node that needs to send a
message to more than one destination (which is true of any message
propigating out from a central point).  If you were going to send
a message to 4 system you would need 4 jump-6 ships.  Now you just
need one.

First of all, that\'s not true, jumping produces a transient.  Second of
all, if you are going to refuel a ship and replenish life support, you
are going to need a base.  Or you need to keep a jump-6 ship sitting
permanently staffed and ready to go.  Either way we are talking expensive.

Read the Rebellion Source books.  The factions with jump-6 couriers got
info to their people generally through the Imperium, not at a few
selected locations.

I guess to each their own.  I prefer a background where I\'m not always
running into things there are clearly there just to make something
work the way it wouldn\'t have in the first place.  Real things don\'t
work that way.

>Not quite. There\'s a jump-6 courier in _Fighting Ships_ that costs MCr 255.

You are right, your jump-6 torps are a lot cheaper than a ship.  So that
leave the point.  They save a lot of money.  That makes a different.
As just one, Anyone who needs to send multiple messages back from
an expition can now just send one ship rather than having to send
mulitple ships  so that some can be sent back with news.

>>So you "just happened to have them".  Then what about situation where
>>you don\'t?
>
>But a Traveller fleet will have them. They\'re useful and they don\'t cost much.

Again, a fundamental point.  Useful technologies (esp. cheap ones) get
widely used and have big impacts.  That\'s how technology works.  Look
at history.

>Ah, but that\'s just my point. You CAN\'T have a hundred system defense boats

So now, instead of having to weight each message to see if it\'s worth
the loss of a ship you can just pop off anther torp.

A default assumption that is questionable.  You are in a middle of
a war with an enemy that is keen on detroying your ships and you
assume that if something has happened to the base you are sending
a message back to, your couriers are going to be safe?  And that,
if nothing is wrong with the base, they will be unable to retrieve
the torps?  I think your assumption more than a little biased.

One of the points that people keep missing is that, the inablity to
easily communicate IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE
TRAVELLER UNIVERSE (it\'s in caps because I feel like I need to
stand on the nearest builing and shout it).  The fact is that
no organization has all the comunications it wants.  Not even
the Imperium (this is why it is forced to use a feudal type
of goverment rather than more direct control).  By making
communications easier you are allow more people to get more
info (both civilian and military) and going to allow more
resources to be freed up for other things.

Again, vast resources and VAST NEEDS FOR RESOURCES.  Yes info
is important and they spend resources to get it.  It is also true
that to make that info easier and free up resourses for other
purposes it a big deal.

>A fleet courier costs MCr 255.55 has a crew of 5 men. The Imperium thinks

Right, and jump torps are even cheaper.  Thus, for each 50-70
messages a fleet sends it can have a _whole new ship of the line_.
I call that a big difference.

If you have ships designed just to be couriers, they have to be
their waiting if you want them when you need to send a message
(like you can with a torp).  And not having to send men into
uncertain situations is one of the big changes jump-torps bring.

>You mean, such information isn\'t all that important anyway?

This is the last time I\'ll say this.  _Both_ ships and info are
important.  Read my earlier message.

As for the Computing Power, I developed a system of formulae for doing
non-standard computers for traveller craft under FF&S; I don\'t have them
handy, but the basic conversion point for FF&S is the Crew Multiplier;
whatever you multiply the size by, you divide the cp multiplier by. costs
and weights and power draws relative to size. Has a few more twitches than
that, but still pretty simple. Allows for massively automated computer
power.

You see phil, my problem has been the other direction from you -- I want
MORE power available so that I can supplant crewmen!

However, I agree on your basic premise; Each TL should have a computer
table, with all the models available at that TL.

Oh, yes, please note that the hand comp is no longer comparable to a ship\'s
comp under TNE.

As for materials tech:
I can see the Portable AL improving, I can see a lot of stuff doing it.
It\'s simple enough for most stuff just to use the materials table and fudge
it. Firearms however are completely BROKEN. The simplest fix? Use 3g3, as
it ain\'t broke, and has tl conversions for MT, and damage conversions for
T2K (which is same as TNE).

For example, can zucchai crystals be used as recording

Wil, I liked your comparison of the task systems (despite the objections
of some who would have this list ethnically cleansed of TNE
comparisons).  I\'ve never liked the high percentages that MT gives for
extreme success and extreme failure.  Here, for your perusal and critique
(and the perusal and critique of others, of course (as if I needed to
ask :-)), is the task system that I use.  It\'s a heavily modified
CT/MT system.

Targets are numbers instead of levels (I\'ve always considered the
distinction to be merely semantic, anyway).

Two dice are rolled with modifiers being [skill] and [ability/3].  I like
ability divided by three because this creates modifiers rangeing from 1
to 5, a very similar scale to skill levels.  Also, I like the way it
divides up the ability levels, giving 6-8 the same "average jo" modifier,
and making an ability of 15 really kick-ass.

Ab.  DM
0-2  +0
3-5  +1
6-8  +2
9-B  +3
C-E  +4
F+   +5


For extreme results I use my patented doubles rule:
If you roll a success, and the roll is doubles, you may try for
extreme success by rolling the task again.  If you succeed on this second
roll (doubles don\'t matter this time), then you have an extreme success.
If you roll a failure, and the roll is doubles, you must try to avoid
extreme failure by rolling the task again. If you fail on this second
roll (doubles again don\'t matter), then it\'s an extreme failure.


The reason I like this is that there is always at least a minute chance of
extreme failure and extreme success, no matter what your target is (not
true of TNE or MT).  Even if you only need a 3+ to succeed, you can still
fail (1/36 chance) and fail extremely (1/36 * 1/36).  If you need a 12+,
you can still succeed (again 1/36), and succeed extremely (1/36 * 1/36).
This allows for exciting events like a David vs. Goliath "lucky shot" even
when one is completely outclassed, or a complete goof-up by the hot-shot
pilot.

I have the probabilities for success/failure and extreme success/extreme
failure for all targets from 2+ to 13+ worked out at home.  I will post
them tonite.  In the meantime...

I have been giving some thought to what cities and other structures would look
like in the Traveller Universe.  How would some of the high tech buildings
look once contragravity became available, and then common.  How would the
Zhodani architecture differ from the Imperial?

I really don\'t like the way much of this has been portrayed in Traveller,
although some of the Megatraveller supplements have some interesting struc-
tures on their covers.  The Imperial palace is a massive floating sphere.
Dull. Dull, Dull, Dull!   I would think once technology can free architects
from the laws of physics, they would let there imaginations soar, not revert
to simple shapes that are easy for non-artists to draw.  (Which seems to have
been a major factor in Traveller descriptions.)

The space docks in Star Trek films and on Babylon 5 are much more interesting
than the boring sphere described in one of the DGP magazines, (I think it
was the MT Journal).  And the floating city in Empire Strikes Back was
the sort of thing I would expect on some of the more exotic atmosphere worlds.

So the bottom line is I cannot turn to the tradtional Traveller sources and
expect to find anything interesting.  I think this is a major deficency with
Traveller, as this is the sort of thing that can really add color to a game.
My single biggest problem with Traveller has been the lack of descriptions
for alien worlds that give a feel for that alieness.

So does anyone have any references, suggestions, wild ideas?

Thanks for your time.

Major good points of this system:

a) Allows determination of degree of success/failure (extreme vs.
normal) in a consistent way.  This is not true of CT, for example.

b) There\'s always some chance of both extreme success
and extreme failure, no matter what target is (so long as it\'s in the

c) Chance of extreme failure is minute (but still possible)  when target is

Figuring out success for an individual is simply a matter of figuring his
adjusted target.  For example, Jo average, with a +2 DM from his stat (I
use stat/3, so 7/3 rounds to 2) and a +1 skill, attempting an Average
diff task (7+), needs a 4+.

I generally use number targets (e.g. "a 7+ task") instead of name targets
(e.g. "an average diff task"), but if one wanted to use diff levels a la
MT with a stat/3 DM, I would simply raise the target by 1:

simple:     4+
average:    8+
difficult: 12+
formidable:16+
impossible:20+

Well, here goes my CR.02 worth here...  I do not for the life of me believe
that all architecture everywhere in the universe is going to look alike.
Maybe some elements in common, but architecture for a given society is going
to fit *that* society\'s idea of spatial concepts.

Just on this planet alone (Sol/Terra) there are vast differences in *native*
architecture that are based on the materials available as well as the local
preferences in art.

However, where one society interacts with another there is going to be some
"borrowing" of ideas.

You\'re forgetting one thing: advances in productivity are not for the sake
of the worker. They allow the worker to (ostensibly) accomplish more in the
same amount to time. One analogy I\'ve read discusses the advent of the
washing machine - it didn\'t allow housewives to expend more time in
leisure. . .it allowed them to wash more clothes.

Sounds interesting ... I hadn\'t thought of doing it that way (and great for

Actually, so do I! And I\'ve worked my own assumptions to handle it in modified
Traveller background that I use, but which wouldn\'t work for anyone else who
wasn\'t prepared to accept the assumptions of my alternate Imperial History
and related technology. It works quite well ... and you can have ships that
have no crew or few crew ... and which have no Bridges, only individual VR
control pods that are carefully dispersed and armoured such that one hit on
the "bridge" cannot KO the ship.

Uh. Not so ... I refer to TNE Base Rules, page #341 -

Yep. That\'s more or less what I would do as well ... I rather prefer 3G3 to

Yep, and don\'t think I don\'t know it. Only it isn\'t "just". I got that idea
several years ago and used it in a TCS campaign run by Steve Higginbotham.
I called them \'jump projectors\'.

>It is typical of attempts introduce a technology which will only have a

Except it isn\'t a new technology I\'m introducing. It\'s the one described in
Da Official Rules. Which only goes to show another glaring discrepancy
between the _official_ Traveller universe and the _official_ Traveller
rules. Now that discrepancy is a very good reason, IMO, to introduce some
arbitrary restriction of the technology that disallows this application.
If you could suggest a plausible one I\'d applaud you. I\'ve been trying to
come up with one that would do it, but failed miserably. I can\'t think of
anything that would eliminate this application and stll retain the drop
tanks (and I\'d like to retain the drop tanks; they\'re neat, don\'t you think?)

>What you have proposed eliminates the need for ships to carry their own

So does drop tanks, btw. It\'s always seemed strange to me that drop tanks
weren\'t used more, commercially.

Quite right. If anyone ever got that idea it\'ll revolutionize Charted Space.

>Take any ship design and start cutting out the space you need for jump fuel
>and you can see what a big difference this will make.

The same applies for a rational use of drop tanks. No, the big difference
comes if you assume that you can use the same drive reactor more than once per
week, which seems reasonable. I talked Steve into letting me use mine once per
day. This was an arbitrary restriction imposed in order to prevent the idea
from completely overwhelming the campaign. I didn\'t mind, though. Of course,
if you restrict the use of the drive to once per week, you eliminate most of
the problems. A little inelegant, not to mention arbitrary, though, IMO.

>A) It also more risky.

It can\'t be more risky than I assume. I assume that any device, no matter
what its size, that appear at a heavily defended planet\'s 100 diameter
limit and starts broadcasting is going to be toast quite fast. I don\'t even
assume that a 100 T ship will survive longer than a 5 T jump torpedo (I do
assume that they\'ll survive equally long). So the risk in both cases is 100%.

If you read a little more carefully you might have noticed that I wrote
\'unmanned\'.

It will make _a_ difference, true, but _all_ the difference? That\'s just what
we\'re discussing. You started out by claiming that jump torpedoes would allow
this tactic, which, you further claimed, wasn\'t available at all without them.
That is, a qualitative difference. Not so. The tactic is available without
them, though at a higher price. That is, a quantitative difference. How big a
difference? Well, to reiterate, if the difference is big enough to change any
of the historical battles we\'ve been told about in the Traveller background
(which, incidentally, is a postulate you have shown absolutely no evidence to
support) then it surely is worth it to the admiral to sacrifice a small 100 T
ship. If, on the other hand, the advantage to be gained from such tactics is
not enough to warrant wasting a 100 T ship on, then it obviously can\'t be that
background-shattering.

> C) It also ties up manpower, also a limited comodity.

No it dosen\'t. I said an unmanned ship (Surely one can program a ship to
perform any task one could program a jump torpedo to do).

Quite right. I misstated. I should have said that j-torps add new options,
but that the one you cited as an example wasn\'t one of them.

>As it turns out they do.  They let you do things without tying up and
>risking human life

Agreed. But they don\'t add capabilities that will destroy the Traveller
background, which was what you claimed.

>and put jump-6 message capability that fits in a ship.

Remember the heading. We\'re talking about the Rancke Jump Torpedo here. The
RJT _does_ require a ship with a jump-X drive of its own to use J-X torpedoes.

It\'s a matter of scale again. A Traveller fleet consists of ships worth
trillions of credits. If sacrificing one 30 MCr ship will increase this
fleet\'s chances of survival by as much as one thousandth of one percent,
then sacrificing the scout ship is _comparatively_ cheap. If sacrificing
it won\'t increase those chances by that much then making that tactic
cheaper can\'t have that background-shattering influence on the historical
battles that you claim.

>The fact is that tactical information and ships are _both_ important.

Yes, but in what proportions? You seem to equate one 30 MCr ship with a
whole 3+ TCr fleet.

>This produces one of the fundamental dilemmas of Traveller warfare (one
>that separates tatical brilliance from mere competance), how much of the

You persist in claiming that any ship that jumps into an enemy system is at
a risk that can be expressed in significant numbers. Not so. If you select
a nice quiet spot off the beaten routes, the odds against accidentally being
within reach of an enemy are literally astronomical.

Easy. You just select a likely spot somewhere. No enemy can cover a whole
solar system. Again you display a complete lack of any grasp of scale. It\'s
the difference in performance between photons and ships again. Try
calculating the danger space of an enemy ship. That would be a sphere with
a radius equal to the reach of the ship\'s weapons plus the distance the ship
can travel in 20 minutes (which is the time it takes for a scout ship in
danger to be ready to jump out of the system again). Now calculate how many
ships you need to cover just the inner reaches of a star system.

Ship capacitors can retain a charge for a number of 20 minute combat turns.
That means that you have time thrust the torpedo away from the ship between
charging the capacitors and the jump (That\'s why drop tanks don\'t interfere
with a ship\'s jump field either).

Very true. _IF_ you were going to send a message to four systems in the first
place. But look at the X-Boat network. How many places do you find four
connections? Furthermore, look at any place with four links. Trace each
link. How many end links do you find? Right you are: four end links. As I
mentioned in my analysis, I decided to let the fork links and the end links
cancel out in order to simplify the calculations.

>>There is every need if you want a covert network. Ships in normal space can

>First of all, that\'s not true, jumping produces a transient.

Careful, you\'ll get into another argument. Tracing ships in jump was a
capability added by _Starship Operator\'s Manual_ and is still hotly
contested by some. Not by me, though, I like it. I didn\'t say you
couldn\'t trace a jump ship, just that it was harder than to trace a
ship in N-space. By making double jumps you only need a 20 minute head
start to get lost. It takes a lot longer to get lost in N-space. Plus
you can have a guard ship ready at your intermediate jump point and
detect would-be followers (maybe even destroy them if you\'re lucky).

That\'s another one of those unsupported postulates. Why can\'t a ship be
supplied by another ship?

That was my side of the argument. Having a jump-6 ship permanently stationed
to relay jump torpedoes is expensive and makes the courier network competitive.

I\'ve read them and I didn\'t find anything to that effect. That\'s why I ask

But you\'re perfectly ready to impose an arbitrary restriction in the way
jump drives work that makes drop tanks possible but eliminates jump
projectors. Why are your arbitrary restrictions better than my arbitrary
restrictions?

These sweeping statements are pretty useless, not to mention wrong. They
make _a_ difference. I never claimed otherwise. I just claim that they
don\'t necessarily make a lot of difference. If, for example, there is a
small extra chance of the jump torpedo misjumping, then torpedoes are
_not_ cheaper than X-boats.

That\'s SO vague. An expedition from where and to where? Multiple messages
to where? How often does such a situation occur?

Let\'s see. Disposable nappies are useful and they are cheap. They are widely
used, no argument there. But I fail to see the big impact. Could you mention
a few battles that has been won or lost because of disposable nappies?

1) You don\'t loose the ship, it\'ll be back again in two weeks, and 2) Now you
have to weigh each message to see if it\'s worth the loss of a torp.

Yes, you\'ll be sending more messages with torps than without. It will make
a difference, sure. But what you\'ve failed to demonstrate is why it should
make a BIG difference.

Yep. Unless the courier captain is a hopeless imbecile he won\'t jump in
anywhere near the base.

No, they\'ll propably be able to retrieve them eventually, but in the meantime
the admiral may have jumped somewhere else. I didn\'t say he wouldn\'t get them
back some of the time. I said he couldn\'t assume that when he set out.

No need to shout. I\'m perfectly aware of that. Communication is limited to
the speed of jump, so to speak. Jump torpedoes make no difference there.
They don\'t go any faster than a ship.

>The fact is that no organization has all the comunications it wants. Not even

None of them can send messages faster than 6 parsecs/week, if that\'s what
you mean (With or without jump torpedoes). _That\'s_ why the Imperium is
forced to use a feudal structure.

>By making communications easier you are allow more people to get more info
>(both civilian and military)

Marginally, perhaps, but it won\'t affect the time it take messages to get
between the core to the fringes.

Yes, but not a significant amount of ressources. Read my analysis.

Light cruisers aren\'t exactly first-line units, but never mind. However,
first of all that would depend entirely on the frequency of messages.
Secondly it assumes no loss of torpedoes. You only have to loose 12 to make
it more expensive than a courier. Fourthly, couriers are more versatile.
They can, for example, deliver messages to destinations two jumps away.
Fifthly, if, as you claim, jump torpedoes increase the number of messages
sent (and I agree with you that it propably does) then the saving will be
far less. If, for example, jump torpedoes encourages admirals to send off
two messages per day, where before they would only send one per week, we\'re
already using _more_ money than with the couriers.

>I call that a big difference.

You\'ve never actually played in a TCS campaign, have you? It\'s the question
of scale again. A 30,000 T LC may seem big to you, but to people who command
fleets that are 200 times bigger it dosen\'t make a lot of difference. It
makes _some_ difference, of course, but not a big one. Not one that _must_
change the Traveller background.

 I wouldn\'t swear to it, but that _may_ have been the original idea

 excessive desire to avoid bowel evacuation, and can get past an

 recombined.  I do believe that, mechanics and "undesirable"

 _everyone_ can benefit from ideas from both "camps".  Supreme

 Pfft!  There is no "right" and "wrong" universe; there\'s only the
 "official" (formerly GDW-supported) universe and the "unofficial"
 referees\' variants.  Of course, some variants are less "Traveller"
 than others, but I take the view that if it\'s recognizably
 related to the "official" universe, it\'s Traveller enough to be
 interesting to me...  That\'s one of the reasons I play a homebrew
 combination of rules and backgrounds from all three sets (most
 notably, character generation from TNE, with some reference to
 tables in CT and MT; task system roughly from MT, with some
 homebrew mods for compatibility with TNE skillsets;  quite often
 in a CT universe, although sometimes in the TNE Regency).  Not to
 mention the "paper" I wrote expanding on the profiling of
 starports, and the creation of the whole RICE concept (both over
 on the TNE list).  I like Resource mode better that Flamethrower
 mode, myself.

 Now, take back those apologies and post your brains for picking.
 I am hopeful that, if people around here see a good example,
 they\'ll follow it.

Are you kidding?  The introduction of air-to-air missles had a _huge_
impact.  It\'s true cannons were put back in, but only proves they
didn\'t completely loose their value.  Nobody is arguing that j-torps
will completely replace manned ships.  But, just like missles had a
bit impact on air combat, j-torps would have a big impact on
interstellar communications.

By this reasoning, every background, no matter how poorly thought out,
is equally believable.  For me, a background where the technologies
and the societies don\'t make sense w.r.t each other is just hokey.

>I\'ll also point out that I know people who say that having J-drive at all
>makes Trav. very hard to believe in.

Some people have higher standards.  At least with J-drive it is part
of the fundamental suspension of disbelief (see my earlier comments
on this subject) and the background was written with knowledge and
thought of the consequences of the technology.  This is always better
than adding technologies to a background that is already set without
regard for the consequences.

I don\'t know.  My reading of official rules would be that if you
can screw up a jump by just being to close, then beaming power
to the ship is right out.

I don\'t consider the idea that an energy beam will cause as much
disruption to a field as simply being to close to be "abitrary".
I would say it follows quite logically.

>I can\'t think of
>anything that would eliminate this application and stll retain the drop
>tanks (and I\'d like to retain the drop tanks; they\'re neat, don\'t you think?)

I haven\'t given drop tanks much thought.  I would say that you should
be required to bring them with you when you jump (after all, if you
drop them just before, then you will be within 100 diameters of them).
I would also think that you would need field generators on them (since
you need to cover the whole vessel).  At least that is how I would
say they would have to work to be consistent.  I don\'t know how
much of a background problem they would cause.

It would be hard to see why you couldn\'t use them once a minute.

This is just the sort of problem with adding techologies to an existing

The point is, what if you don\'t know if the planet is heavily defended
or completely open?
Do you send in one ship to see, knowing that one ship is easy to pick
off?  Do you send in the whole fleet knowing that it can handle a lot
of situations, but if you made a mistake you\'ve lost a _lot_?  This
is just the sort of dilema that jump-torps eliminate.

Communications are hard enough to justify all that money spent
and the X-boat network and expensive networks of jump-6 couriers.
Clearly cheaper is going to make a difference.

To put it another way, clearly they make communications a lot
cheaper, so they will have a big impact on communications (over
and beyond the issue of loosing men and stuff).  Since difficult
communiciations is a fundamental premise of the background,
they will change the background.

No, I said it would mean you didn\'t have to loose men and ships
to check out systems.

But you still have made it so a jump-x ship can carry a jump-x device
that can send a message.  Otherwise that ship had to carry along a whole
\'nother ship.

Um, the cheapest j-6 ship I\'ve seen is at least 30 times that cost.
But, in any case, nations with battleships don\'t consider patrol
boats expendable.  Why do you think our navy is putting so much
into unmanned spotting plains when jeeps are so much cheaper
than tanks.

>>The fact is that tactical information and ships are _both_ important.

>Yes, but in what proportions? You seem to equate one 30 MCr ship with a

NO, I\'m saying that just because you are big enough to afford
big ships makes little ships irrelavent.  If you look at history
it takes a lot of logisitics, including a lot of little ships,
to support a big ship.

The fact is that your diffences in cost are not new in historical
navies.  And they just don\'t have the attitude that the little
ships are so expendible that you can just ignore loosing them
when cheaper ways that don\'t involve loss of men are available.

>You persist in claiming that any ship that jumps into an enemy system is at
>a risk that can be expressed in significant numbers.

No, I persists in claiming that jumping into an unknown system exposes
you to an unknown risk.  That\'s just the problem.

>Not so. If you select

>within reach of an enemy are literally astronomical.

You can\'t select a spot if you don\'t know what\'s in the system.
As to being off the beaten routes.  If you are going to be
close enough to detect the enemy, you have to be close
enough to be detected by them.

>Easy. You just select a likely spot somewhere.


You can\'t select a spot when you don\'t know where the enemy is
(which is the problem in the first place).

>Again you display a complete lack of any grasp of scale.

No, the problem is you apply that scale to only to combat
and not to detection.  If you are close enough to be
confident of detecting the enemy, you are close enough
to be in danger from energy weapons.

To be honest, I\'ve not seen this and would have to see it before
I believed it.  If it were true, I would say that it is a mistake
that opens as big a can of worms as torps and needs to be eliminated
rather than compounded upon.

First of all, we were talking about courier networks.  In news of the
emporers death this is exactly the sort of thing you would want to
do.  Also, even with X-boats, you still gain (in addition to
other problems), the ability to send messages more than once
a week.

I wasn\'t talking about tracing ships in jump (which would cause
a lot of problems to the background).  I was talking about
the emmisions that you put out entering and leaving jump space
(and which can be used to tell that a ship has jumped in/out
nearby).

Don\'t cut my comments in half and then try and score cheap points

whole part, it would be clear that I never said a ship can\'t supply
another ship.  (see below).  The message stops here.

XBoat, and TNE is on the Traveller List:

They work totally differently. This causes major differences in many of the
traditional assumptions: In-system travel, combat, strategy, CGen, success
chances for assorted tasks.

Even the flexibility of FF&S causes problems, cannonizing something that
many might have never realized nor cared about: J-Torps.




As for the on-going discussion Re J-Torps:

If you have message drones, then you can have Nuke Drones. So unless they
are much more expensive by weight or displacement than ships, will come to
be the major "Hot War" weapons system. If you can build a Torp, you can
build a bigger one with a 0.5 Gigaton warhead. And still cost less than a
bomb and a 100 ton bomber. It will have to survive getting in system, but
hey, a major fleet could launch wave after wave of them, and if EVEN ONE
gets through, WOW!

A Batron could easily launch a dozen from the big ships, plus more from the
associated "Tag-Alongs". So you\'ld have heavily stealthed, 50-60 MCr torps,
which can EMP quite a bit. Jump them in to a different point than the
fleet, and let the target choose priority.

Also, remember one other limiting factor with fleet units, derived from
cannon: Jump time is not a constant, nor is it stated AFIK to be a fleet
constant. A Fleet jumping with a given vector (say 20 Mm/h aka 20,000 kph,
or roughly 1 g-turn), arrive iover a 48-72 hour time spread (potential)
putting a potentially strong invader at a disad: he may not have time to
regroup. Sure, the fleet can stop and wait for the others, making them
sitting ducks. They can have a scheduled out-sys (or deep in-sys) regroup
point. They can go to target, and by the time they regroup, they will no
longer have surprise.

On average, a given fleet of 24 ships: 4 will arrive on day 6, 16 on day 7,
and 4 more on day 8 post engage.

So armed J-torps will be much like Buzzbombs in WW II. When you encouter
the first, expect more. Terror Weapons. Unpredictable, morale breaking,
devastating occasionally to real targets, and only able to be stopped with
many more than their own numbers due to random time, and exit, points. And
far cheaper than replacing a ship and crew. And by the time you know they
location of the launcher, it can be GONE!

With Ranke torps, they are primarily a deadly diversion. With self-powering
ones, they are a major MENACE to the defender.

And, in both cases, the fleet could launch a set of sensor drones to a
given set of coordinates, jump in a few days later, and get great
intelligence, with no crew risks until the first ships of the group arrive,
and the torps go active.

They do change more than just commo. Intel, warfare, and such would all
have major use for them. Think of softening regina\'s defenses for three
days prior to jump-in with J-Buzz: sure, only a few ships would be lost.
But that\'s three ships lost WITH CREW, plus possibly a strike of a single
torp. (Pardon my ignorance about the total fleet strengths, but I don\'t own
FFW. Anyone selling?) Also, the fact that they would be EMM, tiny targets
(+4 or more Diffmods to hit or detect), possibly with evasions once they
are under fire. And they\'d prolly come in passive, to maximize their
defenses. Sure their expensive, but so is training warship crews.

enough of my ranting.

I think you\'re looking at it much too simplisticly, looking only at
the technological end while many other factors were also at play.
For instance, the increase in the standard of living only goes to those
who recieve the benefits of the productivity gain. In most cases,
that will be the owners. However, that leaves a few owners a lot
richer and the general work force still with the same standard they
had before. Historically, it\'s been political and economic pressure
brought about by labor unions and other organizations (some churches,
etc.), plus the threat of a more radical spectre (usually communism),
to get them to "share the wealth".

So the actual formula is not just technology.
Tech defines what is THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE,
but that will then be apportioned by various social factors, who
will only follow your linear progression in some cases, not all, and
(IMO) not most.

This is close to the lowest pay-grade aboard starships. Officers will be
better off by several times, lower grades will be better by
a few times 10%.

Or they could be living in street gutters, shantytowns, and clapboard
hovels, begging, doing service work for cheaper than the machines
can (which, we agree, is pretty low), and engaged in less savory
"service industries".

No economic direct connection. The World Generation gives a tech boost

that are not neccessarily true.

"Iris valves are pressure-sensitive automatic portals set in bulkheads....
It functions much like the iris of a camera; many panels retract into the

"Valves are very difficult to force open once fully closed.  Throw 9+ to
force open a closed iris valve; DM +1 if strength 10+, +2 if dexterity

Gunfilre and explosions will simply block the valve tighter."

Supplement 7, Traders and Gunboats, at 6-7.

The illustrations show a concentric ring around the iris valve.  Id.

The fact that one can force an iris with bare hands suggests that valves\'
plates overlap slightly.  I propose a tool to facilitate forcing iris
valves.  I would for historical reasons call it "the jaws of life."

The jaws of life works as follows:  One jaw is placed against an
overlapping plate.  The other is placed against the inside of the
concentric ring.  By means of a lever, the first jaw is pushed against the
overlapping plate until it is forced back.

The lever can also be motorized.

The jaws of life is commonly carried by rescue teams and boarding parties.
Starships normally carry several with their fire-fighting gear.  The jaws
of life is manufactured by many companies at various tech levels.  Ling
Standard Products\' non-motorized TL 9 version retails for about Cr100;
motorized for Cr750.

In MT game terms, use of the jaws of life makes the task roll one level
easier (I haven\'t found the task in MT; where is it?); in CT, DM +8 for
use.  Applicable skill in either system would be mech, but the skill\'s
only application is to get the device seated properly.  Once it\'s in, even
I could make it work.

By copy hereof, I am asking my brother, who recently obtained his
mechanical engineering degree, to make a rough design for us.

But how? By closing your eyes and hoping it will go away? There are
essentially three way to deal with discrepancies in rules and background:

1) Explain them away by introducing new (or rather, previously
   unpublishd ;-) facts or rules.
2) By changing thing retroactively.
3) By ignoring them.

I prefer the first. You appear to go for the third. Well, that\'s your
prerogative. And I won\'t pretend I haven\'t done it myslef, when I couldn\'t
come up with a plausible new fact or a retcon that didn\'t spoil more than
it saved. But I can\'t understand an attitude that essentially claims that
these discrepancies don\'t exist at all.

Besides being totally irrelevant, because I never said anything about beaming
the energy over, it cartainly dosen\'t follow at all. It is stated quite
clearly that what screws up a jump drive is the proximity of a gravity
field. Energy dosen\'t generate a gravity field. Beaming energy to a ship
may screw up it\'s jump field, but if it does it is a previously unknown
(arbitrarily added) effect different from the gravity field effect.

You evidently haven\'t read the rules about them either.

Tsk, tsk. Naughty. That would run counter to numerous references in the
background history.

No, that\'s what I\'ve tried to point out to you in my last four messages. I
apologize for not making it clearer from the start, but I made the mistake
of assuming that you knew the rules and background that you are defending
so vehemently. Pay attention this time: JUMP CAPACITORS CAN RETAIN THEIR
CHARGE LONG ENOUGH FOR THE SHIP TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE DROP TANKS. Therefor
they can retain their charge long enough to move away from a jump torpedo
or (more likely) thrust the torpedo away from it. The same goes for jump
projectors, unfortunately.

>>So does drop tanks, btw. It\'s always seemed strange to me that drop tanks
>>weren\'t used more, commercially.
>
>Drop tanks may not have been well thought out.

Oh, I think the tanks themselves were a good idea. Unfortunately later
background authors didn\'t fully work out the ramifications inherent in
their existence. (Which goes to show that working out the technology
beforehand is no guarantee of getting the background right). But they
are part of the background none the less.

Well, it takes 20 minute to charge jump capacitors and you could plausibly
add a delay in getting the next ship hooked up. and then you might claim
that the special kind of reactor needs to cool off between uses.

But as I\'m getting quite tired of pointing out, I\'m not adding a technology
here, I\'m just applying an existing one creatively.

>The point is, what if you don\'t know if the planet is heavily defended
>or completely open?

Simple. You assume it is heavily defended.

>Do you send in one ship to see, knowing that one ship is easy to pick off?

But it won\'t be easy to pick off. It will have to be in range of an enemy
ship. (A whole other thing is that I propably won\'t bother to send in a ship.
It will cost me two weeks waiting until it returns and by the time my fleet
arrives the data it gave me would be two weeks out of date).

>Do you send in the whole fleet knowing that it can handle a lot of
>situations, but if you made a mistake you\'ve lost a _lot_?

If you jump into a system where things get too hot you only need to stand one
combat round. It takes 20 minutes to charge the drive and bug out (No sane
admiral will jump into a system without fuel enough in his tanks to get out
again).

>This is just the sort of dilema that jump-torps eliminate.

How? The torpedo can\'t return to you on its own, and if it could the data
would still be two weeks old.

>To put it another way, clearly they make communications a lot cheaper,

They do not make communication a lot cheaper. Cheaper, possibly, unless we
assume a loss rate (which I do), but not a lot.

>so they will have a big impact on communications (over and beyond the issue
>of loosing men and stuff).  Since difficult communiciations is a fundamental

The fundamental premise of the background is the length of time it takes to
get messages from one place to another. Jump torpedoes does not change that
one little bit.

>>which, you further claimed, wasn\'t available at all without them.

That\'s not how I remember it, but I\'ll take your word for it that that was
what you meant. Well, that\'s wrong too. A torpedo can\'t check out a system
since it can\'t return on it\'s own.

>Um, the cheapest j-6 ship I\'ve seen is at least 30 times that cost.

The cheapest you\'ve heard about (just a few days ago, in one of my postings)
is 8.5 times that cost. But we were talking about sending an unmanned ship
into the thick of an enemy fleet. Why use a Fleet Courier for that? A
Scout Ship would do just as well. Hence the 30 MCr price tag. (Though if
that tactic was so all-fired useful, the Navy would build dedicated !00
T propes which would be a lot cheaper).

>But, in any case, nations with battleships don\'t consider patrol boats
>expendable.

Ever heard about screening units? The screening units are put in greater
risk in order to improve the screened unit(s)\' chances of survival.
Noone _wants_ to loose any of the screen units, but they are considered
expendable _if it will save the central unit_. Besides, an unmanned Scout
is not the equivalent of a patrol boat, it is the equivalent of a missile
(And that goes even more for dedicated drones).

>The fact is that your diffences in cost are not new in historical navies.
>And they just don\'t have the attitude that the little ships are so
>expendible that you can just ignore loosing them when cheaper ways that
>don\'t involve loss of men are available.

But what you were claiming was that the cheaper way didn\'t exist then the
more expensive way was so expensive that it would not be used. Maybe so.
But only if the benefit to be derived from it is enough to justify the
expenditure of 3 MCr but not enough to justify 30 MCr. And if this is
the case, the benefit is not big enough to change any of the established
background.

>No, I persists in claiming that jumping into an unknown system exposes
>you to an unknown risk.  That\'s just the problem.

But it is not a problem if the risk is minuscule in any possible case.

>You can\'t select a spot if you don\'t know what\'s in the system.

You\'d hardly be ignorant of the number of planets and their plane of
rotation, now would you? So if you select a spot away from the mainworld
and the gas giants and off the plane of rotation, the odds against
appearing within effective range of an enemy starship are astronimical.

>If you are close enough to be confident of detecting the enemy, you are
>close enough to be in danger from energy weapons.

Do you know the difference between a communicator and an energy weapon? Its
the strength of the beam they send out. You can detect a ship from at lot
farther out than you can harm it.

But there is absolutely no canonical evidence that any of the factions had
any breath of communication (and good reasons to assume that they didn\'t).
All we know is that they were able to get key messages a long way along
one or two straight lines. Nothing is mentioned about dispersing the info.
Indeed, we are told that Lucan\'s version didn\'t make it to Ileish until the
X-boats brought it, and that it was effectively suppressed in many places
there. Dosen\'t sound like many of the other factions had links to Ileish,
now does it?

>Also, even with X-boats, you still gain (in addition to other problems),

Only if you are willing to pay for it. And only if you assume that there
are no losses involved in using jump torpedoes (which I assume there are).

Yes, nearby. What is \'nearby\' in a star system? How far out can you detect
an arriving or departing jump drive? And what was the original point? I\'ve
lost track.

No, buy not adding new stuff and then having to fix afterwards.  I
don\'t know where you got your 20 minutes capactitor rule, but
it isn\'t in the original books.  If something was added that
screws up the setting, you are better off removing it rather
than adding more stuff that will change the setting even more.

The best way is to think about what will cause discrepancies before
you introduce them.  I\'ve never allowed things like jump-torps
or ships to be charged externally 20 min before a jump so I have
no problem.

I would say that #1 is worse of all cases.  You still
have to introduce new rules (if you are going to do that you might
as well just remove them and fix the problem) and then you have
to worry about the consequences (forseen and unforseen) and
are going to have to do #1 again to take care of those, but then
you have even more effects and it never ends.

In any case, if the fact the Traveller isn\'t perfect, means that
there are some inconsistencies, I would say that doesn\'t make
introducing more a good idea.

>>I haven\'t given drop tanks much thought.
>
>You evidently haven\'t read the rules about them either.

OK, we can end here.  I have read them.

Clearly my standards of thinking about things are higher than yours
(which appear to be nothing more than a few minutes though to convince
yourself that what you want to be believe is true).  I would rather
take some time (I usually mull things over for a few months thinking
about things I\'ve miss) rather than take your approach of a few half
assed rationalizations that people are expected to accept
unquestioningly and which will only lead to more trouble.

(I must say, I find that attacking your opponents credibility is a
common tatic in threads when someone no longer finds themselves
able to come up with cogent responses.  As is the use increased use,
which you also show, of attempts to use smart cute remarks.  I have
lost interest in the thread a while back and I\'m certainly not going
to stick with it when tatics degenerate to this level.)

 Are you kidding?  The introduction of air-to-air missles had a _huge_
 impact.  It\'s true cannons were put back in, but only proves they
 didn\'t completely loose their value.

Are you kidding? I didn\'t say missles had no value. I said that the
pundits were wrong about how much they would change things. They
thought things would change so much that guns would have no value.

 Nobody is arguing that j-torps
 will completely replace manned ships.  But, just like missles had a
 bit impact on air combat, j-torps would have a big impact on
 interstellar communications.

Well, at least that\'s your argument. A few of us differ with you on
that point.

 By this reasoning, every background, no matter how poorly thought out,
 is equally believable.  For me, a background where the technologies
 and the societies don\'t make sense w.r.t each other is just hokey.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

And, apparently, by your reasoning, a background has to conform with
your idea of what will be important & what won\'t or it\'s somehow less
credible. I could also argue that when postulating that far into the
future it doesn\'t matter what you say. You have virtually no chance of
even getting close to what will really happen anyway. The future could
very easily make no sense to you or me.
==========================================================================

 Some people have higher standards.  At least with J-drive it is part
 of the fundamental suspension of disbelief (see my earlier comments
 on this subject) and the background was written with knowledge and
 thought of the consequences of the technology.  This is always better
 than adding technologies to a background that is already set without
 regard for the consequences.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What you really mean is that you prefer to believe in what you think
will be significant & what won\'t. Nothing wrong with that. However, I
don\'t buy your "slant" & Hans has posted enough, IMO, to show that his
"slant" is at least as credible as yours. Esp., wrt the supposed impact
on est. Imperial History.

I believe that this was canon only in CT; I recall reading an article
by one of the DGP staff (perhaps in the Starship Ops Manual, or in the
Travellers\' Digest) which stated that by increasing the time spent
making the jump calculations, a fleet could reduce the spread of its
ships when they came out of J-space.

This pre-jump coordination between the computers in the fleet
effectively does away with the need to spend several days regrouping
in the target system.

Estate and can pass on the title) and Titular (who have no Estate, but
often a stipend, and cannot pass either on).  Many Landed are also
Titular, a higher title rewarded for service, ie the Baron of Snee (the
Estate), and Count of Eridani (a higher title rewared).  Only the Baron
of Snee can be passed on to whomever the noble wanted to.

Estates.  The Landed nobility possess these.  They have a title of Baron
(most), Viscount (awarded by Sector Duke), Count, or Marquis (awarded by
the Emperor).  Thus a Baron, if she performs an outstanding service for
the empire, may be made a Count and be able to pass that on to her heir.
An Estate is on a decent planet, decent is open to debate.  The noble
draws revenues from the planet, often via the starport.  Nobles are not
supposed to interfer with the local government, just advise on Imperial
matters, but the possibilities for problems exist.  The noble gets a
living, without imperial monies being spent, and the planet gets a
representative at the subsector council.

Ranks.  Rank is important in that the higher the rank, the more revenue
the noble can draw.  It also effects priorities for communication,
appointments, seats in restaurants, etc.  So, nobles want it, and to get
it they have to serve the empire.

Imperial Councils.  This is where nobles serve.  The Subsector Duke (Duke
of his planet) is also the President of the Imperial Council for (fill in
subsector here).  (Sector Dukes are the pres for the Sector council, made
up of the Dukes, or, more likely, their appointees.)  The Council meets
on the capital planet, about 100 days a year.  Here the nobles discuss
and implement Imperial policy.  Nobles from the council are assigned, at
the Dukes leisure, as Subsector Directors for the various Imperial
Ministries, War, Justice, etc.  Needless to say, the professional
bueracracies do the real work--the noble is an appointee.  Important
point--the decisions of the council are decided by vote, one noble, one
vote, thus there is no reason for one noble to hold more than one estate,
though some do.

Noble Families.  First off, these tend to be more like mafia families
than the nice nuclear family.  Each subsector likely has 10-14 Families,
each of 2-6 Landed Nobles and a number of Titular Nobles, plus spouses,
siblings, friends, children, etc.  Families are more factions linked by
some common background, often, but not always, genetics.

The Noble Life.  Basically, a third of the time is on the Estate,
ensuring the money is coming in, if nothing else.  A third will be spent
in council, playing politics, parties, meetings, etc.  The last third
will often be on assignments for the empire, usually in the subsector,
but not always.  In short, being a Landed, or Titled, Noble is a good
life, but it is a continuos round of events.

Thats it for now.  Again, this is a possibility based upon reserach and
reading about historic nobles and aristocracies.  Does this fit into the
CT/MT universe?  Also, sorry this got so long!

to predict.  Not that they can be introduced without changing the
background.

Well the point of this thread (as far as I know) is for each side to
justify why they think they are right.  I happen to think that nobody has
been able to adequately address the problems created not only by the
torpedoes, but by the "fixes" that have been put in to try and make them
work.  However, if you want to end it by a simple declaration that you
don\'t happen to agree, that\'s fine too.

Actually, in CT multiple ships could jump in perfect synchronization.
When DGP added the variability to the jump times, someone
eventually pointed out the "scatter" problem for fleets and
convoys, and so DGP and Marc Miller came up with the
"incease jump-calc time" solution.

The fleet (with respect to "real" time) still has that circa 2 days
variability in jump breakout, but with respect to the other ships
in that fleet scatter time is reduced to about an hour.

The point, as far as I\'m concerned, is that you maintain that the intro-

maintain that this isn\'t necessarily so.

And I say it does. It demonstrates that the "experts" were wrong about
the impact of AAM\'s, just as I say that you are wrong about the impact
of J-torps.

Well this whole dispute, as far as I\'m concerned, is about the credibility
of your assertion that the introduction of J-torps mandates a radical
change in Trav. background. I\'m saying, "not necessarily". The burden of
proof is upon you & there\'s no real way that you can prove it.

I started with a simple declaration. (Remember, "not necessarily") &
that seems to have triggered this lengthy thread. As far as I\'m concerned
you have failed to prove your assertion & in fact, there has been more
than enough posted to throw it into doubt. Doubt is all that\'s necessary

Shows what you know about Desert Storm:

Factoid: American women in the field & support units spent 40% less time
changing children than did their Iraqi counterparts, allowing them more time
to provide support.  Further, use of disposable nappies (diapers in American
usage, DDs as slang) enabled american units to travel with a much smaller
transport tail than did their Iraqi counterparts (not requirement for
carrying dirties).  Accordingly, American equipment stayed combat ready
where Iraqis did not.

Factoid: DDs were used as emergency field dressings, as they were complete
with tape and padding, and tended to lift blood away from the wound so
medics could clearly see the damage done.  This obviously saved the lives of
many NATO and allied soldiers.

Factoid:  DDs were readily available to clean up aircraft and vehicle
maintenance areas, and were used help clean up Kuwaiti oil fields after the war.

(:-0  :-0  :-0  ;-)   many, many smileys

Fact: It is clear to me you have not had a child below the age of toilet
training.  In point of fact, the DD has helped me (personally) win the
Battle of the Public Restroom, the Battle of the Backseat of a compact, the
Battle of the Beach, the Battle of Guesting (especially in non-child
households), and in particular, the tactically challenging Battles of the
Small Men\'s Room Without Any Surface Area and Aircraft Restroom.  These may
not seem earth-shattering to you, but they were to me!


    mitch

PS. In point of fact, the same absorption technology used to develop
disposable nappies has been used to develop other absorbers - like those
used in oil and chemical accidents.  I value my environment, because
breathing and drinking are dificult without it.

I was strongly tempted to reply to your sneaky little attack on
me in the public forum where it was made, but since I really am going to
be personal this time, and since I firmly believe that one ought to go to
e-mail in such cases, I decided to forego that pleasure. You have the gall
to accuse me of being ignorant of the rules and to not think thing through
when you yourself have displayed abysmal ignorance of your own. One example:

>I don\'t know where you got your 20 minutes capactitor rule, but it isn\'t
in the original books.

_High Guard_, Starship Combat, Pre-combat decision step, 3rd paragraph:
"_Jumping_: A ship [...] must expend energy points equal to two turns output
from a power plant whose number is equal to the jump being attempted (EP
required =0.01MJn). If it can do this in two turns, it jumps at the end of
two turns. If it can do this in one turn or less, it jumps at the end of
one turn..."

It should be obvious, so I suppose i\'d better spell it out for you, that
any ship with jump-2 or better engines will be able to execute at least
a jump-1 in just one turn.

>>You evidently haven\'t read the rules about them either.
>
> OK, we can end here.  I have read them.

You then get upset over a little dig at the lack of knowledge you\'ve
displayed earlier. The above sentense is no more than the litteral truth.
>From the evidence available to me it certainly didn\'t appear as if you
had read them, since your previous remarks display a marked lack of
understanding of them. Nevertheless, the dig was friendly meant, since
I tend to regard fellow gamers as kindred spirits until the opposite has
been proven. And friends can chaff each other without taking offense.
Well, you\'re obviously not a kindred spirit. My mistake. And my gain,
since I\'d rather not associate, even by remote, with anyone who is
capable of such arrant, topsy-turvy nonsens as:

>Clearly my standards of thinking about things are higher than yours

Your standards are different, that much is clear.

>(I must say, I find that attacking your opponents credibility is a
>common tatic in threads when someone no longer finds themselves
>able to come up with cogent responses.

That would mean something only if I had been finding myself unable to come
up with cogent responses. Another tactic, let me add, is to take offense
at some remark of your opponent and cut off further discussion when one
finds oneself unable to come up with anything but stubborn reiterations
of already-refuted arguments.

>As is the use increased use, which you also show, of attempts to use smart
>cute remarks.

Here I suppose I must plead guilty. In retrospect I can see that as you
repeatedly displayed a failure to understand my arguments (as opposed to
understanding them, but disagreeing with them) I did become gradually more
exasperated at having to explain something that should have been obvious to
anyone who had a thorough familiarity with the rules and didn\'t stubbornly
refuse to even consider that he might be wrong. So I guess I did slip in
more digs as time went by, though, as I said, as a friendly way of blowing
off steam, since I still thought you were honestly trying to have a fruitful
argument rather than merely wanting to win.

Some of your ideas may have merit, sir, but your way of conducting an
argument does not. Good day to you, sir.

The best canon source for the nobility that you may still be able to find
from CT/MT is the MT _Imperial Encyclopedia_, a combination of library data,
equipment/vehicle lists, and a couple of short historical articles that
includes one on Imperial nobility and the Moot.

Your idea is basically similar to published cannon. However, unlanded
titles are able to be passed on and draw no monies. The landed nobles are
also not the same as positional nobles, whose title is based upon the
position they hold, which includes all planetary rulers, sector and
subsector dukes, and Domain Archdukes.

Hans & I have been debating this privately of late.
I suggest maintaining the cannonical structure, which has math working out
a bit high from CGen tables (3-5% of population in nobility, and almost as
many knights).

the three types of noble (paraphrased from Library Data(N-Z))

I agree with giving enfeoffed nobles the ability to draw revenue from a

I never really followed the Jump torp debate, because of prior demands on
my "Traveller Time" and a cowardly need to avoid heated arguments.
However, I would be interested to hear how the argument boils down to,
like the Great Feudal Technocracy Debate ("You can define it anyway you
choose") and the Fabulous Jump Rock-Throwing Contest ("You can\'t stop
jump rocks at velocity").

Thank you.

The books are in great condition, except for some scribbling in the vehicle
costs sections (it looks like the owner was knocking off zeroes in
accordance with errata.  Somebody (probably the first owner) had protected
the covers with contact paper.

This is what it has to say about missiles:
"....Other types of missiles are  possible (for example, jump capable
message torpedoes, or bombs foor attacks against planetary surfaces), but
such require either specific alterations to ordinary torpedoes, or location
of an arms supplier who deals in such items.  Specific attributes of such
non-standard missiles are the realm of the referee."  (Book 2, page 18,
under "Expendables")

For those who would argue that this consists of putting jump torpedoes in
the _Traveller_ "canon", I would like to point out that "Special Supplement
3:  Missiles in _Traveller" (JTAS 21,1984) mentions numerous variations for
building missiles, but jump torpedoes aren\'t one of them.

Thank you for letting me natter on like a proper geek.

I have been thinking about how best to develop the site from here.
Rather than just creating HTML versions of the HDs I think moving to

but I\'d be interested in anybody elses opinions. I would also like to
extend the "surrounding sectors" map at the site to include all of
known space with clickable links to sector sites where they are known.
Has anybody else got this in hand?

Finally I\'m busy learning Javascript at the moment so you may see some
Java applets for UPP, UWP generation, and maybe Java versions of some
of my old DOS programs.

Hope you enjoy the site and any comments welcome.

    'body' => 'Hi All.
I recently came across an interesting little quote in High Guard
regarding invading fleets.  Under the discussion of black globes it is
stated:

"Invisibility: Since a black globe field absorbs all energy, a ship with
its field completely on is, at any range over a few kilometers,
effectively invisible.  In battle this will have no effect...However, the
advantages to a fleet which has not yet been detected are immense.
Suppose, for instance, that a fleet were to jump into a system with its
black globes on and its velocity set upon a predetermined course.  It
could drift unseen past any defending fleet and drop its screens at a
preplanned moment..."

This implies a couple of interesting things:

1. Fleets of ships jumping in can arrive in roughly the same time-space
(close enough that they will be able to coordinate their actions despite
not being able to communicate).

2. Ships can jump into a system with a specific desired vector.

3. Ships can turn their black globes on in jump space!  This is weird.
What happens?  Do you absorb energy from jump space?  Spoooky...

4. Ships with their black globes on 100% are less visible than normal.
This contradicts statements in "Grand Survey" (and "Worldtamers.." ?)
that these ships would absorb too much of the background radiation and
appear as below-baseline readings on sensor readouts.  Here\'s the quote on
that one:

"A TL 15 ship may be equipped with a black globe which hides its
radiation and neutrinos.  The disadvantage to this technique is that the
black globe also blanks natural neutrino sources behind it, so a "hole"
in the starfield appears on the sensor.  A skilled operator will notice
this "below background" reading..."

I have a couple of questions about this: 1) Is there a "background
neutrino level" or would you have to occlude a star?  2) Would the BG\'s
absorption of other radiation types make it visible?

Here\'s another interesting thing, this time regarding the High Guard
quote.  If ships can have a predetermined vector towards the mainworld upon
jumping in, what\'s to keep someone from sending in a ship with a really
high velocity (or several such), and completely obliterating the planet?

Comments?  Criticisms?  Ranting Flames?  (<-- in order of preference :-)

Excuse me? I pick a *random* point that is 1 AU or more outside the
plane of the ecliptic in the system, and not near the zenith or nadir.
And make it from 1 to 20 AU out from the star. That\'s a volume of over
30,000 cubic AUs. Which means that if there were a spare 30,000 ships
(over and above the ones patrolling *in* the plane of the ecliptic,
which is where the planets are) then the odds are only *even* that
there\'d an enemy ship within an AU of me! That\'s 150 million km.

Wrong. In the *real world* you can detect ships with *current*
technology at ranges that *far* exceed the ranges of any weapons in
Traveller. A telescope bigger than the Hubble scope, and equipped with
similar instrument can get adequate info. A wide field survey scope can
locate potential targets for the narrow feild scope in a matter of
hours.

Don\'t forget Heplar is going to be visible a *long* ways off. And *any*
ship much past the equivalent of Venus orbit will be *considerably*
brighter in the IR than any natural body.

Even if you accept "jump flash" as canon, then somebody *still* has to
get within attack range in time to attack. The spy ship has lots of
time to leave.

If I was doing this, I\'d send a half dozen or so ships, widely spaced.
That way you can compare the images from the wide field cameras and get
accurate positions for *everything* that\'s on the plates. Add in the
detailed info from the narrow view scope, and whatever info the ELINT
folks (radio monitoring and the like) can get, and you\'ll have *lots*
of info on the system.

Sure, stuff can still hide. But you\'ll have a pretty good idea of where
things are.

Also, never underestimate the possibility of impersonating a merchant
who didn\'t realize he was jumping into an area that was being contested
(or who hoped to get in, sell something "vital" and get out before the
fighting starts). You can get a lot of intel that way. Whether from
real merchants or ones who secretly report to you.

It\'s basicly not worth the trouble to make heroic efforts to stop spy
ships. You keep an eye out for chances to nail one without going too
far out of your way, and meanwhile try to disguise what you can (not as
much as many would like) and otherwise keep in mind that the enemy will
your moves within a week.

Regarding your question on neutrino background: No neutrino

Almost all neutrinos we\'ve seen to date have come from 1) Fission
reactors, 2) Particle accellerators, and 3) The sun.

I\'m not aware of any other large neutrino sources in the

Sounds like a 1977 black box set.  They went to metric in later black box
editions, as I recall.  Check inside the title page for copyright date.
Many people don\'t know this, but the "black box" rules had at least one
update sometime around 1980 or so when the books were prittified, rules
cleaned up, and other miscellaneous changes made.  For instance, some of
the black books have their titles printed on the back cover along the
spine as well as on the front!

Not in the 1st edition rules.  The 1st edition had you roll 3D and
subtract 8.  This lead to a very unrealistic situation where you
could pump somebody full of bullets from your pistol, and wind up
doing no damage...since the average die roll would be 9-8=1.  Quite
often you wound up doing negative damage...

I have a set of 1st edition books and 2nd edition books.  This sounds
a lot like 1st edition.

I would suggest that if one really feels this should be aired by e-mail, he
follow his own advice.  However, it may be that the fact that he posted his
message to list is a simple blunder on his part.  In spite of the lack of
such tolerance on his part, I am willing to assume this to be the case.

Regarding how well read we are.  I\'m well read on some subjects around
Traveller, but can\'t claimed not to have missed things (though I must say
times where Mr. Rencke-Madsen assumes that, if I don\'t agree with his
interpretations of a rule, then I must be unware of it or too dumb to
understand it are not such times).  The same is _clearly_ also true of Mr.
Rencke-Madsen (regardless of any claims to the contrary).  What I draw the
line at is attempts to attack my intellegence and his arrogant attitude
that if someone doesn\'t agree with him, they must be stupid (see especially
his last message).  I have better things to do than to put up with such
people.  I also found his increasingly sarcastic tone and use of riducule
to attack postions (for example, see his meaningless "disposable nappies"
comments") to be annoying and just symptomatic of a situation where he
couldn\'t come up with a reasonable reply.  I was willing to defend my views
(especially since, IMO, the opposing arguements were getting so weak and
far fetched) had Mr. Rencke-Madsen taken my first complaint to heart and
stopped his tatics.  In any case, stopping a discussion and letting people
take what has been said for what it\'s worth (something I have no problem
with) is more honest than obfuscating the points with tangents and second
rate debating tatics.

A volume filled with locations that are all so far outside of your

OK, first of all, you _aren\'t_ going to detect ships at the range
you describe with the Hubble telescope.  Furthermore, you are
assuming great advances in sensor technology without similar
advances in concealment.  But this is all beside the point
because Traveller detection ranges are given and they
are in only the light-second range (at least in the
original books).

Only if they detect the other ship.  There first clue to it\'s
existance my be the attack on their ship.

This is not a new tatic.  It\'s been used before in the "real world"
and it has the same risks that other approaches do (standard NATO
policy was to sink all those Russian "trawlers" if war broke
out and the russians detain, and sometimes even shoot down,
civilian aircraft in the wrong place).  The chances
of being disabled and captured or the enemy deciding that it\'s
just a ploy and blowing you away (esp. if you are making a habit
of this sort of thing, which you will be if this is your major
approach to intellegence gathering).

I\'m not sure what you want.  The main disagreement, for me at least,
is...Is the presence of ability to send messages through jump
space, in small portable "torpedoes", consistent with the Traveller
background as written?  I would say the answer is no.  That
limited communications is such a fundamental part of Traveller,
that you can\'t make them easier without fundamentally altering
the setting and introducing inconsistencies.

There is also some discussion as to whether the rules can be
interpreted as allowing them and wether the one or two mentions
of them makes them "canon".

Any more detail will just start back in to ground that that
has been gone over too many times.

More appropriately, three should be the process whereby stars such as the
Sun generate energy.  A neutrino is essentially a "garbage" particle that
is a by product of the fusion reaction going on in stellar cores emitted
as two protons squish together to form atom deuterium (hydrogen with a
neutron), a positron, and the neutrino.  Hypothetically, a type I
supernova (or a high solar mass late-stage supergiant) would be an extremely
powerful source of neutrinos, simply because it churns through the fusion
process at a ridiculuous rate.

The Black Globes descriptions suffer from retcons following further
thought.  Initially, someone thought "it doesn\'t emit anything, you
can\'t see it".  Then someone pointed out that it would appear on a
black patch on the sky, so you could detect a black globed ship as it
occults the stars, etc. behind it.  This applies to neutrino and
electromagnetic radiation.  Thus, it should be possible to spot a BG
cloaked ship, but probably more difficult (trying to see a small,
uniform black patch versus trying to see a luminous, varying, ship) -
think how much easier it is to see the sun than the asteroids (not a
good analogy).  I think there must be some sort of background neutrino
flux - I suppose all stars and galaxies must produce some, but then it
wouldn\'t be much different from electromagnetic radiation sources.

Another point that really isn\'t considered is a BG reaction to
gravity.  Somewhere I remember reading "...black globes cut across
all field lines...", which would presumably include gravity.  This
means that not only are BGs undetectable using densitometers, they are
also unaffected by gravity.  However, I\'m fairly sure that there are
references to BG cloaked fleets using gravity-assisted trajectories to
reach there targets (Knightfall?).  Certainly, if such a fleet wanted
to go into orbit, or at least have more than a passing encounter with
a target world, they would have to drop the BG.  Perhaps all this
suggests another consequence of the early descriptions of BGs which
wasn\'t thought of.  I think if a BG cloaked ship shot through a system
without being effected by the system\'s gravity, it would absorb a lot
of energy from the gravity field - result: big bang, or drop the BG.
In my game, I\'ll rule that BGs don\'t block gravity (when one comes
into my campaign), so they can be detected by densitometers - which
are relatively ineffective sensors in my game.  I\'ve just realised
that this means graitic drives will work through BGs - not thrusters,
though.  Perhaps I\'ll think some more about this!

Which folks had (mostly) conceded, but it\'s nice to have more
confirmation.

>2. Ships can jump into a system with a specific desired vector.

This has pretty much *had* to be the case. There are only a few
possibilities:

1. The ship emerges from jump with the same vector it entered jump
   with. This would be consistent with physical laws in that it
   wouldn\'t violate conservation of momentum. But it\'ll play *hell*
   with things, because the velocity difference between star systems
   often runs high enough to significantly affect fuel consumption!

2. The ship emerges at rest with respect to the local star (or whatever
   gravity well popped it out). This has problems too. First, where did
   the momentum go? Second, it affects mobility too, though not as
   drasticly. Plus, what about the case when you have aimed to come out
   of jump well away from anything? What are you at rest with respect
   to *then*?

3. Your exit vector is part of the calculations for the jump. Since
   jump plays hell with physics, this wouldn\'t be much worse, and there
   *are* arguments that can be used to justify "rotating" vectors when
   going through higher dimensions. Explaining how the vector\'s *size*
   changes is harder, but I wouldn\'t bet that it can\'t be justified.
   :-)

#3 does the least damage to canon and background. And if you use it,
you can claim that vector control isn\'t anymore precise than
*positional* control. Which solves a lot of the problems.

>3. Ships can turn their black globes on in jump space!  This is weird.
>What happens?  Do you absorb energy from jump space?  Spoooky...

The section you quote doesn\'t say thaty they rurned on the globe in
jump. Any reason they can\'t turn it on *before* jump? For simplicity,
I\'d say that there\'s nothing *for* it to absorb.

Sure, the globe would block out whatever is behind it. But detecting
*that* is going to be very difficult at any sort of range. Figure out
how small an arc that globe subtends at various distances. An *absence*
of radiation is *very* difficult to detect because of the way sensors
of any sort work. You can detect something emitting photons or
neutrinos even if the "image" on your sensor is so small that it only
covers one detector "element" (think of it like a pixel in reverse).
That\'s possible because the element just has to receive enough energy
to trigger it. It doesn\'t have to *resolve* it.

But trying to detect a *lack* of energy requires that the "image" be
large enough that the blank has a 100% probability of completely
covering a detector element. Otherwise, you pick up the signal from the
adjoining non-blank areas.

Easy. Doing so requires that you come out of jump at a *precise* point
in space, with a *precise* vector. Getting the required precision gets
*harder* as the velocity goes up, because you\'ve got less time to make
course corrections *and* you need more thrust to make the same *angle*
change in the vector.

That\'s why my super-mass-driver is best located *way* the hell out
there. So there\'s *time* for small thrusters to make course
corrections.

As far as I can remember, neutrinos have been detected from
supernovae.  SN1987A was detected in neutrinos before it was in light;
11 altogether!  Actually, they only discovered that they had detected
neutrinos by looking back at their records after it had been seen
optically.

This is also the answer that Marc Miller used to give at CT question and
answer sessions.  As a rough, ballpark estimate the velocity difference
between two nearby star systems should be somewhere above 10 km/sec and
below 100 km/sec for nearby destinations, and increasing as the size of the
jump increases. (are there any astronomers out there who can give me
better figures?).

Given that Classic Traveller uses constant-accelleration drives,
establishing the correct vector before jump involves several hours of
accelleration.  A quick-and-dirty game mechanic might be:

Time spent establishing vector = (1d6 per Jump Number) * 3

The result being in High Guard turns; it hours, it would be (1d6 per Jump)/2
(anywhere from half an hour to eighteen hours).  In many cases, this vector
set-up is subsumed within the voyage from the starport to the jump point;
presumably there would ordinarily be "lanes" for each possible destination
out from the world in directions that help set up a reasonable entry vector
for ships going to those systems.

Actually, #1 is canon, and #3 makes a mess of the idea, put forth in High
Guard, that a fleet can jump in with Black Globes up, and then drift past
the enemy\'s outer defences.  If vectors were randomized (even slightly) by
jumping, this tactic would not work.

I\'m pretty sure that CT explicitly states that #1 (the ship
retains its original vector) is true. I don\'t have my books here, so I
can\'t quote chapter and verse at you, tho. This conservation-of-linear-
momentum rule was written into both CT\'s jump and teleport rules, as I
recall.

< #3 does the least damage to canon and background. And if you use it,
< you can claim that vector control isn\'t anymore precise than

I disagree with you here. If you\'re using CT rules, fuel cost is
neglegible for matching vectors between stars. I believe relative
stellar velocities are on the order of 10 km/s. A free trader could then
match velocities in less than a half-hour for most star systems. The
same thing is true of relative planetary velocity vectors.

If you\'re not using CT rules, then, of course, nothing I\'ve said
will apply. I don\'t know the new rules very well at all.

As I recall, while velocities will be somewhat similar among stars in
close proximity to each other, it isn\'t at all unusual to have a star
that is "just passing through" and thus has a *much* higher relative
velocity.

Better re-read what I said. In #3 I said that the emergence *vector*
can be "chosen" to much the same sort of accuracy as the emergence
*time* or the emergence *location*. Thus the same sort of "shared
calculations" that allow a fleet to emerge at much the same time and
position will also allow them to emerge with much the same vector.

So it doesn\'t make a mess of that.

And in MT, #3 is probably more workable than #1. I don\'t wanna think
about TNE... :-)

Out of the ranges given in the books for *active* sensors. Not out of
real world active and passive sensor ranges. Note that for example, it
is possible for *amateur* radio operators to not only bounce signals
off the moon, but to do so well enough to use it for communications!

With larger gear (well within the size a medium sized ship could carry)
it is possible to *image* Venus! Believe me, detecting a 100 ton or
better ship at interplanetary ranges *is* possible via radar if you
don\'t have an atmosphere in the way.

And passive sensors have ranges just as good. Radio transmissions, IR
signature, both light reflected off the hull, and light emitted by
rockets are all detectable at interplanetary ranges with gear a ship
can carry.

Depends on what you are detecting. The IR signature of a manned ship
*will* be detectable at several AU or else the crew will be dead.
Detecting a 300K object against the 3K background is *easy*. And if the
ship has any kind of powerplant or equipment running, it *must* have
some way of dumping the waste heat. Either you use evaporative cooling,
which leaves you in a pinch when you run out of fluid to evaporate (and
which makes you stick out like a neon sign, as you\'ll look like a baby
comet) or you must use *radiative* cooling. That requires radiator
surfaces that are *much* hotter, and thus stick out even more on an IR
scan.

>Furthermore, you are
>assuming great advances in sensor technology without similar
>advances in concealment.

Nope, I\'m not assuming *any* advances in sensor technologies. Just that
you have clear space to use them in and cheap transport to carry them
in.

While the Palomar scope isn\'t suited for mounting in a "scout" vessel,
something along the lines of the Multiple Mirror Telescope *is*.
(half a dozen 1 meter mirrors, computer synchronized). Get that outside
the atmosphere, and float it on a tether, to isolate it from vibrations
on the ship, and you\'ll be able to *image* ships.

Making several hundred meter "inflatable" dishs for radio/radar
observation is easy. And those will give you quite a bit of detection
without using them actively. They, unlike the optical scope, are cheap
enough to discard rather than recover.

As for advances in concealment, you are up against the hard limits set
by physics. Especially with regards to IR.

First, lets look at passive radio/radar. You can maintain
communications silence. But that gets impractical for any ships
manuevering near each other. And please note that radio transmissions
from handheld units like walkie-talkies and cell phones are *known* to
be capable of being picked up by current surveilance satellites.
Without an ionosphere in the way, and without much in the way of nearby
radio noise, ship-borne sensors will be better. And if you use radar
for navigational purposes, that\'s detectable at interplanetary
distances.

Active radar is definitely capable of detecting ships at a mere 20 AU.
And given that it takes several hours for the signals to make the round
trip, it might even be worth doing, even tough it screams "here I am"
to the whole system. After all, the odds of another ship being within
12 hours of you are damn slim, and if they *are*, you\'ll likely know
about it.

Radar "stealth" has definite limits. There are only *three* principles
used:

1. reflect the beam off in another direction.
2. absorb the beam
3. Be transparent to the beam.

#3 is *not* available to a ship in Traveller. If nothing else, the
fusion plant can\'t be transparent to radar!

#2 requires either a black globe, or knowing in advance what
frequencies you want to absorb (it\'s done with quarter wave coatings).

#1 is the main method used on the stealth fighter and bomber. Thus the
use of *flat* suraces, and the angling of them. The problem is, this
requires that you know what direction the radar is looking at you from.

They stick out like a sore thumb if the radar is *below* them, and
show up fairly well from more or less overhead. Y\'see, the flat surface
relects the beam off at an angle. Unless it\'s coming pretty much dead
on to the surface. So you have to avoid "concave" areas, and you want
to try not to have too *large* an area facing any given direction. You
don\'t want to have too *many* areas though, as the smaller areas will
act like a larger *curved* area, especially if longer wavelength radars
are used. So you can minimize radar return from the front. And even reduce it
from the sides. But you can\'t *eliminate* it.

Now, lets consider visible light. Sure, you can paint the ship black.
But the best black coating known only absorb about 90% of the light.
Nature manages to get that up to 99% (or so) on carbonaceus chondritic
bodies, and with soot. But let\'s ignore that.

So you have a 100% absorbtive coating. Great. That means that at 1 AU
from a G-type star you are absorbing *kilowatts* of light on every
square meter of the starward side of the ship. That becomes *heat*.
Which you have to get rid of somehow. That\'s why the Shuttle is painted
*white*, to reduce the load on the cooling systems. In case you didn\'t
know, once in orbit they open the cargo bay because the *entire* inner
surface of the doors is covered with heat radiators!

Now we get to IR. The outside temperature of the ship *must* be the
same as the inside temperature. If it isn\'t, then you are doing
something to "pump" the heat out of the hull and into something else.
Problem is, the higher the temperature difference, the harder it is to
increase it. And the pumping process generates heat also. So, you can\'t
just pump it into some sort of internal heat sink except for short
periods. You can dump it into a liquid and then allow some of the
liquid to evaporate into space. That will cool you, but the increased
gas density near you *will* make you more noticeable. Or you can pump
it into a "radiator" to radiate excess heat into space. That will
*really* make you stand out!

IR is the main problem. In IR your ship is going to be *much* brighter
than any natural object unless you are in *close* to the star, and have
the systems shut down so they don\'t generate excess heat. And then, you
are going to fry the crew....

So, a ship is any "bright" IR signal or any "normal" IR signal that is
moving "too fast" (which you *will* be doing unless you want to take
*years* to get around).

You can reduce your radar signature, but again, if you give the return
of a small rock, but are moving with a speed or orbit that says "ship",
you are still "busted".

>But this is all beside the point
>because Traveller detection ranges are given and they

And they are patently *wrong*. It\'s one thing for the rules to say that
it\'s possible to do things we don\'t think are possible (like go FTL).
It\'s quite another case when they say it\'s *impossible* to do things we
*know* are possible.

Detection good enough for a *target lock* or with "normal" sensors I
can buy. But not with the sort of stuff you stick into a vessel
intended to scout a system.

Figure it out. If we can image a planet at multiple parsecs, we can
image a ship at a few AU.

Maybe. But it\'s pretty darned unlikely. In fact, that\'s one of the
arguments for going ahead and using radar. That way you *know* you are
going to see anybody coming. To get surprised then, they\'d have to be
within laser range when you started up the radar.

On the other hand, even the Russians let ships from other countries
into their ports.

For what it is worth, there\'s even a fair chance that a single ship
jumping in, not making any threatening moves and then jumping out will
be "left alone" much of the time. Consider that while the Germans and
Japanese did shoot at the planes sent in to check the weather over
tasrget areas, they didn\'t waste a lot of shells on them and almost
*never* sent up fighters. It wasn\'t worth the effort. It made more
sense to save fuel and ammunition to use against attacks.

I used to know a guy who\'d been navigator on a B-29 and his plane had
been making weather flights over Japan at the end of the war. One
interesting item is that it was pretty much a "milk run". Until August
6th, 1945. After that they got everthing but the kitchen sink thrown at
them.

So unless a single ship is a serious danger, I don\'t think it\'s going
to be in much danger. While I don\'t agree with you that it can\'t detect
much unless its on top of things, I do concede that it can\'t find
everything. And that being closer is better. But given that it\'ll be
at least a week before the enemy can use the info the ship gathers, I
rather expect that it\'ll get some lasers and masers aimed at it to try
to "blind" it (which *is* semi effective at long ranges) and maybe even
have some missiles or the like fired at it if it\'s close enough. But
nobody is going to really expect it to be hurt unless it gets unlucky.

Sounds reasonable from what I know.  (Amateur astronomer, only!)

Near the Sun, the "local standard of rest", or average orbital speed of
all stars around the Galaxy, is 200 km/s.  The Sun is moving somewhat
faster than average -- 20 km/s toward Lambda Herculis; this breaks down
roughly into 14 km/s to spinward, 10 km/s to coreward, and 7 km/s to
galactic north ("upward").  (_Guide to the Galaxy_, Henbest & Couper.)

Mean orbital speed of the Earth is 29.8 km/s, but this can either add or
subtract from the vector depending on the time of year, and relative
angle of the world orbits to each other.  Likewise, the departure world
will have a vector that will affect the calculation as well.

This shouldn\'t be a problem even for limited-fuel starships from TNE.
Acceleration at one gee for one hour achieves a velocity of just over
35 km/s from a standing start.  That\'s two G-turns, in TNE.

I once converted the radial velocities of stars within 20 light-
years of Earth (slightly more than Jump-6) to the Brilliant Lances
scale. While this skews the numbers low because it ignores
transverse motion, I think it gives a good sense of the actual
scale of the problem.

Since this is X-Boat, I\'ll remind/inform folks that the BL scale is
half-hour turns over 30,000 km hexes. 1G of thrust over 1 turn
produces a 1 hex change in vector.

The actual information is on a piece of paper *somewhere*, and I
still have it, but can\'t find it right now, so I\'m going by memory.
Please forgive the lack of detail:

Out of around 100 stars, the fastest moved at a speed of 15
(only one star), the next at around 9 (again, one star).
About 70-80% had a speed less than 4.

I think your numbers are a little high, but more importantly you\'re not
taking the ship\'s thrust rating into account. A Rampart (M-6) launched
immediately after jump breakout from an AHL (M-2) will correct its vector
long before its mothership does.

It tacks a few hours (at most) onto transit time, and clever navigators
will try to breakout from jump so that residual V works for them, moving
them towards the destination. In most situations, GM\'s can ignore
this extra (or reduced) time -- it isn\'t important.

I find that I owe Mr. Summers a public apology. When I read the previous
X-boat digest just now and saw that I had inadvertently sent my private
reply to him to the list instead, I could feel myself blush. I wouldn\'t
blame him if he had thought that I had done so deliberately. I certainly
would have at least suspected someone else of trying be \'cute\' in similar
circumstances. I very much appreciate that he does assume that it was an
accident, and assure you all that it was. Regardless, I should have been
more careful with a message that contained such a personal attack and I
do apologize both to him and to any of the rest of you who may have wasted
time reading it.

My take is slightly different. I think that jump torpedoes could be
disruptive unless some additional assumptions about their cost and
reliability are made, but that such assumptions as are necessary to
keep them in line are quite plausible.

Secondly, I maintain that the CT/MT rules _as they stand_ alows a type of
jump torpedo that dosen\'t even violate the 100 T jump field restriction.
Basically it consists of a jump drive surrounded my a collapsible frame-
work holding the jump net. The contraption is energized from outside and
uses the same grace period that drop tanks do to get far enough away from
the ship not to interfere with jump field.

I do admit that this makes trouble for the background, since I see no
reason why ships can\'t be energized the same way, but I can\'t come up
with a plausible restriction that will disallow this and still allow
drop tanks.

Just to be clear, my objections resolve around the fact that j-torps
make communications cheaper and make the commitiment of men and ships
unnecessary.  Not that they make communications faster (except to
the degree that people who couldn\'t afford j-6 communications can
no do so, though is significant too).

Well, I\'m a hard science boffin when it comes to planetary systems, but I
see your point. However, I\'m also a gamemaster, so I\'ll explain how I
actually use it. First, though, I\'ll point out all this "hard science
stuff"
is mostly from (black) Book 6: Scouts (copyright 1983), with elaborations
by DGP in Grand Survey, both CT products.

The use is for fleshing out both the mainworld and the rest of the system.
The extended system data is one of the tools I use to give my players
a sense of travelling to a _place_ rather than to the "faceless NPC planet"

that can result from going by the UWP alone.

I also think that software that makes it _easier_ to incorporate (and,
above
all, USE) more system data is what will take it out of the hands of the
boffins, who at present are the ones willing to slog through everything
with paper, pencil, and calculator. I\'d _love_ to have it more user-
friendly.

And some things I wasn\'t boffin enough to do, like keep track of
the relative positions and distances to other planets (important for
GG refueling and visiting off-the-mainworld colonies), or keep track
of planetary seasons (so I know when it\'s the middle of winter at the
starport the PCs are going to). These things let me add detail and
color without always having to do so arbitrarily.

Actually, a "detailed planet and star system" is probably another
program in its own right. However, I would like a sector-level
program like the one you are working on to be able to have
a detailed system program as an add-on, and to work with the
data therein (like calling up all the UWPs for all the inhabited
worlds in a system, not just the mainworld).

Good. This is one of the things that mapping software is _for_.


Now for my own request, which has to do with how the data is
displayed. I\'m tired of maps that go where the grid is instead of
where the planets are. I\'m tired of "the universe stopping at the
edge of the map." I want software that will USE the capabilities
of a computer to overcome this better than I can with a pencil
and custom-made hexmap. Therefore, I want:

1) a floating map. I want to click on Extolay/Lanth, hit \'Center\'
          or something, and SEE that it connects branches of the
          Spinward Main into Vilis and Regina subsectors, and that
          two parsecs away in Jewell subsector is a planet people
          and goods might want to go to. I _don\'t_ want a map of
          just Lanth subsector.

2) the capability to vary the size of the map. Sometimes a slightly
          larger map suits my needs, and I\'d like to make it 10x12, or
          16x20 instead of 8x10 parsecs. Same on the small side.

3) to answer the question: "What if I do (1) and/or (2) and the map
          extends into another sector?" Or up to three other sectors
          if you\'re at one of the corners. I want to be able to map
          data from more than one sector at once, since planets at the
          edge of the map shouldn\'t arbitrarily be cut off from worlds
          only one parsec away just because they\'re on the wrong side
          of the sector border.

Would it be that hard to assign sectors some sort of "supercoordinate"
to tell the program where the sectors relate to each other, so then it
can do the mapping job? And a grey blotch labelled "Data Not
Available" showing up on the map if, perchance, the data is NOT
available.

-> Charles was wondering about neutrino backgrounds.

There is a 2.1 K cosmological background in neutrinos (the neutrino
version of the cosmic microwave background). It is hopeless to try to
detect it now, but since these 57th century guys have neutrino
detectors so good to see the shape of an object from neutrino scattering
they must be able to detect the cosmological background.
Of course the cosmological background is superimposed to the stellar
sources, supernovae etc that were already mentioned.

One thing I am missing is why should one want to find black globes
using the neutrino background rather than the visible background.

-> David believes HST cannot detect starships.

oh my, better not tell NASA about this... I believe it all depends on
your assumptions about emissivity. I have done a little excercise
using the wfpc2 simulator.
Suppose you know approximately where to look (ie you had a successful
scan). Consider a 500 MW starship with 99 per cent
efficiency. The one per cent lost to heat is radiated away with heat
exchangers operating at 1500 Kelvin (on the Starship\'s operator
manual it is stated that thruster plates are optically bright when
operating, so my heat exchanger could just be the thruster). About
one per cent of the flux would be emitted in the waveband of the broad
WFPC2 visible filter ie 50 KW. At one astronomical unit this is
about 5E-19 W/m^2. With one hour exposure with WFPC2 and the visible
filter one can see with a reasonable signal to noise sources down
to 4E-19 W/m^2. Therefore this 500 MW starship would be visible only
down to 1 AU.
Of course under the same assumptions a 5,000,000 MW battleship
could be detected at 100 AU.

With the Advanced Camera supposed to fly in 1999 the sensitivity
will increase by a factor 4. In addition improvements in Near IR
detectors should allow one to operate at more convenient wavelengths
for the detection of thermal emission.

Summarizing I believe that a very extensive masking will be necessary
to hide a battleship to this pinpoint kind of detection. Simply cooling
down the exhaust would not be enough. NICMOS flying in 1997 can observe
down to 2.3 microns and will be probably able to detect cooler emissions.
The best option (apart from a black globe) is to increase the efficiency
even further. An efficiency 1 starship emitting only black body
radiation at say 300 K would be very hard to detect.

To find something not knowing the approximate direction is another business.
The field of view of all the instruments I have mentioned are ludicrously
small compared to the full sky. For some applications one does not need
the full sky, though. For instance we could build now a battery of HSTs
dedicated full time to monitor solar system planets. Any Vilani
dreadnought approching one of the planets would immediately be detected.

Without any preferential direction one faces the big factor 10^-9 which
is roughly the ratio of the WFPC2 field of view over the whole sky.
Obviously one would have to design a special purpose instrument on
a special purpose telescope. With a 4000*4000 pixels 0.25 arcsec in size
one could cover 2 *10^-6 of the sky with a single shot. Increasing too
much the pixel size would not help you since the objects you are looking
for are fainter than many stars. One would end up having something in
every single pixel. Summarizing I believe that either a real world scan
would take days or a scan would be much less sensitive than a pinpoint.

Needless to say, TNE starships without thrusters would be detected MUCH
more easily.

First of all, in Classic Traveller, detection ranges are explicitally
desribed as being in the light second range.  Even in MegaTraveller,
where there are passibe sensors with "interplanetary" range the ship
comat system give range modifiers that mean you aren\'t going to
detect a ship in much past the light-second range (presumably the
range on the sensor is how far you can detect "something" regardless
of whether ships are detecible.)

Ragarding the moon, that is a totally differnt situation.  The moon
is a _lot_ larger than a ship, it isn\'t actively designed to not
be detected, and we already know where it is.  Right now we can\'t
detect ships at the ranges proposed.  Now we can argue about the
effect of technology on the ability to detect vs remaining hidden,
but the fact is that, in Traveller, detection ranges are in the
light second range.

[this was moved because it touches on the subject just mentioned.]
>>But this is all beside the point

The main point is that jump-torps violate the Traveller background.
Having to agrue that that background is wrong (which I don\'t agree with,
see above and below) hardly supports the proposition that they are
compatible with the exisiting background.

>With larger gear (well within the size a medium sized ship could carry)

Assuming a larger portion of the ship is allocated to sensors than
the rules give.

Maybe is you launched a huge array of multiple radio telescopes into
orbit (though a ship could never carry that).  The fact is that
we aren\'t able to image Venus from the Earth with any radar
equipement currently avialable.  In any case, how far you can
detect planets has little bearing on detecting ships.

Not according to the rules and not possible today either.

Not true.  You don\'t need to dump heat isotropically.  You just
need to know _one_ direction the enemy isn\'t in and you can
dump the heat that direction.

Also, with active cooling, you can select the wavelength of the
energy you emit so that it is in the radio/micro waver region
that the univers emits (regardless of the actual black body
temp of the ship).

Also, it\'s not a 3K background either.  There are a lot of stars and the
amount of energy, at 1 AU distance, that you detect from a starship is
less than the nearby stars in your part of the galaxy (we had this
discussion in the GURPS list and I did the cacl).  What you are
trying to do is pick out one point buried in a mess of other ones
(sort of like picking out one grain of sand in a beach).

Furthermore, if you are trying to scout out a planet, you are going
to have to be able to detect ships against the background of the
planet (either a terrestial planet, which is likely reflecting energy
and emitting in the 300K+ range or, even worse, a jovian planet
that is generating and emitting it\'s own energy).

First of all, what you are talking about in terms of space is something
that is so much more than what Traveller gives for ships as to
seriously weaken them.  Besides, you aren\'t going to be able to
detect something the size of a Traveller ship with the telescope
you describe at 1 AU (except, _maybe_ with a year or two of
observation), let along "image it".

[A lot of discussion about what we can do now, that I really don\'t have

can\'t make inflatable radio dishes).  b) even disregarding"a" he

Good examplse of ignoring advances in concealment technologies, you are only
willing to consider ways to absorb energy that we have now.

They don\'t let them wander in and leave when they want.  If you
show up you better stop and get properly identified.  And that
is during peacetime.

OK, so jumping into a system is "safe" because they are only
going to "attack you some"?  (and that is for a ship that
is not going near important areas, not a situation a spy
ship is going to be in).

And, on the other hand, planes that spied on military targets were

Interestingly, stars that have such paths have lower metallicity
and are less likely to have planets (based on my understanding,
I don\'t "work on stars").

Excerpt from the MegaTraveller Journal #1, Q&A, p. 24:

"When a group of starships know they have to arrive in unison, they =

sharing jump vector computations. This leads to a much more accureta =
jump exit at the other end, with the error dropping significantly.
  The formula in the _Starship Operator\'s Manual_ for normal jumpspace =
exit is:

  124 hrs + (2D x 6 hrs)
  yielding a result of 136 - 196 hours
    (that is, 5.7 to 8.2 days)

  If double the jump preparation time is spent with all the affected =

formula instead:

  167 hours + (2D x 0.1 hr)

OK, that sounds like I need to (approximately) halve my results, and remove
some of the variation by distance.  How about does what\'s below look to
you?  It should produce results that average around BL Speed 4 to 6 (for
Jump-5+ trips), with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 9.  This is still a
little high, but puts the top end better under control.  Did your figures
include the orbital velocities of the origin and destination planets, by the
way?

> I think your numbers are a little high, but more importantly you\'re not
> taking the ship\'s thrust rating into account.

You\'re right; I was trying to convert from BL to CT on the fly; those
numbers would be for a 1G ship; divide the result by the ship\'s maneuver
rating to find the actual figures (ie: divide the time by 6 for a maneuver-6
Rampart RF-128, or by 2 for a Azhanti High Lightning class cruiser).

Here\'s a different formula to use:
    Brilliant Lances Speed = (2d6 + Jump Number) / 2
    Hours Spent = Brilliant Lances Speed / (2 * M-Drive Rating)
    High Guard Turns Spent = Brilliant Lances Speed * 3 / M-Drive Rating

If you\'re computing the duration in High Guard Turns, remember to retain
fraction until the final computiation, but round the humber of turns to the
nearest whole number (that is, round 1/2 or more up, and less than 1/2 rounds
down).

Furthermore, I forgot to note that a ship can perform the vector matching on
the way INbound from the jump point in the destination system, as well as
OUTbound to the jump point in the originating system.  In actual practice,
ships probably perform part of the vector correction in both legs of the
journey before and after jump, so that (under normal operations), there\'s
little additional time that has to be spent matching vectors.

The main time it\'s important is when you _have_ to establish a certain (or
unusual) vector on entry - like for the jump-with-the-black-globe cloaking
trick.

Yes, it does.  Here\'s why:

Even though the entire fleet emerges all together, if their vector has been
randomized (even if it has been randomized the same way for every ship in
the fleet), the fleet will not go where planned.

The tactic mentioned in High Guard was that a fleet would jump together,
emerge from jumpspace with black globes up, and drift past the enemy\'s outer
defences, to "uncloak" and engage the target.

If the fleet\'s vector is unpredictable on exit from jumpspace (even just a
little bit), the fleet may de-cloak to find itself considerably off course,
and nowhere near the target!  Think about it - if the fleet were planning to
attack an enemy\'s naval depot, they could very well collide with it, instead
of be in position to attack it, or instead of drifting past the enemy\'s
defenses, they may drift right into the thick of them.

Randomizing the exit vector makes the entire tactic pointless - you can\'t
tell where you\'re going, and you can\'t see out (because the globe screen
blocks your sensors as effectively as it does the enemy\'s).

It\'s not much of a problem, even for T:TNE ships and their
limited-accelleration drives.  Even a "worst-case" scenario (two planets in
opposition, for a vector difference of +60km/sec, and differing stellar
speeds on the order of +40km/sec) gives us about 100km/sec speed difference,
or not quite 6 G-Turns of thrust (an hour and a half).  This is around 20%
of the maneuver fuel that even the most limited T:TNE design carries.

And this range of values is what my (updated, thanks to better numbers from
some other members of the XBOAT list - thank you, John!) formula provides.
The new formula (posted recently to the list) is BL speed = (2d6 + Jump) / 2

I think if you actually look at the reference that\'s being discussed,
they do mean the visible/IR background and not the neutrino background.

Those assumptions are the key problem.  See below.

First of all, and most imporantly, my point is that the kind of ships
we make now are not detectable by the HST.  If you want to talk about
how Traveller ships put out more energy, you also have to talk about
what measures technology allows that ship to use to make itself
harder to detect.

However, even if we ignore the above, you aren\'t correct.  (These
are mostly points I covered in my earlier message.)
-First you really have no basis for heat exchangers operating at 1500 K.
You can control the temp of heat exchangers by design.
-Your assumption that even 1% of the energy is in the visible is based
entirely on the 1500K figure.
-You also assume that the energy is radiated in all directions.  Even a
simple measure of putting heat exchangers in back of the ship would prevent
detection from the HST.
-You numbers also assume to a ship with the powerplant operating at full,
if it is sitting still waiting for a ship to come by (like a scout ship)
then the real number will be a fraction of the number you mention.
-Additionally, unless you already know where the ship is, the odds that you
will have the telescope fixed on the ship for an hour are miniscule.

>Summarizing I believe that a very extensive masking will be necessary
>to hide a battleship to this pinpoint kind of detection.

But the point is that Traveller ships have extensive masking.  You
can\'t detect current ships at 1 AU with the HST.  You can\'t detect
Traveller ships.  Maybe you could detect a Traveller ship with
all concealment technology removed and additionally forcing it
to use 1500K cooling and forcing it to distribute that cooling
isotropically, but that is a rather pointless exercise.

Aside from the fact the cooling is only one aspect to not being able
to detect the ships, and that the original message refered to visible
telescopes, the fact remains that this is only an assumption not
backed up with any figures.

With hour exposures, you are still going to have to fix the telescope on
the ship.

Very true, I had forgetten about that. Obviously, I\'m a little rusty too
(especially when it comes to astrophysics, I mostly work on cyclotrons
these days.) Fortunately, I covered myself with the word "Almost!" 8^)

Actually, what I was thinking of when I stuck the word "almost" in front
of "all neutrinos" was the beta decay of many radio-isotopes. Neutrinos
were originally "invented" by E. Fermi who tried to explain beta decay
while maintaining conservation of energy.

I\'m not sure whether a neutrino as a natural decay product has ever been
observed in the laboratory. But it occurs to me that many planets (well,
the Earth anyway) have gigatons of radioactive ores in them, and that
such a planet will outshine any starship\'s powerplant in the neutrino
spectrum.

What do you suppose the angular resolution of a neutrino detector is? ...

Of course, most planets will outshine (or at least out-reflect) a
starship throughout the EM spectrum as well.

Food for thought.

 I can\'t give a full cite now, due to a motivational deficiency, but it was

First of all we do not see current ships with HST because none of them
has power in excess of 500 MW.

Before attempting a rebuttal I would like to stress that already in
my message I had admitted that finding where to look is the real problem.
So at least on that David agrees with me..We also agree that if the
ship is not using its power is not detected.

My assumption on the presence of relatively warm/hot points derives partly
from the Starship Op. Manual (e.g. the pag. 3 blurb on the blue glow,
although not very convincing) but partly on some simple argument which
should apply also in the 57th century.

The heat you can radiate depends on the surface of the radiators and
their temperature. You cannot convert your excess heat into a laser beam
and point it somewhere because of the way thermodynamics works.

So take your 200 tons ship, it has a volume of 2700 m^3 and a surface of
at least about 1000 m^2 (if it is close to a sphere) or more.
Take 2000 m^2 as rough estimate.
An order of magnitude estimate tells you that the ship can radiate through
the whole surface at 100 K. If you reduce the radiator surface the
temperature has to go up (although only as 1 over the fourth root of the
surface). 100K would save it from  detection from the current HST
but may not save it from the NICMOS equipped one. Of course one
can avoid using power, and than of course is not detected. One can
also emit in some other direction, except that to know where not to emit
your ship has  to detect HST...if in a system there are a few HSTs at
various location not all of them will be looking away. In any case the
directionality of radiators is obviously an important factor
in spoiling a detection.

What about battleships? if you have a 2Mton battleship rather than
a 200 tons ship the power will go up at least by a factor 10,000 but
the surface (for a given geometry) will only go up by 10,000^(2/3)
ie roughly 220 times. Thus the temperature will have to raise by
roughly 2.5. Now 250 K is not a bad temperature for IR detectors.

It seems to me that the detectability of a battleship on, say,
Jupiter remains a possibility.

             Cheers,
                 Massimo

    'body' => 'Hi All. I was recently contemplating creating yet another set of space
combat rules.  In the past, one of the things I\'ve come up against is the
problem of large numbers of weapons on ships.  A 100 000 ton battleship
can potentially have 3000 weapons on it.  In HG, this problem is partially
solved by forcing the designer to put weapons into batteries (though you
can still end up with scores of batteries, which is a drag).  This is an
adequate solution, but a bit cludgy in my opinion.  If I want to have 3000
factor-1 beam weapons, I should be allowed to, dammit!  :-)

So, to solve this problem, I\'ve come up with the following tables.  They
are based on something I saw in Dragon magazine many years ago.  They
allow the resolution of many rolls with a single roll.  The title of each
table indicates the number of rolls you are resolving.  To resolve the
rolls, just figure out your target (with total DMs subtracted) and
cross ref with a 1d20 roll down the side.  The body of the table shows the
number of successes/hits/whatever. I\'ve included tables for resolving
groups of 10 and 50 rolls.  I will be creating tables for 5 and 20 rolls
as well, but I didn\'t include them because I didn\'t want this post to be
_too_ long.  Tables for numbers of rolls above 50 are kind of pointless.
The distributions become pretty stable and normalized after 30.  If you
want to resolve 100 rolls, just roll on the 50 roll table and double it.
A set of 500 rolls can be resolved by multiplying by 10, etc.

Okay, here are the infamous tables, already:

These can be useful for a number of things.  For example, consider a group
of 60 Zhodani Elite Troops firing FGMP\'s at your ship (eek!).  To figure
out how many hit, take their target (e.g. 4+) and cross-ref with a roll of
1d20 down the side of the 50 ROLLS table.  Then do the same for the 10
ROLLS table.  Add the two obtained values together, and voila, you\'ve got the
number of hits.  With tables for 5, 10, 20, and 50 rolls, just about any
number of 2D6 rolls can be resolved with 5 or fewer 1d20 rolls.  Example:
273 rolls requires one roll on table of 50 (multiply by 5), one roll on
table of 20, and (if you want to be anal) 3 normal 2d6 rolls.  3130 rolls
requires one roll on table of 50 (multiply by 62), one roll on table of
20, and one roll on table of 10.  On the other hand, for really big
numbers like this, you can just take the average number of hits.

If anyone wants an explanation as to how I came up with these tables, I
can send them one, I just figured most people on the list wouldn\'t want to
listen to my statistical babbling.  For those of you who are stats-savvy,
I should briefly mention that the distributions of results in the tables
are based on binomial distributions, but are somewhat leptokurtic (ooh, a
10$ word!) due to rounding.  This means that the results using them will
tend slightly more towards the average than they would if you actually
rolled all the rolls separately.

Yikes, this has gotten longer than I intended!

I welcome any comments or criticisms (i.e., let me know if I screwed up the
math! :-), and hope people find this useful.

it is true that nicmos has not flown yet and therefore one does not

if the exhaust is cooler given that the energy to be radiated is the

IR detector with the same quantum efficiency of WFPC2. Since IR detectors
have a bit lower QE, I guess we just have to wait to see which way it goes.

Another effect that would spoil a detection (I do not remember David
mentioning it so I will confess before he catches me!) is that if the not
too well masked ship I had considered is moving at high transversal velocity
it is not detected since the  signal is spread along a long track and the
signal to noise ratio decreases.
At 1 AU the limiting transversal velocity I had assumed was 30 km/s.

My point was that we can\'t use current equipement (HST) to detect current
ships.  If you want to talk about Traveller ships, you have to talk about
_all_ the technology they have.  We don\'t have currently ships with 500 MW
powerplants, but they also don\'t have Traveller concealment technology.
You can\'t have it both ways.

Actually this cover the point that I was trying to make.  Someone
coming into a system has to deal with both of these, making (for those
reasons and others) jumping into a system to spy on it a risking venture.

I don\'t have the book in question, but my understanding is that those
things in back, that look like engines, are the exaust for the Power
Plant.  That would say that, even on unconcealed ships, they energy
is "in back".

Um no, you can\'t do it without having to put more energy in.  But you can
do it.  All that means is that your laser has to put out the energy you
want to loose and more.  Furthermore, you can also take the approach
of reducing wavelength (apparent temperature of you cooling) so that
it lies in the cosmic background (or is at a wavelength were it
will be absorbed) without having to add energy.

You can also "cool" the emmision to below the IR.

>You can also "cool" the emmision to below the IR.

I assume you mean change the emission frequency to below that of IR,
which means radio.  It can still be detected; if you can build
technology to emit at a given frequency, you can build it to detect at
that wavelength.  The point then isn\'t if it is physically impossible
to detect a ship, but is it possible for that ship to direct it\'s
waste emission in a specific direction.  I think I saw a laser beam
thing suggested, or radiators "around the back".  Regardless, you need
to get x amount of energy out, so if you go to lower frequency (lower
energy photons) then you need more photons.  If enough energy is
emitted, won\'t this result in significant scatter?  Even in the
"vacuum" of space, there is sufficient hydrogen to cause scattering,
provided the scattered source is strong enough, and the detector
sensitive enough.  A laser (or maser in radio) would appear as a
straight line, pointing back to the source.  Also, a l/maser would
spread out over distance, increasing the posibility of "illuminating"
other objects in space (planet, moons, asteroids, other spaceships,
dust, gas...) which could be detected and picked up.  If it is
possible to detect a given energy flux, then all you can do is make it
harder to see.  I guess we could argue till the Doomsday Comet falls
on our head about ability to make detection difficult vs ability to
cope with detection-avoidance.  It all depends on who spends the most
resources in the right way.

No, david, the thruster plates themselves generate a blue-white light, as
well as some other (trivial) radiation. Drive Cooling for the PP is
separate.

But you still have to be able to convert from heat into useable energy,
which, as far as I know, always requires a thermal differential of some
kind. Heat is inefficient. Entropy is efficient. Sensors will improve.
Moreso than the Stealth methods... Current stealth methods are 1960\'s tech,
and a smart, well trained operator can detect the stealth bomber at beyond
the range of the carried weapons... but the signal return is small. In an
atmosphere, a tiny radar sig is nothing of note (Large birds or flocks
often show on radars), whereas in space, ANY sig you get is important.

As for detection, it is easy enough for a world to have a synthetic
aperature radar in geosynch orbit, thus giving quite a range of detection.
By careful setup on the array, for a few hundred million, a sensor suite
can be set up to detect anything within 1 AU, under the MT design
sequences, per station. Now, add compuiting, and you\'ve a synthetic
aperature of a few 1000\'s of km. you\'ll catch anything in strike range, of
probably 2m or larger. You\'ll have data on any large force in system. You
set up a constant monitor for Jump Flash. And a star system becomes much
smaller place.

Unfortunately, the only Traveller technology that can help is black
globes. The laws of thermodynamics *require* that the energy leave in
certain ways *or* stay put. Staying put raises the temp of the ship,
thus requiring even *more* heat be gotten rid of.

No. You misunderstand. The laser can pump out *energy*, but it can\'t
pump out *heat*. The laser energy is highly organized (very low
entropy). Heat is the exact opposite (high entropy). Any heat you
managed to get "into" the laser beam would be insignificant next to the
heat *generated* in the process. It\'s thermodynamically *impossible*.


>Furthermore, you can also take the approach
>of reducing wavelength (apparent temperature of you cooling) so that
>it lies in the cosmic background (or is at a wavelength were it
>will be absorbed) without having to add energy.

Again, no. You *can\'t* have a radiating surface at a temp lower than
cosmic background, because it is *also* an *absorbing* surface. And if
it is cooler than the 3K background, it will *absorb* heat rather than
radiate it.

Furthermore, if you *did* get it to 3k, that means that all the rest of
the ship would have to be at that temperature. People don\'yt work well
at thet temp.

The temperature of a radiating surface depends on the rate at which
energy is radiated, and upon the *area* of the surface. The watts/meter
is *directly* related to temperature. That sets the wavelength. Period.

The areas of the ship that have life support are going to be at 300k.
The engineering areas are going to be *hotter* unless you have a good
radiator system. And that means that the radiators are going to be
*hotter*.

If you want to get rid of 500 MW at 3k, you are going to need square
*kilometers* of radiating area. Maybe more.

The hard facts are that any reasonably efficient ship design is going
to radiate IR *strongly*. At 300k from the crew areas, and more from
the engineering spaces. Any attempts to keep them from radiating just
mean that you have to pump the heat to somewhere else. And that
somewhere else is going to be *much* hotter, and therefore stand out
even more.

And the lower the temperature of the radiating suraces, the less
efficiently they\'ll get rid of heat. At 3k, they *can\'t* get rid of
heat. At 300k, they\'ll get rid of it slowly.

It is possible to work out how many watts/meter^2 will be radiated at a
given temperature assuming that the radiator is perfect using the
Stefan-Boltzmann equation. Unfortunately, that book is in storage.
However, the formulas required should be in both book 6, and in World
Builder\'s handbook as part of the calcs for determining the equilibrium
temp of a planet.

Dig them out and work the calcs. You\'ll find that you have a choice
between a small *hot* radiator, and a very, very large cool one.

Don\'t forget that your ship will be absorbing light and heat from the
star, so if it uses *no* power (and has no living creatures onboard) it
will be at the "equilibrium temp" for its distance from the star (if
it\'s moving slowly enough to reach equilibrium).

If there are people or power systems aboard, the will be creating waste
heat, which means the ship will be warmer than a natural object. You
*cannot* prevent this. Period.

You *can* re-distribute it. But that means that to cool part of the
hull, you\'ll have to make the rest hotter. That\'s your radiator. You\'ll
run into two limits. First, your radiator *has* to be below the melting
temp. (unless you use a liquid drop radiator, but that doesn\'t work
well on ships that accelerate at more than a small fraction of a gee).
Second, the bigger the difference in temp between the radiator and the
rest of the ship, the *harder* it is to pump heat into it. There *will*
be a point of diminishing returns.

Even with Traveller tech, the point of diminishing returns is likely to
be such that you\'ll need a fairly large radaitor surface and it\'ll be
at a temp that\'ll stand out like a neon sign.

If you want a contemporary example, check out what Russian radar
satellites look like in the IR. They use a nuclear reactor and they
stick out like a sore thumb on even crude IR surveys.

To summarize:

  Traveller is slated to make it\'s triumphant return in August of 1996, just
in time for GenCon! Far Future Enterprises owns the rights to Traveller
itself; Imperium Games has the paper publishing rights.
   The system is, as has been stated, a return to Classic Traveller at it\'s
base, but with numerous improvements and enhancements. They\'ll be adding to
character generation, adding skills, and a whole new look.
   Lester Smith (of 2300 AD fame) will be Traveller Developer.
   Larry Elmore will be doing the black-and-white interior artwork.
   Greg Porter (of BTRC and GUNS, GUNS, GUNS fame) will be developer of
equipment.
   Don Perrin (from MagForce 7) will be in charge of developing spacecraft.
   Tim Brown (of long-ago GDW fame) will be the main developer of Aliens.
   Jean Rabe (formerly of RPGA) will be the editor of the new Journal of the
Traveller\'s Aid Society, starting from where the GDW numbering of JTAS (not
Challenge) left off.
   More system stuff: no dying during creation. More skills will be offered,
as well as chances to develop your personal background.
   Everything can be rolled OR chosen. More control over character creation.
   The task system from MT will be used.
   Background packages allow more skills at start, even if you\'re a kid!
   Format for all books will be 8.5" by 11"
   The name of the system: TRAVELLER.
   The new game\'s initial setting: year Zero!! And looking up the old data
won\'t help you-GM\'s will now be coming up with their own stuff!
   There will be a Collector Card Game AND a Comic series!!
   There will be a FF&S-like supplement; Greg Porter is in charge of that.
   A ship combat boardgame is slated for August \'97.
   They plan on releasing two products a month for a year. One will be a
rules addenda, the other a background add-on.
   The plan is to have a book by Don Perrin and Margaret Weis in a year or two.
   They will be returning to the Virus Era in about 3 years, maybe sooner.
   There was a HINT of something involving TV or movies!!
   The first 14 supplements have been planned; that information is

Imperium Games, Inc. presents
Marc Miller\'s  Traveller

Since its original publication in 1977, Traveller has been the
pre-eminent science-fiction role-playing game, providing ways to play in
role-playing, board games, miniatures, and computers. After 23 years,
GDW (the original publisher of Traveller) has closed its doors and the
Traveller game system has reverted to its originator and designer. The
vision Marc Miller has for Traveller is three fold; a comprehensive
rules system, continually expanding background and history, and a wide
variety of products in print, electronic, and other media.

Imperium Games occupies the central position in this plan and is
responsible for producing, under the direction of Marc Miller, the
foundation for the system. Here are some of the titles under
consideration.

TRAVELLER
The Traveller game system rules will be consolidated and restated based
on the original and classic Traveller rules (revised in light of 20
years of role-playing experience). This foundation for every Traveller
player and referee will include a task system and an emphasis on
reasoned simplicity for players and progressive layers of complexity for
referees. Marc Miller.

STARSHIPS
Turn to this reference for detailed information about the starships of
the Traveller universe: statistics, ship names, anecdotal information,
illustrations, deck plans. Don Perrin.

CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOG
The original Traveller game has never had a complete listing of
equipment.  By compiling equipment listed in all published books , and
adding to that with original material, we are creating the basic
reference for equipment every player character needs. Greg Porter.

ALIENS ARCHIVES
Traveller has produced volumes of information on the universes many
alien races, however, we plan to include several more minor races.  By
compiling old materials, as well as adding a alien race generation
system, players can integrate alien races into their travels and
adventures. Tim Brown.

MILIEU 0: The Third Imperium
The essential background for adventuring in Traveller is provided in a
number of Milieu books, each detailing an era in the long history of
mankind in space. Milieu 0 chronicles the emergence of the Third
Imperium from the Long Night, extending its reach to re-explore and
re-conquer the vast interstellar territories that have been untouched
for 1700 years. Covers the early years of the Third Imperium, its
history, structure, economics, and library data. Also includes many
adventure hooks and adds direction to players and Referees. Marc Miller.
 Other Milieu Books will include (among others): The Aslan Border Wars,
The Vargr Wars, The Barracks Emperors, The Rule of Man, Ziru Sirkaa, The
Solomani Rim War, The Zhodani Core Expeditions, and The Interstellar
Wars.

FIRST SURVEY
This vital companion to Milieu 0 is an atlas of the 50 or so sectors
that were the Vilani Empire and its surrounding territories. The star
systems of the Sylean Federation are well defined. Farther and farther
out, systems are less well-defined. Each adventuring group determines
its own survey results for each system they visit. Lester Smith.

Third Imperium Weapons
Players and Referees will be thrilled to buy this complete book of
Imperium weapons. Weapons include melee, small arms, heavy weapons and
artillery. This guide will include graphic detail and history behind the
weapons use in the Imperium. Greg Porter.

Adventure Class Ships
Now it is time to add some detail to the players lives with this
complete book of Adventure Class ships.  Not only will this book supply
a player with new 100+ ton ships, it allows them to design their own
ships, just the way they want them. Don Perrin.

Anomalies
The records of the past don\'t mesh with what should be out there. This
is the first EPIC adventure designed specifically for the Referee in
mind. Marc Miller.

Pocket Empires
When Cleon established the Third Imperium, he never expected he would
have competition from his own scouts, merchants, and naval officers.
Thousands of adventurers tried to conquer worlds and establish their own
empires in the vast, uncharted territories not yet under Imperial rule.
Strategic level rules for establishing Pocket Empires. Marc Miller.

Handbook of the Psionic Institutes
When the Psionic Institutes began studying this abstract science, they
just didn\'t know what a bag of worms they opened. Are they a bunch of
crackpots, or is there something there? Ken Whitman.

Small Craft
If Adventure ships just wasn\'t enough, then you may want to explore the
world of small craft.  Not only will this book supply a player with new
ships less then 100 tons, it allows them to design their own ships,
including fighters. Don Perrin.

MILIEU 200: Aslan Border Wars
The Aslan Border Wars went on for thousands of years. This book details
the wars and the territories they were fought over. Includes major
coverage of the Aslan and how to play them. Lester Smith & Tim Brown.

TRAVELLER: Strategic Battles
Warfare is still the ultimate system for resolving disputes between the
stars. This board game, based on Fifth Frontier War, provides the
mechanism for fighting battles large and small anywhere within the
Traveller universe. Recreates historical battles and allows generation
and resolution of new ones. Meshes with Pocket Empires. Marc Miller.

Now, back to our regularly scheduled debates:

Just a few comments on a conversation between Massimo Stiavelli and
David Summers:

David:

Me:
It seems to me that these concerns make jumping into a system far less risky.
It\'s the sentinels guarding the mainworld who don\'t know where to look
for the spy ship. But the spy ship knows where the mainworld is, and the
fleets that protect the mainworld must be near it in order to watch over
it. So the spy ship will have an easier time finding the fleet than
the fleet will have finding the spy ship.

Massimo:

David:

Me:
Putting the radiators in back won\'t help you if the spy ship is in back
too. In fact, you\'d be better off with no radiators at all in that case.

Actually tho, there is a fairly effective way to shield a fleet from
view. Just keep it so close to a planet that the planet\'s EM and neutrino
emmissions swamp out the fleet\'s signature. Then a spy ship has to come in
close enough to actually RESOLVE a warship in order to see it. Even
then, the fleet may be able to be camouflaged.

This seems to jibe well with canon. In JTAS, articles used to mention
warships hidden in oceans and jovian atmospheres. Obviously such methods
of concealment are not fool-proof, but they do give some edge to the
defenders.

Also, (just to remember where this thread came from) a j-torp is no more
likely to see through such camouflage than a manned ship.(Oh no! Not
j-torps again! 8^) And since spy ships court so little danger in the
first place, j-torps will not make a big change in a spook\'s safety.

Well, the period in which the Imperial Palace was build was maybe a =
\'functionalist\' or \'geometric\' one. Think of some of the arcitecture of =
the twenties (Bauhaus but especially Funkis) or the sixties-seventies. =
The arcitecture of these decades was much more simple than technology =

The sphere I think Harley is thinking about is Limii Orbital in the =
Theton system. It was published in "the Flaming Eye", and I think it =
makes perfect sense as a Vilani structure. Dull, maybe, but very Vilani. =
And this brings us back to the Imperial Palace. It was build by =
Arbellatra (Imperial Encyclopedia, p. 10) who heralded an all time high =
for Solomani political influence in Core (Solomani & Aslan, p. 24). So =
why was the Palace build in an architectural style which seems more =
Vilani than anything else? The most reasonable explanation I can think =
of is that the Palace was build to appeace Vilani high nobles, still =
powerful although their influence was declining at that time. Any better =
explanations?

Vilani architecture is described in "Vilani & Vargr" as being mostly =
dull, with an eye more to functionality than appearance. I guess that =
Bespin from "the Empire strikes back" is more like a Solomani design. In =
my Traveller universe there\'s room for both, depending much on the mood =
I\'m in when I play.

Well, I certainly agree on some of the above mentioned points are =
problems. How does alien design differ from Imperial design, especially =
since one must assume that all races go through different estaethic =
phases which are not necessarily very similar to each other? I think =
this is a difficult question, but then again, trying to imagine _aliens_ =
is a difficult task at best.

Vilani design/architecture is maybe the easiest to describe. It is very =
functional and often ugly. Different periods are more mirrored in choice =
of materials and color than form. Of course, tech level determines a =
lot, too, as the Vilani would tend to utilize the most cost-effective =
methods of construction and use of available space.

On the other hand, _good_ Vilani design, when found, will tend to have =
very simple lines, somewhat like Arne Jacobsen or Philippe Starck.

The Solomani will, of course take a more individual approach towards =
form. Official (read: Party) building would probably tend to be rather =
monumental and monolithic. Individual investors would prefer a wide =
range of different styles, from very conservative buildings, to =
buildings that look more like a work of art than a building. With grav =
technology, one could imagine almost anything. With grav plates, the =
floors don\'t even have to be down! I think some structures would be =
absolutely crazy. Most would probably be rather ordinary looking, =
though, as architects will have to be paid just like everyone else, and =
most investors will tend towards a certain degree of conservatism.

Great Solomani architecture will tend to be highly decorated, intricate =
and voloptuous   to enable the great architects to promote themselves.

I guess that Imperial architecture is a blend of the two.

Vargr design is, as with everything Vargr, a planless blend of =
everything. I think a typical type A Vargr starport will have started =
out as a little installation. As traffic increased, more structures were =
added to the first one, with little thought to if styles clashed or not. =
This will have happened over and over again, till you get something like =
\'the Navel\' from the french science fiction graphic novel/comics series =
"Valerian" (highly recommended as inspiration for sf architecture).

For Aslan architecture I think that one can find much inspiration with =
the spanish architect Gaudi.

The rest of the major races I\'ve haven\'t thought so much about.

Excerpt from the MegaTraveller Journal #1, Q&A, p. 24:

"When a group of starships know they have to arrive in unison, they =
elect to spend significantly more time at the start computing and =
sharing jump vector computations. This leads to a much more accureta =
jump exit at the other end, with the error dropping significantly.
  The formula in the _Starship Operator\'s Manual_ for normal jumpspace =
exit is:

  124 hrs + (2D x 6 hrs)
  yielding a result of 136 - 196 hours
    (that is, 5.7 to 8.2 days)

  If double the jump preparation time is spent with all the affected =
ships in computer link via tight beam communication, use the following =
formula instead:

  167 hours + (2D x 0.1 hr)
  yielding a result of 167.2 - 168.2 hours.

  Most ships now arrive within _minutes_ of each other, with the worst =
spread being up to 60 minutes apart (and this only happens in about 1 =
out of 20 jumps): Considering the vast distances found in a star system, =
starships arriving minutes apart would not spoil a surprise arrival."

Due to the limitations of email, I have replaced italics with an =
underscore ("_").

Hope this is what you were looking for.

A few questions come to mind...
                    1.  Is Far Future accepting outside efforts? (I might
even be interested in writing something on energy systems....
                    2.  Are any of the main participants accepting input from
the Traveller community?
                    3.  Can any or all of them be reached through the Far
Future email drop?
                    4.  Who\'s the official go-between connecting Far Future
with the fans/players?

                    5.  And finally..... why isn\'t next week the RELEASE!!!

>TRAVELLER

I assume, this book will also include world and animal-encounter generation.
What\'s about adding a second, optional 3D-star system generation schema as
2300AD was sayed to have. Traveller\'s background is great but the real
strength of Traveller lays in the possibility to play in alternate settings,
too.

>STARSHIPS

Sounds good. Will this book also include some starship design schema?

>CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOG

But I hope, the TRAVELLER book alone is ready to play? Hopefully this isn\'t
only a book full of weapons as the "RC Equipment Guide" was. I would like to
see all kinds of normal life hitech gadgets from 3D-Holovis, Creditcards to
ancient artefacts.

>ALIENS ARCHIVES

Especially the alien race generation schema sounds great. Some more minor
races and more information about the major ones, would be make up a great
supplement.

>MILIEU 0: The Third Imperium

Well, it\'s a good decission for the new (default?) background? It\'s an age
of re-exploring and re-conquering the universe - in some aspects like the
RC-setting - but without virus. Technology is (TL13 if I remember right) as
low as in the RC setting but (I strongly hope) it\'s a more peaceful setting.

>FIRST SURVEY
>out, systems are less well-defined. Each adventuring group determines
>its own survey results for each system they visit. Lester Smith.

That\'s good. Don\'t try to define all aspects but let them to the referees.
Will this book use the same old UPP data or something better (or at least
improved for better results)?

>Third Imperium Weapons

Well, perhaps such a book have to be published, too. I would wish the same
announce graphic detail and history behind for other equipment from the
SUPPLY CATALOG, too.

>Adventure Class Ships

I\'m a bit undecided about this book. What makes player ship special? Will
only this book include a design schema? Will this book include info on abord
life, standard procedures as docking, landing, starport procedures and so on?

>Anomalies

What\'s an EPIC adventure in contrast with ORDINARY adventures?

>Pocket Empires

Yeah! As I think, the only real workable way to build up such as the third
empire isn\'t millitary conquest but colonialism and economic relations. One
thousand civil explorer could succeed more than 1000 soldiers.

>Small Craft
>Not only will this book supply a player with new
>ships less then 100 tons

Jump capable? Will they CT 100t barrier fall? (I hope so!)

>TRAVELLER: Strategic Battles

Why not...

>For additional information, to be added to our mailing list,

Yes please!

As a final note, I hope in new edition of Traveller the social aspect of
meeting different (or alien) cultures and races will be emphazised more as
in TNE. Remeber, shooting at each other isn\'t the only form of interaction.

First of all, "the mainworld" is not that small an area.  Second, you
don\'t know that the ships are at the main world.  The could, in fact,
be positioned to catch a ship that is assuming that only people on
the main world are looking for him.

>Me:
>Putting the radiators in back won\'t help you if the spy ship is in back
>too. In fact, you\'d be better off with no radiators at all in that case.

Just putting them in back is a crude example of a more general issue.
The more you can direct the energy, the smaller of an area you "need
the enemy not to be in".   If you can only stick your radiators on
one side, then you pretty much need some reason to believe the bad
guys aren\'t behind you.  If you can do better (which I would say
military ships are going to be able to) your requirements are
better.  If you can restrict the emmision to a 30 degree cone
(say be resessing the radiator) then you only need to know
that there is a 30 degree arc free of enemy.  If you can put
out the energy in a specific direction (using a laser or some
yet-to-be-discovered method) then you just need do know
there isn\'t and enemy in the one direction (which is pretty
easy to do).

In anycase, this is, in fact, more a problem for a spy ship.  A defender
can have multiple ships vulnerable from different directions (assuming
they just don\'t dump the energy in the direction of a planet, moon,
asteroid, comet, the sun, etc.) so that any one ship will only
detect one of them.  A spy ships need to know he isn\'t detected
by anyone.

Exactly.

But if you can detect the other ships, they can detect you.  I might
point out a smaller signature for jump-torp, but that is besides the
point.  If things go wrong, you don\'t loose men and ships when you
send in a jump torp.

there\'s a plan to do something in the Virus era several years down the track -
but, lets face it, there are really only two realistic possibilities here -

1) The stuff that\'s on the publication list will be so successful that the bulk
of players, new and old, will be already committed to a particular era *well*
before any TNE specific stuff is released, making it pretty much an also ran.

2) The stuff that\'s on the publication list will be an abysmal (or lesser)
failure ... and let\'s hope not! ... and TNE stuff will simply never get to be
republished at all.

Is this gloating? Yep, probably! I\'m just tickled pink that Marc Miller seems
to think that Virus is as big a loser as I\'ve always thought it was! Is it
premature ... well, who knows? I hope that Traveller #4 is such a huge success
that TNE is just forgotten completely in the rush to publish new products for
other, more believable and more interesting, periods.

However, a couple of questions that haven\'t been dealt with in the posts --

1) Does the new system go back to Thruster Plates for MDrives? (It seems to
imply it does, but doesn\'t actually say it) Or are HePlaR engines still the
way to go?

2) Any further details on the Greg Porter\'s role? How free a hand is he going
to have to design the FF&S-like supplement? Or is he going to have to follow
some sort of restrictive (?) guidelines set by previous stuff?

to Year 0 (which, I might point out, is not the Classic Traveller setting or
the MegaTraveller setting either...) is unknown to me, but I suspect it\'s
because he has a desire to detail all of Traveller history, and what better
way to start than with the beginning of the Third Imperium? This setting
offers some of the same advantages as the TNE setting (exploration of
charted but effectively unknown space; more adventure posibilities beyond
the smuggling/military activities) but without Virus to annoy people. I
myself never disliked Virus, and all indications are that it will remain
part of the "canon" (God, I hate that term!), but this way we can all have
a Traveller we can live with.
   Gloating is unbecoming, by the way.

one problem with tasks, running observational tasks.  In games from Ars

Does the PC hear the person sneaking up behind them or not...

TNE tried to solve this with the Observation skill, and that might work
well if everyone had the same sensory capacity.  However, between the
Vargr sense of smell, Vegan and Hiver IR vision, and the Aslan sense of
hearing things get confusing fast.  Has anyone found some simple way to
adjudicate these problems?   Working out a table of +s and -s for each
species, with each sense seems a bit extreme, but rolling every species
using the same task seems rather limiting.

My best thought would be a secondary characteristic which was species
specific: Senses:  For humans it would be 0, perhaps for +2 for Vargr and
+1 for Aslan, -1 (or -2) for Virushi...  You would then have perceptual
tasks written up as

Difficulty [Int, Senses] (uncertain),  or perhaps if looking for an Ambush
say Difficult [Int, Recon, Senses] (uncertain).

Tasks using sensors would remain Difficulty [Int, Sensor Ops]

I\'m about to start a campaign I\'m thinking of using:

Characters raised in Prestellar or earlier environments receive no

Characters raised in Early Stellar environments start aging one term
later than normal.

Characters raised in Average Stellar environments also receive a +1 to
all aging rolls (ie they start again 1 term later and receive the +1).

Characters raised in High Stellar environments also receive a +2 to all aging
rolls (1 term later aging and +2).

I also limit characters to 5 or 6 terms, to avoid folks playing
over-experienced geezers.

Comments, other solutions?

around 300,000 BCE.  That means that they did not collect a bunch of
modern humans, instead, they got a whole lot of Homo Erectus specimens.

For here were born the 40+ human minor races, as well as the Solomani,
the Vilani, and the Zhodani.  Given that Homo Erectus was pretty
different from modern humans, and we are talking about 300 K years of
evolution on an alien planet, I think that most human minor races will be
a good bit more divergent than the ones described so far.

It would be easy to avoid the whole problem and change the date from
300,000 years ago to 60,000 years ago. By this time, humans looked a whole
lot more human.  However, I see the possibilities presented by this data
as really interesting.  I tend to assume that the Vilani and other
"normal" human varieties are only part of a wide spectrum ranging from
folks who look just like Solomani to quite divergent types.  I would
assume that the Darrians are a rather moderate example of how divergent the
various varieties can get.  The most extreme types would undoubtably be
wholly different species.  Of course, in addition to this are the
varieties who the Ancients genetically modified.  All bets are off with
them.

While 300,000 years is not enough time for prehensile tails, IR vision, or
similar oddities to evolve, I can see an amazing variety of differences
between the various types of Humaniti found within the Imperium.  Fur,
short muzzles, minor aquatic adaptations, all seem quite possible.  I\'ve
occasionally borrowed some of the less unlikely hominds from Ringworld in
some of my games.

So, has anyone else thought about this, or come up with any interesting
varieties of humans?

I think human minor races present a great opportunity for role-playing,
since they are an opportunity to play someone who is human, but quite
different.  This is easier (for many people) than trying to play a truly
believable alien being.

I\'ve had everything in my campaigns from midgets and dwarves to 8 foot tall
humans and a lot in between.

In some cases I\'ve had humans that were adapted to their particular
homeworld and in some cases couldn\'t comfortably adapt to other worlds
without encounter suits of some sort. Fer instance, I had a race of humans
that their homeworld was a very high G planet. (3G) These people rarely were
over 4\' 6" but were *wide*. THe were incredibly strong and could lift/carry
lots of weight in a normal or low G environment.  I don\'t remember the
science fiction novel I got that idea from.  If I could I\'d give due credit.

Along the lines of non-human variants I\'ve found room for some of the
fantasy races as well.  Orcs being my favorite to throw into a campaign
setting.  They were good for starting barroom brawls and other chaos... :)

Hobbits took the form of the "Shellizan" who took a great deal of pride in
their ability to carry on commerce and some of them were exceptional chefs
as well.

First of all I\'d like to clarify that I simply hate TNE. I hate it because
of the background and also for what is represents. I remember reading on
the old TML about the efforts that the contributors to the list made
to avoid the introduction of the Virus. At the time GDW guys were in more
or less regular contact with the list. It is remarkable how arrogant their
attitude was. The background was killing new customers and the new customers
wanted not a grandious empire but a post-holocaust scenario. It was even said
that the market would have demonstrated who was right. Well, it has.
They obviously did not conquer the market while managing to loose a
fraction of the old customers (me included).

Let\'s face it, the crowds of kids will never (again) be captured by
Traveller. The collectible cards will not help. That idea has already been
exploited by many, and, as far as I know, nobody repeated the success of
Magic The Gathering (TM). The original CT was introduced few years after the
first landing on the moon. I remember the emotional impact of that landing.
Everybody was interested in space. Now some have a  moderate interest in
space. My feeling is that a new issue of TRaveller should target these
few, a fraction of whom, however, are probably already players. It is not
by alienating the old players that this new initiative will produce money.

What is my recipe? first concentrate on ideas. no set of rules will make
everybody happy (not to mention ADD, I recently gave a look to the
2nd edition rulebooks [I am not a regular player..], it is incredible how
crappy, dispersed, difficult to use they are, still how many ADD players
are there?). Once the ideas are there one can take care of the details,
e.g. rich lists of equipment, good design rules, possibly a task system,
scenarios and worlds pregenerated with some detail, etc.
As a referee I find it difficult to move away from the year 1000 timeline,
but as a player I would love to play in any period as long as the show
works and it is a far future science fiction game and not a survivors
new barbarians game.

Finally my personal feeling is that one should not get too worried about
the physics of jump drives , thruster plates etc. Of course they are
unphysical. Of course if misused they could create enormous inconsistencies,
but who cares? The game is refereed for a reason. Thruster plates,
antigravity etc add a lot to the game, I would not like to play without them.

By 300,000 years ago Homo sapiens were the predominant hominid species on
earth. Homo erectus is not known in Africa this late, and was even no longer
present in the Far East after 250,000 ya.

However, these are not known as *archaic* Homo sapiens for nothing...Homo
sapiens is composed of a variety of subspecies which include Cro Magnon man,
Heidleberg man, and the Neanderthals, so there is still room for plenty of
morphological variation (although these weren\'t around until long after
300,000 ya). If an ancient poped down to Eartyh then, his/her/it\'s sample of
humans would nearly all be \'primitive\' H. spaiens.

The differences between these archaic forms and modern man are primarily in
the cranium, and include lower, longer braincases, reduced cranial capacity
(not by much though - Neanderthals actually had *larger* braincases) and
facial prognathism (their noses stick out).

Sorry to be anal, this is not a flame. It\'s just that enough people get on
their high horse regarding physics on this group that I thought I\'d do the
same with biology :-)

I think there are other sources for architecture in the Imperium than
the Imperial Palace.  How about: Moot Spire, or the acrcology-type
city in Imperial Encyclopedia or Referee\'s Companion (gravitic
structures there), or the grav cities of Vincennes (one of the MTJs)?
As for aliens, there are the floating gardens on Kusyu (Aslan &
Solomani), the great monolithic starscrapers of Vland (Vilani &
Vargr), the subterrainean Vargr city on some world in Gvurrdon (Alien
Realms.  Don\'t forget, just because you can think of things to do,
doesn\'t mean the architects of the day can.  I\'m sure there are things
we can do with modern technology that haven\'t been done.  Also, most
architects, in common with all other professions, are mostly
work-a-day types who simply do what they are payed to do, and take
inspiratoin from the fore most architects of the day; as architecture
is as much a matter of taste as what is possible, then technology
doesn\'t necessarily result in exciting buildings.  Yes, the Imperial
Palace is dull, but then maybe the Imperium needed dull after the
Civil War!  Perhaps Arbellatra didn\'t want to appear to be
aggrabdising herself.  Just because she was a successful Admiral and
Empress doesn\'t mean she had any taste.  Perhaps an impression of raw
power was intended.  Face it, dull architecture is more realistic than
exciting architecture!  However, I\'d say that you can find interesting
illustrations in the Traveller books (some above), although there are
also some terrible illustrations.

There was also the Gateway Station in MTJ#4, but that was built around

Were these books E. E. Doc Smith\'s D\'Alembert series, eg. Clockwork

had a famous interstellar circus for a cover.  The people who ran this
circus were from such a world.

The description in TD#9 suggests that the architects decided to go with
a simple, massive design that served at least two purposes.  First, the
design was meant to be defensible.  No fancy platforms, clear fields of
fire for hidden surface weapons emplacements, strictly controlled and
visible access points.

The architect wanted to make a clear, stark statement about the solidity
of the Imperium.  A floating sphere a kilometer in diameter is a mighty
structure, simple, and stark.  It gets your attention.  And in 630, it
was probably an impressive technological achievement.  The building
displaces almost forty million tons in starship terms.

The previous palace, was designed by Martin II, and was supposed to be
splendid, and was also rather rococo -- it ended up being almost over
decorated.  Perhaps the practical Arbellatra wanted to make a statement
which expressed the might of Imperial power without the overdone fancy
architecture of previous, discredited Imperial administrations.

It\'s also elegantly surreal, as befits an emperor of the galaxy.  It seems
reminiscent of Magritte\'s painting "La voix des airs" to me.

Believe it or not, this fits with something I remember from _Signal GK_.
One of the liner\'s cabins was decorated in a post-Civil War style -- stark,
plain, with a lot of solid colors and translucent furniture.

I guess I\'ve never really been bothered by Traveller\'s aging rules.
Here\'s why:

I\'m no expert on aging, but it seems to me that all of our medical
technology hasn\'t affected human aging much, if at all. Our increased
AVERAGE lifespan is admittedly much longer, but this isn\'t due to our aging
more slowly. Rather, it\'s due to the fact that we are so much less
likely to die of disease or trauma than our ancestors.

In other words, we\'re more likely to grow old now than in the bad old
days, but we don\'t BECOME old any later. Even thousands of years ago, a
man who died of "old age" died at seventy or eighty. Such men were rarer
then than now, of course. But that\'s because only about half of the
population ever had a chance to get old.

Someone told me once that our extended average lifespan this century was
attributible almost entirely to early detection of cancer and to the
invention of refrigeration (which eliminated most cases of food
poisoning.) This sounds a little too trite and tidy to be entirely true,
but it\'s sentiment jibes well with my observation that modern medicine
protects us more from dying young than from growing old.

So it seems to me that, barring some new medical breakthrough like
anagathics, the steady march of medical TL\'s will help Trav characters
more on their survival rolls than on their aging rolls.

Well, now you have my Cr 0.02 worth. 8^)

PS, nice post about the observation tasks by the way. It\'s a much needed

  Hmm. I think it is more to the point that Traveller emerged right around the
time that _Star Wars_ was released. This probably had a much greater impact.
  Now they are talking about a new _Star Wars_ release. If it has the same
impact of the first series (and it is, more or less, a generation later), then
_this_ is the audience they have a good chance at targeting...

 I just want you to know that as long as I have access to a web page I will
still build on the RC setting.  I know there are other people out there who
feel the same way.  If you don\'t like it, sorry, but I enjoy the RC setting.
Will I ignore the New Trav 4 setting?  No, I\'d be foolish to do that.  But I
refuse to limit myself to only one time setting to game in.  If you are
going to give up your CT era and setting, you will lose just as much as TNE
players and ref\'s will lose (probably more).  As I understood the way the
new system has been designed, it will be able to be applied to many time
settings.  There is even a supplement for the year 200, Aslan Border Wars, I
think.  Whatever made you think that TNE and the Virus era were history?
What gives you the idea that Mr. Miller thinks the Virus was bad?  Sure he
said he decided to please himself, but I think he was talking about the
rules system.  Who knows wether he liked the Virus era or the CT era more?
He chose to use a completely new era for his completely new game.  This was
surely a business decision.  After seeing all the petty fighting over which
era was better, TNE or CT or MT, Mr. Miller made IMO a very wise decision to
avoid all three while building a customer base.

I feel sory for you.  You seem to want to limit yourself and everyone else
to a single time in the future history of the Imperium.  That is sad.  This
is a game!!!  There should only be the limits that the Ref places on the
game.  If you want a CT era game, by all means, HAVE a CT era game, but do
not tell me that I can\'t have an RC era game just because you don\'t like the
details of the time period.  If you are right, however, and the TNE era is
gone forever, then the CT era is gone as well.



To everyone else:

I\'m sorry to take up space on the mailing list with this.  When I signed up
for the mailing list, I thought it would be a great place to get ideas for
adventures and campaigns.  I was right, but I was shocked to find the
mudslinging and personal little wars going on over differences of opinions.
This list and the Traveller list should be a place to share your ideas
without fear of being condemned for your opinion.  When something I suggest
doesn\'t fit, I expect that to be pointed out to me, however; when I express
my opinion, it is just that, an opinion.  If you don\'t like my opinion,
state your opinion and we can discuss the differences without condemning
each other personally.  Yes, I believe that people can have an intelligent
discussion about differing opinions without putting each other down.  Enough
rambling and sorry for the space, but I had to get this out. I\'m tired of
getting junk mail where all people do is tell how stupid their opponents
ideas and preferences are.

  Paul talks about CT players loosing as much as TNE
with the new background. I agree, but with different
emphasis: _neither lose much_!
  Back when TNE first hit the streets I said "What is
this crap? If they wanted a \'new society breaks into
the stars\' type stuff why didn\'t they set it just after
The Long Night?" I\'m delighted to see that Mark has now
done exactly this.
  I would imagine that most RC type campaigns could be
lifted and insterted, without much change, into the
new settings. Contrarywise new setting material could
be just as easily grafted into ongoing RC type campaigns.
  Most Classic style campaigns are often set on the
fringe anyway. The new setting just moves the fringe
to a new location.
  In short, focusing on the end of the Long Night is
an ideal way to bring the divergent strands of players
into focus. (Maybe not ideal, but lets settle for best.)

  Paul wants story ideas, fine.
  An advance Imperial/RC merchant has gone Beyond the Fringe
to a world their corporation feels has future commercial
potential. They agree to sponsor a selection of the up and
coming on the world to travel to the settled area, work
for a while as a merchant, and then travel back with their
new-found knowledge.
  The PCs are the sponsored group.

At I-CON (April 12-14), I will be holding a Traveller fan panel, to hash

and suggestions for its future.

Especially welcome are discussion on "things we\'d like to see."

For clarity, let me state that I am not connected to Imperium Games,
thus the reason this is a _fan_ panel. However, notes and/or a
recording of the proceedings will be forwarded to MM and Imperium Games.

If I can get the information, updates on the status of other
GDW games will be available as well.

I-CON is the East Coast\'s largest convention of science fact, fiction, and
fantasy. Some of this year\'s guests include:
Alan Dean Foster
Ethan Philips (Neelix from ST: Voyager)
Bill Mumy (Babylon 5 and Lost in Space)
Mike Stackpole
Liz Danforth (Magic: The Gathering and [classic] Traveller artist)

and lots of others.

I\'ve only been able to dig up bits and pieces here and there. Let\'s see:

The Imperial Encyclopedia has the following to say in Library Data under =
"Major Race":

"The Suerrat (a human race) are considered minor because their =
achievement of interstellar travel utilized generation ships."

Also, I\'ve looked at the HIWG files available at ftp.engrg.uwo.ca. =
There\'s a document on the Answerin by James Maliszewski, who has the =
following to say about the Suerrat:

"Furthermore, thorough various sources I\'ve that the Suerrat were =
transplanted from Massilia (as stated in earlier literature) to Ilelish, =
apparently because GDW and DGP didn\'t want to have another MHR in the =
same sector as the Geonee."

Other documents on the ftp site states that the Suerrat were mentioned =
in Alien Module 8 (which one was that - Darrians?).

UPPs for all worlds in Ilelish can be found at the above mentioned ftp =
site, but for the convenience of those who doesn\'t have ftp access, here =
is the UPP for 2907 Ilelish:

Ilelish       2907 E674983-A    Hi In              204 Im M0 D

Please note that we are speaking about the world Ilelish itself.

Finally, Traveller News Service in Challenge 43 has this newsbit:

"ILELISH/ARRELI (2707 B877831-8)                    Date: 023-1120
  At the Federation Natural History Conference, held at Gitaaz Center in =
Concarraffi, Dr. Javin Stark presented the findings from his recent =
archaeological digs on Ilelish. The centerpiece of the presentation was =
a fossilized Droyne skull, which he estimated to be about 300,000 years =
old.
  "This finding obviously presents us with far more questions than =
answers regarding the history of the world (Ilelish)," Stark stated. =
"The two main questions are, \'How did Droyne get to Ilelish,\' and \'Why =
did they disappear?\' Considering that the date of this skull fits with =

Ilelish by the Ancients, it seems reasonable to assume that a sample of =
Droyne were brought to Ilelish as well.
  "As to why they disappeared - it could be that they were exterminated =
while competing with the proto-Suerrat for resources after the Ancients\' =
Final War. An alternate theory proposes that the Ancients may simply =
have discontinued use of Droyne on this world.
  "Unfortunately, we simply don\'t have enough facts to support any =

Hope this helps

I cannot imagine "lifting" an existing campaign and "inserting" it into a
new setting, and having the campaign survive.  GDW made the same
suggestion about existing CT/MT campaigns when TNE came out, and I found
it equally repugnant.  Words fail to express, etc.

My CT campaign world is an integral part of the campaign.  Several
characters served in the Fifth Frontier War; one is considered a war
criminal by the Zhodani for his actions.  All have significant NPC
contacts outside their starship.  The PCs care what happens in the world,
and have political opinions.  One, for a trivial example, idolizes Norris,
and wants nothing more than to meet him.

Were I to "lift" my campaign out of its era and "insert" it into the Year

I cannot imagine what sort of campaign you run, if the setting is so
peripheral to the game that you can junk it.

  Hmm. I think it is more to the point that Traveller emerged right around
the
time that _Star Wars_ was released. This probably had a much greater
impact.
 ----

Back in Challenge 50 or so Marc Miller wrote that watching Star Wars
provided a lot of the inspiration for Traveller. A lot of the rest seems to
have come from Asimov\'s Foundation.

Which probably explains the emphasis on players travelling about in 200 ton
free traders trying to stay one step ahead of Imperial money lenders etc.

Traveller appeared at a time when virtually all RPG\'s were generic in nature
and the notion of doing the game of a movie was beyond the means of most
game companies.

 ----
Now they are talking about a new _Star Wars_ release. If it has the same
impact of the first series (and it is, more or less, a generation later),
then _this_ is the audience they have a good chance at targeting...
    Showing my age...
                Jo

Unfortunately for Traveller there now exists a very popular Star Wars
roleplaying game that will get most of the benefit from any new Star Wars
films etc.

Any new Star Wars films will have much less impact than the first one.
You would recall that before SW there was nothing quite like it and after it
there have been heaps of imitators. Battlestar Galactica springs to mind as
something that appeared soon after SW, attempting to piggyback on SW
success, but that was quite Star Trek like as well...

Django, remembering the first time he saw SW back in its first run in the
cinema.

" I\'ve got this idea for a film. It\'s a sci-fi that\'s a sort of western in
space, with the sword fighting and mysticism of a samurai flick, and
sandwiching in space dogfights as if from the Battle of Britain and a heroic
Dambusters style attack on the bad guys. Oh and the bad guys all look and
behave like the Nazis in a war movie too."

".... Damn someone beat me to it!" :)

them in the right places, and ignore RSB.

The bulk of the campaigns I have seen, run, played in, or been told about
have been either CT or MT spinward marches or solomani rim. The largest
group left thereafter is RC, then Regency. All of which are definitely
"frontier". some of the items for 1050-1130 are tailored to that era...
very few are specific to it.

T4\'s multi-era support will provide for an unequalled breadth of setting;
also these areas are frontiers only to the imperials... in era 0, there
will be some emergent pocket empires, some local splinters, and lots of
political intrigues.

By Era 200 (aslan border wars) the setting will have fallen into the
imperial culture trap... an imperial culture will have emerged. And the
imperium will then be truly familiar, if not up to the tech specs of 1000+
YI.

Each era seems to be a major turning point in imperial history.

Including the TNE/RC/RSB setting (Ouch! I actually said that!) with its
fallen imperium, no longer recognizeable.

More depth, timed to release shortly before lucas next installment of Star
Wars (Supposedly Summer 97 according to the trades).

Hopefully it will sell... I know everyone up here is excited!

I believe a comment was made in Vilani & Vargr that they had a STL-based
empire of 25 or so worlds in Ilelish and Gushemege prior to Vilani contact.

Yeah, I think there were some comments in Darrians, but I forget what.

Ilelish led the Ilelish Revolt in the 400s, and paid dearly for it (see
Rebellion Sourcebook).  Up to then, they\'d been sector capital.  When the
Imperial Navy finally captured the system, they evacuated and sterilized
the lush equatorial zone of the world as an object lesson.  I suspect
that this was a deep blow to the arboreal Suerrat people.

The interview with Jeremii Boden in MT#3 claims that the Suerrat trade
language used in the Ilelish Cultural Region is called Yaudal; this is
probably a subtle in-joke.  (Say it out loud.  Mess with the vowels.
What does Tarzan do? :)  I\'ll probably regret mentioning this....)

The Suerrat are probably one of the more important minor races in the
Imperium, and are probably more commonly seen than you\'d think, even
though their homeworld isn\'t impressive.

history background for the Interstellar Wars ... you know, the one that
assumes that everything we\'ve been told is an organised lie?

Well, remember I proposed that the only way the Terran Federation could have
beaten the Vilani - who had much greater population and production resources -
was to outproduce them? Well, just how many people did the Terran Federation
*have*?

At present we have, what, 6 billion people? And the rate of population increase
is evidently slowing -- certainly in all developed countries.

The Nth Interstellar War ends in 2299 AD with the collapse of the Vilani
Imperium ... and within a very short time the Colonials under Admiral
Estigaribbia supposedly revolt against plans by the Terran Federation to
incorporate all of the Ziru Sirka. Supposedly they have made up most of the
fleets that have been fighting the Ziru Sirka.

Wait a minute! This is only three hundred years away! How many people are there
likely to be in the colonies in 300 years? How many colonies? Given that the
reasons for declining birthrates are as much to do with the fact that women
now have careers to pursue as for anything else, and that the nature of space
travel means that most colonists will come from wealthy countries, then can we
assume that the colonies have outbred earth in such a short time? We would have
to assume much higher than likely birth rates in the colonies than is likely
given the current attitude towards women (and women\'s attitudes towards
themselves!) ... and, given that the 3rd Imperium and the RefCol and the
Regency all have what seems like absolute equality for women, how can we
accept this?

So, it seems unlikely that the Colonials could have had the preponderance of
population needed to undertake successfully such a program *unless* they also
had a preponderance of industry and the like ... and the only way they could
normally be expected to manage this is if they had something like the AutoFacs
that I suggest. Even then, it seems likely that Terra would have a vast
industrial base that would be able to face them down ... certainly the older
colonies allied with Terra would tip the balance completely in the
mother-world\'s favour.

I would suggest that this is another indication that the "truth" we have been
presented with through Imperial sources is merely an organised lie to disguise
the treason of Estigaribbia and his (relative) handful of militarist cronies.
(Well, it makes a nice alternative theory anyway!)

Then, consider this, even if the Colonies *were* larger in population than
Terra and the older colonies, could they have realistically managed to grow
the required population to face off the Vilani in only 300 years? Makes you
wonder, eh?

In answer to Philip McGregor\'s message about the too tiny size of the =
Terran population compared to the Vilani:

There\'s an easy answer to the question of how Terra\'s population quickly =
exploded in just 300 years: Cloning. Make as many clones as you want of =
lots of different people and place them on the new worlds - instant =
colony!

I\'m not saying this is how it happened/happens :-), but only that this =

  Actually, this is the canon explanation - in Rats & Cats, the firm
GenAssist used genetic engineering and "artificial wombs" tended by
robots and a small human staff that churned out thousands of children a
year.  The kids were educated by tapes feeding the subconcious mind.  The
result was a heavily populated productive colony world in twenty years.

  Apparently most coreward worlds were settled this way.  The people
of these colonies saw themselves as Terrans, since they lacked
defined national roots.

  See "Solomani & Aslan" on page 20.  If you don\'t have it, contact me
directly if you want more details.

Well, yes, this has been *alleged* over and over ... as the so-called "Plague
of Duskir" (which, despite searching through a friends copy of the Vilani
sourcebook, is *not* mentioned there as some have previously suggested ... does
it really exist in some reliable "canon" publication or is it simply a furphy?)
.. the problem that has to be faced is, that the Plague of Duskir (assuming
that it existed at all ... and I have suggested already that it is of dubious
veracity for good scientific and medical reasons) occurs *after* the final
defeat of the Vilani *not* before.

In any case, this still doesn\'t explain how the Terran Federation was then
KO\'ed by its own colonies. Consider this, the latest figures (in teh Sydney
Morning Herald today) are that the previous max figure of 13 billion projected
for the earth\'s population is likely now to only be 11 billion, as the rate
of increase has decreased. Now, given the continuing enhancement of female
equality, and this is supported by all CTrav, MTrav and TNE material, it seems
most unlikely that in 300 years that a vast colonial population could have been
built up ... and it seems even more unlikely that it would be place where all
the high tech industry would be in any case. So how did the colonials manage
it?

My solution in both cases -- the history that we have been told of by the
Imperium is an organised lie for their own political reasons. We know that
the Imperium has a long track record of organising this sort of "big lie", so
why not, if it suited their purposes. You may well not agree with my
explanation as to *why* they have manipulated the truth -- or exactly what
it is they are hiding ... but an *excellent* case for their being *something*
that they are hiding exists. Just consider this, there are evidently documents
in the British Public Records Office dating back to the middle ages that are
*still* classified as "Top Secret" ... what can their be that they could
possibly want to hide from back then? (I can think of a few things!) So, surely
the Imperium may have some skeletons that they would prefer no-one uncovered?!

Yes, except there had been ongoing contact for most of the 300 years of the
Interstellar wars, and any disease ... no-one yet having presented credible
"canon" evidence that the Plague of Duskir was anything other than the usual
sort oif thing that accompanies societal collapse in the chaotic aftermath
of a lost war ... the Terrans had is well and truly likely to have run its
course on the Vilani *long* before the end.

Then, consider this. What did the other planets (outside of Vland) *eat*? We
are told that the plants and animals of Vland were largely inedible to the
Vilani ... surely the chances of any planet having *any* food that is edible
by humans or human descended/related lifeforms is so close to nil as to be
pointless considering?! Sure, there are two solutions to this --

1) The Panspermia Premise -- That is, that life was spread throughout the
Galaxy from a single source by comets (or whatever) and so all life on all
planets are related. This means that the story the Vilani put around about
Vland must be distorted ... or that Vland must have been a unique case.

2) There are what, someone recently mentioned 28 IIRC, a *lot* of minor and
major human races in the vicinity of the Imperium ... what do *they* eat?
There is no indication that the Zhodani, Vargr, Julians, Darrians, or any
of the other human races have any food problems on *their* planets. Moreover,
it is made quite plain in a variety of sources that most animals that can be
encountered are *edible*. Assuming that they are, then it seems to me that
there is a very high chance (approaching 100%) that each such planet will have
at least one ... and probably several (tens, hundreds?) diseases that will find
human beings quite palatable. So the Vilani *must* have had considerable
experience with disease prior to contact with the Terrans. Ergo, it seems
more and more *certain* that Vilani apologists for the Ziru Sirka are lying
through their teeth for their own socio-political ends!

(Well, that\'s one line ... and it makes more sense and is based on more logic
and better evidence that yours, so *I* think, FWIW)

> I would say that disease was likely a major factor in the Terran victory.

I would say that you still haven\'t explained the population disparity, and *I*
have offered an alternative -- and more believable -- explanation for the so-
called disease theory.

Yep, but is cloning available prior to TL/12? Actuall7y, according to the MTRav
Referees Companion, you can\'t even clone *body parts* until TL/13! Genetic
Engineering is not available until TL/14 ... and I guess that full cloning
isn\'t available until TL17-18, as "Partial Memory Transfer (Dupe)" isn\'t
available until TL18, and this sort of implies full cloning.

The problem stands.

We *all* get it this way. From another list, I happen to know *what* it
is. Your Microsoft software is doing you the "service" of including a
Rich-Text-Format (RTF) copy of your message. It\'s what\'s emcoded in the
mess.

I\'m not sure if there\'s a way to turn it off or not. If there isn\'t,
you will *have* to change software as this Microsoft "feature" is *not*
acceptable on the the net.

Whether it can be disabled or not, *please* write a nasty letter to
Microsoft about it.

     Federation:

     My primary focus is your idea about the women having careers and its
     effect on the Terran Population 300 years from now.  I think that you
     are focusing only on the major industrialized nations in this
     analysis.  The women\'s movement here in the states and England began
     in the relational feminist way, with women realizing and promoting the
     fact that although they were equal to men in basic human rights, they
     also carried the ability to reproduce, which made them different.  It
     later evolved into Independent Feminism, which said that women should
     see themselves as equals and not be concerned about their reproductive
     capabilities when relating to men.  This is what we experience today
     in the US...the reality is that relational feminists are still the
     majority by a huge margin.  Yes, population growth has slowed in the
     US, but that is not only a factor of feminism but also of the aging
     boomer population which no longer can have children (at least for the
     most part).

     You must remember that in the women of continental Europe have also
     undergone a feminist revolution and seem very content with a
     relational feminist idea.  In many third world and developing
     countries, even many Asian countries (whose population makes up over
     50% of that on Earth), women haven\'t had ANY revolution yet.  In the
     Moslem nations, its not religiously correct for the female to have a
     career or even SPEAK!  Many Asian cultures have an extremely
     \'subservient female\' mindset and with all of the openness of the world
     economies in the last 50 years and exposure to the American movement,
     this hasn\'t changed their culture (or that of Korea or China) by any
     measurable means.

     Let\'s not turn this into a discussion on feminism, but my point is
     that I think you\'re thinking in an America-centric fashion when you
     say that the women of the world have careers now, so our population
     growth will slow down in the future.

I\'m pretty sure Rats & Cats makes reference to the Solomani megacorporation
GenAssist, which was founded by the Terran Coordination to assist colonization
efforts by modifying both native and Terran flora and fauna and, ultimately,
humans themselves.  My own Interstellar Wars setting, slowly taking shape,
has many "tuber" colonies near Earth, crash-colonized by GenAssist using
legions of vat-grown clones.  In ensuing decades the original clone-lines
have mingled and varied (though draconian genetic counseling and marriage
permits are still characteristic of the colonial governments).  Many of the
colonial citizens have left their homeworlds to join the Confederation
military, but there\'s still a great deal of prejudice towards these
mass-produced "spuds."

There\'s the implication in the very limited Interstellar Wars material that,
once the Vilani overlords were removed, the subject (or lower-caste Vilani)
populations were more than willing to help their conquerors/liberators.
Again, my nascent setting has several such "military colonies", on which
crash innoculation programs strive to make the new government non-lethal
to its workers.  Ethnic problems have sprung up on several worlds, where
vacc-suited or masked occupiers have been interpreted as an insult, "too
good" for the "dirty" commoners....  And there\'s certainly a submovement
(proto-Solomani-Party) within the military that considers the Vilani just
that: ill-equipped interlopers to be swept out of the way by any means
necessary.  But indiscriminate use of the Terran microbiological arsenal
has been strictly prohibited, both to protect Vilani civilian populations
who may be _needed_ as industrial backup against the incredibly larger
Ziru Sirka and because of moral queasiness on the part of the Secretariat....

In addition, I believe the Solomani probably had assistance from at least a
few, and possibly several, of the minor races (human and otherwise) which
were subjugated by the Vilani.  The Vegans are an obvious candidate, but
I\'m sure one or more human minor races (the recently-mentioned Suerrat?)
might well have joined in.  And the Newts would only have huddled in their
office cubicles....

Given that the "canonical" literature describes multiple breakaway movements
and similar disasters besetting the Ziru Sirka in its last days (Vargr
incursions, separatist governors with barbarian armies, etc.), I wonder why
we don\'t hear more about other proto-governments like the victorious Terrans?
Were they co-opted, or ruthlessly eliminated in the Terran drive for
manifest destiny?  More grist for your conspiracy mill, Phillip....

You just can\'t make this statement.  We simply don\'t know enough about
why life evolved the way it did.  It can be argued that all life is going
to be based on the same sets of amino acids and nucleic acids.  It may
be that edible food is hard to come by for humans but it may also be
common.  [It should also be noted that things are easier for microbes
who will probably be able to live in any carbon based biosphere.]

The problem the Vilani had is that they were unable to develop a consitent
biology.  Since some of the species (including man, the one of most interest)
came from a completely seperate biosphere with a completely different universal
ancestory, the theories kept running into things they couldn\'t handle.  The
result is that Vilani medicine and biology had to treat every species and
disease as a unique case (and you can forget about genetics).  This leaves
them stuck back about where we were in the late 1800\'s/early 1900\'s.  Now
the Vilani were probly reasonably adept at treating microbial infections,
since microbes aren\'t so dependant on "high level" aspects of how biology
works, but viruses are another matter.

Actually, full body cloning is a TL 9 procedure, and by TL 10 growth
quickening allows the clones to be grown a 10x speed.  Creating a 20 year
old clone would only take 2 years.  Cloning only a single arm or eye is
substantially more difficult than cloning a fully body.  Take a look at
the Traveller\'s Digest 12-14 for more info.

  In Rats & Cats, the plague is described as happening during the mass
migration of the Solomani that occured after the defeat of the Vilani.
The article on disease in one of the later copies of MegaTraveller Digest
(unfortunatly I don\'t have access to my copies at the moment) implies that
the plague played a role in the war.

  The standard explanation for Terran victory, taken from the
MegaTraveller Encyclopedia entry "Nth Interstellar War" (p. 33), is that
the initial wars between the Solomani and the Vilani were fought on the
Vilani side with only the resources of the local Imperial Governor (this
is a direct steal from the GDW boardgame Imperium), allowing the
Solomani to win against limited opposition.  By the time the central
government had noticed what was going on and dispatched major fleet
units (after the Terran victory in the 8th Interstellar War), the Terrans
had invented J-3 (which the Vilani did not have) and generally kicked
Imperial behind.

  The eventual collapse of the Imperium was due as much to "its own
weight, age and decadence as from Terran victories."  One should also not
forget that the Vargr were also ravaging the Imperium from the opposite
side (see Doggies & Drones), and that there were internal rebellions as
well (implied in Rats & Cats).  Any effect of the Plague of Duskir would
simply add to the general confusion.

  Note that developments on Terra are limited by the lack of avalible
land and economic opportunity.  When Europeans came to the Americas,
these transplanted populations experienced huge growth rates, much higher
than were seen in the Europeans left at home.  There is no reason to
assume that Terrans encountering the opportunities of interstellar
colonies would not respond with more children to fill them up.  This does
not imply a different role for women - Rats & Cats p. 20 shows that these
birth were largely through "artificial wombs", freeing women to be as
equal as they liked.

  Actually, we\'ve hashed this out before, so I won\'t go into this
arguement again, but I am still unconvinced that one needs anything other
than the canon explanations for Vilani defeat (internal decadence, Terran
use of J-3 drive, Vargr invasions, internal rebellion) - taken together
they do very nicely.

  On the other hand, your theories do make for a nice X-Files kind of
deep background, with opportunities for adventure.  Not my idea of
Traveller, but then, each to his or her own.

  The answer to where these food sources came from is very simple - the
Ancients put them there, just as they put all those major and minor human
races there.  If I were them, I\'d have made sure I didn\'t take any
diseases along to infect my human breeding stock.

  Nobody said that the Terrans didn\'t get diseases from the Vilani (the
Native peoples of the Americas passed syphylis on to Europeans, after
all), just that Terrans had lots more diseases to give, and had better
medicine to cope with Vilani imports.

  The "population disparity" is easily accounted for by the "artificial
wombs" described in Rats & Cats that are described as creating a new
fully functioning colony world in twenty years.  This is indirectly
supported by the rules of the boardgame Imperium, where an undisturbed
Terran outpost on a habitable world takes only ten years of peace (or
something like that; don\'t have the rules here) to turn into a colony
with two-thirds the industrial capacity of Terra itself.  Sorry, but
there is no population disparity - the Terrans can have as many people as
you like.

  The Solomani didn\'t use cloning, they used "Artificial Wombs," which
implies that they just extracted a whole bunch of eggs from doner women
(we can do this now - in fact we do), added sperm, and then put them in
the oven to bake.  You could increase yield even further by encouraging
the development of identical twins or even greater multiples.  Aside from
the artificial womb thing, this is all contemporary tech.  By getting
arround the physical limit of human wombs, you can use all of a woman\'s
eggs (hundreds, I think - maybe more) and have population growth rates
that are just absurd - the only limit is how many of these artificial
wombs you can build.

  Very true.  Note also that there are subgroups even within American and
European societies who have large families - Mormons, Catholics, etc.

  I\'d just add that artificial womb technology would allow women to have
children without the career interference we see in contemporary society.
Moreover, government policies that favored more children, esp.
arrangements for collective child care, would also increase birth rates
if needed.  Families currently limit the number of children due to
calculations about the amount of resources they can devote to each and
their chances for success - and expanding colonial society provides more
opportunity and would change the calculus parents make.

  Sorry for such a long post - it\'s just that this topic is a nice break
from the recent hardware wars and flames about the death of TNE and stuff.

I don\'t know *where* you\'re getting this sort of disinformation, but it is
patently untrue.  Women in Muslim countries certainly don\'t have the same
advantages or opportunities as women in the Western world do, but then
neither do women in Latin America--a primarily Catholic region.  Both
Pakistan and Turkey have had female prime ministers (which is certainly
better than the U.S. has done), and women attend universities and enter
professions such as medicine and academia alongside men.  In Algeria, women
participated in the struggle to kick the French out and in the West Bank and
Gaza, women have been involved in the intifada.  It is true that in most
Muslim countries, women are encouraged to stay at home and people try to
segregate of the sexes, but that doesn\'t justify sweeping generalizations
like yours.  (In fact, in the Gulf, efforts to segregate men and women have
resulted in *more* professional opportunities for women, since only a woman
doctor should examine a woman and separate banks have been set up with only
female customers and only female employees).

As a side note, I find it interesting that this subject came up right after
a call to squelch a racist group on usenet.  Over the past few years, it\'s
seemed to me that prejudice against Arabs and other Muslim peoples is one of
the few brands of racism that\'s still considered acceptable.

Actually, I\'ve heard one theory that in order to provide a middle-class
American standard of living to the 5-6 billion we have now, it would take
the resouces of *12* additional Earths.  Of course, _Traveller_ is science
*fiction* and is optimistic enough to suggest new industries and better ways
to use resources will arrive with higher technology levels.

Also, Phil, in another post you asked why there was so little edible food on
Vland when adventurers usually have a good chance of hunting down something
edible.  Just because 80% (to pick a random figure; I don\'t recall what the
rules say) of carbon-based animal and plant life in the galaxy is edible by
humans doesn\'t mean that 80% of the animal and plant life on any given
*planet* is edible.  The Vilani could very well have just gotten unlucky (or
lucky; would they have gotten anywhere if they didn\'t have to cooperate?)
and gotten stuck with a really rough planet.  There\'s pretty strong evidence
scattered throughout _Traveller_ products that something like this is the
case.  The Vargr didn\'t get quite as bad a deal.  There\'s plenty of edible
food on Lair, but most of it just doesn\'t appeal to the Vargr palatte (which
is why most Vargr food tastes like Cajun blackened vindaloo).

Consider that all carbon-based races can apparently eat the same food.
Sometimes in race descriptions, it has said clearly that races can eat human
food and vice versa, and when not stated explicitly, it\'s strongly implied.
I can\'t think of any race for which a ship\'s captain would have to bring
special food stores.  Of course, I don\'t think it\'s likely that a Vargr and
a K\'Kree would swap lunches, but such dietary differences are far less
radical than some among different animals on Earth.

But the Solomani didn\'t have cloning! Its not available even for body parts
until after TL12 (the highmark at the *end* of the Interstellar Wars!). Another
strike for the five "p\'s" being ignored in Traveller ... and another gaping
hole in the continuity!

What exactly does it say in "Solomani & Aslan"? Does it *definitively* refer
to the Nth Interstellar War period? Does it explain why a TL/16+ tech is
available at between TL/9 and TL/12?

OK, accepted. However, in *all* the advanced (and most of the non-advanced)
human societies presented in all versions of Traveller, women are treated as
full equals (yes, there are some exceptions, but they are all, AFAIR, backward
societies). In the rules, the assumption has been from the start that any of
the careers is available equally to men and women. Sure, you can argue that
Miller and the rest were influenced by western feminism ... but so what? it
is, after all, *their* future ... and in it, women have full equality taken for
granted.

That\'s one thing. Then there\'s another that you aren\'t considering ... given
the known history of the Terran Federation, it is fairly obvious that it is
going to be western dominated. After all, who will foot the bills for all those
neat spaceships ... Bangladesh? Nope, the US, the EEC, Japan, and the like.
Sure, you can assume that some of the Asian "tiger" economies will play a part
-- however, the trends are there (and seem to be of *very* considerable worry
to their leaders!) that they are wanting more and more what we in the West take
for granted ... democracy, equality etc. It seems a virtual certainty that they
will become more and more like us, at least in these matters ... and those that
don\'t obviously have no impact on the society of the future, and so can be
considered to be failures.

Then, consider this ... if you\'re planning a new colony, you want to make sure
that *all* of the adult inhabitants are skilled and pulling their weight ...
can you afford to give non-feminist traditionally oriented women the space when
you could have a family that has two skills for the price of one? Who is more
likely to be able to afford the fare, if such is the way of getting offplanet?
A family with one breadwinner or one with two?

Nope, your explanation doesn\'t seem (to me, anyway) to work in this instance.

The plague of Duskir is mentioned in "Solomani and Aslan" in the
chapter labelled "History of the Solomani Peoples." It occured AFTER the
Rule of Man (ie, 2nd Imperium) was established; it was one of the
contributions to its downfall.

The population of the US is several times the population of the UK, its
parent nation. This pop was achieved in under 300 years. The population
of the earth doubled in the last 40 years. The rate of growth is slower
now for many reasons, several of which you point out, but it need not
stay slow. Even assuming the continued enhancement of the equality of
women, it is still likely that women will want to have children (and men
will too.) Maybe even alot of children, if the economy encourages it.

Immigration from the Vegan district and from the 1st Imperium is also a
possibility.

>My solution in both cases -- the history that we have been told of by the

This is certainly a good explanation, but I think others are possible
too.

----

The real mystery to me is how did they conquer the Vilani? Two
possibilities present themselves:

1) The Vilani Population was unusually low. But why? I don\'t
find the plague argument very convincing either.

2) Many of the Vilani almost wanted to be conquered. The TC
government just looked that much better to the Vilani "voters" who were
fighting in the trenches.

Other possibilities exist of course. I just happened to think of these
two.

Of course, this begs the question, did they really beat the Vilani?

Traditionally, the Traveller background has made the assumption that most
life in Charted Space seems to be on the most basic level very similar --
most life uses DNA or close analogues, and basic amino acids.  In addition,
since the wide spread of humaniti is due to Ancient intervention, in most
cases supporting sources of food were presumably also transported.

Heck, if we\'ve already accepted hyperdrive and Ancient astronauts visiting
the Earth, I think I can cope with this, too.

  I never said anything about cloning - Rats & Cats says "artificial
wombs."  The implication is that the eggs and sperm were obtained from
human donors, were mixed, and then put in an artificial womb.  This is
not much of a stretch from current tech - it is already possible to
extract eggs from a human donor, fertilize them, and then implant them in
a human host.  Prenatal units can already handle premature babies of less
than a pound - I\'d have to say a fully artificial process is possible in
the near term.

  Yes, this refers to the Nth War period.  Again, it does not say
"cloning," so I suppose I was technically incorrect in saying that was
"canon" - what I really meant was that GenAssist developed tech that
bypassed normal childbirth.

  What is even more interesting is the potential this has for the
long-term social patterns of these "tuber" colonies - places where all
reproduction is done artificially and folks see natural childbirth as
"primitive" and "disgusting" - imagine the flak a pregnant PC might get!

The problem of races finding food on other planets is not as big
as some have made it out to be.  While it is true that the biology of
other worlds is unlikely to make things there easily digestible by any
given race, there are ways around this.  When the ancients transplanted
races to other worlds, they need not have transplanted a bunch of edible
species with them.  Instead, they simply could have created some
intestinal flora/fauna which aided in digestion.  We do a similar (though
simpler) sort of thing today for people with lactose intolerance.  In
fact, the reason _we_ are able to digest things is because of help from
our intestinal symbiotes.  For a different world, you just have to make a
different set of intestinal symbiotes which are capable of breaking down
and building up the local foodstuffs into the required basic components,
which are going to be the same everywhere in the universe.  These
intestinal symbiotes are passed from mother to child (IIRC), so you just
have to "infect" the initial inhabitants with them and off you go.

Not totally true, the Geonee of Shiwonee are a tech level G civilization
which is described as extremely sexist (See Trav Digest # 11).  They are,
however, the only sexist hi-tech human society mentioned (I think).

Re: 1)

We know from Vilani and Vargr that Vilani have extra-long lifespans (say,
200 years for a pure-bred Vilani); I assume (and I\'ve no proof of this)
that this longevity is due to Ancient tinkering. It seems reasonable to
assume that the Ancients may also have taken action to reduce Vilani
breeding speed. In addition, since food was either scarce or very difficult
to prepare during early Vilani history, children would probably have been
far more widely spaced.

There is of course no canon backing for this assumption, but it would
provide an explanation for slow Vilani population growth.

The MegaTraveller Journal #1 has the following to say about the Sword =
Worlds:

"Sword World culture, though technically diverse from world to world, =
has many points of common ground. The culture is highly militaristic and =
male-dominated. Obedience and honor are highly stressed attributes."

- MTJ #1, p. 25

This doesn\'t sound quite as sexist as the Geonee, and one can argue over =
the Sword Worlds being \'hi-tech\', but I just thought I\'d add this =

I am assuming that Rats & Cats was *very* late DGP stuff ... I\'d never even
heard of it before ... like the "Sparklers" I\'ve seen mentioned quite
negatively on this mailing list. I can understand why ... DGP didn\'t do their
homework! Apart from there being no (even vague) intimation of anything like
this elsewhere in the canon *and* it being impossible (MTrav Referees
Compendium) to even clone *body parts* until TL13 (which occurs either right at
the end of the Nth Interstellar war, in which case it isn\'t in time; or
*after* it, in which case it also isn\'t possible) ... Genetic Engineering isn\'t
available until TL14, and Partial Memory Transfer (Dupe) isn\'t available until
TL18, it doesn\'t gel with anything else in anything we\'ve ever been told about
the Terran Federation or even the Solomani. It seems like the last dying gasp
of DGP more than anything else!

It seems like DGP realised that there was a major discrepancy, but came up with
something completely wrong to "fix" it!

Why can\'t I make such a statement? What are the chances of life randomly
evolving on completely separate worlds being so close to that of other worlds
as to be edible? So astronomically large *against* it occurring *UNLESS* you
accept something like the Panspermia hypothesis that it is pointless even
considering any other evolutionary explanation. Or, perhaps, Grandfather wasn\'t
the *first* "Ancient"?

There is no evidence in any of the Traveller material that food is difficult to
find on most planets -- and the Animal Encounter rules (IIRC) assume that
larger animals can be hunted down and used for food. Not possible on Vland, but
possible *everywhere* else? Seems like you *have* to accept Panspermia - which
inevitably means that the argument about the Plague of Duskir (and nobody\'s
come up with a reliable reference to this *yet* ... was *IT* also from some
late term DGP nightmare?) is unlikely (and the Plague occurred *after* the war
in any case!).

But you haven\'t dealt with the specific point! *IF*, as I contend *must* be the
case, the Vilani encounter hundreds of worlds where the local life forms are
edible by humans (and where local human races, major or minor, already exist),
then there is *no* justification whatsoever for the claim that the Plague of
Duskir would have had any real effect so late in their history. By then they
would have had so much disease experience from other worlds in their imperium
that any early false starts caused by lack of coherent biology on Vland would
be meaningless in the overall scheme of things. It\'s a *major* logical
inconsistency ... assuming that you accept the Plague of Duskir as canon, and
I\'m beginning to suspect that it should *not* be accepted as such as it seems
like it (just as Rats & Cats seems to be) was a late term DGP aberration
completely at odds with the basic rules/concepts of the background/game.

Well, this *directly* contradicts MTrav Referees Companion, pages #28 and #32.
I would take formally GDW published material as being canon over DGP publsihed
stuff as a matter of course *when there is such a direct contradiction*. There
seems to be no justification for taking what basically was dumped by GDW as
canon. If GDW didn\'t publish it, they probably didn\'t fully (if at all) approve
of it.

Aha! Confirmation at last! The Plague of Duskir is *NOT* GDW canon - it\'s in
one of the later DGP Digests! If we are going to treat the "sparklers" with
contempt, I guess the fact that Rats and Cats and the Plague *both* are DGP
products from *late* in their existence, just before GDW dumped them (or
whatever actually happened), *and* that they go against -- *directly* against
in the case of the relevant technology -- accepted GDW material, then both must
be regarded with a *great* deal of suspicion, and probably discarded as
*non-canon*!

OK! When the Milieu Book of Trav4 comes out on the Interstellar war period,
*and* supports Duskir/Rats and Cats (*IF* it does provide such support -- and
*IF* it explains how the Terrans had TL13/18 tech at Tech 12 and earlier!),
*then* I\'ll go for your arguments! In the meantime, nope. Ref\'s Companion
contradicts it, and I\'ll take Ref\'s companion over later DGP stuff any time!

Yes, I\'ve read the Imperial Encyclopaedia and have Imperium as well. To which I
say, "so what"? The question here is, how big could the Terran Federation *be*
at the time of first contact, and then during the wars? My position is that
there is a *major* discrepancy here. And so what if the local Vilani Governor
had limited resources ... if he had a umpteen times larger population and
inudustrial base than the Terrans then he had a major advantage. In any case,
even the introduction of Jump3 ships would not have been enough in and of
itself *unless* the Terrans had a force that was already close to parity with
the Vilani (and the Vilani were using the whole of the Imperium\'s forces by
this time). How did they do it with less people?

My suggestion -- for a given TL, Terran *Industry* was *vastly* more efficient
and productive than Vilani *industry*. This meant that the Terrans could have
many more ships and much larger armies than the Vilani for the same population.
This seems to be one of the few (I\'d say *only* -- but it\'s my pet idea, so I\'m
biased!) explanations that make any sense, or so I think, FWIW.

But Rats and Cats is suspect at best, as it directly contradicts MTrav Referees
Companion. So the women would *still* have had small families. Even if R&C was
true ... who in the hell is going to look after all those kids? Memory Dupes
(even at a crude level) are stated as being a TL/16 technology (from MTrav
Referees Companion again).

But, as I\'ve now been able to point out, the *DGP* explanation is *EXTREMELY*
suspect as to whether it can or should be regarded as "canon"!

Sure, but one species\' disease is anothers benign bacteria. Also, allow for
thousands of years of development in isolation. Diseases do mutate into
harmlessness over a period of time ... and, therefore, we can assume that
previously harmless bacteria do the opposite. The disease doesn\'t even have to
be fatal to trigger Vilani medical science - a nice debilitating long term
disease, or one that weakens permanently but doesn\'t necessarily kill, or one
that simply takes a *long* time to kill ... think Influenza, Polio, Syphilis
style nasties. If they were reasonably infectious, then it seems that the
Vilani are *going* to have to deal with medical science at a sophisticated
level *regardless* of the evolution of life on Vland ... unless they forgo an
interstellar empire and *remain* on Vland. They can\'t simply quarantine every
system that has such a disease ... they have to try to find *some* sort of
cure.

Doubtful. The Vilani had a much larger empire ... ergo, a *much* larger pool of
diseases for which the Terrans would have just as much resistance as the Vilani
would for Terran diseases.

Sorry again, the tech required for Rats & Cats just wasn\'t available at the
time of the Interstellar wars. It contradicts Referees Companion, and this,
being a GDW pub, should be regarded as definitive compared to a dubious late
DGP publication.

OK. You have artificial wombs. So what? How does it solve the problem? Sure,
you get a *lot* more babies ... but you\'re begging the question of *who looks
after them*? Memory Dupe technology is TL/16+ so *someone* has to ... for at
least five or six years, and that\'s not allowing for education and the like.
Who feeds those who look after them? Who provides all these nonproductive
mouths with food, clothing, shelter, consumer goods? Sure, "real" people are
*an* answer -- but a *realistic* one? No way! How many people are going to
lower their living standards so drastically as this would seem to require just
to win a war ... wars may not be fought to increase ones living standards, but
I reckon a damn good case for them being fought to *defend* ones living
standards could be made.

Either you have to assume that terran *industrial* production tech was vastly
more efficient than that of the vilani ... my preferred solution, in which case
there probably isn\'t any need for the R&C "solution", dubious as it is ... or,
well, how else do you explain it? Short answer? you can\'t!

The problem *still* stands, though may perhaps be on a slightly different
emphasis.

Yes, and note that they are having no effect! They may be slowing the rate of
slowing of population increase. Also note that, AFAIR, *Italy* - *the* catholic
country - has a declining level of population, even though the use of the Pill
and of Condoms is evidently not terribly popular there. So, so what?

But you then run into the problem that raising children takes time. Or, at
least, assuming that you have (or wish to have) children *you* would want to
spend some time with them? The more children you have, the more the woman is
going to be tied down (or, let\'s not be sexist, the *man* just as likely)
caring for them even if she doesn\'t have to carry them to term ... babies take
a lot of looking after! So *this* interferes with her career *far* more than
the actual 9 months of pregnancy ... and how much of this will they be prepared
to put up with? I would suggest that the likely average family size is going to
be around 2-3, and this is below replacement rate for a stable high level of
population. And your claim that a colonial society would allow for more
resources per child makes no sense on the above basis.

Don\'t be sorry, it\'s good to see the different ideas! I think the intellectual
exercise of the argument is more fun than the topic itself, in general!

But the Panspermia theory is intended to deal with the ridiculously,
humungously, outrageously large chance *against* any given planet developing
any sort of food edible by organisms from any other such planet. The chance is
so infinitesimally small that there is, realistically, no chance at all of
Terrans finding edible food "on the hoof" (or even after a great deal of
processing) on *any* planet. So, the problem Vland has should be the problem
faced on *all* worlds ... but it isn\'t! *This* is the problem.

Sure, you can assume a much wider distribution of ancient transplanted *terran*
organisms, but this defeats the claims for the nastiness of the Plague of
Duskir, which has been the alleged "canonical" explanation for the succes of
the Terrans. However, this simply means that the Vilani would inevitably have
been exposed widely to Terran disease organisms ... or terran *compatible*
disease organisms *well* before they dealt with terra. And they would have had
to have developed the medical knowledge to deal with such diseases ... and
this means that any deficiency in Vilani medical science would have been
pre-Starflight.

Ergo, Panspermia *must* be right ... and, ergo, Vilani medical knowledge *must*
have been good enough to deal with the alleged Plague of Duskir!

What page? I had a *close* look at a friends copy of the above, in fact, we
*both* pored over it for an hour or so, and we couldn\'t find any mention of
it. Doesn\'t mean it isn\'t there ... it may well have been a forest for the
trees effort! However, it also may have been a one line mention - or, as a
number of other people have been now claiming, it was in some of the late
DGP Digests or Adventures such as Rats & Cats which I have strong reason to
doubt about their canonicity (?!).

OK, so the population of the colonies in 300 years will be 250,000,000 - I can

Sure! Undoubtedly! But you have to be careful that they don\'t have worse holes
in them than the one I\'ve picked up on ... and all the ones to date certainly
seem to! The beauty (or flaw, take your pick) of a "mother of all conspiracy
theories" is that by its very nature it can pick on flaws in *your* arguments
and ignore flaws in its own!

This is perhaps a good theory. Still, such "defeatism" would have had to have
developed over a long period of time. I doubt that the Terrans could have
beaten the Vilani at all for any extended period if the severe problems with
population differences exist, as it seems they must.

> Of course, this begs the question, did they really beat the Vilani?

If they didn\'t, then who did? (Aha! I sense an even bigger conspiracy theory
coming on! Maybe the Vilani fooled those unsophisticated Terrans into merely
*thinking* they\'d won, and then set about absorbing them into their culture
without them realising it? How devious!)

Which leaves the Plague of Duskir out on a limb that someone is using a

1) An artificial womb is simpler than cloning, TL 10-11 seems quite
reasonable

2) From The Traveller\'s Digest # 12 page 37 (hardly a dying gasp product).
" Crude full-body cloning of lower life-forms first occurs at tech level
8. The ability to reliably create higher life forms (such as humans)
doesn\'t occur until TL 10.  The donors cell is placed in an artificial
womb -and the clone grows at the same rate as any normal offspring.  At
the end of the normal gestation period the clone is removed from the womb.
The result: a normal, healthy newborn baby, but with one parent...

Using growth quickening techniques (also a typical tech level 10
development) an "adult" full-body clone (roughly equivalent to 20 years of
age) can be grown in an artificial womb in about 2 years...

It is important to not that such a clone, although possessing an adult
body, will have the mind of a newborn baby, since it has had no exposure
to the outside."

If by clone you mean physical and mental duplicate of a person, no, that\'s
TL 17 or 18.  If you simply mean artificially grown physical duplicate, TL
10 does it.

Remember, basic cloning produces a fertilize egg which will naturally grow
into a human (or other) infant.  Learning to modify this cell so that it
instead only produces and arm or an eye is rather more complicated.  Today
we can clone lower animals, and we have no idea how to clone only and eye.

Any further questions?

Because it depends on a level of knowledge that we just don\'t have.
You are, of course, free to _presume_ that it is true for your own
uses (it isn\'t contradicted by what we know), but to claim that
other approaches aren\'t realistic can\'t be supported by our current
level of understanding.

Again, you can\'t make this statement.  There is no factual basis for
either supporting it or denying the premise.  It may be that life
is so ubiquitous that life exists in almost every system (if we
were to find out that life once existed on Mars, that would go a
long way toward supporting such a view) and it also may be
that it is extremely rare.

That fact is that we know nothing about other biospheres.  It is quite
possible that life has to follow a general plan that makes thing
_generally_ edible, but on Vland most species use and enzyme that
happens to be toxic to humans.

I don\'t see this.  Aside from the fact that you don\'t have to invoke panspermia,
I see nothing that precludes the Plague of Duskir in it.

I have delt with the point.  I\'ll try and be more clear.  What you
are saying hold generally true for microbial infections (bacteria
and the like) since that ability humans to eat food on other worlds
does imply the ability to be infected by microbes that also "eat"
in that biosphere.  However, it _doesn\'t_ apply to viral infections.
It is quite possible that humans can only catch viruses from Terran
species.

>... assuming that you accept the Plague of Duskir as canon

I don\'t know if the Plague of Duskir is "canon".  It do think it should
be (except that it should be, if my understanding is right, moved up
to earlier than it presented).  It would go a long way toward explaining
a Terran victory (especially if combined with simultaneous Vargr raid
and various Rebelious fleet captains intent on seizing control of the
First Imperium for themselves.).

  Based on Phil\'s comments, I should add that the children are raised by
robots and a few human minders.  Education is by "subliminal tapes", not
any sort of TL16 memory transfer.

  Oh boy, I like this a lot!  What a great plot hook - the odd fellow who
can eat tree bark and like it!  By the time of the Third Imperium, I\'d
suppose these flora would have been passed around, so there would be few
differences between different human races.  Of course, there\'s always
that possibility of an unexpected incompatibility when you meet some new
community - I wonder if Scout equipment lockers stock adult diapers?

  By the way, Rats & Cats provides some support for this position:
"GenAssist first sought to genetically alter Terran and alien lifeforms
so that food supply was not a problem."  p. 20.

  Come on, DGP _wrote_ MegaTraveller, for crying out loud.  Their stuff
is cannon - frankly, it\'s better than a lot of GDW stuff as far as
consistency goes (anyone want to go another round on jump torpedoes?  I
didn\'t think so).  Again, as I point out above, the Solomani _did not use
cloning_.  They used artificial wombs and robot nannies, well within the
tech capability of the time.  If you do not agree with this fine - just
stop talking about "cloning" and "memory transfer" - there is no
reference to the Solomani using these technologies.

  The arguement made in several sources is that the Vilani did not have
animal models to experiment on to develop drugs and such.  As a result,
medical developments were stunted, since humans did not share the
genetics of the animals around them.

  Actually, I think that issue of Traveller\'s Digest was out before
MegaTraveller was even published (man do I wish I had my collection here
for reference!), so the article may actually be about Classic Traveller
medical rules.  In any case, there are no contradictions between the
material in Rats & Cats and other Traveller material - no references to
cloning, as I pointed out above.

  Again, there is no contradiction - the Terrans _did not_ use cloning.

  Imperium does support your position to some extent - Terran planets do
give higher production numbers than their Imperial counterparts.  The
difference is far from "vast" however.

  I think we will just have to agree to disagree on this point, I think -
I find cannon explanations acceptable, you don\'t, so what?

  Again, there is no contradiction.  There is no mention of memory dupes
in Rats & Cats.  Children are raised in an institutional setting by a few
adults and robots - family size desires by the population have nothing to
do with it.

  Again, incorrect - there is no mention of cloning in DGP sources on the
Solomani.

  I never thought of that, but I suppose it\'s true.  Too bad we don\'t get

Australian show would be.

  It\'s on page 22, left hand column, middle of the page.  By the way,
"Rats & Cats" is slang for "Solomani & Aslan" - your message above
indicates you may not know this.

  I\'ve been a net lurker for a while, and have not been able to follow the

that the
Vilani empire was in a state of decay. After all, it had been aroud for
thousands of
years without ever having a serious foe. Without an external foe for so long,
there was
probably little to keep the V\'s a cohesive, cooperative unit. If the Terrans
won a few
early victories, elements within the Vilani Empire may have taken the chance
to break
away from the central authority, and set up on their own. Perhaps even in
nominal
alliance with the Terrans. Think of it as the V empire surviving mainly on
inertia and
needing only a little shove to topple. If this were the case, we might expect
that the
Rule of Man to be similar to the Holy Roman Empire, with a lot of local
autonomy
and little cohesiveness there also, as the Terrans would not have the numbers
to really
enforce their will, but would stay in power for a while since they would be
convienent
for the local powers as a non-threatening central authority that could keep
conflicts
from getting out of hand. I would suspect that such an organization would not

"Rats & Cats" is the nickname for "Solomani & Aslan", in case that wasn\'t
clear.  It was the last (and only second) alien module they put out.

I think you\'re confused about what people mean by cloning.  By "full" clone,
we\'re talking about a complete *body* which will is born/decanted and then
will be raised and subject to the same stimuli that form all the other
individual personalities in the universe.  It is only "selective cloning of
replacement parts" that has to wait until TL13.  It makes a lot of sense for
body part cloning to be a much *later* development than full-body cloning.
First, serious ethical problems would arise from cloning an entire sentient
being just to lop off a limb for a replacement.  Also, you\'ve got to make
the clone growth much faster.  If not, you\'ll always be significantly older
than your replacement and it just won\'t do you any good.  You seem to think
that the "full clones" we\'re talking about are carbon copies--same bodies,
same memories, same personality as the original.

Remember that in *real* earth history, numerous solutions have been applied
to the problem of raising basket-loads of kids.  You get older children to
look after them, or hired professionals, or sit them in front of a video
screen for hours a day.

I have a professor who told me that whenever somebody says "it must have
been", that\'s a code for "I have no evidence" :) (not a dig--just a humorous
aside).  Like I say, the Vilani just got stuck with a bad planet.  I
understand your attacks on the innovations from DGP, but the idea of the
Vilani having poor medical knowledge has been tied up with their identity
for as long as I\'ve seen published material on them.  See Imperial
Encyclopedia, p.45.

This is an interesting exercise in future history, but why do we care?  It
won\'t matter a hill of beans in my campaign whether the Vilani lost because
of plagues, population, or superior Solomani ball bearings.

Dear Folks -

1.FLEET JUMPING IN MT

This is actually in _Megatraveller Journal #2_, not number 1. (But thank you
Mark, for pointing me in the right direction. I *knew* I read that reference
somewhere, but it escaped my filing system. I\'ve now noted it in big letters!).

2.INVADING FLEETS

Actually, you can use an easy trick to ignore all need for your calculations.
The SOM says that a good navigator can program a jump vector so that it evens
out your momentum in relation to the destination system, even reducing your
relative velocities to zero.

However, I think that this trick should at least increase the navigation
difficulty by one level!

Terran industrial capacity:

     One important aspect seems to have been left out here. I recall reading
(in CT book 8 robots I think) that the TC made extensive use of robots and
automated factories in their expansion, particularly for outposts. This
becomes even more important at the end of the wars when the TC was at TL12.

     Using robots etc expands your industrial capacity without the need for
a corresponding increase in population. This is great in wartime but might
not be so good in peacetime when it puts people out of work!

     This "left over" industrial capacity would have kept going for a while
after the wars at the same time that the Vilani economy was collapsing under
the strain of the vast social changes brought about by Solomani insistence
on "improving" things.
This would have allowed the Solomani to gain substantial economic advantages
and take over large amounts of Vilani industry. This situation seems to have
persisted into the Third Imperium (and explains just _how_ the Solomani
Nobility got control of such a large proportion of the Imperial economy).

Beating the Vilani:

     The Vilani had been stagnating for thousands of years by the time the
Terrans came along. They had suppressed technological advancement for so
long that a general suppression of innovation of ANY sort was probably in
force. Most Vilani would have been horrified at the notion of doing
something completely new!

     However those things they did know how to do they would have known how
to do _very_ well indeed! Warship designs would have been standardised
centuries ago and the tactics to be used codified and learnt as _the_ way
things were done.
The more experience the commander had the more of these tactics the
commander would know, like the "forms" in martial arts.
Thus the Vilani should have had a decisive qualitative as well as
quantitative advantage.
However given the political turbulence of the First Imperium at the time of
encountering the Terrans many of the commanders would be political
appointees with dubious ability.
Also the Terrans would have innovated like mad and found good tactics to use
against the more common Vilani "book" tactics.

     The TC advance to TL 12 stuffed the Vilani because this was something
completely new to which much of the "book" did not apply.
This allowed the Terrans to break out and defeat the Vilani much more
quickly and decisively than would otherwise have been the case.

Note on Vilani food supply and disease:

     The Shulagii (sp?) who held the "secrets to food preparation" on Vland
retained their hold on food production even when other sources were found.
The widespread disruption to Vilani society and commerce during and after
the Wars could have caused food shortages which lowered the Vilani immunity
to disease and actual starvation on inhospitable worlds!

The Robot rules work quite well with MT.  In fact, a lot of what\'s included
as robot design is identical to MT vehicle design.  The Robot supplement
mainly adds rules for designing and programming the robot brain, and rating
robots in terms of UPP\'s.  If you use some combination with the MT vehicle
design rules, multiply all figures for "hit points" by a factor of ten, or
you\'ll have robots that fall to pieces in front of body pistols (which isn\'t
how they\'re supposed to work).

Anyway, if you can\'t find that, other rules are found in _Best of JTAS_ I,
and in _Traveller\'s Digest_ 1-3.  There was an article in _Dragon_ magazine
about building robots in _Traveller_, too, but I don\'t remember when.  It
was a *long* time ago, though.

Well, perhaps. However, note my practical objections to the idea of Tuber
colonies presented in answer to other posts ... obviously another of those
completely (not!) thought through DGP ideas.

This is *directly* contradicted by MTrav Referee\'s Compendium. It states that
Partial Cloning (Body Parts) is unavailable until TL/13. I take official GDW
products as taking precedence over any non-GDW product.

Yes, unfortunately, you end up with a 20 year old *body* with the mind of a
newborn ... or, perhaps, depending on how the forced growth is done, two year
old. And, as far as I am aware, this is *not* contradicted by DGP, according
to the Referee\'s Companion, TL/16 (pg. 32) Successful brain transplants become
possible. Memory transfer is developed, although it is not yet reliable." In
other words, the clone cannot be provided with a "personality", or "memories"
or "skills" or "knowledge" until TL/16 *at the earliest*. Now. As you may or
may not know, the human brain had definite developmental stages that it goes
through as it ages (I did this as part of my teaching credentials 20 years ago,
so I may be a bit rusty on the details) ... and some of these, such as the
development of speech (or alternatives thereto, such as signing for the deaf)
takes place very early on in the piece and *cannot* be "jumped" ... if you
don\'t gain language skills by the time that particular part of the brain has
been developed *you never do*! (Think of the French boy found to have been
raised by wolves, and more recent cases of child abuse resulting in complete
isolation from human society for a couple of cases in the US ... none of the
children ever learned to do more than speak a couple of disjointed words. And
the wolf boy evidently never even progressed that far) Sorry. Even if we take
the dubiously "canon" material of DGP as opposed to "official" GDW
publications, then it falls flat on its face as far as this area goes anyway.
Even if the forced growth is combined with some sort of socialisation as it
proceeds, then you have a 20 year old body with a 2 year old mind and
personality ... and who in the hell takes care of it 24 hours a day, educates
it etc. Sorry, it becomes impractical to the point of ridiculousness.

Which makes the processes of Tuber colonies wuite impractical. Ask anyone who
has to deal with adult morons and cretins (in the technical definition) ...
I have worked (and still do) with people who work with such people on a part
time basis, and, believe me, from what they tell me, only a true saint would
have the patience, and a muscular wrestler (well, almost!) the brawn, to deal
with them when they get stroppy. You are expecting us to believe that you can
create a viable society using such techniques ... sorry, not believable.

So says DGP. GDW says different. I believe that GDW "official" products are
generally accepted as overruling DGP products as far as "canonicity" goes.

GDW still says TL/13. DGP doesn\'t count.

> Any further questions?

Yep, explain exactly who works in the factories, on the farms, in the offices
etc. if everyone has a 20 year old (at least one) with a 2 year old brain and
personality to look after it. Sorry, I can\'t see any society doing this
voluntarily, not even to win an interstellar war. And you can\'t force them
to do it, not unless you commit huge resources to, so to speak, "watch the
watchers". In other words, it\'s totally impractical (even leaving out the fact
that it seems to be anti-canon).

Well, everything I\'ve ever read on the subject in the way of *science* seems to
make the point I have been ... unless we assume something like "Panspermia"
then the chances of anything we ever discover being edible is unlikely in the
extreme. Just think of the "handedness" problems in proteins (?) where a mirror
image protein (?) is *eatable* (perhaps) but has no food value at all. And
that\'s just one of the possible (probable!) problems that random evolution
could throw up (and *will*, as far as we can figure) to make alien lifeforms
completely useless as food for terrans.

I\'m sorry? There\'s no factual basis for it? There\'s a damn good *mathematical*
basis for it! The chances (probability theory here) of any random development
of life evolving in a form that will be edible to any other life-form that has
been developed in complete isolation is so close to zero, obviously, that it
needs no calculation. Only if something like "panspermia" is accepted is there
a realistic chance that any given life-bearing world will have edible food on
it for Terrans. Your saying that I can\'t make the statement is a complete
nonsense.

Yes, but probabilities are such that this is astronomically *unlikely*. So
unlikely that Vland is either weird because it\'s the exception, or everywhere
else has the same problem. Since the latter is *not* the case in Traveller,
then the problem is that Vland is weird ... and everywhere else has Terran
compatible lifeforms, ergo they will develop diseases capable of preying on
Terran descended life-forms ... and this makes a nonsense of the argument
that the Vilani were still suffering from any real medical lag when they met
the Terrans. It therefore makes the Plague of Duskir (which happened *after*
the collapse of the Empire anyway) a non-explanation for the Terran victory
despite the smaller Terran population and it makes the inability of the Vilani
to deal with it most likely to be a result of the sort of societal chaos that
inevitably results from the loss of a war such as the Interstellar wars.
In other words, GenAssist is a DGP fantasy, just like the "sparklers", and is
rightfully rejected as completely non-canon.

Well, if you don\'t, I think we\'ll have to agree to disagree as I cannot see how
anyone can be so dense and lacking in basic scientific knowledge as to *not* see
that it *must* be the case ... and you obviously think much the same, but in
reverse. We have no basis for argument, so there\'s no point in carrying it
further.

As I understand it, Viruses are based on incomplete RNA strands that have to
use human (or terran animal) cells to complete their "life" cycle. How can you
not see that such a development *must* be the logical corollary of Panspermia?
If all life has been spread evenly throughout the galaxy from a single source,
it cannot be other than that most (if not all) worlds where it has been spread
must have viruses as well. And, in any case, does it say that the Plague of
Duskir was only a virus?

Agreed, it *would* explain things - *EXCEPT* for the logical fallacy that GDW
has perpetrated in allowing/assuming all worlds except Vland to be home to
Terran edible organisms! For the reasons noted above. And, in any case, it
*isn\'t* canon, and it *didn\'t* occur earlier. Wishful thinking on your part is
just that, wishful thinking!

What\'s wrong with pointing out the flaws in the background? As the rules have
been written, and as they have been expanded, over the years, Jump Torps *are*
possible. Just as USL ships *are* capable of landing on worlds with an
atmosphere. The prohibitions against them are both contradicted in numerous
places. Sure. I\'ll even agree that the *intention* of GDW was to not allow
JTorps or USL landings on atmosphere planets ... unfortunately, they\'ve
put so many holes in their rules by trying to add what I regard as needless
chrome that they contradict their own prohibitions. It\'s called being too smart
for one\'s own good.

This *may* be another such case. However, since the only evidence that supports
*your* side of the story is DGP stuff that cannot be regarded as 100% canon,
then it is much more of a grey area.

What Robots? According to Book #8: Robots, it is only at TL/12 that the first
self-mobile computer brain with developed manipulative appendages (i.e. a
robot) finally becomes an economic and commercial reality. AI software can be
developed, but cost and size are limiting factors ... remember Aybee (?) from
the DGP Digests? He was, what, TL/16? And *he* was not AI in any real sense -
and this was made plain on a considerable number of occasions ... like every
issue! So, at TL/12-13 there *are* no Robots. Sorry to puncture your balloon!

Also, note that it is plainly stated that Memory transfer is not available
until TL/16 ... subliminal teaching is a crock that doesn\'t work here and now
and is not mentioned anywhere in Traveller ... certainly not in any of the
"official" GDW publications.

Unfortunately this means, technically speaking, that they are unlikely to be of
the same species any more ... they will be Homo Sapiens *XXX* (name of specific
planet) rather than Homo Sapiens Sapiens (i.e. *us*) ... and it is likely that
they will be as capable of interbreeding as Horses and Donkeys, or Lions and
Tigers ... all they wil produce (if they\'re lucky) are *mules*. I do not see
that a society that eventually develops the Solomani Party on one side and the
Society for the Soveriegnty of Man over Machine (and then classes cyborgs as
machines) on the other could spawn such a movement ... we\'re talking Nazi level
nasties here, kiddo!

Well, yes and no. They wrote MTrav under the aegis of GDW, and Miller et al
seem to have their names prominently on the design credits as well! So, the
stuff that GDW published was *approved* by GDW ... and anything that DGP
published obviously was not, or not to the same degree.

But they *did* have encounters with animals and humans from whom they could
contract diseases. So, once they start the empire they gain over any initial
stunting forced on them by the nature of Vlandish biology.

IIRC, I think that you are wrong in this ... the medical rules were definitely
for MTrav ... I remember being disappointed because, like MTrav, they were so
*backward* re available tech.

Well, maybe not. But they *had* to use Memory Dupe, a TL/16+ tech. Ergo, R&C is
still and always useless as a defence.

but Imperium is a boardgame. It tries to cover all of the Interstellar wars.
But it does not allow for the development of industry and, IIRC, doesn\'t really
cover the Nth Interstellar war, or, at least, not the penetration and collapse
stage, nor even the stage before that when teh Vilani committed their entire
available forces.

And, unfortunately, even the most cursory glance at Book #8, and a little

Sorry, you may be right. I was looking where I was originally pointed, which

Well, the Vilani weren\'t as successful as they thought they would be? Those

Possibly! However, you still run into the education/imprinting problem that I
mention above. And, in any case, why does GDW mention Partial Cloning and not
full cloning, it wasn\'t possible (AFAIK) when they did Mtrav

Well, yes. But they\'re not viable here. Sort of a chicken and the egg problem.
Where do the kids to do the childmining come from ... the tubers! So, who minds

Yes, I\'ll agree with your Prof on this one ... so I\'ll rephrase -- "Ergo,
Panspermia *is* right ... and, ergo, Vilani medical knowledge *was* good enough
to deal with the Plague of Duskir. And, note that what it says is *not* as
conclusive as you seem to think it is ...

"Consequently, the *PRIMITIVE* human society found no need for medically
oriented shaman. Vilani medical understanding was slow to develop because of
this."

COnsider what is actually being said. The *primitive* Vilani had no need for
medics ... why, because they\'d never been offworld. Does it say that the
"later" (starfaring) Vilani had no need for them? NO! Also, it says that their
medical understanding was slow to develop because of the lack of bacteria and
viruses that could harm them *on Vland*. Does it say that they were not able
to be harmed by the viruses and bacteria *off* Vland? NO! Surely there is
also a *strong* implication that they therefore may/must have developed quickly
up to speed once offplanet and exposed to the "normal" worlds with Terran
type food, bacteria, and viruses? Seems to me that this is left wide open and
is at least as valid an interpretation as the one you have accepted all this
time. Think about it!

Of course it doesn\'t matter a damn! Just as it doesn\'t matter whether the
Athenians tricked the Great King into fighting at Salamis or not. It\'s just
that it\'s a matter for interesting speculation ... and now that all these
new Milieu books are potentially coming out, a matter of *close* interest as
well!

Most of the members of this list seems to think the sparklers were a =

Personally, I think it would have been cool and I regret that it didn\'t =

Sparklers were part of DGP\'s plan for MT, before it was decided that GDW =

The Sparklers were supposed to be the same as the \'Primordials\'. These =

\'Knightfall\'. These aliens was a psionically and tecnologically very =

before the rise of the Ancients.

It was part of DGP\'s plan that they should return to charted space in =
the middle of the Rebellion, being such a threat to all sentient races =
that not only would the different factions of the Rebellion, but all =
sentient races, have to band together to defeat them.

This and much more was disclosed in the MegaTraveller Journal #4, =
because with the advent of TNE, nothing would ever come of it.

I don\'t recall the exact page, I think someone on this list said it was
p. 22; it was in a section of the module written in the voice a Solomani
historian giving his spin to Imperial history and the history of his own
confederation. The history is in chronological order; so the plague is
in the paragraphs following the description of Terra\'s defeat of the
Ziru Sirka.

Hmm... I don\'t seem to have made my point clear. I meant that if the US
could surpass the UK\'s population by three times in under three
centuries, the colonies could surpass Terra\'s by as much, in as much
time. So if Terra in AD2300 has a population of 15 G, the colonies could
easily have 45+ G.

In fact, if you use a doubling time of 50 years for our human population
(not at all an unreasonable period,) then there could be 5G times 64 =
320G Solomani in 300 years. No cloning, fake wombs, social engineering,
or exotic technology is needed, altho they won\'t hurt.

(By the way, "G" stands for Giga=10^9, not for Grand=10^3, in the
above paragraphs.)

In the MT Encyclopedia time line, it states that the Solomani used AI in

In fact, Book 8 "Robots" was written by the very people who founded DGP.
 No surprise that the design sequence resembles the MT craft design.  In
addition, "101 Vehicles" (also by DGP) provides an interesting twist.
They suggest allowing robot brains to replace computers (in small
vehicles anyway) and that robot brains have CP multipliers of 250(!) per
point of intelligence.  Even an Int 1, Edu 1 dumbot can reduce the
number of control panels in nearly all vehicles to a single panel, and
drive the thing too!

In my most recent campaign, robot brains became all the rage for
starships.  They allow a real "Star Trek" feel to ship operations where
you just talk to the ship and it does things for you.  Of course, I
wouldn\'t want a robot brain to be all that stands between me and hard
vacuum (or jumpspace) on a starship, though.  The robot brain at most
replaces one of the three computers normally required for a starship;
the regular computers prevent the robot brain from doing serious damage
if it malfunctions.  The CP requirements were used as listed in the
design sequence for purposes of installing panels and determining normal
crew requirements.  The robot brain\'s CP multiplier was used for
determining the absolute minimum number of crew in a pinch.  If I
remeber correctly, a robot brain with enough intelligence/education
and/or storage to be usable without Robot Ops skill, and have Pilot-2,
Nav-2, Engineer-2, Gunnery-1, ShipTactics-1 cost less than a model 3
computer.

sugars?

Until recently I assumed it was a 50:50 chance sort of thing, but new
research is providing some evidence that it may not be. As it turns out,
left and right handed molecules are *not* exactly equal in energy; a
left-handed protein made of protons, neutrons and electrons is the mirror
image of a right-handed protein made of positrons, anti-neutrons and
anti-protons i.e. an antimatter right-handed protein. The energy
differences are small but calculable, if one is fond of quantum
electrodynamics. (I\'m not, before anyone asks.)

What\'s interesting is that there\'s some evidence that these tiny energy
differences are somehow "cumulative" -- that all things being equal, you
will get noticeably more of a given handedness of a molecule over time
e.g. left-handed proteins will proliferate. It\'s analagous to the way
that evolution is often thought to work: tiny advantage per generation,
over successive generations, leads to a population which is predominantly
"advantaged". [I don\'t know if it\'s thought to work *exactly* that way,
or just in a similar way.] If this is true, then you\'d have left-handed
primordial soup, as it were, from which left-handed life would evolve.
Evidence for this includes a preponderance of one handedness of quartz
over another ( + optical rotation more common than -, or maybe vice versa)
in some deposits.

As you can see, I\'m not 100% up on the theory, but it seems there\'s a
basis for assuming life will almost all be the right way round,
chemically speaking. Thus, you don\'t *need* panspermia as a hypothesis
for this to be true (although you might want panspermia to be correct
anyway).

The woman doing the research is Dr. Alexandra MacDermott, here in
Cambridge, which is how I know about it.

Likely the wrote it because they had limited space, and the Referee\'s

technique.  Cloning a full human is not, it\'s reproduction via a different
method.  Notice that in-vitro fertilization is also not mentioned.
Full-body cloning is not an important medical advance, so it is simply not
listed.  Frankly your argument makes as much sense as arguing that since
electronic calculators are not mentioned under TL 7 Computer/ Robotics TL
7 societies can\'t create them.  This argument is getting old.

As for robot teachers, read Robots. At TL 11 High data robots are quite
possible.  You can only make dumbots, but they could do limited childcare
and simple teaching with a good staff of human attendants.  Aybee was
designed to imitate humans, sure, these things couldn\'t do that, they
could change diapers and (maybe) teach children spelling. Also, by TL 12
low autonomous robots are perfectly possible.  When the Terrans reached TL
12 the colonies could have used robots almost exclusively.

I\'m not sure what you have read so I can\'t comment on it.  I personally
happen to work in the field (disclaimer: I speak only for myself, not
for NASA or my employer!) and what you are say "has to be" is, in fact,
only one of several possiblities.

>Just think of the "handedness" problems in proteins (?) where a mirror
>image protein (?) is *eatable* (perhaps) but has no food value at all.

However, it is quite possible that one handedness works better.  The
fact is that we don\'t know where, or why, chirality arose.  Nobody
has made protiens of amino acids of the other isomer and we just
don\'t know if they form the requisite protiens.

Now I happen to agree that you would probably find biospheres randomly
distributed between the two isomers, but this is an _opinion_.  You
can\'t objectively claim it\'s right or wrong.

Here you are talking about what is _possible_ and slip in a _will_ without
support.  What you say is indeed _possible_.  You can\'t say, based
on what we know, that is _will_ happen.

I\'m sorry, this is just wrong.  You can\'t use probability theory when you
don\'t even know how probably the fundamental events are.  You have
_assume_ they are relatively unlikely and then used probability to
conclude that the probablility is "so close to zero".  The fact is
that, regardless of how much math you throw in, your conclusion
is no better than the base assumption.

Actually, even ignoring the problems with your position I mentioned above,
the fact that they Valani are trying to explain something that not only
doesn\'t make sense (and in fact, never happened), ie how they arose on
Vland and how they fit in, is going to fundamentally cripple progress.
For any theory they come up with, it\'s going to be pointed out that
it doesn\'t even work for the most important and well know test case.

[Note: I wish to point out that the following is sarcasm since it is quite
likely that Mr.McGregor will be unable to tell otherwise.]
Gee I guess I"m so laking in "basic scientific" knowledge as to only
be able to get a Ph. D. in Chemistry from M.I.T. (it\'s a "small
technical school in Massachusetts, perhaps you\'ve heard of it) and
been able to find employment as a scientist for 10 years (over 4
of which have been working in the field in question).  I guess
this pales in significance compared to what Mr. McGregor has
been able to pick up reading in his spare time.
[End of sarcasm.]

Your arrogance is impressive.  However, I would suggest that it
might be appropriate to show a little more humility toward your
own limitations and respect for those whom might disagree with you.

Ironically, this is an important point (which I\'ve been trying to make)
that does support the Vilani vulnerability to disease and does nothing
to require panspermia.  The fact is that the premise is that virus
for humans _aren\'t_ compatible with life from other biospheres.  This
means that you _don\'t_ have to invoke panspermia (or ancients, or
anything else) and it gives you exactly what was described, a population
that has been sheltered from disease until it comes in contact with the
terran biosphere.

>And, in any case, does it say that the Plague of
>Duskir was only a virus?

I\'ve never seen anything that said either way.  Which means there
is nothing in it being viral to discredit the premise.  Now
you can _assume_ they meant a bacteria, but that is just the
same as assuming it\'s incorrect.  You can do it all you want
but it proves nothing.

Again, I\'m impressed with your arrogance.  Seldom do a see such a "pure"
example.  Here you seem to feel the right to ignore what I say, assume
you know what I\'m thinking, and then berate me for it.  [Again, I\'m being
sarcastic, just in case you can\'t tell.]  The fact is that I have never
argued if it was "cannon".  All I\'ve argued is that it is; a) reasonable,
and b) whould, if given the proper spot in the timeline, go along way
toward explaining the Terran victory.  If this doesn\'t fit into your
view that every comment in this thread has to either argue that the
plague is cannon, exactly as written, or that it has be to abondoned
altogether, that\'s just too bad.

As to wishfull thinking, I would say that you premise that your
proclamations that it isn\'t canon make it so is a very good example
of wishfull thinking.  To be honest, as someone who is not comitted
to whether it is "canon" I have found the other side\'s arguements
more persausive.  (And you arrogant attitude only leads me to
believe that you comments have to be taken as coming from someone
who isn\'t willing to give the subject and objective view.]

The point is that the claims for the plague being canon (which you find
so hard to accept) are at least as credible as those for j-torps.  However,
you seem to be willing to admit below that jump torps are not "canon"

This is debatable (and has, in fact, been exaustively debated.)

OK, if a story (which likely only take into account the immediate plots
needs) happens to contridict a rule (which is where the most attention
is placed on consitency and balance), then you just assume the story
is valid and the rule isn\'t?  Personally, I would say that it
would be better to just eliminate the story.

I agree here.  And the best thing is just to drop such poorly thought
out additions (like jump torps).

This is exaclt my argument. The Terrans didn\'t *need* a large population - they
were simply able to outproduce the Vilani who, I would propose, were still at
the manned factory stage of production because of their social conservatism
(remember that we are told that they did not introduce new inventions or ideas
willy nilly - as the Terrans did - but considered them, sometimes for several
hundreds of years, before deciding how/when/where to use them). They saw the
increased automation as a source of societal disruption in their static society
(and in one of the ImpEncyc article, IIRC, it is actually stated that the
freeing up of Vilani social controls led to, as an example, workers leaving
factories idle now that they were able to move around freely!) and did not
allow it ... the Terrans saw it as a new idea and simply applied it regardless
of any consequences.

So. Why are prices of anything so high in relation to wages in the Third
Imperium? An Air Raft costs around 40 years wages! With mass production, it
should cost no more (in *relative* terms) than a modern car. Sure, at TL/15
(say) you wouldn\'t be getting the latest "cutting edge" TL/15 model ... but
you\'d get a perfectly serviceable (say) TL/10 version for the same (relative)
price as a modern small car ... no more than half a year\'s wages, and probably
less. In *all* versions of Traveller, this is not allowed for ... and TL/10
Air/Rafts cost *in Imperial Credits* MORE than TL/15 ones, despite being less
capable!!!

My original suggestion was that the Terran Confederation won the war with the
Vilani by outproducing them with Robot factories and, just on winning, were
betrayed by plotters within their own military who dealt treasonously with the
Vilani Megacorps and Bureaus ... gaining their support for the coup in return
for minimising social disruption - to whit (as one thing), the decomissioning
of the robot factories and the use of the outdated, archaic, Vilani style
manned factories.

No, I think you mean persisted into the *second* Imperium ... the Rule of Man.
There is no evidence that it exists in the Third Imperium. And, for the reasons
above, I would suggest that the Terran robotic factories must have been put out
of service relatively quickly to keep the treasonous deal that Estigaribbia
made with the Vilani for help in his coup against the democratically elected
Terran Confederation.

I mean, look at it from their point of view ... Estigaribbia and his friends
in the military, used to wielding great personal power during the course of
the wars are now, overnight, virtually un-needed. All that power gone! And
the Vilani Bureaus, well, they\'re even worse off ... and, as we\'ve been told,
some sections of Vilani society welcomed the overthrow of the upper classes
and bureaucrats; so why wouldn\'t the latter support Estigaribbia? They\'d end up
with almost everything they\'d had before ... sure the aftermath of the Terran
victory made things pretty chaotic, but it was the best that they could
salvage, and a reasonable deal, all things considered.

After all, do you *really* believe that garbage line of black propaganda that
Estigaribbia realised that the democratically elected government of the Terran
Confederation (and consider how a Confederacy is organised) wouldn\'t be able to
govern the now collapsing and conquered Vilani Imperium? But one man *could*!
It just happened to be the single man who had the most personal power to lose
in the Confederation! Sure, we\'re told that Norris\'s democratic reforms in the
DOmain of Deneb are stretched to the limits (at TL/15-16) in some of the last
TNE material ... but does this mean that the Confederation couldn\'t have done
exactly what a Confederacy is supposed to do ... provide a moderately strong
central government with limited powers (such as defence, protection of trade
etc.) and let the member states go their own way on their own planets? Who
would gain most from these sorts of reforms ... the ordinary people, especially
those of the collapsed and dictatorial Ziru Sirka ... and who desperately
wanted to protect their priviliged positions? The Confederate military and the
Vilani nobility!

But only Vland is inhospitable in that way. Though you *are* essentially
correct, though not on an interstellar scale as much as on each planet. For
millennia, farmworkers have been forced to labour for a pittance and not
allowed to go to the "big city" where easier work and better money can be found
(or so they think). Now, the Terrans have destroyed (or damaged) the old social
strictures, and, suddenly, a hell of a lot of peasants do just that -- food
production plummets, and the excess new population in the cities finds that
things ain\'t so rosy. Disease and some starvation inevitably result.

Possibly. But there is still the problem of women generally wanting a better
standard of living for themselves and their families, and the fact that this
increasingly means a longer working career before they can *afford* to have
kids and the fact that more kids means lower standards of living for all in the
family. I am sure that the vast majority of women want kids, but how many? They
don\'t all want to be baby factories *if they have a choice* ... and the
replacement rate is around 2-3 children per family. Do women *want* to have
families of 4+ kids? How many in a given society?

Unfortunately, history does not provide the answer here, as nowhere in previous
history have we been faced with a liberated female populace as we have in the
industrialised world today. So arguments from history on this particular matter
are pretty much pointless. Why would women *want* (and *large* numbers would
have to) families of 4+ kids and the hassles that go with it if 2-3 can be
assured survival.

    'body' => '101 Vehicles had a solution to the problem of low-cost vehicles and computers
They stated (page 1) that given that a single unit of linked control panel
takes up 10-30 liters (depending on type) the circuitry in the panel is
enough to control simple vehicles (ie if the vehicle only needs 3 CP just
install 2 holo-dynamic panels.  In 1010 vehicles it was suggested that
one person could manage up to 12 units of panels, I\'d put that at more like
4 or 6 units, but opinions differ.

This brings me to a related point, there are serious problems with the
computer vs robot brain rules.  In the adventure Knightfall it is stated
that he ships computer volunteers sensory info (verbally) at one point
(page 20).  I\'ve found references to this a few other places too.  If a
starship computer can speak, how is it different form a robot brain?

Proposal:  Book 8: Robots implies that the big problem with robot brains is
the reliability of synaptic processors.  it seems that occasionally
synaptic robot brains act "irrationally".  Fine, that\'s the last thing
you want running your starship.  My guess is installing such a thing on a
ship would likely invalidate every warranty and insurance contract in the
Imperium.

However, there are also non-synaptic robot brains.  Low data robot brains
are no more than ordinary computers a few tech levels from now.  High
data robot brains are the same thing, only they use lots of parallel
processing.  Neither of these alternatives sounds any more unreliable
than any other computer.  A High data robot brain with basic Command
installed could speak up and inform the crew of a problem, just like in
the adventure Knightfall.  Why not just replace vehicle computers with
robot brains?  They are much smaller (which makes since, the MT vehicle
computers are ridiculously huge) but High data robot brains are still
rather expensive.

As I see it, given that Hand computers are only 1000 Cr, and clearly have
the capacity of low data robot brains (ie they can respond to limited
voice command and they cost about the same [From Travellers Digest # 8]).
I would think that darn near every TL 13+ electronic device you buy might
well have a low data brain/computer installed.  As folks on another RPG
mailing list would say, this could lead to MGF (Maximum Game Fun).  Your
bio-sniffer might complain at rough treatment, your laser rifle might
launch into a long and *very* boring description of its functions when you
purchase it...

I only have one other suggested modification (wow, yes, I\'m almost done :)

Synaptic processors are clearly the path to full AI, TL 18 fully sentient
robot brains simply have *more* of them.  However, robot brains w/o
synaptics seem little more than fancy computers.  I would limit robot
brains w/o synaptics to INT 4 or lower, insuring that they are all dumbots
which require some supervision.  This is a good way to keep the things
from getting *too* powerful.  A TL 15 high data brain with an INT of 12
seems simply too high.

I hope this was helpful.

Comments?

He was referring to the FF&S book.

So it seems that J-Torps ARE canon (as far as TNE is canon <snicker> :) from

I suggest he look at GDW\'s "Exedition to Zhodane", where a personality

Personally, I visualize a Terran colony as being a place where _everyone_
(married or not) is socially expected to raise children.  Families are large,
with the older children helping out.  Because there is a lot of automation,
most workplaces are safe enough for children, and there is no social stigma
attached to bringing a child to work; more importantly, there is no social
stigma attached to devoting yourself full-time to childrearing.  Childrearing
(in a couple) is a responsibility of both parents, not primarily the woman.
Children are supported by the state; in fact, there are probably economic
incentives that make childrearing \'profitable\' and penalize childless people.

Interesting. But consider this, slight damage to a (Terran) organism\'s RNA/DNA
code can have tremendous consequences ... so, presumably, slight differences
between the chemical composition of left-handed proteins and right-handed
sugars could have similar differences? Also, there is the underlaying
assumption, is there not, that the path evolution has taken on earth is the
"best" path ... and this may not be the case. It may be *one* of a number of
equally viable "paths", may it not?

Obviously my reading is more general in nature than your specific knowledge, so
I will bow to your explanation for the rest of the First Imperium. However,
this leaves just as big a problem ... how did Vland come to be? If the tendency
is to have all life more or less compatible over a long enough period of time
(which is what I understand by the theory you are describing ... by all means
correct me if I am wrong!), then Vland is *mega* atypical. In fact, we could
say that it is probably close to unique ... and, thus, Vilani medical knowledge
becomes as per normal Terran standards once they get offplanet and find the
connections between organisms and diseases that, by the above theory, seems as
though must be the case everywhere else. See what I mean? It\'s a lose-lose
proposition for that particular argument about Vilani medicine no matter what
the outcome is (if I understand your theory description, as I noted).

Thus, the plague of Duskir is a nonsense as well. And GenAssist is a poorly
thought through DGP "last gasp". Like I said, lose-lose for the DGP
"explanation".

OK. Let\'s say for the moment that what you aregue is true/likely. Note that the
Terrans only reached TL/12 *at the end* of the wars ... *not* at the beginning
where the population growth would have had to have been. They were TL/10 at the
beginning and TL/11 for most of it. The cost of such facilities compared to
their utility would seem to be tremendously negative (unless, of course, you
make the assumption that all Traveller prices are hopelessly too high -- and
that Terrans were able to produce these things at much lower unit costs than
anyone before or since ... with robot factories that the Vilani never seem to
have used. Ergo, the Terrans can outproduce the Vilani and need no excessive
social cost as would result from the sort of "solution" that Tuber colonies
propose) and counterproductive. It also would require a totalitarian society
of a degree that the Terran Confederation is never described as being - I
cannot see normal humans accepting this sort of program as "normal" and, in any
case, as a Teacher, I do not believe that I would want to have anything to do
with any society where children are substantially raised and educated by
robots. Think of the long term socialisation problems alone!

So, your "solution" assumes Tech that isn\'t available until too late ... and
the implications of the "solution" make said "solution" unnecessary anyway.

Yes. Sure. Agreed. But it is as likely as not *based on current knowledge*. It
may, indeed, be wrong ... or right ... or *both* theories may be wrong. This is
all we can do when we are looking at Traveller ... base our arguments on what
the designers knew when they designed it. Would they make the same sort of
assumptions today? Would Vland type worlds be more common? Who knows? The point
is, based on what they have placed in canon so far, Vland type worlds are (as
far as we can tell) members of a class of *one* ... *unique*. And all other
worlds are basically terra type (as far as the nature of planetary life is
concerned), as long as they *are* basically Terra type. Ergo, either Vland is
a major anomaly that needs a *hell* of a lot more explanation, or the
assumption that all other worlds are like Terra is flawed.

Then, consider the reason for this particular thread of the argument. The
Vilani are *supposedly* backward in medical tech because of their lack of terra
style organisms back home. But what the rest of the Traveller materials seems
to make plain, and what you seem to be arguing is, is that Vland is *not*
going to be unique ... and that Terra-style worlds will be at least equally as
common. You will note that I originally accepted *both* possibilities, and
that, regardless of which one you accept, it is obvious that the Vilani must
have encountered terran style diseases as soon as they left the planet and
started exploring. Ergo, Vilani medical science was primitive *until they
started space exploration* ... *after* that it would have had to have kept
up pace in leaps and bounds. 2000 years down the track when the Terrans are
encountered, well, the Vilani medical tech is not significantly different from
that Terra possessed. If anything, because of the wider disease exposure that
they have inevitably had, *they* are more likely to be the ones who would
trash terran disease tech!

Biochemistry? So you know more chemistry. I am happy to accept that. So what
does that have to do with whether Vilani medical tech will be advanced when
they meet up with the Terrans or not? As I\'ve noted above, regardless of which
tack you take in this argument, there seems to be a logical fallacy in assuming
that the Vilani will never develop decent medical tech *once they leave their
planet*. As you have just yourself said, it is just as possible (or you can\'t
say it *isn\'t* just as possible, because we don\'t know) that terran style
organisms will be common everywhere ... so the Vilani get exposed to terran
style diseases and have to come up with the same sort of solutions.

Is it arrogance to point out flaws in GDW\'s background? Well, perhaps.
Remember, we are not substantially arguing chemisty (or biochemistry) here, we
are arguing how it affects a very specific matter ... Vilani medical knowledge
at the time they contact Terra.

But, it *doesn\'t* support what you are saying. Either that or we\'re not talking
about the same thing at all? I just don\'t see how you can make the statement!
What I said above was that Panspermia means that all life is related ... there
*are* no "alien biospheres" ... and so the Vilani, with their unique and
atypical biosphere, are exposed to diseases that *are* related to terran ones
as soon as they leave their own planet. And to have ruled a large empire (and
conquered it originally) for 2000 odd years means that they must have developed
ways of dealing with those diseases ... and this *does* mean that they will
have some resistance to terran style diseases, or some ability to provide
*artifical* resistance (antibiotic and antiviral analogues, for a start). In
fact, it implies that the *Terrans* will be at least as vulnerable to the
diseases the Vilani bring with *them*.

Don\'t take this as a personal attack on your professional qualifications. We\'re
talking about a game that, presumably, had no input at all from a professional
biochemist specialising in alien biochemistry ... *and* with the logical
inconsistencies and consequences thereto.

Is it arrogance to point out that the event in question, regardless of whether
it is canon or not, occurred *after* the Vilani collapse makes your point that
it is an explanation for said collapse wrong? I would have though not! Be as
sarcastic as you want, doesn\'t worry me that your point is a) not reasonable
(because it goes against the "facts" as known as to the date of appearance) and
b) therefore cannot be used as an explanation for the Terran victory. If you
don\'t see that, or if you think that it\'s arrogant of me to point it out, fine,
I can live with it ... but it may be better if we exchange views directly
without bothering the mailing list with any further rancour that may result
from this. Or we can simply agree to disagree. I can live with either. Your
ball.

You\'re dead right, when it ceases being fun, then there\'s no point in
continuing! And the reason that I began the whole thing is because I thought
it would (and, boy, *did* it!) stimulate some interesting discussion!

Just remember the story about the Professor of Ancient History who spent his
whole life proving that the Iliad and Odyssey weren\'t written by Homer -- but
by another Greek of the same name and from the same part of Greece!

..

  What I won\'t do now is give my opinion of people who snicker at the
demise of GDW or any other game company...


  Yes, FF&S brings down several old rules of ship-building. The two which
come to mind are the turrets-per-ton limit and the minimum displacement
to mount jump drives.  Both were done with two intentions: to bring more
concrete factors into play when designing (not enough room/power/crew for
the desired function) instead of some arbitrary limit, and to allow FF&S
to be used for non-Imperial settings.
  Despite the second reason, both limitations were also lifted from the
Third Imperium setting.  This was unstated until the Regency Sourcebook,
when designs appeared which made it clear that the 100 ton minimum was
gone.
  So be it.
  "How do you explain continuity with earlier editions?" you ask.
First, these were both _legal_ limits placed by the Ziru Sirka on all
shipbuilding, which became _traditional_ limits (the way the Vilani like
things to be...) during the long First Imperium, were re-affirmed by the
overly-legislative Solomani, and carried as law and tradition into the
Long Night and the Third Imperium.  No shipyard would build outside of these
limits for thousands of years.
  There is almost certainly an extensive body of medical and engineering
research which "proves" that starship hulls smaller than 100 tons are
a health/life risk to their crews.
  How does this explain the other races?  First, the Zhodani are a deeply
traditional people.  Somewhere back in antiquity they found a formula
which worked and have found no reason to ever exceed it.  The Vargr
shipbuilding credo was strongly influenced by first the Zhodani and then the
Vilani, waaay back when (read the old Vargr Module and the material on
the Julian Protectorate). The K\'kree and Aslan have to deal with immense
cultural restraints when designing ships: The K\'kree are gregarious
claustrophobes who wouldn\'t build a ship that small for any reason and have
trouble arming a ship even close to the limits because of space/power/crew
concerns, while the Aslan are creatures of Art, and arming a ship to the
teeth is not aesthetic.  The Hivers have some space concerns, but are ALWAYS
concerned with appearances: never appear more powerful than your neighbors
(unless they\'re K\'kree), as you might get a bad response that could disrupt
business and make you build warships.
  There is one other factor which cannot be completely ignored: perception.
The vast majority of the material available for Traveller is presented
through Imperial eyes, and the Imperium is not going to allow widespread
distribution of information which says "Our neighbors are breaking different
laws of nature than we are, and are building better ships than we are,
despite our technological edge." We didn\'t see such ships because we weren\'t
supposed to.

  AS for J-Torps, the above quote from Loren is indicative of the engineering
concerns.  Given the stated requirements for operating a jump drive, a J-Torp
is going to be huge. Design away.

And, sure enough, you seem to revel more in the argument, quoting reams of
unnecessary text and longwindedly repeating the same arguments from a position
of utter and complete certitude (rather than the much more friendly, and
"scientific," aura of doubting interest), than in actually listening to
other\'s points and objections.  You seem to care far more about showing off
yourself rather than actually trying to find a reasonable, let alone
compromise, position.  I think that\'s unfortunate (and would love to be
wrong), since you have indeed brought up a fascinating topic.

With that taken care of, let me attack some of your previous points, where
I think you\'re ignoring or merely trampling the evidence:

Well, you\'re glossing over (intentionally or unintentionally, I can\'t tell)
the difference between bacteria and viruses.  It is, indeed, more than likely
that, for example, Vilani medicine had to deal with, say, intestinal parasites
(like tapeworms) and simple bacteria, particularly when they got off-planet.
However, given that the genetic code (not the _existence_ of DNA/RNA, which
seem very practical and natural methods, but the _cipher_ of combinations of
adenine, tyrosine, etc. that correspond to specific amino acids) is probably
completely different on all other worlds, the Vilani would have no experience
with viruses -- extraterrestrial viruses invading human cells would produce
useless gibberish and not reproduce, assuming they ever managed the invasion
in the first place through completely different cell membranes and defenses.

To put that more simply, if Terran organisms code asparagine as, say, TGA,
but Vilani organisms signify it by CTG, then viruses, which reproduce by
hijacking the host cell\'s genetic machinery, are unlikely to work.

The absence of viable animal models -- ones which have the same biochemical
cycles and internal workings on a fine scale -- would handicap Vilani medicine
as has been described.  They\'d learn how to deal with parasites, sure, but
imagine their horror on meeting the Solomani and encountering diseases which
hijacked their own genetic machinery in order to reproduce!  They would never
have encountered such a thing, and have no countermeasures against it.

Phillip, this is balderdash.  Do you actually read your sources, or just
argue about them?  Supplement 10 (The Solomani Rim) states rather clearly,
as I recall, that jump-3 was invented during the 8th or 9th Interstellar
War, and was what allowed a breakout around the Vilani defenses.  This still
leaves quite a bit of time until the end of the Nth Interstellar War.  And
we know that technology can lag or run ahead of a society\'s nominal "tech
level" (I think it\'s been stated that the Solomani, despite being TL9,
lacked gravitics until after Vilani contact).  So I see no problem with
the Vilani having TL12 _medical_ technology well before the 8th or 9th War.

I acknowledge and approve of your conspiratorial view of the changeover from
Terran Confederation to Rule of Man, but wish you\'d be slightly less sure of
yourself in argument, and more willing to listen and respond to others.

OK. *Maybe*. But consider this, "Expedition to Zhodane" is set in the Third
Imperium, 1107, in fact. Ergo, the "Teaching Machine" is at least TL/15 - and,
if you read the intro, the Prof is the sort of brilliant crackpot who very well
could have invented a pre-TL/16 *prototype* of the real thing. So, the machine
is *not* a subliminal teaching machine ... it is a prototype of the TL/16
Partial Memory Dupe machine! No, I hadn\'t thought of it, but, as you can see,
the machine does *not* in any way put me in deep brown stuff!

Well, yes and no, all the "official" stuff that I can immediately lay my hands
on has Miller/Chadwick et al down as "Design" and Fugate et at as "additional
design" ... so we can regard GDW material for MTrav as more in line with what
Miller intended. Her certainly doesn\'t seem to have accepted the "sparklers",
for instance.

But such are not mentioned anywhere in Traveller material. Sure, you *can*
assume that they are available ... however, *if* they were of significance,
surely they would have been mentioned *somewhere* previously. Now, if Marc
Miller comes out with Trav4 and says, in the Interstellar Wars Milieu Book that
these *were* the reason for the Terran victory, well, I can accept this
justification after the fact. However, DGPs explanation smacks of the wild-eyed
ideas such as the Sparklers which, I presume, got them dumped by GDW at the end
(at least partly?). It is mentioned nowhere in the original *Solomani*, where,
surely, it should have been?

But, as a Teacher, I would suggest that this is the *least* part of raising
kids (well, not seriously ... I\'m sure any parents out there wouldn\'t agree
with mee). The problem is, regardless of how you look at it, how safe can
non-AI robots be around small children? I suggest that few (if any) parents
would allow them to do anything much re *raising* the kid ... and there are
already labour saving devices aplenty that reduce housework etc. *right now*.
No, robotic nannies are an expensive, and probably unnecessary, addition.

But there is no justification for this. In fact, everything we have for
Traveller from the word go assumes male/female equality in all fields. And,
since robotic child-care is needlessly dangerous and (I suspect) excessively
expensive, that\'s not an option. It still boils down to how many children
people will want to have ... and more than 3 (*many* more for the growth rates
suggested by others) would be a minimum necessity. Assuming that present day
social trends continue, no-one is going to stand for that sort of time
consuming effort ... and even with day care and the like, kids still take a
hell of a lot of effort. That\'s the way the trend is now, and there is no
reasonable expectation that it will change ... and the fact that women can now
control their own fertility and have their own careers mean that being a
homemaker is increasingly *not* No 1 in their priorities ... at least, not in
Oz.

Is your suggestion possible? Yes? Likely? Not very, in my opinion (FWIW).

Actually, a J-torp doesn\'t need to be NEARLY that large.  That 15 ton figure 
includes fuel, controls, power plant, and just about everything needed to have a
  miniature little starship.  For not much more, you could add crew, a fixed 
mount weapon, and a little bunk: PRESTO you have a miniature little jump capable
  fighter craft.  Someone ought to design one of these, just for kicks. :) Sort 
of the Traveller version of the X-Wing fighter.

But a J-torp needn\'t be nearly this complex.

All you need is a little computer and a jump drive.  No power plant or fuel is 
needed.  The drive\'s capacitors are charged by the launching vessel, which
  also imparts inertia to the torp through its launching mechanism.  Once it 
reaches it comes in-system at the target location, it can sit around like a
  little Nav buoy and wait to be picked up by dedicated tender vessels.  The 
end result is a replacement of the generic X-boat courier line with unmanned
  J-torp message couriers.

A device like this would have tons of drawbacks.  For military courier use, its 
basically worthless since its unsecure and not tactical (bad idea to send one
  of these to communicate with someone hiding in an enemy system).  They\'d be 
nice for launching as a log buoy in the event of some catastrophic emergency on
  the starship.  The sheer size of one of these things (still in the 5-10 ton 
range) means that only larger vessels are likely to carry any at all,
  particularly since the launching mechanism has to be custom designed into the starship as well.  Only the larger ships of the line 
are likely to carry more than a small handful (2-4) of these things.  Like
  the X-boat, J-torps require dedicated tender vessels to care for them.  Just 
about anything with a cargo bay might concievably pick up one of the things,
  and maintenance could be done in the cargo bay, but getting the thing back 
into its launcher tube would be tricky, and best performed in port (unless 
you\'re
  a tender, cu! stom designed for the mission of launching and retrieving drone J-torps.

Without much extra work, a drone could be designed that has just enough of a 
robotic brain to fire some simple thrusters and home in on a target planet.
  Designed with an airfoil, some terminal guidance software, and a little 
turbine engine all you need is a warhead to create a J-Tomahawk cruise missile.
  Such nightmarish devices could (in sufficient numbers) be the scourge and 
plague of inhabited systems throughout the universe.  Of course the only reason
  those goofy Vampire Fleets don\'t just annihilate a
ll human life in the former Imperium is because they don\'t have the 
manufacturing capability to produce such weapons, since Imperial shipyards all 
conform to
  the 100ton limit.  Still, 100tons of automated Scout/Courier hell could carry 
one enormous fusion warhead (strip fuel, vehicle, and crew space, charge Jump
  capacitors externally, and fill all remaining space with one incredible bomb).

Hmm . . . does anyone remember Darkstar?  :)

Another bald-faced assertion presented as incontrovertible fact.  Actually,
Phillip, the asteroid-ship "Rock" is described as TL9 (Ad6, p25).  One could
just as easily argue that the memory-implant device is of the same tech level.
It\'s not mentioned, and therefore we can\'t be sure about it.  Gee, uncertainty
is a horrid thing, isn\'t it?  Makes you listen to possibly different
opinions....

Do you not see the difference between "memory duplication" from an existing
template (which requires the ability to read memories and then write them) and
"subliminal teaching" as a faster means of instruction (which requires only
a connection and appropriate stimuli and responses with/to the subject\'s
subconscious)?

You aren\'t a Christian fundamentalist/Biblican literalist, are you Phillip?
This line of argument is seeming awfully familiar....  I could name any of
a host of things not mentioned in the Traveller "canon" but usually assumed
by referees, or material not mentioned in the basic rules but fleshed out in
widely-accepted "non-canon" magazine articles, etc.  Do we have to follow
Holy Writ from the Divine Miller or can we make reasonable assumptions based
on existing technology (this being, after, all, *science* fiction)?

For what it\'s worth, here is the actual material from Solomani & Aslan
(which you can argue about as "canon" all you want, Phillip -- the fact
remains that during the MegaTraveller years GDW largely abrogated
responsibility for Traveller development to DGP, concentrating instead on
T2K, Dark Conspiracy, and that dud Cadillacs & Dinosaurs).

S&A p.20 "GenAssist first sought to genetically alter Terran and alien
lifeforms so that food supply was not a problem.  Next, GenAssist sought
to increase the birth and growth rates of the colonists, expanding their
populations in record time.  Although our ancestors were eager colonists,
most sought to settle on habitable worlds.  Unfortunately, most worlds were
not suited for humans, but these same worlds often had the best resources
for a rapidly growing interstealler civilization.  Plus, we needed workers
to increase our productivity.

"Once again, GenAssist offered a solution.  Once established on a world
with a hostile environment, GenAssist set up \'artificial wombs\' producing
thousands of infants per year.  A staff of a few human and robot nurses
cared for these budding populations.  Others educated these new \'test-tube\'
colonists using tapes feeding the subconscious mind.  Using these techniques,
we could establish a fully productive, heavily populated colony world in
under twenty years."

Much of that has already been stated -- I just thought I\'d provide the
original text.  No copyright infringement is intended: this text is
reproduced purely for the purpose of example and debate.

On the same note, Phillip, I note that your much-vaunted MegaTraveller
Referee\'s Companion notes, on p. 28, that Medical Technology allows "limb
regeneration" at TL9, and "growth quickening" at TL10.  (Hell, along with
"nerve refusion" at TL11).  What more is needed for "artifical wombs" which
produce new infants rather than copies/clones of existing full-grown
individuals?

p. 35 of the same book mentions how "in -2389 the Terran Confederation Navy
commissioned a line of mass-produced tech level 12 robots as support staff
for military personnel.  These were not warbots as we know them today.  A
few of the robots were expert medical robots or served as administrative
support, but most were heavy-duty, hard-working construction robots, used
to build temporary installations for advanced bases."  Sounds like they
were a bit more capable than you give them credit for.

You are welcome, Phillip, to build your own Interstellar Wars campaign any
way you like.  Just don\'t be so cock-sure of yourself that you try to make
everyone else play the same way.

Um, first of all, the problem with Vland is not (as you imply, I don\'t
know if that is intentional) is bacause the biosphere is based on
the wrong amino acids, because that would make everything inedible.
In fact, they don\'t specificially say where the problem comes from,
and there are a lot of possiblities.

I don\'t know anything in "canon" that says that Vland worlds are
unique.  All you can say is that, of the human races important enough
to get significant treatment in supplements (two?) one was put on a
world that was hard for a low tech race to find edible food.  You
can\'t say that, just because they aren\'t mentioned elsewhere, they
don\'t exist.

Beside, this has little to do with Viral diseases.  (see below).

Um, no.  "Not unique" says nothing about how common they are.  Again,
though, this is off the main issue.

No here too.  The reason the above is not important is that the edibility
of local organisms need not have anything to do with the problem
of viral contagion.  As we both have mentions, you virus are very
dependend on the detail of an organisms genetics and it is possible
that the Vilani didn\'t find an ecosystem that posed a threat of
viral disease until Terra.

You can waffle and back-track all you want, but you were attempting to
score cheap points by attempting a personal attack on my personal
knowledge.  (Had I not found your arrogance and close mindedness so
ammusing I would have been offended)  Not only do I not lack a "basic
scientific knowledge", but I have specific experience in the field of
exobiology.  I presume now that you are abandoning such tatics (I knew an
apology was too much too expect).

You really need to review the difference between "opinion" and "fact".
Just because you believe something doesn\'t make it logically true.

It is possible that you are right.  But your claim is that the Traveller
background is wrong.  You are quick to talk about logic, lets review
it.  You can\'t prove that something (in this case the Traveller background)
is wrong buy showing how something else _might_ be right.

>Is it arrogance to point out flaws in GDW\'s background?

Nope.  But it is arrogant to attack someones background and abilities
because they disagree with you.

>Remember, we are not substantially arguing chemisty (or biochemistry) here, we
>are arguing how it affects a very specific matter ... Vilani medical knowledge
>at the time they contact Terra.

Well, no.  You are trying to change the arguement because your cheap little
tatic has back fired.  The fact is that the lack abilty of Vilani to
fit themselves into a rational theory of biology (based on how different
life on other planets might be) and the fact that they might, when they
came in contact with Terra, encounter diseases they weren\'t prepared for
were main issues, both of which are fundamentally issue in Exobiology.

But nothing you have said require panspermia.  And without panspermia,
it is easy to believe that the Vilani, when they came in contact with
Terra, encounter diseases they weren\'t prepared for

>Don\'t take this as a personal attack on your professional qualifications.

Fine, don\'t define lacking in "basic scientific knowledge" as "he happens
to disagree with me".

But, regardless of input, they don\'t have the "logical inconsistencies
and consequences" you claim that they would (wether it is because your
premise of input is wrong or they just got lucky is irrelevant).

>Is it arrogance to point out that the event in question, regardless of whether
>it is canon or not, occurred *after* the Vilani collapse makes your point that
>it is an explanation for said collapse wrong? I would have though not!

No.  It is arrogant to tell people what their positions are (regradless
of what their real positions are, and then belittle them).  I can\'t
be engaging in wishfull thinking on the question of "canon" because
I have never even taken a position on the matter.

>Be as
>sarcastic as you want, doesn\'t worry me that your point is a) not reasonable
>(because it goes against the "facts" as known as to the date of appearance) and

Ah!  This is even more cute!  You try and take a "high road tone" while
attacking postions I\'ve never taken!

>If you
>don\'t see that, or if you think that it\'s arrogant of me to point it out, fine,
>I can live with it

This is also good!  Because I don\'t agree with you, you attack my "basic
scientific knowledge", accuse my positions of being "wishfull thinking" and
attack me for postions I\'ve never even taken.  And then you say it\'s me
that has trouble with people with contrary postions?

If you want.  Or you can just try arguing the points rather than trying
cheap tatics.  If your opponents postions are a flawed as you want to
claim, you should be able to just point out the flaws rather than make
aspersion on their abilities or objectivity.

First of all, every indication is that Vilani medical science is *still*
lagging behind, and it\'s not that hard to explain:  the Vilani just don\'t
value doctors.  As the culture evolved on Vland, food preparers held the
real keys to power, and any sort of doctor was just a technician to take
care of bleeding, broken bones, etc.  As they encountered other worlds, the
anmount of technical knowledge they had to acquire was greater, but that
doensn\'t necessarily mean that their status increased any.  Imagine how many
people would go to medical school in the U.S. if, after you got out, you got
about the same pay and societal status as a high school teacher.  Not too
many, I\'d wager.

Phil and I disagree about Terran population growth.  I argue that
reproductive technology is not inconsistent with existing Traveller canon,
indeed can even be considered as being implied.  I also argue that the
primary factors in a rapidly expanding population would be cultural not
technological.

>But such (artificial wombs) are not mentioned anywhere in Traveller
material.
>Sure, you *can* assume that they are available ... however, *if* they were

>surely they would have been mentioned *somewhere* previously.

Well, major mills aren\'t mentioned in Roman literature and inscriptions, but
they existed and ground a large proportion of the grain.  And for a long time
very few civilian vehicles were published in Traveller, most equipment was
military, etc.  The absence of something just indicates that no one wrote
about it.  Hey, look at cargo containers.  Not mentioned at all until MTJ 3,
when they became \'canon\'.  (I wrote that one, along with grashfalt and quite
a few others.)

Personally, I assumed that artificial wombs were common well before I read
any Bujold.  (I just like her terminology better.)  I have several friends
who would cheerfully mortgage their houses for one (major morning sickness,
several miscarriages...).  Given Traveller\'s equality between the sexes, yet
nature\'s work-split, this always seemed an implied development, especially
when women work in high-risk occupations.  (For example, nurses and
schoolteachers have higher miscarriage rates than other occupations.)  In
fact, back when we were playing Classic Traveller one of the female players
insisted on them (rather than bench her character for nine months)!

It is true that nothing is mentioned in the tech tables.  But note that we
already have whole-animal cloning (sheep), and we can do genetic engineering
(tech 14).  Personally, I figure that we are looking at a bio-engineering
problem - pump in enough money and effort and we can crack it.  After all, by
tech 10 Traveller has cyrogenic suspension, cancer cures, growth
quickening... all related to genetics and cell development.

Why use a robotic nanny?  Playing with your kids is the fun part.  Use the
robot to do the boring jobs.  Housework takes a tremendous amount of time,
when you add it up, even with labour-saving devices.  Cooking, cleaning, etc
take me many hours a week, anyway, and I don\'t have any kids living with me
right now.  As to safety around small children, that argument has,
historically, been used for power tools, spin driers, and many other
labour-saving appliances.  Design in good safeguards (eg. robot doesn\'t clean
while living creature is in room).

Nor reason against it.  There is simply nothing written on daily life in the
Terran Confederation.  This is my view.  (OK, one of my views - I figure the
Terran Confederation had a _lot_ of different cultures.)

Exactly.  That\'s what I was saying.  Reread my post.

See above re robotic nannies.

>It still boils down to how many children people will want to have ...

True.  I\'m trying to come up with a culture/society that will make them want
to have lots of kids, and make it easy for them to have lots.

Depends on the reason for the trend.  One reason families are getting smaller
is that people have less time (2-3 jobs, longer hours, etc.).  Change that
trend and there will be a corresponding change in birth rate.  Hey, it
happened that way here in the Great Depression - people put off having kids
until they could support them.  Also note that we spend more money on
ourselves than previous generations - but this trend is also beginning to
alter.  Leaving aside issues like sterility (presumed solved by the medical
tech we\'re talking about) we should be considering cultural values.

I think that removing the economic constraints will do a lot to increase
family size.  This happened in the U.S. with the G.I. Bill; it is happening
right now in developing countries with some aid projects.  If you subsidize
kids, more people will have more kids.  (In fact, some of my students are
trying for a second child, because with two kids they get enough welfare to
afford their own apartment.)

Nor here (Canada).  But notice that with my assumptions women are not
(necessarily) homemakers.  Also note that with a donated egg a man could go
out and have a baby made and raise the child.

Me:
I agree with Rob that higher tech will increase the convenience of
dealing with the "scut-work" of housekeeping, but like Phil, I find it
hard to believe that it can be used as a substitute for child rearing.
But I think that such substitutes are unnecessary. Old fashioned
techniques are quite adequate to do the job of raising 300+ billion
human being in the next 3 centuries.

Phillip:

<people will want to have ... and more than 3 (*many* more for the growth rates
<suggested by others) would be a minimum necessity. Assuming that present day

Me (interupting): By "growth rates suggested by others," I assume you
mean my example of a population doubling time of 50 years giving 320
billion people in 300 years. Let me point out that in order to double a
population in fifty years, couples would only need to have an average of
2.83 children (assuming a 25-year generation,) not the "many-more-than-3"
that you suggest. This growth rate is not some wild assertion, but a
quite moderate one. It could *easily* be quite a bit higher. Of course,
it could be lower too; I just want to point out that a high growth rate
(like the one we have now) is quite feasible.

Phillip (continued from before the interuption):
<suggested by others) would be a minimum necessity. Assuming that present day
<social trends continue, no-one is going to stand for that sort of time
<consuming effort ... and even with day care and the like, kids still take a
<hell of a lot of effort. That\'s the way the trend is now, and there is no
<reasonable expectation that it will change ... and the fact that women can now
<control their own fertility and have their own careers mean that being a
<homemaker is increasingly *not* No 1 in their priorities ... at least, not in
<Oz.

Me:
Of course kids take a lot of effort, but people still want to have them.
And having several kids doesn\'t make as big a difference in your life as
having your first one. I predict families will still be du mode in the
future. Their size will be determined more by economics and fashion than
by "who-is-going-to-raise-the-kids" (altho that\'s an interesting topic
in its own right.)

Phillip:
<Is your suggestion possible? Yes? Likely? Not very, in my opinion (FWIW).

Me:
But not so very unlikely either, IMHO.

I have no idea of any canon that might exist on the subject.

In the only campaign I had in the virus era (with MT rules, I did not
want to change by vehicle designs) I had assumed that a ship with a
suitable virus strand had landed on Sybmquis (sp?) the TL 17 planet with
TL 8 space techonology. The virus had quickly removed the block preventing
them to  achieve space technology (as the locals appear to be or use lots
of robots [see e.g. Robots]) and had started a galaxy conquering project
solely based on robotic workers, automated factories, robotic crews. The
project has to start slow because the virus run planet has to reinvent
some aspects of space technology.

The location of the planet was roughly inside the black curtain as depicted
in the TNE manual.

This was unveiled by Regency spies (as I was assuming that only idiots
would avoid monitoring closely a TL 17 planet) so that the Regency
can start a "save the civilization" effort (reducing the viking jokers to
a client state in the process [it\'s my universe I can wipe out the ones
I do not like!]). The Regency ultimately wins but not by a big margin
and at that point it reunifies Imperium (or what\'s left of it, about 1205).

Of course part of the Regency effort has to be secret because of the
anti-"Nafta" referendum.

This is exaclt my argument. The Terrans didn\'t *need* a large population - they
were simply able to outproduce the Vilani who, I would propose, were still at
the manned factory stage of production because of their social conservatism
(remember that we are told that they did not introduce new inventions or ideas
willy nilly - as the Terrans did - but considered them, sometimes for several
hundreds of years, before deciding how/when/where to use them). They saw the
increased automation as a source of societal disruption in their static society
(and in one of the ImpEncyc article, IIRC, it is actually stated that the
freeing up of Vilani social controls led to, as an example, workers leaving
factories idle now that they were able to move around freely!) and did not
allow it ... the Terrans saw it as a new idea and simply applied it regardless
of any consequences.
So. Why are prices of anything so high in relation to wages in the Third
Imperium? An Air Raft costs around 40 years wages! With mass production, it
should cost no more (in *relative* terms) than a modern car. Sure, at TL/15
(say) you wouldn\'t be getting the latest "cutting edge" TL/15 model ... but
you\'d get a perfectly serviceable (say) TL/10 version for the same (relative)
price as a modern small car ... no more than half a year\'s wages, and probably
less. In *all* versions of Traveller, this is not allowed for ... and TL/10
Air/Rafts cost *in Imperial Credits* MORE than TL/15 ones, despite being less
capable!!!
My original suggestion was that the Terran Confederation won the war with the
Vilani by outproducing them with Robot factories and, just on winning, were
betrayed by plotters within their own military who dealt treasonously with the
Vilani Megacorps and Bureaus ... gaining their support for the coup in return
for minimising social disruption - to whit (as one thing), the decomissioning
of the robot factories and the use of the outdated, archaic, Vilani style
manned factories.

No, I think you mean persisted into the *second* Imperium ... the Rule of Man.
There is no evidence that it exists in the Third Imperium. And, for the reasons
above, I would suggest that the Terran robotic factories must have been put out
of service relatively quickly to keep the treasonous deal that Estigaribbia
made with the Vilani for help in his coup against the democratically elected
Terran Confederation.
I mean, look at it from their point of view ... Estigaribbia and his friends
in the military, used to wielding great personal power during the course of
the wars are now, overnight, virtually un-needed. All that power gone! And
the Vilani Bureaus, well, they\'re even worse off ... and, as we\'ve been told,
some sections of Vilani society welcomed the overthrow of the upper classes
and bureaucrats; so why wouldn\'t the latter support Estigaribbia? They\'d end up
with almost everything they\'d had before ... sure the aftermath of the Terran
victory made things pretty chaotic, but it was the best that they could
salvage, and a reasonable deal, all things considered.
After all, do you *really* believe that garbage line of black propaganda that
Estigaribbia realised that the democratically elected government of the Terran
Confederation (and consider how a Confederacy is organised) wouldn\'t be able to
govern the now collapsing and conquered Vilani Imperium? But one man *could*!
It just happened to be the single man who had the most personal power to lose
in the Confederation! Sure, we\'re told that Norris\'s democratic reforms in the
DOmain of Deneb are stretched to the limits (at TL/15-16) in some of the last
TNE material ... but does this mean that the Confederation couldn\'t have done
exactly what a Confederacy is supposed to do ... provide a moderately strong
central government with limited powers (such as defence, protection of trade
etc.) and let the member states go their own way on their own planets? Who
would gain most from these sorts of reforms ... the ordinary people, especially
those of the collapsed and dictatorial Ziru Sirka ... and who desperately
wanted to protect their priviliged positions? The Confederate military and the
Vilani nobility!

But only Vland is inhospitable in that way. Though you *are* essentially
correct, though not on an interstellar scale as much as on each planet. For
millennia, farmworkers have been forced to labour for a pittance and not
allowed to go to the "big city" where easier work and better money can be found
(or so they think). Now, the Terrans have destroyed (or damaged) the old social
strictures, and, suddenly, a hell of a lot of peasants do just that -- food
production plummets, and the excess new population in the cities finds that
things ain\'t so rosy. Disease and some starvation inevitably result.

Possibly. But there is still the problem of women generally wanting a better
standard of living for themselves and their families, and the fact that this
increasingly means a longer working career before they can *afford* to have
kids and the fact that more kids means lower standards of living for all in the
family. I am sure that the vast majority of women want kids, but how many? They
don\'t all want to be baby factories *if they have a choice* ... and the
replacement rate is around 2-3 children per family. Do women *want* to have
families of 4+ kids? How many in a given society?

Unfortunately, history does not provide the answer here, as nowhere in previous
history have we been faced with a liberated female populace as we have in the
industrialised world today. So arguments from history on this particular matter
are pretty much pointless. Why would women *want* (and *large* numbers would
have to) families of 4+ kids and the hassles that go with it if 2-3 can be
assured survival.

Possibly. But there is still the problem of women generally wanting a better
standard of living for themselves and their families, and the fact that this
increasingly means a longer working career before they can *afford* to have
kids and the fact that more kids means lower standards of living for all in the
family. I am sure that the vast majority of women want kids, but how many? They
don\'t all want to be baby factories *if they have a choice* ... and the
replacement rate is around 2-3 children per family. Do women *want* to have
families of 4+ kids? How many in a given society?

Unfortunately, history does not provide the answer here, as nowhere in previous
history have we been faced with a liberated female populace as we have in the
industrialised world today. So arguments from history on this particular matter
are pretty much pointless. Why would women *want* (and *large* numbers would
have to) families of 4+ kids and the hassles that go with it if 2-3 can be
assured survival.

In the MT Encyclopedia time line, it states that the Solomani used AI in
their Navy to combat the Vilani. Does anyone have examples of how this
worked, if AI\'s are really TL 16? Were they specialized? Are the definitions
of "AI" somehow different between CT, MT, and TNE? Any enlightenment would
be appreciated.

If that\'s the way I come across, I must apologise. It is not intentional -
probably too many years teaching, I spose. That said, however, I do not
necessarily agree with your summation (of course!), as I do not see that I
should agree with something that seems to me to have been sloppily dealt with
(whether that is by GDW or whoever) or contradictory or ambiguous. Sure, I may
well be wrong on a wide variety of issues, and I am more than happy to admit
it when someone can show that it is the case (as I provisionally did some
months ago with the Plague of Duskir ... until I found the source and the
exact details, which did *not* support the contention{s} of the person{s} who
had used it!). Anyway, I\'ll try to be more brief in argument, at least.

I am not intentionally (or unintentionally) glossing over the difference
between viruses and bacteria. I am assuming that, whether you assume Panspermia
or simply convergent evolution (or whethever), analogues of *both* are likely
to be present off Vland. This may be incorrect ... but what I understand of the
arguments presented by some others re developments in Oxford (?) that seem to
show that certain types of proteins and sugars (?) are more likely to occur in
life (even extraterrestrial life) than not. If you disagree with this, and I
am bowing to superior knowledge here, then you don\'t have an argument with me.
If you assume Panspermia, which was *my* original position, then all life -
except that on Vland, for some reason, is massively more likely than not to be
related ... and in that case, then the Viruses and Bacteria will be compatible
to some considerable degree. Since this seems to be supported by the fact that
Traveller has made provisions for animal encounters to be *edible* without
special preparation in the past, I have assumed that Vland is unique and the
rest of the planets are populated via Panspermia. This may well be a big ask,
but no more than assuming that animals on widely separated planets are edible
by humans! See what I\'m getting at here?

Yes, but given my proposition, based on what Traveller seems to be implying,
this would *not* be the first time they would have found something like it. In
any case, even if my position is flawed by being too big a jump, then have you
considered that, just like the proto-Vilani in effect brought their own
bacterial diseases *with* them (and they then mutated to be diseases or not),
they probably also brought viruses that may originally have been relatively
benign (or controllable by Ancient tech). And there were, I believe, something
in excess of 40 offplanet "plantings" of humans by the Ancients *that
survived*. All the more chance for this to happen ... and none of whom had the
food problems facing the Vilani, when, if you assume *no* Panspermia, they
would have more likely than not have faced very similar ones. And that doesn\'t
include those planets where the *humans* didn\'t survive, but other Terran
animals did ... and there was at least one world that was identified as an
Ancient Zoological preserve known to the Ziru Sirka before contact with the
Solomani. It looks to *me* that the current "canon" handles the matter with
*considerable* ambiguity that seems to support my side more than yours, though
indirectly, of course.

Well, *is* it balderdash? According to Alien Module #6: Solomani (page #5),
indicates that the invention occurred after the end of the 8th Interstellar
War, and the 9th as the time of said invention. In MTrav Ref\'s Companion (page
#34) Terran invention of J3 is dated at -2210. In MTrav ImpEncyc (page #6) the
beginning of the Nth Interstellar War is -2235 and end at 2219. However, it
does not indicate when the 8th or 9th Wars were ... or whether they were part
of the "Nth" war or not. However, it is *implied* that they were ... and the
invention of J3 is only 9 years before the end of the Nth Interstellar war.
So, think about it from the point of the original thrust of the post ... that
the Terrans must have been able to *outproduce* the Vilani as they certainly
did not outnumber them. Remember construction times for Traveller Ships (a
large vessel takes a minimum of 12 months and up to 60 months for the larger
ones) ... in nine years, how many j3 ships would the Terrans have been able to
produce? Most of their fleet must (unless you assume the sort of massive
productivity disparity that I have suggested) still have been J2. It smacks of
the German situation at the end of WW2, in some ways ... a handful of hi-tech
weapons against the massive lower tech weapons of the enemy. There *has* to be
more to it than *just* J3 units. Does that sound more reasonable?

I hope that the above is more reasoned and to your liking. I\'m trying, anyway!

Yes, believe it or not, I do (listen). And, as it also says that the Professor
did his original research on Regina (TL/10) and later on Paya (TL/9) there may
well be something in it. I still remain unconvinced that there is a difference
between what the Prof\'s machine does and partial memory dupe. And, since Miller
et al aren\'t saying, we\'ll just have to say that either version is possible.
However, the Imperium is still TL/15, and the Prof may have been doing "cutting
edge" research ... after all, it is implied in a number of places that the all
encompassing world TL is only a general reference ... even disallowing the
way its handled in "World Builder\'s Handbook". And, for the sake of argument,
I\'ll even agree that the whole GDW TL system is, and has always been, a crock -
and a useless one, at that ... so it\'s quite possible that what the Imperium
*claims* is high tech may well not be (sorry, more conspiracy stuff here! ;-} )

> You aren\'t a Christian fundamentalist/Biblican literalist, are you Phillip?

No! And, you\'ll note, I am not necessarily assuming that anything said by GDW
is gospel. In fact, the whole point of this argument is that GDW "canon" has
inconsistencies and flaws in it!

As for what it says in Solomani and Aslan (deleted for brevity), well, I don\'t
dispute that it makes internal sense (without having seen the whole book). But
so (allegedly ... many would dispute it) does "Survival Margin" and TNE. And,
even if it does seem like fundamentalist ranting, surely something so
unprecedented (and, OK, I spose I *am* making an assumption here that it *is*
unprecedented) would have been mentioned in some of the other material that we
have that has been done by Miller/Chadwick/Nilsen *and* Fugate/DGP *if* it was
something that they approved of? Which is, I spose, neither here nor there
anyhow. I *personally*, FWIW, do not believe that it is supportable based on
what we know of Traveller tech from other sources or based on what we are told
about the Solomani from other sources ... and there seems to be the evidence
of GDW dumping DGP (note *seems*) to indicate that they weren\'t happy with
some of the things they were doing (and, sure, GDW didn\'t do any better, so its
a moot point ... happy?).

Which still leaves us with what I believe is the problem of teaching and
raising them. On that we have a disagreement that isn\'t as simply solved - even
if we grant the above which, for the sake of argument, let us assume. There is
some justification for this, but I do not agree that you have a case for memory

No. I have no problem with the above. I just question whether you would want a
construction robot to look after a newborn baby? I know that *I* wouldn\'t.

Have I ever said I required anyone to? I may be cocksure (and I would simply

Well, as you will note, the problem with amino acids wasn\'t something I came up
with, it was suggested in another post as (as I understood it) a proposition
that Vland style worlds were not terribly likely. I was simply following on
from that ... based (IIRC) on the research of an Oxford Biochemist.

No, they don\'t. However, the Animals system allows for animal encounters to be
edible ... and in all of the adventures I can remember offhand (not all by any
means, I stand happy to be corrected) that are on worlds with an inhabitable
biosphere (i.e. not like "Across the Bright Face" ??) the assumption, often
quite implicitly, is that the local food is edible with no special preparation.
Also, for example, Aslan are not said to have any special food requirements and
can exist (co-exist) quite happily on the same worlds as Terrans ... also
implying that they can eat the same foods we do. Sure. it doesn\'t say
*specifically* that Vland is unique, it just seems to be the way everything
else is described shows that it either is, or very close to.

Yes, OK. I accept that. I think you\'re not necessarily right. Remember, I am
assuming that Panspermia is the reason for all this. I may well be wrong, but
I think the evidence supports me (admittedly in a negative kind of way) at
least as much as the science you present supports you. And, though you won\'t
accept it, it still boils down to the fact that this wasn\'t the main point of
the original post.

Also, consider this, there were 42 (IIRC) other human groups transplanted by
the Ancients, and (IIRC) these were only the ones that survived. There was also
at least one world that was a major zoological facility (Dinorb? I don\'t
remember offhand) where many terran organisms were found ... well before the
Terrans were encountered. Every time they encountered one of these worlds, even
the ones where the Terrans didn\'t survive, there is a chance that bacteria and
viruses that had mutated there would be dangerous to the Vilani, so there is
a good chance that the Vilani would have overcome their initial difficulties
- though not certain, of course (happy?).

I apologise of you think I was intending to score points (cheap or not) off
you. I was not. If you took it that way, it was not intended. However, on the
substantive matters - I assumed from you arguments that you lacked a knowledge
that you had *at that point* made no claim to possess. I am quite happy to
acknowledge that you possess it. Does that make your arguments right
automatically any more than mine are?

No, but almost all of this argument has to be based on opinion. We have found
no alien worlds to check the *opinions* of either of us or of the designers of
Traveller out against.

And that works as much against your position as mine. Think of this more as

And both of which I have offered plausible alternatives too ... more plausible,
as far as I am concerned, than the one offered by GDW, FWIW. That doesn\'t mean
that I\'m right and they\'re wrong ... not at all. However, I believe that the
flaws arise from the knowledge that was available at the time when the original
design was done and that the arguments we\'re using to attack (or defend) the
matter are based on facts that have since come to light ... or, to be more
correct (since there are no exobiospheres to compare them against) the latest
scientific *opinions*.

Well, this is where we differ, for some of the reasons I\'ve mentioned above. I

And don\'t whinge if you get called out on something because you haven\'t noted

Actually, though I\'m not sure that you\'re right about the "present" (i.e. c
1100, Imperial, say), you *are* right, come to think of it (or more likely than
not) ... there is a statement *somewhere* to the effect that the Vilani always
considered the potential effects of tech (esp., IIRC, *medical* tech) before
they release it ... sometimes, it is implied, for generations, perhaps even
hundreds of years. This is actually a good explanation ... though it needs a
little more work. You could, for example, also assume that the Vilani *had* the
tech to deal with Terran diseases ... back in hi-security labs back on Vland or
some of the interior sectors, and didn\'t (or were slow to) release it when it
was needed. This may well explain the evident fact that some of the Vilani
dominated worlds more or less went over to the Solomani ... perhaps the failure
of the Vilani to "give a damn" meant that they welcomed the terrans because
*they* seemed to?

True, and fair enough. I\'ll go along with that.

I even agree about cloning. I *still* think that the limitation is the lack of
a memory transfer facility (and we disagree with this, too) ... *and* the
economic limitations, which hasn\'t been considered fully (cost of robots and
all that).

And that\'s where the problem is. Not impossible ... and, perhaps, it *will* be
the case in the above project (and *official* Trav4 one, but don\'t ask me
details of who and what!) ... but, FWIW, I suspect that it would take some
*real* mental contortions to do so.

As for the rest <snipped> re reasons for small families at present. I accept
and understand what you\'re getting at, I just am not convinced that you\'re on
the right track. We\'ll have to wait 50 years or so and see, I spose (if the Mad

Um, no. DGP wanted to move onto other projects, was taking too much money

You miss the goal here.  To mass-produce (mass-raise) children
produced by artificial wombs, you are dealing with products rather than
individual children.  Robotic houses/barracks/schools with labor-saving
devices and monitors would allow a few overseer/parents to take care of
many more kids than a traditional household.  Less "human," perhaps, but
it should turn out adequate soldiers and workers easily enough.

Consider reading CJ Cherryh\'s books that deal with AZI (_Cyteen_ series and
_40,000 in Gehenna_) for an interesting view of artificially raised populations.

No, but then all the Traveller culture we have seen has occurred some 3000
years after this time.

Certainly robotic child-care is less expensive than being overwhelmed by the
Vilani!  I also disbelieve that it would be "needlessly" dangerous.
Semi-intelligent
design at TL12 need not be particularly dangerous.

>Assuming that present day social trends continue,
A bad assumption.  Less than 100 years ago (heck, less than 50 years ago), large
families were a goal (actually, it was being able to afford a large
family...).  In 1970,
the average family in the US had 3.2 kids - down from earlier times.  That
has dropped
to less than 2 currently in the US.  But it had also been lower (than 3.2)
at other
low points in US economic history (1880s, 1930s)! The number fluctuates - it is
neither constant nor moving in a single direction.

>no-one is going to stand for that sort of time consuming effort
But they did!  And if you go back futher (1400s-1900s), you had as large a
family
as your farm could support - because that provided you with labor!

Let\'s a make a canon assumption - fusion power.  Vast amounts of cheap power
will drop the price of most of anything - allowing one to afford more children.
Particularly when coupled with a dispersion to the stars, would not raising
large
families begin to make sense if only in order to provide a population to
carry on
your particular (sub)culture?

I am not saying this is what occurred.  I am saying that "this could not happen"
is not the case.  Unless you plan to set a campaign IN that time period, I don\'t
see that it matters a lot.

Once upon a time, I ran a 200-ton ship through my universe, which was more
or less randomly generated using Classic Traveller.  Using Book2 economics
and some
routing based on trade notes, the ship made money hand over fist.

I, too, have always had trouble with the 10K ticket price - mostly because
it never
wavered from J1 to J6, the quality/reliability of the ride, or the
value/rarity of the
destination!

Wrong again, and presented, again, as incontrovertible fact.  Bah.

Classic Traveller\'s Supplement 8, Library Data A-M, p. 38:

"In addition to causing a great deal of destruction, the period of
the Civil War also caused tremendous social upheaval, and Vilani nobles and
industrialists began offering a serious challenge within the Imperium to the
entrenched Solomani economic and political structure."

Then there\'s more about Emperor Zhakirov "breaking the power of the Solomani
interests at court" by marrying Antiama (presumably of Vilani descent).

Phil, you\'ve ignored so much "canon" material (while praising the reliability
of "canon" over, say DGP) in frantic defense of your own positions -- can you
give the TML one good reason why we should continue to listen to your ill-
constructed arguments rather than just hitting the "d" key?

 I saw the message from dlawall@ix.netcom.com (Daniel J Lawall )
 and tried to reply via private mail - it bounced (no such host,
 which tells me that _my_ site\'s DNS is scragged [again]).  So, I\'m
 replying to the list, asking for either a repost, or that he mail
 me privately.

X::>XBOAT and ask for Jeff Zetlin, in regards to the RICE papers.  If Jeff

 The above is what appeared on the list.  What exactly would you
 like to know about RICE Papers?
