Hmm.  This depends on the rules set you\'re using.  I certainly didn\'t mean
to rate myself at the "top of the field" as either a writer or artist.  I
used the "rate yourself" system in the draft T5 chargen chapter (sort of).
Since I was using T4/T5 rules, I assumed much higher "professional" skill
levels. In T5, "Entertainers" (writers, artists, musicians, dancers, etc)
are considered famously brilliant at around level 9.

Best,

Interestingly, anyone with a smattering of Greek could guess one place to
find the Commandments.  \'Deuteronomy\' comes from words meaning \'second\'
and \'law\' because it\'s the second book (after Exodus) in which the
Commandments appear.  Interestingly, the two forms are slightly different,
though only in wording, not intent.

Go to my website (http://www.truserve.com/~igor/traveller/) and enter the
Ship Gallery - you can see two pictures that I\'ve done. The deckplans for
the LF-78 are being redone, and the stats for both are being typed up
(although the L-2 stats won\'t be available till after the THUDDD entry
period).

I think I\'m doing decent on modeling and texturing, but my composition
leaves a bit to be desired. I gotta work on starfields, nebulas, stars and
planets...

Many thanks to Lord DeGraff, Archduke of Traveller 3D Graphics, for his help
and support in teaching me this stuff...

Hopefully more to come soon (in the pipe: Atlantis class Gunboat and Silent
Thunder class Frigate), but I\'m also redoing the whole website now that I\'ve
got Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and Flash...

Also, while their action was heroic, it was futile. Because the orders
weren\'t clear, and when the commander asked "which guns?" the messenger
(may he burn in hell!) pointed and said "*Those* guns." He was wrong. 

This action is one of the main reasons why military academies have
courses on "How to Write An Order".

This was very tongue in cheek. I got megatraveller around the same time 
Windows started to become popular. I still don\'t like either one.

You can\'t teach EDU for for some reason. You can only teach skills up to
one level below your instruction skill or the level of the skill you are
teaching. If Joe has:
Traveller-4
Instruction-3
AD&D-2
GURPS-1

Joe can teach up to Traveller-2 and AD&D-1. He can\'t teach GURPS (this is
CT, no level 0 skills) and Instruction cannot be taught. This is really a
side effect of the instruction skill which is really to be used to train
troops in say, using a new weapon.

Um, yes he *can* teach Instruction.  But if that\'s how he makes his money, he *won\'t* teach it.

I think Doug is being a little PC here, in assuming that
Socialism/Communism equals Soviet/Chinese style Stalinism.  Remember, in
the TU, there\'s room for _everything_, somewhere.

I\'ve added some more to his list:

Gov\'t 0: No government.  Local communities and collectives run things. 
Might have happened if the Paris Commune had survived, and been joined by
other Communes.  (Commune is French for city, by the way.  Well, more or
less.)  

> Gov\'t 1: Corporation.  If the Party is the company, and the Workers are

> 
> Gov\'t 2: Participating Democracy.  Another utopian take on the idea.

> 
> Gov\'t 3: Self Perpetuating Oligarchy.  The People\'s republic of China
> after Mao would be a good example.. ruled by an inner circle of Party
> members, who don\'t need to answer to those they rule over.

Gov\'t 4: Might be multi-party, or may have rival factions in a single
party, or may allow non-party candidates.  Closest examples:  Nicaragua,
Paris Commune, the short-lived socialist state in Bavaria in about 1919 or
so, very early Soviet Union, with Left Socialist-Revolutionaries,
Anarchists and Mensheviks still hanging around.  Also:  the 1905 Petrograd
Soviet.  Could be quite likely if there are no outside threats hanging
around supporting attempts at counter-revolution.
  
Gov\'t 5: State apparatus functioning as a technocracy.

> Gov\'t 8 or 9:  Civil Service Bureaucracy and Impersonal Bureaucracy. 
> Both good "ground level views of the communist systems.  "The Party has
> determined that you are over your quota for air this quarter, comrades.
> Please adjust your breathing accordingly.  Spacebo."
> 
> Gov\'t A: Charismatic Dictator.  Josef Stalin, Mao, Fidel Castro..

Gov\'t B: Non-charismatic Dictator.  Brezhnev, Gorbachev, and the ones
between Stalin and Kruschev.  (Kruschev might qualify for Charismatic). 
Most of the Eastern European leaders. 

Gov\'t C: Charismatic Oligarchy.  The Party was the confidence of (most of)
the population.

ROFL!  Yeah.  I\'ve seen material produced by some of the madder "Socialist"
groups.  This one, and Gov\'t E, are definite possibilities!  There\'s plenty
of Leader cultism and dogmatism, that could well be assessed as religious
in character by outsiders, like the IISS.

A one party outcome is not a necessary assumption.  It\'s even less likely
in a situation where the "Revolution" happened 500 years ago, and its
results are set in stone.

The other thing to consider is that by TL F, at least, labour productivity
is quite remarkable.  It might not make sense to produce things in a
capitalist manner at this point, and might make more sense for stuff like
basic food, housing and clothing to be distributed free.

As for the Imperial response to Socialism/Communism - well, of course it\'s
true that the Nobility and the Megacorps would take a dim view of anything
that threatens their power and property.  On the other hand, the Imperium
could well have absorbed socialist worlds that developed during the Long
Night, and chose to go with the Imperial flow.  The state-run enterprises
of such worlds would just look like normal Pocket Empire "megacorps", as
far as the outside universe was concerned.

I tend to treat Dinom/Lanth as something like a Socialist state.  I assume
that the FFW took the edge off its radicalism, that the original Ine Givar
types have pretty much been purged, but that the major mines are at least
still notionally state run.  It has suffered from outside attacks, and at
least a degree of economic blockade.  This, the rarity of zuchai crystal,
plus a certain amount of genuine incompetence, has resulted in the economic
crisis that has resulted.  The xenophobia has come from the state of siege
that has existed, plus a certain parochialism in its now conservatised
leadership (kind of like the Stalinised Soviet Union).

Other worlds in the Spinward Marches that deal with this kind of stuff are
Tanoose, where there is pressure both for and against nationalising the
property of the Vilisan overlords, and Porozlo, where there is a conflict
between planetary and extra-planetary business interests.  There could well
be a "none of the above" camp in that situation.

The tie-in for TNE would be a world, or PE, that nationalised its high-tech
assets after the collapse, either to support a TED, or to prevent one from
re-emerging.  Scenario:  the Assault on Tractor Factory Number One.  (It
can still work crystalliron.)

Or since the jump drive reactor is supposed to be fast burn anyway, light
this baby up and drop the containment field instead of charging the jump

Challenger Deep in the Mariannas Trench is IIRC the deepest spot at
around 36,000 feet. That\'s almost *11* km.

Sure the abysal plains are "only" 3-5000 feet (~1-1.5 km), but they are
merely "average" depth.

Depends on what *type* of diving you are talking about. And whether you
are talking about suits where the diver is at ambient pressure or where
he is at "normal" pressure.

In MT terms the skill level is a bonus to your task roll, and  in
situations where an unskilled character is permitted to attempt a
task the lack of skill results in the task  being  a  grade  more
difficult (equivalent to a penalty of -4).  So  a  level-0  skill
gives no bonus or  penalty  and  permits  task  attempts  in  all
relevant cases.

With other systems YMMV.  (Or should that be YKmMV?)

IMHO neither "Andy" nor "Keith" seem much of a name for a place (too short)

Two points:

1) The UWP system also covers non-3I worlds as well so even if  a

   covered.

So then the question becomes: are there any government types  the

I think that as long as the local world still pays its  share  of
Imperial taxes then it comes down to how it deals with the  local
noble and any megacorporations affected.  Hence  the  possibility
of political intregue.

You\'re assuming that a world with billions of inhabitants needs
significantly more high Imperial officials than a world with a few million.
Is that necessarily so? I\'m not saying it isn\'t, but I don\'t see why it HAS
to be. And I can see one very good reason why it shouldn\'t: The Moot.
Imperial barons all have a seat in the Moot. Even 10,000 peers are unwieldy.
Millions don\'t bear thinking about (Unless you\'re George Lucas ;-).

>My gut feeling is that there is probably at least one baron per self-
>governing planet, no matter how unimportant

Agreed, although some peers have multiple titles, Norris being the prime
example. 

> -- and about one baron per 20-50 million people on a high-population
>world.

But that I don\'t think can be right. I\'d say 2-3 barons per higher noble
would be about right. If you assume that every world with a population
level of 7+ has a higher noble, you get about 2,800 marquesses and above.
If you assume an average of 2.5 barons apiece, you get a figure of 7,000
barons, for a total of 9,800 peers. Even that is a lot, and it assumes
that the other kinds of nobles are not peers, which is quite iffy.

Actually, there\'s no real reason to assume that there HAS to be more barons
than marquesses. It\'s a natural assumption, but it doesn\'t HAVE to be. Maybe
there\'s only one noble per self-governing world; if the world isn\'t powerful
enough, it gets a baron; if it is, it gets a higher noble. That would give
you a Moot of maybe 6,000 members. If most higher nobles has a baronial
title in addition to his main title, the way Norris and Leonard of Aramis
has, there may be even fewer.

>Any insights?  And yes, this is going into a book for GT if possible.

In that case you must remember that G:T switched the count and the marquis.
In GT it\'s the count who is in charge of a single world and the marquis
who is in charge of a small cluster. I can\'t say I understand why that was
done (I know that in the European system of nobility a marquis ranks higher
than a count, but I don\'t see why that means the Imperium can\'t have things
the other way around any more than they need viscounts just because England
had them (in the English nobility vicounts rank between barons and earls
(counts)), but there it is. It\'s an infernal nuisance, and I note that BtC
didn\'t follow up upon it, so perhaps you can persuade Loren to quietly drop
it again, but unless you do, you\'ll have to keep it in mind.

William F. Hostman writes:

That\'s not necessarily the way courtesy titles work. In England, if a noble
holds several titles, his eldest son may hold the second most important as
a courtesy title, but the title actually belongs to the father. At least, I
don\'t _think_ the son sits in the House of Lords until the father dies. If
I\'m wrong there, then the son is a peer.

>Based upon CT and MT Careers, it is likely that the following are true:

I\'m sticking my neck out here, because odds are two to one that either Marc
or Loren wrote the essay about Imperial nobles, but whoever it was IMO made
a big mistake when he turned the noble ranks from the character generation
system into Imperial nobles. Book 3 plainly speaks of planetary nobility
(there are two more ranks above duke, prince and king, and kings are actual
rulers of worlds). When social status 11+ was turned into Imperial nobility,
a whole section of society, the local planetary nobles, was cut out of the
system. You go directly from the gentry of SS 10 to the Imperial nobility.
But the character generation rules remained the same. Do not, I implore you,
consider the dukes you get from the CGR equivalent to real Imperial dukes.
That way lies madness.

>2) The navy and Marines tend to get "Courtesy Titles", especially upon

>Data, whether or not they get a fief is questionable.

IMTU they get Imperial knighthoods that makes them the equivalent of a
planetary baron/marquis/count/duke. The next step up AFTER social status
15 may get them an Imperial barony. Considering how many Imperial military
men there are, I don\'t think there is room for a fraction of a percent of
them in the Moot...

>Canon doesn\'t specify the nature or size of fiefs.

The essay on nobles in _Imperial Encyclopedia_ do specify the size of the
typical fief. I agree with you that the actual income derived from the
fief is more significant than its size and I, too, use other kinds of
fiefs and estates than land.

>An office has a "See" in the same manner a bishop does; the see is that

I have a similar concept although I call it a \'charge\'. When a world joins
the Imperium, it surrenders some of its sovereignty to the Emperor. He
delegates that sovereignty to his nobles. That\'s what makes the Imperium
a feudal structure. A subsector duke, for instance, is charged with
collecting Imperial taxes of his worlds and with raising and maintaining
a colonial army and navy, rights that the worlds in his subsector has
surrendered to the Emperor and the Emperor has turned over to him. If his
is a border subsector, he may also be responsible for their foreign
relations, but more likely the Emperor has delegated that to another, the
sector duke perhaps, or an Imperial envoy.

>The See of the Emperor is the Imperium,

IMO the Emperor owns the whole kit and kaboodle (the surrendered sovereignty,
that is, not the real estate). He dosen\'t have a see/charge. He has it all.


Chris Peers writes:

Actually, the essay that William refers to does state that to hold a high
office in the Imperium, you have to be a peer. Children of peers are not
considered peers themselves. What the essay does not make clear is just
what it means by \'high office\'. If it\'s Imperial minister a few hundred
peers would be enough. If it is planetary governor, you need thousands. If
it is Fleet Admiral you need tens of thousands.

In one particular age in one particular area, yes. Later that changed.

But the Imperium cannot be that kind of feudal system, because the Emperor
does not own most of the planets that he appoints nobles to. In most cases
they don\'t even rule them.

My preferred solution I\'ve already mentioned: To assume that the reward
titles are actually various Imperial knighthoods that makes the generals
and admirals peers of planetary barons and dukes (Though the highest
admirals might be important enough to rate Imperial noble titles).

Or get a seat in the Moot. Precisely. As I said, the bottom-up approach
to the system does not mesh with the top-down approach. It needs fixing.

It\'s not that i object to the \'a PC is special\' argument to explain away

using those systems to create NPCs...

That\'s pretty much the way I interpret it. It is odd even if you interpret
a ducal title as a planetary title, but it does help a little. It\'s a lot
beter than assuming that he wound up as Duke of Glisten.

>Certainly the career path doesn\'t give the character a fief at the end. . .

It can give him up to Cr600,000. That could represent a fief worth that
amount. Not much even for a planetary duke, I agree.

Check that LBB we\'ve been talking about. Two fiefs are mentioned: A baron
usually gets a personal fief of no more than 100 square kilometers. An
archduke usually gets an entire world. _IE_ added 1,000 km^2 for marquesses,
10,000 km^2 for counts and 100,000 km^2 for dukes.

How many roles do you think real Imperial barons  --  those who have a
seat in the Moot  --  actually play? I don\'t really see them getting into
anything much lower than subsector level administration (and their own
world, of course, but even that is sort of subsector-level).

>Meanwhile, it\'s clear that the baronage is the backbone of Imperial

I don\'t think it is so clear. The essay says \'high office\'. But how high
is high? Port Captain? Tax Assessor? Postmaster General? How many high
officials does the Imperium need per subsector? Remember that beneath the
barons you have Imperial bannerets (in effect, hereditary knights). Now
_there\'s_ an Imperial rank that might have millions of members.

It still puts them in the Moot. Give them a baronetcy if you want to give
them anything.

Duke of Regina (subsector), Count Aledon (not \'of\', it\'s his family name),
Marquis of Regina (system), and Baron of Yori.

That\'s about 600 million barons...

Out of curiosity I made a list of the canonical baronies that I can find. If
anyone can come up with more, please tell me:


Name            Population      Value[1]

Delcambre[2]    Unknown         Unknown
Feri            600 million     Imperial taxes worth MCr21,960. [3]
Klavos[4]       Unknown         Enough to buy a second-hand BROADSWORD class
                                mercenary cruiser and outfit it.
Lewis           24,000          Taxes worth MCr35. [3]
Yori            70 million      Imperial taxes worth MCr2,562. [3]



[1] Using GT figures and assuming that Imperial taxes amount to 1% of GWP.
[2] Barony given to Arabella von Erickson late in the 5FW (ie. a character
    generation type barony) [MTJ3].
[3] Less whatever the baron has to give to his liege lord.
[4] Barony on Adabicci/Lunion belonging to Gamaagin Kaashukiin who sold it
    to raise money to buy a privateer to go hunting Sword Worlders. [JTAS20]
[5] Since Lewis is the personal fief of Leonard of Aramis, taxes are
    assumed to be 25% of GWP.

Hmmm. That didn\'t help much. You\'d almost think it was made up by several
different people who didn\'t consider the implications much. ;-)

In the game the Indies (Independence Movement) use graffi for hull colors.
Makes their ships very colorful. This seems to indicate that model builder
will have good control over the color schemes of the ships.

In the base game the weapons and defensive systems are:

Particle Accelerators (close in work)
Explosive Missiles
Diseruptor Missile (for diserupting shields)
Shields (Two shields that can be focused on a target on the top half and a
target on the bottom half)

The problem is that each EDU point takes about a term, not six
weeks, so you first need a suitable candidate - ie someone who
should qualify as EDU 7 but skipped higher education.

>You can\'t teach EDU for for some reason.

I\'ll agree that it doesn\'t say you can but...

Effectively, you can in T4.1 (and probably T4/T5) where a character
can get to specific EDU scores by specific levels of education
- - that is if you teach them to read and write, they can have EDU 3,
qualifying for university is about EDU 7, completing a degree
EDU 8 (okay I\'m guessing here)

So all your instructor needs to do is register as an educational
establishment of the appropriate level. :-)

You can probably teach up to EDU-2, the time taken depending on
you Instruction skill (eg base time 4 years, less 6 months per
Instruction skill)

Then I guess you have never been to Duck N.C. or Ware V.A.

names.
  It\'s not the legnth of the name that is important its the story or person 
behind then name. Besides I think that the name "Keith" would fit in just 
fine in the Five Sisters subsector where there are four canidates to be 
renamed.(876-496 and 769-422 being the best canidates with populations).

Also just because a planet was given his name does not mean that then a ship 
can not be given it (and Vise versa).
in fact I want to see both.

formally known as Keith/Spinward Marches. Additionally the Emperor appointed 
Baron J. Andrew Keith as the Count of Keith sighting his many acts of 
loyalty and great service to the Imperium and the Emperor. Long live Count 
Andrew of Keith!

I imagine that the relationship isn\'t linear -- a world with 10 billion 
inhabitants
won\'t need 1,000 times as many high-level administrators as a world with
10 million.

Hmmmm.  Canon says that every Imperial noble -- at least members of
the peerage with hereditary titles -- has a seat in the Moot.  I rather doubt
that most of them actually use that seat, though.  Most of them appear
to vote by proxy, so that a nobleman who actually lives near Capital
can hold the proxies of many nobles out in the fringes.  I imagine the
Moot institutionalized the proxy vote centuries ago.  Thus the Moot
doesn\'t have to have the capacity to physically seat more than a (small)
fraction of the existing roster of Imperial peers.  Makes even a large
number of nobles easier to manage.  Meanwhile, most nobles will be
more involved with the court of their local sector duke or archduke.

Another point: I don\'t see why someone with a non-hereditary title (a "rank"
or "acheivement" noble) should be entitled to a seat in the Moot.  Someone
with a nominal barony due to his current position in the bureaucracy won\'t
have that privilege, any more than he would have a fief.

I can also imagine an agency of the Imperial bureaucracy whose purpose
is to help the Emperor keep track of all the high-noble families.  Aren\'t
there still institutions in Europe which officially keep track of bloodlines
and heraldry?  Something like that, to help reduce the burden on the
Emperor to personally evaluate every new heir or candidate for elevation.

All of which says that I don\'t have all that much problem with a large
number of Imperial barons.  Of course, a million or so *does* stretch
my willing suspension of disbelief.

What *is* the population of the Imperium, anyway?

    10,000 or so sounds very manageable, for the reasons I stated
above.  EVen a factor of 3-4 more than that shouldn\'t present an undue
burden.  Hmmm.  That would make it at least one baron per world,
with about one more per 250 million people.  I suspect 250 million
people on any Imperial planet will generate enough work for one peer,
no matter how "hands-off" the Imperium is.

    I do find it interesting that at least some Imperial barons in canon are
associated with whole worlds (Norris is Baron Yori, for example).  That
tends to indicate that a Baron can be associated with a single entire
world, like a marquis (or count, for GT).  Just not an important one.

    Again, I doubt that a "rank baron" or an "achievement baron" is
going to be entitled to a seat in the Moot.  Canon is silent on that
point, as far as I can tell, but it does indicate that such awards
don\'t carry any benefits beyond the title itself.  Presumably
that gets you a place in the system of precedence, but it wouldn\'t
get you voting privileges equal to those of the old families.

    I imagine the subsector-level administrator\'s post in any of the
Imperial bureaucratic agencies (Ministry of Justice, Ministry of
State, and so on) would just about have to be a peer.  Maybe the
layer just below that, too -- chief of staff, general counsel, and such.
That would imply a couple of dozen barons per subsector, minimum.
Large and important worlds would probably generate enough trade,
litigation in Imperial courts, and military activity to justify a few
peers of their own.

    On reflection, I think you\'re right.  Most of the mid-to-upper level
managers in the Imperial system are probably not peers.  Being a
peer should give you *authority*.

    Good point.  The last thing the Moot needs is to be growing

_Rebellion sourcebook_, for one (Or was it _Referee\'s Companion_?). But
that\'s just the extreme version. The one you suggest is more likely and
almost as bad.

Just to keep this straight, we are talking about some Aslan clan lord in,
say, Dark Nebula sector, who sends off an _ihatei_ fleet that is a threat
to the Domain of Deneb, right? That means that he is sending them off on
a journey where the ships he wants back is away for 3 to 4 years if they
are jump-3. Effectively they are able to defend him for, let\'s be
generous, 3-4 months out of every 3 years, or 10% of the time. If that
doesn\'t put him at a disadvantage against a neighbor who keeps his ships
at home, I don\'t know what does.

That is a fallacy that crops up with distressing regularity. While military
spending is good for the lucky part of the society that gets to build and
man the hardware, someone else (a lot of them) has to go without something
else (a lot of it). SOMEBODY ALWAYS PAYS. If a clan lord gives away his
military ships when they are 30 years old, he has to replace them more
often than his Imperial oppo. That means he can\'t afford as many. The
fact that his shipbuilding section will be burning incense in his praise
doesn\'t alter that.

Try a little experiment. Take your TCS rulebook. Decide how big a percentage
of the entire Domain of Deneb fleet forces (not just the Marches forces) was
destroyed, how much had major damage and how much had minor damage by 1110.
Work out how much the maintenance budget is reduced by that. Now work out
how much repair and new construction can be done in six years without even
increasing the budget (Don\'t forget the normal replacement rate of
2.5%/year). Now imagine that the Domain didn\'t remain at peacetime
spending during the 5FW, but went up to the canonical 15%. Add whatever
construction was underway when the 5FW ended. Finally, consider how likely
it is that the Marches didn\'t go all the way back to 1% spending on the day
of the armistice, but instead only down to, say, 2%.

It takes large forces to blockade a high-population world. It is also
boring, unprofitable, and unglamorous. Are the Vargr who keeps up such a
blockade really the same Vargr we\'ve seen described in _Vargr_? Not IMO.

You are 100% correct. That\'s how an Imperial Warrant is described in _The
Kinunir_. The part I take issue with is the \'bearer\' bit. There\'s no good
reason for it, and the potential for disaster in case it fell into
unauthorized hands is too great. No doubt every Imperial outfit will hunt
down and inflict the death of a thousand cuts on anyone stupid enough to
misuse a warrant, but that won\'t help clean up the mess,  will it? And we
know that there\'s no shortage of people who is incapable of realizing that
_they_ can ever be caught. Besides, if it is not possible to use a \'bearer\'
warrant without eventually getting caught, then the warrant in the 
_Kinunirs_ safe is the evillest PC trap I\'ve ever seen... >:->

Why run such a risk when all the Emperor has to do is to put a name (and a 
gene-scan) on the Warrant?

Here\'s a scenario I\'d like y\'all to ponder.

Far Trader _Marliiner_ has landed on the surface of a barren world.
Investigating the surface, they find the landscape pockmarked with
centuries-old ruins.  They also find an insectlike, crustacean-like
critter that burrows in nests all in/around the ruins.  These critters are
malevolent to the extreme, and the adventurers, at one point, wisely
destroy an entire nest by blasting its location with the ship\'s lasers.

The ship fires its lasers from a short distance at the surface of the planet...
say a 30- or 60-degree angle downwards.  What is the minimum safe
distance for ship\'s laser fire?  Please note that these lasers are 2-2-0-0,
which means they do 2 points of damage to a starship\'s armor at 30,000
kilometers.

My observations:

1) Targetting is not a problem.  The weapon-sensors are good enough
to lock onto a 10-dton object at up to 60,000 km.

2) There may be a distance so close to the target that the ship can
sustain damage.  I don\'t know what that distance is, nor do I know
how much damage it would inflict (surely no more than a point?).

3) If I very roughly translated starship damage to MT values, a 2-2-0-0
laser might do on the order of 2000 \'points\' of damage to a non-ship
target (a person in battledress, for example) at 30,000-60,000 km.
Does the area of effect increase as range decreases?

The amount of damage a ship can do to a localized area on a planet
is devastating.  I would like to know if there are any consequences
to the ship for blasting a planet\'s surface.

I can\'t agree with that. The formulas below are from page 133 of GURPS
vehicles. The depths don\'t get into the really ridiculous range (IMO) until
you get to Marine Commando Battle Dress GT:SM style. Depth is in yards
(meters). You\'ll have to convert to Atm. as I don\'t have depth tables handy.

(DR+10)x0.25x10=CD (yards) Extra light frame
(DR+10)x0.5x10=CD (yards) light frame
(DR+10)x1.0x10=CD (yards) medium frame
(DR+10)x2.0x10=CD (yards) heavy frame
(DR+10)x4.0x10=CD (yards) extra heavy frame

				DR
Combat Armor		20	(20+10)x0.5x10=70 (yards) light frame		63 m
Battle Dress		100	(100+10)x1.0x10=200 (yards) medium frame		91 m
Improved Battle Dress	120	(120+10)x1.0x10=220 (yards) medium frame		201 m
Sane Battle Dress		500	(500+10)x1.0x10=600 (yards) medium frame		548 m
Insane-Battle Dress	1400	(1400+10)x1.0x10=1500 (yards) medium frame	1371 m

Values of DR are from the lowest DR of pressurized container, typically
hands or limbs. Insane Battle dress in GT:SM only gives one DR. The Sane
Heavy Battle Dress I\'ve seen posted other places might have lower DR\'s on
limbs, hands etc. Just use this as a guide. I used light frame for the CA
and Medium frame for the others.

There are no mistakes, just plot opportunities.  Even though my games are
set in Lunion, I had never noticed that before, and it took me about ten
minutes to not only justify it, but come up with a campaign hook as well.

Z1. The baronage is the main pool from which the upper ranks
of Imperial bureaucracy are drawn.

Z2. There is probably at least one baron per self-governing planet.

Z3. Larger worlds probably have more barons.

I also agree with points from Hans Rancke-Madsen, mainly:

RM1. [re: the Moot] 10,000 peers are unwieldly

My own thoughts are here:

E1. There are barons, and there are barons.  Some barons are
regionally or locally recognized only.  This implies they may not
be in the Peerage...

E2. Nobility concentrates at the top.  High population worlds
will have more barons, simply because those worlds are more
important than others.  Tech Level might also play a minor role
in this, but I wouldn\'t bet that a TL F pop A world would have
more barons than a TL C pop A world.  A TL 4 world of course
might have fewer barons...

In the arbitrary and abstract case, consider population as an
indicator of how many barons a world has.  Using wild guesses,
we have:

pop 0-3: probably no barons (regional representation?)
pop 4-7: maybe (maybe not) 1 baron.
pop 8: probably 1 baron.
pop 9-A: probably around 10 barons.

TL 0-3: divide number of barons by 10
TL 4-8: divide number of barons by 2 (round up)
TL 9-B: no modifier
TL C-F: multiply number of barons by 2

(Individual worlds must be treated on a case-by-case basis,
however.  Exceptions occur.)

As for getting the Moot together, suffice it to say that most
won\'t bother going to every meeting, but rather a higher official
or even some proxies will attend, representing subsectors or
sectors or even domains if necessary.

That said, there may be an informal Grand Moot kind of thing
where once every decade every single voting Moot member
shows up at Capital for one humongous session of pomp,
ceremony, scandal, intrigue, backstabbing, legislation pushing,
parties, assassinations, and other political subtleties.

If it\'s my \'sane\' battledress it has an extra-heavy frame and crush depth (510)*4*10 = 20,400 yards = 2000+ atm.  However, I think it only had DR 250 in the lightest spots, so its actually about half that.  I\'d be surprised if the SM battledress doesn\'t also have an extra-heavy frame.

Most lasers in Traveller seem to be in the few hundred megajoule range.  If we assume 200 MJ, its equivalent to 50 kg of TNT, which can possibly do minor damage to a free trader out to 50 meters or so.

What is the minimum safe distance for ship\'s laser fire?
<snipped>

	I treat ship\'s lasers as AFV lasers for effect on
	planet-bound targets.  As such, collateral damage is
	unlikely more than 5 m from the primary target.  
	Within that radius, I would consider attacking the ship
	with the equivelent of a GL firing HE.  This means that
	IMTU it may take a number of shots (1 per personal cmbt
	round) to destroy a nest of critters (and if they are

Doug just did a quite credible job of mapping the existing government
types onto socialist and communist *economies*.  That\'s the key insight,
here; while there are obviously strong couplings between them, government
and economy are separate, and there\'s no reason why one can\'t have (say) a
communist democracy, or a socialist monarchy.

Trouble is that anarchy, or highly fractured government, is the least
stable form of social organization.  Inevitably enclaves will fuse and
grow, just to get economies of scale and in order to counter the guys
across the river, who are also fusing and growing.

This leads off into Banksian "hypercommunism," in which there\'s a massive
superabundance of anything within reason, and in which people are also on
the whole better socially adjusted to *be* reasonable.  There\'s a lovely
minor subplot in one of his books in which a character gets utterly
enraptured by the primitive notion of private property, and decides he
wants to \'own\' something.  The ship he\'s on obligingly fabricates a
grapefruit-sized diamond and declares it to be his alone; he carries it
around proudly for a few days before getting bored with it.  He starts
carelessly leaving it lying around, several people trip over it or stub
their toes on it, and finally (with the owner\'s consent) they eject the
thing.

Probably not so.  I can see non-nobles recoiling in horror
at the sight of one lying on the sidewalk:

Dramatis Personae

PC 1: "Mr. Nervous"
PC 2: "Mr. Gung-Ho"

Ref:   "You are walking down the street in Startown.  PC1 notices
a certain scrap of paper in the gutter."

PC 1: "I look at it closely.  Is it local cash, or a ship\'s title deed?"

Ref: "You recognize it from a picture on trideo. It is an Imperial
Warrant."

PC 1:"Holy crap, man, an Imperial Warrant!  Let\'s get out of here
before they raze the entire block!"

PC 2: "No.  I retrieve the warrant first...  The Emperor Himself might
give us battledresses as reward..."

PC 1: "WHAT have you been smoking?  They\'d chop us to gibbets
before we got anywhere NEAR the Emperor!"

PC 2: "No way, look here: \'You are ordered to help the bearer in
any way you can because he is working for the best interests of the
Imperium\'.  It\'s a gold mine, man!"

PC 1: "I dunno..."

Ref: "You notice that people who were on the road with you have
scurried off in all directions after seeing the paper.  Some are running
indoors, while others are just hurrying down the street."

PC 2: "Ho hum.  Ok, we go to the nearest arms dealer to buy some
battledress and PCMP-13s.  No, better make that FGMP-15!  Yeah!"

PC 1: "I\'m outta here!"

PC 2: "Don\'t be a wimp; the ref wouldn\'t have given this to us unless
he wanted us to USE it, right?"

PC 1: "Well.."

Ref: "Well.."

PC 2: "And the only proper way that WE could POSSIBLY use it
is to get cool stuff and go out and blow up Zhodani, right?"

PC 1: "Well..."

Ref: (Desperately trying to contain the players\' imagination) "You
see several Imperial Marines in full uniform walking down the center
of the road, weapons ready.  They seem to be covering the block
as if looking for someone (dramatic pause) or someTHING."

PC 2: "Okay, we get out of here and get back to the ship."

Ref: "They have spotted you, and one says \'You two there!  Halt!\'"

PC 2: "We\'re too far away, we can\'t hear them."

PC 1: "Yeah!"

Ref: "The marine hailing you is using his suit\'s bullhorn."

PC 1: "Uh oh"

PC 2: "Well, we duck into a side street and lose \'em."

Ref: "They are too close for you to lose them."

PC 2: "WHAT??  Look, I\'m not my PC, am I?  I have skills
here (waves character sheet) that shows I am a SURVIVOR.
And that means I can get away whenever I want to.  Of course
*I* don\'t know how to escape, but my *character* does.  That\'s
role playing!  Now are we back at our ship yet?"


I seem to have digressed a bit, as this scenario has taken on a
life of its own.  Suffice it to say that, just like battledress, Imperial
Warrants should be used by the referee with the utmost caution.

What if all the other lords did the same? They all have the problem with the ihatei, so they all need to get rid of them... That would create an equilibrium - maybe not a very stable one, though :-)

Hmm... Well, the "SOMEBODY ALWAYS PAYS" part is actually a subject of much debate in today\'s politics, and has been at least since (in the thirties or forties, IIRC) John Maynard Keynes first put forth his theory about the benefits of government spending. According to this theory, an expansive financial policy not only means that the government employees earn money, but they pay taxes and buy other goods, which helps put more people into work, who pay taxes and buy other goods, etc.

In fact, in a modern western economy, money typically circulates through the same person or organization two to three times a year, somewhat supporting the above theory.

It is still true that an Aslan lord who needs to replace his ships at 30 years intervals will be at a disadvantage against Imperials, but first, the Aslan are not at war with the third Imperium, and two, most Aslan lords are placed _very_ far from the Imperium.

BTW, although I have a masters degree (and a little more) in economics, I\'m am personally not convinced that Keynes\' theory is true - on the other hand, neither am I convinced that it is false :-) So this posting should not be considered as having anything to do with any *current* political debate...

I don\'t agree with this from a psychological point of view. I think people 
need a sense of ownership of some items. I also think this stems for personal 
space and privacy issues (which means it\'s variable depending on cultural 
norms). As an example, look at Israeli Kibbutz\'s or hunter-gatherer 
societies. MOST items are held in communal ownership, but certain items such 
as toiletries, clothing, and weapons (sometimes), are considered personal and 
thus "privately owned". I ask anyone on this list if they would be willing to 
share their LBB\'s....As a personal example, in my household the vast majority 
of items are considered communal, but my "stuff" (mostly my hobby items) are 
clearly "mine", and my wife\'s "stuff" is clearly hers. This doesn\'t mean we 
can\'t touch them, but you get the idea... I think even if I lived in a utopia 
where I could get anything I wanted at a whim, I would still have a need for 
my "space", especially if it involves something I CREATED myself...

TANSTAAFL.  Government employees pumping money into the economy is
simply a matter of robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Well, they *can\'t* send them into either Dark Nebula or Reavers\' Deep without 
serious repercussions.  The Peace of Ftahalr would prohibit it, and *noe* 
thing that Aslans are famous for is keeping their word.  It is interesting to 
note that the area behind the Claw is *NOT* covered in the Peace.  <grin>

<snippage>

> It is still true that an Aslan lord who needs to replace his ships at 30 years intervals will be at a disadvantage against Imperials, but first, the Aslan are not at war with the third Imperium, and two, most Aslan lords are placed _very_ far from the Imperium.

First off, I\'d see a lot of those 30 year old ships (and a lot of them would 
be a *lot* older than 30 years old, btw) as being gunned merchants, not 
necessarily warships from the keel on up.  Thus, their \'out of pocket cash\' 
flow would be reduced somewhat.  Second, the Aslans are about 30 parsecs from 
the Imperium and the Solomani Confederation at their nearest points: in 
Reavers\' Deep and Dark Nebula.  It was a created buffer zone between the 
Aslans and the Sollies/Imperium, created by the Peace, and *strenuously* 
adhered to by the Aslans.

Well, no, by definition \'overtaxing\' means excessive taxation, which must then have deleterious effects.  The issue of debate is what level of taxation is excessive ;)

Of course there is a reason for it; re-read the scene in "The Three
Musketeers" where the Countess de Winter gets Cardinal Richelieu to
issue her the original inspiration for the Imperial Warrant.  The
reason: plausible deniability.  De Winter wanted the warrant to CYA
herself against Richelieu later having her hanged for the assassination
he was commissioning, and Richelieu didn\'t want to explicitly spell
out that he was commissioning an assassination on paper. "the bearer"
allows him to shaft de Winter later, anyway, by claiming that the warrant
obviously fell in the wrong hands. (If he\'d wanted to--it never got that
far) It also provided the plot device for D\'Artagnan to get away with
his actions when he got his hands on the warrant.

To sum up: two reasons for "bearer-warrants": plausible 
deniability, and plot device.  One in-game, one game mechanic.

(And it was a cool bit in "The Three Musketeers"...)

Funny, every version of CT I\'ve seen has 0-level skills.... see weapons
expertise (Traveller Book, p21) and the section on default skills, (ibid,
p29). Besides, Instruction is not available unless you use Supp 4, Bk 4,
Bk5, bk6 or bk 7.

One of the other things I have done in order to make sense of PC Dukes,
especially from the Noble career, is assume that some offices are
subordinate offices, for example:

His Grace, Wm Hamford, Court Duke of Regina, Castellan to His Grace, the
Duke of Regina. Put him right up there in the big-wigs, but NOT as a ruler.
He was enfeofed with a small vinyard estate in the subsector, and for his
county and marquisates, he\'d recieved minor bodies in the regina system
(Read as large asteroids to do with as he pleased, so long as he doesn\'t
sell them whole!).

The noble career in Supp 4 (and MT) is obviously some form of
interplanetary traveller, just look at the skills and goodies. I don\'t feel
it would work well for planetary nobility (which, BTW, I use IMTU;
Planetary Barons rank below imperial barons, higer ranks rate between
imperial barons and viscounts, at least through dukes, and generally get a
corresponding imperial title, and planetary archdukes, prices, kings,
emperors, and such usually get an imperial title of Marquis.)

Keynes\' point was that an economy does not necessarily quickly return to its long-run, full-
employment equilibrium.  A little government deficit-spending "pump priming" could stimulate it 
and move it to that equilibrium more quickly, thus saving everyone a lot of economic pain.  

Keynesianism does _not_ say that government spending can somehow create a "free lunch" where 
nobody pays.

obtrav: An Aslan lord might be advised by his wives to pay to equip an ihatei fleet only if his 
clan\'s economy were in a persistent slump.

I get the sense that this is true for the Culture (Banks\' hypercommunist
society) as well.  Several characters have trinkets or clothing or the
like which they are fondly attached to.  It\'s just that in a world where
anything can be fabricated effortlessly on demand, nothing below the scale
of a starship has \'intrinsic\' worth enough to be an \'economic object\'; all
objects\' values are sentimental and personal.  I don\'t steal your hat not
because it\'s your \'property\', but because I know you like it, I\'m polite,
and I can fabricate one just like it in two seconds...though this in
itself might be considered rather gauche.  It\'s a subtle difference, but
one I find I can understand well and imagine living with. 

And again, it\'s pretty clear (though kept mostly implicit) that a good
deal of social and genetic engineering has been done to make its citizens
fit the Culture, limiting their greed and avarice, mostly through shared
sense of "appropriateness," of what constitutes undue and uncivilized
excess and will earn you social disapproval.

The Traveller cardboard heroes were 15mm.s. The fantasy cardboard heroes were

Ariane - current most successful commercial launcher IIRC.

The UK space programme is part of the European Space Agencies\' effort to a
greater extent. Most funds (again IIRC) are focused on remote sensing. And
we build a lot of solar panels (ISTR the Intl Space stn and the Hubble have
BAe panels).

It\'s not a big programme; shame they didn\'t fund HOTOL.

The Intrepid Grav Tank has DR 10,000 and Extra Heavy Frame.

I have been trying to figure the frame strength required for ships given a G
rating. I presume there is some way of converting crush depth force to equate to
an acceleration force. One atmosphere = 1 kg per square cm.

How would I convert that to check for maximum G rating of a ship? 

A 1G Beowulf masses around 250 tonnes, so when accelerating it undergoes a force
of 2,500,000 Newton\'s.

A standard non-military ship in GT has DR 100, medium frame, giving a crush
depth of 1100 yards (ignoring the divide by 2 for a non submersible hull). How
many atmospheres is this? 

How do I convert between the two?

Well, GURPS Vehicles is a bit inconsistent here; for the most part, DR is not added to frame strength at all (thus, the fact it affects crush depth is inconsistent).  Given other formulae, a relatively realistic max thrust for an uncompensated ship is 0.1 tons per body hit point.

Can I throw my hat into the ring? The best suggestion I have seen so far is Jeff
Zeitlin\'s.

Either create the "J. Andrew Keith"-class as a class of IISS survey vessels, OR
name a single large IISS vessel as the "J. Andrew Keith" (my personal
preference).

If the latter is chosen, can I add weight to the AHL choice? I think it is *the*
canonical "large Traveller vessel", even more so than the Tigress - it is more
detailed, had complete plans done, and has a full history. This attention to
detail is a hallmark of the Keith brothers\' work, and here is a way it can be
honoured.

Keynes made the same mistake that Marx did; they didn\'t take into account 
human selfishness. Keynes (if I remember correctly...) stated that the 
deficit spending to eliminate recessions should be offset by the Government 
overtaxing during good times. This would serve the twofold purpose 1) 
fighting inflation and 2) creating a surplus for fighting the next recession. 
The problem is that people don\'t want to pay during the good times, yet want 
help during the bad times, (and politicians take full advantage of this, 
using the power of taxing and government spending as vote bribery...) which 
creates the debt...Likewise Communism doesn\'t work because you need people 
who are willing to selflessly work for the benefit of the whole, and 
leaders/managers who won\'t exploit the system for their own gain. I for one

of capitalism (myself included). After all, I want enough extra income to buy

One of the changes that should be made to MT, IMHO, is to divide the stated
damage for starship weaponry by 10. (The following figures are from memory -
they\'ll be a little off, but in the right ballpark). This means that a Y-gun
does (about) 30d6 damage, while a ship\'s laser does 60d6 damage (with a much
greater Pen, of course). To me, this gives a better feel for the range of
weaponry, rather than having "mega-damage" weapons aboard ship (Rifts players
will understand).

To forestall criticism from FF&S gearheads (e.g. "a ship\'s laser has a 1 m
mirror rather than a tank\'s 10 cm mirror, therefore bigger area therefore more
damage" etc etc), I made this decision IMTU as more of a game balance thing. It
still makes starship weapons fearsome - I don\'t care if you are in BD, if you
are hit, you\'ll fry - but keeps them on the same scale as the rest of the
weaponry in MT.

BTW, this is in addition to the TML errata that multiplies the MT starship hit
points by 10. Forex, a ship\'s fusion gun (Pen 103, Dam ? 80?) vs a scout ship
(AV 40, 100? HP) will still pretty much toast the ship as per the ship combat
rules, but not totally and utterly and completely catastrophically destroy it
(i.e. the original 800d6 vs 100 hp = no ship any more, at all, not even one
little bit).

The area of effect of the weapon (Rob\'s original question!) is given in
_Striker_, and possibly in MT. My rules are at home, so can someone else look up
_Striker: Book 2_, "Integrating Striker with HG" or the MT Player\'s Manual?

You don\'t. The stresses are too different. G-rating bracing is along
the thrust axis, and in only one direction along that axis. "Crush"
bracing is "radially" oriented. And braced against *inward* forces.

Do you have any details?  I just checked the _Pyramid_ site (one of the
best sources for game industry news), and didn\'t see anything about
White Wolf.

They did, however, have a very nice tribute to J. Andrew Keith (dated 26
Oct 99), with a pretty complete list of his published Traveller
material, and a tribute by Loren....

I think its a further sign that the industry has matured enough that
mainstream buyers are willing to buy.  At the sametime we may also be seeing
adult gammers being put in decision makeing places.

WHITE WOLF HAS BEEN SOLD!
       I (Webmaster Chris) have just been informed that White Wolf has been sold.
After an oddly short meeting today, I was informed that I should prepare to redirect our
website to the new owners website tomorrow. At this time it is unclear whether they will
continue to produce White Wolf products. As far
as I have been told, they are an Internet-Only company.  They are some sort of marketing
firm that is
looking to tap the free-thought ideals" of White Wolf\'s audience or some such. I\'m glad
that I could at
least have an opportunity to break the news to you, I\'m sure press releases will follow
tomorrow. I will still be here for a few more days working to redirect all of our IP
adresses and domains to them. Tomorrow I will be forwarding this site to their new
homepage.  They assure me that all of our info will remain online and available for now.

So long and thanks for all the fish!

Hmmm, White Wolf sold to a marketing firm...  Yep, sounds like a perfect fit

Yeah, that\'s right.  I didn\'t actually contradict anything Doug wrote.  I

Well, Gov\'t 0 is in the books....

It could also be that the enclaves aren\'t actually in competition with each
other, and instead cooperate, or else have no real contact with each other.
Enclaves can also split, rather than fuse.

It\'s a good story.  Seth points out some of the problems with it.

In any case, I doubt we would go so far as this in Traveller games, if only
because it\'s hard to write decent stories set in Utopia.  But there is a
good thing about Utopia, and that is that you can only ever approach it,
and never get there.  If you are operating with finite resources, you will
always be subject to the limits of those resources, even if they are
massively greater than what we possess today.

This means that your utopian high tech world might have trouble supporting
its society.  It is also likely to mean that there will be other worlds
around who are less fortunate, and will be tempted to cut themselves in for
a piece of the action.  In short, Utopia might need to be armed, if it is
incapable of spreading its resources throughout the known universe...  It
just got less utopian, didn\'t it?

Then of course, what about the inward looking high tech, high pop worlds
that Cleon\'s forces encountered?  Some of these could have been doing quite
well for themselves, but would be forced to deal with a universe that
suddenly becomes less friendly, with pushy and powerful neighbours suddenly
insisting that they should open their "markets" to all this junk that will
throw the economic plan off target.  And what the hell is a "market"
anyway?

Certainly true for Solomani Humans.  Certainly untrue for at least some
aliens.  True to varying degrees for most other species and cultures.  Of
course, in a whole bunch of jobs in our societies, people "create" a whole
lot of things that they do not retain ownership of, whether it\'s computer
software, cars, houses....  Of course, I understand that\'s not what you
mean.

"Personal" property is, as you note, not really the same thing as "private"
property.  Bill Gates\' toothbrush is not the same as Microsoft.

Of course, in certain situations, this could be modified in the OTU.  For
example, a toothbrush that contained uninfected chips could well be
appropriated for use in a TNE setting.  The alternative is that the
hospital might not be able to repair the equipment necessary to save a
child\'s life....

Don\'t believe everything you read.  (Of course, that applies equally well
to this counter-rumor.)  A fairly reliable source notes that the
"purchasing" site is registered to WW as well, and is featured in their new
RPG release, HUNTER: The Reckoning.  (The site in question being
http://www.anonymous-liberty.com .)

In other words, this could all be yet another big half-baked WW publicity
stunt.

To be fair, it\'ll get tranlated into "Space Hack" (their fictitious 
D&D-in-space game) on general principle, but they\'re reasonably open-minded 
about good story lines...  Too, KenzerCo are gamers, I understand, and 
probably DO know about Traveller!

Actually, at the last minute I\'ve discovered a critical error in the Faldor
Maps, and am currently correcting it. 
My point being that I have halted printing on the Faldor supplement and
could still easily make changes to the manuscript.

This being the case...

Are there any major objections to my changing the name of one of the outer
(secondary) planets of the Faldor system to Keith? This planet is not
central to the supplement (Andrew uses it as the setting for a couple of
minor adventure hooks), and renaming it would not adversely affect the
supplement in any way.

Comments?  Yes/no? Cries of outrage/applause?

Please post your thoughts on the subject within the next few days and I\'ll
decide before I resume printing Faldor this weekend.

L8r,
Paul Sanders

P.S. Yes - I am printing all the other supplements in every spare moment.

	My copy of Striker gives no area of effect for lasers. Just does damage
to the target (if you hit it). The plasma, fusion, and meson guns (and
explosives) have a burst radius, but not lasers. According to the
Striker design sequence, a TL 12 250 MW laser has a penetration of 48.
This will penetrate about 4.6m of packed earth and about 23.3m of loose
earth. So for digging ugly creatures from their dens, it works well.

That is because we don\'t have anything solid yet to report.  That, and Scott
(the editor) is probably asleep as I am writing this. :)

While I have no concrete proof that this is factual or a hoax, one thing has
raised my eyebrows.  Bruce Baugh, a proflic (and really good) writer for White
Wolf, publicly said this on alt.games.whitewolf:

<snip>
I just talked to one of the developers at White Wolf. He says an actual
announcement is coming, and that while nondisclosure kept him from giving me
many details, this wasn\'t affecting the existing lines as nearly as he
knew. He
gave off a very strong sense of "don\'t panic", which I take the liberty of
passing along.

Now back to meeting deadlines.
</snip>


While right now I seriously doubt that White Wolf has "bit the dust", it is
certainly food for thought, eh?

  At least the Adventurers set actually had nineteen different illo\'s

While SJ Games hasn\'t decided what scale to make them (or if they are going
to make them at all), my gut instinct is that it would match the recent
Cardboard Heroes reprint, and be 25mm.  While I could be wrong, it would
made sense from the POV of the company to have compatible figures.

My maps by Seeker (the Lab Ship and a Corporation Building) are both done
in 25mm.

Considering that the 4 border clans on Reavers\' Deep aren\'t gonna let ihatei 
rimward unless they\'re organised as a mercenary company, and the clans on the 
trailing border of Dark Nebula are bound by the same agreement (the Peace of 
Ftahalr, to be exact), they don\'t have much choice.  But what I *do* see as 
the most likely scenario is the clan lords cut a deal with their neighbors to 
transport their ihatei to the neighbor\'s territory, pay them off a bit with 
some cash & future considerations to be named later, and the neighbor passes 
them through to the *next* clan lord in line with the same deal.  Say, Clan A 
has an abundance of ihatei, and has a deal with Clan B to allow them to pass 
through Clan B\'s space in Clan B\'s shipping.  They get to Clan C space with a 
fraction of the ships that originally went to Clan B; the old clunkers that 
weren\'t worth bringing back to top spec.  The rest of the ships come home.  
And they only leave Clan A\'s space for a couple weeks.  Keep in mind that 
Clan A and Clan B number in the *millions*, possibly *billions*, so a few 
ships leaving aren\'t going to hurt them much.  They transverse Clan B\'s space 
into Clan C\'s territory.  Now, they get a choice, continue on toward the 
Marches, or hire out as mercenaries to Clan C.  <grin>  They help out Clan C 
for a couple years and can afford to hire their *own* transport, maybe 
capture a couple ships of their own to add to their fleet for use in the 
Marches.  Or, hire out to Clan D as to not be operating near Clan B\'s space 
and possibly cause problems for Clan A.

First off, the 29 major clans number in the *millions*, if not *billions*.  
That\'s why they\'re the *major* clans.  Second off, not *all* of the obsoleted 
and surplussed ships are going to be warships.  Most of them would be armed 
merchants and scout ships, relatively cheap to knock out.  These would be 
second-line ships, *not* cutting edge military stuff; the clan chiefs would 
keep them for themselves.  And *some* of those ships will be chartered boats 
hired to simply transport the ihatei across the Rift.

Don\'t happen to have TCS anymore.  It came up missing someplace in the last 3

I think they\'d want to keep it above 2% for awhile.  Remember, there wasn\'t a 
*lot* of time between the 4th Frontier War and the 5th.  And there\'s no 
guarantee at the end of the 5th Frontier War that things won\'t flare up at a 
moment\'s notice.

High pop worlds get a lot of shipping.  That means the Vargr gunners get a 
*lot* of target practice.  And the ones who want to really jack their 
charisma up do runs against the planetary defense systems to grind it down a 
bit.

Well, Swedish income tax comes to mind.  From what I hear, some people are 
getting taxed at something like 105% of their salaries in the higher tax 
brackets...

That\'s terrible...in the UK, we only tax the poor at over 100%.

<rant>

As far  as  government  spending  is  concerned  (as  opposed  to
corporate involvement) the UK contributes  2%  of  ESA\'s  budget,
while France contributes 60%.

The UK government seems almost anti-space.  They dropped  out  of
rocket research after their first successful test  launch  ("Blue
Streak") because they could see no economic purpose  in  it.  Two
years later the multi-million dollar  satellite  launch  industry
started.

Margaret Thatcher negotiated a reduction in ESA\'s future plans to
prevent the UK\'s miserley contribution look even smaller.

And after cancelling their involvement in HOTOL the  Ministry  of
Defense tried to block attempts  to  find  international  funding
stating that the advanced  technologies  involved  were  national
secrets.

Gov 0, IMHO, is best modeled by group like the Scottish clans.  Each family
tends to it\'s own affairs until there\'s a threat to the common good.  When
that happens you\'ll see a very temporary and loose alliance to oust the
invaders.  Then everybody goes back to minding their own business.

To be honest, I\'ve never seen any application of socialism or communism
that didn\'t require extensive centralized controls to function.  That
disqualifies Gov 0 as a true contender, once again IMHO.

Hmm.  Memo to Traveller Socialist Conspiracy:  
I recommend that the Cheka should have a word with Comrade Berry.  He seems
to be experiencing difficulties understanding the concept of the withering
away of the state.

Seriously, though, there\'s not a whole lot of point in us going off onto an
OT discussion of this.  There\'s not reason why we shouldn\'t take the
Anarchists a little seriously, for the sake of the game, but then again, we
don\'t have to if it\'s not interesting.

There could be a lot of fun, though, when PCs land on a Law Level 0 world,
and discover that they can\'t buy guns.  Of course, you would need to brush
up on your Monty Python skills before you tried to run an
Anarcho-syndicalist commune...

A very similar fashion to how Heinlein\'s colony ran at its peak in "The Moon
is a Harsh Mistress." I don\'t really think that it\'s the only way for a
world with a Government Code code 0 to function.

Fair enough, in the real world, but not in theory. Personally, I feel that I
might as well hit theory for a little variety now and again. ;)

Here in Canada we pay a surtax on our income tax. If your provincial income tax
(which is a percentage of federal income tax) is above a certain amount, the
surtax of 4 or 5 percent of your provincial tax kicks in, and is added to your
bill.

Gotta love it.  :-(

Here in Indiana, U.S., we pay a 6% state sales tax on our auto licenses --

No, the choice they have is between sending off a tiny number of their
_ihatei_ and have adequate defenses or sending off a small number of their
_ihatei_ and be vulnerable to any neighboring clan lord who didn\'t. 

>...But what I *do* see as the most likely scenario is the clan lords cut a

There\'s the joker right there. \'Pay them off\'. Any money spent on _ihatei_
is money not available for defense. My argument is not that clan lords do
not send off _ihatei_; they do. My argument is about how many they send
off and how powerful they are.

>...to be named later, and the neighbor passes them through to the *next*
>clan lord in line with the same deal.

The payment the neighbor gives his neighbor has to be deducted from the
profit he makes from the original clan lord, which means the original
clan lord must pay enough to compensate his neighbor for that. However
long the chain is, it\'s the original clan lord who pays in the end.

Of course, that\'s not the way canon says _ihatei_ are sent off. All the
information we have states that the original clan lord gives his _ihatei_
some ships and sends them off into the wild blue yonder. But let\'s say
they do it your way. Now they arrive at Clan L or P or Z or XX, located at
the edge of Aslan space in Trojan Reach, about a dozen parsecs from
Imperial space. How do they get the rest of the way? Do they book passage
an interface liner (and what do they pay with) or does the lord of Clan XX
give them a dozen starships? Who compensates him for their loss? And what
does he give to the next bunch of _ihatei_? Believe me, the original clan
lord still has to pay.

>Keep in mind that Clan A and Clan B number in the *millions*, possibly
>*billions*, so a few ships leaving aren\'t going to hurt them much.

No, but a few ships isn\'t going to carry very many _ihatei_ either. It\'s
not the existense of _ihatei_ I dispute. It\'s the existence of _ihatei_
in numbers and with equipment enough to pose a credible threat to a
political entity the size of the Domain of Deneb.

>>he has to replace them more often than his Imperial oppo. That means he

>
>First off, the 29 major clans number in the *millions*, if not *billions*.  

Actually, IMO many of the big clans number in the billions and the 29
numbers in the tens of billions. But no matter how powerful a clan is, it
is less powerful than a coalition of its peers. And we know from canon
that there\'s always a couple of clan wars going on somewhere in the
hierate. I don\'t say a clan won\'t spend any money on its _ihatei_. I\'m
saying that it will spend more, much more, on its military.

And relatively cheap to knock off. If an _ihatei_ ship is an armed merchant
or a scout, what chance does it have against even an obsolete, second-line
Imperial colonial navy cruiser, let alone a regular fleet unit? Once again,
I\'m not saying _ihatei_ won\'t exist, I\'m saying they won\'t be able to 
present a serious threat to the Domain.

well, at double the normal peacetime budget, they could have been wiped out

High pop worlds have massive defenses. That means the Vargr gunners would
get even more practice being targets unless they have LARGE forces. We\'re
back to the canonical fact that Vargr corsairs are only a tiny (though
highly visible) fraction of Vargr society.

That\'s a recipe for evolution in action if ever I heard one. Eventually all

Fair enough. But that still squeezes a number of what I consider should
have been separate social classes (_especially_ considering that the lower
and middle classes have 9 separate levels to themselves) into one or at
most two Traveller social classes.

If you\'re SOC F, you can hobnob with people like Duchess Delphine. How

Yes, I realize the source of the original, but the analogy is a false one.
The \'warrant\' that Richelieu gave Mylady was not the 17th Century counterpart
of an Imperial warrant. It didn\'t empower Mylady to go down to Le Havre and
commandeer a squadron of ships and sail off to seize a Spanish treasure
fleet or some such. Athos himself said it best: "That is absolution as good
as any". It was a pardon, a "get out of jail free" card. An Imperial Warrant
is so much more than that.

If you want to give your players a "Three Musketeer" type plot device, you
can do it, and you don\'t need an imperial warrant to do so. "In case of
any legal entanglements, please refer the bearer of this to the Office of
the Duke of Glisten" Signed <Name unreadable>.
 
>(And it was a cool bit in "The Three Musketeers"...)

It sure was. In a Paranoia campaign I once gave one of the players a note
with the words: "It is with my knowledge and for the good of Alpha Complex
that the bearer of this has done what he has done. The Computer". The poor
sap was so pleased. At first...

I\'ve been thinking about antimatter drives.  How would they work?  Let\'s
say you somehow have access to fairly large amounts of antimatter, what
would be the best way to use it to send a ship forward?  Would simply
allowing it to react with an equal mass of normal matter be efficient?  I
mean, my basic view of an antimatter rocket is just that:  You feed a
stream of antimatter into a chamber where it encounters a stream of normal
matter.  They annihilate and you direct the energy out the back of the
ship.  

But then I got to wondering, isn\'t most of the energy produced going to be
in the form of gamma rays and other "high energy" forms?  How easy is it
to "redirect" this?  How much thrust would you get by forcing this out the
back of the ship? Do you need reaction mass?  Then I thought "I have no
idea, I\'ll ask the friendly folks at the TML!"  And here we are... :-)

Now that the reindroduction\'s formally over, I\'d like to make a few
contributions to some ongoing threads.  I hope I can make a meaningful
contribution to discussion this time around.  I mean, it\'s all such
important stuff, and it\'s not like this is just science-fiction!  This is
science.

1)  Everyone with a BRAIN in their head knows that Strephon only gave
Imperial Warrants to degenerate liberal-policy-children intent only on
furthering their homosexual agenda, like Norris. 

2)  Battledress certainly can withstand crushing pressures of many
thousands of atmospheres, because they have to:  Imperial Marines are so
incompetent there\'s no other way they can survive.

3)  Communism is not only feasible, but is inevitable.  I continue to be
amazed that the crypto-fascist slaveholding mentality of the Third
Imperium is so virulently defended by the otherwise stellar thinktank that
is the TML.  Really, it\'s time to close the books on mercantilism in
Traveller.  Private property is yesterday\'s neurosis.  The future lies
with the progressive "races" -- the Zhodani, the Sayat, etc.

I\'m sure there are other threads besides these underway, all of which I
look forward to participating in with all my new-found maturity and peace
of mind that I can muster.

Well, also not trying to start a flamewar, I realize that my former comment may have been oversimplified. What I meant was just that Keynes\' theory has had a huge impact on how governments think about government spending.

I won\'t go into whether Keynes has been discredited or not, just observe that even to this day, many governments use deficit funding just for this purpose - the current Danish one springs to mind (because I\'m a Dane), but most Social Democratic European governments (and there\'s a lot of those around these days) adhere to the principle one way or the other.

But this really has nothing to do with Traveller...

Dr Robert Forward came up with a solution called  the  FAM  drive
(Dr Forward\'s AntiMatter drive).  A small amount of antimatter is
dropped into a large amount  of  normal  matter  fluid.  A  small
amount  of  matter  (equal  to  the  amount  of  antimatter)   is
annihilated and what\'s left is superheated by the reaction.  This
superheated matter expells itself from the ship  in  conventional
thruster fashion.  (At least that\'s how I understood it.)

Trying to keep this somewhat Traveller, let me first state that I\'ve never been good with labels, but there sure is a whole bunch of economic theory (steady state growth), which states that (in theory, at least), it can be beneficial to run with a slight defecit in government spending, because the rate of return of investment will outperform the interest payments (or something like that).

So Aslan females may actually be trying to maneuver their clan in other directions than the males. Who has the most power? Well, first, the females outnumber the males three to one, so there\'s an advantage already. Second, as the Aslan do have a society run (more or less) on economy, fiscal issues may be more crucial to military decisions than the other way around.

I\'m not going to say anything more about current economic theory...There are obviously people on the list far more skilled in that department than me - I haven\'t worked as an economist for four years now (being a developer), so my knowledge is probably a little rusty.

Sorry about the noise...

Hm...you do realize that .01gs is only .025AU from a sun-sized star, and only 10 diameters from an earth-sized planet.  No need to be concerned with \'stellar-sized\' gravity wells either, assuming you can\'t jump into solid objects comets less than several hundred miles across will be impossible targets.

But overall slower merchant traffic, due to needing to transit from extremely near the sun to the target planet.  If you make it any .01G area, it becomes faster than it is now.

It also seriously encourages high-jump ships; you might see the jump-6 merchant for some routes.

Probably becomes the \'low guard\'.

Other points:

At the specified distances, you\'re going to be regularly passing _dangerously_ close to stars.  Ships will need fairly substantial masses of coolant to safely travel that close to a star, and will want to be moving fairly fast.

The decay products of matter/antimatter collisions are frequently neutrally charged, making \'directing\' them a bit of a challenge.

You don\'t need reaction mass; a pure annihilation drive would be using the decay products of matter/antimatter reactions as reaction mass.  This would tend to be extremely low thrust, however (specific impulse around 30 million seconds, power output 300 MW/newton).  Assuming you have a relatively limited supply of antimatter, the best use for it is probably using it as a seed to trigger fusion fuel.

This explains the Slow AM Thermal Drives in GURPS Space 3rd 
Edition.  I was wondering why you needed 2.7 gallons of water per 
3.5E-7 stons of AntiMatter.  You\'re shooting a stream of steam out 
the back-end of your ship! Cool! (or hot ...) You get 16 stons of 
thrust per 500 cf of drive.

The Fast AM Thermal needs 85 gallons (!!!) per 3.4E-8 stons.  
Here, you get 200 stons of thrust per 500 cf of drive.

Thanks for explaining this!  It makes sense now (chuckle).

Shouldn\'t the mass of the ship be factored in there as well?

Very small objects, like missiles lose 

It feels counter-intuitive adding empty space to a ship to increase its hit
points (and indirectly increasing its mass) so that the frame can support it.

So G compensation is the reason big military ships are buildable with Traveller
performance? They would otherwise be unbuildable using this formula.

It works (sometimes) for small, self-sufficient groups (some of the
communes founded in the 60s and 70s are still functioning communist
societies, though of course it\'s a vanishingly small proportion of the
total attempts).  See also the !Kung society, in which clan \'ownership\' of
resources is the norm.  (The stresses which can threaten such a society
were rather nicely portrayed in "The Gods Must Be Crazy.")

I see this discussion as very topical.  Government and economics drive
many Traveller campaigns.  Understanding how they work and interact makes
for better gaming.

It\'s certainly interesting!  But again, I fear that anarchy will be
short-lived in all but the most unusual circumstances (among Solomani-like
humans, at least).  All it takes is one ambitious and well-led group to
turn it into something else.  Even if other groups unite to fight off the
\'spoilers\', by that very uniting they themselves tend to integrate on
other levels.  Anarchy is an unstable system, almost always.

No.  A 10 ton ship under 10 T of thrust and a 1T ship under 10T thrust are under the same stresses.

Nah.  Small objects lose mass faster than they lose hit points.  Actually, large objects lose, it reduces the maximum Gs for large craft.  For a traveller feel, I\'d increase the max to 1.0 tons/hp, blame G-compensation for that.

Yup.  A 10,000 tD 1-G ship is a ridiculous engineering challenge with realistic materials (think of the Missouri flying through the air.  It would break in half).  Bonded SD is 8x stronger than steel, weight for weight, so an 8-G 10,000 tD ship should be a serious challenge for Traveller.  Given the square-cube law, that means a 2G vehicle the size of a Tigress is pretty appalling with a bonded SD structure.

It occurred to me while mulling over the BD crush depth problem that the
Imperial troopers\' armor in the Star Wars movies clearly has a crush
pressure of about 0.8 atm.  That\'s why farm kids and princesses shooting
wildly with hand weapons can routinely take out three or four with each
round.  A big part of Imperial trooper training is learning to avoid at
all costs slapping one another on the back; the stress of such a blow
(even unpowered) is frequently more than sufficient to cause the armor to
implode, leaving the trooper crushed inside a bumpy white ball roughly the
size of a grapefruit.

Well spoken, comrade. :)  On a more serious note...I wonder how the
Imperium would respond to truly mercantilist (as opposed to free-market)
capitalism?  Would an industrial world practicing trade protectionism and
product dumping a la Japan circa 1988 be stopped, and if so, by whom, and
using what official or unofficial techniques?

  Are you using thrusters or a reaction drive?

Very few.  But if the Baron Pacifica also owns Feldercarb Shipyards, which
is Mora\'s largest single cash cow, he might well wield the same level of
real power and influence as the Duchess.

For non-GURPS people, this is a 100ton, J-2 1-G light freighter capable of carrying 2 
passengers and 28 tons of cargo. It has a air/raft bay and escape pod. I can reproduce 
the design in FF&S2 with a few less tons of cargo.

The defence laser is a tiny (50MJ) rainbow (non X-ray) laser designed solely for light 
defence - the campaign I run strictly controls civilian weaponry. The defence laser 
does have a high ROF than a normal laser, though (1/8 rather than 1/60 - and using the 
backup batteries at fulll, it can handle ROF 1 for 1 turn).

	If that wasn\'t bad enough, here in Quebec there are both

	provincials charge 7% on the price PLUS the federal tax.
	Thus, we poor sods pay something like 14.5% sales tax (of

	ObTrav: Just when the PCs think that they\'ve finished with

You really *need* to track down copies of the Skylark Series:

"The Skylark of Space"
"Skylark Three"
"Skylark of Valeron"
"Skylark DuQuesne"

All by E.E. "Doc" Smith.

The escalating power levels are fun. And the series has *the* single
most interesting villian ever concieved. Dr. Marc C. DuQuesne. He\'s
amoral, but charming. He keeps his word, but to the letter. He\'s smart
enough to realize when revenge is a waste of time. And he\'s willing to
work alongside the good guys if there\'s a danger to humanity.

OBTrav:
Since the last we see of him, he and his girl friend are heading off to
find a nice, isolated branch of humaniti to become benevolent despots
of, you could easily justify a pocket (or larger) empire somewhere run
the way DuQuesne was planning to run his. (You\'ll see what I mean after
you\'ve read the books)

It\'d make things interesting for the players.

	Huge change here.  Little fuel to buy, lots of cargo
	space, no problems with unrefined fuel: the rates for
	carrying cargo or passengers would tend to drop.

	Or when searching the gas giant for hidden SDBs.

	No more fuel purification plants required.
	Less reliance on starports for support.
	Damage locations should be altered to take into account
		the reduced size of fuel tanks
	Reduced advantage for SDBs relative to starships
	You can design ships for extremely long range use, so the
		Zhodanis could send an armada deep into Imperial
		space to strike almost anywhere, moving as fast as
		any warnings could.
	No more adventures that start with skimming deep in a gas
		giant.

Oops. I did realize that at one point in my life ...

Okay, let\'s bump it up to 0.001 or 0.0001 gs or some such.

What I am attempting to handwave here is this: To propigate out of jump
space, you need a gravity well. However, there is some margin of error to
any jump, due to some sort of uncertainty effect of hyperspace. At parsec
and multi-parsec distances you can only expect to come with in your
destination point +/- millions and millions of kilometers. Anything smaller
than a a great, big gravity well and you might miss (and end up in
jumpspace forever-ever-ever ... mwah-hahahaaa! ;-).

It\'s an attempt to make it so that: a) shipping has to jump to a gravity
well and b) said gravity well can\'t just be some small artificial gravity
source that can be convienently placed by the Imperium.

[snip stuff]

I don\'t have too much a problem with this -- it\'s going to be a space opera
setting. I think I\'m going to make the jump drives more volume-intensive,
though, and this will offset it somewhat.

I assume increasing the gs required for propagation from jumpspace will
increase the distances involved?

Thanks for the comments!

Product dumping is not a victimless crime.

I refer you to Book 4: \'Mercenary\' for the most likely answer.

In an attempt to stop this thread, I\'ll throw this in: Living in Denmark and earning a wage a good mark above average, I pay:

First, 9% of ALL my income
Then, approximately 55% on what\'s left
Then, the general sales tax is 25% on ALL goods, except those that are taxed even heavier (everything which is fun).
And the cars are taxed 200% (not a typing error)

So there! :-/

(okay, so the hospitals are free, the schools and universities are free, etc. And no, Denmark is not a communist state - it\'s just the way it is)

Since your drives work inside a gravity well, why have starships at all?
Why not build jump drives in army bases, subway stations, mines, hotels,
embassies, or whatever and jump people and cargo directly to their final
destination?

After reading a post by Joseph Dietrich about his Acanonical
Jump Drive Traveller Universe (AJDTU), I was thinking of
the influences such a system has had on TV and how useful it
might be to detail such an Alternate Traveller Universe (ATU),
for those who cared.

Consider a TU that\'s more like Babylon 5.  Introduce jump
gates/jump chargers and WHAMO!  You\'ve got B5, and just
took a long step to assimilating the B5 RPG group.

Place your timeline sometime during the early Nth Interstellar
Wars, and you almost HAVE the B5 timeline, for free.

Some (cool) drawbacks to jumpgates might be:

1) They operate based on gravitic principles, and thus must be in
a specific gravity well to work at all.  Thus your gate placement
will be dictated by planetary alignments, or just orbital distance
from the primary.

2) They\'re expensive and inefficient.  If you can buy/sell cheap
jump drives you\'re better off -- you can push maintenance onto
the starship operator instead of the owning government.  Though
you lose a military chokepoint (not really if real jumpdrives can
exist), you also free up resources you\'d otherwise have idle at
the gate.

How expensive?  Make \'em real expensive, like the cost of an
orbital class A starport or a global powerplant or a Naval fleet.
And then there\'s the yearly maintenance, at 1% of its cost...
ouch!

Who could afford these beasties?  Significant worlds with
high-quality starports.

Joseph, this probably isn\'t what you had in mind.  I was
thinking more along the lines of syncretism where you were
thinking a true Alternate TU.  Well, anyone can scale
accordingly.

I don\'t like it, but possibly. I am having a hard time thinking of a
handwave to prevent this. I would like them to have to spend some time in
realspace between jumps -- but I suppose you could make a ship with a power
plant so big that you could fill the capacitors in a second anyway sooo...

Hmm. Perhaps each jump requires astrogation observations and calculations
that can take up to a couple of hours to perform.


>How long can they be charged?

As long as they can be in Traveller. ;-) I know that\'s a non-answer, but
I\'m not sure that there is a time limit in the normal rules (here I\'m
talking High guard and MT).


>Does holding a charge for long times cause damage?

If it does in Traveller. ;-) See above answer.

Then you\'ll have to hoof it in realspace. :-)

I mentioned this in another letter. My idea is that you need a big gravity
well to propagate into. Because of an "uncertainty principle" inherent in
hyperspace travel, this well needs to be millions and millions of km in
size, otherwise you might miss (and never come back from jumpspace).

Yes. This is okay, though. I want space travel to be cheaper, and shipments
like raw ore or grain to make more sense.

No reason to go to a gas giant anyway -- I follow the "gas giants are

Now we\'re getting awfully close to the Banks\' Culture universe we were
talking about the other day (which doesn\'t feel at ALL like Traveller and
isn\'t, in my NAAHO, space opera, even though I like it.)

I\'ve not quite forgiven Banks for destroying Nagoya though... it\'s itoshii
Hiroshi-chama\'s home town.  (Though at times he speaks as though he\'d like
to blast it, the family shrine and all need to stay standing.)

This is the biggie, unless you make the drive _really_ big.

Military ships will still probably want to be albe to do wilderness
refueling, but they probably will fuse the hydrogen as the collect
it and just store the energy.

The same reason you can\'t put a jump drive on less than a 100 dt ship, of
course! :-)

I\'m not proposing jumping out of a gravity well any more than a normal
Traveller ship does. And actually, I wasn\'t trying to suggest jumping
*into* a gravity well any more than a normal Traveller ship does (I just
had my numbers wrong).

Preferably, what I am trying to do is come up with a FTL scenario similar,
but not exactly like, the normal Traveller model.

Here are the rules I am using to develop the concept.

* No lhyd required for jumps.
* Jumps should take a week +/- several hours.
* There should be a (significant) minimum size on starships.
* There should jump routes and choke points.
* There should be no jumping to truly empty hexes
  (a little wiggle room here for brown dwarfs).
* Jump destinations should be relatively close
  to a star or other hugely massive object. No
  jumping from system to system via the Oort clouds
  or outer planets.
* There should be some required time in realspace between jumps.
  Up to several hours.
* Ideally, one shouldn\'t get to jump from 100 diameters
  to 100 diameters of each world. Instead, one jumps
  from 100 diameters to x distance from the destination star.
* And now that it\'s been mentioned -- space travel should be cheaper.

I don\'t like:

* Fixed transfer points (as in _A Mote in God\'s Eye_
  or _Startide Rising_).
* "The fabric of spacetime needs a rest" excuse to
  make a ship stay in realspace.

I don\'t mind huge jumpgates that cost billions to maintain (in fact I am
planning on using them -- it\'s a Fading Suns influence). But they should be
out of the Imperium\'s capability to build (TL 18+ Ancient artifacts).

Quite! SOC is the measure of ones power and influence in *Society at large*,
not necessarily ones skill in *Socialising*.

After all, a middle manager at SuSAG wields considerable power (especially
if he\'s in charge of some secret R&D Project), but probably doesn\'t get out
much.

During the last thruster thread, it was stated that we have missiles now capable
of doing 100G for a very short burst.

If I use the 0.1 stons/HP rule then I can only make 120G missiles at TL13. I
could easily make 200G+ GTL13 missiles otherwise.

Yes, 1G for a 10,000 DT cargo ship with minimum armour (DR100) is just above the
0.1 tons/hp limit.

Actually not that big for an armoured ship. The 400DT SDB in the GT book would
be unbuildable without Extra Heavy Frame strength. Anything bigger than that or
with more armour would be undoable.

So a sensible safety rule would be to not let anything bigger than its thrust/hp
rating enter atmosphere.

In space though it should be easier to build bigger, providing a turn is nice
and slow. Thinking supertanker.

Using fully vectored thrust for large craft is pointless too. 
Goodbye GT thrusters ;-)

If by that you mean precipitated out at the 0.01G limit and can jump from the
0.01G limit, then note that this is less than 4 diameters out for Earth. Gravity
halves with every planetary radius step you take. This vastly speeds up transit
times and makes planetary defence even harder. 

You want 0.00001 G to approximate 100D for planets, and 0.001 G to approximate
100D for the sun. Note Earth is only just over 100D from the sun.

0.01G is about 25D from the sun (in any direction).

0.001G from Earth is about 15 diameters (half the distance to the moon).

For commercial craft this is not an issue. Unloading/Loading times for cargo and
passengers have always exceeded fueling rate. Though of course now there is no
charge for fuel. 

X-boat routes are faster.

For military craft, this is Nirvana. There is much less difference between an
SDB and a starship. Ships are both more agile, and more heavily armoured.

You need to halve all the shipping rates to make the economics work as per
traveller (assuming no fuel charges and all the jump fuel space is usable for
cargo). Probably simplest.

>5.) No High Guard -- except in describing ortillery for planetary assault.

and that threat is much worse with ships jumping in at 4 diameters.

>What else. Poke holes in this idea please.

If you use jump masking, the incoming jump point will mask the outgoing jump
point half the time.

Gas Giants have less strategic advantage. Though their moons are still good
outposts and atmospheres are still good hiding places. 

All planets, most moons and large asteroids are potential jump points and need
watching and guarding, and as this is practical, may be attempted. The 0.01G
(25D ish) radius round the star is still an awful lot of space to watch though.

Fleet tactics change beyond recognition, logistics are so much easier. No battle
tenders. No oilers.

Making high risk jumps close to small masses becomes a standard military tactic.

You can\'t make your PCs visit a planet to refuel, when this is required for plot
purposes. They just jump to a random jump point around the star, look around,
move a bit, and jump out again.

A ship can nearly always jump away. You can\'t make your players stay in system.

Nearly all the scenarios out there will need significant work to fit into your
campaign. Deckplans, pictures, descriptions, logistics, will all need changing
or justifying. The same is true if you use Star Trek, B5 or Star Wars modules,
though in the opposite direction.

Well, if you include DGP\'s Starship Operators Manual as MT, then you can
only hold the charge for a few tens of minutes, and HG requires 2 turns

If you can Jump to a Terrestrial Planet, it must be easier to \'hit\' a Gas
Giant.

Unless by outsystem you mean the region of space beyond the planetary
system, but still within the \'boundaries\' of the stars influence?

To visit or establish colonies / mining outposts / observatories / etc etc

defending, which means military bases, which give GG\'s a tactical

For cold worlds, or even cold areas on worlds, you can always swipe the
native name for an area in Siberia. I don\'t remember the original, but
it translates as "Land where the piss freezes from the ground up".

Now *that* is an image to to make your players appreciate "cold"!

Nope. You see, many, if not *most* of use qualify as fen (members of SF
fandom). And there\'s an old (and all too accurate) saying that goes
something like this:

One fan is a fount of trivia
two fen are an amazing assembly of arcane knowledge
three fen are an encyclopedia of the strange and bizarre
four fen are the sum toal of all knowledge

We have more than four fen on the list.

In all seriousness, fen *do* tend to not only pick up trivia, but to
*know* people who are experts in odd fields. Add that the the "5
degrees of seperation" theory (that there are no more than 5 links
between any two people in the US) and you can see that when it comes to
scientific or technical knowledge, fen either know it, or can obtain it
quickly. 

For example, I\'m but one of the folks here who could dig up rail gun,
laser launch and other "alternative space launch" tech quickly if we
*really* needed it. I *know* the inventor of the "Launch loop" (Keith
Lofstrom), I know well enough to email Jordin Kare (Lawrence Berkley
Labs, laser launch, rail gun work, many other oddities). And UI know of
people who work at various NASA facilities who might answer email on
other topics. And that\'s just going out to "second" degree!)

I\'m sure other folks here have similar "contacts".

Hit a bookstore and buy a copy of Dr. Robert L. Forward\'s book
"Indistinguishable From Magic". It\'s got a chapter on anti-matter. 

In essence, the problem is that anti-protons and anti-neutrons *aren\'t*
elementary particles. So they *don\'t* convert directly to energy. The
both consist of quark triplets (one each red, green and blue for normal
matter, anti-red, anti-green and anti-blue for anti-matter). So when
they interact, you lose one quark from each pair (say a red & an
anti-red). These convert to energy, and the remain quarks rearrange
into a pair of mesons. Mesons consist of *pairs* of quarks (in this
case a blue/anti-blue pair and a green/anti-green par). These quickly
decay by self-anihilation (the two quarks react with each other).

The firs consideration from this is that the initial annihilation
produces very high energy gamma rays. You need to have some *dense*
material to absorb these and convert them to heat. Forward suggests a
tungsten block.

Next, you have the initial mesons decaying (apparently they decay in
two stages, rather than the simplified single stage I gave above). The
first decay occurs a few meters from the original reaction. Still, it\'s
impractical to use a block of tungsten that big. So you have to extract
energy from them by making them interact with a strong magnetic field
(which acts as a "nozzle" to direct them in one direction, making the
ship go in the opposite direction). Next, the mesons resulting from
stage 2 will be going so fast that they\'ll get a couple of Km before
decaying! So you need a *big* magnetic nozzle to extract all the energy
you can before they decay.

There\'s a diagram of all this in the book. 

Forward points out that there are likely many other ways of harnessing
the energy for propulsion. Nor for the interesting part. *Because* so
much energy is realeased, and antimatter is likely to *always* be very
expensive in relation to normal matter, you\'ll want to use as little
antimatter as possible. 

So you use it to heat up normal matter, which you spew out thru a
nozzle to propel you. 

It turns out that for anything up to an interstellar flight, the best
designs involving antimatter have one quarter of the ships\'s mass being
"fuel" (antimatter and reaction mass). Or do I have that backwards?

Anyway whatever the "magic" mass-ratio is, it *is* the same for a wide
range of total mission velocity changes (ie mission delta-V). The more
dV you need, the more of the "fuel" is antimatter. For putting around
insystem, you can get by with a lot of reaction mass and a little
antimatter. The antimatter only heats up the fuel a bit before spitting
it out at a relatively low velocity. For higher dV, you use more
antimatter, and thus get a higher exhaust velocity. All the way up to
the maximum possible, which is suitable for interstellar missions at
fraction of lightspeed.

sooo...

How about the stutterwarp solution from 2300AD? Travel through jump space
accumulates a charge (type undetermined) that requires time in a gravity
well to dissipate.  That means ships have to hang around in real space for
however long it takes to dissipate the charge.  How long this takes is
totally up to you, although I would make it proportional to the strength of
the local grav field, so diving a gas giant can help dissipate the field
faster.

Power output is the energy output of the drive.  A reasonable antimatter annihilation drive is probably on the order of 1 newton of thrust per ton of drive (capable of 1/10,000th G) so yes, it\'s \'low thrust\'

Use the antimatter as a conveniently compact way to heat fusion fuel to a temperature sufficient to get fusion.  Basically you are replacing the fission bomb in an H-bomb with antimatter, and then shrinking the bomb dramatically, and treating the whole thing as a Daedalus drive.

Um.. get your physics right.  Gravity is divided by the square of the distance, .01 Gs is at 10 diameters from a planet with a 1G surface gravity.

So they do. The problem is that it is so much more efficient to conquer a
neighbor, take over his land and resettle your _ihatei_ on it. Instead of
getting rid of a fleetload every 3 year, you get rid of a fleetload every
month. Furthermore, once your no-longer-ihatei-but-vassals have settled
down, their taxes can be used to build and maintain some warships. Being
stationed only a jump or two away from your own planet, they can be
summoned to help you if you are attacked. If your _ihatei_ are 18 months
away, it doesn\'t matter how succesful they are, their ships can\'t support
you.

>That would create an equilibrium - maybe not a very stable one, though :-)

Exactly my point. And all it takes is a few clan lords with a flexible
attitude to the conventions. And canon gives plenty of examples of Aslans
with flexible attitudes. It even states that there are some Aslans who are
able to rationalize piracy as honorable (not many, but some). We\'re also
told that there are always a couple of clan wars going on somewhere in
the Hierate.

IIRC (and I don\'t have my MT stuff here, so I may be mistaken), the Aslans
regarded the Domain as being covered until the Rebellion. When they 
realized that the Domain was vulnerable (I know that _I_ claim that the
Domain wouldn\'t be vulnerable, but canon says it was), some of them began
to argue that the Domain wasn\'t _really_ covered. They may keep their word,
but sometimes their word is open to interpretation.

Damn... I wish I had remembered that back when _GT:Alien Races 1_ was being
playtested. If I\'m right, the various Aslan incursions in _BtC_ and _AR1_
are completely contrary to canon... I\'ll have to check when I get home.

The price an Aslan clan lord pays for taking still servicable ships from
their regular duties and giving them to his _ihatei_ is that he will have
to build new ships to perform those duties more often. Thereby the effective
cost of his ships is increased. Not because he pays more for them, but
because he pays them over a shorter period of time.

>Second, the Aslans are about 30 parsecs from the Imperium and the Solomani

Actually, the Aslans shares a border with the Solomani Confederation at
their nearest point: in Magyar and Canopus.

Presumably that buffer zone originally continued down through Magyar and
Canopus, but once the Confederation seceded from the Imperium, they moved
into it.

This made me think of some experimentation I\'ve been doing with the new
GURRPS Space 3rd Edition).  I wanted a different feel from classic
Traveler, but I wanted to be able to recycle as many deckplans as possible
(so I\'m lazy that way :-).  Here\'s what I have come up with:

A tramline type jump drive (similar to the Alderson drive in Pournelle\'s
CoDominium universe, with an admixture of David Weber\'s Honorverse).  This
uses no fuel but requires lots of energy stored in a an energy bank of some
sort.  Each jumpline has a transit limit that governs how much you can
throw through it.  (Jump gates may be possible, but very expensive and
suitable only for major trade routes)

A total conversion maneuver drive.  This requires fuel, but not realistic
amounts so ships can pull multiple Gs and still have enough fuel for
hundreds of hours of burn.  (Think Heplar, but worse :-)

Military vessels probably end up being similar to those in Traveller (lots
of fuel tankage), but merchants should carry much less fuel. 

What I haven\'t settled yet is how far ships will have to go to get to the
jump point.  

Any thoughts?

If the Moot works the same way the British House of Lords works (worked? ;-),
then that is the definition of a peer: Someone who has a seat in the Moot.

Or maybe fringe nobles take turns staying at Capital and voting each other\'s
proxies.

But then he wouldn\'t be a peer and would not be eligble for high office.

IMTU I have the Imperial Office of Arms. This is ostensibly an Imperial
department for the registration of heraldic coats of arms and equivalent
devices, but in reality their most important function is to evaluate local
titles, offices, and positions and translate them into equivalent Imperial
social positions. On the recommendation of the IOA the holder of a given
title, office, or position automatically recieves a knighthood in an
appropiate Imperial order. This just as automatically gives him or her a
fitting position in Imperial society.

It\'s still on the wish list and the capsule description is still missing.
I\'ve been thinking about putting in a bid for it, but at the moment I\'m
concentrating on PYRAMID submissions and playtests. Odds are that I wont
get around to it in time (But I\'ve decided that starting tomorrow I\'m
going to stop procrastinating, so who knows? ;-).

Well, if the writeup of Forboldn that I\'ve submitted to PYRAMID is accepted,
there will be a canonical example of a director of an Imperial subsector
level official (the Director of the Duchy of Regina branch of the Colonial
Office) who is only a knight or a baronet (Sir Louis Farlane).

So it would seem.  I would question, however, whether the term

a non-WOD mailing list such as this.  Seems to have worked, IMHO....

This makes sense because of the detail involved, makes it much more of a
tribute because it has that "3rd dimension" of background as opposed to a
set of stats and a short slapshot of text.  I must admit, that my former
Traveller group would know right away what I was talking about if I
mentioned an AHL, but would probably scratch their heads in wonderment at
what a Tigress was.  The lad that currently has my Traveller gear (who is
into the "big is better" or the "more fire power the better" and other
number crunching, maximising schools of thinking) asked me what a Tigress
was and he is still playing CT, but he sure knows and loves the old AHL.

However, I also like the idea of a system coming of age with the naming of a
world in Andrew\'s honour by removing it\'s former survey numbers.  And I
don\'t see why both can\'t happen with the Emperor awarding these in tribute
and honour of someone the Emperor thought of as a close friend who had
worked ceaselessly for the good of the Imperium unto his recent death.  The
Emperor is said to be deeply affected by the loss of such an esteemed
Citizen of the Imperium.

Antihydrogen is the most likely form of antimatter to be used in this
application.

Anthony Jackson has described the two basic concepts :-
1. Annihilation drive, where antimatter is combined with an equal amount
of matter to produce a stream of pions, muons, gamma photons, and
neutrinos.
	The problem with this drive type is the low thrust - it\'s really a form
of photon rocket (as Anthony has also pointed out).
	Proposed focussing strategies involve magnetic nozzles with
field strengths in the fusion reactor range.

2. \'Dilution drive\' : where small amounts of antimatter are combined
with matter to produce thrust.
	Peter Trevor has mentioned the excellent stories and articles by Rob
Forward which deal with near-tech AM rockets.
	In one proposed design, the particles produced by annihilation are
generally used to heat a block of tungsten or some similar metal, which
heats the fuel stream (hydrogen). This is similar to the solid core
fission rocket.
	Similarly, a gaseous or liquid core concept could be adapted to
antimatter annihilation.
	Yet another option is to magnetically confine a fusion plasma.

	Some points to consider :-
- - Propellant mass can be as little as four times rockets dry mass
(compared with ~100X for chemical rockets);
- - Sample fuels : 3mg AM to 1400g prop (Isp of 8783) - up to 3g/1400g
(Isp 278K) for maximal acceleration, assuming 1% of annihilation energy
is used to heat and eject fuel.
	Isp refers to specific impulse - the thrust per unit weight flow rate
of propellant ; the best chemical rockets have an Isp of 400-450
seconds. (The values given above are for the fuels themselves ; proposed
near-tech AM fusion rockets have an Isp of 5000-15000 seconds).
	Isp increases with the square root of the proportion of annihilation
energy used to heat and eject fuel - so if 100% of the annihilation
energy was used, Isp would be increased by a factor of 10.

You may be able to get a pdf copy of NASA Technical Memo #107030 from
the NASA website. This is a little equation heavy, but is chock full of
useful data about fission, fusion and antimatter drives.

Book 4 states "Players cannot teach the instructional skill to other

Two words: "Rura Penthe". 

For those few of you who don\'t recognize the reference, it\'s the
Klingon prison planet to which Kirk and McCoy were sent in Star Trek
VI. It also bears a surprising resemblance to the weather here in
Edmonton in the middle of the winter -- we usually get a short stretch
of weather where the overnight low hits or passes -40.

I don\'t know about that.  It\'s convinced me that I don\'t want to even look
at Hunter: the whatever, even though it was the one WW concept that seemed
vaguely interesting to me.  Seems like their stunt backfired.

Why?  The info from what I\'ve read by folks like Robert Forward suggest
you\'d be doing a whole lot better than that with antimatter, or even
fusion for that matter. 

Heck, a drive using 1 part antimatter and 50 parts hydrogen will net you a
specific impulse around 10 times that of the best fusion rocket, and all
you\'re doing is heating reaction mass and shooting out the back.  If we
have the degree of control of magnetic fields necessary to control and
contain large quantities of anitmatter, then we could use these same
magnets to protect the nozzles and reaction chamber.  Sounds like a whole
lot better than 1 newton/ton to me.

Yes, I was aware of the x10 rule - but in the example descriptions in the

vacuum ranges. So I listed the base ranges.

Its a normal turret, not a pop turret - and yes, I added the rotation

Hmmmm...easy to change...

Nope. This is a merchant ship, not an assault craft or rescue vehicle. I
figure that anything it\'s going to dock with (starports, customs vessels,
rescue craft, and even pirates) will have the tube - so I saved space and
money. But it would be easy to add - since I\'ve got the empty space.

Common areas. Galleys. Hallways. The cabin volume seemed insufficient to

Rule one for surviving a science argument with your ego intact:  Don\'t
make a direct accusation of error unless you are very very sure of
yourself.  Rule two:  Don\'t, even then. 

The 1 G distance is 1 *radius*, or half a diameter (that is, on the
surface). Thus the .01 G distance is at 10 radii from the center of earth,
or 9 radii from the surface, meaning 5 or 4.5 diameters out depending on
how you measure \'out\'.  This is still a bit higher than John\'s figure --
which leaves me wondering if *I* have blown this, somehow -- but it\'s
closer to his than to yours. :)

The specific impulse (Isp) is determined *strictly* by the exhaust
velocity ve).

Ve/(9.8 m/s^2)=Isp

*Thrust* is determined by the *rate* at which you use fuel, and by the
Isp or Ve.

So even with a near C exhaust velocity, the *thrust* depends on *how
much* exhaust per second you produce. Note that producing an exhaust of
"luxons" (particles that always travel at c, such as photons) is only
half as efficient as producing "normal" particles particles. 

One way of looking at this is that in a "normal rocket" most of the
particles bounce off the nozzle before being re-directed out the
nozzle. This gives *twice* the impulse per particle as having them
merely stream out the back of the vessel.

Compare the impulse you get by throwing a ball off the end of the
typical physics experiment "frictionless sled" with what you get from
having the same ball at the same speed *relative to the sled* approach
the sled and bounce off the back.

A photon drive where an *external* source of photons is bounced off a
mirror at the back of the ship gets double the impulse. At least until
the velocity gets high enough that the beam is badly red-shifted.

Which is *very* anti-reality. In the real worl, missiles have been
built with accelerations in the 100 to *1000* g range. Building larger
vehicles with such accerelation rapidly becomes difficult if not
impossible.

The square-cube law makes large *anything* difficult (and makes really,
really *small* stuff difficult as well). 

For example, if you keep the same proportions, double the size and the
all areas is squared (4 times as much), but all volumes is cubed (8
times as big).

Structural strength depends on cross-sectional area. Stresses depend on
*mass* which is a *volume* dependent function. Thus, twice as large has
4 times the strength trying to deal with 8 times the stress. And thus
it\'s only *half* as strong. 

This means the structural supports need to be twice as thick. Of
course, this adds even *more* mass, so you have to go *beyond* twice as
thick to get the same structural strength.

And you quickly hit a point where even if you make the object *solid*
it won\'t be proportionally as strong. So you have to switch to
materials that are proportionally stronger. 

And at some point, you run out of stronger materials. If nothing else,
molecular and even atomic bonds only get so strong. Thus there is an
ultimate limit to size.

But you *should* be able to jump to a *specific* point at x distance
from the destination star (give or take some error factor). Otherwise
commerce becomes a real pain.

Also, you need to consider how efficient (or not) realspace drives are.
If they are efficient enough that the inability to "microjump" insystem
doesn\'t affect transit times much, you need to deal with the "near c
rock" scenario. If they are less efficient, then ships either is
*really* low thrust drives at "constant thrust" for interplanetary
trips, or they use high thrust drives briefly at each end and coast in
between. Either way, the trips take weeks to years. 

And yes, you could jump outsystem, then jump back. But that *really*
messes up insystem commerce and in-system defence.

In Traveller, there would already have been a mass revolt when the
government started asking people to give up their guns in response to
the mass murder in Tasmania.  The PCs would have been involved in
finding (or, if necessary, creating) evidence that it was actually a
conspiracy to get the population to disarm itself to pave the way for a
coup or off-world takeover.

Kinda reminds me of Centennial, Wyoming.  We had a couple inches of snow one sunny July afternoon (it\'s way the hell back up in the mountains), and a tourist screwed up and asked one of my uncles when summer was.

My uncle, being the smartass he was, said, "Summer?  Summer?  Oh, *SUMMER*.  That\'s the day we play softball!"

Actually, this doesn\'t make any more sense in the real world: the
cost to ship those items is literally more than they cost themselves. So
why do they keep moving?

Jim Maclean probably knew all this when we were writing Far Trader, but I
just recently found an explanation that made sense to me in a book on the
economics of shipping. There are two parts:

(1) What are the good worth at their destination? If the cost of the goods
at the source plus the cost of transportation is less than this, you can
always ship at a profit even if transporation costs are something like 95%
of the total. This works particularly well from low-TL to high-TL worlds,
because the higher standard of living drives the cost of even basic raw
materials up (how much do you have to pay miners or lumberjacks, just so
they can make a living?).

(2) There is a conspiracy on the part of shippers. No, really. Shipping
conferences are organizations of shippers working on a particular route,
designed to head off lethal rate wars by setting standardized rates that
everyone can live with. These conferences also realize that low-value
goods still need to move, so they deliberately set the rates for
high-value goods too high and use the difference to subsidize low-value
goods. Jim explicitly assumes that something similar operates in
Traveller.

Nope. For one thing, the conversion factor from m^2 to cm^2 is 10,000,
not 100.

From the CRC Handbook 79th ed., Conversion factors.

from			to		multiply by
- ----	----	----
atmosphere (standard)	pascal (Pa)	1.013 250*E+05
atmosphere (technical
	= 1 kgf/cm^2)	pascal (Pa)	9.806 650*E+04
bar			pascal (Pa)	1.000 000*E+05
kilogram-force (kgf)	newton (N)	9.806 650*E+00
kgf/cm^2		pascal (Pa)	9.806 650*E+04
kgf/m^2			pascal (Pa)	9.806 650*E+00

* = conversion factor is exact

So:

pressure	std. atm.	bar		Pa.		kgf/m^2
- ----	----	----	----	----
standard atm.	1.000000	1.013250	1.013250e5	1.033227e5
1 bar		0.986923	1.000000	1.000000e5	1.019716e5
technical atm.	0.967841	0.980665	0.980665e5	1.000000e5

I expect that the imperial "standard atmosphere" will be 1 bar. But the
shortcut "technical atmosphere" will still be useful for "back of the
envelope" calculations.

Simple enough answer to both. They (or the way they store energy)
involves doing odd things to the structure of spacetime. Thus, charging
them inside a jump bubble is *assumed* to destroy ships because no ship
that has ever planned to try it has ever been heard of again. Except
for a couple that had equipment failures before they could start the
recharge. 

Thus, the merest *hint* that you plan on doing this is a good way to
induce a mutiny. 

On second thought, to prevent a "bomb" consisting of a portable power
plant and a jump capacitor, hidden in a cargo container along with a
timer, let\'s say that *nasty* but non-fatal things start happening. And
you\'ve got say, 30-90 minutes to find and (carefully) discharge such a
gizmo. 

This has the added bonus of letting you declare that you can\'t get
closer than 5-10 diameters with charged capacitors. This *does*
eliminate the "kill yourself by jumping from the surface" bit, but it
prevents landing with charged capacitors.

Well, we already have evidence that taking longer improves accuracy
(the "co-ordinated jump" rule that allows fleets to emerge without
being scattered over days.

Also, consider that normally when you jump out you\'ve got *hours* to
*days* of data regarding where you are jumping *from*.

Yeah, check out some of Heinlein\'s juveniles. The ones that have "torch
ships", which are what Heinlein called a total conversion drive. 

Off the top of my head, "Farmer in the Sky", "Time for the Stars". 

I think "Farmer in the Sky" has the best bit. The ship is hauling
families to a colony on Ganymede. There was a tour for the kids to the
various areas of the ship. One kid wanted to see the drive and was told
that it was sealed off, no way to get to it in flight, and only robots
worked on it in port. The kid asked what would happen if something went
wrong. The guide *firmly* insisted that nothing *could* go wrong and
then dragged them off to something else. Our hero was another kid in
the group and asks his dad about it at dinner. His dad says that it
*is* pretty foolproof. Kid asks what if somethings goes wrong. Dad
replies that the chief engineer would have to go EVA (that\'s what was
implied, the term didn\'t exist at the time) and fix it. Kid goes "And?"
Father replies "And once the drive restarts, the deputy chief engineer
becomes the chief engineer". Kid is silent for a moment and then goes
"Oh!" as it dawns on him what dad has *really* said. 

I think that\'s a rather nice touch for a drive that powerful and
reliable. And it explains why *nobody* launches without an Engineer.

You missed the key item - "annihilation". 

He\'s talking about a drive where you react matter with an *equal*
amount of antimatter and use the resulting *photons* as your exhaust.

    'body' => 'HOBBY & TRIVIA SKILLS

Tired of drab colourless PC & NPCs? Are they simply looking like a
collection of UPP\'s and same\'o same\'o skills?

Then spice them on up with hobby or trivia skills. Skills that ordinarily
don\'t have a place in a game and have no real influence on almost any task,
but nonetheless could or can be used at some point. Chess, fishing,
knowledge of Horror TriD or Contemporary Romance Fiction could all be yours
. . . .

Give the NPC or PC a number of hobby/trivia skill levels equal to his/her
Education and let them go nuts. If ever called onto to perform a
hobby/trivia task, roll Vs an appropriate stat+skill level (if unskilled
subtract 3) e.g. ice skating or wood-carving then use Dex, recalling a
specific sport statistic then use Educ.

If a Hobby/trivia skill could influence a normal task resolution then add
Hobby or Trivia skill/2 (round up) as a DM if the GM feels it is warranted.

e.g. Eric\'s character is trying to shoot a rather nasty very large sea
creature which has suddenly lurched out of the water. Wanting to aim for the
right spot with Mr. Shottie, he asks if his Hobby skill of Fishing could be
applicable as a DM. The GM\'s been drinking, god Terry just wouldn\'t shut up
about Tactics pools and it being 1 a.m., he\'s wondering why the hell he
isn\'t at home in bed with his lovely wife.

\'Sure Eric, what the hell, go for it\'.

See, that could be you.

As close as you like.While close firing might do minor damage, knock off a
few exposed sensors and the like, or cause debris to impact the ship, no
major structural damge would result.

 If you want something to happen, have a nearby hit blast debris into an
open airlock, making it impossible to close without negineering
intervention, . No major damage, but worrying to players wanting to get into
orbit before the nukes go off.

Don\'t even bother. An anti-ship laser could cause major problems for people
who are _missed_ by it, anyone who is hit is toast, as in any vehicle
smaller than a grav tank. And the tanjk will only survive by luck.

Very definitely not. Lasers spread as range increases, not the reverse.

Yes. If you do it too much the planet acts as it\'s own "sandcaster" i.e, the
debris prevents the laser from hitting it\'s target. This in turn may have an
effect on the ships sensiong ability and it\'s ability to operate in
atmosphere, though probably not much.

Air turbulence around the site and the beams would be noticeable to say the
least.

It\'s remotely possible that some other consequence, such as hitting a
natural gas pocket could cause the planet to "fire back" but that\'s only
really relevant if the ship is grounded or low-flying.

Prolonged intensive bombardment of a single site could possibly cause
seismic activity

Following on from a previous reply ...

In High Passage no. 5 Marc Miller himself wrote:

    "... it is important to remember just  what  purpose  the
    government factor is ment  to  serve.  Traveller  players
    and characters are rarely involved  with  governments  on
    the international and interplanetary level.  That  is  to
    say, they do not deal with kings or presidents  or  heads
    of state; they deal  with  individual  members  of  broad
    government mechanisms, they deal with office holders  and
    employees whose attitudes and actions are shaped  by  the
    type of government they serve."

    "For this reason, among others, labels such  as  monarchy
    have  been   elimiated.   Calling   a   government   type
    "monarchy" would conjure up images  of  a  king  and  his
    retinue, but still leaves a lot of information unrelated."

He then gave examples, including:

0.  No government structure
    Examples: The early American West, Indian tribes, or frontier
    situations.
.
.
.

10. Charismatic Dictatorship
    Examples: China under Mao, the USSR under Lenin, the US (to
    some extent) under FDR.

11. Non-Charismatic Leader
    Examples: China after Mao, the USSR after Stalin.

12. Charismatic Oligarchy
    Examples: The Communist Party in the USSR, the Democratic
    Party in Chicago.

As for nationalisation within the 3I  an  example  was  given  in
Amber Zone: Thunder on Zyra (JTAS-11) ... a merc ticket from  the
planetary government of Zyra (Trin\'s Veil) to help it nationalise
the local assets of an offworld corporation!

,,, but somewhat ironically given that it was me who asked, I may be able
to help you there.  Isn\'t the former beasty a kind of lizard - at least a
reptile - and the latter...

Hmmm, that wouldn\'t be the gorgeous glowworm creature I saw at Waitomo
would it?  IIRC it had a life cycle of something like:  (Note the highly
scientific description!)

A period as a larva/egg or something
a period of hanging from the cave roof with threads dangling down to catch
something or other
short period of being a fly to reproduce (IIRC with no mouth so it dies of
hunger)

In short:
A few months of sleeping
A month of fishing
Three days of sex.

The guide thought this sounded like a good lifestyle really.



The above comes from decade old memories of a few months in New Zealand
being captivated by the exotic creatures you have over there.  [And the
non-human population was pretty cute too!  :-) ]

OB Trav:

(must be millions as usual but some that spring to mind):

PCs sent to collect such an odd life form - but the caves are really deep
and dangerous
PCs have a romantic encounter in the dark of the caves [1]
PCs on a quest to find some really obscure creature no one\'s ever heard of
PCs find that protected creatures in once place are being hunted in another

Snicker. July is the one month on the calendar that Edmonton has never seen
snow... this year, we had our first snowfall on September 30. (A little
earlier than usual, and it melted by the next day...)

unrealistically low population, one explanation for the "discrepancy"

	IMTU, ships come out of jump with considerable error
	(anywhere from a few km to millions of km, depending
	on pilot and navigation skills).  A ship\'s exact location
	is very important to jump accurately (being off 100,000 km
	at the start of a jump could result in errors of several
	AU at the end).  Thus, IMTU, starships generally stay in
	normal space for at least long enough to navigate.

Now you come to mention it...I have this vague recollection of doing a
sculpture of a lizard in a school art class, far too many years ago.
I\'m sure it was pictures of a tuatara I used as a model.

Then again, the art teacher thought it was some sort of iguana and
mum always described the result as a frog, although that probably
reflects more on my sculpting than the appearance of a tuatara.

The big problem with an antimatter drive is fuel storage (its kinda hard to store antimatter) and heat dissipation (high-ISP drives produce _lots_ of power.  1 newton/ton means energy output of 300 MW/ton, which means you probably need to eliminate 100 MW/ton of heat.  This is nontrivial).  A 50:1 drive might produce less heat and would produce about 10x as much thrust given the same amount of antimatter (with 1/5 the specific impulse).

Heh.  You\'re right, I also made an error, the correct distances is 5 diameters from the planetary core.  However, the claim of \'halving with every planetary radius step you take\' is flatly wrong.

Well, he was wrong in his interpretation of what I said.  The frame weight rules for Vehicles are flat broken (I\'d replace \'surface area\' with \'volume\' in the weight computation), but limiting thrust by body hit points favors small objects.  To model missiles, I\'d go with a maximum of .1 tons/bhp for long-term endurance (hours), up to 1ton/bhp for short duration.

Better to give it a heavier frame.

 The one place I can find any rule reference is the MT Player\'s book. It

In MT the rated danger space of ship lasers for personnel  is  45
meters.  However, since an unarmored ship  hull  has  a  personal
armor equivalent of 33 (IIRC) the firing  ship  could  be  closer
without taking anything other than scorched paint damage.

I think this would depend, in part, on what is being struck.  For
a quick and dirty rule I would say half the  danger  space  range
when firing at a \'normal\' planet surface ... and  make  a  random
missile strike when firing  at  an  unstable  asteroid  with  gas
pockets (aka "Armageddon").

Tuatara, long thought to be a lizard is actually a single representative
of (family, order? I forget which) of modern reptiles; it can best be
described as a \'living dinosaur\'. 

Erudite enough? (and that was off the top of my head, and could well be
wrong, the last time I actually read about it was many many years ago.) 

Cave weta? damned if I know, unless those are those phosphorescent cave
worms that live in colonies...

You are right, I was about to post this.

I did make a fundamental error in my calculation and in my description :-(

I have the consolation that the number was quite close to reality.

I made the mistake of doing it in my head, and not double checking when I had
the spreadsheet open in front of me. Smacks self hard.

The other figures in the post came straight from the spreadsheet though, so
should be OK.

I found that after getting a pair of plastic boots, I was able to do sick
air while towing a skiff loaded with a patient about 58.33% of the time.
Assuming that this requires a 11+, Telemark 4 should cover it, eh? I\'ve
already been up and waxed for a fresh dump two weeks ago.  If only TNF could
perfect a toasty environmental suit that has a limited boost (~1 min?)  to
escape avalaches when you ski sunny chutes.

Just a few weeks ago I decided on using the same system for _Mechwarrior 1. ed._. It produced some very interesting new skills, and more importantly deepened the characters. It was even enought to silence the usual "I can buy only 6 skills, it isn\'t right."-comments. 
Still all this isn\'t all that that strange, this kind of ad hoc rules are quite intuitional...

No, increased the required threshold will DECREASE the distance, but it
will increase the size of object required.

Er, uhm, ehh... heh heh. Oops. I meant decerease, of course. From 0.01 to
0.0001 or some such. Extra digits bad. Fire bad. Bread good.

Again, thanks to everyone for the comments. These are incredibly useful to me.

Actually, it\'s refreshing to receive some spam from another cultural base.
It would be nice if Jesus had provided a translation though. ;)

I just went to a translation page and ran it.  I think it\'s supposed to be a
poem.  From the name of the sender I thought maybe it was some conservative
xtian harassing us.

Translation seems to be.....

                                  NOCTURNAL.
                   When so much themselves suffers without
            dream and by the blood themselves listens that travels
          only the rage, that in the tutanos trembles vigilant the
            hatred and in the marrow burns continuous the revenge,
                  the words then do not serve, are words. .

                              Bullets, Bullets.

             Manifestoes, articles, comments, speecies, humaredas
             lost, fogs stamped, What should pain of papers that
           sweep the wind, what sadness of ink that of erasing the
                                   water! .

                              Bullets, Bullets.

                       Now I suffer the poor thing, it
           mezquino, the sad thing, the unfortunate thing and dead
             person that has a throat when since the abyss of its
          language wanted to shout what is not able for impossible,
                               and silences. .

                              Bullets, Bullets.

               I sit down this injured night of death the words

I don\'t think this is right. The impulse is determined by the KE of the

KE= 1/2*m0*v^2 or at near c KE= (m-m0)c^2. m0=rest mass. m=appearant
mass=m0/sqr(1-(v/c)^2)

But in the hypothetical drive being discussed here the reaction mass isn\'t
coming
from outside the the ship. It has velocity of 0 relitive to the ship and
ends up with a velocity
of whatever(somewhere near c). The reaction masses exit velocity is what
determins the
force applied to the ship. Bouncing has nothing to do with it.

Oh, relativistic formulae?  In fact, the answer here is \'no\', unless for some reason you want to count the specific impulse without including energy.

That\'s a \'huh?\'.  Momentum = mass * velocity.  Now, the power output for a photon drive is twice what you\'d expect from extrapolating from non-relativistic thrusters (in general, power output = 0.5 * Ve * thrust; the power output for a conversion thruster is 1.0 * Ve * thrust) but that\'s just a relativistic effect.

Specific impulse = Ve/9.8.  It doesn\'t matter what your exhaust material is.

book (Principles of Physics by F. Beuche 3rd ed. from physics 101) for more
on the subject.
It says force= mass * acceleration. But I can\'t find anything about
reletivistc effects being applied
to that. Still, it seems that they should somehow. Shouldn\'t the force
applied to a
ship be related to the change in kinetic energy (relative to the ship) of
its reaction mass?
Anyway I can\'t find anything to back up this assumption and I would
appeciate being

It is.  That determines the exhaust velocity, and there is a relativistic effect (the power output of a photon drive is twice what you\'d expect from its exhaust velocity and classical mechanics)

Base pop from UPP is multiplied by Pop Multiplier to find actual population.
ie Pop 9 from UPP = 1 Billion population. If Pop Multiplier is 5 then actual
population is 5 Billion.

Belts indicates the number of non-\'mainworld\' planetoid belts present in the
system.

Gas Giants is the number of Gas Giants (of any size) present in the system.

Hmmm, I was considering this myself.  I\'ll look at the figures (I may use

will probably Hydroponic produce to supplement imports.

Yes, once a vessel \'escapes\' battle it is safe until the next week, but
similarly it cannot rejoin the battle later. It can return to the Inner

No, see the "Surrender" section. You need at least 100 factors of weaponry
in the system, counting all batteries (A=10 etc), and all enemy ships must
be incapacitated or have disengaged.

No. This is just to streamline the game, if we keep track of everything

Hmmm.  Good point.  DM +/- 1 per difference in TL.  TL of troops = TL of
ship they are from.  Upgrading Ship TL upgrades troops TL.  Ships may only
carry troops if quarters / berths allocated at design time.  Add cost of
troop armour, weapons, and vehicles to cost of ship. People are *free*,
equipment isn\'t...

Awwww, that\'s cheating! You were supposed to dredge up the details from
a childhood spent reading encyclopedias...:-P

From the Encyclopedia Britannica site:

tuatara

lizardlike animal (Sphenodon punctatus), the sole living
member of the reptilian order Rhynchocephalia.
Structurally, the tuatara is not much different from
related forms, also assigned to the order
Rhynchocephalia, that may have appeared as early as
the Lower Triassic Period (more than 200,000,000
years ago).

Okay, is that logarithmic?  Let\'s play with the Imperium!

ASSUME: the U.S. is Order of magnitude( 100,000,000 ),
and has a contact separation of 5.  Whack 4 zeros off of the
population, and you have the exponent 10^5.  Log(10^5)=5,
or

Log( pop digit - 3 ) = separation.

So, a world with billions of people has a separation of

Log( 9 - 3 ) = 6.

And an Empire of 10 trillion people has a separation of

Log( 13 - 3 ) = 10.

What an incredibly low number.  Must be wrong.

This leads to a space travel paradigm similar to the CoDominium and
_Mote in God\'s Eye_ settings; most of space travel is spent moving to
and from Alderson points.

<<snip>>

One question that comes to mind is: how much power plant output will be
required, over what period of time, to charge for jump?  After all, the
HG rule of power plant number equalling or exceeding jump number assumes
that you are _also_ pouring buckets of LHyd into your jump drive.  FF&S2
states that jump energy required is "64 MJ per cubic meter per parsec
jumped", delivered in one hour or less. (pg 12)  Again, FF&S2 assumes
that loads of additional fuel are required for jump drives.

My initial WAG [keep in mind that I\'m still only a Journeyman Gearhead
;-)] is that, in the absence of the LHyd requirement for jump, twice the
power indicated by the above rules sets will be required.  However, jump
drives (since they now do not include a fuel burner of their own) will
require only 2/3 the volume and surface area indicated in the rules
(density remains the same for FF&S2 designs).  Cost of jump drives per
m^3 should be half that of standard LHyd jump drives, since no fuel
burner is required.

Note that, using the above WAG, ships under FF&S2 will tend to be a bit
more massive per dton (although, of course, they won\'t require as much
volume for the same cargo or war capacity).  Civilian vessels will tend
to have a lot of excess power plant capacity (which can, of course, be
used when not jumping to power high performance maneuver drives and/or
lasers).  This will also put a ceiling on ship sizes using FF&S2, as
power plants radiators are notorious surface area hogs, and the
square/cube relationship between surface area and volume will make huge
ships (with equally huge power plants) untenable.

Ahhh.... So on page 12 of Book 1, "Weapon Expertise:" it states that
"All player characters have an innate weapon expertise, in all weapons,
of one-half."

Later on, on page 32, in the Combat section, "Expertise:" it states
"Note that all player characters have an expertise on 1/2 in all
weapons. This value is sufficient to avoid the no expertise penalty..."

It further explains that characters may have fractional skill levels
because they are in the midst of acquiring skills, but the referee
should always round down.

maybe I should update this signature...

I disagree with this though..hand ME and Uzi with the safety on and I can\'t
gurantee I could fire it in a pinch.  Simple pistols and rifles are another
matter entirely and I feel confident with them.

OTOH, hand you the same SMG, and give you five minutes of
familiarization, and you\'d probably do all right. A short
familiarization period doesn\'t equate to skill level 1, but it is
appropriate for skill level 1/2 or 0 (depending on the ruleset in
question).

Don\'t forget, the original character generation system (LBB 1) has Gun
Combat skill available in _all_ branches.  The only LBB 1 branch that
doesn\'t offer Blade Combat is the Scout service.  Given the widespread
nature of weapons training in LBB 1, it is not unreasonable to assume
that, in the course of a career, a character would receive at least
rudimentary training in other weapons.

minded members of the list.

How hard is it to use Imperial credits, OUTSIDE the Imperium?
The Sword Worlders (and for that matter the Darrians) have their own currency,
right?
I assume that they conduct trade with the Imperium, so there must be some way to
exchange currencies.
Is the money traded like it is on our <rl> stock markets?
Who sets the exchange rates? That is; how do they decide that a Swordworlder
buck is worth half a credit or whatever?
Is it due to market forces, and does that mean that players would be able to
dabble on the money market?
Finally, how is the money backed? Do they use something like the gold standard
(ie the money is issued against gold and precious metal reserves held by the
government), or what?

The answers to these questions would  equally apply to those worlds within the
Imperium who continue to use their own currency as well as Imperial credits,
which is canon; but considering the history of the Spinward Marches probably
less prevalent there.
(imagines players buying up local currency before news of a Lanthanum ore find
leaks out, or conducting economic warfare against a hostile power)

Giant mutant cockroach from hell would be the best description. Apparently
they make reasonable eating (no I *don\'t* have first hand experience). Most
remarkable feature of some species is their ability to survive being frozen
(as in inside a block of ice) for several months at a time. Apparently they
are studied in cryogenics research. They posses some mechanism (as yet
unknown) that prevents celluar damage upon defrosting.

I think this is the point. _Player_ characters all have 1/2 skill in all
weapons. Like Jory, I think I probably have .5 - .75 in target carbine,
but this is after an intensive training class (Boy Scout Merit Badge) and
practice.

I\'m not a PC. A group of PCs might hire me to work on their computer system
or find out something obscure for them.

Joseph, this is close to what I do IMTU, except the "jump limit" is
a ring around the star about 150 diameters out.  Ships jump from
stellar sized target to stellar sized target, because of their
gravity.  Not their point gravity strength, but their gravity
volume.

Jumping Out - The ship has to travel out a significant distance from
the system\'s star(s) and planets to reduce the "noise" and allow the
ship\'s Jump Sensor to pick up and lock onto stars in other systems.
Jump closer in and it gets more and more difficult for the ship\'s
Astrogator to get the Sensor to "lock" through the "hash" increasing
the chances of a misjump.

Jumping In - If all went well, the ship has been sitting at a
system\'s "jump limit" for about a week while the jump bubble
dissipated.  When the bubble evaporates the ship precipitates into
the new system about 150 diameters out from a stellar sized object.
If it didn\'t go well, the ship precipitates out somewhere else, and
if it went really *really* wrong the ship doesn\'t precipitate out at
all.

True, but I have no clue if Niven & Pournelle ever published their notes for 
the Alderson Drive anywhere, so figuring out where an Alderson Point is, your 
guess is prolly better than mine.  They *seem* to be on the order of a few 
AU\'s out from the primary (except of course for the one in Murcheson\'s Eye)

As more starships are built it gets harder to get them into jump space
otherwise why put in the extra HPG banks. Obviously jump drives are

Jump drive should be phased out and replaced with a more benign FTL system.

Bullets of Rifles. Rafael Alberti was a poet of the generation of the 27,
poetic movement prior to the Spanish Civil War, he was affiliated to the
Communist Party, and he had to exile from Spain during forty years. With
Lorca, he is considered the best spanish poet of this century. In the poem
he feels so enraged that he lament that the words are not sufficient.

It\'s tempting to say the same thing about the value of 6 for current 
day  Earth, but it does assume a few things. The biggest assumption
is that the level of contact can be very, very short and/or 
distant. For example, how many levels of contact between me and the
former president of Indonesia? Well, the President of the University
of Waterloo, who gave me my hood at convocation has probably either
met the Primer Minister of Canada or someone who has met the PM and
the PM had met the former Pres of Indonesia, so voila. The second 
assumption is that 6 is kind of an average, where you have a huge
number of people you can daw lines with lengths less than 6, so the
occasional line of 7 or 8 is considered acceptable.

On most Imperial worlds the game will be "how do I draw a line from
me to the Duke" at which point the Duke will have probably met the 
Emperor (at least seen him in person in court once) and then back
through some other Duke to whoever else you want to connect to.
10 steps is probably doable most of the time. I doubt you\'d ever need
to go over 15 for two Imperial residents who are both really, really 
isolated.

	Even more wrong if you go the other way:

		Log(2-3) = undefined

	You could try Log(base 100):

		Log100(250 million) = 4.2 (pretty close)

		Log100(1000) = 1.5 (not too bad)

		Log100(10 trillion) = 6.5 (even worse than 10)

	So maybe it\'s not logarithmic.

I would have liked it more if I could have understood it.  I remember just
enough Spanish from school (the only language other than English that I am
any good at is Japanese, though I can still read some French if I try)
that I could get a sense of it and get a sense that it was really good and
that I was missing a lot.

I have known that feeling, though it wasn\'t from politics, it was from
love.  It\'s so hard.

So are you on this list all the time, just lurking, and accidentally sent
this to the list when you were sending to all your friends?  I don\'t
recall you have posted before.

Well, I did like the poem and I kept it, so don\'t feel too bad.

Oooooooh, that\'s a good idea!  I love political plot lines for games!  It
could be you could have a poet in trouble could be the patron, or maybe to
rescue a Zhodani poet/writer is your job, either so that s/he can escape a
fate worse than death or s/he can help the cause of peace or whatever...

Those exiled poets would probably be the toast of Rim culture.  Anything to
make the Solomani look bad.  Of course, solSec wouldn\'t approve.

Scenario: A prominent Solomani writer has jumped the line, and is now
touring the Imperial sections of the Rim, giving speeches and readings.
The characters are assigned/hired to escort him.  Possible problems:

1. On a world with strong pro-Solomani feelings, his remarks spark a riot.
2. The writer has some.. interesting tastes in entertainment, which he will
do anything to fulfil.
3. At least once during the tour, SolSec will try to kidnap the writer.

A very good ObTrav.

Poets usually don\'t have any money, but this reminds me of a movie I saw
once... Hmm... The spaceship is idling on the tarmac of the downport
formerly held by Solomani, but recently overrun by the Imperium. The
formerly incorrigible spaceport saloon keeper (reminds one of Han Solo,
just in it for the money) is now saying the wife (played by Ingrid Bergman)
of the great Solomani poet, Victor Lazlo, "And you never will. But I\'ve
got a job to do, too. And where I\'m going you can\'t follow. What I\'ve got
to do, you can\'t be any part of. Ilsa, I\'m no good at being noble, but it
doesn\'t take much to see that the problems of three little people don\'t
amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Some day you\'ll understand
that. Here\'s looking at you, kid."


Reminds me of Loren\'s version of the "Episode 1".

  Per HG2, to Jump a ship must supply in two turns energy from at least a
Power Plat of rating equal to the desired Jump rating. Per p. 43 a black
globe allows this step to skipped; however, it would still need sufficient
L-Hyd to Jump, _after_ the energy input requirements are met.

ONE DAY IN PEACE

JANUARY 1st, 2000

This a 24 hour concept where no guns are fired anywhere on earth,
including on television. What if: for 24 hours, whosoever was at war
in December 1999,agrees that for one whole day, no guns would  be
fired. The silence would be golden. What if: the television
programmers of the world agreed NOT to air any programming with a
violent content? What if people boycotted movies with violent
content? At present this ONE DAY IN PEACE concept is beginning to
get further circulation. Can you spread this concept so that a
possibility might become a reality? This is a \'thought-wave
campaign\' - that is to say, the more people who grasp this thought,
the more it comes into reality.

I don\'t believe that censoring the media will make the world a more

case, then Japan would be more violent than the US (do you ever watch
anime? that stuff is on network TV!) but instead their crime rate is much
lower. Actually I think that these TV programs provide people with a
needed outlet for their emotional energies.

I would love to see the world at peace but there are better ways to do it 
than censoring TV, radio, movies, and books-- and games!

I also don\'t think that the Traveller list is the best place to promote 
this... I mean, what\'s next, don\'t play Traveller on the One Day of Peace
because Traveller has fighting in it?  Hel-lo?

You know, though, most lines are a lot SHORTER than you think.

Example.

My all time favorite musician, Ozaki Yutaka, the Elvis of Japan who died
in 1992 and whose funeral was attended by 10,000...

I am one of the few, the proud, the obsessed.  I also have a line of only
*2* between me and Ozaki.  My best female friend, Junko, has a very close
friend who attended the same private high school as Ozaki in Shibuya
during the early 80\'s, and remembers him well.  And those aren\'t
handshakes.  This is pretty good considering that I was raised in West
Virginia and didn\'t even get to California till 95, Japan a couple years
later....  When Junko told me this, I was bowled over.  13 is easy for me
to believe of the Imperium.

The game only works for "societies" or "cultures". So the US & Canada
probably work as one "population". England and Australia probably link
in, but the links between the three populations are a lot sparser than
the Internal links.

When you start crossing language barriers or major transportation
barriers it gets a *lot* different. 

Outside of the folks who travel between worlds *routinely*, there
aren\'t going to *be* any significant inter-world linkages in the
Imperium. You may know someone who moved 1 or 2 jumps away. But what
are the odds that an average person will have any sort of "personal"
relationship with someone 5 or 6 jumps away? Even *business*
relationships will be pretty abstract.

Depends on the local government. *And* on how much *trade* with the
Imperium the world has.

Probably.

Simplest way of all. You buy a cargo at one end with Imperial Credits
and sell it at the other end for local money. The *average* of such
transactions is the "real" exchange rate. 

Note that this means that given the right circumstances, the A->B rate
may not be the inverse of the B->A rate. 

In actual practice, governments (or banks) at each end set their own
rates based on a combo of their "best guess" at the real rate, and
their desire to make a profit. They may also want to affect the rate
for reasons of their own.

> Is the money traded like it is on our <rl> stock markets?

> buck is worth half a credit or whatever?

See above. In the real markets, exchange rates are of two kinds
"official" rates, which are what a givernment will pay in exchange for
its own currency, and "market" rates which are what the *other* traders
in the market will pay. 

> Is it due to market forces, and does that mean that players would be able to
> dabble on the money market?

A combo of market forces, "chaos" (in the mathematical sense) and
governments and other large players trying to "force" values to where
they want them.

> Finally, how is the money backed? Do they use something like the gold
> standard (ie the money is issued against gold and precious metal
> reserves held by the government), or what?

Monies "backed" by something tend to run into problems when the supply
of "something" expands to fast (New World gold *ruined* the Spanish
economy). They also run into problems when the supply is too *small*
(basicly, the supply of "cash" is insufficient to allow for all the
transactions required). 

You see, "money" is an *abstraction*. A means of trying to keep score.
Basicly, money is merely a fancy system of "IOUs" that functions
because people expect it to function.

A "dollar" has *no* intrinsic value. Its worth depends on what goods or
services people are willing to give you in exchange for it. And that
changes depending on location and circumstances. 

Currency gets *really* messy. The Russian Ruble before the collapse of
the USSR is a good example. They had something like *four* "rubles"
which *in theory* were of equal value. 

There was a gold-backed ruble used *only* for foreign exchange. That
is, for buying things from outside. Possesion of them *inside* the
USSR, much less trying to convert them to gold was a crime!

There was an *internal* ruble. The stuff they paid people in and that
the average person had to pay for things with. These were illegal to
take out of the country. It was even difficult to buy good for export
with them!

When American companies like Pepsi started selling in the USSR, they
had some *real* problems getting their profits out. Pepsi finally
worked out a deal where for every liter of Pepsi sold in the USSR, they
could export a liter of Stoli vodka! Pepsi wasn\'t exactly upset at the
deal... 

I think the third kind of rubles were used by the folks with "special
priveleges" and were only usable in shops catering to such. With
*these* rubles, you could buy imported goods. Having them was
"supposed" to be limited to certain people, but in practice, if you had
some, you could use them. 

I forget what the fourth type was.

Admittedly, this is an extreme value, but *because* it is so extreme, I
think it helps get across the idea that the only value a currency has
lies in what you can buy with it. And that this varies according to
*where* you are. 

Russian internal rubles, even if you could get them out of the country
were utterly *worthless* in the west. But when tourists or other
vistors *entered* the USSR they were *required* to convert their
currency into the internal ruble at an exchange rate very favorable to
the government.

A good example of this is in the movie "The Abyss" when the rat-boy tries to

guy.

Very good point.  I think then that I would make non-military PCs with no
weapons skills have to get familiar with their weapons somehow previous to
using them.

That makes you one of the \'cross-cultural\' links - analogous to the regular
space travellers (ie PCs) in Traveller.  (See, PCs have many more functions
that you might expect).

So, going through you, Kiri, can I be linked to John Woo? :-)

I don\'t know. I\'m pretty sure it\'s a yes, though.

A lot of my contacts in HK are thru my ex husband.  I may not be able to
get you the most direct line because he and his family and I are not
speaking.  I have other friends over there, though.

I will ask around and see if we can play 6 degrees of John Woo.  That\'d be
fun.  Knowing him would be cool.  I think I may have at least one link to
him because I have hung out with Eric Nakamura of _Giant_Robot_ magazine
at a couple conventions around here, and I\'m pret\' sure they\'ve at least
met... or that one of Eric\'s writers has interviewed Woo.  Being a fairly
big name fan in the shoujo anime/Japanese doll & toy collector world gives
me a lot of contacts in anime, manga, rubber monster, HK film and other
Asian trash cinema fandom... so if I don\'t know someone I may know someone
they\'ve met.  

I\'m sure that if Ozaki was only 2 away, Woo can\'t be much farther.  HK and
Japan being much smaller than the US... I bet I know someone who knows
someone who...

(*I* wanna link with Himuro Kyousuke-- another musician-- but then again,
I really wanna link with him physically, as in up close, personal, full
body contact...  ^_-  Kimura Takuya would be fun too!)

Well you seem to have the business down, for those pictures look very good.
Nice compsition and realistic lighting. 

You are far beyond me in this, and I have used many hours to try to

Eris, since IYTU Astrogators seem to be detecting the jumpspace

Say, for instance, a ship sitting at the 150 diameter limit, waiting for

I understand.  So am I.  (Then why did I send this along, you might 
be asking yourself?  Because the message only asked, it did not

the choice up to me.)

A good point, and yes, I have to agree, it is stupid to assume that 
someone would give up _GAMING_ for such a concept.  I certainly 
won\'t, and none of the rest of the TML would either.

I know the One Day of Peace concept and methods are impractical, 
impossible, and probably immoral to boot.  That doesn\'t stop me from 
appreciating the thought or gesture behind it, and sending it on to 
someone who might enjoy it and appreciate it as well.

And now for something a bit more appropriate for this list:

ObTrav:  The PCs are approached by a small diplomatic entourage
seeking aid in handling a small situation back on their homeworld, a
small backwater planet rife with guerilla warfare against the
current established government.  A movement of One Dayers (One Day
For Peace) has started up in an effort to bring about some resolution
of conflict, asking One Day for Peace so that a treaty or settlement
might be worked out.  The more spiritually enlightened charismatic
leader of the movement was slain in the mutual assassination attempts
wrought under the auspice of this peace treaty, and both factions are
now in an uproar over the other side\'s violation of the peace effort,
the One Dayers caught in the middle.  The Entourage represents a more
liberal faction of the established government, which is willing to
continue the negotiations, if the guerillas are willing to speak, but
none of the One Dayers are trusted, nor are members of the
established government.  Imperial bureaucracy will not provide a
means of addressing the situation until their diplomats are safe,
i.e. the fighting has stopped.  Caught in this no-win situation, the
diplomatic Entourage has turned to outside help in this matter, and
would like to hire the PCs to deliver their message and a diplomat to
the guerilla leaders.  Appropriate recompense, hazard pay and some
military equipment will be provided if desired, as well as a parcel
of land once a settlement has been reached.  The land is actually
worth a significant amount of credits, and the Entourage assures the
PCs that there are a number of buyers, both on- and off-world, who
would offer significant amounts for this previously unavailable
property.

1.  The situation is actually as presented, and the government is 
very willing to end this warfare that is destroying their business 
and their way of life.  The guerillas are not willing to talk, and a 
resolution doesn\'t look likely without more bloodshed.  In order to 
get paid, though, a settlement must be reached...

2.  The Entourage secretly represents a more militant group within 
the established government. They are actually planning to use 
the PCs to sneak a nuclear device into the guerilla camp, explode it, 
and blame the guerillas for their incompetence, in order to cut 
through Imperial red tape and get the Imperial Marines in on their 
side.  If anything should come into the open, the PCs will be 
portrayed as gunrunners sneaking a nuclear device to the guerilla 
encampment.

3.  As number 2, but one of the Entourage is secretly a One Dayer, 
and plans to take the nuclear device and use it to force both 
factions to meet and complete their peace treaty, all in the name of 
the dead charismatic leader of the movement.  If the One Dayer has 
revealed himself, then actions have already gone into place which 
will reveal the government\'s plan to interstellar media should he 
prove unsuccessful, turning the event into a smear campaign against 
the militant faction of the established government, trying to guilt 
the more liberal aspects of the world\'s government into making more 
peaceful overtures to the guerillas.

4.  The Entourage are actually guerillas posing as government 
officials, and the "guerilla camp" is actually the headquarters of a 
very successful general using guerilla tactics against the 
insurgence.  The Entourage is hoping to get their assassin into the 
highly secure camp and kill the general.  If caught, evidence has 
been placed pointing back to the One Dayers.

5.  As 4, but the camp is actually a commune of One Dayers, who have 
gone militant in defense of their compound after the death of their 
charismatic leader.  The guerillas are hoping to release biological 
agents on the One Dayers that were confiscated from the military of 
the established government, leaving behind the evidence so that it 
appears to be an action against the One Dayers by the established 
government\'s military.  The guerillas are hoping to turn the general 
population against the established government and start a 
full-fledged civil uprising.

6.  The entire scenario is a hoax.  Once the PCs are onboard the ship
back to the homeworld, they are drugged in their sleep, and wake up
days later among other prisoners in shackles and chains.  They soon
discover that they are destined for a secret prison colony, under 
false charges against the state, where they will work until they 
escape or die, for the benefit of the corrupt government.

Enjoy,
Jason

Actually the people to ask are Pournelle, and the guy who *invented*
the drive for him, Dan Alderson of CalTech. 

Basicly, Pournelle gave him a description of the sort of limits he
wanted the drive to have and Alderson came up with a way to have such a
drive *if* there was a "fifth force".

Our party is about to enter the Sword Worlds cluster in our search for fame and
profit. As a result, I\'ve got a couple of questions for the more economically
minded members of the list.

How hard is it to use Imperial credits, OUTSIDE the Imperium?
The Sword Worlders (and for that matter the Darrians) have their own currency,
right?
I assume that they conduct trade with the Imperium, so there must be some way to
exchange currencies.
Is the money traded like it is on our  stock markets?
Who sets the exchange rates? That is; how do they decide that a Swordworlder
buck is worth half a credit or whatever?
Is it due to market forces, and does that mean that players would be able to
dabble on the money market?
Finally, how is the money backed? Do they use something like the gold standard
(ie the money is issued against gold and precious metal reserves held by the
government), or what?
- ----

I give a more compelete treatment of this and many other economic topics in GT: Far Trader.

The ease of using Imperial Credits outside the Imperium depends on the amount of trade with the Imperium, the stability of the local currency, and the local laws.  Worlds that trade heavily with the Imperium will have healthy currency exchanges that make it easy to swap one currency for another.  Worlds that don\'t have a stable currency of their own may use the Cr as a de facto local currency.  In the Real World, your cab driver will accept American dollars in lots of Third World countries because it is a safer store of value than the local currency.  Finally, the local government may have laws mandating a fixed exchange rate for the currency, establishing rules about how much money you can move onto or off of the planet, etc.  Based on my understanding of the Sworld Worlds, they probably each have their own currency.

The exchange rate between currencies can be set one of two ways: through a fixed rate or a flexible rate.  Fixed rates are where the currency issuing institution (usually a gov\'t but could be a bank or anyone really) publishes an exchange rate and then promises to convert one currency to the other at that rate.  As long as everyone has confidence the issuing institution can keep its promise, things are fine, but if the institution\'s reserves fall to low levels there may be a "run" on the currency, where people rush to convert their money before the institution folds.  This is very similar to a bank run.  Flexible exchange rates are where the conversion price is set by supply and demand.  If everyone want Imperial Credits so they can order Imperial goods out of the ACME catalog, then the price of the Cr will rise relative to local currency, and vice versa.  If the players chose, they could dabble in the money market.  There are rules for trading currency, pork bellies, or wha!
 te!
!
ver, in Far Trader.

Historically, currencies have been backed by a particular commodity.  The US used gold for a long time.  A sci-fi currency might be backed by something more exotic like lanthanum.  But the price of commodities like gold is set by supply and demand, too, so when gold is scarce the US suffered from deflation* and when gold was plentiful, the US risked inflation.  If you wanted to practice "economic warfare" on such a world, you could import cheap gold (or whatever they use) and potentially trigger a bout of hyper-inflation.  Advanced country modern currencies are back by nothing or everything, depending how you look at it.  In essence, the modern $ (or pound, or euro, or DM) is backed by everything you can buy with a $.  The value of the $ is determeined by supply and demand, so when people want to buy $ denominated assets (things in the US or other countries that use the $) the demand for $ goes up and so does the price.  When the Federal Reservere lowers interest rates the s!
 up!
!
ply of $ goes up and the price goes down.

*There\'s an intriguing story that the original Wizard of Oz book was actually a turn-of-the-century populist political tract advocating a switch from the gold to the silver standard for the US dollar.  The price of gold had been going up at the end of the century causing deflation, raising the real value of debts.  Farmers and other folks agitated for the silver standard because the value of silver was dropping, which would cause inflation and lower the real value of their debts.  Sounds like a net.rumor, I know, but I heard it on PBS, so it must be true :-)

Simplest way of all. You buy a cargo at one end with Imperial Credits
and sell it at the other end for local money. The *average* of such
transactions is the "real" exchange rate. 

Note that this means that given the right circumstances, the A->B rate
may not be the inverse of the B->A rate.

You\'d have to give me a *very* good reason to believe this.  In the Real World this doesn\'t happen any more because of our global currency markets.  I doubt it could even happen in the TU, at least for very long, because of the extraordinary profit opportunity such an event would create.  All it would take would be some banks or even black marketeers to spot this arbitrage opportunity and drive the two prices to parity.  Only a *really* thin currency market could stand something like this existing.

Please do, and render some more "primative" spacecraft. I doubt SJG will
have Jesse work much in that area, so you probably have an open field, and
your work is wonderful. Great contrast to the TL C+ craft we are used to
seeing.

Quite right, quite right. I erroneously assumed that the WinCalculator would
behave like a standard calculator and do operators in the order I inputted
them. Instead the silly thing thinks for you and does operation in order
precedence. I should have checked my numbers.
Corrected numbers:

				DR
Combat Armor		20	(20+10)x1.0x10=300 (yards) medium frame		273 m
Battle Dress		100	(100+10)x2.0x10=2200 (yards) heavy frame		2 km
Improved Battle Dress	120	(120+10)x2.0x10=2600 (yards) heavy frame		2.3 km
Sane Battle Dress		500	(500+10)x2.0x10=10200 (yards) heavy frame		9.2 km
Insane-Battle Dress	1400	(1400+10)x2.0x10=28200 (yards) heavy frame	25 km

				DR
Combat Armor		20	(20+10)x.25x10=75 (yards) .25 extra-light frame	68 m
Battle Dress		100	(100+10)x.5x10=550 (yards) light frame	500 m
Improved Battle Dress	120	(120+10)x.5x10=650 (yards) light frame	590 m
Sane Battle Dress		500	(500+10)x.5x10=2550 (yards) light frame	2.3 km
Insane-Battle Dress	1400	(1400+10)x.5x10=7050 (yards) light frame	6.4 km

So correctly if Scout Expedition dress is light frame then (40+10)x.5x10=250
yards for limbs, which would be the most limiting DR. And which matches the
design in First In. Sorry for the errors.

There were anarchists running around in the Russian Revolution.  Makhno, in
the Ukraine, was one of the best known, though some anarchists disown him. 

At a pinch, you could possibly include Zapata in Mexico.

Basically, anarchism tends to appeal to peasants, who really only want
land, and to be left alone.  

> The Paris Communards were mostly Marxists.

Incorrect.  There were very few French Marxists in 1871.  The Communard
leaders were mostly other types of socialists, like Proudhonists and
Blanquists.  Their destruction left a vacuum the Marxists filled.

Marx was very thrilled by the Commune, even though it wasn\'t his people
that led it.  It became the \'model\' of a socialist state, up until 1917. 
The Soviets in the Russian Revolution were at least partly based on the
Commune, but were pretty much destroyed during the Civil War and the
accompanying famine, and never recovered as autonomous bodies.  OBTRAV: 
What if?

  Yes. ;-)
  While writing Far Trader, I figured out that (IIRC) at average US commodity market prices, a dton of wheat cost $1000*.  Since in GT it only costs around $600/pc to ship a dton, you can ship bulk goods off-world without even doubling their price.  Considering that on Earth, we get our air, water, soil, light, and gravity free while an asteroid colony would have to pay for all that, doubling the price seems a bargain.

*This is in GT$ not US$.

Jim explicitly assumes that >something similar operates in Traveller.

Actually, I explicitly assume that there are *no* shipping conferences in Traveller.  I don\'t have my books with me, but there\'s a line in the "Competition in the Shipping Industry" sidebar to the effect that Cleon banned such arrangements as combinations in restraint of trade.  Instead there are unstable and informal cartels that enforce their agreements through price and trade wars rather than legally binding arrangements. 

I did this because it made for lots of interesting adventure possibilities and allowed free traders to play a role by smoothing out the price fluctuations that naturally occur in the absence of conferences.  Allowing conferences would have made the justification for Beowulf Free Traders even weaker than it already is.  

If you are looking for a justification for the canonical fixed 1000Cr/dton/jump freight rate you can easily invoke shipping conferences.  I chose to interpret this instead as a useful simplification for game purposes and allowed prices to vary in the advanced trade rules.

There was, in a way - the non-compliance rate has been very high. 
Similarly here in NZ the relicencing of fireamrs owners hasn\'t worked 
well because a very high percentage (exact numbers vary depending on 
who you talk to) simply haven\'t bothered, even though if you dan\'t you 
can\'t handle a firearm AT ALL without committing a fairly expensive 
crime (IIRC up to a $5000 fine and/or 2 years).

TSR\'s Alternity SFRPG (which owes an aweful lot to Traveller, IMO) has 
it that you lose a \'tachyon charge\' during jump that needs to be 
replenished in normal space before you can jump again. Perhaps some 
mechanism like that would be of use.

In NZ we already pay GST (Goods and Services Tax) of 12.5% on 
everything, including import duties and petrol, alcohol and tobacco 
taxes.

A Cave Weta is a large insect that lives on the walls and ceilings of 
damp caves. They are well known for their habit of falling down the 
back of peoples necks and getting caught up in hair when they are 
distrubed. They are harmless, but look like very large spiders and thus 
freak a fair number of people out. A medium sized specimen would have a 
body about 5cm long and legs that span about 15cm (that\'s 2 inches and 
6 inches if YTU uses GT :)

It also came out in softcover in blue with a W.H. Keith, Jr painting of 
the Far Traveller on the cover. IIRC this went with _The Traveller

(3) The merchant hulls are going that way anyway, so they might as well
travel with _something_ rather than nothing. Works when shipping bulky
stuff in one direction, smaller more valuable stuff in the other direction
(you might was well fill the difference in space with something, as long as
you can sell it for a few centimes more than you paid).

Note that the US is also a very mobile society. People move very easily,
travel is cheap, and communication is instant.  It might be instructive to
look at a medieval society, as well as an early Victorian society, to see
what different scaling factors (if any) exist.

Hm. Thinking through my international contacts, counting one and two

the Ukraine (2), Greece (2), Turkey (2), Italy (2), Rumania (2), Hungary
(2), Switzerland (2), Germany(2)...

where (1) means I know someone there and (2) means I know someone who knows
people there (in this case because they come from there -- I can probably
add a lot more countries if I actually ask around).  I\'ve only included
people I know well, not just handshakes and email contacts.

I\'m NOT very well travelled-- I always go back to the same places!  LOL,
you have a lot more contacts outside your country than I do.  OTOH my life
is bisected by the Pacific-- half of it\'s here in California and the other
half in Japan.  Well, OK, maybe some of it\'s back in Ohio and Appalachia
where I used to live-- but not much.  I talk to my parents once or twice a
month and to one of my ex-husbands once or twice a week (if he weren\'t gay
we might still be married, LOL)

So perhaps you\'d be more PC-ish and I\'d be like one of those people that
always runs the same route between 2-3 planets (in my case, Ohio,
California, Japan, and occasional stops in HK, Taiwan, and Singapore... I
have ONE friend in Indonesia, but we\'re not as close as we used to be
because she doesn\'t like Hiroshi.)

The Ontario government has come up with a new grading system for school
students. It is roughly as follows:

level 4 - exceeds expectations (>90%)
level 3 - meets expectation (75-90%)
level 2 - meets many expectation, but not all (60-75%)
level 1 - meets bare minimum of expectations (50-60%)

There is also a phantom "level 0", which is a failing grade.  The
government expects level 4 to be rare, no more than 5% of the students;
only time will tell if they stick to their guns when parents arrive (with
lawyers) to argue for marks...

Anyway, my problem is that the government has provided no system for
combining marks from many evaluations into a final grade. Our instructions
are merely to use the "predominant" level, which is pretty vague and not
what we were promised. The new automated gradebook, which was supposed to
do this automatically, has been delayed again, and we have to provide marks
by November 15.

Can anyone provide me with a mathematically valid way of combining these
marks together? Mere averaging doesn\'t work, obviously. The percentage
equivalents I\'ve provided are just guidelines - the actual marks are
arrived at by consulting descriptions of what that level of work should be
like. I\'ll provide more details via private email on request.

Professional note: if we use your idea, I\'ll make certain that you get
co-author status on our report.

    I\'m sorry to hear about this.  I\'m probably one of the many on this list
that
believes in a good education, and holding the students accountable for their
performance.  This grading system appears to remove any form of
competition and sense of accomplishment.  If the final grade has no basis
in the students\' performance for that period of time, then this becomes a
matter of giving the student a mark based upon nothing.

    This move looks like a major cave in to political correctness.  In the
short
term this will hurt the students, but in the long run it will hurt Canada.

    Sorry about the math.  I won\'t be able to help you there.  Maybe some
sort
of Random number generator will give you a perfect bell curve.  According
to your description of how the grading system is supposed to work, I
wouldn\'t
worry about trying to match it to the students performance.  It doesn\'t
really
matter.

    Just my 0.02 cents.  Please don\'t take this as an attempt to bash
Canada.
I don\'t particularly have a warm spot in my heart for the American
government
either.

How did your friend manage to meet the first ruler of the Second
Imperium, and what did she find objectionable about him?

Designer\'s Notes:

First, I wanted to try designing a 100-dton Jump-6 ship, that had some
actual utility (a bit of cargo and passenger space).  Next, I tried to
imagine who would purchase such a ship.  Governments would probably be
interested (hence the MCr 40.579/MCr 36.521 "stripped" variant).  I also
believe that there would be a market in M:1100 for a jump-6 personal
transport.  Those potential buyers would likely prefer highly
comfortable accomodations, which is why I used a cost multiplier of 1.2
(to account for luxurious furnishings).

Comments, anyone?

Almost unknown to me I already had one 3d program, Corel 3d Dream that came
with my Corel 6 package. After "cutting my teeth on Truespace, I went back
and hit the Corel books and that program, Since Truespace didn\'t have a
manual I missed a lot of truely GOOD things while tinkering with it, I found
out about many of them thriugh the Corel Dream manual.

By luck I found  someone that was looking to get rid of the RayDream 5.2
package, the big brother version to Corel Dream. This was an easier
transition, but now Metacreations is brining out a totally new 3d program,
incorperatin parts of Raydream, parts of Infinity D (?) and an interface
similar to the new poser and Bryce interface. So now I have to decide
whither I want to "upgrade" to another program, and is Carrara (MC\'s
program) the right one.

Lightwave, as Jesse uses it, seems to have some real advantages, but at a
very high cost. Of course the program doesn\'t do it all... even with it I
doubt that I\'d be in Jesse\'s league (well I can wish, but..), so is it worth
the money? Probably not at this time...

Well, that\'s how I started playing with this stuff, and it now consumes MOST
of my free time! My wife uses the names of several 3d artists on this list
as if they contained ony 4 letters... and says that they are going to be
named in the divorce papers, but dang if it isn\'t fun!!!

Um, I introduced them, remember that Six Degrees of whomever game we were
playing?  Didn\'t know my web was that extensive didja?

She doesn\'t like his religious beliefs, or rather lack of them.  And she
doesn\'t understand aspects of our relationship that are not to be discussed
on the Traveller Mailing List.  <WEG>

Wow, does this mean I\'m gonna get to be EMPRESS???

(I totally forgot that there was an Emperor named Hiroshi.  Well, I think my
Hiroshi would make a great Emperor.  It would be an Imperium filled with
great porn, trashy media, and marvellous music... and the fashions!  WOW!)

Yeah, unless you\'re stinkin\' rich and can afford to throw money at a hobby
you may not end up pursueing, Lightwave is a *wee* bit pricey to start with
($1,800 for 5.5, goes up to $2,495 when L[6] streets).  On the other hand,
if you start playing around with 3D and like it, Lightwave is definately a
pacakage to reckon with if you can afford it.  B5, Star Trek\'s DS9 &
Voyager, and countless others all use it.  Seen the new Pontiac commercials
with the car driving through and around all these weird metallic looking
things?  That was LW too.

Great. Just what we need, an entire day with nothing good on TV.

But I *like* movies with violent content...

Looks like on January 1st I\'m going to have to run an action film
marathon. Let\'s see... Starship Troopers, Commando (Schwarzenegger),
The Running Man (Arnie again), Robocop, Die Hard 1 & 2, Terminator 1
& 2... I own all of these, except Commando (which I can borrow from my
mom).

Japanese kids watch cartoons, movies, and tv shows that are more violent
than what we see in North America, and they play more violent video games.
Yet the crime rate over there is much lower than it is here. However, since
I do not want to start (yet another) debate about the Second Amendment, I
will refrain from drawing a conclusion in this forum. :-D

on textures (which I\'ll need later), and organic looking stuff.  I on the

Star Wars or B5 (the humans) spaceships, blasters, etc.

Furthermore, it would be nice if the tutorial would discuss 
generalities.  There are all too many tutorials out there that are along 
the lines of "Here\'s how to model a banana" that teach nothing more than 
how to model bananas, without addressing more general features of the tools.

If anyone has a pointer to this sort of stuff, I\'d greatly appreciate it.

Excellent idea!  

But EDU might not be the best way to rate certain kinds of hobby
skills.  DEX (or AGL depending on your system) might be better for
skills that depend on physical characteristics and EDU for mental
based skills.  Would levels equal to both DEX and EDU for
appropriate hobby skills be too much?  Also, shouldn\'t the number of
terms the character has "served" be a limit on such skills.

Maybe something like this:  The PC gets 4 levels per term for
hobby/trivia skills.  The maximum limit in levels for physical based
skills is the PC\'s DEX and for mentally based skills is EDU.  The
skills chosen shouldn\'t be profession or career related, and, as
always, the GM has final approval.

This would be great!  Suz\'s character, Mira, can now have that high
skill in Spherical Handball, Cory his cello and musical composition
skills, Martan has a way to be skilled at rock climbing, Woof can
have his archaeology hobby and it doesn\'t affect their professional
and career based skills.

If you can find a place on a 100 dton, J-6 ship for a small craft, then
feel free to carry one.  ;-)

Anyway, the ship is streamlined, so it can serve as its own dinghy.

Thanks for the feedback.

You must only use cheap calculators. Even my *old* TI calc uses order

Well, I didn\'t say it was *common*, just *possible*. And most folks
merely consider this sort of thing to indicate "high profit cargo"
rather than currency exchange.

With the Alderson Drive most stars only had connections to a few
other stars, and many stars weren\'t connected at all.  Might explain
why the universe appears so flat. 

I think the MiGE/CoD universe would be a great place to play, but it
needs a well thought out setup.  I don\'t think either Pournelle or
Nivin rpg, or have any interest in rpging.  I\'d also lay you odds
that they would want a nice hefty licensing fee to use their
background in anything commercial.  I don\'t even know if it would be
legal to develop something non-commercial based on the MiGE universe
for more than personal use.

It certainly *would* be an interesting project.

There is indeed hope for you ;)

Actually, I\'ve mentioned before that nearly ANYONE can LEARN how to do 3D.
In it\'s simplest form all it is is putting together basic primatives to get
your scene.  Take a Merc Cruiser for example.  In it\'s simplest form, it\'s a
big sphere (main hull), four small spheres (main hull turrets), four medium
sized boxes (the "legs"), and four small boxes (the leg turrets).  That\'s
it.  All the rest of the details (what 3D folks generally call "nurnies" and
physical model shops call "greeblies") are just variations on that theme.
Other ship types are more involved, but EVERY single ship that I\'ve ever
done started out as a box, sphere, or cone.  The rest is just subtlety and
texture mapping.

Best,
Jesse

Japanese kids watch cartoons, movies, and tv shows that are more violent
than what we see in North America, and they play more violent video games.
Yet the crime rate over there is much lower than it is here. However, since
I do not want to start (yet another) debate about the Second Amendment, I
will refrain from drawing a conclusion in this forum. :-D

Not at this point.  I won\'t rule out the possibility, though.  <g>
It\'s the same with the possibility of FTL stutterwarp, not at this
point, but *perhaps* possible.

Yep, it sure would.  That\'s why even if it\'s theoritically possible
it won\'t happen...at least not as more than a fluke.

I\'ve used povray, and it\'s very easy to use, but at least back when I use it
the problem was that it\'s _just_ a renderer .

It doesn\'t really provide you with any tools for interactively designing
anything, you describe all the points, the textures, and the lighting in a
_text_ file, and then tell povray  to render it.

Really easy to use for spheres & squares, etc, but very hard to define
complex 3D objects,  though some people have done some amazing work with it.
If you have some too that can provide you with a three-dimensional point
map, then PovRay can render it.

There are other options out there.  Bryce is nowhere near as expensive as
Light Wave and it has a much better and easier to use interface than
LightWave, though obvioulsy it\'s not as powerful.

Bryce also let\'s you do complete scenes nicely, as it includes Vista-Pro
type landscape tools as well as cloud maps, and specific lighting tools for
replicating the effect of a light source through cloud /haze/fog

Thanks for the praise!  Being single helps I guess, although I\'m sure that
before I started on this 3D stuff I had a social life (it seems to have
wandered off somewhere else whilst I wasn\'t looking).

The model is handcrafted POV-Ray as I find a programming language easier than
using a modeller. (So far at least: Daedalus is mostly made from primitives,
with a couple of lathe objects - no meshes.  I guess doing those by hand
would cause my social life to leave me for good!)

Actually, the main reason I used POV-Ray is because it\'s free and I wanted to
see if I enjoyed 3D work (which I do) and if I had any talent at it, before
spending good money on other software.

The image maps are produced using The GIMP which seems to be an extremely
powerful package (i.e. I don\'t understand 90% of the facilities available.
Before creating the maps for Daedalus I had never used anything more
complicated than a basic paint program).

As for the lighting, it\'s very simple.  No ambient lighting for those harsh
shadows, and a single large light a long way away for the star.  Oh, and a
another bright light sitting in the engine if it\'s switched on!

I don\'t know. The odds against anyone being able to park an asteroid at any
particular spot 150 diameters out from a planet at a week\'s notice are
literally astronomical.

The odds of them being able to get a military vessel into shooting range are
better. Whether they would want to depends on whether they are able to
determine the size of the arriving ship...

OK so I\'m not trying to start a flame war or anything but whenever I read,
hear,
touch, or smell the word tachyon as an explanation for something in scifi I
want
to scream. The thing about tachyons is that they don\'t interact with normal
mater
so even if they do exist we\'ll never know it.

Having said that an idea on how to get the pc\'s to land on a regular basis
has
just hit me. This is based on the description of the air filter problems on
the type S
scout from Suplement 7.

The air/water recycling that takes place on a starship has a limited
cappacity
to work after a short period of time, Say 1 month with single occupancy
two weeks or so with double occupancy. After that time The air begins to
stink to
high heaven and the recycled water begins to taste like it\'s primary source
material.

These problems get worse as time goes by with stench building upon stench
untill
it becomes unbearable. Simply opening the locks to a breathable atmosphere
for a day or two and flushing the recyc mechanisms will solve the problem
in most cases.

You can increase comfort endurance by providing extra stateroom equivalents
at 1
person/month per SR, or alternatively overcrowd on a short term basis with
the
smell starting almost imediately.

There are no doubt Realworld problems with this approach but I think it\'s
pretty good as handwaves go.

Lets see. In the book the slippers were silver, so that
ties in with the free silver movement. But the allegories don\'t stop there.
The tin woodsman looking for a heart
seems like an obvious stand in for the industrialists of the time. The
cowardly lion, skilled at picking on the small and weak but afraid of a real
fight seems to be saying something about the US military of the time. (We\'d
just got through with the spanish american war and at the time were involved
in a resonably brutal little war to pacify the philipines.) The scarecrow
looking for a brain could very well have to do with the grange movement. I
can\'t remember who the president was at the time but I\'m willing to bet that
the populist movement viewed him as a talentless blowhard ala the wizard.
Dorothy is just some snot nosed kid from  kansas.

In other childrens book ramblings most of the Dr. Seuss books have political
subtexts to them as well.
Most notably The Lorax, Horton Hears a Who, and The 500 Hats of Bartholomew
Cubbins (sp?).

The Mother goose nursery rhymes are also said to be originally of a
political bent, but the only paralells I can find are possibly, Peter, Peter
Pumpkin Eater = Peter the Great, and George III = Humpty Dumpty

OK my OB Trav is this

The PC\'s have a hold full of childrens books to unload on a high Law world.

1) Unfortunately they are deemed "subversive" by the repressive world
government leading to perhaps serious consequences.

2) They know the books are political tracts in disguise because they\'ve been
hired by the local liberation movement to import them. The trick here is to
get them passed the customs officials looking for same.

3) The same adventure hooks as have been suggested for the poet patron on
another thread will probably work too.

Yeah, well the Japanese don\'t eat cheese. So statistically, you could argue
that we should give up cheese!

Correlation is not causation and all that.

Kiri can correct me if I\'m wrong, but my Japanese friends tell me that
Japan has a much higher level of social control than America. Leave your
trash can out of place on the curb and the "trash lady" comes to warn you.
Keep doing it and the neighbourhood reacts. This factor should be taken
into account.

Your argument makes sense only if you can show a connection between
cheese and violence in the first place. If you\'re going to post arguments,
please at least try to make them intelligent ones. Not to mention, relevant
ones.

Okay, how about an example closer to home? Canadians watch the same 
violent TV and movies that Americans do. Canada\'s level of social control
is for the most part the same as what one finds in the USA. On the other
hand, Canada\'s violent crime rate is a small fraction of the USA\'s.

Another big tool out there is 3d Studio Max (currently release 
3).  Unfortunately, this is a tool in LightWave\'s league, as it goes for 
about $3000, plus another $2000 or so for character studio.  While fairly 
easy to learn (at least the basics) and _extremely_ powerful, it is out of 
reach for most people.  Projects I\'m aware of that were done in 3dsm 
include the cut scenes from Starcraft and Brood War, as well as the 
entirety of either "Bug\'s Life" or "Antz", I never remember which.

You are the most realistic person I\'ve seen. Remember that characters
generally get one or two skills per term.
initial term of service (18-21): 2 skills
every other term (22-whatever/4): 1 skill
on promotion (you define this): 1 skill
on commission (you define this): 1 skill

[I thought I lost Book 3 there for a minute, I search my headboard
(great place for Traveller material) and found Book 6 and
"The Joyful Christian" (sorry if I resemble the xtian remarks of
another thread. I don\'t spam or throw bombs. That would be immoral.)
Anyway, when I put Book 6 back, there was Book 3, between 5 & 7]

It turns out to be Book 2, Starships (of course), that describes
Experience/Self Improvement (page 40).

"... the character devotes himself to a four-year program of self
improvement, dedicating his endeavors in something like an
obsession..."

Education: You may raise EDU by 1 or 2 points every year via night
school / correspondence courses, up to a maximum of 6 points per 4
years. You may not do this unless EDU is lower than INT.

Additionally, you may take a 4 year sabbatical (going back to college,
or technical school, and get a non-weapon skill at level 2.

A character can also make temporarily increase his skill by devoting
himself to it for a 4-year period. You must have skill level 1/2 at least
to do this. At the end of a four year period the skill reverts back to
its original level unless the obsession continues for another four years.
You can choose any two skills. If they are weapon skills, one gun and
one blade may be chosen.

You can also enter an exercise program and increase the first three stats.

Sorry for the verbosity, but this is the really watered down version.

Anyway, I figure that because I am completely immersed in computers (I
think I would have to make a roll against obsession (and not have the
neat job I have) to stop it) I gave myself a higher level. I\'ve gotten
two or three promotions (as my boss defines it), and no commissions
(Promotion to Programming Manager? No thanks.) which I would probably
get admin-1 for.

Yes, even then you know the local squire/mill owner, who hob-nobs with
aristo\'s who in turn hob-nob with higher nobles, who know the king who knows
kings/ambassadors of other counties. Then just go down the other way. You\'re
still only 6-7 step away from almost any one in a \'civilised\' country.

Canada also has a much smaller population, which is a bit less diverse than
ours, and far less concentrated.  They also don\'t get hellish summers,
which has a stastisical effect on violent crime.  We also have a cultural
tradition of violence.  Look at our heroes, ferpete\'ssake!

Perversely, an Uzi would probably not pose you a problem - the safety is

Not to start *that* debate, but computer games are about as close to

I don\'t think that\'s it, either.  I believe in the Second Amendment, I think
that in America, it\'s necessary.  The type of government oppression that it
was designed to forestall would be resisted differently in Japan-- and in
Japan, you don\'t have people living so far away from one another that by the
time the police arrive, the females in the house have been raped, the
valuables taken, and possibly the males have been killed.  There are still
fairly big stretches of America, growing with rural depopulation and the
rise of factory farming, where this is the case.

The Japanese didn\'t eat cheese fifty years ago.  The Japanese eat cheese
whenever they feel like it, now.  I\'ve been to Japan, I\'m rather familiar
with the place, McDonalds puts cheese on the burgers there, too.  The
Japanese eat everything that Americans eat, unless they personally dislike a
certain food or have allergies/intolerances, plus everything that they have
always eaten.  Americans are the only people in the world who are really
finicky about funny looking food; we go to other countries and eat our own
food, as a general rule, and unless you live in a really large city, the
food in American "ethnic" restaurants is usually substantially different
from what you\'d get in the country of origin.

I don\'t recall if I ate cheese or not the last time that I was in Japan, but
I\'m pretty sure that I did, because my favorite breakfast to eat over there
consists of the Japanese version of British tea sandwiches and a large glass
of iced tea with sugar syrup in it.  (Yeah, I ate that every day at Comic
Market...)

It depends upon what you consider annoying.  Hiroshi prefers the United
States but that has a lot to do with the nature of his ambitions and the
fact that he wasn\'t real happy growing up (I wouldn\'t go back to my home
town on a bet, either.)  Many Japanese don\'t want to go back to Japan
because they think that it is too much trouble to keep up the outward
appearances that are expected over there.  I rather like that sort of thing,
and appreciate the fact that you can be as strange, kinky, and weird as you
want to be so long as you have your trash can in the right place and don\'t
force other people to participate in your weirdness as observers.

>
What, you like it that people leave their trash cans all over the place, no
matter what everyone else does?  <g>

I think there\'s a high level of social control in AMERICA.  Total strangers
will come up to you and tell you that you shouldn\'t smoke, you\'re too fat to
eat this or that, God help you if you\'re pregnant and you dare to eat
anything in public because someone will have an opinion about it...
Complete outsiders will comment on your clothing, break into your quiet
conversation about a relationship problem to tell you to "Dump the
bastard!", or dump all their problems on you.

People walk right up to you and ask you to change your religion, and they\'re
not respectful about it either.  I\'ve been asked really rude questions by
people I had never seen before about pentacles, prayer beads, etc.  People
stand outside of clinics and shout at you about medical procedures they
disapprove of.

And yet... you can leave your trash can right out in the damn street where
someone could trip over it and break their neck, and no one cares.

The Japanese will pretend not to notice any behavior that isn\'t obtrusive
enough to upset people.  It\'s a skill learned from living in close quarters
for thousands of years.  They may go home and laugh about you to all of
their friends, but you won\'t know about it.

I\'d much rather have people tell me that I need to keep my trash can in the
appropriate place (and keep theirs in the appropriate place) than have
people giving me crap about who comes into and out of my apartment and how
late they stay, or telling me ON THE STREET that I\'m too big to eat this or
that, or giving me unsolicited advice about my personal life, or regaling
everyone on public transit with the details of their drug habit/sexual
affairs/etc., or shoving tracts in my face and inquiring after my soul,
which is probably the most personal thing I can think of....

See, it\'s all how you look at it...  It was very refreshing, on New Years
Morning when we all went to the shrines to get right with the kami, say hi
to Buddha, and make our New Year\'s resolutions to ourselves and our
ancestors, to see that everyone thought the small group of Americans (and a
very few Japanese) who were standing outside the shrines yelling at us that
we needed to change our religion were all nuts, and that they had to stay so
far away from the doors and couldn\'t get up in our faces.

In general, when I\'ve been in Japan, I have felt that total strangers were
much less likely to try and interfere with my behavior than they are here in
America.  If you do something obnoxious in public over there, people just
pretend you don\'t exist.  I think that\'s a more effective way to get people
to change what they do than giving them crap.

This makes me feel that there are more good points to New Zealand than 
I realised - aside from a very few anti-abortionists outside clinics 
this sort of thing only happens to politicians, and recent events 
suggest that the protesters are more at risk from the politicians than 
vice versa.

The "physics" of Alderson Dives were worked out in detail by Dan Alderson
from CalTech to Jerry\'s requirements , as well as how to locate Alderson
points, and this was all explained in one of Jerry\'s articles in Galaxy,
"Building the Mote In God\'s Eye" which was later republished in the
collection "A Step Further Out", which in itself is a wonderful quick
reference for all sorts of Travelleresque stuff.

I could reproduce some of the details here if anyone is interested.

For instance, there\'s an article all about how getting out of the gravuity
well of Earth is "Halfway to Anywhere", and another on why "Those pesky
Belters and their Torch Ships" won\'t happen, and one on "Living in the
Asteroids" with all the figures for delta-V betwen planets and time taken at
various specific impulses all worked out for you in nice little tables.

It also has some wonderful arficles debunking the "Club of Rome\'s" dire
predictions "Survival with Style" , "A Blueprint for Survival", and one of
he first accessible description of  Stephen Hawking\'s work on black
holes."Gravity Waves, Black Holes, & Cosmic Censors"

Larry Niven seemed fine with other people writing in the "Known Universe",
there are quite a lot of people who have written "Known Univere" stories,
and authors in general aren\'t heavily into "licensing" their universes, they
are normally flattered if you ask to write something in their settiing, and
are really only concerned with whether you voiolate their idea of what the
universe is like, which usually means they ask for veto rights on
publication or at least some sort of editorial control..

There is nothing _illegal_ in people so doing .

Advertising or distributing it _might_ be preventable, but only if the
copyright holder pursues it, it\'s not specifically illegal, and it is up to
the holder of any rights to pursue and enforce them.

In fact, one can reuse someone\'s ideas without permission, because copyright
only covers the actual words in the book, _not_ ideas.

Of course, we should be polite and ask for permission anyway.

tend to have the highest murder rates.  Washington DC & New York City are

Your argument makes sense only if you can show a connection between

please at least try to make them intelligent ones. Not to mention, relevant

Okay, how about an example closer to home? Canadians watch the same
violent TV and movies that Americans do. Canada\'s level of social control
is for the most part the same as what one finds in the USA. On the other
hand, Canada\'s violent crime rate is a small fraction of the USA\'s.

A city of 750,000 people, such as the one I live in, is still a city of
750,000 people. And I\'m not sure one can claim less diversity anymore up
here.

> They also don\'t get hellish summers,

The summer weather in Canada\'s largest city, Toronto, is about the
same as that of Detroit and Buffalo, and not too different from
Chicago, maybe a tad cooler than Washington DC (but not a lot). Yet
its violent crime rate is a fraction of any of these.

>which has a stastisical effect on violent crime.  We also have a cultural

True enough. A lot of the difference can be attributed to some of the
differences in our respective histories. (Eg, civil rights and the
black population -- Canada is where the Underground Railroad brought
the escaped slaves, for instance.) Something for those who perceive
Canada as an extension of the USA to think about. :)

This is also the case in Canada (ie, low population density) -- in fact,
it\'s probably more so here than south of the border. Yet we don\'t have 
- -- or need -- anything like the Second Amendment, since our violent crime 
rate is lower. The question is, is our crime rate lower because we have
fewer guns, or do Americans have more guns because their crime rate is
higher? Chicken, or egg? :)

Reminds me of the time I was eating a burger at a local mall fast-food
court and was accosted by a vegetarian animal-rights fanatic about my
choice of food. (It\'s a good thing that the mall security came by and
kicked him out, as I was giving serious thought to the idea of force-
feeding the rest of my burger to the guy...)

ObTrav: Do the K\'kree send anti-carnivore propaganda into the buffer

I hate it when people do that. Sometimes they come by my house and ring
the doorbell -- I\'ve taken to closing the door in their faces without
comment... I don\'t go around telling people to give up their religions and
become an athiest, and expect the same courtesy from others...

(I\'m suddenly reminded of a scene from -- I think -- the movie "Airplane",
where the hero is accosted one by one in turn by several different religious
types in the airport, which he deals with in an increasingly violent
manner...)

And we\'re not allowed to carry flamethrowers in public to deal with them
either...

ObTrav again: do Imperial starports get the religious missionary types
in them like the stereotypical American airports do?

I believe there was something about transplanting Kzin to the

If that is the same universe containing Ringworld, it\'s already been a

Ringworld and the Smoke Ring are in Larry Niven\'s Known Universe. The
Codominion is in a separate universe. I like them both but they don\'t
really go together.

Sorry to jump in here, but I\'m a hopeless compulsive when it comes to
constitutional debates.  The "right to bear arms" has little to do with
crime rates, so your chicken vs. egg analogy has no bearing.  The right to
defend oneself against any threat is a basic human right.  Having the right
to bear arms and actually owning a gun are separate parts of the equation.
Separate, too, is the question of gun crime vs. other violent crimes.  The
reason there are more gun crimes in the US may be related to the fact that
there are more guns.  But the fact is, guns or no guns, there is more crime
in the US.  Probably has something to do with enforcing laws.  It takes only
a few days and very little money to make laws here, currently.  Enforcement
is much harder, more costly and more time consuming.  There are many other
social and cultural differences, as well.

ObTrav: The duke brokered a complete disarmament of both sides in a
world-wide skirmish on Podunk/Backwater many years ago.  Today the natives
are renowned for their stealth and hand-to-hand combat skills.  It is said
that you should never offer your hand in greeting to a Podunkian if you want
it back.

Reminds me of the time a militant vegetarian made the mistake of 
assuming the Goths of alt.gothic were necessarily left-wing animal
rights nuts.  Heh.  Funny thread that wound up with everyone listing
their favorite steak houses and how they liked their steaks. And 
when the goth hunters chimed in with hunting techniques...  Oy.

Alt.g was also about half-and-half gun control nuts and 2nd Amendment
fanatics--seems that many persons-in-black like to be able defend
themselves from creeps who think its okay to beat up and abuse someone
just because they are of a fringe minority.

In my experience, you cut the legs out from under animal-rights
nuts\' arguments when you just grin and say, "So? I *LIKE* killing
and eating my own food".  This torpedoes their appeals to your
compassion and humanity towards their little furry friends...
(So much the better if you can then talk authoritatively about
which rounds and loads to use on different kinds of game.)
Then do a Ted Nugent and asking them about the leather shoes
they are wearing or the leather purse they are carrying.

And listening to Dr. Laura, I heard her give a biblical 
argument to a militant vegetarian once: she pointed out 
that God Himself authorized humans to eat meat after the 
Flood, so what was the caller\'s problem? If God gave it to 
us to eat, who did the caller think he was to say it is wrong?

I don\'t like that approach because it turns people off and 
drives them away from something they might have been drawn to
and gained great benefit from otherwise. (Yes, I\'m Christian.)

Let\'s not go there, as I have diametrically opposed views.
We don\'t need flamethrowing on the TML over abortion.

Heh. I got to agree with you and the other guy. However,
I will refrain from shooting anyone who doesn\'t try to kill
or cause grievous bodily harm to me or my loved ones on that
day.  Heck, I pretty much refrain that way all the time.

Movies would get really boring. Please go read the nearest

must have foes and causes worthy of them.

How \'bout GOOD action movies instead? ;-) I haven\'t seen Starship
Troopers, so I can\'t comment, original Robocop is good, avoid the
sequels, Die Hard 1, 2 AND 3, cool, Terminator 1 & 2, coolest.
Add: True Lies (Arnie again), a few of the more interesting Van

Back in the 80s, Chaosium published the Ringworld RPG, covering Niven\'s
Known Space setting.  Niven was involved in this project, so he knows what
RPGs are.  Unfortunately the game itself didn\'t really take off.  I gather
the licence fees tended to hurt Chaosium\'s profit margins too.

SJG used to have an article on their web pages about using GURPS in the
CoDominium setting.  It doesn\'t seem to be there any more.  It was pretty
short, anyway.

There are plenty of unauthorised GURPS versions of various writers\'
universes floating around the Net.

OK, you got me there.  I suppose it\'s the same processed cheese food
substance that they use here.  I\'ve never had anything other than ice tea
with sugar syrup at a Japanese McD\'s.

Not a big McD\'s fan here.  I still remember arguing with my ex-BF Tashiro,
then a student at Tsukuba-dai (the biggest science university in Japan):  "I
did NOT come all the way across the Pacific to eat at McD\'s!  Let\'s go to
Cafe Mozart, this is my vacation, I wanna take *you* out!"


LOL...

I often wonder what became of that guy.  He was the lead singer of a metal
band and they used to dress up in sentai (Power Ranger) type costumes for
their shows.  He was such a hoot and I adored him, but it wasn\'t meant to
be.

No, I guess they don\'t put cheese on the McD\'s burgers, but they do put
cream cheese in the tea sandwiches and cheddar cheese in those little yummy
buns from the Pronto coffee shops (like a Japanese version of Starbucks only
2000 percent better food and coffee and they don\'t give you evil looks when
you ask where the restroom is)-- and at night it turns into a bar!

I love Tokyo but I do occasionally get strange looks in further outlying
places.  It\'s different because I am part-Asian but not necessarily
recognizably so...?  When I travel with my friends the Tanakas, (he\'s
Japanese, she\'s white, two kids) people think I am part of the family but
can\'t figure out quite how-- I look like Natsumi and Marie, but Darla and
Takashi aren\'t old enough to be my parents.  I have very long straight black
hair but very white skin and dark eyes (I\'m often mistaken for a Latina) and
what I tend to get is the bugawk effect, so named because I blend into the
crowd, and then someone comes up to tell me that my backpack came unzipped
or something like that, I turn around and they see that my eyes are missing
a fold and they look like they\'re about to go "bugawk"!  Then they decide to
speak English, even if they can\'t.

And then I very calmly have to say "nihongo de douzo, yoku wakarimashita yo
(speak Japanese, I understood you just fine)."  I really wonder what it is
like to be a white European non-English speaking tourist in Japan.  They
think all white people speak English.  And not Japanese.

LOL.  I guess if you were travelling among the Vilani, and spoke Vilani, and
looked almost-but-not-quite Vilani, you\'d get the bugawk reaction too.

Bugawk!

OTOH, 90% of Americans hear and say my name as "Carrie/Kerry/Keri" no matter
how many times I correct them.  (It means "fog".)

This has gotten Hiroshi in trouble.  "Carrie called me?  Who\'s THAT?"

Your choice.  My point is very simple.  I do not go and stand outside of
your church on Easter and tell you to get right with your ancestors...  I do
not exhort the virtues of the kami or the buddhas to people who are not
interested... and hence, I request the same courtesy.  I was raised by a
white adoptive family in West Virginia and if I were going to become a
Christian I would have done so already by now.  But you have a valid point.

My point was that it\'s not a political issue outside of the US.  This kind
of protest doesn\'t happen in Japan.  People who are opposed to abortion
don\'t have abortions and leave other people alone.  I don\'t think people who
yell at you or throw paint around outside of abortion clinics or fur stores
should be attacked with flamethrowers.  I do think that they should be
arrested for trespassing if they set one foot on the property and that if
they become loud, unruly, or physically threaten/approach/taunt/touch people
as they enter or leave, they should be arrested for assault (and battery, if
they actually touched anyone).  It amazes me that people don\'t use the laws
that already exist to deal with either abortion or animal rights protestors
at their place of business.

But no, I don\'t think anyone needs to have a flamethrower aimed at them.  If
people want to sit around outside and pray, there is not much that can be
said or done-- it just doesn\'t happen in Japan, is all, because the culture
is different.  When they yell at people, interpose their bodies, etc. they
are legally committing assault.

Given that many worlds, nations and coperations  have their own script, I would
argue that currency dealing is a way of life. Given that we are going to the
Sword world, I would argue that the Imperial Credit is an in-demand currency, as
most of the goods that the SW need (weapons) atre Imperially sourced. Given the
rampant lasie faire economics of Traveller, Each SW would have a currency
exchange mechanism not unlike what we have here.

For more fun (tm), you could have the SW impound imperial scripts, or make them
illegal to use. It really depends on how evil the GM feels (Hi Cory!).

FYI: The party is a bunch of motley mercs with cutting edge weaponry (an orbital

Many years ago Niven allowed someone to put out a Ringworld RPG. It didn\'t
last long due to lack of interest.

<Digs in home library>

Okay, Chaosium Inc. did the RPG. Also, there are some universe designing
notes in N-Space by Larry Niven where he talks about some of the properties
of the Alderson Drive. It\'s a long to type up but I could if there is a
massive outpouring of demand for it.

At the risk of starting a system war, I\'d say GURPS would handle the whole
setting almost effortlessly.  Like Leading Edge, it\'s a reasonably
realistic system as befits the decidedly realistic feel of Pournelle\'s
books.  And GURPS already has the rules in place to handle the appropriate
technology.  I just picked up Space 3rd Edition, and I think that one could
model the space travel tech used in the CoDominium/MiGE universe with
almost no effort (Jump Drive for Alderson Drive, and a moderately powerful
total conversion drive for the real-space drive.  Further, the default
force screens in GURPS are obviously modeled on the Langston Field (Slow
objects can pass through, beams and fast objects are deflected.  Screens
accumulate energy levels when hit, glowing in different colors as the
levels increase.  Powerful attacks can "blow through" the screen without
destroying it. Etc.)

    Sorry, but look at Leading Edge Games Living Steel and/or Aliens would
fight the world better, sorry, but Gurps is not reasonably realistic.  Ye
gods man, you have to roll dice to be able to blow your nose in GURPs, & if
you do not have the right skills, you might pull off you own nose.

Notice the next line in my original post (which you didn\'t copy):
correlation is not causation.

I was trying to sarcastically point out that a causal mechanism was needed,

Yup. One of the vignettes on Canadian TV has the RCMP officer in charge of
the Yukon (Steele, I believe) facing down an American who\'s come in with
gambling gear. Eventually the Yankee goes home, muttering "I coulda shot
him."

Look at the Klondike Gold Rush to see a good example of Canadian attitudes.
Anyone entering the country had to show that they had enough food and
supplies (thus reducing the temptation to survive by theft), strong drink
and gambling were strictly controlled, and the Mounties had a great deal of
lattitude in how they interpretted "disorderly behaviour".  Murders and
theft were few and far between, and no one seemed particularly worried that
they were being deprived of fundamental liberties.

America was founded on "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness";
Canada on "peace, order, and good government."

Larry Niven was involved in writing a script for the Star Trek _animated_
series (TOS characters) that involved the ST crew fighting some Kzin for
possession of a Slaver weapon

I\'m not surprsised he didn\'t like it, it was pretty bad.

Considering that it was *Niven* who did so, I doubt it. 

He re-wrote "The Soft Weapon" into the Animated Star Trek episode "The
Slaver Weapon" (with Spock replacing the Puppeteer!)

The one thing that Niven got *really* POed about was Elf Sternberg
writing a story involving kinky Kzinti.

No, different universes.  Mote in God\'s Eye is in the universe with
King David\'s Spaceship and Falkenberg\'s Legion.  It\'s mainly
Pournelle\'s playground where he told us his "Christian Johnny"
stories.  MiGE is set during the second empire era..I think...which
puts it several thousand years in the future.  Mankind has spread to
thousands of stars, had an empire collapse, gone through a "long
night" and now a second empire is reestablishing itself. 

Ringworld is in Niven\'s "Known Space" universe with Beowolf Shaffer,
the Kzin, Protectors and the Puppeteers.  The War World series about
the Saurens is set here...right?

Smoke Ring, *might* be in set in Known Space, but I don\'t think it
is. There was a sequel to The Smoke Ring a few years ago, IIRC.

Of course, the problem with taking Book 1 as your guide is that senior
NCOs (such as myself) are given only one skill per term of service after
the first.  <tongue-in-cheek> After all, Sergenat Major Calvin never
received a commission, therefore he _obviously_ didn\'t learn
anything.... </tongue-in-cheek>

Anyway, our (currently on hiatus) campaign uses T4, which gives credit
for background skills, as well as providing skills nearly on a par with
Books 4 and 5.

I\'ll put this on the stove, albeit on the back burner (college and Rob
Prior\'s grading situation being on the front burners).  I should have
something in the next week, to demonstrate the possible skills of a
senior combat support (Military Intelligence branch) NCO.

The Saurons are an extension of the CoDo setting (note that the WarWorld
series deals heavily with the former CoDo world of Haven, and that there
is at least one Sauron story [sadly, I don\'t have it ready-to-hand, so I
don\'t have the title ready] set on the CoDo prison world of Tanith).

The Kzin, OTOH, are a part of Niven\'s "Known Space" stories, as opposed
to Pournelle\'s CoDo and beyond stories.

_The Mote in God\'s Eye_ _is_ an extension of the CoDo/First Empire
future history.

The air/water recycling that takes place on a starship has a limited
cappacity to work after a short period of time, Say 1 month with single 
occupancy two weeks or so with double occupancy. After that time
The air begins to stink to high heaven and the recycled water begins to 
taste like it\'s primary source material.

These problems get worse as time goes by with stench building upon 
stench untill it becomes unbearable. Simply opening the locks to a

This would limit travel to uninhabited star systems quite a bit - 
remember, most star systems don\'t feature planets with naturally
breathable atmospheres, most of this "opening the locks to a
breathable atmosphere" will be done in someone else\'s docking bay.
Say a starbase, or domed city, either of which may be a large 
enough facility to support an advanced recyc system (and would
require such a system anyway).

If you could accurately determine when the ship is due, intersecting
that location at that time with a good sized mass shouldn\'t be a 
problem, in a TU with the standard "magic carpet" maneuver drives.

If you can\'t quite tell when to expect the incoming, it\'ll get trickier.
How is the jumpspace phenomena known as an incoming ship
moving with relation to the star system? Does it even have a 
corresponding realspace location that one can resolve to intercept,
or does it\'s location only make sense in terms of jumpspace
navigation?

Jump space, the final frontier... :-)

I really don\'t want to get in a pissing match about systems today.  But
that\'s about the least informed criticism of GURPS that I ever heard.  I\'ll
take GURPS\' wide skill set over Leading Edges ballistic model masquerading
as a game system any day.  (And yes, I\'ve played Living Steel, or at least
tried.)    IMO, any system that wants me to count the number of screws in a
gadget I want to build is not playable (Living Steel).

I can\'t help but think that it wouldn\'t be that bad in the far future, as it

    'body' => 'OK, as a couple of people requested it, here\'s the description of how the
Alderson drive works from Pournelle\'s "Galaxy" article

/*******************

"The most important technological features of the [Second] Empire were
previously published in other stories : the Alderson drive and the Langston
Field.

The Alderson drive is consistent with everything prfesently known about
physics [at the time of writing-frankie]. It merely assumes that additional
discoveries will be made in about thirty years at CalTech ( as a tip o\' the
hat to Dan Alderson). The key event is the detection of a "fifth force"

There are four known forces inmodern physics: two sub-nuclear forces
responsiible respectively for alpha and beta decay; electromagnetism, which
includes light; and gravity. The Alderson force then, is the fifth, and it
is generated by thermonuclear reactions.

The force has little effect on our universe; in fact it is barely
detectable. simultaneous wit the discovery of the fifth force, however, we
postulate the discovery of a second universe in point-to-point congruence
with our own. The "continuum universe" differs from the one we\'re used to in
tat there are no known quantum effects there.

Within that universe particles may travel as fast as they cn be accelerated;
and the fifth force exists to accelerate them.

You cna get from one universe to another. For every particle in our universe
there can be created a "correspondence particle" in the continuum universe.
In order for your constrct to go into and emerge fromthe continuum universe
without change you must have som complex machinery to hold everything
together and prevent your ship - nd crew - from being disorganized into
elementary particles.

Corespondence particles can be boosted to speeds faster than light : in
fact, to speeds nearly infinite as we measure them. Of course they cannot
emerge into our universe at such speeds: they have to lose their energy to
emerge at all. More on that in a moment.

There ae severe conditions to entering and leaving the continuum universe.
to emerge from the continuum universe you must exit with precisely the same
potential energy (measured in terms of the fifth force, not gravity) as you
entered. You must also have zero kinetic energy relative to a complex set of
coordinates that we won\'t discuss here. [note, I\'m not sure if this is just
a handwave to avoid relativity, or if they really did come up with some set
of coordinates - frankie]

The fifth force is created by thermonuclear reactions: generally, that is,
in stars. You may travel by usuing it, but only along precisely defined
lines of equipotential flux: tramways or tramlines.

Imagine the universe as athin rubber sheet, very flat. Now drop heavy rocks
of different weights onto it. The rocks will distort the sheet, making
little cone -shaped (more or less) dimples. Now put two rocks reasonably
close together: the dimples will interesect in a valley. The intersection
will have a "pass", a region higher than the low points where the rocks
(stars) lie, but lower than the general level of the rubber sheet.

The route from one star to another through that "pass" is the tramline.
Possible tramlines lie between each two stars, but they don\'t always exist,
because when you add third and fourth stars to the system they may
interfere, so there is no unique gradient line. If this seems  confusing ,
don\'t spend a lot of tinme worrying about it; we\'ll get to the effects of
all this in a moment.

You may also imahgine stars to be like hills; move another star closer and
the hills will intersect. Again, from summit to summit there will be one and
only one line that preserves the maximum potential energy for hat level.
Release a marble on oine hill and it will roll down, across the saddle, and
up the other. That too is a tramline effect. It\'s generally easier to think
of the system as valleys rather than hills, because to travel from star to
star you have to get over the "hump" between the two. The fifth force
provides energy for that.

You enter from the quantum universe. when you travel in the continuum
universe you continually lose kineti energy; it "leaks." This can be
detected in our universe as photons. The effect can be important during a
space battle. we cut such a space battle from MOTE, but it still exists, and
we may yet publish it as a novella.

To get from the uantum to the continuum universe you must supply power, and
this is available only in quantum terms. when you do this you turn yourself
into a correspondence paeticle; go across the tramline; and come out at a
point on the other side where your potential energy is equal to what you
entered with, plus zero kinetic energy (in terms of the fifth force and
comples reference axes [ there\'s that handwave again - frankie])

For those bored by the last few paragraphs, take heart; we\'ll leave the
technical details and get on with what it all means.

Travel by Alderson Drive consists of getting to the proper Alderson Point
and turning on the Drive [ Note that the "technical" description implies
there is a continuous "line" of such points between each pair of stars, but
that seems to be ignored here - frankie]
Energy is used. You vanish, to reappear in an immeasurably short time at the
Alderson Point in another star system some light years away. If you haven\'t
done everything right, or aren\'t at the Alderson Point, you turn on your
drive and a lot of energy vanishes. You don\'t move. (In fact you do move,
but you instantaneously reappear in the spot where you started.)"

/*******************

Jerry goes on to talk about the societal effects of this, very similar to
Traveller, but frankly, after reading through that description it seems to
me there are as many holes in that description as there are in Traveller\'s
jump drive !

Ob-Trav :
Isn\'t it obvious ?

Who said that Jump drivesd are the _only_ means of crossing the space

I suspect that  may be because Pournelle is guilty of a little fibbing ( or
Dan Alderson was, and Jerry didn\'t catch him at it)  when he says it was all
worked out properly.

If you look at the bit I reproduced (posted seperately) you\'ll see where I
note what I think are the points at which the whole explanation falls down.

In the old Star Trek cartoon, the Kzinti did in fact appear (under license

Bans on weapons in an area that has at the same time no restrictions on
movement of people and goods is meaningless. A ban on guns in Washington 
DC is meaningless if people are able to purchase guns in the neighbouring
states of Maryland and Virginia, for example. In NYC, they can cross the
river into New Jersey. Since there are no inter-state border patrols to
prevent people moving goods from one state to another, a ban on guns at
anything less than the national level is of absolutely no use whatsoever.

Note: I am not advocating such a ban (ie, at the national level) since I
don\'t live there in the first place... :)

I recall a BBS back in the mid-80s. The sysop had taken an adventure
game (written in BASIC for his C-64) and modified it to run via his
modem. So you wandered about a house with a front yard (and some rather
bizarre rooms in the back of the building, once you found out how to
get to them). And you could leave notes in any "area" which others
could pick up and read.

I wonder if you could turn this interactive scout ship into a web page?

Nope. Ringworld is part of Niven\'s "Known Space" universe. No
connection with Pournelle\'s CoDominium/Empire universe, which is where
"The Mote in God\'s Eye" is set. 

"Smoke Ring" is set in a different Niven Universe. There are only a
couple of other stories in it. "The State" is a *nasty* place.

Ever read "Dream Park" or the sequel(s?)? If that\'s not role-playing

Smoke Ring isn\'t in "Known Space". It\'s in a different one. Same one as
"Rammer"?

From internal evidence, it\'s set in the same universe as a short story
(I think the title was "Rammer") about a guy who had himself frozen
(corpsicle) and "woke up" to find out that his memories had been
extracted and placed in a condemned criminal\'s body. He\'s then trained
as a pilot for a Bussard Ramjet type ship. Which he proceeds to steal. 

Anyway, the government "The State" in the short story is the same one
that sent the ship that settled the Smoke Ring.

Getting back to the original post that started this thread in the first
place: a plea to have one day of no violence, not even in the media, as
some sort of symbolic gesture. The response was whether violence in the
media was a valid correlation with violence in society. We Canadians watch
the same violent movies and TV shows that you Americans do, but our violent
crime rate is lower. The Japanese watch movies and tv shows etc. that are
even more violent than ours, yet their violent crime rate is lower as well.
The only logical conclusion: there is no correlation between violence in 
the media and violence in society.

So all of those wanna-be do-gooders who think that getting rid of violence
in the media will solve the problem (like the people who are now lobbying
the entertainment industry) are barking up the wrong tree.

We just can\'t decide which is the *right* tree. I know where I stand on
the issue, but I am also willing to concede that the other side of the
argument may have a valid point. In the meantime, I\'m staying on my side
of the 49th parallel, where (for whatever reason) it\'s safer. :)

I don\'t suppose there\'s any more to be said on the issue...

Which approach are you objecting to: their door-to-door salesmanship,
or my just closing the door in their faces? :)

(No offence, but even if they didn\'t come a-knocking, I\'d still be
an athiest. It\'s only a few (Jehovah\'s Witnesses, JC Latter Day Saints,
and a local evangelical church called the Victory Centre) that do the
door-knocking bit -- out of dozens of denominations. I\'ve never seen
Jews or Buddhists go door-knocking...

I know I saw a GURPS treatment of Traveller somewhere before SJG did
it for real. I\'ve also seen GURPS treatments of Star Trek (heck, I once
co-wrote one myself!), Babylon 5, BattleTech, and even Isaac Asimov\'s
Foundation universe.

(What I want to see in GURPS: John DeChancie\'s "Starrigger".)

It\'s pretty bad role-playing, IMO.  It seemed to be a sort of Munchkin
LARPing to me, with no real attempt at playing a character.  For a much
better rendition of future role-playing, try John M. Ford\'s _Growing Up
Weightless_.  Gaming is not really the focus of the story like it is in
_Dream Park_, but the gaming is a lot more compelling to me.  

ObTrav: it\'s John M. Ford, what more do I have to say?

That\'s the right title.  The short was also spun out into a novel called _A
World out of Time_.  Not Niven\'s best work, but interesting ideas.  A lot
of the thinking about Bussard ramjets form "Rammer" shows up in Known Space
as well.

I think the phrase "some sort of symbolic gesture" sums up the one day
of peace pretty well.  It\'s been an internet movement/fad for the last
month.  Well, only about 1/4 of the world has access to the internet (a
good percentage has never made a phone call), so that\'s why I\'d say it\'s
symbolic.  These same people seem to be the ones that are currently
fighting against organized terrorism, for their freedom or national
sovereignty, or to defend the freedom of others.  To me the "One Day of
Peace" seems to come from someone secure in the liberties of free
information and safety that most of the world lives without.  

ObTrav:  Imagine a high population, low tech world where the luxuries
that most Imperial citizens are unknown.  Resources would be expensive,
labor cheap.  Even a good quality starport (say B type) would be run
down.  Off worlders would be hounded by beggars and merchants for their
money.  If it was a balkanized world small wars might be common. 
Rebellions might also be frequent.  The Emperor might be seen by the
common person as evil since he "throws a lot of money around" trying to
influence local affairs; but, several locals would work for Imperial
development programs.

I wasn\'t saying they didn\'t know what it was, just that I\'ve never

Just for the record -- I *was* kidding about the flamethrower... what we
do in Canada is that the clinics get legal restraining orders against
protestors, which the local police have no problem enforcing if the
protestors get too close and/or try to interfere and/or interact with
people entering/leaving the clinic.  Edmonton has a free-standing clinic
of this type -- it\'s been a very long while since anything newsworthy 
took place in its immediate vicinity...

In Japan the acceptable ways to voice opinions that don\'t conform are
more limited.  In Europe pro-life positions are less popular but they
certainly have people conducting such protests for other causes.

>People who are opposed to abortion

Note: Virtually everyone, except the most anarchistic, imposes their
beliefs on others.  I don\'t think anyone here would have the attitude
that people how are opposed to child abuse shouldn\'t just not abuse
children themselves and not try and push their beliefs on others.
Of course the attitude toward child abuse it widely held and has
thus been incorporated into law (so that one doesn\'t need to try
and do it personally).  Similarly, those who first started
protesting the war in Vietnam engaged in similar tactics, should
they have held off even if it prolong American involvement in the
war?

So the question comes down to this.  If you were in a society that
condoned child abuse, would feel the right or duty to do something
to stop it?  If so, then the only difference is in what issues you
see as important.

Society does need to maintain order and the activities of radicals
from a number of causes on both the right and the left cross the
line.  All sides need to obey the law.  But I think the idea that forceful
advocacy is a sign of moral inferiority is going too far.  Some of those
who oppose laws forbidding the peaceful picketing of abortion clinics are
veterans of the sixties who remember when such tactics were used against
them.

Let\'s see... a lot of violent crimes are commited with guns, so the

violent crimes being committed with cheese...

Judaism doesn\'t believe in proselytizing. As a matter of fact, they often 
make conversion very difficult (ask my wife) in order to make sure that the 
person in question is serious about it, and is not doing it for the wrong 
reasons (usually to please a spouse and not for themselves). As an amusing 
sidenote, Hassidic Jews will often proselytize to other less observant or non 
religious Jews to try and bring them back into the fold...I can\'t speak for 
Buddhists...:-)

_Rammer_ was later (I think) expanded into a novel called _A World Out 
of Time_, in which the rammer, named Corbell(?) went back to Earth 3 
million years in the future after wipping around a big black hole in 
the Mikly Way\'s centre. IIRC.

Not only that but Niven was a co-author of the _Dream Park_ series, and 
there was an RPG based on them out.

I pick number 3 - there\'s (little to) no correlation. New Zealand has a 
very high firearms ownership rate (though admitedly not of pistols), 
and our violent crime rate is in the same range as Canada and 
Australia\'s, not the US\'.

I think that the Zero-energy & "complex axes" rules combine to make
only two points along the line possible entry/exit points. 

For example, consider the required "energy level" to be a plane. The
tramline between a pair of stars will only intersect that plane two,
one, or zero times. 

If it intersects twice, you\'ve got a pair of Alderson points. If it
intersects *once* you\'ve got a useless Alderson point (the zero-energy plane
intersects the fifth-force "surface" at the mid point of the saddle).
If it intersects zero times, then all of the saddle is below the zero
point level, and thus, there\'s no usable tramline between those stars.

I also invite everyone to take a gander at my newly rewritten website.

their overall coverage and ability to engage a single target. The models

Bans on weapons in an area that has at the same time no restrictions on
movement of people and goods is meaningless. A ban on guns in Washington
DC is meaningless if people are able to purchase guns in the neighbouring
states of Maryland and Virginia, for example. In NYC, they can cross the
river into New Jersey. Since there are no inter-state border patrols to
prevent people moving goods from one state to another, a ban on guns at
anything less than the national level is of absolutely no use whatsoever.

Note: I am not advocating such a ban (ie, at the national level) since I
don\'t live there in the first place... :)

\'The General War\' ( a 5FFW variant)
Setup:  Known Space 1107
The 3I is the most powerful military, economic and political presence in
known
space. It has recently (in historical terms) defeated the Zhodani in
4FFW, kept
Vargr raiders plus the Aslan Ihatiei at bay, decimated (for practical
purposes) any dramatically serious insurgent movements in Solomani Rim,
and generally has done everything right for itself since 1082.
These objective realities have sunk in to the rest of the major powers
in known
space.... many are jealous of the successes that the 3I has achieved.
Failures in the domestic or interstellar situation of these major powers
cause  groups within them
to lack dignity and self-respect. They look at the 3I and its successes
and they
become embittered, resentful, even enraged. As they see it, the 3I is
being arrogant, rubbing their nose in it, seeking to dominate all of
known space and beyond.

They decide to act. Sometime around 1107, every major power (Zhodani,
Vargr(s), Aslan, Solomani, Hivers, and the K\'kree) prepares to launch a
simultaneous attack
on the 3I with the objective of destroying it forever.

Ref note:  This idea comes from about 50 billion different sources; the
couple I\'m
prepared to cite are Star Fleet Battles and G:T. SFB has a campaign
dubbed \'the
general war\'; G:T doesn\'t mention anything specific (that I\'ve read
anyway, I only
have the basic G:T rules/sourcebook right now) but they do allude to
border conflicts
and tensions. I figure if 3I gets to many off those going without
resolving them quickly
it could get itself in a sticky situation.

And now, on to our questions:
1. Plausibility:
    a. Could they have the means to launch such a war?
        I would say yes; you wouldn\'t need to have specific minute by
minute timetables;
        all you would need is to send some couriers out to each power
notifying them of
        when they need to strike generally (i.e.. have K\'kree battle
fleets hit these 4 sectors
        during this half of the year).
     b. Would they launch such an attack?
        If the conditions were as stated in the first 3 paragraphs, I
would say yes. But hey,
        that\'s what I think. I\'d like to know what you folks think.
2. Rebellion: would it happen or not?
    Depends; if Dulinor goes off and gets himself killed "for the Glory
of the Empire", then
    I suppose not. On the other hand, if the 3I gets messed up badly and
sues for peace,
    you could have a setup like France and Russia went through after
they lost to the
    Germans (in 1871 / 1917 respectively). Did someone say Paris
Commune?
3. Who would win?
    Ahhhh. Now you now why I sent this in. If the whole of known space
went on the
    warpath, who would win? [Crowd, screaming] 2 fleets enter! 1 fleet
leaves!
4. Finally, has anybody else thought about or done something like this
particular
scenario in Traveler?
Give me the Veedback! Feedflack! Oh, whatever.

Actually, no, it was Rodenberry who didn\'t like the Kzin... Larry Niven
Wrote the Kzin into the episodes of ST:The Animated Series he himself
wrote. Rodenberry had no control over ST:TAS... so it was always ignored in
later ST Canon... except by FASA.

He also allowed Task Force Games/Amaraillo Design Bureau to use (and expand
upon) the Kzin, provided mention was made that they were dimension-hopped
out of the known space universe and into the SFB universe prior to human
contact. I do recall that being in one of the SFB items, but I don\'t

A small set of conversion guidelines, as yet incomplete (IE, no vehicles,
weapons, trade and commerce, etc.). With that said, it is essentially
guidelines for character creation in a traveller Millieu using the basis of
the Storyteller Engine (Used by Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, Wraith,
Changeling, Hunters, Streetfighter, (Aeon) Trinity, and Aberrant). When I
get really motivated (IE, have players who won\'t throttle me for this
heresy), I plan on working up the rest of the conversions needed.

However, there have been skimpier conversions from the net that have
worked, so please, see the following URL:

Of Buddhists, to my knowledge only the Nichiren Shoushu and their offshoot,
the Soka Gakkai, proselytize.  They can be very obnoxious about it.
Nichiren was a very militant fellow himself.  I have never, nor will I, ever
said that Christians are the only ones that proselytize obnoxiously.  But
they are the ones I encounter most often.  The Nichiren tend not to knock
out doors, but they are the only non-Christians I\'ve ever seen passing out
tracts.

Yes, I have this book.  Nice cover with the picture of the "Cattail" wrapped

Thats interesting.  I have a supplement for that game, "Ringworld

hard as they usually tend to go for 60 bucks or more.

There was a conversion chart for Imperial credits to \'local\' credits in \'Best 
of JTAS #1\'.  I\'ll chart it out for ya in a sec.

Seems logical to me.

IMTU, PCs usually do currency exchanges at banks just \'outside the wire\' of 
the starport.  \'Inside the wire\', both local and foreign money is ok, though 
the locals tend to not give you a decent exchange rate.  <grin>

> Is the money traded like it is on our <rl> stock markets?

Beats me.  I never *could* figure out currency exchanges.

> Who sets the exchange rates? That is; how do they decide that a Swordworlder
> buck is worth half a credit or whatever?

On \'lawless\' worlds, the banks do.  On medium law worlds, the local gov does. 
 On high law worlds, the local gov does, but you can prolly get a *better* 
deal on the black market.  Just don\'t get caught!  <grin>

The chart:

NOTES:

Imperial Credit is assumed to be a credit from a TL15 Starport A world for
purposes of exchange rates.

To exchange local credits to Imperials, multiply amount by conversion factor.

To exchange Imperials to local credits, *divide* amount by conversion factor.

\'-\' means that there is no planet of this particular starport and tech level
combination.

\'bart\' means there is no meaningful basis of exchange with this planet. 
Referees should determine the details of such a situation.

SERVICES:

Starport services are generally availiable at the local currency rate, including
costs for refueling, life support recharges, and berthing costs.  Maintanance is
also availiable at local costs *unless* the maintanance is done on a ship more
advanced than the local tech level could normally produce.  Example:  A TL12
ship lands at a TL9 class B starport for servicing.  Maintanance costs would be
paid as if the ship was instead on a TL12 class B starport planet.

BLACK MARKETS:

Sometimes governments set different rates of exchanges when exchanging
Imperials to local credits.  For instance, a planet having the \'normal\'
exchange rate of .40 might set the official exchange rate at .45 or .50 and
pocket the difference.  Changing local credits back to Imperials, you\'d use the
\'normal\' exchange rate of .40.  Unless of course, you go to the black market. 
<grin>  PCs can contact the black market in the usual ways, i.e., using
Streetwise skills.  How vigorously the local government suppresses the black
market depends on local law level, of course...

Well, Ringworld is part of the Known Universe series. The Smoke Ring is
a different series, whose name escapes me, but includes World Out Of

It\'s hard to see, but it looks like there\'s a sliding door on the aft
bulkhead.  The line there is thinner than the bulkhead it\'s attached to.

 Secondly,

Fuel tankage. The iris valves behind the access panel presumably represents
an occasional access for cleaning the tanks and for damage control in
emergencies.

Fuel scoops.  The circle is probably part of the purification plant.

Don\'t know of one, although I\'ve been telling SJG that the absence of a
detailed key in the early books is really an errata that should be fixed. 
The good news is that they\'re getting better.  Newer books finally have
numbered keys to the deckplans.

That episode was a rehash of a story he wrote called The Soft Weapon. In
it a puppeteer and several humans assume the roles that the Star Trek
characters had in the cartoon.

The original story isn\'t bad, INHO, but the cartoon is stupid, because
it violates Star Trek canon like no other story. You have Slavers,
statis boxes, Kzin ...

In my univerese, there is a small-but-persistant sect called the 
Psychohistorians (most refer to them as Psychos). They hang around starport 
terminals, with shaved heads and saffron robes, chanting:

"Hari Seldon, Hari Seldon

That\'s fuel tankage.. the black lines are baffles.  Normally, going into a
fuel tank with fuel in it is instant death, but you could go in when the
tanks are empty for maintenance.

Those are the fuel scoops.  The big pill-looking thing is just part of the
generic machinery floorplan.

As far as I can tell, "Rammer" and the two Smoke Ring novels are in the

are any others.

Since when does yelling and throwing paint contstitute "peaceful picketing"?
If all the protestors do is stand around outside with their signs and
draw attention to themselves, I have no problem with that. The minute they
start harassing others and/or try to interfere with people trying to get
into the clinic, they are no longer engaged in "peaceful picketing".

When I was with the MFO in Sinai during the summers of 1986 and 1987, I
would go on pass to Eilat, Israel.  Buses arrived in Eilat from South
Camp at about noon every Friday.  Black market moneychangers would meet
the bus, and offer an exchange rate of (IIRC) 3.80 or 3.85 New Israeli
Shekels (NIS) per dollar.  The official exchange rate was NIS 3.70  to
NIS 3.75 per dollar.  Local shops, restaurants, and (most important to
young GIs) bars would accept dollars, but would usually round down to
NIS 3.50 per dollar.

ObTrav:  Replace NIS and dollar with local currency and Imperial
Credits, and you have a textbook example of the utility and limits of
Imperial Credits in a non-Imperial society.

In canon terms...not likely at all.

We have the following major polities: The 3I, Zho Consulate, Aslan (more or
less...the Heirate is the largest single political entity) The Vargr Rabble
(all 3,567.5 different political states in the Extents ;-), the Julian
Protectorate, the K\'Kree 2000 worlds, the Hivers, and the Solomani Confederation.

1)The Zhodani used the Frontier wars to keep the 3I at bay, more or less; they
never intended to _destroy_ the 3I, it serves as far too valuable a buffer
between them and the other intrestellar polities to rimward. The Frontier Wars
were _all_ feints on the part of the Zho\'s. They don\'t feel embittered or
resentful at all, quite the opposite. I\'ll bet the nobles on Zdant who
orchestrated the Frontier wars are pretty damn smug, in point of fact.

2)The Solomani Confederation fought the 3I to a standstill over the occupation
of Terra in the SRW. BOTH sides pretty much wore out over that one, and the
Solomani are busy rebuilding in their further rimward states, probably
struggling through serious economic problems. In the event of something
happening in the 3I, as in the Rebellion, they\'ll be back in there like
chickens on a June bug. The Solomani lost because they adopted particularly
inflexible tactics, and got spread too thinly.

3)The Vargr could never be expected to all work together...and if any of them
knew about the forthcoming attack, they would never be able to keep the secret.

4)The Julian Protectorate is the weakest of the several groups involved.
They\'ve enjoyed peace with the 3I for centuries, and have no reason to want
war with them at all.

5)Nobody trusts the K\'Kree, and with good reason....they tend to be genocidal
maniacs against you if anyone on your side likes to eat meat. If the K\'Kree
are in, count the Vargr, Aslan and Hivers, at the very least, out.

6)The Hivers wouldn\'t do it this way...they\'d manipulate the 3I to fall of
it\'s own accord...much bigger bragging rights doing it that way than
straightforward conquest. They also would not ally with the K\'Kree, or the
K\'Kree with them.

7)The Aslan would consider it utterly dishonorable, as it would mean
unilaterally breaking the treaty of Ftahir. The \'ihatei\' were never _that_
much of a threat...they are not reaving fleets bent on conquest. Most \'ihatei\'
invasions are far more like many immigrant groups in various parts of the
world. They buy or rent a bit of land, set up shops, work their butts off,
shop at each others stores, loan each other money, buy land, start taking over
certain industries, sponsor more of their members to the communities, and
soon, they\'re into the power structure, and they can buy more land, bring in
more ihatei, etc. Buying land is far preferable to fighting over it, much
easier, simpler, and by far a surer way of getting it. 

Another thing you\'re missing, here, I think. The 3I only appears bigger than
all of the other groups because all we see are the 3I-centric maps. All of the
major polities have occupied space that goes far beyond the fringes that show
on the 3I maps. 

Also, in point of fact, since the initial expansion of the 3I, and certainly
since the Civil War (400 or so) the 3I has not grown. None of the Frontier
wars have done anything to gain them more than a world or three. The Solomani
Rim War _lost_ them huge swaths of territory, since the Solomani Protectorate
broke away from the Third Imperium. The 3I managed to gain back _some_
territory, mosat notably Terra, but that was probably the bitterest, most
costly single campaign in Imperial history. 

I\'d wager that casualties taken in the siege and occupation of Terra ran,
easily, into the tens or hundreds of millions. In the billions of you count
civilian casualties...that was over one world. Granted it was a rather
_important_ world.

Here you\'re beginning to see the reasoning behind the Rebellion...internal
strife was the only way generalized all-out war would reasonably occur.

Finally, we have the end result, in the improbable event that what you\'re
describing does happen...what next? Each of these groups carve up the remains
of the 3I for themselves?

Go play Diplomacy a half dozen times or so to get a feel of what that kind of
conflict would be like...;-)

Here in San Francisco we have a monthly even called "Critical Mass."  The
last Friday of every month, thousands of bicyclists gather at the foot of
Market St. to show solidarity among the people who ride in the City.

About two years ago, it turned into a riot.  (These people do deliberately
block intersections, etc..) One protestor was filmed taking his tire pump
and smashing out the headlights of a car that had the nerve to try and
cross an intersection with a green light.  The bike messenger than
deliberately rode into a pedestrian, knocking her down.

Well, he gets arrested.  The police seize the bike and pump as evidence.
The jerk *sues the city* because he needs the bike to make a living!!  This
was one of those cases where I wish Shanghai Kelly was still around to
remove people like this.  He lost his suit, of course, but got a lot of
face time on TV blubbering about how "the Man" was stripping him of his
rights, etc.

OBTrav: During a vital, time-restricted event (chase, trying to get the
antidote to the hospital, making a meeting with a touchy crime boss) the
characters get caught up in a protest or street fair.

Rammer is the first chapter of A World out of Time.  Niven said at the 1993

the setting is so damn depressing, and he gave away the ending in AWooT.

Having walked my share of picket lines (legally), I can tell you that there
are quite a few people out there who view any activity that impedes them as
wrong. A picket line (in a legal strike or demonstration) can legally slow
you down (although after five minutes they must allow you to proceed), and
yet I\'ve been run down by little old ladies who equate delaying them with
Nazism. (I kid you not!)

I also remember the Days of Action here in Toronto. On Friday there was a
violent incident at a picket line (someone rammed their car into the line,
and friends of the chap hit lost their tempers): Conrad Black\'s media
machine condemned the violence and said how it proved all lefties were
intent on destroying society. On Saturday there was no violence (protesters
brought their children and picnic lunches): Conrad Black\'s media machine
said how this proved all lefties weren\'t serious.

Still, I got a good media lesson out of it for a while. I taped the
coverage on Global, and could show my kids how the half-empty streets shown
on the news were actually filmed later, after the protest had been over for
two hours. (Did that by calculating the sun\'s elevation using shadows.) Led
to an interesting discussion about why _that_ film had been used, seeing as
Glbal had had a team on duty all day. Also noted that Global used a clip of
the police chief giving an estimate of the protesters, but did not show the
next sentence (where he explained that this was only those in a limited
area at one time, not the total number participating).

Oddly enough, our neo-con government has explicitly removed this type of
media literacy from the new curriculum.  Sometimes I agree with the
American view of government... then I remember that it is large
corporations who funded the election of this government (which rather
eliminates trusting private enterprise), which tends to leave me feeling
somewhat paranoid.

On the Mac side, MacAddict (in their November issue) includes StrataVision3D
and a limited edition of Cinema4d GO, which is upgradeable to their entry
level product for $50. Not a bad deal, because it comes with a CD called
\'Spaceship Parts\', and the entry level program is $200 retail. ;-) Cinema 4D
is a pretty nice program. Some of the pros on the Strata list have been raving
about it. I\'ve played with it a tiny bit...worked through the intial tutorial.

Yeah, there are a _bunch_ of ST-related mesh sites out there, aalmost as many

POV-Ray is free, and quite capable. BUT, and this is a HUGE BUT. POV-Ray is
ONLY a rendering engine, NOT a modeller...you can do stuff entirely in POV-Ray
by writing code (stuff like:

Sphere {<x,y,z>, Texture Wood,, }

with a bunch of other things in it.)

 The latest versions have some quite powerful features. 

Most people use something like Moray, though to do the modelling and scene
assembly, then render in POV-Ray.

Check out http://www.povray.org for more details.

Is there a version of Lynx that can do tables? (And if there is, how do
I get my sysadmin to install it on his Solaris box so I can use it with
my shell account?)

And in any case, how hard is it to make the "label" for the GIFs
selectable so us folks with text mode browsers can download them to
view later?

Well, there are always the Hare Krishnas. 

You knowm when you stop to think about it, that\'s one *strange*
religion. They consider themselves to have converted to and be
practicing a religion, yet that religion ("Hindusm") requires that you
be *born* into it! I\'m told this *greatly* irritates *real* Hindus. 

Need I mention that a similar situation (say, with the religion of an
alien race) has *great* potential for a Traveller scenario?

I have never heard of the five minutes rule; however, I do know that getting
in someone\'s face and screaming is legally considered assault-- I was told
this when my lawyer advised me to take a restraining order out against
someone and I said, "but they\'ve never hit me" and he said "They don\'t have
to!"

I do not actually think that picketers should be allowed to obstruct people
physically because it comes too close to behavior that borders on assault
and I prefer there to be less of a gray area.  Certainly they should not be
permitted to TOUCH or throw things on people.  This is the main problem I
have with abortion and animal rights protesters.  To get away from abortion,
I do believe that throwing red paint on women in furs is a form of assault
and battery, and I\'m just waiting for some woman to have an allergic
reaction to the paint, perhaps a latex allergy, and collect a hefty
settlement.  That would please me immensely.

I will also say that I have a lot more respect for people who sit outside of
buildings and quietly pray or carry signs than I do for anyone who gets in
my face.  The second someone begins to behave violently toward me, getting
in my face and attempting to interfere with my plans for the day, nothing
they have to say is of any interest to me.  This is not, IMNAAHO, peaceful.

I may not think that they are Nazis but as Cynthia said, there are lots of
ways to convey a message to such a degree that no one will ever want to hear
it.  Whereas I have stopped and walked up to people standing quietly in a
row holding candles, asked them what it was about, LISTENED, taken
information, and in a few cases, been convinced.  (Most notably regarding
Falun Gong, recently.)

ObTrav:  I wonder about different protesting styles in the cultures of the
Third Imperium.  How do the Vilani protest ANYTHING?  Do the Vargr and the
Aslan even have demonstrations?  Do the K\'Kree throw paint on old ladies in
furs?

Close, but not quite. The Mary in question was Mary - Queen of Scots.

Yelling is indeed peaceful picketing by the standards generally
applied.  It is also something that doesn\'t hurt anyone and shouldn\'t
be restricted.  Like I said, even many pro-choice advocates who remember
the tactics used against them in the sixties have taken this position.

Throwing paint is indeed a violation of the law and should be
dealt with.  But trying to use the tactics of a radical faction
to discredit an entire movement is a tactic that was wrong when
applied to anti-Vietnam War protestors and should be avoided
here.

>If all the protestors do is stand around outside with their signs and

Others do.  Laws have been passed to limit this.

> The minute they

I agree (as long as you are talking about real harassment and not simple
things like shouting your beliefs).  Even here there is some hypocrisy in
the world.  I know many people who see not problem with harassing scabs
crossing a picket line who get bent out of shape by anti-abortion
protestors.  The problem is that too many people are simply trying to limit
advocacy of views they disagree with.  Instead we should be trying to reach
a consistent definition of what is allowed and applying it evenly to all.

Amazon has a couple of entries under the title "Step Farther Out."  It\'s
out of print, and has been for ages.  But it\'s not too hard to find at a
reasonable price through some of the online used book finders.  I prefer
Bibliofind (http://www.bibliofind.com), which listed copies from $6 to $67
(the last for a near-mint hardback).  If I can\'t dig up my copy, I may have
to buy one of these myself.

Jesse is correct - I am using JavaScript (not Java, different animals) to
facilitate the rollovers. My sight also uses DHTML, Frames, and Layers. I\'ve
strived to keep my file sizes small and the sight fast - I feel its pretty
decent in the speed department. However, I could be mistaken. I would value
everyone\'s opinion on the matter.

I sympathsize with Rob and others who either cannot or will not run the
newer browsers. That was why I initially tried to have two websites - one
text, one graphics. But that proved to be very time-consuming, and I feel
that the graphical version is better - looks nicer and is easier to
navigate. YMMV. So that\'s the one I picked.

I am, however, making an effort to be fully HTML compliant, and I\'m using no
browser-specific tags.

I do apologize to everyone out there who disagrees with my decision - if you
feel strongly about it, please email me off the list and plead your case. I
changed it once, I could do it again...

Rob, why not move to IE 5.0?  I finally had to dump Netscape because with
every succeeding incarnation the code got sloppier and more crash-prone.

Ah ha!  That explains the *real* reason for the Rebelion.

JFK^B^B^BStrephon  was  actually  assassinated  by   the   Hiver-
manipulated IRIS, and Dulinor was set up to take  the  fall.  And
the Hivers used the ubiquitous Droyne (aka "the Greys") as  their
agents.

The truth is out there ... trust no one ...

Having done similar work (although from the programmer, not graphics point 
of view) I am of the opinion that while javascript rollovers and such are 
neat and allow for more attractive sites, they should never be required for 
site operation.

A specific of this is to use the <!-- <SCRIPT> </SCRIPT> --> syntax for 
scripts.

Thus people without 4+ browsers will be able to use them, although it won\'t 
be as pretty.  Note that this doesn\'t mean multiple versions, just one 
version readable by most.  Techniques like that allow nice looking 4+ pages 
that are work as less attractive 3+ pages.  I don\'t remember the difference 
between 2 and 3, so I\'m not sure that the same can be done there.  The 
policy at my company is that all pages must be usable (if ugly) by 3+ 
browsers....

Several of you have emailed me with comments about my website. In response
to your comments, I have _again_ changed the sight - removing all scripting
and much of the graphic "bitz".

What remains? I\'m using the following:
    HTML 3.2
    Frames
    Cascading Style Sheets, but the site will work with out them.
    Tables

No DHTML, no JavaScript, no Applets, etc...

Several people said that they thought a site should be pure text - no
graphical elements or layout at all. Well, I don\'t think I can go that far.
I find text only sites to be rather boring - my opinion, of course.

I hope that you find this _new_ version to be acceptable and faster. And
keep the comments coming.

What I want to know is why would someone think Denmark was a
communist state?  Not because of the social programs listed or the
high taxes mentioned, surely!  Health care and higher education is
pretty close to being free in most of Western Europe and Canada
isn\'t it?  We might joke about it, but we really don\'t think Canada
*or* Denmark is a communist country.  Now, if you said that Denmark
has banned private ownership of property, especially productive
property, that would be a different story.  <g>

Feel free to ignore my personal opinions, but about the state
providing social services...  We all know these services aren\'t
*really* free.  So, you should expect higher taxes if the state is
paying for extensive social services.  At what level where this is a
good trade off (increased services for everyone vs higher taxes
assessed against everyone) is a debatable point that every country
has to make, but one that can exist in any mixed market economy
state.

I think one of the problems folks in the US have with government
provided services is that we don\'t perceive the services are (or
would be) worth what we pay (or would pay) for them.  The perception
may be right or wrong, but it is there.  Personally, I think it is a
size problem.  Public education through 12th grade is free and is,
for the most part, both locally controlled and financed.  Programs
that extend beyond the local or state level is where most people
have seem to strongly object. 

Ob Trav:  It appears that schools and universities are generally
free in the OTU as well.  Otherwise, PC\'s would have the strong
possibility of having outstanding loans after graduating.  Frankly,
I think, a lot of us play the medical system as being pretty much
free as well.  When\'s the last time you asked a PC for an insurance
card or denied them medical care until they paid, or showed that
they could pay for the care? <g>

You are correct, Smoke Ring was the sequel.  I also remember Rammer

...and it still doesn\'t give any guidance on how an Alderson Point

I know that in the MiGE universe the points are generally several AU
out from the star, but for a varient, I don\'t see why we couldn\'t
put them close to the star.

A bit amusing....

K\'Kree -> No protests against K\'Kree society.  K\'Kree living abroad (all 7
of them :-) may stage protests as directed from above.

Vilani -> Rare protests.  Those that do occur follow tradional forms
exactly, as does the official response.  They only occur for tradionally
accepted reasons.

Vargr -> All the time.

Alsan -> Yes.  Highly ritualized.  Different forms for whether you are
willing to stop short of starting a blood feud.

Zhondani -> No.  Those who are unhappy are "helped" before it ever comes to
that.

Droyne -> Generally no.  May occur as directed by a Leader but mass opinion
has little or no meaning among the Droyne.

Hiver -> Probably not.  Discontent is expressed through less public channels.

It\'s entirely possible that I\'ll have a hangover when I wake up on January
1st, so I might actually appreciate the silence. However, I think it will be
better to silence the Prince song "1999" for a day, since I\'ll probably hear
it more times this New Year\'s Eve than I have since it was released.

Apart from that, I don\'t really care. I don\'t buy the "cause and effect" of
violent movies and television on people. If it were, I would most likely be
a bloodthirsty bastard who would make Hannibal the Cannibal look like Mary
Poppins.

>What if people boycotted movies with violent

To put it simply, it would draw more people to movie theaters to see those
violent movies. In point of fact, if such a thing happens at a theater near
me I vow that I will take lots of Motrin, drink lots of caffeine and go and
see the most violent movies possible.

> The chart:

First off, in RL most financial systems  partially  separate  the
stock market, bond market, commodities market, and forex (foreign
exchange or currency) market.  However, the forex market tends to
work much like the stock market ...  currency  is  fast  becoming
just another type of asset like a stock.

Currency is often abreviated to "ccy"
Exchange rate is often abreviated to "xrate"

Now there are two xrates: the PPP (purchase price  parity)  xrate
which is used by economists to compare  different  countries  GDP
figures (etc), and the market xrate which  is  used  by  everyone
else when buying and selling ccy.

The PPP xrate is  the  rate  that  *would*  exist  if  goods  and
services had a universal price.  For example if a range of  goods
cost USD 10,000 in the US and the same goods  cost  GBP 6,000  in
the UK then the PPP xrate would  be  USD 10  =  GBP 6  (or  about
USD 1.67 per GBP).

The market xrate is xrate the free market thinks  it  should  be.
As a rule of thumb developed nations tend to have a market  xrate
similar to their PPP xrate, where as third world  countries  have
market xrates of 75% or even as low as 50% of their  PPP  xrates.
However the actual market xrate will bounce  around  this  figure
based on speculation much as stock prices bounce around.

In anything other than a planned economy (socialist states,  etc)
the market xrate is set by the free market.  In planned economies
the xrate is set by the planetary government ...  and  where  its
rate differs from a free market evaluation there will be:

1) a "black market"
2) a preference amongst locals for non-local major ccy
3) an impediment to international trade

Note that banks (etc) typically quote the xrate with their  mark-
ups already added in (thus they quote a  separate  buy  and  sell
rate for each ccy).  The difference  between  the  buy  and  sell
xrates is called the "spread".

The chart given only begins to make sense if you think of  it  as
giving the xrate in local credits ... where there are N local ccy
units ("bucks", "quid", "yen", whatever) per local credit.  N  is
a relatively stable but otherwise random number.

Actually, it goes much deeper than that.  The Hivers were
manipulating both Dulinor and Lucan.  One to assassinate Strephon
and the other to finish distrupting the center. 

Yes, and the Virus was a Hiver manipulation too!

It is also something that doesn\'t hurt anyone and shouldn\'t be restricted.
Like I said, even many pro-choice advocates who remember the tactics used
against them in the sixties have taken this position.

I have a problem with protesters (of anything) who get up into your face and
yell things directly AT you.  Yelling "one two three four, time to stop this
effing war" or other appropriate slogans, is one thing.  Abortion and animal
rights protesters, and union protesters too, though, have this habit of
getting into people\'s faces and yelling personal insults directly at people.
This is, by most legal definitions, assault-- and should be prosecuted as
such.

No one was trying to do that-- I merely mentioned that this does not happen
in Japan.  My personal position on abortion and animal rights has yet to be
stated.  However, my not being a Christian may be a big clue as to the
former; this is *generally* (I know there are some exceptions) a religious
issue.

Shouting beliefs, fine.  Getting directly into someone\'s face at spitting
distance and telling them that THEY are a murderer (whether because they
wear fur, are entering a women\'s clinic, or are going to work at a nonunion
company), not fine, especially if you are gesticulating wildly and in
general, behaving in a threatening manner.

I\'m not one of those people.  I don\'t think you have the right to get in
another person\'s face and shout at them.  I don\'t think that being in
protest of something should obviate the normal laws against threatening
behavior, assault, and battery.  I also think that aggressive panhandlers
(the kind that follow you, act menacing, and make you wonder if they will
mug you to get the money) should be jailed.

I agree.

Now that we\'ve agreed, perhaps we should find a way to steer this
conversation back to topic.

What is allowed in the 3I?

Yes, it\'s obvious that our attempts to destroy Canadian society and turn
it into a shadow of the United States have met with repeated failure.

It\'s too big for 5FW rules, I think.  Remember, the 5FW map is of only
about one quarter of the Spinward Marches, and still takes up about half
a pool table.  I think this idea is better suited to Diplomacy (which we
were discussing a while ago on the TML; the seven players as Imperial,
Solomani, Aslan, Zhodani, Vargr, K\'Kree and Hiver was my idea (although
maybe not only mine)).

Yes, sure they do -- but do they trust each other enough actually to
expose their military/naval resources to the Imperium?

The Vilani probably have a traditional, sanctioned form of protest that
involves completing official protest forms at the appropriate
administrative office.  Come to think of it, that\'s probably how the
Zhodani handle it, too, except that forms are just a formality to create
a record, because the Tavrchedl have already figured out what the
protestors are upset about and made recommendations to the local noble
council.

How can an outsider even tell if the Vargr are protesting?  In any case,
protest styles will vary extremely across the incredible diversity of
Vargr societies.

The Aslan probably have great traditions of noble and honorable protest,
including carrying petitions to Edo (but not ritual suicide, as I
recall).

The K\'Kree shoot old ladies in furs.

No, they don\'t...they nuke them and their planets from orbit, just to make
sure. If they\'re feeling particularly frisky, they sterilize every system for
a parsec around, unless the have nice pastureland, in which case they just use
lots and lots of neutron bombs.

Hivers stage three different counter-protests, publish subtly biased articles
in obscure but influential journals and infiltrate counter-agents to bend the
protesters organization to their own ends.

the Solomani _response_ to protests...

You mean something like the "KNOWN SPACE" maps that show the Solomani

*My* take on this is that a pages should be *usable* in text mode. And
that if you\'ve got the nifty "inline" graphics, it would be nice if
they were tagged so that us "text only" folks can download them to view

Only if you accept the "evil, mind-raping Zho scum" stereotype. It\'s
also possible that the discontent that would lead to protests is noted
in the earlist stages, and the *problem* is dealt with. 

In some cases, the problem is a matter of perception, or can\'t readily
be solved. In which case various sorts of counseling and support are
available. And it may even be possible that it would be judged that a
peaceful protest would be the best way for the proles to deal with
their feelings about the unfixable problem.

But they _do_.  Who among you has _not_ looked out on some aspect of the
world around you and thought, "This would make a _hilarious_ TV
sitcom!"?

I didn\'t think so.

ObTrav:  Two things occur to me:

1.  Do the various subraces of humaniti find the same kinds of things
funny?  I don\'t mean "Do they find the same jokes funny?".  I wouldn\'t
expect a Vilani to laugh at a Solomani joke about hidebound traditions,
for instance.  However, like it or not, ethnic humor is deeply ingrained
in the Terran psyche.  Do Zhodani tell "chaotic Solomani" jokes?  Are
pratfalls a constant in human comedy?  Do Vilani make puns?

2.  Is humor (in whatever form) a universal concept among sentient
species, or are there races in the OTU that simply don\'t find _anything_
funny?  (I suspect that humor is an inevitable companion of sentience. 
After all, even the SDG chips had something that could be construed as a
sense of humor [the Deo/Deyo segment in _Survival Margin_]....)

If humor _is_ inextricably linked to sentience, what kinds of humor
appeal to what races in the OTU?

The reason for your repeated failure is that we Canadians are actually,

You might want to look at http://www.pond.com/~russotto/zplet/ifol.html
This is the home page of the zplet applet, an infocom interpreter written
in java. If you can get russotto to let you use the zplet on your own page,
you could have any inform written code you want on a web page. Of course,
I\'ll probably end up doing this by default.

The K\'kree would consider that to be a waste of ammunition.

They just trample them instead.

My advice is to find out which of the two stereotypes your players
believe is the way Zhos "really are". Then keep having them run into
incidents that fit the other stereotype. If they change their mind,
change the incident type.

My copy, an Ace "large" paperback, does not have an explcitly marked ISBN,
though it has the number of 78584-0 on the front cover next to the Ace logo.
It also states it was printed in the USA.

I have another copy of _half_ the book, labelled "A Step Farther Out Part 2"
undr the "Star" label and that has the ISBN 0 352 30906 7 Though this
doesn\'t have the chapter on  "Building the Mote In God\'s Eye" , which I
assume is in Part 1

I\'d have thought that your main risk was that "jerk" denting your door.
Surely you have to swing that monstrosity out across three lanes in
order to have enough room to roll it round a corner?
Besides, if you followed the one true path (ie driving on the left) in the
one true vehicle (ie MG sportscar), you wouldn\'t have *this* problem with
turning right.

Not at all, my friend.  Not at all.  I got what I expected from my

Actually, IMTU the PCs must pay for health care, or the hospital gets very
annoyed. Health insurance is funded by megacorporations, so if you don\'t work
for one, first aid is a cash business.

I\'ll have to check my notes and get back to you.  Otherwise, I think that
there was a note in Bannerji\'s pocket showing his "vacation trip" route to
the sunny Vargr Extents -- if it shows the whole route, then there should
only be a few possible worlds that work and haven\'t been identified as
something else.

It appears to.  The Vargr world generation rules I\'ve seen seem to allow
this for a reasonable number of worlds.  I think it\'s reasonable that the
Vargr are tech-16 in spots; they\'ve never had an Extents-wide Long Night,
after all.  Lair is tech-15, but it\'s been pointed out that there\'s more
important Vargr worlds than Lair.

It might be a little from Column A and a little from Column B. There might
be times when a problem isn\'t considered to be a problem by the Zhodani
leadership, and the "evil, mind-raping Zho scum" option might be used. On
the other hand, if the problem is one that is valid and *should* be fixed,
then I can see the "nice caring utopian Zho superbeings" option being put
into action.

<snip details>

In practice, given the time required to shift military forces between fronts in the Imperium, the fact of attacks on multiple fronts wouldn\'t be relevant for the first couple years of any war; it seems that most wars in the Traveller universe are fairly local conflicts, due to the vast efforts required to move fleets more than a sector or two.  Aside from that, \'everyone gang up on the Empire\' isn\'t too likely a scenario, due to general mutual distaste (and severe difficulties in execution).

However, if the Empire got into a war with a couple of powers and appeared _weak_, everyone else might decide to jump in and start carving out chunks.  For example, if the Fifth Frontier War had gone slightly differently and the Spinward Marches had collapsed, a clever warleader among the Vargr could build on his successes there and spread attacks inward, uniting the Vargr as he goes. The Solomani might react to this situation by deciding it was a good time to retake the Solomani Rim; they might be right.  Eventually, I can see the other powers being drawn in, though I suspect once the spinward marches fell it would mostly be Vargr, K\'kree, and Solomani attacking (the Hivers are relatively unlikely to attack, the Aslan and Zhodani are fairly inconveniently located.
, the Empire would probably be forced to go try to take it back, and the Solimani might decide that it was a good time to take back the Solomani Rim.

That\'s actually a very good point.  This is by far the most civilized (not

FYI, I\'ve emailed all the messages I could find to Mick, which should be all of them. However, this presents a great opportunity for me to remind you of the existence of my Library Data web pages, which also include these emperors of the ROM.

Some of you might have missed them (I can only hope) since my ISP tore down the domain that hosted them, and Real World (tm) kept interfering with my posting an update here on the list. Anyway, they\'re still there, although nothing new has happened to them for a while.

I do not care to have my reaction characterized as "knee-jerk" when I have
thought these issues through long before this piece of internet spam made
its way into my box, Charles.

Violence is a part of the human nature.  I believe that by censoring it
you drive it into the underground where it can only come out even worse.
I\'m not willing to do that even for one day.  I\'m tired of the notion that
we can improve ourselves by cutting off bits.  Violence is necessary, it
is what impels us to defend our loved ones and family and selves when
required.  I am not anti-violence.  I am against the misuse of violence,
but I will never become the sort of person that is so against violence
that they\'d allow their spouse to be raped, for example, rather than
fight.  Violent movies, for the most part, celebrate heroism-- the person
who endures violence in order to defend or help others.

And I think this is a well-intentioned, but ultimately very bad, idea.

No. The Imperial Space maps in the encyclopedia are far smaller in scope,
being 7x7 sectors. The map I refer to is some 20x15 sectors...

even amonst terrans, different cultures find different things funny. Many
jokes can be crossed over culturally, but many more cannot. Certain jokes
and idioms are translatable, but not funny when translated, and not funny
to non-inculturated persons.

Actually, we don\'t know if Destiny\'s Road (or it\'s two bretheren stories
Legacy of Heorot and Beowulf\'s Children) are set in the State.  For one
thing, the colonists in LoH used cold sleep to get to Tau Ceti, with some

>I think alot of people out there got the wrong idea from this post.

If they did, it can\'t be blamed entirely on the audience. The piece itself
was written in the same "anonymous appeal" style that is all too popular
these days on the internet. It was written in a fashion that (almost
cleverly) hides its aims behind deliberately non-insulting "peace and love"
rhetoric.

Perhaps you\'re right, but I read it differently. Upon reading it again, I\'m
convinced that it\'s not my critical faculties that are at fault. The piece
is clearly an appeal to the audience to practice entertainment
self-censorship for a day, with the unspoken "what if" assumption that this
act would help to curb violence in general.

To make things even more confusing, there is no yard stick by which to
measure what is meant by "violent content", which is interesting since what
does and what does not constitute "violent content" is still hotly debated.
What\'s worse is that the scenario outlined in the piece that Jason forwarded
doesn\'t take into account the possibility that certain books, television
programs and movies make use of "violent content" in hammering home a
message that is distinctly anti-violence.

>Too many of

This has plenty to do with the First Amendment, since it advocates
"voluntary" censorship. Why would participation in this act have any
importance at all otherwise? A boycott of any sort is always intended to
send a message to those who profit from what is being boycotted. In effect,
this piece is saying that you should send a message to television networks
and movie studios that you will not tolerate "violent content" under any
circumstances. That\'s fine if you really believe it will help, but
apparently this message was passed on to a group that, for the most part,
doesn\'t.

It has plenty to do with the Second Amendment since the only form of
violence that is explicitly mentioned in the text happens to be gun
violence. It\'s a subtle way of associating being anti-gun with being
anti-violence, regardless of what that term might actually mean.

>The "Day of Peace" movement is not anti-gun nor anti-free
>speech.  It is anti-violence.


The problem is that "anti-violence" in today\'s American vocabulary means (if
you identify with the left) "anti-gun", or (if you identify with the right)
"anti-free speech".

This piece leaves us with the burning questions of what constitutes
"violent-content" and exactly what end this piece hopes to attain by the
actions it advocates.

Many believe that humans have an intrinsic need for an outlet for violent 
emotions.  By releasing such emotions through violent but non-destructive 
ways may it may be possible reduce the actual destructive violence.  One 
interesting theory is that exposure to representations of violence (art, 
music, movies, etc.) may be a sufficient outlet for these 
emotions.  Following this theory, in order to limit violence, this "Day of 
Peace" should encourage people to watch the most violent possible movies 
instead of actually hurting other people.

This is not meant to be a flame.  I am simply trying to point out that such 
actions as eliminating violent movies may actually cause destructive 
violence.  After all, the goal isn\'t to eliminate all violent 
thoughts/deeds/emotions, it\'s to eliminate the destructive ones....

For an amusing treatment of this theory, see Alan Dean Foster\'s "Quotzl".

In Canada, a picket line must be moving, and it may not obstruct people for
more than five minutes. The usual laws regarding assault still apply (to
both picketers and line-crossers).

Depends on how you define "obstruct", doesn\'t it?  If you say "move" and I
am s----l----o----w----l----y moving, am I obstructing you?  What if I\'m moving,
but the chap behind me is following so close that you can\'t slip between us
(and so on)?  If you push through, are _you_ assaulting _us_?  (After all,
we\'re just walking around the block.) That\'s why Canadian law defines a
legal limit (for the whole line, not per protester): anything longer than
five minutes _is_ obstructing, and grounds for having the line shut down.
I think it\'s a reasonable compromise, because I can\'t think of very many
cases where someone whould absolutely need to cross a line in less than
five minutes, and these can be handled by simple negotiation. ("Look, I\'m a
doctor and there\'s someone with a heart attack in there"  qualifies; "Look,
I\'m a lawyer and I have to make a phone call" doesn\'t.)  There are lines
where this doesn\'t work, and there are legal methods for shutting those
lines down.

Yup.  But I find it ironic that exercising my legal and democratic right
should somehow make me a Nazi. According to this woman, we went to war so
that people would follow their leaders!  (I wonder who she thinks won,
anyway.)

Vilani?  No idea, but if they do all the permits are in order. A question
for the TravCulture list, I think.

Vargr? Yes, definately. Part of a leader\'s charisma is how big a crowd
follows you.

Aslan?  Probably not. Individual Aslan will act as their honour dictates,
including challenges to _personal_ duels. (One reason we have mass
demonstrations is that the ordinary person feels a need to group together
against the massed force of the opposition.  If your average British Green
protester could challenge the chairman of Monsanto, it wouldn\'t take long
before Monsanto listened to local opinion.)

K\'kree? Paint? Stomp them into the ground.  (Parenthetically, the first
time I see an animal rights type throw paint on the leather jacket of a
biker, because they oppose killing animals for clothing, I\'ll conceed that
they are serious about their beliefs.)

A case in point:  I work in a very high-pressure software company (is that
redundant?), in which members of different groups often have grossly
different and frequently conflicting priorities, just due to how quickly
things change and management\'s inability to keep things coordinated.  As a
result, despite everyone doing their best, tensions and resentments can
run very high.

So, several evenings a week, we all play Quake for a couple of hours.
Firing a salvo of rockets at fleeing members of the Marketing team has
calmed my nerves and soothed my anger many, many times.  It\'s hard to say
from obviously anecdotal evidence, but I think our Quaking has helped
significantly in making our company work better, and the people in it
happier with themselves and each other.

It\'s hard for me to reconcile this with the view that violent video games
(and movies, and so forth) cause real violence.  I think it\'s more the
opposite.  After all, movies have never been bloodier, and ultra-violent
and realistic immersive games are new this decade, but violent crime in
America continues a precipitous multiyear decline.  And as others have
mentioned, in Japan, where the content is even more horrific, the society
is less violent.

My take on the whole affair is that we are suffering from yet another side
effect of the all-seeing media eye.  These days, when a few whacked-out
kids shoot up their schools, all the world knows about every detail,
instantly, exhaustively, for weeks.  There\'s no escaping the story, and
the impression "kids are shooting up our schools" gets into the collective
psyche despite the fact that 99.99999% of our kids are in fact *not*
shooting up our schools.  A hundred years ago, there were mass murders in
rural America that make for stomach-churning reading, but few people knew
about them, and *nobody* outside the legal system knew as much about them
as we all would if they happened today.

Or for a cheesier but also interesting take, the original Trek episode

I do not care to have my reaction characterized as "knee-jerk" when I have
thought these issues through long before this piece of internet spam made
its way into my box, Charles.
</Kiri>

One can think things through thoroughly and still have knee-jerk
reactions.  I have thoroughly thought through many issues but still react
to them in a reflexive way.  I\'m not accusing you of this, I wasn\'t
picking on anyone in particular, but it seemed to me that one person said
"Hey wouldn\'t a day without violence be a good idea?" and many responded
"You\'ll have my gun when you pry it from my cold dead hand!" or "I\'ll say
what I want when I want you tyrant!"  Non-sequitur, IMO.

<Kiri>
Violence is a part of the human nature.  I believe that by censoring it
you drive it into the underground where it can only come out even worse.
I\'m not willing to do that even for one day.  I\'m tired of the notion that
we can improve ourselves by cutting off bits.  Violence is necessary, it
</Kiri>

A couple of people have expressed this old catharsis idea.  The literature
on violence shows that "letting it out" can both reduce and cause
violence.  Also, "keeping it in" can have the same effect.  In short,
there is no clear relation one way or the other. Saying we need an outlet
is just a cop-out. Violence is most certainly _not_ necessary.  Many
cultures have survived for long periods with minimal violence.  The fact
that these cultures tend to get plowed under by others only says that the
universe is a tough place. But once you let your values drop and declare
that violence is okay because "it\'s natural" you open the door to just
about any behaviour.  Racism, rape and just about any evil act you can
think of can be justified as "natural" (whatever that means, since
all things are part of nature).

<Kiri>
is what impels us to defend our loved ones and family and selves when
required.  I am not anti-violence.  I am against the misuse of violence,
but I will never become the sort of person that is so against violence
that they\'d allow their spouse to be raped, for example, rather than
fight.  Violent movies, for the most part, celebrate heroism-- the person
who endures violence in order to defend or help others.
</Kiri>

The fact that you consider rape wrong means that you are in fact
anti-violence.  Otherwise, what rule is their to condemn this act? 
Because it is a "misuse of violence"?  What constitutes a "proper use of
violence"?  Maybe lynching the guy you think committed the rape?  This
sort of justification has led to all sorts of innocent death.  All
violence is a misuse of action.  Defending yourself is sometimes the best
course of action available, but that doesnt\' make hurting your attacker a
"good thing".


<Chris Seamans>
If they did, it can\'t be blamed entirely on the audience. The piece itself
was written in the same "anonymous appeal" style that is all too popular
these days on the internet. It was written in a fashion that (almost
cleverly) hides its aims behind deliberately non-insulting "peace and
love"rhetoric.
</Chris>

Well, I\'m not sure about this particular post, but the idea seems to be to
celebrate peace to me.  The way you celebrate family is to get them
together, the way you celebrate charity is to give gifts, the way to
celebrate peace is to practice it.  Watching violent shows on such a day
would be the equivalent of watching "Killing Zoe" on Xmas or watching "The
Krays" on Thanksgiving...

<Chris>
To make things even more confusing, there is no yard stick by which to
measure what is meant by "violent content", which is interesting since
what
does and what does not constitute "violent content" is still hotly
debated.
</Chris>

Well, clearly the yard-stick would be your own.  I mean that each person
could choose what they considered violent content.  A football game would
not qualify in my house, but might in others.

<Chris>
This has plenty to do with the First Amendment, since it advocates
"voluntary" censorship. Why would participation in this act have any
</Chris>

What\'s "voluntary cencorship"?  The capacity for _me_ to decide what _I_
will watch is what freedom of speech is all about isn\'t it?  Others have a
right to suggest what I should say, but I needn\'t obey them.  The "Day of
Peace" concept seems to me a perfectly reasonable suggestion.

<Chris>
The problem is that "anti-violence" in today\'s American vocabulary means
(if
you identify with the left) "anti-gun", or (if you identify with the
right)
"anti-free speech".

This piece leaves us with the burning questions of what constitutes
"violent-content" and exactly what end this piece hopes to attain by the
actions it advocates.
</Chris>

So you\'re saying it\'s impossible to simply be anti-violence?  Again, I\'m
not sure about your theories regarding ulterior motives here, but taken at
face value, the idea of a day to celebrate peace seems like a good one to
me.  Sorry you don\'t feel the same way.

All humans act in this manner, its genetic/instinctive; however not all
humans react in this manner all the time.  The science of General Semantics
addresses this issue.

The fact that it is a violent act which is not being committed in order to
defend oneself or someone else.  I believe that those are the right uses
of violent behavior.  I think that people who decide not to defend
themselves or their loved ones are complicit in what happens to them,
because they could have done something to stop it, but chose not to.

I very much disagree.  I don\'t think that we should be teaching people
that you can rape, kill, loot, misuse innocent people and nothing will
happen to you.  When you refuse to defend yourself and those who depend on
you, you are letting the world know that your own life and the lives of
those you love are not worth the discomfort to your conscience and stomach
that doing something about it would cost you.

If someone comes into my house bent on harming me or my loved ones, I can
and WILL defend myself and those I love or go down fighting.  That way,
whatever happens, I\'ll know that I did my best to take care of myself and
the people I love.  And if my attacker gets hurt, maybe it will make him
think twice.  If my attacker gets killed, perhaps in his next life he\'ll
be more cautious.  Call it removal from the game for unnecessary
roughness.

Violence is a part of human nature.  I believe that human nature is
basically good.  Violence, like all other parts of human nature, has its
place.  Rape and other acts of unwarranted violence are wrong; not because
they do or do not occur in the animal kingdom (you brought that up, not
me) but because we are intelligent enough to be the master of our nature
and to use all of its parts appropriately rather than suppressing them or
letting them run hog wild.

I personally like human beings.  We are capable of horrific atrocity, but
show me an animal who can create so much beauty...

Actually, from statements in "Rammer", corpsicles are *not* revivable
with the tech available to "The State". They merely extracted his
memory RNA from the "mush" left by the freeze/thaw damage and dumped it
into a brainwiped criminal. He\'s *not* in his original body.

But I seriously doubt that "The State" existed when the ships in
"Legacy of Heorot", "Beowulf\'s Children" and "Destiny\'s Road" were
launched. It may have sprung up *later* (which might explain the
communications breakdown), but given the way "The State" planned, I
don\'t see them abandoning those colonies. I think this is yet another
Niven universe. It\'s not like he didn\'t *already* have several!

There was a later Challenge scenario that dealt with the PCs meeting a female
crewmember from that first contact ship. Supposedly she had gone through a
spatial misjump.

For anyone at home with their references, was the first contact ship given a
name in the Challenge article?

Not enough memory.

Call me a dinosaur, but I resolutely refuse to buy a new computer just to
surf the web. My LC III does quite nicely for everything I need, so I see
no need to upgrade. Andy\'s web site may be the cat\'s pajames, but I refuse
to believe it\'s worth several thousand dollars for a new computer system
(plus upgrading all my software to run on the new computer system).

I\'ve let them die in the street on one planet, then assessed the estate for
cleaning fees (to get the blood out of the concrete). A _really_ nasty
trick is a planet where _everything_ is user-pay, right down to asking
directions (and that should have been a clue that medical care wouldn\'t be

If this were true, there would be fewer fights after a sporting event, not
more.

What seems to happen, according to Watson (in "Dark Nature"), is that the
folks who\'s team/boxer/whatever won go home happy, and the losers go home
and pick fights. (Note: this is a statistical thing, like hot weather, and
applies to groups not individuals). Vicariously winning seems to remove the
need to win in a conflict, vicariously losing leaves all the original
aggression entact.

I strongly urge people to read "Dark Nature". I found it an excellent book
on the biological components of evil. Think of it as a cross between
science and philosophy. Even if you don\'t agree with Watson (and I do),
you\'ll get a lot of neat ideas for Traveller cultures out of it.

I can believe this.  However, this seems to be a further argument for 
violent movies, at least for the kind in which the hero wins....

AFIAK Japan has a near total ban on firearms, and England is coming 
close, so I\'d say not necessarily (though a 1984 style police state for 
sure).

You\'re obviously not a PC gamer then..:)  actually, I am not impressed with
todays\' computers.  I own a Pentium-II 400Mhz machine with 128megs ram and
still have to watch my resources.  I use Memturbo which helps a lot but it
doesn\'t do any good when GDI and USER resources drop..(far as I know only a
reboot fixes that as those two are STILL 16-bit holdovers).

Its a Dell machine and its had its share of troubles.  8 hours after it
arrived, the 4meg PCI video card died.  Although I had next business day
warranty on it, it took over 2 weeks for the repairman to come and fix it.
Now, the keyboard likes to vanish.  I\'ve no idea what causes this as it is
very infrequent but may be a combination of running QmodemPro, ICQ and
WinAmp at the same time.  Unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in is
the only fix short of a reboot.

Now when I had my 286, I never had all these problems.  And it was quite
rare when the machine crashed (and always MY fault for doing something ODD).
I very relunctantly made the move to Windows when less and less cool stuff
was written for DOS.

Intersting... Are you using 9x or NT?

I\'m currently running NT on a K63-450 with 128MB RAM and I\'m not having any 
problems unless I pull up 3d Studio Max R3.  For that, I need to close most 
of the other progs to get decent speed....

Sounds like you got a lemon... My dad has a high-end Dell and swears by it. 
I think it\'s his 4th Dell in a row (over the last few years.  Upgrades, not 
failures).  At this point he buys nothing but Dell.

AFIAK Japan has a near total ban on firearms, and England is coming
close, so I\'d say not necessarily (though a 1984 style police state for
sure).

Got it right here next to me, in Challenge 53. (One of two I bought from Jay 
LaRosee to fill holes in my Challenge collection. THANKS JAY!)

The article/adventure is called "Strider Incident", and involves PC contact 
with a woman who may or may not be Lorette Strider, Captain of the 
"Starleaper One", the joint Space Force/NASA/UNSCA interstellar mission to 
Barnard\'s Star in 2094.

So, apparently, "Starleaper One" is canonical as the First Contact ship.

Hm...you sure that\'s a state law?  That sounds suspiciously like something that falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government.

I don\'t remember the title either (but hey, I\'m in my
40s now and I\'m ok with not remembering stuff and
having to wear glasses), but I recall that in either
the Traveller Book or the Traveller Adventure,
Rethe/Aramis (or is it Rethe/Regina?  see,
Altzheimer\'s is already setting in) has an annual
three-day holiday called "Festival" in which anything
goes.  Then they return to their very strictly
controlled lifestyle.  That conjures up for me the
image of the nice local boy in the Star Trek episode
lunging up to the landing party and screaming,
"Festival! Festival!"

OT:  Not all "animal rights types" are paint throwers.  Some of us simply
believe that animals, like humans, have the capacity to feel pain, and that
insofar as one can avoid it, it might be nice not to inflict it on them.
Neither myself nor anyone with whom I choose to associate would dream of
tossing paint at someone wearing fur, leather, or an aluminum-foil helmet
bedecked with antlers.  For that matter, I don\'t preach to my
carnivorous/leather-clad friends, including my wife, who would probably
choose to personally chase down and kill her own wildebeests rather than
adhere to my diet.  I consider my choices to be my responsibility, and
while I\'d certainly like to see other people choose the same things I do, I
learned (fairly late in life) that I haven\'t a lot of control over that
sort of thing. This doesn\'t make me any the less "serious" about avoiding
cruelty, I don\'t think.  There are responses to ethical values other than
promotion... instantiation, for instance.  One can promote peace by
launching surgical strikes against nations that would wage long and bloody
wars with their neighbors, or one can instantiate peace by living
peacefully.  Sort of the difference between the Policeman of Democracy and
your local Quakers.  Anywho, sorry about the long OT... occasionally though
I have to speak up when people assume I\'m a hypocritical fruitcake because
I don\'t want to eat a steak.  I\'m a hypocritical fruitcake for other
reasons entirely.  ;)

A nice touch for such a planet might be that nothing s "illegal" per
se. It\'s just that there\'s a fine/fee for doing it. With some things
carrying *really* high fees.

You killed someone in a bar fight? Ok, let\'s see what he was worth (to
his family/employer/whatever). 

Ah! That deader was out of work, and almost out of cash, with no family
or friends on record. You are fined for leaving the body laying around
instead of tossing it into the *appropriate* dumpster[1]. 10 credits
please.

Tsk, tsk. This fellow over here, whose jaw you broke? He\'s a highly
skilled Space traffic controller, and it\'s going to cost 1000 credits a
*day* to replace him while he recovers. You are assessed double that
(various handling fees & penalties). 

[1]the idea of specific dumpsters for tossing *unimportant* dead bodies
(human, animal, or alien) in ought to properly boggle some players.

Oh yeah, if they don\'t check the regs, you can later gig them for
"improper use" of such a dumpster for not properly bagging and sealing
the body into the standard "body bag". Don\'t forget to charge them for
the time of the lab techs that got the forensic evidence that IDed
them, and any other costs associated with tracking them down and
billing them for it.

I would remind all that the Worlds orbiting Darida (Lusor\'s far companion)
are named in the Vilani language for famous Vilani authors. Lusor is
Regina\'s sun. I would be surprised if there isn\'t at least one of them who

ObTrav:  What would science fiction in the 3I look like?  And how
quickly would a given work of science fiction become technically
obsolete (assuming that said SF work was written based on extrapolation
of then-known science, plus plausible handwaves)?  For instance, most
pre-1980 science fiction became technically obsolete with the
introduction and spread of ever-more-powerful personal computers, which
really (in Traveller terms) is an intra-Tech Level event.

What is the likely time period in the 3I for technological evolution
that doesn\'t reach TL elevation, but still impacts significantly on the
society?

***WARNING:  I am not an attorney, nor do I play one on TV.  Any
assumption that the following is valid legal advice is unwarranted; the
following is based on a layman\'s opinion of common sense.***

Well, I would think that the doctrine of "ignorance of the law is no
excuse" only applies to laws whose existence is known to those to whom
the law applies.  After all, if there has been _no_ public notice
(however obscure) that using Monkeybagels to prepare one\'s taxes is
illegal, then one cannot be prosecuted for filing a Monkeybagel tax
return.  OTOH, if all certified public accountants have available
information that Monkeybagel tax returns are illegal, then any CPA who
files a Monkeybagel tax return _could_ be charged with violating said
law.  The CPA\'s client would be liable if either he/she/it could have
learned from outside sources that Monkeybagel tax returns were illegal,
or he/she/it ignored the advice of the CPA not to file a Monkeybagel tax
return, and did so against the advice of someone who was in a position
to know the law on this matter.

[BTW, see the following Web site [or SJG\'s Daily Illuminator for 1 Nov
99] for an explanation of Monkeybagels:

http://www.monkeybagel.com/monkeybagel.html      ]

If there is, in fact, a valid law or regulation against contact with
extraterrestials, then that law or regulation should only apply to those
who could have known of it.  In other words, if I\'m not _allowed_ to
know the law or regulation, I shouldn\'t be held liable for violating it.

***WARNING:  The above is not intended to be construed as legal advice. 
The above-posted information is only a layman\'s view of common sense.***

From my Library Data site:

====================
Rethe, Festival of

Annual celebration of the colony on Rethe ( Regina / Spinward Marches 2408).
Originally a reaction to the restrictive governmental structure considered
necessary for survival on Rethe , the three day holiday period has continued as
a carefree celebration where citizens release the tension that has built up over
the year. All laws are suspended, with law level becoming 0 during the
celebrations. Some abuses have always been persistent, but the population has
always resisted any effort to change the conditions of their favorite holiday.

The Travellers\' Aid Society has classified Rethe as an Amber Travel Zone during
the period of the Festival.

The //gs can, in fact, surf the net, but he will need an ISP who allows
19200 connections (The GS\' serial port doesn\'t go faster, IIRC), a modem, a
hard drive card, GSOS 5 or later, a multiple meg memory card, and the
appropriate software. Check amug for the software... it\'s expensive, and I
don\'t know how well it works... I lack the memory and the hard drive, and
so haven\'t bothered with the software.

it\'s in either Supp 8 or 11, maybe both (my copies on loan to someone...)

The Wall Sized one was in my copy of Deluxe Traveller , ca 1983/84 (CT 5LBB
box: Bk0, Bk 1-3,  Adv 0, the Marches map, the Known Space Map). Probably a
packing error in my favor... I do know that the local GameKeeper also had
some back then.

Also, upon sending a question in to GDW in the late 80\'s (re the
annoucement of TNE, and begging them not to do it), they sent me a second
copy along with the reply... which I sold to someone else a few years back.

not grayscale. The wall sized has red sector and subsector delinieations,
white stars, and white polity borders; the stars are NOT indicative; it
only shows rough borders.

after the next GenCon, there will be... T$R is dropping the A from AD&D 3rd
ed... so the D&D/AD&D distinction will be moot... especially since the old
D&D (basic/expert/companion/master/imortals or
cyclopaedia/wrath_of_the_immortals) is officially a dead system, and the
world (Both Mystara and the Hollow World within) are officially moved to
the AD&D 2 rules, and if demand supports, will migrate to D&D3. [Source:

Wouldn\'t be surprising... take, for example, the roswell AFB files,
especially around the "incedent". THey can\'t be found, right? I saw them on
a finding aid for the National Archives\' Archives 2 facility. They are not
in "Records of the US Air Force", nor in "Records of the US Army", nor even
"Records of the US Army Corps of Engineers"... BTW, at the time, recall it
was Roswell Army Air Corps Station... they\'re in "Records of the Army Air
Corps"... So when the army says "We don\'t have them", they\'re right. When
the Air Force says "They\'re Army Records", they\'re right... Oh, BTW, don\'t
bother trying to access them... the finding aid was not classified, but the
records were listed as classified... and there were only some 5 cubic feet
in that collection. Not enough for bodies. Maybe slides, but no telling
from JUST the finding aid...

>would be like...;-)

I\'m PROUD to boast a 0-9 record in that game...8-o

By the numbers:
1) Zhodani. I interpret canon(a dangerous business) pretty much as you
have elaborated.
However, I\'ve always wondered about the Zho\'s apparent omnipotence in
knowledge/
intelligence gathering. Do they really know and can they really plan for
EVERYTHING
that may happen. Ancient Solomani intel orgs had difficulty interpreting
the information
they received from open sources (tv, radio, newspapers and so on)
because there was
simply too much of it. IMTU(dreaming again), this difficulty might lead
the Zho\'s to
miscalculate and over react.

2.Solomani. I don\'t think it would matter very much what the condition
of their economy
is; if they had a reasonable opportunity they would go for it. Its not a
coincidence, after
all, that the 3FFW and the Solomani Rim War (as it is PROPERLY reffered
to) occurred
nearly simultaneously. I can think of a number of real world examples of
nations going
to war even though their economy was in the toilet....

3.Vargr. Yes, they would never work together. Just as they don\'t during
the Rebellion;
they could harass a couple of sectors at best. One Vargr raider would be
as much
trouble as a mosquito. Course, if a couple of thousand mosquitos see a
picnic....

4. The Julian Protectorate. I gotta admit, I completely forgot about
this state; I\'ll have to
do some research on it.

5. K\'kree. These cows go in on the first wave with the Zho\'s. MOO YAH!

6. Hivers. I have to concede this point. They would use manipulation to
deal with the 3I.
However (IMTU dreaming again) would it not be conceivable that they
would send
their neighbors (K\'kree, Solomani) after the 3I instead. They do it with
the Ithus\'

7. Aslan. Ok, here I have difficulties understanding cannon. First off,
we are suppose to
have more female Aslan than males. Then, those males that are not first
born run off and
become Ihatei, "driving their ships to new lands"(Zepplin Rocks!). Does
this not cause a
big depopulation problem? The only fix I can think of is that there must
be an awful lot
of Aslan.

Now then, there is the Treaty of Ftahir. Canon says (correctly) that it
would be very
dishonorable for the Aslan to break the treaty. Ok. When the Rebellion
occurs, it is now
honorable to break the treaty because of the death of ONE (quantity 1)
Aslan? What did
they do before the Rebellion, when I am very sure allot more Aslan died
from all manner
of bad events in the 3I?

So here I am. I guess I got allot of Aslan who can go off at any moment.
Be honest: if killing one can start them across the border, then having
17 die because they ate McDitzie burgers filled with contaminated Kraken
meat at the local Sharushid restaurant should and ought to send them
into Raving Universe Annihilating. Ruu haaaah!

Finally, it should be noted that while the 3I hasn\'t expanded its
borders since the Civil War,
this by no means should be taken as an indicator that 3I is not capable
of extending its
influence and its dominance beyond its borders. Remember: We are told in
cannon that
the Megacorporations in the 3I are larger and have more power than those
outside. IIRC, some of them have territories "in the Imperium and 50
parsecs beyond". And where the
Megacorps are, so goes the Imperuim. And the locals might really, really
despise it. Real world: practically every time the French have a dispute
with America, the local McDonalds in France can expect to get trashed.

Course, having been in a McDonalds in France, I\'d probably...Ohh,  never
mind.

Thanks for the critiques! They inspire me to come up with ideas....uhoh

I suppose the reactions might look kind of "knee jerk."  I suspect if
people had really been reading, they would have noticed that this
statement:

> do with that.  The "Day of Peace" movement is not anti-gun nor anti-free
> speech.  It is anti-violence.

really isn\'t true.  The first activity listed in the initial post was to
have one day "where no gun was fired."  It wasn\'t linked to violent
activity in any way.  It only stated that no one should fire a gun. 
Since that would include not firing a gun for a peaceful and lawful
activity (such as target practice), I can see why the list members would
see it as an anti-gun movement.  I certainly saw it as being "anti-gun."

Bwa-ha-ha-ha and all that. Look at the facts:
- - Captain of the USS Enterprise (the original), the best captain in
Star Fleet: played by William Shatner, a Canadian.
- - Dashing and handsome hot-shot attorney and ex-pilot for the US Navy
in the TV series JAG: played by David James Eliot, a Canadian.
- - Veteran comic actor Leslie Nielsen, a Canadian; his brother Eric used
to be a Member of (the Canadian) Parliament.
- - Oscar-winning film director Norman Jewison: a Canadian.
- - Guy Lombardo, perennial New Years Eve host, even after his death: a
Canadian.
- - Alex Trebek, whose game-show screens American contestants for their
intelligence: a Canadian. (That one is almost sinister when you think
about it...)

And if someone is not a US citizen and wants to work in the US, they
need a "Greene card", named for the patriarch of the Canadians working
in Hollywood, the late Lorne Greene...

Maybe not legally, but if you got it into your head to go to Nevada,
buy a semi-auto gun, and bring it back home to California, what could
possibly stop you? Sure, if/when you finally decided to use it you\'d 
get your butt nailed to the wall on the weapons offence, but that would
be after the fact. That\'s why gun laws at anything less than a national
level are doomed to failure.

The map you URL above extends beyond the old GDW wall-map by
two sectors or more on the rimward, trailing, and coreward sides,
and one sector on the spinward side. Everything in that area is
non-canon. The sector names are pretty wild and divergent also.
Either someone did this map a VERY long time ago or decided to
utterly ignore published sector names, since the only correct names
beyond the Imperial Atlas 5x7 are the Paranoia Press sectors, three
Vargr/Ziru Sirka sectors, Zhdant (Galanglicized to Zhodane), and
a handful of the K\'kree and Hiver sectors. 

 The GDW wall-map was reproduced in a few places. One that I
recall was an early issue of Different Worlds...

A move to 98 might help (then again, it might hurt...)  Most people I\'ve 
spoken to have gotten better system performance, especially on higher end 
machines from 98.  OTOH, some people (especially those lacking memory/HD 
space) got terrible results.... I\'ve been using 98 for a while now and 
prefer it to 95.

Frankly I\'d be surprised if it turned out that Legacy of Heorot or Beowulf\'s
Children had anything to do with the "State", the culture portrayed by the
colonists in Legacy was nothing like that in "State". It was much closer to
"current earth norm".

Having not seen DR, I can\'t comment on that, but if it;s relatd to the other
two, I\'d agree with Doug.

Me too !

We have various levels of medical cover.

"Gold Card" level means the medics will come in with their own fire team and
extract you from a hot zone in order to fix you up. But it\'s expensive !

Silver means they\'ll come and get you as long as it\'s not too dangerous, i.e
there isn\'t a firefight going on.

Standard means you have to get to them.

Economy means not only do you have to get to them, but they\'ll only look at
you if they\'ve get nothing else to do.

Regardless of law level, it\'s probably a Government Type 9 (Impersonal
Bureaucracy), with law level dependent on what types of activities are
subject to fines.  If, as in the examples snipped from the preceding
post, only violence against another sophont is fined (with fines
apparently based on the perceived social value of the victim), then that
seems to be a low law level.  OTOH, if spitting in public (for instance)
is subject to fines (with the amount [for off-worders] possibly based on
the level of quarantine the offender endured prior to the offense [more
quarantine = less chance of infectious disease = smaller fine]), then
that would be a fairly high law level.

Maybe not legally, but if you got it into your head to go to Nevada,
buy a semi-auto gun, and bring it back home to California, what could
possibly stop you? Sure, if/when you finally decided to use it you\'d
get your butt nailed to the wall on the weapons offence, but that would
be after the fact. That\'s why gun laws at anything less than a national
level are doomed to failure.

I\'d tend to argue from the "no ex post facto laws"[1] clause in the
Constitution. I\'d argue that if I can\'t know about the law until
*after* I\'ve violated it, then it is *effectively* an ex post facto law
and therefore not allowed under the Constitution. 

> ***WARNING:  The above is not intended to be construed as legal advice.

Ditto

[1] An "ex post facto" (from the Latin for "after the fact") law is one
that makes illegal actions that occured *before* the law was passed.

The gun store in Nevada wouldn\'t sell it to you, for one. When you buy a
gun, you have to give them ID, and they\'ll say, "sorry, we can\'t sell you
that because it\'s illegal in California." Of course, you could always buy
illegally from a private individual, but you don\'t need to go to Nevada for
that--there are plenty of street corners in LA.

Correct - and due to the frequent requests for it on the list, I\'ve scanned
it, touched it up a bit, printed it out on  11x17 sheets and included it as
an extra in the supplements package... hopefully, it\'ll be helpful for
those who don\'t have tons of old rpg magazines sitting around like I do :)

The thing that makes me suspect this is that it seems to imply  a privileged
reference frame, which at the time they wrote this was not considered
particularly acceptable physics..

While I suspect that what they may have meant is zero kinetic enrrgy
relative to some axes that map the two Alderson points at each end of the
jump, I _think_ this this still implies a privileged reference frame, as I
_think_ it implies that if you can have zero kinetic energy relative to both
of these two points then somehow these two points must also have zero
kinetic energy relative to each other, and how can a "point" in space (as
opposed to a particle) actually have kinetic energy ?

Then again, this sort of stuff is a bit beyond me.

It would make more sense to me if they had said "must emerge at a point that
has the same gravitational  (or "fifth force" ) _potential_ energy"  rather
than actual kinetic energy.

But that\'s probably because it\'s sort of how the drive we wrote for our own
space game worked, you were precipitated out of jump when your "kinetic"
energy was cancelled by the force of the "anti-gravity" well of the star you
were heading for. The higher the gravitational potential energy, the harder
it was to translate, but once translated the "antii-gravity" of the nearest
star, (possibly affected by planets ) accellerated you rapidly away from the
current star, and then you cruised until you hit your target star. If you
missed you\'d keep going until you hit a gravity well capable of stopping
you.  Oh, and you could "bounce off" an "anti-gravity" well if you didn\'t
hit it dead on, and get accelerated away again if you never slowed down
enough to emerge.

What this meant was that the closest to a gravity well you went into jump,
the faster you went, but also the more energy it took to make the
transition. This would seem to imply jump stations on planet would be the
best, but we had the jumpers maintain the kinetic relative to the target
star they had on translation, which meant jumping planet to planet, while
theoretically possible, was too dangerous.

Also, as planet\'s affected your course in jump, it required extremely
accurate knowledge of the target system to aim at a planet, aiming at the
star was a _lot_ easier , and missing by even a little could result in
travelling onward to somewhere else.

So, the use of jump as a weapon was possible but very unreliable, and of
course if you did it to someone , they\'d do it to you.

The other thing we liked was that there was a theoretical upper limit to how
far you could jump from a star, but it was limited by the size of the star
and the amount of power you had, not some arbitrary technology.  All of a
sudden, dense stars took on strategic significance, someone positioned at a
neutron star had a much greater operational range, assunming they could
generate enough power.

Yes, that makes sense.

I\'m a bit mystified by this.

Surely the \'expectations\' are what you expect (i.e. what you are assuming
they\'ll be able to achieve rather than some future event you\'re looking
forward to).

In that case, how can they meet a \'bare minimum\' of expectations?  If
they\'ve met the minimum, haven\'t they \'met expectations\'?  (If only just).



My apologies if this is a stupid question.  I must be good at them.  I just
had my 15 seconds of fame last Thursday when I appeared (very briefly) on
the BBC\'s _Question Time_.  They had just spent 10 minutes debating the
issue of our House of Lords being radically changed.

One lot were arguing that it should be appointed (by the House of Commons -
the \'main\' half of the UK parliament); the other lot were arguing that it
should be by election.  (Some were arguing for a bit of both).

Right at the end of this segment before the \'referee\' David Dimbleby moved
onto another topic entirely, I couldn\'t resist putting my hand up.  Maybe
I\'ve been too long on the Traveller Mailing List but I thought there were
other options.  I asked why no one seemed to be considering competition
(e.g. a group of sportsmen selected by athleticism; exams for academics; a
group of clergy....) or by lottery?  I\'ve never heard the media or anyone
put forward anything like this, so what am I missing?  Why is this not
being considered?  Is it somehow a \'stupid\' idea?

The \'referee\' evidently thought very little of my question as he kind of
dismissed it with the comment: "or elections".

Is it just a failure to think \'outside the box\' or am I thinking of weird
Traveller possibilities and failing to see that in RL this isn\'t feasible?
(I wasn\'t suggesting I had a fully worked out solution, just querying why
no one even brings it up.)

Just curious (and a little embarrassed).

No, since, for the most part, only first sons will be breeders anyway...
And remember, Aslan are Polygamous, not polyandrous (Multiple wives, fine,
Multiple Husbands, no)... so those with the land get to breed, as they can
afford to support a wife. At least pre-space. Then, consider that the birth
rate is supposedly something like 5:2 Female to Male, and typical
landowners will begat 1-3 children on each of 1-4 wives, and you have a
sudden population problem.

Also, since Male Aslan Ego is tied to land, the non-heirs (due to
primogeniture, hehehehe) need land. In order to get useful land, you have
to leave the hierate. In order to properly support wives, you have to have
land.

The aslan shot was a Clan Ambassadore, the (in the aslan view) literal
Honor-Bearer for the whole of his clan. Killing him was, to the aslan mind,
the same as attacking the whole clan, not just the Aslan. Additionally,
said attack was without honor, and there also was no clear emperor to
appeal to for redress.

Aslan view lords AS the government to a certain extent, according to a
variety of sources... hence, no Emperor, No Imperium. No Imperium, No
Treaty of Ftahir.

Thus, you have an entire clan\'s honor slighted, no means of redress without
conflict, and a logical assumption that the "Lord" of the treaty has no
heir, and thus the body he was lord of ceases to be a body...

As for the others, they didn\'t carry the Title of Ambassador for a Clan,
get mowed down without challenge, and then be quietly ignored (I\'ve not
seen any reference to Dulinor sending an apology to the Ambassador\'s Clan
in the cannon); Until a Clear Emperor exists to mediate, Dulinor makes
reparitions or dies, or someone else negotiates a new treaty, that entire
clan has it in for Dulinor.

Think (based upon the early Contact! article in JTAS) of Aslan Honor much
like Feudal Japanese Honor, as portrayed in literature...
	Insult the man, he seeks revenge.
	Insult the family, The who Family seeks revenge
	Insult the Daimyo, and flee his wrath.
	Insult the Emperor, Prepare for war.
	Insult a man\'s representative, and you have insulted

Been reading Cyberpunk/Shadowrun have you?  They both have similar styles

Isn\'t that how part of the Russian parliment is selected?

At least from the point of view of being representatives of interest groups,
I\'d assume that (eg) the farmer\'s representative was a farmer involved in
politics and selected by some sort of election amongst farmers rather than
just being the most successful farmer (however you define that).

The real reason that its a "stupid question (tm)" that no one should be
allowed to
ask is because if you take your system and allow politians to vet the list
and add
their friends, what you have is the current system of selecting the upper
house
in the UK.

The top judges, clerics, industrialists, civil servants, politicians,
actors, unionists, etc are given life peerages.

Too many politicians, perhaps...

I read an article several months ago in that bastion of high-class 
journalism, \'The National Post\' (that\'s sarcasm for you non-Canadians
or for you Canadians who have the good sense to avoid the Post).

It seems that there is a correlation in New York City between 
crackdowns on strip clubs and the direction of \'the market\'
e.g. the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Apparently brokers who do 
poorly get some sort of \'return to the alpha male state\' by 
watching strippers so that they an head back and try again 
the next day as opposed to becoming increasing depressed beta
males and sucking the whole market down with them.

The article explained it about a million times better than I just did.

Anyway, a lot of interesting correlations between two pretty 
isolated behaviours have been proposed over the years. Causation
is somewhat more nebulous in most cases.

I recall tracking down a federal law a few years ago in response to
a similar UFO conspiracy claim, though I don\'t have the exact citation 
anymore. IIRC, the law makes it a felony to enter or interfere with a
spacecraft. While technically this would make climbing aboard that Vilani 
scout ship illegal, the rest of the law makes it pretty clear that it is NASA 
spacecraft they are talking about - the rest of the law talks about the 
illegality of trespassing on NASA facilities and other government launch 
sites.

<OT rant>
Officially, the House of Lords needs to be reformed because it is
undemocratic.  The fact that it seems to  work  better  than  the
House of Commons  is  irrelevant.  Unofficially,  the  reform  is
because the House of Lords doesn\'t always agree with the House of
Commons ... which  I  always  thought  was  the  reason  for  its
existance.  Given Tony Blair\'s track record he\'ll put  forward  a
system of \'democratic\' elections with candidates short listed  by
the House of Commons ... which, since he dominates it at present,
will result in a rubber-stamping institution.

Ah, my old favorite: the Feudal Technocracy (sort of).

The reason its a \'stupid\' idea is that modern  politics  consists
of giving us variations on a theme  and  calling  them  "choice".
Alternative ideas are not welcome.  IMO this is  the  reason  why
many people don\'t vote ... but it is called "voter apathy".

Metaphor: A vegitarian goes to a restaurant.  The main  corse  is
beef or pork.  The vegitarian diner  declines  the  main  course.
The restaurant staff conclude the diner wasn\'t very hungry.  Doh!

I think that was an arbitrary, non-canon placement by Roger Myhre for his
Gvurrdon work for HIWG.  I\'ve never been convinced by it.

The Traveller Adventure says (p. 77): "...Scangen, a planet in the Vargr
Extents just across the frontier."  For the Bannerji/Sternmetal scam to
be worthwhile, then they\'ll want to pick a Vargr world as close to the 
border as possible as the supposed source of the Lewis lanthanum they\'re
passing as Vargr ore.  Bannerji has to be kept idle on Aramanx until his 
ship has burned the time it takes to reach Scangen and return to Junidy;
the longer he has to hide, the longer he has to stay idle, and the less
money they can make on the scam.

If he were going to Scangen, Bannerji would leave the Imperium by way of
Jesedipere (the itinerary in his wallet in the Leedor episode says so, 
and shows every other world on his route).  His ship, _Wolblutn_, is a
jump-2 far trader.  If he has to appear to reach 2937, he either has to
waste cargo space on fuel tankage and make a deep space connection, or
take something like an eight jump detour to get there.  I think 2937 is 
too deep in the Extents; it wastes too much time.

There\'s two candidate worlds within jump-2 of Jesedipere that could be
Scangen; 2840 and 2940.  Both have under 1000 inhabitants; 2840 is a 
lawless company rockball with a class-D starport at tech-6, and 2940 is
a balkanized garden world with a class-B starport at tech-8.

I vaguely remember that _Merchant Prince_ might have a reference to a
company based out of Scangen.  Otherwise, take your pick.  2840 would
make a mining hellhole.  2940 could be a trading center built around a
lanthanum rush, with competing Vargr mining operations controlling bits
of the world, while the environmentalists scream at them to protect the
local ecosystem....  There might also be other references to Scangen in
backstory related to Oberlindes Lines and the _Emissary_ -- I think the
_Emissary_ might be based out of Scangen.  If so, I\'d lean toward the
better starport (2940).

Well, when you get right down to it, you *have* to have a "preferred
frame" if you want FTL *unless* like like messy stuff like time travel.
The equations just don\'t let you have FTL *and* relativity *and* strict
"local casuality". So you need to break relativity. And a preferred
frame is one that does minimal damage if you do it "right".

Sure. "Zero kinetic energy" is a fancy way of saying "at rest". So they
just can\'t be *moving* relative to each other in the fancu co-ordinate
system.

Regarding "Destiny\'s Road" and "The State", I\'m quite certain they\'re in
the same universe.  The thing that makes me think so is that they mention
"proles" and "citizens" (in passing, but still) in DR.  Also, they have
the whole discussion about "Hydraulic Empires" in it, which was also in
AWooT.  I don\'t recall similar concepts in "Legacy of Herot" (sp?) so I
suspect that\'s a different universe.

Note that DR was started several years ago by Niven and only completed
recently (He\'s said something about "The State" being depressing, so maybe
that blocked him :-) . I\'m not sure about the dates, but that may put its
original conception in the pre-LoH era.  Also, DR is written by Niven
alone, not in collaboration with Pournelle or Barnes.

Imperium is a cool idea.  I\'m not sure I see them as joining forces in any
overt way, but certainly people might "jump on the bandwagon" once the 3I
showed weakness.  Personally I think this would quickly result in the
decimation of the 3I as they would be fighting wars on too many fronts. 
	I could see the K\'Kree starting the whole thing simply because
they decide they want to "wipe out the f***ing meat eaters".  Vargr bands
might take this as a good time to do some land grabs.  With forces being
drained away to deal with these problems, the Zhos might see an
opportunity to push the "expansionistic pluralists" back to Corridor and
the Sols might see a chance to regain Terra.  Aslan Ihatei are already
pestering the rimward Marches, they might start making incursions
elsewhere if Imp forces got weak enough.  The Hivers would definately not
join in, IMO.  They might in fact help the 3I in their own particularly
subtle ways... :-)

	This all stretches socio-economic realism, mind you.  But my
general advice is: Don\'t let excessive realism stand in the way of
excessive coolness.  Epic grandeur generally requires stretching reality a
bit. 

	I\'ve always thought a Sixth Frontier War would be cool, with the
Ihatei joining Zho, Vargr and Sword Worlds forces.  That would be a pretty
tough bind for the Marches, IMO.

The official Scangen placement is detailed in DGP\'s Vargr&Vilani alien book.  The
above placement does sound correct, according to the DGP placement (who made
beautiful Traveller maps, covering the entire Imperium, with exact star placement).

Scangen is in the Commonality of Kedzudh, and I do remember that it is in the Firgr
subsector, directly coreward from the Aramis subsector.  Hex number 2937 sounds
right to me, because I remember looking this planet up for Gvoudzon, the Vargr
character in the Traveller Adventure (I used the planet as part of his background
when we played that campaign).

I would look it up for you, but my Trav stuff is boxed up, at the bottom of a
closet, with several boxes laid on top--and I\'m not sure which of the four Trav
boxes I have include that alien module.

But, as I said, that placement listed above does seem correct.  I remember Scangen
being just over the Imperial border, in Vargr space, and very close to the Spinward
end of the Gvurrdon Sector.

It\'s really not too far from the Aramis subsector at all.

Not exactly what you wanted, but I hope it helps.

Kenneth.

I appreciate the advice, but frankly I\'ve heard such horror stories about
Win98 that I won\'t go near it.  I could have gotten it for my Dell system
but I practically begged them for Windows 95 (with which I am very
familiar).  I use Powerdesk98 for some of the things 98 gives you but with a
lot less overhead.

Kiri,

Beautifully spoken, and very Heinlein-esque.  Reminds me of several 
of the discourses on violence in Starship Troopers, actually.  May I 
quote this to a few friends who would appreciate your stance and your 
presentation?

I\'ve been staying out of the voluminous [OT] threads that have been floating
around, but I just have to add

And New York City. People are just a little standoffish here. This is
sometimes misinterpreted as rudeness, but when you are somewhere where some
people won\'t shake your hand for religious reasons, half the people have
foreign accents, your upstairs neighbor comes home at midnight with big
stiletto heels on (at least that\'s what it sounds like) and tourists take
pictures of the entrance to your building you have to build up some sort of
barrier.

ObTrav: The culture of the large economic hubs of the empire appears very
cold and bureaucratic, (typical Vilani), but many smaller worlds/cities/
away from starports people will either be _too_ helpful to the PCs (sounds
nice at first) or snub them for incorrect ear shape, hair color, fingernail
length...

How much does it cost to ship Coke overseas?  I am dreadfully allergic to
corn, and yes, that is what is in Coca-Cola here.  (I love lamb chops, and
Australia is how close to Japan?  Hmmm.... wonder if Hiroshi could be
persuaded to do music promotions in Australia.  Probably not, sigh.)

This does NOT make sense.  How do you get 4 wives in a society with 5
females to every 2 males?  I realize that not everyone can afford to marry
and have children, but I bet prostitution is a really brisk business--
unless the females go into heat, and males aren\'t bothered without the

Heheheheheheh.  My boyfriend\'s family used to be samurai.  Interesting

I\'ve thought this whole House of Lords thing sounded like great fodder for
a Regency-era campaign, where the nobility are losing many traditional perks
and powers.  For instance, the whole bit where the peers were allowed to 
write a 75 word essay on why they should be allowed to continue serving!  

It\'s an interesting story.  Not much air time in the States, though.

Per federal law, you are not allowed to purchase handguns outside your state
of residence.  You are allowed to purchase longguns and shotguns, but the
laws of both states (the state where the purchase is and the state of the
purchasers residence) must be followed.

Of course, even national laws are doomed to failure if enough people act
against it.  How many illegal drugs are imported into Canada?  Remember
Prohibition?

Actually, in my experience that characterization of NYC has been gradually 
receding.  While this description was certainly true of New York in the 
\'80s, more recently, as the crime rate went down, I find NYC to be a much 
nicer place and people to be much friendlier and more helpful.  At least 
this is true for the parts of NYC where I tend to go (mid- and down-town 
Manhattan).  There are still any number of places I won\'t ever go to....

I can\'t say I\'m up on the subject but I think they\'re only (currently)
considering getting rid of the hereditary peers.  i.e. the life peers will
stay for a bit.  (Life?)

In fact, they\'ve even wimped out of getting rid of all the hereditaries by
saying that a certain (small) number of them can stay while they work out a
better system.  Each of them have to \'campaign\' in a statement of no more
than 75 words that say why they should be allowed to stay.  All the
hereditaries (I think) will then vote on who gets to stay.   (Ironically
democratic for them.)  The statements apparently range from the intensely
political, to the lady who says she should stay because she brings flowers
each day and brightens up the house, to those who won\'t write a statement
because they disagree with the process.

OB TRAV: Write a 75 statement for the main participants of the rebellion as
to why they should be Emperor.

Thank you for the encouragement!  I was beginning to wonder.  I guess it

This is very close to my favorite Feudal Technocracy (though, yes, I
know there can be many others). I picture the something like the Nobel
Laureates being the Senate, and creating new positions when they become
necessary. What follows is a small out take from the news service of
a feudal technocracy on a balkanized world which has just discovered
the jump drive. The feudal technocracy, following the rules as I read
them, is one tech level above the TL8 of the other two governments on
the world.

1043/167: Future Lead Archeologist post hotly debated
      Lauk Gasoy was thought to be a sure next choice for Lead Archeologist,
but it seems that once again political considerations loom above scientific
expertise. Gasoy became well known to the public a few years ago after
proving his theories about the Sohogu Empire with key excavations in the
Muboz Mountains. While Aprio has long held that scientific acumen is the
only requirement for peerage in the Council, it appears that several other 
Lead Scientists have taken affront to recent public comments made by Gasoy,
and this may jeopardize his chances for peerage.

Ever since I installed Win\'98 2nd ed., my computer at home freezes about 1
out of 8 times (on average) whenever I start an application. Eek. I\'m used
to working on a Mac OS system at work though, so I\'m used to it. ;-)

Haven\'t tried 2nd ed yet... I have the disk sitting here but I\'m not sure I 
trust Microsoft enough to actually use it....  I tend to wait a minimum of 
6 months until after it comes out before using a MS OS...

Yes they do!  (Or they have done.)  Take a lump of hash, wrap  in
blue paper, write destination on paper  and  add  airmail  stamp,
post.  US to UK no questions asked.  I witnessed the delivery  to
an American in student accommodation.  I can\'t remember the  cost
as it was some time ago ... 1986  ...  but  I\'d  imagine  it  was
standard airmail weight charges.

I assume that the customs officials on both sides are not looking
for drugs going from US to UK as they normally go the other way.

As best as I can tell, there are actually ***three*** Niven series that deal 
with STL travel...

The "Leshy Circuit" (names take from James Branch Cabell\'s fantasy stories) 
included a group of short stories published in the early 70\'s. For a list, 
see "Tales of Known Space".

The "State" stories included "Rammer" (latter "World Out of Time"), and then 
the novels "World Out of Time", and the two "Smoke Ring" novels. (From what 
I\'ve read, Niven was working on a third at one point...don\'t know what 
happened...)

The "Beowulf" stories are "Beowulf\'s Children", "Legacy of Heroet" and 
"Destiny\'s Road". These are different from the "State" stories. These have 
the colony ships being launched by the UN, have hibernation which **almost** 
works (the "State" stories, hibernation could only be overcome by injecting 
your memory RNA into a "wiped" person...not good for the person who was 
getting wiped, icky for your corpsicle...). "Beowulf" and "Legacy" take place 
on the planet with the "Grendel\'s", "Destiny\'s Road" clearly takes place in 
the same universe--see the "prologue" of a statement by the head of the 
UN...but a different planet (one is on a planet of Tau Ceti...can\'t remember 
the other star for the other book...).

All this stuff is good, BTW, but three different universes...

When I moved from Win95 OSR2 to Win98 (1st ed) the number of blue
screens  halved.  Still  bad  though.   Funny  thing  is  I  like
MS Excel and MS IE5.  Linux looks like the way  forward  (when  I
have more time).

I\'ve worked with Linux a fair amount, and while I think it\'s a great OS, 
none of the software I like runs on it...  These days I just use Windows 
NT, which, when configure properly, is very stable and fast.  I only use 98 
for modern games, anything that requires DirectX...

I can\'t wait for Windows 2000 - NT with all the game playing features of 
98  I will of course wait six months for the first round of patches...

I\'ve been running Windows 2000 professional (NT Workstation) for a while now
and am quite pleased.  I\'m now on release candidate 2 and besides having to
do a workaround to install Photoshop 4 I haven\'t found anything that I run
on 98 that it doesn\'t handle.  It seems to run fairly well on a P166 w/64MB
RAM.

I don\'t get blue screens..but I do get mysterious crashes and when scandisk
runs its some Outlook files that are all awry.

FASA Syndrome:  Awesome settings, exceptional artwork, high production
standards, rules that stink like last week\'s kitty litter.

For the last fifteen years this has been FASA\'s strength and weakness..
they can\'t seem to get any good rules for the settings they come up with.
Shadowrun is a great example.. Seattle Sourcebook is in my top three
all-time game products list, but the game itself was almost unplayable.

Earthdawn was another near-miss.. some wonderful ideas (I especially liked
the rules on having to learn about magic items to use them) but will
probably just steal the setting concept for a D&D 3rd campaign next year.

I get loads of GPFs from Windows Explorer ... even when  its  not
running!  I now use the Litestep shell but  still  get GPFs  from
EXPLORER.EXE.  Its almost time  for  the  biannual  reformat  and
reinstall.

That\'s the best news I\'ve heard all day.  Have you tried running any of the 
recent high-end games? (although on a 166 that might not be a great 
idea....)  Anything using DirectX 6 or later?

DR is explicitly in the same universe as LoH/BC.  The Tau Ceti colony and
its problems with local fauna are mentioned early in the book.

People do stop and ask if I need help (I happen to work next to the Garden
where I can pass as many as 12 police officers on the way to my car). I was
saying that people not getting in my face is a good thing. They _ask_ if I
need help. Only one guy was annoying enough to actually help me after I said
"No. Thanks."

I\'ve seen it at more than 80 GBP = 120 USD in the UK. The Companion was 40 GBP.

The whole of the UK(*)has a ban on Semi/Automatics and Handguns. IIRC

Not every Aslan gets 4 wives. The number of wives is related to status.
A lower class Aslan might have one wife, or none, and the wife he has
will be of similar low status. A noble Ihatei could probably get a low
status wife, but wouldn\'t want one - he wants a high-status wife 
(or, preferably, more than one) that he earned the attention of by 
gaining land and glory. 

Many Aslan females don\'t marry at all - they devote themselves to
business or scientific activities, and some hope to increase their
personal status in this fashion and thus be a wife worth earning
the attention of.

AFAIK, no canonical records of Aslan Escort Services exist. Be
warned, the TML has previously discussed the societal impact of
Aslan females in comfy shoes...  ;-)

Kiri, just stock up once a year around Passover - when the Coke
is marked \'Kosher l\'Pesach\' (in Hebrew), it\'s made with sugar,
not corn syrup.  IIRC, Sephardic Jews consider corn and corn
products to be chometz.

Do you read any magazines, etc in the firearms field? At the time there 
was quite a lot of fuss and complaints, with many UK gun owners moving 
their firearms to clubs on the Continent. I suspect that their opinions 
simply weren\'t considered \'newsworthy\' by the mainstream press, etc.

Having tried \'98 on my P133 (32MB) I can say from personal experience 
that for good results you need something bigger for good results. Kinda 
scary considering that NT4 performs at least as well as \'95 on it.

Thanks for the offer but i\'m using MacOS 8.5. I\'m wondering about the 
project to write a paper Traveller version of Diplomacy that Bloo 
suggested!

Probably because gun ownership isn\'t a majority thing over here. 
Admittedly, I don\'t read the firearms press but there was very little 
on it in any of the media.

Definitely nothing on the scale of the pro-fox hunting protests.

If I ever became insanely rich, I think I\'d try to go thru all the
hoops required to buy one of those new Russain (or is it Ukranian?)
BMPs. The ones with the 120mm smoothbore main gun and (I think) several
machine guns. 

Think your range could handle it if I did? :-)

Actually, I\'d see prostitution as being *uncommon*. Remember, the
females are "in charge". And if landless males don\'t "get any" that
just explains why they are so much more agressive.

This leads to an interesting situation as it winds up with Vargr and
K\'kree "territory" in *direct* contact. 

My take is that once that happens, they\'ll forget about everything else
and go after each other. 

Heck, even without an attack on the Imperium, sooner or later the
K\'Kree and Vargr are going to expand to the point where they are in
contact.

Alas, DR is quite firmly in the same Universe as LoH and BC. The colony

You\'re assuming prostitution is something women only do when they have no
other choice.  That\'s not always the case.  Some women like the work.

I wouldn\'t do prostitution, actual sex for hire, but when I was younger I
did wonder if exotic dancing didn\'t beat typing as a way to spend 8 hours.  
Now that I\'m older, I wish I\'d done it-- more money, more time to play
games, and I\'d have made it thru school without loans.

What I wonder is how does the Impire make its money?
IMTU the nobles pay a percentage of the revenue from what
they hold as fief in addition to being responsible for internal

Fiefs include starports, real estate ( held from the Emperor 
not stuff they buy with thieir own money), and mostly the right 
to tax the governments within thier fief.

If it\'s any help I\'ve had Myth II, which uses DirectX 6, running under 
NT4.0 SP4. I was using a P133 with 32MB, which I\'ve since reinstalled 
\'95 on because I-War was unstable under NT :( Aside from I-War and old 
DOS games I\'ve had a much better time with NT than with \'95, and I\'m 
even going to talk about \'98.

Another nice thing about NT is that its video drivers give much better 
control over refresh rates, and they seem to be more stable, as well. I 
use 1024x768, and it flickers under 95 no matter what I do, but under 
NT I had the refresh at 75Hz no problems, no flicker.

	Rumor going around Microsoft may actually be considering porting

(sources: 1, one of the O\'Reilly "Perl" books flat-out states MS is
considering porting Visual Basic for Apps to Unix; 2, comments from
an unnamed source, corroborating 1--why port VB for APPS if you\'re
not porting those Apps?)

The strange story I heard about was that there was a direct correlation
between the number of daiper pins sold each year and the US road toll! It
came up in a short story by (I think) Theodore Sturgeon called "Occam\'s Scalpel"
(a darn good read, too) and I had heard it somewhere else, before that.

I bet the correlation doesn\'t exist now people use disposable nappies.

These oddities just go to prove the old saying:
There are Lies; Damn Lies, and Statistics.

Just because two sets of data appear related dousn\'t mean there is a causual
relationship between them.

OBTRAV: Not much I guess, though you could mine "Occam\'s Scalpel" for an idea or
two.

Having played "The Man" in one convention game, the rule used by the GM was that
high officials may recognise Strephon but "normal" people would not. I assume
the GM rolled against INT whenever appropriate.

Adventure Nugget: following in the "Shoes of the Fisherman" where the Pope gets
out and about - or even just the Digest 9 adventure where "our heroes" throw a
picnic for Iphegenia - how about this: the Emperor decides to travel amonst his
people incognito, and asks the PCs to be his escorts.

You could even do this in the G:T Spinward Marches, simply replace "Strephon"
with "Varian". One of the single-player 76 Patrons is a noble who wants to visit
the seamier side of town - just do a cut-and-paste of this scenario.

  Actually it was covered fairly well - I got repeated doses on the 
subject from reading UK news. Perhaps the main point is that very few
people beyond gun-owners (a decided minority) - and not all of them -
thought that the restrictions were a bad idea.

No gun store with half a brain is going to sell you one. Every time I\'ve been

He\'s still around.  Last I heard, he was putting the finishing touches on the 
new stuff, then we found out that Andrew had died.  Since Andrew was the guy 
who wrote most of this stuff, its current statis is unknown.  I *expect* them 
all to be availiable around Xmas sometime, but don\'t quote me on it.  I don\'t 
work for Cargonaut.

Kiri;

Here\'s a long shot. Ask Coca-Cola if they can send you a batch of "Kosher for 
Passover" Coke. It\'s made with another type of sugar, since corn isn\'t kosher 
during Passover. It should be noted that I\'ve ONLY seen it in US metropolitan 
areas that have large Jewish populations and only in the month before 
Passover...Good luck. 

As an interesting side note Kosher food is getting more and more popular in 
the US. Muslims love it because they know there will be no pork products in 
it, and many non Jews think it\'s cleaner and/or healthier for you. I can\'t 
vouch for this, though I can\'t see a Rabbi signing off on a dirty assembly 
line. They are as tough as a Marine DI inspecting a rack, when it comes to 
inspecting the food prep area for non kosher food remnants...

Was this the first TNE novel?  Or the T4 novel?  There were two TNE novels,
unfortunatly the 3rd was apparently a casuality of the fall of GDW (someone

A standard and well known example of this is the correlation between

This one was published by IG, so I presume it\'s a T4 one (I don\'t remember 
anything in the book being clearly tied to a specific Milieu).

As to quality, I thought it was fairly decent, for a gaming 
novel...  Unfortunately, it very much was a "first of a series" novel, and 
the rest of the series died with the death of IG.

There was a PC version of Diplomacy released 10-15 years back. But it
wasn\'t freeware. And given that one of the big toy/game companies owns
the rights to Diplomacy, there *can\'t* be a "freeware" version. Any
version is either with the copyright/trademark holder\'s permission (and
*not* freeware!) or it\'ll be an illegal copy.

Ask the folks who tried distributing "freeware" versions of Monopoly
back in the 80s.

Then you get a friend who lives in Nevada to buy the gun for you. There
is still nothing that will physically prevent you from bringing the gun 
across the Nevada/California state line, which is the point I\'m trying to
make. Try bringing it across the US/Canada border into Canada, on the

Wow, you *really* missed my point... we aren\'t talking laws here, we\'re
talking about being able to take an object from one US state to a 
neighbouring US state without being stopped for inspection at the state
line. And as long as people can do that, one state\'s gun law is not going
to have the desired effect on the availability of guns in that state.
This is why, for instance, Washington DC\'s gun-control laws have not had
much discernable effect.

Not personally. But alcohol is easy to make -- I\'ve done it myself (my

No effect on the law abiding citizens.  For example, you may only take 
possession of a purchased handgun (of any make, model, action, or caliber) 
in the state you live in.  You can _purchase_ the weapon from anyone or any 
dealer in any state, but to legally take possession you must have it sent 
to a local FFL holder in your state to do the paper work.

Then you have California and Maryland.  California laws are plainly silly, 
asinine, and senseless, but they are the laws of the state.  Maryland on 
the other hand has a list of handguns that they will allow you to 
purchase.  Want a Smith and Wesson SW99?  You won\'t get one in Maryland 
until next year, yet you can get the Walther P-99, essentially the same 
weapon except for some cosmetic changes and different spring weights, at 
any dealer that will stock it.

Gun control laws do work, but only when they are enforced.  The AG in 
Maryland is starting to come under fire for proposing new restrictions when 
it has been found out that his office has rarely prosecuted on any of the 
existing laws.

Repeal the asinine laws we have, get sensible legislation in place, and let 
me arm myself to the same level as the military since as a citizen, I am 
part of the "militia"!

I can buy a world of size 2 having a type 6 atmosphere.  That just needs

Can anyone explain to me how a world of size 2 can have a hydrographic

Anyone have any insights?  I need to figure out what to do with these

He\'s printing them in every spare moment - just finished the Imperial

It\'s getting close folks, and I am trying to get as many printed before I
leave home on a trip for three weeks in December. More updates as I mail
them out (in batches of 15) starting next weekend. 

I\'ve dedicated the Imperial Calendar and Reavers\' Deep Sector Sourcebook to
J. Andrew Keith -- just heard back from Bill Keith and he seemed pleased. I
also offered to pass on any condolences the TML might wish to send - he was
*VERY* receptive to that idea - so - send \'em and I\'ll see that Bill gets
them.

Before I forget - below are the final page counts on the supplements.

I actually can\'t find any reference to Scangen there.  I did find that 
_Emissary_ is based out of Pandrin (Gvurrdon 2240).  The map for 5FW 
agrees with this; it also shows the worlds Balent (Gvurrdon 2340), 
Uthith (Gvurrdon 2339) and Gireel (Gvurrdon 2338).  V&V claims that
Uthith is at Gvurrdon 2703, but that\'s almost certainly a typo since
that\'s the same as its hex number on the 5FW board.  The 5FW hex number
has nothing to do with any sane sector hex numbering system -- 5FW 2703  
is the same as Gvurrdon 2339 on the board.

I still don\'t like 2937 as the answer, but there isn\'t much counter
evidence either.  Sigh.

Bit of a minor scandal here in New England a few years back.  A young woman 
put herself through Brown University that way (exotic dancing).  Once she 
got her degree, she wrote a book about it.  FYI, for those not familiar 
with US Universities, Brown is one of the "Ivy League" schools.

Modern Gothic Horror author Poppy Z. Brite made her living that way in 
Atlanta for a few years before she made her living  writing books.

ObTrav:  The T4 book has a series of adventure plates (full paged pictures) 
about a young Nobel traveling with a band.  The band is actually backup for 
a famous exotic dancer.  (ok...so it\'s a stretch...most ob-travs are...)

If you look back in the last thirty or so Digests 1260-> (which I\'ve 
read since returning from a short break away this weekend) Paul 
Sanders posted something about renaming an asteroid (or another 
celestial body) in the Faldor module after J Andrew Keith. To me this 
would suggest that he is continuing with this project. I hope (1) he 
has some copies left and (2) I can get the cash to order one set.

You shouldn\'t be getting any at all.  The prime culprit for those is the
video driver.  Some of them don\'t work in Windows 95 without a tweak or two.
For instance, one card from Matrox I used sets itself at "optimal" which was
causing me Blue screens right and left.  When I experimented and set it for
"adapter default" they went away.

Another thing could be shared DLLs left over from un-installs.  Those will
flake out your system too.  Your plans for a FORMAT will clear this up.  In
fact Microsoft itself advises a yearly formatting and re-installation of
windows.

Another thing could be any odd 16-bit programs that don\'t like windows (or
that windows don\'t like).  Windows is a primarily 32-bit operating system
(noted exceptions gdi.exe and user.exe which are STILL 16-bit).  I have read
that some 16 bit applications will cause system instability.

I have read (and now own) Shadowrun, yes.

But we came up with this before Shadowrun came out, way back in the very
early eighties, and we actually based it on a couple of things mentioned in
the Car Wars supplements a freind had.

Heck, we even had our own game that was remakably like Shadowrun , based
around the  "Grimjack" stories before any of opur group actually boought
Shadowrun.

Makes perfect sense based upon AM: Aslan [GDW]. Of the 5, 1 male will
either become a vassal, an artist or outcast (who are socially "Neuter", in
a sense, and not good mates), or find work away from the lands... Of the
females, about 2 in 5, IIRC, go into buisiness. Typical aslan families are
supposedly 2-3 children per wife. with an average of 3 wives, that puts 7
children, generally an heir, a spare, enough daughters to take over the
family buisiness(es), and a spare, plus a couple of extras. IIRC, it is
mentioned both in the Contact! article and AM1 that only half of female
aslan get married, and fewer than that in the males...

Another thing is that the sexual cycles are not discussed in either the
Contact! article nor the CT AM1 Aslan module, other than to mention
duration of gestation, live birth, and in-vivo gestation.

Aslan gender-based roles, however, are explicit. Males are doers, fighters,
and button pushers... real technical expertise is for women, as is
buisiness acumen. Even military ships will have females aboard (usually the
Exec is the Captain\'s wife) for the appropriate jobs. Outcasts and Artists
can break this mold with litle social penalty, but in so doing also
separate themselves form mainstream Aslani society. Also, Aslan are
Culturally Imperialistic... An aslan who is not living an aslan life is not
an Aslan... but a human who lives the aslan life, speaks Trokh, and duels
IS Aslan.

Apparently (and I\'m sure many  people  will  correct  me  if  I\'m
wrong) not all Unixes are created equal.  When looking round  the
MS website about 6 months ago I found IE4 had been ported over to
HP Unix and Sun Unix (IIRC) but the site stated  explicitly  that
these 2 versions would *not* work with Linux.  From this I  would
conclude that MS are interested in expanding  their  empire  into
other *non-competing* OSs ... but to port to Linux would  be  bad
for Windows (and thus unlikely).

Wow!  I have a Matrox Millenium II set to "optimal" ...  I  shall

I was using the Matrox Millenium (I) or original.  PCI with 4megs ram.

And people look at me strange when I tell them I *prefer* Linux!!!  It\'s 
*very* stable for me, even with my best efforts to rilly screw it up.  About 
99% of the problems I *DO* get are from canned software having incompatible 
libraries when they got built, but if I can get hold of the source, a quick 
make dep; make; make install; make install_man tends to fix that.

As for full-blown installs, I\'ve done a few of them in the last couple years, 
mostly when I upgraded my distribution or did something *totally* stoopid 
like work on the machine after i\'d been up 30 hours or so.  I\'m still running 
Red Hat 4.1 on one of my HDs, and that\'s almost 2 years old now.  Still 
works, even though mostly I use the SuSE 6.1 distribution until I get around 
to installing the new Red Hat 6.0 distro I picked up last week dirt cheep...

DOS is 16 bits, and no matter how you cut it, Win95 is still just a GUI shell on top of DOS no matter what Microsoft\'s marketting people try to tell you.  It\'ll work with 32 bitsokay, but yeah, you\'ll have problems with 16 bit programs that \'break the rules\', i.e., aren\'t fully compatible with the published API.  And FWIW, Microsoft Windows wasn\'t compatible with the API when it first came out.

They tell me that Win98 did away with the old 16 bit compatibility mode, though I wouldn\'t know about it; I\'ve never played with Win98, and there has been *no* Microsoft software on my machine in about a year now.  YMPWV.

This is what I meant.  And as far as I know about Win98, it still uses a
16-bit gdi.exe and user.exe.  What these do is seriously limit what you can
run on your system.  If your gdi or user resources are low, but you have 128
megs free, you still can\'t scan that photo or burn that CD without problems.
You\'ll get messages like "Out of memory" and be wracking your brain trying
to figure out what the hell is up with that.  The only way to reclaim user
and gdi resources is to reboot the machine.  Memory defragmenters will not
help.

Accurate to a point.  BUT...

The Aslans didn\'t sign the Peace of Ftahalr until the Imperials started fighting \'honorably\' in the Aslan\'s eyes.  The death of their Clan Abassador in the Emperor\'s Chambers the day the trigger was pulled affected *only* that clan.  And it could be argued (and *was* argued by Dulinor) that the assassination attempt against the Emperor was an attempt to succeed Strephon by the Right of Assassination.  In Aslan eyes, this could be seen as an \'honorable\' thing for a *human* to do, and it was just bad luck their Ambassador was there during the attack.  Dulinor declared that such was his intention, to *replace* the Emperor.  The only \'sticking\' point was that according to the Right of Assassination was there was no provisions for declaring him Emperor if there were any other claimnants for the Throne.

Now, it\'s not known if Jaqueline had any other heirs when *she* was gunned down way back when, since her entire immediate family died with her.  But her assassin succeeded her.  Cleon the Mad didn\'t have any heirs when he got whacked.  There were *bound* to be spurious claims to the Throne that got set aside by the Moot.  Why didn\'t Dulinor stick around and let *them* decide?  Odds are, they would have found in his favour, since Varian and Lucan weren\'t in the direct line of succession, merely alternates who would have gotten further and further from the Throne as Strephon\'s kids produced more heirs.

Finally, the very same Clan whose Ambassador died when the hammer fell ended up becoming *VERY* close to Craig of Daibei, which implies that Craig had Aslan help defending Daibei against the Solomani.  Interesting stuff, eh?

Linux is a free Unix workalike.  No way in *HELL* is M$ gonna port anything to it if they can help it.  If they could figure a way to do it, they\'d probably *kill* Linux and save the world for untruth, injustice, and the corporado way of life.  <grin>

There was a PC version of Diplomacy released 10-15 years back. But it
wasn\'t freeware. And given that one of the big toy/game companies owns
the rights to Diplomacy, there *can\'t* be a "freeware" version. Any
version is either with the copyright/trademark holder\'s permission (and
*not* freeware!) or it\'ll be an illegal copy.

Ask the folks who tried distributing "freeware" versions of Monopoly

11 - Hideki (Admiral Hideki Morimotu)
- -2080 to -2018
reigned -2029 to -2018

Having seized the centre of power and emasculated the Council of Noble
Officers, Hideki was forced to deal with the regional and provincial powers
in order to secure the throne. During his rule, the provincial Naval
commanders forced Hideki to reconstitute the Council of Noble Officers as a
body with somewhat more clout than he had envisaged.  furthermore, the
Council was now composed almost exclusively of provincial commanders and
governors, forever breaking the power of the General Staff at the highest
levels of Imperial politics.

Hideki survived no less than nine recorded assasination attempts during his
rule before dying of heart failure in -2018.  After his death, the rumour
that his demise was the result of a tenth, successful attempt persisted.


(Vidmar) (Vice-Admiral Vidmar Kulkinski)
- -2059 to -1973
anti-Emperor -2028 to -1973

While Hideki\'s coup was successful in the fact that it ended with him on the
throne, he was unable to wholly eliminate opposition on Hub/Ershur.  A small
number of relatively junior General Staff oficers managed to flee, and were
joined by other discontents as they established a \'government-in-exile\'
outside the Imperial borders in the Ley Sector.  The following year the
survivors formed their own Council of Noble of Officers and elected Vidmar
Kulkinski as \'true Emperor of the Rule of Man\'.  This government-in-exile
was a fairly palrty thing, and lived under the constant threat of
elimination by Hideki.  It was saved only by Hideki\'s need to come to terms
with fractious provincial leaders, some of whom gave covert aid to the
\'anti-Emperor\'.  While scholars today discount the legitmacy of Vidmar\'s
claim, it is leant some legitimacy by the actions of subsequent Emperor\'s to
\'reform\' the anti-Emperors (also known as the not-Emperors, Little Emperors
and petty-Emperors).

12 - Elize (Admiral Elize Papete)
- -2064 to -1997
reigned -2018 to -1997

As Governor of Trans-Zarushagsar Province and Viceroy of the Verge Worlds,
Admiral Papete was one of the more powerful  leaders of the slowly
splintering Rule of Man.  During Hideki\'s rule, Elize largely governed
Trans-Zarushagaar as an independant state, paying little attention to the
central government on Hub/Ershur.

Following Hideki\'s death, the Council chose Elize to succeed him, knowing
all too well that her rule would continue to encourage the centrigual
tendencies that had characterised the last half-century of hte Rule of Man.
Elize herself looked upon the Imperial throne as a largely ceremonial title,
and spent much of her time in her provincial capital (Elize retained the

Heh!

We used to have a sign up in our office:

Even Linux is pretty well fragmented...you have RedHat, SUSE, Slackware,
then there\'s the issue of intel vs. alpha vs. PPC...

For most of the cool applications stuff, unfortunately linux tends to mean
the Next Microsoft: RedHat Linux for x86...:-(

None of the apps like Word Perfect, Star Office or the like run on Linux
for the PPC ofr example, even though _all_ it would require is simply
recompiling the damn things.

Kiri, you might try buying some Coke from Canada.  We use plain old
glucose (of cane extract presumably) to sweeten it here.  I remember
noticing that Coke in the southern US was sweetened with various "corn
derivitives" and wondering if they always use locally available sweeteners
in different parts of the world (sugar beets?  ewwwww...). 

As for correlational stats, one thing I\'ll always remember is the
assertion by my most recent stats teacher that "A .2 or .3 correlation
means nothing, that\'s just the background correlation of the universe". 
So Douglas Adams was right, there _is_ a fundamental interconnectedness of
all things!  Just to give another example of this sort of folly, there
is a significant positive correlation between violent crime and ice cream
sales.  There is a good reason for this if you think about it, but I\'ll
leave that as an excercise for the reader... :-)

Not at all.  Having made the trip from AK to the lower 48 through Canada
many times, getting stuff through that border is child\'s play.  Inspection?
Hah!  the border guard asked me if I had any firearms, I said no, and they
waved me through.

A trip to Home Despot and a few hand tools are all it takes to make fully
automatic subguns.  Look up the Sten gun.

[From GURPS Traveller, page 59 (sidebar):]

    "Admiral Hiroshi Estigarribia, the commander-in-chief of the Terran
Navy, realized that the [Terran] Confederation government could not
possibly control the vast territories of the [former Vilani] Imperium. 
He proclaimed himself regent of the Vilani Imperium and protector of
Terra, with both states united in the Rule of Man.

    "...Upon Estigarribia\'s death, his chief of staff succeeded him and
crowned himself Emperor Hiroshi II.  Estigarribia did not actually
assume the crown, but his government is known as that of Emperor Hiroshi
I."

Sorry; no mention is made of the spouses/consorts (if any) of either
Hiroshi....

<snipped>

	That\'s an interesting way of putting it.  On the other hand,
	there are a few issues to be considered.  A statistical
	correlation can be computed for most any two variables,
	an it will rarely be zero (indicating no correlation), even
	when the variables are entirely unrelated.  This is due to
	random variation in the variables.  Of course, if the
	variables are related, the computed correlation will tend
	to be farther from zero.  The statistical question is then
	"what is the probability that I could have found a
	correlation this strong if, in fact, there is no
	relationship between these variables?"  For typical samples,
	a correlation of 0.2 to 0.3 would not be uncommon when the
	variables are unrelated, but for very large samples even a
	correlation of 0.1 might be statistically significant.
	Whether such a relationship is significant to anyone will
	depend on the variables and the reason for the analysis.

I refuse to answer the question, Your Honor, on the grounds that I may
incriminate myself.

ObTrav:  How common is the non-self incrimination right in planetary law?
Is it a low law level concept, high LL concept, or does it span both?
Is it allowed in Imperial Law courts?

Ah well.  What kind of a last name is Estigarribia?  I just am still

the Emperor Hiroshi!

hydrographics is 2d6-7 + atmosphere (not size)

so "nature" just rolled another 11.

IIRC, hydrographics was modified by _atmosphere_, not _planetary size_.

I think the rolls were:

Diameter: 2d-2
Atmosphere: 2d-7+Diameter
Hydrographics: 2d-7+Atmosphere

So, in the above case, you\'d need to roll 11 or 12 on 2d6.

Also, GDW sometimes applied  arbitary  modifiers  to  sectors  to
change the "flavour" ... like DM +1 on population  rolls  on  all
worlds in the Solomani Rim (for example) to indicate it had  been
settled a long time.

Actually, on the face of it, that\'s not really all that strange a
correlation. Color choice is a serious business; on big ticket items like
automotive manufacturing lines, adding the wrong color to the mix can cost
millions, so they hire people whose job it is to scout out new color
preferences.

Womens underwear (and other, lowcost, almost disposable items) are where
color preference \'experimentation\' takes place by consumers; if a new
color starts becoming more and more popular, it\'ll will show up there
first. This is where the \'color scouts\' look for emerging trends.

Why this means we don\'t have black, lacy cars, I don\'t know ;-)

We are allowed to wear rings provided that they are not clearly for

A few people - mainly farmers - are allowed to use shotguns.

We are allowed to use airguns.

If we are found to be carrying even permitted weapons in public then the
police can charge us with carrying offensive weapons, although they have to

There are a significant number of people in prison in the US today who
have:

Not been told what crime they\'ve committed
Not been allowed to confronmt their accusers
Not been allowed to examine, or even know what evidence has been used
against them
Not allwed to be present when the indictments were presented to a secret
court and a secret judge.

All in the name of \'National Security\'

Immigration law colliding with so-called \'National Security\' BS is an evil
thing. Particularly when the people who this is happening to were
originally offered asylum in the US, and when/if they\'re deported, it will
be to a firing squad, _if_ they\'re lucky.

What Glenn is describing is a simple totalitarian oppressive dictatorship
or oligarchy, depending on how many people are on top. It could be a
simple low law level thugocracy like Somalia, or parts of Russia.

IN this system, in fact, NO law ever needs to be enacted, since the
enforcers need none to detain or convict anyone. The people with the
biggest/most guns win the argument.

I\'ve toyed with the idea of something along parallel lines (though not the 
same; the two could be combined). Through history, \'guilty until proven 
innocent\' is much more common than the reverse. A society could extend this 
in an extreme way: all citizens are assumed to have committed some crime 
that the government has not yet learned of. Thus, they can be detained 
and/or searched at the whim of the police as the person is obviously guilty 
of some criminal act. Of course, those in the government would, for the most 
part, have to be assumed \'guiltless\' (or at least as one rose in the 
heirarchy, one proved oneself less guilty).

Combine this with secret laws at your own risk ...

I always assumed "Estigarribia" was meant to be Spanish.

FWIW, in the G:T Solomani Rim book I plan on claiming that Hiroshi
I was originally Peruvian.  There are a lot of Japanese immigrants in Peru,
with mixed Japanese-Spanish names. . .notably the current President
(Alberto Fujimori).

You\'re the second person to claim that.  I wonder if it was a common
misconception or something.  Might explain how the Supplement 10
data got this way. . .

LBB 3, page 12, step 2-D: "Generate hydrographic percentage.
2D-7+planetary size (size 0 or 1 requires hydrographic 0; Atmosphere
0, 1 or A+, DM -4)."

Aha.  I wondered if this weren\'t the case. . .the Solomani Rim
worlds certainly tend to be high-population with a fairly consistent
high tech level.  The possibility is one reason why I posted -- I
wondered if there wasn\'t a well-known explanation for this.

Can anyone verify that a similar modifier was applied to the
hydrographics on the Solomani Rim?

The Terrans probably carried the idea from the
American/European model of the social contract that
they brought into space.  On the other hand, the
concept probably does not mesh well with Vilani
culture, where protection of the individual from the
state is a foreign concept.  So that\'s a good
question, but the answer is elusive.

>Is it a low law level concept, high LL concept, or

The higher the law level, the greater the level of
governmental intrusion on personal affairs and the
greater the level of corruption.  Lower law level
societies therefore provide more formal safeguards to
individuals against the state.

>Is it allowed in Imperial Law courts?

Not in my Traveller Universe, unless the person
asserting the right is a noble.

That is true, but it\'s usually the other way around.  (It always kills me
to hear Japanese names pronounced as though they were Spanish.  Then again
I\'ve often said that if one more person calls me "Carrie" they will think
I\'m telekinetic after all!)  Well, he could just as easily be from
California.  There are many persons of mixed descent here.

Kiri  =)  not Keri, Kerry or Carrie

"Supeingo ga wakarimasen, dammit!"  (overheard by Hiroshi, muttered under
Kiri\'s breath, as the third little old lady of the day has refused to
believe that Kiri does not speak Spanish, really, really, sorry, even if 
she does have coal black hair and live in a Latino neighborhood.)

one fun one would be to have the experimental drive component result in

Assuming, of course, that you identify with the hero.  I usually don\'t, at

There\'s another reason for Moslems \'liking\' Kosher food - Moslem
\'halal\' is in many ways similar to kashrut, although some of the
more arcane standards are relaxed. Most imams will, if made to
understand that halal foods are not available in an area, approve
kosher as an acceptable alternative.

The reverse is not true, however.

Hmm..One of the planets in the book, "Healer", by F. Paul Wilson used this.
One could even buy any type of drugs or pornography provided one didn\'t hurt

Actually a full-auto SMG such as the old Sten Gun is very easy to make, 
especially if you\'re not too concerned about its lifespan or accuracy. 
In a SMG even rifling is optional if you\'re really short on facilities 
and/or time. Also note that the Afgans were making accurate (in terms 
of being very similar, not in terms of hitting things) copies of AK47\'s 
using simple simthies, files, etc.

Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn\'t. It seems to depend on the 
version of DirectX. Apparently MT has a form of DirectX in it, and 
presumeably it was good enough to run Myth II. I can\'t remember whether 
DX6 installed or not, but I\'m pretty sure DX5 did.

Casings are optional - you can simply make a fuller wooden stock. 
Volume production of rifled barrels would be the choke point, IMO, 
especially of you\'re making longarms. Pistol and SMG barrels, being 
shorter would be much easier to rifle. Another choke point would be 
good springs, but a single shot weapon would only need one or two, and 
a simple SMG a couple more.

BTW apparently high quality prybars make quite good barrel material. 
Also note that a full-auto only blowback SMG is easy to manufacture 
than a semi-auto pistol or rifle.

This is the part of the argument I have never understood. I mean, isn\'t it
supposed to be "_organised_ militia"?? I mean, Switzerland has an organised
militia, they have military weapons at home, and it seems to work rather well.
This doesn\'t appear to be the case in the US.

However, I don\'t think you would be able to put the genie back in the bottle:
too many weapons are already out there, and the population is MUCH larger than
Sw and less tolerant of regulation. I mean "life, _liberty_, and the pursuit of
happiness" has been used to justify your democratic right to get killed in a
crash because you don\'t want to wear a seatbelt!?!?!

ObTrav: different Law Levels, natch. Examples:
1.   At least one Aussie has been arrested and refused entry to Greece for
carrying Panadene. Over there, codeine can only be given out with a doctor\'s
scrip, whereas here you can buy it over the counter.
2.   One lady was refused entry to Canada because she had been convicted of
drink driving in Oz (she had pleaded guilty and received a stiff fine and lost
her licence). Canada wouldn\'t allow her entry because she was a "convicted
criminal"! Let\'s see your PC\'s stew over THAT one!

Actually, the US does have an \'organized militia\'.  It\'s called the National Guard, and is probably fairly close to what the founders wanted, since they were more states-rights people than democrats per se, and the national guard is under the control of individual states (and does, incidentally, have military equipment).  However, the second amendment is subject to multiple different interpretations; in particular, it is not obvious that the right to bear arms is _limited_ to the creation of a \'well-ordered militia\'.

It\'s been a few months since I was last on the list, but now I am back,
for better or worse. Looking forward to entertaining discussions, but
this time more on topic than the last large debate I was involved in.
So, no politics this time, I\'ve read that in the FAQ   :-)

The list seems healthy. I subscribed a few hours ago, and I\'ve already
got a bunch of mails in my Inbox. A good sign I hope.

Right now I am working on understanding FF&S2 properly. The errata helps
a lot, and I also got myself a copy of the Definite Sensor Rules (Bruce
A. Macintosh). I read the book over and over, making a list of the
proper order of the design steps, and what parts of the books are in
error. Still, it\'s a nice book. Even nicer with lots of ink marks in
it...  :-)

So, hello again everyone.

Wow, I might actually know the answer (since I only just read George Herbert\'s
"Law in the Imperium" article in Challenge).

There are High Justice and other Imperial-level crimes, recognised crimes, and
planetary crimes. Imperial courts (subsector/sector level) only hear the first.
They allow extradition/deportation for recognised crimes, but only if the planet
actually has the crime noted ("recognised") in their legal system. The last
level is up to the planet, and the Imperium won\'t help send someone back to face
a planetary charge (there are always bounty hunters, however...).

With Imperial-level crimes, ther is no restriction on evidence. The person can
incriminate themselves, info can be gleaned second-hand, from wire-taps,
whatever. It is up to the court whether it accepts or rejects each piece of
evidence (and the article even included MT tasks for presenting evidence).

As to planetary jurisdictions, it\'s up to you. After all, each member world is
free to govern itself, right? Some might use the familiar prosecution-defence
model (with or without a jury), some might use the Napoleonic (European)
accusatory model, and so on.

These are all based loosely on my rl experiences building a large
distributed computer-controlled heating, ventillation, and air
conditioning (HVAC) system. 

* Telltale bulbs are shoddy; one or two burn out every day.  Engineer
  gets twitchy from scanning areas and not seeing greens where she
  expects them...wonders if it\'s the green burned out, or the yellow,
  or...

* Readouts are hard to read, unstable, or require special handling to
  use.  Analog gauges might require a tap on the side or a slight shake to
  settle to true readings.  Digital readouts disappear or go to all 8s at
  unpredictable times.  Maintenance and repair tasks become a level harder
  and take twice as long.

* A \'routine\' wiring repair turns weird when an unknown component is found
  behind a panel.  It\'s an old, battered-looking circuit box with various
  cables recognizable as power and data to various systems, along with two
  unlabled ones nobody has ever seen before, clamped onto a series of
  rusty-looking terminals.  The box isn\'t mentioned on the maintenance
  contractors\' records.  Prying it open in place (which risks dislodging
  one or more of the poorly-attached cables) reveals a set of primitive
  power conditioning and surge protection circuits...a function which
  should already be handled elsewhere in the wiring.  Emphasis on the
  *should*...

* ...because power spikes start showing up in the ship\'s grid, at
  unpredictable branches and times.  Mostly they just burn out lights
  and trip breakers, but there\'s always that worry that one of the
  breakers will be familiar with Murphy\'s Law.  Eventually, it turns
  out that the spikes happen only when the door to the captain\'s
  fresher is opened or closed.

What I meant was that people from Peru usually have Japanese last names,
Spanish first names.  Just like Japanese Americans in America often have
English first names.  Of course you do in America meet people named Kenji
Schwarz and Kiri Morgan, so it could also be reversed in Peru.  It\'s just
that combos like Linda Nagata, Keith Yamamoto, Jane Otsuka, are much more
common than combos like Kenji Schwarz and Kiri (not CARRIE dammit) Morgan!

Nobody with a name like that is what I think of as U-S-of-A American!  But
I do understand what you mean.  Of course there\'s no reason to think at

I have once used a very interesting punishment system in a campaign. On
a high-tech, fairly unremarkable law, the PCs ship got stolen and taken
for a ride that ended in a crash, rendering it unusable. They went to
the local court of law, bringing the thief (who survived by leaving the
ship using a grav-belt) with them, hoping for an easy method of payback.

What happened later was a large source of frustration for the PCs. The
court found out that the thief had a small starship of his own. They
therefore ruled that since the thief had wrecked the PCs craft, the PCs
got to choose between wrecking the thief\'s ship or claiming it as their
own. They complained loudly, since the ship they would get was a lot
less expensive, and they wanted money to make up for their loss. The
court complained about their time being wasted, and the PCs eventually
had to leave, now as owners of a primitive trading vessel.

Oh, and one more thing. When they wanted to leave the system, their
takeoff permit was delayed a few hours, as per the court\'s instructions.
This was the punishment for wasting the time of the court.

I doubt that they will ever go to that system again :-)

I case you haven\'t figured it out, the whole story was partially
designed to remove the PCs ship (rather high tech and powerful) from the
campaign in a way that wouldn\'t upset the storyline. Turned out to be
really funny...   *wicked grin*

I\'m going with the government edubabble -- sorry, but my brain isn\'t up to
translating all the time.

Roughly, level 3 is fully meeting all expectations for a student in that
course. Level one is meeting a bare minimum of expectations: more mistakes,
poorer vocabulary, and so forth, but still enough work successfully done to
give them the credit.

The problem, of course, is coming up with exactly _what_ the expectations
are: something the government has not done, even though they have been
loudly claiming that they have standardized expectations. For example, my
department spent hours writing the expectations for a grade 9 science lab.
Parents loved it: nice and detailed, clearly lays out what we expect, and
so forth. Problem is that other schools use different standards, because
the government hasn\'t provided any.An inner-city school might have decided
that some of our level 1 items were in level two (or even three): without
going through the 74 different marking points you wouldn\'t know what the
differences were.


Leaving aside all elements of standardization, supposedly _every_ student
who gets a credit can perform every required level one expectation -- or
not, because the government is still deciding how to take a whole series of
individual marks and produce and agregate summation.


ObTrav: How do people handle professional qualifications?  The original
Traveller had, for example, Medical-3 making the character a doctor
automatically. While fast and simple, having spent some time trying to get
qualifications recognized in other parts of the same country (let alone in
other countries), I think the following might be more interesting:

Rather than a character automatically getting a qualification if they have
a certain skill, they must pass a test. In some cases (eg. graduating from
a professional school) this happens during character generation. After CG,
a character must "write the test" to get the qualification.

Some qualifications will _only_ be available to characters studying them
formally. This may reflect the esoteric type of skill, or may be simple job
protection on the part of the official licensing body. (For example,
Ontario paramedics must study in Ontario: the colleges no long administer
competency exams for out-of-province paramedics, because that reduces the
jobs available for their graduates.)

Some qualifications will be available for characters who have studied
formally elsewhere, on simple reciprocity. (Eg. engineering credentials
between provinces.)

Some qualifications will be available to characters who have studied
formally elsewhere, and who also pass a skill test. (Eg. nursing in Canada.)

Some qualifications are available to anyone who can pass the test. (Eg. a
driving license.)


Naturally, the test may have little relationship to the actual skill, or
the successful candidate may simply be lucky, or good at taking tests,
or...  This leaves the referee free to hit the players with an engineer who
could pass all the written exams, but can\'t deal with real parts in an
emergency; a medic who can pass the multiple-choice exam yet faints at the
sight of blood, or a medic who is more skilled than a doctor but doesn\'t
have any formal qualifications...


Exactly _which_ catagory a qualification/certificate falls into is,
naturally, dependent on the setting and the referee.

Assumign that you like my idea, what qualifications would be recognized
across the Imperium? Which ones would be purely local?

Some of my Jewish friends concur with this. Another who\'s a microbiologist

I tend to agree with the microbiologist.

That\'s certainly true.  However, there are usually enough movies where I

I wasn\'t thinking mass production.  More of one at a time kind of 
thing.  Besides, if we are talking about a criminal scenario, rifled 
barrels are not as necessary anyway, since short-ranged weapons are 
probably more usefull...

That\'s true.

ObTrav: The PCs are crashlanded on a planet with no hand weapons 
(admittedly, an unlikely scenario) and just the gear on their 
ship.  Hostile lifeforms (sentient or otherwise) are a factor.  How 
easy/hard is it to manufacture some non-military grade guns with just the 
resources of a trader or scout?

If Dulinor had stuck around, and was willing to abide by the Moot\'s

Here\'s another twist on that - what happens when a planet refuses to 
recognize an Imperial accreditation for religious or social reasons?  (I 
don\'t mean from a political point of view, obviously the Imperium can 
squash them into recognizing it, but generally the PCs won\'t be able to 
bring that kind of force to bear).  For example, if doctor\'s licenses are 
Imperium issued, what happens when a PC doctor tries to treat someone on a 
planet where certain techniques are outlawed for religious reasons?  The 
planet may not allow off-planet doctors to practice...

I presume that you meant the casing around the receiver, trigger

make a fuller stock that covers the area (or possibly use ply wood or 
some such). If you meant cartridge casings, that\'s a whole different 
matter.

For that a \'zip gun\' style shotgun is probably the way to go.

Use steampipe or something similar for the barrel, and just make a 
simple zip gun, assuming use have ammo (how\'s that for an unlikely 
\'accident\' the crash destroys all the guns, but leaves the ammo intact?)

If there\'s no ammo, they had better have someone with chemistry or a 
decent knowledge of primitive weapons, military or technological 
history along, otherwise they\'re going to have a real problem making 
ammo.

Ah.  The cartridge casing is exactly what I meant...  the housing/casing

The vowel in the first syllable is the same as the vowel in the second
syllable, and both syllables are the same length.  (If we were being strict,
which I\'m not, we would slur the "r" into something a lot like "l" or even
"t".)  I wouldn\'t get so annoyed, except that Kerry/Carrie is a totally
different name.  It\'d be like being named Allan and having the world call
you Aaron.

My name can mean either "fog" or "paulownia tree" depending on the
characters-- mine means "fog" which is rarer.

Not true. They\'ve raised the crime rate. Only people willing to ignore
the law have guns. Which means that criminals *know* the oodds of
having an average citizen be able to stop an attack are slim to none.

Not really. *Most* people are quite capable of producing a Sten Gun in
their home. They just don\'t *know* that they are. The thing was
*designed* to be produced by hand with not much more than a file and a
hacksaw! 

All you need are the instructions and a few paper templates to wrap
around things like the piece of pipe that forms the main body of the
gun.

Not yet.  There aren\'t a *lot* of characters in the book anyway, so I
probably won\'t be introducing more than two or three that haven\'t already
appeared in canon.  On the other hand, I\'ve got a lengthy sidebar on
"Personalities of the Interstellar Wars" in the works, and if there\'s room
I want to list at least one prominent colonial.

Hey, maybe Albadawi was from the colonies. . .

I picked up a cricket bat in Rivonia. The cricket finals were in session, 
so took the time to shop for one. I love my cricket bat!  I use for Chinese 
broadsword forms.  It has a better weight and feel than the sheet metal 
show blades sold in most MA catalogs.

If one was seeking to be completely independent of the commercial
manufacturing base, or stuck on a tech 7 or so world with the bare minimum
of gear and were builing your own arsenal. what about caseless? Could one go
this route to simplify things, or does this just add more complications? Are
caseless rounds more difficult to manufacture? Personally I\'ll stick to a
.22, as the ammo is ubiquitous (sold on the counter at local stores) and
cheap, and I don\'t like big boom.

The problem with B52s during the war was, they carried old weapons, not the new improved \'smart\' weapons they keep touting these days.  At cruising altitude, you couldn\'t hit the ground hardly with those old WW2 era bombs.

I certainly hope you don\'t believe that one military branch is
superior in all situations. Air power is neither perfect nor suitable
for ALL situations. However, in the right place and time (applying the
proper type and amount of high explosives) it can be decisive. But

True! These days a BUFF can place an unguided bomb within a few inches
of the target. The avionics have been SERIOUSLY upgraded. They also
can fly low altitude missions. Talk about a ride!

I\'d guess that here in NZ a "Kristen" would have more trouble with 
people calling them "Kirsten" than the other way around. While 
"Kirsten" is not a common name here "Kristen" is practically non-
existant.

In a word: Yes.

Caseless ammo needs a propellant that is structually strong enough to 
not need the case, as well as being water,petrol and sunlight 
resistant. If it is to be used in a miltary situation it also has to be 
very cook-off resistant, as there is no case to soak up and extract 
waste heat from combustion. Also the primers are trickier to make as 
they have to burn up completely. Not only that but the weapon has to be 
better made as there is no case to seal the chamber.

The G11\'s ammo was actually made from a high explosive mixed with a 
stabilser, as normal rifle propellants just wouldn\'d cut it.

Those smart bombs aren\'t quite as good as the propoganda suggests, 
either. IIRC post-war analysis showed that in the Gulf War they were 
_much_ less effective than was first thought. Part of the problem was 
that there was so much video footage that under-trained personnel were 
used to analyse it, and they over-estimated the quality of hits.

Yep. IM(incredibly)HO, the media\'s treatment of the Gulf War and the 
air strikes against Serbia (it wasn\'t a war, or so I\'m told - I must 
look up the meaning of \'war\' again) have done a considerable dis-
service to the armed forces of the western world, because the 
polictians and the public are going to expect things to always work 
like that. I\'m expecting cuts in spending on new equipment to the 
armies in favour of air forces (in general terms).

I wouldn\'t say that. Most so-called recreational drugs are illegal in
this country -- in effect, my government is saying that I can not do
marijuana, cocaine, heroin, etc. Makes no difference to me -- I\'ve no
urge to do any of these things anyway.

Wow. Errata in _The Traveller Book_. Kewl.

It says, right there, bigger \'n hell, on page 82: "Hydrographics Percentage
(2D-7+atmosphere; ..."

This is then contradicted on the table on page 85. Book 6: Scouts, MT Ref\'s
Manual, TNE and (apparently) Book 3 all say the table on page 85 is correct.

Errors in the Good Book! Oy vey! What of holy canon! What of rules! Indeed,
the whole framework of my existance is shaken. Woe is me.

And the perils of speaking the "same language" strikes again!

In the US, napkins are the things you wipe your hands and face with
(aka serviettes(sp)). Diapers are what you put on a baby\'s bottom.

And (for our British list members), "knock up" means "make pregnant"
and "fanny" is a synonym for "butt", not for "vagina".

The ObTrav should be obvious. Galanglic will have these sort of
boobytraps for every single world that has a few million or more
"native speakers". 

Which means that if the ref wants some fun, all he has to do is come up
with a different meaning for some common idiom, and watch the confusion.

"Could I have a napkin, please" in a restaraunt, for example. :-)

Well excuse me for trying to warn someone that they might just have a
*pirated* copy of something. It\'s very common for folks pirating games
to claim that it\'s been released into PD by the copyright holder. So
relying on what the stuff included with the file *says* is risky at
best. 

If it is PD, great! I\'d want to see someone direct from the copyright
holder before I\'d risk distributing it. The per copy damages the
copyright holder can claim are a bit too steep for *my* bank account.

Now factor in the fact that it\'s fairly likely that we\'ll develop
something like Piper\'s veridicator or Halpern\'s "truth machine" in the
not too distant future. 

When you have a *reliable* indicator of whether a person is or isn\'t
telling the truth, the protection against self-incrimination takes on a
whole different character. 

You are more likely to run into limitations on what sort of questions
can be asked under which circumstances.

And from an old post here (or possibly elsewhere), upon removing panels
to repair battle damage (or the once in a lifetime meteor strike that
pentrates the hull), you discover that the <bleep><bleep><bleep>
automated wiring robot that did that cable run had used some gizmo you
don\'t have to ID the wires in the cable by sending signals thru it. And
*hadn\'t* used color coded wires. Thus:

You "dissect" the ends of the broken cable so you can splice the broken
wires. Only to find yourself staring at 200 wires, all the same color. 

If you know the tricks, it\'ll take a couple of assistants and a few
dozen or so measurements on *each* of the two cable "segments" just to
establish that there are no open or shorted wires. If you *don\'t* know
the tricks, it\'ll take some ungodly number of measurements (200
factorial?) 

And if you didn\'t think to label the wires as you did that set of
tests, you\'ve got to do another set of as many again to ID the wires.
*Then* you can get down to splicing them. Have fun!

Well, as has been pointed out in the past, US law *defines* an
"unorganized militia". And that means it, too, is a militia. 

Also, it\'s a matter of record that during the debates before the
amendments were passed, a motion to add "in the common defence" after
"to keep and bear arms" was voted down.

And both sets of laws *in application* consider things you\'d never
think of if you weren\'t subject to them. 

For example, why aren\'t various cold capsules kosher?

(answer at bottom of message)

OBTrav: trying to deal with dietary or other religious restrictions of
a VIP passenger. Which way is Mecca while you are in Jump? Is recycled
water kosher? What Islamic calendar date is it?

That last one gets ugly, because the start of the month is supposed to
be determined by *direct observation* of the new moon.

At least Jewish law provides for situations when local sunset isn\'t
available or practical for determining the start of a day (say up near
and beyond the Arctic circle, and by extension, in a space habitat).
You use the time of sunset in Jerusalem.

Now consider the mess you get with religions from other worlds and
species. 




Oh yeah, the reason the cold capsules aren\'t kosher? The *capsule*
part is made of gelatin, an animal product (derived from bones and
hooves). And since you don\'t know if they used pig parts in producing
it, it isn\'t kosher (or halal).

I think there\'s only *one* producer of gelatin in the US that\'s halal,
and I forget which one it is. I *assume* they are also kosher, but it\'s
only a guess since I got the info from a FAQ about halal foods.

All right, it seems that I\'ve been a TMLer for too long.  When you said
"cold capsules", I thought of Low Passage berths, and was trying to
figure out what aspect of kosher dietary law addresssed such.  It didn\'t
even _occur_ to me that you might be referring to late-20th-century
Terran palliatives for rhinovirus infection....

Similar to the society in Judge Dredd, where they are _extremelely_
suspcicious of citizens who haven\'t been convicted of something, because,
well, they must be damn good criminals to have avoided prosecution for so
long.

There\'s even a story in which they find a guy who really has done nothing
illegal all his life, so Judge Dredd harasses him until he does do something
wrong !

Combine this with Judge Death, and get

Appropriate for a TNE campaign where Virus got into police dept robots, huh

I can\'t remember who wrote this series of short stories (Niven maybe?) 
about an eclectic professor that helped the cops in some obscure 
investigation, but in that world they had a mind probe that could reliably 
tell whether someone was lying or not.  Police could compel it\'s use in a 
criminal investigation, but the law was that a person could only be 
subjected to it once in his lifetime (some sort of weird double jeopardy 
extension).

The result was that criminals would line up to get arrested and probed for 
a minor crime, knowing that no matter what they did afterwards they\'d be 
safe from the probe (and with the probe available, juries seldom convicted 
without probe evidence).  As a result, the police internal policy was to 
only use it if they were already certain the person was guilty...

***NOTE:  While I, as an Arabic linguist, have learned about some
aspects of Islam, the following should not be taken as representative of
the Islamic faith, nor should it be construed as authorizing or
encouraging deviation from Islamic tenets among Terrestial Muslims.**

Well, unless the ship is within a few parsecs of Terra, the direction to
Mecca can be approximated by the direction to Sol from the ship.  In
jumpspace, I would interpolate the direction to Sol, based on the
following:

1.  The direction to Sol from my Jump initiation point;

2.  The direction to Sol from my Jump terminus;

3.  The direction to Sol in jumpspace, interpolated from the first two
directions, and based on time elapsed in jumpspace.

Again, unless the ship is within a few parsecs of Sol, the fractions of
a degree would be slight enough as to make no difference.  Besides,
should interstellar travel become commonplace, I would expect that those
Muslims who would undertake such would know that God (Allah) would
accept the intent, and not expect _perfect_ precision in directing
prayer to Mecca.

I would expect that recycled water would not be considered kosher,
unless all personnel aboard the ship were Jewish adherents to kosher
dietary law (I base this supposition on the fact that, when I dined with
Israeli Defense Force personnel, they had color-coded plates for Jews
and Gentiles, so that Orthodox Jews would not fear eing defiled by
eating off a plate that had been used by a Gentile.)

As to how one determines the Islamic calendar dates while outside the
Solar system, I would expect that, within sight of Sol and her planets
(in M:1100, that could be quite some distance), direct observation of
Sol, Terra, and Luna, plus calculation of light\'s travel time from Sol
to the point of observation, would fulfill the requirement for "direct
observation" of the new moon.

Besides, at least some Islamic rules (such as daytime fasting during
Ramadan) are relaxed for those who are travelling, especially when
travelling in service to the Islamic faith.

Again, I would expect that Muslims who would be outside of the Sol
system would receive appropriate guidance from (fairly flexible) Islamic
scholars, so that they would not be in violation of Islamic law.

Of course, the _real_ problem, for Muslims in the 3I (especially prior
to the Solomani Rim War), is the requirement for pilgrimage to Mecca
(Al-Haj).  Even after Terra falls to Imperial forces, travel to Mecca,
and the return trip home, could take half a lifetime or more for Muslims
in the Spinward Marches.  It wouldn\'t surprise me if Islamic scholars
established shrines throughout human space that would suffice to fulfill
the pilgrimage requirement, without having to travel for a decade or
more each way on one\'s pilgrimage.

I\'ve used similar hooks with a PC Doctor.  He was warned not to practice as
his qual\'s were not officially recognised "here" and he was arrested and
jailed when his PC did what his "above the local law" PC needed to do.

I\'d say that if the license wasn\'t recognised for any reason, then the law
is broken if he continues.

 An alarming but (apparently) harmless rattle/hum/whine when the thrusters 
are brought to full power, or when the fuel begins flowing into the jump 
mechanisms.
 A carelessly crossed wire (that will take a long time to find again) causes 
the ship to do its own jump-dimming without anyone actually turning down the

No.  It\'s a "well regulated" militia.  Militia, as defined by Webster\'s
dictionary and US Law (10 USC 311, I believe) as any male of military
service age.  Probably the phrase "well regulated" was intended to mean
"well trained."

Actually, the National Guard and Reserves didn\'t come into existence
until over 100 years after the Constitution and Bill of Rights were

after the states rights were set out in the Constitution in order to
preserve certain individual rights and limit the power of the federal

I presume you\'re refering to strategic use of airpower, here; I think we
can all agree that tactical aviation has been hugely important as an
element of the combined-arms doctrine since WWII.

The major problem with strategic airpower has been its misapplication,
particularly since WWII.  In that war, massive, well-coordinated raids on
German production and transportation centers significantly damaged
Germany\'s ability to field an effective army.  In the absence of the
multiyear bombing campaing, it\'s quite probable the invasion of France in
\'44 would have been repelled.

The flip side, of couse, is that we could have continued to bomb the
continent for a decade and Hitler (or his successor) would still have been
in power without the necessary followup to the air campaign -- that is,
sending staggering numbers of ground troops across the channel to get shot
to pieces on the sand, all too often, with the remainder securing those
beaches, then the ports, and spearheading a ground drive into occupied
Europe. 

This is the strategic side of combined arms -- you can\'t (usually) win a
large modern war on air *or* ground strategies alone.  The problem is, air
campaings are very cheap and easy for the party with air superiority, and
you\'re so visibly \'doing something\'; so there\'s a strong temptation to
stop at that point without committing ground troops to exploit the
weakening brought on by your strategic campaign.  Which leads to outright
losses like Viet Nam, and ambiguous pseudo-successes like Kuwait and
Kosovo.

I don\'t see it in Imperial court.  I don\'t see the Imperium being
big on the idea of letting ten guilty go free to make sure they
don\'t get on innocent.  IMO, Imperial right are the right to
a trial before an impartial judge, the right to present evidence

Basically it will guarantee the rule of law over arbitrary

There are those who do. As far as copyright issues go, PD and Freeware are
VERY different.

Public Domain is a subset of freeware, not all (nor even most) freeware is

For example, all of my software is freeware. I allow people to use the

The former ir roughly how I\'d say "Kiri", too. However that\'s because 
that\'s how everyone in NZ says it - we have a famous Kiri - Dame Kiri

So much for strategic bombing. Since Douhet the airforces have claimed to be 
able to win wars. Evidence gathered on the ground has always shown this claim 
to be exaggerated.

Even now in Serbia/Kosovo most of the military material claimed to be 
destroyed by air raids was just maskirovka stuff.

Aha!  Another possible explanation for the anomalies I\'m seeing. . .

(I\'m also noticing a few anomalies in the population-government-law level
sequence.  I just did the capsule description for 0214 Shululsish, for
instance.  Of course, I can buy a world with a population in the tens
of billions with a participatory democracy, a lot easier than I can buy
a Luna-sized world covered with liquid water.  Although I think I have
a handwave for that one too. . .)

I have that to but also in the same book....
B3 Second ed, page 7 Hydrographic Percentage (2D-7+atmosphere, if size 0 
then hydro of 0, if atmo 0,1,A+ then apply -4)
and then on page 12 is the of the same book is the refrence you made.

Since page 7 is backed up by multiple other scources I\'d go with that.

I have a conversion formula from FF&S2 to Starships, but I am not sure
it\'s correct. Anyway:

* Divide the FF&S2 armor value by the square root of 2
* Look up the result in the USP Conversion chart from Starships.    
Extrapolate the given values to one decimal.
* Multiply the resulting value by 10

The problem is that according to FF&S2, the minimum armor value for a
spaceship is 20. With the conversion system above, this corresponds to a
value of 7, which is a lot higher than what seems to be logical (there
are a lot of armor 0 ships, and the Destroyer only has an armor value of
10).

Sure, the person will be a decade or more away, and the costs will be

Unless Muslims have a problem with a pilgrimage made while asleep - 
it may be that the spiritual effect of going to sleep at Efate and waking

walking from, say, Islamabad to Mecca.

Can Mecca even handle the Islamic pilgrims that live on Earth, much

As well as by funny round-headed kids on Hallowe\'en.  ("I got a candy
apple!" "I got a pack of gum!" "_I_ got a rock.")

Of course, the full military nomenclature, as any survivor of the Fort
Huachuca Tactical Interrogation Course (MOS 97E) can tell you, is the
ST-1 hand grenade ["ST-one"].

I hope, that you realize, that Germany?s highest armarment output was in

>>>>>>>>
Ask Japan how significant the American air force can be in winning
a war.

Germany had an interesting situation at this time. Right up until then,
the Nazi regime had been unable (or unwilling) to militarize much
of the civilian economy. Household goods were still being produced,
much of the city economy was devoted to civilian service industries,
they were even still importing foriegn labor to act as housekeepers. 

Then American bombers leveled much of the German urban centers.

Munitions and other military plants were quickly rebuilt, due to the
needs and resources of the government. Many heavy machine tools
proved difficult to destroy, even when the building surrounding them
was badly damaged, and the important machines could be moved
with relative ease. 

Cabarets, beer gardens and department stores were not rebuilt - and the 
workers who had been employed there had to find other work, many at
the new weapons plants.

In this regard, American airpower acted to force the German economy
more strongly towards a war footing, which, though more efficient, probably 
had a significant morale effect on the civilian populace.

The biggest victories of the American strategic bombing command
were in the attrition of the German transportation networks (especially
rolling stock) and the serious interference with German lubricant and fuel 
production. 

The German Jet Fighter program, though they fielded operational units, 
spent most of it\'s time on the ground due to a lack of essential supplies, 
and by late 1944 many German tank formations were operating with little 
or no fuel reserves on hand. This lack, coupled with Germany\'s serious
transportation problems, was a crucial element in the American and
British ground combat successes in the West (as well as the Soviet
successes in the East).

ObTrav: Pick your targets carefully when black warring a world. One
barrage of missiles, at the right target, can be worth a week of ortillery
strikes. The atmosphere generation plants may be very well defended,
but what of the factory that supplies it with spare parts?

in large measure, it is pretty clear that it is not even close
to what the Founders intended.  Reading the Federalist Papers
and other \'explanatory\' essays put out by the Founding Fathers
to explain the new Constitution to the masses, it is clear that
the intent was for an individual right.  The controversy today
really boils down to \'Do we interpret this amendment based on
intent or based on current opinions?\'  For the record, I am
firmly in the \'intent\' camp and I strongly support the
individual right concept.

Hoping to avoid another 2nd Amendment flame war and to bring
this back to Traveller: The Imperium does not have a
Constitution, but it has \'Founding Declarations\' of some sort -
establishing the Moot and other conventions of Imperial
Structure.  The Imperium is also heavily bound by non-written
tradition (The Right of Assassination, forex).  Are these things
interpreted against \'modern\' opinion, or are they interpreted
based on the original intent?  The Right of Assassination seems
to be a developed tradition that appears well after the Imperium
is founded, but it could actually just be an old (Empire of
Man?) tradition that has resurfaced.

In a oligarchial society like the Imperium, I think that Intent
would not really be as strong a factor for interpretation, due
to the absolute power of the Emperor (I, Cleon, declare that the
Right of Free Assembly applies only to persons with full heads
of hair, and only on Tuesdays); Tradition would be a much
stronger tool of social influence.  In a more democratic
society, the level of attention paid to Intent would be (IMHO)
the thing that places that society on the scale of
Representative Government to Mob Rule (not organized crime mob,
of course).  Those societies that interpret and implement laws
based on Intent would tend more towards a formal representative
or republican government, while those societies that reinterpret
issues more and more often based on common opinion would be
those that tend toward the true Demos-style democracy where
everyone votes on everything.

On a practical level, Travellers will find pretty much evey
combination or interpretation you can imagine, and traditions
will vary so widely that Intent would not have a very important
influence on how things go when travelling across the secotr.
But for those Travellers who are heavily involved in the
government of one world (members of the aristocracy etc), this
could be very important.  How much can you bend the rules and
get away with it?  If you do bend the rules, is this likely to
change the rules in the future, or just be seen as an aberration
to be punished or ignored?  Most Travellers see law and custom
on a world in terms of \'What weapons may I have or buy here?\',
but that little UPP number does not tell the whole story.

PS - the actual wording is \'Well-regulated militia\'.  The whole
phrase is part of a dependent clause, so it is not particularly
a statement of law, but more of clairification.  Unfortunately,
word meanings shift over time.  Well-Regulated at that time had
the meaning well-equipped and well-trained, not well-supervised.
Of course, one\'s definition of well-equipped and well-trained
varies.

That\'s about right.  The "r" sounds a little different when nihonjin say
it, but I\'m not picky about that-- I just don\'t want people to call me
Carrie.  Usually people who have heard of Kiri Te Kanawa say it right.

Which is funny, cause I grew up on the banks of the Kanawha River.  I love
synchronicity!

Once I got an email spam.  I forget what it was about but it was addressed
to about 200 people all named Kiri.  Someone had extracted the email
addresses of all the Kiri\'s they could find on the net!

I was so amazed.  Most of the email addresses were to people in Japan or
Finland but there were quite a few NZ and Australia addies too.  I sent
out a query asking them to respond if they felt like it, remarking that
I\'d no idea there were so many of us!  My favorite response was from an
Aboriginal man in Australia who told me his name was Kiriwera but people
always called him Kiri.  I\'d no idea there were male Kiri\'s!

What does "knock up" mean in Britain?

My favorite British English story is about how my ex-husband, who came to
the US from Hong Kong at age 14 to go to boarding school, almost got
punched out by an American girl in his class when he asked her if she had
a rubber he could use.  (HK people use British English; "rubber" there is

I wonder how long that will last.  In the UK the Right to Silence
when arrested has gone:

    "... Anything you say may be taken down in  writing  and
    used in evidence against you.  Anything  you  don\'t  say
    but which you later rely on in  court  may  be  used  in
    evidence against you ..."

The rational was that if you are innocent then you  have  nothing
to hide.  This weakens non-self incrimination  rights,  and  even
weakens "innocent until proven guilty"!  And  when  you  consider
that UK and  US  politicians  regularly  meet  to  swap  ideas  I
wouldn\'t be surprised if one day something similar happens in the
US.   As  an  outside  observer  it  sometimes  seems   that   US
politicians  find  the  US  Constitution  an  impediment  to   be
circumvented rather than something they support.  (Oops,  getting
dangerously OT here.)

I disagree with the link between high LL and corruption.  Some of
the sheriffs in the American Wild West were corrupt and that  was
a low LL situation.  I  don\'t  think  there  is  any  correlation
between LL and corruption.

In the Traveller Law Level abstraction, a Low LL planet should have few

will not be involved unless it\'s serious (and probably very public)
wrongdoing. If you\'re walking down main street, blazing away at

of the local peace officers isn\'t as relevant, or will at least be very
difficult to conceal.

Compare this to a very high LL world where very minor and very private 
things can be criminalized. Once the offense is private and difficult to
detect, the very existance of the crime can be a judgement call on the 
officer\'s part. Then we *do* get into situations where corruption is very 
relevant.

Quite true, though in Kashrut cleanliness counts which should take care of

Whu... um, the Bill of Rights was passed concurrently with the Constitution. The fact that the national guard didn\'t come into existence until much later is irrelevant to the point that they are a militia, though it\'s certainly legitimate to claim that it wasn\'t specifically what the founders were thinking about.

This in turn reminds me of Niven\'s Belter society as presented in e.g.
_Protector_, where Belt prospectors were more or less expected to attempt
to smuggle cargoes past tax collectors when the opportunity arose.  If
you\'d never been nabbed and fined for this, there would be a general
suspicion you\'d never tried, and were thus a coward; if you\'d been caught
more than once or twice, you would be considered incompetent.

In 2300AD, a Saudi colony had a chip of the stone in Mecca (name has gone

I was asked about some X-boat routes missing from my map of the
Spinward Marches on my Trade Routes page.

<Shamless Plug>

http://www.ghg.net/tmixon/Trade

</Shamless Plug>

When I looked at Galactic, since I am out of country and don\'t have my
CT Spinward Marches at hand, I noted a few differences. Will someone
with the CT: Spinward Marches book let me know if they are there as
well? Any comments as to how these SHOULD be are herein asked for.
I posted these to GURPS: Eratta page so I MIGHT get an answer there as
well. 

There is one added X-boat line in BTC between Ffudn and Bendor in the
Glisten subsector. 

There are some X-boat routes not in BTC that are in Galactic. 
Inthe-Regina to Dhian-Aramis to Risek-Rhylanor. Also, Strouden-Lunion
to Persephone-Lunion to Marastan-Glisten.

It has several Zone differences that I will now list.

494-908-Darrian            G: Red      BTC: Nothing
Karin-Five Sisters         G: Amber    BTC: Nothing
Puparkin-Jewell            G: Nothing  BTC: Amber
Chwistyoch-Jewell          G: Amber    BTC: Nothing
Esalin-Jewell              G: Amber    BTC: Nothing
Garda-Villis/Tanoose-Vilis G: Nothing  BTC: Amber

Singer-District 268        G: Nothing  BTC: Amber
Kwai Ching-Distict 268     G: Nothing  BTC: Amber
Feri-Regina                G: Nothing  BTC: Amber

The following one had the name Dentus in BTC and Tentus in Galactic. I
am not sure which is correct.

Dentus-Regina              G: Nothing  BTC: Red
Dinom-Lanth                G: Nothing  BTC: Amber
Tureded-Lanth              G: Nothing  BTC: Amber
Wardn-Lunion               G: Amber    BTC: Nothing
Tsarina-Glisten            G: Amber    BTC: Nothing
Corfu-Aramis               G: Red      BTC: Amber
Aramanx-Aramis             G: Nothing  BTC: Amber
Junidy-Aramis              G: Nothing  BTC: Amber
Nakoto-Aramis              G: Amber    BTC: Nothing
Zivije-Rhylanor            G: Amber    BTC: Nothing
Moran-Mora                 G: Amber    BTC: Nothing
Zephyr-Trins Veil          G: Red      BTC: Nothing

I am not sure that these are errata or concious changes they made or a
combination. Could someone toss out some opinions?

Thanks.

has given a large number of concessions to the Diplomacy community online,
the consensus is to respect their wishes. DO NOT post a copy of the rules

When Avalon Hill were making Diplomacy, it was possible to buy the rules
separately from the game. However, with Hasbro taking over AH, this is not
currently possible, and it is not clear if it will be available in the

Hey, if we concentrate research into this phenomenon, we might be able
to come up with contragrav in the very near future (TL 8 or 9, as per
CT). ;-)

In Russia there is a rather lenghty trial going on were 
a former Russian Navy Captain named Nikitin, collabarated
with a norwegian environmentgroup named Bellona on a
report on the Russian Militaries handling of radioactive
and toxic chemicals. None of the material published were
classified, but he iwas brought up on charges of breaking
some secret laws, has never seen the files of his case and 
so on. A search on the web on Nikitin and Bellona will
probably give some pretty in depth views on how the
Russians has handled this case.

It seems to be a fact that BTC changed several things from CT.   
X-boat routes have indeed disappeared from the Spinward Marches, at 
least comparing to the MT map. But that\'s not the only change. I 
think that almost two dozens of naval bases went missing. The 
population of  (0301) sky-rocketed all of a sudden to become a High 
Pop world, and at least 5 other worlds lost their High pop rating. 
And also starports have changed: I got two examples, one from E to X 
(0607), another from D to B (2735). Ant one imperial world is not 
imperial anymore (1727).

I think that there has been a thorough, deliberate reworking of the 
sector. But of course we should ask MJ Dougherty or Neil Frier.

Hopefully, they will toss in their two centi-credits worth.

This rather misleading statistic often appears when this subject is
discussed.  Yes, production in tons of steel peaked in 1944.  That\'s why I
phrased my statement the way I did.  There\'s more to "field[ing] an
effective army" than producing a lot of tanks, arms, and ammo.  For
example, you have to fuel the vehicles, and lubricate them, and move the
troops to the front(s), and supply them there, and so on and on.  It was
this infrastructure that strategic bombing most heavily damaged, resulting
in a situation in which the Germans had a great deal of materiel which
they could no longer effectively deploy in the field.  Petroleum shortages
proved especially devastating, and these stemmed in large part from
wholesale destruction of fuel storage and transport facilities.

My industry (software) suffers from the \'silver bullet\' theory as much as
the military does.  Every new technology is hyped to the skies, and is
predicted to solve all problems and revolutionize the field.  Then the
hype dies down, and people gradually discover how this new tool works with
others already in the box.

Air forces don\'t (usually) win wars, but were I a ground soldier, I\'d much
prefer to wade into a hostile country whose ability to wage war has been
degraded through a prolonged bombing campaign.  If the enemy is mounting a
counterattack, it\'s more effective and cheaper in lives lost to destroy
the rail stock and line they will use to reach the front, rather than
shooting the enemy soldiers individually once they get there.  And so
forth.

> Even now in Serbia/Kosovo most of the military material claimed to be 
> destroyed by air raids was just maskirovka stuff.

And yet, however ineffectually airpower was applied, and however timid
allied forces were about ground deployments, an air campaign did result
(eventually) in partial capitulation by the Serbs.

Desert Storm provides a somewhat better model for how air and ground
forces complement one another.  The prolonged air campaign left the allies
with total air superiority, and also (and this is critical) seriously
damaged the Iraqi C3I and supply infrastructure.  This weakened the Iraqi
military to the point that when the ground attack came, victory was swift
and relatively bloodless (compared to most predictions).

From my own perception, I have never felt Leonard has \'talked down\' to me
when he disagreed with what I posted (which is quite often..:) ).  This
entire list is somewhat intimidating at first for a person like me who is
largely un-educated.  There\'s a lot of high-powered mental resources here
that I thoroughly enjoy.  Leonards\' posts (the ones with scientific data or
formulas) generally tend to get saved to CD along with any other useful
tidbits I see here.

Anyway, this is just my thoughts on the matter.  I do not perceive any
attitudes on his part.  You also need to remember that since this is a
text-based medium, that often our own frame of mind can lend \'color\' to
others\' words where such semantic content just doesn\'t exist.

In H. Beam Piper\'s universe (\'Little Fuzzy\', \'Uller Uprising\', et. al.), there was a machine called the veridicator, which was part of every police interrogation as well as being installed in every courtroom to determine the truth.  As long as the globe showed red, you were telling the truth *as you knew it*.  The instant it started turning blue, you were in deep kimchee...

Piper\'s writings on colonial laws was fairly interesting as well.  In \'Little Fuzzy\', one guy remarked that they could only execute him once, and the other guy said, \'Well in <legal cite that escapes me at the moment>, they shot the guy dead, *then* hung him\'.  Interesting...

I think you have it backwards. My book 3 ((c) 1977, doesn\'t say an edition)
has 2D-7+Size at both the textual explanation & the chart, and Book 6,
Scouts says 2D-7+Size at both locations and about satellites as well as
planets.

Usually, not within 600 meters of their target, if launched from high altitude.  We got better results with some A6 drivers coming in at treetop level.  <grin>

Good points.  On the converse, though, a low LL world might not have
strongly enforced policies on how what cops exist operate.  In other
words, yes, they would certainly react in force to the madman with the
laser rifle on Main Street, but they might have more de facto or de jure
discretion on whether to respond to (say) a commercial burglary, or a
barroom brawl.  Under these circumstances, "justice for hire" could become
the norm; if you want the police to get involved in a "borderline" case,
you pay them, above or below the table.

Aha!  I just realized how this works out.  At low LL, you pay the cops to
get involved.  At high LL, you pay them to leave you alone. :)

starship construction sequence. I\'m putting together a CA-15 Cruiser Armored
from FSotSI, and I\'ve run into suprisingly few problems, but for the
following:

1) Nuclear Dampers. I can\'t, for the life of me, find what a nuclear damper
is supposed to do in the starship combat system. The CA-15 has an Optimized
Damper, so I assume that\'s one module with 10-mile coverage. But what does
that translate to in the combat system?

2) Spinal mounts. Oh, those spinal mounts. The CA-15 has a NPAW model T,
which is roughly twice the size of the NPAW listed in the book (3,000 spaces
v. 1500 or so), so I\'m going to have to build one. I started by trying to
reverse-engineer the NPAWs in the book, but found that I couldn\'t get the
numbers to match! Oh, I get the stats all right, but I can\'t seem to make it
fit in the mass and space alotted. I come up with:

   Weapon: 11853 tons mass, 2370 spaces (948 if you use cf/50
      for volume instead of cf/20 as per GUPRS Vehicles, pg. 42)
   Full Stablization: 115 tons mass, 237 spaces (95)
   Power Plant: 1898 tons mass, 152 spaces
   Energy Bank: 32 tons mass, 1 space

For a total of: 13898 tons mass, 2760 spaces (1196).

As far as I can tell, it requires no crew stations -- as a hull weapon, it\'s
fired from the bridge by the chief gunner or pilot (as per GT pg. 150). What
am I missing here?

3) Armor. Why is total surface area the area of the hull plus the *total*
area of all the ships turrets and bays? I would think that, since the
turrets and bays are at least partially imbedded in the hull, they wouldn\'t
count as surface area. Bays especially, since they are now almost completely
*inside* the hull.

That\'s all I can think of right now. I like the system overall.

BTW, the GT CA-15 looks like it\'s only going to have a maneuver of 2Gs or
so. With an AV of 80 (DR 30,240), it\'s got a lot of armor.

Reminds me of the legal discussion in GURPS Technomancer.  Seems that my
adopted home state of Louisiana (in the Technomancer setting) sentences
some felons to "life plus ten years":  the convict serves life at hard
labor; when he/she/it dies, the corpse is reanimated for another ten
years hard labor.

Now _that\'s_ a punitive legal measure!

ObTrav:  Try this for a deeply unpleasant sentence:  A day before a
convicted felon has finished serving his/her/its time in prison, put
said convict into cold sleep for a century or two.  Then thaw the
convict out, have him/her/it serve the last day of the sentence, and
then be released.  Temporal exile....

There are no nukes in the basic combat system.  For practical purposes, 10 mile radius means \'immune to conventional nuclear weapons\'.

This whole logic is fscked up.  Basically, if you use a volume of 10 spaces for a bay, it counts as external.  If you use a volume of 50 spaces for a bay, it is an internal hull mount.

That\'s mostly caused by a failure to clean up file handles when
processes end, and it\'s been a problem with Windows all the way back
to version 1.0. MS could clean all that up, but for *some* reason (I
could be cynical here, but I won\'t) they won\'t.

OTOH, I\'ve been pleasantly surprised with the stability of Win98 as
compared to Win95 on the two systems I have it installed on.  It\'s not
up to the level of OS/2 or Linux for stability, but it\'s not too bad.  

I saw where MS announced that the Win2000 client will sell for $350
when it comes out next March.  The server was in the thousands, not
unexpected. I also so where they want to require a "client user fee"
for ever client that connects to a Win2000 server. That should
basically eliminate any non-MS clients from connecting to a Win server
as you\'d end up paying twice.

Sorry, but that would be hard to do. At this point, the OS and Apps
arms of MS are the same Corp, with the same stock.  Gates may be
selling some of his stock in MS to raise money for other purposes,
though.

Personally, I\'d *love* for the court case to result in a break of MS

Well, yeah, that\'s what I mean. According to GT errata, the bays in the book
should take up 50 spaces *inside* the hull. Yet it says on GT pg. 152 (no
errata) that "Surface area: ... number shown in the "area" column on the
Hull Table (p. 151) plus the surface area of all turrets and bays. ... Each
bay has an area of 6,500."

Yeah I wondered why it took so long for me to download.  when I first looked

It\'s due to a massive lack of clue on the part of the people who made that errata.  Hopefully GT:Starships will fix all that garbage.

sorry, but you\'re wrong on this. There were guard units by 1830; Abraham
Lincoln was elected captain of his guard unit well before he ran for the
senate or the presidency. The Guard and reserves system *AS WE KNOW IT
TODAY* dates to this century, but is one of several revisions to an already
existing system which, in theory (at least) grew out of the requirement of
every brittish yeoman to practice with the long bow.

The constitution and bill of rights were both worked upon in the same
continuous period of 1785-1790 (maybe 95, don\'t have sources to hand); The
only way to get the constitution signed by all states was to provide for
the bill of rights. Which passed separately, and after much debate. Prior
to the Constitution, the United States  operated under the articles of
confederation, which provided for state militias, which could then be
called in to US service

If the Second Amendment means "the States" (i.e., bearing of arms
limited to National Guard units) when it says "The People", this would
be afaik the only place in the Constitution & the Bill of Rights where the
one is used to mean the  other. There are several places where the two 
words are used with clearly different meanings, often in the same clauses, 
indicating that the framers had the obvious meanings of "The People" and 
"The States" in mind.

ObTrav: the 3I gets away from these semantical problems through the 
simple expedient of letting nobles make up the rules as they go along. ;-)

Besides the National Guard there are two levels of Militia in the United 
States, the State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The State Guard also 
known as the State Military Reserve is for use only as a second line 
militia in the state of origin and may not be used outside the state 
without state permission.  It is equivalent to the British Home Guard of 
WWII.  In most states it is at a cadre level at best in peace time (San 
Diego, California\'s unit is the 41st Inf. Bn.).  The last time it was 
called up in California was in WWII when it was used to patrol the coast 
and guard bridges and defense plants using men exempted from federal 
service for fitness, age, job, or completion of military obligation.  The 
unorganized militia consists of all fit for service men between 18 and 
50.  The last time this was called out was during the Civil War.  Short of 
a total disaster it won\'t be called up active duty for the same reason that 
County Sheriffs don\'t use their power of involuntary Posse duty, it would 
be political suicide.  Very few men realize that they have a 8 year 
military obligation in the United States.

I\'m going in the same direction as Doug, but still
point out that it depends largely on what you\'re
bombing.  Aerial bombardment of civilian targets has
not hastened the end of any war, nor hindered the
target\'s ability to fight.  Aerial bombardment of
military targets can incapacitate them, allowing
ground forces to defeat them.  Two examples of the
latter phenomenon are the Gulf War and the invasion of
Europe by the Allies in 1944.  

A possible counter-example to the first statement --
about the ineffectiveness of bombing civilian targets
- -- is the nuclear bombing of Japan in 1945.  Years of
fire- and explosive bombing of Japanese cities had not
hastened a surrender nor even much prevented the
Japanese from supplying their forces.  The nuclear
attacks, however, caused an immediate surrender.

Kevin, I think you\'ve fallen victim to good marketing.
 The vast majority of bombs dropped during the Gulf
War were deadfall ordnance.  They just didn\'t put
those on TV every night.

Perils strike, so that subject and verb agree.

I think that it was Churchill who lamented that the
English and Americans are "one people separated by a
common language," but, as you observed, it can happen
in any language.  One of my favorites is that in
Finnish laakari means doctor, but in Estonian in means
gynecologist.  There are no doubt all sorts of
problems like this throughout known space.

No, I don\'t see any _guarantee_ of a _rule of law_ in
the Third Imperium.  I think that the Third Imperium
will try to establish some predictability of result in
order to facilitate interstellar commerce, but beyond
that, due process is just not the controlling concern.
 

Nobles will get more due process than ordinary
citizens; member states will get more due process than
ordinary citizens; megacorporations may or may not get
more due process than ordinary citizens.

Remember that individual member states may grant more
due process to litigants in their jurisdiction than
the Imperium would, so forum selection is a big issue
for lawyers in The Far Future.

I was just stating canon; look at Book 3:  Worlds and
Adventures.  I don\'t have it in front of me, so can\'t
give page citation.  Law level is defined as the level
of intrusion and the level of corruption.

That is probably not a good definition, which was the
gist of your criticism.  In real life, it often
doesn\'t work out that way.

Bingo! That\'s the key... THIS is what crippled the Wehrmacht in the west. I

I\'ve seen, probably on an EduCorp "shareware disk", a version of Monopoly
labelled "public domain". This is obvious nonsense, because Parker Brothers
owns the copyright and has _not_ released monopoly into the public domain.
The fact that the author of the program released his code into the public
domain doesn\'t make his violating of Parker Brothers\' copyright legal.
Which I think was the point Leonard was trying to make.

This was one of the things IDed as a fairly significant change from the way

I think crew requirements for spinal weapons may be changing with GT

"Knock up" can be taken in the same context as the US. It can also be 
used to describe calling around for someone on the off chance that 
they are in (or at least, that\'s how it was used locally when I was a 
lad).

Nappie = Diaper
Napkin = serviette.
Hankie = Hankerchief = for blowing one\'s nose on or mopping one\'s brow.

Amendment to be redundant with the National Guard.  Then I learned some
more history, which put a whole different spin on that amendment and
actually changed my stance on gun control:

First, at the time, the newly-minted United States didn\'t have a standing
army.  There was, in fact, a fair amount of sentiment AGAINST the concept.
So the theory was that whenever there was need, the able-bodied men would
pick up their rifles, go out and do what had to be done, and then return
home and go back to their lives.  Switzerland still seems to operate on
this concept.  The militia IS the army.

Imagine if we had no Army, just the National Guard, period.  (Well, then we
wouldn\'t be the Policeman of the World, just like back in Teddy Roosevelt\'s
time.  Duh.)

Second, and part of the reason the people didn\'t want an army (hint:
military coup), was that they\'d just fought a war to free themselves from
one unpopular government.  The right to bear arms was, as far as I can
tell, intended to be a guarantee that if the citizenry got sufficiently fed
up with the new government, they could get together and overthrow it too.

For obvious reasons, this interpretation is not appreciated by those who
are currently in charge, but it\'s very popular among the various "militias"
with an axe to grind about the gummint.  Also, the balance has changed a
bit:  no longer can you count on both sides having the same kind of weapons...

Kaba\'a? or something like that.  Sir Richard Burton
disguised himself as a pilgrim and did the haj all the
way to Mecca at a time when no white man would be
believed to be a Moslem.  Once there, he charmed the
guards to let him inside the shrine that surrounds the
stone itself, and he took measurements and made
drawings.  That could make a cool Traveller adventure.

One thought I have about religions in space -- or
religions in general, anyway -- is that some religions
are primarily about what one does and others are
primarily about what one believes.  I think that in
general, religions that focus on belief are easier to
transport off-planet.  To the extent that that is
true, religions may change to focus more on the
portable parts, the belief systems, rather than on the
rituals.

that a Bill of Rights would be added. The first ten amendments were

The Soviets had a lot of problems along these lines in 1941.  They had more
tanks than every other country in the world combined, and most of their
tanks were still fairly effective, that is, not obselete by 1941 standards,
but they had no spare parts.  The result was that equipment that broke down
couldn\'t be repaired, and mostly had to be abandoned.  By the end of \'41
they were down to about 3000 tanks, out of an initial fleet of 30000.  The
Germans were down to about 300 effectives, out of an initial 3000 or so.

This situation arose largely because the economic planning mechanisms they
used rewarded the production of complete tanks, but not parts.  I\'m not
sure they ever really got around this problem.

Other stuff around this topic:
Australia wasn\'t bombed much during WWII, but by 1944 its economy was in
desperate shape.  Since the US was bearing the brunt of the war in the
Pacific then, about half the Australian armed forces were demobilised, in
order to rebuild the economy.  As an example of the economic chaos, the
railways/railroads in Queensland had to be pretty much rebuilt after the
war, as the locomotives, rolling stock, track and so on had been run into
the ground, with little maintenance having been possible.  (My grandfather
was a rail worker during the war.)

A thought:  does anyone know much about the role the Chinese played in
WWII?  How much of the Japanese military did they keep busy, compared to
the amount fighting everyone else?  If you want a huge military force built
on minimal resources, the Chinese might be the people to look at in this
period.

Another thought:  The second bloodiest war in history (after WWII) was the
Taiping Rebellion in China in the 19th century.  (I\'ve fouled up the
Romanisation of "Taiping", of course).

OBTRAVs:
(1)  When fighting the Vargr, keep a close eye on your supply lines.

(2)  Civil wars on hi-pop worlds can be quite as nasty as small
interstellar wars.

(3)  The Solomani might have had problems sustaining their war effort in
the Rebellion.  In particular, worlds like those in the Near Bootes Cluster
might have experienced huge economic dislocation.  This might, in time,
tend to limit their enthusiasm for the war.

(4)  General problems of production and supply in wartime.  

(5)  In situations like the Frontier Wars, the worlds close to the action
would go onto a war economy footing, but it seems unlikely that the rest of
the Imperium would.  Basically, the Imperium would usually fights its wars
with one arm tied behind its back.  The Rebellion, of course, is the great
exception, but even there, many worlds would probably have tried to avoid
it, or the change would not have occurred until several years into the war.
 The chaos caused by the militarisation of the economy might have
contributed to the Hard Times, as civilian facilities get pushed lower and
lower on the repair priority list, and so on.

From memory, about 50-80%.  The war on the mainland started c. mid-30\'s and
tied up the bulk of the Japanese land forces.  I\'ll check the actual figures

In Australia, to "knock up" something is to construct it in a quick and rough
manner.
For example, "I\'m just going to knock up something for dinner".

Funniest story I\'ve heard of these things was when an Australian beer commercial
was first
seen in the USA. The beer is called XXXX (pronounced "four-ex"), which sounds
the same as a popular US brand of condom. The jingle ran:

     I can feel a four-ex coming on,
     I can feel a four-ex coming on.
     Just can\'t wait for it,
     Got the TASTE for it,
     I can feel a four-ex coming on.


OBTRAV: Local brand names across the Imperium might refer to completely
different products. Just imagine your PC\'s surprise when they open up a crate
and find something totally different to what they expected:

"You know that crate of wine you\'ve been keeping since you left Regina?"
"Yes, we\'re going to sell it when we get to Efate."
"Not unless they -like- liver pills."

Huh?!?!  Um, pardon a stupid question, is this a CD-ROM, or what?  If it is
a CD-ROM is it Windows only?  Is this the _First_ 250 issues?  Also, how much?

OK, now I\'m even more confused, why is it controversial.  Sounds like an
interesting thing to get to me, wouldn\'t mind a archive of the other
magazine they had in the early 90\'s (Dungeon, IIRC) either.

I wasn\'t talking about the stuff they dropped during the Gulf, I was talking about stuff dropped in the late 60\'s up til \'73.  I witnessed a few of those attacks.  Trust me, they didn\'t get within 600 yards of the target they were intended for.

Except that the rule you cite makes less sense :-).  And the majority
of other citations of the rule use size code as the primary modifier.

Heck, even the _Traveller Book_, which appears to be the source of
this misfeature, lists the rule as "2d - 7 + size" in the planet design
checklist, two pages after having it as "2d - 7 + atmosphere" in the
main text.

TNE rules use the size code as primary modifier too.  I don\'t have
the appropriate material from MT or T4 any more.

It\'s pretty clear that the rule as given in the TB main text is an erratum.

How much of the Japanese military was kept tied up in China, or rather how
important it was, is, I think, still debatable and highly politicized.
Numerically it was a pretty large number.  Comparing the Chinese
Nationalist and Communist war efforts would probably be interesting for
those who are interested in that sort of thing, but again, generates a lot
of partisan feeling.

Why can\'t people just learn that history is about FACTS and not
"interpretation"?????

Actually, it means something closer to "smoothly and reliably
functioning". As in a "well regulated clock". 

This exact argument came up recently in another group and apparently
"well regulated" is actually *in* several unabridged dictionaries. 

Just a reminder that looking up the individual words in a phrase is a
good way to get a wrong answer.

We went thru this a few months back. I am *not* talking down. You are

No. You *chose* to perceive a concerned warning as a put down. Don\'t
try to take your personal problems out on me and then try to blame me
for "provoking" you.

I wasn\'t trying to put you in your place. I was AND STILL AM trying to
*warn* you about something that you may have overlooked. Something that
could cost you thousands of dollars.

I did not call you a liar. I pointed out that *if* it was the package
from Avalon Hill, it was likely to be pirated. And that unless you got
the info saying it was "public domain" or "freeware" from the copyright
holder *not* from some web site (unless it *was* the copyright holder\'s
web site, which you did *not* state) you have *no* guarantee that it
really *was* ok to use. Presence of a forged "this is public domain"
statement in the archive containing the pirated software does *not*
protect you at all. People who believed such *have* been prosecuted for
illegally distributing copyrighted material. 

There\'s a large difference between pointing out that you may be
mistaken about the staus of the ganme and calling you a liar. 

If you actually *got* the game from a site run by the copyright holder,
all you had to do was *say* so. But without such a statement, the
*sensible* thing is too assume you got it elsewhere, and warn you that you
may have a time bomb on your hands. 

I\'m not responsible for your misreading of what I wrote nor for any
motives you have read into it. My intent was to warn you that you might
have a problem.

Just out of curiosity I took my old copy of the Solomani Rim book and
decided to see if there were any obvious systematic anomalies in the UWP
data.  In particular, I compared the hydrographics codes to both the size
codes and the atmosphere codes, to see which one the author used as
the main modifier for hydrographics.

It appears that the hydrographics codes are based on the world size, if only
because there are a fair number of "impossible" results if you assume that
they were based on atmosphere.  There are "impossible" results if you
assume they\'re based on size code, too -- but nowhere near as many. 
Also, although I didn\'t do a formal statistical analysis, the distribution of
differences "size code - hydro code" appeared closer to the expected
normal curve than the distribution of "atmos code - hydro code." 

So what it looks like to me is, Mr. Harshman (or whoever) followed the
original Book 3 rules, *mostly*.  The places where those rules are violated
appear to have been deliberately chosen.  At least they are uncommon
enough that I think I can account for them when doing the capsule
writeups.

I feel better now.

Yes. The first 250 issues on 5 CDs, plus all 7 issues of The Strategic
Review. These magazines are *in their entirety*, and I mean that. It\'s got
every single comic, game insert, illustration and advertisement in there.

I got it for $44.99 + tax (American), and IMHO it\'s well worth every penny
of it so far.

Compatibility (from the back of the box): "The Dragon Magazine Archive is
partially Macintosh compatible: Our proprietary browser is PC compatible,
but all files are in PDF format, and can be read with Adobe Acrobat Reader."

>OK, now I\'m even more confused, why is it controversial.  Sounds like an

TSR had been talking about releasing the archive for some time. However, one
of the big problems concerned reprinting rights for the articles, covers,
comics, etc. The contract that they have people sign doesn\'t (or didn\'t?)
cover reprint rights. There\'s apparently a law that allows publishers to
create "archives" and skip around such contracts. TSR went with that
option... and, well, as a result I\'ve got 250 issues of dragon sitting on
top of my CPU tower.

Some people were mad because the intent of the law in question was to
provide a way for publishers to make archives available in low-print "public
good" runs (for libraries and such places). TSR was very clear that this was
to be a mass-market commercial product. The catch is that in order to be
covered by this law, they had to include every issue they were *in its
entirety.* You get all of the Play By Mail ads, all of the Dragonbone ads,
all of the miniatures ads. In other words, there\'s real interest for general
RPG history geeks as well.

If the Dragon archive succeeds, one for Dungeon magazine can\'t be too far
behind.

> Zane (who is feeling out of touch with the RPG world)


Well, now you\'re back in touch!

If anyone\'s interested Warner / EC has released the Complete Mad Magazine on
CD as well. I\'m salivating as we speak... that\'s one for my Christmas wish

I doubt that the general populace had canon or warships or heavy cavalry.
Citizens who have the right to own weapons of whatever type they see fit is
just another of the many checks and balances in the system.  It should serve
to keep the size of government down.  If people have the right and the means
to defend themselves against any threat then the government will have less
need to protect them against those threats.

It\'s worse that that. [Is anyone surprised?]  Somehow an apparent typo
crept into later editions of Book 2 on the Drive Potential Table.  Early
print runs show drives Z produce only performance level 5 in 2000-ton
hulls, a consistent interpolation with the rest of the table.  However,
somewhere along the way to later print runs, this got inexplicably bumped
up to an incongruous performance level 6 in 2000-ton hulls, a striking
discontinuity from the level 4 performance drives Y yield, and a notable
anomaly in the mathematical progressions of the overall table.

This presumed typo then persisted on into every printing of the BBL I\'ve
ever seen.

Then, just to thoroughly immortalize it all, The Traveller Adventure
introduces the Imperiallines TI/TJ class, built to Book 2 specs, and
relying on the unusually-high drive performance available to 2000-ton hulls
as a result of the long-overlooked typo to set a particularly significant
bit of canon, namely the "alternative" to the X-Boat system.

Note that the TIs [and hence, de facto, the TJs] are now established as
canonical in CT, G:T, and TNE, and possibly other milieux I haven\'t noticed
them in yet.

Gotta love it... ;)

Correct, to a point.  Although each person varies in his or her capacities,
even beginning to attempt such a determination may be beyond most 3I era
Muslims.  You are correct that one\'s intention is the most pertinent aspect
of any action ~ not necessarily just the intent to face the appropriate
direction when beginning prayer, but the intention to please Allah by
keeping the prayers in the first place.  Each believer would likely rise to
his or her own level of accuracy, just as they do now.

I might have to disagree, but neither would I consider myself of an
extremely strict orthodoxy.  Once anything has been rendered into its
components elements and remade into a new form, I would posit that most
"modern" Muslims would accept it as halal; I would.  If not, then one should
not drink from a well, or even be able to eat anything that hadn\'t been
touched in even some remote fashion by things haram.  There are things in
the water table that make me shudder to think... and I don\'t mean just the
fluoride.  I can\'t speak for Judaism, though.

I would suspect that 3I Muslims would have to follow their own local lunar
calendar for most things other than keeping track of comparable dates to
discuss intelligently with others.  There is much discord amongst the Ummah
about "which moon" to follow even today for determining events, such as Eid.
There are hadith, IMO, that rule on the subject which state clearly that one
should follow the sightings of the moon in one\'s own city or region, *not*
the sightings of the moon elsewhere.  I suppose it would be an interesting
debate, though, would it not?

This, of course, becomes difficult on a moonless sphere, just as prayer time
calculation becomes very burdensome close to the poles of Terra.  I\'ve
pondered it myself, but have sought no scholar\'s futwa on the topic yet.  :)
If/when I ever do, I\'ll be sure to share with the list.  I suspect that the
now-common, though in-authentic, practice of following the sightings of the
moon in Mecca or Medina might gain even wider acceptance, although
time/distance will make even that more nigh impossible.

Traveling is a relative thing...  If you live aboard a starship for most (or
all) of your life, are you still traveling?  I don\'t think so, but we all
seek our own excuses in life.  ;)  But, yes, there are many issues with
which to grapple and study on when we attain the stars.

> Of course, the _real_ problem, for Muslims in the 3I (especially prior

Hajj is incumbent only upon those to whom it presents no arduous hardship.
There are many today that make Hajj every year, and sometimes Umra as well,
but I would suspect that barring splinter sects which seek to establish a
false Mecca elsewhere (as mentioned in another post), the Hajjis from beyond
the Sol system would be few, and from beyond the Solomani Rim even fewer.
IME, it\'s unfortunately not necessarily the most pious who make the journey,
but all too often those who wish to be seen as such and have sufficient
capital to do so.

It\'s always nice to meet someone who is conversant in a belief not
necessarily their own.  Well met, Black ICE.

Yeahg, part of every use included asking a set of test questions,
including some that you were supposed to lie in answer to.

If they globe *didn\'t* turn red during the lies, you were a pathological
liar and the veridicator couldn\'t be used on you. But such folks are a

I don\'t recall *that* one, but I do recall the cite where they tried a
dead man for sabotage.

And for that matter, I heard of a case in the US (not sure if it is
real) where a politician was convicted of receiving a bribe from X, but
X was acquitted of *paying* the bribe.

Who says it has to be *liquid*?

    I have to say here, that maybe praying in the general direction of earth
might be the best thing to do, as that is where the Holy Land is.

    Well as a Jew, who tends to keep as kosher as he can, I would have to
say, that any water that is clean is kosher, no matter where it comes from.
For example in WWII, Jews who were fighting in the war, or in the Nazi Death
Camps were released from having to keep kosher, as it could not be done.  I
think in the 3I, that the same would happen.  I.e. that sometimes water is
water, & food is food, & you can make ammends later on, when you are still
alive, & if you die before then, well at least you tried to live & you will
be forgiven, but the people that forced you off keeping kosher will have
hell to pay.
    As for people that follow Islam, I can remember my uncle, who is an
Iman<sp?> once told me that durring WWII it was OK for people to eat unclean
foods, inorder to stay alive, & that the British Troops who faught in North
Africa who followed Islam, offen had to eat pork because there was no other
food around, & while it was not good, from a short religious point of view,
it was good in a long term religious POV, as they were fighting against a
great evil.  And, he said that they all went to paradise due to the fact
that they fought against the Nazis, & they dwell there, along with the Jews,
& others who fell fighting the Nazis.
    OBTrav:  What would be the food & drink restrictions in the 3I?

    Yes, it would be.  But, also the Moslims might go to a solar/standard

    Well, then, if you live aboard a starship, would that not be your home?

    I would have to take a wild guess & say, that the spirit of the law
would be followed rather than the letter.  And, also if the mountain will
not come to the seeker, then the seeker will have to come to the mountain.
Or, that other holy places will be found.  And, if you cannot go to Mecca,
you can go there.
    IIRC, there is a short story about a Moslim who cannot go to Mecca, but
can go to a local Holy Place, due to a war.  And, so he does, but he & his
friends have to fight something that is out to destroy the Holy Place, as it
knows that it will help to end the war for its side.

Well, I see it as going beyond _some_ predictability.  The
impression I get is one where the Imperium likes to codify
and keep things consitent.  When someone does something
wrong, it is (if it isn\'t a local matter) presented as having
broken a law and there is always reference to some trial
or judicial proceeding.  It also is pretty important for
trade (central to the Imperium\'s raison d\'etre).

A long distance from a modern view of "innocent until proven
guilty" but also a long way from arbitrary rule by fiat.

While you\'re correct WRT warships, quite a few cannons were in private
hands in the
colonies before, during, and after the War for Independence.  The only
impediment to
ownership was cost.  As for heavy cavalry, no one, *including* the British
had them
at that time.

As a point of interest, the only impediment to owning Revolutionary/Civil
War era
cannons *TODAY* is cost.  There are virtually no goverment restrictions on
muzzleloading,
black powder weapons.  A friend of mine near Austin, TX owns a 6-pounder.
While the
barrel is made of modern, high-strength steel, the carriage and all
accessories are
vintage Civil War manufacture.

IIRC, this was part of the Teapot Dome scandal during the Harding

Then I can imagining a politician wanting to be escorted out of office
as early in the day as possible so, when free of all political duties
(and being just a member of the populace), can go home grab a personal
weapon and try to make it over to the office of a political rival or
friend for the purpose of escorting them from office.

I assume you are working from MTJ #2? I had a close look at that last night, and
the nose-cone appears almost square-sided and therefore taller than the
streamlined body it is attached to!

Bad ASCII art follows...

 /              /

..yet they supposedly meet up. An optical illusion in 2D (like most views of

Have you created a solution that allows the deckplans to work?

BTW, just out of interest, are all of your models "fully functional"? That is, I
mean did you actually create the internals, or just use them to refine an outer
shell? And if so, can we see what they look like inside??

I want to see what the Xboat Tender\'s bay looks like with 4 Xboats on board. I
believe there is a catwalk with railing at the "top" of the docking bay - how
about a pic looking "down" over the edge? Position the camera in the roof + add
a couple of vacc-suited people leaning over the railing + grav-belted
vacc-suited person working on one of the \'boats + strategically placed lighting
+ open bay doors + one \'boat docking = one cool shot!!!

Or how about the experimental component is not callibrated to the ship its

but bad enough that the characters suspect they are undergoing one. Ie some
sick crew, display fluctuations in jump drive performance etc.

"Kih-ree"?

I have a similar problem. Despite having no "c" in my surname, people insist on
saying it with a French accent. Now, while it may well have been brought over
with the Normans and then corrupted, the surname "Jaques" (pron. "jakes") has
been around as an English name at least since the Crusades.

Like this:     And since there are several ways that that can be pronounced
(in Cantonese it\'s "mou"), I will clarify:  

OK, I know that was obnoxious, please forgive me... I couldn\'t help it!  I
just couldn\'t resist-- I can\'t believe this thread is still going!

The vowel is the same in both syllables and is almost an "ee" but with a
little bit of "ih" to it.  Just like the singer Kiri Te Kanawa, as someone
else mentioned.

Well, I don\'t know if this can happen in the USA or anywhere else,
but there was a murder here in Norway, were in the criminal case, the
kid (who was charged of killing his cousine) was found not quilty, while
when the killed girls parents brought him up on civil charges, they
were awarded several hundred thousand Norwegian kroner. 

Not guilty, son, but you still have to pay.


ObTrav: A planet with several types of courts might have you aqquited
        in one, but when the charges are brought before another, with 
        no relations to the first, you pay. Only the lawyers of the
        world would know which court would be the best for your case.

I\'ve had it for about a week now.  :)  I have found the browser that comes
with it sucks, so I just use Powerdesk98\'s Explorer and double-click on the
.PDF files since I already have Acrobat 4.0 installed.  No, I have not
bookmarked any Traveller items.  Go for it.

Very few have read the selective service regs, either. When you enlist, you
enlist for X years active duty, y years inactive ready reserve (where you
can be recalled to duty on a whim), and X+Y= 8years, measured from latest
REENLISTMENT... (I read the fine print very carefully... besides, I know 8
or 9 people who were recalled during Desert Storm, including a SFC (Sgt,
1st class)  who\'d RETIRED... and a SgtMaj who got recalled after retiring
about 3 years ago for a period of 6 months.... And the last time the
unorganized militia was called out was Vietnam... via the selective service
program (aka, the Draft). And, based upon that process, if the unorganized
milita is called up, they can keep you for duration plus 6 months, or 8
years, whichever is longer.

Ob Traveller: IMTU, there is no standing Imperial Army below the Army
level; said units comprise an "Army" HQ per world, with a unified COACC,
Army, and Wet Navy HQ based upon each world, An Army Group HQ per subsector
or minor polity, and a Sector Army HQ per sector. The "Imperial" forces of
each world are called into Imperial Duty when needed, and affixed to the
appropriate HQ. Note that officers transferred to imperial service in the
HQ\'s may not serve in the "Imperial HQ" for their world of origin. The
"non-imperial" forces are like state organized militias: they only serve
off world by order of the world government... Note that an HQ for an Army
Level organization is probably about a battalion, and would include a lot
of enlisted specialists. I came to this based upon the material in COACC
(for MT, by GDW)... but I\'d been leaning towards it anyway.

Also Ob Traveller, under such a system, how common would it be for the
really adventuresome to hop to a nearby major world to get into a mroe
prestigious army???

IMTU, Yes! But his Huscarles better be able to enforce it. Then again,
IMTU, an elected official making anti-imperial rules is committing Treason,
since while ruling a world he holds "Honorary Baron" status... IMTU, all
rulers are required to swear fealty to AT LEAST the subsector Duke, and
though him to the Emperor and the Sector Duke. Refusal is Sedition, and
grounds for Imperial Arrest. Then again, I have 3 basic social classes
imperium wide: Noble, Citizen, and Subject... individual worlds may have
more, but the difference between citizen and subject is service in some
imperially approved carreer, in which some imperial service occurs. Minimum
4 years of service.

Appeals go up the chain, fist the subsector duke, then the sector duke,
then the Archduke (if in place), and then the emperor. If in a "Member
polity", their noble is the first appeal. Certain member polities have
appeal directly to their viceroy, and then the emperor, For example, the
Vegan Autonomous District, and a few others.

I allow Citizens and Nobles appeal to the nobles in civil and criminal
trials. In the case of Nobles, the local moot actually hears the appeal,
with the subsector duke as Presiding Judge, and the members as the
appellate-jury. Also, IMTU, Nobles MUST have a trial by Jury, including at
least 1 noble.

And MJ Dougherty has. He (I assume this person is a he but if not, my
appologies) contacted me via private mail and said that 
Carlos is correct. It was a deliberate re-working and no an error.

I liked the courtroom where they convicted the guy of assasinating the 
*politician* for trying to introduce income tax, then set him free with his 
machete and told him to pass it down to his heirs with pride.  <grin>

Sounds like those New Texans had their heads on straight to me...

I have a surname problem, too. Most persons I deal with mispronounce my

Postman or Hahstman, sometimes Horstman...

Nee, two: Several players in my games have chosen Vilani characters, or at
least one s with Vilani names. Some of the Prize winners:

	Kaduum Dakhuumnaakhakh (this is the shortened form...)
	Vladim Shushugliar (mixed ancestry, Solani first name)
	Shuushuurishuu

And the vargr ones also sometimes get ridiculous, to, but the one time I

Same happened to OJ Simpson. It happens regularly in the US. Shouldn\'t be
allowed (They should really be combined, to to double jeopardy), but they
aren\'t. And in the US, civil cases are generally by "preponderance of the
evidence" versus "beyond a reasonable doubt". There was apparently
reasonable doubt in the criminal trial, but the civil trial found it to be
"more likely than not" that he killed his ex.

Ob Traveller, at what law levels would the trials go from Reasonable doubt
to Preponderance. Or would it even be related. (I generally roll vs the law
level or less for Preponderance for each category: Civil, Criminal,
Merchantile. I also roll for a double jeopardy allowance the same way).

Rebellion\'s Sourcebook, I think. "Nail Mission" at the end of it gave 
the PCs a TJ to get across Corridor and Vland to Gushemege\'s Depot... 
used it to start a campaign once. Tell you, it is *hell* to keep

There were no heavy cavalry units here in the colonies.  There were
plenty in Europe.

Reputedly, MS was \'planning\' on carving itself up *before* the antitrust suit 
got to the Justice Department.  Besides, MS has some nice land to sell you.  
Very liberal zoning laws; you can do anything you want on it, as long as you 
can do it in 20, 25 meters of water...

I\'m gonna have to keep that one in mind.  It\'s *truly* evil.  Especially if the local government impounds all the convict\'s assets to *PAY* for it all.  <grin>

Worse, they *could* rig it so if a pirate copy of Win2000 logs into a MS

> Ob Trav....you got me. <G>

The local\'s computer net needs to be accessed by a special software pack that 
interfaces the ship\'s computer to the local net.  The pack costs 100KCr and 
is non-transferable.  It\'s *also* dated, and when it expres, you gotta pay 
*another* 100KCr to get another license.  And although the locals only have 
TL10 computers, this pack was designed and built on a TL15 mainframe 3 
parsecs away, and it is *VERY* paranoid about alien software.  It crashes and 
burns periodically, seemingly without cause or reason.  But all local 
mainframes run it, and \'crash & burn\' if it\'s erased.  On top of all that, 
it\'s the *law* that the special protocols in this one piece of software be 
used for all network transactions.

And yeah, if you try pirating the software, any net server will issue a 
\'meltdown\' command to unconditionally erase and reformat your entire system 
randomly, writing the changes directly into priviliged storage so the changes 
cannot be undone.  Installing the software yourself is allowed, but 
installing the license server takes a local tech 3 hours to do for each 
workstation (after payment of the appropriate license fees, of course!!!), 
else the software acts like a pirated version.  <grin>

Could be perfectly reasonable (for certain values of reasonable). I
think one recent case involved corporations giving stuff to the Secretary
of Agriculture. The corps were convicted (pled guilty even?) while the
(now former) SecAg was acquitted.

Criminal vs. civil action. cf O.J. Simpson. 

In the US, obtaining a criminal conviction (where you may go to jail
and/or have certain right stripped) requires a higher degree of proof
than a civil judgement (where you simply have money/property taken
away or other actions compelled). It can appear maddeningly nonsensical,
but the criminal acquittal often is a result of the state being
sloppy in its case (cf O.J. Simpson).

Actually, there are number of instances of privately owned cannon along
the frontier. 

I can\'t comment on "heavy cavalry", since what that means to *me* is
knoghts in armor which are obsolete by this time.

There\'s an issue of National Geographic from around 20-30 years back.
It has a Moslem documenting his pilgrimage with phots and writing a
nice article as well. There\'s a good picture of the Kaaba (the big
square building that houses the stone) and I think there was even a
good picture of the stone itself.

Actually, that\'s more due to TL differences. With the tech the Iraqis
had, they *were* camoflauged and/or "behind cover".

Imagine their shock when it became clear that as far as *our* gear was
concerned, they had neither.

One of the sparks that set off the Paris Commune revolution in 1871 was an
attempt to confiscate the cannon of the Paris National Guard.  

When France surrendered at the end of the Franco-Prussian War, the new
(Republican) government that had replaced Napoleon the Third was supposed
to hand over all their artillery to the Germans.

The National Guard claimed that as their guns had been bought with money
raised by public subscriptions, they were private property, rather than
property of the state, and therefore were not covered by the deal.  They
got away with it!  (At least until the Commune was suppressed.)

So there, at least, was a case where the general populace had cannon.

"bonus". They had an article about the balloon that set the record by
floating non-stop around the world. 

A point I hadn\'t considered was that these balloons fly well above
breathable air and are thus actually *sealed* environments ars far as
air and water are concerned (possible wastes also). 

From the diagram of the capsule, it\'s pretty obvious that you can get
the life support consumables for 2-3 people for at least 3 weeks into a
space the size of a small closet! (The flight took 19 days, and \'d have
to assume they had some reserves).

Once I get my web browser running again I may have to go digging for
details about the life support arrangements. 

But in essence, all those big tanks outside were propane tanks for the
burner. The cabin had  lithium hydroxide canisters to remove CO2, a
tank of LOX to replace oxygen that was used, and a tank of LN2 to
replace nitrogen in the event of a major loss of pressure. 

I assume heating used the propane, burned with external air. No mention
was made of what they did about excess humidity, though given the
typical outside temps they could easily have *frozen* or at least
condensed it out and then dealt with it via the waste disposal system
(whatever that may have been). 

In any case, this looks like another data point pointing towards *low*
life support costs for air and probably water. 

Since I have *no* firm date for when I get the system that can do web
browsing up again, I\'d be grateful if someone else decided to track
this down and post the info to the list.

Leonard, it is a 5-CD set with the entire 250 issues of Dragon Magazine in
.pdf format.  Nothing has been omitted from the magazines including the
flyers and advertisements.  the magazines all appear exactly as they did
when published.  The CD comes with it\'s own browser but I think you\'ll find
just exploring it on your own to be better.

Good gawd, there\'s *that* many of me running around the universe?!?

I\'ve been in rock fights in high school and sparred black belts when I

Tae Kwon Do in college.

Though there are infinitely more rocks in the universe than black belts, I\'d
rather be hit by a rock. 

At least they usually hit you only once.

VE2 nuclear dampers prevent nuclear explosions (but not power generation)
within their radius of effect. Since the damage done by a nuclear-tipped
missile is a function of range to the target at detonation, this
effectively limits the amount of damage.

It\'s not clear to me, however, that this is a good model of how nuclear
dampers work in Traveller. Traveller nuclear dampers are point-effect, not
area-effect, weapons that have to be targetted on each individual missile.

You forgot long term access space for the power plant, I think: 304 spaces
+ 1196 = 1,500. Did you also figure using long tons (2,240 lbs) rather than
short tons (2,000 lbs)? That might account for the apparent weight difference.

My plan is to reinstate the crew requirement from HG: 1 crewman per 100
dtons of weapons. These are mostly technicians. Since the spinal mount is
fired by pointing the entire ship, it falls to the Chief Pilot to aim it.
There may or may not be a separate Gunnery Officer pulling the trigger.

The surface area of turrets and bays is calculated for just that portion
which is outside the hull proper. It is in addition to the hull armor
primarily because that\'s the way VE2 handles turret superstructures; it
also avoids arguments about whether the hull is more vulnerable under the
turret (it\'s not). Bays in GT2/e went back to being Honking Big Turrets.
GT: Starships will present both versions (internal and external bays) as
options. Internal bays will not require separate armoring.

Problem is, Hamilcar has a type 6 atmosphere too.  That isn\'t very
Europa-like.

(Don\'t worry.  I\'ve got a handwave for this one.  It actually leads to a
pretty interesting world description, although I have to invoke the Ancients
to do it. . .)

Have one of the major components suffer a fake malfunction. This means that when they run a self-diagnostic program, it gets convinced that there\'s something wrong with some esoteric part. The characters can check it, "repair" it or even replace it, and the program is still convinced there\'s something wrong. Finding out the problem with the electronics involved in the self-diagnostics can take time. (Especially when the "malfunction" is on some vital piece of machinery, and it can\'t be used because of inbuilt safeties.)

Nope.  At this point the list (now TravCult) is mostly occupied with

Then there is the attractive female co-worker from west Texas who said, upon
being asked about a long, tough contract negotiation meeting with one of our
customers, "As soon as ah got outa there, I felt like I been rode hard and
put
up wet."

She also raises horses, you see...

The looks on everyone\'s faces in the staff meeting (including hers when she
realized what she said) were absolutely priceless.

And I\'m sure that as (I am told) many mosques have a plaque or other
indicator indicating the direction of of Mecca now, offworld mosques
might well have some sort of indicator controlled by a computer. 

For personal use, something incorporating a gps type system might work.

I do agree that the direction would too little to worry about when
taking even a jump 6 in the Marches. I was being a bit disingenious
with regard to prayers in jump, knowing that some scholars will nitpick
doctrines to death, and it might be argued that one couldn\'t know the
right direction while in jump.

As a practical matter, it should be possible to ask the Astrogator
which way Earth is, and ask the captain to orient the ship in such a
manner that one can easily pray in the right direction (ie so that the
"proper direction" is towards the ceiling or the like.

I expect that it\'d depend on just how Orthodox the Jew in question was.

Think there\'s a chance that for those places, they\'d go by the
calculated time of the new moon?

BTW, our moon is likely to be very unusual. Consider the situation on
Mars. There are two moons, and you get "new moon" once a *day* for one
of them. And as I recall the other will be "new" at least 2-3 times a
week. 

Then there\'s the places like Regina, which *are* Moons. At least if you
lived on the "inner" hemisphere, "new moon" would be easy to determine.
It\'d occur as the shadow of your moon crossed the center line of the
gas giant you were orbiting. Alas, it\'d occur about once a (standard)
week, and would always be at *midnight* local time.

Yep. See some of the ones above. I\'m sure the imams(?) will come up

From anyplace beyond Lunar Orbit, the difference betwen "towards Earth"
and "towards Mecca" would require precision instruments to determine.
From another star, I\'m not sure it could be done. 

The trick is determining "towards Earth". Or "towards Sol" if you are
outside the solar system.

Well, as far as kosher goes, you\'ll need a ruling by a rabbi. But given
the way the rules are laid out, animal products should be fairly easy
to classify as kosher/non-kosher. The hard part will be if there aren\'t
any native, edible, animals that chew cuds or have the right sort of
hooves. Likewise, finding things that meet the definitions for other
types of creature may be difficult.

And I wouldn\'t know where to begin with plants.

That I find unlikely. More likely, though not completely likely, is
that they might go to a calculation based calendar. In essence, they\'d
*calculate* when the new moon would be occuring at Mecca.

Not so silly question. What did that Saudi who flew on the Space
Shuttle do about prayer times? After all, the Shuttle has a sunrise
every 90 to 100 minutes.

Or, as in the latest Vorkosigan book, an ancient laws may provide a
means of dealing with a *new* problem without having to pass a new law.

For those who haven\'t read it, I\'ll just say it involves a count trying
to use uterine replicators to "mass produce" people for his county. The
solution is both appropriate and *priceless*.

Would you care to be invited to fire a 40 pounder on the coast? Say

The Iraqis proved to be very clever.  They would haul wrecked tanks into
fighting positions, and light fires in the engine compartments, while
driving a working tank into the posotion previously occupied by the junked
vehicle.  When the Coalition planes came back, they\'d hit the same wreck
over an over again.

Inside Iraq, airfield personel became very adept at painting craters on
runways, to convince USAF photo recon specialists that the runway way
indeed out of service.

An Iraqi armor commander, captured on the second day of the war, put it best:

"I entered Kuwait with 48 T-72s.  After a month of air attacks, I had 45.
After an hour of combat with the M1, I had none."

Now to turn this into an adventure idea:

PCs come across a STL generation vessel, with several thousand 
members of some minor race held in Cold Sleep.  Probably no info 
available to translate the linguistics of the computer records, and 
everything on board indicates that this is a colony ship of some form 
or another.

If PCs initiate the automated unthawing processes, about a thousand
people are released, and start rampaging.  Further investigating
may reveal that these are convicts who are being sent to found a
penal colony due to inhumane acts of an incredibly vile nature (at
least according to their culture, anyway,) and their homeworld has
forced them into this exile as punishment.

The PCs are horribly outnumbered by a bunch of TL 8 goons, and may
possibly be taken by surprise.  If they can get away, (after a very
exciting escape sequence,) notifying the Imperial authorities should
take care of the colony ship drifting between the stars.  But if the
leader of the convicts can manage to keep the PCs alive, then there\'s
the trip back to the cons\' homeworld, where the leader hopes to exact 
vengeance against those who did this to him, and the PCs have the 
only ship capable of FTL transit that he has access to.  :)

Just a thought,

No, because an Aslan clan can\'t afford to outfit very many of their _ihatei_.
And that isn\'t based on an economic analysis alone. When the Loaktarl Clan,
the dominant clan of four subsectors containing 7 high-population worlds,
outfitted an _ihatei_ fleet for the first time in a generation, it consisted
of ten ships carrying 10,000 apiece (or was it 50,000? No, I think the

Sure. And the fact that the Aslans suddenly percieved a weakness where none
had been before had nothing to do with their change of mind? Riiiight...

Aslans are just as capable of situational ethics as, say, the ancient
Japanese damyios...

With regards to warships, many if not most merchant ships were armed with 
cannon during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.  Granted, they did 
not have the broadside of a Frigate, but they did have respectable 
firepower for the time.

"Hardwired" was the source book for the Hardwired universe created by
Walter Jon Williams, and included the \'delightful\' cybersnake.

The Cyberpunk source book for George Alec Effinger\'s universe was called
"When Gravity Fails" after the novel.

I\'d *love* to see them do something like that. But they won\'t. Not if
their lawyers hear about it in time.

You see, there\'s a *clear* legal precedent on *that* trick, dating back
to a consultant who rigged his software to wip a company\'s mainframe if
they didn\'t pay his bill on time (or some such). 

The court ruled that he\'d have been within his rights to have his
software quit working, destroying the data (and other programs) which
did *not* belong to him was \\n\'t acceptable, Therefore he came under
the laws for malicious destruction of the files. 

MS would lose *bigtime* in court over a stunt like that.

Assuming you mean ecosystem, it depends on what you mean by \'entirely unique\'. For larger lifeforms, speciation should take in the tens or hundreds of thousands of years, less significant changes would occur faster.  It\'s pretty unlikely that a generation ship would remain viable anywhere near that long, however.

Actually, it depends on your sources.  First of all, area effect dampers _are_ possible in FF&S, they just don\'t cover enough area to help against detlasers and so aren\'t used much (and have really vague rules, which doesn\'t help).  Second, I don\'t recall CT ever specifying how they worked, but they seemed to be a single large system onboard a warship, which suggested they probably were area dampers.

Then there was the Rodney King beating case a few years back - some
Los Angeles, California police officers got a bit too enthusiastic in their
apprehending of one Rodney King, who was resisting arrest...and 
someone got it on videotape.

The officers were acquitted of using excessive force- apparently it wasn\'t 
clear to the jury just how much Mr. King was actually resisting, and 
they could not get to the beyond reasonable doubt stage. Mr. King
proceeded to sue, of course (taking the officers to civil court), as
expected. What I did not expect was for the United States Federal 
Government to charge the officers with violating Mr. King\'s civil rights. It 
looked like the government had decided that this high-profile, emotionally
charged circus of a case needed a guilty verdict for spin purposes,
and tried to create a guilty verdict themselves when the courts in 
California did not do so.

Heheh.  Shades of \'Captain Proton\', from the cheesy sci fi wannabe show.

I\'m still a bit captivated over Joseph Dietrich\'s TU, and would
like to set out some ideas for anyone who is also a bit captivated.

I had another think last night.  His milieu might not even be 4th
Imperium... if his jumpgates are "ancient", then it might be the
5th Imperium... and by that time, they might not call it the Imperium
anymore because it might not really inherit enough meaningful
traditions from the Imperia of the past... or for that matter, the
powers-that-be might take on the names of past empires while
not really having much in common with them... for instance, there
could be an extended Rebellion-era setting that has empires
scattered throughout the regions of the previous 3I, and some of
them would be named after the local Rebellion-era heroes.

Even with the Virus era, the empires which follow may well
use ancient local references to bolster their legitimacy.

Since Dulinor is dead either way, there would be no "Dulinor Empire";
however, there would be a Regency of Deneb, probably a Ziru Sirka,
an "Imperium" which may well be not much more than Core -- it might
even be called the Sylean Empire, who knows?

I would like to fit Joseph\'s TU into my TU.  So to morph an official
TU into JTU, I\'d send the 3I through the Rebellion:

1116  Rebellion
1125  Collapse, with or without Virus
1200  New Era or equivalent
1500  4th Imperium, jumpgates and all (TL17-18?)
1800  Disintegration of the 4I.
2000  JTU

Hardwired.  Used to have that around here somewhere.

"Hardwired" was the Cyberpunk sourcebook for the book of the same
name - a cyberpunk universe with much simpler computers, and much
more complex drugs.

The Cyberpunk supplement for the "When Gravity Fails" series carried
the "When Gravity Fails" title.

Very odd scenario in it as well, as befitting the series it came from.

Ah, but their shrinkware license, the one that says, \'if you break this seal, 
you agree to our licensing terms\', *also* says that the product is *not* 
warranted to be or do *anything* on anybody\'s computer, and MS is *not* to be 
held liable for any data loss, computer malfs, or mother in law visits that 
may occur from attempted useage of the software.

I don\'t think so.  I think they could get away with contending that they\'re not responsible for damages resulting from illegal useage of their software, especially in regards to their shrinkware license.

Good to know I\'ve been doing it the wrong way for 17 years ... guess there 
isn\'t much point to changing now ...

\'Hardwired\' was *also* a story by Walter Jon Williams, one of the better

Thanks Kevin, that was the book R Talsorian Games\' "Hardwired"
sourcebook is based on - I wasn\'t as clear as I should have been,
and the author\'s name had escaped me.

I was always under the impression they were field-effect screens, at least
until TNE. MegaTraveller (which I cut my teeth on) seemed to treat them as
such -- no ND turrets, just screen packages.

Short tons are what I used. Is this correct or incorrect? Question: Why do
spinal mounts use cf/50 for volume, when they would seem to be completely
enclosed in the hull (after all, the ship is built around it) and thus
subject to the cf/20 requirement?

>The surface area of turrets and bays is calculated for just that portion

Except that a turret is 3 spaces, right? Plus 1 in the hull for crewstation
and turning mechanism? The surface area of 800 would seem to suggest that
the turret is armored in it\'s entirety, as if it were completely
free-standing cube seperate from the hull (1,500 cf = 800 sf surface area,
according to GV). The 50-space bays are the same.

>My plan is to reinstate the crew requirement from HG: 1 crewman per 100
>dtons of weapons. These are mostly technicians.

I ended up doing this for the Type T NPAWS I designed -- 30 crew stations.
I actually came pretty close to the canonical size 3,001 spaces, with a
damage of 6d x 16,700. I\'ll post the cruiser once I get it finished tonight
or this weekend.

Another question: What are good ballpark figures for warship armor? The
Type T spinal mount is the largest NPAWs available to the Imperium
historically, and as I have it figured its maximum possible damage is
601,200 (and averaging around 350,700). The CA-15 has an armor value of 80
(1080 cm hard steel) in MT, which is roughly DR 29,760. The Type T\'s going
to go right through that, but it\'ll still take several hits to kill the
ship (it\'s got lots of hitpoints). OTOH, according to FSotSI, a BB-15, with
an armor value of 120 is going to have a DR of somthing like 6,000,000,
which seems unreasonable by an order of magnitude, at least.

Whaaa! I want that G:Starships book to come out *now*. ;-)
