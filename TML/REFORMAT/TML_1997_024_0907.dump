Given that lasers more or less cannot miss due to errors in aiming the beam
where one wants it you can still miss due to evasion of the target and
lightlag. Here\'s some calculations (this is a rehash previously posted by
me but as it seems to have gone totally unnoticed Ill repost it);=A8



I\'m in the process of revamping my space combat system and would like some
input on certain assumtions. I don\'t use grav focussed in my current system =
but
I will still discuss them here.

Assumtion 1:
The difficulty in hitting a ship with a laser is not due to random spread of
beams while firing but rather timelag from when you get the sensordata and t=
he
time the beam/pulse arrives. This means that if a ship is accelerating strai=
ght
with no variance in accleration value nor direction a shot always hits as lo=
ng
as it is within sensor resolving range. This means that what a ship defends
with is it\'s evasive acceleration and in order for such maneuvering to be
effective it has to accelerate a distance at least as long as the ships radi=
us.
(Note that all (I hope) equations follow mathematical operator precedence to
avoid unneccessary parenthesis.)

The formula for accelerated distance is:
(1) s =3D at^2/2
a =3D acceleration in m/s^2, 1G =3D 9.81 m/s^2

The timelag for sensor/beamtravel is target to sensor and back again with
lightspeed. We need to make two measurements to get a velocity value and thr=
ee
for acceleration value of the target. Assume we need to know the location,
velocity and acceleration of the target, this gives us:
(2) t =3D 6R/c where
R =3D range to target, c =3D 3E8 m/s (slightly less actually, I know)

The distance the target needs to accelerate to be effective is about a ships
radius which if assuming the ship is a cube is aproximately:
(3) r =3D v^(1/3)/2
v =3D ships volume in m^3

Now, plug (2) into (1) gives us:
(4) s =3D a(6R/c)^2/2 which becomes s =3D a18R^2/c^2

The range at which a certain shipsize with a certain evasion acceleration ge=
ts
effective we\'ll find by assuming (4) equals (3):
(5) v^(1/3)/2 =3D a18R^2/c^2

Shuffle the terms about to get R as a function of the other terms:
(6) R =3D (c^2*v^(1/3)/(36a))^(1/2) which looks better like:
(6) R =3D c(v^(1/3)/(36a))^(1/2)

Now, plug some numbers into (6) to see what we get. Assume a type S scout wh=
ich
in your universe is 1400 m^3 and definately not a sphere but we leave that
aside for now. It evades with all its acceleration of 2G. This gives us:
c =3D 3E8, v =3D 1400, a =3D 2*9.81 and from (6) R =3D 37.8 thousand=
 kilometers or
about one hex in space combat.

What does this tell us? That given the above assumtions a ship that fires on=
 a
100 dTon ship that evades with 2G will be automatically hit if the range is
less than a hex. That\'s OK in the current system as most space combat will b=
e
at 1 hex or more. How about an Azhanti High lightning?
According to Fighting Ships it is 60 000 dTons agility =3D 0(?) so we use 2G=
 for
our calculations. This gives us:
c =3D 3E8, v =3D 840 000, a =3D 2*9.81 and R =3D 109.6 thousand kilometers=
 or 3 hexes
or less. You cannot miss an Azhanti if it is within 3 hexes and evades at 2G=
.

I like these figures but you may not. We can handwave in the computer DM fro=
m
High Guard with this assumtion. The timelag calculation ignores the time
required to analyze sensordata in equation (2). If we assume a base time for
computation denoted p (for processing) and add this to (2)
(2b) t =3D p + 6R/c
Plug (2b) into (1) gives us:
(4b) s =3D a(p + 6R/c)^2/2 which becomes s =3D a(p^2+12pR/c+36R^2/c^2)
Equalling with (3) gives us
(5b) v^(1/3)/2 =3D a(p^2+12pR/c+36R^2/c^2)
What this leaves us is left as an exercise for the reader but basically it
works as the processing time adds a fixed range to the actual shooting range
R+ =3D pc/6 and for a 1s processing time (too long to be realistic but remem=
ber
that this is for handwaving purposes) R+ =3D 50 thousand kilometers or about=
 2
hexes.

Comments are welcome.

All my calculations have been made with the 15 trillion figure (excepting
any one where I\'ve made decimal errors, of course ;-)

I\'m 99% sure that I have seen the 15 trillion figure somewhere in an
official publication, but the last time I tried to track down the
reference, I failed to find it. Wildstar did some calculations where
he actually summed up the populations of the individual planets and
IIRC he arrived at 16 trillion, but I forget just what source he got
the information from.

15 trillion is an average of 1.5 billion per planet, which is of the
same order of magnitude as the average you get from the world generation
system (exact figure depends on how you establish the population multiplier
for pop A worlds), so I\'m going to stick to that for the moment.

Can we get rid of the 100-diam limit rule. Most canon sources say its a
simplification of gravitic disturbance so I\'ve used the gravity strength at
100 diams of a size 8 density 1 planet as a baseline but perhaps this was
not a good solution.

What about the jumpdistance disturbance is dependent on tidal force or the
gradient of gravity? This drops off as 1/r^3 which is pretty nice. Here\'s a
simple table comparing the various options:

Jumpdistance normalized to 100 diam canon on size 8 planet

Size    Canon   1/r     1/r^2   1/r^3
=========================================
1       0.13    0.00    0.04    0.13
2       0.25    0.02    0.13    0.25
3       0.38    0.05    0.23    0.38
4       0.50    0.13    0.35    0.50
5       0.63    0.24    0.49    0.63
6       0.75    0.42    0.65    0.75
7       0.88    0.67    0.82    0.88
8       1.00    1.00    1.00    1.00
9       1.13    1.42    1.19    1.13
10      1.25    1.95    1.40    1.25

The 1/r^3 rule give us the same jumpranges as canon. They main advantage is
that we can now calculate the jumprange for other densities of planets as
well (multiply with D^(1/3) where D = 1.0 for normal planets). The best
advantage however is that jumpdistances for stars will be MUCH shorter than
the 100 diamters and therefore we will rarely need to bother with them
(quick now how many of you referees consider the stars diamter when
determining travel times to jump?)

Why not have a diacritic which doubles vowels, and another
diacritic which softens consonants?

So your mapping may be

A   B   D   E   G   I   K   L   M   N   P   R   S   U   Z   <-- \'plain\'
AA                  II                          SH  UU  ZH  <-- with diac.

This is easy to map.  Normal font lowercase, diacriticized
font as uppercase.

>My thinking on punctuation is that it should be different enough from

If instead they looked like characters, then the script would
probably look more alien and undecipherable, which is just
fine by me... after all, if you know the tricks then it\'s
easy, otherwise it\'s difficult.  SO: some of your PCs could
be familiar with the tricks of Bilandian -- the Vilani PCs --
and be able to read the font, while the others are in the dark.

Ooh ooh, Mistah Kottah, how about this if you want weird:
26 half-characters, which form a letter when combined.
This makes life horribly difficult for transcription, of course.
But it allows an oodle of combinations.

Or, have half-characters follow the "Tengwar" system developed by
JRR Tolkien, which may simplify things a bit (or not):

Character Map:

0	p-series character (p, b)
1	k-series character (k, g)
2	s-series character (s, z, sh, zh)
3	n-series character (n, m)
4	liquid-series char (l, r)
5	d-series character (d)

6	a-series character (a, aa)
7	e-series character (e)
8	i-series character (i, ii)
9	u-series character (u, uu)

A	consonant-unvoiced character (formal use only)

C	consonant-aspirated character
D	consonant-voiced+aspirated character

E	vowel-short character (formal use only)
F	vowel-long character

G	number-tag character

The reason Tolkien did this is because he saw four basic series
for consonant sounds: unvoiced, voiced, aspirated, and voiced-aspirated.
For instance:

unvoiced	voiced		aspirated	voiced-aspirated
t		d		th		dh  (as in "the")
p		b		f		v
k		g		kh (ch?)	gh (j?)


Since the half-characters in the character map are unique, pairs
can have either half-character leading, perhaps giving some
kind of nuance in meaning.

Also, there are so many pairs with unassigned values, it may
very well be that the most common three or four Vilani words
may have their own characters.

Ok, just some brainstorms.

In another forum, I\'m involved in an argument about this film.  My opponent
is saying that any war movie with moral and thoughtful content is doomed to
failure.  I keep pointing out "Platoon", "All Quiet on the Western Front",
"Catch-22", and "Full Metal Jacket" to make my point.  Sad really.. at a
party the other night we managed to come up with ways to include most of
the important points Heinlein made without turning the film into a film
about lecture halls.

Haven\'t read the comic, but I will plead guilty to admiring the amazing
variety of uniforms the Germans had during the Third Reich.  The Imperial
Marine uniform I\'m designing is a cross between Victorian British and the
Luftwaffe.  Interesting, really..

Saw it last night at the theater\'s test screening (Kirsten used to work
there, so we get in for neat events.)  By halfway through, we were heckling
the film so badly it sounded like an episode of MST3K.

During the Gulf War, the Public Affairs Office of the 101st Air Assult

jounalists, and placed the following in front of their building:

This is definitely the case, especially when you are doing body text (as
opposed to headlines).

Another thing: Would the letterforms of this typeface be easy to handwrite?
One of the biggest problems that I see with a lot of imanginary typefaces
are their inefficiency of form. It\'s just so difficult to write in Aurabesh
(the Star Wars font) or Klingo!

Of course, I am not certain how much of this is a cultural effect -- maybe
if you grow up with it, you learn how to write the letterforms of any
language quickly.

Yep. Which presupposes you have the infrastructure to support a pirate

An independant pirate wouldn\'t just stash the stuff on some planetoid,
if he was smart. He would use resources of some larger organization,
crime syndicate, etc...

That\'s a good point. So I guess I should have said there will very,
very, few _successful_ independent pirates. :-) And these bozos
attempting half-assed piracy will just keep anti-piracy units on their
toes and make "serious" pirates\' jobs that much more difficult.

[off-topic]
Speaking of scams and invoices... our company yesterday received an
invoice from someplace in Spain called "World Telecommunication" for an
"updated/corrected registration text/socitation for the International
Directory & CD-rom 1997/98." the paid inscription includes a free
CD-ROM.

All for a mere US$996.00. This thing *was* an invoice, for all intents
and purposes, including a pink copy etc. An invoice for something we
never ordered. I imagine many plebs working for larger faceless
organizations would send payment without consulting a higher authority.

Anyone hear of this scam? Anyone know where to go to stamp out such
things? The "invoice" includes email & web-page addresses... any ideas?

I agree. Random encounters would be of the more common, incompetant

Sounds like Mr. Referee runs an interesting Traveller Campaign. :)

Thanks for bringing my points down to earth. In general, I agree with
your perception of piracy. I\'ve seen games where the Ref. made it too
easy for the players to commit piracy, which is why I wanted to
emphasize the inherant difficulty and problems a pirate would encounter.

I guess that\'s where we disagree. I think the relative size of the
Imperium has no bearing. I believe the Imperium, being a large but
feudal (highly federal) organization, would notice things like starships
being stolen.

Just because, as an aggregate, there are many tens or hundreds of
thousands of starships in the entire Imperium doesn\'t mean that the
planetary or subsector level (gov\'d by dukes, marquis\' etc.) wouldn\'t
notice or bother.

Scout ships are not "given away", the scouts that fly them are on
detached duty.

It doesn\'t *need* to make a ripple outside the subsector level. My point
is the Imperium is a Feudal organization, there is no _one_ person
pulling all the strings allocating anti-piracy forces throughout the
_entire_ Imperium. Sector and subsector admirals are relatively
independant of one another.

Here you have a valid point. But a ship being stolen through conflict
will make a lot of noise. Local sensors will see a conflict, and it will
be noticed. Ship\'s skipping and misjumping are another matter.

Au contraire, on that point we agree. Piracy is possible, and your
estimate of the numbers of pirates is reasonable. I just don\'t think the
majority of these pirates will be acting alone, without the support of
an outside organization.

And *because* it is so rare, any piracy that happens *will* be noticed,
and anti-piracy forces will be placed on alert.

Well, I think the info is very difficult to come by, and it requires
some serious covert intelligence skills. That\'s why I think a pirate
acting alone needs contacts and a backing org.

Yes, but not everything fits into every market.

As an example, let me use a real-world example: the bidet. You highjack
a shipment of bidet (bidets?) off the coast of France. Jumping to
America, you try to find a buyer in the streets of New York. How easy is
that going to be?

Even if you do find a buyer in NYC, I suspect they will not require as
many as the original destination buyer in Paris. You\'ll lose money. You
won\'t be able to sell them all.

It will be a similar situation in Traveller. Each world will have many
markets, with different customs, requirements, Tech Levels, tastes... it
will be very difficult to fence on another planet, products destined for
one specific market.

I\'m not talking fleets, I\'m just talking backing. Not only do you gotta
know the "right" people, but you have to no *a lot* of "right" people,
in order to move the goods, find a suitable market in which to fence,
pay for damage to your ship, know cargoes needed, etc.

So you have to be really experienced and really good, or have a lot of
friends and outside support.

pulsar is a few million years old its rotation will have slowed enough that
it\'s not producing pulses any more. After that it\'ll be nearly undetectable - 
the surface will be quite hot but the surface area is so small that its
luminosity is essentially zero. No non-pulsar neutron star has currently
been detected (that I know of); you\'d have to pick it up through gravitational
microlensing or suchlike. There was a recent HST paper about flux measurements
from the surface of a relatively old pulsar - Pavlov, Welty and Cordova 
1997 ApJ 489 (November 1) L75; I think they got a surface temperature of 10^6
kelvin. Note that the crab-style nebula will be gone long before 10^6 years
(particularly since the pulsar often gets a few hundred or thousand km/s of
kick...)

There are mechanisms to "spin up" older pulsars - thought to be accretion off
a stellar companion - which is where millisecond pulsars come from. 

The detected pulsar planets are in the moon - earth mass range, with some
small hint of a jupiter-mass companion in a very wide orbit.

You can, though. If around the thousand\'th digit of pi we had hit a sequence of
digits that spelled out "hi there this is god, sorry about all the confusion
on that birth control issue" in EBCDIC codes, we could be reasonably sure 
that it wasn\'t pure chance (and that we all should rush out and buy IBM.) 
The message in Contact is somewhat deeper than the thousandth digit, but it\'s
long enough and clearly non-random enough that you can put upper limits on
the probability of it arriving by "chance", and that probability will be
pretty low.

Absolutely - the heaviest weapon we had was an SMG, and the player with it
heard a noise in the tank and looked around the corner, leading with his
gun. It was very messy when it was wrenched out of his hand and he was
dragged away below.

When Nick Munn ran \'Valentines\' Rose\' at Stabcon, he purposely wound me up
by concealing a copy of Death Station in his notes, and then letting me see
it!

(Nick - have you submitted the scenario to JTAS yet?)

Well, I don\'t say that pirate would _never_ take the whole ship.
I may be that there are rare situations where everything comes
together (crew doesn\'t think to disable jump, don\'t even
bluff fighting off the attack, etc.)

I don\'t agree.  The intellegence, if it is to have any
chance of being in place at time, means there there
has to be someone at every system taking it, noting
what it is, deciding where it need to go, and finding
ships to take the info.  This has to be done for every
single bit of info, for which this info is just one.
Add this to the fact that a ship that is equiped to
defeat a ship that attacks it is also a ship that is
designed to defeat a ship it attacks (which would
be even easier since you can determine the tatical
situation) means that even if you go to the trouble
of getting that info you can\'t really stop piracy
anyway.

Yeah, but the point is that you can\'t detect with sensors
that a ship has extra _armaments_ that are hidden.  And
records can be forged.  There has never been a system
of record keeping in the history of mankind that hasn\'t
had enough people figuring out a way around it to prevent
it from wiping out a type of crime.

Even a megacorp doesn\'t design ships that are bigger than
the trade will support.  There are ships designed to visit
smaller worlds and even if in independant can only afford
a ship 1/2 the size, he is still 2.5 to 5 times bigger than
a system defense boat.

No.  The IN just isn\'t dumb enough to use one buy itself to
stop piracy.  I certainly wouldn\'t object to them being
deployed near enough to aid each other.

Yeah, but we keep saying the same things about it.

Well, I was a little loose on my wording.  I probably should
have said subspecies.  However, 300,000 years and evolving
to a new subspecies is sufficient for thing like when
you breed to change.

Not unless the ancients either took _one_ person or selectively
sent only ones with a certain number of teeth, fingers, etc.
to Zhodane, etc.  The fact is that number of teeth just
doesn\'t vary except in a few individuals (or none at all?)
This is not the same thing as happening to get a lot of
dark haired people in the pool.

Do they.  I thought they all originated from one world.  This
would mean that they are highly unlikely to even qualify
as different subspecies.

Er, I must have missed something. Could you (privately if it\'s a long
explanation) show me the calculations for that?

I think there\'s been a little too much emphasis on assuming that to pick the
right cargo you have to hang about in the starport... on the odd occasion
that pirates have appeared in my games they have generally been hitting a
ship which they knew would be at a given place at a given time, i.e. they\'ve
hit high value shipments of which they have had substantial prior data. This
goes back to the "intelligent pirate" concept, where the pirate operation is
planned weeks/months in advance, like a good bank robbery, rather than being
an opportunist approach (although the latter might occasionally work).

As an example, pirate X knows ship Y will leave planet Z on day A at time B.
Pirate X waits in another system, and relies upon a carefully calculated
jump to bring him into the Z system at approximately the right time to catch
X before he\'s got to his jump point (remember, in my games this can be
several days of travel).

Hans covered much the same point, saying:

>But say that you do arrive at roughly the same time as your victim. Either
>there will be a patrol vessel stationed a some specific spot at the 100
>diameter limit, in which case your victim will aim for that spot...

Again, with the longer distance to come in from 100 diameters, there\'s a far
better chance of intercepting the victim without a patrol boat being
anywhere in the vicinity (100 diameters for some large suns gives an
absolutely huge sphere which would need to be patrolled).

>But I\'m ready to be convinced if you can come up with something a bit
>more well-founded than \'Can too!\'.

As I said, this is one aspect that allows piracy to exist in my game. Given
the simplifications of some Traveller rules (e.g. T4 doesn\'t currently give
extended system generation, star sizes, etc.) which result in all systems
having the jump point 100 *planetary* diameters out, then piracy becomes
that much more difficult. At that point the pirates have to rely upon hiding
in asteroid fields, etc. and it all gets more difficult to justify.

>BTW. all the above assumes that the cargo is not sufficiently valuable that
>your victim (or your victim\'s insurance agent) hires an escort (and that
>the cargo\'s owner dosen\'t send it by a better armed ship).

The \'piracy\' attempt in my game was against a small trader specifically
because said trader was smuggling some very valuable goods and was on a
cheap small ship in order to avoid attention. In fact it came more under the
mega-corp privateering part of piracy than anything else.

>Not really. It gives Mr. Pirate the problem of catching Mr. Victim before
>he gets more than 10 diameters from the planet, when Mr. Pirate has to come
>in several 100 diameters from the planet.

Mr. Victim might not want to chance that mis-jump (in the 10-100 diameter
range, of Mr. Sun, remember, not Mr. Planet) if the alternative is to hand
over the cargo which (a) probably isn\'t his, (b) is hopefully insured
anyway. A mis-jump can be more catastrophic than having your ship shot up if
you end up in deep space - that\'s a pretty horrible and slow death waiting
for the air/food/water to run out...

Some Chinese characters have _18_ individual strokes. (maybe more)
 I do not understand how people can even read them, much less write them 
in small areas. Besides, computerized fonts of a language often bear
little 
to no resemblance to handwritten words. Compare "Times Roman-12" to 
"Third Grader-20". Like, who writes and puts in serifs?

My wife was born in South Africa and grew up speaking English and some
German (long story). At the ripe old age of 26 she decided to learn
Mandarin (as she was living in Taiwan at the time) and now can read
and write around 1000 characters. She even knows some of the 18 stroke
ones. She had no exposure to Chinese before this time and at 26 is
(arguably) well out of her peak learning period (in some psych textbook
they had a study of leanring rates vs age and most people have a 
much harder time learning a language after childhood).

According to her, it\'s not so hard because the characers have logical 
sub-goupings that occur over and over again - \'radicals\'. This means
that an 18 stroke character ends up really only being a 4 or 5 
radical character, which is a bit easier to deal with. At any rate,
my point is that with enough practice it\'s not impossible to learn to
write even the most complex languages.

To me, the main thing about character writability is ergonomic -
how easy is it for the average writer to form the character? Vilani
would probably be easy for any Vilani-like human to write. Aslan
or Vargr, on the other hand, might be tricky for humans to write,
as their "hands" probably have very different ranges of motion.
I think in Chinese there is a bias towards top-left to lower-right
diagonal strokes, as opposed to the other way around due to 
right-hand bias, but I\'m not sure (Chinese writer, please correct me).

Also, under normal curcumstances, I\'d say that you\'d want a character 
set where poorly-formed instances of one character are not easily
confused with another character, but standard ISO-Latin-1 has so
many characters that are easy to deform into another character via
bad handwriting that this isn\'t a big requirement.

This is, I think, more because it\'s what we\'re used to than because of any
objective typeface/neurological interplay.  There\'s a largish body of study
on this sort of thing, and it boils down (IIUC) to there being no
measurable difference in reading speed/accuracy between educated native
users of scripts with or without uppper/lowercase letter forms -- or, for
that matter, between users of alphabetic vs. syllabic or morphophonemic
writing systems.

I think -- Glenn, correct me if I\'m wrong -- but this Bilanidin Bold font
is meant to be just that, a printed font.  It bears the same resemblance to
handwritten Vilani as handwritten English does to whatever font you\'re
reading this message.

Well, it has already been questioned, and argued about, if
those patrols are a) all suited to antipiracy work and
b) numerous enough to even come close to stopping piracy
c) don\'t also already have tasks the antipiracy patrols
would take them away from.

It presumes that you don\'t do reconaissance in force because
the point of that is to make sure your patrols can safely
report back.  The ability to sit where you can jump at
any moment can obviate that need.  Assuming by
anti-logisitics you mean stoping trade raiding
(anti-anti-logistics?) since anti-logistics will
be forays of ships grouped into small fleets into
enemy territory and is not really much for stopping
piracy.  The best way to deal with
this is to set up convoys which, by definition, means
you don\'t have enough ships to patrol every system
to protect every ship.

Survival Margin may refer to the 15 trillion figure.  DGP\'s TD#10 had
figures for the number of Imperial citizens in all sectors, and while
perhaps not entirely reliable, came to 15.77 trillion.  In line with
the Solomani tolerance of tighter spaces, the densest knot of humanity
was centered on Sol by some jiggling of sector generation.  In a note
a long time ago, I added up the figures for the domains based on TD#10.

  The population of the Domains and Independent Sectors breaks down
  as follows (Imperial citizens only?):

  SOL:           4308.0 billion        27.3 %         3.2
  SYLEA:         2846.6 billion        18.1 %         1.5
  ILELISH:       2463.8 billion        15.6 %         1.7
  VLAND:         2301.6 billion        14.6 %         1.3
  ANTARES:       1498.7 billion         9.5 %         1.5
  DENEB:         1223.5 billion         7.8 %         1.6
  GATEWAY:        571.5 billion         3.6 %         1.6
  Verge:          282.5 billion         1.8 %         1.3
  Empty Quarter:  273.7 billion         1.7 %         1.4

  Second column is percentage of the Imperial population.
  Third column of numbers is average population density per system
    in billions of sophonts, if population was spread evenly rather
    than concentrated on 10% of the worlds.  Cultural Solomani seem
    to be about twice as populous as everyone else.
  SOL includes areas administered by sectors in the Domain (Hinters
    and Magyar).
  ANTARES would include Meshan (administered from Lishun), but that\'s
    the only sector I don\'t have an Imperial population summary for.
    It\'s probably insignificant, since there aren\'t many Imperial worlds
    there.

These numbers aren\'t entirely reliable.  I seem to recall actually
adding up the numbers from DGP\'s own sector files later on with a
short program, and only getting 992.3 billion in the Domain of Deneb
for Imperial citizens.  But fifteen to sixteen trillion (10^12) seems
like a reasonable range for 1100.

This is definitely the case for _English Speakers_.

Other script users (japanese, chinese, hangul, arabic, hindu, etc. etc.)
get along just fine without two cases. It is because we are brought up
to read upper/lower case that we find it easier to read.

Large amounts of body text in uppercase don\'t have ascenders and
decenders. Therefore, it is more difficult to read words by "shape".
This is the way most people read: they recognize the shape of the entire
word; they don\'t read letter-by-letter.

In designing an imaginary typeface, it is my humble opinion that two
cases make the new typeface _harder_ to read. You have to memorize two
new forms instead of one. This is the main reason why I chose not to
create a "lower" case for Bilanidin. (The other reason being I have
other priorities for the time I spend on this)

In its current incarnation, no, not that easy to handwrite.

After I\'m finished the bold version, I hope to be able to come up with a
suitable hand-written model.

Remember that typesetting was based upon forms easy to _chisel_, not
write. Cursive forms of type came about after the "chisel"ed versions.

In the far future, how much actual writing by "hand" would there be?
Wouldn\'t computer trascription etc. nullify the need (to a point)?

I designed Bilanidin to be a kinda-computerish based thing. As I\'ve said
before, it was inspired by the Starship Operators Manual, so you\'ll have
to rag on the artist in that book if you don\'t like the forms... ;->

That\'s true, but so is your original point. The handwritten script and a
"typeset" script, that\'s more difficult to write, don\'t have to be the
same. There could be one or multiple scripts. The aslan have a female
and male script, iirc.

I appreciate the comments. I just want to clarify my design assumptions

I thought of this for the vowels, but I decided against it for two
reasons: (1) The doubled vowels are distinct phonemes and therefore
deserve their own glyph, and (2) I wanted to leave diacriticals for tone
marking. It is "canon" that Vilani vowels have different tones, 6 to be
exact, so having a diacritic for "length" of vowel and different one for
"tone" could be confusing.

You mean:                 KH                              
ZH doesn\'t exist in Vilani.

Having a separate glyph for KH and SH is easy to map, too. It can be
done in the same way.

About the "softens" consonants diacritical: Z is a voiced S. S is the
"soft" form of Z. They use the same mouth parts.

Realize that SH and KH are distinct phonemes, they are *not* soft forms
of S and K. It is a quirk of _english_ that we spell them the way we do.
Look in a dictionary, you\'ll find they each have their own symbol in the
International Phonetic alphabet. kh = x and sh =  [thing that looks like
an integration symbol]

Why would an alien want to use an undecipherable writing system? :) My
assumption is that users of a writing system would want punctuation to
"stand" out -- to set apart letterforms -- this is why the Roman
alphabet puts a space after major punctuation.

If the punctuation resembles letterforms too closely, the purpose of the
punctuation is lost.

I\'m sure the odd characters and confusing dots in Bilanidin will keep
most characters in the dark. ;-)

That\'s a good idea, Eppstein, and its what we imagined the "orginal"
Vilani would be similar to. Something like the Korean Hangul alphabet,
where to sounds join to form a single glyph for each syllable.

Pretty difficult to practically use on english computers tho\'. :)

MAYBE sometime I\'ll design a Hangul-like alphabet with the included
keyboard resources for Mac, so it\'s easy to type. (Type "sa" and get one
glyph). I have no frigging idea how to create "dead-keys" on the PC,
though.

I expressly designed Bilanidin as being akin to the japanese katakana
alphabet. It\'s a system used primarily for transcribing Galanglic, and
making it easier for galanglic speakers to read Vilani. I used the
writing in DGP\'s SOM as inspiration. The SOM contained english messages
encoded in the symbols, so if you can read my font, read the messages in
the SOM...

OK bad form to quote oneself perhaps but...

Note that 100 diams for the sun is 0.928 AU or pretty close to earths
orbit. Withe the formula below we\'ll get 0.59 AU which is quite a bit
shorter (just outside of Mercury).
The reason for this is simply the relative densities of the Sun and earth.
So those nongearheded referees can calculate Jr as 100 * diam and divide by
2 for Stars. We gearheads can use the formula below if we like but most
important of all we can fill in our roleplaying sessions with some more
technospeak:

Smuggler/pirate/trader to young naive farmboy:
"Navigating hyperspace aint like dustin crops kid, the tidal forces on the
ship can rip it apart while entering hyperspace this deep in the gravity
well - so shut your mouth or you\'ll find yourself floating home."

The formula for calculating Jumprange (100 diam limit) is:
Jr = 0.007052 * (m^(1/3))
(Jr measured in meters and mass in kilograms)

Actually I couldn\'t really find any mention of the 100 diameters rule in
the T4 rulebook at all. Not that I read it from cover to cover in any form
of deep concentration.

   Actually Hans, The Coast Guard and Navy devote no part of their budget
   to piracy suppression, and yet no piracy exists inside of US waters.
   This is because the Coast Guard and Navy would blow away any pirate
   operating in US waters incidentally.  The naval resources (including
   the Coast Guard) that routinely patrol US waters are looking for enemy
   submarines or aircraft, smugglers, distressed mariners, and Canadian
   fishermen, in that order.  Despite this, piracy does not exist in US
   waters because no pirate believes that the US Navy, Coast Guard, or
   merchant fleet is going to stand idly by whining, `It\'s not in our
   budget, it\'s not cost effective,\' while they prey on shipping, no
   matter how small-fry it may be.
   
   But this buttresses your argument.  Since the 100 diameter region is
   easier for the Empire to patrol than territorial waters are for the US
   to patrol, piracy simply will not exist within 100 diameters of a
   mainworld short of referee fiat.
   
   In the real world, the places where piracy exists are not in US
   waters.  Similarly, in the Imperium, the places where piracy exists
   (excepting as always the referee fiat) are not in the 100 diameter
   limit of a world.
   
   The imperial navy will regularly patrol all mainworlds and gas giants
   to prevent enemy spies, attackers, or subversive forces from using or
   abusing these places ---- this is what the Navy is for.  While they are
   at it, they will incidentally eliminate piracy from these places.
   Piracy will then have to move to places like the belt, where the IN\'s
   response time may be too long to provide an effective deterrent to a
   short-timescale pirating operation.

exports by 0.1 for a E sparport, 0.3 for a class D, 0.5 for a class C and
0.75 for a class B.

The first is items of mass consumption, worth about Cr2000 per cubic meter
(examples : Duff Beer, at Cr3 a 750 ml bottle) up to 2d6% of GWP, 1d6% if a
Poor world.

The second is items of luxury consumption, worth about Cr10 000 per m^3 (an
expensive grav bike, a bottle of Chateau Lafite \'48) up to 1d6% of GWP.

The third is items of hyperluxury, worth Cr 100 000 a m^3 (including
packaging) (a bottle of Chateau Lafite \'47 - the finest achievement of the
Old Republic). A world will spend 1d6% of GWP on hyperluxury items.

The fourth is military goods, worth Cr 250 000 a m^3 (an EW system for an
aerospace fighter). A world has a 1/3 chance of importing military goods,
in which case it will spend 10% of it\'s annual military equipment budget on
them.

The fifth is raw materials, worth (2d6-1) * (1d6) * Cr1 000 a m^3. A world
has a 1/3 chance of importing 2d6% of GWP in raw materials, and a 1/3
chance of importing 1d6% of GWP in raw materials.

The sixth is capital goods and spare parts, worth (2d6)*(1d6)*Cr 10000 a
m^3. A world will spend 1d6% of GWP on capital goods, 2d6% if Industrial or
Non-industrial.

For the moment, we will ignore where these goods are coming from ... values
are all in Imperial Credits, so adjust for local currency values.

Lets assume a world, Terra. C868977-7. 3 billion people, average income
ICr1000 p.a. (Terra\'s currency is low value, which pushes down it\'s per
capita income).

GWP is therefore IMCCr 3 000 000.

3.5% of GWP is Mass Consumption goods at Cr2000 a m3, therefore 52.5
million m3 of Mass Consumption goods, or 1 million m3 a week.

2% of GWP is Luxury Consumption goods at Cr10 000 a m3, therefore 6 million
m3 of Luxury goods, or 125 000 m3 a week.

3% of GWP is Hyper-luxury goods at Cr 100 000 a m3, or 900 000 m3, or about
18 000 t a week.

1% of GWP is military goods at Cr 250 000 a m3, or 120 000 m3, or about
2500 t a week.

2% of GWP is raw materials, at a cost of Cr 20 000 a m3, or 1.5 million
m3s, or about 125 000 m3 a week.

2% of GWP is capital goods, at a cost of Cr200 000 a m3, or 300 000 m3, or
about 6 000 m3 a week.

So Terra is spending 15.5% of GWP on imports, which seems about right.
Total tonnage is about 1.285 million m3 a week, or 100 000 displacement
tons of cargo a week. That is ummm lots of big merchant ships.

OK. Case two. Muller\'s Belt, C200588-B. GWP is ICr9000 per head for 400 000
people, for a GWP of IMCr3600.

My brain is melting, so I\'m just going to divide the numbers for Terra by
1000. Turns into about 100 displacement tons a week, average value per week
of MCr 9. Call it two far traders, each with a cargo worth MCr4.5 ...

Next question is where do these cargos come from. Raw materials and luxury
goods could come from anywhere, capital and military goods presumably from
hi-tech industrial worlds. Note that at a value of KCr100 and up for a
displacement ton, transport costs become less of an issue, and transport
times become more of an issue - remember to charge interest on the value of
the money tied up in owning the cargo.

It should be theoretically possible to build a computer program that takes
in UWPS for a trading area and calculates imports for each world, and then
allocates exports so that imports=exports + cost of transport (or at least
come within a couple of percent). If we are really lucky, we could even
plug in different costs of transport and see how that affects the model
(the long-run trend in the 3I is for transport costs to fall, as your basic
free- and far-traders become far less bleeding edge technology).

Hope this helps and/or makes sense for people.

Well, I would agree that is in the ball park.  However, I would
guess that it would be about as common as bank heists in general.
I think that taking the whole ship would be about as common as
a large bank heist.

Well, there was a very large heist in SF, in which a number of
bystanders were killed in adition to the guards.  It was in
the news for a while and then died out (I don\'t know how
well covered it was in other places).  I would say that
taking a small ship would be equivalent to this and taking
a big ship would be like the great train robbery.

It not a question of "encouraging".  It\'s a question of how
much effort they will go to stamp it out.  If taking the
whole ship is a rare form of piracy, they may just decide
it\'s cheaper to just insure the ship.

Well, perhaps you are in agreement with me but don\'t know it.  What
we have diverted is enough to make bank robbery uncommon enough
that it isn\'t a big deal, so we don\'t divert more resources because
it isn\'t worth the cost to eliminate it completely.  Similary,
simply calculating that is would take only 1% to do something
that would appear to wipe it the type of crime and assuming
that it would happen because 1% is "too small to miss" is
overly simplistic.

I see this as working the other way.  It is more difficult to sell
something in a local area than moving to some unknown market
some distance away (which is why hot items are often transported
to other parts of the world for sale).  The fact the these
products are being shipped is evidence that they are wanted
on different worlds.

>Smugglers *know* what their buyer wants, and try to procure it. A pirate

Yeah, that is why he only gets 50%.  He sells it to someone
who can find a buyer.  The is that all this is true of stolen
goods today and the fact is that people who steal works of
art, information, custom items can find ways to sell them.

Because of the same reason that we don\'t (and believe me, we don\'t
even come close to using the available technology to stop theft).
Because the amount of crime isn\'t worth the cost and bother
of putting specialized trackers on every item and tracking
where it goes.  Especialy since there has never been such
a measure for which a counter measure couldn\'t be found
and so it will only have a partial effect.

Yeah, and this is very easy to circumvent by smugglers and
fencers.

Well, the fact that smuggling is canon does mean that these things
can exist.  In any case, this is different than piracy, and even
much of smuggling, becuase where the goods ended up comes to
the attention of the Imperium along with a new problem needing
to be solved.  In most cases of fencing the good simply
disappear into the market place either by being bought by
someone who doesn\'t care if they are hot, or by someone who
doesn\'t know they are hot.

	Naw.  Seriously.  The Alsan males are really pretty well shut out
of everything but being political props, cannon fodder, and sperm donors.
They are capable of learning, but have a culture that forbids them from
doing so.  And their numbers are biologically limited.

	I say that the Aslan females have really, but really, won the
battle between the sexes, all the while leaving the males completely
oblivious to the fact that they\'re out of the loop.  Pretty smooth, all
told.

Gotta agree with this one pretty firmly.  There\'s very little "canonical"
information about Vilani, so there\'s no excuse not to incorporate it.

Someone, somewhere, has managed it at least once.  The Korean Language Kit
for Mac is pretty easy to use, and I think is technically closest to what
you guys are talking about here.  I think there\'s pretty good PC-platform
han\'gul software, too.  Indic-type alphabets (with vowels as diacritics,
and in many cases compound consonant characters) are also pretty well

Yeah, but why?  If you are worried about military being
ill suited crime suppression that applies to the piracy
to ("sorry sir, we blew up both the pirate and the merchant").
In any case, if the 1% is low enough that you will never miss
it, then it doesn\'t matter if you just take the money
and hire policeman rather than hiring a military
policeman and transfering him.

Which is exactly a reason why the Imperium wouldn\'t use
vessels with military missions to stop piracy.

Well, many of these assumptions are _not_ logical extrapolations.
(Whe don\'t have jump points to try and funnel ships through and
we don\'t use all available technology to track shipments to
stop theft).  Even beyond that people are, in fact, assuming
that things will "logically" extrapolate a certain way.  There
are other ways of logically extrapolating that are just as
legitimate.  (and clearly the best way of extrapolating is
in dispute).

Just to clarify:  the Sayat would probably mount a Universe Flogger or

Seriously, I\'m strongly inclined to adopt your theory as the "real story".

Yeah, but they want to use that 1% to achieve what they have been
tasked to.  The US military would not be happy to be forced to
use 1% of their budget to guard banks.  Neither would they
be happy if, during the cold war, you took 1% of the money
assigned to NATO duties and reallocated them to coast guard
duties.

I\'m sorry, but ...
a) Saying something is "reasonalbe" is not the same thing as
saying (as you _have_ done) that things are a certain way.
b) This is not a point that the person I was replying to
and I had beaten to death and I am not taking an assertion
that I made days, or weeks ago, that has been responded
to several times and simply repeating it as fact.  (and
you do, in fact, do that a lot)  It\'s not that fact that
you don\'t always stick "IMO" or such on what you post.
It\'s that you take things that I have responded to and
simply reassert the original post as if it had never
been contested.  This means you either expect me to
just accept it or respond all over again with the
same arguements (which is a huge waste of time).

>(Now, if I could actually convince him...) It just bugs the hell out of me
>when he baldly states a contested opinion as an uncontested truth.

Well, I would say that you should get out of a glass house
before you throw this particular rock.

>There\'s
>always the chance that some unfortunate neophyte will believe him... ;-)

Well, we all have to accept that other people we listen to
someone you disagree with and agree with him (unless one
plans on trying to refuting every single post you don\'t
agree with, which I think we both agree would be a fanatical
postion).  You may notice that I don\'t reply to your
responses to other people as near as often as you do to mine.

Hans, there are people responding on both sides.  I\'m not
the only one that responds to your posts either.  (In
fact, it is not uncommon that I am not the most frequent
"pro piracy" poster here).  Maybe you might want to look
in you mirror if you want to start looking for people
who are closed minded.
[It is a sad fact that a post will almost always end
up with someone thinking that a long thread where
two sides have been unable to agree means that the
"other side" is being closed minded.]

It\'s not the fact that you still participate in the thread that
is a problem.  It that you simply reassert, in responses directed
specifically at what I wrote, things you know I have already
responded to.  You also do this by bringing up a part of the
piracy isuse that was not what I was responding to (like
your turning the Gas Giant thread back to piracy).

Yes, you have a right to do this.  It is a free country.
I also have a right to call you on the fact that your
are doing it and also point out that the fact that I am
not willing to go into the subject is because we
have beaten it to death.

>>From the amount of other people still posting on the subject it appears that

A bit.  Though much of it is just rehashing...

And what am I supposed to do?  Every single time I want to discuss
this subject with anyone else I have to run through the entire
subject with you all over again?  I just don\'t have that kind
of time.  Of course I point out that we haven\'t been able to agree
with in the past.  And yes Hans, everything we both post _is_
opinion and our diagreements _are_ differences in opinion.

>Well, every so often something new does occur.

And this is not what I\'m complaining about.  If you just
wouldn\'t try and keep raising the same points over and
over we all would save time and bandwidth.

Yes, except it was me that whined about wanting ducted fans for
propulsion. I have some equations about that, which if things are workking
right, I can take to Trav-tech for a discussion.

an old version of the FFS2 beta didn\'t have that bit about limiting CG to
gravity, which led to my \'all CG\' designs that would do 3 G horizontally,
and something like 20 straight up. The thrust would change as
your vector got closer to the vertical because I assumed that the
percentage of thrust you could direct to your vector changed from a few
percent at perpendicular to the gravity vector, to 100% at parallel to the 
gravity vector.

CSC assumes that CG is a completely vectorable force. so you can direct
any percentage you want at any vector...this leads to much more
airframe-ish designs, because as you vector gees to thrust, you\'ll need to
reduce lift. You can either simply over-power the design (say 4 gee
thrusters, with 1 always vectored parallel to gravity to provide lift) or
have a lifting body or winglets that provide some lift as you move faster
through the air.

FFS 2 is for better or worse, different. (sigh)

Of course, it\'ll be different when Rob gets his FFS2 program going so that
we can start cranking out designs by the bucketful with that as well as
CSC ;-)

Glenn has raised a very important point here, for reasons other than those
of piracy.

Consider - you can determine the net importance of a crime, or a factory,
or anything else by looking at the resources invested.  If, on the average,
those resources are better invested elsewhere, then they _will_ be,
eventually.  Likewise, if something affects a substantial number of people,
then they are going to be interested in it, at some remove.

Lets make this a concrete example - a ship with 1000 fusion plus reactors
in the hold lands.  On Sylea, these 70 kw/95 hp generators have a total
value of 1MCr, more or less.  On a planet a few jumps away at TL7, they
might be worth a hundred times as much or more, but the planet has only
perhaps 6 MCr to cough up for this cargo.

Now, how significant is this event?  Will the players who run the ship hear
about it when they return again?  Will they hear about it back on Sylea?
Will the Sylean Trade Protectorate Board hear about it, and investigate
just the players got their hands on a full thousand of them?

Consider that this low tech planet probably has a PCGDP of perhaps .9^5 or
6000 Cr.  As a result, this cargo represents the annual trade of perhaps a
thousand people.  Perhaps a hundred people might get laid off to pay for
it.  Alternatively, the company that gets it might be able to hire a
hundred more due to increased productivity and lower energy costs.

From this, we can see that this is likely a one day wonder on this planet.
The people in question will remember longer, but the average citizen will
not notice for long.  It is about the equivalent of a new small business
doing a public offering, or a tract of homes going up.  Important if you
are near, but not outside that.

On Sylea, the cargo cost them a megacredit, which means an administrative
load of 10% would imply the annual income of at most ten people were paid
by this cargo purchase, and likely less.  I understand the administrative
load of taxes, etc., in the present day is closer to 3%, so while it is
likely that this purchase paid for a reasonable share of longshoremen,
stevedores, cargo masters, customs inspectors, and so on, it likely did not
take more than a day out of their lives.

Now, assume that a loss claim is filed.  The insurance company knows that
fraud applies to roughly one insurance claim in ten today, so they see this
cargo as having an expected fraud loss of 100k.  As a result, if it is
lost, it might get up to ten person years of work tracking down the claim,
but it probably gets closer to one.

By contrast, my totalled car cost them $14K, and so was worth about $1.4K
of effort to prevent a false claim.  The adjuster apparently spent two full
days on the case.  He has 260 work days a year, and probably makes $50k, so
$385 of his time.  This implies that they spent between a third and a
quarter of the expected loss making sure it was a real loss.

Now, on to the ship that carried the cargo.  It is worth 50 MCr.  It has to
be generating a reasonable return on the capital it represents, so assume
that the yearly return is roughly 3%, or 1.5 MCr, so this one cargo
represents the approximate value of the annual profit of the ship owner.
This shows just how interested the average ship owner would be in a single
cargo - if one write off eats their profit for the entire year, they are
not going to be very cavalier about it.  This vessel represents an annual
income stream that would employ 1500 people, so ship liberty ports must be
pretty nice, or perhaps ship ports have lots of costs associated.

Finally, the ship itself represents something like fifty times the value of
its contents.  This is the annual product of 50 thousand people, and is
going to command respect on the same order.  For example, it will be about
as important as several major office buildings, a new mall, a dozen small
companies, or one medium sized company.  Thus, if that small ship is
sitting on the pad, and there is even a small chance of loss, then there is
likely to be a guard on it.  It is a bit hard to steal, so it is not going
to be bristling with guards, but even a 1% chance of loss per year would
employ 500 people to prevent.  I suspect most ports would have at least one
or two guards per ship.  Possibly not out in front of them, but certainly
somewhere out there.

So, the cargo does not make the headlines, but the ship does.  If we drop
the price of the ship substantially, such that the ratio of contents to
container price comes closer to 1:1, then we can make the tramp freighter
less of a news item, but a large vessel coming into port is going to be a
major event.

Is this based on seeing the movie or on the Sci-Fi Channel\'s "The Making
of..." teasers?

As for myself, I plan on temporarily blanking the novel from my mind and
enjoying the special effects. 

On a slightly different topic, I get a little peeved at war movies that have
many of the same klunkers.

Hm.   This gives us a routine quality starport, a planet 3200 km in
diameter, a very thin, tainted atmosphere, with 60% hydrosphere (probably
ice cover given it\'s around a type M star), 800 billion people (yeek),
government type of E (for which there\'s no entry in the T4 manual; it\'s
gotta be ugly), and a Law Level off the map.  Presumably flatulence in
elevators is a capital crime here.  Tech level is 9.

	I could see this as being one enormous habitat that used to be a
planet.  A cold-cored mostly Nickel-Iron body that\'s been hollowed out all
the way down to its core, with the excavated material used to build
upwards.  The place is a police state from hell, with no privacy or civil
rights of any sort.  Living quarters for all but the powerful consist of
coffin apartments.  Think Chung Kuo, only much, much, much worse.

2.  What percent does the imperium use to "subsidize" trade?
Fact with out interstellar trade you have a Long night and thus no empire. 

  The reason i ask is that from my first look at the money involved ot
looked like there was twice the tonnage of merchant ships to military ships
with 5 to ten times the number of ships at the merchant end of the deal.
On further thought it may be that i am several orders of magnitude off.

   The numbers support thosands of ships coming and going from your average
world a day. This does not count the tens of thousands of star ships that
are waiting for cargos or waiting the canical one week between jumps.
With hundreeds of ships being built every day and hundreds disapearing

I\'ve dug it up: send a message to maiser@earth.execnet.com with a body of
"subscribe travlang Your Name"

There\'s also an incredibly preliminary TravLang website up at
<http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Chamber/2662> which should, by dawn PDT,
have drafts of phonology and morphology up and readable.  Assuming I don\'t
pass out first.  I am being oppressed by a pint of patriarchy in the form

You are making an assumption. Namely that large numbers of people had
to do their own writing. 

Consider Mayan, Chinese, and the like. Mayan is especially interesting,
as it is an "alphabetic" language, yet not "easy" to write (except for
numbers). 

Vilani society strikes me as the type that would have had limited
literacy until fairly late. At least as far as writing goes. Reading is
a different matter. And given the way Vilani tend to specialize, they
may have kept the profession of "scribe" up until the invention of the
typewriter. If you wanted something written, you go to a scribe and he
writes it for you.

People wouldn\'t use shopping lists and the like, they\'d just memorize
things easily. This is common in pre-literate cultures. 

I wonder if the scribe "caste" became something like computer
programmers?

Well, if you asked the average woman or man which would they prefer,
to have only one person of the opposite gender for each of the
them, or to have three persons of the opposite gender for each
one of you, what do you think they would say?  :-)

Any speculation as to densities? I\'m *assuming* that they\'ll be fairly
dense as the dynamics of the system would tend to kick gas out of the
system.

Generally, a fence will give about 1/3rd of the selling price (the retail
price) and turn around and sell it for 50-70% of the retail price.  But,
obviously, there are no hard and fast rules for this :)

Probably the best move.  Avoid the \'suck factor\'!  If you have high
expectation for a film and it doesn\'t live up to them then it REALLY
sucks (of course if it does live up to them then you are really
excited!).  On the other hand, if you manage to reduce the level of
expectations to something less, then you will be less disappointed if 
it isn\'t what you expect (much easier to say than do!).  

Saw it this evening and managed to reduce the expectations to the
lowest level (the movie IS NOT the book).  Thus I enjoyed it.  There
was enough of the book left in that I could.  IMHO (of course.)  

>On a slightly different topic, I get a little peeved at war movies that have

Why is it that they have to bunch up? (of course I know the reason, if
they spread out like they teach at every infantry school in the world
- - like they taught me! -  then the characters won\'t fit on the
screen!) Ah well. If we wrote the scripts then we wouldn\'t make enough
money to continue making them!

I suppose I was definitely looking at this through my own cultural filters.
I was thinking of all of those terrible ads I have to re-do because the
copy comes in all-caps (I assume for emphasis, although if *everything* is
capitalized then *nothing* stands out). I was also thinking about it from
my own aesthetic. I am selfish. I want Bilandin to be easy to read (and

I totally agree.  I just saw the movie, and from what I remember of the
book, I thought the movie followed it as much as HollyWood ever allows a
movie to.  Yes, the uniforms were very Nazi, and "Carl" the "PT", his
uniform smacked of the S.S.

I hated to see Dizzie get killed.  I really felt for the characters and
the visual effects were stupendous, so all-in-all I thought it was very
well done.  Certainly not for the faint of heart though.

Went to a preview showing here in Montreal, on Wednesday. Glad I didn\'t

I did actually enjoy chunks of the film. The effects are truly fine - some
of the starship shots in particular. But those of my friends who were fans
of the book were, not surprisingly, ready to hunt down Verhoeven and feed
him to the Bugs.

>On a slightly different topic, I get a little peeved at war movies that have

Roderick\'s posting of his CSC design for an anti-Bug tank is perhaps the
most apt comment. After the film-makers eliminated the power suits from the
story, they didn\'t bother explaining why all these vulnerable grunts were
being dumped onto the planet with insufficient armored support. There *is*
some reference to the Fleet "glassing the planet" prior to the insertion of
troops, and a few brief shots of fighters taking out Bugs, but once the
troops are on the ground, they seem to be entirely on their own.

This is the least of the film\'s problems, however.

In interviews, Verhoeven is claiming that the film\'s overt Naziness is
intended as subversive ironic commentary on the violence of American pop
culture. This defence is just bollocks. Like _Robocop_ and especially
_Total Recall_, _Troopers_ blatantly panders to the violent tendencies it
claims to be subverting. Verhoeven\'s a hypocrite too unsubtle to notice the
obvious flaws in his artistic strategy.

I would have some respect for him if he would just admit he likes to make
gore-filled brainless trash. Because his movies are about as subversive as
NRA billboards.

The tables for missile turrets give missile size (in m^3) and the number of
ready missiles.

The table for missile bays give the number of launchers, and the number of
reloads per launcher.

Then, the text says that I should calculate the number of missiles in ready
storage. This should be the number of turrets times the number of ready
missiles for turrets, or the number of launchers times the number of reloads
per launcher for missile bays.

In parentesis I should have the number of missiles that can be controlled in

Any answer would be helpful, and I would also be happy if you pointed out

Considering that the could land Fort Zinder-neuf, I was really waiting for
the tanks.  Hell, a couple of M-163 Vulcans would have helped out immensely.

>This is the least of the film\'s problems, however.

From my perspective, the biggest problem seems to be that they never
actually spoke to a soldier about the combat sequences.  Several times, I
wanted to stand up and scream "spread out!, Get your interval, and watch
the perimeter!"  These guys were packed so together so tightly, I had to
wonder if Verhoven had broken his wide-angle lens..

Yeah.  One of the people at the sneak was a 14-year-old brother of one of
the managers, he thought the gore was cool.  I find that sad.

Like John Carpenter?  He once was asked what the deeper meaning of "The

thoughts, read Kant.

There were several Starship Trooper rumor sites up during the filming.
One of the articles had to do with the uniforms.  Since they weren\'t 
doing the classic Mobile Infantry Armor, they needed a new look.
It seems that the Hollywood motto is, "If you want snappy uniforms,
look to the Third Reich."

A member of my wife\'s family, a retired member of the U.S. Army Air Corps,
did part of his war-time service in neutral Ireland.  His comments about
the German soliders he saw, "Snappy dressers."

Don\'t you mean: "What hell is this place like?" :-)

Seriously, tech 9 can support orbital habitats, but the cost of these would
be high.  I see:

- - orbital habitats for the elite
- - lots and lots of really big archologies
- - a population living on yeast paste and, once a month, roast guinea pig
- - large areas get \'abandonned\', which means that the police and life support
units no longer go there - massive crime for a while, until everyone dies of
life support failure (now THIS is a place for you angst-filled cyberpunk
types to play!)

The Grumman Goose is a small flying boat, with two radial engines on the
hi mounted wing, with retractable landing gear for land based landings.
This is not quite the real thing...the real one goes a bit faster and
weighs a lot less, but otherwise it\'s close. The cargo space is set to
mirror what the real thing will carry according to the original specs.
This plane is a fair bit heavier than the original, 5.96 tonnes vs 3.44
tonnes actual. 

This design is flyable up (flyable in this case is a marginal term meaning
a top speed > takeoff speed) to about 10 kl of cargo space, so you could
pack a lot into it and still fly, but you\'ll be going slow, and it\'ll be
very hard to take off. 

This is the plane that the Joe Bama character flies in "Where is Joe
Merchant?" by Jimmy Buffet...I think Buffet owns and flies one of these
too.

I\'d like to be that rich...while looking for the real stats on this plane,
I found an ad for one...for a cool $560,000.  (So the price is just about
right , too!)

This is my "Eureka!" aircraft design (or more appropriately, my "DOH!"
design.) I hadn\'t realized that cargo room counted as mass in CSC, at 6
tonnes per dT. and had the \'Cargo space\' control set to \'Leftover\'...I was
getting tiny aircraft with 20 Mw engines, that had a
maximum speed of 27 km/hr, a takeoff speed of 700 km/hr, and a runway
length of 8 km. ;-)  

NOW, I\'ll go off and come up with some more airplanes, now that I know how
to design \'em!

One error that I have encountered in your spead sheet.

When attempting to design an asteroid hull ship. Currently the way your
sheet is set up it ADDS in the initial volume of the design when calculating
the volume used. This gives a negative volume remaining equal to the base
volume of the ship even without anything installed! Had me scratching my
head until I zeroed out everything. This also affects normal hull designs if
you forget to set the asteroid hull size to zero.

Wanted to mention this on the List so that others will know to re-check the
volume figures until a correction can be made.

One other comment. Your SSDS sheet had the seperate error page. I found that
extremely useful for a quick reference while working on the design. Not a
major factor but I just thought I\'d mention it.

Otherwise this is a great tool! Thank you for the effort, and the support!

Spaceports need an easy means of shifting cargo. The Berriette grav skid is a
simple platform with contragrav lifters and an eight-hour storage bank.
Although limited motive power can be obtained from the lifters, most
dockworkers move the skid with old-fashioned muscle power.

A simple range sensor prevents the skid from being raised more than 30 cm
from the ground. Overriding this sensor is a Simple Electronics task.

Apologies for the earlier Berry and Berriette.  In my rush to get them out

None at all. To be honest, no-one has any good feeling where the pulsar
planets came from - there are models arguing about whether rocky or
gaseous planets could survive the initial explosion (inconclusive), whether 
they could form from a debris disk around the pulsar post-explosion 
(inconclusive), whether they were captured during a close pass with another
star (the pulsar in question is a old millisecond pulsar - clearly spun up
by accretion - with no apparent companion, imlying it lost the companion
in an encounter with a third star.) Basically, make the planets anything you
like. I would tend to guess the close ones are rocky and the distant one
(if it exists) is Jovian.

The PC does it in the keyboard driver. You load the support for the

Actually not IMHO. It makes the stars 100-diam range less important but not
much and they\'re still there. The important thing is that it actually gives
you a reason for the 100-diam limit which is important to players wanting
to believe in Traveller instead of playing as if Traveller was just a bunch
of rules. For instance, isn\'t everything in the milky way inside its 100
diam limit and therefore no jumps can take place? Those kind of questions
pop up all the time from my players.

Technological handwaves that doesn\'t complicate things are something very
similar to free lunches so I\'d say we should use them as much as possible.

Look at the grav focussing thing that was put in to solve the impossibility
to focus lightpulses at the described space combat ranges. The focussing
opened up all sorts of problems because the technology could be used for
other purposes as well. If x-ray lasers had been used as handwave instead
none of the secondary effects of the gravfocussing would show up

	Ostie de c=E2lice de tabarac de mautadit que c\'est mauvais [pardon my
=46rench, but profanity was needed and English was not up to the task].

	Everyone associated with this film ought to be shot.  Repeatedly.
With really big guns.  And their corpses hung from that big "HOLLYWOOD"
sign as a warning to the entire US film industry.

	Kenneth, if your movie is an SF flick and you botch it up as badly
as Verhoeven did this, I promise you that I will personally hunt you down
and kill you with my Swiss Army knife.  And I won\'t use the blades.

	Every five minutes, another hole the size of a truck pops up.  Some
of the holes are considerably bigger than trucks.  From a believability
angle this film makes Emmenthal cheese look like superdense.

	The visuals are sometimes gorgeous; the problem is is that they
usually invlve something that is so patently un gros tas de merde puant
that the whole scene is spoiled.

	From a military point of view, the whole ciboire de film is
completely unbelievable.  Butcher Haig, the bastard that planned Dieppe,
and Saddam Hussein look like Sun Tsu compared to the MI high brass.

	From a science-fictional point of view the gotching travesty of a
butchery of an abortion of a film is even worse.  Mention has been made of
coffee cups being affected by an asteroid\'s gravity.  Let me add drop craft
with the aerodynamic profile of bricks to the list.

	From an artistic point of view, human language is completely
insufficient.  Imagine me screaming and raging incoherently at the top of
my lungs while cutting up piglets with a chainsaw and playing bad heavy
metal backwards at 200 decibels to get an idea.  Now think even less
pleasant than that.

	Gah.  Event Horizons is a better movie than this.  Visual effects
aside, Plan 9 from Outer Space is a better film than this.  The best part
of the movie was the trailer for Godzilla.

	The acting was only moderately bad.  Michael Ironside played
Michael Ironside with consummate skill and artistry.  Whatshisname Busey
wasn\'t bad.  The lead male chin was all right, and Gauleiter Doogie Hauser,
S.S. was surprisingly sinister as the =FCbernerd.  Other than that the actin=
g
was only mediocre.


	I tried.  I really tried not to hate this movie.  But I couldn\'t
help but sneer all the way through.  Even going in expecting nothing but
nonstop gunfire and bugs splattering everywhere, even with my brain turned
off, I still couldn\'t help noticing just how bad the film was.  The badness
of this movie just leaps out and shakes you by the lapels until your
fillings fall out.

	And now I think that I\'m going to go scoop my eyeballs out with a
spoon, rinse out the sockets with soap and water, vomit for a while, and go
study.  You have been warned.

	Well, if the other gender is big, dumb, violent, sprays a lot, and
is incapable of fixing things up around the house or doing the monthly
budget, I\'d think twice about having a lot of them around..:).

Well, it is *definitely* a case of "what you are used to". I read
runes, and they are "all caps" (or if you prefer, all lower case). It
really *doesn\'t* make it harder to read.

And for a comparison you may be more familiar with, how hard is it to

Lets see. That\'s a surface area of 8e12 sq. meters. Or about 1000 sq
meters for every person. A bit under 32 meters on a side (or a bit
*over* 100 feet on a side). So even without digging very deep, everyone
has quite a bit of room. Bigger than the lots most houses are on. Now,
it\'s true that a lot of area is needed for life support, access routes,
industry and common areas. But if they dig down a measly *one*
kilometer, this becomes *trivial*. A planet is a *big* place. 

Earth is only crowded on a *local* basis.

I\'d like to have them built up by accretion from the debris. Though
having them *start* as the remains of a rocky planet ands then accrete
will work too. I figure that the surface of such a planet ought to be
*real* interesting from a mineralogical point of view. :-)

  No. However, I assume that anyone who captures a ~60 MCr trader
isn\'t going to hang around. I doubt Mr. Biggs (sp.) really wants
to visit the U.K. anymore, either.

  Either make a straight dash for the border, or stash it in deep
space and sell it to someone who can wait for it to cool off, or
can use it outside of the normal system of merchant operations.
This latter really only applies to organized crime, admittedly.

Hello,
  I guess, but I haven\'t seen a response beyond the "it\'s
just so" level. Why would ships built for wartime escort
functions be unsuited to peacetime anti-piracy patrols?
Why would they be insufficient for peacetime deployment
in this and few other roles, yet numerous enough for wartime
commerce escort, fleet escort, and picket duties, which should
all require _more_ ships before combat losses? What other tasks
do these ships have in peacetime, especially when so many are
designated as having no other task?

Event Horizons had some good potential, however it all came un-glued
towards then end into one big bloodbath.  Not a reasonable comparison to
Starship Troopers, as Troopers had much more plot.

As to "Plan 9", I have seen it and to compare it with any portion of
Troopers is utterly ludicrous.  It is like comparing a plastic fork to a
thermo-nuclear weapon in terms of destructive potential.

I quote once more :

>      I tried.  I really tried not to hate this movie.  But I couldn\'t
> help but sneer all the way through.  Even going in expecting nothing but

You have made it quite obvious that you hated the movie from it\'s
outset; you entered the theatre with you mind made up already, and the
whole excercise of watching it was mainly to fuel your some-what
unreasonable hate of the film.

I cannot address this film from a military point of view, having never
been in any armed forces, but even my un-trained eye was spotting things
and wondering "Why the hell did they do that?".

One example was sending the radio operator up in the hillside ALONE,
when they could already see activity in the rocks.  What were they
thinking?!  Lets see...."Hmm, that radio operator really irks me, lets
get rid of him..."  :)  As has been said here already, the troop
formations were too bunched up, and I agree.  If the Arachnid flyers had
dropped bombs, it would have been all over.

To quote again :

> coffee cups being affected by an asteroid\'s gravity.  Let me add drop craft
> with the aerodynamic profile of bricks to the list

This also amazed me; the drop craft are slow, ungainly and unstreamlined
and should have been picked off with contemptuous ease.

Aside from obvious oversights, poor tactics and suicidal stupidity on
the part of the MI\'s command, this movie IS a good flick.  I personally
was moved by the action and caught up with the characters emotionally,
so when they lost Diz, I was stunned.  I actually liked these characters
and losing one was painful.

I feel the need to defend this movie because of so many others that have
characters, but you don\'t CARE if they die or not.  Or sometimes, you\'re
hoping they WILL hurry up and die so the movie will be over and you can
go home.  There are plenty of movies that fit this niche, and Starship
Troopers isn\'t one of them.  If they make a sequel, I fully plan on
checking it out.

Just my 5 cents worth Rod, no hard feelings and don\'t take this
personally.

Maximum Speed: 52 km/h; 
Range: 2514 km;  Agility: +3DM (0.1G)
Crew & Passengers:
     Crew roster: driver;  1 crew station;  6 roomy passenger seats
Communications:

The Bograt is more of an off-road camper than a true all-terrain vehicle, but
ATV sounds better in the ads. Slow but inexpensive, it can carry six in
relative comfort, although only four meals can be heated at once. Cargo
capacity is 13 kL; plenty of room for supplies, and even enough to carry fuel
for an additional seven days of continuous driving. Unloaded maximum speed is
close to 100 km/h.

	Yup, the visuals were nicely done.  But the ships flying in tight
tight formation through flak just didn\'t make any sense, the asteroid
encounter scene was just so much Hollywood schlock (LIKE THE ROGER YOUNG
DIDN\'T HAVE RADAR CAPABLE OF PICKING IT UP UNTIL IT\'S GRAVITY IS PULLING
COFFEE OUT OF CUPS!!!), the aerodynamically unstable drop ships, and so on
and so on, and so on.  And these guys haven\'t heard of evasive maneuvers?!?
It had a bad case of Event Horizon Syndrome: nice visuals in ther service
of utterly non-believable plot devices.

	The bugs were cute, and well done.  The ring station around the
Moon looked nice, although it curved too tightly (I think).  The shot of
the fusion bugs was real gorgeous (hi point of the film IMHO) but patently
unbelievable; I have a hard time thinking that a plasma bolt capable of
cutting a ship in two wouldn\'t vapourize the bug forming it.  And their ROF
is pretty darn good; what the hell are those bugs eating that allows them
to generate the amount of power needed?

	The thing is is that eye candy aside, the story was just plain
unbelievable; there were so many things that were done wrong...  the
asteroid impact, for one; I don\'t buy blotting out the sun for a few
seconds before impact one bit, unless it was really huge, in which case the
thing would have levelled more than just Buenos Aires.  The brain bugs, for
another; like a completely alien species would have evolved an appendage
for sucking human brains out through a straw to digest the information
contained therein...  The Bugs\' means of interstellar propagation; either
they\'re moving STL, in which case given their position relative to Earth,
they probably would have had to launch those asteroids while Earth was
still condensing out of planetesimals, or they have FTL, in which case
their intelligence is out of doubt, but this would contradict those bits
about spore pods.

	And people outrunning a nuclear fireball IN AN UNDERGROUND
TUNNEL?!?  I\'m sorry, but that scene was pretty much the final straw.  I
don\'t care whether it was a subkiloton nuke or not, but 15 seconds
sprinting (and Carmen was running and shooting pretty well for someone who
ought to have been in shock after getting speared to the floor) will not
get you to a safe distance.  What kind of boneheads does Verhoeven take us
for?

	And then there was the fact that Planet P and Klendathu looked
identical... and a helluva a lot like Arizona.

	Yeah.  I can\'t believe that they didn\'t have APC\'s, close support
aircraft, or, for that matter LAAW\'s.  A single LAAW would seriously ruin a
Tanker Bug\'s whole day (not to mention a swarm of Warrior Bugs).  They
didn\'t have mortars, artillery, or tanks.  The nuke bazookas were cute, but
I have a hard time grokking the tactical role of an assault rifle with an
integral pump shotgun?!?  Militarily, the whole story is even more
ludicrous than it was from an astronomical/scientific point of view.  Aside
from the massed fleets flying in tight formation, which has already been
mentioned, tactically speaking the MI as depicted in the movie are on a par
with the High Commands in WWI who thought trench warfare was pretty neat.
Consider:

	Individual warrior bugs are bigger and far more lethal than
individual humans.  It requires a considerable amount of autofire from
heavy ACRs to take them down.

	Tanker bugs are pretty darn nasty, and small-arms fire doesn\'t
really slow them down.  And they spray this really nasty flammable acid
stuff.

	Bugs are pretty good at tunneling around and emerging at tactically
opportune moments.

	So, against these formidable opponents, what do the MI do?  They
drop a bunch of grunts on the surface, with, nuke bazookas aside, armament
that\'s barely sufficient to deal with the enemy.  They provide body armour
that\'s about as useful as a lacy padded bra from Fredericks of Hollywood.
And they give them no artillery support, minimal air support, no close air
support, no ortillery AFAIK, no armoured vehicles, no nothing.  They just
drop them in there...  No seisometer units that we can see (a few of those
dropped in a perimeter around Fort Zinderneuf and they would have seen that
Tanker Bug coming a mile away).  No bioweapons, no chemical weapons, no
battlefield taxis, no helicopters (or equivalent), not even so much as
antipersonnel mines (a nice minefield around Fort Zinderneuf and that bug
swarm would have been really hurting).

	Makes no sense whatsoever.  A ten-year-old who\'s played TacOps
twice could do better than that.

small to begin with.  Like I said earlier, I came out of it feeling
insulted.  Anyhow, I\'d better stop now; I gotta study.

Whoops!  No, I\'ve apparently forgotten to update that (and I
won\'t be able to do it this weekend, in all probability); maiser
is gone; all lists are housed at mail.

As I said, it\'s really LISTSERV compatible; it should be a
message to listserv@mail.execnet.com with a body of=20

subscribe travlang

and that\'s it.

It\'s entirely possible that the old instructions will still work
(Execnet is usually pretty good about stuff like that), and I
_have_ gotten some new subscriptions recently, but there is NO
guarantee that the old instructions will work, or that they will
even be valid.  Please, use the instructions in this message, NOT
the ones at Freelance Traveller, and as soon as I can, I _will_
update FT - especially seeing that GDW-Beta has also changed.

Hello,
  Risk is a factor, and acceptable at various levels.

  No, attacking enemy shipping when it\'s most needed - during the
initial rush of assault fleets and resupply operations expected
after the first clash of battlefleets. Not having such a capability
frees up enemy escort assets, and reduces friction in enemy planning.

>(anti-anti-logistics?) since anti-logistics will

  That\'s a wartime deployment, and in any event most of the ships
detailed for such missions will be the smaller escort (Gazelles,
etc.) which it now appears are too small to fight enemy traders.

>this is to set up convoys which, by definition, means

  It means that convoys are the most efficient use of those
resources for point defense, as you mentioned on the topic of
fleet concentration. However, random interdiction efforts will
still play a great role in counter-guerre de course operations,
as they have throughout the modern era.

I have heard this claim before, and don\'t understand it. How can a spin
around two axes be converted to a single axis? If it was possible why would
gyrocompasses and armillary spheres bother to have three separate spin axes
instead of one?

Consider two axes perpendicular to each other; an object in this
arrangement could spin with its pole pointing anywhere along a great
circle. How can one possibly do this with a single axis? What about
precession; a precessing object has two angles of rotation and I see no way
it could be reduced to one.

   Any science-fiction movie that has as one of its review comments
"sexy" (granted probably snipped by the people advertising the film from
a much longer piece) has one strike against it in my book already.

   If the film is sufficently bad, a much worse fate will befall those
responsible: they will be ignored.  The Hollywood establishment will
forget that they exist, and eventually they will *beg* to have their
bodies hung from the \'HOLLYWOOD\' sign just so that they can get the
publicity.  Eventually the cruelist fate of all: they will all end up as
"victim number two on an episode of "Tales From the Darkside" or as
"lover number one" in "Red Shoe Diaries".

   Hollywood typically protrays everyone above the rank of major
(colonel in the special forces/commandos, since many sf/commando types
are colonels) as either a Nazi or as a total incompetant or both.  This
puts everyone below the rank of major in the position to be heroic and
save the day despite the mistakes for their superiors.  Hollywood thinks
this is good film making.  Hollywood also dodged the draft during
Vietnam and doesn\'t know a semi-automatic rifle from a machine gun.

had nice visuals after all and made a good bug hunt, though i was vocally
complaining about the various military gaffs along w/ their boot camp parody.
Not having read the novel, i don\'t know if the boot camp thing was in the
book or was set that from the screen play, but it was quite laughable to me.
 
    I\'m in the US Marines (having been a grunt and now a tanker), so i have
some perspective on the military aspects.  Of course, I witnessed the US
Armys Basic Training and AIT for its tankers at FT Knox and that seemed quite
laughable, too, considering what i went through, but this isn\'t the place for
that... : ), with all due respect to any Soldiers on this list.  I\'d call the
MI stuff Army equivalent, but it\'s definately less rigorous and stressful
than what Marines experience.
    Before I ever got onto a rifle range (even the field firing) we were
quite clear on the safety rules.  The problem wouldn\'t have been so much in
removing ones helmet, but on keeping the weapons down range.  A kevlar helmet
wouldn\'t stop a str8 direct shot,  anyways.  But i\'m sidetracking. : )
     I left Event Horizon w/ a much worse taste in my mouth.  This movie
seemed to go a lot quicker than it actually went.  I didn\'t like the
recruiting advertisements and "computer news interface."  Seemed corny to me.
     The MI didn\'t seem to use any sort of combat formations to me.  Just
looked like a mob of guys (and girls... ; )  )  running around.  No
discipline, no semblance of tactical employment.  I don\'t really expect this
from a movie, but it\'s kind of silly to watch.  Kind of reminds me of Space:
Above and Beyond.  
      Their rank structure is pretty amusing too.  Some kind of mixed
enlisted and commissioned structure.  Having one of the few (visible) sgt\'s
being a radio operator was kind of amusing.  Did anyone catch on just what
sized unit Rico was in?  What was it called?  I can\'t seem to remember, but
what was the size?  They had a lieutenant in charge, so i\'m assuming it\'s
platoon equivalent.  A company would rate a Captain, but they\'re structure
was pretty funky.  ("what, your lieutenant is dead?  You, (acting) Sgt, do
you wanna be Commanding Officer.")  And the fact that the Doogie Howser guy
was a Colonel (full bird, i assume) even though he entered at the same time
as the other 2.  That "Fleet" woman making Lt (jg, or full?) isn\'t so
purposterous in wartime.  
    I liked how they killed Diz.  Not just have everyone live happily ever
after.  Seemed very bablon 5 ish and un trekkish.   Still, I did vocally
remark on how it seemed everyone around the 3 main characters seemed to die
and resulted in promotion for them.  Who wants to serve w/ these guys? Lol.  
    All in all I give it a C.  2 stars... whatever.  : )  Decent, but not
laudible.

Well, a bit seriously, most of the Aslan are going to want to
"liase" with a member of the opposite gender.  (I don\'t know
how you would fit an attraction of the majority of the race
to the same gender into the evolution of the species).

OK.  I\'ll repeat it.  [Yes, I know that Hans will disagree

Well, look back at the posts about whether pickets
need to be armed at all.  They just need to jump away
with news.  As to escort, the reason you convoy
ships in wartime is so you don\'t have to keep near as many
ships as it would take to guard them all if they weren\'t
convoyed.

>What other tasks
>do these ships have in peacetime, especially when so many are
>designated as having no other task?

The have to be in place for when the war breaks out.  Pickets
need to be sitting near the border where enemy ships are going
to be found.  Escorts need to be sitting ready so that supplies
can rushed up right away.  Other warships have to be ready to
carry immediate news of the fighting between fleets.  If
you wait weeks to months to collect ships together while
the enemy takes ground, cuts off and eliminates fleets,etc.
you are in real trouble.

Hello,
  Why does pre-trial (even pre-construction?) or long-term revenue
calculations suffer a lag time? Strategic planning effectively
requires a lead time for data gathering. It serves to indicate
probale perps. It does not need to propagate instantly - while
commo speed is relevant, it is not a significant problem for
these types of projections in the canon Traveller universe.

  I\'ll state right out that I see a big advantage of the dis-honest
trader (as potential pirate) being that he can move "through the
people as a fish through water". He can make money normally. He
can\'t be flagged as a highly probable perp. He can survive a search
by the authorities at any time, without being caught on illegal
weapons charges! OC, if you never risk a search, you\'re OK.

....

  The Navy doesn\'t build ships capable of carrying out their
designated missions without flotilla operations? That\'s not very
cost effective for the electronics outfits.

	Well, as far as plot goes, that\'s a value call.  EV was just
another Alien spinoff that went horribly wrong.  ST the book was an excuse
for Heinlien to run a critical thinking test past his fans while writing
some fun prose about a funky new SF concept; powered armour.  ST the movie
was, brace yourself and IMHO, 90210 meets the Aliens.  There\'s a bit of
adolescent-relationship centered plot development at the beginning, and
then Verhoeven starts whacking people.  Seriously, though, I\'d put EV and
ST them movie on a par; nice eye candy with no filling.

	Maybe we expect different things from SF movies.  The best SF movie
IMHO this year was Contact.  Nice eye candy, nice story, and the whole
thing was kept as scientifically accurate as possible, with the exception
of Ellie forgetting about parallax during the Congressional inquiry
hearing.  ST was nice eye candy, but the guts of the film just weren\'t
there.

	IMHO, if we resurrected Ed Wood, and gave him the same budget to do
Plan 9 as Verhoeven had to do ST, I think we\'d have a contender on our
hands.  The eye candy would likely be just as good, and the story about on
a par.

	Well, actually, no. I went in to the film hoping that I\'d be
pleasantly surprised.  I\'d felt equally apprehensive about Interview With
The Vampire when I heard that they\'d cast Cruise, but really enjoyed the
film.  Alas, this was not the case here.

	Yup.  Y\'see, one thing I kind of demand from movies is that they
don\'t strain my credulity.  I like a science fiction movie to be
scientifically credible.  I like military movies to be militarily credible.
This was a military SF movie that was both militarily unbelievable and
scientifically full of crap.

	Yup.  I think they were done that way so that Verhoeven could have
his extras running into prefab huts dressed up as drop ships, and then CGI
them into flight.  Shades of that flying saucer with a corner in Plan 9.

	Well, unfortunatey, having seen the trailer in the theaters, I knew
Diz was going to get it in a suitably gory fashion.  The characters,
insofar as they still occasionally had traces of the Heinlein ones in them,
were not as abysmal as the rest of the movie.  Still, they were a little
too close to the 90210 model for me to really care.  At least Verhoeven
didn\'t give us the cute blond kid who carried a picture of his girlfriend
back home in his wallet...

	Sadly, if they make a sequel, which they probably will because I
think that ST is going to make megabucks, I will probably go see it too.
And I\'ll likely be equally pissed off.  Given, the characters weren\'t bad,
and maybe I\'m being extra harsh because of the movie they were in, but they
still weren\'t Emily Bronte.

	Ditto.  Cool.  Zero offense taken.  Reasonable people can take
entirely different opinions on the quality of a film and still be
reasonable.

In Windblows, the most likely candidate for using a truetype font, there
are system routines, like on a Mac for localization, beyond which
proponent sayeth not, because proponent knoweth not!

Leonard\'s right in that it\'s the keyboard driver, but in Windows, as in
the Mac, direct-to-hardware routines all have warning signs on them:
"Don\'t touch this, you\'ll break it!" 

I suspect you actually need to explore the TrueType programming reference,
as that\'s the abstraction layer where this will be handled.

I\'ve seen fonts on the Mac that require you to press two keys per
character, no matter what language support you use...I have one called
InstantLogo where all the shifted characters automatically move the cursor
back to press another key.

Oh, you\'re going to ask me where I got the InstantLogo font..HA!
Somewhere...probably somewhere from one of the Mac online font archives at
the wustl ftp site (http://archive.wustl.edu biggest honking ftp site in
the world, at last count they had 18 or 20 gig on line, for just about any
platform in existence)

Here\'s what I believe to be reasonable answers, although if anyone knows
better...

1. It is suggested that a "typical" pulsar will have a lifetime of about
10^7 years.

2. All pulsars slow down as they get older.  Since the slowest pulsar
known has a period of approx 3.75 seconds, this is probably a reasonable
guess at the rotation period of a newly quiet ex-pulsar.

3. The surface magnetic field will exceed 10^8 tesla (10^12 gauss) (i.e.
about 10^9 times the Earth\'s surface magnetic field).  This is most likely
to be a dipole field and so can be considered to fall off as 1/r^3,
although the details get very messy.
As an aside, this field strength means that the surface layers will NOT be
ionised unless the temperature exceeds about 10^9 K.

Given that a typical neutron star has a radius of about 10 km, the magnetic
field at a distance of r km will be about 10^12/r^3 tesla.

Timothy -- your email server keeps kicking back my replies to you.  Hope
this reaches you, though I don\'t know why or how it should.

The garbled character in the name of the Sayat NPCs\' ship was a
circumflexed "e" -- supposed to represent the sound in English "bay, neigh,
say" (I think... allowing for probable dialect differences between you and
me). I\'ve since rewritten it as {ei} -- so "Gelektelkeikuttin" works fine,
too.

Yes, I am frankensteining together the Sayat language, Yaskoydray have
mercy upon my soul.  Vilani still will take scheduling precedence, though.
Glad you liked the Sayat!  Hope they come in handy someday.  Thanks also

The only thing remotely appealing was the acid fire weapon of the bugs.
Though myself and the geeks I went with mostly did mst3k comments
throughout the entire thing.

The movie might have been redeemable had they actually done something with
the bug culture other than have them just kill things.

    'body' => 'In my article "From Port to Jumppoint" (JTAS 22), I established detailed
rules for restricting, on the basis of the capability of a starship\'s Jump,
where in the destination system a ship may appear from jumpspace.  In that
same article, I made reference to the fact that the rule-of-thumb 100
diameters from nearby masses for a jump egress (radius-based from the mass)
was just that, a rule-of-thumb.  For some Red Giant stars, it was possible
that the jumppoint was actually inside the surface of the star (ala "The
Mote in God\'s Eye").  I am now providing the details of the procedures to
determine this impact.

First, using Book 6 (or your preferred Traveller reference), determine the
mass of the object in Solar Mass Units.  Take the cube root of this SMU
quantity and multiply by the Jump Determinant 139.2, the result is in
millions of kilometers.

It is that simple!  What may take some more time, is converting to units
of Solar Masses.  For example, Jupiter is listed in the Observer\'s Handbook
(RASC) as being 317.833 TMU (Terran Mass Units), while the Sun (Sol=1 SMU)
is 332,946.0 TMU.  To convert to SMU for Jove, divide 317.833 by 332,946.0.
This mean\'s Jupiter\'s mass is 0.000954608 SMU.  Take the cube root of that
(0.098463453) and multiply by the Jump Determinant (J=139.2) and you find
that the minimum safe jump distance from Jupiter is 13.71 million kilometers
from its center.  This compares well with 14.298 million kilometers by the
"rule-of-thumb."

The Jump Determinant (J) falls off more rapidly for masses similar to that
of Terra\'s, and especially of somewhat higher density.  Recommendation:  use
the rule-of-thumb for terran worlds and/or satellites or terran or gas giant
worlds whose jump points are unconfined (see JTAS 22).  In fact, the Jump-Mass
function has a dual maxima distribution:  best around Gas Giant masses and
main sequence stellar masses.  Optionally:  the referee may use mass-based
Jump Determinants exclusively (more time to make friends and influence
people before skittering off to hyperspace).

Please also note that the rule-of-thumb is usually reliable for stars in the
mass range of Sol and most of the main sequence (V) stars.  That is why the
Jump Determinant J is sometimes called the Solar Determinant.  There are only
a few cases of stars with surface radii which exceed the safe Jump radius.

Two (what should be rare) cases to note are the Black Hole and Neutron Star.
The Neutron Star will be quite far (higher J) from the norm, and the Black
Hole borders on an infinite density with an infinitely small radius.  I leave
this up to the referee to determine effects.

For reference, statistics for a few "known" Gas Giants:

Sz  Name      Diameter(E)   TMU            SMU         J(m)        100D
- ----
GGL Jupiter   142,980 Km  317.833 TMU  0.0009546 SMU  13.71 MKm  14.30 MKm
GGL Saturn    120,540 Km   95.159 TMU  0.0002858 SMU   9.17 MKm  12.05 MKm
GGS Neptune    51,120 Km   14.500 TMU  0.0000435 SMU   4.89 MKm   5.11 MKm
GGS Uranus     49,530 Km   17.204 TMU  0.0000517 SMU   5.18 MKm   4.95 MKm

As may be seen with the above data, lower densities than normal (hence a
larger radius) may be construed as the exceptions to the 100 diameter rule-
of-thumb.  Also, the Jupiter data may be explained with the fact of his
extreme (1/15.4) oblateness.  Also note that the diameters are given for
the 1 Bar atmospheric pressure level.

    'body' => 'Ok..... normally I just keep my mouth shut and read on the list, ( normally
my comments arent welcomed by the technos on this list ) but I feel like I
need to make a point or two here.

Film is a visual medium.  That is all.  The reason this film looked like "
eye candy " is because thats what it was.  ST was a not a military
documentary on tactics, it was not a social comment on Fascism, it was not
a documentary on aerodynamics, and it was NOT a book.

So far everyone here has been going on and on ad nauseum about the lack of
military tactics involved in the film.  I have never been a military man,
but I could spot errors in the film as well.  Do you guys understand why
this was?  Because it was a movie.  ST was not produced to explain military
tactics to the audience.  ST was produced to look good, keep the audience
entertained, and make money.  The very little I know about military tactics
tells me that this film was not going to be about tactics.  As far as I
know, no film ever has been and very likely no film ever will be.  If you
wanna see tactics in action, join the military, read a book, or take a
class.  Dont expect a movie to show it to you because it will not happen. 
Directors are far more interested in keeping their film visually
entertaining than militarily correct.  When the decision is made to either
make the film militarily correct or to keep all the troops in the shot, the
shot will win every time.

The same thing goes for the aerodynamics questions and the social cause
questions.  Folks, this is a movie.  It is nothing more.  The reason the
drop ships looked clunky is probably ( as one person pointed out in jest )
because they needed to do it that way for the film.  Probably had some
boxes for troops to run out of and needed a way to CGI that into the film. 
Thats all, no more.  They dont feel the need to be aerodynamicly correct
for one major reason :  The director liked the way it looked.  

Same goes for the Nazi style uniforms.  They look cool.  Thats it.  Thats
all.  No underlying meaning.  Verhoeven did not want to make a fascist
epic, he wanted uniforms that look cool.  Thats it.  Nothing more.

As for being like the book, this is the closest you will EVER see.  Do you
know why?  Because no directors vision can match the power of your brain
reading a book on film.  It cant happen.  It is impossible.  Your internal
vision of the book will be far better than anyone directing a movie can
produce.  Why?  Becuase your brain produces imagery that appeals to one
person.  Verhoeven had to make a film that appeals to his audience, which
had better be pretty damn big or it\'ll never pay for that CGI budget.

Have you ever seen Henry V or Hamlet as done by Kenneth Branagh.  Branagh
is a genius that Verhoeven could never be worthy to lick the boots of, but
guess what?  None of Branagh\'s films can ever possibly match the power of
reading Shakespeare on your own.  Again, Branagh\'s work is to make
Shakespeare visual, even though the Bard designed his work to be seen.  A
daunting task, but one that will NEVER be accomplished.  The best he can do
is use that story and its elements to create an enjoyable film.

I realize this is a long comment and that I will get flamed mercilessly by
you guys, but I feel like it needs to be said.  Motion Pictures are not
there to be documentaries.  If want that, stay home and watch the Learning
Channel or Discovery.  If you want something just like the book, then stay
home and read the book.  If you want eye candy, go see the movie.  You wont
be disappointed.  If you go into the film expecting more than this, then
you will be hurt and disgusted every time.  EVERY TIME.   You are wasting
your money if you expect to see a book transformed exactly into the film. 
It wont happen and it cant.

I reread ST three times this past week and enjoyed it far better than the
film.  I suggest that you do the same.  It\'ll save you money.  I picked up
a copy of the book to give to a friend at a local used book store and it
cost $0.65, a far cry from the $4.50 I paid for the eye candy.

I enjoyed both the book and the movie, because I went into the film knowing
what to expect.  I was not dissapointed.  In fact, I was pleasantly
surpirsed by some of the accuracy in the film.  As I read your comments
about Event Horizon, Starship Troopers, and Contact, I wonder how you guys
ever enjoy yourselves in a theatre. 

Do you guys enjoy nitpicking the films?  Is that part of the process?  Do
you guys like picking it apart instead of enjoying it as the medium it is? 


The reason Event Horizon looked Gothic was to keep the film looking a
horror movie in space.  The reason the crew went bonkers in full view of
the camera was to show you the crew going bonkers in one shot.  Its the
same reason that lasers in Star Wars are visual light and not x-ray lasers.
 Its the same reason the Enterprise makes that sound as it passes you.  Its
the same reason that X-Wings and TIE fighters look like WWII fighters.  Its
all in the visuals and the film experience.  Thats all.  Nothing more.  

Sorry to rant so much, but I couldnt take it any more.

Diz must die by the end of the film because she is a sexually aggressive
female. The other female lead (the pilot) survives because she is a
properly sexually reticent female. That\'s Hollywood Morality 101.

The first thing we need is an unfriendly government or pocket empire a
subsector or so outside the borders. The second thing we need is a friendly
government or megacorporation inside the border that provides starports,
markets, and is not particularly concerned with the well-being of the
unfriendly power.

While there are no successful pirates, there are successful Protection
Forces of ex-military or retired corporate security ships which have been
hired to secure the safety of shipping outside the border. Sometimes a
guild of free traders contracts with a mercenary company to form an
Independent Protection Force unafiliated with any government or
megacorporation.

Friendly free traders or subsidised merchants are being harassed by agents
of the unfriendly government, and must be protected. This protection takes
the form of enforcing regulations (e.g. a transit tax  which the unfriendly
power does not recognize on ships refuelling at nonaligned gas giants),
confiscating contraband (e.g. a shipment of fusion plants which don\'t have
a waybill signed by a friendly customs agent), escorting merchant shipping
(e.g. informing an unfriendly merchant ship that a friendly merchant has a
contract for delivery of its cargo), suppressing piracy (like the SDBs
around an unfriendly planet which are attacking friendly traders),
defending free trade (e.g. blockading a non-aligned planet to protect it
from the economic uncertainty caused by unfriendly merchant ships
attempting to sell the same products as friendly ships at a lower price),
fulfilling treaty requirements (e.g. arrest of an unfriendly starship
captain who has been convincted in absentia of attacking a protection
force), among other tasks.

A typical protection force would include several large cargo vessels,
enough battleships or cruisers to ensure their safety in unfriendly
territory, and fighters or scout craft to provide pickets and recon. The
force has a contract to provide escort service with the merchants, their
owning corporation or starport, and are paid accordingly. Any contraband
(like the aforementioned fusion plants) or proceeds of crime (like the
starship engaged in anticompetitive practices) are legally turned over for
reward to friendly authorities, or claimed as salvage by the protection
force.

Typically the force will operate outside both friendly and unfriendly
borders, but may stage unscheduled visits to unfriendly planets for piracy
suppression or treaty enforcement. They retreat to friendly territory for
rest, trade, and repair.

Of course the unfriendly government makes hysterical claims of piracy
against the protection forces but this is obviously absurd because, as
everyone knows, pirates are just lone ships attacking targets of
opportunity. The unfriendly government may file criminal charges against
the protection forces, demand their extradition, or threaten retaliation
against friendly business or government interests. However, friendly forces
cannot substantiate the charges, do not believe they would receive a fair
trial, and anyway the force members are all retired and not representatives
of their government or corporation. However, any military action against
the protection forces would be regarded as an attack against friendly
citizens and would be met with appropriate retaliation.

>Obviously some factors need to be taken into consideration.
>
>Motivation - how to motivate the captain and crew to repeatedly raid shipping.

The same things that motivates any employee; a good salary, a pleasant
working environment, a generous pension plan. These would be provided by
the party funding the force. Contraband or salvage recovered during the
contract may be kept as a fringe benefit.

>Security - Up to a point, risk can be dealt with.  Certain death will not be.

A protection force is large and well-armed enough to take on the occasional
SDB or patrol squadron. Though they have some legal power as citizens of
the friendly government, they will have to be careful to avoid large
military patrols. Consider it a high-risk, high-return job opportunity.

>Facilities - the ship will need someplace to go to.  A free port?  A port

>donation?

Unnecessary, except in unfriendly or neutral territory. The friendly
megacorp or government has plenty of starports, businesses, and employees
willing to offer their services. They can legally sell or take possession
of anything they salvage in unfriendly territory and may well be regarded
as heroes.

Hello,
  I managed to figure out what you said here, but the underlying
reasoning is unclear. Presumably you\'re saying that (all else being
equal), a surprise attack by one a trader against an identical or
weaker trader will most likely succeed? Agreed, although it would
help if someone suggested rules for the first minute or two of such
ambush engagements.

  This is actually an important underpinning of my thesis of pirates
of opportunity - in the SFB universe it wouldn\'t really work, as you
couldn\'t close to chew through shields decisively, etc. It does not
follow that a free trader can take any sort of warship, or that if a
600 Dt ship should somehow be acquired for regular pirate operations
without attracting notice that it would be easily capable of taking
on a 400 Dt warship.

  The idea of any reasonably sized trader-pirate taking on a 1000-odd
ton warship of similar or higher techs is ludicrous under High Guard.

  Speaking of ludicrous, we now return you to the movies... :)

I should clarify my wholehearted endorsement of Roderick\'s retching review.
My own complaints were chiefly the cardboard characters barely wheezed
into convincing two-dimensionality, and the plot conceived by dingbats and
actualized by stunned ferrets with attention deficit disorder -- who also
apparently wrote the script, I would guess as an economy measure to permit
greater deployment of irrelevant and unimpressive computer graphics.  The
winning characteristic was the woeful seriousness and self-contentedness of
the whole porridge, which makes it rather more fun to skewer.

Personally, I don\'t believe that movies, more than any other sort of
cultural production, live out their little life cycles in a tidy,
hermetically sealed universe of their own.  In this case, I wish I _could_
believe that.

Whether Verhoeven wanted to or not isn\'t the point, nor is the existence of
underlying meaning the question to ask.  Overlying meaning is going to be
supplied the movie by its viewers -- but now we\'re edging into hermeneutics
again, and that\'s more than I can handle right now.

Actually, I found the fascist flavoring pretty amusing; close, even, to
thought-provoking.  I mean, the thrilling future of humanity is a
totalitarian military oligarchy, and these are the _good guys_.  I felt a
bit guilty about cheering for the alien and not Ripley in _Alien(s, II)_,
but in this one, I felt just great about it.

Verhoeven was in no way _forced_ to make _Starship Troopers_ into a
big-budget special effects vehicle.  It could easily have been a low-budget
art-house flick in French.  No, make that Cantonese.  It probably should
have been.  Jackie Chan should have been in it.  It would have given it
some CLASS.

I agree with you there 100%.  It is possible, however, for a book-based
movie to not really, really suck, which is what, I think, I and others are
finding so... sucky about this one.

_Extra_ butter... on the popcorn.  Hee hee.

Look, I thought the book was really dumb and tedious.  (Talk about
flamebait.)  I went to the movie expecting something worse, something like
a bad knockoff of _Aliens_, and thought the less it resembled the book the
better it might be.  But crap is crap is crap.  This movie doesn\'t even
reach that transcendent level of deadly-serious cheapness that elevates it
into the realm of Badfilm, of Bulldada.  It\'s shoddy and _smug_ about it.

>Do you guys enjoy nitpicking the films?  Is that part of the process?  Do

I enjoy the _medium_ immensely.  Individual movies I enjoy in their own
terms, when I can, and when I can\'t, it pleases me to pull their legs off
one at a time and watch them wriggle.  Then I bat them around a bit, chew
\'em some, and leave them on my favorite human\'s doorstep.

Yes; and it sucks.  And it\'s really not excusable.  I think it\'s a
non-intrinsic problem that science fiction is a film genre that is
currently defined for most purposes by sloppy plotting, flat
characterization, aborted attempts at imagination, and lots of noise and
light.  It\'s simply an outgrowth of the action/adventure film template, one
that\'s dependent upon special effects and futuristic sets and costuming for
its butt-to-seat bonding ability.  How many science fiction films of the
last twenty years can you name that don\'t include at least one explosion,
one brawl, and one more or less reuniformed archetypal Nazi?

Semi-sequitur:  _Gattaca_, I hear, isn\'t bad.

"Full Metal Jacket" featured US Marines moving and operating in a way that
mirrored my own training and experience.  "Cross of Iron, showed the
differences between German and Russian tactics on the Eastern front without
deviating from the primary story of the old vet and the brash young officer
who hungers for glory.

Or "A Bridge to Far".  Excellent film that showed real talent in how the
paratroopers moved and fought.

He could have made a *small* gesture of respect to the original and kept
the almost British sounding dress uniforms..

Fine.  Make a humans vs. ugly Aliens movie.  We\'ve seen it before (Alien
was a pretty direct rip of any number of monster movies.. intentionally
made that way.)  But to tear a great novel apart and change it completely!
Why bother?  I\'m guessing that very few memebers of the "target audience"
have heard of Robert Heinlein, and the movie made bears resembelance to his
novel in only a few names and the most general of plots.

Imagine if we found there was going to be a Traveller movie.  Being the
good TMLers we are, IG flies us to the test showing, where we see hand held
blasters, a sword fight between Strephon and the Black Duke Dulinor (played
by Alan Rickman), small fighters using non-Newtonian movement, etc..

Would you be so quick to say "it only based on Traveller" about that?  I
wouldn\'t, and I\'m always going to be depressed that they destroyed a great
book to make a lousy film.

[snip of bits about film being a visual medium]


	Agreed.  The thing is is that a film that provides visuals that
make absolutely no real-world sense just turn me off.  Films that are
supposed to be military science fiction but that are full of flagrant
scientific and military inaccuracies really annoy me.

	Look; you\'re computer-literate, right?  How would you react to a
film where somebody downloads a 5.6 terabyte database over the net at prime
time via a 9600 baud modem in 5 minutes, and then stores the whole darn
thing on a floppy without so much as zipping it?

	You\'d say that it was complete BS, that the producers, writers, and
directors were completely computer-illiterate, and that that inaccuracy
just blew the whole plot out of the water for you (at least I think you
would, anyhow).

	This is why I got so pissed at ST.  I don\'t care how pretty it
looks, people outrunning nuclear fireballs just doesn\'t cut the mustard.
Is a little verisimiltude too much to ask?

	Agreed.  The thing is is that he could have hired science
consultants to iron out the worst of the inaccuracies, and military
consultants to at least make the military aspect credible.  Instead, he
just went for visuals over content.  The wrapping was awful pretty, but the
content just wasn\'t there.

	Flamed mercilessly?  Naw.  You weren\'t in the movie\'s credits :).
Seriously, though, even given that it\'s a visual medium, is a little
believability too much to ask?  Contact was believable (there were only
three errors that I could spot in it; the lightspeed propagation delays in
the opening sequence, using long focal length refractors to observe a
meteor shower, and Ellie forgetting about parallax at the end), indeed went
to great lengths to be as scientifically accurate as possible, was great
eye candy, AND made lots of money.  Why the hell couldn\'t Verhoeven have
done the same?  Hiring technical consultants would have cost peanuts (even
at 100 grand apiece he could have bought a bunch of them for a measly 1% of
the film\'s budget), and probably made an equally enjoyable and _believable_
film.

	I don\'t care how nice the fonts are and how well laid out the term
paper is, if you tell me that Marie Curie studied at the Sore Buns
Institute and that George Washington was elected because he was good with a
chainsaw, you deserve a big fat "F", and to hell with your self-esteem :).

	If my intelligence isn\'t being insulted, plenty.  And if my
intelligence is insulted, I have a lot of fun slagging the film online
afterwards :).

	Well, I have a hard time turning off my critical faculties.  I just
tend to have problems with science fiction movies that make science errors
so glaring a 4th grader could pick them out.  For the record, I loved
Contact.  It was nice eye candy, thought-provoking, and made a real effort
to be scientifically credible.  What I\'m driving at is that intelligent,
credible science-fiction movies can be made, and they can be enjoyable and
commercially successful, too.  It\'s been done.  Just because it\'s a visual
medium doesn\'t mean that it has to be BS.

	Actually, they aren\'t lasers.  Laser light is coherent, and does
not travel at subsonic speeds.  I think they\'re plasma weapons, personally
:).

>the same reason that X-Wings and TIE fighters look like WWII fighters.  Its

	Tie fighters look like WWII fighters?  Not to me :).  And all this
stuff designed to make some yutz whose education was seriously croggled by
a fundamentalist-run school board relate to the film has the problem of
turning many of us who know how ships passing in vacuum are supposed to
sound right off.

	Basically, I think that failing to even make a token attempt at
verisimilitude in an SF film, when the cost of doing so would be
insignificant relative to the total budget of the film, and it wouldn\'t
detract in any way from the entertainment value of the film and would in
fact improve it, deserves harsh slagging.  And Verhoeven is incredibly
guilty of this sort of negligence.  Aerodynamic dropships would probably
have looked _better_.

	What I am complaining about is that ST could have been a much
better film if Verhoeven had taken minimal efforts to make it look
credible.  Having the MI advance in tactically credible formation would
have looked better than having them mill about in a mob all the time; they
would have looked _meaner_.  Giving them LAAWs, artillery, and landmines
would have made for even _more_ lovely explosions.  Aerodynamic dropships
would have looked sleeker and meaner.  And so forth.  ST is basically IMHO
and YMMV mostly BS wrapped up in some pretty special effects.  In ST,
perfectionism was possible, and instead we got a botched up job.  Thus my
harsh review.


OBTRAV: Tieing all this back in to Traveller, one fo the reasons I like the
game so much is because it makes the extra effort to be as scientifically
and astronomically credible as one can reasonably expect in an RPG.  The
handwaving and bullshittium, although present, is kept to a bare minimum
and there are constant attempts at refining it.  If there wasn\'t this
attempt at making it consistent and believable, it wouldn\'t be a quarter of
the game it is.  Because of it, Trav makes sense.

	Agreed, although I suspect that your average American moviegoer

I have to thank everyone who reviewed it on the list, because I really
would have hated the movie if I had gone in looking for something good. As
it was, I knew what to expect and that made all the difference. It was
funny. It was hilarious, even.

I am so glad they didn\'t have power armor in this film after all. It would
have been terrible to see such a cool idea wasted in a film like ST.

Aside #1: Do you think that the MI has a product called "Nuke-Be-Gone?" I
really enjoyed them nuking big bugs and then, moments later, walking onto
ground zero. I suppose there is going to be a Klendathu-war syndrome now,
with MIs coming down with all types of radiation-sickness illnesses. :-)

I do not subscribe to the belief that because it looks pretty it can
therefore be nonsense. This is what we got with Starship Troopers --
nonsense that looked pretty when it wasn\'t over-the-top gory. The people
were pretty (especially the girl turned captain, I want to bear here
children). The spacecraft were pretty (except for the dropships -- they
could have taken a lesson from Aliens. Now *that* was a kewl dropship). The
uniforms were quite snappy. Indeed, even the Arachnids were properly
pretty: They looked perfect for the part. All these pretty elements,
running around looking pretty, with nothing to do but die gory deaths
because they were as brainless as they were pretty. Amazing.

Aside #2: I suppose there is a grenade shortage on earth. There is nothing
that screams grenade like a closely-packed horde of aliens looking for
blood. Maybe MI grenades can only work if they are swallowed or otherwise
stuffed into the abdomen of a target.

This was an entertaining film for me. Not on it\'s merits as a work of
film-making, because it had few, but because it was just so much fun to
laugh out loud at silly dialog, goofy cliches, and classic Hollywood plot
points that you can see a mile off.

Traveller?

The Imperials would have little problem with the Arachnids or their
physics-defying asteroid bombs. Imperial starships have radar. Also,
Imperial starships are armed, and might just actually use their weapon
systems once they realize they are under fire. Imperials also have neat
things like grav tanks, mines, artillery, real nukes, and, of course, a
professional army. Hell, I bet the Vargr could take \'em.

Note: I am a graphic designer with a degree in psychology. I have no
military training. I lose wargames regularly. I have close to nil in the
understanding of unit tactics. The things the MI did in Starship Troopers
were just plain stupid. The problem is, this is not what made the movie
bad. It was just a bad motion picture overall, with a juvenile script,
mediocre acting, and generally poor directing.

I enjoyed seeing Starship Troopers. I just though the movie was terrible.

Sorry if I didn\'t give enough room for those still prone to see the film
after all of this vile criticism.

Okay, I went to the theater.  I sat down.  I watched trailers.  And then they
started the film.  Pretty standard, eh?  Then...  The newsreel footage kicks
in.  Hysterical.  Brilliant.  Then, Buenos Aires 90210 starts up :)  And it
stays surprisingly close to the book for quite awhile.  And, strangely, I
liked the twisted love triangle (eventually, love rectangle) and found it
very entertaining...

Then he gets to boot camp, and we have Full Metal Jacket Lite, and its funny.
 I liked it for the most part (although the triple-lindey flip during the
"Lazer Tag" battle was a little bit of extra cheese).  But, all in all I
generally liked the characters and the plot.  And, the newsreels were funny.

Now we go to war, and here we have heaping extra helpings of mozerella,
cheddar, monterey jack, etc etc.  Same complaints everyone has :)  "Okay,
here are these beasties thick shells and viscious claws, and we\'ll arm our
boys [and girls] with futuristic M-16s".  No air support, no ground support,
no "naval" support.  What, were the commanding officers on crack???  Every
soldier has an underslung grenade launcher, but its only used in one scene in
the movie...  The planes!!!  The planes flew with their wings almost
touching...  Why???  WHY???  Big bugs shooting plasma out of their heads and
butts???  Sounds like something I came up with in 3rd grade or something.

However, in the midst of all of this retardation, we have...  EXCELLENT, and
I mean EXCELLENT special effects.  Really, truly AMAZING special effects.
 Wonderful looking buggies running about tearing up infantrymen.  The
computer animation was fantabulous, the mechanical special effects (sheared
heads, physical injuries, spurting blood) were all _expertly_ done.  Now,
some people have much against gore, that\'s fine.  I however don\'t (most of my
life I wanted to go into horror special effects, and my idol was Tom
Savini...)  And I don\'t think enjoying the blood and guts and goo and grue is
really all that "sad", so it wasn\'t a big turn-off.

And of course, seeing Doogie Hauser, S.S. was worth the price of admission
alone, and so was Verhoeven\'s twistedly hysterical newsreels (reminded me of
the commercials spritzed throughout "Robocop", which were that movies selling
points).

I came out of the theater with a generally good feeling, and I enjoyed
myself, which is really what its all about, eh?  And all in all, most of the
rest of the theater did from what I can tell (there was actual clapping and
cheering when Rico destroyed the big buggy with his grenade)...

Yeah, and why didn\'t anybody use the grenades they had???

Things that would have made this good movie a great movie:  Powered armor,
remotely realistic tactics, support for our grunts, Rico\'s father surviving
and joining up with the MI, and an ending with Rico _about_ to make the final
jump onto Klendathu, with us never knowing who wins and who loses...

Um...  That\'s all for now.

Probably not in this case, whether its deserved or not.  Sold out amazingly

Cool, my chance to be nitpicky!  The firing of the plasma bolts was

light".

I.e:  The bugs weren\'t firing alot of plasma, and weren\'t able to target the

Not at all.  I find Hollywood butch laughable.  Babes with a \'tude being
passed off as... well, as anything but babes with \'tudes -- oh, and with
personal trainers -- don\'t get my disbelief off the ground, much less
suspended, even less suspended breathlessly.

   Jeez, this is Verhoeven.  subtly is just not his strong point.  In
addition 
to "Total Recall" and "Robocop", this is the guy who made "Basic Instinct",
and
"Showgirls."

   The overt "Naziness" has nothing to do with American pop culture, it\'s just
that uniform designers in 1930\'s Germany had flair!  They were not afraid to
copy what they liked either.  Gestapo uniforms are based on Massachusetts
State
Police Uniforms!  Look at just about any Hollywood SF film made the last 30
years.
The nifty military uniforms all look like reworked SS uniforms.

   BTW, your analogy to "NRA billboards" just doesn\'t fly.  The billboard
monopoly
here in the enlightened People Republic of Massachusetts won\'t sell space
to any
organization that doesn\'t toe the victim disarment line.   You\'re more
likely to
see a Verhoeven film that doesn\'t have lot\'s of gore and/or naked females
in abundance.  :-)

A precession can\'t occur in free fall without a force acting
on the object.  (It occurs only when there is a torque acting
on the axis of rotation).  All spining objects spin
about one axis.

I don\'t agree it would stand out as much.  Much bigger ships
are still regarding as ships only suitable for frontier
operations off the main trade routes.  Clearly merchant
vessels get even bigger.  Even if we assume that independants
are smaller than corporate merchants, there is ample room
for ships considerably bigger than 200-400 tons.

Well, I do think that 1000-1500 tons is in the right range.

You miss the point.  Since the patrol ships can safely
jump away, there is little risk.  Therefore there is
not need for them to even be armed.

But you don\'t prepare to attack enemy shipping right at the
start of a war by spreading your ships evenly  over every world
with trade in every system in the imperium (like you need to
do for antipiracy action).  It\'s done by grouping into raiding
fleets that need to be ready the instant war breaks out.

I\'m sorry, what attacks against enemy shiping in peace

I must say, I went into this film not expecting much.  I felt the
promo\'s looked pretty cheesey.

But, I must also say that the film surprised me on some level.

Yes, it has bad acting.  Yes, there\'s a pseudo-facisist feel to it.
Yes, the dialog is straight from a comic book.  And, yes, there are
Robocop rip-off\'s throughout (if a director can "rip-off" his own work).

I was pretty bored with the first half of the film.

Just when I was wishing I hadn\'t come, I found myself getting involved
in the fight scenes--just for the fun of it.

I normally don\'t like brain-dead action films.  I usually like a little
more gray-matter meat to sink my fangs into.  Films like "Twister", with
their amusement park ride special effects, and "Eraser" with its
dead-head action do nothing for me.

But, in spite of all that, I really found myself getting caught up in
the action sequences.

I can\'t help it.  It was fun!

I really don\'t want to like the film, but I did--just for the bug
fights.

I even felt sorry for the buggies once or twice.  And, I was pulling for
Dez (who was played by the best actor in the film) to get with Rico (the
main character--who was played by a not-so-good actor).

I\'d say go see this movie, but just don\'t expect much out of it.  If you
go in with low expectations and just try to have a good time, you
probably will.

I\'ll give it an average movie rating of 3 out of 5 stars.

The CGI was incredible (which I was worried about because some of the
previews I saw made it look cheesey).  The space ships really looked
good, and the bugs ran a close second.

If you are looking for a wonderful story, this is not the film for you.
This movie has got all of the great acting and charm of the defunct
"Space:  Above and Beyond" TV show (sarcasm).

But, if you are looking for one of the few amusement park movies that
are really fun, then this is it.

PV\'s direction of the action sequences was impeccable, putting the film
a cut above the genre.

It\'s too bad he didn\'t play the rest of the film a little more
straight.  The comic-book feel that worked so well in Robocop just
doesn\'t come across as good in this film.

I would have much perfered to see more seriousness, like in "Aliens",
but I didn\'t get that.

What I got was a movie that was fun to watch one time, but then you
laugh, walk out of the theatre, and forget about it.

Of the other recent movies I put in this class--Independence Day,
Twister, etc.,--I like this one the best.

I even liked it better than a recent film that was played straight,
Event Horizon.

If you are in the mood for it, go see it.  Just keep your expectations
low and have a good time.

Kenneth.

Effectively instantaneous, using X-boat analogs stationed at 1000
diameters (from the local star, presumably).  Total delay per system would
be equal to the time to beam the arriving X-boat\'s data to the one waiting
to leave...in other words, perhaps a few hours, tops.  A message could
travel from Capital to Regina in two or three days.

> However, it will still take a fair amount of time to travel places.

Not really.  You\'d rapidly get fueling stations built beyond the 1000-D
limit, allowing ships to \'skip\' along from system to system over great
distances, with delay only due to refueling/reprovisioning time -- a day,
tops.  Capital to Regina would be perhaps a four-week run for a J3
military vessel.  You\'d only pay the 1000-d \'travel overhead\' for systems
you wanted to stop and visit.  Admittedly, merchant vessels would not
\'skip\' as far as military vessels, but they\'d still use this mode rather
frequently to bypass one or two bad markets, unlike the current situation
where it pays to try to buy/sell *something* along the way.

The Rebellion as we know it would never happen, as the Third Imperium as
we know it would never happen.  For that matter, everything back to and
including the Ziru Siirka would change beyond recognition.  What
repeatedly leads to one form or another of interstellar feaudalism in
"canon" history is precisely the low rate of data propagation; a central
authority *can\'t* react fast enough to changing conditions beyond at most
a few parsecs, so by necessity, great authority is delegated to local
governors of some kind.

In the situation you describe, a central authority becomes much more
likely.  I would envision a federal system (similar to the US, Canada,
Mexico, ex-USSR, etc.) as being the likeliest outcome.  Also, there would
be far more \'backwater\' worlds, places where ships rarely get closer than
1000 stellar diameters. 

It\'s impossible to overstate how important the properties of Jump are in
creating the Traveller canon history.  Change them in any significant way,
and the 3I as we know it disappears.

Well Roderick, it HAS been done before.  One easy example that comes to
mind is "Predator", where Arnie outruns and outlives the nuclear
self-destruct mechanism of the Alien\'s body-armor.

Ok.  I know the PERFECT example of this.  "Hackers".
The graphics and visuals of hacking were so absurd I was
laughing/groaning thru the whole movie.  If you\'ve seen it, I don\'t
think I need to elaborate further.  :)

What\'s the deal with the paralellax?  what does it mean?  As to Hiring
consultants, Verhoeven should have hired a Marine Drill Instructor and
maybe some brass to figure things out and show him how things are done.

Take that example of sending the poor radioman up the ridge to phone
home.  Well, they did send him up, but it was the creek, not the ridge. 
I wouldn\'t have had my troops in such a trap to begin with.  I\'d have
had them walking the ridge.  (if I had to).  I would preferred to have
air craft sortie the overran base first and scan the hell out of it,

foil a surprise attack is to SEE IT COMING.  I\'m sure you military types
could improve vastly on my scenario, but hell, it works better then
Verhaeven\'s ideas.

In which case the standard tactic would have been to DISPERSE the big
ships, since a bunched-up fleet makes it easier for "random & light"
anti-shipping fire to hit something. 

Especially when it wasn\'t light. The plasma bursts also appeared to
grow in size, since a single hit was enough to completely sever one of
the transports completely in half.

Actually, Arnold outran the countdown of the self-destruct charge on
the Predator\'s armor. He hid in a depression outside the actual
explosion radius before it went off, although he probably should have
come down with some fairly serious radiation poisoning.

But outrunning a nuclear blast in a tunnel? No freaking way. Not even
a big rock closing the tunnel right behind them should have helped.

It\'s been done before.  The syndicated television show "Soldier of Fortune,
Inc." has a set of advisors from the magazine of the same name, and they go
to great pains to make things as correct as possible IRT tactics,
equipment, and terminology.  As they pointed out in this month\'s issue,
they can\'t be completely realistic, since this would mean that night
actions would be a black screen with sound effects, but they do as much as
possible to make the show realistic.

Life sucks.  Especially when you\'re a soldier.  The RO had to get a message
out, and needed to get to higher ground, so he went.  Walking a ridgeline
is a Bad Thing, BTW.. you get silhouetted against the sky and become an
easy target.  If you need to get yp a hill, stick to the draws and stay low.

<Grin>  *Every* infantryman would love to have the Air Force pound our
route of approach into fused glass for every patrol.  It ain\'t going to
happen.  Dropping directly into a position that\'s been overrun is an
invitation to diaster; you drop *behind* the enemy, and support the main
counter attack.  Once again, a few support weapons or APCs would have made
a huge difference.

If they had taken the time to use a few simple formations (wedge, bounding
overwatch, travelling), and had run the script past some veterans for
proper flavor words for the leaders and troops to use, I would probably
have enjoyed the film a bit more, because the combat sequences would have
been a bit more chilling.  Mobs of idiots who\'ve happened to be issued guns
get massacred, ask the Soviet Army of 1941.  These guys never managed to
get me to suspend my disbelief and see them as anything more than extras
and actors in costumes.

Don\'t even get me started on the shoddy weapons handling...

The Army needs ten times as many bodies for Combat Arms than the Marines,
plus all the support roles that the Navy takes care of for you.  It\'s
natural that Army Basic Initial Training is going to be a bit easier.  I
assume you went to Knox for your tread-head training?  Try the Airborne
School at Ft. Benning.  There are only 18,500 soldiers on Airborne status
in the entire Army.  That school is strict!

Ummm... I went through OSUT (One Station Unit Training) for the Infantry at
Ft. Benning, Ga.  I found the ST basic scenes to be laughable.  You can\'t
judge what the Infantry does by what happens at the Armor School.

Yes, but the Army sayeth, "weapons shall be kept up and down range, yea
verily, and so mote it be!"  As I mentioned in another post, the weapons
handling in ST had me giggling or in shock for much of the film.

To the non-gunners:  Any decent ground combat school teaches you to ove
with your finger OFF the trigger, but outside the trigger guard where you
can quickly bring it on when needed. This keeps accidental discharges down.
 In ST, *everybody* was *running around* with their weapons ready to rock!
I\'m amazed the bugs had to kill anyone, these losers should have been
offing everyone around them.  No wonder they didn\'t use grenades, they
couldn\'t be trusted!

It reminded me of a take on the post-Trotsky Soviet Army with "Leaders" and
"Fighters", and not much rank.  Originally, the unit was supposed to be a
platoon, but by the time the killing really began, I had ceased to care.

In WWII, specialist like pilots made rank real fast.  In 1945 there was a
Full Colonel who was 24.  He kept the rank in the new USAF Reserve, and
reverted to his original Army rank of Staff Sergeant.  Interesting story,
because while he served as an active duty NCO, he spent one weekend a month
as the commander of an USAF(R) Squadron!

If they had called it *anything* but Starship Troopers, and had just
changed the names, I would have enjoyed it more.

	Agreed.  The Impies would simply crsh the Bugs like so many roaches
under a steamroller.  The Zhos would have a lovely time scrambling their
psionic communication and turning them on one another (or the Impies).  The
Vilani would likely go rooting around in the AAB, find some sort of really
good insecticide dating back to the Ziru Sirka, slightly modify a very
reliable crop duster design, and using standard procedures for dealing with
planetary infestations of ludicrous large and violent insects deal with the
problem as a team effort.

	I agree.  Even the Vargr could take\'em.  Watching the K\'Kree go up
aginst them would be interesting (Bugs are a little too big to traple
underhoof very easily).  The Aslan would likely watch ST for giggles
between rounds of shredding Bugs and then go around sneering at every human
they met.  I dread to think about what the Sayat would do, but it would
likely be very Freudian.  Famille Spofulam?  Walkers.  Big ones.  Fast
ones.  With lots of legs.  With really, really big, wide feet on \'em and
two-foot electrified superdense spikes on the soles.  And 4-meter diameter
magnifying lenses on remote manipulator arms.  The Hivers might have a hard
time as Bugs seem pretty hard to manipulate.

	All in all though, drop the Bugs into the Trav universe and they\'d
rapidly become a big gooey mess on the pavement.  What can I say?  Trav
makes sense!


	And, in passing, for the first time this geological era, I just got

Whoop. Gotta strongly disagree with ya there. Shakespeare was meant to be
performed, not read. Henry V went so far beyond my expectations that it was
breathtaking. Saw that movie five times before it left the big screen. I
try and catch every version of Hamlet I can to see the various directors\'
interpretations of the play. Most don\'t work, a few do. But I can honestly
say I\'ve been fortunate enough to never have seen one that\'s a waste of
time.

For a true Theater of the Mind experience, listen to Branagh\'s Renaissance
company doing Hamlet on audio CD.

Once had a friend who bragged they\'d read all of Shakespeare. "You\'re
missing the point," I thought.

It\'d be like reading Traveller and never playing it. (A weak tie-in, yes,
but I just had to drag the thread back to Traveller).

Movies like this depend on the viewer\'s ability to turn off the rational
part of their brain. Nothing more, nothing less.

If you analyze this movie, its bad. Real bad. The holes completely destroy
any joy you might get from the pretty pictures :)

However, if you are the type of person who can sit back and go "ooooh,
pretty pictures" and NOT analyze, even subconsciously, then you\'ll have a
great time.

I am in the second crowd. I expected this movie to be the level of Robocop
and Total Recall (since it was the same director), so I turned off the
higher functions of my brain, sat down with a huge bucket-o-popcorn (with
double butter) and had a great time.

I agree with every criticism that has been posted about the movie - and if
you are the type of person who cannot ignore this, you will be upset (or
pissed) about the movie. But if you can ignore it - great flick.

This isn\'t a flame about those who didn\'t like it - some people just have
different ways of looking at things. I respect those who didn\'t like it,
and I understand the reasons why. I just think that those of you who are
wavering on seeing the movie need to ask themselves - can I ignore these
flaws. If you can, SEE THE FILM. I had a blast. But if you can\'t ignore
such things, then you\'ll want to slit your wrists at the end :)

Fair enough.

i.e. a target with known (sensed) constant v is always hit.  Agreed.

Can\'t this be reduced for passive sensor observations, which are 
effectively continous?  Or indeed, for a series of active pulses; 
once you\'ve made three, all you\'re doing is updating your previous 
picture with every pulse, so surely the interval should be 2R/c.
(I\'m assuming that active sensors work best with only one pulse "in 
the air" at once.)

Received data is always R/c old.  In addition, a shot will take R/c
to arrive at its target.

Thus I make t = 2R/c for passive/active sensor locks.

I think this needs to be a ship\'s diameter, not a ship\'s radius, 
because a shot aimed at the target\'s bows is still going to hit if 
the ship moves by r.  In other words, FC will always lead a little to 
compensate for the effects of acceleration.  Thus

r = v^1/3 where r is the distance the ship must move to evade.

By my figures, this is sqrt(18) too small and should be roughly 150 
thousand km / 5 hexes.

Doesn\'t this imply that the target ship is moving perpendicular to 
the firing ship?  (ships accelerate along a principal axis, usually).
If not, the perceived movement will be less -- say by a factor of 2 
if the target is approaching at 30 degrees from dead-on, rather than 
crossing the path of the firing ship.  Say 10 hexes.

Given the above corrections, that\'s 3 light-seconds, 30 hexes.

Note that if you fire two lasers together (with a MFD, in TNE/T4 
terms) you *double* your chances of hitting the target.  Thus, three 
lasers fired as a battery will automatically hit an AHL at 9 light 
seconds (90 hexes), VERY long range.

The analysis of sensor data, compensating for the ship\'s own evasive 
maneuvers, etc. might actually take a whole second.

t = p + 2R/c (my equation) -> s = a (p + 2R/c)^2/2 (4b)
s = a (p^2 + 4pR/c +4(R/c)^2)/2 = v^1/3

Put R/c = x, quadratic in x
2ax^2 + 2apx + k = 0, where k = ap^2/2 - v^1/3.  Choose +ve root only 
(R > 0)

x = [-2ap + sqrt(4a^2p^2 - 4a^2p^2 + 8av^1/3)]/4a

x + p/2 = sqrt(v^(1/3)/2a)

R/c (effective) = R/c (range) - p/2 (half of processing time)


Even with this, it seems to me that non-linear acceleration (whether 
by turning the ship or by lateral thrust) is the only practical 
form...

David, please break down for once and admit that piracy suppression IS
canonically one of the tasks of the Imperial Navy. Or do you really want
me to quote all the canonical references about how how hunting pirates is
one of the Imperial Navy\'s routine tasks?

Until now I\'ve thought that your contention was that the other, more
important, tasks of the IN _in addition_ to piracy suppression, most
notably their war-time duties, mandated a force composition that was
insufficient to allow them to perform their piracy suppression duty
properly.

I disagree with you about that, as everybody knows. I believe that the
Imperial Navy will 1) have a considerable number of destroyers and
escorts, and 2) be willing to deploy a small fraction of their cruisers
and even battleships away from their major fleet concentrations in
peacetime. I believe that it is unreasonable to postulate a navy with
as few small ships as you do, and equally unreasonable to believe that the
IN would split up squadrons and then post the individual ships to places
where there are already scores of ships stationed, but at least I can\'t
point to a bald canonical statement that the Imperium have umpteen
thousand destroyers or that individual ships have been posted to
backwater systems (except the _Tigresses_ posted to Andor and Candory,
and they are clearly a special case). But if you claim that piracy
suppression is not a duty of the IN then I can only say that you are
wrong, WRONG, W*R*O*N*G! And if you really need it, I will provide
references to canonical sources to that effect. Do you?

You do realize, don\'t you, that the practice of splitting up naval duties
between a navy and a coast guard is something you do in the US? It is not
a universal arrangement. In many countries coast guard duties _are_ a navy
matter (Denmark for one).

DUH? Saying that something IS reasonable is not the same as saying that
things are a certain way? This is bending the language beyond the breaking
point. The plain fact is that you claimed that it was reasonable after I
had refuted the claim. You do not agree with the refutation, of course, but
that wasn\'t what you were talking about. You were talking about stating
somthing about which there was dispute as an undisputed truth.

This is... how shall I put it? There\'s no polite way to say this: It is not
true. The point that starships cost a lot and that stealing them will cause
a lot of heartache was made weeks, or at least days, ago and so was your
reply that pirates might contend themselves with stealing the cargo and
leave the ship behind. And so was my reply that what was bad for pirates
as a class (stealing the whole ship) was good for pirates as individuals.

>(and you do, in fact, do that a lot)

Maybe I do. I certainly don\'t believe it necessary to repeat my whole
argument every time I respond to one of your repeated "facts" that have
not, IMO, been adequately (or in some cases at all) substantiated by you
and point out that you were wrong the first time and that time has not
changed anything.

>It\'s not that fact that you don\'t always stick "IMO" or such on what you
>post. It\'s that you take things that I have responded to and simply

If (IMO) the arguments you (IMO) used to (IMO) contest the original post
are (IMO) flawed then you have not (IMO) contested them properly.
Excepted, of course, those argument where both sides are roughly
equally reasonable. The problem is that you expect me to consider
arguments that IMO are vastly less reasonable as having the same weight
as arguments that I consider reasonable.  

>This means you either expect me to just accept it or respond all over
>again with the same arguements (which is a huge waste of time).

Expect? Yes, now that I come to think about it, I guess it is fair to say
that that is what I\'ve come to expect. But what I really would _like_ you
to do, however, is to come up with some NEW arguments, some that makes
better sense than the first ones. But I can\'t claim that I expect that.
So perhaps I should stop responding to your posts. The problem here is
that it _really_ bugs the hell out of me when you baldly state a contested
opinion as an uncontested truth.

No, I\'m perfectly aware of the ambiguity of my position. The problem isn\'t
that we have a difference of opinion. I\'ve had that with other people and
agreed to disagree. I\'ve even had my mind changed on occasion. The problem
is that some of your opinions (not all of them, of course) seems so
unreasonable to me. An analogy would be an argument between a Flat Earther
and a Round Earther. To the casual observer they both seem equally stubborn.
Both of them think his opponent is dead wrong. The difference is, one of
them is wrong. Theirs is not just a difference of opinion.

No, of course not, and I\'m sorry if I gave the impression that I was using

that if there are other people posting then it is not just a case of the
two of us going "Is!" "Is not!" "Is too!" at each other. Yes there are
other pro-piracy people, and well met to them. But you will notice that
I also respond to them.

I\'ll keep the possibility in mind.

Yep, and often it is a case of both sides being equally close minded. But
"aften" isn\'t "always" and some times it is a case of only the one side
being close minded.

This is so important that I will repeat what I said before. All responses
are not created equal. If your response is based on unreasonable
assumptions or faulty or self-referential logic, then as far as I\'m
concerned your response does not entitle you to restate your original
assertation as a bald fact.

Well, maybe I shouldn\'t have done that. It\'s some time ago and I can\'t

You certainly are. But I\'d like you to know that I do not consider a
subject resolved just because I am unable to get my opponent to respond
with assumptions and logic that I consider reasonable. If you and I
have run into a deadlock, and everybody else stops posting, then it
would be a good reason to agree that we will both of us let the matter
drop. Sure, I can see the reason in that. But I can\'t see the reason
in letting you repost a faulty opinion without reacting, just because
you have already reposted the same faulty response to previous refutations
several times.

Tell you what. I will begin to think twice before responding to your
postings on this subject and only do it when you actually state an
opinion as a fact. Just bear in mind that "X is reasonable" is only
a true fact if X _is_ reasonable.

>Of course I point out that we haven\'t been able to agree with in the past.

Well, some of it is logic. But yes, most of it is differences in opinion.
So? Not all opinions are reasonable. The opinion that _if_ the Imperial
Navy has very few ships, then they would not be able to patrol everywhere
is reasonable. The opinion that they do, in fact, have so few ships is
less reasonable. The opinion that the Imperium would concentrate every
single cruiser and battleship in a few huge fleets might be reasonable
if one dosen\'t consider the RN of the Napoleonic period an fair analog
of the IN and if one didn\'t have canonical statements to the effect that
the IN do split up their squadrons in peacetime. The opinion that ships
specifically aimed at commerce raiding and disrupting enemy lines of
communication are ineffective is IMO just plain wrong, but it wouldn\'t
shatter my self-image if someone who had tried it out in a TCS campaign
told me differently. The opinion that the IN dosen\'t use task forces
consisting of a number of lesser ships plus one or two cruisers for
raiding is wrong. The opinion that even if the Imperial navy did have a
large number of small ships they would not use them for counter-piracy
operations is not reasonable. And so on. Some of your opinions in this
matter are reasonable, but many are not. At least, that\'s my opinion...

Yes, but I\'m fairly sure Kubrick was attempting for a different style film

bunched up troops getting slaughtered by bugs.  I cant speak to the other
films.  I have never seen Cross of Iron and it has been years since I saw A

I\'d not be upset in the least.  This sounds more like my Traveller game

And I\'d expect one.  However, this is a term paper based on my knowledge,

Well, I should have said move like WWII fighters.   But as I said in my
original post, the ships arent there to simulate reality.  The ships are
there to move the story along.  They are there to look cool.  Thats it. 
Anything else makes the film slow and clunky, which is what Lucas wished to
avoid.  I often recall the interview in which Lucas said " Well of course
ship in space dont make noise, < gets excited > but it looked really cool
didnt it?? ".  Thats exactly my point.

And this is where we differ in running a game as well.  I\'m much more
interested in making my game fun for my players than to make it "

kill a can of peanuts, but break several laws of physics in the process, I
see no harm done.

Besides, this is role-playing not " lets create the ultimate vehicle " isnt
it?   I think playing the characters and enjoying the characters is
paramount.  The vehicle they arrive in is secondary both to the plot and
the enjoyment of the game.  This is where you as a " tech-head " and me as
a " non-tech-head " will always butt heads.  But to me, thats the beauty of
Traveller.  We can all play in the same universe and nobody gets hurt.

Can we agree about terminology? I think I may previously have used the word
"picket" improperly. If a picket is someone who is supposed to slow down
advancing attackers in addition to giving early warning, then I\'ve used it
properly. If a picket is only supposed to spot attackers and fall back before
engaging them, then I\'ve used the word "scout" when I meant "picket".

In any case, I do not think that ships of an early warning system will be
in a position to do anything about pirates whether they are armed or not
(though I do think they will be armed, since that would increase their
general usefulness).

Look, let\'s set aside the question of just how many destroyers and escorts
the Imperial Navy has. Just list a few of the peacetime tasks they would
have that are more important than piracy suppression, assuming for purposes
of argument that piracy is as frequent as the various Traveller adventures
and rules imply.

Just the destroyers and escorts. Not the couriers and scouts and cruisers
and battleships.

Agreed. Assuming you are able to arrive with enough fuel in your tanks to
jump back out again, a ship can aim for a spot in the target system far
from the scene of the action and still close enough to get good sensor
readings of what goes on in the system. The odds against arriving close
to an enemy vessel can be reduced to almost nothing.

The ships that are useful for catching enemy merchants in wartime are
quite up to warding off pirates in peacetime. So unless they have
better things to do that is a most plausible thing for them to do.
Of course, ships used to protect merchants in wartime are naturally
enough even more useful for protecting merchants in peacetime, so both
raiders and escorts will be available. Unless, that is, they have
even better things to do. Can you think of any?

>The best way to deal with this is to set up convoys which, by definition,

>ship.

This would be true if the stardrive of the Traveller universe wasn\'t a
jump drive. But it is. Consequently, it will often be much more efficient
to establish a "convoy" force in each intermediate system and send off
the merchants without escorts. They only need escorts while in real
space, so why wast your escort forces by putting them in jump space
75% or more of the time?

Of course, there will be situations where an escort force is a better
choice, and you won\'t need to garrison every system all the time, so
there MAY not be enough ships to patrol every system in peacetime,
but it certainly isn\'t "by definition". For example, the IN may deem
it necessary to guard against enemy raider squadrons in wartime, which
necessitate using larger squadrons for protection than those needed to
guard against pirates.

And in any case the ships used for escort duty is not the sum total of
small IN ships. There are also whatever ships that make up ther raider
squadrons.

You are not amining for the bow as you do not know in what direction the
acceleration will be (assuming the ship can change its sttitude
significantly in a timelag period. This might not be the case for large
ships but is an assumtion in my calcs). Even if you aimed for the bow and
knew where it was you would increase your propability of miss as any
acceleration less than the anticipated would make you miss directly (draw
it out on paper to see).

You\'re absolutely tright here as Bruce Macintosh and others (Dave Golden?)

well as passives.

The above calcs assumed the worst scenario for the shooter ie perpendicular
acceleration in relation to the shooter and instantaneous attitude change
ie the acceleration vectors direction and length can change at a whim of
the pilot.
(You might note a trend here; whenever I\'m in doubt I\'ll always guess to
reduce hit propability as I find these numbers way to high as they are).

Propabilities doesn\'t work that way! Quick now what is the propability of
rolling at least 1 six if you roll 6D6? Surely not 100%. - You do not
double your hitchance, you halve your risk at missing.

Thanks for your interest. Note that the ranges we get here is about the
same as those Bruce Macintosh got for real world passive sensors on
blackbody-IR-baffled targets which is cool by me; I want sensor ranges to
by about the same as hit propabilities for medium size ships as this makes
space combat resemble submarine warfare more than surface ship fights.

Yes, but bigger ships will require bigger revenues to keep in the black.
And even bigger ships will not have a better computer than the minimum
needed to perform its rated jump.

If deployed singly, yes. If deployed in squadrons, 400 T ships would IMO
be quite adequate.

By patrol ships you are talking about scout forces, right? I still think
they would be armed, but the point is moot, since, as you say, they would
be deployed far out in deep space.

OK, that addresses something I\'ve just asked you in another post. You
believe that designated raider squadrons would be kept together instead
of split up and spread out. Well, that is actually not too unreasonable.
That makes it a matter of weighing priorities. "Is it more important
to keep my ships ready for instant response than to deal with pirates
this year?" I have a different take on the priorities a fleet admiral
would have when faced with an outbreak of piracy, but that IS a genuine
difference of opinion. What I don\'t understand is why you think the
squadron can\'t be kept in backwater systems. Even if they are split between
different worlds they can still jump to a common rendevouz. Delay will be
only the hours imposed by the lightspeed limit to get the order out. And
in any case, you require a full squadron to guard each world anyway.


Damn! Out of time and I haven\'t even finished the messages since friday,
much less dug into my backlog. Sigh!

I\'m kind of confused...isn\'t a "Deadmans tumble" a spin around 3 axis (roll,
pitch, and yaw?)  I also understood that the reason it\'s called Deadmans
tumble is that is was impossible for a ship to dock w/ a vessel tumbling in
all 3 planes...therefore anyone trapped on a tumbling ship was "a Dead man"

Better than flame wars about the TL of the RoM, I guess. <g>

I guess the reason there\'s so much chatter among Trav fans is that it\'s the
first major sci-fi of note since Star Wars was re-released last spring. I
don\'t think Event Horizon made enough of a splash to warrant consideration.

I didn\'t have time to read everyone\'s comments, but it seems that people
either loved or hated it without much leeway in between.

Chalk me up with those who loved it.

I thought Starship Troopers was a thoroughly entertaining movie. Say what
you want about Verhoeven, but I like the way he\'s not afraid to poke fun at
his own movies. The \'censored\' overlays on several of the newsclips were
hilarious. the teen romance angle was tongue-in-cheek and also enjoyable.

As in RoboCop and Total Recall, the movie was filled with the superlative.
From the wildly impossible football game (I thought it was great that Dizzy
was the quarterback) to Rico riding the giant bug alien, there was a comic
bookish feeling that was fun. It wasn\'t like a Bruce Willis or Sylvester
Stallone movie where they\'re trying to pass the stunts off as possible.
Starship Troopers *knows* it\'s impossible and doesn\'t try to pretend that
it is. In short, it\'s wildly fun escapist entertainment.

I think those of you who are hanging onto the word of Robert Heinlein with
every ounce of anal retention you can muster are missing the point. There
were a *lot* of similarities to Heinlein\'s novel, including at least half a
dozen instances in which dialogue was taken from the book verbatim. I think
the film was a fine tribute to the book.

The special effects were fantastic. The bugs made Jurassic Park\'s creatures
look like my son\'s plastic dinosaurs. The starship sequences were also
great. They gave you a great sense of Travelleresque space combat.

For those of you who haven\'t seen it, loosen up your cynicism and fork over
the $7.50 to have a good time. Starship Troopers was a blast.

Well, that\'s because they DO move like WWII fighters, Zeroes and Hellcats,
to be exact. Lucas used footage from the movies "Midway" and "Tora, Tora,
Tora", and real WWII footage to program the model and camera transport for
the Death Star scenes in Star Wars.

I also think this illustrates the point, though. Star Wars didn\'t strike
me as a Bad SF movie despite its technical flaws, because it was so damn
good...me I think I stopped breathing when the Imperial destroyer came on
to the scene, chasing the rebel ship, and didn\'t start again until the
credits started rolling. Judging from the loud \'Whoosh\' in the audience,
neither did anyone else...

All the eye candy in the world can\'t help it if the story is bad, if the
story\'s good, all the bad science can\'t kill it.

OTOH, since he did use real war footage to base his scenes on, the
dogfights in Star Wars were very realistic seeming, even if that wasn\'t
the way real fighters would work in space.

To be fair, if I didn\'t know Starship Troopers (the novel) damn near by
heart, I probably wouldn\'t be as harsh on the movie.

It\'s just that Verhoven seems to have zero facility for putting real
people in his films, every one of \'em is a live action cartoon.

You basically have to stop nit-picking from the very beginning,
otherwise you end up in overload.  Yeah, there were a lot of silly
oversights (Carmen picking herself up the with arm that just got
stabbed by the bug pincer, Carmen hold the big gun and firing it with

The movie magazine (no, I didn\'t buy it but a friend did) had some
interesting tidbits.  After they wrote the movie according to the book
they decided it had too much narrative and not enough interaction and
\'plot\'.  And they (the producers) didn\'t have the Hollywood clout so
they decided they had to get a big name director.  Supposedly Verhoven 
is a big fan of the book (yeah right!).  One of the influences of the
modifications was the assumption that peoples expectations of a war
flick are formed by old WWII movies.  And of course they always 
bunched up in those films too.  (You can\'t fit all the main characters
on the screen if they spread out they way they should - sheesh, didn\'t
you read the script!)

The only critical comment I can muster is that some of the acting

I\'m afraid you are making a common mistake, which is to confuse precession
with nutation.  In free fall with no torque there will be no precession,
which means the angular momentum vector of the object will not change.
However, if the angular momentum vector does not lie along one of the
three inertial axes, there will not be a pure, one-axis spin.  Instead
there will be a motion called nutation, which looks like a wobbling spin.
Many spin-stabilized spacecraft carry nutation dampers to try to achive
a pure minor-axis spin.  Any textbook on dynamics should explain this
phenomenon.  If you want to get into the details, check out
_Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics_ by P.C.Hughes.  It\'s out of print, but
a university library should have it.

Yup, the boot camp was in the book. If I remember correctly (and I\'m
sure I\'ll be corrected if I don\'t), boot camp was relatively fatal.
Something like 3 out of 100 would survive (not graduate, survive).  My
numbers might be off somewhat.

Now, now, be nice.  Not only is Army basic pretty woosy, the officer
training is even woosier (okay, so woosy isn\'t a word!).  [Yes, I can
comment on it, I went through it!] The last word I had was that the
basic trainees only have to get a 150 (of 300) on their PT test (while
180 is passing in line units!).

I remember my first live fire tactical move.  The pucker factor was
high enough there was no way we\'d let a round go unless we KNEW where
it was going!  Of course we didn\'t get paralyzed by lasers when we

Bunk!  I had several Marines in my class when I attended the airborne

Nope. Religious dictatorship is D ... it\'s one more step up the ladder.

I imagine a huge, depressed population having to pay for one-use breath
filters. They have to live in one huge, gigantic city, and most of them
would never only see a pale red, reflected sunlight through the smog.

Yep, this really is THE place for cyberpunk fanatics :-)

As for us me, I think they treated Heinlein about as well as a major motion
picture would.  I was expecting none of the philosophy to make it at all,
and instead, a small amount did.  Verhoeven is not subtle, and could have
used about twenty minutes of gore dropped out and replaced with a bit more
character development, but all things considered, that we got the moral
philosophy class at all was kind of surprising, and pleasing.

On the other hand, the Lt. was a Back stabbing Two Timing Bitch (tm) who
left Our Hero when he was in need of Emotional Support, and thus would be
expected to die for not Putting Out for Our Hero.

Frankly, I expected Diz to die, Johnny and Whazername to be reconciled, and
then her to die.  But then, by that point in the movie, I was expecting
everyone to die, usually by having their legs removed.  Heads seemed okay
by him too.

Imagine the difference in the movie if Verhoeven had been limited to only
three gallons of movie blood and one decapitation or drawing and
quartering.  Like I said before, I thought it was better than I expected,
and worth the matinee price, but could have really used some better editing
and fixup.

The science flaws were legion, unfortunately, as were the military policy
problems, but Doogie Stormtrooper was a good visual, and the CG was well
executed.

The last part of your truism... I\'ve found a contradiction: Total recall
Good story (by late P K Dick) and bad FX, bad set design, bad lighting
(especially the mars underground bars), bad acting etc actually made the
movie a pile of junk and cartoonish cheapness.

Maybe I should clarify a bit here ... I wasn\'t proposing that Aslan females
would be attracted only to other females.  Rather, I was suggesting that the
majority of Aslan females would find a member of either gender attractive
as a sexual partner under the right conditions.  IMHO, Aslan society frowns
on pre-marital relations between a male and a female (for reasons I explained
earlier), and this would encourage unmarried females would tend to have their
\'liasons\' with other unmarried females.

Clearly, some Aslan females (over a third of them) eventually marry and have
children.  Some Aslan females (I\'d estimate at less than a third of them)
never marry.  The rest fall somewhere in between - that\'s a wide spectrum;
given the relative overabundance of females to males, Aslan females can
have a wider range of preference without causing the race to die out.


I\'d like to make a couple more comments about Aslan, particularly in light
of some of the recent postings (particularly those that comment on the Aslan
being a matriarchy, or suggesting that Aslan females \'engineer\' the relative
scarcity of males).

In my games, I assume that the Aslan gender disparity (3:1 in favor of the
females) is genetically determined, and there\'s not much modern Aslan can do
about it except structure their society to live with it.  I\'d also assume
that the evolutionary reason for this has to do with the development of the
modern Aslan from their forest-dwelling, individually-hunting forebearers.
Something about having \'extra\' females around (perhaps that females find it
easier to co-operate with one another) made a group more successful.

I\'d also assume that the Aslan equivalent of DNA has something about it that
makes this ratio easy to establish (or at least easier than it is with most
Terran genetics).  Either a large percentage of males are miscarry, or (more
likely), there\'s a quirk that allows about 3 times as many female
conceptions as male ones.  I\'d also expect to see other creatures native to
the Aslan homeworld that have this quirk, or something similar, too.


I don\'t see the Aslan as a society that\'s a matriarchy or a patriarchy
(IMHO, I see the two \'labels\' for Aslan society as being an example of
human-centric thinking).  An Aslan (male or female) would probably consider
the entire concept of a \'battle of the sexes\' just a little silly.   Instead,
the Aslan are a race were the labor division between males and females is
more sharply drawn and more related to the biology, and both sexes have to
cooperate in order for either to reach their potential.

In the case of the Aslan, my Traveller games assume that there _are_
effective differences in aptitude and capability between the sexes, and that
these differences are (mostly) mirrored in the gender roles assigned by
Aslan society.  In other words, most Aslan males find it difficult to grasp
abstract numerical concepts (as long as there is meat on the table), and most 
females find it hard to get overly concerned about who is a vassal to whom by
which oath (as she\'s getting a regular paycheck).

I\'ve enjoyed the discussions on piracy.  It has been fun to see
differing perspectives and has been quite thought provoking.  Let me
preface this by saying its been about 15 years since I played the game,
and I\'m just getting back into it.

The discussion of stealing ships and likening it to cars today made me
wonder about stripping ships as cars are often stripped.  Perhaps it
wouldn\'t be feasible to do some cutting in space (before the authorities
arrive), but why would pirates not take the cargo (whatever was
valuable), take what they could from the mechanical parts of the ship
(spares could always come in handy), any ransomable victims (space the
rest) and leave the hull to the authorities?

Another point (and maybe I should put in another post as I am not
familiar with the list yet) about the practice of coming to zero
velocity before jumping (and thus being at zero velocity when you
arrive).  It seems to me that with all the former scout and IN pilots
out there in the "retired ranks" that many free traders would not slow
to zero, but would jump at velocity (assuming that the IN does that). 
This would put you at speed when arriving in system (with an increase in
danger) but would be a defence against know pirate actions in a system.  
Thoughts?

And thank you for welcoming me to the list...

Oh, so you were talking about testosterone pumped women _literally_.  My
apologies.  I did read it slightly wrong.  However, was it said in the movie
that they were pumped with testosterone?  (I mainly ask because Diz was

I didn\'t say it was harder, or that Marines couldn\'t pass.  Just that
compared to the Armor School Basic Course, Airborne would be much harder
and more representative of what the Army can do when it has to.  BTW: I
have never met anyone who went through the Jump course without breaking a

So you\'re saying that it would have been a better film if Jodie had

Low-budget, but very well done.  I *think* it\'s out on video, go to your
local SF convention and bug dealers.  The film was my first exposure to the
story, which got me to read the book, which got me into Ursula K. LeGuin

Well, the fact is that evolutionary pressures will lead you
away from having 1/3 to 2/3 of one gender (or 1/4 to 1/2 of
the race) attracted to the same gender.  Yes the race does
not necessarily have to die out, but raising and supporting
a significant fraction of the race who never contribute to
it continuation is the sort of burden that evolution weeds
out.  So I don\'t see Aslan females as being genetically
predisposed to homosexuality.

I\'m not saying you couldn\'t come up with a way to make
this work (though I don\'t see the way at the moment) but
I also don\'t see it as following from what is established
by canon for the Aslan.

You could invoke it as a social convention.  But the
polygamy given in canon works just as well.  I happen
to prefer the polygamy approach, but if you wanted to
drop it I guess I don\'t see any big arguement against
the homosexuality approach.

If it wasn\'t, the background would need some explination of how
all those males die out.

I would say that the simpler explination is just that, with more
females, it is easer to increase numbers (say to bounce back
after a famine, etc.)

I always assumet there were 4 sex chromosomes and you needed

I never argued otherwise.  The Navy also has a military task and
that ships being paid for for defense aren\'t a "free lunch" for
stopping piracy.  Thus the Imperium will look at the cost for
the extra ships (which yes, will be an line item in the Navy
budget) and look at how bad that particular crime is, and
use the same sort of judgements that are applied to fighting
any other kind of crime.

Yes, and the cost of the Coast Guard vessels, and where they
are stationed, is justified on the local need justifying the
cost.  Places that don\'t have much shipping don\'t get vessels
because the Navy "doesn\'t have anything else to do with them".

This is a common misconception, and has had people puzzling over it for a
while.  Two common Terran animals - bees and wolves - also have this
\'problem\' of non-reproducing individuals.  In bees, the vast majority of the
population consists of females, and the vast majority of these females do not
reproduce.  According to conventional wisdom (which you summarize above),
these \'non-contributing\' worker bees are evolutionarily impossible.

In most wolf-packs, only a few of the members reproduce regularly (the
Alphas).  The other members of the pack get few opportunities to reproduce,
and in some cases never do.  How does evolution bring this about?

The answer to both questions is two-fold: first, the non-reproducing
members of the group are usually genetically related to the reproducing
members of the group (this is always the case in bees, and usually the
case for wolves), and the second is that the presence of these
non-reproducing members increases the survival rate of the offspring who
will reproduce.


Considering that one of the driving forces behind Aslan social evolution was
the need to be able to cooperatively hunt large game (this is canon), it
makes a certain amount of sense for the proto-Aslan to evolve in a direction
that enables larger hunting parties (one male plus several females, if we
accept the postulate that highly-territorial proto-Aslan males won\'t
cooperate with each other). 

If all of these females are pregnant or caring for small children at the same
time, they can\'t hunt as effectively.  So it would be helpful if some of
these females didn\'t reproduce as often as the others.  If the females who do
not reproduce are related to either the reproducing female(s) or the male*,
then there is an evolutionary advantage, even for the non-reproducing females
(just as in the case of Terran bees and wolves).

I\'d then suggest that further changes in the female:male ratio, or the
number of females who bear children becomes a handicap, and the proto-Aslan
begin evolving in the direction of \'modern\' Aslan and develop an involved
social structure that allows Aslan males to cooperate.

* Given what we know about current Aslan society from the canon, this is
  reflected in \'modern\' Aslan.  An unmarried male typically has his 
  financial affairs managed by his female relatives.  Unmarried females
  remain a part of the households of married relatives.  Thus, the females
  who do not reproduce help support and nurture genetic relatives who
  do (or will), in family structures similar to that of the proto-Aslan
  I\'ve proposed.


> So I don\'t see Aslan females as being genetically
> predisposed to homosexuality.

If you\'ll read carefully, I never postulated that they were.  I did suggest
that Aslan females would be favorably disposed towards bisexuality. 
There is a difference.

> I also don\'t see it as following from what is established
> by canon for the Aslan.

I\'m speculating based on what\'s known about the Aslan.  I don\'t believe that
anything I\'ve postulated violates the established canon; however there are
certainly many other interpretations which are at least as valid as mine.

> You could invoke it as a social convention.

Works just as well for what?  Remember, we initially started by speculating
about the sex lives of unmarried Aslan females (which the canon material
wisely refuses to speculate on). 

Polygamy doesn\'t impact that question at all, and nothing I\'ve suggested
violates the concept of Aslan polygamy in the canon.  From canon material,
we know that some number of Aslan females never marry, and therefore the
average number of wives for an Aslan male is less than three; I suggest that
it lies somewhere between 1 and 2 (probably around 2 somewhere).

I also suggest that Aslan family groups will be tightly bonded (\'monogamous\'
was the word I used - incorrectly - in my initial post) no matter how many
wives are in the marriage.

> If it wasn\'t, the background would need some explination of how

Well, there _is_ the \'females commit infanticide to support the matriarchy\'
point of view, but that\'s too much for me to take.

I don\'t think this actually works (consider the sex chromosomes the kids
would inheret, and the relative frequencey of males and females amoung their
kids), but something similar might.

This is the latest version of the ubiquitous cargo loader found on board
every  merchant expected to unload cargo in wilderness areas or  visiting
starports which have a waiting list for use of local unloaders or
equipment. Although the industrial lifting arms can technically lift 24
tonnes, this would unbalance the walking loader unless otherwise affected.
The gravitic compensators are mounted so as to reduce the weight of the
cargo (optimised for standard 4 displacement ton cargo containers) as it is
carried, making lifting capacity theoretically unlimited as long as the
cargo is within the area of the field.

 Capacity is effectively limited to about 20 tonnes due to considerations
of momentum and inertia.  In the event that the grav compensators are not
usable, straight lifting capacity is limited to less than 8 tonnes for
cargos not directly over the feet of the loader.  Note that it requires an
experienced operator to effectively use the gravitic operation of this
vehicle.  During operation the effective weight of the cargo is reduced,
not eliminated, so that the loader will behave in a fashion more consistent
with the inertia of the cargo carried (greater weight=3Dgreater surface
friction).

 The arms are mounted to allow them to slide into standard lifting points
on either side of the end of a cargo container, and are shaped to fit
between two containers even when stored at their closest.

=46ootprint is as small as possible while staying within the 3 meter height
of the smallest cargo bays.  When stored, the loader assumes a "crouching"
inactive position which lowers the height to 2.4 meters.  The vehicle as
delivered is painted with a Yellow and Black "Danger" pattern and is
equipped with a rotating warning light on top of the operators cab.
Options include a vacuum package, an array of attachable tools including an
arc welder, and remote operation electronics and sensors.

In a pinch, this vehicle has been known to be used as a last ditch
self-defense weapon.  There is no armor for the operator, however, and,
although the lifting arms are fully articulated, they are not optimised as
weapons.  This use in not recommended by the manufacturer.

I\'ve  run a concept similar to your suggested changes in 
the past and it seemed to work well within the canon of
Traveller. Here are the changes that I\'ve used and the 
adjustments to the Traveller Universe at large that I\'ve used.

1.	Jumps are instantaneous with the following caveats:
	a. The jump is instantaneous in the external universe but
	it is not instantaneous with in the "x" universe of  jumpspace.
	b. Jump duration within the "x" universe is still a perceived
	time of appx a week. With normal costs of existance needed
	to be handled. Food, air, etc. (beer is good, too)
	c. There is a die rolls for jump dislocation of ships computers
	(low prob in most cases but does give the GM some real
	irritation power)
	d. All other time consuming activities such as moving in and
	out of system still take the same amount of time.

2.	Consequences of your propsed changes for the game
	
I think that with out some sort of conterbalance. Either is operational
terms
or in effected terms such as experienced duration or perhaps turn it about
the
other way - Instantaneous jumps for the ship but a specified amount of time
in the extant or normal universe (somewhat like CJ Cherryh universe). 

This may help or it may not.
I like to know what you decide and how it works out.

Sorry, Bruce, but if the movie tried to mimic the book to the letter, you
and maybe 10 other people would see it. That which makes a fine novel does
not necessarily translate into a fine movie.

So what\'s wrong with that? Has it occurred to you that maybe he\'s not
*trying* to put "real" characters in his movies? You view one director\'s
movies for realistic, 3D characters and another for superlative depictions
of heroism and villainy. Each artist has his brand of art. Broaden your
horizons and take each for what it has to offer.

Yeah, you\'re off. It wasn\'t *that* bad. Not even close. It was difficult to

I think something like 150 out of a class of 1100 graduated or something

Or, on the other hand, as at least one person has pointed out recently,
they might not have any drive to "liaise" except for reproductive function.

I tend to look at it, in the most simplistic sense, in terms of Aslan
females holding all the _power_, and the males all the _authority_.  An
Aslan male, IMTU, is the ultimate zoon politikon -- and not much else.

Of course, what isn\'t political? <G>

But, again, they need to grouped into squadrons that can
survive forays into enemy space.  Additionally, they
need to be stationed near the boarder.

I agree that you might designate protected routes through
the Imperium and have protection at beginning and ending
jump points rather than send the ships along.  (Though you
might decide that rather than have 6 fleets along a 6 systems
route, you just have one or two that travel back and forth.
I could see it going either way.  Also, if you group armed
merchants into convoys, their own firepower can be a
significant assistance to the Naval vessels).

I don\'t agree.  The fact that you have convoys, or protected
routes, is so you don\'t have to protect merchants everywhere
all the time.  That is what you need to do for piracy.

Yes, but again, you have the problem that if you disperse these
ships then you have vulnerable shipping for weeks or months
after the start of hostilities while word gets out to them
and they can form up.   I also think that the numbers of
ships that would be need to stop piracy are a lot bigger
than those necessary to protect "convoys" of ships (esp.
if they provide some piracys) but, since I am frankly
a bit burned out on this thread, I won\'t press the point.

There are the arbitrarily defined ship\'s axis that are used
for reference, and then there is the axis of rotation.  A
spinning, nonprecessing object (and you need something to
apply a torque about the spin axis to cause precession),
will spin about one axis.  A "Deadmans tumble" is a spin
about an axis that doesn\'t line up with one of the standard
reference axis (and has "components" along those axes, but
doesn\'t literally spin on them).  The causes the ship
to be a lot more like a spinning irregularly shaped object
and makes it harder (but not impossible) to stop spinning.

As an aside.  This will not keep up.  Eventually a ship
will end up tumbling end over end.

Ah, but they add a third constraint:

3) For any pair of star systems A and B, there is at most one point
   in system A at which it is possible to jump to a similarly unique
   point in B.

This means that to traverse a chain of systems, you have to jump in, then
cross a *lot* (usually) of real space to reach the jump point to the next
system.  This slows travel back down to Travellerish values, while still
keeping communication fast (though not quite as fast as in my previous
post, nearly so).

This model of jump leads to the possibility of naval blockades, which are
all but impossible in Traveller except in very special cases.  This has
far-reaching effects on how navies and governments would be organized.

Well, bees are a lot different.  Each member of the hive is related
to the queen.  For this to apply to the Aslan it would have to
be a situation where every had a family that had a dominate
(presumably the first born) who was the only one who would
reproduce.  Her sisters would exist to serve her and make sure
she has numerous and healthy offspring.  You could adapt this
to the Aslan society where, unlike bees, the males control
territory (when a female married she would bring along her
sisters).  However, I see this as being a bit different than
canon.

You could have a sitation where a pregnant Aslan releases
hormones that that _temporarily_ stops her sisters from
getting pregnant, however, I don\'t see this as needing
to affect their sex drive.

>In most wolf-packs, only a few of the members reproduce regularly (the

>and in some cases never do.

First of all, it is not always the _same_ alpha males.  In many
cases you can only hold the position for a period of time before
a new alpha male comes along or the rigors of holding off the
others just get to you.  In any case, the fact is that there is
a competition is key here.  The other wolves aren\'t just
accepting the situation and going off with other males.  They
retain their attraction for females and competer for them
undergoing to process that weeds out weaker genes in favor
of stronger ones, and so has evolutionary value rather than
just being a burden on the gene pool.

It is also hard to turn this around.  It is in the females
interest to exclude some males from mating.  The females
can\'t bear children with more than one male at a time anwyway
and they all have an interest in mating with the top male.
However, if there are females not mating, it is in the interest
of both the females who don\'t have mates, and the males who
do, to mate.

Also, with the wolves you are not lessing the reproductive
potential of the pact as a whole when you have one male
mate with all the women.  This is not true when you have
females refrain from mating.

Of course you can have a simple method to stagger births (horomones
from a pregnant female temporarily inhibit fertility in her
pack mates).  However, this probably isn\'t necessary because
lions don\'t have a problem with this.  What usually happens
is that births are times to coincide with times when game
is plentiful and even pregnent females can hunt until just
before birth.

I guess I don\'t understand.  If you have multiple marriages, so
all women can get married, why don\'t they all just sleep with their
husbands.

I would be OK if it was woven into the over all vision of the race.
But it has too many potential consequences and issues to be just

Well, I didn\'t work through the probabilities.  Suppose you have an
X/Y chromosome and and A/B one.  The male always gives Y and B.
The mother can give either X/Y and either A/B.  But you need to be
Both YY and BB to be male.  Doesn\'t that give a 3:1 ratio?

This message reveals two medium-small details from scenes in the

I was most impressed with ships in the film. I especially liked the
decks\' being visible in detail when a certain ship was split in half.

(ObTrav) The one character\'s being killed by a descending emergency
bulkhead door was a particularly good detail, if perhaps a bit
overstated. ;) I picture the bulkhead irises on Traveller ships being
this dangerous during various emergencies.

So anyway, I\'m wondering what the huge rotating column in the film
might be for. We saw it frequently on the bridge, and the very large
structure visible outside the ship rotated at the same speed, so I
presume they are the same device. Part of the stardrive, perhaps?

BTW, I also really liked the bridge POV effect when the ship entered
stardrive.

That\'s OK (and why I was careful to label what was my opinion and what was
fact from the accepted canon).  IMHO, history doesn\'t always follow the most
likely outcome, but does so more often than not (this is the "Vikings in
Constantinople" theory of unlikely-sounding-but-true history).

>First of all, it is not always the _same_ alpha males.

We were talking about females.  Depending on the food supply (and particularly
in marginal areas), the lower-ranking females may not bear a litter.  The
alpha female tries to discourage the lower-ranking females from mating, and
may attempt to induce miscarriage and/or kill the puppies.

Yep, you could.  I chose not to do that, in part because it\'s been done
a lot in SF (and in real life - did you know that human females tend to
synchronize their periods if they live in close proximity with one another?).

>I guess I don\'t understand.  If you have multiple marriages, so all women

Because we were talking about unmarried females?  
By definition, unmarried females don\'t have husbands yet.
According to canon, some females never marry.

That works fine for the first generation,  BUT you have (on the
average), 1 YYBB male, and one each of YXAB, YXBB, and YYBA females.

These females then mate with YYBB males, and throw:
YXAB+YYBB -> 1 YYBB male, and 1 each YXAB, YXBB, YYBA females;
YXBB+YYBB -> 2 YYBB males, and 2 YXBB females; and
YYBA+YYBB -> 2 YYBB males, and 2 YYBA females.

I\'m not really up on genetics and biochemistry, but perhaps we could invoke
something along these lines: Aslan genes require an "activator"; gene-like
material that "activates" certain genes (making them dominant); genes which
do not recieve an activator are effectively recessive.  Each parent
contributes
approximately half of the genetic material; each parent contributes a specific
set of genes and a set of activators that work on the genes contributed by
the 
other parent.  In the case of sex, one parent contributes four genes that 
determine sex: M1, F1, F2, and F3.  The other parent supplies ONE activator 
which activates one of these four.  The activator binds to a gene essentially
at random, and determines the sex of the child.  The child (no matter which
sex), carries a complete set of genetic material.

My question is, what do you think Aslan pens _look_ like (or not pens, but

I can get an idea of the look for their language.  I\'ve seen flowery Aslan

interesting ideas...

I\'m thinking two possibilities for the male script.  Made up mainly of
straight horizontal lines.  UNLESS, there is the possibility that the males
are much more "artistic" in general design, at which point it would be more
flowery, flowing, and ornate.

I think in either case I\'m going to make the female script to be more
business-like and traditional.

By then it\'s far too late.  Better she gets in a fistfight with a recycled

of the film, while the title rolls.  I\'m sure it\'s what St. Carl would have

LeGuin.  This started ringing bells.  I went and got a copy of _The Left

Harvey Keitel would be good, I think.  I somehow picture Clint Eastwood as
Norris, and Sharon Stone as Seldrian.  Bruce Willis as Norris\'s "personal
aide".  But we still need to get Gene Hackman and the Spice Girls in there
somehow, and also Woody Allen (Lt. Windhook, maybe).  And what about
Archduke Bzrk?

No, No, thats not what it means.  In the 1970\'s New York City was having
a lot of problems negociating with its employees unions.  The city\'s
relationship with the Transit Workers Union was especially difficult. 
The transit department ended up going on strike on a Thursday.  The
whole city was half paralyzed by the lack of subways and buses on
Thursday and Friday.  So the city and the union engaged in a nonstop
negociating session all weekend long trying to solve their differences. 
Finally they came to an agreement at about 1 am on Monday morning, the
strike was called off, the transit workers were happy, and everyone else
could get to work.

Naturally the headline in one of the local papers was Sick Transit\'s
Glorious Monday !

It seems to be a good career choice. It pays well, there are all sorts of 
perks and you can set your own hours. However, every Evil Overlord I\'ve 
heard about invariably gets overthrown and destroyed in the end.  I\'ve 
noticed that no matter whether they are barbarian lords, deranged wizards, 
mad scientists or alien invaders, they always seem to make the same basic 
mistakes every single time. With that in mind, allow me to present...


Things I\'d Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord...

My Legions of Terror will have helmets with clear Plexiglas visors, not 
face-concealing ones that can hide the enemy.

My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.

My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not kept 
imprisoned in a forgotten cell of my dungeon.

Shooting is not too good for my enemies and should be done ASAP.

The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on the 
Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragons of 
Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box. The same applies to the object 
which is my one weakness.

I will not gloat over my enemies\' predicament before killing them.

When I\'ve captured my adversary and he says, "Look, before you kill me, 
will you at least tell me what this is all about?" I\'ll say "No" and shoot 
him. No, on second thought I\'ll shoot him then say "No.

After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married immediately in a 
quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in three weeks\' time during 
which the final phase of my master plan will be carried out.

I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. 
If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labeled ``Danger: Do 
Not Push\'\'. The big red button marked ``Do Not Push\'\' will instead trigger 
a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the 
ON/OFF switch will not clearly be labeled as such.

I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a small hotel 
well outside my borders will work just as well.

I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove 
it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies 
alive to show they pose no threat.

One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my 
plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.

All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least have several rounds of 
ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. 
The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, 
will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.

The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any other 
form of last request.

I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I find that 
such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to activate when the 
counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation.

I will never utter the sentence "But before I kill you, there\'s just one 
thing I want to know."

When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their 
advice.

I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned attempt to 
usurp power would easily fail, it would provide a fatal distraction at a 
crucial point in time.

I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was evil, but 
one look at the hero\'s rugged countenance and she\'d betray her own father.

Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in maniacal 
laughter. When so occupied, it\'s too easy to miss unexpected developments 
that a more attentive individual could adjust to accordingly.

I will hire a talented fashion designer to create original uniforms for my 
Legions of Terror, as opposed to some cheap knock-offs that make them look 
like Nazi storm troopers, Roman foot soldiers, or savage Mongol hordes. All 
were eventually defeated and I want my troops to have a more positive 
mind-set.

No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power, I will not 
consume any energy field bigger than my head.

I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my troops in 
their use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to neutralize my power 
generator and/or render the standard-issue energy weapons useless --my 
troops will not be overrun by a handful of savages armed with spears and 
rocks.

I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. 
 Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job, at least I will 
never utter the line "No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!" (After that, 
death is usually instantaneous.)

No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any sort of 
machinery which is  completely indestructible except for one small and 
virtually inaccessible vulnerable spot.

No matter how attractive certain members of the rebellion are, there is 
probably someone just as attractive who is not desperate to kill me.

Therefore, I will think twice before ordering a prisoner sent to my bed 
chamber.

I will never build only one of anything important. All important systems 
will have redundant control panels and power supplies. For the same reason 
I will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at all times.

My pet monster will be kept in a secure cage from which it cannot escape 
and into which I could not accidentally stumble.

I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies into 
confusion.

All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly 
thieves in the land will be pre-emptively put to death. My foes will surely 
give up and abandon their quest if they  have no source of comic relief.

All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with surly, 
world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected reinforcement and/or 
romantic subplot for the hero or his sidekick.

I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad news just 
to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are hard to come by.

I won\'t require high-ranking female members of my organization to wear a 
stainless-steel bustier. Morale is better with a more casual dress-code. 
Similarly, outfits made entirely from black leather will be reserved for 
formal occasions.

I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.

I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look diabolic. Now 
they just make you look like a disaffected member of Generation X.

I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell block, let 
alone the same cell. If they are important prisoners, I will keep the only 
key to the cell door on my person instead of handing out copies to every 
bottom-rung guard in the prison.

If my trusted lieutenant tells me my Legions of Terror are losing a battle, 
I will believe him. After all, he\'s my trusted lieutenant.

If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring anywhere, 
I will find them and have them killed immediately, instead of waiting for 
them to grow up harboring feelings of vengeance towards me in my old age.

If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at the 
forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out the attacking leader 
among his army.

I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an unstoppable 
superweapon, I will use it as early and as often as possible instead of 
keeping it in reserve.

Once my power is secure, I will destroy all those pesky time-travel 
devices.

When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog, monkey, 
ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of untying ropes 
and filching keys happens to follow him around.

I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the beautiful 
rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and good looks and will 
gladly betray her companions if I just let her in on my plans.

I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. Those who work for 
the pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like even the odds to give 
the other guy a sporting chance.

I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is responsible for 
what in my organization. For example, if my general screws up I will not 
draw my weapon, point it at him, say "And here is the price for failure,\'\' 
then suddenly turn and kill some random underling.

If an advisor says to me "My liege, he is but one man. What can one man 
possibly do?\'\', I will reply "This.\'\' and kill the advisor.

If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me, I will slay 
him while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting for him to mature.

I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology with 
respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken, it will not 
immediately come after me for revenge.

If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy me, I will 
not send all my troops out to seize it.  Instead I will send them out to 
seize something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in the local paper.

My main computers will have their own special operating system that will be 
completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh powerbooks.

If one of my dungeon guards begins expressing concern over the conditions 
in the beautiful princess\' cell, I will immediately transfer him to a less 
people-oriented position.

I will hire a team of board-certified architects and surveyors to examine 
my castle and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned tunnels that I 
might not know about.

If the beautiful princess that I capture says "I\'ll never marry you! 
 Never, do you hear me, NEVER!!!", I will say "Oh well," and kill her.

I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to 
double-cross it simply because I feel like being contrary.

The deformed mutants and odd-ball psychotics will have their place in my 
Legions of Terror. However before I send them out on important covert 
missions that require tact and subtlety, I will first see if there is 
anyone else equally qualified who would attract less attention.

My Legions of Terror will be trained in basic marksmanship. Any who cannot 
learn to hit a man-sized target at 10 meters will be used for target 
practice.

Before employing any captured artifacts or machinery, I will carefully read 
the owner\'s manual.

If it becomes necessary to escape, I will never stop to pose dramatically 
and toss off a one-liner.

I will never build a sentient computer smarter than I am.

My five-year-old child advisor will also be asked to decipher any code I am 
thinking of using. If he breaks the code in under 30 seconds, it will not 
be used. Note: this also applies to passwords.

If my advisors ask "Why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme?", 
I will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies them.

I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding structural 
supports which intruders could use for cover in a firefight.

Bulk trash will be disposed of in incinerators, not compactors. And they 
will be kept hot, with none of that nonsense about flames going through 
accessible tunnels at predictable intervals  -- The flames will be 
constant!

I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all extremely unusual 
phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could prove to be a 
disadvantage.

If I must have computer systems with publicly available terminals, the maps 
they display of my complex will have a room clearly marked as the Main 
Control Room. That room will be the Execution Chamber. The actual main 
control room will be marked as Sewage Overflow Containment.

My security keypad will actually be a fingerprint scanner. Anyone who 
watches someone press a  sequence of buttons or dusts the pad for 
fingerprints then subsequently tries to enter by repeating that sequence 
will trigger the death ray.

No matter how many shorts we have in the system, my guards will be 
instructed to treat every surveillance camera malfunction as a full-scale 
emergency.

I will spare someone who saved my life sometime in the past. This is only 
reasonable as it encourages others to do so. However, the offer is good one 
time only. If they want me to spare them again, they\'d better save my life 
again.

All midwives will be banned from the realm. All babies will be delivered at 
state-approved hospitals. Orphans will be placed in foster-homes, not 
abandoned in the woods to be raised by creatures of the wild.

When my guards split up to search for intruders, they will always travel in 
groups of at least two. They will be trained so that if one of them 
disappears mysteriously while on patrol, the other will immediately 
initiate an alert and call for backup, instead of quizzically peering ar  
ound a corner.

If I decide to test a lieutenant\'s loyalty and see if he/she should be made 
a trusted lieutenant, I will have a crack squad of marksmen standing by in 
case the answer is no.

If all the heroes are standing together around a strange device and begin 
to taunt me, I will pull out a conventional weapon instead of using my 
unstoppable super weapon on them.

I will not agree to let the heroes go free if they win a rigged contest, 
even though my advisors assure me it is impossible for them to win.

When I create a multimedia presentation of my plan designed so that my 
five-year-old advisor can easily understand the details, I will not label 
the disk "Project Overlord" and leave it lying on top of my desk.

I will instruct my Legions of Terror to attack the hero en masse, instead 
of standing around waiting while members break off and attack one or two at 
a time.

If the hero runs up to my roof, I will not run up after him and struggle 
with him in an attempt to push him over the edge. I will also not engage 
him at the edge of a cliff. (In the middle of a rope-bridge over a river of 
molten lava is not even worth considering.)

If I have a fit of temporary insanity and decide to give the hero the 
chance to reject a job as my trusted lieutenant, I will retain enough 
sanity to wait until my current trusted lieutenant is out of earshot before 
making the offer.

I will not tell my Legions of Terror "And he must be taken alive!" The 
command will be "And try to take him alive -- unless he resists."

If my doomsday device happens to come with a reverse switch, as soon as it 
has been employed it will be melted down and made into limited-edition 
commemorative coins.

If my weakest troops fail to eliminate a hero, I will send out my best 
troops instead of wasting time with progressively stronger ones as he gets 
closer and closer to my fortress.

If I am fighting with the hero atop a moving platform, have disarmed him, 
and am about to finish him off and he glances behind me and drops flat, I 
too will drop flat instead of quizzically turning around to find out what 
he saw.

I will not shoot at any of my enemies if they are standing in front of the 
crucial support beam to a heavy, dangerous, unbalanced structure.

If I\'m eating dinner with the hero, put poison in his goblet, then have to 
leave the table for any reason, I will order new drinks for both of us 
instead of trying to decide whether or not to switch with him.

I will not have captives of one sex guarded by members of the opposite sex.

I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly complicated, 
e.g. "Align the 12 Stones of Power on the sacred altar then activate the 
medallion at the moment of total eclipse." Instead it will be more along 
the lines of "Push the button."

I will make sure that my doomsday device is up to code and properly 
grounded.

My vats of hazardous chemicals will be covered when not in use. Also, I 
will not construct walkways above them.

If a group of henchmen fail miserably at a task, I will not berate them for 
incompetence then send the same group out to try the task again.

After I capture the hero\'s super weapon, I will not immediately disband my 
legions and relax my guard because I believe whoever holds the weapon is 
unstoppable. After all, the hero held the weapon and I took it from him.

I will not design my Main Control Room so that every workstation is facing 
away from the door.

I will not ignore the messenger that stumbles in exhausted and obviously 
agitated until my personal grooming or current entertainment is finished. 
It might actually be important.

If I ever talk to the hero on the phone, I will not taunt him. Instead I 
will say this his dogged perseverance has given me new insight on the 
futility of my evil ways and that if he leaves me alone for a few months of 
quiet contemplation I will likely return to the path of righteousness. 
(Heroes are incredibly gullible in this regard.)

If I decide to hold a double execution of the hero and an underling who 
failed or betrayed me, I will see to it that the hero is scheduled to go 
first.

When arresting prisoners, my guards will not allow them to stop and grab a 
useless trinket of purely sentimental value.

My dungeon will have its own qualified medical staff complete with 
bodyguards. That way if a prisoner becomes sick and his cellmate tells the 
guard it\'s an emergency, the guard will fetch a trauma team instead of 
opening up the cell for a look.

My door mechanisms will be designed so that blasting the control panel on 
the outside seals the door and blasting the control panel on the inside 
opens the door, not vice versa.

My dungeon cells will not be furnished with objects that contain reflective 
surfaces or anything that can be unraveled.

If an attractive young couple enters my realm, I will carefully monitor 
their activities. If I find they are happy and affectionate, I will ignore 
them. However if circumstance have forced them together against their will 
and they spend all their time bickering and criticizing each other except 
during the intermittent occasions when they are saving each
others\' lives at which point there are hints of sexual tension, I will 
immediately order their execution.

Any data file of crucial importance will be padded to at least 1.45Mb in 
size so that it won\'t conveniently fit on a single diskette.

Finally, to keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless trance, I 
will provide each of them with free unlimited Internet access and, of 
course, free e-mail!

Actually neither are particularly \'odd\' genetically or evolutionarily
speaking. The plants that grow around hot smokers are \'odd\' (chemosynathis),
but thats about the only example I can think of. One thing about evolution
is it almost always makes sense and is built around suprisingly few basic
design blocks. Thus on Earth most higher animals use paired sexual
reproduction; have four similar limbs, a head and a tail; have joints
arranged socket/hinge/socket; have spines and ribcages; etc. It appears that
when nature finds an efficent basic design it is simply modified to meet
changing circumstances. It is likely that aliens will be very \'odd\' indeed.
There is no good reason why other design blocks can\'t be used. Thus if on a
world the first vertibrates use a geodesic ribcage, there is a very strong
likelyhood that this will become a feature of all vertibrates, if early
Khusyu life produces a 3:1 female/male ratio, then this will be carried on.

So why would evolution throw up this ratio? The best answer is probably why
not? it doesn\'t hurt the reproductive capacity of the species, in fact it
helps it as only 25% of your population is reproductively useless verses
our 50% (strictly speaking only a very few males are needed to reproduce).
What it does hurt is adaptability. The male role in evolution is to be
experimented on; the female role is babyfactory. Thus when nature wants to
\'try\' a new gene (say colour blindness) it will effect males far more than
females, since they are more disposable in the short term. If the gene is
useful the males with it will be more successful and pass on that gene, if
not the gene dies out. Humans 50/50 ratio allows evolution to work faster
than the Aslan, but if all life on Khusyu has a 3:1 ratio then it\'s not a
problem is it?

There\'s no need for anything so \'fancy\', a mechanism already exists and is
well documented amongst humans. Y sperm is more likely to fertilise an egg
than X sperm, so that approximately 55% of all embyros are male at the time
of conception. However nature is experimenting even in the womb and male
embyroes are less viable than female ones and many will spontanously abort in
the first few weeks so that by 5 weeks the ratio is roughly 50/50. The Aslan
3:1 female/male ratio can be explained by either one of these two mechanisms,
or a combination of both.

However my own favourite idea is that all Aslan embyroes are initially
female but that environmental factors trigger 25% to change to male. This
can then help get over the evolutionary disadvantages of the ratio. If when
rapid evolution is required the environment will trigger more males. Also
allows lots of scope for Aslan mad scientists :*).

All Earth species (our only model so far) have a very strong drive to
\'liaise\' for the purpose of reproduction, otherwise they very quickly become
ex-species. Evolutionarly speaking the only reason for the desire to liaise
is to reproduce. We only have a sex drive because it makes us more likely
to reproduce, it serves no other function. Thus post-menopausal women suffer
a noticable drop in sex drive as they have served their \'reproductive
purpose\' (and all sorts of health problem kick in for the same reason);
where as men keep their sex drive fairly much undimished until death.

I\'d say it was fairly likely that Aslan females have a sex drive and that
Aslan society would have evolved a way of dealing with this for unmarried
females, either by male prostition or lesbian relationships. Interesting
though, low status males (outcasts etc) might be forced into prositition
to survive. In fact I\'d hazzard that male prosititution would be far more
common than female in Aslan society. Could make it interesting when the
drunken human crew of a starship visits a brothel in Aslan space :*).
(maybe the joke about the Aslan in the frenchmaid\'s outfit awhile back
is not as inappropriate as it seems).

One of the big things I\'ve noticed about the setting is that it seems to be
static. Fundamental limits seem to have set in and no-one seems to see these
as candidates for invention. Would it not be likely that there would be
research programs by big corporations, universities and even individuals to
over come these limits. The canonical history is full of these events but
the canonical present seems to be devoid of this activity. In the history a
number of fundamental limits were overcome:- sound barrier, light barrier,
age barrier, etc.

The communications barrier is what I see as one of the things that the
Imperium would be extremely keen on overcoming. The one week granularity of
the communication medium (ie. jumpspace) would surely be a target for
massive research.

How about a competition amoung the TML\'ers to see who can design a
deployable mechanism that would overcome the week delay. The winner will be
showered with kudos by all.

To get the ball rolling...

Event Horizon Communications presents:-

The Jumpspace Cable system.
- ----
The Jumpspace Cable is an object that exist in a large elongated jump
bubble. At its extremities are positioned interfaces that interact with a
similar interface in real space. The interfaces are separated by a parsec in
real space. Within the elongated jump bubble, which does not move through
jumpspace, the "cable" stretches for a long as is required to be able to
interface with the two real space interfaces. The real space and subspace
interfaces are connected by a microjumping XBoat or jump torpedo. While in
realspace, the Xboat collects data for transmission and forwards on the data
received. While in jumpspace it merges its jump bubble with the "cable" and
transfers its data. The major delay in the system would be the propagation
along the "cable" and the transfer times at the interfaces.

The merging of the jump bubbles is the core of the invention.

I was assuming acceleration is a more-or-less known direction because 
unless provided with some pretty hefty thrusters mounted sideways, 
Traveller ships won\'t turn at anything like 1 radian/sec^2 
acceleration.  Thus, a shot towards the bows means you have to move 
pretty well the whole ship\'s length to evade.

Well, I\'m with you on that, but I\'m having trouble justifying it to

You\'re completely right, probabilities don\'t work that way.  But
this isn\'t a question of probabilities!  If you fire two lasers
independently, you do get a probabilistic result.  If you fire them
together, aimed (craft diameter) apart, you can double the area of
space in which a laser shot can hit.

The "minimum distance to evade" you define represents the deviation 
from the movement the ship\'s original vector would produce.  However, 
it follows that the firing ship can guess whether the ship has evaded 
or not; if we assume linear acceleration (as I did) then there\'s a 
50:50 chance of guessing right.  Thus, if you fire two lasers, (craft 
diameter) apart, you will always hit.  The same principle applies 
even if the craft can rotate quickly, but you\'ll need more lasers as 
it could be in a circle, radius (minimum distance).

Having said which, what I said above *was* wrong... if you double the 
range you\'ll need four times as many lasers to guarantee a hit 
(linear acceleration) or sixteen times (significant off-linear).
However, the point about firing as a battery still holds: the range 
at which a ship is automatically hit is increased.

*WAY* off. Out of a few *thousand* in Rico\'s group at Camp Curry, they
had something like *4* deaths. They had more get involuntary medical

And most of the deaths and injuries were due to the fact that even

I just saw Total Recall for the first time the other day (on TV). I

Right this way. If the digits are arbitrary or only seem to be is a=20

It is even possible for two numbers, like pi and e to have complete=20

Yep; the males are the "artistic" ones.

Better make that business-like and non-traditional (for the Aslan), even if
it is more like the Roman alphabet you\'re familiar with as "traditional".
Remember, the Aslan makes are the traditionalists, and the females are the
innovators.


Here\'s what my Aslan article says about it (this is based on various Canon
sources).  I\'ve really got to get this article into print ...

  Fteirle [Aslan] share a common language, Trokh.  It has changed very
  little over the past 4,000 ftahea [Aslan years] and has only two dialects:
  one each for males and females.  There are even two different written
  forms of Trokh: one, Yoyoeaokhtef ("brush-writing"), is an ornate
  ideographic written form, and is used for official documents and for
  decoration.  The other is Tieftuawaoirlouheei (female script), which is a
  phonetic alpabet well-suited to business and technical documents, as well
  as many computer applications.

There you have it ...

This is for basic training.  Wannabe soldiers aren\'t assigned an MOS
until the graduate basic.  So this is for all trainees coming out of
Fort Leonard Wood.  Nothing is quite so confidence building as seeing
trainees hobble thru the PX in BDUs and tennis shoes.  <misty eyed

Yes, but if the evading ships pilot decides to ease his foot off the
gaspedal or whatever you\'ll miss.

That is: Picture the targets speed a known factor and set up a 2D
coordinate system (angular coordinates but we treat them as cartesian due
to them being so small compared to the ranges) with the predicted location
based upon last known velocity at origo. We have deduced what acceleration
the ship is capable of by continued measurements of velocity changes. Even
if we know the direction the acceleration will have more or less we do not
know its magnitude (there was some talk about the \'jerk\' value for
thrusterplates and others; how fast can they change their applied thrust?).
To get max hit propability we\'ll center our shot distribution pattern
around the center of the most likely acceleration (that is the same as the
last measured acceleration). Here the gunner might impart some of his
knowledge such as "I know this baby cannot do more than 1.67 G so we\'ll put
our patternscenter a bit further back".

All this is just bickering methinks as we both agree that it is fairly easy
to hit targets very far away. The good thing with this IMHO is that
shooting ranges go up to about the same as detection ranges which makes
good roleplaying. Factors such as vibrations from the shooters thrusters
misaligning the lasers and others have not been taken into account and I\'m
shure there are many more hinderances to shooting and we can emphasize them
or not depending on if we want spacecombat to resemble naval battles or
submarine fights - I vote for the latter.

Many years ago (1982?) I toyed with the idea of an alphabet based on
using their dewclaws to carve letters on wood (as the beginning early
in their history) but didn\'t do much with it.  It was rather curvy and
swirly and something like kanji or other chinese/japanese 
letters/symbols. Just a thought ...

Given how much of their culture seems Japanese/Samurai, I opted for
the warrior/poet type of mentalility wherein the warrior had to be
adept as some sort of \'art\' besides the sword.

What I meant to suggest is not that they don\'t have a sex drive, but that
it\'s intermittent -- controlled by a relatively autonomous oestral cycle,
or triggered by prolonged exposure to a particular adult male\'s pheromones,
or whatever.

Hm!  I haven\'t seen _Solomani & Aslan_, but I guess that contains some
samples of Aslan script?  My imagination would have male script be, as you
say, florid in the extreme -- like Burmese script on mescaline, or X, or
both.  Female script would be a chopped-down version of that -- or
forerunner of that, maybe.  I\'d also imagine that males don\'t type or use
voice transcription; it\'s important to show one\'s breeding and aesthetic
mettle by exhibiting calligraphic refinement at all times -- thus,
electronic writing pads, etc.  Females wouldn\'t care.

For some graphical ideas, there\'s some good websites out there with samples
of various writing systems, including the dozens of lesser-known-to-us
South and Southeast Asian ones.  Don\'t have any URLs at hand, though.
There\'s a number of general coffee-table-style books on the subject as well
- -- your local library might have some.

\'Course, there\'s always the question of what sort of system Aslan scripts
are.  Alphabetic, syllabic, morphophonemic, hybrids?  Any canonical
statement on this?

That has a simple and obvious answer: they look like a claw.
Early Aslan writing was almost certianly marks clawed into wood. Maybe
developing into marks made on clay (I\'m a big fan of Cuneiform). (Didn\'t
they develop in prarie\'s or river basins?)
It was probably quite a long time before they came up with artificial
writing implements at all. Probably chizels for stonework. The original
"brush" might have been someone\'s tail. Later more recognisable brushes
made from their own fur. Then other, more suitable furs. As pens became as
much as an artform as the writing itself with the hair being of more and
more exotic prized creatures.

>So I can get an idea of the look for their language.
I believe that both Arabic and Hebrew characters descend from the various
Cuneiform scripts. (But I could be wrong.)

>UNLESS, there is the possibility that the males
>are much more "artistic" in general design,
Yes, Males _are_ more artistic. There attitude would lead them to the logic
that it is more important that it looks good, than that someone can read
it.

>I think in either case I\'m going to make the female script to be more
>business-like and traditional.
I think you mean "more business-like _than_ traditional." Traditional
scripts are going to be the more archaic and represent previous type-forms.
For example, on most computers you have "Times New Roman" which has seriefs
and such and derives from lead type. You also have Arial or Helvetica, a
sans-serief font that is much more likely to be used as the basic system
font. It is a more modern photo-typesetting derivation.
I would look to cuneiform for your inspiration. (Check out
http://www.sron.ruu.nl/~jheise/akkadian/index.html) Pick a few of the more
basic shapes to be in your alphabet. Simplify the triangales and wedges to
dots and lines.

(Aside: what font design package are you using? I\'ve done a lot of work
previously in MetaFont. I\'m looking for a Winodws based (free) True Type
font design package to transfer some of my stuff to.)

Cheers,

Jo

They need to be grouped in such squadrons when they set off for enemy space,
yes. They don\'t need it to guard a planet from pirates. Pirates do not
operate in larger raider squadrons (and any that did would need to prey on
worlds with a lot of traffic, which would have defenses of their own).
More importantly, pirates don\'t like to fight armed ships, because it is
not cost effective. In the Traveller Universe arming a ship is comparatively
cheap, but making it an _effective_ armed ship is very expensive.
 
>Additionally, they need to be stationed near the border.

Canonically the regular fleets of the Imperial Navy only use 14% of the
military budget. The colonial ships of the IN use another 14% of the budget,
and they are built, maintained and stationed in the subsector where the
money is collected. The planetary navies account for between 42 and 66%
and are also, of course, stationed where the money comes from (Assumption:
The Imperial army accounts for roughly the same part of the Imperial
military budget that the army of a vacuum world does, while a planetary
army runs from 6 to 40% of the local budget).

Now, the colonial fleets are propably not a mirror image of the regular
fleets, but there must be some correlation because obsolescent ships 
from the regular fleets are transferred to the colonial forces and
because colonial fleets are supposed to reinforce regular ones. In
addition, the cruisers and battleships (and their escorts) of interior
subsectors do not have to be at the same state of readiness to defend
as those of the frontier subsectors, so even if they don\'t have as many
raiders as the frontier fleets, they are more able to deploy capital
ships away from their major systems.

Well, if you only have one or two convoys every three months then that is
best. With the four protected intermediate systems (I assume that the end
points of the route will be defended by other forces), you can send off
any number of ships at any time with no delay at all.
(Btw. how many routes go through four intermediate systems between systems
with home defenses? Very few, I\'d say, though I know that the Gyro Cadiz
task force did).

>Also, if you group armed merchants into convoys, their own firepower can
>be a significant assistance to the Naval vessels).

Not if they are up against proper warships. A merchant will have a
computer with as low a factor as he can get away with (ie. capable of
handling his maximum jump, but no more). The difference between a factor
1 computer and a factor 9 makes it impossible even to hit the attacker.
Even the difference between a factor 3 and a factor 6 is huge.

A raider force supposedly consists of one or two cruisers plus an
undefined number of lesser ships. If it is the size of a traditional
squadron then there will be about 8 lesser ships of destroyer size.
Pirates, if they exist, are armed merchantmen or perhaps Corsairs. In
short: you don\'t need nearly as many ships to protect against pirates
as you need to protect against raiders.

And, btw. you don\'t need to protect merchants everywhere all the time.
If a system is such a backwater that only one ship per year goes there,
you only need to protect it there once a year. You may not even have to
do that (depends on whether said ship is on a regular schedule or not),
because a pirate can\'t afford to loiter in a system for an average of
six months hoping for prey.

Granted, not many systems are quite that much of a backwater, but there
are a number of them.

Vulnerable for a short while, yes. Most of the merchant ships in the first
system the raiders get to will be in deep shit. So will the ones arriving
at that system for the next 14 days. After that you will have some weeks
of disruption while the merchants huddle in safe ports while convoys get
organized. Meanwhile, the protective forces in the systems that are hit
may be lost, or they may get away. In any case, the ones in nearby systems
get the warning a week later, which is exactly the same time those
stationed at major systems get it, or perhaps two weeks later (depends on
how many ships you believe there would be in a scout force), in which
case they are one week delayed.

Only, keeping your guard ships idling at instant readiness at your main
systems is no better. In fact, it is very much worse. Say you have 100
systems in your AO that are too small to have a home fleet. Say you
opponent have 100 raider ships. If you keep all your ships at your home
bases, your opponent can spread out his 100 ships to all 100 vulnerable
systems, which means that you lose all traffic going to every one of those
systems for the two weeks it takes to hear of it and send out your own
ships. If instead you have a single raider-sized ship stationed in every
system, you force him to double up, which means you only lose the traffic
to 50 systems (plus a number of your guard ships; the exact number depends
on whether it is possible to achieve surprise by jumping in near another
vessel and on what extra rules you apply to the combat system to reflect
the advantage of surprise; if you use straight HG rules you lose very few,
if any). If you station a squadron or a couple of cruisers in each system,
you force hime to concentrate in 12 or 15 ship squadrons restricting your
losses to 6-8 systems.

Even with advanced communications systems, children learn best when they are
physically present with theirpeers and instructors, especially when they are
young. The Delswa grav vehicle is designed as a schoolbus. It can seat 56
children in comfort (or 56 adults in discomfort) and safety. Speed is not an
issue on most routes; the Delswa\'s 109 km/hmaximum is quite adequate. Grav
compensation can be added, but it increases the price to over kCr 37; most
school systems prefer to install a governor limiting the acceleration to 1G.
Roadgrid and an standard fire suppression system make the Delswa a safe
method of transporting children.

Billed as a luxury aircar, the Dsalpor is affordable by almost anyone, and

a family aircar with the addition of an entertainment centre and a wet bar.
No sensors are instaled, limiting the Dsalpor to the ground-based Roadgrid on
most civilized worlds. Although the Dsalpor is capable of reaching orbit, its
thin skin and lack of life support make any such trips unlicensed; an offense
usually punishable by confiscation of the offending vehicle.

There are several different, though related, issues. The first one is how
often a pirate gets a chance to capture a ship. One large slice of the
discussion hinges on how many systems would have one or more patrol
vessels present and on just how much that would affect the pirate\'s
chances. Not even the most ardent anti-piracy advocate (that would be
me) claims that a pirate wouldn\'t be free to go after at least inbound
ships if they were alone in the system.

The second issue is how likely the pirate is to capture his prey. That
part of discussion deals with just what your common or garden pirate
would be capable of. Is his engines better than his prey\'s, is his
computer better than its, can he capture it without taking damage
himself, can he threathen it into surrender?

The third issue is the economics of the profession: Does a pirate capture
the whole ship or just make off with the cargo? Can a pirate aim to catch
especially valuable cargoes or does he have to take what fate delivers to
him? How much can he sell his loot for, and where? And finally, can he
make enough money to pay his expenses and provide a profit.

Obviously all three issues are to some degree interrelated, If a pirate
installs a new computer then he become much better able to fight, which
means a better chance of capturing his prey and outfighting 200 T weakling
patrol ships, but he also have to \'earn\' much more money to pay for the
computer. If he only takes cargoes he dosen\'t provoke as much reaction
from the authorities, but he also have to capture far more ships to earn
the same amount of money. This makes the discussion twist and turn as it
shifts from emphasizing one issue to another. (Thus I\'ve found myself
debating the cost and effectiveness of a single SDB despite the fact
that I don\'t really think SDBs will be used to patrol backwater systems.)

A fourth, somewhat tangential, issue is whether or not a ship can conduct
business in a system and still avoid leaving behind enough hard data to
enable the authorities to track it down at a later date.

Essentially I believe that if you use the straight CT rules then the
opportunities to catch a worthwhile prey, the chance of making the
capture and the value you get out of a capture are so low and the risk
and expense of operating a pirate operation so high that the odds are
stacked way beyond reason against professional pirates, while keeping
the identity of your ship a secret is incompatible with normal merchant
operations, which makes amateur piracy a mug\'s game too.

If you press me I have to admit that, yes, piracy is _possible_, just,
IMO, very, very unlikely. But then, in the statement that set off the
present round of the debate I said that piracy didn\'t make much sense
in the Traveller universe, not that it was downright impossible.

Next summer, earn extra pocket money selling ice cream from a Giilkan cart.
Modern fibre laminate construction and a space-efficient serving unit make
the Giilkan a joy to peddle, while almost 500 litres of storage holds enough

(Obviously, the CSC design system does not work very well for peddle-powered

Go find some books on the Burgess-findings (spelling?). Some geologists
found a bunch of really old (about 350 million years old, I think) animals
who had been fossilized under a mudslide near a coastline. Most of these
animals ARE odd. The first animal they found was named \'Hallucigenia\' ...

The modern Earth does not have a very big variation of species. Every single
insect has six legs, four wings, a head and a body in two parts. True, some
species have the wings underdeveloped or grown together, but they all come
from one basic design (SIDS ... Standard Insect Design System). This means
that every insect species has origins tracing back to the same species.

The animals found in Burgess were different from each other ... dozens of
different creatures with virtually no common bond.

Most of these species died out, but one or two has descendants today. One of
these descendants is a group of worms that lives on muddy seabeds (i.e. in
the same way as their ancestors did millions of years ago).

Get a good book featuring these creatures, especially with pictures. They
really get your imagination going alien.

Clarify this: what is the point of an unarmed Patrol ship?

It takes at least 2 weeks for information obtained in a patrol to be
acted upon, by that time, the info is dated.

If a patrol sees someting it _can_ act upon, it should be armed so it
can do so.

Also, the infamous 10 dia. limit comes into play, or are you suggesting
deploying tanker ships with every Patrol vessel?

If you assume disrupting trade is an effective strategem, then you also
must assume that defending against that tactic is advisable.

The best defence against an external threat disrupting your trade *is*
spreading ships evenly throughout every world with trade, and/or regular
patrols of larger fleet elements thoughout every world with trade.

I believe the intent is to have forces patroling throughout many worlds,
jumping from world to world on a non-repeating, "random" schedule.

Would be pirates or raiders would not be able to predict beforehand
whether a target world would have a patrol in it or not.

That sounds like a real hard fact. Ships for piracy suppression will be
listed separately from ships of the same class intended for raiding and
those separately from those intended for convoy duties.

OK, here I have to turn to other, more knowledgable people. I would have
thought that the line items would have been something like :"Item 367: X
hundred _Chrysanthemum_ Class destroyers; Item 368: Y hundred _Fer-de-Lance_
Class destroyers; Item 369: 24 _Kinunir_ Class frontier cruisers; etc."
Does the US Coast Guard really list their budget by so-and-so much to
prevent smuggling, so-and-so much to prevent piracy, so-and-so much to
rescue ships in distress, etc? What happens if an anti-smuggler ship
happen to help a ship in distress or vice versa? Does it mess up the
accounting something fierce?

David, I think the Imperial Navy budget will list the number of ships of
each class it has. Come the yearly appropiation battle the IN admiralty
will do everything they can to convince the fisc that they need them all
and that even if they don\'t then it would be wasteful to put those ships
in ordinary, because as soon as the ships are off the active list all
sorts of Vargr and Aslans and pirates will crop up and you\'ll have to
pay to reactivate them again. Eventually they will get an appropiation.
They will de- or recommision ships according to how well they did, and
then they will use whatever ships they have for the most immidiate
problems, regardless of what arguments they used during the appropiation
debate. So what if the Admiralty got the committee to agree to those
_Chrysanthemums_ by playing up the Zhodani scare. If the Zhodani are
quiscent this year and the pirates are not, then the local admiral
will use more assets against the pirates. The only question is whether
he would have enough available.

But that is because the US Navy does have something else to do with them.
Does the Imperial Navy have anything more important to do in peacetime than
preventing the loss of multimillion credit vessels? I doubt it. And I
most emphatically doubt that a pirate with a free hand (which he will
have if there is no patrol ship in the system) will not take the ship
along with the cargo if he can.

That is the way David Weber treats jump movement in his Honor
Harrington and Starfire books. Ships can jump instantly between
systems, but only at predetermined locations within the solar system.
Ships have to enter a system through the jump point, and then cross
the volume of the solar system to reach the next jump point to the
next solar system. Sometimes, though the jump points are not "open" on
both ends, but have to be found by jumping through them instead of
locating them from either end.

Aslan male script is flowing and ornate.  It is not read silently, but
recited.  It is considered a form of art, and is included in decorations. 
Think arabic.

Female script is simpler, plainer, and easier to write.


Female script would be easy to do.  Male script would be hard to do as a
font, because the forms of letters change when put together, so that the
whole word looks better artistically.

I tell ya, Tim Curry is the perfect Lucan. Evil, twisted, insane, flys
off the handle more easily than John would. Also has that comedic bent.
Lucan should act the fool.

I was leaning towards Glenn Close, but Streep\'s good.

I was thinking Kenneth Branagh -- Noble, tragic Shakespearian actor

I\'m not really sold on Nicholson as Norris. I\'m thinking a stockier,
more genteel, more "cossack"-y type. Maybe if Al Pacino gained a few

I think it was 6 hours..I have the tape copy of the long version, which
included some artist rendered scenes to go with \'historical\' narrative.

I just got off the site, having voted.  I am quite impressed by the fighter 
designs.  The ballot form was easy to use.  It beats having to run through 
all those e-mails comparing the designs etc...  A very good v1.0.  Keep up 
the good work!  One suggestion:  how about a field for commentary and 
criticisms.  I think others would agree when I say we designers like to see 
what people have to say about designs we come up with.  Helps us learn from 
mistakes, and (in the case of your Corp in ISBA) is good PR! :)

Well, speaking of commentary here\'s mine:

XTF-4 "Delta" Class Fighter by X-TEK

I could not vote on this one, as it was mine own design.  But I will comment 
on it nonetheless:

<Warning, Commander will now toot his own horn>
Possibly the only craft on the list not designed using Andy Atkins 
spreadsheet, as can be seen by the enormous "Engineering Data" on the page. 
 True, I entered this design a bit early, almost as soon as it was suggested 
I went to work on it immediately.  A lot of time went into this craft as 
every detail and specification was acknowledged.  The tactical decision to 
use a Quad MFD Standard turret laser battery was excellent.  Actually the 
battery was taken out of the SSDS weapon list, but proofed with FF&S2.  The 
advantages of a linked turret battery are evident.  Lasers have excellent 
range, and a turret allows the tactical advantage of a "flyby".  You can 
pass beyond your target and still lock weapons.  Speed was an important 
consideration.  I was aiming for at least 5g.  Not easy with such a dense 
craft.  The specification requirements were important in the design as well. 
 Extra fuel duration, Standard LS, and an ejection system are the result. 
 The major flaw I see with this design is that other entries have double the 
armour of the Delta.  Alas, the price you pay for added speed.

Gede Class Strike Fighter.
This one got high marks from me.  I had seen this on Andy\'s site when I got 
the spreadsheet, and wondered if he would enter it.  He did!  This puppy 
packs a Rapid Fire (800RoF?)Particle Gun as its main armament.  This was 
something the boys in X-TEK R&D were working on! You beat me to the punch! 
Also it mounts 8 missiles for added effect.  Nasty little weapon platform. 
 Mind you the speed is a bit low. 4g in space, and only 800kph in 
atmosphere.  Nonetheless a great design.

Gentle Breeze
Interesting design.  The laser is interesting as it is a nonstandard focal 
array optimized for distance.  The problem is it\'s only one weapon.  If that 
weapon is hit, then what?
The 1ton module is a good innovation, Extra fuel or ordinance is always a 
good thing.  Good Armour, but not so good structure.  Once the armour is 
gone, you\'re in trouble.

Tsiko
Great Yaskodray!  Yet another designer putting a "Micro-Mass Weapon" on a 
fighter.  In this case a 400Mj Meson Gun!(Yet another X-TEK project in the 
works)  This baby got high marks in the "Unusualness" category from me.  But 
as the designer stated, there are some flaws.  the most obvious is the 
speed, Only 2G.  The armour is rather low (I still debate that there should 
be fractional armour values in this case the SSDS armour would be about a 9 
in my book.)  Still, this is the fighter of choice for those "Gung Ho" 
hotshot fighter pilot types with a need to blast things to tiny bits! 
 Personally I still need speed! I noticed the Corporate advert. Munchausen 
Kinetics --> MunchKin.  Yep, pretty much sums it up! :)

The Dragon Hunter, er.. Drachen Jaeger( Ja, ich sprache eine kline deutch!)
Not bad, not bad at all.  A Spinal mount laser.  Nice touch.  As are the 
mission specific pods. Care was given to include meals for extended duration 
missions.  But the speed.  7g?  Is that constant acceleration?  If so the 
pilots will suffer from hi-g strain as the compensators can only deal with 
3g and the pilot up to 2g at TL-12.  Other than this a good design.

Firefly
This was pretty close to the standard fighter I remember from older Trav 
versions, although in a larger version.  2 forward firing Laser lances. 
about 5g acceleration (max possible at this TL w/o adverse effects IMNSHO). 
 This is where the similarities end.  Things that stood out where the PD 
lasers, the sandcaster and the Terrain following avionics.
But...
Is all the lift for this vehicle from the Airframe?  There are no CG lifters 
installed.  This could cause problems for emergency landing on airless 
worlds.

Many of you used Andy\'s Spreadsheet (he gets the X-TEK dog biscuit for Tech 
Support!) which created some wonderful designs.  I\'m thinking of using this 
to create new vehicles, weapons, and to update my current line of ships.  I 
will prolly do what the CSC crew had been doing and post designs on a 
regular basis.  I would encourage others to do the same.

I now leave you to your regularly scheduled ListServer already in progress.

I\'ve experimented with this.  If you use a flat instrument (instead of a
round one), you can hold it between your thumb and two fingers.  The thumb
is on one side of the instrument, and the two fingers, located above and
below the thumb, are on the other.  By using finger pressure, while keeping
the thumb stiff, I found I could write legible English using a felt-tip
pen (albeit about twice as large as I normally write).  I assume Aslan
pens and brushes are shaped with appropriate indentations to make holding
it correctly even easier.

It is.

Funny you should ask that.  Here\'s some more from the article.  I assume
that the female script would use individual letters for each sound
(excepting EA, OA, OU, UA, and UI), while the brush script would use a
single character for each word.


  Pronounciation: Most Humans consider Trokh difficult to pronounce,
  particularly the vowel sounds.  For a native speaker, the language paces
  the speaker\'s breathing with its rythms.  Aslan pronounce some sounds
  when inhaling, and others by exhalation, resulting in a fast and flowing
  language.  To Galanglic speakers, Trokh sentances sound like one impossibly
  long word, without a single pause.

  Trokh

  A       like the "o" in "lock"
  AI      like the "i" in "kite"
  AO      like the "ao" in the Chinese "Mao"*

  H       like the "h" in "hit"
  HF      like the "hf" in "hfang"*

  Word Generation

  Learning the entire Trokh language, vocabulary, and grammar is far too
  difficult for most Traveller players (and writers!).  However, a random
  procedure which generates Trokh-sounding words is available and easy to
  use.  Simply generate a word and assign the desired meaning to it.  Since
  Trokh doesn\'t translate well to Galanlic, meanings can vary considerably
  without causing problems.

  Trokh words are composed of syllables, just like Galanglic.  There are
  four types: those that are a vowel alone (V), syllables beginning with a
  consonant (CV), ones that end with a consonant (VC), and those that both
  begin and end with a consonant (CVC).

  A few rules govern how sylables are grouped together.  No sylable ending
  with a consonant can be followed by a syllable beginning with a consonant.
  A single letter vowel cannot be followed by the same single letter vowel,
  although dipthongs (multple letter vowels) may follow one another.

  Trokh words can be nearly any length, from formal names with dozens of
  sylables to nicknames with two or three.  Select a length for the word, or
  simply roll 1D6.  For each syllable, determine the type from the table.
  Use the basic table for the first syllable, or if the previous syllable
  ended in a vowel; otherwise use the alternate table.  For each consonant
  and vowel determine the individual sound from the appropriate column.

Hmmm...it\'s a stretch, but Donald Sutherland, playing straighter than he
usually does, would work for me. He can certainly pull off the
world-weariness that must surely affect Strephon by the end of the
Rebellion.

Tragic overactor, IMHO <G>.  Ian Holm _is_ appealing.  Gravitas, with an

maybe?

Bingo!  RuPaul as his intendant secretary.  (Gotta be tall, right?)

That\'s what I thought, until I read a review of it in the video release
section of the local "alternative" paper here in Seattle, _The Stranger_ --
don\'t have the writer\'s name, unfortunately, but I\'ll post it anyway:

On second thought, it was a GREAT film.  I can\'t wait till I\'m able to
regard _Starship Troopers_ in the same light.

OK, first of all, let me appolgize for loose nomenclature.
When I say "tumble" all I mean is that it is not rotating
about the long axis.  As to why, I can\'t say a really
remember (it\'s been a long time)....

Eventally all real world spinning objects will end up
spinning about a certain axis.  If I remember right, its
the one that has the most angular inertia, for a long
object this is spinning in an "end to end tumble" (though
this wouldn\'t explain why a football ends up spinning on it\'s
nose).  How this happens I\'m not sure, except that it involves
small pertubations (a "perfect" object wouldn\'t, presumably,
do this).

Maybe someone else can give more detail.

When I send underlings to capture the heroes I will ensure that they have

them to retreat and not fight to the last man if suddenly outmatched by a
Secret Weapon.

I will instruct underlings to report to me if they see their commanding
officer disobeying orders, letting prisoners go, or repeating like an echo
whatever a hero says.

If the hero is not in his home/office/clubhouse when my minions break in,
they are to wait there for his return and not make obvious signs of their
presence.

I will only kill underlings who lie to me and hide their failures. Underlings
who admit their failures will be reassigned to less demanding duties.

I will not repeat pet phrases or rhymes from my violent younger days to any
prisoners or visitors, in case this is the only memory said persons have of
their parents\' killer.

Any critical mechanism such as self-destruct, life support, or protective

simple on/off switch.

I will construct my secret base of fire resistant materials and store all
my drums of explosives in locked isolated storerooms.

I will design my Death Robots in a non-humanoid form so heroes cannot use
their equipment and weaponry.

Guards will be provided with bunk rooms outside the cell blocks in case
they need to take a nap.

I will store any alien artifacts, mystic portals, or doomsday weapons in
secure laboratories and not my control room.

I will not explain my master plan to an army of underlings until the plan
has already been completed successfully.

When double-crossing a dupe or hireling I will not say "I lied" until after

To report enemy action.

Well, it can be used in 1 week to make sure that ships that
can\'t take on the enemy forces.  But, more to the point,
the fact is that the only way to stop an enemy fleet from
rampaiging through your Empire is to be able to predict
where they are going.  Thus, regardless of the time
delay, being able to gather the data and use it
to predict enemy action is going to be crucial
to military success (and is what sperates the
admirals that you hear about in history from the
rest).

>Also, the infamous 10 dia. limit comes into play, or are you suggesting
>deploying tanker ships with every Patrol vessel?

No.  They fuel up before they go on patrol.  Maneveuver
and life support take so much less fuel that a scout
can opperate for considerable time before it looses
the ability to jump.

>If you assume disrupting trade is an effective strategem, then you also
>must assume that defending against that tactic is advisable.

And you do that at the main worlds.  If you distribute your
forces so you can stop _every_ raiding force at _every_
system, you aren\'t going to be in trouble when the
main invasion fleet comes through.

>The best defence against an external threat disrupting your trade *is*
>spreading ships evenly throughout every world with trade, and/or regular
>patrols of larger fleet elements thoughout every world with trade.

Well, no.  First of all, you only need to worry about areas
near the frontier.  Second of all, putting those kind

Didn\'t Rico\'s Dad get publicly whipped for speaking out against the Government? -
sounds pretty fascist to me. I could be mistaken, It has been a long time since I
read the book.

	Limited franchise just for starters.  Substitute "Party Member" for
"Veteran" and things get a little spooky.  The history of ST Earth after
the collapse of the democracies, with the veterans coming home and
restoring order sounds a lot like the Freikorps.  And the reliance on swift
capital punishment is also a classic feature of fascism.  Taxation without
representation.  That sort of thing.

	Think about how an S.S. Mann would describe life in Nazi Germany.
The trains run on time, everything is newly prosperous after the post-WWI
chaos, the Party is running everything in an orderly fashion, strict law
and order (including capital punishment) is making Germany a safer place,
and everything is just so peachy keen that he and his buddies are willing
to train real hard, be incredibly well-disciplined and devoted to duty, and
put their lives on the line to defend their Fatherland and Race.  And his
face would be glowing and his eyes moist as he said it.  He\'d be in total
earnest, probably absolutely inspirational if he were a good public
speaker, and the really scary evil stuff would just be glossed over or said
so matter-of-factly that you\'d probably do a triple-take ("was he serious
about that bit about eliminating social parasitism WITH NERVE GAS?").

	Sounds awfully like Johnny Rico, doesn\'t it :)?

	However, IMHO, it\'s not classic fascism per se; just way, way, way
too authoritarian for my tastes.  What really gets me is that the political
system described in ST the book is largely contrary to the basic political
ideals the U.S.A. was founded on; taxation without representation, absence
of due process, and so forth.  Heinlein must have known this, and from what
I understand of his politics, probably would have found this system
somewhat reprehensible.  This is why I think that it was a sort of critical
thinking test for his readers...

Thanks!  I\'ve been holding my breath waiting for "the damn thing crashed
my browser and kicked my dog!" bug reports, but so far feedback is
uniformly positive.  Should\'ve done this long ago...

Already on my to-do list for THUDDD 8...just didn\'t have time to think it
through sufficiently this time.

Very good comments.  Thanks for the MCr 0.02...

How about Roddy McDowell, Ron Perlman is to big, but think of Roddy in a

What, with all those names in this epic? Hollywood would love it, now
condense the idea into a one page precis and present the script to Hollywood.
Emphasis that the game comes with a fan base, and that there is already
merchandise available,( I bet all of us would start collecting the
traveller action figures, )

Now all we need is a script..

ohh... and point out that there is a large chance for sequels....

ps. I think the honourable admiral who gets killed would be better for Marc
Miller, it sounds like a part with more substance, and a more memorable
character. The rest can be walk ons.

For that matter, we could have the TML members do the crowd scenes

Panic in the Thone room, rioting in the streets, burning of effigies etc.

That way if we find out that they are doing what they did to Starship
Troopers we could  \'flame\'  them in person  :)

The human articulatory apparatus will also give seriously different
acoustic results for the "same" sound produced with an ingressive pulmonic
airflow -- perhaps Aslan physiology is different?

Are certain of the sounds listed below always produced with ingressive or
always with egressive airflow?  Or is it simply a positional thing,
depending on whether the speaker\'s lungs need air in or out at any given
point in the utterance?

Quibble:  At least in my dialect of English, the "ou" of "house" isn\'t
distinguishable from the Putonghua or Beijing pronunciations of "Mao".

I think it was in the 4 to 6 hour range.  4 sounds right I believe.  Awhile
ago, they played it on a local station and I think my brother might have
taped it.  My friend thinks it may be out (in long form) on videotape as a
relatively recent release.

Well, I\'m surprised that you don\'t know the *real* meaning of flame

The attack on the Death star is reminiscent of certain scenes from The
Bridges at Toko Ri. And I suggest you rent a film called The Dam Busters. It
has some _very_ familiar dialogue as the specially-modified Lancs are moving
towards the dam.

I came within a hair\'s breadth of strangling a pair of 16-year-olds when I
went to see the re-release of Star Wars. They thought they were at a MST3K
festival, and were laughing at the text scrolling up the screen. Fortunately,
they fell into a stunned and respectful silence at the appearance of the
Imperial destroyer...

Fortunately for me, that is...murder is a felony in Illinois. : )

Anybody else remember the DC limited series "The Watchmen"?  near the end,
the villian is explaining his plot to prevent WWIII to the two heros who
have found him.  When one of the heros threatens to stop him, the villian
calmly replies

"Do you think I would explain any of this if you had the slightest chance
of stopping it?  I did it twenty-three minutes ago."

No, the only floggings mentioned were one that Juan snuck out to watch as a
child (which was canceled), and the two in basic.  Absolutely nothing was
ever said about a lack of freedom of speech.

In short, you can live your life quite happily and successfully without
having the vote, but to get the franchise (and the reserved jobs) you have
to give something.. a couple of years of your life to service.

Ah.  As a combat-arms type I went through everything at Ft. Benning in one
13-week buzzsaw.  We ran PT in running shoes, did everything else in LPCs.

>>My first FTX was the last one at Ft. benning to use wax bullets.  Ouch.

The price for getting keyed back to life was usually in the range of 100
push-ups in full gear.  Full MOPP gear if you had been *real* stupid.  Plus
having to run the excercise again.  We treated it with great seriousness.

My 1SG at the 197th Inf Bde had a theory.  "Hell is full of Motor Pools.
If you die in an excercise, you will go to Hell."  This meant you spent the
next week pulling guard mount.

I would have prefered the bruises.

Just change it to something nicer.  The original GDW data was full of these
lovely little systems that no amount of handwaving could deal with.  My
favorite was the Ag world orbiting a M9v.  What were they growing? Iceburg
Lettuce?

The actual didget that the Pop code is the multiple of.  Example: Earth is
Pop 9, Pop multiplier 5.  Population is around 5,000,000,000 people.

Yeah, but unless you want to wait weeks to months after the

grouped up in peacetime.

Well, this is debatable.  You don\'t need as many ships to protect
one spot.  But if you are going to stop piracy you have to protect
every world with trade in every system.  For convoys you only
need to protect the supply routes through the high pop world.

I would say there are very few.  Even most low pop worlds have
mining (and such) that will produce more than one ship/year.
If you add in that most worlds are one the way to somplace
(and ships with different jump ratings will stop different
places), there are, IMO, very few world that only get 1 ship
per year (A good guess would be jus the ones with numbers
instead of names).

It would take months to collect them from all over the
Spinward Marches.  I consider this unacceptably long,
not a short time.  The worst case is even worse
since, if yoy have your ships dispersed, how do
you protect the messenger ships that you send to
tell everyone to form up.

Also, since, as you note...
> Most of the merchant ships in the first

The cost of these losses (which would not occur if they weren\'t
dispersed for piracy) will mean you will need more ships and
will be more costs to be lain at the feet of piracy suppression.

So instead of loosing traffic to the mains systems and long the
main routes, you loose traffic to the marginal systems that
only make up 10% of the Imperiums population?  Seems like
a win to me.  But of course if you disperse your ships, you
would loose those ships to.  Also, if the fleets are already
formed up, you are going to be able to respond to those other
attacks faster.

This last is the key.  Loosing ships as fast as he can pick them off
and perhaps even disrupting orders to form up so these losses can
be stopped.

Here is my attempt at a FTL communication system. 

All you need is a long, a very long piece of string and an 2 elastic
bands. The piece of string will stretch from one system to another and
is attached to a base station in each system by the elastic band.

Communication is now simple and almost instant. A quick tug of the
string is a 0 and a slow tug of the string can be a 1. Using simple
Morse code complex messages can be communicated quickly.

Minor details like finding a material strong enough to stretch across
the reaches of space, and so on, can be left to the engineers.

There is an improved version of this system which encloses the string in
a tube. This version became know as the Tube Communication System or TCS
for short.

Well trillions died in The Rebellion and its aftermath, that seems
pretty horrific to me.  :(

Maybe we should split this Traveller movie cast list up into two
versions 1) musical commedy and 2) all else

I am not up on current musicals but how about

The Imperial Horror Picture Show

Lyrics - Tim Rice
Music - Andrew Lloyd Weber
Electronic Instrumentals - Christopher Franke
Directed - Alan Parker (Evita)
Produced - J Michael Straczynski

Emperor Strephon - Tim Robbins (a la Bob Roberts)
Empress Iolanthe - Liza Minelli (if she can stay sober long enough)
Princess Iphegenia - ?
The Aslan Ambassador - Ron Pearlman (typecasting, no idea if he sings)
Archduke Dulinor - Antonio Banderas (as seen in Evita)
Emperor Lucan - Jason Alexander
Prince Varian - Marc Miller (a non singing cameo)  
Duchess Margaret - Bette Middler
Archduke Norris - Lyle Lovett (he\'d need to gain some weight)
Seldrian - k.d. lang
Archduke Brzk - Paul Simon (maybe Frankie Valli for the high pitched
voice alone...)
Archduke Ishuggi of Vland - Paul Robeson would be good (but he\'s
slightly dead)
Archduke Craig - I\'m not sure if we need him in our musical thematically
Lt Trace Windhock - ?
Coordinator of SolSec - Tom Lehrer 
Margaret\'s evil sidekick (ie her Husband ?) - Jonathan Pryce (Evita)
Honourable admiral who Lucan executes in the 1st scene - 
Dishonourable admiral who Lucan executes in the 1st scene - Leroy
Guantney (a non singing role) (maybe he is defenestated off the Imperial
Palace)
Archduke Norris\'s sidekick (Dilgadin) - Patrick Stewart
The Hiver whose Manipulation started the whole Rebellion - animatronics
w/ Weird Al Yankovic\'s voice

If the (very hypothetical) Traveller movie was done as a musical commedy
Tim Curry (as seen in Rocky) might make a good Lucan but he is a bit old
for the part today.  Naturally if it is done as a musical commedy I
would expect it to include my adaptation of The Lord High Executioners
song from Gilbert and Sullivans Mikado as I inflicted on (er, posted
too) this list a few months ago and that Doug has made available on his
web site http://www.hooked.net/~dberry/silytrav.html  - Traveller The
Silly Era (shameless plug, thanks for putting it up Doug).

Comments are welcomed.

Actually, Herbert worked with de Laurentis on the movie. And he *liked*

Just goes to show that the author\'s vision may not match yours.

Even if that\'s correct (I won\'t argue the point) there\'s no way to get
the update speed shown over a 300 bps link! And that\'s the best you\'ll
get from that modem. Heck, the cpu in that system would be hard pressed
to update things that fast (though he *could* have a much better cpu,
given that the bus was easily modified to be "standard" IEEE-646)

Octopi sex is odd. (the male and female drop the end of a specialized
tentacle near each other and then they wander off).

Seahorse "pregnancy" is odd. The *males* carry the babies.

Naked mole rat society/biology is *weird*. The "queen" mole rat
secretes a hormone that keeps the other females immature. So they are
an actual case of *mammals* with a "hive" society!

BTW, the simplest way to handle the Aslan sex ratio is to use the same
method that is currently used for "low tech" sex selection in a lot of
countries. Sperm are sensitive to pH. And the sensitivity is linked to
wether they carry an X or Y. So a simple douch will give a 90%
certainty of the sex of the fetus.

There is the notable difference that the "limited" franchise is limited
only by the desire to do *something* for the government for a couple of
years. It\'s *not* limited to *military* service. For a contemporary
example, serving a hitch in the Peace Corps or Postal Service would do
just as well.

I didn\'t notice it being all that authoritarian.

I suggest that you study both history and the book again. There *was*
due process in the book! And the franchise was equally (though
differently) limited in the US for decades. So the taxation without
representation but either applies to *both* or neither.

In case you weren\'t aware of it, it used to be the case that you could
only vote if you owned property or had a profession. And Heinlein not
only knew this, but felt that changing this had been a mistake in that
it removed a "test" of whether or not you were a "responsible citizen".

You obviously haven\'t read some of his essays. Nor the article where he
mentions that he dropped work on Stranger in a Strange Land to write
Starship Troopers because of his worries about the way the country was
going. This was about the same time he founded the Patrick Henry Society.

It was. You failed. :-)

I rather suspect that the "male" script would have started out as
territory markings "carved" with claws into trees on territorial
boundaries.  And later they\'d be chiseled into rocks placed to mark the
boundaries. 

As such, they *would* be straight line. I\'d suggest looking at runes
and celtic ogham for examples of writing designed for similar tools and
materials. Ogham is especially apt, as it\'s not as familiar to most
folks. It consists of a "baseline" with the characters bein formed by
lines running to or through it at 45 or 90 degree angles. This would be
an oghan word (I haven\'t bothered looking up the actual characters, so
it\'s nonsense):

 \\  |   /   \\    |    /                 \\\\   ||
- ----
              \\  |  /     \\   |    /

You get the idea...

The female script would have to be more expressive and contain more
subtleties, as they need to express more complex concepts and have more
variations and shades of meaning.

So I\'d go for something obviously "cursive" or calligraphed. Remember
that cursive styles were developed because they can be written
*faster*. The ultimate development of this line are the various
shorthands. Which are most definitely "cursive" in nature (though *not*
"connected").

Remember, the direction the ship is *moving* (velocity vector) and the
direction it is *pointing* have *no* relation to each other. The
*acceleration* vector* and the direction the ship is pointing match,
but the velocity vector is what determines where the ship will be when
the shot gets there. (I\'ve over-simplified, but the idea is correct
even if the details are a bit different)

There\'s little or no *reason* for a ship to make evasive manuevers that
*aren\'t* at right angles to the line joining him to your ship. Any
vector not perpendicular is wasting delta-V.

No. There were exactly *three* whippings described in the book. One was
a petty criminal of some sort that Juan snuck out to watch as a kid. Or
perhaps he planned to sneak out and then changed his mind. I forget
which.

The secomd was when the idiot recruit got 40 lashes for striking a
superior officer. And under the *military* rules (even now) that\'s a
*capital* offense, they found a way to go easy on him, because they
realized that he was just *stupid* (blurting out the fact that you hit
your superior when he\'s been trying his best to *hide* it is *truly*
stupid). 

Finally, Juan got flogged for endangering his teammates. That was the
bit where they were using simulated weapons during a simulated night
mission and he flipped up his night vision goggles and used naked eyes
to offset a "simulated" nuke. Since if it\'d been real, he\'d have gotten
folks killed, he got nailed.

Sorry, you aim at where the bows *were*.  Thus, if the ship 
accelerates such as to move half its length (the distance you chose 
for \'evasion length\') you hit aft; if not you hit at the bow.  That\'s 
why I think the ship has to move a whole length, not just half the 
length, in order to evade.

Well, there\'s a subtle guessing game going on here between evading 
pilot and attacking gunners, so you can\'t quite just play the 
probabilities but yes, that\'s exactly how I envisage it.

Not _just_ bickering ;-)  But yes, we agree, so let\'s give up and go

Well, call me a pedant, but I fancy working out the physics and then 
seeing what falls out.  I must agree that I\'d greatly prefer the 
submarine style of combat (*much* better roleplaying), all things 
being equal.

Three observations:

1
If your guards split up to search for intruders, use groups of threes so
that when
one is attacked, the second can investigate/defend whilst the third calls for
reinforcements.

2
Learn the real lesson from "The boy who cried wolf" story:
Whilst you might want to give your lookout a long lecture about friend/foe
recognition and timewasting, you still shoot your lieutenant if he doesn\'t
maintain a sub five minute response time just because
"its only another false alarm".
Raising a false alarm yourself and then shooting anyone who turns up late
should get the message accross.

3
Following any of your guidelines would get you thrown out of the guild of evil
overlords. Its part of the deal with the heroes guild that lets you say
"The world will hear from me again", escape certain death and return
hideously disfigured in the sequel.

Think about the movie rights and plastic toy sales :)

No.  I am a Jedi, like my father before me.  (and I don\'t know the address)

I assumed that certain sounds are always produced with ingressive airflow
(perhaps some of the vowels?), and that the language included enough of
them that you\'d not run out of air during a sentance.

Two explanations (take your pick):
1) Untrained English speakers have a very difficult time distinguishing
   the two sounds because one of them doesn\'t exist in English.  The
   difference (to an Aslan) is as clear as the difference between "L" and
   "R" is to an English speaker.  The difference (to an English speaker)
   is about as clear as the difference between "L" and "R" is to a
   Japanese speaker who hasn\'t studied English..
2) I\'m not as familiar with Chinese as I should be, but it seems to me
   that my (southeastern) pronounciation of house begins the same, but
   ends with a slightly different sound.

At least in theory, explanation 1 could apply to any asterisked sound.

UNfortunately, I\'m not _that_ much of a linguist (and neither are most
readers).  "Aztec" is something recognizable to the audience.  But you\'re
correct.

Agreed that there is no necessary correlation.  However, we\'re 
assuming the firing ship can screen out the underlying velocity 
vector and in effect observe the changes due to evasion.  I see your 
point, though.

How about

i) Wanting to reduce ship\'s profile [a long thin ship may be easier 
to hit side-on than end-on]
ii) Wanting to build velocity towards the attacking ship (close the 
range)
iii) Fooling gunners who won\'t believe such a suicidal move

If you have one squadron distributed among all the different worlds in a
system, it takes no time at all to collect them (Well, some hours delay
due to to lightspeed limitations). If you don\'t have enough scouts in a
scout force to reach all worlds within jump there is a week\'s extra delay
as the scout jumps to the nearest base and the base sends out couriers to
all dispersed forces. If the squadron happens to be low on supplies you
will have another week\'s delay as they jump back to the base. That\'s a
_maximum_ delay of two weeks.

And the forces of the interior will contain units that are designated to
reinforce the frontier forces. Plus, the forces of the interior can better
afford to disperse capital units, since alerting them at an outsystem
will not take any longer than alerting them at a main base.

David, aren\'t you the one that is always insisting that people will not
pay for protection against pirates, because the losses won\'t outweigh
the expense? Yet here you are, blithely suggesting that a commercial
ship spends umpteen megacredits on a computer that will only help them
if they are ever attacked by a pirate or a raider? A factor 9fib computer
costs 200 MCr and mass 26 T. That will increase the initial cost of the
ship by 36.4 MCr and the operating cost of the ship by 11.4 MCr per year,
only a tad less the sum total of all other operating expenses for a 600 T
freighter, while at the same time reducing the earning potential of the
ship by more than 500,000 Cr (Assumptions: the 9fib computer replaces a
factor 3 computer in the _original_ design; if you actually have to
replace an original model 3 the cost goes up). And that assumes that the
ship has a big enough power plant to handle the new computer and a couple
of triple laser turrets. The minimum ship that has that is a 600 T jump-3
ship. Smaller ships can just forget it. Even if you do it on the cheap and
\'only\' spring for a model 5 computer the cost is still 45 MCr. Why is it
that this is better than insurance while insurance is better than protection
against pirates?

>(Esp. if the Imperium plans on using him for wartime supply and encourages
>him).

Oh, I see. THe Imperium encourages him. How? By subsidizing the purchase,
I suppose. How is it that the Imperium will cheerfully pay for making
a lot of merchants into indifferent warships with no armor and 1G of
acceleration, but won\'t invest in a far less number of proper warships
that would do the job much better and could, as a free lunch, be useful
in peacetime too?

And btw. if these merchants really did get a kick-ass computer, won\'t that
be really, really bad news for a potential pirate? If he has a cheap ship
then his prospective victims will cream him, and if he has an equally
capable ship, his operating expenses goes way up.

You mean between the high pop worlds, don\'t you? I do hope that we at
least agree that high-population worlds would have defenses of their
own.

It takes months to collect them anyway. Half of the Imperial forces are
raised and maintained at subsector level. That means they are stationed
away from the frontier.

>I consider this unacceptably long, not a short time.

Maybe you do, but that\'s the Traveller universe as it is described. I keep
saying that piracy dosen\'t make sense as it is portrayed in the official
Traveller universe and you keep coming up with other parts of the canon
that dosen\'t make sense if piracy does. Which is actually exactly what
I\'ve been saying all along. If you have to change the Imperial navy from
a two-tier system distributed more or less evenly out across the whole
Imperium to a system where most of the navy sits in a shell around the
frontier, leaving the interior a helpless prey to acquisitive merchants
with deficient moral senses in order for piracy to make sense, then piracy
_dosen\'t_ make sense. I admit that most of the burden of proof is on me, but
you certainly have an obligation to uphold _all_ the canon, not just the
part that fits your ideas. Otherwise you simply prove my point for me.

>The worst case is even worse since, if yoy have your ships dispersed, how do

You just argued (correctly, IMO) that scout forces would be safe from
interception because they don\'t have to go near a planet. Why in the
world do you suddenly feel that a courier has to risk jumping in anywhere
near a risk point?

Come again? You want the marginal systems to have no defenses at all. How
can you possibly argue that not stationing defense forces in these
intermediate systems will protect the merchant shipping against raiders?
I could have sworn I made that very point a few lines lower down...

I was right. I did make that very point...
 
>So instead of loosing traffic to the mains systems

You never lose traffic to the main systems. They have defense anyway,
remember? 99+% of all the defenses, Imperial and local alike.

>and along the main routes,

Make up your mind. Are the main routes defended in peacetime or not? If
they are adequately defended, then they are safe against raiders and
pirates alike. If they are not defended then they are vulnerable to
raiders and pirates alike. Unless they are defended against pirates,
but not raiders. But under no circumstances would they be defended
against raiders but not pirates. That dosen\'t make sense.

>you loose traffic to the marginal systems that only make up 10% of the
>Imperiums population?  Seems like a win to me.

No, by your scheme, instead of losing the traffic to and through 10 or 50
marginal systems, as you would by my scheme, you will lose the traffic to
and through 100 marginal systems (In neither case do you lose the traffic
to the main systems). Seems like a big loss to me.  

>But of course if you disperse your ships, you would loose those ships to.

This is a perfect example of those opinions stated as bald facts we were
talking about. This is only true if you make three unwarranted assumptions:
That it is possible to surprise a ship by jumping into a system close to
it, that achieving surprise will allow you to destroy said ship, and that
any sane raider CO will jump in close enough to have his command wiped out
if a battleship squadron just happens to be passing by.

As for the first assumption, the rules says nothing at all, except that all
fights between spaceships are assumed to begin at long range. As for the
second assumption, the CT combat system makes it very difficult to destroy
an armored ship in one combat round (even an unarmed one stands a good
chance of surviving for a few rounds), which is what a properly designed
jump-capable ship needs to make a jump. As for the third assumption, you
got to be kidding! Even if you use the \'all jump together\' special rule
from MT, you still get your raider squadron arriving over a span of hours.
I\'d just love to be the commodore of a visiting cruiser squadron if a
squadron of destroyers began arriving in drips and draps! Even if you only
have a pair of regular destroyers defending, odds are that they will hurt
the first arrival bad and there is no doubt that they will have warning
enough to get away before the full squadron arrives. A much more likely
scenario is for the raider to jump in some distance from the 100 diameter
limit and gauge the opposition, ready to jump out again if it is too steep.
If not, he will chase away the defenders and spend a funfilled fortnight
destroying incoming merchants. Which is bad, but a lot less bad if it only
happens in 50 or 10 systems than if it happens in 100.

Except that if we play by the Traveller rules in the Traveller universe
(Well, the CT rules and universe -- I don\'t know how the T4 combat rules
works. Unless they are similar to the CT ones), then you will hardly lose
any at all. So if that really is the key as you say...

I\'m sure you are not conciously trying to distort my arguments, David, but
do try to remember that I\'m advocating distributing less than 1% of the
forces out to these marginal systems. Nor am I saying that guard forces
are intended to stop every raiding force at every system; to the contrary,
they would only have to be able to stop 1/Nth of the enemy raiders, where
N are the number of otherwise undefended systems, in order to be worthwhile
for their military value alone.

Assuming they can afford to wait that long. What with all the other
economic problems that pirates have I\'m not sure that a good number of
random patrols won\'t be enough to deter most pirates. Imagine if a
getaway car cost twenty times the average loot from a bank heist and
couldn\'t be easily stolen (and had to refuel every time it hit a new
town). How long do you think it would take the police to track down
a group of professional bank robbers? Or imagine that hijacking a
truck required the use of a tank. How many trucks do you think you
would lose? Or even that pirating an surface ship required a small
destroyer. How many actual one-ship-chase-down-another-and-board-it-in-
the-smoke piracies have there been in the Atlantic lately? When was the
last time a bunch of pirates with a ship the size and worth of its
victim captured a ship in the real world? It\'s all very well to compare
Traveller pirates with bank robbers, hijackers, and even modern day
pirates, but none of those criminals need to invest a fortune in their
basic equipment.

Agreed. You need information on enemy movements. You need information
carrying vessels at _every_ system.

It makes sense to spend the extra few megacreds per vessel to give the
information gathering wessels a few piddling weapons.

If an unarmed patrol ship jumps into a system with hostile forces at
refueling points, then the patrol ship is SOL, DOA and will be reported
MIA.

We\'ve been through this before. I don\'t understand your contradiction.

On the one hand, you say the Imperium won\'t bother with the
disappearance of a few pirated vessels, because compared to the Gross
Production of the Imperium, it\'s peanuts.

On the other hand, you seem to believe that a patrol ships spread evenly
across 1400 or so systems is a vast waste of resources.

I think an average of 3 well armed patrol ships per system is
sufficient. (More on high traffic worlds, less to none on backwater)
Let\'s round that up to 5000 patrol vessels. I don\'t have my books here,
so I\'ll guess at a cost of 60 MCr/vessel. With that much money you can
*maybe* support _one_ large dreadnaught.

The Imperium is known to have _squadrons_ of dreadnaughts. Do you really
believe that one extra dreadnaught would make a significant difference
to the defensive and offensive capability of the Imperium?

I don\'t. I believe the extra patrolling vessels are worth the creds.

We\'ve argued this point before. You obviously disagree. I think that you
*do* have to worry about areas beyond the frontier. It\'s too easy to
sneak deep into enemy territory more quickly than the information about
your movements would travel.

As Hans has argued many times, the forces are not "wasted" since as a
side benefit, they are making trade safer, and therefore more likely;
therefore increasing the economic output of the Imperium.

And what if they happen to be in a place where random patrols are? Do
they have time to avoid the patrols, refuel and jump out?

Random patrols increase the risk for pirates and raiders, thus
decreasing the number of people willing to be pirates and raiders, and
decreasing the number who are successful in those endeavours.

Besides, patrols are "canon" too. Check out the ship encounter charts.

It\'s a pity Heinlein was so misunderstood - He writes a good roming

misunderstands. They stary looking for underlying neo-fascist undertones.

I could comment on the book, but I don\'t remember it well enough to make in
infprmed comment. I DO however, remember it better than somepeople who have
posted some way-off ideas about what happened in it. 

So here\'s a suggestion: If you can\'t remember the book properly, study it
before talking about it. Reading endless uninformed debate and the
corrections posted by those who CAN remember (but whose opinions I do not
necessarily agree with) is boring me. Can we talk about Traveller now,
please?

Here\'s a question for the gearheads among us:
Suppose I wanted to mess up the stellar magnetohydrodynamics of a system
(ie do bad things to stellar fusion), what element would I need to
introduce into a typical G-type star to cause a change in the fusion
reaction? Could I induce a mini-nova or vast planet-cleansing solar flare
by this method?

What sort of damage in Traveller terms might a large solar flare cause, and
what are the accompanying radiation effects?

If we assume that space combat will be about 100 000 km as the lightlag
calcs imply (ballpark figures here Nick, your assumtions made the ranges
even further out). How can we know the location of the ship when (1) We
cannot integrate (signal) for very long as this will add to our lightlag
and (2) We cannot resolve the ship very well (head calc of 5000 angstrom
min resolution with 10 m dish is 5 m at 100 000 km).

Could this (especially (2)) help us out a bit in our quest to reduce 100%
hit ranges? Perhaps Bruce Macintosh could give us a hand here?

Also, it is clearly in context for what Heinlien was trying to do when he
wrote the book.  From the comments in \'Grumbles from the Grave\' it seemed
that he fully intended to get fired from writing the Juvinile novels.  He
came up with a society that would offend the \'New York\' sensibilities of
his editor at the time.  It is quite interesting that it managed to
accomplish what he set out to do: He was fired and he never wrote another
juvinile novel.
The Hugo was just a bonus prise.

OB trav: Is there any cannon alean race which have been molded by the
Aracnids of SST the Book?

This may be useful to you both - IIRC it\'s mentioned in canon that the IIN
adopted a \'thin crust\' \'strategy post Fourth Frontier War, with the heavy
elements grouped well back from the front. The ships deployed were lighter
and intended to slow down and identify the route of invaders. The IIN was
deployed defensively, trading space for the ability to identify and focus
where to best apply the forces. So the front line ships dispersed around
will be destroyers and other pickets, plus couriers.

Verhoeven grew up in Holland during WW2 - the look-and-feel of ST is based on 
his experiences, along with wartime propaganda films.

And I notice nobody is complaining about the Nazi-style uniforms in Star 
Wars.

This is not necessarily true, folks...if we can come up with a good
screenplay, someone will probably take an interest in it.  Independants make
great movies all the time, on shoestring budgets.  I realize this is an
exercise in humor, but there is no reason why a Traveller-based movie is not
doable.

Anyone out there know how to write?  I have tried numerous short stories, but
my writing style is too technical, I\'m much better at writing procedures
manuals than fiction unfortunately.  There is literally 21 years of
background out there just waiting for someone to take pen (or keyboard) in
hand...

Other population "B" worlds (reformatted to DGP standard):

DAGUDASHAAG

DELPHI

MASSILIA
Shig          0510 B362BAB-8    Hi                404 ?? G2 V

These seven worlds have a total population of 3.5 trillion, an average
tech level per capita of 9.8 (for whatever that\'s worth).  The two in 
Delphi are only about seven parsecs apart, all are potentially
spacefaring, and both Gishgi and Khakakir should be able to build
starships.  Shaniin/Corridor and Sabaagiirar/Delphi are the two most
populous, at around 800 billion each.  The two worlds in Delphi alone
account for 1.3 trillion of that sector\'s population.

There\'s also a fair number of Gov code "F" (Totalitarian Oligarchy)
worlds listed in the data.

My high school History teacher was was suspended for 2 weeks in 1986 for
saying in class that, in his opinion, if Adolf Hitler had died of a heart
attack in late 1937 or early 1938, he would be remembered as one of the
worlds greatest leaders.  I suppose if you can look at it from that angle, it
has at least a kernal of truth.  Germany HAD gone from a devastated,
defeated, bankrupt nation to very probably the world\'s first superpower in an
astonishingly short time.  It was the dark twisted side of Hitler\'s
personality that caused all the suffering.

The system envisioned in ST was a bit more authoritarian than we in the US
are used too...but nowhere is there even a hint that any race or minority is
in anyway persecuted.  And lets face it...the only reason our system is not
more restrictive is that it is too inefficient to work that way.   We may not
ever get anything done, but it also makes it very hard to achieve the kind of
control some people seem to fear.

Also (to stave off any misconceptions people may have about what I have said)
 I DO NOT in any way, shape or form condone the horrific brutality and
depravity of the Nazi regime...but they did have cool uniforms!  My (somewhat
convoluted) point is simply that authority is not necessarily a bad thing.  I
imagine the rules of my parents when I was a teen would make a classic case
study for a fascist system, but I think I am a better individual for having
had all those restrictions placed on me.

Anyway...just my random thoughts (and I truly hope no one was offended by
anything controversial I may have said)

Which, of course, works in a perfect world.  However, it would seem to me
that the people who need the vote the most are the disenfranchised who
_didn\'t_ own land or have a profession.  That is to say, it was keeping the
power out of the hands of the people, which in turn would serve to keep them
from earning that right anyway.

Which is where I guess my politics and worldview is incompatible with
Heinlein\'s (and, ObTrav also where it is incompatible with the background
government of the Traveller universe).

A television show that used to be (still is???) on the Comedy Central
network in the US. It features a man and his two puppet-robot companions
who are forced to sit through bad movies (most sf/fantasy/horror, although
I remember one biker flick) ostensibly as part of an experiment.

It basically consists of a showing of said bad movie, with the three
silhouetted at the bottom of the screen as though they are sitting in a
theater in front of you, making a (usually humorous) running commentary on
the film.

Although I agree with your worldview, I must disagree with your ObTrav.

It seems to me that in Traveller, those with authority are nobles, with
land and possessions. Those who are not noble, or have no part of the
Imperial bureacracy have no say in how the Imperium is governed.

What is the definition of a citizen in the Traveller Universe?

I guess as a starting point, it is any citizen of a member world of the
Imperium. The way each world defines citizenship can vary, but at least
some worlds may use Heinlein\'s definition offered in SST. OTOH, some
very democratic governments are member worlds also, and they may grant
"citizenship" rights to every sophont.

In fact, it could very well be that if you join an Imperial Career
(Navy, Scout, Marines, etc.) that that entitles you to become a citizen
of the Imperium, regardless of your homeworld\'s political status w.r.t.
the Imperium.

For example, if you come from a non-imperial client state and join the
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, you are granted automatically an
Imperial Citizenship (whatever that means).

So Starship Troopers may be a closer model of the Imperium than you
think!

Things for discussion:

1. What power does the Imperium have? (How much power? Power over what?)
2. Who really wields power, in day-to-day operations of the Imperium?
Nobles? Military? Bureaucracy? Corporate interests?
3. What is the definition of a "Citizen of the Imperium"?
4. What rights and responsibilities does Imperial Citizenship entail?
5. What rights and responsibilities do member world governments have?

Some of this stuff has been touched on a bit in the all-encompassing
piracy thread. I\'m mainly interested in how people have interpreted
"canonical" sources, as opposed to how each person handles it in their
own campaign.

What sorts of things are in the Imperial Code of Law? I remember a few,
from canonical sources. No Murder (except Right of Assassination). No
Civilian Nuclear weapons. Mercenary Tickets. Imperial Edict 99 was
another, I think?

Cargo Loader (Walker) TL12

    Designed by Peter Brenton

Summary:
       0.50 displacement ton open-topped open frame; 8.45 tonnes; kCr 137
Chassis:
       7.00 kL open-topped open frame (2 m long x 2 m wide x 3 m
high [2.4 m high when stored]); Structure: 1.45 tonnes of superdense, rated
for 3.0Gs, body
       0.50 cm thick, 8 armour rating (operator\'s station is open and
unprotected)
Performance:
       1.20 MW TL12 Fusion Plus power plant; Fuel: 1.50 L of enriched water
(1.50 kg), 4 hours supply
       Propulsion System: 300 kW legs; Maximum Speed: 19 km/h; Range: 76
km; Agility: +2DM
Crew:
       Crew roster: driver; 1 crew station
       Grav Compensation (2G), Whole vehicle compensated
Communications:
       Subregional Radio (1 W, TL12, SmVcl)
Sensors:
       Active Subregional Optical (200 W, MultArray) Resolution: 0.020 mm
per km of range
Other:
       Safety Features: fire suppression system
       Construction Equipment: two arms can lift 24.0 tonnes


This is the latest version of the ubiquitous cargo loader found on board
every  merchant expected to unload cargo in wilderness areas or  visiting
starports which have a waiting list for use of local unloaders or
equipment. Although the industrial lifting arms can technically lift 24
tonnes, this would unbalance the walking loader unless otherwise affected.
The gravitic compensators are mounted so as to reduce the weight of the
cargo (optimised for standard 4 displacement ton cargo containers) as it is
carried, making lifting capacity theoretically unlimited as long as the
cargo is within the area of the field.

 Capacity is effectively limited to about 20 tonnes due to considerations
of momentum and inertia.  In the event that the grav compensators are not
usable, straight lifting capacity is limited to less than 8 tonnes for
cargos not directly over the feet of the loader.  Note that it requires an
experienced operator to effectively use the gravitic operation of this
vehicle.  During operation the effective weight of the cargo is reduced,
not eliminated, so that the loader will behave in a fashion more consistent
with the inertia of the cargo carried (greater weight=3Dgreater surface
friction).

 The arms are mounted to allow them to slide into standard lifting points
on either side of the end of a cargo container, and are shaped to fit
between two containers even when stored at their closest.

=46ootprint is as small as possible while staying within the 3 meter height
of the smallest cargo bays.  When stored, the loader assumes a "crouching"
inactive position which lowers the height to 2.4 meters.  The vehicle as
delivered is painted with a Yellow and Black "Danger" pattern and is
equipped with a rotating warning light on top of the operators cab.
Options include a vacuum package, an array of attachable tools including an
arc welder, and remote operation electronics and sensors.

In a pinch, this vehicle has been known to be used as a last ditch
self-defense weapon.  There is no armor for the operator, however, and,
although the lifting arms are fully articulated, they are not optimised as
weapons.  This use in not recommended by the manufacturer.

 We can\'t even agree on the canon features (like Piracy) of Traveller - can you
imagine the flame wars that writing a script would generate?!  (Imagine the
discussion that will surround the love interest for the Aslan Ambassador, or did
we just have that...?)   8D

Subject: CD-ROM project


      Okay folks, I\'ve got an early Christmas present for the list on top of
Marc\'s previous one (holding the Alien book back for fixes and T4.1).

       You know that CD-ROM that everyone wants? Well, he\'s given me
permission to try and put one together for I.G. (but don\'t expect it for this
Christmas, if you\'re extremely lucky, maybe, just maybe next Christmas). I\'ve
reviewed the previous CD-ROM want list and I have a pretty good idea of what
I\'d like to see.

      Right now I have a need for a few more volunteers, preferably with
scanners and software that can import into PDF, HTML and text (though
admittedly text is the prime concern so far, but if I can do all three at the
same time I want to try and do that). Of course access to the old material
wouldn\'t hurt either. And maybe someone familiar with PDF and HTML.

      Along with that I wouldn\'t mind having some software to stick on the
CD, useable by either Mac\'s or PC\'s. But I\'d prefer tested software (I have a
fair amount in my archives, some of which have been tested. By testing I mean
testing so it works and that the data it uses is correct. So if I can get a
group of volunteers 
do that that part it would be nice.

       And in regards to the software, I want the best of the best (Rob\'s
Metator and CSC definitely qualify, as does the Galactic software).

     The only payment I can promise for the volunteers is credit and a copy
of the CD. For those donating software I can only promise credit, but I\'ll
see if I can get you a copy (actually I expect I should be able to do it with
no problem).

      Please email me privately in the case of volunteers at
Kagekiha@aol.com.

      For those that might have material scanned in already and want to
volunteer it, I\'m looking for PDF, HTML and text formats.

     Along with that I wouldn\'t mind seeing a discussion of enhancements
modifications that might be made to the UPP.

Aw, come on, the Harkonens were the best thing about that film.  Besides
Sean Young in latex fetishwear, I mean.  It\'s really rare anyone has the
nerve to show grinning, happy, laughing Evil on the screen like that.
Sure, they made you want to crawl under the seat and puke, but they had
VERVE, man!

ObTrav:  The set design and costuming of the movie _Dune_ are, I think,
great inspiration for Milieu Zero and the later Third Imperium.

They weren\'t. The military still needed administrative types,
mechanics, intelligence, etc. Federal service didn\'t mean you were
risking life and limb in combat; just that you had performed service
in the military.

Which was, I meant to say, one of the funniest things I\'ve seen on the list
- -- intentionally funny, I mean.  How about an adaptation of Brecht\'s
_Dreigroschen Oper_?  Mackie can be a pirate... if that\'s possible in the
Third Imperium, I mean.  What do you guys think?

Why NOT, man?  Isn\'t Norris the great war hero and all that, too?

As far as Brian Blessed for the role goes -- I do know who he is, and like
his work fine, but I can _only_ see him as the roaring Cossack/Viking type
- -- not the genteel, charismatic aristocrat.  Pacino might indeed be
preferable to DeNiro, though, on second thought...

Speaking of the Marches -- who would play Admiral Santanocheev?

That\'s also how I do things. However, being an Imperial citizen seems
to be meaningless unless you\'re outside the Imperium, because 
Imperial citizens can\'t vote. I\'m a Canadian citizen and nobody cares
about that except during elections and when I\'m travelling abroad.

So, I don\'t think that the Imperium would place a great deal of 
importance on being a citizen. In fact, they might just keep it simple
and say that only Soc B+ people are citizens.

Thoughts?

I like this idea but I can\'t find a benefit for it. If someone comes
up with a good reason to be an Imperial citizen, then I\'ll probably
institute this.

What kind of power are we talking about? I guess I don\'t understand
the question.

In day-to-day operations it is the nobles. However, the influence that
the corporate types have upon the nobles is great. Many of the nobles
are really puppets being controlled by the megacorporations.

See earlier discussion.

> 4. What rights and responsibilities does Imperial Citizenship entail?

If Imperial citizens get their status from their occupations, then
their rights and responsibilities should be greater than if they
get the status from birth location. Basically, the more effort required
to get a citizenship, the greater the rewards and responsibilities.
So, what I\'m saying is, we need to answer #3 first.

> 5. What rights and responsibilities do member world governments have?

This is easier. They must designate plots of land for starports, 
embassies and possibly fiefdoms. They must allow Imperial ships, 
especially military ones, freedom of passage through their systems.
They must abide by some basic laws. The one that comes to mind is
the "aid ships emitting signal GK or SOS" one but I\'m sure there are
others. Stuff like raiding foreign vessels is out.

Repatriation bonds should be honored. Local military shouldn\'t use
nukes either, if any Imperial property could be affected by it.

The murder one is tricky. In our western culture, murder is illegal,
yet there are distinctions made between murder and justifiable killing.
The line separating the two might be different from one system to 
another.

The power of the Imperium comes from two things. Firstly, a bigger and
meaner navy than any of it\'s member worlds or neighbours, and secondly the
links between the Imperium and the Imperial Megacorporations via the
Imperial Family\'s shareholdings.

>2. Who really wields power, in day-to-day operations of the Imperium?
>Nobles? Military? Bureaucracy? Corporate interests?

The four are often, or indeed usually, linked through family, or the same
people.

I think a close reading of Marc Bloch\'s Feudal Society is useful here - one
of his points that the feudal societies of medieval France were in fact a
number of different but linked societies - the Church, the manors, the
Royal bureaucracy and the towns all had their own, different, power
structures.

Putting that OB Trav, lets look at a subsector, and see who the major
players would be ...

First of all, the IN Fleet Admiral and her staff. She is a person everybody
stays nice to, both for obvious reasons and because the IN spends a lot of
credits on various things.

Secondly, various families who control the private corporate interests in
the subsector. These interests will often or usually be allied to one of
the Imperium-wide megacorps, and provide local knowledge and resources to
them.

Thirdly, the local Megacorp reps. Megacorps would probably have different
managerial structures and styles - do all LSP reps report to one Subsector
Manager, or do the Mining people report to the Mining Division, the
Industrial people report to Industrial Division etc ?

Fourthly, the Imperial Ministry of Justice rep, if just becasue Imperial
Audits, if not common, are exteremly uncomfortable things - unlimited,
open-ended Imperial Warrants and all that.

Fifthly, the heads of government in the important worlds. These may or may
not be the same people as in group two. I am reminded of one of Harry
Truman\'s letters, where he was trying to sort out a Democratic party
internal fight in New York - he suggested a meeting between the people
concerned, and the head of Tammany Hall (the Democratic party HQ in New
York City). He didnt who the current Tammany boss was, but he knew they had
to be invited :)

Sixthly, the local Imperial nobility. Again, these will often be the same
people as the above groups - I dont know about you, but the Duke of Whatsit
sounds like a good choice to hire as a Reserve Fleet Commander. These
people may or may now own Imperial Starports in fief from the Emperor -
personally, I\'d tend away from this model, because you want to encourage
interstellar trade, not tax it. IMO starports are paid for as a line-item
out of Planetary Taxes, which are levied as a percentage of GWP, as per MoJ
schedules and as verified by Imperial Audits.

Finally, any local Imperium-wide celebrities. I am thinking of a case where
you have someone equivalent to Gabriel Garcia Marquez on a world - even if
they arent important, if people on Capital (especially Imperial Family-type
people) read what they write, then being nice to them and respecting their
views is a good idea (after all, you dont want to get star billing as the
bad guy in their next novel slash thinly described commentary on Corruption
in the Frontier, do you ?).
 
>3. What is the definition of a "Citizen of the Imperium"?

Legally, Citizen of the Imperium isnt a particularily operative concept.
The base unit of the Imperium is the memeber world, not the individual
citizen.

>4. What rights and responsibilities does Imperial Citizenship entail?

See above.

>5. What rights and responsibilities do member world governments have?

You get a vote at the Moot. You have to co-operate with Imperial authority,
and pay your taxes. Oh yeah, and enforce the edicts against piracy, slavery
and civilian-owned nukes. And dont think the IN likes you having Nukes
either. After all, we know where those bastards get nukes and MilSpec
weapons off - yeah, corrupt planetary officials. After all, the difference
between a Planetary Navy Commodore and a beer is there are starport bars
where you cant buy a beer.

Where did you look this up? It\'s not in the T4 rulebook in any case
(although the law levels B+ are desribed as increasingly more controlled
variants of A).

Are there more government descriptions and law level descriptions where you
got this stuff? I think I could use it (appearantly First survey uses these
codes).

Does this count

The Platypus Frog that has the young growing in the stomach and has the
gastric juices "turned off" for that period.

The females Kangaroo\'s can have a joey in the pouch and be pregnant with
the next one and control the growth of the foetus , so in droughts she
can totally stop the growth till things improve.

The Echidna (Spiny Ant Eater) and Platypus are mammals that lay eggs and
raise the young on milk.   The Echidna has a pouch in which the young is
raised while the Platypus\'s young are raised in a burrow.

   I\'m not so sure that this explains any difference between your
   worldview and Heinlein\'s.  One of the points to the Service in ST
   which made it very different from our property requirements was that
   it was unappealing to the establishment. Remember that Rico\'s father,
   a successful businessman, was against Rico\'s joining the service.
   After all, if you `wasted\' two years of your life serving people, then
   you lost two years of earning potential, or college potential, or
   party potential, or whatever.
   
   So the service requirement was a bigger disincentive to the
   establishment than to the underclass (who have less to lose by
   service), and tended to emphasize the underclass in the electorate.
   The very people who, you say, need the vote the most got it the most.
   It was mentioned in the book in several places that the franchise and
   material success did not go hand-in-hand; if anything, the franchise
   was associated with poverty. Remember Rico\'s poor, underpaid, Moral
   Philosophy teacher?
   
   Also note that non-franchise holders were still citizens, in the same
   sense that non-voters (minors) in our society are still citizens.
   Minors have the same protection under the law that voters have, the
   rights to free speech under the law, and the same rights to due
   process.  The fact that their earnings get taxed though they cannot
   vote does not make us fascists. 
   
   You mentioned in your statement `an ideal world,\' which is a very
   relevant notion to any discussion of ST.  Was Heinlein promoting the
   form of government he portrayed in his book?  Probably not. It entails
   too many practical difficulties.  Was it fascist?  Certainly not.
   Unworkable maybe, but not fascist.
   
   Someone compared Rico to an idealistic SS man in Nazi Germany.  There
   are no similarities between the two.  Rico was more like a full-time
   volunteer for Americorps, the Peace Corps, a foreign mission, or an
   inner-city school, someone who puts his life on hold in order to help
   his society. (Granted the service he wound up in was flashier than any
   of those things.  He was in an adventure story after all.)  He wanted
   first to serve, and second to gain the franchise.
   
   The SS were attracted to the ideals of power, glamor, reputation, and
   being in the in-group.  /Helping/ their country was just the icing
   that let them strut self-righteously; /showing off/ their country was
   what they were really about.  Germans who wanted to help their country
   in WWII joined the regular armed forces, worked for peanuts in the
   factories or, very rarely, resisted the government.  They did not
   squander their talents on the SS.

The show is currently on the Sci-Fi Channel and now mainly does only
"sci-fi" shows.  IMO it\'s not as good as when Joel and Dr. Forrester
were on, but it has improved from a year or so ago.  However almost all
of the Comedy Central episodes are unavailable (a few are on vhs) as
Comedy Central no longer shows their episodes and the Sci-Fi Channel can
only air the new episodes made for the Sci-Fi Channel.  The offical
MST3K on the Sci-Fi Channel site is at:

Trying to find what movie/book/etc. that the jokes come from is part of
the fun.  If you haven\'t seen the show yet, by all means find someone
who has an episode on tape or catch it on TV.  There is a MST3K: The
Movie as well (now on videotape), which although it has Mike (who
replaced the original Joel as the human part of the experiment) and the
bots, is quite funny. (the movie is This Island Earth)

I\'m not sure you understand the fundamental difference in the ST society:
*Anyone*, regardless of background, wealth, race, intelligence, or any
other factor, could obtain the franchise simply by performing public
service for two years.  *Nobody* obtained the franchise in any other way.
This removes the power-concentrating, haves-and-have-nots effect of the
old property-based franchise.

In my view, this is an entirely reasonable idea; what it says, in effect,
is that only those willing to contribute voluntarily to the good of
society get a say in how society is run.

ObTrav:  I would suggest that many worlds in the Imperium practice the
same form of government, of course with endless variations.  Democracy,
the various bureaucracies, balkanization, and perhaps other forms of
government can all exist using this form of franchise qualification.

Also, the Imperium itself operates in somewhat the same way with respect
to its member worlds.  In order to obtain the benefits of membership in
the Imperium, each world accepts various responsibilities (tax collection,
provision of basing facilities if needed, cooperation in enforcing
Imperial law, presumably participation in a central-banking scheme, and so
forth).

In my mind, what ST and several other Heinlein works are \'about\' is the
balance between freedom and responsibility, an inextricable pair.  In
Heinlein\'s view (as I understand it), and in mine, modern US society is
characterized by freedom being emphasized at the expense of
responsibility.  ST is (in part) an attempt to show a society where
responsibility is more prominent.

	I couldn\'t decide if this was real or not. But, what the heck!

	In order to use the string to signal you apply (I presume) a little
	"tension" to the string (you stretch it). You then apply a vibration 
	to the string in order that the "tension" in the string be propogated 
	to the next system (you send a sinusoidal wave through the string to
	the next system. Not bad!

	But the wave can\'t move faster than the speed of light (in order to 
	do so, some real piece of string must move faster than light which
	will not happen), so the wave will move at less than light speed to 
	the new system. If it is 1 parsec away, then your signal should arrive
	in something more than 3 years.

	On the other hand, the more I think about it, the better I like it.

	Think of all that string, strung (as it were) throughout the Imperium.
	Oh, what a tangled web we weave . . . 

	A project for the gearheads might be a calculation of the mass of string
	required for what I suppose we\'d have to call a complete communications 
	net. I really like this!

aspects of the book).  This way, it\'ll be clear what I\'m saying and this
thread won\'t turn into a classic net.exercise of us launching all-out
nuclear assaults on the wrong positions only to find out nobody was at home

	Essentially, I think that the political system in ST, although not
strictly fascist, is strongly authoritarian (by my social deomcratic
libertarian <grin> standards anyhow), and is arguably an inferior one to
current Western democracy on several grounds.

	That being said...

	Limited franchise (in the loosest sense; having some access or the
potential for access to political power), involving various forms of public
service, is common to many totalitarian regimes.  The Nazis weren\'t all SS
or SA; they also had any number of auxiliary organizations; labour corps,
youth groups, academics, and so forth.  They were pretty big on service to
the Volk.  Ditto the Chinese Communist Party.  IMHO, this is pretty
suspect.  Two or more years of living in a total institution (recall those
"last free choice for the next two years" lines, presumably undergoing a
fair bit of indoctrination, before getting access to the franchise, ought
to iron out the troublemakers...  especially as those gaining access have a
vested interest in maintaining the system as a universal franchise would
dilute their voting power.

	Of sorts.  Not, IMHO, as I, a legally trained individual, would
understand it.  Nazi Germany, after all, having inherited a long and strong
civil law tradition, had a court system, with a complete set of procedural
rules...  but what that process produced was not justice as you or I would
understand it.  It takes more than a pretty courtroom and a code of
procedure to produce justice; what\'s being enforced must be just to begin
with.  It\'s easy to design a legal system that presents the appearance of
due process but whose substantive law is sufficient to have the accused
practically condemned before he steps into the courthouse.

	Remember that the justice system in ST grew out of vigilante
justice imposed by mobs of returned veterans lacking duly constituted legal
authority, and that it operates in a system where civil rights are held in
low regard... viz. Col. Dubois\'s speech about the drowning man in the
Pacific Ocean.

	Which brings me to Heinlein\'s concept of rights, or at least the
concept of rights that Dubois exposes; it\'s fundamentally mistaken and
completely fallacious.  It\'s the equivalent of trying to analyse a social
situation using electromagnetism as a paradigm.

	Rights are a purely social and legal phenomenon; of course they
cannot be invoked against oceans and so forth.  They\'re only claims upon
the behaviour of one\'s fellow citizens, matched by corresponding duties on
their part.  Of course I can\'t invoke my property rights as a tornado blows
my pickup across the county line... but I can invoke them against a car
thief and press charges and sue him for damages.  Rights are social
protection; for protection against twisters I build a storm cellar.
Heinlein had Dubois set up a straw man.

	Of course, being social and legal constructs, unless you\'re a
natural law theorist, rights don\'t exist outside a given legal system.
Being a positivist, I think that human rights are entirely legal creations,
brought into existence by the various Bills, Declarations, and Charters
that frame them.  I do not believe in any natural law underpinning human
law that gives rights some nebulous existence outside the frameworks of the
legal systems in which they operate.

	However, I think that the concept of rights is one of the most
significant  intellectual developments in human history; I don\'t think it\'s
a coincidence that the most successful, advanced, and prosperous societies
in human history subscribe to it.  And I think that aside from the various
liberal (in the classic sense, not the debased sense current in U.S.
political slang) arguments for human rights being pragmatically useful, I
think that they\'re morally speaking essential for any society that wishes
to call itself just.  If nothing else, the most heinous regimes in history
have held human rights in low regard.

	Unfortunately, we don\'t know whether the Terran Federation has a
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  However, given Col. Dubois\' speech on
rights, I suspect that they are not held in high regard.  As well (and bear
in mind that the US is AFAIK the only western democracy still to use the
death penalty), the TF justice system\'s use of capital punishment is not a
telling point in its favour; it shows a great deal of disregard for _the_
fundamental human right.

	So either Heinlein was fundamentally ignorant of what rights were
(which I have a hard time believing), or he was setting up a vision of
rights that a freshman philosophy student could blow clean out of the
water.  I think that he was doing the latter, in the expectation that the
more discerning reader would twig to what he was doing.

	Both it is then.  Remember, democracy as we know it did not spring
into existence in its current form... it\'s evolved.  A notable example is
the extension of the franchise to women.  Please don\'t think that I\'m
setting up Western civilization\'s concept of democracy as perfect; I think
we\'ve got a ways to go yet before we get it right.

	Ye gods!  I am appalled.  Frankly, RAH couldn\'t have thought that
one through.  What about the case of the ditzy, debauched, no-good lush
who\'s never worked a day in his life who inherits a vast estate from his
father?  How is he more deserving than a skilled, hard-working tradesman
who unfortunately doesn\'t own enough land to qualify for the franchise?
Didn\'t he realize that depriving the poor of political clout (even if it\'s
purely symbolic) is what\'s led to every single major revolution that I can
think of?

	Which brings me to the irrationality of the franchise system in ST.
Apparently, two years of shovelling dirt in Antarctica will get you the
franchise.  However, Johnny Rico\'s father, a businessman whose activity
provides employment for a large number of people, whose disposable income
provides support for many other individuals in various sectors, and whose
business therefore must provide goods or services that society finds
extremely valuable, cannot vote.

	The only justification provided for this is that the labour
battalion veteran has, well, signed up for Federal service and shovelled
some dirt, thereby putting his life, or at least his big toes, on the line
in order to provide holes in the ground in Antarctica (or something) for
his society.  However, IMHO, Rico Sr.\'s contribution to society is hands
down much greater.  So basically, the limitation on the franchise appears
to be ideological or political, since it\'s not exactly rational... which,
again, smacks of fascism.

	Actually, now that you mention it, I do recall reading some of
them, in Past Through The Future (?).  I found some of them howlingly
funny, although I suspect that he was dead serious...  However, the
recollection I kept was that he was something of a U.S. patriot, if
somehwat more libertarian than the norm.


>> This is why I think that it was a sort of critical

>
>It was. You failed. :-)


	Really..?  I suppose I should explain my "critical thinking test"
comment:  The political system in ST is dressed up in a ripping good SF
yarn calculated to appeal to an audience of impressionable young males,
especially those steeped in U.S. culture, and presented in the voice of a
very sympathetic narrator, written so that said audience can easily
identify with him, whose character is deeply committed to the preservation
of said system.  He makes ringing appeals to laudable values, such as
defending humanity, the admirable valour of those bearing arms in defense
of their own, etc.

	However, the political system in question is also, IMHO as I\'ve
outlined above, contra some of the basic principles the U.S. was built
around... and Heinlein was pretty darn attached to the U.S. IIRC.  And did
I mention the TF\'s origins in gangs of armed veterans bearing a remarkable
resemblance to the post WWI German Freikorps?

	Basically, I have a hard time believing that Heinlein was serious
about the system described in ST.  Rico\'s narrative is just begging to have
us read between the lines, and I think that that is what Heinlein was
hoping the audience would do (I could be reading too much into his
motivations here, though).  I suspect (although I could be wrong) that he
deliberately wrote the book as he did so that the more discerning readers
would pick up on the problems with the political system it describes
(either on reading or as adults), and realize how the great story, appeals
to valour and responsibility, and so forth, were really masking a pretty
nasty political system that was somewhat at odds with the values of the
society they\'d grown up in.

	The experience, would, therefore lead to severe honing of the
reader\'s bullshit detection faculties, and, also, lead the reader to
re-examine the values that he believed in himself...  thereby promoting a
certain amount of free thinking, which, I think, RAH valued.

	I\'ve always wondered what he thought of the fans who took H&MP so
seriously...

	I\'m not certain that I disagree with you; on the other hand,
	why would you say that those who didn\'t own land or have a 
	profession have any greater \'need\' for the vote than anyone 
	else might have.

	And when you say that power is being kept \'out of the hands of the

	have that power; or that those who don\'t presently have it, have some 
	\'greater\' intrinsic right to hold power than those who do now have

	I can\'t dispute your claims since I\'m not certain of what you

It\'s true that sensors don\'t really resolve targets; a fire-control lock
in the new sensor rules typically means a resolution of 100m or so (with a 
accuracy in measuring the position of that blurry blob to 1m), so you don\'t
actually know which way the target is facing unless you have a very high 
signal sensor lock.

Cleon declared in 17 that "any sentient life form residing in the Third
Imperium is a citizen, and therefore granted all rights and privileges."

(Something close-- don\'t have those sources available right now.)

Some may deny that a large percentage of their population are anything but
animals.. but that\'s the benefit of Imperial citizenship.

Not according to canon.

From what Cleon said, You\'d have to establish residency, and declare your
intent.  Joining the Scouts would be a good way to do both.

The Imperium rules the space between the planets.  The boils down to
control of interstellar diplomacy, the military, and the very lucrative trade.

>2. Who really wields power, in day-to-day operations of the Imperium?

The Subsector Dukes.  Low enough to exert effective control over the short
term, big enough to control immense resources.  As I discovered while
research Army logistics, each Subsector is so unique that large scale
planning beyond that level really becomes a matter of throwing money to the
lower levels who really know what they need.

See above.  There are probably a few provisions about convicted High Felons

The right to protection from all threats enforced by the Imperial Military.
 The right to trade and move freely between worlds.  The biggest

The same right of protection.  Imperial arbitration in disputes between
member states.  Aid in the form of grants and material improvements.  The
main obligation remains as it has been for millennia:  money and troops.
Member worlds pay taxes, and raise units for the Army and local defense.

Which of course works in a perfect world.  However, it would seem to me that
the people who would otherwise be disenfranchised (who are unable to learn a 
profession or accumulate any real property) would be most likely to vote 
without becoming informed on the issues, but based on feel-good advertisement 
and short-term gratification.  

That is to say, it\'s the masses who are unable to look beyond tonight\'s meal 
that are most likely to vote bread and circuses for themselves via amoral 
populist politicians, to the detriment of good governance and statesmanship.


Playing Devil\'s Advocate here - both sides of this argument have a point;
IMHO neither side is completely correct.  However, it\'s likely that the
Founding Fathers of the US would be more likely to concur with restricting
the franchise.  

It\'s worth noting that less than half of the eligable voters in the US value 
their franchise enough to use it in national elections; even fewer bother to 
vote in local elections (where one vote has a proportionately greater 
effect), and fewer still bother to become educated on the issues involved 
before making their decision.

It seems to me that one of Heinlien\'s main points - that the majority of
current-day enfranchised US citizens don\'t value that franchise highly 
enough - is probably true.


ObTraveller: In my personal Traveller games, the only Imperial Citizens are:
- - Those who have recieved an honorable discharge after at least one full
  term of service in the Imperial Army, Navy, Marines, Scouts, or Imperial 
  Bureaucracy.
- - Those or who have attended the Imperial Merchant Marine Academy and 
  both successfully served at least one term after graduating, and
  succeeded in the re-enlistment throw.
- - Imperial Nobility (eg: nobles who participate in the governance of the
  Imperium) and their immediate families.
- - Imperial Knights.
- - Limited-Liability Imperial Corporations.
- - Other individuals who have applied for and been granted citizenship in
  the Imperium (this is relatively rare; you basically have to show how
  granting you citizenship would benefit the Imperium).

Citizenship is a fairly powerful right in my version of the Imperium;
citizens may call on the Emperor\'s Justice and the Emperor\'s Protection.

Emperor\'s Justice: Citizens cannot be extradited to a planet\'s legal system, 
instead they are tried by the Imperial justice system (which defines a 
relatively few, serious crimes).  At least in theory, the most serious
punishment a member world can levy against a citizen is banishment from
the planet.  

The upshot of this is that (for example), an Imperial Citizen who runs afoul 
of the Psyadi monkeys would get tried in an Imperial court (where this is 
not a crime, unless Psyadi\'s representative can show some sort of economic 
damage to the environment); the Citizen may never be able to return to 
Psyadi, but is otherwise scot-free (as opposed to the non-Citizen from Lanth, 
who would be executed on Psyadi for the same crime).

Even for a serious crime recognized by the Imperial justice system (such as 
murder), the change of venue means that Imperial rules of evidence are in
use, and the court may (hopefully) be more sympathetic to the travelers\'
side of the story.

Emperor\'s Protection: Citizens have, at least in theory, the right to
petition the Imperial government for protection from internal and
external threats to persons or property (for example, piracy or invasions).
The local Imperial officials (generally the nobility and/or Navy higher
echelons) decide on the response, which may range from a letter with a polite 
but firm \'no\' to an Imperial cruiser squadron.

Yep. The *second* scariest thing in the world is a "villian" who really

The scariest is one who is not only smarter, but better informed and
more knowledgable.

Slight problem. The "tug" propogates from one end to the other at the

After practicing a bit, I think I see a difference. Mao is more "nasal".

    'body' => 'Glenn, sent out a interesting request. Here\'s a starting response that I\'ve
used for my universe. I hope that this will help the discussion some. I\'m
happy to
amplify any specific section for you.

Things for discussion:

1. What power does the Imperium have? (How much power? Power over what?)
The Imperium (as opposed to an Empire) possesses military power over all
activities, persons, locations, and entities within the boundries of the
Imperium.
This translated into physical forces applied to elements and interests
contrary to the wishes of the Imperium. How much power - well, think on
this:most military persons that I know and have met think that the last
thing
that they ever wish to do is to fight but given a situ requiring fighting
then
they want to get it over with asap. The Imperium has a mandate over all
military
activities within the Emperium and the frontiers thereof.
The Imperium\'s power is over all activities and persons travelling through
the space surrounding the planets and systems which comprise the Imperium.

2. Who really wields power, in day-to-day operations of the Imperium?
Nobles? Military? Bureaucracy? Corporate interests?
The power in the Imperium is wielded by the Emperor/Empress. This
individual is the absolute ruler of the Imperium. However, since this one
individual
is responsible for the continued well being of the entire Imperium, my
concept
(or perhaps conceit) is that the Emperor relatively rarely excercises the
full degree of the absolute power inherent within the office of the
Emperor.
The day to day operations of the Imperium are supervised and run by all 
of the above. Yes, nobles, military, bureaucritters, corporates et al all
have different ways of administring this massive entity. I have always
thought
that the Imperial Moot/Senate advised the Emperor and that a selected
number
persons responsible to the Emperor would either supervise the various
departments of the Imperium. (I\'ll happily supply a chart of the various
ministries, bureaus, etc upon request/ er.. demand), administer various 
territories or engage in special pletipotiary mission as needed.


3. What is the definition of a "Citizen of the Imperium"?
4. What rights and responsibilities does Imperial Citizenship entail?
I would like to answer these two as one. Here is a short chart that I
use for my players to explain the way I use citizenship within the
Imperium.
Classes of persons in the Empire.
Type			Description				Number
Emperor		Ruler of the Empire			1
			Prefect of the Emperial Senate
Imperials		Members of the Ruling House		29,374
			Senior Nobles (Viceroys, Archdukes, Princes etc)
Imperial Citizen		Members of the Empire with the		1.35 per 2,000,000 Imp
Clients
			right to vote in Imperial Referrendums
			Also, Senatorials, Field Grade Officers, Governors, 
			Senior Bureaucrats, etc
			Successfull retirement from Imperial service usually grants this as a
			bonus.Must be a citizen to be Eligible for Senatorial Status
			These are the elites of the empire and these are the ones who usually
			take the brunt of the obligations to run the Imperium. It\'s principally 
			hereditary (not nobility but citizenship) However, at age 18 these folk
			must volunteer for some sort of Imperial Service. They may not be
			selected but they must volunteer. It could also be age 22 or 26 after
			college and grad school. This may also be granted as a pre-req to 
			specific postings or job assignments.
Imperial Clients		Normal Citizens of the Empire
			Any intelligent sophont, born within the confines of the Imperium and
			not having committed any crime greater than a misdemenor within the
bounds
			of the Imperium may claim this status upon the equivelant age of 18
			years. At which time they become subject to the Imperial draft - this
rarely
			occurs but they are then liable for forced imperial service for the next
20 years.
			They receieve for this the right to live within the Imperium, the right
			of limited taxation (citizen\'s can only be taxed to a specific degree
excepting 			in time of emergency), and the right to live.
Other Persons		Beings living and working within the Empire who are not of
			the Empire.
			Limited rights.

5. What rights and responsibilities do member world governments have?
They have the job of running their worlds/systems within the Imperium
without signficantly interfering with the Imperium and not breaking the
principal
laws of the Imperium. 
Here are the laws that I use.
Remember that all Imperial personnel (naval, scout, armed forces and
imperial officers) 
must take a variety of oaths of service. 
All oaths must include the following 5 laws of the Empire.
I.	There shall be no greater soverign power in space than the Empire.
II.	Violence will not be permitted in Imperial Space.
III.	No nuclear, Fusion or Biological weapons are permitted without
	Imperial License.
IV.	Technological levels shall be maintained and proscribed technologies
	shall not be distributed without license.
V.	The rights, priviliges, and duties of imperial citizens and clients
	shall not be abrogated without right.
Imperial Space is considered to be in my universe anything outside of the
boundries of any system, or any area designated as non-imperial space
within the
frontiers of the Imperium, any planet, system, reserve, or preserve held by
the Imperial
Service or the Ruling House that is not the responsibility of a member
world, or system.
The job of  the member governors or governemts is to rule with little
disruption. And
to pay their taxes.

Pretty simple, Hey. A little draconian perhaps, but I my universe the
Imperium is the 
"good guys" well sort of.

Well, I\'ve sent out enough.
Please let me know what you think of my ramblings.
Thanks
Pat

Standard trick for dealing with someone with a watchdog. Keep
"triggerring" the watchdog. Eventually, the owner will lock him up,
just so he can get some sleep. *Then* you attack.

I\'ve always viewed Imperial Citizenship (at least in the early Imperium) as
being rather like Roman citizenship.  Being a Roman citizen gave you a _lot_
of rights over the locals, in any aea Rome controlled.  The extension of
citizenship to both individuals (such as auxiliaries) and people (such as
allies) was a powerful political weapon, until there were more citizens than
non-citizens, at which time one emperor (forget who) granted citizenship to
all residents of the empire, eliminating the distinction.

I see Milieu 0 as a time when citizens of the former Sylean Federation are
Imperial citizens, as are all members of the Imperial military (with
honourable discharges after 20 years service).  Citizenship is also granted
to all nobility (of course) and to distinguished locals (usually the
leadership to keep them happy).  

What are the most important rights of a citizen (as opposed to a resident)?

1) Right to trial by an Imperial court (judge or noble with right of
justice).  Local laws are not as applicable.  

2) Exemption from many taxes, especially duties.  Both a subtle edge to
Imperials, and an incentive to serve the empire for 20 years.

These will make more difference on the Frontier.  After all, in the Core most
people are citizens.

  Below is the list of stories in Poul Anderson\'s Psychotechnic League
Timeline.
  My apparently mistaken impression was that "The Pugilist" was part
of the this cycle. It could almost fit, certainly.
  Also, when I dug up the books from storage I discovered that the list
does not include "The Horn of Time" which I was pretty certain was
part of this timeline based on similar technological
assumptions to "The Peregrine". Wrong again, it seems.

  Another collection of Anderson\'s work ("Conflict", published in \'83)
is the most recent appearance of "The Pugilist" that I am aware of.


The Psychotechnic League Cycle of Poul Anderson

(derived from the back of "Starship", volume 3 of the collected
Psychotechnic League stories.)

Volume I: "The Psychotechnic League"
  (published in 1981; covers timeline 1964-2051)
   -"Marius"
   -"The Un-Man"
   -"The Sensitive Man"
   -"The Big Rain"

Volume II: "Cold Victory"
  (published in 1982; covers timeline 2055-2270)
   -"Quixote and the Windmill"
   -"The Troublemakers"
   -"Holmgang"
   -"Cold Victory"
   -"What Shall It Profit?"
   -"Brake"

short story "The Snows of Ganymede" (timeline 2220)

Volume III: "Starship"
  (published in 1982; covers timeline 2300-4000+)
   -Gypsy
   -Star Ship
   -Virgin Planet
   -Teucan
   -The Pirate
   -The Chapter Ends

Book "The Peregrine" (aka "Star Ways"; timeline 3120)
short story "The Acolytes" (timeline 3000)
short story "The Green Thumb" (timeline 3000)


  These stories, written between 1950 and 1968, comprise the first
long-reaching future-history timeline that Poul Anderson created. He
eventually abandoned it to take up two new sets of stories that
became the core of the Terran Empire Timeline. These stories centered
around the most colorful characters of the two eras, who are well
known to most Traveller players: David Falkayn and Nicholas van Rijn
were the center of the Polesotechnic League stories, while the much
later Terran Empire stories centered around the infamous Dominic Flandry,
a man who spent his life fighting against a phenomena well-known to
Traveller: The Long Night.

Funny, it didn\'t work that way. "The people" *got* the right to vote.
And in the process, we repealed the section of the Constitution that
forbade any taxes other than "head" taxes (ie taxes were every *person*
paid the same amount), and added things like property taxes, which make
it *impossible* to stay on your farm and mind your own business. You
*have* to come up with hard cash or lose your property.

And since things like the right to keep and bear arms *did* apply to
everyone, the people who *could* vote had a vested interest in making
sure that the rest of the population stayed reasonably happy.

The only way the *un*enfranchised (dis-enfranchised refers to people
who have had the vote *taken away*, not those who never had it) will be
denied a chance to earn the right is if the enfranchised deliberately
keep them from being able to earn the money to buy property, or the
ability to *learn* a profession. Neither was true in the US.

History shows what happens when you give "the people" power. Athens,
several Italian city-states, The French and Russian revolutions, etc,
etc.

Voters who haven\'t learned to consider the results of their actions are
the death of *any* society. Ditto for "nobles" in an aristocracy.
Whoever makes the decisions *must* consider the consequences of those
decisions. Both to themselves and society.

	Exactly. In fact, you didn\'t GET an option--you committed to Federal
Service, listed what you\'d LIKE to do, and then the FS looked at your
aptitudes, skills, and what was needed, and TOLD you what you would be
doing. And they couldn\'t reject you, as long as you could understand the
oath--if you volunteered for Federal Service, you were given an opportunity
to serve. In the book, the example was a blind paraplegic.

following questions:

1)  The modifiers for beefed up Focal Arrays...do we use the ROFs from FF&S1
(i.e. 1-800) or the ones listed (which only run to 240, based on T4 pg 117
stating space combat turns are 10 min)

2)  Damage Modifier:  Pg 52 of FF&S2 states a damage modifier is calculated
if the diameter of the tunnel is less than 1/8 of the length...then under the
listing for Effective range, the formula reads "Actual Eff Range= Theoretical
Eff Range x Range Modifier"  What is this Range Modifier...is it the Damage
Mod?

3)  Turrets vs. Bays:  I know the canonical definition of Turrets Vs
Bays...but do they apply anymore?  Since non-standardized weapons are
becoming the norm...what\'s to say a weapon isn\'t a very large turret?  This
may seem like nit-picking, but if I read SSDS right, then bays are counted as
a seperate battery for each one...limiting the number of weapons in the
battery (and hence the damage rating).  Whereas turrets can have up to 10
linked in a single battery (and get a very high damage rating:  10*30=300,
which is a rating of 8 w/out ROF mods)  but bays are limited to the damage
the DE gives them.

If anyone has any insight on any of these points, I\'d greatly appreciate
hearing it!

	I\'d be more concerned about the elasticity. Sure, take a 1 light-year
string. Tug on it. What\'s going to happen is that the portion of the string
you\'re holding will move toward you. That portion will pull the next
portion, and the next portion, and the next portion. The far end of the
string certainly won\'t move at the same time as the near end--you\'ve got to
propagate the force down the length of the string.

	The only substance that could conceivable work would have infinite
rigidity. In which case it would make perfect armor ... if you could work
it.

	What about the deep-sea fish where, when the male finally finds a female,
he basically implants his body into hers... eventually everything but the
gonads wither away (since the chances of a female ever meeting another male
aren\'t that great, she just "hangs on" to him).

	Gee, now we can start an argument on the TML about capital punishment!
What fun! Perhaps we can drown out the piracy discussion...

	OK, maybe not. But I tend to disagree with this paragraph. The fact that
the US is the only "western democracy" applying the death penalty says
nothing either way about whether it\'s wrong or right. Just because
everybody disagrees with you doesn\'t make you wrong. Nor does it make you
right. It\'s irrelevant.

	As for the death penalty showing disregard for "_the_ fundamental human
right" I thought you were arguing that there is no such thing as rights
outside a legal framework? As for disregard for this "right"--perhaps it\'s
actually UPHOLDING this right _if applied only to respond to other
violations of this right_.  Because otherwise you\'re saying that the
murderer\'s human right to live outweighs the victim\'s right to live, _which
that murderer has abrogated._

	\'Course, my problem with the death penalty comes in with the way it\'s
actually applied, rather than the theoretical underpinnings.

In my humble experience, those who state (responsibility with rights) =
(fascism) are those who have never bothered to do any sort of public service.

The tug would propagate at the speed of sound (in the string) which can go
as high as close to lightspeed if sufficiently dense/compressed material is
used.

One layman explanation for when a neutron star stops being a neutron star
and becomes a black hole is that when the density is so high that the speed
of sound would exceed the speed of light it will collapse ie the matter
cannot react to pushes fast enough and thus collapse.

I fear that for the kind of Special FX we would want that movie to have,
it will polly have a very high pricetag, even with loads of B5-style
CGI-effects, too high for most indies. So it has to be one of the big

	I\'d argue that rights and freedoms are bounded by the
responsibility not to infringe upon the rights of others.  Rights and
freedoms _are_ by definition responsibilities, since everyone has them and
by their very nature they must be respected.  I cannot exercise my right to
bear arms at the neighbours because it\'ll damage their property and put
their risk at life.

	In a free society, everyone is titulary of the same rights and
freedoms.   These rights and freedoms are, not surprisingly, calculated to
protect and maximize the worth and dignity of the individual human being
and, secondarily, enhance the functioning of society.  When a bunch of
individuals exercises them together in a common legal framework, itself a
democratically created one stemming from said rights, a just society
results.  Transgressions upon others\' rights and freedoms, either against
specific individuals or against the general population are met with civil
and criminal sanctions.

	Rights and freedoms _are_ by definition responsibilities.  Citizens
exercise responsibility for the smooth functioning of society every day by
not exercising their rights in abusive fashion.  As a member of the same
free society as, say, Glenn, I am responsible for ensuring that my actions
do not infringe upon his rights and freedoms.  And vice versa.

	Only when I violate that responsibility can my rights be infringed
or limited, as a sanction.  If I napalm Glenn\'s lawn, he can sue me
(depriving me of my property rights over the sum  of money required to
repair the damage to his property) or have me thrown in jail (have me
deprived of my right to liberty as a sanction for my reckless endangerment
of others\' safety and property rights).

	IMHO, a political system that systematically limits the rights of a
section of its population on ideological grounds, especially political
rights such as the right to vote, is, while not necessarily being
classically fascist, going to produce an unjust society.  It doesn\'t matter
whether the individuals being denied rights are being denied rights because
they are Blacks, Jews, non-Party members or they haven\'t done a stint of
Federal Service, it is still IMHO wrong.

	Try reading the Bill of Rights, and ask yourself whether Heinlein\'s
justifications for cutting back on that document make any real-world sense.

	And now, I\'m going to go over my outline one last time for my exam
this afternoon...  wish me luck.

	Well, I\'d say that the fact that the U.S. is the only one of the
sample population of democracies to use the death penalty semi-regularly is
statistically significant.  The thing to do is then see whether it produces
the desired effect.

	And that\'s where the flamewar begins as the infinite recursive
fractal cycle of "yes-but"-ing begins :).

	Nope.  I\'m just saying that _generally_, human rights in Western
society are concieved in such a way (i.e. framed in legislation) that the
taking of life is heavily sanctioned and only justified in a few
circumstances such as war or self-defence.  Generally speaking, the
"grundnorms", or basic moral beliefs expressed in the legal frameworks in
question, hold that life is the basic right.  This tends to get expressed
in constitutions: the U.S. Bill of Rights, IIRC, has something to say about
"Life, liberty, and happiness" right at the beginning.

	The death penalty debate in your country AFAIK has significant
constitutional-interpretation overtones.  IIRC, at one point the U.S.
Supreme Court decided that capital punishment was unconstitutional, and it
took a certain amount of political padding of the bench to get a
sufficiently right-wing court to later overturn that ruling...  So,
basically, IIRC, what U.S. death penalty proponents are saying is that yes,
life is a fundamental right, but that your constitution allows it to be
overridden.

	This, as I\'ve pointed out, is a pretty unique position :).


>	\'Course, my problem with the death penalty comes in with the way it\'s
>actually applied, rather than the theoretical underpinnings.


	My problem with it is that it\'s insufficient punishment.  IMHO,
rotting away behind bars for the rest of my life expectancy would be sheer
hell.  I\'d take thirty seconds in the chair or hanging over that at the
drop of a hat rather than spend my life deprived of my freedom to walk
round to the corner store to buy my morning paper (or to do whatever else I
felt like within reason) while being surrounded by assorted scumbageous
criminals.

	Of course, the prison in question has to be sufficiently
unpleasant.  Spending the rest of my life locked into a Club Med would be
somewhat more bearable than being locked into Kingston Pen...

	Which is where Paul Bernardo (raped a bunch of women, raped and
murdered his teenage sister-in-law, kidnapped, raped, and murdered two
other young women) is going to be spending the rest of his life.  After
sentencing, the Crown succeeded in having him declared a dangerous
offender.  In Canadian criminal law, this means that in practice he likely
will never, ever be released.  And, given what he did, he has to be kept in
a special unit, isolated from the rest of the prison population, so that
they won\'t scrag him.

	Personally, and YMMV, death would be better than that.

	Which reminds me of this idea my classmates and I cooked up one
evening over a few too many beers...  Just build a very large cinderblock
warehouse way hellandgone up on Baffin Island.  Provide it with basic
heating.  Put in basic food preparation facilities, provide the inmates
with basic indoor clothing, and install exercise bicycles in case they get
bored or the heating isn\'t warm enough for them.  Do not put any bars on
the windows or locks on the doors.

	Put up polar bear feeding stations in a 60-kilometer radius around
the building.  Move them weekly.

	And now I really am going to go study :).

Thereis *nothing* that you could introduce that\'d have a noticeable
effect unless you\'ve got several earth masses of it. And since fusion
*only* occurs in the *core* of the star, you\'d have to gety it to the
core. Otherwise you have to wait somewhere between years and
*centuries* for it to work its way to the core.

Novas require white dwarf stars or maybe neutron stars. Solar flares
are *surface* phenomena. There may be ways to induce them, but that
requires more knowledge of stellar dynamics than I\'ve got.

> What sort of damage in Traveller terms might a large solar flare cause, and

Kiss any electronics in space goodbye, except for optical stuff (-fib
computers, for example). For that matter kiss any*one* in space goodbye
unless they are behind *heavy* shielding. Consider a big flare to be
much like catching the edge of a *big* Particle beam.

On airless planets, anything not *well* dug-in fares like stuff in
space. Probably ditto for very thin atmospheres, except that you\'d get
to see what an aurora looks like from *inside*. Thin atmospheres should
provide some shielding, but unless you\'ve also got a strong planetary
magnetic field, you\'re still toast. And being near the magnetic poles
is bad news.

If there are wide scale power transmission lines, and a planetary
magnetic field then you\'ll get *massive* EMP effects (bad flares have
done it on earth).

How far does a ship "travel" in jumpspace??

When a ship jumps, it leaves one part of normal space and a week later
arrives in another part of normal space. In the interim the ship is
"travelling" in another space.
If one considers that jumpspace is another continuum where the distance is
shorter than in real space, just how far is that distance?

Does the ship move at all in this other continuum, or can one enter this
space and ultimately exit in a different place without moving in jumpspace?

Does jumping involve the warping of real space between the two endpoints to
make the distance travelled zero, and the operation takes a week to take
effect?

Does jumpspace outside/beside/within real space and the ship moves within
this otherness?

Any ideas???

Is there a canon definition on what is going on in this other space?

Nope. It\'s *clearly* stated that there were 100% *non*-military jobs.
Juan mentioned that if he didn\'t make the military, he wasn\'t
*interested* in what other job they found him.

So all the government clerks and the like are doing federal service,
and maybe even things like highway crews. Y\'know, there could even be
an advantage to bureaucrats not being able to vote until *after* they
no longer held the job... :-)

Oh? I\'m curious. *Where* did you see legal proceedings *other* than
military courts? The military courts ran pretty much the way military
courts do now.

But from various references, *I* didn\'t get the impression that civil
law was all that different than what we are used to. The *punishments*
tended to be somewhat different.

And in doing so, show that rights *are* a social phenomenon. That\'s
*why* he was against calling them "inalienable". Because since they
only exist by benefit of society\'s "whims", they *can* be talen away
by society.

Again, that was the whole *point* of Col. DuBois\' lecture. Rights
*don\'t* exist in a vacuum. If you want "rights" thenm you\'d better be
prepared to make sure that your society grants them.

So contary to what you got out of it, I think they held rights in
*high* esteem. But they also recognized that they are *not* some sort
of magical thing granted by some god.

And I suspect, based on the same speech, that they *are*. But that
since they are recognized as a social artifact, they are considered to
*follow* as a consequence of the *responsibilities* of the individual
towards other individuals. That is, rather than thinking of "freedom of
speech" as a right, they\'d think of the *responsibility of not
"censoring" other people\'s views.

This shift of viewpoint would (IMNSHO) prevent a lot of the situations
we see where folks are claiming "rights", but are actually trying to
*deny* rights to others.

And note the sort of crimes it\'s reserved for. Ones where it\'s quite
clear that the criminal has no regard for the lives of others. Also, I
got the impression that an execution a *year* would be considered a
*high* rate for a "state" sized area.

Or, as I point out, you missed the whole point. He was arguing for a
view much like yours, but by forcing you to throw out the "natural law"
view.

BTW, I disagree with you about the "natural law" bit to some extent.
I think that "metalaw" is working towards a "non-arbitrary" set of
rules/rights. In fact, I may update my old file on the subjject and
post it, as it\'d be a good basis for Imperial law, especially the parts
that deal with non-humans (as that\'s what it started out as.... an
attempt to deduce rules that could be applied equally to humans and
aliens).

Excuse me. You are apparently under the impression that this country is
a democracy. It is turning into one, but it most definitely was *not*
set up as one. True democracies have a *worse* record than autocracies!

If the lazy no good doesn\'t learn responsibility, how long will it be
before some con man takes that estate away from him? 

And I\'m not (and i don\'t think Heinlein was either) claiming that it
was perfect. Just that it was an attempt at eliminating some of the
irresponsible from the voter pool while not eliminating too many
responsible types.

Remember, thanks to the secxond amendment (when it was honored) any
voters stupid enough to do something that really pissed off the
non-voters *would* wind up on the short end of a revolution.

And it also helps to remember that it *used* to be the case that the
"rich" and well off took care of the poor (at least the responsible
ones did) rather than filtering the aid thru a government bureaucracy.

No, it\'s based on whether or not you are willing to put forth some
effort for society, with *no* benefit other than the vote. What Rico,
Sr did benefited society, but only as a *side effect* of benefitting
himself. To get the vote you have to *reverse* the relationship. Do
something that (in theory anyway) benefits society and only
incidentally benefits you.

It could be argued that the test selects for *altruism*.

I think his purpose was much simpler. He proposed a *very* alternate
system and shook up a lot of preconceptions. I don\'t think he thought
the society would work either. But he *was* pointing out things like
the idea that a society can, and pergaps *should* consider not handing
out the vote to every warm body over a certain age.

Again, re-read his essays.

BTW, for what it\'s worth, if *I* was going to redesign society, given
the way Heinlein (I Starship Troopers, Moon is a Harsh Mistress, and
eve Stranger in a Strange Land) made me think things over, I\'d consider
two changes. One is "easy", the other is hard, but eminently worth
doing if an *objective* test could be found.

1. Regardless of whether you are native or immigrant, you have to take
   the *same* citizenship test. It *really* bugs me when the majority
   of voters aren\'t familiar with the Bill of Rights, much less have a
   grasp of the basic ideas in the constitution (worst case was the folks
   who were screaming when the courts found a initiative to be
   unconstitutional. They didn\'t know that one of the main *purposes*
   of the Constitution is to say that there are things that government
   may *not* do!)

2. Some sort of "maturity" test. This needs to be *objective*. If you
   can\'t pass it, I don\'t care *how* old you are. You don\'t drive, you
   don\'t vote, etc. And if you pass it, I don\'t care if you are a
   bright, well read 8-year old.

But then, like Heinlein, I\'m frequently accused of being an elitist.
And it\'s true. I *do* believe that some people are better than others.

Quite true.  It was also entered into the Canon fairly late in the game
(mid-to-late MT era, I believe).  It certainly wasn\'t in the Canon when I
began forming my own conception of the Traveller Imperium, so I\'ve been
conveniently ignoring it ever since.

Does this mean my campaign universe has been \'grandfathered\'?
And I\'ve never run _Secret of the Ancients_.

Fair enough but how much integration is assumed here (how many seconds) if
you\'re on signal threshold for lockon? This integration time should be
added to the sensor+beam lightlag times 1 for position, times 2 for
velocity and times 3 for acceleration measurement.

Sorry, but it is according to canon (Tarsus), in the Boxed module it\'s
stated that "honourable service in the Imperial forces" gives you
citizenship.

Also from M:0 "Warrent of restoration - Article I, Para 4":
"The Imperium considers citizens any living recognised sentient creature
native to or naturalised by a member world of the Imperium, or any living
sentient creature swearing fealty to the Imperium directly. No immunity,
protection, right, or privilege granted by the Imperium to a citizen of
the Imperium may be abridged or denied by any member world."

Reading this, if you\'re born on a member world you\'re a citizen; if you\'re
naturalised by a *local* government you\'re a citizen; and if you swear
fealty (take the Emperor\'s credit), you\'re a citizen.

In 17 Cleon declared exctly what a "sentient creature" was. I believe the
precise reference is in the MT referees sourcebook (of which my copy is
on loan to a friend), but it goes something like
"any biological intelligent creature". It\'s framed to prevent robots from
being citzens. It\'s refered to in M:0 as "Cleon\'s Pro-sentient speach"

The trouble with this model is that it contradicts the Imperium\'s
hands-off
policy (at least In My Universe) towards local government. I always
pictured
the Imperium as, with few exceptions, ruling the space between the
stars.
Local governments control their own systems, except for starports,
embassies
and cases where they\'re not fit to do so (because of interdictions, low
Tech Levels, balkanization, etc).

So it doesn\'t make sense to have Imperial citizens\' rights take
precedence 
over locals\' rights.

Again, that violates the hands-off policy. Unless my interpretation of
that
policy is wrong? I forsee a situation where the player group can say to
a
local policemen "that silly law you locals have about not drinking in
public
doesn\'t apply to us because we\'re Imperial citizens". A few of those
incidents
would begin to infuriate the local populace.

Think of what happens when diplomatic immunity is used by criminals to
get
around charges of rape, assault and other serious crimes.

So where is the incentive for a world to voluntarily join the Imperium?
Sure they get great military protection but they have to give up all
those
juicy taxes because everyone paying those taxes will immediately attempt
to
become Imperial citizens.

Agreed. The culture of the Imperium and of the local world will be more 
intermixed in the center of the Imperium, so the concept of local
culture will
not be as relevant.

It appears to me (and correct me if I\'m wrong) that, in order to there
to be
significant benefits to being an Imperial citizen, the Imperium must
give up
its hands-off policy and meddle much more in local affairs.

Publisher IBR Productions, Hemmingen, Germany
ISBN 3-89505-001-6
Cost 250 DM (+30DM postage and packing to UK)

A while ago, one of the German Traveller Mailing List members drew my
attention to the existance of this book, and recommended it. Physically, it
is very impressive - 35mm thick x 270mm deep x 210mm wide, it is hardbound,
covered in a black mock leather, with the kind of ribbon page marker that
you associate with large reference books. It is very definately a quality
item.

However, it\'s the contents that interested me more. For a while I\'ve owned
both the DGP Alien  Modules, and had started to hanker after the CT
Modules. This book contains all eight alien modules and \'alien realms\' (the
scenarios book) published by GDW. In addition, it contains the draft
material \'Aliens for Traveller\', an 8 page document originally from GenCon
1981. The alien modules retain their original numbering, and are separated
by colour plates of the original covers. A few pieces of artwork have not
translated well (particularly those with greys on them) but everything is
useable, and the whole book is very tidy.

Those of you who want to know more about the modules are recommended to
look up Tim Collinson\'s \'The Traveller Bibliography\' which has entries on
them all (and is available from BITS).

Would I recommend the book? Well, it depends.

- - Yes, if you don\'t own the original modules and want them (the cost of the
book was approx =A3115 inc. p&p when I bought it) in a nice, well made format
that should last for a long time. The material is usable with T4
(especially if you are willing to tweak the rules a little and increase
skills handed out).

- - Yes, if you really want a limited edition (200 total) signed by Marc Miller.

- - No, if you already own the Alien modules....

The book was purchased through Fantasy En\'Counter in Germany
http://www.mag-net.de/FANEN/index.html ; when I ordered they could only
accept Mastercard or International Money Orders, so I suggest you email
Holger Willert (address at the website) for more details first.

IMHO, outside your ship\'s jump bubble, normal physics don\'t apply:
Asking about the distance a ship travels through jumpspace is a lot
like asking about the color of time, or chocolate-flavored sine waves.

Since there is no current knowledge of what induces solar flares, other
than that it has something to do with the suns magnetic field, I quess
this would be up to the referee, but it should involve one heck of a

I\'d add Flyers, Sailors and Diplomats. I\'m not sure about Doctors.
However, in the MT/CT rules (the only ones I\'m familiar with) you
can\'t get a dishonourable discharge. So, basically, once you\'re in
one of those careers, you\'re a citizen.

I wouldn\'t use this one. The MT Merchant career is totally in the
private sector and thus wouldn\'t qualify.

This is the peerage. No?

Yes, whether hereditary or not. If someone is awarded a knightship

qualify.

Yes, for tax reasons. Although, why restrict it to limited liability
corporations? Why not say that any corporation qualifies which is 
headquartered in the Imperium and has Imperial citizens as a majority of 
its controlling officers?

Your concern is justified, judging from the type of traffic I\'ve
seen on this list over the last couple of years.

Let me begin by complimenting you on an excellent post. While not
relevant to Traveller per se, it was well thought out and well
written. I\'m thinking that I might insert it into the ST book.

I am one of those disaffected people to whom the politics described 
in ST appealed. Your points made me sit back and think (a painful 
process this early in the morning) and I thank you for it.

While I tire of the incessant comparisons with the evil Nazi regime that
get brought up all too often in the media today, your point about 
"undergoing a fair bit of indoctrination" is a good one. 

A society can be thought of as a living organism. The primary function
of any organism is to survive. A society survives by ensuring that those
elements which make it a society take precedence over those that don\'t.
In this situation, it is in the interests of society to ensure that the 
people with power think the same way.

This can be good and bad. Limiting the power to change society to 
those people least likely to do it will ensure that the society
survives relatively unchanged. It also means that the society doesn\'t
progress.

The advantage to limiting who can change society (read: vote) is that
it ensures a static environment where everybody knows their rules and
duties. The advantage to making the vote universal is that it ensures
that the society will be a constantly evolving organism. Whether or not
societal change is a good thing is open to debate. 

I think that\'s the crux of the matter here. Do we want society to
change?

> 

Yes, it does. I\'ve already touched on limited franchise, so I\'ll cover
capital punishment and corporal punishment now.

Whether or not capital punishment is a good thing depends on the goal
you are trying to achieve. I\'m not going to wade into the argument over
this contentious issue now. I\'m just suggesting that a person examines
what they hope capital punishment will get society and judge its
worth based on that. Personally, I favor it because it meets the goal
I have for it.

ST\'s use of corporal punishment is effective not because it is 
physical and painful but because it is humiliating. Flogging a thief
causes some short term pain (and possibly long term scars) but may
not deter that person from stealing again. Publicly flogging a thief, 
where the audience consists of people the thief knows and lives around,
accomplishes two things.

First, it brands that person as a thief to the public. For quite some
time afterward, the relationship between the thief and the public
will be significantly different. The thief will be in a sort of 
exile. I suspect that this secondary punishment will have much more
lasting (and, hopefully, deterrent) effects than the initial pain.

Second, the mental anguish caused by public humiliation is a more
effective punishment than what the physical pain causes. It is this
aspect of the punishment, not the pain itself, that constitutes the
reason for the flogging in the first place.

I suspect that if one were to look at the crime rates, especially
recidivist crimes, of countries that use public corporal punishment
(Saudi Arabia comes to mind) compared to crime rates of those that
don\'t (Canada and the U.S.), one would find that the ST punishment
system works.

Or, have held human rights in low regard compared to other rights, like
the
rights of the government and other social institutions. Every society
has
some concept of human rights; where those rights rank on the totem pole
of priorities is part of what defines a society.

While I agree that the concept of human rights is one of the most
significant developments we\'ve ever done, I\'m not sure you can 
claim that the most successful, advanced and prosperous societies
subscribe to it. You _seem_ (correct me if I\'m wrong) to be saying that
those societies placed human rights at the top, or near the top, of
the totem pole.

I point to the ancient Eyptians, the Romans and the Greeks, whose
ideas of human rights pertained only to a select few members of society,
as examples of successful societies which didn\'t have human rights
high up on the list. Also, look at the Mongol hordes and the Japanese
empire of old.

Our modern society is less than seven hundred (in the case of
Europe and Britain) years old. That\'s hardly long enough to call us
successful.

I agree with you. I\'m not sure that we\'ll ever get it right. Political 
systems are (to paraphrase George Lucas) like movies: they\'re never
finished, they\'re just abandoned. Or, to use a software development

Good examples.

The act of depriving the poor of political clout hasn\'t caused any
revolutions of which I\'m aware. What\'s caused revolutions is the
gaining of a different kind of power by the poor, one which the
leaders of society cannot control. For example, the invention of
the printing press in Europe gave rise to dramatically increased
literacy among the poor, which made them powerful thinkers, which
led them to question their current form of government.

It was no act of deprivation that caused the French Revolution; it
was the growing discontent of the working class once their education
had increased to the point where they could question their environment.

Heinlein\'s society pretty much assumes that the non-enfranchised
are content with things the way they are. If that situation changes,
then the ST society will collapse.

Yes, because in ST, the values of society take precedence over the 
values of the individual. The fact that Rico\'s father provides 
income for others is irrelevant, since the number of people he supports
is small. It\'s what he\'s done for society as a whole that counts, even
if
the gesture is only symbolic (like shovelling dirt).

Rico\'s dad\'s contribution is greater from our point of view. We live
in a society that values individuals (and their rights) over society
(and its rights). So we tend to look at things from that focus.

Picture us living in the ST society. We are told that individual rights
take precedence over societal needs. We are given several examples where
people successfully get laws changed because of perceived infractions on
their rights. We would shake our heads in astonishment because such
notions
would be totally foreign to us.

Don\'t take anything here personally. I\'m not advocating the ST society
or
our own. Each has strengths and weaknesses. Whether one is better than
the
other depends, to a great deal, on what one expects a society to
achieve.

Distance doesn\'t have much meaning in jumpspace.

Strange as it may seem, the ship is moving yet isn\'t while in jumpspace.
See below for my explanation.

Here\'s my latest view of jumpspace. (influenced by MM\'s recent post)
YMMV

Jumpspace is an alternate tachyon universe, the speed of light is the
_lower_ limit. A ship surrounded by its jumpspace bubble, acts as a
tachyon. It travels at infinite velocity in jumpspace.

Therefore, if you were to draw a line in realspace between the source
point A and destination B, it could exist at all points along the line
at once. Since it exists simultaneously at A and B, it isn\'t really
travelling. A large intervening gravity well can disrupt this line,
forcing the ship to precipitate out of jumpspace at that point.

Note that the ship doesn\'t actually travel along that realspace line, it
exists only in Jumpspace. There is a one-to-one mapping of realspace to
jumpspace, with one notable exception: areas experiencing significant
tidal forces.

These high-gravity areas create "voids" in jumpspace, causing two
effects:

1. A ship cannot precipitate out of jumpspace into an area roughly 100
dia. from a Terra density world.

2. If a ship tries to enter jumpspace within this distance, it becomes
impossible to predict exactly where the ship enters jumpspace. (ie. at
what point along the void\'s boundry the ship enters jumpspace)

Effect 2. is the source of many misjumps, as the ship\'s "vector" may
veer wildly off course.

Tsk tsk -- and you\'re about to take a bar exam?? :)  (Yeah, yeah, I know,
not your country...)  The phrase "Life, liberty, and *the pursuit of*
happiness" (my emphasis)  appears in the Preamble to the Declaration of
Independence -- a document which predates the USA by 13 years, and has no
legal status whatsoever. 

The US Constitution (including its amendments) contains nothing about the
"right to life."  The Constitution is more of a meta-law than a law in the
traditional sense; it describes how the process of creating, executing,
and reviewing ordinary laws works, who may vote in elections, who may hold
elected office, and so forth.  Only in a few cases (e.g., setting up an
intellectual property framework) does it descend into the realm of
ordinary law.

Most of the amendments to the Constitution have been clarifications of
what fields are open to regulation by ordinary law.  For example, the
First Amendment forbids ordinary laws from abridging free speech, the
Fifth from compelling self-incriminating testimony, and so forth.  Most of
the rest have been revisions in the government\'s operating procedures
(e.g., changing the voting age, or removing gender-based exclusion from
voting rights).  Only a few amendments have descended into the realm of
ordinary law (e.g., Prohibition and its repeal), and these are generally
regarded to be a bad idea by most Constitutional theorists.

Not true.  This is an Eight Amendment issue, centering around the question
of whether execution is a "cruel and unusual" punishment.  In other words,
any other punishment that possibly violated the "cruel and unusual" 
criterion (e.g. public whipping a la ST) would be subject to exactly the
same sort of judicial review.  Death is not singled out as a special case.

It would be, if it were true. :)

  I remeber reading a really nifty article about a society that didn\'t have
taxes.
They had lot\'s of lotteries instead.  Buying tickets daily was a sign of
good citizenship.  Folks wore their tickets to show their support.  If you
didn\'t have several upto date tickets around your neck, you wouldn\'t get
very far in trying to get anything done.

Any bozo can make a sci-fi film with oodles of special effects and computer

I actually do not think it does.  If this status is possessed by few
people, and had certain special considerations, then it could be quite
manageable, and a source of a lot of role playing tension.

Or where the Imperium feels bold enough to take control.  For their own
survival, they cannot do it often, but I suspect there is something in
there about being able to nationalize damn near anything, if war demanded it.

Do note, though, that the Warrant of Restoration explicitly prevents a

rights and privileges better either be high profile and acceptable, or low
profile.

This is why the Imperium would choose to not hear the case in most
instances.  If you are drinking on a Moslem world, they may well just let
you hang.  On the other hand, they may not, and I suspect there are very
fine gradations.  I suspect also that your drinking might be punished far
less by the Marines than the locals, but if you piss off the local police,
and the Base Commander decides that it was inappropriate, he will likely
deal with you harshly - not for drinking, but for damaging the relationship
between the Imperium and a valued client state.

For what it is worth, I am using the policy that active duty military are
always tried only by courts-martial, who may choose to punish them by
turning them over to the local justice system for an egregious crime, but
will usually restrict themselves to standard punishments for breaking the
Military Code.  Part of that code does involve not damaging diplomatic
relations.  Former military with an honorable discharge keep the same
privilege, but its strength is reduced, as the JAG does not look at itself
as your personal problem solver, but does not want valued crew being
flattened by bizarre local customs.

Nobles also are a separate class.  These are the equivalents of the foreign
diplomats, and with the military, are like Roman citizens.  There are
roughly 1.2 nobles per million people in the Imperium, according to my
current economic rules.  This makes the numbers small enough to manage, but
big enough to be visible.  They stay an aristocracy, and they get
appropriate privilege.

>Think of what happens when diplomatic immunity is used by criminals to
>get around charges of rape, assault and other serious crimes.

This is, indeed, why the Imperial courts leave military personnel to their
internal JAG, and why they only really deal with nobles.  Further, the
Imperium does not appreciate being called in when crimes happen, so they
are going to expect the noble to look after themselves.  On the other hand,
those nobles represent real power, and they are not going to let a foolish
local law harm on of the movers and shakers.  This balance is fine, and one
the MoJ is used to.

Most of them might try, but most will fail.  Consider that nobles are one
in a million, and most of those are nonhereditary knighthoods.  Further,
the Imperium does need that many people in either the Fleet or the Marines.
 As a result, they can usually get the best.

Consider also that most of the bennies that accrue to the ex marine or
Fleet person are less important than those that accrue to nobility.  Having
military pensions tax free, and various boosts to living conditions will
not hurt the local planet that much, and often acts as a technology
transfer mechanism.

I have never interpreted the hands off policy as strictly as you do, and my
system seems to work for me, so I would say that you are right.  It does
not take much weakening of the policy, though, to have the kind of citizen
than Rob was discussing be reasonable.  If you assume that this is the
position of the noble and the soldier, and that the noble position is the
only on which is allowed to do random rapine and pillage, it is feasible.

Well, I don\'t agree that every dispersed ship will be within one
jump of it\'s destination (meaning that is there is a more than
the two week delay you invoke).  I also don\'t think you are going
to be able to have all these forces jump blind to the front and
start action, you are going to have collect them up an make
sure they aren\'t jumping into system that have already
been taken or doing other things that don\'t make sense.
That mean that dispersing the forces that are raised and
based at the subsector level _is_ a reduction in readyness.
I also think that the logistics of all this is going to
be a big distraction in the crucial early days of the war
(and we haven\'t gotten to how you are supporting all these
ships in systems without any bases)

[and if I was looking at what didn\'t make sense I would say
that the background problem lies more in  scattering half your
forces to all those backwater areas rather than piracy
exisiting.]

However, I simply don\'t have time to go into the kind of
detail you are getting into, so that I will have to
say that I find it hard to believe that you can take
ships and disperse them to every world in the Imperium
without significantly affecting piracy (After all,
we could use military personell based in the US
to guard banks without changing the time it takes
them to travel to Europe, or whever, but it would
reduce readiness) and be content with that.

Regarding armed merchants contributing to convoy defense.
>David, aren\'t you the one that is always insisting that people will not
>pay for protection against pirates, because the losses won\'t outweigh
>the expense?

No, I\'m saying _some_ people wouldn\'t.  Others will be in the
job of collecting particularly valuable, sensitive, etc. goods
or are designated for transporation of war goods.  As to them
being "indiffernt warships", if you have a convoy with, say,
10 merchants for each naval vessel the "indiferent" ability
they have can well make a difference in a battle.

>And btw. if these merchants really did get a kick-ass computer, won\'t that
>be really, really bad news for a potential pirate?

So he doesn\'t attack those ships.

>you keep coming up with other parts of the canon
>that dosen\'t make sense if piracy does.

Well, no I don\'t.  Canon doesn\'t have military ships dispersed
to _every_ system in the Imperium (there would need to be
a base in every system, if not on every world).  Nor do I
think the one thing I have disagreed with (dispersing to
the subsector level) means that piracy won\'t exist.
I do think it\'s dumb, but even if it did make piracy
impossible, rather than saying piracy should be dropped
from the background (leaving the other problems in place)
it would be better to fix the problem with deployment.

Because the ship jumping in doesn\'t know where the enemy is and
will be out of fuel to jump away.  The picket will be sitting
there with fuel and will spot the enemy first (from their
jump signature while he sits on low power with a low profile).

And if you have dispersed ships to them in small numbers, they
can be picked off by even modest sized forces.

Well, if the attacking force knows that you have disperesed
their fleets, they know they can take a modest sized fleet
and mop up.  As to being able destroy a ship before it
jumps.  If you are moving your dispersed forces around,
they will be arriving low on fuel and can be picked off.
Regarding picking off the forces buy jumping in, it is
cannon that you can jump in an defeat a local force.  If
it wasn\'t true, then much of Traveller military
history is wrong.  I\'m not sure how they relate this
to the ship combat rules.  Maybe they use the jump
suppressors though I have a rule that you can\'t jump
in battle because the energy releases disrupt the field.

Now, if the flight is 500 miles, did the fly actually fly 500 miles?

The answer is no.   Thanks in part to relativity.  If you walked up and down the aisles 
the entire flight, you wouldn\'t have walked 500 miles.  Because in the time it took you to 
take one step, the plane had covered 1/4 a mile or more.

Same for the fly.  It may be in the air, but the speeds are not the same.

So with jumpspace, your ship is functioning and \'moving\', but the bubble is moving much, 
much faster than the ship.

Well, you might take the cannon ship for this purposes, and
arm it.  But I don\'t see one or two armed scout doing much
to keep piracry from a system.

An armed scout doesn\'t have much chance of getting through either.

This is because I see the Imerium loosing maybe a few cargos
a year (at most one every couple months) in only the backwater
system.  This is a lot less cost than basing ships on
multiple worlds in all 10,000 or so systems it has.

It depends on how far you are talking.  Sure you might have
to cover 12 or 18 parsecs in.  But Zhodani ships aren\'t
going to launch a sneak attack on Capital.

They don\'t attack anyone.

Yes they are.  And it is also cannon that they do not appear
on every system all the time.

Well, you might take the cannon ship for this purposes, and
arm it.  But I don\'t see one or two armed scout doing much
to keep piracry from a system.

An armed scout doesn\'t have much chance of getting through either.

This is because I see the Imerium loosing maybe a few cargos
a year (at most one every couple months) in only the backwater
system.  This is a lot less cost than basing ships on
multiple worlds in all 10,000 or so systems it has.

Well, I disagree totally for reasons stated before.

It depends on how far you are talking.  Sure you might have
to cover 12 or 18 parsecs in.  But Zhodani ships aren\'t
going to launch a sneak attack on Capital.

They don\'t attack anyone.

Yes they are.  And it is also cannon that they do not appear
on every system all the time.

Well, just for the record, I diagree that piracy is impossible,
but I don\'t have an opinion on the question of why a pirate
wouldn\'t just sell the ship.  (I mentioned this when I responded
to your first posts decades (centuries? :-) ago, but you may
not recollect).  I just don\'t think the Imperium can wipe out
piracy without cost.  I do have doubts that piracy alone would be
sufficient to validate ship ownership (though I\'m not sure on
that.  Maybe it would work for Vargr corsairs who have someplace
to which they can retreat to avoid the kind of heat that consistent
losses of ships, to justify the cost of ship ownership, and lives
might generate).  I also might see pirate keeping the ship because

a) They are actually making money from it with legit and
other illegit activities (aka smuggling).
b) They aren\'t making money and are desperate to keep it
because "business if just about to turn arond" or the
don\'t want to admit failure.

It\'s not clear from the "canonical" material in _Rats_and_Cats_,
but my feeling was that certain _words_ were always pronounced on
an inhale, rather than specific _sounds_.  Trokh is an odd
language in that many if not most "common" utterances are
"self-contained" (i.e., not analyzable into parts).  The
canonical example is that knowing "dinner" and "is-ready" does
not give you "dinner is ready".

If/when TravLang gets to Trokh, I think I will flesh out the
concepot that Trokh consists of three vocabularies and two
grammars; the three vocabs are Male, Female, and Common; the two
grammars are Traditional/Common, and Warrior/Technical.  I can
elaborate on this idea in the appropriate place at the
appropriate time.

If the MoJ thinks a world is deliberatly understating it\'s income to avoid
taxes, then an audit is definitly in order.Remember, Economics is
Everything :)

About the ST morality thing ... one thing I strongly think is that when
analysing a form of government, one should look at how easily it can be
rigged.

The State in the ST universe has lots of weak points in this regard,
notably the ability to rig the selection of Federal Service to either deny
the franchise to anyone who doesnt go through a two year ideology lesson
("Your Federal Serivce involves two years at a Psychological Research
Facility in Yucatan, where you get to assist the State in techniques to
iron out leftover regard for Individualism") or to legally kill Enemies of
the State by assigning them to a Suicide Squad ("Your Federal Service
involves an unsupported combat jump onto Klendathu. You dont want to ?
Thats a court martial offense and we\'re at war. Time for an abbreviated
court martial (*bang*). You do ? OK").

One more cheap shot. You want more people to vote in the US ? Allow anyone
to lodge a postal ballot for any reason, or put put the voting day on a
weekend or public holiday, when working people can bloody well get to a
voting booth. The reason the US keeps a working Tuesday as election day is
that it is (a) tradition and (b) to the factional advantage of the
Republican Party to minimize voter turnout. Dumping first past the post
could help too.

Back onto Trav.

Imperial Citizenship, in my view, gives you very very few rights, becuase
the base unit of Imperial Society is the planet, not the person. Planets
apply to join the Imperium, not people (hmmm ... could government type 7
include systems that are balkanised, but where each world in the system has
a single government ?).

As someone else pointed out, giving Imperial Citizens rights that Planetary
Citizens do not is a good recipie for friction between the Imperium and
it\'s member worlds. This is not to say the Imperium did not try this at
some point - we have two "revolutionary" periods in Imperial history - the
palace coup that removed Cleon the Mad (and IMO led to the breakup and sale
of Zhunatsu Industries) and the re-establishment of Imperial Authority by
Grand Admiral Arbatrella after the Civil Wars.

This allows periods where the Imperium did try to assert rights for certain
persons that other persons did not have, and periods where it said "Not our
problem. You guys sort it out, and remember ... No One Makes War In Space
But Us".

For my money, one of MoJ\'s roles is providing an honest broker role for
extraditions and so on for Imperial Crimes. Many to most worlds will have
extradition agreements, because they make life easier all around - some
worlds, who do not trust each other\'s legal systems (eg Australia and Saudi
Arabia - the Professor of Islamic Law at Uni of New South Wales said they
got the Gilford case wrong in Islamic Law for eg) may agree that extradited
persons are tried at a third world. Perhaps some megacorps would provide
legal services on a fee-for-service or retainer basis ?

True. The Imperium would, in the case of an emergency, invoke my
favorite rule: the guy with the biggest guns wins. They\'d commandeer
anything they want to (including mercenary outfits, as my PC group
is going to find out when the 5FW starts up in a few months).

I tend to take a cynical approach to this kind of thing. Basically,
then, as I see it, if you\'re rich, powerful or have some kind of
influence at the local Imperial establishment (base, embassy, whatever)
then you\'re likely to get off scot free. If you\'re a lonely grunt
who doesn\'t know anybody on the planet, you\'re in deep trouble.

This seems reasonable. Again, I suspect that people with higher ranks

This works only if the Imperium carefully restricts who can become
Imperial citizens. Another posting on this same thread discusses a
number of ways for becoming one. One of them is that any ex-military,
ex-scout, ex-merchant and anyone with Knight or higher social standing
is an Imperial citizen. If that system is adopted, then your reasoning
has problems because there are just too many citizens around.

On the other hand, if only nobles (Soc 12+) are citizens then there\'s
no problem.

If the ship designer is a complete and total incompetant, yes. If the ship
designer of our theoretical scout ship is competant, and builds it with
jump-n capability and fuel for two jump-n, then no. Take a armed far
trader, add fuel bladders in the cargo bay. Does the job well. It\'s even

Yep. Small *disposable* ships, who cost a very very small fraction of the

By forcing the enemy to concentrate into modest-size forces, you are
reducing the number of forces the enemy can have, and thus the number of
systems they can interdict before reaction.

Every set of combat rules I\'ve seen allows jumps in combat. The only way to
threaten a fleet is to catch it against a coastline (impossible in space)
or low on fuel (difficult if they are competant) or by threatening
something they cannot afford to lose (bingo).

>An armed scout doesn\'t have much chance of getting through either.

Depends on the size of the interdicting force. A single type-s scout with a
pulse laser will toast an out-of-fuel unarmed picket. On the other hand, a
ship with armement absolutely insufficient to stand in line of battle (eg
three triple laser turrets) will fight it\'s way through such a minimal
interdiction force.

Funny, I\'ve always thought that the 12-18 parsec fringe of Imperial space
would be exactly where pirates would operate, becasue it would allow flight
to outside Imperial borders to sell cargoes and stolen ships at freeports.
But maybe it\'s just me, and the fact I can think of zero zilch zip cases of
piracy (as opposed to the sort of muggings on the high seas the Dayaks et
al do these days) that do not include the co-operation of a friendly State.
And yes, I know the dark rumours concerning Singapore and ships that
suddenly develop new registrations in mid-voyage.

>

Good. So if we have enough random patrols (preferably so the chance of
running into a ship with whom you dont want to tangle i.e. an armed one is
100%), then pirates go out of buisiness as pirates. Case closed.

While we are about it, when the pirate in unsure whether there are military
patrol ships about (Far Traders with MilSpec crews and nuke det laser
missiles make plenty good patrol ships in my book. And, hell, a leased
Elisabeth class Frontier Trader is perfect for those 6 month patrols at
uninhabited worlds - it\'s designed for long range patrols sans support
dammit, and the 2.1 gigajoule laser will mean it is a very serious pirate
that goes to play with her), what transponder signal does it use ?

Finally, the issue of permanently basing military ships in systems without
naval bases. In Traveller, a ship needs annual maintainence. Therefore, you
can stay on patrol for maybe 7 months a year, assuming a 2 month trip each
way to the repair point and a month in dry dock. These are not bleeding
edge technologies that malfunction soon as looked at, and require 50 hours
maintainence per flying hour ... Traveller starships are rugged,
well-understood mature technologies.

Crew get shore leave on a lump of rock with an inflatable dome (you get to
stretch your legs at least ... look at what sailors on "shore leave" at
Scapa Flow had to deal with), and accept this as a known condition of service.

They increase the minimal armament of a pirate until (a) a pirate ship
becomes easily disinguishable from a merchant and (b) increases the number
of cargoes a pirate must capture to pay for the weapons. Further, if the
pirate does tangle with one of these pissy little escorts, then the pirate
is going to have battle damage bills to pay. And if they dont want a IN
Report of Combat Damage Repair (Civilian Vessel) report filed, then it is
going to cost extra. A lot extra.

The only smuggling the Imperium cares about is (a) nukes and (b) slaves.

Bullshit. Just isnt going to happen. The *entire* crew needs to be on-side,
and needs to understand that piracy is an option before signing up. Pirates
turned trader a lot more often than traders turned pirate ...

Hello,
  Canonically the case (before 1116), and pretty much conclusively
proved here. One of the books refers to the pre-War Navy as "over-
sized"; this is a good extension of your comments on the behaviour
of organizations - why would the Navy let its share of the budget
decrease, even as actual mission requirements dropped?

>that.  Maybe it would work for Vargr corsairs who have someplace
>to which they can retreat to avoid the kind of heat that consistent

  That works for me too, as I recall that the Vargr corsairs often
took ships if possible, or looted installations, etc.

>might generate).  I also might see pirate keeping the ship because

  I\'ll buy that, but I have to point out that smuggling revenue isn\'t
at all likely to be ship-size dependent, so it will proportionately
provide more support to a smaller ship (assumes "small packages",
rather than smuggling holds full of bulk goods).

>b) They aren\'t making money and are desperate to keep it
>because "business if just about to turn arond" or the

  Hmm, followed by skipping, more crime, possibly desperate enough
to try an unsafe target...  ...but still believable, and possibly
successful either in going legit again or getting filthy rich.

this as atonement for the massive low-Traveller content posts I\'ve been
churning out over the past few days.

	What it is is a simple damage resolution system that handles hit
location and various effects of getting shot, stabbed, plasma blasted,
bludgeoned, lased, mesoned, and shot some more.

	I haven\'t worked hand-to-hand in yet; the idea _just_ occurred to
me now.  Also, please bear in mind that it is a draft and I would more than
welcome criticism and input of any sort.


                 Simple Traveller Universal Damage System (STUDS)

1) Roll to hit.  If to hit roll succeeds, roll 2d6 and consult the
following chart:

Roll   Anatomy     Damage X   1st Stats affected   Effect  Bleed*
Amputate**

2      hand/wrist  0.5***     Dex                  Drop	   High      Medium
3      foot/ankle  0.5***     Dex                  Fall    High      Medium
4      leg         1          Dex/Str              Fall    Medium    High=DD
5      arm         1          Dex/Str              Drop    High      High=DD
6-7    lower torso 1          End/Str              Ref     Medium    N/A
8-10   chest       2          End/Str              Fall    Medium    N/A
11     head/neck   2          End/Str              Ref     Medium    N/A
12     braincase   3          Int (permanently)    Fall    Medium    High=DD=
=DD

* Cutting blade attacks produce this on one damage severity lower (i.e.
Medium instead of High).  Treat stabbing blade attacks as per table.
** Only possible if weapon does 3d6 or higher (2d6 for cutting blade
weapons), always produces Serious Bleeding unless energy weapons involved.
*** Only for slugthrowers; shotguns, plasma/fusion guns, lasers, acid
throwers, and lovebird casters do 1X damage.
=DD Only possible if weapon does 4d6 of damage or higher.
=DD=DD Shotguns and energy weapons produce this effect on Medium or higher
damage rolls.  Always fatal.


2) Roll damage and multiply the result; apply damage to stats as indicated,
apply effects, and veryify whether amputation or serious bleeding occurs.


3) Specific locations can be targeted at increased difficulty as per rule
system being used (T4, MT, KB v.2, etc).  If to hit roll succeeds, roll
damage, and multiply damage, produce effects and bleeding for that location
as per the table.


4) Effects explained:

Drop: Hand facing shooter is hit and anything carried in it is dropped and
damaged at ref\'s discretion.  If both hands in line of fire, roll 1d6; 1-3
left hand is hit, 4-6 right hand is hit.

=46all: Character falls.  Foot facing shooter is hit.  If both feet in line
of fire, roll as above

Ref: Obvious.


5) Bleed:

	Serious bleeding rolls are made depending on the location and
gravity of damage.  Blunt trauma weapons (Thud guns, clubs, dismembered
arms and legs, and so forth) do not produce this effect.

High: 	damage is in the top 33% of all possible damage rolls (i.e. 5 or 6
	on1d65, 8-12 on 2d6, 12-18 on 3d6, etc).
Medium: damage is the top 66% of all possible damage rolls (i.e. 3-6 on a
	1d6, 6-12 on 2d6, 9-18 on 3d6, etc).

Roll 4d6, multiply by 10, divide by the damage multiplier: this is the
number of seconds it takes for one point of health to bleed away.  Fatal
bleeding occurs at Ref\'s discretion.  For bladed weapons only multiply 4d6
by 5.


6) Amputate:

	The hit blows off or up the affected portion of anatomy in a
spectacular, grisly manner reminiscent of Tarentino or Verhoeven at their
worst.  Always produces Serious Bleeding unless energy weapons are involved.


	And that\'s it.  Comments?

	Hm.  Based on any number of reads during high school, and a quick
re-read two weeks ago to freshen up for the movie (have you seen it yet,
BTW), I got the impression that the criminal courts tended to provide the
sort of rough&ready on the spot justice RAH seemed to favour.  This,
however, could just be spillover impressions from his other books.
However, given the TF justice system\'s origins in what were basically lynch
mobs, or vigilantes if you prefer, I\'d be surprised if it offered the same
procedural and substantive protections that we\'d find acceptable (or that
_I\'d_ find acceptable :>).

	As I mentioned above, it\'s a pretty easy inference.  I\'d be
surprised if Heinlein, who advocated on-the-spot capital punishment by
vacuum exposure without benefit of appeal for non-aggravated sexual assault
in another novel, would have had the TF justice system provide the same
kind of protection for the accused.  The corporal punishment thing
certainly isn\'t typical of _modern_ Western justice systems, and IMHO is
more evidence for a less-than-formal justice system in keeping with
Heinlein\'s leanings.

	However, it\'s just an inference (albeit a pretty safe one, IMHO).
In the absence of any hard evidence either way, we could hammer away at
this one for months and just go around in circles...

	Actually, on that one, I think you\'re mistaken.  My read of it
indicates that Dubois, after going through the above-snipped critique of
rights, uses it to lead into his conclusions about "juvenile delinquents":
that they glorified their rights, and forgot about their duties, and that
this was what led to the downfall of the U.S.

	It\'s true that you can infer a positivist position on rights from
that speech.  Still, jumping from that to a position that they held rights
(and here I mean, specifically, the basic freedoms that we take for granted
and the various political and legal rights that safeguard them) in high
regard, is a bit of a leap.  Dubois dismisses the inalienable human rights
set out in your Bill of Rights in such a way that we can infer that either
Heinlein speaking through Dubois took a positivist point of view, or that
Heinlein speaking through Dubois was mistaken about the nature of rights in
a pretty basic way, or that Heinlein just deliberately had Dubois make a
straw man argument as I described.

	Getting to them holding rights in high esteem from there is
difficult.  Sure, you can read it favourably, but given that ST is far more
about the duty side of the rights coin, and that the TF is basically a
model of a society that puts more emphasis on duty, I think that it\'s a
stretch.  And since it is a fictional society, described in a novel, and we
never really find out one way or the other, this is another one that we
could argue until we were both sitting at the bottom of a very deep hole
where a horse used to be :).

	Bummer that RAH is dead.  It\'d be nice to get his input.  That way
we could see whether your optimistic reading or my pessimistic reading was
closer to what he visualized.

	Flip side of the same coin.  Seems that we both have the same take
on the relationship between rights and duties.

	Such as...?  Basically, I don\'t know whether shifting to a more
duty-oriented paradigm would do much to affect basic human selfishness...
and an _over_emphasis on duty would lead to the same sort of situation;
"You\'re not respecting your duty not to infringe on my rights!!".

	Again, no hard data in the book.  However, whether this ideal state
of low crime rates would automatically follow from the sort of political
system that RAH has the TF model is another question entirely...

	Depends on what you mean by "metalaw".  I take a position based
fairly heavily on the work of Hans Gregor Kelsen, a Danish (?) legal
philosopher.  In a nutshell, he thought that a given society\'s "grundnorm",
or basic norm, which I spin to mean a given culture\'s core set of values,
provides the basis for their legal system; their law (and conception of
rights) is based on this, and not some fuzzy "natural" law floating around
the noosphere.  Is this what you\'re driving at?

	If you want to find out more, scope out Feinberg and Gross\'s
_Philosophy of Law_.  It\'s basically a collection of high points in legal
philosophy, and they do a pretty good job on Kelsen, as well as just about
everybody else important in the field...  Some of it is incredibly dense,
impenetrable, abstruse, and boring, but some of it is really worth a read.

	Well, if dad was smart and had his lawyers draft up a really,
really killer trust, never.  However, this brings up the whole question of
merit in a capitalist free market economy.  The consequences of lack of
economic merit (smarts, savvy, drive, ruthless ambition, a bloodyminded
lack of compassion for the lives you crush as you <slap> sorry; got a
little carried away :>)...  Basically, the lazy no good\'s no good laziness
is an economic failing (albeit with personal dimensions too).  He\'s getting
his economic deserts (unless we\'re talking out-and-out fraud here) as he\'s
not been a productive member of society nor managed his assets wisely.

	Thing is is that regardless, I don\'t think that economic clout
should have any impact on a person\'s right to have a say in his society\'s
government.  YMMV, of course.

	Hm.  Although our current separatist provincial government here in
Quebec has me seriously reconsidering my low opinion of that particular
justification of the right to bear arms, I still think that in a properly
constituted, well-running democracy the people can ditch a bozo government
at the ballot box...

	...and that therefore as citizens we\'ve got a duty to participate
in the political process, by voting, by participating in public debate, in
party activism, in volunteering to serve at polls, that sort of thing.  And
it\'s fun, too :).  But I\'m starting to wander off-topic here...

	Well, I\'d have to disagree.  What we call poverty in North America
today is nowhere _near_ what passed for poverty a century ago, let alone
what passes for poverty in the Third World.  And IMHO this improvement is
due in part to the Welfare State... but that\'s another can of non-Traveller
worms :).

	Interestingly enough, I\'ve been discussing the idea of limitations
to the franchise with one of my classmates (guy named Phil) for years.  He
tends to be somewhat to the right of Ghenghis Khan even by U.S. Republican
standards on many issues.  On capital punishment, he thinks that we ought
to buy Florida\'s old electric chair ("Old Sparky") precisely _because_ it\'s
defective and causes convicts\' heads to catch fire during executions...


	We\'ve come up with some interesting ones...  Phil tends to favour
giving every person one vote for every thousand dollars of personal income
taxes they pay (which would really make for some interesting decisions come
tax time!).  I\'d suggested making it conditional on taking and passing high
school courses in Canadian history, general political science, introductory
economics, and introductory moral philosophy.  It\'s a fun question... the
thing is that as of yet I haven\'t run into any idea compelling enough to
make me change my mind about universal adult franchise.

Reminds me of a _Sliders_ episode. In that society, if you were ever 
short on cash, you just played the "lottery". You went to a machine, and 
took out as much cash as you wanted. The more you played, (the more money 
you took) the better your chances of "winning".

Problem is, the lottery was a method of population control. Winning the 
lottery meant giving your life to the greater good of society.

  To paraphrase, we\'ll have to agree to disagree about whether the
3I would insist on building unarmed pickets. If they are going to
be unarmed anyways, they\'re also going to be very small and very
cheap, leaving more resources for real patrol/war ships.

  Fleet Couriers would handle deployment orders. If escorts park
in massed hordes awaiting war, what do they do while the cargo
tonnage they\'re to escort is gathered, or does the IN maintain a
sufficient load-capacity of its own parked with the escorts?

Hello,
  FWIW, IN doctrine is that of the deep defense - no surprise attack
can reach the reserves that will settle the war. Forces from the first
two or three sub-sectors will await the flood of reinforcements from
the sectors behind (FFW). In the case of the Marches, that\'s Deneb
and Corridor, with their (canonically) large reserves of Imperial Fleets.

....
>(and we haven\'t gotten to how you are supporting all these

  Actually we have. I agreed with your thesis that SDB\'s would not
be present (in peacetime) in systems unable to manufacture them.
IIRC, you were in another discussion where a x3 or x4 multiplier
was accepted for the number of ships total needed to keep a single
patrol vessel in a given system, on average. These patrolling starships
now have a maximum cruising range of in-system?

  Not against a commerce raiding cruiser, which would presumably
be the core of a raider squadron.

  Umm, the authorities can\'t tell that a ship has upgraded arms
and computer, but a pirate _can_ tell? Neat.

No.  Or more precisely, they can try it, but they\'d be usually be stupid to
do so.  For most minor infractions, the punishments are minor (spend the
night in the drunk tank, and pay your Cr 50 fine in the morning).  If you
try to invoke Imperial citizenship, you\'ll probably still spend the night
in the drunk tank, but in the morning when you go infront of the judge,
the Imperial Consul will be there.  She\'ll get you off the hook for the
drinking in public charge ... but will probably fine you a kilocredit or
more for damaging relations with a member world and/or conduct unbecoming
an Imperial Citizen, AND boot you accross the extraterritoriality line at
the starport, and tell you not to show your face around "her" planet for
a year or so.

In addition to all of that, member worlds DO have the right to banish an
Imperial Citizen that they find particularly noxious.  This is the rough
equivalent of declaring a diplomat "persona non grata", and usually
causes a bit of a diplomatic flap any time it\'s used.

Imperial citizenship is intended for circumstances where the local laws 
have extreme penalties for minor offenses, difficult to comply with, or 
intended to discriminate against offworlders.  The Imperial Justice takes
precedence, so that Imperial Citizens can do their business in relative
safety despite bizarre local customs.  

Some worlds, particularly with totalitarian governments, may have a shoot
first and ask questions later policy.  In these cases, Imperial Citizenship
probably won\'t help, unless you can talk fast before they shoot.  A
diplomatic 
incident after you\'re dead doesn\'t help you dodge the bullet.  Worlds 
where it truly is difficult or dangerous for offworlders to get anything done 
are usually posted as Amber zones.

And about 98+% of them will be turned down by the Imperium.  To become a
citizen, you basically have to do or be someone who will contribute to
the Imperium.  Just because you want to avoid paying planetary taxes isn\'t
a good enough reason.

Flyers and Sailors in my campaigns are members of the COACC (Close-Orbit and 
Aerospace Control Command) forces of a member world - these folks serve in the
military of a local world (usually their homeworld), and NOT the Imperial
military.

Diplomats, if in Imperial service, would count for citizenship.  However,
there are a large number of diplomats who represent their local world to
other worlds, who would not be in Imperial service.

In the CT rules, in some services (Book 5, for example), you can tell from
the character generation rules if your character is in the Imperial
service.  

>However, in the MT/CT rules (the only ones I\'m familiar with) you
>can\'t get a dishonourable discharge. 

For the basic CT/MT generation, we\'d assumed that characters who
were drafted were NOT in Imperial service; only volunteers that made an
enlistment throw were in Imperial service.

We always used variant mustering-out rules; in particular, a failed
survival throw indicated some type of involuntary discharge.  We had a
table to throw on (from the Paranoia Press _Scouts and Assasins_ book), 
but it was generally either medical or dishonorable.  Ending a term 
and failing the re-enlistment throw was \'honorable\', as was resigning 
(ending a term and deciding not to re-enlist).

>So, basically, once you\'re in one of those careers, you\'re a citizen.

The idea of citizenship was to make it something worthwhile, and something
that not every PC in the group would have.

>I wouldn\'t use this one. The MT Merchant career is totally in the
>private sector and thus wouldn\'t qualify.

In my own little variant of the Imperium, in order to foster insterstellar
commerce, the Imperium ran the Merchant Service Academy.  Academy
graduates recieved a commission as an Ensign in the Imperial Navy Reserve
(and therefore recieved citizenship).  In the case of a war or other
emergency, Naval Reserve officers are subject to activation.

This was also from Paranoia Press: _Merchants and Merchadise_.

>> - Limited-Liability Imperial Corporations.
>Yes, for tax reasons. 

No, for trade and commerce reasons.  Remember, the guiding principle is not
what the Imperium can do for the corporation, but rather what the corporation
can do for the Imperium.  The LIC is an Imperium-wide incorporation, and
generally LICs are the companies that are going to engage in wide-scale
business activities that will benefit the Imperium as a whole.

Companies that don\'t apply for (or who don\'t qualify for) LIC status aren\'t
(usually) going to be doing anything that will benefit the Imperium as a
whole (or even a large part of it.

>Although, why restrict it to limited liability corporations?

The other reason is to avoid eroding the member worlds\' tax base, and
to avoid meddling overmuch in the internal affairs of those worlds.  While
it\'s certainly an Imperial matter how a megacorporation (or even a
sector-wide or subsector-wide corporation) is governed and taxes.  It\'s not
a matter of Imperial concern how the corner grocery market is governed, no
matter how much the proprietor would like to avoid paying sales tax, income
tax, property tax, inventory tax, and so on.

>Why not say that any corporation qualifies which is headquartered in the 
>Imperium and has Imperial citizens as a majority of its controlling officers?

These are probably requirements for a LIC (and giving a large block of stock
to the Imperial family doesn\'t hurt, either).

Right.  Probably the decision would be made at a lower level (a set of
guidelines and a standing committee to review applications), but would
require the Duke\'s say-so before citizenship could be granted.

Yeah, but your scout has had time to pick is position, reduce
his signature, and has been loaded with good sensors.  Being
of "competant" design means he will have similar sensor, have
to deal with the jump signature, and then have to move through the
system finding people.  Your picket is just going to have to jump
away.

Even if he didn\'t, arming him would be useless unless you
expect him to fight his way out of the situation.  How often
do you think some scout ships is going to be able to take on
an invasion fleet.

And these are going to stop pirates?  They would be great if
they just have to get back with news (which is why I have
pickets like this).

And, since they face dispersed forces, they can count on winning
every battle.  So your dispersed forces are only useful if the
enemy doesn\'t show up.

Well, in fact Traveller history is full of ships catching
ships.  I think the canon explination if jump suppressors.

>>Well, I disagree totally for reasons stated before.

[Fake ship communications....]

Even if one finds this cute, it doesn\'t nothing to advance your
point.  We have covered the idea that all ships would leave
from fixed, patroled jump point.  I disagree for reasons stated
before.

Yes, in this part of the Imperium, they would have this kind of
piracy in addition.

[Regarding piracy that does not operate out of friendly states...]
We have covered this.  Yes, piracy operating like this has occured
and, in spite of your characterizing it as just rumours, happens
today.  It also would be easier to do in the Imperium than it
is today.  We have covered this and I stand by what I said before.

And to be there 100% of the time you need to patrol everywhere all
the time.  That is the problem.  This is not "random patrols", it
is exactly what many are questioning.

We have been over tranponders too.

Well, no.  Reread the list of Imperial crimes that was posted

is also smuggling things past locals.

Leonard what about women, or non whites ?  Law and custom both

property, or the ability to *learn* a profession."

Without meaning to sound harsh here I must point out that your statement

So what is your status if you are born on a ship in jump space ?
(Between 2 Imperial Worlds)

Are you 

1) An Imperial Citizen without a home world
2) A citizen of the planet your ship is registered on
3) A Citizen of your Mothers homeworld
4) A citizen of the first planet you land on
5) Not a citizen of the Imperium or of any planet
6) An Imperial Citizen who may or may not have citizenship from a
planet, depending on its laws.

I\'ve vague recollections of reading an article about one of Einstein\'s
German compatriots, who escaped to the west. Apparently he was taking an
exam of some form for citizenship in the US and almost blew it. Why?
Because when the interviewer said \'at least that couldn\'t happen here\' he
proceeded to explain exactly how the establishment could be subverted.

If anyone knows who and where this morsel came from, I\'d appreciate a reminder.

I suspect that unless the citizens are vigilant, any state could be
subverted over time.

1116 has the unfortunate side effect that it doesn\'t really conclude, and

It\'s a great background but not a film IMHO! The FFW has goodies, baddies

Even a TNE film with operations in the Promise subsector would be better....

essential-please, no more love affairs in space), AND good FX.
A Traveller Movie shouild be an all around masterpiece, that leaves
everybody saying wow, where can i get this game. To achieve that,
effects like in B5 or 5th Element are necessary, as opposed to effects
like in Dark Star or Space Mutiny (easily the worst SciFi ever).

As for a plot, i would recommend using one of the CT modules, don=B4 t
know which yet.

It\'s *in* another space. Whether or not it is travelling is hard to
say, give that you can\'t do to detect *anything* outsde the jump
bubble.

It could be arbitrarily short. This is hard to explain without some
diagrams. But if you think of a pair of planes at an agle to each
other, it helps.

Unknown.

No! That always *sounds* like it\'d maje a great drive. Only thing is,
what if two ships jump at the same time? You make a mess out of
spacetime.

In fact I got my bill yesterday and was thinking I should tell folk about
the cost and the book.  (just in case anyone thought that the whole thing
was imaginary as someone asked me a while back)

My final bill (including postage to the UK and exchange rates etc., came to
101 pounds which makes it sound like a BITS product!  I reckon that must be
$160 or so.  Yes it is expensive, but what a book you get.  I rarely like
books just for the physical attributes rather than the contents but this
has both!

Also, consider that if you were to try and buy all the alien modules and
Alien Realms separately in auctions, you could easily pay $20-30 for each
item.  And that\'s if you could buy them at all.  Some I\'ve seen for sale
only very rarely.


As Dom said, if you don\'t own the Alien modules, this volume is highly
recommended and for those that do have the alien modules but like natty
looking Traveller books and have the money, go for it.  I certainly don\'t
regret having saved all year to be able to buy it.


Thanks Marc for letting IBR do this and here\'s to them doing a similar
volume with, say, all the LBBs.

The hard part is preventing them from getting outside help. A few
buddies and a helicopter, and they are free.

Just like the idea of dumping prisoners on a habitable planet with some
watchdog satellites. It works fine until somebody shows up with a ship.

    'body' => 'Metalaw started as an attempt to devise a code of behavior or ethics
that would be equally applicable to humans and to any concievable
aliens we might encounter.

The first thing to go out the window is the golden rule. Treating an
alien the way you\'d want to be treated could *kill* the alien.

So they use this instead:

The Great Rule of Metalaw:

	Do unto others as they would have you do unto them.

And tthe other basic principle is Kant\'s Categorical Imperative:

	Act in such a way that the maxim of your will can at the same
	time always be vaild as a principle of general legislation.

In other words, always stop and ask yourself "but what if *everyone*
acted this way?".

From the above they came up with the following (I have a more recent
version, but only in hardcopy, I\'ll type it in if folks are interested)

the eleven "fundamental metalaws" in descending order of importance

 1. No partner of Metalw may demand an impossibility.
 2. No rule of Metalaw must be complied with when compliance would
    result in the practical suicide of the obligated race.
 3. All intelligent races of the universe have in principle equal
    rights and values.
 4. Every partner of Metalaw has the right of self-determination.
 5. Any act which causes harm to another race must be avoided.
 6. Every race is entitled to it\'s own living space.
 7. Every race has the right to defend itself against against any
    harmful act performed by another race.
 8. The preserving of one race has priority over the developement of
    another race.
 9. In case of damage, the damager must restore the integrity of the
    damaged party.
10. Metalegal agreements and treaties must be kept.
11. To help other races by one\'s own activities is not a legal but a
    basic ethical principle.

Anyway, this is quite probably the basis of Imperial Law. It leaves a
*lot* of leeway for various cultures (see #3 & #4). But it also gives
an interesting take on things. For example, the "bounty hunter"
question would seem to fall under #3, #4, and #7. #3 & #7 are in
favor, #4 is against. Of course, there\'s also the matter of going from
"race"(culture) to individual. That\'s where the later version is a bit
more helpful.

Note that the Hivers and the K\'kree routinely vuiklate the rules. :-)

For someone who has been out the loop for some time, is it still 
impossible to change transpoders in starships?  It would seem to me that 
there *could* be a tremendous black market/organized crime interest in 
developing a way to change transponders so that stolen ships 
disappear....

Has that been discussed before?

One should not automatically assume that because a SF writers society
advocates something the author does as well. Does crime writers like
promote murder?
The airlock thing I take it you got fromn "The moon is a harsh mistress".

(I do agree that some of Heinleins work were little camouflaged political

Try a cosmic string. Of course, there\'s a slight problem in that any
attempt to grab the string will ruin pretty much anything that gets
near it (gravity fields as bad as a black hole).

Obligatory traveller bit:
Subject: Imperial Starship Troopers
What is the average Imperial Marine likely to wear? What is their main role
in shipboard life? Is it for initiating and repelling boarding actions? If
so, I think it unlikely they are going to be going around in battle dress
with plasma guns all the time. There are lots of small places on ships.
Or is their main role for securing select installations. Like, the ships
pound the hell out of a station, starport with their capital weapons, and
the marines take and hold them. The Army comes in later and garrisons it?
This would imply more heavy weapons and armament.
However, odds are that the majority of a marine\'s life is spent outside of
combat or near-combat situations. What are their _normal_ shipboard duites?
Are they the military police or is that kept separate?

   That depends.  How close to the star were these ships?  Dropping 10
   grams of material onto the surface of a neutron star should make an
   x-ray burst of the same order of magnitude as a nuclear bomb.  So
   you\'d need to be within a few miles to be affected.  I suspect that
   one 10-gram bullet is pretty small potatoes compared to all the debris
   that would normally be falling into a neutron star anyway, but then
   again, Niven likes to put his n-stars in unusual places.

	3	Theft	Pollution	Slaughter	Dishonor
	4	Destruction	Ravage	Murder	Treason
	5	Havoc	Ruin	Mass Murder	High Treason
	Degree. 	Crimes are further detailed by degree, the exponent of the economic
value or cost of the crime: Violation-2 is a minor crime involving a value of
about  Cr100. Intentionally killing a businessman is Murder-6 (attributing to
him a value of Cr1,000,000); killing a laborer is perhaps Murder-4. Assigning
economic value to a crime is admittedly sometimes a subjective decision.
	Cultural Values. Not all cultures believe that all of the instances on this
list are crimes.

Crimes Against Property
	Vandalism. Casual defacing of property.
	Damage. Physical devaluation of property, but falling short of destruction.

(taking by stealth) and robbery (taking by force), fraud (taking of property
by deception).
	Destruction. Physical destruction of property. Includes Arson, Bombing.
	Havoc. Mass or indiscriminant destruction of property.

Crimes Against The Environment
	Waste. Misuse of resources. Includes failing to sort trash, failure to
maintain equipment in efficient running order.
	Contamination. Minor crimes against the environment. Includes littering,
emitting obnoxious noises or odors, failure to dispose of useless property.
	Pollution. Active disposal of untreated waste. Includes unauthorized toxic
waste disposal. 
	Ravage. Includes strip mining,

Crimes Against Beings.
	Assault. Physical violence against intelligent beings with or without short
term injury.

traffic or curfew violations, failures of permits or paperwork.
	Slack. Undue dependence on society or the state. Includes welfare or
unemployment assistance abuse.
	Dishonor. Actions which could (but have not) harm members of society.

This is my first full design using FFS@ and Andy Akins\' incredible
spreadsheet.

A few things that I\'ve noticed:

Big computers are a very good thing.  By using a powerful comp, I cut the
crew needs in half.  

I like having all the little "fiddly bits" like gyms and armories.. helps
me keep the design in my mind.

I definitely like all the options Andy\'s included.  Differing ranges,
budgets, etc..

One oddity, though..  When I did the three laser batteries, the first comes
up as 4-2-2-2.. the other two, which are identical, come in as 4-4-4-4.
Does the spreadsheet consider additional batteries of the same weapon to be
a "super battery"?

Enjoy!

Gridlore Technologies is proud to announce the first flight of the I.M.V Dark Star, first of the new Series II Terrapin Exploratory Cruisers.

Bigger, better equipped, and on the forefront of technology, the Dark Star is the perfect tool for the expansion of trade into newly recontacted areas.  All of the features of the popular Terrapin (winner of the ISBA\'s Award for Excellence) remain, and the entire package has been tightened.

Improvements in the electronics suite has cut the crew requirement in half, while actually increasing the amount and quality of sensor data reaching the crew.  The flight deck makes use of the highest quality dynamic controls, and anti-tamper and anti-hijack protocols insure that only authorized personnel affect ship\'s operations

The Dark Star keeps the immensely popular troop compliment, and now provides them with a dedicated armory for secure weapons storage.  A full gymnasium has been added by popular demand, along with a complete kitchen facility with seating for 22 people for full, nutritious meals.  The ship\'s expanded science section has a full laboratory to make use of, allowing almost any basic scientific question to be answered.

GT understands that it\'s a dangerous frontier.  The Dark Star has an impressive set of 95Mj laser batteries, along with military grade armor and a full compliment of sandcasters.  We even went to the trouble of receiving permission to mount a meson screen and nuclear damper for your protection.

If you don\'t want to fight, run!  The Dark Star can accelerate at a constant 2G even with full cargo.  Run empty, and streak away at 3G constant!  (NOTE: 3G exceeds the design limitations of the hull.  Design tolerances should not be exceeded expect in dire emergency.  Over acceleration damage is not covered by warranty agreement with Gridlore Technologies, LIC.)

With 750 displacement tons of cargo space, and an onboard hanger for a 90-ton shuttle, the Dark Star is a versatile merchant for the unsettled frontier.  There are fortunes to be made out there, and the Dark Star is the ship that will get you there.

Sir Arameth Gridlore wishes to express his sympathies to the employees and families of Long Run Frontier Transport, LIC, and has posted a 5 MCr. reward for information leading to the apprehension of whomever attacked the I.M.V. Looks Like Rain.

    'body' => 'I posted a long message to trav-tech about lasers penetrating armour - in
FFS1/TNE lasers got a bonus to go through armour, in FFS2 this is missing,
with the result that even civilian ships can easily have enough armour to
be completely immune to most laser weapons. I can email the long message to
anyone who wants it, but the reader\'s digest version is that I suggested
bringing back the "penetration rating" for lasers - a multiplier that is
applied to the targets armour - but having it be standardized for all
lasers of a given type:

     Chem Laser    Chem laser    DEI laser     DEI laser   X-ray  Detonation
     in atmos.     in space	 in atmos      in space	   laser    Laser
        1              1/4          1            1/10      1/10     1/20  

(DEI="Direct Energy Input", the standard Traveller laser.) So, if a 
starship laser with an FFS2 rating of 25 hits a target with an armour of 
60 it does 25 - (60/10)=19 points of damage. Note that I have cleverly 
arranged things so that the most common kind of laser involves only dividing
by 10, which is easy for most people to do. Note also that I have made lasers
hitting targets in atmosphere much weaker, which is probably a good thing 
(at least for anyone on the ground.))

(Note also that this is on FFS2\'s damage/armour scale (roughly matching
the personal combat armour scale in T4), not the T4 starship scale; a 
later post will explain how to do that.)

I tried to post a similar message last night, but I have yet to see it come back

I\'ve been very pleasantly surprised at all the mail I\'ve gotten requesting a
copy of my file.  Finally, I\'m known for something other than arguing about
obscure topics!  :)

Anyway, to the point... I whipped out a quick web page last night and posted
both the spreadsheet and the flat database (i.e. no data normalization - just
the imported data) out on the web.  You can find the page at
http://www.teleport.com/~douglas/traveller.html

Both the spreadsheet and the database are zipped in a self-extracting
executable.  The spreadsheet is about 800K and the database is a bit over 400K.
I saved the spreadsheet in Excel 5.0 format, but the database is still in
Access97.

I should point out that I do not believe that the data is suitable for a M:0
campaign, but is more focused towards a M:1100 (which is what I run) campaign.
I have not yet begun checking against my sources for accuracy, but the Missouri
Archive has always been a reliable source in the past.  (I know, I\'ve pulled a
LOT of material from there!  It\'s kinda satisfying to be able to give back...)

As this very interested long time Traveller enthusiast slavers at the
prospect I must say YES I am interested. Perhaps it might be better to
upload the spreadsheet back to the misssouri archive? This way any
interested parties can grap this tasty tidbit at their convience. I assume
of course that Joe can handle such a large upload.

This is the original Fighter from X-TEK.  Designed in Year 20 to compliment, 
and eventually replace the Zhunastu F-0 Class of fighter. (OOC: the one in 
\'Starships\')  A small light fighter used in patrols and escorts.  This 
fighter is capable of maneuvering in both space and atmosphere, due to its 
"flying wing" configuration.  Whereas most fighters are designed around a 
single forward firing laser "lance", the XTF-1 Alpha has a military standard 
95Mj laser turret in its design.  The benefits are a standard socket weapon 
that can be repaired or replaced with utmost efficiency, and the 360 arc of 
fire. Also an MFD was installed to provide a better targeting solution, 
something that was not available in the F-0. The hull has been stealthed and 
masked to make it a difficult target to lock onto.  Power is supplied for up 
to 24 standard hours by a Zhunastu Industries Fusion+ unit.

    'topic' => 'batteries of weapons in T4 combat',
    'body' => 'A second problem with T4/SSDS/etc. is the way they group weapons into 
batteries; a set of 100 dinky little 1 Mj lasers is actually much better than
a single 100 MJ laser, even though the 1 MJ lasers would be completely
incapable of penetrating even civilian ship armour if you treated them
individually. 

(This is exacerbated by the "ablative armour" of T4 space combat.)

A suggestion (which I posted in more detail to trav-tech) is to 
add to the USD of battery weapons a "penetration rating" (which is the
maximum armour they can penetrate) as well as their existing "damage
rating". If the penetration rating is less than the targets armour, the
weapon does only surface damage. If the pen rating is greater than the
armour, the weapon does an interior explosion hit with its full damage
rating. If the pen rating is equal to the armour, it would do an interior
explosion with its damage value reduced by 2.

So, for example, one medium laser (which used to be rated 1-1-1-1) would be
rated (70:1 70:1 70:1 70:1) (this assumes the enhanced laser penetration 
mentioned in my previous post.) Ten small lasers, which used to be rated
1-1-1-1 as well, would be 10:1 10:1 10:1 10:1 - capable only of surface hits

Discussion of this probably belongs on trav-tech, but I thought I would
summarize the suggestion here...

I wrote a Perl script to scurry through the text sector
data and pull out starport + population information for
Imperial worlds.  The data is almost certainly not perfect,
but it should be *usefully* accurate.  Here\'s what came out.

So there is hope for humankind yet, then.


But back to the point:

Low budget or high-budget with effects? Well. We get one shot at this. If
it fails to sell; that\'s it. So, do we want to make a cheap
straight-to-video movie which we\'ll all love but which will not advance the
cause, or are we to aim for a mass audience that\'ll bring in enough money
to make other films a possibility?
Thought so.

Now, to get that mass audience, you need effects. You need explosions and
punchups and the like. Watcvh the opening credits for Babylon 5 - how many
major characters are NOT depicted hitting someone, shooting at someone or
flying a sleek and deadly (Armed) space vessel.

That\'s what the moviegoing public has been conditioned to expect from SF.
That\'s what we HAVE to give them if we are to succeed.

But that does not stop us having a great plot and strong characters. 

The Traveller movie need not be as expensive as ST. It could be done for
the budget of a couple of Babylon 5 episodes if the settings were
apppropriate (Thanks Brian for pointing that out!).

What you need is a scriptwiter and a director who understand the material
and know what they want from the movie. Both already exist on the TML. We
also need to show that there is support fpr the idea, that there is a
guarenteed audience (as well as the moviegoing public).

SO: What do we want from the Traveller Movie (Not which actors we want in
what roles). What setting? What sort of plot (Empire-Building, Warfare,
Scout Service, Deep Space Rescue, Merchant-ship adventuring, Twilight\'s
Peak) do we want to see?

Any thoughts?
MJD.

Does anyone know offhand what fraction of the populace were counted as
Roman citizens, at a time when the distinction was meaningful?

NB, my current feel is that the people who served in the Imperial forces
are know collectively as the Imperial Veterans, and they are self named the
Ivys.  The primary right is that of asking Imperial justice, and the
primary responsibility is not using that right unless absolutely needed, as
well as being ready and willing to be called up in time of need.

As far as Imperial Marines are concerned, it depends on what the Marine 
Detachment is for.  Currently, US Marine serve aboard carriers and such, 
and deploy on Assault Ships, as well as serve guarding the US embassies 
around the world.  I think that translates very well to the Traveller 
Universe.

Marines at sea Marines wear regular uniforms (camouflaged according to 
the area in which they may be required to take action).  Marines serving 
as part of "ship\'s company" (primarily those on carriers) have 
responsibility for security.  That means that they are the defensive 
force for the ship in port and provide security for the aircraft and 
weapons of mass destruction (WMD or NUKES).  They are part of the ship\'s 
force and are there for the protection of the vessel.  That would 
include repelling boarders or being the boarding party (if that were 
possible nowadays).  Should they be taking part in security work, they 
would be wearing their battle dress (kevlar armor, helmets, weapon 
(loaded) etc.)when on duty, and as the threat condition dictates.

Marines assigned as an assault force have a different role.  They 
normally do not provide security for the ship (unless extraordinary 
circumstances dictate, and then only after the captain asks the 
commander of the forces ashore for assistance).  They have heavier 
weapons, and are primed for the assault.  Again, they do not wear armor, 
etc. unless they are actually getting ready to go ashore.  They also 
have with them in the assault craft and the hold the tanks and artillery 
that they will use for the assault...

Marines at embassies wear a variety of uniforms and serve various 
functions, but do have weapons and body armor should the need arise.

One of the of the things that really pissed off the sailors was that the 
Marines being carried as an assault force HAD NO REGULAR DUTIES during 
the times that they were at sea.  You can only clean your weapon so many 
times, check out your tank so often, work out so much, do so many 
correspondence courses, etc.  

Marines in ships company stand guard duty, provide the ready security 
force etc.  On board ship, where they are part of the ships company, 
they are the ships "police force" though that would not be the correct 
term.  They are the Security Force.  Carriers actually have a Navy 
police force and a criminal investigator assigned...(they are huge 
ships...)

Imperial Marines would have the same functions.  The ship\'s company 
Marines, the Security Force, would be schooled in shipboard combat, 
forced entry, Zero-G combat, etc.  They would have a squad (platoon?) or 
so of Battle Dress equipped Marines for the assault into the enemy ship, 
with another squad or so of lighter armored personnel for mop up 
operations (getting into those small areas).  Those on duty would be 
wearing appropriate protective armor/vacc suits as determined by the 
level of threat condition....  In port, they would be the security 
force.  

I envision that while traveling to the assault point, Marines would have 
holodeck kind of training facilities, programmed to mirror the 
environment that they would be entering.  They would be acclimatized to 
the world\'s climate by the time they arrived at the drop point through 
the use of adjustable climate controlled warfare training rooms.

Think of the fun Marines would have landing on a planet to protect the 
embassy or starport...lots of adventure hooks there...  Amber goes to 
Red and you are the force to go keep the peace (shades of Beiruit)...

Semper Fi!

One category that probably needs to be included (or exemplified within
the current scheme) are intellectual property law, very important in the
Vilani influenced Imperium.

These could be included in the Property crimes area, but this is a VERY
important segment of law to the Vilani.

   True, but an independent couldn\'t make Traveller.  I say .0000etc.
percent chance, because let\'s face facts: name for me the number of RPGs
that have spawned theatrical productions.  While both D&D and Battletech did
rate short lived cartoons, that\'s as far as they went.

   No, the best we could responsibly hope for is that Traveller would
*influence* a maker of film, such that certain plot elements from the game
end up in one of their movies.  As people who started playing Traveller in
the early 80\'s get into positions of power in Hollywood (most of these
people are in their mid-30s), I\'ll think you\'ll see it happen more often.

On duty, my Marines wear either shipboard jump suits (similar to Imperial
Navy togs) or casual uniforms appropriate to the climate and duties being
performed.

The main roles played by shipboard Marines are 1. Security,  2. Damage
control parties, and 3.  Gunnery (on certain vessels.)  So far as boarding
actions, these are rare in space combat, but all marines are trained just
in case.

In Milieu:0, most Marines are armed with the RF-Gauss found in Emperor\'s
Arsenal.  The plasma weapon is a support gun.

Since Marines are the Imperium\'s only dedicated ground force, you\'ll find
them outside Imperial Embassies and facilities, guarding the gates.  There
is a strong ceremonial role to be fulfilled, with drill teams and
exhibition units making the rounds.

In a planetary invasion, the Marines make the initial landing by drop
capsule, and secure a LZ for the follow-on forces (usually Army).  The Navy
and Marines need to clear a wide enough area to allow the Army to land
multiple shuttles and set up a logistics base for further action.

Note that the Marines are singularly unsuited for long duration combat.
They use power-hungry equipment and weapons with obscene rates of fire.
They need to be relived quickly, and it\'s inefficient to try to devote the
resources to resupply them, when a similar amount of lift could be used to
support many more soldiers.

>Are they the military police or is that kept separate?

If the real-world is any indication, they spend a great deal of time
cleaning things.  Opportunities for training are low aboard ship, so the
Marines probably use the down-time of jump to teach the technical skills
that young Marines need, both in formal classroom and informal learn on the
job settings.

Whether or not there is a separate Naval Police is dependant on wether the
Marines are as linked to the Navy as the USMC is to the US Navy.. IMHO, the
Marines act as the enforcers, doing shore patrol and the like.

All of this is my opinion, and comment is invited.

Around 2-3% between 100 BC and 1 AD.  Augustus\' reforms increased that
number dramatically, to about 5-6%.

Actually, Heinlein mentions in Starship Troopers that you can quite anytime
you\'re not in combat, even just before a jump.  The Federation just gets
"really sticky" about your franchise after that.

I\'m currently discussing this book in class (naturally, with the movie just
out and the kids knowing that I like SF), so I\'ve reread it several times in
the last fortnight.

Good call! The Dark Star does come with one level of thermal masking..
hence the name.

Dougie, _please_, *please*, _PLEASE_ don\'t take your life that way.  What
would your mailing list think!  Seriously reconsider.  I mean it.  I could
even try to find Jack\'s telephone number for you, it would be dignified
that way. <G> (Maybe I misunderstood--some other horde, hmmm, No.)

BTW, you had J.P. going for a moment with that Mystery Science Theatre 3000
schtick.  Then I explained to him that you *hadn\'t* figured out my post. You
accomplished little Mystery, junk Science, and mostly Theatre.  Yes, I must
give you credit for taking the Planetologist out of your bragline.  Of course,
I\'m not surprised you would further attempt to compare yourself with the
true greatness of something you had no creative input to. :)

BTW, the last person to doubt J.P.\'s existence started the great HIWG flame
war and as I warned him, J.P. has much more time to do e-mail than I do. :)
He suggested you take it to private e-mail at: sullivanjames@hotmail.com

I told him you couldn\'t stomach not talking in front of an audience (must
run in the family :) probably because it is less funny that way.

Oh yeah, you don\'t even rate between midterms now, just between programs.

Actually, I disagree.  They didn\'t seem evil at all, just ludicrous and
stupid.  The Harkonnens in the book series portrayed an aura of evil
much, MUCH better, without all the pointlessly gross scenes.  Like the
Baron\'s fondness for young boys.  I think everyone considers that pretty
evil.  Understandably, the movie could not show things like that.

No, the film portrayed the Baron and his cronies as laughable, idiot
fatmen with gluttonous and greedy attitudes.  Sting was pretty ominous
and I appreciate the effort he gave to his role as Feyd-Rautha.

The original Baron wasn\'t some flesh-rotted fatman as seen in the
movie.  His \'ugliness\' was on the inside.

In my (humble) opinion, if the movie is going to be adapted from one of the
Traveller adventure plots, there are probably only a few front-runners: I\'d
suggest the _Sky Raiders_ trilogy or _The Traveller Adventure_.

In either case, the plot would have to be considerably simplified in order to
fit into a two-hour movie - but both storylines offer plenty of action,
interesting characters that the audience can identify with, plenty of action
of a type that would translate easily and cheaply to the big screen, some
cool ships, and also a bit of sequel potential.

The important other factor here is that both of these stories offer a plot
that
can be trimmed and re-arranged without ruining the storyline.

   For accuracy sake, it was Leroy who started the Final War on
HIWG-list, and it was J.P. who made sure that the flames stayed nice and
high by pouring verbal gasoline everywhere just when it seemed a truce
was at hand.

   Trust me, *no one* on this list wants J.P. around.  His posts consist
of about 1 percent substance, and about 99 percent flame/flame bait. 
The day that he arrives here, is the day everyone will look longingly
back to the glory days of Starship Trooper and pirate talk.

   The last word I had on the list was that it was temporarily down.  It

kinda hard to do at the moment, but send me a private e-mail in a few

   TTC #13 is currently sitting on Kevin Knight\'s desk waiting to go to

Hello,
  Really difficult, then impossible after the Cymbeline-derived
chips are enslaved, urh, used. This contradicts a fair chunk of
canonical material, so assuming that forgeries capable of passing
civilian or backwater queries are possible seems reasonable. Pirates
might also substitute _very_ comprehensive intel/target set-up data
for using a transponder themselves.

  The best way of disappearing a stolen ship remains getting it to
a state that will ignore its ownership status.

I don\'t use that sig because it\'s rather long, and since I picked up

No, but I *think* that one way of earning citizenship was serving in

This is one reason I argue for a lot of energy weapons, and some sort
of compact units for turning any handy scrap metal into gauss rounds.
Given fusion, energy is not going to run out easily.

Well, it\'d be easy enough to check if you have the the mass of the
star, the diameter of the star, and how far from the star\'s center the
ship was when he fired the bullet.

You calculate the escape velocity for the altitude the bullet was fired
from and subtract it from the escape velocity at the surface. That\'s
how fast the bullet was moving downwards when it hit. Sideways velocity
would be orbital velocity of the ship *minus* muzzle velocity of the rifle.

Add the vectors, square the resulting velocity and multiply by the mass
of the bullet. Divide by 2. The result is the energy released on impact.

There\'s an old book by Sinclair Lewis on the subject. It was written in
the 30s and as I recall the title was "It can\'t Happen Here". It was a
chilling description of the US turning into a fascist state.

Frankly, I think the "Founding Fathers" would be appalled at the way
the government has exceeded the limits they put on it.

Non sequitur.

A nuke has a lethal radius of many *thousands* of km in space. In
atmosphere, the X-rays are absorbed by air within a few meters, heating
it to incandescense. *That* is what generates the thermal pulse. The
sudden expansion of the heated air generates the blast wave.

It was the *same* star as in "Neutron Star".

It was for those considered "people". Women and blacks were both
"property", with women having limited civil rights, and blacks having
none.

But white, adult males were *not* kept from professions or earning
property. Note that when blacks were granted civil rights, there *were*
immediate* moves to limit their franchise in exactly the way I mentioned.

Mark, I had to edit the table above. Either you are using a
proportional font, or you have your tabs set to something other than
eight characters. Either way, it makes *all* "formatted" text from you
practically unreadable.

I\'d suggest using "Terminal" as your font if you are on a PC. Or else
some other pixed pitch font.

Most religions consider disbelief (or perhaps "misbelief" ) to be a
lesser sin than Heresy. For example, Christianity doesn\'t hold being a
Taoist agaonst you. They would rather you converted. But if you have
heretical beliefs, they\'ll be all over you. (Heresy is being of a
religion, but holding beliefs contrary to doctrine).

When?

To start with, there were "levels" of Citizenship ...

Roman Citizen ... by the Empire, this was pretty much all of what we would call
modern Italy.

Latin Citizen ... had the rights of connubium (could marry a roman citizen
legally -- presumably their offspring would be citizens) and commercium (the
right to trade with Roman citizens)

Non-citizen (technically "Peregrini" or "foreigners") ... who would have a
subset of the rights of a Latin citizen or few to no rights at all.

After Caracalla (? ... or was it Elagabalus? ... mid to late C3rd IIRC)
*everyone* in the borders of the empire who had been born there was a citizen.

Take rape, for example.  Why is this an extraditable crime, yet assault
isn\'t?  After all, rape is essentially assault with torture (both physical
and psychological) thrown in.  What about a species where one sex isn\'t
sapient, or is less intelligent than the other?  What about species with
mating seasons, when one or both sexes aren\'t thinking clearly?

My opinion is that Imperial crimes should be major ones, and only major ones.
 This is especially true before the Empire is well-established.  Painting in
very broad strokes:

1) Treason
2) Restraint of interstellar trade
3) Ecological destruction

Specific other crimes would be fit into these catagories.  For example,
destruction of Imperial property would be a form of treason, as would killing
an Imperial noble or official (these being, in effect, an attack on the
emperor himself).

Let\'s see. Gambling is (currently in Illinois) a state monopoly, so I suppose
that private gambling would be a crime against the State (or against
society).

Penny ante games would be Violation-1 or 2. Drug use would be Slack.
Prositution would be a violation of social regulations... Violation-2 or 3.

I\'ve had a couple of people point out some errors in the file.
If you find any problems, please let me know!  I hope to fix the problems
and have the revised files posted by Monday A.M. (I\'ll post on the TML
when I have the files fixed).  Unfortunately, I\'m up in Seattle fixing my
parents\' computer (obviously, I have done a good job so far!), and won\'t
be back in Portland until late this afternoon.

Thanks for all the positive feedback, and the interest!  :)

You have a point.  I\'m assuming that Imperial Citizens make up a small
proportion of the population.  Come to think of it, the proportion of Roman
Citizens (1-2%) about matches that of Imperial Nobles, so possibly I should
shift this to nobles.

In any case, you are correct about infuriating the locals.  Now think what
the local Imperial Resident would do to you if you screwed up Imperial
relations.  If a group of players (or young louts) decided to stand on their
rights, I would have the Imperial Resident (a noble with the right of low
justice) hit them with a much worse penalty for "interfering with Imperial
relations" (which in my game can escalate into a charge of subversion, which
is treason).

Most players would take the local penalty!

That takes care of the young louts.  What of actual residents and more
serious crimes? 

Well, I play characters are full individuals, which means that they have NPC
friends who matter to them, families, and so on.  People like this don\'t want
to be banished, so they act accordingly.  But then, in my game guns are
rarely used even to threaten, and usually not fired, so the situation rarely
arises.

Good point.  I was envisioning 1-2% citizens.  Gradually, taxes would get
imposed even on citizens as citizenship spreads.  That was in fact one reason
why the Roman emperor (still can\'t remember which one) extended citizenship
to all.  He also made citizens liable for taxes, which meant that he had just
increased his tax base rather than lowered it.

You are correct, I am using the standard 500kg per displacement ton.  I guess
maybe I should specify mass as well as volume.  I just assumed that people
using CSC (the software) would own CSC (the book).  Possibly I should allow
the user to specify both volume of the cargo bay and mass that the vehicle is
rated to carry?

And to think that CSC was just a \'quick hack\' until I was ready to write
FFS2!

That\'s nice.

>Why the switch to one-ton?

No reason.  I\'ve always used a variety of standard sizes (and they became
canon when DGp published my cargo container designs as an equipment sheet). 
The Ralston lifts 1 ton containers.  I\'ll design a 4 ton lifter sometime,
too.

	"Close to lightspeed" ... so the communications device would be somewhat

corresponded to a _simultanteous_ movement at that end.

	No argument there, and I think that\'s *exactly* what Heinlein was trying
to get through in many of his books. But too many people _think_ of rights
as absolutes, with no strings attached.

	Not quite. The death penalty _as a concept_ itself was never ruled
unconstitutional, so there was no need to "pack" the court to change that.
However, most states _implementations_ of the death penalty were held to be
unfairly or improperly applied, violating the constitutional right to due
process.  States which rewrote their laws _and_ the way they carried them
out had those later statutes upheld.

Oooooh, yes. And the United States started the war in the Pacific, by
thoughtlessly leaving its ships where the Japanese bombs were falling at
Pearl Harbor.

I hold Leroy and JP DIRECTLY responsible for the flame wars at HIWG, for
almost bringing that list to its knees and for driving out some people
who\'s opinions in matters regarding Traveller I hold highly. I didn\'t say
much about it then to try and keep things calm, but I\'ll be damned if this
historical revisionism will fly here.

Harold may not be the most tactful person in the world, but the flame was
was NOT his fault.

While I may not post a lot here, there are some who know me from other
mailing lists. I like to think that I\'m reasonable in all things. But this
is beynd the pale.

Grow up, Leroy.

Both would be good, but I think both of them more cry out for serial
treatment. I think "Research Station Gamma" or "Twilights Peak" would be
good as well, "Divine Intervention" would be another good choice, easy to
extend out.

I don\'t have a specific number for you, but I suspect it was darn low.  If I
could persuade you that 1st century AD is "meaningful", and Paul\'s example in
the New Testament is relevant enough, the examples of his being captured,
jailed, beaten, or otherwise tortured several times in the Palestine area,
Asia, and Greece are telling.  

Roman citizens obviously had special privilege, but it didn\'t seem to be on
the "to ask" list for interrogators.  You can argue this several ways, but
one possibility is that it was a low enough chance of ever needing to capture
a Roman citizen that it didn\'t usually enter their head.

Here is a pertinent out-take from my study NIV, the note that accompanies
Acts 22:22-29 (specifically verse 28):  There were three ways to obtain Roman
citizenship:  (1) receive it as a reward for some outstanding service to
Rome;  (2) buy it at a considerable price; (3) be born into a family of Roman
citizens.

Use this however you can!

For more enlightened cultures where Gambling is not a state sponsored 
venture, then I would say it would be classified as a crime against 
society... degree of crime would be proportional to the number of 
participants enticed into the gamble.

OASS, has anyone noticed _The Postman_ is being advertised on TV as coming

Bad.  Suppose they would have you bow down and worship them, to
the extent of blood sacrifice?

The "Do unto others" maxim really is intended to refer to
_ethical_ behavior, not _physical_ treatment.  Thus, the original
maxim should be acceptable without change - but if you want to
misinterpret it, instead of changing it so thoroughly, add a
caveat to the effect "subject to the biosocial imperatives of the
race with which you are treating".

Which is, in essence, the same thing as the "Do unto others"
maxim, _properly_ interpreted.

Intelligent as defined how, and by whom?

So, my right to self-determination overrides my theoretical

Believe it or not, this isn\'t as clear as one might think (I
_know_; I wrote it).  If we ignore, for the moment, the
non-humans of the Imperium, this clause does not necessarily
grant citizenship-on-birth to _any_ human being in Milieu Zero;
Terra is not a member of the Imperium at that time, and humans
aren\'t "native" to any planet other than Terra.  Granted, this
doesn\'t really square with "ordinary" usage of the term, but...

Under this interpretation of the clause, if a member planet
_explicitly_ naturalizes its residents/citizens (by its own
definition), then those who are explicitly naturalized _do_
automatically become Imperial citizens, upon naturalization.

Now, when Terra is incorporated into the Imperium, things get
interesting - at that point, _all_ humans in space, anywhere, can
be considered to instantly and automatically become citizens -
including all Sword-Worlders, Daryen, Zhodani, Dynchia, et
cetera.  An even better twist: since Vargr are _also_ native to
Terra, the incorporation of Terra into the Imperium makes all
Vargr citizens of the Imperium, as well.

See above - if you\'re born on a member world, you\'re not
necessarily a citizen - unless an Imperial proclamation or a
binding precedent established by case law says you are.
Naturalization or swearing fealty, however, _does_ automatically
imply citizenship.  Taking the Emperor\'s Credit is a different
issue, however - I take the City of New York\'s dollar (and have
sworn an oath to uphold etc. the laws and charter of the City of
New York [I am an employee of the Police Department]), but I am
_not_ a citizen of the City of New York - I would have to become
a _resident_ of the City of New York to achieve citizenship and
all rights, privileges, etc., pertaining thereto.  I still have
the obligation to pay taxes to the City, though, as well as an
extortion payment that quacks like a tax, but isn\'t legally
considered a tax.

No - unless Terra is a member of the Imperium, in which case you
_are_ a citizen.  Homeworld status is uncertain.

No - unless that planet explicitly says that anyone born aboard a
ship registered to that planet is a _naturalized_ citizen.

No - unless your mother\'s homeworld explicitly says that anyone
born to a mother who considers that world to be home is a
_naturalized_ citizen.

No - unless that planet explicitly naturalizes you, or explicitly

This is the only _automatically_ true statement - unless Terra is
a member of the Imperium.  In which case you _are_ an Imperial
citizen of the Imperium, but may not be a citizen of any member
planet.

>6) An Imperial Citizen who may or may not have citizenship from a

No - unless Terra is a member of the Imperium, in which case,
yes.

Of course, all of the above is subject to interpretation of the
paragraph from the Warrant.  If your Imperium reads that
paragraph differently, the above answers may change.

Th enoble in question will have hsi natural mind-shield up.  also, just
because a certain percentage of the nobility can read minds, it doesn\'t
mean they will be scanning everyone they meet.  That\'d be rude to the
extreme, especially on a fellow noble.

True, but having the magic needle machine on the ground just gives the
enemy something else to shoot at.  A 7kl drop capsule can contain quite a
number of gauss magazines and RAM Grenades; so it is more likely that the
Marines will recieve at least intitial resupply by drop.

THe Army will probably bring down a shop capable of cranking out 4mm
needles as needed, along with all the other Combat Support units found in
any divisons rear area.

the sharp pointy bit that the Imperial Navy uses to make a point to those 
that they need to make a point to.

The Imperial Marines job is to hit fast and to hit hard and then generally 
zip off.  They are also used to make a LZ used to land more supported 
troops (Imperial Army - just a bunch of planetary army units transported by 
the IN as required).

As the IN has a limited budget [after all, those priracy supression ships 
must cost a bit :)] they also use these extremely highly trained and elite 
troops to protect the stuff that needs protection.  However, I think that 
the IN would have it\'s own less well trained and drilled troops to act as 
shore patrols and run-off-the-mill ship security details otherwise they 
waste IM troops in roles they are not suitable for (The Edge that keeps 
them elite also makes then more likely to "overreact" in some situations).

As for clothing etc.. I always have the Imperial Marines wearing the 
highest levels of Armour appropriate for the task.

Shipboard duties would be a mix of off duty fatigues with guard duty being 
in light battledress(powered) with rapid response units in full Marine 
Battledress(Enhanced).

Embassy guard being in full Marine Battledress(Enhanced) with a rapid 
response team in Heavy Marine Battledress(Enhanced).

In an aside I think that the Marine Armour units (i.e. tanks) would tend to 
be quite rare and only dropped from specialist Marine Carrier ships while 
normal drop troops (aka Starship Troopers) could be dropped from a variety 
of ship classes (perhaps even in units as small as a platoon).

I think that when you see a Marine he is either off duty or In Powered 
Armour.  Just my opinion based on  elite troops being in shortish supply 
(Almost anybody can be a ship troop - but a Marine takes something a little 
bit better).

Notes:
The City of Philadelphia is an experiment in the use of FFS2 and Andrew
Akins excellent Excell spread sheet.

The City of Philadelphia isn\'t exactly a city, more like a small town, with
a population of 7000. This is an example of one of the gypsy Free Trade
clans that operate in the area of my campagn (somewhat rimward of the futere
Solomani Sphere). The ship is there home, from which they trade among a
cluster of star systems.

The 20, 200 ton shuttles are used to skim and process fuel for the massive
vessel, which takes over 2 monthes to refuel! During that time the 2,300 20
ton launches (which also serve as lifeboats) can be used to explore plants,
trade, transport the ship\'s population for R&R, examine asteroid belts for
raw materials, etc.

In the case of the City of Philadelphia much of the Life Support area is
used for hydroponics, providing atmospheric and waste recycling and
supplimenting the food supply. In additon there are gymnasium and
garden/pool areas incorperated.

This isn\'t an economical ship, by Trav\'s rules, (I haven\'t been able to
design a ship yet that doesn\'t operate in the red, this one is about as
close as I\'ve come!). It\'s a neat vehicle for PC parties to operate from,
however, and the Gypsy Culture is interesting, (more on that in later
posts). At any rate it does show some of the possibilities and flexability
available with FFS2.

Until now I\'ve been very vague in discribing the City class ships, with
Andrew\'s spread sheet I\'ve now got a more concrete concept. I can\'t wait to
start on deck plans! I intend to keep trying to refine this ship, so
comments are more than welcome.

Interesting take..  I\'ve always seen the Imperial Army as being organized
along the lines of the United States\' National Guard.  To briefly explain
for the non-US on the list, each state of the union raises and maintains
it\'s own small Army for defense and disaster work.  The federal government
subsidizes and helps trains these units, and can call on them in times of war.

Since each member world is responsible for it\'s own ground defenses, the
Imperium equips a certain percentage (10% works well for me) as Imperial
units, complete with hi-tech standard equipment and training.  This gives
the planetary government access to the best available without an out of
pocket expense, they just have to pay wages and facility costs.

Naturally, units from odd worlds are going to be more specialized.
However, the Imperial units will have access to training of other worlds of
the Subsector, (via the Subsector navy, whose main job it is to provide
heavy lift) this can be alleviated to some degree.

It also seems to me that the highest real organization level that would
handle operations would be the Subsector, since every Subsector faces
unique strategic and tactical problems.  Sector and higher headquarters
would act as money funnels and coordinating offices for massive operations.

I did an essay on the organization of the Imperial Army from the Grand High
Command on down.. would people like to see it again?

Better re-read the book. The Baron was so fat he needed anti-grav units
to help him move. I can\'t say for sure about the disease. I *think* he
had it in the book, but I\'ve seen the movie far more recently than I\'ve

There\'s a lesser known book by James White (best known for his "Sector
General" stories), I think the title is "Escape Orbit". It\'s about some
POWs in an interstellar war trying to escape from the planet they\'ve
been dumped on.

More to the point, when speaking *individuals* the term "native" refers
to where they were born. This is both the common *and* legal usage.

When referring to a *group* (or race or species) it applies in the
sense you are thinking of.

So while *humans* are not native to Vland, *a* humam may be.

However, "taking the Emperor\'s credit" refers to joining the *military*.
And up until fairly recently, that *was* a means of gaining citizenship
(if you wanted to). 

Also, "citizenship" only applies to nation-states and larger groups (at
least since the Civil war settled to matter of the relationship between
the states and the federal government.

There\'s no such thing *legally* as being a *citizen* of New York. Just
being a *resident*.

Probably correct.

True. However, it is also possible that you are a citizen of your
*father\'s* homeworld. And the two are not even exclusive!

In fact, given the right set of laws on the planets involved, you could
have *triple* citizenship (mother\'s homeworld, father\'s homeworld, and
planet of registry of the ship!)

Oops! Make that *quadruple* or *quintuple*. Going by the example of
Israel, you could have "potential citizenship" on a planet because one
of your parents was a member of the proper race/culture/religion.

Very unlikely that a planet would do that.

Very unlikely. The lawyers have been playing with this sort of thing
for almost 2000 years *now*. They aren\'t going to "loosen" things given
a few more millenia.

Possible.

But it is rather likely that you\'d wind up with *multiple* planetary
citizenship, as noted above.

I think that\'s sort of like Shylock\'s contract. If you went into the

Hiver Manipulations can be argued as undermining the right to
self-determination. 

And K\'kree behavior towards any meat-eating race that\'s weaker than
they are *definitely* qualifies. They are speciesist, and cultural
imperialists.

I\'m not saying he wasn\'t FAT in the book, but he sure wasn\'t having some

the other he\'s a fool.

My own position is this: 
I understand what Douglas posts. He speaks the same language I do (more or
less). 
I have read several of Leroy\'s posts and found myself wondering what they
were about. Perhaps I\'m just missing some shift in my way of thinking -
Leroy, are you Illuminated? but I failed to understand several things Leroy
has said.

(The above sentence is grammatically correct, by the way.)

Now I\'m not some ignorant troglodyte. I have degrees in Engineering and
Teaching. I have written a serious academic work on the latter subject. I
like to think that I\'m not an idiot.

But Leroy... sometimes I have no idea what you\'re talking about. You\'re
never going to convince me of anything if reading your posts has the same
effect as staring into Jumpspace for a few hours. Could you please write in
plain English about somethign useful or else take it off the list?

That was a joke Corporal, or didn\'t you learn how to address a superior

You *wish* I had been a college student all my life.  Let\'s see this is

I love how you can\'t figure me out.  You\'ve tried on several occassions
to hit a nerve, but you don\'t know a thing about me, which just makes me
more impervious (as if I needed to be).

Like I said, it runs in the family.  I was referring to the last time
a Berry suggested taking it off list.  I wrote, --dead air space--, the
sound of a chickening out.  That\'s fine, if you want to be loud and
boisterous, go ahead.

Just refusin\' to be bullied by a non-comm, and a lesser ranked one at that.

Just stand-down Corporal.  That\'s an order!

If you *really* are taking this to private mail, I\'ll be there.  We can
talk about anything you want to.  Just don\'t chicken out.

	Neither question qualifies either of them to be Traveller Gods. The real
question is *who makes sense*? 

	If I can follow a rational thought through a message, then that\'s useful.
If the message contorts and twists itself through several jumpspace
dimensions to come up with something that doesn\'t make sense, then I\'m
likely to disagree with it. If there are glaring irrational holes in it, I
may point them out.

	If the thought actually holds together through an entire series of
messages, instead of doubling back and reversing itself when actually
scrutinized and challenged, it gains credibility. 

	If the thought stands the test of the other knowledgeable, intelligent
participants of the list trying to find fallacies or errors in it, it\'s
useful and valuable. 

	If, in the flow of discussion, the thought not only sticks together,
remains consistent and rational, withstands the bright light of intelligent
scrutiny, AND stays fairly true to the mythical "canon" of Traveller
history and feel, AND adds to _somebody\'s_ enjoyment of the game, then it\'s
priceless.

>Let\'s take a look at what both have done, and decide which is fit to tell

	Calling either one of them a fool is counterproductive and proves nothing
about the positions either holds. An ad hominem attack is logically
fallacious, and really unnecessary.

<Signature snipped>

I changed that to 1000 airlocks, still short by Trav rules, but I picture
the airlocks more as maintence facilities, movement to and from the ship
would be by launch or shuttle.
In the design section I have the cargo broken into 40 bays, I\'m picturing
them matched with the shuttle hangers and cargo transfers happening in the
ship more often the out of it.

Not to mention that I completely forgot sanatary facilities! Awful lot of
people dancing in the corridors! I\'ve attached the revised stats to this
post, added 20 more 200 ton shuttles and bunch of ordinary galleys, sized
for 4 people. The Full galleies I picture as resterraunts. I also played
with the bridge workstations, deviding them by 4 to reflect around the clock
operations. One thing the number of required electronic crew persons
compared to the number of engineers seems odd, by FFS2 formula the ship only
requires 6 electronics while the formula for engineers is over 3000. I\'ve
boosted the electronics to 15 but it still seems light. Does anyone know the
thinking behind electrons crew, are they repair as well as operators? If
they are just operators then it still seems a small number.

It was late last night when I posted the stats so here is the revised
version.

Not in a lead, though, and depending on the plot Norris might be the lead.

Actually, if our hidden adgenda is promoting the *game*, I think we need to
think about a lower level plot with a group of characters in a plot that is
similar to what *we\'d* run in a gaming session.

Twilight\'s Peak: Steve on Kira

I don\'t like playing opposite-sex characters. It confuses the hell out of
me when people do it. I also don\'t think I can play women particularly
well, so I try to steer clear. Usually.

I joined Dominic\'s already-established game with Greg and Allison.
Together, with Jac (Captain) and Rob (gunner) we made five. Dominic had a
couple of pre-generated characters and gave them to Greg and myself.
(Allison rolled her own.) Pregenerated characters suit me because I cannot
be bothered with the hassle of rolling up. I am lazy. By chance, my
character was female but my initial thought was to ignore that. I planned
to play a bloke, as usual.

Dominic introduced the game. We were joining the crew of the Empress
Nichole, which was a few men short of a crew. In particular, it needed a
pilot and an engineer, positions Greg and Allison filled. Me, I was the
steward. Unfortunately, the Captain required that each crew member invest
Cr:15,000 in the "Partnership." I looked at my mustering out benefits:
none. I looked at Greg\'s - he had sixty grand. Hmmm. I had a problem.

(I guess I could have discussed it with Dominic. He would probably have
given the character some cash to allow me to join the crew, but it didn\'t
cross my mind. As far as I was concerned, my character was broke.)

I don\'t know where it came from, but I had a flash of inspiration: "Greg,
let\'s be married. I\'ll play your wife." There was a look of horror on his
face, and he refused. I started getting excited about the idea: I\'ve never
played in a married couple before (I am not married myself) and it struck
me as not only a challenge, but also utterly different. It took me ten
minutes to convince Greg. He agreed reluctantly, with one condition. We
weren\'t really married, but that\'s what we would tell everyone else. Fine.
I didn\'t mind. Say hello to Kira (me) and her husband, Art (Greg).

The game started.

To me, Traveller is about ordinary people in a fantastic universe. We\'re
not heroes saving the world, we don\'t have awesome powers and abilities.
We\'re simply a bunch of people trying to scrape a living. That\'s Traveller
at its best - and it\'s a good description of Dominic\'s game. Twilight\'s
Peak is in there somewhere, but mostly it\'s restaurants, hangovers, cargo,
fuel, management theory and business practice. Up until our first and only
firefight the only combat situation occurred when Hunter (Rob\'s gunner)
provoked Tlankhu (Allison\'s Aslan engineer) and was cuffed as a result.
Hunter pulled a gun which resulted in disciplinary hearings and Hunter
being sacked. Characters wander around in dressing gowns, clutching cups of
coffee rather than wearing cloth and brandishing snub pistols. As I said,
ordinary people.

I don\'t know if playing a wife changed my perceptions, but I became aware
of a blindspot in Traveller (actually, in most games). The thing about
ordinary people is that their lives are dominated by relationships. Couples
are everywhere. Girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, wives - the world is
full of them. Yet what I find remarkable in Traveller is the sheer absense
of relationships. I don\'t mean rules and tables for determining star signs
and compatibility, but just that the feel of the game (in its adventures
and descriptions) ignores relationships.

Marriage seems particularly alien. I cut my roleplaying teeth on Traveller
but I don\'t ever remember reading anything that suggested that people got
married. Staterooms, for example, seem mighty cramped when you\'re sharing!

I put these thoughts aside (they had no effect on the game) and continued
playing.

A few weeks later I was chatting with some friends and they jokingly
suggested that I should become pregnant to spook Greg. I laughed, but the
idea lodged in my mind. I already knew that Kira\'s goal was to raise enough
money so she could settle down and raise a family (ordinary people,
remember). I was already paying close attention to the book-keeping. And
pregnancy, even unplanned pregnancy, seemed appropriate enough. (And hell,
if I was going to the trouble of playing a woman, why not go the distance?)

Of course, if Traveller lacked when it came to accommodating married
couples, families were right out. Yet where are the family-run Free
Traders? Ships with kids aboard, ships passed down from generation to
generation. Ships that are homes as well as businesses. Think about it for
a while. I did. So where are they?

Once I had decided that I was going to be pregnant, the trick was finding
the right moment for the announcement. I also discovered (to my surprise)
that it wasn\'t going to be easy. To my surprise, I was nervous.

It was several weeks before the opportunity arose.

Our one and only firefight had far-reaching consequences. Kira wasn\'t
personally involved in the incident, she was brooding aboard the Empress,
but the pivotal moment took place during the escape. In order to appear
"natural" in front of some cops, Art kissed the Captain. It was just a
short kiss, hardly romantic or passionate. The Captain was as shocked as
everyone else. (Actually, it was unlike Art. Unfortunately, Greg was away
and Art had been "loaned" to Nickey who was planning on joining the group.
I don\'t think Greg would have kissed the Captain, but it was too late to go
back.) Comments were rife, particularly concerning what Kira would do to
Art should she ever find out. But, as it happened, everyone kept quiet (at
least, around Kira) and she didn\'t find out. Not for a few weeks, certainly.

The trouble started, as it inevitably does, at a restaurant. I don\'t know
what the Captain was up to, but she was drunk and playing sexual politics.
After blowing hot and cold over Eneri (our new crewmember), she dragged me
aside and told me about The Kiss. That Art snogged her. She sounded
pleased. With nothing more to go on, I assumed the Captain had encouraged
him. My head spun - as we weren\'t really married it shouldn\'t really matter
whom Art kissed. But if Kira was pregnant, now was the time to do something
about it. So I stormed across the restaurant, threw a drink over Art, and
stomped out. The Captain tried to follow, but I made it quite clear that I
wasn\'t happy with her, either. I took a taxi back to the Empress, alone,
and had a good weep.

Back at the restaurant, Eneri decided to see how I was. Unfortunately that
left Art and the Captain alone in the restaurant, which set me off again.
And then Eneri asked, "What\'s the matter? Tell me about it."

It went quiet. Everyone was watching. It was now or never. And I froze - I
had major stage fright. Eventually (it seemed like ages) I blurted "I\'m
pregnant!" Everyone fell about laughing. Bastards! They\'re not supposed to
do that - this is serious stuff. Greg\'s face was a picture - as was
Dominic\'s. I could see him mentally tossing aside any hope of us meeting
the scenario.

As for me, I was stunned. I had said it, and it was the hardest thing I
have done in ages. I hadn\'t really recovered before we ended that night.
Art proposed to me (properly) and I accepted and that was more-or-less it
for that week.

What I hadn\'t expected was that announcing the fact that Kira was pregnant
would be so liberating. Afterwards, once I had recovered from the shock, I
felt good. Really, really good - it was a buzz that lasted a full 24 hours.
(I had a great day at work.) Roleplaying has hit me like that once or twice
before, but it\'s a rare feeling. Certainly I would never have imagined that
announcing myself to be pregnant in a noisy, distracting games club would
recreate feelings that have resulted from some of the most intense games
I\'ve played. Remarkable.

And to think that all this arose from a quirk on my character sheet and me
grabbing the opportunity to spook Greg. Of course it backfired on me as
Greg returned the compliment. In spades . . .

Greg was ill the following week, but he had explained to Dominic that he
wasn\'t completely happy with the game. So Art walked out on me. I was,
well, spooked. And then some. Over the next two sessions (covering a mere
48 hours game time - Greg was actually present for the second session) we
scoured the starport but could not find him. Two sessions of me being teary
and upset, the Captain rubbing everyone up the wrong way and Tlankhu, er,
finding her own entertainment. (Trust me, it played better than it sounds.)

Then Art turned up. Just like that. I cried and accused him of leaving me.
His explanation wasn\'t brilliant, and I became more upset. While this went
on, the Captain really upset Tlankhu. Big time. Tlankhu stalked off and
refused to answer her comlink. Gone for good, I thought.

It took a tragedy to bring her back. While I snarled at the Captain,
explaining the finer points of Aslan etiquette, Art searched for Tlankhu.
Then we got a call from the cops. Art had been involved in an incident. Oh
god. Then we were directed to the infirmary. Oh god please no oh god. Art\'s
been injured. He has been knifed, bad. No no no. And - he died. Kira went .
.. . well, she just went. I was stunned, and turned to Greg. "Bastard," I
said.

Tlankhu comforted me at the infirmary, and lead me to where our ship was
being refitted. It turned out that while Art was "missing" he had
redecorated our room. And he had built a wooden cot. More tears, and
Tlankhu left me alone. (I\'ve not done this much weeping in a game before. I
probably wouldn\'t describe Kira as especially emotional. It\'s just the way
it worked out.)

The game wrapped up shortly after that. The Empress jumped and Dominic
called the evening to a close. It seemed clear that it was more than just
the evening though, as cracks were beginning to appear. Tlankhu had had
enough and planned to resign as soon as possible. Kira needed to pick up
the pieces of her life and the Empress Nichole, with a Captain she disliked
and its growing reputation for piracy, probably wasn\'t the best place to do
that.

So there it ended.

We never got to Twilight\'s Peak. We never saw much of Dominc\'s scenario.
The Fifth Frontier War brewed in the background, but it was all
overshadowed by the emotional turmoil generated by a few ordinary people
and their very ordinary problems. And I wouldn\'t have it any other way -
I\'ve not played in such an entertaining game in a long while.

Next week I am playing an immortal elf in a political fantasy. Somehow, and
despite playing a more "fantastic" character, I think it\'s going to be an
anticlimax.

<Steve\'s Story ... Snipped but not forgotten>

Dom,
It\'s funny this came out now. My campaign, barely started, is based on a
"family" run ship, several generations old. It\'s started in an attempt to
get my wife to start playing again. When last she played, a couple of
decades ago, it was in a D&D campaign where we played... a married couple.
Funny now thinking back on it, she used to get mad at me for being too
protectiveof her character, and she was right!

The problem with married people in role playing though (IMHO) is the
situation. I admit that as a rule Traveller is about ordinary people thrown
head long into, often, unusual situations. However, most parents are very
protective of their children, and spouses are the same. Hard to picture a
family, especially with small children, going pirate, or jumping into the
thich of an expedition, dragging the kids along. Not that it can\'t happen,
but I think it\'s rare.

More likely is the situation of one or the other spouce and children at home
worrying. Now in the typical Traveller Free Trader (200-600) tons, visits to
home are few and far between, so having a familly just isn\'t practical.
That\'s for the guys and gails on the regular runs.

Throw in a kingsized ship however, with families aboard and you change the
equation a bit.

Most of the PC\'s in my current game have family ties (yep, I assigned them
to them!) on the base ship. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters etc. So they
have a bit of a push to "protect the ship"< (I have to remind them of the
fact, but the campaign is new, I\'m hoping this will come more naturally in
time). We haven\'t had any romances yet, but I\'m working on one between a PC
and an NPC, a great hook I want to use is the significant other on a trade
mission that gets lost and how the PC handles it.

In all I guess that family and relationships could stand a real boost in
RPGs but it\'s really rare to find a player like Steve that can handle it. I
tend to try and push them more in them more in the way that GURPS does with
dependants to the PC\'s.

Anyway great writeup. Send Steve my compliments.

Unfortunately, the IG website seems to be moribund (the \'News\' is from June!),
the MPGN mailing list pages are inaccessable from their homepage (although you
can get to them through the \'TSR archive\' :/), and the various FAQs seem to
have been last updated in the middle of summer somewhere.

I\'m guessing that this information has been posted to the TML in the past X

anybody fill me in or point me at a current source of information?  Thanks!

You know, this post, although ludicrous, is waaayyy off Traveller and also
poor form. I have a suggestion. If you decide to take something off-list,
just take it off-list. Don\'t announce "Okay, I\'m taking this off list now!"
It\'s just plain immature and silly.

Okay, let\'s turn this to a Traveller post.

6500 feet. Let\'s see, that\'s about, what, 1,981 meters? In a forest.

ObTrav:

First question: Are there TL 7 (marginal TL 8) rifles that have that kind
of accuracy at range, in the hands of a skilled sniper? (This all assumes
you are allowed to use a high-powered rifle for hunting, and have a clear
shot in a forest for almost 2 klicks). Would a 12.7mm rifle do it
(especially since the .50 BMG is such an accurate round)? I know the Barret
Model 82 has the oomph to do it, but I am not sure about it\'s accuracy. I
would think things like turbulence would add up at such a range.

I don\'t have T4. In MT, this is listed as an Impossible task for a rifle
(no matter the type of weapon -- it is in the Distant range band). In TNE,
the 14.5 mm "crunch gun," fired from a bipod, has a range of 300 m (315 m
with a scope), so that\'s extreme range there too, which is also an
Impossible task.

So according to the rules, the chances of doing this are slim and none.
Second question (to the millitary wonks with experience in such matters):
Are the rules accurate on this? My feeling is that they are, but I have
never done such long-range shooting (alas, the gun range I have shot at is
limited to a piddly 100 m or so).

Reasoning: 
advantages
1. Near-future SF setting therefore recognisable to newbies
2. Earth as \'underdog\' vs. immense stellar empire
3. Human ingenuity/cunning wins against bug-eyed monsters (well,
Vilani...)
4. Room for extrapolation of today\'s technology, sociology, politics etc. 
5. Milieu has not been extensively covered in Trav game materials, giving
more creative scope to scriptwriter and director. 
6. Plenty of scope for special FX 
7. No need to dress up Vilani \'aliens\' with plasticene rude bits on their
faces a la Star Trek. Traveller has an explanation WHY the aliens look
like humans, too...! 
disadvantages
1. Not very close to any of the past incarnations of Traveller. 
2. Budgeting - unlikely to attract large amounts of funding. 
3. Sweetpea Entertainment - their last cheque to me bounced, and they\'re
very tardy about replacing it...perhaps they\'ve got money problems?

Pardon my ignorance, as I have little knowledge of transponders in
general. Is Cymbeline chips a sentient ao semisentient being or just a
very complex computerchip? Even if it sentient why can\'t someone enlist it
into their use if the Imperium is capable of it. If the Imperial scientist
enslaved it, I\'m sure that someone with enough resource can "free" it.

What exacly is the transponder sending/recieving? Is it different every

Fascinating post, Leonard. I\'ve been thinking along similar lines for my
Traveller universe, but haven\'t penned anything so specific on the subject.
I\'ve been working towards replacing the concept of \'races\' with \'cultures\',
on the theory that most species are not mono-cultural, and most
interstellar cultures are not mono-specific (i.e. are made up many
species). I want to break free of the Trekish tendency to turn alien
species into racial stereotypes.

Thinking along these lines, I decided that interstellar societies would
have to evolve a set of universal protocols and customs, to facilitate
trade, travel, and cultural exchange between radically alien cultures.
These protocols and customs would then become the basis of an interstellar
"MetaCulture", and legal structures analagous to present-day International
Law. Much the same seems to have occurred to the inventors of the
"MetaLaws" you\'ve described.

But IIRC, you didn\'t tell us *who* came up with these MetaLaws. You mention
them figuring in a science fiction novel, but you didn\'t give its author or
title. Details, please?

Now *that\'s* role-playing. Kudos to your friend Steve for original thinking.

One of the reasons I came up with the "Life Events" generation system
(posted to the list back in the summer) was to help players fill out such
often-neglected aspects of their characters as family history, past
relationships, marriage, divorce, children, and so on. Most Traveller
characters are in their thirties and forties. Only a few of these people
are likely to be loners, celibates, confirmed bachelors, drifters, etc.
Most are going to be typical human (or other) beings, with relationships,
kids, significant others. I tend to assume that a PC starts the game single
and at loose ends, but there\'s no reason they shouldn\'t have a spouse
waiting for them somewhere, or an ex-spouse after them for alimony, or an
on-board relationship (either PC or NPC).

I\'m impressed by Steve\'s attempt to play a \'feminine\' female character; to
make them easier to play, my own female characters tend to be intentionally
rather \'butch\' - in some cases more macho than my male characters! Heh -
and I had the hypocritical gall to blast Verhoeven for his
\'testosterone-pumped\' women!

Thanks for the thought-provoking post.

Twilight\'s Peak: Steve on Kira

I don\'t like playing opposite-sex characters. It confuses the hell out of
me when people do it. I also don\'t think I can play women particularly
well, so I try to steer clear. Usually.

I joined Dominic\'s already-established game with Greg and Allison.
Together, with Jac (Captain) and Rob (gunner) we made five. Dominic had a
couple of pre-generated characters and gave them to Greg and myself.
(Allison rolled her own.) Pregenerated characters suit me because I cannot
be bothered with the hassle of rolling up. I am lazy. By chance, my
character was female but my initial thought was to ignore that. I planned
to play a bloke, as usual.

Dominic introduced the game. We were joining the crew of the Empress
Nichole, which was a few men short of a crew. In particular, it needed a
pilot and an engineer, positions Greg and Allison filled. Me, I was the
steward. Unfortunately, the Captain required that each crew member invest
Cr:15,000 in the "Partnership." I looked at my mustering out benefits:
none. I looked at Greg\'s - he had sixty grand. Hmmm. I had a problem.

(I guess I could have discussed it with Dominic. He would probably have
given the character some cash to allow me to join the crew, but it didn\'t
cross my mind. As far as I was concerned, my character was broke.)

I don\'t know where it came from, but I had a flash of inspiration: "Greg,
let\'s be married. I\'ll play your wife." There was a look of horror on his
face, and he refused. I started getting excited about the idea: I\'ve never
played in a married couple before (I am not married myself) and it struck
me as not only a challenge, but also utterly different. It took me ten
minutes to convince Greg. He agreed reluctantly, with one condition. We
weren\'t really married, but that\'s what we would tell everyone else. Fine.
I didn\'t mind. Say hello to Kira (me) and her husband, Art (Greg).

The game started.

To me, Traveller is about ordinary people in a fantastic universe. We\'re
not heroes saving the world, we don\'t have awesome powers and abilities.
We\'re simply a bunch of people trying to scrape a living. That\'s Traveller
at its best - and it\'s a good description of Dominic\'s game. Twilight\'s
Peak is in there somewhere, but mostly it\'s restaurants, hangovers, cargo,
fuel, management theory and business practice. Up until our first and only
firefight the only combat situation occurred when Hunter (Rob\'s gunner)
provoked Tlankhu (Allison\'s Aslan engineer) and was cuffed as a result.
Hunter pulled a gun which resulted in disciplinary hearings and Hunter
being sacked. Characters wander around in dressing gowns, clutching cups of
coffee rather than wearing cloth and brandishing snub pistols. As I said,
ordinary people.

I don\'t know if playing a wife changed my perceptions, but I became aware
of a blindspot in Traveller (actually, in most games). The thing about
ordinary people is that their lives are dominated by relationships. Couples
are everywhere. Girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, wives - the world is
full of them. Yet what I find remarkable in Traveller is the sheer absense
of relationships. I don\'t mean rules and tables for determining star signs
and compatibility, but just that the feel of the game (in its adventures
and descriptions) ignores relationships.

Marriage seems particularly alien. I cut my roleplaying teeth on Traveller
but I don\'t ever remember reading anything that suggested that people got
married. Staterooms, for example, seem mighty cramped when you\'re sharing!

I put these thoughts aside (they had no effect on the game) and continued
playing.

A few weeks later I was chatting with some friends and they jokingly
suggested that I should become pregnant to spook Greg. I laughed, but the
idea lodged in my mind. I already knew that Kira\'s goal was to raise enough
money so she could settle down and raise a family (ordinary people,
remember). I was already paying close attention to the book-keeping. And
pregnancy, even unplanned pregnancy, seemed appropriate enough. (And hell,
if I was going to the trouble of playing a woman, why not go the distance?)

Of course, if Traveller lacked when it came to accommodating married
couples, families were right out. Yet where are the family-run Free
Traders? Ships with kids aboard, ships passed down from generation to
generation. Ships that are homes as well as businesses. Think about it for
a while. I did. So where are they?

Once I had decided that I was going to be pregnant, the trick was finding
the right moment for the announcement. I also discovered (to my surprise)
that it wasn\'t going to be easy. To my surprise, I was nervous.

It was several weeks before the opportunity arose.

Our one and only firefight had far-reaching consequences. Kira wasn\'t
personally involved in the incident, she was brooding aboard the Empress,
but the pivotal moment took place during the escape. In order to appear
"natural" in front of some cops, Art kissed the Captain. It was just a
short kiss, hardly romantic or passionate. The Captain was as shocked as
everyone else. (Actually, it was unlike Art. Unfortunately, Greg was away
and Art had been "loaned" to Nickey who was planning on joining the group.
I don\'t think Greg would have kissed the Captain, but it was too late to go
back.) Comments were rife, particularly concerning what Kira would do to
Art should she ever find out. But, as it happened, everyone kept quiet (at
least, around Kira) and she didn\'t find out. Not for a few weeks, certainly.

The trouble started, as it inevitably does, at a restaurant. I don\'t know
what the Captain was up to, but she was drunk and playing sexual politics.
After blowing hot and cold over Eneri (our new crewmember), she dragged me
aside and told me about The Kiss. That Art snogged her. She sounded
pleased. With nothing more to go on, I assumed the Captain had encouraged
him. My head spun - as we weren\'t really married it shouldn\'t really matter
whom Art kissed. But if Kira was pregnant, now was the time to do something
about it. So I stormed across the restaurant, threw a drink over Art, and
stomped out. The Captain tried to follow, but I made it quite clear that I
wasn\'t happy with her, either. I took a taxi back to the Empress, alone,
and had a good weep.

Back at the restaurant, Eneri decided to see how I was. Unfortunately that
left Art and the Captain alone in the restaurant, which set me off again.
And then Eneri asked, "What\'s the matter? Tell me about it."

It went quiet. Everyone was watching. It was now or never. And I froze - I
had major stage fright. Eventually (it seemed like ages) I blurted "I\'m
pregnant!" Everyone fell about laughing. Bastards! They\'re not supposed to
do that - this is serious stuff. Greg\'s face was a picture - as was
Dominic\'s. I could see him mentally tossing aside any hope of us meeting
the scenario.

As for me, I was stunned. I had said it, and it was the hardest thing I
have done in ages. I hadn\'t really recovered before we ended that night.
Art proposed to me (properly) and I accepted and that was more-or-less it
for that week.

What I hadn\'t expected was that announcing the fact that Kira was pregnant
would be so liberating. Afterwards, once I had recovered from the shock, I
felt good. Really, really good - it was a buzz that lasted a full 24 hours.
(I had a great day at work.) Roleplaying has hit me like that once or twice
before, but it\'s a rare feeling. Certainly I would never have imagined that
announcing myself to be pregnant in a noisy, distracting games club would
recreate feelings that have resulted from some of the most intense games
I\'ve played. Remarkable.

And to think that all this arose from a quirk on my character sheet and me
grabbing the opportunity to spook Greg. Of course it backfired on me as
Greg returned the compliment. In spades . . .

Greg was ill the following week, but he had explained to Dominic that he
wasn\'t completely happy with the game. So Art walked out on me. I was,
well, spooked. And then some. Over the next two sessions (covering a mere
48 hours game time - Greg was actually present for the second session) we
scoured the starport but could not find him. Two sessions of me being teary
and upset, the Captain rubbing everyone up the wrong way and Tlankhu, er,
finding her own entertainment. (Trust me, it played better than it sounds.)

Then Art turned up. Just like that. I cried and accused him of leaving me.
His explanation wasn\'t brilliant, and I became more upset. While this went
on, the Captain really upset Tlankhu. Big time. Tlankhu stalked off and
refused to answer her comlink. Gone for good, I thought.

It took a tragedy to bring her back. While I snarled at the Captain,
explaining the finer points of Aslan etiquette, Art searched for Tlankhu.
Then we got a call from the cops. Art had been involved in an incident. Oh
god. Then we were directed to the infirmary. Oh god please no oh god. Art\'s
been injured. He has been knifed, bad. No no no. And - he died. Kira went .
.. . well, she just went. I was stunned, and turned to Greg. "Bastard," I
said.

Tlankhu comforted me at the infirmary, and lead me to where our ship was
being refitted. It turned out that while Art was "missing" he had
redecorated our room. And he had built a wooden cot. More tears, and
Tlankhu left me alone. (I\'ve not done this much weeping in a game before. I
probably wouldn\'t describe Kira as especially emotional. It\'s just the way
it worked out.)

The game wrapped up shortly after that. The Empress jumped and Dominic
called the evening to a close. It seemed clear that it was more than just
the evening though, as cracks were beginning to appear. Tlankhu had had
enough and planned to resign as soon as possible. Kira needed to pick up
the pieces of her life and the Empress Nichole, with a Captain she disliked
and its growing reputation for piracy, probably wasn\'t the best place to do
that.

So there it ended.

We never got to Twilight\'s Peak. We never saw much of Dominc\'s scenario.
The Fifth Frontier War brewed in the background, but it was all
overshadowed by the emotional turmoil generated by a few ordinary people
and their very ordinary problems. And I wouldn\'t have it any other way -
I\'ve not played in such an entertaining game in a long while.

Next week I am playing an immortal elf in a political fantasy. Somehow, and
despite playing a more "fantastic" character, I think it\'s going to be an
anticlimax.

The US Army\'s standard sniper rifle, the M-24 SWS, is accurate out to about
900m on man-sized targets.  That\'s a very accurate 7.62mm.  I don\'t know of
any commercial hunting rifle that would be legal in Germany that would
maintain the ability to drop a full grown deer at the range listed.

Bullets tend to fly straight until they hit something.  Tests have shown
that even light branches will deflect a .50 BMG round, causing a tumble.

In designing weapons for T4, I\'ve found it difficult at best to get a good
long range weapon.  The shot isn\'t impossible, just *highly* improbable.

If the shooter took several turns to aim at a target that was not aware of
the threat, fired from a supported position, with a weapon and ammo load he
was familiar with..  maybe.  I\'d like to know what was used to get a
first-shot kill on a large animal at nearly 2km..  a sabot round?

operating a subsidized liner crewed by three couples and their children.
The youngest couple (Ed, our navigator/broker and Liza our electronics
person) have three children ranging from 1 to 8 years old and are
raising and schooling them on the ship in their off hours. One couple
(Capt. Dan and Laurie, the ships medic) have two teenagers who work on
the ship. The oldest couple (me, Sven, the engineer and Paula, our
security officer) have one adult child and one teenager serving in the
crew, an adult child working in our sales office at one of the key
starports we operate from and a younger child in boarding school back on
our home world. Liza is my sister and Laurie is Ed\'s sister. The ship is
jointly owned by our parents (only two more years left on the mortgage),
etc.

We took the tact that families are vital to any real life situation and
decided to try to play out how operating a family owned and operated
ship would really work in the Traveller universe. The game takes a
different flavor when you are working on something and realize that you
have missed dinner with you wife or when a passenger takes an unwelcome
interest in your spouse...

to collect information on ~16500 worlds.  Most of the information came from the DGP files, the
rest from various sources which I can not remember who came up with in all cases.  The list of
sectors for which I have information for is: Alpha Crucis, Amdukan, Antares, Core, Corridor,
Dagudashaag, Daibei, Dark Nebula, Delphi, Deneb, Diaspora, Ealiyasiyw, Empty Quarter,
Foreven, Fornast, Glimmerdrift Reaches, Gushemege, Gvurrdon, Hinterworlds, Hlakhoi, Ilelish,
Iwahfuah, Ley Sector, Lishun, Magyar, Massilia, Mendan, Old Expanses, Reaver\'s Deep, Reft
Sector, Riftspan Reaches, Solomani Rim, Spica, Spinward Marches, Staihaia\'yo, Trojan Reach,
Verge, Vland, Yiklerzdanzh, Zarushagar.  I do not know the accuracy of all of this data and some
of the sectors contain partial information.  I have all of this data in a fixed format Text file, as well
as a number of other formats.  I can place it in almost any format that anyone wants.

I originally collected the information because I wanted to write a program to reference it during
game play.  I was using a 16MHz 386SX laptop with the data in a MSAccess 2.0 database and a
program written in VB3.  The program was then upgrade to using VB4.  I still have the program if
people are interested.  It was based on the TNE version of Traveller.  It contain the ability to view
the universe, sectors, subsectors, basic world information, track some rudimentary character
information, generate passenger and freight/cargo information (down to individual lots and based
on character skills in the adventure group), generate travel times from world to world through
jump, contains the entire equipment list from the TNE rule book with the ability to show prices,
modified by Exchange Rates for any world (the adventure group determined the original world the
characters started from as a reference point), print the equipment prices, and a few other odds
and ends.  Please be aware that the data is from the 1100 time frame.  I was using TNE rules in
that era.

I am in the process of upgrading the program to run against a MSAcess 8.0 database, using VB5.
The rudiments of the sector and world information viewing are designed and working against the
original MSAccess 2.0 database.  If anyone is interested in this, I could see if I could make it
available.

I am currently working on the data model for the underlying database to support the program.  I
plan on including as much information as possible.  If there is interest from anyone about what I
am doing, I would be more than happy to form a discussion on it.  I will also be asking a number of
questions to the list as I am going through the model and program to better clarify certain details
on how the information available is used and how to best represent it.

As an example, travel zone codes are listed with the main world data.  Travel zone codes,
according to one of the Traveller products, can refer to a government, world or system.  How
should the travel zone codes (specifically Red and Amber) from the main world data be applied?
To the main world only or the entire system?

More questions to follow.  Like I said, if anyone is interested, please let me know.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

For purposes of examining the Army as a mature force, and since it\'s where my campaign is set, the example we will be looking at is the Lunion Subsector of the Spinward Marches in 1105.  To start at the top, we have:

ARMY SUPREME COMMAND (Capital/Core)

This is the highest command authority for the Imperial Army.  This command is concerned with the long range planning and defense of the entire Imperium.  This unit organizes all R&D, mass equipment upgrades, and changes in Army doctrine and regulations.  It has little say in the day-to-day managing of line units; in fact it controls only one unit directly: The Imperial Guard.

DOMAIN COMMAND: DENEB (Depot/Deneb)

Even though the Domain of Deneb does not have an archduke in 1105, the Army maintains a level of command for the purpose of strategic planning "behind the claw."  Officers assigned here have a better focus on the problems and threats facing their area of operations.

Deneb Command also oversees the allocation of Imperial funds to the Sector forces.  Many worlds in the Imperial Core do not bother with extensive military development, and pay into a general fund rather than raising units that are three years from the border in the first place.  The Supreme Command allocates this money as block grants to the domains, who use it to fund projects of local need.  Many times, this money is passed down the line with no strings attached.  This is generally the case in Deneb, due to the wildly varying threats the region faces.

Domain level commands control a small group of elite troops, rarely more than a division, who act as a "fire brigade" for the command.  Since this is traditionally the Marine mission, there is a great deal of friction over these unit\'s existence.

SPINWARD MARCHES HIGH COMMAND (Rhylanor/Rhylanor)

The sector high command is the highest level of command that directly commands regular Army units.  In a wartime situation, units leaving their home Subsector come under the control of the sector command for the duration of their transit.  Leaving this control only when the unit either returns home or is handed off to a local command for combat.  The sector command controls the reserves and logistics for the Army when it mobilizes.

The sector command also distributes funding to the Subsector Armies.  Since planning is done decades in advance, each Subsector force submits an annual update on its projected needs over the next ten years.  Budget allocations are made based on both these figures, and on the needs of the sector as a whole.

The sector command controls the strategic reserve for the sector.  This consists of all Army units out of their home Subsector and in transit, as well as all colonial forces (see below) committed to action.

LUNION ARMY HEADQUARTERS (Lunion/Lunion)

The Subsector Army is the heart of the Imperial defense.  Each Subsector crafts its force to meet its unique needs and threats.  Lunion\'s main threat is seen as the Sword Worlds Confederation.  Most of Lunion\'s planning is based around a series of scenarios concerning a SWC attack on the Spinward worlds of the Subsector.  Subsector command also gathers intelligence about enemy activities and intentions; passing these nuggets of information to Navy Intelligence in an attempt to paint a complete picture of what is happening beyond the Imperial border.

Subsector Headquarters is where the actual purchasing of equipment takes place.  Within guidelines from higher headquarters, each Subsector is pretty free to equip its forces as it likes.  This leads to some oddities, like Five Sister\'s small but potent Army, universally equipped with battledress and fusion weapons.  Lunion has steered a more predictable course; building fairly standard TL14-15 tank and infantry units.  As is true for most Spinward Marches commands, Lunion Army makes sure that all vehicles and personal armor are equipped with mind-shields in case of conflict with telepathic Zhodani troops.

Operationally, the Army HQ coordinates the actions of its forces, plus those assigned to it by higher command, in the defense of the Subsector.  If offensive operations are called for, Lunion forces may be seconded to the assault force at the Sector Command\'s discretion.

The current commander of the Lunion Army is General Oiwaeas, an Aslan from Strouden.  A 30-year veteran, Oiwaeas is a decorated veteran of the 4th Frontier War, as well as innumerable border incidents with the Sword Worlders.  Oiwaeas is much beloved by his troops as a fighting leader, and his sense of humor is legendary.  (During one incident, a Sword World commander insinuated that Oiwaeas need to go to the "cat box."  After learning from an aide what was meant by the insult, Oiwaeas made a point of dumping sand over the defeated SW officer\'s head, remarking "I understand this is the proper thing for a cat to do with its waste."  To this day his personal command vehicle is named CatBox.)

THE STROUDENESE ROYAL ARMY (Strouden/Lunion)

This is where the troops and tanks are found.  Strouden is a Hi-pop, Industrial world of the Lunion Subsector.  Its total population is 8.3x10^9; mostly human with a significant (6%) Aslan minority.  The planet is ruled by a constitutional monarchy.  The Grand Prince controls the various government agencies, who operate as a meritocracy.

Strouden\'s Planetary Defense Force has approx. 7 million soldiers active at any one time.  An additional 5 million can be found as reservists, home guards, and local militias.

10% of the Strouden Army is pledged to the Imperial Army.  These units receive TL14-15 equipment and training.  This amounts to 35 division sized units (25 Lift Infantry, 10 Grav Tank) and a smattering of specialist units (1 Rapid Interface Infantry Brigade, several battalion and smaller Civil Action, Intelligence, Heavy Engineer, etc.)

The remainder of the units are organized as the Royal Stroudenese Army.  This formidable force can field 12 Field Armies equipped to TL13 standard, along with 2 Corps equipped to TL14 (The King\'s Own Guards and The Landing Warders)

The local Imperial units and the RSA engage in regular wargames against one another.  The RSA maintains a training area staffed by troops who use Sword Worlds tactics and equipment for a realistic training environment; and many Imperial units, both Marine and Army have praised it for the realism of the exercises.

Although the Imperial element of Strouden\'s forces is answerable to the Subsector command, the local government always has the right to veto any off-world deployment.  This is a risky move, as it invites Imperial displeasure, and any world making such a stand would best be ready to present a very convincing case before the Moot.

The Imperial Army units on Strouden are fed, paid, clothed, and housed by the RSA.  The Imperium picks up the bill for the high tech equipment and training/deployment costs.  This benefits the Royal government greatly, since they get a resident force at little expense to themselves.

COLONIAL FORCES

In times of great peril, such as a major war, planetary forces may be volunteered for Imperial service.  Such forces are referred to as "Colonial Units," and are generally considered to be of a lesser quality than front-line troops.  Regardless, these troops can take a great deal of pressure of harried commanders by assuming garrison and security roles, freeing up units for the front lines.  Since these are not Imperial units, their equipment and training can vary wildly, making it hazardous to mix them with Imperial units.  During the 4th Frontier War, there was one recorded case of an Imperial Marine point-defense system firing on approaching colonials because their non-standard G-carriers were not in the fire control computer\'s memory.

I get some kind of Deja vu all over again. Someone wrote an article in
Challenge about Imperial law with the same flaws (carbon copy of US law)
and someone sent a letter with almost exactly the same criticism. Have I
entered a timeloop here?
BTW I totally agree with Rob about the Imperiums law only deal with major
crime and crimes comitted against Imperial officials. Dulinor clearly
wanted something more along the lines of the original poster but that was
never mentioned to be "the old ways" of the Imperium.

The idea of local laws ruling over crimes against individuals also makes it
easier to create plots and roleplaying sessions.

You can add more (and with considerable reason on your side, I concede), but
as far as the rules are concerned, the annual maintenance is all you
absolutely must have (Though I believe that FF&S2 includes rules for
calculating how much space you must allocate for so-and-so long time
spent away from a base, am I right?)

You may want to reconsider that if you want to keep your side of the debate
alive at all. Otherwise all a merchant needs to be completely safe is to
reduce his cargo capacity by a few tons and install some turrets. Hey, he
dosen\'t even have to install real weapons in them. That has got to be the
cheapest piracy deterrent proposed yet!

Two points: If the scout moves into a system and settles down quietly, he
can never be completely sure that he wasn\'t observed by an enemy scout.
And while a ship with less-than-factor-A weapons cannot be sure of
destroying even a small ship in one combat round, one with a spinal
mount has a very good chance of doing so. So a quiet scout runs the risk
of being destroyed by a surprise attack. and if he is trying to hide,
the attacker can be sure that he won\'t find a visiting battleship
squadron near the scout when he jumps in. It is a much safer idea to keep
on the move so that you are never within weapons range of any place where
you were a week ago. Second point: It dosen\'t matter that you can be seen
easily, whether it be because you are moving around or because you just
jumped in, because once you are no longer tied to arriving near a planet,
space is so big that you can easily select a spot in the system where the
odds against finding a welcoming committee are literally astronomical. So
you jump in, take sensor readings and jump out again (or stay until some
poor patrol ship has _almost_ reached firing range). All in near-perfect
safety.

>Even if he didn\'t, arming him would be useless unless you expect him to
>fight his way out of the situation.

No, arming him would be useless if you never expected to use the ship
for anything other than scout duty. If you want greater flexibility
you will arm the ship. Not that it would make any difference as far as
dealing with invaders go, since the scout won\'t be anywhere near where
an invader would appear (at least, that must be what he is fervently

This is another of those disputed opinions stated as bald facts. 
They can also count on winning every battle if there are no dispersed
forces at all, only more so. Only difference is that they can win a lot
more if they don\'t need to concentrate _their_ forces. So our dispersed
forces are useful if the enemy shows up in fewer places than he would
otherwise have done. You can\'t claim that this point hasen\'t already
been made (though I must have missed your answer to it).

Bald statement warning: You are wrong. (OK, I\'d better soften that up:
ASAIK there is no mention of a useful jump suppressor at the relevant
TLs. I\'m not even sure that the effect has ever been mentioned in any
Traveller publication).

People in motorboats boarding surface vessels. When was the last time a

value?

Let me guess: People in helicopters swarm up from concealed hangars on
the surface as the ship makes it final approach to the starport...

Hey, it is about as likely as one ship "sneaking" up on another in deep
space...

Just as a point of reference, I\'ll play characters of practically any race
and gender.  I\'ve been told I do a tolerably good job (but there are people
who get a little freaked out by it).

> To me, Traveller is about ordinary people in a fantastic universe.

I\'ve always treated PCs as being a little bit "special".  While not heros
with fantastic powers who save the world, the PCs _are_ the ones that have
the interesting and/or exciting things happen to them, rather than the
average folks who have average lives and nobody really notices (including
them).

But still, I feel that the "slice of life" approach does apply.

In general, a "family" ship would have to be designed slightly differently
from the stock Free Trader ... OR, you could use a stock ship that way, but
wouln\'t be able to cary many (if any) passengers (which would put a major
dent in profitability).

IMHO, there are a few good reasons why the kind of ship that a family lives
in wouldn\'t be commonly seen:
1) For a merchant ship, space is at a premium.  Small kids and non-skilled
   family members cost life-support and take up space that could otherwise
   be earning money*.
2) Space is (relatively) dangerous; in my universe, there was an unspoken
   but fairly continous sentiment that "space is no place for kids".
3) Given the Traveller rules, most player characters tended to be relatively
   old (I think the average age was somewhere between the mid-thirties and
   mid-fourties for most PCs in my games).  Most humans who are going to
   start a family generally do so by about that time.

* Converting 4 tons of cargo space into an extra stateroom costs the ship 
  Cr 4000/trip of lost freight revenue (or presumably even more profits
  from trading).  At a nominal 24 trips/year, that\'s Cr 96,000/year; at the
  approximate equivalency rate ($2US=Cr1), planetside housing looks awfully
  attractive for the spouse and kids.  Even moreso when you look at the life
  support costs for a year.

I\'ve assumed that a good fraction of the crew of ships that have regular
runs have a family "planetside" on one of the worlds they serve.  This
obviously applies only to crewmembers aboard ships with regular runs and
good (and steady) pay.  For folks who have a family, this is the sort of
job that\'s most appealing (and also the one that\'s got a low adventure
potential).

So, at least in my universe, ship crews for "tramp*" ships tend to be single
or childless couples (childless because they either haven\'t had kids yet,
or had them long enough ago that they\'re on their own, or don\'t intend to
have kids at all).  These are the folks that have the adventures.

* Spacehand slang term for a ship that doesn\'t have a regular run, but
  instead jumps from world to world at the whim of the captain and the
  available traffic.

I\'ve had a few characters that were in some sort of "couple" relationship:

A Vargr character of mine (Dr. Gzoe Zanore, MD) was the ship\'s surgeon on
a free trader*.  He had a long-running (and usually long-distance) relationship
with a female Vargr who was a "boomer"+.  They met when she was with his
ship, and they usually managed to meet every few months when they were both
at the same world for a while.  The campaign ended just about when she got
pregnant (funny thing, that).

* You should be asking yourself "Why does a free trader need a surgeon,
  particularly one who specialized in space medicine and trauma?".  The fact
  that he was doubled as the ship\'s #2 laser turret gunner may give you
  a clue.

+ Spacehand slang term for a crewmember who doesn\'t hire on "permanently",
  but hires on for a few jumps or until she gets a better offer.  Most
  captains don\'t like to hire boomers, but (particularly when trade is
  booming and there\'s a shortage of skilled crew) sometimes they have to.

I\'ve also played an ex-scout who ran a detached-duty scoutship; the
archetype of the "laconic scout" stereotype, he was a good pilot and a
competent engineer, but almost useless as a navigator.  I don\'t know how or
where (we never played it out), but he had a shy, mousy sort of woman as the
navigator.  She was an unpaid volunteer (but a permanent crewmember), and
clearly in love with him.  He was (of course) oblivious, and she was to shy
to say or do anything about it, so she followed him around the Marches in a
scoutship that was old enough to be a museum piece, and hoped that he\'d
notice her someday.

It is also completely contrary to canon which has pirate ships show up in
backwater systems a lot oftener than that.

I played around with that for bit, and I didn\'t see where the gain in

merchant.

If I do an IISS variant, then I\'ll stick great mucking sensors all over it.

No, but it is quite difficult to find a system that isn\'t within one jump
of a Class A starport or a naval base, which is surely where it would be
if it wasn\'t stationed in a marginal system.

David, you can _never_ be sure that you are not jumping into a system that
has already been been taken. That is one of the crucial problems facing an
admiral in a Traveller universe. That\'s why it dosen\'t make sense to jump
into a system with empty tanks unless you absolutely, positively have to.

You think it dosen\'t make sense to station your ships close to where they
are maintained, but you think that stationing patrol ships away from their
base would be prohibitively difficult? Could you please make up your mind?
Is it easy to maintain ships away from bases or is it hard?

David, a warship with proper armor can beat up many times it\'s own tonnage
in ships with no armor, even if computers and armament are identical. And
we\'ve already mentioned the downside in installing arms and high performance
computers in merchants. Sure, it can be done, and the resulting ships are
a bigger help than if they hadn\'t any arms at all, but that dosen\'t mean
that they are anywhere near as useful as a proper warship costing the same
amount of money. And you are the one who keeps insisting that the Imperium
would want the best value for their money, right?

That reminds me of a standing joke in my role playing group: "We advance

committed himself to the attack?

Not according to the rules.

Precisely. So why dosen\'t he select a spot where the chances of finding a
patrol ship waiting are very low and jump in there, make his observations,
and get out before an enemy ship can get within shooting range? (You do
realize that detection ranges tned toi be longer than weapon ranges, don\'t
you?

Not unless he is a total incompetent. You _never_ jump into a system with
empty tanks if you can help it.

Why do you repeat this as a bald statement of truth? Just by reading
elsewhere in the very same message you are responding to you must 
realize that it is at least disputed (Actually it is a bald truth 
that you CAN\'t pick off ships before they can jump away with modest
sized forces. You need at least cruisers to have even a chance of
picking off ships. If you play by the canonical rules, of course).
 
>Well, if the attacking force knows that you have disperesed their fleets,

And if you haven\'t dispersed some of your smaller ships (_not_, and I know
I\'ve pointed this out to you numerous times before, all you fleets), then
they know that they can take a single ship and mop up. How you can
seriously suggest that this is an advantage is beyond me...

>As to being able destroy a ship before it jumps. If you are moving your

The first thing a patrol ship does when it arrives on station is to top
up its tanks. That can\'t be too difficult to realize.

>Regarding picking off the forces by jumping in, it is canon that you can
>jump in an defeat a local force.

In the sense that you can destroy them OR drive them off, yes. Any other
canonical example I\'d like to have a page reference to.
 
>If it wasn\'t true, then much of Traveller military history is wrong.

Examples, please. I\'d bet that they consist of capital ships duking it
out, not auxiliary vessels.

The main weakness of the design is the lack of armor. While this is not too
much of a problem when faced with armed merchantmen with low-factor computers,
it becomes a serious handicap against proper warships. I\'ve given all ranks
single staterooms because the ship may have to be stationed away from a base
for months at a time; if you change that to double occupancy you get 20 T
more space which, combined with the cargo space, will allow 3 points of armor.

Here is another design that trades off acceleration and agility and cargo
space for armor:

will be about 30% cheaper and have 69 T more cargo space. The difference
comes from the more efficient armor, power plants, and fuel purifiers at TL
15. Of course, no one would design warships with that amount of unused space,
but it\'s interesting nonetheless, don\'t you think? It would be cheaper for a
TL 12 world to buy their ships from a nearby TL 15 world than to build them
themselves, even accounting for the different strength of their currencies...

However, here is a TL 15 patrol cruiser that utilizes the extra space:

Note that the power plant size isn\'t strictly according to the rules. I see no
reason why you shouldn\'t be able to build power plants wich produce fractions
of a power plant number. 


Here is a SDB design for when you only need to patrol your own system. The
variant with armor factor 17 will cream an awful lot of standard corsairs...

The main difference in price will lie in the armor. The per-T cost of armor
goes up as the armor factor goes up. Here are four variants:

Be careful, MJ. Leroy\'s standard response to any indication that his

The basic problem with MetaLaw is that it is trying to be a system of ethics
and proper behavior. As such it doesn\'t reflect the unfair or difficult to
comply with laws which favor special interests. ie. Casino Gambling. State
Lottery monopolies. Fixed prices for gold. The labyrinthine IRS tax code.
Funding for sports complexes. Speed traps. Apartheid. Slavery. The draft.

One of my best friends from my service days, George Thompson (MSgt, US Army,

me that this claim, while not impossible physically (i.e. a rifle bullet can
travel that far), it is beyond the limit of human control...no one currently
in the US military is capable of such a shot in his opinion. 

He did however, postulate a possible way this could be done...someone could
drop a rifle bullet from a aircraft at 6500ft and MAYBE hit a man sized
target!!!  :-)

He also asked what kind of forest had such long visibility lines...a
dandelion forest perhaps??

Summary

<The players have just completed a survey mission for the scout service
which has lead them to travel half way across the subsector and back again.
The journey was not uneventful, the group having run across the New Order
pirate group, thwarting one of their operations.They had also acquired a
prototype military spec point defense laser system from the pirates, which
was installed on their ship, the type S Scout Aurora. The only other major
problem encountered was an atempted hijacking, which appeared to be linked
back to the Pirates.The group returned to Regina, and decided to break up.
Hunter and Virgo to move on to a business operation on an old far trader
that Virgo had an option on, Colt went his own way, and Blueberry took the
Aurora to carry on travelling and surveying. >

Virgo concluded her negotiations, and arranged a loan to cover the payment
of the 250,000 Cr fines owed on the Empress Nicholle. She decided that the
other crew didn\'t need to know about this, and that the 15kCr/month could
be easily lost in the operating expenses. This done, she arranged for the
package from the Aurora to be installed in the starboard turret, and took
possession of the Empress. The ship proved to be in reasonable condition,
albeit in need of some work on the decor and the drive systems. The jump
governer was damaged, and the Jump2 level system was complete shot. This
resulted in the ship being unable to achieve anything better than a one
parsec jump.

Fortunately, the present location of the ship at Luck Gibson Down in the
Regina system on the Spinward Main meant that this was not really a
problem. The fee (in excess of three million credits) to replace the jump
governer was another matter. The initial survey done, and their personal
effects installed aboard the ship, the crew headed out to celebrate at the
Starman\'s Rest. This was a predominantly scout service bar, but the crew
had fond memories of it, as they had started out from there 3 months ago.
They overheard an argument over the truth of the story of Twilight\'s Peak,
and Virgo followed it up the next day with some research, which resulted in
her finding a poem of dire quality, which the computer summarised with the
two words \'We died\'.

the Campaign.

Traveller Campaign - the first part:

What has gone before?

Following a chance meeting between two groups (James Hunter and Virgo
Epstein, and Blueberry and Ex-Lt Colt) in a bar fight at Regina Downport, a
job offer ensued from the Scout Service Officer they rescued. This job
involved surveying systems throughout the Spinward Marches Sector using a
detached duty Scout-Courier (the Aurora), and reporting back to the nearest
Scout Base. Additionally, an extra payment was offered if a dead body was
carried to the planet Yorbund for burial.

The party set off to corewards from the sector capital Regina, and the
journey was uneventful until they reached the Forboldn system, site of the
biggest colonisation drive in the Marches. The starport facilities were
basic, so the group dived the Aurora deep into the gas giant Forboldn IV to
scoop in hydrogen gas as fuel.  On exiting the atmosphere of the gas giant,
the sensor systems detected a strange blip within the rings of the planet.

Upon investigation, this blip proved to be a class A free trader, the
Rubicon, coupled to a fast cutter, both ships locked in a tumble and
seemingly dead. Boarding the ships showed evidence of foul play, with
pirates from the New Order group having brutally murdered the crew of the
Rubicon with the aid of an insider. An argument had ensued and the pirates
appeared to have killed each other by opening the cargo bay doors and
decompressing the ship (1). The Rubicon appeared to be a covert Imperial
Courier, carrying a prototype weapon system which was missing (2).

The players fought off a pirate follow up attack using the ship\'s laser and
close in combat on the Aurora. Colt was badly wounded. They then flew and
landed at Forboldn Down, and reported the incident to the local Imperial
Navy Liason Officer, a Commodore John Snape. During the conversation, Virgo
managed to offend the officer, and the whole crew (bar Colt who was in the
hospital) managed to spend the week in prison while their report was
investigated.

Fortunately for the crew, their story was (substantially) true, and they
were released with a warning about their attitude. On returning to the
ship, the group found a message from two gentlemen. Following discussions,
it was agreed to provide passage to the nearest X-boat link waystation
(Feri) for 15KCr. Cargo from the passengers was limited to hand baggage,
and they had to share a single stateroom. Everything went well, the
passengers keeping to themselves until the Aurora completed frontier
refueling in the Whanga system, when an unidentified gig ordered them to
heave to and prepare to be boarded. Simultaneously, the two passengers were
revealed to be pirates, and seized control of the engineering section,
knocking Blueberry out.

The Aurora ran for jump, being rapidly overhauled by the gig. A vicious
gunfight ensued in the accomodation section of the ship, leaving two dead
pirates and a badly injured Hunter. Virgo and Colt took the ship into jump
just as the pirate gig came into firing range.

The group reached the Feri system, and handed over the bodies at the Scout
base. The Aurora was impounded while the records on ship were reviewed.
Meanwhile, Hunter developed a meaningful relationship with the local scout
liason officer, Angela Cartwright. Virgo received an xmail messae from her
father\'s attorney, requesting a meeting at Regina Downport at her earliest
convenience.

Records cleared, the ship took off and headed to Yorbund, encountering a
Imperial Naval Cru-Ron conducting live fire exercises at Beck\'s World.

Yorbund reached, the body was handed over to the relatives, and the crew
decided to leave, having taken one look at the dismal, cavebound lifestyle
of the planet. More drama ensued at take off from Marion Starport\'s
Caverns. As the ship lifted, the port suffered from an earth tremor, which
triggered warning lights on the ships\' systems. On achieving orbit, no
damage was evident to the ship. There was, however, an interesting sensor
image showing a strange complex revealed through a rare break in the
clouds. As the only settlement on Yorbund was at the starport, this was a
new discovery!

So the group decided to ignore this and back to Regina, swayed by the
strong arguments of Virgo that she had to be back there as soon as
possible. The route back was fairly uneventful (they encountered the Naval
CruRon at Feri, where there were reports of extensive civil disturbances).
Finally, the group reached Regina Down on 158-1105, one hundred and fifteen
days after they originally left.

On arrival, Virgo had a discussion with her father\'s attorney, and
announced that she was leaving the Aurora to start a merchant business (3).
Hunter agreed to leave with her. Colt, increasingly paranoid went his own
way, and Blueberry set off with his flobee to continue surveying the
Marches.

End of the first part
(1) Virgo is in possession of the datapad of the lead Imperial Agent.
Unfortunately, this is encrypted and has yet to be broken.
(2) Actually, the players installed this on the Aurora in place of the beam
laser system in the turret.
(3) Taking the highly illegal weapon system with her!

I suppose it depends on what the ship\'s main mission in life is. Science sensors
are better for detecting planets around nearby stars, determining if there
is life on those planets (again from several parsecs range). In-system
they\'re better for determining the properties of planets from some distance
away (like figuring out which planet is the habitable one...); close up they\'re
better for doing minerology and biological studies from orbit. So, if the
ship is likely to often be dealing with uncharted systems a science sensor is
probably worth the investment. If it is mostly going into potentially-hostile-
but-charted systems it\'s probably not worth it (although adding the science
upgrade to the existing sensor isn\'t *that* expensive...)

Oh come on now!

The Imperium is not a liberal democracy. And I just cannot see them as being
politically correct on the environment. Any type of non-democracy  (and a
lot of democracies) does not give two shakes of a rat\'s ass about the
environment. Increasing industrial production is all that matters (see late
20th C Terran history, USSR) Why else are ALL industrial worlds tainted.
They might have laws on the books to "get" worlds that step out of line, but
they would certainly not give damn about a world being polluted unless it
was the hunting preserve of some high noble.

Imperial laws should cover member world interactions, interstellar trade and
imperial precedence and privilege. A murder on a world is that world\'s
problem. If a person flees then it is the Imperium that acts as a go-between
for the two worlds involved. 

As far as crimes like heresy, non-definite assault and such, the Imperium
would let individual worlds deal with it. And as afr as overall religious
crimes, the Imperium strikes me as a very secular state. This is not because
they would not want a single religion, it is because with 11000 worlds with
trillions of citizens you will have...well....one hell of a lot of different
religions. Look here on Earth, and we are opn the same bloody planet!

Space Settlements: A Design Study

Space Settlements: A Design Study, provides information on space settlement
development and education and assists teachers and students in the NASA
Ames Space Settlement Design Contest (see the Space Settlement Web Site).
The design study was the result of a 10 week program in engineering systems
design held at Stanford University and Ames Research Center in the summer
of 1975. Participants included professors, technical directors and students
in a variety of disciplines from physical science and architecture to
engineering and social science. The goal (see preface) was to construct a
vision of how people might sustain life in space in a large colony.

The study was copied and placed on the WWW by Bryan Yager with assistance
from Hendrick Lee and Gail Felchle. The project was mentored by Al Globus
and sponsored by NAS (Numerical Aerodynamic
Simulation).

The document (hard copy) is available through NASA/Ames Research Center
Library. For further information contact the reference staff at (415)

I haven\'t done so yet myself, but I know a man who has...  He and his
friends played pocket empires near to each other and tried to develop
them (often at each other\'s expense).  They had no GM.  I passed on your
feedback request since he doesn\'t have internet access - what follows is
my interpretation of what he said.  Many of his comments were
observations on how it worked - he wasn\'t sure if they were intentional
or not.

* First of all, they had fun, which IMO the most important thing.  He
  thought it would have been better with a GM.

* The experience destroyed any tolerance he had for generating starports
  first in UWPs, since the results were so hard to justify.  OTOH, PE
  provided some better justification for many of the T-prime worlds with
  few inhabitants.

* Building up the population base is a tediously long, slow process.  In
  contrast, if you manage to take over another empire yours can grow
  suddenly.  He compared this to the results of the Interstellar Wars,
  and speculated that Terran expansion without the conflict with the
  First Imperium would have been very gradual.

* The rules for Popularity were unclear on whether the changes should be
  cumulative or reset each turn.  They played it cumulatively, and found
  that they tended to get more and more unpopular as time went on
  because of the bias that way in the table.

* The rules for Diplomacy were inadequate for unrefereed play.

* It was not clear how to set up Stakes fairly.  Also, the idea of
  stakes that could be freely transported at the start of the game
  seemed at odds with how resource allocation worked during play.

* Low-population worlds were pretty useless.  They provided little and
  could be taken over by an opposing empire without difficulty because
  of the enormous influence numbers of people has.

* Combat seemed to be exclusively attrition-based.

He was interested to see what other feedback there was, as indeed am
I...

Gunnery sergeant Carlos Hathcock made that shot with a tripod mounted M2
BMG equipped with a surveyor\'s telescopic sight in Vietnam.  He was also
fifing off a mountaintop, and had the advantage of plunging fire.

Note that the shot is a legend among snipers, as is the time he and his

Life Events = Character Background Generation System

by Glenn Grant <neo@total.net>

I\'m one of those players who likes to know as much as possible about their
character before the game starts. I want to know everything about their
homeworld, the culture they were born into, what happened to them when they
were young, what kind of family they had... anything that will help make
the character live and breath as a unique and interesting individual.

Like most players, I like to let my creativity fly, sparking ideas from my
UPP stats, homeworld skills and UWP, background skills, career history, and
so on. A detailed homeworld write-up can be a source of lots of character
development ideas, and if it isn\'t a world drawn from the game setting,
I\'ll work with the referee to quickly sketch out the world\'s physical
environment and cultural profile. Culture determines many aspects of the
character\'s family - is it a small nuclear family, or a huge extended clan?
It is dominated by one or the other sex? Healthy or dysfunctional?
Eventually a general character history suggests itself.

Still, there\'s a lot about the character I don\'t know. For more
information, I\'ll need a detailed history of virtually everything they\'ve
ever experienced. Well, why not? Why not invent a system for sparking ideas
for detailing major formative experiences and turning points in the PC\'s
life?

The Life Events generation system is designed to serve this need. Don\'t
expect it to do all the work for you: it\'s only intended to give your
imagination a jolt in the right direction. It provides vague general
suggestions which you\'re expected to flesh out in detail.


The System

The Life Events system consists of twelve short tables: six "Personal
Development" tables and six "Transformative Events" tables. These labels
are highly arbitrary: they could just as easily be called Group One and
Group Two. Similarly, the tables themselves have vague names, some of them
redundant or meaninglessly broad: Single Life, Love Life, Relationships,
Career, Finances, Health, Change, Discover, Law & Crime, Turning Points,
Social Conflict, and Major Event. Below the twelve events tables, there are
few extra tables - I\'ll describe them in a moment.

Depending on how much detail you\'re looking for, or how much time you want
to spend on the process, you can roll up a separate event for each year of
the character\'s life, or for each two year period, or for each five year
period. It\'s up to you. But one event per year is usually more than enough
for an eventful life history.

You can skip the PC\'s first twelve years and roll from that age onward (the
system isn\'t specifically designed to generate childhood life events). Or
you can start with the PC\'s year of birth, but in this case you should
assume that most of the results apply not to the character but to their
parents or guardians: changes in the parents\' lives can have major
influences on their kid\'s development. Thus, the character\'s parents might
divorce, or the family might move to a new home (or planet, for that
matter), or their financial fortunes might change radically.

When the character is over the age of twelve, continue to use this rule of
thumb: if the result of a roll doesn\'t make sense for the character,
interpret it as the experience of someone close to the character, such as a
parent, sibling, lover, friend, whatever. For instance, if a roll
determines that your PC "splits up or gets a divorce," but they aren\'t
currently involved in a relationship, just assume that the PC\'s parents
have split up, or their best friend is going through a divorce.

The Events Tables refer to the character as "you". The word "You" is
assumed to proceed the Event description, as in: [You] "are involved in a
lawsuit".

The Events listed are supposed to be influential, pivotal, or in some way
character-forming. Obviously the PC will have a lot of inconsequential
experiences and relationships, but those aren\'t worth generating. Don\'t
just jot down the result as listed, such as "try a new sport"; instead,
work out the specifics of the event, and its consequences for the
character, rolling results randomly if necessary: "Age 19: Ensign Phred
takes a course in Free Fall Jujitsu, but quickly washes out, as the
instructor delights in humiliating late starters."

Similarly, if the tables say the PC falls in love, work out the
consequences. In love with whom? Roll up the lover\'s UPP; do the couple
have radically different Social Standings? Are they badly mismatched in
Intelligence or Education? Is the love returned, or unrequited? Again,
determine the outcomes with die rolls if you want, or make it all up. You
can assume the relationship lasts a long time, at least until another roll
determines that\'s it\'s Over. If it\'s just an "affair," you might give it a
randomly-determined time limit.

Remember to take into consideration the world you\'re on at the time of the
event - your homeworld, or a planet you\'re stationed on, or a ship for that
matter. Make use of the local culture, geography, Tech Level, Law Level,
whatever is appropriate. Sometimes, to determine the outcome of an event,
the UWP stats can be used as target numbers for rolls. For instance, if you
are "diagnosed with a serious disease or disorder", roll the world\'s Tech
Level or less on 3D to recover fully (use more dice or less, depending on
the lethality of the disease). A failure might imply that someone close to
the PC died of the disease. Similarly, use your UPP stats for target
numbers. If you are "involved in a lawsuit", you might roll your Social
Standing or less on 2D to win a favourable ruling. If you "try a new drug",
try rolling your Endurance or higher on 2D to avoid addiction. And so on.

Don\'t be a slave to the dice. It\'s your PC after all - you can make
decisions for him or her at any time. If the PC settles down with a
partner, it might make perfect sense that they have children, whether or
not this comes up as an Event roll; after all, pregnancies can be planned
or unexpected. However, since Traveller is about Travellers, it\'s generally
a good idea to assume that the PC will begin the game single, or at least
not living with a partner - unless you and your referee think that a
marriage can be worked into the game.

The referee should be allowed to check the final character history for
consistency with the setting (especially some of the large scale events
such as wars and disasters). But the other players don\'t necessarily have
to know any of it. You might have two versions - one the life story you
tell to your shipmates; the other listing experiences even your lovers
don\'t know about....


To Roll for Events:

For each year (or period of two years, etc):

Roll one die to select a group of tables. 
        1-3: Personal Development group
        4-6: Transformative Events group
Roll one die to select a table from that group.
Roll one die to select an event from that table.

Interpret the results very freely. Fudge as necessary.

   1  start or end an affair
   2  start or end an affair

 2. Career
   1  get a new job or assigment
   2  lose your position
   3  get a new boss or partner
   4  have a major success
   5  have a major failure
   6  feel your career is stagnating

 3. Finances
   1  make a major purchase (home, vehicle, land, etc)
   2  find yourself deeply in debt
   3  get out of debt, or declare bankruptcy
   4  invest with great success
   5  invest with great losses
   6  go on the dole, or receive a grant

 4. Law & Crime
   1  become involved in crime or conspiracy
   2  become a victim of crime or conspiracy
   3  become involved in a lawsuit
   4  get into trouble with the law
   5  are publicly accused of a crime
   6  are affected by a new law or crackdown

 5.  Social Conflict
   1  are betrayed by someone you trust, or betray someone
   2  join, or oppose, a controversial social movement

 6. Major Event
   1  survive a major disaster, natural or otherwise
   2  are caught up in a war or armed uprising
   3  experience a famine or other severe shortage
   4  are caught up in violent civil disorder, rioting, or protests
   5  experience a kidnapping, hostage crisis, or terror attack
   6  are caught up in political upheaval or revolution


If you need to determine the identity of another person related in some way
to your PC, you can roll on the \'Others\' table below. For instance, if you
roll an event that isn\'t appropriate for your character, you might decide
that it applies to a person determined by a roll on this table. 

Others
   1  A relative, or one of your children, if any
   2  One of your siblings
   3  One of your parents/guardians
   4  Your lover, spouse, partner, or close friend
   5  A friend, mentor, or hero
   6  A rival, enemy, ex-spouse, or ex-lover

If you\'re a real fanatic, you might roll up some of the more important
people in your character\'s life, and perhaps even roll up their life
histories (though you might want to only roll fewer events). This can add
whole new dimensions to your PC, discovering how the lives of lovers,
enemies, siblings, or children intertwine with your character\'s life.

Bear in mind that a good referee will find a lot of inspiration in all of
this. Expect people from your past to unexpectedly pop up in the middle of
an adventure. That high school rival who ruined your first romance; that
ex-wife you thought you\'d gotten away from forever; that twin brother who\'s
supposed to be long-lost... But of course this is one of the best reasons
for going to all the trouble. It brings the game to life and adds to the
fun.

Feel free to adapt and modify the system to your liking, or adapt it to
your game as necessary. Heretics who like icosahedrals or ten-sided dice
might want to convert it into a single D100 system (not a bad idea, really
- - even if it just ain\'t Traveller!)....

Comments and suggestions are most welcome.

IIRC there was an article in a Guns & Ammo years ago about a buffalo 
hunter last century who was reputed to have shot a buffalo a about 
1500 yards with a Sharps rifle. The author\'s conclusion, after 
playing around with some old rifles, was that over a known range (or 
by using a rangefinder) firing from a mount or rest it could be done 
if you knew you rifle\'s tracjectory well enough.

However even with modern rifles and sights I would say it would need 
a good deal of luck, no matter how skilled you are. For starters even 
a good hunting rifle in still air would be grouping at about 2 feet, 
and even with a .50 BMG round at that range the shot placement would 
need to be perfect. To further complicate matters at 6500 feet (who 
measures a shot\'s range in feet?) the tracjectory would be quite 
steep, so unless the range was known to within a few feet (how 
accurate are even laser range finders at the moment?) you would miss 
either over or under the target.

My personal opinion is that because you couldn\'t guarantee a clean 
kill that a shot shouldn\'t be taken at that range, as you\'d probably 
never find the wounded animal unless you\'re on a flat, featureless 
plain. I\'d be a lot more impressed if this person had stalked the 
deer from 6500 ft, and then shot it from about 20 yards - that shows 
serious skill and patience.

   I\'m a little late to this dance, but with all the sector data being
complied, has there been given any thought to the next step, which is to
make sure that the data is revised to fit whatever new star system
generation sequence will be developed (or already developed but not
published) for "T4"?  IMHO, now would be a perfect time to step back and do
such an edit.  I would be more than happy to humbly volunteer my services
for that project, as I\'m sure many other people would as well.

   So what you are saying Leroy is that you are threating to have Doug

Colorado.  The fact that you did it over the Internet also makes it a
Federal crime.

WHoaH! Stop! Wait! <rant ON>

You are making *seriously* flawed assumptions. You are assuming the
reason why nation-states of the present day don\'t care about
environmental degredation is because they are "non-democracies", you are
assuming that "increasing" industrial production *will always be* all
that matters. Flawed flawed flawed.

Environmentalism is not a political ideology, imho. It is a reasonable
outgrowth of technological and social development. Once science has
advanced enough to be used on a global scale to realize the cumulative
effects of local environmental degredation -- the effects of human
habitation on global ecosystems and climate -- then Environmentalism
will become an imperative of any society which wants to make a planet a
home.

Once we here on Terra "grow up" and the awareness of the tight bond
between human activity and the biosphere has entered the public
consciousness; then historians will look back on reckless industrial
pollution in the same way we look at the use of leeches in health care
during the middle ages. In the same way that the microscope and
micro-organisms revolutionized health care, global data acquisition
through satellites, scientific investigation and data networks will
revolutionize planetary care.

I don\'t think you can take industry in 19-20 C. Earth and generalize
that across all high-tech TL 9+ planets throughout the Imperium. Surely
the majority will have learned from the mistakes of 20th Century Terra
and other less wise species... surely deliberate wide scale
environmental destruction will be seen in a similar light to other
crimes against society... surely future society will realize that there
is *no such thing* as _limitless_ industrial growth -- there *is* a
point of diminishing returns, after which further industrial development
will diminish sustainability of the biosphere and limit future growth.

Marc\'s post was not intended to delinate Imperial laws for everyone, I
believe. It was intended as a general framework to classify *all* laws
that any world government may invoke. Therefore it covers all areas of
litigation, even those the Imperium may not concern itself with, such as
religion.

Somehow, "City class" doesn\'t seem to sit quite right.  How about

I do agree with you that as all Industrial worlds HAS to have tainted or
worse atmospheres in order to be so rated indicate that the Imperium
doesn\'t really care much about the environment. I also think that when you
have several thousand starsystems to choose from one perhaps tend to
neglect the environment on occasion. On the other hand, the Vilani might be
true environmentalists as they lived in a fragile terran ecosystem
surrounded by alien plantlife (I once argued the opposite point but someone
on the list convinced me otherwise). There is also canon references that
the Imperium actually cares about the environment: The hunting to near
extinction of the Dagadashi on Bellerophon was considered a big crime and
the players where there to investigate.

BTW I do NOT think environmental protection is just politically
correctness. As we (so far) only have one planet we should perhaps try to
avoid making a mess in our own (and only) nest.

Illumination, at least in the Gloranthan sense, makes you a madman by most
people\'s standards, the enemy of both Law and Chaos, and truly the enemy of
rational thought on the side of either good or evil.

(Law and Chaos being well defined terms, and good and evil being as
relative as they usually are.)

Occasionally, I have Illuminants wander through my Traveller games, but
usually they are locked up quickly.  Riddlers, though, are popular on
Sylean children\'s programming...

I have also added a second spreadsheet for anyone who just wants to be able

a single sector\'s data in it, with the first page being a rough sector map

The database has been updated to reflect all of the new information.

I hope this helps!

  Adventure 13 (?) - only the IN really knows about them, or has access to
them outside of the transponder boxes. As to their status - either they\'re
intelligent and the IN is committing a criminal act, or they\'re not. If
you\'re cynical, the case becomes "it\'s being done, so they will not be
legally defined as independently sapient".

  After ~1105 (?) they\'re canonically tamper-proof - they slag themselves
every time. I recommend that you evade that by allowing complex forgeries
capable of fooling (at least) civilian authorities. The box won\'t allow
the ship to stop broadcasting its ID and (OC) location.

  If a pirates intel network were truly fantastic, they could operate
as a trapper, and not have a transponder at all. Smuggling is safer.

     Okay, the Traveller\'s Writer\'s List is up and apparently running.

      To subscribe send a message to:

subscribe hiwg-twg-digest <youraddress>

      for the digest version or

subscribe hiwg-twg <youraddress>


       Membership is restricted to former and would be Traveller Writer\'s.
The list is only for work on Traveller related projects (articles,
sourcebooks, etc....). Kibitzers can join the list on a temporary (6-month)
basis at the invititation of a writer.
        Would be Writer\'s need to submit an article for discussion (or an
outline of a sourcebook or adventure book they would like to work on). In
return you get a temporary membership (roughly 6 months), and useful input on
your work.
        A form of Nettiquette will be enforced on the list and discussions
should relate to useful material to Traveller (in any form) with the purpose
of getting published.
        This list is sponsored by History of the Imperium Working Group, it\'s
SIG, The Traveller Writer\'s Group and with thanks to Derek Wildstar for
providing a site.

Some academic types. The article I got the nfo in that post from was in
the April 1977 issue of Analog. I think the article was by G.Harry
Stine.

Metalaw shows up in several of Stine\'s books. Heck, one is *based* on
it ("A Matter of Metalaw"?). He used to write under the name Lee
Correy, but now he writes his SF under his own name. 

The book(s) I was thinking of were the Starsea Invaders series from
ROC. "First Action", "Second Contact", "Third Encounter".

The tumbling is a rotation around _one_ axis that is _not_ the main axis.
Even if the ship rotates around its main axis, you=B4ll get a problem at=20
docking, as you will have to orbit the other ship to stay at the hatch.
Remember the lab ship, which always rotates and is shown quite in a way=20
in the motion picture "2001" and similar in Babylon 5. The landing ships=20
always go to the non-rotating axis or rotate themselves around their=20
long axis that lies identical to the rotating axis of the station.
It would be possible to dock at the ring (like on Deep Space Nine), but=20
not as easy. =20

Now a tumble lets the ship rotate in a way, that the intended point for=20
docking, the hatch rotates around it in a way that makes it not=20
reachable, perhaps because the wings or other parts of the ship get in=20
the way on reaching it and you could collide with it. Additionally, this=20
kind of rotation is not stable and will change (the slower, the bigger=20
the ship is) but you have a problem to predict this.

That=B4s the way I understand it, maybe someone can explain it better than=
=20
me. (if already hasn=B4t - my mail server crashed down the last week).

For the more mathematically involved ones: An axis in physical mention is=
=20
a vector. two or more vectors can always be added to one vector.
So you can describe the rotation of a body using the three main axes or=20
the one, it=B4s visually rotating - this is physically equivalent.

Actually, that turns out not to be the case.  Spain had very strong laws to
protect trees before the Spanish Armada, for example.  In fact, when they
started cutting down more than they planted their naval power started
slipping.  And a major reason in the British colonizing North America was to
get the timber (for ships), because it allowed them to convert British
forests into farmland.


>Increasing industrial production is all that matters (see late
>20th C Terran history, USSR) 

Take the long view, like the Vilani.  If you plan on staying there, don\'t
pollute more than the nevironment can cope with.  Remember that the Vilani
are known for long-term planning (eg. centuries), that Marc has said that the
Third Imperium is culturally Vilani, and that (see my above examples)
rational governments should see a need to preserve the resources that
underpin their power.


>Why else are ALL industrial worlds tainted.

Um, an artifact of a trade rule, taken out of context?

Seriously, it makes as much sense to use the enlistment probabilities to
computer demographics for the Imperium.  (It\'s been done.)  Traveller has a
_lot_ of contradictory material in it, much of it from authors not thinking
of spill-over effects, or from authors taking something to extremes.  

(This is intended as a personal attack, by the way.  I deal with teenage
rules lawyers all day, who delight in twisting rules and regulations.  You\'ve
hit a sore point.)

Anyway, if you want a justification, I\'d say that the tainted atmosphere
count be long-term contamination or alteration of the world\'s natural state. 
Alternately, maybe Imperial policy prohibits industrialization of a world
with a decent atmosphere to begin with!

I disagree, for the above reasons.

  {
    'body' => 'All this talk about sector data and spreadsheets reminded me of a problem
I came across when back in the UK this summer.

One very long term project I\'m working on (though not very often) is the
creation of a ship\'s Library program. The idea is that if one of the
players wants to look something up, they use a computer as a prop (instead
of asking the ref). The way this differs from what I\'ve seen on the web is
that they players cannot see an index of entries. They type in a keyword
(e.g. Akerut) and either it matches or they get nothing (presumably the
ship\'s database would be too big for there to be an easy to use index).
Anyway, I wrote a program to convert the DGP sector data files into the
format I\'m using for the Library. I eventually noticed a problem:

There are discrepancies between the DGP data and Supplement 3. I only
looked at subsectors A to F or G, but each subsector had at least a few
differences, and one had something like a dozen. Some of these differences
are in the planetary size digit - not something that can be explained by
the decade between the CT and MT settings (I seem to recall someone
"recently" mentioning a hydro digit discrepancy).

My questions are:

1. Is there a similar problem with the Solomani Rim data?
2. Does the CT data match the MT data?
3. Which data should be ragarded as "canon"?

I am currently in Lithuania and far away from my Traveller material, so I
won\'t be able to check the books for some time.

This would make a big difference in the piracy and fleet deployment
thread.

If the ships have transponders, how does then scouts undertake spy
missions into enemy territory? They can\'t. So if they have transponders
they need one with an on/off switch. This to means that it is
possible for the IN to make transponders that can be turned off. And if
they got it, you can be sure that someone else has it. Out with
tamperproof transponders. We don\'t want that. So that means that naval
ships do not have transponders and therefor propably have a code system to
identify themself. A ship travelling on a top secret mission only needs to
send the right code to the SDB for it to understand who it is. And as we
all know a codesystem is not perfect. 

Just some ranting, but this transponder issue is to me an idiotic
invetion.

    'body' => 'With the recent thread on Imperial law, I\'ve been reflecting on how I\'ve
handled it in my campaigns, and trying to come up with an overall
theory of the way Imperial justice would work in my universe (with its
"Roman" citizenship model).

Laws:

Imperial laws must be general, and concern themselves only with the
protection of the Nobility, other Imperial Citizens, and the Empire.
Two general classes of crimes against the Empire exist:

Treason - which is actions (or plans to act) that would betray the Empire;
  for example selling military secrets to the Zhodani, or plotting to
  overthrow the Emperor.  Generally these crimes are punishable by death.

Economic - any activity which causes economic damage to the Imperium as a 
  whole, or to individual member worlds.  Many activities, from piracy
  to war between member worlds falls into this category, including
  mercenary activities.  Generally these offenses are punishable by fines
  and/or imprisonment.

In addition, offenses against Citizens (such as murder, theft, and so forth)
are Imperial crimes.  This provides basic legal protection for Citizens and
their property.  Citizens can (and sometimes do) waive this protection - for
example, a mercenary who happens to be a Citizen is not immune from bullets,
and if killed in action, the Imperium generally does nothing.  These crimes
can be punsied by anything from a fine to death.

Conversely, Citizens are expected to maintain a high standard of behavior
and not abuse their priveledges as Citizens.  Abuse of these priveledges
(such as damaging Imperial relations with any world, or other conduct which
reflects poorly on the Imperium) can be punished by a fine, banishment from
a world, or removal of Imperial Citizenship.

There are several items to note about this legal structure:
+ Overall guidelines and some specific instructions come from the Emperor,
  but the details and implementation are up to the individual Nobles who
  administer Imperial policy.  Thus, what Norris does in Regina Subsector
  has very little to do with the policy on Capitol or on Terra.
+ The Imperium doesn\'t generally regard monopolies (even ones that span
  several sectors or more) as economically harmful.
+ Similarly, a "small" war between nations on a balkanized world or between
  corporations or member worlds isn\'t considered harmful unless a
  significant number of non-combatants are killed or significant economic
  damage is done to the civilian infrastructure on either side.


A word about the Imperial "Rules of War".  These AREN\'T laws of the
Imperium.  The "Rules of War" are a set of guidelines for what is probably
acceptable and what is definitely not permitted (for example: nuclear,
chemical, and biological agents of mass destruction are definitely not
permitted, by the Emperor\'s specific order; on the other hand, how much
conventional damage constitutes "too much" is open for interpretation).
The details of the areas that are open for interpretation are up to the
local Nobility, and may vary within the Imperium.  In general, frontier
areas (like the Marches) will have a lot looser definition than the Core
will.


Those of you that have been paying attention may have noticed that (for
example) murder of a non-citizen by a Citizen isn\'t an Imperial crime.
Depending on the circumstances, it may or may not be punished.  This is
where the "Rules of War" and similar guidelines come into play.  For example,
if the Citizen in question is a mercenary, and killed an enemy during the
course of an act of war, there\'s no Imperial punishment.  If the Citizen
were simply to go berzerk and start shooting people on a streetcourner, the
Imperial courts would probably strip him of citizenship, and turn him over
to the local authorities.  In between the two circumstances are the areas
that are subject to interpretation by the Nobility.


Enforcement:

First of all (and despite the Challenge articles), I don\'t have an "Imperial
Ministry of Justice".  Given the fuedal nature of the Imperium, I see the
administration of the legal and justice system one of the functions of the
Nobility.  At least in theory, the Emperor is the source of all legislative,
judicial, and executive authority in the Imperium.  In practice, the Emperor
sets the broad guidelines, and delegates the details.

The non-heriditary Knights are the primary enforcement arm; these are people
who (in general) have already demonstrated a commitment to the good of the
Imperium, and knighthood is a recognition of this.  It gives them additional
rights and responsibilities, to work to uphold the Imperium wherever they
might be.

The local counsuls, Imperial representatives on (nearly) each inhabited
world with an independent government, would almost always be Knights.  Some
worlds have a large number of counsuls, and others only one.  Other Knights
act as the investigative and enforcement arm of the Nobility*.  In any case,
Knights are expected to uphold Imperial law and policies wherever they
happen to be (and "upholding" may consist of simply recording evidence and
reporting to higher authoritiy, or intervening directly).

* This job, in particular, has great adventure possibilty.  I\'ve run a
  campaign where the PCs (all Citizens, lead by an ex-Imperial Navy officer
  who was Knighted) formed a trouble-shooting team reporting to the Duke of
  Lanth.  They were assigned a 500-ton liason ship drawn from the Imperial
  Navy Inactive Reserve ("mothball fleet"), and performed everything from 
  investigations of corrupt business practices by Al-Morai to security for
  a Imperial trade delection meeting with Zhodani representatives.

Many nobles maintain entire units of armed forces* (the Duke of Regina\'s
own Huscarles, for example) equipped to whatever standard they can afford. 
The "big stick" of the Imperium is weilded by the Imperial Navy; in general
local Navy commanders confer with the Nobility.  While the Navy isn\'t
(usually) under the direct control of the local nobles, the Navy is usually
disposed to help them out under the principle of the Emperor\'s Protection.
The Navy prefers to tackle "large" problems that are amenable to being
solved by suitable applications of military force (such as rogue planetary
governments, wars which must be stopped, piracy, and invasions), while the
nobility\'s private forces and the Knights handle the smaller troubles and
those that can\'t be settled militarily (such as single fugitives, or corrupt
business practices).

* It\'s fairly well-known that the amount of influence traditionally weilded
  by the Duke of Regina in the affairs of the Spinward Marches is due in
  part to the actions of the Duke and his household forces in quashing any
  opposition to Regina\'s policies during the Civil War.

Holders of Imperial Warrants (regardless of rank, although Warrants are
rarely, if ever, issued to anyone other than Knights or Nobility) override
the precedence of the Nobility, at least in the area of authority of the
Warrant.


Trials:

Imperial trials are usually conducted by one or more Nobles who outrank the
accused.  Most crimes are tried by a single judge who hears testimony, makes
a determination of guilt, and (if guilty) sets punishment.  More serious
cases are heard by a panel of nobles (usually three or five).  Appeals can
be made to the higher ranks of nobility, but are usually not successful.

Let me say, I do distinguish between word and deed. There is a politically
correct environmentalism and practical. I hope we follow the latter. And as
to your last statement,TOO LATE!

As far as humanity naturally developing a "social" environmentalism, I say:

HA HA HA HA HA HA..ha ha, ernf (sniff)..excuse me...

Have you ever seen what was left of Eastern Europe after communism?
Third World dictators want the economy to give them First World luxuries
(read: weapons), and the environment is distant concern , at best. They
would then complain, if we (the West) tried to get them to clean up before
it is too late, that we were interfering in their culture. 

I picture TL 10-11 worlds complaining loudly everytime the TL 12 worlds try
to keep a world pristine or that the TL 12 world is unfairly denying them
access to a better life.

Hello,
  It\'s TL, +3 or 6 for asteroid hulls, IIRC. OTOH, using 60 Dt as supplies
and/or support for a couple of long-endurance customs launches or a few
small (anti-piracy) fighters would make it a nice anti-piracy/customs ship.
It does
cut into the SDB function, but HG rules (PP in whole numbers, 1 Hardpoint/100
Dt, etc.) make it hard to fill SDB hulls at various techs without going to
sub-deployed elements.

        Yours truly,

Might require a lot of prior knowledge or explanation - who are the Zhodani? 
what is the Imperium? who is Norris? what is an Imperial Warrant, and why

It costs as much to write a bad script as a good one. There should be as

Maybe. Not likely though. Again, see Eastern Europe. Just because it

   Umm, not quite.  Both women and blacks were considered people (or at
   least, in the case of blacks, partly people*).  They were in fact
   represented in the government ---- women 100%, and blacks 62.5% ---- but
   they could not vote.
   
   The ideal of one-man one-vote is a relatively recent one in the
   history of democracy.  The earlier idea of democracy is that some
   representative sample of the people would be taken into account in the
   legislative process.  The sample would be taken from the best sort of
   individuals: the barons in the earliest days of British democracy.  
   Later, the franchise was extended to all landowners in general.
   
   In the early days of the US, the head of each household was supposed
   to best determine the interests of not only himself but his wife,
   adult dependents, children, employees, servants, and slaves.  He was
   to vote accordingly.  (In those very rare occurrences when a woman or a
   black was the head of a household, then that woman or that black could
   indeed vote.)
   
   Later, because of abuses by these landlords, the definition of
   `head-of-household\' was extended to any literate married adult
   male. Still later, the franchise was extended again to any adult male.
   By this time the head-of-household idea was dying out, and the concept
   of one-man one-vote was beginning to take hold.  It was only a matter
   of time then before the franchise was extended to emancipated slaves
   and women.  Eventually, even the literacy requirement was dropped and
   the age requirement was lowered.  This is because the very /concept/
   of voting evolved from that of the civic duty of the establishment to
   uphold the interests of their `constituents\' to that of a civil right
   whereby any individual could make himself heard, or at least counted,
   by an increasingly impersonal government.
   
   ObTrav: Keep in mind that Traveller government codes 2 and 4 may not
   mean in other future cultures what they mean in our own present one.
   
   -Rob
   
   * Point of clarification.  It is an abstract simplification to say
   that blacks were considered `partly\' people.  The 62.5% representation
   was a compromise between those who held conflicting opinions on the
   anthropological, legal and moral status of blacks in general and
   slaves in particular.  Some did not consider them people at all,
   others thought they were fully human, and many thought that they were
   human but shouldn\'t have their numbers counted to the benefit of
   representatives who oppressed them.  The ruminations of Thomas
   Jefferson, both a democratic idealist and a slaveholder, give an
   interesting insight into how our ancestors dealt with this issue.

heart of Regina, the nightly news!

Gibson: Good evening, I\'m Luck Gibson IV.

Hefry: And I\'m Lise Hefry.  The Environmental Lobby filed
an official protest with the Marquisate today, claiming
efforts to clean up the subsector\'s pollution problems
haven\'t been organized or funded well enough to be effective.
The official position of Regina has been that phase I
terraforming, also known as regional terraforming, is within
the grasp of current Imperial technology, and thus it is 
the Imperium\'s responsibility to provide resources for
local cleanup.  The Palace was unavailable for comment.
Most of the Spinward Marches Sector Councilmembers have
adopted similar positions.  Meanwhile, a number of  
planets in the Marches -- many of them industrial centers --  
have been tagged as dangerous to the health of sapients.
In extreme cases, the Travellers\' Aid Society has distributed
filter masks to members and their guests as a precaution
against tainted atmosphere.

Gibson: The problem of industrial pollution has always been
with the human race, even before the Third Imperium.  
Surviving records of the Rule of Man shows both Solomani and
Vilani worlds with old-style fusion plants, inefficient and 
messy fission reactors, and even fossil fuel plants on the
more barbaric worlds -- all used to power their infrastructure.
Most likely, refineries, mines, and production have always
produced waste -- which is, simply, material that neither
industry nor nature can process efficiently.

Hefry:  However, all that may be changing.  Imperial 
technologists claim qualified success on certain classified
terraforming tests.  We interviewed Doctor Gene Iirla on
the subject: (solid hologram activates)

Iirla: "With careful study of old Darrian text fragments, the 
Imperium stands on the threshold of being able to create a 
planned environment on any planet... of course, we can\'t assure 
a planet will keep an environment -- we can\'t do miracles --
but give us a planet in the habitable zone with the right 
characteristics, and we can create a clean, clear atmosphere, 
bodies of water, and fertile soil.  We could cure hunger once 
and for all!  No more will people have to gasp in the thin 
air of a world tainted by industrial waste!  The future, 
indeed, looks bright, and I assure you it is just around 
the corner!"  (hologram terminates)

Gibson: The Peerage of Regina has stated that it will
co-operate in every way with the Imperium to provide this
technology free of charge to every member world in the
subsector once it is proven.

(pause; Gibson pages forward on his telecomp)

(hologram of a Regina Baron activates)

Gibson: In other news, the body of a Regina nobleman has 
been delivered to an Imperial Scout base on the fringes of
the Marches.  Baron Marcus von Hunt, late of the Margate
prefecture and patron of Shashen College at Margate, is
being shipped home from Garda-Vilis after dying during an 
alleged Vargr Corsair raid upon an Arkesh installation in 
the Vilis subsector.  

(hologram changes to show a different nobleman)

Gibson: A minor noble, a Mr. du Nobe of Lunion, who was 
accompanying the Baron, escaped with some injuries, and is 
being held for questioning.  Accusations that the minor noble 
is responsible for the Baron\'s murder are unsubstantiated.
Sources have recently revealed that Mr. du Nobe was an agent
working for Lunion before he was patented as a noble, and
has a criminal assault record.

(pause; page forward; Imperial patriotic music begins to fade in)

Gibson: Coming up next, strange ruins found on Dinomn.

Hefry: ...and have UFOs really landed on Fulacin?

Schwarz: ...and in sports, the Corsairs beat the Aslan in
one of the most violent hockey matches this season, while 
the Groats cleaned up in the Regina Fazoom tournament.

Arkess: ...and we\'ll see just how bad hurricane Dulinor is
going to be, coming up next after these messages.

Just to throw in a bit of heresy (sorry to muscle in on your turf, Eris),
have you ever considered another way of reading this correlation?  Perhaps
Imperial law or custom only allows large-scale industrial development on
worlds which have an existing taint when settled!  The T-prime worlds
(with, presumably, richer ecosystems) are purposefully limited to
(relatively) light, non-polluting industry in order to protect them.

I realize that, in reality, tainted-atmosphere worlds would often have
ecologies just as \'valuable\' as those on T-prime worlds, so this idea
indicates a significant degree of T-prime-ecosystem bias in the
Imperium...or perhaps all the Industrial (in the trade code sense) worlds
are ones which did *not* have a significant native ecology, and the less
populous tainted-atmosphere worlds are (in some cases) home to more
interesting ecosystems.

Worth a thought, at least...

Is it useful to include X-boat route information in the
UWP line?  Might Regina\'s UWP look like this:

Regina        1910 A788899-C  A Ri Cp              703 Im F7 V M8 D M6 V (1=
810,1912,2007)

Is there too much data there?
Is it too much strain for 80-column viewers?

Also, can the stellar data be pushed together like so?

Regina        1910 A788899-C  A Ri Cp              703 Im F7V M8D M6V (1810=
,1912,2007)


What are the current system description philosophies?

Too much information might make things scary (yech):

Regina        1910 A788899-C  A Ri Cp              703 Im(Extolay,Roup,Dino=

Hmmm, maybe just a skeleton map of the system can be appended:

Regina        1910 A788899-C  A Ri Cp              703 Im(Extolay,Roup,Dino=

where

	p =3D planet (not mainworld)
	s =3D very small planet (not mainworld)
	G =3D gas giant
	b =3D asteroid belt (not mainworld)
	N =3D system naval base
	M =3D system military base
	A =3D agricultural colony
	L =3D research lab


Naaah.


A possibly wonderful way to encode/store/make available (previously
ungenerated) system data via computer is:

1) pick a random number generation algorithm

2) assign a unique seed for each member of a set of ungenerated systems

3) assign a system generation algorithm to these systems

4) "expand" the stats from the seed, using the unique seed to
   provide the random number that drives the generation algorithm
   =


This way, less data needs be stored, because specific stats are
obtainable simply by implementing the algorithm and seeding it
with that system\'s unique number.

Heck, the \'unique\' number could just be a hash of the system\'s name
and its sector-hex number.  In this case, one would also need to
choose and announce a particular hash algorithm.  OR, the unique
number could be the sector hex number and a unique number assigned
to each sector.  Boy would that make things easier.

World Unique Seed # =3D  SSHHHH

	SS   =3D Sector Unique Number
	HHHH =3D World Hex Number (location within sector)

So, if the Spinward Marches Unique Number is 10,
Regina\'s Unique ID is 101910.

There may well be rival mapping systems employed by
pocket empires who don\'t care about the Imperium.
For example, the Darrians may be inclined to do
things their way; as a result, they may be using
8 x 8 subsector maps, or perhaps 7 x 7 subsector
maps (with Darrian at the center, of course).

I suppose there might even be jigsaw-bordered
hexagon maps.

Anyone think these ideas might be useful for something?

As an aside, I suppose the 8x10 subsector format was
due to page size;  my sense of proportion is slightly
offended by the non-square subsector;  I would prefer
8x8 subsectors.  I suppose I\'m 20 years too late for
that (I\'m sorry I didn\'t buy those little black books
that I saw sitting on that shelf in that science 
fiction store back in the 4th grade...).

Unfortunately, an awareness of larger environmental issues hasn\'t

Reality on this planet and at this particular juncture. The cheap clean
fusion energy postulated in the Traveller universe may change the need
for oil spills, clearcutting, etc...

It\'s true that baser human needs rise higher on the agenda when they are
not being met. But that\'s a symptom of a flawed system. If environmental
factors were added to the economic equation, then there would be no
demand for workers performing non-sustainable work.

That may be, but it *is* happening. Witness the number of earth watching
satellites thrown up there in the last 15 years. See how much knowledge
has been gained with respect to the effect of El Ni=F1o on global climate=,
ozone depletion, reduction in rainforest, industrial pollution... and
how Human activity has transformed our planet.

Sooner or later, this knowledge will filter down to our collective
awareness, and influence the way we see ourselves and our world.

You have a cynical view of human nature, my view isn\'t necesarily
optimistic, it\'s just pragmatic. :)

If a society *doesn\'t* realize the intimate connection between human
activity and the environment and human mistreatment is allowed to
continue unchecked; then the environment will be degraded to the point
where it can no longer support the society.

Therefore, the only human societies left in the Traveller Universe will
be those that have learned the lessons of sustainable development...
those that had not will have died out long ago during the "Long
Night"...

What is the distinction between "politically correct" environmentalism
and "practical"? There are practical things individuals can do, and
there are practical limits we may place on corporate activity. Deeds
follow words.

Yes, we have made a mess of the place. A recently released scientific
declaration, signed by over half of the world\'s Nobel Prize winners has
stated that it isn\'t too late to reverse most of the damage already
done. But the window of opportunity is very small... we have a few
decades at most.

It\'s appalling how little media attention such a clear and unambiguous
warning has garnered, considering how many illustrious and non-"fringe"
scientists supported it.

> As far as humanity naturally developing a "social" environmentalism, I say:

I say it\'s already happening. Look around you. How many people throw
away glass bottles and aluminum cans compared to 10-20 years ago? How
socially acceptable is smoking become in the western world? (The entire
province of B.C. is considering a ban in *all* public places) There are
newspaper recycling bins at shopping centres. Some grocery stores have
introduced plastic bag recycling bins.

It\'s a matter of time. We\'re rather late in developing a social
environmental ethic, but it is happening... I hope we\'re not *too*
late...

> Have you ever seen what was left of Eastern Europe after communism?

You keep using communist examples -- how can a small subset of Solomani
ideology be generalized to the whole of humaniti, including alien humans
such as Vilani?

To reiterate Rob, the Imperium is dominantly a Vilani culture, and the
Vilani tend to take the long view of things. They will take the
sustainability of development into account.

On a balkanized planet such as ours, there is a lot of infighting as the
underdeveloped cry foul (rightly imho), since the developed has built
their wealth upon the backs of the underdeveloped nations, and now
expects them to build thier economies more slowly and carefully so as
not to make the same mistakes and degrade further the ecosystem we all
share. That analogy is irrelevant, as each world in Traveller is a
closed system. (for most intents and purposes)

I fail to see how you can generalize the actions of nation-states to the
actions of planetary governments. Any suitably advanced culture *will*
realize that there are limits to the amount of development an ecosystem
can sustain.

How will the TL 12 worlds deny TL 10-11 worlds a better life? Will they
impose environmental laws on TL 10-11 worlds? No, of course not. They
don\'t live there. They couldn\'t care less. They live on their own
planet.

The TL 10-11 world governments will regulate their *own* planetary
development, based on their own measurements and observations of the
planetary system on which they live. That is -- if they know what is
good for them.

You don\'t need to tamper with a transponder to turn it off; for example, 
covering its antennae with a suitably thick iron plate will probably work.
I grant that it\'s reasonable to assume pirates can turn their transponders
off...which only helps as long as the ship is not otherwise detectable; 
if a SDB detects a ship on IR and gets no transponder return it\'ll definitely
investigate

I don\'t contend that the frequency of pirate occurances is OK (and since
the encounter
tables may be scewed to reflect that PC\'s meet more trouble than average
people,
I have no real opinion either way).  I just don\'t agree that piracy is so
impossible.

Personally, I think it\'s a "feature" of the world generation system. I
don\'t take the tainted atmosphere code all that seriously myself.  Some
worlds have serious taints, but it could also just be a little smog, acid
rain or the occasional bad smell around the major industrial areas. 

At the same time, there might be taints that "color" the air of *any* world
with an atmosphere. The smell of a world\'s air is a piece of information I
pass along to players when their character\'s disembark on new planets, "The
sharp smell of ozone mixed with a whiff of chlorine greets you as you draw
the first breath of fresh air you\'ve had in 3 weeks." ;->

  Canonically - whether I like it or not - they\'re tamperproof once
built. OK, a TL 20-odd EW specialist could probably talk one into
selling fast food or running an advice column, but everyone else can
only ignore or kill the black box in question. Useful examination is out.

  Without the SDG transponders I\'d go with universal transmission; any
non-military ship not complying gets thoroughly messed with - fines,
delays, boarding parties, revoking certificates for repeat offenders,
going after the owner, etc. Warships can do whatever, but sniff each
other with (sector?) centrally issued one-write pads specific to each
potential ship that they\'ll encounter in their scheduled run and environs.

  Greeting kills the pads usefulness, but presumably you then secure comm
a new one-write pad, possibly with a rider from the previous (in case
someone is trying to read your lasercomm off your hull). You no longer
have a tamper-proof black box on board - you now have a dedicated data
bank fitted with security and destruct devices up the yin-yang.

>Just some ranting, but this transponder issue is to me an idiotic

  Well, maybe, but it\'s GDW\'s invention. They chose to make transponders
fool-proof once the IN deployed the tech. Not ours to reason why...

Why do you assume that most Imperial Societies will want to make a
planet a home.  If they mess this one up they have 11,000 more to use
later.

Who says they want future growth ?  Villani mindset - if it was good
enough for Great Great Grandfather it is good enough for me, If it is
not broken don\'t fix it, etc.

But given the way so many people in the Imperium are already living on
planets with non terrestrial biospheres does this not imply that even if
the environment is dammaged it will not have any effect on their
economy.

In Traveller the environment does not affect the GDP unless the planet
was "Rich" (Government 4-9, Atmosphere of 6 or 8, and Population 6-8)and
looses that classification or if it becomes poor (Atmophere 2-5 and
Hydrographics 3 or less).  Therefore has it not been canonically
established that the environment does not matter in Traveller.

It is a _big_ galaxy out there, even if it is/was true that their must
be limits to growth on Earth (I don\'t neccesarily agree with this
proposition either but assuming it is true for the purposes of this
discussion) we can continue to grow as we expand.

Traveller is all about economics (just like real life) and one of the
paradigms of economics is that as the quantity supplied of a good
increases the market equilibrium price will decrease.  This applies to
the "good" of a clean environment just as it does to any other good. 
This is why environmentalism has made more headway in Europe than in the
United States, and within the United States environmentalism has made
more headway in the east than in the West.  The more unsullied
wilderness you have the _less_ it will be worth to you.

I live in Anchorage, Alaska the largest city within 1,500 miles, it has
a population of over 250,000 people.  There are wolf packs, eagles, and
bears within city limits.  I see moose all the time.  Their are fabulous
mountains, scenes of epic beauty, world class hunting and fishing.  Yet
here I am sitting in front of a computer typing.  Here in Alaska the
quantity supplied of wilderness is vast.  Therefore it has a low
economic value.  As a more concrete example Anchorage has one of the
lowest rates of recycling among cites its size in this part of the
country.  The reason why is pretty simple - at current rates of landfill
usage Anchorage will take 50 years to fill its landfill.  It would take
Anchorage over 50,000 years to fill up with trash.  So we do not place a
high value on not throwing things away.  It will work exactly the same
way in the Third Imperium, they have 11,000 + planets.  Most of their
planets have less than 1,000,000 people.  They will not value wilderness
in the same way that many 20th century urban members of western society
who rarely see wilderness do.

It\'s all Econ 101 folks.

Not really. Think of the Transponder as being a civilianised IFF (Identify
Friend or Foe) system ... it is interrogated by Radar (or whatever *active*
sensors are appropriate) and, assuming that the Radar has the right code in its
signal, then the IFF Box sends out the appropriate response. This is all handled
automatically and simply means that the Radar\'s integral computers show the
contact as a "friendly". This means that the IFF system simply does not react if
hit by a non-authorised Radar/Active Sensor.

Of course, this is what a *military* transponder does ... civilian transponders
are (allegedly, according to the late and unlamented TNE) much more complex.

I would suggest that there is no reason for a military ship to use a civilian
transponder system ... and that there is no need for them to worry about on/off
transponders for them. Unless you have the correct codes built into the active
sensor signals their IFF system simply remains passive.

This is why tumbling starts and has to end. But the time between these=20

IIRC, the female Trokh was composited of straight lines, specially for=20

Or else the environmental regs are such that it\'s easier to comply if
the atmosphere is already tainted. Or on tainted worlds the measures
required just to survive make the pollution controls "easier".

See, there can be several explanations.

>Just one question. Does naval ships have transponders? 

Yes, but they can be turned off. And there are canonical references to
trick transponders with several different signals built into them (What
I can\'t recall is if there has ever been a reference to a transponder
that could be programmed to send any signal at all). So the Deyo chip
based transponder (which is supposed to have been introduced in the late
11th Century) is in conflict with other canonical sources. When that
happens you either take the latest version as the truth or the one that
makes most sense. As you point out, several Imperial organizations would
need special transponders, so it the TNE version dosen\'t really make
sense. As far as I am concerned such transponders exist. And if they
exist, some of them could fall into the wrong hands.

>This would make a big difference in the piracy and fleet deployment
>thread.

Not from my side. I\'ve always assumed that fake transponder signals are
possible. What I consider very unlikely is that you can visit a starport
using a fake signal without running a grave risk of getting busted. It\'s
like using a car with fake licence plates. You can get away with it for
a while if you are lucky, but the moment someone bothers to check the
numbers on the motor your luck runs out. So, IMO, if you plan to do some
pirating you can use a fake signal and jump out again without doing any
local business if you don\'t find a suitable victim. And if you plan to
conduct business in the system, you can use your real signal. But you
can\'t use your real signal and then do some pirating if a good opportunity
shows up and you can\'t use a fake signal and then conduct business as
usual if you don\'t find a suitable victim.

and/or cargo. Let us as an example take a 600 T, jump-1 freighter worth
MCr124 and assume that it\'s average cargo amounts to 400 T with an average 
value of Cr5,000/T. Let\'s further assume that it is jumping back and forth
between a system with more than adequate defenses and that the risk of
encountering a pirate in the other system is 10%, which is pretty close to 
the figure you get if you go by the encounter tables (And, frankly, if the
systems have no defenses of their own and patrols are as infrequent as the
encounter tables also makes them, I see no reason why the risks shouldn\'t be
that high; piracy is pretty lucrative if you can be sure of getting a good
chance at capturing a whole ship (My claim is that pirates mostly wouldn\'t
get such a chance)). Let\'s further assume that the risk of gettting caught by
the pirate is 10%. Finally, let\'s assume that most pirates are loopy enough
to only capture cargoes and that the chance of losing the ship is only 10% of
the chance of losing the cargo. Insurance payments would then come to an
addtional Cr360/T for cargo carried to the dangerous system. If the pirates
are a bit more like real life criminals, they will take the ship if they can,
which will push the insurance up to Cr3,150/T (BTW. We shall have to ignore
the fact that these figures clash horribly with the established freight and
passenger rates).

So how much traffic do you need to or through a system to make a guard ship
a better value for money? If you insist that the pirates only takes cargoes
(Sheesh, I find it difficult even to supposes such a thing), then if more
than 64,800 T of freight pass through the system, it becomes cheaper to hire
a MCr350 guard ship. That\'s 162 trips through the system, or 13 ships going
back and forth between the system and the neighbor (each ship jumping to the
system half the time and jumping back to a safe system the other half). If we
go by the (IMO) much more reasonable assumption that a pirate knows a good
thing when he sees it and will take any ship he happens to get hold of away
with him, you only need more than 7400 T of freight passing through to make a
guard ship worthwhile. That\'s 18.5 trips through the system, or less than two
ships going back and forth.

But are the 10% chance of a pirate catching his prey plausible? Well, if he
is the kind that takes the whole ship, then one must admit that it is. Even
if he only catches one ship per year, that still comes to MCr12.4 (more or
less; he may get more than 10% for the ship, but OTOH, the ship may not be
brand new). Some of his victims will be worth less -- a 200 T Free Trader like
the ones PCs are apt to own would only be worth 1-2 MCr to him -- and he may
have to leave some systems without getting any chance of a capture, but if
patrols are as few as the encounter tables have it, then he may get more than
one chance in other systems. Let\'s say he gets 50 chances each year; that
would mean 5 captures and be enough to keep him in the black even with mostly
run-down Free Traders and only an occasional bigger ship for prey. But what
if the pirate don\'t take the ships? 5 600 T freighters would net him 2,000 T
of cargo. If we assume an average value of Cr5,000/T, the whole would amount
to 10 million MCr -- less than 2 million when fenced. And that is if all five
victims are 600 T freighters. A 400 T Merchant has only half the cargo
capacity, a Free Trader one fifth. It\'s true that a shipload of cybernectic
parts or pharmaceuticals or radioactives can brighten any pirate\'s day, but
how often do you send 400 T of radioactives to a world with a population too
small to have a navy of its own? And when you do, what are the chances of a
pirate being able to intercept it? And if the chances are high, don\'t you
think you\'d charter an escort for that one trip (or, more likely, persuade
the local Navy CO to provide one)?

It would appear that the risk of running into a pirate must be much smaller
than the encounter tables imply. If the risk of running into a pirate in a
backwater system was really anyway near 10% then the losses would be
staggering. And if they are much, much smaller than the rules imply -- I
think someone suggested one or two pirates at a time per sector, and unless
I misunderstood him completely David said that he thought it would be a few
cargoes per year for the entire Imperium -- then won\'t your PCs start to
wonder when they keep beating the odds and run into yet another pirate?
Mine would (Well, they would if I hadn\'t made clear that pirates are as
non-debatable (in my own, personal, campaign, that is) as flat galaxies ;-).

   Environmentalism has made more headway in Europe than in the US?  Do
   you know something I don\'t?  Last time I checked the US had some of
   the strictest environmental laws in the world, particularly in the
   areas of automobile emissions, air pollution, acid rain, radioactive
   waste disposal, and radiation exposure.  (I\'ll grant you that Europe
   has stricter land management and forestry laws.  No surprise there.)
   I\'m not just comparing the US to former communist countries either.
   Northern Italy has the worst air pollution in the /world/.  (Beijing,
   China is a distant second.)  Pollution in the North Sea and the Baltic
   is worse than in any US body of water, including such infamous
   cesspools as Chesapeak Bay and Lake Erie.
   
   Here in Pittsburgh (where we know a thing or two about pollution
   control 8^), our environmental management and restoration industries
   are experiencing a boom of exports to Europe due to increasing
   environmental awareness over there.  They have a ways to go before
   they catch up with us, but from what I can see over here (a skewed
   picture, admittedly), they seem committed to doing so.  They have
   a longer tradition of environmental preservation than we do, but
   that tradition needs to be updated to deal with modern problems.

This seems reasonable.  I don\'t see why the Zhodani, for instance,
would use the Imperial sector mapping system.  As I recall, they
don\'t have much of a sector level of government (jumping straight
from something at a "subsector" scale to a regional "provincial"
scale midway between sector and domain, but more irregular).

I can certainly see it being used by the Imperium and Solomani,
and by nearby pocket empires.  Nearby Vargr, for instance, might
adopt it.  I think that somewhere there\'s a statement that the
Vilani developed the sector system pre-First Imperium, in the
- -9000 to -10000 time range, so I\'d think that the former Vilani
territory in the Julian states would use it too.

Note that Vland (Vland 1717) is near the center of Vland sector.
If we call 1719 the center of the sector, the Vland system would
need to be moving coreward at 180 km/s in order to move two
parsecs toward the core in ten thousand years; high, but perhaps 
not completely out of the question.  If 180 km/s is too high,
perhaps a somewhat lower speed and a later mapping revision which
slightly moves the sector borders is enough.  It looks like the
Imperium is using Reference (Core 0140) to anchor the sector 
system by the time of the First Survey.

Vilani subsector maps might look odd, though.  Besides being
two thousand years out of date in AD 4521, they\'ll be using the
deshi (0.67 parsec) instead of the parsec on their maps.  So
instead of 8x10 parsecs, a Vilani subsector is 12x15 deshi, and
a sector 48x60 deshi.

    'body' => 'Viliani culture originated on a world where the environment was not terribly
friendly to humans. Food, for example, required extensive preparations and
there was a whole class of people who prepared food and watched the
community\'s nutrition.

In these circumstances, I can easily see environmental concerns being a major
factor in decision making.  Eg. the shuglii (sp?) prohibits a new brick
plant, because it might damage the only good crops with vitamin B5.

Notice that I am not talking Greenpeace-style "Hug-the-Seals" activism, but
rather a cultural predisposition to considering _all_ the costs of a
decision, including environmental modification.  This fits in with what we
know of Vilani culture from "Vilani & Vargr".  Notice that it doesn\'t
preclude enviromental destruction, just ensures that the costs of the
destruction are factored into any decision.  Don\'t forget, these are also the
folks who view environmental warfare as an option (because destroying a
planet\'s environment may be cheaper than destroying its military)!!

Consider, for example, the Vilani concept of "owning" an idea.  If you invent
something, you own the idea.  If I improve it, I still owe you money because
the original idea was your\'s.  Yes, this tends to discourage innovation. (On
the other hand, no Microsoft-style corporations.  There are benefits to being
Vilani!) Vilani culture is _not_ 20th century NorAm culture, and we lose a
lot if we try to make it like that.

The key here is that environmental costs are built into the economic model,
rather than being added-on downstream.  Thus, when you manufacture an item
you must include the cost of disposing of it safely.  (Whether that is a
landfill, a recycling centre, or just tossing it into the sun depends on the
situation.)  This is not hard to do, and when "long term planning" means
centuries, not a couple of years, it is even essential.  

I do not see the Imperium taking an interest in whether you cut down a tree
in your front yard.  I _do_ see the Imperial authorities (who are cultural
Vilani) stopping a megacorporation from strip-mining a world and then leaving
the locals with a poisoned biosphere.  If the corporation owns an
_uninhabited_ planet, then it is their property and their problem, unless
there is a reason for the Imperium to take an interest (eg. strategic site
for a colony). 

Suppose, for example, that a world has granted LSP a license to exploit
lanthanum deposits.  LSP wants to strip-mine (cheapest), but the run-off
would kill a fishery.  Imperial Law would support the world in preventing LSP
from doing that without agreeing to compensation.  Assuming that LSP had
exclusive ownership of the continent, Imperial Law _wouldn\'t_ be concerned
with what they did as long as the effect stayed within the boundaries of the
continent.

This also makes sense from the standpoint of economic imperialism.  The
Imperium encourages worlds to use nice clean Fusion Plus (manufactured by
you-know-who).  


Another thing to remember is that Imperial Law deals mainly with interactions
between subject worlds, or between the Imperium and subject worlds.  Internal
affairs are just that: internal.  I see the environmental aspects of Imperial
Law mainly being invoked when outside agents interfere with a world (just as
the Rules of War prohibit outside interference in a local conflict).  But
they also provide a reason for the Imperium to replace local companies with
its own higher-tech eco-friendly companies.  Remember the Rules of Contact
from Milieu 0, after all!!!

So what you\'re saying is most societies in the Imperium are roving
strip-miners, who move in and then pull up stakes and move out.

I don\'t think so.

It may be that the majority of low pop worlds (< POP 6) are mining
colonies, or other small installations who don\'t have to worry much
about environmental degredation.

But the vast majority of POP 6+ worlds can\'t just up and leave, lock
stock and barrel. Do you realize the costs involved? They are there to
stay.

Maybe they don\'t. They want efficiency. That proves my point. They won\'t
be worrying about industrial growth at any cost, and will always factor
in future impact of their decisions upon their society.

I\'m speaking in terms of worlds with biospheres. (terrestrial or
otherwise) Obviously, polluting a world that can\'t support life is less
of a concern.

??? You don\'t believe Earth\'s resources are finite? *Obviously* there is
a limit to growth on Earth. There is a limit to growth on any planet.
Each world is a *closed* system. You simply can\'t import fresh air
(easily) once you pollute it.

I don\'t believe real life should be *all* about economics. I think it\'s
a failing of our society that this seems to be *the* priority. What\'s
the economic value of a human life?

The problem with economics is that it only uses one side of the balance
sheet: Profit and growth. It assumes resources are infinite, and
economic growth is mandatory. It isn\'t able to account for non-economic
factors necessary for life on Earth.

A clean environment is not a "good". That\'s absurd. A clean environment
is a *necessity*. It is needed for life. You can\'t put a price on that.

Are you seriously saying we should limit unsullied wilderness to a few
parks in mega-cities so they are worth more to us?

I don\'t believe that nature follows human-made laws of economics. The
larger, the more diverse, the more pristine our environment is, the
*more* it is worth to us. The more forests we have, the more robust our
biosphere is. It can process more pollutants. It is less prone to wild
shifts in equilibrium.

One of the factors influencing our climate is the fact that vast tracts
of rainforest is being destroyed in Brazil and Southeast Asia. This
means that less carbon dioxide is being converted to oxygen, and global
temperatures are rising.

Which is economically more efficient: Mining aluminum from bauxite or
recycling an aluminum can? The answer is recycling. Same could be said
for a host of other products: paper, glass, tin.

I\'m not a neo-Luddite. I enjoy the benefits of technology. Being one of
less than a million people living in this vast province known as
Saskatchewan, I\'m familiar with wilderness. But I believe we are a long
way as a species, from understanding the miracle of life on this planet.

I take the opposite view that you do. Space is nearly infinite. The vast
majority of it is dead, lifeless. Asteroids, gas giants, comets. Barren,
airless, frozen, and molten worlds. On the contrary, those that find a
gem of a world, able to sustain life, will do their best to protect
it...

Anyone know if it is good?

After the M0 campaign, which included the fatally flawed FS data, and the

Insurance for ships/cargo will only be issued to ships filing flightpaths 2
jumps ahead and not if you venture outside the Imperium or enter Amber
zones/Red zones. This is the MAIN reason the Amber zones are printed on the
starcharts. When TAS issues an Amber zone on a system its tourism & trade
takes a hard hit so the TAS inspectors (always anonymous of course but word
gets around quickly) are real powerfactors and susceptible to bribe
attempts.

Hey, this opens up some interesting plotlines...

Jo Grant has used this system for some time, and it is pretty slick.  I do
not like it in general, because it makes it hard to do non deterministic
things to the data.  For example, if you boost the law level on a planet,
then it has to be noted in some reasonable way.

Economists CAN factor in everything if they like and thus be very
environmentally supportive (some do and arrive at some interesting
conclusions). The reason most tend to ignore this has its roots in who is
paying for their research and the general lack of proper scientific methods
amongst economic theorists.

I thought it was established that civilian ships could turn their
transponders on and off at will, because they might have legitimate
reasons not to announce their entry into a new system (like fear of
pirates).  The transponder would keep a record of these events,
however.  Military ships can make their transponders say anything.  They
can broadcast their identification and the standard Imperial IFF signal,
or broadcast any identification in their computer\'s memory, or any other
IFF in memory.

   Real life is not all about economics, but economics is all about real
   life.

   An accurate economic theory factors in more than just profit and
   growth.  In fact, it factors in profit and growth only so far as
   profit and growth influence human behavior.  Since human behavior
   depends on life on earth, all factors necessary for it will be in some
   sense economic.

   All necessities are goods.  Economic laws apply to them too.

   I don\'t follow you here.  Nothing in Peter\'s message implies that he

   The laws of economics are not exactly human-made, at least not
   directly.  They are objective descriptions of human behavior and are
   thus derivative from the laws of nature which humans, being natural,
   follow.  Let me repeat: Economics is not a /prescription/ for how humans
   /should/ behave; it is a /description/ of how humans /do/ behave.

   If recycling aluminum cans is more efficient economically (as opposed
   to thermodynamically), then how come civil laws and public subsidies
   are required to ensure that it is done?  If we in Pittsburgh were not
   required by law to put our aluminum cans into recycling bins, and if
   recycling companies were not paid by the city to recycle them, then
   there would be almost no recycling of aluminum cans here.  Actually,
   there /is/ no recycling here despite this.  The `recycling\' company
   used to take our recyclables to a landfill and dump them to save the
   cost of recycling.  Then they were caught, fined, and fired.  After
   that, no local company would take the city\'s recycling contract, so we
   now have an out-of-state company that takes the recyclables to an
   out-of-state landfill where our police cannot arrest them.  On the
   bright side though, our police can still arrest me if I neglect to
   partake of this charade and stop separating my garbage 8^).
   
   Please note that I\'m NOT saying we should not recycle; I\'m just
   pointing out a counter-example to your theory that it is economically
   more efficient.

Not unless the physics of jump drives has changed in the past two

Remember that the parsec is used just \'cuz it "happens" to correspond

  And I find it amazing that this is the first the list has had to say about
it.  I\'ve owned the Naval Architect\'s Manual for a week now...

 A quick review:

Despite the name, the "Naval Architect\'s Manual" is firmly a role-player\'s
supplement. It has somewhat less appeal to the average gearhead. Why?

  Aside from two pages at the front, NAM is a heavily illustrated guide
to what the various shipboard facilities look like. It has half-a-dozen
examples of bridge layout for various sizes of ship, blocks of staterooms
(including "Cleon\'s Stateroom", a huge suite of rooms rivaling the size
of some whole starships), turrets and bays, engineering spaces, common
facilities, labs, etc and so forth.  All are done on a 1m grid (based on
the size of most chairs, anyway; the book doesn\'t say).  Each type and
example is described in basic terms, along with some notes for use within
a game.
  Presentation is clean and readable, with illos and text always together
on a page (occasionally the order of appearance is mixed, but matched
bits are always close together). As mentioned above, some note about
scale would have been nice, but this isn\'t crippling in this case.

  With a near-exhaustive collection of such bits, the average referee
does not need to plan out an entire capital ship or large liner. Instead,
he can play "here is the lounge, here is your local block of staterooms,
here is the Captain\'s office ("Oh, ****!")".  This supplement virtually
eliminates the old referee\'s problem of Player Anticipation ("If there
is a map for it, it must by dangerous or important."), at least where
ship interiors are concerned. Some of the pieces happily function for
ground facilities as well, such as the local TAS hostel.

  Because I\'m in a regular Traveller game, I rate the Naval Architect\'s
Manual as a useful and fairly well-done product. It is only sort of
what the name led me to expect, however.  Active referee\'s would be
well advised to pick it up, in my opinion. Lonely gearheads can
likely give it a miss unless the complete deckplans of the Planet
class Dreadnought are on their ToDo list...

I seem to recall _Vilani and Vargr_ mentioning that Vilani astrography
_was_ based on the "deshi" (distance from Vland to Tauri), though.  Is
there some way to break sectors or subsectors into reasonably even units of
deshi?

   I saw it in a game store in Lexington, Kentucky.  It appeared to consist
entirely of deck plans for everything from a starship bridge to a starship
gallery, to well, you name it.  Not crappy virtually unuseable deck plans
like in Starships, but stuff that you can really use with grid squares.

   While I did not buy it (I\'m on too tight a budget at the moment), I would
rate it as one of the better supplements produced for "T4" thus far (and
useable with TNE no less).  Certainly worthy of being on your Christmas list.

    My apologies, is this sounds dictatorial or something. It is my hope that
this will provide an area that is first of all useful to writer\'s and help
them in getting published and provide fun and enjoyment for the rest of us.
Secondly I\'m hoping it will get the official sanction of I.G. so that the
material being published will be better playtested (I think we can all agree
this will be a good thing), in order to do that access needs to be restricted
(from what I know). At least for right now it does have what one might

Hey, if both Guy AND Derek like, it, I\'m there dude :)

I took a look at this in the store (my copy has not made it\'s way to me
yet). Lotsa deck plans that can be copied and used in ship designs for
ships if various sizes, or as examples of how to design your own. fairly
hefty book, too, for the price. Worth getting for any version of Traveller
if you draw deck plans.

My local game guy says he has the Naval Arch. Manual in stock. This makes the

Maybe IG is "dead...film at eleven". I\'ve sent them multiple inquiries about
Emp\'s Vehicles and the only reply I got was a generic message from Tim Brown
about "having troubles with printers". No response to my query about when/if
I would actually get the bloody thing. I guess NAM will be MIA as well.

I just don\'t understand this. I want to buy things from IG. Apparently IG

I saw it in a local hobby store... its just a collection of deckplan
"modules."  Everything from low berth bays (human and non-human) to bridges.
 I wasn\'t especially impressed, but i could find some utility for it.  The
beginning talked about ship design in general and the rest is deckplan
modules and descriptions.

Did someone say "unified vision of future technology"?  Ha ha ha!

p. 109, re: "Live Trophy Display" -- "The [cage] walls are actually energy
partitions to keep the animals inside while protecting the viewers....
some injuries do occur when an animal attempts to race to a distant
savanna [sic] only to bounce off a gently yielding energy wall."  Would
that be TL-Star Trek?

Then there\'s p. 22, where the Meson Screen Workstation really seems (from
the text) to control Meson Guns.  A minor nit, perhaps, if it weren\'t for...

p. 19\'s Spinal Mount Weapon Workstation presumably refers to controls for
the massive weapons that form part of the structural members for great
lumbering warships.  But we get "the operator is strapped and clamped into
the chair, and the workstation turns and banks along with the weapon.  For
this reason, this position has the reputation of being the \'wildest ride\'
in the ship.  Care should be taken so that the operator and chair have
maximum clearance on all sides."  Perhaps this will have an influence on
the trav-tech list\'s discussion of warship slew speeds?

Many deckplans sections don\'t match the accompanying text, though they\'re
fairly minor disagreements.  And, as has been pointed out on trav-tech
already, the scale for the map grids does not appear anywhere in the book. 

This one\'s another stinker, I\'m afraid.  It\'s the first IG product (even
after Starships) that I\'d strongly consider returning, if it wouldn\'t
put out the owner at my FLGS to do so.

And Doug Stewart (Design), Tony Lee (Editing), and even Timothy Brown
(Production Manager) ought to end up _in_front_of_ that rapidly-slewing
spinal mount.  Are TML folks the only ones who write decent supplements?

(Kudos to Joe Walsh\'s wife Carole -- some of the deck plans are rather
nicely executed.  I just wish the accompanying text lived up to \'em.)

No, the Traveller parsec is only co-incidentally similar to the Teraan
parsec. Remember, a "parsec" is the max distance a J-1 drive can take
you... 

I may sit down some dayu and try to come up with a handwave for jumps
being that size. Preferably one that relates it to some natural
constants, so we can specify the length of a jump to some ridiculous
degree of accuracy. :-)

EMP induces strong currents in any "long" conductors. The voltage is
proportional to the length of the conductor, and the strength of the
pulse. So effects can include things like zapping anybody who happens
to be in contact with a conductor (like a fence) will get electrical
damage. With a strong pulse, I\'d hate to have any metal pins or plates
in my body.

Actually, magnetic fields don\'t seem to affect us much. Otherwise MRI
gear would be unusable, and folks working near big accelerators, fusion
reactors, and other places using *intense* magnetic fields would have
to take precautions. (Note that the field in an MRI unit is strong
enough that if you "forget" and wear an earring or the like, you can get
burned by the induced currents, or injured when it rips free).

Low frequency sound can do nasties to you also. And it *can\'t* be
shielded. Which is why it hasn\'t been used as a weapon. So far nobody
has figured out how to use it without nailing themselves as well as the
enemy.

Well, I\'m no one like them, however I got it last Saturday at my FLGS, and
would say it\'s the best product so far!  However, I should say that I\'m a
sucker for starship plans.  I did notice a typo in about the first
paragraph though.

One thing that is really pissing me off is the reuse of artwork!  I mean
how many times do we have to see the same thing over and over?  There are a
few new interior drawings that I feel are pretty decent, but considering
the rest of the artwork that T4 has had that\'s not saying much.

I\'ll put it this way, I\'ve got every T4 book (a fool and his money are soon
parted) except the "Mileo 0 Campiagn" Hardback (I\'m not that foolish).  If
I could only keep one of them, this would be it.  I\'ve already recommended
it to a friend that is avoiding T4, because I\'m sure he\'ll really like it.

AND is the Advanced Nuclear Drive, a low-efficiency/high-performance
lightweight fusion rocket, using tritium-enriched heavy water, for
use in missiles. The exhaust (and the whole engine after more than a
few seconds of firing) is moderately radioactive; it can only be used
in expendable vehicles. Missiles using this drive are "kicked" a 
few tens of meters away from the launching ship by the launcher or
by a explosive charge in the launch cannister.

  It may be useful to keep in mind that most large organizations

either that the Imperium (or sub-sector gov\'ts) has been pressured
into providing adequate piracy suppression, or said organization
has chosen to do so itself.

  FWIW, it seems evident that if the Imperium wouldn\'t provide

  Assuming operation near a border, and strong contacts with organized

  IIRC, he said 1-2 cargoes per year per typical backwater system - quite
possible depending on how piracy is defined ("a bright blue light, officer,
then all the systems went dead - when we woke up, the cargo was gone! Really").

I dunno.  I\'ve always seen a J1 drive as a drive that could fling you up
to about 1pc distance (maybe a little more), and nothing else.  A Terran
J1 drive might be rated, by a Vilani as a \'1.5-deshi\' jump drive (and a
Jump-2 drive would be a \'3-deshi\' drive) I\'ve never believed that a ship
*has* to have a jump drive rated in \'whole-parsec\' units, nor have I ever
agreed with the \'six levels of jumpspace\' being more than a layman\'s
approximation of jumpspace.

So, the \'parsec\' notation is a Solomani rating system to determine the
approximate maximum distance a jump drive can take you (you don\'t think
those stars are really \'whole-number-of-parsecs\' distance, do you?). 
During the First Imperium, the Vilani engineers probably build drives that
would be rated at fractional parsec jumps (say, a jump1.5 ship).  They
could have used a system like this (if using FFS2):


Equation 2: Jump Drive Volume
Vol(JDrive) = (0.01 + (0.0067*Jn)) * Vol(ship)
	where Jn = jump rating in deshi


Equation 3: Jump Grid Area
GridArea = TotalArea * (0.1 + (Jn * 0.0034))
	where Jn = jump rating in deshi

Equation 4: Jump Fuel
JumpFuel = 0.067 * Jn * Vol(Ship)
	where Jn = jump rating in deshi


Table 4: Jump Drive Table

TL	MaxJump	Mass
	(deshi)	(t/m3)
- --	----	----
9	1.5		3
10*	2		3
11	3		3

*note how this fills a hole in the jump drive progression table at TL10. 
Assuming the TL charts were developed by Vilani, this explains the \'hole\'.
 There is an improvement in Jump drives at TL10, but a \'2-deshi\' drive is
only a 1,5-pc drive, and could not be rated as a jump2 by the Solomani.

Do, touches like that are very good to use as a ref.
The old Scout talking to the young scientist at the TAS bar:

"Isn\'t it peculiar that Jumpdrives jump almost exactly the same length as
the distance between Terra and its sun times the number of arcseconds in a
complete revolution?"

"Actually a J1 unit jumps handwave bullshit bla bla bla but for historical
reasons Solomani always called them parescs and the name has stuck
everywhere but in the restored Vilani empire. Calling parsecs there is
considered an insult"

Sorry that I was playing the pedant then. Anyway, Factor 12 armour in High
Guard is a complete pain for a non-military ship to broach... Minimum roll
= 20 without pulse lasers or nukes assuming USP<9, so just only a 2 or a 3
(2.3%) of hits will damage anything (albeit it a weapon hit if it does get
through). The HG design system certainly makes the small SDB hard to crack.

Looks interesting - I hope that you don\'t change that T4 combat system too
much (especially with the EA bits linked in) as it was one of the parts of
the system that really stood out for me (fast and deadly). Also, I could
use autofire very quickly and understood it the first time that I read it
(unlike MT and TNE)!

In fact, there are two possibilities to protect you from sonic.
The first one is: vaccum (Interesting: could this be used for a thermo=20

sound that interferes with the weapon=B4s. Slightly complicated, but=20
theoretically possible.
Low Frequencies surely can leave severe tissue damage, if the right=20

Lightyears is for laymen. Parsec is the distance a star has to be from us
to have a one arcsecond paralax and is thus tightly coupled to the AU unit.
1 Parsec =3D 1 AU * 360 * 60 * 60 (1 AU times the number of arcseconds in a

Both are arbitrary units. The AU as the distance Earth-Sun will not be 
found often in other places. The Lightyear (its name shows) is also 
connected to the solar system because of the earth year.

I remember the diverse calendars used by the different races. (shudder)
It would be nevertheless interesting how the physical units for length, 
time, mass, charge, etc. could be derived at the races.

 Actually, magnetic fields don\'t seem to affect us much. Otherwise MRI
 gear would be unusable, and folks working near big accelerators, fusion
 reactors, and other places using *intense* magnetic fields would have
 to take precautions. (Note that the field in an MRI unit is strong
 enough that if you "forget" and wear an earring or the like, you can get

A parsec is about 3,26 lightyears, not the other way round.

The AU is defined as the average distance between the Earth and the Sun.

Another observation: Isn\'t it strange that the Vilani uses hours, seconds
and other time measuring units ? What about the metric system ?

To make my point clear: The only true reason that Traveller uses these
normal Solomani units is for simplicity. If it were to be more realistic at
this, it would be pretty hard to understand many things, like exactly how do
the Vilani measure weight and length.

"Deshi" hasn\'t come in for discussion yet on the TravLang list (so far as I
can remember).  What do you have in mind by saying it\'s the Vilani word for
their "jumplength unit"?  The only published mention of "deshi" (in V&V) is
to define it as 1.6-whatever light years, the distance between Vland and
Tauri (the nearest star).

Hm... and long is a Vilani light-year compared to a Terran light-year, come
to think of it?  I\'d better go check the Vland system data in V&V...

Just came to me. Why not put an off/on switch on the cable sending the
signal from the transponder to the antennea. If it has some way of
checking that it sends something, that can\'t be to hard to fool.

Why do they have to be otherwise indetecable. I agree with your statement
if we are talking about the core systems of the Imperium. The further out
you get the more likely it is that you wouldn\'t want to send your
transpondercode to anybody but the local athouraties. A transponder that
sends at all times is just plain stupid when your near the fringes of the
Imperium.

It doesn\'t really matter that they are unbreakable, just that they don\'t
fall into the wrong hands. The reason I made my first post was that I
envisioned something like the episode in one of the Star Wars movies were
the heroes has stolen a Empireship and uses a code to get past a Cruiser,
I think they were heading for Endor. There will be hundreds if not
thousand of ships going around in the Imperium that have secret missions,
delicate diplomatic info, valuable noble cargo and so on, that in the name
of noble so or so, only has to use a code, that is transmitted in thight
beam towards the local SDB or whatever that controls the system, to avoid
being harrassed. Any pirate with such a code could run several sectors
from his latest prey before being subject to inspection.

Economics doesn\'t reflect absolute truths; it makes subjective decisions
based on relatively arbitrary criteria, including extremely arbitrary 
accounting conventions. (To take a non-environmentalist example, one of the
reasons that CEO\'s get huge stock options is that accounting convention
currently doesn\'t count those stock options against a company\'s profit/loss
 - there was a great outcry when the american acounting standards organization
(whose name escapes me) proposed changing this.) 

In the environmental category, mainstream economic decision-making has 
problems with global-type problems like ozone depletion, where small c
contributions from everyone add up to a global problem. Similarly it has
no good mechanism for long-term decisions. Recycling aluminum is not 
currently cost-effective compared to digging up new aluminum; but if you
never recycle aluminum and your population keeps growing sooner or later you
run out and end up digging up the old aluminum from landfills, which costs 
substaintially more than it would have to recycle it in the first place.

  Not quite, though the Starship Operator\'s Manual is probably the closest
parallel for content. The Naval Architect\'s Manual does all of its
illustration (with one or two exceptions) as deckplan parts. It never
shows a complete ship, or even the parts of a single ship, unlike SOpM
which put everything into the context of describing the Free Trader.
  Also, SOpM was clearly a Player\'s book, while NAM is more of a Ref\'s
book.

  Happily, one of the actual artwork bits shows the cheerfully reckless
alien from Emperor\'s Vehicles, making this his third appearance (two in
EV; one here). Now all we need is a Contact article...

 THUDDD 7 Comments
 
 XTF-4 Delta Fighter
 
 	This is a straightforward fighter design with good acceleration,
 good sensors, and a reasonable price tag.  The only quibble with it I have
 is that it uses a battery of small laser turrets to add up to one big
 weapon.  I realize that the current (IMHO screwed up) USD and combat
 system allows this to happen, but I personally stick to the Brilliant
 Lances rules which uses the same assumptions about the physical universe
 that FF&S2 does. Under those rules four small turrets do four times the 
 damage but have only the armor penetration of one turret.  For that 
 reason, I think the XTF-4 would be better off with one or two larger 
 laser weapons.
 	Other comments:  why no long range communicator?  A maser would 
 be appropriate.  The armor is a bit light.  Different sensors are listed 
 in the USD and the technical description, which is it?
 
 ----
 Gede-class Strike Fighter
 
 	The Gede is a heavy fighter with all the trimmings.  The 
 acceleration is fine, the armor is good, and the sensor suite is 
 excellent.  
 	I have three basic problems with the fighter: 
 	(1) I\'m not sure I believe in the fighter/bomber mission of using
 fighter-carried missiles to attack large warships.  As a way to clear
 escorts and scout-craft, perhaps, but I think the secondary weapons on a
 large warship and its likely screen of escorts would exact a heavy toll on
 attacking fighters.  It may be that the IN hopes to use these fighters
 against lower-tech opponents and therefore believes that it can get away
 with it.  If so, this mission is one that is likely to fade with history. 
 	(2) The description states that the fighter can use the PAWs MFD 
 along with the dedicated Missile MFD to control all 8 missiles.  The 
 problem is that this would require a third crewman because each MFD 
 requires a gunner.  The assumption appears to be that the pilot will use 
 the MFD, but since the pilot will be very needed for evading the target\'s 
 secondary weapons fire it would not be responsible for him to divide his 
 attentions, even though T4 _might_ allow him to do so.  I say might 
 because the rules are unclear to me.
 	(3) My last problem with the Gede is the PAW.  It\'s really not 
 as effective as a laser would be.  Yes, it doesn\'t have to worry about 
 sand, but in a world of non-ablative armor and superior laser 
 penetration, it\'s next to useless.  The only thing it would be good for 
 is disabling civillian computers, since a hit from a PAW forces a reset 
 on any non-fiber-optic computer.
 
 	Other comments:  I\'d replace the laser comm with a maser since it 
 can be used through atmosphere.  The jammers seem a little lavish, but 
 given this fighters difficult mission, maybe they are warranted.  This 
 figher is rather expensive, but this is likely to be unavoidable for a 
 ship with this mission.
 
 ----
 Gentle Breeze-class Heavy Fighter
 
 	The Breeze is of modest size, acceleration, and price-tag.  
 However, it has excellent stealth and ranged-attack capabilities.  The 
 laser\'s range allows the fighter to put the hurt on targets at great 
 distances.  The only problem is that at 61Mj\'s there isn\'t much hurt to 
 put on.  The laser should have at least twice the DE to be a real threat.
 The stealth characteristics are the best thing about this ship.
 
 
 ----
 Tsiko-class Heavy Fighter
 
 	As the designer of the Darkstar, I know all about "gimmick" 
 ships, and while this one has a good gimmick, it wouldn\'t be terribly 
 useful in actual combat.  The MG has such short range and the ship itself 
 is so slow that any real warship could simply outrun it and shoot it to 
 pieces as it chased.  Not to mention the fact that a warship would likely 
 have a meson screen and therefore wouldn\'t have to worry much even if the 
 Tsiko somehow did get close.
 	As for attacking civillian vessels with an MG, why bother?  
Again, the Tsiko has to be virtually on top of the target before its MG is 
at all effective, and unless the civillian vessel is unescorted, the 
Tsiko will have to make its way past small agile warships with all of the 
problems discussed above.  With the 570MCr this ship costs, you could buy 
one or more of the SDBs designed in the last THUDDD that would be more 
effective (even though only TL-10) and more flexible.
	More silliness:  The point defense lasers are so weak they hardly 
make good anti-personnel weapons, let alone good PD lasers.  Furthermore, 
since there is only one gunner, they have to be fired at the same target 
using the MFD.  What\'s the good of two PD lasers if they have to attack 
the same target?  Why not one decent one?
	In the above I allude to another big problem, the lack of 
gunners.  This fighter has an MG, 2 lasers, and a sandcaster.  To run 
these effectively the vessel needs at least 2 gunners, one for the 
lasers, one for the sandcaster, and let the pilot divide his attentions 
between flying and using the fixed forward mount, should using all three 
be necessary at the same time.  With just one gunner, even if the lasers 
aren\'t being used, the fighter crew has the choice of defending itself 
with the sandcaster and accepting poor fire from the distracted pilot, or 
forgoing the protection of the sandcaster.  For such an expensive ship, 
this seems really silly.
	The only good things I can say about this ship is that it is 
creative, has nice stealth characteristics, and has a bunk so the crew 
can stay on station for long periods. 
 

- ----
MF357 Drachen Jaeger-class Heavy Fighter

	The designer obviously busted tail designing this ship and the 
effort paid off handsomely.  I think this may be one of the best designed 
ships ever submitted to a THUDDD.
	First of all, I have to congratulate the designer for taking the 
mission criteria seriously and really thinking through what it would take 
to accomplish them.  IMHO, too many designers and commentators seem to 
have ideas about space combat and appropriate tactics that haven\'t been 
tested by real experience.  Even with the current messed-up space combat 
system, this designer has come up with a winner.
	The extreme acceleration capability of the craft is the first
thing that catchs the eye.  The crew will be at the limit of their
endurance with 3Gs comped, 1G support from G-tanks, the crew experiences a
full 3Gs at max accel.  They can obviously take 1G standing, the BL rules
say 2Gs sitting is acceptable, so the last G will degrade their
effectiveness.  The high Gs give the fighter impressive intercept and 
patrol performance.  Nevertheless, since the crew cannot take the full 
accel for long periods (i.e. many hours) I\'m not sure that 6Gs wouldn\'t 
be better.  Some other features could be added with a lower accel and/or 
the size & price could be lowered.
	The decision to go with a big laser was the correct one.  The
475Mj laser will have excellent penetration and good damage capability. 
Notice that it is superior to both the PAW and MG weapons that were on
other designs.  There are situations where having the laser in a turret
would be desirable, though this does tie up the second crewman.  The
explicit set-aside for air-to-ground munitions is nice.  The designer
doesn\'t note it but it also appears that it could carry 4 space missiles.
	External armor on the design is rather light, but the component 
armor around the crew space and life support is impressive.  The decision 
to only g-comp the crew area shows a good eye.  I also like the ship\'s 
locker and air-lock.
	I share the designer\'s ambivalence about the scuttle plug.
	I _really_ like the modular 5-Td pod.  This could be used to 
carry several independent missiles that can be launched from further 
out than the controlled variety, particularly if equipped with fusion 
drives.  Coupled with the internal munitions bay this gives the fighter 
an excellent missile carrying capacity.  If desired the electronics 
officer could also use the MFD for controlled missiles.  The other 
proposed uses for the pod are also ingenious, particularly the troop pod.
	A maser would be nice for talking to the carrier when the fighter 
is inside an atmosphere.  A Lidar would also be a great addition to the 
sensor suite.  I understand from the designer\'s notes that surface area 
devoted to PP radiators did not allow these or other options, such as 
stealthing or masking, to be installed.  I think these are more good 
reasons to ratchet the Gs back to 6.
	The only question I have about this ship is whether its 
performance is rated with or without the pod.


- ----
X-1108 Firefly-class Prototype Fighter

	I like this fighter because it\'s cheap.  You could buy two for 
the price of the next cheapest fighter and you could buy more than 10 for 
the price of the most expensive fighter.  Unfortunately, a poor choice of 
weapon limits the ship somewhat.  If the two 225Mj lasers were replaced 
with a single 475Mj laser I suspect performance would be improved.  The 
small 50Mj lasers don\'t appear to have any damage at all, which doesn\'t 
make them very useful.  I also have the same question that I had before, 
which is who is going to run them?  I suppose the pilot could try to do 
that as well as fly if all the fighter is doing is augmenting a friendly 
ship\'s PD screen.  
	The sandcaster has the same crewing problem, though it 
is a nice solution to the armor problem.  Its AV seems suspiciously 
high, too.  If that\'s a legal design it probably shouldn\'t be.
	The passive tracker is redundant and I have no idea why the 
designer saw fit to include so many laser comms.  The g-tanks are also 
not really needed given the fighter\'s max accel is only 4.7 Gs.


	This THUDDD review is long enough as it is, so I\'m going to stop 
before getting into a general discussion of fighter design.  If anyone 
has an interest in discussing these issues further, email me directly or

Not as such - CSC exists for MacOS and several PC owners have reported
success in running it with a Mac emulator for Wintel Boxes called Executor.

I don\'t have the URL\'s to hand, but CSC is on Rob Prior\'s pages.

   Economics reflects truth in the same way that Physics, Chemistry, and
   other sciences reflect truth.  Obviously, an incorrect economic theory
   will not model the truth correctly just as an incorrect physical
   theory will not model the truth correctly.  Making sure that your
   theories are right is what makes science in general so hard, but the
   whole idea of all sciences is that they reflect the truth and
   (eventually) weed out falsehood.

   This is an accounting convention.  It has as much bearing on Economics
   as an engineering convention has on Physics.  Economists, like
   Physicists, need to take care that their theories remain independent
   of such conventions.  The discipline of science is intended to ensure
   such independence.

   This is a good argument in favor of recycling aluminum.  I especially
   like the fact that you used economics to demonstrate it.  (Does this
   mean that it doesn\'t reflect the truth? 8^)  You seem to have come up
   with an adequate mechanism for making a long term decision just fine,
   and you used economics to do it.

I would like to see an AAB on the Web.

There are SO MANY websites out there with useful data
on them... I wish there were a few archive sites by region
that had the same basic data package available on them...
or that there were specific sites that are recognized as
Archives for particular Traveller material.

I wonder if anyone else has been working on this?  It 
shouldn\'t be all that hard to start up and maintain...

The thing that sparked my imagination about following an
Archive model was the simple title -- Joe Heck\'s Missouri
Traveller Archive.  It sounded useful and meaningful.

It would be nice to have Archive sites for:

Sector Data (M:0, M:1100, M:1200 ...)
Starship Plans
Vehicle Plans
Equipment Plans
Library Data
Character Data
House Rules (?)
Programs/Scripts
other?

Joe, you have quite a bit of subject material there, and
it\'s organized well.  Software, HIWG, deckplans, languages,
software... perhaps your site should be the primary
Archive for some of this.  What does everyone think?

Also, we have a few archives of sector data -- on personal
web pages as well as Northern Arizona U and Berkely.
Is there an all-encompassing Archive that has most of the
popularly recognized data, the most correct and complete
data?

The HIWG Archive on Roger Myre\'s page contains house rules,
maps, sector data (separately for M1100 and M1200), as well
as history and scenarios.  Perhaps this should be the Archive 
for sector data and history?

David Watson has Library Data on-line -- an EXTREMELY useful
resource.  (By the way, has anyone thought of adding
JavaScript to prompt the user for a potential entry--
thus loading the proper file if one exists?)  I suggest Mr. 
Watson have the honors of having the Library Data Archive.
As an aside, the page\'s presentation is nice too.

In fact, David\'s site is quite impressive, with hooks for
an incredible amount of data.  Perhaps his site could be
a model of sorts for these Archives?  Or if a standard
basic data set could be amassed, several sites could 
carry a complete set of data, with an index format like
David\'s site.  Simply wonderful...

I remember SOMEONE archiving the myriads of vehicles built
with CSC.  Shall that be the Equipment Archive?

There are starships and deckplans scattered all over.  Can
we get a central Archive for these?

Mr. Lockett\'s "Jackson Downport" looks like it could easily
be the Archive for GURPS Traveller.  Any opinions?

Please post your thoughts on this!  Do you think it\'s do-able?

Alas, Executor seems to expect you to be running (spit)Win95.  Oh, the

I know that Leonard Erickson was working on this, and I seem to recall some
others were as well.

Has anyone come up with a canonical list of all mentioned sectors and their
positions?

For example - Core is right above Massillia.  If Core is sector AA, with
the first letter being spin/trailing, and the second being core/rimward,
and with letters increasing towards trailing and rimward, then below core
is Massillia at AB, and to spinward is Dagagushag at BA.  Lishun is
Coreward of Core at Az.

Anyone done this?

I seem to recall that transponders HAD an on/off switch.  This was to keep
you from being hit by radio-homing missiles.  Of course, if the IN ever
looks at your log, the computer will have noted exactly when the
trnasponder was turned off, and when it was turned back on...  they will be
interested in knowing why you did this.

In my game, you can turn the transponder off.. you have to get the SPA to
turn it back on, and there is paperwork involved.  ("So, you were attacked
by Vargr corsairs seven weeks ago, and turned the transponder unit to avoid
detection.. might I ask why you\'ve waited this long to have it
reactivated?")

I am willing to help.  I have some Python scripts that I am using to alter
the FS data a bit, and it seems quite doable.

Here is what I have put together for my own revision of the M0 data:

We have exactly one sample planetary system, so we can put in almost any
data we want, BUT it seems to me that we should set up, in advance, some
ground rules for how things "should" be generated.  They may not be right,
but they are explicit.  Then, heretics can at least know what they are
disagreeing with.

Further, anything involving a computer should include the formulas, and as
detailed as it must be, but no more.  For example, anything that needs to
know the next world over is fine, but every world within one jump gets to
be a lot of data when ships are jump six.

I would suggest that we NOT compile the 1105 data, and revert, though I
would love to see the 1105 data compiled, but instead come up with the
growth patterns from the long night era, and try to preserve the important
1105 data by judicious alteration of M0.  After that, let progress
"naturally", as it seems like that will make later history more reasonable.

So, here are the guiding principles in my proposal.  Every one of these has
an exception, but an exception to these rules requires a hand wave, and so
should be rare:

1.  A world that is important will rarely drop to trivial status in as
little as a thousand years, if it survives at all.  Thus, the high pop
worlds in 1105 have a good chance of being high pop worlds in Y0, and were
likely important in -1776.  Even so, there are more high pop worlds in 1100
than there were in Y0.

Result: if we know the high pop worlds in M0, then we probably know them in
Y1100.

2.  Nearly everyone lost jump drive during the long night, and likely
fusion power, so important worlds in Y0 should be at least somewhat habitable.

Result: habitable worlds become important

3.  It requires a fair population base to generate and maintain high tech
levels, with the exceptions of very motivated people, or people supplied by
another world.  I am stating by fiat that leading edge post fusion
technology requires 10,000M people within one jump, peak TL-1 requires
1000M, peak TL-2 requires 100M, and peak TL-3 requires 10M.  Well designed
commerce networks, such as the Ziru Sirka, will drop one power of ten off
that, thus they could easily maintain local TL9 technology on most worlds,
but it would very unusual for a world to reach TL10, and the province
capitals, which had a billion people or more, could easily dominate them.

In M0, a normal world will need to have roughly 10M people either on it or
within jump 1 to maintain TL9, 100M for TL11, and 1000M for 12.  As a
result, the high pop worlds become the hubs for pocket empires, and the
expansionist philosophy of M0 makes sense.

Result: I cannot see any other reason for worlds that had some people in Y0
not being at least TL12 by Y1100, yet there were clearly a lot of low tech
worlds then.

3.  The Vilani were conservative, so primarily Vilani areas did not grow
fast, especially once they reached the "chosen population."

Result: this results in the low populations in later years, which a
thousand years of growth would otherwise give.

4.  It is easier to live somewhere if you can grow your own food on it.
Fusion lets you ignore this, but pre TL9, survival is difficult if food
does not grow.    Post TL12, you grow food with robots, but it still
reduces the danger of industrial accidents.

Result: "Good" worlds are more likely to have people than "Bad" worlds.

5.  Proposal number one: Add a resource rating to the UWP, a la Pocket
Empires.

Result: it is easier to tell what worlds are good if you know whether it is
an easy place to build things.  In my current game, Rich vs. Poor are
entirely determined by resources.

6.  Add a life rating.

Groundless assumption: after reading up on it, I am in the "Planets with
either oxy or reducing atmospheres and shirtsleeve temperatures are pretty
common, if planets exist at all in the system" camp, and thus, I suspect
the universe is teeming with life.  This can be argued, but it is how my
game is going.

Result: more places worth colonizing, and less DM angst, as players ask why
the colonists were stupid enough to colonize this icky world.

I am not claiming that you should find an earth-clone in every system, but
that if there is not one, then people would likely rather live in a colony
than on a scrungy world that is inherently dangerous, and that has gravity
to boot.

resulted in a few changes to how UWPs were calculated, and placed.

I note that the distribution of mass in the system makes it pretty easy to
get worlds of any size you like.  As a result, I am going to assume that
people will live either on mainworlds which are near habitable (size in the
..7 to 2 earth radii), or zero G worlds.  A size 2 world is likely the worst
option, so people will likely live in colonies around those.

The worlds in the system, not conditional on whether a person would think
of them as the "best" planet are a bit less contrived, as they follow
standard distributions.  I see little wrong with the usual method for
determining planetary size, as long as you are not assuming that people
picked it as the best place to live.

Number of bodies:
The standard distribution seems fine to me:
1D3-1 belts, 1D-1 gas giants, and 10 important orbits in a system, of which
two or three might have potentially habitable worlds, and one or two might
be in orbit around gas giants.

Size:
Main worlds are 20% size zero, and the rest uniform from size 6-B, for a
gravity range of 0.7 to 1.5 G, as this can hold an earthlike atmosphere,
though it may not have an earthlike mix.  Worlds in a system, not
conditional on this being a main world, follow a more standard distribution.

Atm:
Main worlds with gravity will usually have either oxy or reducing
atmospheres.  Some of the things I have read recently are fairly convincing
that the nitrogen fixing critters that gave us an oxy atmosphere should be
pretty likely.  This implies that most worlds with liquid water
temperatures will likely have a layer of scum that has given it an O2
atmosphere, possibly with some taints, and possibly not complete as yet.

Pressure ranges on most from 0.5-2.0 atm on worlds with 0.7G or more, with
perhaps a quarter having taints of some kind.

Water: worlds with the gravity to hold it will usually have a fair amount
of it, though if the temperature is extreme in either direction, it is not
going to be freestanding.  I do believe the gaia hypothesis to some extent
- - if life can form on a planet, it will ameliorate some of the
environmental swings.

Life: water worlds with decent atmospheres are very likely to have life, of
at least the pond scum variety.  Rate it on a 2D with modifiers.

Resources: rate it on a 2D.  For rating purposes, you should add one per
belt and one per gas giant.  (This does not depend on tech level - the
people doing the rating have starships even if the locals do not.)

Pop:  Half of the worlds are unpopulated, roughly, in m0.  See below for
details.

Xenophobia: 2D

Cohesiveness: 2D

Technological bias: 2D

Gov:  As before, but a flatter distributions.  Company planets would seem
to be more common in this era than later.  Further, lots of cohesiveness
would produce more oppressive government, I suspect.

Law: rate on 2D, modifiers for different government types.  I do not
believe that all religious dictatorships are going to be more repressive
than, say, oligarchies.  Instead, I think this is more a cultural trait

Desirability:

The desirability is the sum of the resources and the life scores.
Modifiers are:
+1 gas giant
+1 belts in system
+1 water refueling available

In addition, the colonization likelihood score is used to see where those
pop 9 and A world go next.  Take the desirability and add
+3 within one hex of a pop A world with space flight
+2 within one hex of a pop 9 world with space flight

This implies a two step process to place worlds, such that the pop A and
pop 9 worlds are placed first, then the scores are recalculated.  Note also
that the standard deviation of the desirability is something like 2, thus
being within one hex of a high pop world makes colonization roughly twice
as likely.

Population distribution:

3 in 36 are still high pop, but going above 10,000M requires TL9, and above
20,000 requires TL12.  13 in 36 have populations between a million and a
billion, which is somewhat more than in standard Traveller.  These are
distributed as 4 pop 8, 4 pop 7, and 5 pop 6.  2 in 36 have a population of
less than a million, and 18 in 36 are open for the taking.

From what I said above, you need a lot of people to maintain technology,
unless it is a primary societal goal.  By 1100, the average TL was around
12, representing around 1000M people working on technology in a given area,
with smaller high tech populations indicating more dedication on the part
of that society.

This is not as hard as it sounds - with J3 drives linking the universities
and research labs, a typical high pop world is in range of ~18 other
worlds, which likely means two other high pop worlds.  Further, any world
with space flight will be connected with ~three others in standard regions,
and so if they have populations ~3.3 million apiece, space flight will have
been maintained.

Placement algorithm:

Decide how many worlds are going to be designed in this batch.  The number
should be comfortably more than 36 for the population placement to be
statistically friendly.

Generate all of the physical stats.  Also decide how many pop A and pop 9
worlds will be placed, noting that these should be roughly 3 in 36.  (If
the dice are fair, it will be pretty close to that - the law of large
numbers keeps the variance pretty small.)

Select randomly among the worlds in the top quintile (top fifth) of
desirability score.  Note that while it would make sense for the worlds
near the high pop world to also be high pop, many of these were provincial
capitals in the Vilani era, and thus were spaced farther apart by design.

Create the colonization score by adding the modifiers for close high pop
worlds to the desirability scores as needed.

Allocate the remaining worlds at random, with the likelihood of a world
being populated being related to the colonization score.

An example:

We wish to develop a group of 16 hexes, which contain 8 worlds.  Typically,
a group of 8 only has a 2 in 3 of having a high pop world at all.  We dice
for the total list of populations to place by the above probabilities, and
find that we are placing
1 pop 9
1 pop 7
1 pop 6
1 pop 4
4 pop 0

It was fairly unlikely for this cluster to have any op 9 or A worlds at
all, and for it to have any worlds below pop 6, but it got lucky on both
counts.

We have determined the following physical stats:
     SAH---- -BG RL D  C
     ity---- -ea ei e  o
     zmd---- -ls sf s  l
     eor---- -tG oe i  o
     |so---- -si u| r  n

0202 674---- -10 A4 15 15

0303 A78---- -22 E5 20 20
0401 B75---- -11 68 15 15
0404 873---- -10 C6 19 19

Note that all but one of the shirtsleeve worlds got the plus one from water
refueling.

Now, we take the top quintile:

0303 A78---- -22 E5 20 20
0404 873---- -10 C6 19 20

Flipping a coin, we find that 0303 is now a pop 9 world.  This boosts the
colony scores of all worlds one hex away by one.

     SAH---- -BG RL D  C
     ity---- -ea ei e  o
     zmd---- -ls sf s  l
     eor---- -tG oe i  o

0401 B75---- -11 68 15 15
0404 873---- -10 C6 19 19

Now, we need only place the pop 7, pop 6 and pop 4 worlds, and we are done.

Ranked worlds:
hex  score
0404 19
0203 19 <- went up
0104 18
0202 17 <- went up
0102 16
0401 15
0101 10

Total colony score: 114.

By percentages:
hex  score cumulative
0404 17%   17%
0203 17%   34%
0104 16%   50%
0202 16%   66%
0102 14%   80%
0401 13%   93%
0101  7%   100%

Our 1-100 draws were (dropping duplicates) 23, 87, and 56.

Which makes the winners
0203 is the pop 7
0401 is the pop 6
0202 is the pop 4

     SAH---- -BG RL D
     ity---- -ea ei e
     zmd---- -ls sf s
     eor---- -tG oe i
     |so---- -si u| r

0202 6744-- -10 A4 15
0203 9767-- -20 79 17
0303 A78---- -22 E5 20
0401 B756-- -11 68 15
0404 873---- -10 C6 19

Note that we can now ignore the colony score, since we will not need it
again until we have a wave of expansion.

Note also that this makes it fairly unlikely that an asteroid world is
going to be a major hub of civilization, unless it has a just tremendous
resources score.  To me, this is fitting, as asteroid worlds have to work
harder to bring in food than other worlds, which means they have to have
very high resource ratings to be worth colonizing.

Note further that desirability is not the be all and end all.  A high
resources score is quite handy.

Please do not take this too badly, but I must strenuously disagree,  A
primary difference between Physics, Chemistry, and other hard sciences, and
Economics, along with many of the other social sciences is repeatability
and system independence.  Most of the hard sciences have varying degrees of
those, while the social sciences have a hard time inducing them.  I draw
this conclusion after earning two degrees in hard science, and working for
the last five years for Economists developing Econometric software, so I am
not arguing from a purely theoretical basis.

Repeatability:

Like cosmology, Economics has a hard time coming up with new data for a
previous situation - once the situation has passed, you have all of the
data you are ever likely to get on that economic climate.  Even if it
returns, it is not likely to be a similar situation.  This problem plagues
economists, especially since when you start abstracting things in the model
to make it one that might be general enough to apply to more than a single
economic era, the benefits of the models tend to vanish.

This might arguably be solved with better computing power, and a more
comprehensive model of how societies function.  I do believe, for instance,
that the Vilani system was far better understood, as they had much less
diversity, and thus could reasonably expect to see similar situation arise.

System independence:

The physical universe cannot change behavior according to our current
theories, while the people who practice and formulate economics can alter
the behavior of the people they are trying to model.  For instance, recent
census data has pointed out the new trends in child rearing, especially as
it affects the number of single parents.  This information has already
started to affect the debates on welfare and other issues, which means that
a model that perfectly predicted behavior without that information would
have some added difficulty.

I am aware that QM implies a lack of observer independence, but on the
macro scale that most hard sciences take place, observer independence is
still effective.  For example, if you are measuring the Hall effect, which
depends on QM, you will get statistically significant experimental results
which match a colleague with different expectations, even if the data has
already been published.

Clearly, clearly, but it is easier to do this in the physical sciences
where you system does not adapt to what you do quite so well, and where
your system can be reset to the initial state so you can look at it in detail.

[accounting conventions mentioned]

While this is true in the abstract, I believe that economics, by its very
nature, is going to be affected by its conventions more than the hard
sciences usually are.  Economists have a great deal of difficulty isolating
factors under investigation, which include the responses to accounting
conventions.  I do not mean data isolation with statistical techniques, I
mean actually separating a group of people and their behaviors from the
outside world, so that they can be examined under different events.  Much
like psychology, you have a hard time controlling the initial conditions,
and the behaviors are determined in part by those accounting conventions.

Let me say it another way - an engineering convention, such as the sign on
the electron\'s charge, can be accounted for.  Likewise a good physicist can
get an idea of how well their measurement device works, which falls out of
those engineering conventions.  The economist, on the other hand, cannot so
easily separate the behavior of people from the accounting convention that
engendered the behavior.

Clearly, economists do try to make their plans usable over the long term,
but the difficulties inherent in their task will cause small amounts of
noise in their models to amplify, such that it is very difficult to make a
long term prediction good enough to convince someone of an economic good
that is a decade away.  In other words, before being worried about a crisis
predicted for a decade from now, I am going to examine what the same group
said ten years back, and see if they have any credibility over that time
horizon.

Note: hard scientists also have their share of such things.  Any time you
try to make a model of a complex system, and push your models beyond design
constraints, you are going to have some amount of difficulty.  Predicting
weather a decade hence is about a tough as predicting the market over the
same time period.  Neither is very reliable after next week.

"Someone" wrote the article?  Someone??

Phbht.  And it wasn\'t based on US law, actually, very much at all.

We\'ve been around the circle a number of times on the list here
with various people on each side, arguing about "Imperial Law"s
view of how the legal system should work.  I personally think that
the article is still ok, but to fit best with the canonical universe you
have to emphasize the Imperial concentration on keeping trade and
commerce flowing smoothly.  Your mileage will, of course, vary.

  There may be some difference in what is being addressed here. The modern
discipline of Economics certainly has as valid a claim to the "status" of
a science as most of the humanities. OTOH, it is probably a bit more prone
to normative evaluations than chemistry, for example.

  OC, the FarFuture Vilani model of Economic theory probably was perfected
around 1000 AD. But practical (small e-) economic decision-making on a day
to day basis is going to be much less theoretical and affected by the lower
level of the actors involved and the influences on their objectives.

  Certainly a discussion of the 3I\'s "economic" objectives requires some
analysis of what valuations go into their decision process. Some of those
factors will be the result of political or philosophical debates, which
can only complicate the issue.

I have to agree, I saw these deck plans a while back and was impressed.
I\'ve just looked again and am still impressed.  One snag I\'ve run into is
in printing them out (over a network to a Hewlett Packard 5P), only bits of
them seem to print.  Has anyone else had this problem (I\'m assuming it\'s
something wrong at my end rather than the deck plans themselves).  Could it
be because they\'re US paper size and I don\'t seem to be able to adjust that
kind of thing in Acrobat?  Has anyone else solved this or am I going to
have to lay the computer monitor flat and play with minatures on the screen
itself?!



>others. :) If only I could get paid for doing it... BITS: Need help on
>101 Deckplans? <big grin>

I shouldn\'t jest about that kind of thing, last time I half-heartedly
suggested a 101 book it was taken up with great alacrity by other denizens
of TML.  As a fan of the BITS 101 series, I\'d love to see 101 of your
deckplans added to the range, so get badgering Andy....  (of course, could
be tricky getting them sensibly into a BITS sized book).

All the best and keep up the good work.

The Vilani use the deshi as the basic unit of distance in their mapping
system, as the Solomani and 3I use the parsec.  As Solomani and 3I drives
are rated as how many parsecs a ship can jump, Vilani rate a ship as how
many deshi they can jump.

Vilani maps would be slightly different than 3I maps, with each subsector
being 12x15.  Some of the stars would seemingly ship position, such that
two stars 1 hex(parsec) apart on the 3I maps could be 1 or 2 hexes(deshi)
apart on the Vilani maps.

1 Vland Year = 478.72 standard days (apx 1.31 standard years), so a Vilani
light-year = 1.31 standard light-years.

1 deshi = 2.17 standard light-years = 1.66 Vilani light-years.
1 parsec = 3.26 standard light-years = 2.49 Vilani light-years.

So, what would be the Vilani equivalent of a parsec?  At what distance
from Vland would a star have to be to show a stellar parallax of one
second of arc?

r = 206265 (D/p)  where r is distance, D is baseline, p is arcseconds.

The baseline would be the distance of Vland to its primary = 1.6 AUs

r = 206265 * 1.6 = 330024 AU = 5.216 standard light years = 3.98 Vilani
light years.

Of course, the Vilani parsec is really a meaningless number since is
assumes that the Vilani measure 360 degrees in a circle.

Hi

I\'ve read the piracy debate and just thought I\'d add what happened on =
Wednesday, for what it\'s worth.

The Far Trader Angel Afloat was programmed to jump to Djinni instead of =
Regina by a member of the crew. Before the Captain could do anything she =
was hailed by a Gazelle class cruiser. Outgunned and out manoeuvred she =
decided she didn\'t have any choice but to be boarded.

The pirates, actually political dissidents (It\'s a long story) boarded =
the ship. The PC\'s offered no resistance as they took away one of the =
passengers. The Pirates then left the Angel to refuel at the Gas Giant =
and head onto Regina.

I suppose that what I am saying is that piracy work if:

1)	The crew believe that they have no chance of winning a fight.
2)	The crew expect to be left alive after boarding
3)	The crew have no attachment to whatever the pirates want.

The major problem as I see it is that is worth more to sell the ship =
than take a risk on low returns. That is why I think most pirates would =
be sponsored by a world or organisation with its own agenda.

Andrew

PS: Does anyone know where I can get details of Regina and surrounds =
from the web. Thanks.

Yes, there is a complete list on a webpage on the internet. I\'m sorry, I 
do not know the adress at the time, but I included the data to my database.
Every Sector in an area of 18 * 12 sectors is named! Much of these also 
got their subsector names.
If no one knows where the website was, I\'ll search for it - or give my 
copy of the data.

In a way, this is a shame.  I wonder how many lurkers might join the

Not so, good Sir! 

I\'ve run it using DOS, using Windows 3.1 running in DOS, in a DOS box
running in OS/2 Warp, and in a DOS box running in Windows 95.  Of course,
the demo version only runs 10 minutes and that limits design time, but it
works...and Rob\'s CSC program works like a charm.

IAC, Glenn Hoppe has an Excel spreadsheet called Vehicle Factory that does
CSC vehicles. I haven\'t played with it...I dl\'ed it but got sidetracked. 
Knowing Glenn it\'s probably good.

Unfortunately I\'m going to have to shatter a myth here. The BITS profits go
towards promoting Traveller in the UK etc, which is why BITS is allowed to
publish supplements, So it\'s by-lines only folks... that may change if IG
subsequently buys the supplement to use (eg, the long way home) but Andy
Lilly or Dave Burden are the people to ask on that front.

Of course, if BITS were ever to distribute (for example - Mac) shareware
over here in Europe, the profits would be directed back to the author...
but the 101 stuff (certainly Lifeforms) isn\'t making aprofit for the
authors.

The parsec is approximately 3.26 light years. It\'s based on the AU.
Which is baserd on the size of earth\'s orbit.

Astronomers mostly use parsecs, because they can measure them
"directly". That is, for stars relatively nearby, you can measure the
apparent position of the star at opposite sides of earth\'s orbit, and
the angular difference converts directly into parsecs.

Similar techniques give the distances of the other bodies in the solar
system in terms of the size of earth\'s orbit. 

So astronomers make observations that give *relative* distances.
Measurements in *absolute* distances depend on how accurately they can
measure the size of earth\'s orbit.

The "light year" is a reall "iffy" unit. It depends on *two* variables.
The speed of light, and the length of the year. While the speed of
light has relatively recently been made a defined constant, the length
of the year is a bit vaguer. Heck, you have to decide *which* year you
mean. The calendar year (365.2425 days), the tropical year (~365.2422
days), the siderial year...

I agree that more clarification is needed in those situations - but I would
argue (having run T4 since November 1996 under these rules) that in
general, the rules are quite good at the moment. Emperor\'s Arsenal helped
clarify a lot.

The areas that seem grey to me are:

- - The EA rapid and very rapid fire rules/

- - Falling damage (damage level, and effects of gravity on this)

- - What the kinetic damage limit applies to (I don\'t apply it to lasers,
explosives, HEAP. I do apply it to plasma weapons as they have a seperate
explosive entry)? I have no real problems with this limit.

- - Lasers - the main rules have a laser (TL12 Damage 7) available for
civilian use before military use. In addition, lasers are available 4 TL
higher than they appeared in CT and MT. However, a lower tech level laser
would probably break the design rules....

nothing more than a series of fairly loose models of human behavior
which are far too simplistic.  Anyone with experience in the behavior

hopeless for modeling actual marketplace activity.

However, economics is extremely useful in the modern world for
one simple reason, most politicians and business people believe in it.
If the Treasury department and most major corporations are
basing their decisions on economic models, even if the models are
false economics will have a rather large impact on our society.

Essentially, it\'s a vast shell game, but it is also a very important shell
game.

Assuming that the Vilani and other cultures have no greater

come up with their own economic "laws".  Now, likely

But why can\'t you just put an on/off switch on the cable running from the
transponder to its antenna. Or something that will fool the transponder
into thinking that it is sending. That would keep the athourities from
ever knowing about why you switched it off, unless they do a fine search
of the ship and finds the switch.

   Obviously, repeatability is crucial to any scientific enterprise.
   That\'s why economic theories explaining well repeated data are
   more reliable than those that aren\'t.  The same holds true for
   Physics theories by the way.

   All scientists must account for system-dependent variables in their
   theories.  Obviously, this is harder to do in some disciplines than
   others.  Medical research in particular is plagued with this problem,
   at least when it is conducted morally.

   This is a different issue.  Observer bias has tainted many
   observations in all fields.  All researchers need to work hard to
   overcome this problem.  A true economist does his best to remain
   disinterested, but this can easily be forgotten by a public whose main
   exposure to economics is via the political ax-grinders on the news
   shows who use statistics to lie.  This is a flaw in the economist, not
   in Economics.

   I certainly agree that some sciences are more difficult than others.
   Economics is certainly not as reliable as Physics.  But the truth that
   both disciplines work at uncovering (with varying success rates) is
   objective.

   I agree that it is harder in Econ than in Phys, but in principle it is
   still possible.
   
   I think our discussion has moved pretty far afield of my original
   intent, and I think part of the problem has been miscommunication
   on my part.  Words like Physics and Economics have two meanings:
   they refer to the field studied and to the study of the field, 
   to the truth and to the discipline of studying the truth.  The
   discipline of Physics is practiced and mispracticed by flawed
   human beings, but the physics studied by Physics is objectively
   real.  I believe the same is true for economics and Economics.
   
   The original poster (Glenn, was that you?) gave me the impression
   that he believed that economics should not be a direct factor 
   in resolving issues of environmental policy.  Now if he meant that
   the biases of Economics as practiced by biased economists should
   not dominate our policy, then I would agree (but I\'d still point
   out that not all economists are biased).

   I think you\'re right on both counts.  I think we have been discussing different
   things to some extent (economics vs. Economics).  And I think that Economics
   is a softer science than Biology or Physics (though not so soft as Sociology).

I may be incredibly naive here, but wouldn\'t installing the switch
necessitate breaking the signal? What if the antenna electronics needed
to respond to the transponder? (two way encrypted) Or even better...
what if the transponder were built into the antenna? (big black box)

Yep. Twas me.

I believe that Economics is used, too often, as the *only* factor in
resolving issues of environmental policy. That is wrong.

There are more important factors that should be given more weight.

After all, is Economics not a human construct defining human behaviors
with respect to trade? Economics deals with distribution of wealth
between groups or members of a group. We need to deal with how we
interact with the Environment. Economics has little to do with that.

I\'ve always run transponders as independent devices from the main commo gear.  The
transponder is patched into the main _radio_ antenna for send/receive, but also
has an independant antenna as a backup.  As I run them, they monitor incoming
signals for one of several specific code impulses (we call it \'pinging\').  When a
transponder receives one of the codes, it responds in a specific manner, reporting
to the commo console that it is sending information.

Mayday signal (GK) - returns ship name
Ping by commercial ship - returns ship\'s class and name (configurable by certified
starport technician)
Ping by Patrol ship - returns ship\'s class and name, as well as the shipid number
(not configurable)

Basically, if you send a mayday - the transponders of all ships receiving that
signal automatically transmit a response.  This helps enforce the Imperial
regulation that ships must respond to maydays.

Any ship can query your transponder for your ship name and class.

Patrol ships and IN ships can query your ship for name, class, and the shipid
number that is unique to each ship when the transponder is installed.

Because of the potential abuse of the transponder (building a missile that \'pings\'
the transponder of a target, then uses the transmission to home in on, for
example), the transponder has three states controllable by the command crew.  ON -
automatically receives and replies to pings.  STANDBY - receives but does not
automatically reply to pings, they require the commo officer to manually authorize
the reply, EXCEPT - when the source is IN or SYSDEF using a override code, the
transponder will reply.  SILENT - in this mode, the transponder does not reply to
override signals.  Use of this mode will generally require a detailed explanation
when discovered.  To officials that are not nice people to have to talk to.

All transponder signals, and statuses, are automatically entered in the ship\'s
log.

Picking up in the middle here so...

[Warning: Request for an appeal to your congresscritter follows]

Either you\'re saying there is no money to be made or that there is no
funding for research...The first is too obviously wrong to spend time on,
so to the second.

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Fusion Energy budget this year is
$232 Million (source: DOE Home Page) which is, of course, a pittance.  For
comparison, however, solar energy got $269M.  The whole Energy Science and
Research budget is $996M and the entire DOE Budget is $14 Billion.

In terms of probability of result, it is quite likely that we will,
eventually, bring the correct engineering solution to bear on the problem
of how to make fusion energy.  In the near term, however, there is much
more likelyhood of success making the IC engine more efficient.  The
current Best Hope is ITER or the International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor, one portion of which is being test-fabricated here at MIT.
Unfortunately fighting for funding with congress for a reactor which will
be sited in another country (especially since Japan is the proposed
location) is definitely an uphill battle.

If you feel so inclined after reading the above, please email or mail or
call your representative to advocate for Fusion Enegry research.  They
really do listen and can really affect the budget in the next year (best
timing is July-August, but anytinme will be helpful).

We science-fiction types know that cheap energy will not solve all the
worlds problems, but I think we also know that it will solve a lot of
problems, and avoid a whole passel of others.

Rob I think you are close...but not quite on.

Awhile ago (when I had more time) I began a project.  Not an archive in
reality, but an archive of *links*.  I will email you the pretty big
bookmark file I have which represents some portion of the unimaginable
amount of work involved apon request via private email.  As you will see I
only got partway there...and I don\'t even know how big a part!

The archive subject matter is already out there.  What is needed is a
comprehensive (think about that) "bookmark" page with links to all that
content in an organized, categorized, maybe even searchable form.

My opinion.

Why, indeed?  The Templars would never permit this sort of interefence with
their plans to wipe out the Vilani using common Terran bacteria, backed up
by space fighters (which are an economically rational way to fight
battlecruisers).

	Would the ship\'s computer then advise the captain with some audible, high
priority  signal that a course change is needed to intercept the ship in
distress? And could a more advanced on board computer system automatically
lay in a course, then wait for the captain to tell helm to make it so, as

Well, if you have your sentient computer standing bridge watches, I see no problem
with that.

Otherwise, it will depend on the ship, the computer, and the standing orders.  If
you are running under autopilot, with the expert program running, and the
SIGKAUTORESP set to AUTO - then I\'d say it would also automatically set the course.

Most ships, however, I think would just have a visual/audible alarm sound at the
commo and command workstations.  ;)

The Vilani were beaten by the Solomani.  When they took over the Vilani
Empire they naturallly forced their own units of measure on the Vilani,
as conquerers often do, for their own convenience.  When the Rule of Man
collapsed the Vilani had been using the Solomani units of measurement
for hundreds of years.  Being conservative they did not bother to change
back to the units their ancestors had used for thousands of years prior
to this point.  By the time of the Third Imperium the Vilani units of
measure were totally dead everywhere - except perhaps on Vilani "lost
colonies" never conquered by the Solomani.  Vanegan in the Spinward
Marches may be such a place.

Not to speak bad of OS/2, let\'s not forget that it runs under Linux, and I
believe there is also a version for NextStep/OPENSTEP on Intel.  I was
rather impressed with it a couple of years ago, at the time it could almost
do what I needed to, but I ended up buying a Mac.

As has been pointed out the system requirements for CSC are pretty low.
Just drop in at your local Thift Store every now and then, and you\'ll
probably be able to find a Mac Plus or Mac SE very cheap (well under $100)
to run it on.  These are a couple of the models based on the original small
footprint, so they won\'t take up much space.

Title: Famille Spofulam Armaments Releases new BattleDress-Weapon,
Integrated Multi-Purpose System (BD-WIMPS).

Author: Zhigupaa Diskuutenshcko

Dateline: Linth, Imperial Weapon Testing Range


	"Famille Spofulam has done it again.  Actually, they haven\'t.  I
don\'t think _anyone_ has ever done this before.

	Responding to a percieved (at least by the FSA Design Bureau) gap
in current armament suites available for BattleDressed troops, Famille
Spofulam Armaments has developed what they term the BattleDress-Weapon,
Integrated Multi-Purpose System (abbreviated to BD-WIMPS, or WIMP).  It
permits single-Marine deployment of a high-powered 12mm full-auto chemical
slugthrower, a 33.3mm HE/SEFOP grenade launcher, a backpack napalm
dispenser, a chemical weapon dispening system capable of handling anything
from Blur to advanced neurotoxins...  and a 0.1 kiloton rocket-propelled
fission warhead.

	The weapon has two major components, which together total 109.5
kilograms fully loaded.  These consist of a backpack, which integrates a
cassette holding 500 12mm X 70 mm rounds for the rifle (which is more
accurately described as a heavy machinegun), and 15-kg tanks for both the
Napalm and chemical weapon dispensers.  Aside from carrying ammo, the
backpack component also includes a robotic arm designed to grasp and
retract the rifle component upon the operator\'s handing it back over their
right shoulder, and to deploy it into the operator\'s hands when needed.

	The rifle component itself is an extremely large (116 cm overall)
and bulky bullpup-configured weapon, with the pump-action grenade launcher
slung under the barrel, and the compressors and nozzles for the
flamethrower to either side of the grenade launcher.  The PAWS-12
electronic sighting system is mounted on a flange extending diagonally
outwards and to the left of the weapon, to allow room on the top of the
rifle component for the Nuke Bazooka launcher package, a disposable
packaged 0.1 kiloton rocket-propelled tactical nuke coming in a 77 cm by 20
cm 22.5 kilogram cylindrical package.  The disposable launcher package
simply dovetails into a mount on top of the rifle component, and accesses
data from the PAWS-12.

	At a price of 50,000 cr, not including the Nuke Bazooka package
which [classified], the BD-WIMPS is approximately double the price of a
PCMP-12.  However, unlike the PCMP-12, it permits the operator to deploy
non-lethal incapacitants as well as more lethal chemical agents, does not
present a massive EMS signature when fired, draws no power from the
BattleDress suit\'s onboard power plant, and provides superior
armour-penetration capability, not to mention the extreme destructive
potential of a nuclear warhead.  Thus, according to FSA, it provides
longer-term field operation, greater stealth, and better operational
flexibility than a PCMP.

	At FSA\'s launch of the BD-WIMPS at the Linth Imperial Weapon
Testing Range (which was slightly marred by their caterers being denied
security clearance at the last moment), the weapon was demonstrated by one
Winiipitaa Spofulam, a great-niece of FS head Hengabar Spofulam.  As Mr.
Spofulam provided running commentary, the winsome Miss Spofulam
demonstrated impressive BattleDress ability for someone of such tender
years as she demolished a series of targets over an obstacle course at the
IWTR.

	The weapon performed much as advertised; the rifle component can
neutralize targets wearing ABD-12, not to mention unarmoured personnel.
The HE grenade rounds provide respectable blast radius, and the SEFOP
rounds are devastating against vehicular targets (let alone armoured
troops; the sound of girlish laughter as a BattleDressed target had a
30-cm-plus hole blown through its breastplate and out its back was
chilling).  The napalm dispenser provides adequate short-range incendiary
capability.  As the reviews stands were not sealed against chemical agents,
Winnie (as Mr. Spofulam affectionately referred to her) did not have the
opportunity to spray nerve gas everywhere with gay abandon.  Fortunately,
neither did she have the chance to demonstrate the effects of a live
nuclear warhead, although the dummy round she fired did impact the non-LOS
target with impressive accuracy.

	Given FSA\'s cheerful disregard of the lack of any Imperial RFP\'s in
developing the BD-WIMPS, it is uncertain whether Imperial forces will adopt
the system.  However, given Famille Spofulam\'s indiscriminate marketing
practices, it is entirely probable that BD-WIMPS will find their way onto a
battlefield at some point...

Zane, not to speak ill of *any* operating system, but I haven\'t tried it
under Linux or NextStep, so I couldn\'t comment on them. I only commented on
the systems I\'d tried it in, and only so that I could point out that it
should run on the hardware/system that Doug was discussing.

Maybe were you live, but I haven\'t run across any working Mac of *any*
model for under $500 where I live...and that\'s more than I want to pay.

I have combined the information in Marc\'s post with what I could gather from
GDW\'s Alien Modules and have placed the sectors an Excell 5.0 sheet, layed
out in map fasion. I\'ve also, in a fit of inspiration (or something ;>)
color coded the sectors and added the Aslan names to the sectors bordering
Aslan space (as shown in AM 1). It does NOT include the Zhodani data since I
do not have that book. If anyone is interested send me private mail and I
will send it in ZIP format. It does not include Zhodani information since I
don\'t own that book, if anyone adds it I would appriciate a copy!

Roderick,

The FSA posts are probably one of the highlights of the List. All we need
now is to see them compiled into their own book, suggested title "What I Did
On My Summer Vacation, and Other Pleasant Diversions"! Keep them up, please!

I have always had the opinion that a jumping ship emerges pretty close to
anywhere in the target system, to reflect this uncertanity. In effect, the
exit point is random, although safety functions prevents the shipfrom
emerging in a gravity well (i.e. inside or very near a planet).

I have e-mailed you privately.  In summary, the USA is a victim of its 
own success ... by being the richest nation on earth you inevitably, 
under the current technology, create the most waste, the most CO2

Galactic 2.2 and 2.3 (for DOS) include jump route data, but I do not recall what 
format is used to store this data in the sub-sector files.  One of the problems 
is using a notation that shows that the jump route is into an adjacent sector.

I, and doubtless others, have proposed that we come up with a "TML approved"

discussion on the TML about the use of consistent system generation algorithms 
earlier in the year.  I proposed an algoritm based on UWP and hex (as not all 
planets are named, and home-grown universes with some previous sectors in might 
not use a compatible sector numbering system) for creating the seed.  The random 
number method in the Traveller Tools Group was one option, but other 
(unspecified) random number algorithms are reputedly better.

If you compare the dollar costs, then recycling an aluminium can is more 
expensive than making a new one for virtually every industrialised 
country... some of the "greener" european nations offer a tax benefit 
for recycling plants to make it worth their while to recycle aluminium 
and tin.  This is also true for glass bottles (nearly all of which were 
recycled in the UK 25 years ago ... my pocket money would often be 
supplemented by getting a penny back on each bottle returned to the 
shops).  These days, even allowing for bottle banks (a salve to the 
green movement in my opinion), bottles and jars typically only contain 
10% recycled glass because of quality concerns (a high recycled content 
gives a weaker container).  Many products in UK supermarkets are more 
expensive and of poorer quality if they use recycled parts (black bin 
liners, toilet paper, writing paper).

I don\'t want to get onto a green campaigning box here, but recycling is 
expensive - particularly the manpower intensive sorting required for 
some types of recycled matrial.  By keeping raw materials cheap from 
third world countries (GATT benefits the industrialised natons much more 
than the developing world), the industrial nations can maintain their 
relative wealth.

Traveller:  cost-efficient open cast mining of lo-pop worlds is a huge 
source of raw materials for interstellar trade.  Hi-pop planets do not 
want those unsightly, polluting mining operations on their world.  
Besides, do you realise how much more it costs to pay a miner on a 
starport A, TL E world, compared to that port D, TL 8 mining colony over 
there?

Summary:
     2.00 displacement ton box;  20.3 tonnes;  kCr 203
Chassis:
     28.0 kL box (4.7 m long x 2.4 m wide x 2.4 m high);  Structure: 713 kg
of hard steel, rated for 1.0Gs, body 0.30 cm thick, 4 armour rating
     
Performance:
     1.50 MW TL4 Internal Combustion power plant;  Fuel: 1.50 kL of
hydrocarbons (1.50 tonnes), 10 hours supply
     Propulsion System: 1.50 MW wheels with bulletproof tires; 
Maximum Speed: 90 km/h; 
Range: 897 km;  Agility: +3DM (0.1G)
Crew & Passengers:
     Crew roster: driver;  1 crew station;  1 cramped passenger seat
Communications:
     Subregional Radio (1 W, TL5, SmVcl)
Sensors:
     No sensors installed.
Other:
     15.3 kL of cargo space

Whenever valuable goods must be transported, there are those who would steal
them. Thieves stand no chance against the Pinkerton armoured car. 3mm hard
steel armour and bulletprrof tires foil any attempt to open the truck, while
the standard-issue radio allows the guard to call for assistance in the
unlikely event that the assailants set up a roadblock.

.... and, in fact, immediately after the demonstration, Ms. Tunngardaya of
the Number Fifteen Xenopolitical Investigative Embassy was heard to extend
an invitation to Winiipitaa -- and her great-uncle, of course -- to visit
the Sayat Concourse.  In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the BD-WIMPS,
that is.  Meanwhile, other members of #15 sacrificed several hapless small
animals at Hengabar Spofulam\'s feet and attempted to paint "lucky symbols"
onto his person using the fresh blood.

Imperial military police are presently investigating the question of how
the animals were smuggled onto the testing grounds.

[Seriously, FS and its output are the coolest.  Is there an archive of FS
material anywhere?  There should be!]

	Hmmm ... does the Imperium still use titanium pins or screws to

	Not just nuclear--Fuel-Air Explosives (FAEs) are often referred

	I recall Heinlein used infrasonics to induce feelings of unease

A while back I was looking for a Hard Drive for a Mac Plus, just a small
external one.  I finding one on the net, it ended up being cheaper to by a
complete system, it cost $50.  Every now and then you can find really cheap
Macs on the Net.

but last I checked it was between $100-200.  If space isn\'t an issue the
real thing can be cheaper, and run a greater range of software.  Although
if the system you\'re running Executor on if a Pentium or better, Executor
almost guarented to be faster than any Mac you\'ll find in that price range.

	Another problem with the rules manifested itself when we were
working FF&S2--there\'s no distinction between the ability of a
weapon to do damage, and the ability to penetrate armor. And they
are different. TO do damage, you want to deposit as much energy
as you can in the "vital" portions of the target. But to
penetrate, you want to lose as _little_ energy as possible in the
armor or outer portions of the target. So a weapon that
penetrates really well may go straight through that Imperial
Stormtrooper coming at you, leaving only a small hole. But a
weapon that only does high damage but doesn\'t penetrate well
might only knock him down without going through his armor.

	One example of this is the problem with the original CSC
damage/armor relationship. It resulted in a 250kg HE bomb being
able to penetrate almost a quarter of a kilometer of solid stone.
Now, an HE bomb does quite a bit of damage, but it won\'t
penetrate solid stone THAT well. Instead, it\'ll make a crater a
meter or two across.

THE ULTIMATE TML COUNTRY & WESTERN SONG: LIFE AT POINT ONE CEE


	Them faceless bureaucrats done confiscated mah truck,
And arrested Ma and billed me for costs
	Since I ain\'t got not vote, I\'m pretty well stuck
And the Proctors done told me "GET LOST!"

	Oh life at point one Cee ain\'t no fun
All the good ol boys here got but one eye
	And since the Law Level\'s E I ain\'t got a gun
They done took mah cargo and left me to die

	But the worst is that perverted compuuuter
It rolls too many dice to be easily read
	It killed Jim-Bob with a roto-roooter
And it yowls about duty \'till I\'m sore in the head

	Oh life at point one Cee ain\'t no fun
All the good ol boys got too many tattoos
	And since the Law Level\'s E I ain\'t got a gun
They done took all mah clothes but my shoes

	The other day I went huntin\' with my PMPP
When two klicks away I saw my first doe
	Thanks to the recoil I can now sing High C
But boy, away that deer did I blow!

	Oh life at point one Cee ain\'t no fun
All the good ol boys got gears in their heads
	Said I "sentient \'puters can be done"
They done flamed me and left me for dead

	One dark day along came JP and Leroy
They said "TL-Fifteen Rule of Man"
	This started a feud like Hatfield & McCoy
With the Berrys and Harold and Ethan*

	Oh life at point one Cee ain\'t no fun

	It\'s a fairly simple matter to sense a break in a circuit, such
as a simple switch causes. In fact, although I\'m no expert, I
understand it\'s possible to determine exactly *where* the break
is. So the transponder package would *know* its connection to the
antenna has been cut off. Higher electronic wizardy should  be
able to patch in a precisely-matched dummy circuit to "look" like
an antenna to the transponder, electronically, but the cutover
between the real antenna and the "stealth" circuit might still be
detectable.

	For that matter, it\'s probably more foolproof than simply a
black box, connected by coax to a whip antenna on the hull. Off
the top of my head, I\'d probably have the "transponder box" deep
within the ship for protection, connected to "antenna boxes"
spaced properly around the hull for full 360 degree coverage, and
an encrypted two-way link going on between them. All boxes would
be sealed against tampering, and if the transponder box loses
contact with even one of the antenna boxes, it\'d set a flag. 

	You can still *tell* the transponder to stop sending, and that\'d
set a different kind of flag. After all, there are legitimate
reasons you\'d want to go through the proper procedure to stop
your transponder signal. There aren\'t legitimate reasons you\'d
want to tamper with it to stop it.

describes various scientific and survey uses a sensor can be put to.

1. Detecting gas giant planets

	PEMS sensors are capable of detecting gas-giant planets
orbiting stars at a significant distance. The chart below is for a "typical"
gas giant:

Sensor Sensivitity	Maximum Range (parsecs)
13			2
13.5			20 
14			200
14.5			500
15.0+			1000

Detecting such a planet is a Difficult task, modified by -1 DM if the range
is <1/10 of the sensor\'s maximum range, -1 DM if the range is < 1/100.
If the sensor is not science-grade, the task is +2 DM more difficult.
The task is also optionally modified by the stellar type, location of the
gas giant, and the gas giant size. If the sum of all modifiers results
in a task more difficult than "Impossible" it may not be attempted.


Range < 1/10 of maximum -1 DM
Range < 1/100 of max	-2 DM
Science sensor		0 DM
non-science sensor	+2 DM

star	O-A		-1 DM
	F-G		0
	K-M		+1 DM

GG orbit inner zone	+3 DM
	 habitable zone +1 DM
	 outer zone	0 DM

GG size small		+1 DM
	large		0 DM
	brown dwarf	-1 DM

Scanning typically requires 1 day. If only 1 hour is available, the task
is +1 DM more difficult. If 1 month is available, the task is -1 DM easier.
Multiple attempts to detect the same gas giant by a given ship are not
allowed.

The referee should roll this task in secret. In addition the refere should
roll 1d6 for each gas giant; if the result is a "1", the gas giant is
undetectable at this time. Successful detection provides the gas giant\'s
orbital separation and approximate mass. On a spectactular failure, the
sensor operator detects a gas giant that is not actually present.



2. Detecting normal planets

A similar process can be used to detect earthlike planets, though of course
the maximum range is shorter:

13.5			1 
14			5
14.5			25
15+			50

Detecting a planet is a Staggering task.

Range < 1/10 of maximum -1 DM
Science sensor		0 DM
non-science sensor	+3 DM

star	O-A		-1 DM
	F-G		0
	K-M		+1 DM

GG orbit inner zone	+2 DM
	 habitable zone +0 DM
	 outer zone	+0 DM

Planet size 0		+2 DM
	    1-4	        +1 DM
	    5-9		0 DM
	    A		-1 DM
	 asteroid belt  0 DM

The referee should roll this task in secret. In addition the refere should
roll 1d6 for each planet; if the result is a "1", the planet is
undetectable at this time.
Successful detection determines the planets radius and orbit. Once the planet
has been detected a second attempt may be made to study it; this requires
an additional day and is a Formidable task with all the modifiers given
above. Success informs the sensor operator of the planet\'s atmosphere type
and hydrographic percentage. Staggering success informs the operator of the
presence of life (if any) and of a technological civilization (population 7+
TL 7+) if any.


3. Surveying a system.

Inside a system, any starship sensor of sensitivity > 12 will detect all
planets within the system in one turn (1/2 hour) of scanning. 

A sensor can scan a planet for detailed information out to a range given
by the sensor\'s sensitivity +2. 
Determining the atmosphere and hydrographic percentage is an Average task
(Difficult with a non-science sensor) Determining the presence of 
widespread life (such as on Earth) is also an Average task. 

In orbit around a planet, conducting a detailed biological or mineralogical 
survey requires twelve hours per hex surveyed. Accurately determining the 
presence of sparese life in a hex (such as would be found on Earth in a 
desert or the Arctic) is a Formidable task. Detecting extremely sparse/
subsurface life (such as may exist on Mars) requires is an Impossible
task with a sensor of sensitivity 13-14, a Staggering task with a sensor
of higher sensitivity. Detecting surface mineral deposits is a Average
task. A quick survey - 1 hour per hex - increases the
difficulty of these tasks by +1 DM. Using a non-science sensor increases
the difficulty by 2.  The survey task assumes both a PEMS and an AEMS or 
LIDAR are present; if only an AEMS is used increase difficulty by +2 DM,
if only PEMS is used increase difficulty by +1 DM.
The sensor resolution (from the chart in FFS2) gives an 
idea of the typical feature size that can be seen - for example, a 14.0
sensor can see details as fine as 1m from a high (50,000km) surveying orbit
and 0.01m from a 500km orbit.

I\'m almost certain that something like this has been done before, but
I\'ve created 3 web based word generators for Vargr, Vilani and Zhodani.
They are written in HTML/Javascript, and so should work in any
compatible browser (only tested on IE3 and IE4 on a PC so far).
They can be found at the following URL :

http://www.glisten.demon.co.uk/traveller.htm

The best thing about them is the size, the Vilani one is only 6k! This
compares to my VB version which runs to a couple of hundred k (although
that one does allow the user to define their own languages quite easily
- - I\'ll get it finished soonish if anybody is interested).

If anyone does take a look, could you let me know if the results being
produced seem OK, please? All three are \'no frills\', let me know about
any enhancements which are wanted. I\'ll get round to doing Droyne and
Aslan sometime in the next week.

But what makes you think that the Templars have any control over their
own actions ?  Obviously it is just a question of who is pulling
humaniti\'s strings that day - Yaskodray/Cthulhu or The Hivers/The Great
Old Ones.  We should also realize that given the rigor of the Terran
environment the bacteria should be able to wipe out the Villani (whom we
all know have weak immune systems - but the strong digestive sytem
protection their cannibalism requires) without needing the Templars
help.  As to your space fighter theory don\'t you realize that your
theory about "economic rationality" is only a product of a patriarchal
phallocentic western culture which does not pay sufficient attention to
the more enlightened belief sytems of non western peoples whom we all
know are _all_ deeply concerned with The Environment (capitalization
deliberate), which is more important than economics anyway.

So who is going to make the movie of this theory, will it be a musical,
and who should star in it ?    

This is my second attempt to send this message.  On my previous attempt
the message did not go through.  It seems obvious that the Vilani agents
within our society must have sabatogued my posting. :)

Not to mention such classics as "I\'m going to cut your heart with a

On the IG website, it says that the following text needs to be on all pages
(I do not now if they mean on every site, or on every subpage):
- ----
Traveller is a registered trademark of Far Future Enterprises.
Portions of this material are Copyright =A91977-1996 Far Future Enterprises.
- ----
It seems strange to me that it is required to have a text about a copyright
that has expired, but perhaps it hasn\'t been updated.

I am very interested in such a word generator, as I run other games than
Traveller (and it would be useful for Traveller also).

I think they are working just fine, although I cannot comment on the words
produced (since I am very new to Traveller). The random length words often
turn out to be quite long (especially for Vargr).

What about a function to save the generated words as a text file?

	Well, I\'ve got the vast majority of it floating around somewhere,
but it\'s not organized or available on the web.  If anyone wants to
volunteer, I\'d be more than willing to flood their mailbox with old
Spofustuff...

	In passing, has BITS thought of doing a 101 Guns supplement?  While
it might sell better in the Stateside than in the UK, it might add a nice
bit of flavour for the really triggerhappy Trav players out there.

	And the idea of a Sayat/Spofulam strategic alliance is a deeply
frightening one :).  I have this wierd vision of Hengabar and the rest of
the family and a bunch of Sayat doing things that would blow PETA\'s
collective mind and then smearing gore all over each other.  God only knows
what a little fresh blood in the Design Bureau would lead to...

	Why not? As long as you\'re willing to waste the time and keep
looking for something that may not even be there ... In fact, I\'d
think that with repeated searches you could increase your odds of
detecting something (if it\'s there) with all the data piling up

	Especially given this rule, I\'d think you should allow multiple
attempts. If my players want to spend the next 6 months\' game
time trying to detect gas giants, I\'ll just have to come up with
something more interesting ... where\'s my FS catalog...?

Well, I am not exactly familiar with the laws concerning such things, but
the text says "Copyright =A91977-1996". If this does not mean that the
copyright has expired, what exactly does it mean?

I still haven\'t seen issue 27 due out last May. I figure that IG 
isn\'t interested in putting out JTAS.  They have our money (got

They haven\'t even had the curosity of tell us what is up...how is

That\'s why my old post describing how the ISS does stellar mapping used
a one parsec baseline, with atomic clocks recording time hacks, while
the two observatories are linked by a laser baseline. 

The laser link has time info embedded in it as well as echoes of the
time info from the other observatory. This will (after a 6.52 year lag)
allow determining the length of the baseline to at least fractions of a
millimeter (more likely to the accuracy of the clocks). 

This will allow *very* accurate determination of stellar distances for
a few hundred parsecs or more. And as you point out, it\'ll be needed.

Naturally there are dupes, as I wanted to list all sources for info.
And it helps to know *where* a particular misspelling comes from.

What I recall is that the interesting effects are in the sub 20 Hz
range. Depending on the frequency, you got epilietic type fits, nausea,
fear or even death (or so I\'m told). 

The problem is the *wavelength*. At 20 Hz, the wavelength is something
on the order of 50 feet. Which makes designing an emitter fun. And
means that it tends to diffract around barriers.

Right now, I\'m planning on doing a load of weapons for ACQ.  These will
include MT style Recoil and Signature stats, which ACQ uses.

Re : BD - Wimp Booooorrrring

Uncie,

This is Cousin Ditzie here. It\'s boooooring here at Compliance. A couple of
us saw the tapes about Winnie and the fun she was having, so we put our
heads together.

I reckon we could take a teensy weensie baby particle accelerator and build
it to stay within the hunnerd kilos or so you can carry in a BDE body
BeeeeDeeeEeeee body suit. And weeeeee reckon the beam would stay together
to six hunnerd kilometers or so.

See, with a 0.64 meter tube, eight centimeters wide, you should be able to
have a quarter of a megajoule or so on come out ... with should rilly rilly
muss the makeup of any stray tin canny-type person. It\'s elementary
particles too, so it\'s hyuk hyuk hyuk time if they dont have shielded leccy
stuff.

We built a draft model to try on Leeeeeegals car, and and and Cousin Davey
hadnt taken his meds and he says he can still see the purple spiders, but
weeeee think he\'s lying.

Those boooooooring people down at Leeeegals say we need to put a carriage
and a beam pointer on any particle accelerator. Weeee reckon if it\'s being
carried it dont need a carriage, and hand-held lasers dont need a beam
pointer, so why should a hand-held particle-warticle accelerator ?

And and and if it turns out you cant carry a big enough power pack to make
it work - and, Uncie, an accumulator for a quarter of a meee-jay peeeeey-ay
is just twenty-five kilograms, then you could have a friiiieeeend in a
body-suit carrying the power plant and run a cord between you ... and 90
kilos of fuuuusie plus puts out about point three of a megawatt.

So Uncie, can we build one ? Can we can we can we can we ???

Your loving cousein,

Ditzie

Dave,
It depends on the type of stone, sandstone, limestone, or granite.<G>
A 250kg will make a larger crater than 2 meters across in *stone*. The 5
inch Naval Canon Mk 45 projo weighing in at 75 pounds(34kg) will make a
crater over 4 meters across in *stone*. I have seen it do it. The 16 inch
Naval Rifle\'s 2200 pound(997.9 kg) explosive shell will make a crater over
20 meters across and over 7 meters in depth.(Mix of sand, earth and stone)
The USS New Jersey made a *new* lagoon on Goat Island when it fired on the
onshore range there the last time they brought her out of *balls*. It was
only a three round *spotting* shots that did it too. After that she could
only fire out to sea.

As for a 250 kg iron bomb, well common sense will have to prevail, just
like in TNE if you put a double barreled shot gun in a target\'s mouth, you
still had a 20 percent chance of missing with each shot or 4 percent chance
of missing with both barrels. It is just one of *quirks* of CSC but a very
minor one. 

Just remember that according to FFS2, NASA has better starship computers
than the NSA/CIA does, and they are all on the scale of the ENIAC at all
TL\'s. But we both know that is not the case.

Anything copyright in 1977 won\'t expire until *at least* 2052.

can live with, but (IMHO) there are far, far too many D class and above
concidering that M0 is set right after a period where star travel had all
but died out.

I\'ve basically been declassifying any planet with a TL 0 - 4 as an X,  TL
4 - 6 as an E (Airports are noted but do not have facilities for star/space
craft), and TL 6 - 9 as D class ports (Spaceports but not equipt for
Starships). Exceptions are "contacted" planets (as adjusted by the the
percentages in M0 Campaign, X\'s become E\'s etc.). Of course there are the
occational (very rare) planet with an "Artifact" starport, but (again, IMHO)
these are usually unaccessable to the Natives for whatever handwaved reason
makes a good adventure.

If there were as many class A and B starports around as the current data
indecates I have a hard time buying the loss of starflight that is a major
factor of the Long Night! Pocket Empires not withstanding the ratio of worls
capable of producing star ships just seems extremely high.
