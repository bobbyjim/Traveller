  Well, we know that only a statistically insignificant proportion will
be marrying outside their native planetary population :)

  As for the rest, it\'s probably primarily cultural; regardless of what\'s
now common in the industrialized nations there have been substantial changes
in even the last century, at least among the middle classes and the elites.

  Well, normal CT tunnelling would cost ~BCr 30 (3x10^10) for about the same
space created - around 40,000,000 Dt, or enough for nine million staterooms.
OC, it\'s the Cr 100/Dt to move the site to a shipyard that really hurts  :|

  Interestingly, (the rules tend to agree that small nukes at least run KCr 10
per kiloton yield) larger nukes aren\'t specified as being cheaper, which ISTR
being the RW case. Mind you, the rules to cover 100-megaton warheads would be
kind of weird and needless.

  OTOH, FF&S1 p. 14 #8 nuke-pumped x-rays seems to violate the yield pricing
given on p. 143; this doesn\'t seem to be covered in the errata, so what gives?

my two cents in and see what you think.

	One thing I think you may not have been considering is that humans
get used to (and can grow to prefer) whatever environment they\'re put
into, no matter how negative it may appear to those who live elsewhere.
Once people have lived on a rockball for a while, they _will_ find it
preferable to a garden world, as strange as this may seem to all us
garden-world dwellers.  They will come to expect and be used to the
sterile, controlled conditions and the stark landscape.  Most likely they
will resist moving to anything different, as economical or "beautiful" as
it might seem to most people.  This helps explain why rockballs, orginally
colonized as small mining bases, can grow to have huge populations,
despite the economic difficulties inherent in it. 

	In fact, I imagine that people raised on rockball worlds would
find the moist, teeming chaos of a garden world quite repulsive.  Having
bugs flying around you and small animals crawling nearby when you\'ve never
experienced such things would be rather disconcerting, I think.

All I can find for CT is just a G-Carrier.  While they\'re ok once you\'re on the ground, even Broadsword had gcarriers in modules on their cutters.  This tells me that the hot setup is to use a cutter or pinnace to get close to the planet, *then* release the gcarriers to make the final assault.

You may not be able to get into orbit  using a G-Carrier, but
you should be able to drop them OK, they just fall until they
tun on their  agrav and stop. Can\'t get down much faster
than terminal velocity in a shuttle.

Of course, you wouldn\'t wat to be in the first wave of an

This is true. The wide number of areas that humans have colonized in our own

There was an EC comic from the early 50s that had a story that is kind of
relevant. There was a generation ship that took off from earth. Along the
way, the population expanded (as was expected) and most of the original
colonists/crew eventually died off long before they reached the world they
were trying to get to. Only one of the really old folks was left. He stepped
out into a beautiful eden-like landscape. The rest of the colonists came
out.

They were used to the sun lamps on the ship, this sun was too hot and too
bright. They had never known a windstorm. They were never surrounded by such
a multitude of annoying, stinging and biting pests. The old colonist stayed.
The rest got back in the ship and headed away for parts unknown.

Confucious say...

If you cannot bring mountain to shipyard, bring shipyard to mountain.

If it would cost to much to move the planetoid, then what would be the cost
of moving the equipment and support on site.

Most of the construction equipment is usually available on most military
tenders, and anything special (plasma tunneling equipment) could be moved
via freighters or other transports. A temporary settlement for the workers
could be constructed on the surface with some allowances for comissaries,
etc, brought in by comercial contract.

Besides, with the increasing litigation we\'re seeing (although not yet at

military/police on alert would give people an excuse to sue the government
- - which wastes taxpayers money if nothing else.

(Eg. A police officer was killed by a criminal who should have been
deported, but who slipped through the cracks. His family are sueing the
federal government for 100+ million on the grounds that had he been
deported on schedule the officer wouldn\'t have been shot.)

Version 2 is nearing completion and I hope to release it this weekend. I
have attached an HTML file listing the current Known Issues related to the
program. If you are aware of any other bugs other than those listed please
let me know by Friday at the latest, so that I can address them in time for
the new release.

I would like to thank everyone mailed me in response to my initial post. The
feedback I have been getting is very positive and I hope that Version 2 of
the program addresses the main problems that were encountered in Version1.

I will be releasing Version 3 of my Sector Generator program at the same
time. The most significant update in this program is the ability to save
Subsector files in a format that can be read by World Builder Deluxe. You
will be able to select a World from a Subsector list and then display the
World Details. I had hoped to include the ability to load Galactic 2.4
files, but they do not include Stellar data.

I will post a message to the list when the programs have been uploaded to my
site.

Actually, it\'s not at all a silly minimum question - it points out that
it really does have to be near c to be useful in space combat. BL/BR give
PAW weapons the same range modifiers (which are an attempt to model the
ability of the target to move out of the way due to lightspeed lag) as lasers,
which implies that they\'re going within 10-20% of c.

Subject: Re: Colonizing hellholes
     Hi.  I\'ve only been skimming this thread, but I thought I\'d stick
my two cents in and see what you think.
     One thing I think you may not have been considering is that humans
get used to (and can grow to prefer) whatever environment they\'re put
into, no matter how negative it may appear to those who live elsewhere.
Once people have lived on a rockball for a while, they _will_ find it
preferable to a garden world, as strange as this may seem to all us
garden-world dwellers.  They will come to expect and be used to the
sterile, controlled conditions and the stark landscape.  Most likely they
will resist moving to anything different, as economical or "beautiful" as
it might seem to most people.  This helps explain why rockballs, orginally
colonized as small mining bases, can grow to have huge populations,
despite the economic difficulties inherent in it.
     In fact, I imagine that people raised on rockball worlds would
find the moist, teeming chaos of a garden world quite repulsive.  Having
bugs flying around you and small animals crawling nearby when you\'ve never
experienced such things would be rather disconcerting, I think.

  Very interesting idea, could be done, I imagine. What\'s even more
interesting is what happens when one of these ships is infected by a
stable form virus (empire builder, naturalist, mother etc.)

  I agree, and I think Traveller space combat should take this into
account. (I only have Brilliant Lances personally. It only adresses damage  
to ship systems, and even this seems too wimpy.)
  Some GURPS product had rules for ship personell irradiation. (I recall
they were rather brutal.) Thought it might have been GURPS space, but
leafing trough it now it seem I was wrong. May have been Compendium II.
  Another question: wouldn\'t radiation levels high enough to quickly
incapactate the crew do something quite nasty to electrical systems?

  At least with TNE you\'d lose. Went through it with a fine tooth comb
last night, and the basic book doesn\'t even have an equipment entry for
low berths, let alone give any rules for it. FF&S1 gives vol/mass/price
stats, but seems to lack any concrete operation rules also.
  
  I\'m not quite as familiar with MT, but a friend who has been through it
about a million times in the past years assures me this lethality rate is
not mentioned in it either.

PAWs in BL do do extra damage to personnel, though. They cause double
casaulties on a personnel hit, and they reset all non fibre-optic computer
systems.

  Now we\'re getting somewhere. Maybe, instead of bashing each other\'s
heads in, we should concentrate on finding some creative solutions to
explaining some of the more bizarre UWP:s.

  For "ignored" garden worlds we have at least:

 -Imperial preserve world
 -Too hostile conditions despite being theoretically garden. (Just using
  World Builder, and tweaking the orbit a bit can create some interesting
  results.) 
 -Small poulation of xenophobic natives. (Only works if you consider the
  Imperium as a nice guy.)
 -Maybe harvesting of extremely valuable living resources, that might be
  destroyed by too many humans.

  And for huge vacuum colonies:

 -The ones that got lucky, and grew big-time.
 -Ones having so incredibly rich mineral resources, that it actually takes
  this large a population to exploit it. (Works better for pop 7-8 worlds,
  methinks.) 

  At least for the vacuum worlds, I personally think we need some more
explanations to complement these. (It seemed I wasn\'t totally alone in
this, but I could be wrong.)
  So, got any more folks? Any comments on these?

TNE Mk1 mod1, page 219 staes that reviving a low berth occupant is a
Difficult test of Medical (Diagnosis), or Formidible if the passenger has a
Con of 2 or less. A failure results in various nastinesses, from minor
cosmetic problems to internal damage that will not go away without surgery.
A Castrophic Failure kills the passenger. Assuming the Medic has a skill of
4, and an EDU of 6 (this would be fairly typical of someone with a term in
Tech School and a term as a medic) for an Asset of 10. On a scummy Free
Trader a likely Asset would be around 8. An Asset of 10 gives a Castrophic
Failure chance of 2.5%, an Asset of 8 raises this to 9%.

  And just think of all the wonderful disads you could take for a
character like this playing GT: agoraphobia, entomophobia, thalassophobia,
autophobia, possibly pyrophobia, chummy/gregarious, the list goes on and
on. I think this might be a whole lot of fun...

Not exactly declared unpatriotic per se. The violence in the horror comics
was theoretically what killed them. Underlying it all was Shock
SuspenStories which contained a number of attacks against the statues quo,
and the war comics which showed war as something that wasn\'t terribly
glorious and quite a bit unpleasant.

That, and the infamous India incident which everyone forgets. It seems the
government of India was insulted by a (non-EC) comic book that stereotyped
Indians as literally bloodthirsty savages. As it turns out, the American
ambassador to India found himself in a very precarious position when he was
confronted with an issue of the comic.

That and Dr. Fredric Wertham\'s "Seduction of the Innocent" went a long way
to convincing the government that comics were out of hand. Then, the
distributors and the comic companies banded together to self-censor their
wares before the government could do it. This was good for the then much
smaller companies DC comics and Atlas (if I remember right). Atlas would go
on to become Marvel. EC would try a "New Direction", but despite some
quality stories in Impact, the restrictions of the comics code were too
much.

Such a damn shame.

 The double casualties are only for penetrating hits AFAIK, though, and
just resetting a few computers seems a bit wimpy as I said. I think more
drastic effects would be in order. Just a gut feeling as usual.

    'body' => 'Fellow TMLers:

I wonder if I can jump into the discussion concerning Logistics,
Housekeeping and Maintenance.  I\'ve noticed that no one seems to have come
up with a definitive level as to consumables for human life support.  So I
went to my local survivalist friend who is getting ready for the Y2K bug.
(lets not go there)  Any ways, I asked him what he based his needs on, and
he said that a certain religious group publishes annual recommendations to
its congregation.  The list of approximately twenty to thirty items weighs
out at approximately 0.25 metric tonnes per person.  Volume occupied is
approximately the equivalent of  3.5 cubic meters.  I rounded up for ease
of calculations.  This would be enough basic food, water and staples for a
year.

Annual breathable air requirements need a bit of calculation.  Assume
standard temperature, pressure  at 1 Atmosphere (atm) and 20% oxygen
atmosphere mix.  A person respires approximately 1.5 liters of air per
breath.  Average rate of respiration is 20 breaths per minute.  (This is
lower while sleeping and higher  while exercising.)  Now the stubby pencil
work begins......

30 liters respired per minute
900l per hour
2.16E4 l  per day
6.05E5 l per month (28 day)
7.86E6 l per annum  or  7.86E3 cu meters per annum

To give you an idea of what kind of real world working situations are
around, a thirty foot (9 meters for argument sake) tube trailer has
approximately 16.52cu m of breathing air pressurized at 32,330 atm.
Converting this to 1 atm would bring the volume to 5.34E5cu m.  I used the
perfect gas law.

This volume works out to be more than enough air for approximately 6.79
people in a year.  I  work with this supplied air system and have yet to
run out of air in a year.  Granted, we usually do this work in the winter
and work lasts between four and six hours a day with up to four employees
on the system at one time.

If we increase the respiration to 2 liters per breath, the increased use
would bring the available air to approximately 2.5 persons per year.  Lets
round down for sake of argument to 2 persons.

So for food and air alone, we would need to set aside 12 cubic meters of
space for one person to survive a year on any particular starship.
Conceivably, approximately 1.0 cubic meters per month per person.  For a
1000 dT Merc Cruiser with a compliment of 15 crew and 30 troops, with
another 5 persons thrown in for good measure, 650 cubic meters of space is
needed for suvuval throughout the coming year.  If we use the HG dT- volume
of 13.5 cu m per dT, then a one percent rate may be too high based upon the
above calculations.  Realize, I did not take into account equipment logistics.

Lets look at those pallets for equipment storage and what I recall are War
Reserve Kits (WRSK).  For an entire C-130 Squadron of 12 birds to go on
mobility it required at least one 10 cu m WRSK of parts to go with the
birds.  Another kit was set up for specialized gear (poopy suits, and other
life support repair gear).  One kit of admin stuff.  Two kits were the load
handling equipment which flew in four birds.  The other five birds handled
all the support personnel and additional pilots.  For reference sake, each
kit actually took up the floor space of the entire C-130.  This was also
the basic kit that the squadron could get by with.  If there was truly a
wartime activity, other equipment would be placed in the personnel birds,
and the personnel would be placed on different ferry birds, usually reserve
airlift.  So from my model, wartime logistical support could require up to
75% of available volume.  Shades of "Das Boot," with crammed aisles and
sausages swinging from the ceiling.

So what\'s right, maybe a sliding scale dependent upon the type of activity?
  Should the standards and limits be set for a year of logistical support
or should one month be set as the limit?  What do the aircraft carriers do
for  resupply?  How often do submarines resupply?  Is it as needed?  My
father-in-law stated that the Randolph resupplied at sea for fuel and
consumables every month during WW2.

  Some GURPS product had rules for ship personell irradiation. (I recall

  Another question: wouldn\'t radiation levels high enough to quickly

IIRC (don\'t have it with me), the damage tables from High Guard included

  So, got any more folks? Any comments on these?  
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Just a couple:

Tainted atmospheres. On a world with a population in the billions,
environmental mismanagement can create environmental taints.
The original CT world generation tables seemed to assume this - 
you almost needed a bad atmosphere to attain the "Industrial"
trade code. 

Environmental catastrophes could also occur. Say the addition of
a Terran (or Reginan, or Efatian, or whatever) fungus into the local
ecosystem had some synergistic effect, and suddenly mutant
sporulating mosses are clogging the air from pole to pole
with borderline toxic allergens. Or worse - the albedo or ozone layer
suffers a catastrophic change, and the world gradually goes from
garden to minimally habitable to hostile. The inhabitants have, by that
time, spent billions of Cr on factories, starports, orbital facilities - 
they\'re not only stuck here, they (think they) know what went wrong
and with some work they can fix it. If they can keep up with the
environmental changes, they may stay on the try and stop or reverse
them. A heavily populated planet in the midst of an unexpected 
economic cataclycsm...owch!

Uninhabitable planets: remember this isn\'t the only feature of the
solar system, just the one they put the starport on. The population
could be living in orbital colonies, in a generation ship with a busted
main drive, whatever. That planet with an insidious atmosphere and
a population of three billion - the only thing down on that planet
are the duranium mines. Everyone else is living on the tech level
fifteen orbital habitats they bought from Rhylanor. Since people live
in the volume of an orbital city (instead of on the surface, like a world)
you can put a lot of people in a great big bubble in the sky.

(By my calculations, if you tunnel rooms into an asteroid less than
25 km in diameter, you\'ll have enough room to give each of 3 billion
people more than 2000 cubic meters of space each. Some space will
have to go for bracing and life support, but that sure beats a stateroom
at what - 54 cubic meters?)

Right.  The LDS Church has done this practically since Day 1.  Not a bad idea,

generally informative focus, becoming the immediate predecessor
to Freelance Traveller.

Included with the Letter were other clips from the TML digests of
that period (1995!), from John Bogan, suggesting the creation of
the "Remnants\' List", which would provide information about
pre-Collapse Imperial culture to the people of post-Collapse
Coalition-influenced space.  These, like the RICE Papers, would
be written to a non-technical audience with little or no
background in the subject matter.

Were any "Remnant\'s Guides" ever written?  If so, I promise them
a home on Freelance Traveller - just send them along, to either
of the addresses in the signature.

Similar works for/from "other similar organizations" are also
welcome.  I\'d especially be interested and appreciative if
someone would mine/scavenge the archives of the TML, XTML, and
any other Traveller-related lists for stuff like this that was
posted to the lists, but never made it to anyone\'s Traveller web
site.

Finalized equipment/ship/vehicle/weapon profiles (including the
design system abuses from Famille Spofulam and the Sayat
Concourse), with accompanying descriptive text (Ditzie\'s letters
and monologues are OK, provided a translation accompanies them),
will also be eagerly accepted, and included either "In a Store
Near You" or in a newly-created, more appropriate section (such
as, perhaps, the "Shipyard", the "Equipment Section", the "Armory
and Arsenal", and so on).

That said, has anyone found RICE Paper #0, the one that describes
how to read the RICE Papers?

MT Imperial Encyclopedia, p 87 (Travelling: Space Travel)

   *Low Passage:*  Transportation while in cryogenic sleep (suspended
animation) is possible at relatively low cost to the passenger.  The
passenger is placed in a low passage berth before the ship takes off and
travels the entire journey in a state of suspended animation.  He does not
age, and requires very little life support.  Unfortunately, the low passage
system involves some intrinsic dangers to the passenger, and he runs some
risk of not surviving the voyage.  Surviving uses the following UTP:

      To survive a low passage voyage: Routine, Medical, Edu, 1 min.
(fateful).

   *Referee:*  The Medical skill and Education characteristics used as
modifiers to this task roll are those of the attending physician at the
time of deberthing, not those of the character at risk.  Various effects
occur for any mishap (roll 2D): Superficial Mishap: The subject temporarily
suffers 1D wounds for 106 days, after which healing is automatic; skin
loses some of its tone and color for 1-6 weeks, having a gray, wrinkled
appearance.  Minor Mishap: The subject temporarily suffers 2D wounds for
1-6 days, after which healing is automatic; subject experiences motor
function problems for 1-6 weeks with corresponding loss of 2 points of
dexterity during that time.  Major Mishap: The subject suffers 3D permanent
wounds; the subject\'s internal organs are damaged, and the subject must
undergo medical diagnosis and treatment to restore full health.  Destroyed
Mishap: This is not possible on a 2D mishap.

   Commercial starship lines offering low berth passage typically guarantee
that deberthing will be conducted by a physician of at least skill level 3;
TAS advises all travellers to exercise caution when travelling low berth.

FIREING ON ALL CYLINDERS

By Jeremy Vine in Johannesburg 

Car drivers in South Africa are being offered a new
method of preventing hijacking. 

A blaster, flame-thrower operated by a foot pedal
inside the car, blasts a jet of fire at a would-be
hijacker. 

A person confronted by an armed hijacker simply
presses a pedal and the "blaster" ignites
gas that shoots from the under-side of the car. 

Doctors say the device is lethal - but the police
have confirmed it is perfectly legal.

A couple more:

located within a demilitarized zone.

I\'m afraid you comb must be missing a couple of teeth. Page 218-219 of the
main rulebook give details on interstellar travel and detail all the types
of passage. It states that reviving a low passenger is a Difficult (using
the Medical (Diagnosis) skill , a failure resulting in damage and a crit
failure resulting in death.

  Ouch, you\'re right. Works for only a limited number of worlds, though.
An Imperium of this mindset would have no qualms about letting the
megacorps exterminate any xenophobic populations it didn\'t need for study
or whatever (off camera, of course). OTOH this would probably mostly have
already happened in the early Imperium (expansion/consolidation) era.

  Couple of these mentioned in the library data already I believe. (Can\'t

  TNE world generation IIRC just flat out stated you need a tainted
atmosphere to qualify as an industrial world. Considering the usual amount
of environmental awareness possessed by the megacorps, most In worlds
probably would have tainted atmospheres, but I still think the rule is
just a bit too stict.
  Could some low pop garden worlds with tainted Atm:s then be former In
worlds abandoned ceturies ago, after their environments became just too
spoiled to live in. (An image of vast deserted TL 9-10 skyscrapers/arcos
with their slowly decaying tops lost in a yellowish toxic haze. I sense a
major story hook here.)

  Harry Harrison\'s Deathworld series comes to mind. Maybe a few
hundred/thousand stubborn colonists eking out an existence in an ecosystem
made ultrahostile by human meddling.

  A vacuum rockball world, probably in the outer system, with nothing but
an A class starport on it The population living in a string of fused
asteroids and cometary nuclei laced by geneered plantlife. (Yes, I\'m
ripping off Hyperion here.)

  The space allocation is, if anything, generous. I\'d say you can stuff
closer to 10 billion into a rock like that, if it\'s totally hollowed out,
and you\'re not too concerned about the occasional colonist losing his
marbles. 
  What this is, is damned expensive, but it might be done for example if
you need a lot of people there because of the system\'s strategically
important location.

  I agree. But even this would take some pecievable time, don\'t you
think?
It was the "waving things over with a nuke damper" part I was most
objecting to.
>>>>
My understanding of combat type nuclear dampers is that they (on a high
level of abstraction) reduce the nuclear warhead to a state where it
will not produce a nuclear explosion.  I assume (OK, IMTU) that combat
use does not reduce the radioactivity a huge amount, but enough to make
it non-explosive (in the nuclear sense).  So if you did post-combat
salvage of nuclear missiles, you would still need to be worried about
radiation.  My understanding of current (TL7-8) nuclear weapons is that
they are fairly close on the tolerance between the critical mass and
just a bunch of radioactive material.  The difference is only a few
percent in the total mass of the warhead (IIRC), so a combat damper
would only have to maybe do a 1-2% reduction in radioactivity to make
this effective.
Calculation time!
2% reduction in about 20 minutes gives 90% reduction in about
20min*45*2%= 30 hours.
So, you could setup a damper for a day and a half, say, and be
comfortable with short-term exposure without (much) worry.

As far as the holes themselves, I would assume you would use fairly
ordinary mining techniques to remove the top layer of crumbled (but not
yet fallen) material from the outside of the sphere.  You would probably
also use a concrete (or other material) to cover the surfaced rock in
most areas of the created cavern.

  Would have to be, as far as I can see, considering the distances and
corresponding time lags involved.
  Someone recently posted some stuff about hit chances in HG with some
very convincing looking figures on beam travel times and target spheres of
movement. (These were so long I simply didn\'t have time to read them all.)
Would this person maybe care to do some hard math on the same vein to
figure out rough minimum beam velocities?

Can I just ask that we show some restraint and a lack of jingoism about the
subject of Desert Fox in the Gulf? I appreciate that the activities there
are bound to bring out emotion in people, but there are inevitably going to
be people who feel strongly both ways as to whether the action is justified.

When news breaks and intrudes (as it is bound to do with both serving and
veteran military personnel, and our resident \'gearheads\' and \'gun bunnies\'
on the TML), we should all try and moderate our responses bearing in mind
that there are people on both sides of this operation who are in harms\'
way.

Additionally, remember the small flame fest that a (joking) comment about
using nuclear weapons on Baghdad caused a few months ago, and imagine it
scaled up.

This request isn\'t meant to patronise anyone, or even an attempt to
\'censor\' people\'s right to free speech (a right that some on the TML do not
actually have). It is a request for us to be mature, civilised and to
remember what the TML is here for, when we compose our posts.

Meanwhile, in RL, some US personnel reportedly attached Claymore mines
to the outside of their vehicles in Vietnam.  Did quite a number on
attacking infantry.  Of course, if the vehicle wasn\'t shielded from the
blast (e.g., by lots of sandbags), the Claymore would do quite a number
on the _vehicle_, as well....

C\'est la guerre....

Hm...wasn\'t me (figures I recall were slightly wrong because they assumed
constant single-direction acceleration for full turnover time, which is a bit
higher than actual distances would be), but the answer is easy to compute.  To
have the same ranges as lasers, you need the same velocity as lasers ;). 
Actual range for a constant delay is multiplied by 1/(1 + 1/(v/c)); thus for
90% of the range you need 82% of c (700 MeV/nucleon).  Most likely per-particle
energy is actually a direct function of the length of the PAW, though (which
means radiation effects are probably variable with PAW length.  There\'s an
argument for PAW penetration being a function of length rather than beam
energy, since energy per nucleon probably gives a better measure of radiation
penetration).

Claymores are a shaped charge.  On the front of it, it says \'Point Toward
Enemy\'.  Just follow the directions, and they won\'t hurt you.

Either you are joking or shockingly ignorant.  The claymore has a 10 m
danger zone which you don\'t want to be inside, quite apart from the lethal
fragmentation zone (which is, IIRC, 700 mils centred on the axis of the
mine out to 25m, with the fragmentation cone being between 1m and 2m off
the ground at 25 m, given that the mine is sighted correctly).  You don\'t
want to be behind the mine either, when the backing plate of the shaped
charge flies backwards at a rapid rate of knots.  On another issue, to
employ the weapon correctly, there must be some seperation between the
rear of the mine and a large solid object, as the reflection of the shock
wave interferes with the formation of the fragmentation cone.  1m was what
I was taught, but I can\'t say that I\'ve seen it written down.  This is not
to say that the mine won\'t go off, but just not as well as it should.

On a related matter, I had heard stories from Vietnam of patrols finding
bodies of VC with their heads blown off, with the remnants of the head
lying some distance behind the body.  The story goes that the VC would
come up to a defensive position, grab the mines (by snipping the firing
cord), and dury-rig piezo electric triggers on the mine.  Pity that they
didn\'t consider the Newtonian reaction forces.  Never could work out
whether this was true, or whether somebody was having a lend of me.

I run a TNE game, ya ya ya boo hiss the heritic, and I\'m a great beleive
of personal defence weapons on starships.  Weapons which are essentially
useless in starship combat but make great, "GET THE HELL AWAY FROM MY
SHIP!" weapons.

I took my inspiration from the Milenium Falcon\'s popdown blaster. 
Laser\'s zap to much power and offer no penetration so my prefered weapon
of choice is a co-axial 30mm High velocity GL with a 200 round belt,
firing at 5 grenades per round, and a 10mm Gauss Rifle firing at a ROF
of 50 with at 20,000 round cassette.  The Gauss can shread anything in
light battledress at a range of over 250 meters and the 30mm GL can take
out most light and moderately armored vehicles.  The mounts are slaved
to the laser turrets or the MFD and possess advanced stabilization
allowing them to be fired at any speed with no to hit modifications.

The whole thing costs nearly .5 of a MCr but I figure it\'s cheaper than
replacing a ship when some dip sh*t TED decides he wants your boat.

When you strap it onto your 2 1/2 ton truck, the fact that the majority
of the blast goes out doesn\'t help your thin-skinned vehicle (unless you
have provided soem ballast to absorb that part of the blast that is
directed against your vehicle).

My drill sergeant always said that, if you are within 50 meters of your
Claymore, you had better be in a hole, or behind some other cover.

That would be every force has an equal and opposite force.  In this case, the
claymore fires a cone in one direction and the backing plate in the other.

Heyyyy... I was in a T2000 game where my group did the same thing on one
occasion, when we were faced with a platoon of soviet infantry. Our
explosives "expert" strapped a claymore to the front grill of a
deuce-and-a-half. It killed the driver and the passenger when it went off,
and wrecked the truck.

The "expert" (in real life a veteran of the war in Vietnam) himself was in
the bed of the truck with a daisy chain of fragmentation grenades. This was
several grenades strung together with wire through the pins.

He planned on the truck driving through the hole created by the claymore,
after which he could fling the grenades out the back amongst the troops.

Unfortunately for him, the concussion of the claymore caused him to fall
with the grenades, pulling the pins in the process. Boom, boom, boom ...
boom boom BOOM!

My character was lucky enough to have been dropped off in high grass about
300 meters away in order to provide covering fire with a SAW. Needless to
say, there wasn\'t much left to cover. ;-)

Gosh I miss that game.

Mmm, I don\'t think it was the Astrin. *That* APC only had an Armor Value of
40 and no weapons in MegaTraveller, while the Marine Grav APC in Striker had
an Armor Value of 56-73, a rapid-pulse fusion gun, and a tac missile
launcher. I think a closer analog would be the Empress Grav APC in 101
Vehicles. It has an AV of 60 and a rapid-pulse fusion gun (but no tac
missile launcher).

This brings to mind an old gripe: the Trepida, a grav *tank,* had an AV of
40 in MegaTraveller -- the same as the Astrin. What\'s up with that? Sure,
thery were both part of the RDA weapons delivery system, but what\'s the
point of a tank with the armor of an APC? Especially when said armor is only
the equivalent of 33 cm of hard steel (that\'s DR 924 to you GURPsies out
there, or about AV 16 to you TNEers)?

There was an article in the October 1995 Scientific American, page 24, that
questions the "50% chance" that amino acids have left-handed chirality.
Left-handed amino acids were discovered in a meteorite and in dust clouds
in Orion. Left and right-handed amino acids respond differently to
ultraviolet light, and an astronomer hypothesized that typical stellar
radiation is more damaging to right-handed amino acids. This would lead to
life based on amino acids favoring the left-handed variety, if he is
correct.

Hey, waitaminute. 33 cm of hard steel is AV 66 in TNE.

Oh well, if at first you don\'t succeed.

Still, an AV of 66 for a high-tech tank ... well ... sucks.

That\'s why it\'s there, as reference material for my players.  And it still 
needs a bunch of work done on it.

I\'ve been doing system detailing here as I can.  It\'s taking awhile to get it 
done, though, since there\'s a *LOT* that needs doing...  Personally, I\'ll be 
happy to get the Drexilthar Subsector data done in any reasonable amount of 
time...

Rule 40 E in Striker states specifically that in one fire phase (under 30
seconds) a nuclear damper will eliminate all radiation in its effect radius
and render the area "permanently harmless".

IIRC, Challenge also had an adventure where someone was using nuclear
dampers to decontaminate a nuked site.

My PC\'s rebuilt the old standard CT/MT Resolve-class G-Carrier (the one
with the pointy front end) using superdense at TL 15, adding stealth
(emission level Nil), MT AF 40 all round, and a hardpoint for the RF-Y gun

IIRC, when asked about this Marc Miller said that there should be a risk
of dying associated with low berths. The problem with that is that there
is a canonical, safe alternative to low berths that is almost as cheap as
low berth and utterly safe: Shoot the passenger full of fast drug (Cr200)
and ship him in a bunk. On arrival give him fast antidote (Cr900) and he
can walk off the field fresh as a daisy, with no associated risks that is
not also present with low berths (ie. being helpless while strangers are
around). Arrange for special wakeup dormitories in starports and you can
even save the cost of the antidote by allowing the passenger time to sleep
off the fast drug naturally. That would be much cheaper than low berth
(especially since a realistic cost for low berth travel is Cr1500 and not
Cr1000). Depending on your assumptions (how much space does a passenger in
fast trance require?) dast berths could be a lot cheaper.

There are enough problems with fast berths that low berths could be a
realistic alternative to them, everything else being equal. But give me
ANY risk of dying in low berth and I would go fast berth any day of the
week.

   The vehicle has a crew of 2 (driver, commander) and carries 10 passengers.
It mounts a HMG on a pintle at the commanders hatch. No fire control installed.
Height: 1.65 m. Width: 3.0 m. Length: 5.7 m. Total Volume: 22.6 m^3. Weight:
10.45 tons. Flotation: yes. Ground pressure = 5.8. Price: Cr36,235.

   Movement: Road, 162 kph/135 cm; cross-country, 97 kph/81 cm; water 8 kph/
7 cm.
   Movement Effects on Fire: Move half or less, -4 FFP, no fire EFP; Move
more than half, no fire.
   Armour: Front, 27; sides, 10; back, 12; deck, 4; belly, 3.
   Target Size DM\'s: +2 low.
   Equipment: Sealed environment.
   Power: 0.7 megawatt fuel cell consumes 25 liters of fuel per hour; fuel
capacity
is 115 liters, enough for 4.6 hours. P/W ratio is 67; vehicle is Light.
   Weapons: see HMG on table, page 36. Basic load is 3000 rounds.


  Design notes: Power is per Book 8, scaled up with no efficiency improvement.
The fuel load includes the oxygen as well; divide replenishment by nine if the
consumption is of the hydrogen component only.

  The vehicle is under-optimized as Striker encourages extremely low APC\'s;
passengers require volume in m^3 equal to the hulls height (up to 2.0), so
a lower hull would be more efficient. A comfort factor (a la 2300 AD?) might
be desirable for those who feel that an M-113 actually is more spacious than
a BMP. Accessorization is up to the importer - the basic chassis provides a
fairly cheap hull with good battle taxi capabilities and a low logistics load.

  Also useful as a basic hull for explorers or prospectors without access to
an air/raft, or who want to maneuver under forest canopies, etc. By dropping
the "ten passengers" allotment basic life support could be added for three
people, who would then have a bit over a displacement ton of internal space
to share, and a quarter ton of internal cargo before dumping the HMG ammo.

  FWIW, the things can probably be crated at ~2 Dt each (10.5 st, of course):
the total volume includes the reduction for the radical frontal slope.

There are a *lot* of vacuum worlds and asteroid belts, many of which
have populations. Most of the skills we are talking about *will* be
common there.

The kind of folks who do major construction work in remote places tend
to be single.

Actually, some of them *did* stay behind, marry and raise families. And
once the facilities were built, the folks who moved in to maintain them
were more the family type.

It cools and winds up in the melt pool or deposited on the walls.

BTW, "engineering" or "demolition" type nukes will be *much* cheaper
than weapon warheads. For one thing, since there\'s no need to make them
as small and light as possible, you avoid a lot of the "fancy"
engineering that costs so much. They don\'t need to be ruggedized
either. At least not the way milspec gear does.

And I think the Imperium would be much happier if such nukes were
something that was too bulky or otherwise unsuitable for covert usage.

Probably at least a kilometer away. I\'m not sure *I* would want to be
in the next cavern either. But since the Imperium will have *centuries*
of experience with this, I expect that they won\'t be any more bothered
than we are by someone demolishing a building a few blocks away. 

And I bet they move people out of the adjacent cavern for the blast
just in case. 

Obviously, you *don\'t* do the "overlapping" trick with caverns that are
in use. But if you are doing a series of overlapping caverns (to get a
"linear" cavern) by the time you get several caverns away, you ought to
be able to work in the farther caverns from the blast.

And as I pointed out, once you have recycling, expanding it isn\'t that
hard. And look at places like LA. Without importing water from hundreds
of miles away, the place would be a ghost town.

The California mining camps *did* ship laundary to Honolulu, Hawaii. By
*sailing ship* no less! But laundries sprang up in Calafornia quickly
enough. Ditto for other "support facilities".

Heck, wind up lacking the right trace elements, and it may be simpler
to go elsewhere. Folks settling "garden" worlds tend to want a
self-sustaining "natural" colony. Being dependent on mineral
supplements *forever* tends to discourage folks.

Frankly, vacuum is easier to deal with than bad weather.

Someone did a cost projection showing that it\'d be cheaper to build a
self-supporting penal colony than to pay for prisons *and* guards at
home. After all, they *aren\'t* going to escape. :-)

Or perhaps a POW camp during a war. Afterwards, converted to a regular
penal colony. 

A lot of these will stabilize or even die out. After all, the folks
back home aren\'t going to be all *that* worried about the conditions.

Some will grow slowly, and at some point they will become independent.
Probably as a matter of it\'s simpler/cheaper to let them go and find
someplace else to ship convicts.

Well, I\'ve heard that the Cong would sometimes turn the claymores
around to face back at our lines. That\'s why the *intelligent* troops
always ducked before pulling the cord. 

I\'ve also heard of troops "accidentally" dropping some grenades while
on patrol. Said grenades being rigged up special with *no* delay train.
Pull the pin, and *boom*.

I\'ve also heard of cartridges with C-4 instead of powder getting
slipped into the supply chain.

Even without the disads, they make great space crew. You won\'t catch a
vacuum worlder getting careless with life support or airlock protocols.

Actually, electrical equipment is pretty much immune to radiation
effects. *Semiconductor based* electronics don\'t handle high radiation
levels well. Tube based don\'t have a real problem with it.

There\'s a short story in Heinlein\'s Future History "It\'s Great to Be
Back". It deals with a couple who have moved back to Earth from Luna.
And they start contrasting the things that bothered them there with the
problems they run into on earth. They wind up going back.

BTW, the story was originally published in the Saturday Evening Post!

Also consider Beowulf Shaefer\'s comments to his friend Elephant in one
of Niven\'s stories. Colonists consider folks from Earth to be
"insufficiently cautious". 

Folks on vacuum worlds will check pressure at hatches the way city
folks look both ways before crossing the street!

Borrowed from Pould Anderson and other SF authors. Appeared originally in
Traveller 2300 but was included as an alternative tech in FF&S I.
Basically you quantum jump your ship a tiny distance and then do it
repeatedly at high frequency to move the ship without giving it any
momentum etc. It is good for gaming because the ship move like playing
pieces without vectors, there is a set top speed etc. High gravity reduces
the jumplength drastically to sublight and there\'s another treshold when
the performance gets less than ordinary rockets (whatever that means).

After travelling for 7.7 lightyears or so you have to discharge by spending
time inside a gravitywell to forbid the ships from just moving in whatever
directio they like. This 7.7 ly limit was supposed to be a law of nature.

David Nilsen (I think) wrote an excellent article in Challenge about the
"relativistic" effects of viewing a stutterwarping ship at above lightspeed
pseudovelocity.

It\'s possible that the Trepida was more of a "Tank Destroyer" than a

Maybe it was built during a time when tactical doctrine was that a hit

was speed, maneuver and tactics rather than taking the hits. American
naval vessels could be built with a lot more armor than they are, but
they\'re built with the idea that a solid hit will kill a ship regardless,

use nukes to "plow" a ditch from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico.

A sea-level canal across Central America - dug with overlapping nuclear
explosions. The damage and disruption would have been similar to
that caused by a conventional construction project of that scale,
but the project would have been completed in a miniscule fraction of the
time. The Operation Plowshare people may have been overly optimistic
when calculating the effects of mass evacuations and radioactive
contaminiation cleanup efforts.

 This brings to mind an old gripe: the Trepida, a grav *tank,* had an AV of

 thery were both part of the RDA weapons delivery system, but what\'s the

Subject:  GT: combat example *LONG*




 it was shown that the Max sensor ranges were equal to
(according to GURPS VEHICLES second edition):
PESA scan rating + 9(worst penalty allowed before scan is impossible) +
size modifer of largest ship - Stealth features.
**************
rolls are still allowed for each ship scanning to find every ship in the
example, the CVE gets to roll to detect the CA and each of the DDs.  the
other side gets to roll 4 times to detect the CVE.



  Scenario shows where the CVE detected the CA at a range outside of the
detection envelope versus the CVE, but inside the detection envelope of the
CVE versus the CA.
CVE moves closer to the CA.  Initially, in the example I gave of long
ranged sensors and how they work, the CVE detected the CA at the the long
long range equal to a value of 57.  This is 4,500,000 miles, or 450 hexes.
 Maintaining that contact, the CVE speeds up to max accelleration.
Assuming that the vector is speed 12 to start with...
***************
but vector is 0 compared with the CA, correct?



Turn 1: CVE begins to plan the attack.  It takes approximately 2 more turns
to make the plans.  Plans include the following:
 A)  Only one attack run is to be made.
 B)  A rendevouz point has been picked for the fighters to meet up with the
CVE.
 C)  the fighters are go be launched and accelerate like mad for two turns,
and slow down as they get closer to the Enemy CA - they are to maintain
laser comm links for the tactical information feeds
 D) CVE is to build a high Delta-V by accelerating a full 6g\'s and launch
from a distance of 186 hexes.
Turn  Velocity     Distance
 #     now          From
                    Target
0)      12           450       CVE was shadowing the CA group.  Remember:
CVE is
1)      12     450        maintaining course and speed relative to CA
group.
2)      18            438

8)      54            240
9)      60            186


the numbers I get are slightly different, should work out the same for the
plan though.

                                            (other distance is

12)     54+12      72        18/90
13)     54+18      18        36/54    closest approach is 54 hexes.
14)     54+24      (36)      60/96    now infront of the CA

these numbers assume that the CVE wants to maintain max separation from the
CA and are accelerating 90 degrees from the basline course.


















  At a range of 186 hexes, the CVE launches 200 missiles.  This is what the
movement looks like for SIM-12\'s at a range of 186.  Oh, before I forget,
the CVE is now veering away from the CA in an attempt not to collide with
anything (such as Kamakazi fighters?) and maintain a 100 hex communications
link with the missiles as they are guided towards the targets.  Remember -
the CVE must be within 100 hexes of the missiles or they loose guidance
ability.

11)    60        120  6 used 30 left
12)    60          60  0 used 30 left
13)    60        0  range of zero is needed to hit.

for more damage with a chance for a clean miss:
10)    54        180 - zero acceleration used,
11)    54        126  12 used 24 left
12)    54          72  6 used 18 left
                           (if the missiles are detected
                           at this point the CA can generate a miss.)
13)    72        0  range of zero is needed to hit.





Since the range is now -24 at the end of turn 12, I suspect that the
velocity vector of the missile is not 90, but in fact, 80 plus.  For the
sake of argument, let us be nice and just say 81.
*****************
range of -24 indicates a clean miss, the missiles can only (assuming TL12)
make up 12 hexes of vector and do not impact. this is to simulate the
difficulty of hits at high speeds in 3D space.


  On turn #9, the range is 186 hexes, or 1,860,000 miles.  This is a
distance modifier of -55.  Scan 41 + 12 hull size -55 range - 8 (radical
emissions control) results in a net penalty of -10.  This is safely at a
range where the CVE is impossible to detect by a scan 41 sensor!  After
launching missiles, the CVE is now veering off from it\'s original course it
used to launch the missiles.  This course will veer away by 6 hexes worth
of accelleration.  The closest the CVE needs to approach the CA is some 36
hexes away.
**************
one thing you didn\'t mention was the location of the screening DDs if one
is deployed 10 hexes aft of the CA it might detect.  lets see:

9)      48            234
10)     54         180  launches here: total distance
                                            (other distance is
lateral/total separation)
                                           (distances 10 hexes less for DD)
11)     54+6       126       6/132      -9/-9/-10
12)     54+12      72        18/90      -8/-8/-9
13)     54+18      18        36/54    closest approach is 54 h  -7/-6/-8

detection is fairly probable, but wether the DDs can do anything about it
is a moot point. a stern chase into that many missiles? I don\'t think so.



  Personally?  I can\'t picture point defense getting EVERY single missile.
Now, lets be nice and say that this attack was a classic t-bone attack.
The missile will only do whatever velocity it has when it hits times
6d6x100(5).  Assuming average damage, the CA will take in a single hit -
170,100 points of damage!  Assuming a DR of 37,000 for the CA, it will
still let through 162,700 points of damage.  With only 765,000 hit points,
this Cruiser can only take 5 hits before it is crippled, and 30 hits before
it is destroyed.
***************
the best velocity to get a hit is 60, \'only\'  126,000 points of damage on
the average. 118,600 after armor. so 7 hits needed to cripple. better have
good PD gunners....

lets be generous and say the CA dodges 10% of the missiles.
190 left. say that each turret will always hit at 10+ and allways miss at
9-
further say that there are only 20 bays leaving 300  turrets for PD use....
ohoh, you are gonna need more missiles!!!
skill 14+14+12+0+4+10-39=15 3 missiles per turret.
If we adopt suprise rules that drops to only 1 missile per turret.

you can bet they are scared though!!!!!

it actualy works out nicly, SDB vs SDB = no damage to either unless they
close to energy range and start using lasers against each other instead of
missiles...have to think about it.

perhaps a rule like: \'if a weapon fires in the fire phase, it cannot be
used in the PD phase\'

more tests are definitely called for.

 At the very least, the bonus for Point
defense missile fire should be +8 instead of +10.
******************
I am thinking allong the lines of +6



  Hope this example of big ship versus big ship combat helps.  It has
certainly opened up my eyes with respect towards how easy it is to detect
LARGE craft from long distances away, and how easy it is to make a high
speed run against such a target with a highly stealthed ship with missile
bays!
*************
or even fighters :)  I love being able to have fighters as a viable weapons
platform.



  Oh, by the way, unless my math is off, that ship travelling 90 hexes per
turn, was actually travelling some 1.25 miles per second.
*************
just a tiny bit off, use the relative velocity instead.  didn\'t make a
diffence in the combat, missiles are still deadly, PD lasers still stop
them.  formation rules definitely needed for escorting ships.

  Smack... right you are. Another fine example of the unprdictable
workings of human synaptic structure: I distinctly remember looking over
that very page while searching for this stuff (because of the cool
picture), and I manged to completely miss it. Oh well, the info was fairly
small and inconspicuous anyway, only took about half the page with a huge
table in the middle...

  BTW an actual doctor, which reputable shippind lines promise would have
a minumum EDU of 9 (8+ to get into med school, +1 from the school), said
shipping lines also promise minimum medical skill of 3, so the person
reviwing you in a civilized area would have a medical asset of 12+. Not
that this alters your original point, since the fatality rate is still a
flat 2%.

  This brings up another question: Why would shipping lines in a civilized
area regularly have half their passenger capacity as low berths? Who in
their right mind would accept odd like this, unless the alternative was
slow lingering death by suffocation. (The latter is doom trade, and that\'s
another matter entirely.) Timer clubs also start looking a bit dubious. I
mean, if you intend to hang on for the next millenium while being thawed
out every decade or so, your odd of surviving seem quite bleak. Which one
to follow, game mechanics or game narrative? 

 Also, isn\'t the set price of low berth travel a bit on the low side? At
least in TNE a low berth takes up 1 d.ton of space and costs Cr 50000 to
install. Doctors don\'t work free either, whether you contract one from the
starport or hire your own. After these expenses you get Cr 1000 per low
passenger, the same you get from a discplacement ton of freight.

Vehicles provided that IMO sandbags are used. The armor on an APC (pre
bradley) is aluminum (sp) a 50 cal round can penetrate this, so what will a
pound (if that is what is in a claymore, I don\'t remember anymore) of C4 do
to this armor. And if sandbags are not used, imagine what the noise level
inside the armored vehicle will be when you set off a claymore touching the
armor. A claymore on the outside of an armored starship.... really cool

a rocket, set it up and \'kick\' the rocket to launch it. (The VC was fried
by the launch BTW)

The VC used alot of people to carry out their attacks, training these
people to set off dangerous and deadly equipment with out telling them of
the risk, from claymores to using people with C4 strapped to them, to
filling a can of fruit with C4 and leaving it on the ground for someone to
pick up, to kick starting rockets.

  It seems that in GT we finally have the first Traveller variant in which
low berth travel is actually something sane people might consider doing.
  
  The rules in GT state, that if there\'s a medic present with the relevant
skill at 10+, the reviwal is automatically successfull. (What the relevant
skill is, I don\'t know. The entry mentions medical, but there\'s no such
skill in GURPS. Could be eg. physician, diagnosis or el.op./medical.) If
no one superwises the process, the low-traveller must make a HT check,
where a critical failure results in the said traveller taking a dirtnap.

IMTU there\'s not Imperialnet.

  "4. Casualty Effects
   
       When detonated, the M18A1 mine will deliver spherical steel
       fragments over a 600 fan-shaped pattern that is 2 meters high
       and 50 meters wide at a range of 50 meters. These fragments are
       moderately effective up to a range of 100 meters and can travel
       up to 250 meters forward of the mine. The optimum effective
       range (the range at which the most desirable balance is achieved
       between lethality and area coverage) is 50 meters.
   
   5. Danger Area
   
   a. Danger From Fragments. The danger area consists of a 1800 fan with
      a radius of 250 meters centered in the direction of aim. 
   
   b. Danger Area of Backblast and Secondary Missiles. Within an area of
      16 meters to the rear and sides of the mine, backblast can cause
      injury by concussion (ruptured eardrums) and create a secondary
      missile hazard. 
   
      (1) Friendly troops are prohibited to the rear and sides of the
          mine within a radius of 16 meters. 
   
      (2) The minimum safe operating distance from the mine is 16 meters.
          At this distance, and regardless of how the mine is employed,
          the operator should be in a foxhole, behind cover, or lying
          prone in a depression. The operator and all friendly troops
          within 100 meters of the mine must take cover to prevent being
          injured by flying secondary objects such as sticks, stones,
          and pebbles."

Wouldn\'t a Claymore burn off of the exoskeleton of the starship when you

    'body' => 'The current \'Desert Fox\' news coverage has gottne me thinking a bit about
Imperial military doctrine (a subject I think has always been woefully
ignored in Traveller books).  Specifically, the concepts of artillery as
practiced by the Imperium.

In Classic Traveller and in various articles in the Journal, mention was
made of MRL batteries being used by the Marines, and the availability of
Orbital Fire.  ISTR the Spinward Campaign book\'s writeup of the Duke of
Regina\'s Huscarles included dedicated Ortillery (orbital artillery)
starships.  Some later publications for TNE added some detail, but still
neglected support weaponry.  Some mention was made of cruise missiles, but
it was not clear if this was the standard MRL load or a special type of
weapon used in addition to MRLs.

And of course, we have mention of battlefield Meson guns; the ultimate in
indirect fire weapon turns out to be the most direct fire weapon possible!

So - what do you think is being used?  I think that if the Marines are used
priarily against low-tech (TL 8 or less) forces, then dumb and semi-guided
MRL rockets, supported with active-homing cruise missiles, would be quite
sufficient.  But I would think higher-tech enemies would be able to deploy
countermeasures to take out most any cruise-type missile, and these same
countermeasures would probably be bale to defeat most \'mass-assault\' dumb
MRL attacks.

Dropping rocks from orbit is of course a much-loved TML subject, and would
perhaps be much more difficult to defend against, but to be useful in a
tactical support role it would require very solid control of the overhead
orbital space, and some DAMN GOOD targetting to avoid friendly fire
casualties.  I think the Marines on the ground would feel better if they
had supporting fire weapons under their direct control.

The battlefield Meson gun is a cool thing, but rather large and expensive.
Smaller Marine forces would need some sort of supporting fire too, and I
doubt the Imperium is issuing Meson gun carriers at the platoon or company
level.

IMTU, there is an ascending hierarchy of support weapons and options.  The
Marine squad will have grenades, some PGMP/FGMP weapons maybe, and perhaps
some man-portable TAC Missiles (sort of like miniature Cruise msisiles).  A
platoon would have the same sorts of weapon, with the heavy weapons (TAC
Missiles, PGMPS and FGMPs) definitely being present.  A company would have
the weapons of its subordinate units, and would have some grav sleds (small
one or two man air rafts) with heavier plasma/fusion weapons, larger TAC
missiles or small MRLS loaded with semi-active rockets.  IMTU, the Imperial
Navy fields assault transports for company-sized units (Marine Raider
Transports), so the company might be getting orbital fire support from this
ship (it carries a small Meson weapon and missile launchers).  Many times,
independent units of squad, platoon or company size are equipped with
battle dress to give them an edge and to make up for the lack of heavier
weapons.

At battalion level, the Marines start to truly come into their own. There
are battlefield meson weapons and armored vehicles available.  Only
battalion or larger sized units are equipped with APCs and AFVs; smaller
units are high tech leg infantry.  The larger units may still be equipped
with battle dress, too.  IMTU, the Navy fields assault transports for
battalions and regiments as well (Force Assault Transports and Regimental
Assault Transports), and also has more mundane non-assault troop carriers
that generally hold a regiment or brigade of troops (Marine or Army).  For
the most part, Marines IMTU are in assault transports, raider transports,
ship\'s troops on regular Navy vessels or garrison troops in Imperial
facilities.  While all military spacecraft can provide some form or orbital
fire support, assault transports and attack/assault cruisers are the ones
specifically designed with ground fire support in mind, and carry a lovely
array of weapons to make a Marine\'s life more pleasant.

If the Marines are facing a lower-tech force, the orbital support is
probably not needed (but might be used anyway juse to make a statement).
Those higher-tech enemies capable of defeating MRL rockets and TAC missiles
will tend to get pounded from orbit more more substantially before the
Marines attack.  This will of course signal that a ground attack is about
to commence, so sometimes the Marines will simply assault with minimal
preparation in hopes of surprising the enemy, relying on ECM to spoof the
enemy sensor nets.  In effect, IMTU ground battles between high-tech forces
sometimes resemble American Civil War/early World War I battles; the battle
is generally decided very quickly, or else it rapidly degenerates into a
meatgrinder that both sides have to keep feeding forces into to avoid a
breakthrough.  Except in this case the battle is going on over a 500 mile
area instead of a 10 mile battlefield, and the fighting extended into the
stratosphere and low orbit.  Not a pretty sight...

The Computer Game Independence War has a stutterwap type drive. It is used
as a fast STL drive to quickly move from planet to planet. Their handwave
explains that you can\'t tunnel faster than the speed of light. 

BTW I highly recommend Independence War. It uses realistic thrusters and
physics for it\'s simulation. One training mission involved docking with
cargo modules and then setting a vector to a cargo hopper and releasing
the module. If your vector was off then your module missed.

When one of my friends, named Dave, introduced the game "Traveller" to the
rest of us Army barracks rat gamers, he also introduced the playing of
background music to put players in the mood.  As it turned out, we found
ourselves exploring a drifting ghost ship.  The whole thing was very spooky.
The inside was dark and we eventually came upon a rather well-preserved but
grey figure sitting in one of the pilot\'s seats.  Trying to investigate the
cause of death, my character was scared witless when the supposedly dead man
opened his eyes and grabbed hold of my pressure suit.  The hair stood up on
the back of my neck and tears came to my eyes as my skin turned to
gooseflesh.  Knowing that no MAN could live in a vacuum without a sealed
space suit my character did his best to rip free and scramble in zero G back
to the warm comfort of the group\'s own lit ship.  What ensued was chaotic
and more fun than we had ever had playing Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.
While the game system\'s setting could have had something to do with it, I
suspect that the ambience of the gaming session was created largely by the
playing of Brian Eno\'s "Apollo Atmospheres & Soundtracks".  This CD has
tracks which make you picture yourself floating weightless in space, as if
in some kind of zero G ballet, and other tracks which make you think that in
the next ship\'s quarters you are going to find a man pinned in place,
subsisting off of his last oxygen, weakly crying out for help.  It makes for
excellent background music anytime your characters find themselves out in
the vacuum.

While I suspect that picking particular tracks for specific game sequences
can heighten the effect of background music on a game, I never had the
coordination to get an effort like that together.

For music with spoken lyrics, New Age seems to be most suited for gaming,
while the New Age instrumental music works even better. Movie Soundtracks
that aren\'t just a collection of pop songs, but rather ACTUAL original
background music make for the best gaming sessions.  Here is a list of CD\'s,
along with a corresponding description of the mood each puts you in, that
may add some serious spice to a campaign that is more bland than you would
like:

Anything by "Kitaro"
(ranging from the presence of aliens to an orchestrated battle)

Jean-Michael Jarre
"Rendezvous"
(futuristic music with pizzazz, boldness and strength)

Anything by Enya
(lullaby effect; great if you ever meet space celts)

"Full Metal Jacket"
(ranging from spooky to heart-pumping tunnel vision)

Also consider "Sound Effects" CD\'s and .wav files available for download on
the \'Net.  If you have a CD writeable drive you could put together a CD with
different tracks of sporadic, chaotic fire from a certain kind of weapon and
even combinations thereof.  Make copies of the CD and get your friends to
all bring their own boom box with a CD for their chosen weapon.  Have them
press play on their box whenever their character starts rockin\' and a
rollin\'.  If your parents, spouse or neighborhood can put up with it, your
characters can learn what it is like to try to communicate when the
deafening music of modern combat is reverberating through the valley.  They
might be less inclined to discharge their weapon, too, if you insist they do
this with the volume cranked up high, or, if they are head-bangers, they
might enjoy cherrying out the gas tube of their M-16A1 in full auto.
Remember to insert a magazine-changing sound file every 30 rounds or so,

is very still with an inversion layer on top, and so the water
supersaturates with CO2. Every once in a while something like an

Subject:  Re: Missiles from long range & scanners







  By the way - I have a few "problems" with the collision rules as they
stand now.  Do you realize that for fighter pilots willing to Kamakazi into
a fast moving ship, that they can easily destroy it as per the collision
rules?
****************
now we know why ships use fusion guns in the PD role :)

A Tigress has *how many* twin fusion guns?  average damage on a fusion gun
is 6d6*600(IIRC, notes at home) or 12,200 damage, more than enough to kill
(melt to slag actualy) a fighter. Problem solved?




  This needs to be addressed somehow.  It rightfully should include the
size modifier of the target - but to my way of thinking:  It should only be
1/2 the size of the target.  Why?  Because you are aiming for dead center
to hit right?
***************
I would agree only if 1/2 the fighter/missile size mod is allowed as well.
representing a bigger cross section trying to hit the target.





You have to guess which way the ship will attempt to evade.
Perhaps a case could be made of subtracting the Target\'s G rating from it\'s
Size modifier because you don\'t know if it will speed up, or slow down as
well.
********************
I don\'t think I can agree on this point, a high G ship already gets a bonus
from the tactical movement. if the target has more accell than the rammer,
it cannot be hit. it will just move out of the hex during the movement
phase (lower accels have to move first!!).

Dont forget the mods to skill for computers! (I think the mod is complexity
- -3?)



New revised collision rules:  Ramming skill + 1/2 target size modifier -
target G rating.  This way, missiles are not the "sure hit" that they are
currently, and... kamakazi fighters can\'t take out multi-billion ships with
their 10 million dollar craft.
Example: firing a missile against a 6g 10 ton fighter now looks like this:
Gunner skill + 4 (1/2 size modifier) - 6 (fighter\'s accel) = skill-2
Firing at CA = gunner skill +7 - 2 (g accel) = skill +5.
********
I would like the contest of skills to stay.


examples:
SDB missile vs TL 12 fighter: rammer skill(14) + 3(1/2 target size) + 0(1/2
rammer size) + 6 (computer) = 23 vs. target skill (16) + 7 (computer) = 23
even chance.

TL 10 fighter vs TL 12 CA: Rammer skill (4) + 7(1/2 target size) + 3(1/2
rammer size) + 5 (computer) = 19 vs target skill (15) + 9 (computer) = 24
good chance to miss.


I do worry that using this will mean that missiles will be even harder to
use against capital ships.  in your combat example even 200 missiles were
not enough to have a good chance of a single hit against a CA.

I was also thinking of having a lightspeed lag of -1 per 20 hexes from the
controling ship.



I am going to make me a PD dice rolling program.

the way I envision PD working,  take all the missiles ramming, and split
the PD turrets between them.
fire, with each turret rolling 3 times(once per weapon) or once with a
bonus to hit.
take the remaining missiles and split fire again.
fire, with each turret rolling 3 times at a -2 to hit.
take the remaining missiles and split fire again.
fire, with each turret rolling 3 times at a -4 to hit.
repeat as needed.

note that near the end of the cycle each missle may have more than one
turret targeting it (at a low chance to hit)
also note that crit fails start to become likely, I recommend that in the
case of large ships a crit fail will stop a turret from working for the
rest of the turn,( the GM can then determing exactly what happened to that
turret.)

I want to input the number of PD weapons, the starting to hit numbers and
the number of missiles.
for output I want the number of missiles hit, the number to penitrate the
defenses, and the number of malfed turrets.


here is an example:

a SDB with two laser turrets is engaged by 18 missiles (from 3 identical
SBDs)
gunner skill is 15 + 15 + 8 + 4 + 10 - 39 = 13 to hit
with 13s  2 hits
with 11s 2 hits
with 9s 2 hits
with 7s  2 hits are stlll likely
with 5s 2 hits possible but only one likey. 1 hit.
with 3s you might get one if you are lucky 0 hits probably one crit fail

total 9 hits 9 penitrations 1 crit fail (overheated weapon? GMs choice)

then the remaing missiles roll contest of skill vs pilot to hit.

Note that one SDB could not swamp the defenses by itself, while 2 SDBs
would likely get three hits (but not guarenteed)

You need a 3-1 throw weight in missile turrets vs PD turrets if you want to
overwhelm the defenses

Bay weapons do a little better, one bay can swamp 8 turrets by itself. or
get guarenteed penitration against 7 turrets.

This makes a 1200 space ship with a missile bay an eggshell with a hammer.
it gets a kill agaainst anything 800 tons or less, but can be killed by
anything with 6 missile turrets. (or even 6 missile armed fighters.)

The snow pack would cause a buildup, which would be released all at

The news report didn\'t list any fatalities (yet). They\'ve got warnings

Extended Life Support has closed loop air, life support, food, and water.
FFS2 keeps all but food, for which there are seperate rules IMO appropriate
for only \'low\' tech solutions (TL10- IMTU).  I rather think a high tech

Hello Aerron and list,

Technicallly?  I think that GT mentions that if you have multiple scanners
that can sense the enemy ship, that you only use the best one.  Ie, if you
have 20 scanners aboard a ship, (for whatever reason that might be!), that
you only use the best one.  Of course, if you have three different scanner
*types* that can be used, you use the best one of each.  To me, this would
also represent the same situation where you have 50 ships each rolling to
see an enemy ship. So, I "presumed" that if you have 4 sensor operators
(regardless of which ship they are on), you only use the best one for the
"group".
*********
according to the info I have rome Dave (I asked him that very thing, each
seperate ship gets a roll to detect each undetected ship.





  Also, if you consider the situation - unless those "escort" DD\'s are
closer to the CVE than the CA, you only need to roll for detection of the
"biggest" thing that comes onto scanner first.  It is possible that those
DD\'s are not going to be in range when the CVE gets a whiff of the CA.
Later on, when the CVE is getting closer, will it matter <grin>.

just what I was trying to say.

I am not sure I understand what you are doing at this point Aerron.  I
think, if I understand you correctly, that you are tailoring the speed of
the missile such that it hits "Exactly" on the hex of the ship it is to
hit.  Am I correct?  I am working from the assumption that in order for a
missile to hit a ship, it must *pass* through the hex containing the ship,
not *end* in the hex containing the ship.
***************
yes you cannot acheive a hit unless you can end your movement phase in the
hex of the ship you are targeting. I was using your reasoning when I
brought this up during playtes, and was told that missiles must end in the
same hex as the target to simulate 3d targeting solutions, and long range
remote guidance factors.

I suspect that part of the reasoning is due to game ballance as well.



Missiles have the following chance of being detected at specified ranges:
Sim-10\'s   41 scan + 0 size modifier - 3 emissions control of TL-4/2 = 38.
Since 38 is greater than the range penalty for zero hex range, even the
best PESA cannot detect a missile at ranges of 0 or less!  Even an active
radar needs:
43 + 0 - 6 (tech level-4) = 37 - much worse than a passive detection!
*********
yikes, I forgot the stealth :)  Capital ships really need pickets with ecm
modules!!






>of accelleration.  The closest the CVE needs to approach the CA is some 36
>hexes away.
>**************
>one thing you didn\'t mention was the location of the screening DDs if one
>is deployed 10 hexes aft of the CA it might detect.  lets see:
The problem with your assumption Aerron (and I might be the one who is
wrong here) is that the range penalties for a ship that is 176 hexes away
is the same as the range penalties as one that is 186 hexes away.  DD\'s
that are that close in won\'t be able to detect the CVE!
****************
here are the numbers again:            CA/aftDD/forwardDDs
11)     54+6       126       6/132      -9/-9/-10
12)     54+12      72        18/90      -8/-8/-9
13)     54+18      18        36/54    closest approach is 54 h  -7/-6/-8

is is to detect the CVE  the CA and the aft DD have the same chance to
detect until closest appoach when the aft DD is one better (and the forward
DDs are always one worse.)  but with 4 rolls they should get a detection (I
dont think they can catch it though.)





  One rule change that might make this worthwhile?  Treat a missile swarm
as being equal to 1/5th their size as a "single ship".  Thus, 200 missiles
would be treated as a size 400 cf hull.  This would equate to a +3 size
modifier.  I used a 1/5th modifier because the missiles will not be
clustered tightly while in flight.  They will likely be dispersed by a
small amount, and then cluster closer and closer as they impact within a
zero range hex.
*************
now that is a Good Idea (TM).  I like that alot.





Your assumptions of statistics are um, a bit poor.  Statistically speaking,
regardless of a gunner\'s skill, 5% of all missiles fired upon a target will
miss due to automatic failures (ie rolls of 17 or 18).  Thus, a ship firing
200 missiles will miss with 10 right off the bat.
***********
these still clog up point defense though as you don\'t know they missed
until after the contest of skills.


 In order for a CA to
dodge, it must roll versus Skill + accel-target size modifer/2. For a CA
with a skill 16 pilot, Manuever 2, and size modifier +14, the dodge works
out to: 4/2 + PD4 = 6.  Statistically, this will result in dodging 10%.
Therefore, out of 190 missiles, it will dodge 19.
**********
isn\'t this a contest of skills?


This leaves 171
missiles.  Statistically speaking - 5% of those missiles will be missed due
to rolls of 17 or 18 (regardless of skill of gunner), which amounts to a
bleed through rate of 8.55 missiles.  Therefore, 18 missiles will hit on
target just by sheer numers alone.  And this, with only 4 missile bays!
********************
Justone thing is missing, the defender can retarget misses, and will
depending on skill get 4-7 chances to fire each turret, and deach turret
rolls three times for an inital bleed rate of only 0.05^3=0.000125 or
0.0125% not much chance of bleed through even on the first round of
targeting.

For each PD turret the target has you need about 6 missiles (depending on
skill and tech level) to swamp the defenses in one salvo.


I do agree that surprise modifiers are needed on the PD roll.

A directional fragmentation mine is not going to cause much more stress then
reactive armor used on many modern AFV\'s today.  I can see this being standard
on military ships (great for clearing you LZ) and an option for those craft
involved in less-than-legal endeavors.  Engineering for such a system would
most likely consist of the fragmentation charges sitting in reinforced
recesses in the hull with retractable panels (protection during flight/reentry
as well as making them less obvious to starport inspectors who\'d be less then
wild about having a ship-sized directional mine on the tarmac).  There could
also be an option to link them to the ship\'s sensor grid so your frag charges
can act as active armor, detecting incoming projectiles like rockets and
missiles and detonating preemptively to claw them out of the air with
fragments.

Well no, because now you have a fighter-sized cloud of rapidly-cooling slag

In my defense I would like to point out:

1) I don\'t play AD&D anymore (well, not much, I crossed over to rolemaster 6
years ago)

2) I started with *D&D* (and still have the books)

3) It was \'The Dragon\' articles on CT that sparked my interest in Traveller
to begin with, so naturally I still associate it with Traveller (even though
I haven\'t bought an issue in 15 years).  Traveller Digest was mostly
published while I was in the Navy - just getting the books was interesting.

Well, statistically speaking there is a small but measurable chance that any
given skydiver\'s parachute will fail.  That means that every time we jump,
one of us may ...ahem, precede the rest to the ground.  Does that mean that
I won\'t jump again?  Nope...I don\'t look at the odds that way, or if I do, I
think the precautions that I take offset them.  (regardless of the fact that
much more experienced \'divers have rolled that \'catastrophic failure\' before
me....)

I\'m sure that \'timers\' have the same mindset.  (although, I don\'t see how
they get quite the same rush....)

So far as the bulk of low-berth travel, I can see a lot of scenarios that
would support it.  Young people wanting to see the universe (on a budget),
someone with a incurable disease (at the current tech level) travelling to a
higher tech world for medical treatment, displaced workers needing to find a
new job market, low level mega-corp employees (and family) being relocated,
Military personnel going home on leave and so on...

There is nothing, AFAIK that speaks to that.  IMTU, however, I play it as a
sop thrown to the masses by the Nobility.  Basically, for a trade line to
get any kind of guarentees for a trade line (i.e. basing rights on the
starport, tax considerations, etc...), they have to provide low cost
transport to allow the disaffected portions of the populous the ability to
\'escape\' their situations (i.e. emigrate to other planets.)  In some cases,
the emigree may not be all that willing - ever seen a low berth passenger
escorted onto the ship by one or more officials of the planet? ;^)  (And
once he\'s in the berth, they toss in an extra 2 or 3 Kcr to the low berth
lottery with him as the \'winner\'....)

For smaller traders (i.e. player characters) the low berths provide ways to
get critically wounded PCs from low-tech worlds to higher tech medical
facilities, without complication (other than the slight chance of dying on
the way...)

Finally, (again IMTU rules), I have created portable low berths that are
treated basically like cargo, they are even packed into cargo modules
(albeit, ones that require power connections....)  These are for long term
passengers - i.e. someone who wants to go subsector and even sector
distances.  These have the advantage of only requiring a single survival
roll, but may require 1d3 (the infamous half die!) weeks to travel a single
jump.

There are TNE write-ups of Imperial artillery systems in the Regency Combat
Vehicle Guide (RCVG).  In the indirect fire role the Imperium has the
following:

- -Imperial Multiple "Rocket" Launcher Vehicle (MRLV):  12 dton chassis with a
20-shot box of 30cm "rockets".  These rockets have a 650km range and listed
warheads include HE, HEAP, submunition, and homing submunition.  The rockets
also have EMS guidance for terminal homing by a forward observer.  

- -Imperial Remote Drone Missile Artillery Vehicle (RDMAV): Built on the same
hull as the MRLV, this unit carries 34 grav drones.  Each drone has almost 5m
in length, equipped with a 3km PEMS, have a 2 hour endurance, an NOE cruise
mode of 200kph, and an attack range or 12.36 km (based on 5 seconds at
"sprint"-mode).  Warheads are of the type as the artillery rockets.

- -Imperial Meson Artillery Vehicle:  Built on a beefed up Astrin/Trepida II
chassis (20 dtons), the meson gun has a rate of fire of 1 shot every 20
seconds and an effective range of 3000 km (with link to other sensors it can
hit targets out to 30,600 km but beyond 6000 km there is no area of effect).

An option for ortillery beyond beam weapons would be kinetic-kill "crowbars"
using a "cheap" high-boost grav drive (really a rather well designed drive,
cheap only in that the drive is only built for that single shot and will burn
itself out to achieve a high attack velocity) and terminal guidance sensors.
For area strikes, larger bus missiles to carry bundles of kinetic kill weapons
mixed with homing anti-personnel submunitions.

Material in Striker II and the RCVG place four-sled meson batteries at
regimental-level with no other artillery systems.  This seems a bit of a flaw
as the Marines are now without area attack weapons (with the MRLV) or
recon/attack assets (the RDMRV).  Imperial Army formations don\'t possess meson
sleds but the other systems appear at regimental-level (battery of two MRL
sections and one RDM section) and battalion-level (single MRL platoon for
infantry, Guard cavalry have a full battery).

Interesting and IYTU, but seems to run contrary to the tech.  No doubt the
actions are violent when forces commit to battle, but the appearance of grav
drive would seem to make wars ones of maneuver as opposed to attrition. The
mobility of Marine IFV\'s and panzers allow small units to cover large areas.
When contact does occur it is likely to be violent and short.  Drawn out
battles will only last until one side or the other can bring artillery
(ground, aerospace, and orbital) to bear and smash the other side\'s
concentration of forces.  While maneuver war has not been ignored above, the
chances of drawn out attrition fights like WWI or US Civil War seem very
unlikely.

Also, smaller Imperial Marine forces being relegated to foot runs contrary to
the trends and seems to draw more from the doctrine of contemporary Marine
units (most notably the USMC).  Given the amount of terrain one must cover and
the need to keep mobile to survive the Imperial Marines will look more like a
combination of air assault and mechanized infantry with Marine IFV\'s providing
fast mobility and high firepower (especially given the relative scarcity of
panzers in Marine formations, somewhat made up for by the use of a fire
support IFV as the platoon command vehicle).  The need for the Marine squad to
work in concert with the IFV\'s preclude their existing in a separate transport
platoon/company and instead they become part of the squad (it\'s good to
personally know the IFV gunners when said individuals have a thumb on the nuke
tac missiles and you\'re dismounted).

Interesting ideas and a good post.  Again, IYTU and my own comments are skewed
by my own service time in Army.  There are a few things in canon I\'d like to

Neat!  My dad was motor sergeant in the 172nd, and then came back for
the conversion to 6th Light after working on the 7th at Ord.

The T2K campaign I ran in California had the troops walk from Poland,
across the USSR, ski across the Strait, then hoof the Alcan back down to
the US.  Loads of fun.

There is a file I have from years ago about someone jokingly complaining
about role-playing games.  They said that RPGs were taking away from war
games, and denying the opportunity for the kids to learn strategy,
tactics, and how to set up an L ambush.  He did take a moment to praise
T2K and the \'correct\' type of RPG.

>I am thinking allong the lines of +6

I disagree, strongly, for two reasons. 

The first is realism; in reality, decent laser tracking equipment is 
pretty much guaranteed a hit on a missile out to a thousand km or more.
Traveller-quality lasers will make impact missiles life very complicated.

The other is play balance. The missiles in G:T already are quite deadly,
doing crippling damage to PC spacecraft - and they\'re not particularly
optimized. Missiles could get substantially bigger (G:T missile magazines
hold 77 shots, which is way too many - 7 shots of a missile ten times
bigger would be perfectly practical.) Second, they could get much faster -
bigger missiles could have fusion power plants and essentially unlimited
endurance, which lets them strike at very high speeds when fired at long
ranges. Since energy goes as (speed^2), big fusion missiles will do ship-
crippling damage even to capital ships. If one doesn\'t leave impact missiles
as very easy to shoot down, they will come to *completely* dominate G:T
space combat (especially since G:T laser/energy weapon ranges are quite short.)
This would, in my opinion, be bad. 

The way to fix this is not to make point defence less effective but to 
introduce new types of missiles that are harder to shoot down but also do
less damage. The two obvious choices are fragmentation - missiles that
detonate a few hundred or thousand km out into a cloud of submunitions, 
only a few of which will hit a (presumably evading) target for moderate
damage - and det-laser for military applications.

I would think that the slagged fighter would expand somewhat, due to the
impact of a fusion-reacting plasma, plus the decompression of the
atmosphere inside the fighter (even if its only the atmosphere inside
the pilot\'s vac suit), plus the release of whatever power plant the
fighter has.  If that\'s the case, then the impact would be spread over a
larger area, and thus would be less lethal (picture the difference
between the damage from a punch, and the damage from a punch with a
knife blade).

Not to mention the fact that at least some of the fighter\'s mass would
vaporize, thus reducing the mass that could impact on the target ship.

When I was involved in high energy flywheel development a few years back,
we found maintenance of a vacuum was more difficult than weatherproofing.
There again, we were sealing a vacuum chamber in an atmosphere, and some
storms can be very nasty.

   The vehicle has a crew of 1 (driver) and carries 3 passengers. It mounts a
HMG on a pintle at the forward passenger position. No fire control installed.
Height: 1.0 m. Width: 1.8 m. Length: 3.5 m. Total Volume: 4.4 m^3. Weight: 3.4
tons. Price: Cr 19,195.

   Movement: 181 kph/151 cm.
   Movement Effects on Fire: Move half or less, -4 FFP, no fire EFP; Move more
than half, no fire.
   Armour: Front/sides/ 9; back, 6; deck, nil; belly, 2.
   Target Size DM\'s: +1 low.
   Equipment: Half a ton (0.50 m^3) of cargo.
   Power: 0.45 megawatt fuel cell consumes 16 liters of fuel(includes oxygen)
per hour; fuel capacity is 30 liters, enough for 1.8 hours. P/W ratio is 131.
   Weapons: see HMG on table, page 36. Basic load is 750 rounds.


  Design notes: As a further variation, the vehicle is designed with "advanced"
composite laminates; weight is normal, cost is KCr 9.0/m^3, and Toughness is
2.5 rather than 2.0 for the generic TL 7-9 material at KCr 7.0/m^3 (if desired
reduce cost by Cr 130 and change all vertical armour faces to AV 5). Removing
the HMG and ammo reduces price by Cr 4875.

  The driver can adjust their seat to raise them above the hull level (full
volume
for the position is allocated within the hull); the passengers are exposed above
the waist if sitting, or almost fully if operating the HMG.

  FWIW, the vehicle could float. Ground pressure for the entire vehicle
foot-print
would be 0.54, which might prove handy if you park it in wet concrete or
such. The vehicle is a bit bulky to transport - the moderate sloping front
and sides bulks it
up to about half a displacement ton for shipping purposes.

"Plowshare" came from the Bible verse about beating swords into
plowshares. Seems appropriate for a program devoted to finding civilian
uses for weapons technology. :-)

The preffered version was to use underground blasts, placed shallow
enough that you\'d get the maximum sized subsidence crater. This means
that you don\'t really *have* cleanup, as the contaminated materials are
under a 100 or more meters of rock.

Plants use CO2 to make sugars. But at night, they use O2 to "burn" the
sugars for energy. Pure CO2 will kill plants.

Also, it acidifies the water and moist soil. This can change the pH
enough to cause trouble.

Yet another reason why I favor having  vertical landing or takeoff

From a nature show, there are places in Africa where CO2 seeps from
underground sources. It accumulates in depressions, and animals that
wander in die. This is not due to CO2 toxicity (see below), but because
the CO2 has *replaced* the air. 

An atmosphere with high CO2 can cause panting and shortness of breath
(even if there *is* sufficient oxygen). At higher levels it causes
acidosis, and eventually, death. 

You can sometimes detect high CO2 levels (far higher than the danger
level) by the "sharp" taste/smell. This is due to the formation of
carbonic acid on the mucuos membranes of the mouth and nose. It\'s not
really a taste or smell.

I\'m willing to bet that most of that 3.5 m3 is water. Extended

refigure just solid food.

  Likewise, extended life support on a starship recycles the
atmosphere (and recovers quite a bit of water doing it...)
Your only problem is what to do with the abundant CO2 and smaller
amounts of smelly organic volatiles humans give off. My guess is
that lower TL systems simply filter and store it: Higher TL
systems have more sophisticated equipment for reprocessing.
    Your mass and maintenance requirements involve replacement of
leakage and servicing of filtration and recycling requirements,
which should be much cheaper than carrying and venting all your
consumables.

   I can\'t quite swallow industrialization as a major cause of
atmospheric taint. In my book, Industrial worlds with tainted
atmospheres had tainted atmospheres to begin with.
    In a oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, the common industrial
pollutants don\'t last very long. Ozone breaks back down into
oxygen.  Nitrogen oxides break back down into nitrogen and
oxygen.  Sulfur oxides are soluble in water (as in acid rain,
which may be bad for the local ecology, but it does get them out
of the air). Hydrocarbons are oxidized into carbon dioxide and
water.  These pollutants are only a problem in local areas where
industry or vehicles continually regenerate them faster than they can be
broken down.
   They are also characteristic of a world which relies heavily
on hydrocarbon fuels. An industry that spews these pollutants out
on a scale to taint the whole atmosphere is more likely to
exhaust its fuels first.

IMTU the Marines operate from Company-sized assault ships for the most
part.  These ships are equipped to drop 150 capsules at a time, and since a
Marine Company is about 100 sophonts (three platoons of 30 plus
leadership), they can include a great amount of deadfall ordinance along
with the initial strike.

During the battle, support is usally orbital laser fire or the ever-popular
superdense crowbar.  The laser has the advantage of faster responce time,
the crowbar the advantage of being guided.

Marines on the ground can carry fairly lethal support missiles themselves.
Given a TL15 technology, I can easily see a two-man team carrying a
babynuke missile launcher.

Once again, IMTU.  Meson sleds are a Regimental asset, and consist of one
platoon of vehicles (two complete weapons systems.)  The feeling is that
the systems are too delicate an expensive, and that orbital fire is
avalible from support fleet resources if needed.

Joseph R. Dietrich said:

Answer: poor design. The grav tanks Andrew Madden ("Count Leto of Tavonni")
developed mounted a ship\'s fusion gun (Striker/MT penetration 103), a Z-gun
as a secondary weapon and a RF-Y as a tertiary weapon/defence. The frontal
armor was (from memory) AF 96, so I think it could almost withstand a
direct hit from its own weapon. It could survive being in the outer half of
the primary blast radius of a nuke (although I can\'t remember what Striker
would have ruled about its occupants!!). A computer-linked platoon could
fire as if they were a factor-9 ship\'s battery.

I admit I always thought they were just high-value targets, but they were a
fearsome weapon (as long as you didn\'t have to equip an entire army, just a
few platoons).

The MT Trepida is junk. Mostly because of the uniform armor rating that MT
used - simple and good for starships, too simple for combat vehicles. It
can\'t withstand its own weapon! I created a spreadsheet to re-distribute
armor on MT vehicles, and even then the Trepida was junk. Short of
re-designing the whole thing, I decided to double the armor thickness and
_then_ re-rate it, and it came out a bit better. If I can find the
spreadsheet, I\'ll post the re-rated stats.

BTW, the TNE version of the Trepida/Intrepid/Norris tanks is *much* better,
assuming you like TNE. TNE is not my favourite system, but *at least* the
Trepida was built as a really nasty weapon system that you would NOT want
to have to face.

Several possibilities, choose a vector that minimizes heating, it is
possible to re-enter the atmosphere without heat sheilding if you do
it correctly. However, from memory that would not be a good military
option, too much time in one flat trajectory, no chance to dodge enemy
fire.

Or use your agrav to slow your descent enough to avoid the heating, or
just fit an ablative shield specially for such drops. (Sort of like
the Sherman DD kit could be fitted for the landing and then removed )

Obvioulsy this is not limited to G-Carriers, you could drop anything
with good enough  agrav.

The major reason I would suggest this as an assult option is that if
you have ten G-Carriers in a large shuttle and it gets shot down,
you\'ve lost ten G-Carriers and a shuttle. Also, if you haven\'t got
many shuttles it will limit
the speed at which you deploy your armour.

Actually, there\'s an album with a similar concept by the Orb called "the
orb\'s adventures beyond the ultraworld". The British version is longer, but
the American version goes sort of from the sky, to a view of the earth, to
the end of the universe, into the fourth dimension, and so on. They do it in
a much wittier fashion, but still. It\'s a good album, really worth a listen,
especially if you like mellow, ambient techno. Would probably work extremely
well as Traveller background music as well.

I\'ll still have to think of my own Traveller soundtrack though.

Well, consider the way things work in reality. A fighter impacting at a
*relative* velocity of 100 km/sec will release enery equivalent to a
1.1 kiloton nuke for every ton of mass it has. 

If the closing velocity is 200 km/sec, then the enery release is 4.4
kilotons per ton. 

The rule of thumb is that at *three* km/sec, an impacting body has
energy equal to its mass in TNT. The energy goes up as the *square* of
the velocity (ie twice as fast = four times the energy, three times as
fast = nine times the energy).

And closing velocities in Traveller can get into the *thousands* of
km/sec. At that velocity, each ton of mass is equivalent to 111
kilotons.  *Ouch*.

The only reason most missiles aren\'t kinetic kill is because hitting a
ship is *hard*. And avoiding any sort of decent point defense once you
get within, say, 50,000 km is next to impossible.

Heck, one of the possible problems is that the CMOS clock or the BIOS
doesn\'t handle the "rollover" correctly. That is, it rolls over to 1900
instead of 2000. If you are there, you can catch this, down the system
"gracefully", reset the clock (even the ones that don\'t roll over
correctly will work if the year is set manually) and then bring the
system up again. 

If you aren\'t watching, all sorts of messy things happen as programs
start using that wrong date.

The other warhead to consider is a combustion laser. Built via FFS2, you
can put a reasonably mean laser that will fire at horizon ranges on a missile.

This is important, becuase point defense is pretty standard once you get
beyond TL9, which means missiles tend not to get to contact range.

Once you have these babies, you have instant reaction fire out to
communicator range.

The key would thus be minimising your signature, and calling in the
artillery fire via meson communicators.

Unless you assume battlefield size gravitic sensors, in which case grav
technology becomes very dangerous to use on a battlefield.

Try building some autocannon with your favorite design sequence. A 20mm
round easily punches battledress in FFS2 and Striker.

IMO the age of the missile ends at TL9, with vehicle-portable point defense
fire control.

The INV Kenneth Stabler (AB-17331) is a typical example of the Raider-class
Marine Company Transport.  Built around a 2000dt hull, the Stabler (known
as the "Snake" to her crew), is designed to carry a Marine Company into
battle and provide support for that company.

In terms of performance, the Stabler easily meets Fleet standards.  Capable
of 3.1 G\'s of acceleration when fully loaded and carrying Jump-4 drives,
INV Stabler can be matched with any standard Naval formation.  She is
capable of self refueling, with full fuel processing taking 38 hours from
initiation of the skimming maneuver.

Since the vessel is intended as a transport, and not as a warship, weaponry
in minimal.  Four batteries of dual-mount 145-Mj rapid fire lasers make up
the entirety of the ship\'s firepower.  Defenses, on the other hand, are
extensive.  Stabler mounts several sand casters, damper turrets, a damper
screen, meson screen, as well as several ECM arrays.

At the heart of the Stabler\'s mission is it\'s Marine compliment.  As of
this writing (112-1105) The Stabler carries N Company of the 1183rd Marine
Regiment ("Hell on the Half-Shell"), currently assigned to the 43rd Fleet
in Lunion/Spinward Marches.  The 100 Marines live in fairly spacious
quarters, and have several training rooms for maintaining equipment and
their skills.  This includes a BattleDress trainer that provides a VR
training environment.

Marines make most assaults by means of rapid interface capsules.. the
famous "drop trooper" attack.  These capsules a 1/2dt, and the Stabler
carries facilities to drop 150 capsules at a time.  When making a drop,
fifty of the capsules will be loaded with spare equipment,
deadfall/anti-radar ordinance, or EW/ECM decoys.  The Stabler usually
carries enough reloads for two full drops.  Reloading the drop tubes is a
time-consuming task, taking several hours.

With the Marines on the ground, the Stabler can either loiter over head to
provide supporting fire, or withdraw to a safer position to await further
orders.  As always, the current situation will decide the tactics.  Most
Raider skippers prefer to stay close to their charges.

For pick-up, and situations where a full assault is not needed, the Stabler
carries two 40dt pinnaces in small hangers.  These can be modified for
normal passenger/cargo duty, or outfitted as recovery/fire support boats.

During peacetime, the fifteen line companies of a Marine regiment operate
out of ships much like the Stabler.  Some vessels wander their assigned
subsector on independent patrol, others form up into battalion sized units
for intensive training, some remain with major fleet elements.  

Although they are Imperial Navy, the ships and their crews answer to the
subsector\'s Fleet Colonel (O-7), the officer in charge of all Marine
activities for the area.  In practice, this means the ships are under the
commander of the Regiment, since it is unlikely that the FltCol would
override his subordinate in matters concerning his Regiment.  Despite the
long rivalry between Marines and Navy, there is very little friction on
most Raiders, and the Navy crews express a great deal of pride in being
"mud-movers."

        The issue is getting it down to the surface fast enough to

        Well, the one shuttle carries the entire complement of G-Carriers
for the 3 platoons doing the landing, but you are correct, it is an "all
eggs in one basket approach"....  

        Hmmm...  So a launch tube firing G-Carriers on re-entry sleds that
break away after touch down.  No reason the "sleds" couldn\'t be pulling the
same speed as the capsules (since the capsules can\'t be built under CT:HG
rules anyway).  Good idea.

  I\'m still looking for my MICV designs :(  IAC, 7-9 pen is fine until TL B+

even TL E+ battlesuits can hardly risk exposure to a VRF gauss gun (or an

    'body' => '   Some of you mentioned the possible velocities of a beam fired from a particle beam weapon.  I\'d be very interested in having a good accurate figure for the speed of such a beam, preferably based on real life info.  Perhaps some atom smasher data.
   The speed matters because the slower the beam the more targeting suffers, because light and the particle beam only go so fast.  This effect is almost insignificant for lasers, but becomes very significant for a particle beam that only moves at say . . .  10% of lightspeed.  For instance, in GURPS Traveller space combat such a weapon would suffer an average of -1 to hit for every hex of range to the target.  Knowing the speed of the beam would help lock down this figure.
   The above question goes for meson beams too.  Do they travel /faster/ than lightspeed?  If so then there might be no significant accuracy penalty at all.  Interesting situation too: Aiming directly at your view of the target might mean that you really are pointing right at the target.  The fact that the target is two light-seconds away doesn\'t matter because the beam is sped up to go two seconds into the past!  (Or at least that\'s one sci-fi model).

   I\'m not too happy with the GURPS Traveller space combat rules (mein gott . . .  lasers have an effective range of only 2-3 hexes!).  I\'m fine-tuning a series of fixes to the rules, which looks pretty good after one playtest session.  I don\'t have a web site -- I\'m a hardware guy, not software -- so anyone who wants a copy just drop me a line at my address below.  Comments appreciated.

  Mesons most assuredly are not faster than light. Mesons are an existing
family of elementary particles (consisitng at least of pions and kaons, my
memoty fails me again...), and _nothing_ in the observed universe travels
faster than light!
  I\'d say meson beams would have to be pretty close to c, though. The
meson family particles have avereage lifetimes in the 10^-8 to 10^-16
regime, and to get the beam to reach 10 hexes berore decaying you clearly
need over a second of (particle frame) lifetime. That means a time
dilatation factor in the 10^8 range at least. My calculator fails me, but
that\'s a c fraction of _at least_  v/c = SQR( 1 - (10^-8)^2). Do the math
yourselves, it\'s a pretty mean velocity in any case.

  I agree wholeheartedly. I think kinetic kill submunition missiles might
be kept small. Adding terminal guidance (Such is not mentioned in GT at
least.), and passive maser/laser reflectors might allow a single 1spc
turret to spew out 4-6 missiles/ turn riding the same commo beam. This
would present a possibility of actually exhausting that 77 missile
magazine in a longer combat, and would also give you more of a chance to
overwhelm target\'s point defense. (Even with missiles detonating several
kiloklicks out PD lasers would still be quite a menace, I imagine.)
  For big brute lineship killers the good old 1/2 D.ton detonation nuke
missile seems like a pretty good alternative to me. (Also, what about 1

Mesons are guaranteed to travel at close to lightspeed in order for them to
live long enough to die inside the target. Particle beams would also move
close to lightspeed. I\'d say for gaming purposes lasers, mesons and
particle beams all travel at c but as mesons need to hit the target at the
right depth as well some bonus for evasion when fired at by mesons should
be in effect (this I believe it does in Bruces system).

AFAIK,
What they would do was sneak up on enemy positions, turn the claymores
around (especially the command detonated ones) and then stage an attack.
Boom Bang, dead GI\'s from their own claymores. Nice trick. Later the GI\'s
put luminous paint on the back of the claymores and could tell if they had
been turned.

Water recycling is *easy*, especially when you\'ve got that fusion
reactor to supply heat and radiation. 

You remove the solids from the sewage, and use moderate heat to drive
off any remaining water. Optionally, you use some gamma radiation from
the reactor (or some other source) to sterilize the dried solids. They
get compacted and stored until planetfall. They are valuable biomass
for colonies and the like.

The water (and other liquids/gases) that are driven off are distilled.
The water goes back into the system, the other residues are burned to
water, CO2, and miscellaneous gases or otherwise converted to
manageable items.

Air recycling consists of several stages.

Primary stage is found on *all* craft and on most vac suits. It
consists of filters or other devices to remove excess water vapor,
excess CO2, and any unwanted chemicals (odors, etc) from the air.

Water is removed either by condensation, or by absorption. Absorption
involves chemicals that absorb water vapor. They *will* get saturated
and quit working. At this point they have to be heated to drive off the
wate, and you have to be able to do *something* with the released
water. Condensers just need power for refrigeration, and tankage to
store the water in. (You *will* wind up with more water than you
started with).

CO2 is absorbed by chemicals such as lithium hydroxide or calcium
hydroxide. These *can* be revived, but it\'s a messy process, and you\'d
then still have to get rid of the CO2 some other way. 

Other chemicals are dealt with by activated charcoal. As with all the
other primary "filters" it will get saturated eventually. Re-activating
the filters is another process best left for a larger installion that
has secondary systems.

Secondary systems recovers the filtered water via condensation. It is
then turned over to the water recycling systems.

Given that ships need to be able to cool things to LH2 temperatures,
they may also remove CO2 via condensation. At about 70 atmospheres
pressure, CO2 will liquefy at low temps (at lower pressures it stays a
gas until it condenses out as a solid "frost" like coating of dry ice).
Oxygen and nitrogen can be seperated as well if the designer so
desires. Anything else is probably worth storing (liquid argon, etc do
have value).

The CO2 could be stored, or more likely broken down electrically or via
the high temps available from the reactor.

The "unwanted chemicals" and odors would either be handled by activated
charcoal, or by using high temps or addition of ozone to break them
down into more easily handled gases. 

None of the above require overly large equipment, given the volumes
dedicated to life support.
 
Food recycling requires a fair amount of space for plants and "animals"
(could be things like fish or salamanders).

Depends on how much combat endurance you want to give the ship. Your
average trader with a missile turret is probably happy with `one up the
spout, three on the ready rack\'. You missile destroyer will want *a lot*
of missiles it you\'re planning to besiege a planet with it.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I was considering the idea that a 100tn missile bay might consist of
about ten tons of launch equipment, ten tons or so of advanced ECCM
and missile direction gear, and 80tns of "ready rack" missiles. A 50tn
missile bay might have fewer tubes, less extensive dedicated electronics,
and a smaller missile load (so it\'s less able to maintain fire volume), thus
explaining the lower missile factor.

Some people see a missile bay as being like the ballistic missile tubes
on a Trident submarine - the whole volume is taken up by launch tubes.
I\'m thinking they may be more like the torpedo room on an attack sub,
with a quantity of launch tubes and a larger quantity of ready stores.

  Striker supports your view of the rough ratio of tubes to other stuff
by specifying in the High Guard integration rules section that bays are
considered to have X (not terribly great) number of Y size (pretty damn
small, considering a warship at least 1000 Dt) missiles; multiple volley
capability is implied, IIRC. Book 2, near the back.

  Most high-tech tanks could survive such a HEAP (best under rules - no
crowbar creation sequence/stats) hit to their fronts, maybe even a side.
It\'s a damn shame that the target aspect would be "Top".

  AFAIK it\'s largely just that you can build them using different
(scarce) production resources - important when your output of full
tracklayers is vitally needed elsewhere; i.e., they suck :)  but it
would be nice to be able to simulate the hardware of worlds that
have that limitation and/or don\'t know any better.

grav (OK - locals ain\'t got it), and the combat system doesn\'t model a
vehicle that takes multiple Major pens/Catastrophic results to kill.

  You could, however, design one (roughly) under High Guard :)

At squad and platoon levels don\'t overlook ye-olde  slugthrowers,
especially when the danger space of a PGMP/FGMP or TAC Missile is
inappropriate to the mission.

According to Challenge 64, a squad-level support weapon for  ACR-
armed troops is the 7mm LMG-10 and 9mm LMG-10  (which  can  share
ammo with the equivalent ACR).  A squad-level support weapon  for
gauss rifle-equipped troops is the 4mm Gauss  LMG-12  (which  can
share ammo with the 4mm gauss rifle).  And finally, the  4mm  LRF
Gauss Gun ... a PC favorite! ... (which can share ammo  with  the
VRF gauss gun):  "It can be carried by battle dress as a  \'light\'
support weapon."

IMTU Imperial Marines are "heavied  up"  special  forces  (having
more in common with the SAS than the  USMC),  often  deployed  to
take/hold starports and key  urban  targets.  Surgical  precision
and lack of colateral damage is usually more important  than  raw
firepower.  Thus, while they can call upon FGMPs  and  the  like,
their preferred weapons are the various form of gauss  gun  (from
the near silent gauss pistol, to the VRF gauss  gun  at  platoon-
level).

Imperial Marines typically ride in a TL15 Empress Grav APC, while
regular army troops get the TL14 Astrin Grav APC (101 Vehicles).

Additionally, while the bulk of the IM are  carried  in  company-
sized units with fleets, 5% travel on Iylvir class Light  Assault
Troop Carriers (IISS  Ship  Files).  [CT:  200-ton,  Jump-2,  2G,
Crew=7, Marines=28, 4 GCarriers and equipment or 72 tons cargo].

All this contradicts the  article  "Imperial  Marine  Task  Force
Organization" in JTAS 12, which  states  that  all  IM  personnel
(even admin and logistics  units,  but  not  medical  staff)  are
equipped with battle dress and FGMP-14s.

I\'ve been experimenting with this with some  success  ever  since
the soundtracks article in Digest 17 (many years ago).  I started
with sound effects (rather than straight music):

In an old briefcase I mounted  4  cheap  auto-reversing  walkmans
with  the headphone sockets linked into a budget mic  mixer  from
Radio Shack, and  from  there  into  a  boom  box.  Taking  sound
effects from specialised albums (vinyl), cassettes,  and  CDs,  I
would dub the same sound over and over to fill a blank tape (both
sides).  Using the mixer set  up  allowed  me  to  either  create
\'scenes\' on the fly, cue up the next \'scene\', and switch  between
\'scenes\' when the party splits up.  The trick for this to work is
to limit yourself  primarily  to  \'ambiant\'  sounds  rather  than
\'event\' sounds (otherwise  you  end  up  playing  DJ  instead  of
GM\'ing).  I have a growing library of over 64 tapes:

- - starship general background hum
- - starship engin background hum
- - bridge bleeps
- - starport tarmac noise
- - starport bar sounds
- - rain
- - wind
- - polar wind (within minuets people actually feel colder!)
- - seagulls
- - low tech urban sounds
- - mid tech urban sounds
- - distant ground combat (with sparodic sniper fire ... actually a
  firework display sound effect!)
- - air raid siren
- - red alert/battle stations
- - decompression alarm (my fav <evil grin>)
and so on.

More recently, I\'ve started to use music as well:

- - For the opening theme music for a Traveller session I  use  the
  first 64 seconds of "Prologue" from the Evil Dead  3  (Army  of
  Darkness) album, and "Manly Men" from the same  album  for  the
  ending theme.

- - "The Imperial March" from The Empire Strikes Back album is good
  when an Imperial fleet is present.

- - "Klingons" from Star Trek III (The Search For Spock) does  well
  when a Sword Worlds fleet is present.

- - When exploring the ruins of an Ancient site (on an  uninhabited
  planet) its hard to beat "The  Alien  Planet"  from  the  Alien
  soundtrack album.

- - And when that same Ancient site wasn\'t as  dead  as  the  party
  would have liked,  I  switched  to  "The  Cenobites"  from  the
  Hellraiser album.

- - I did try "The Canteena" from the Star  Wars  album  but  after
  eight or nine loops it gets very irritating.  I\'ll have to  try
  something else.

Finally, I just discovered FX Master ... sharware from Wintertree
Software.  That allows you to  have  150  WAV  files  set  up  on
Windows buttons.  So with a second hand laptop I can now do event
sounds.  (Haven\'t tried it yet, but soon.)

Well, exactly what weapons are optimized against missiles depends on the sort
of missiles; since you generally know what angle missiles are going to be shot
at from you can actually armor them fairly seriously, particularly if you allow
ablative armor (I\'ve seen missile designs for a (non-traveller) TL 9 space
setting in GURPS which had more than 2,000 DR from the frontal arc.  They were
a couple of tons each.  They also carried X-ray detlasers with an effective
range of some 8,000 miles, so point defense systems were actually significantly
larger than the standard traveller lasers...).

Dedicated point defense weaponry against non-detlasers really only needs a
range of a few hundred miles under normal circumstances; how about a
lightweight fusion gun?  Much better armor penetration than the laser.

Say, a 90 MJ TL 10 fusion gun with extreme range and RoF 3 (8400 lb, 168 cf,
$650k) doing 6d*100 with Acc 26 and 1/2 of 1,100 mi, Max 3,300 mi.  Add full
stabilization (840 lb, $84k, 16.8 cf) and a universal mount (4200 lb, $8.4k, 84
cf).  It uses 180 MJ per shot, a rechargeable energy bank with 180 MJ at TL 10
is 10 lb and $1k.  We\'ll give it 150 shots for 1,500 lb, $150k, 15 cf.  We fill
remaining space with a 18 megawatt fusion power slice (3,600 lb, 72 cf, $180k)
and access space (144 cf), which recharges a shot every 10 seconds.  Total
18,540 lb (9.3 tons), $1.07 MCr, 1 space (499.8 cf).

Note that high RoF/capacity weaponry should probably not have the -2 per
successive attempt penalty for standard lasers.  Yes, this makes missiles even
_less_ useful.

Again, just skimming this thread, but I had an interesting idea I thought
I might share.  Regarding the problem of wrong-handed proteins and the
like, might it not be easier to modify the colonist than the colony?  I\'m
not talking about wholesale genetic engineering of people, but rather of
the intestinal flora and fauna that help us digest foods.  How hard would
it be to develop some geneered microbes that one could take, perhaps in
pill form, to help one digest local proteins and sugars?  Ideally, it
would be nice to have some really versatile microbes that could handle a
variety of basic biochemistries, but if you had to tailor-make a batch for
each world, that would still be easier (it seems) than fighting the local
eco-system. 

If you can develop the broad-spectrum variety, then these would be taken
by travellers as a matter of course.  I picture them being "imperfect" in
their treatment of various biochemistries, so that you can digest a broad
range of things, but you might get cramps, sugar rushes (as all the carbs
get busted into simple sugars), or other problems ("Oh man, who let
fly!?" "Sorry, it\'s the Zhdaqiatz beans again, I love them but they don\'t
love me...").

If only the world-specific variety are available, they would probably be
sold at the starport to incoming tourists (assuming you want tourists),
and there might be biological specialty dealing with the design of such
things.

Of course none of this is canon as there have been several references to
restaurants with menus guiding tourists away from indigestible foods and
so on (the latest in G:T Aliens 1), but it doesn\'t exactly break the
universe either.

The other issue that makes massed missile use difficult in G:T is use of
nuclear missiles in a point defense role.
**************
for military ships, yes.  hard to factor it in though.

I believe that a single large nuke will force low-armour missiles to
disperse, which means fewer missiles for the point-defense missiles to deal
with at one time.
*************
perhaps a bonuse +2 to +4 for dispersion? with a possible kill on all of
them if you don\'t dispers?


The other issue is that G:T standard lasers are not optimised for use
against lasers. Could someone with the appropriate Gurps supplement please
design a Gurps equivalent to the Famile Spofulam \'Signature\' class point
defense laser ?

Against missiles?  Hal has some on his page I belive, howeveri havent had a
chance to look at them. remember you want the minimum damage to stop a

I disagree, strongly, for two reasons.

we were talking of an attack when the target ship has *no* warning of the

[snip stuff that everone (in this disucusion at least) agrees with]


The way to fix this is not to make point defence less effective but to
introduce new types of missiles that are harder to shoot down but also do
less damage. The two obvious choices are fragmentation - missiles that
detonate a few hundred or thousand km out into a cloud of submunitions,
only a few of which will hit a (presumably evading) target for moderate
damage - and det-laser for military applications.

Yep, it\'s unrealistic.  Do you want to make missiles MORE deadly?  Can you
present a playable, more realistic, balanced alternative?
**************
I tried, but ending in the same hex has a lot of plusses:
It keeps the velocities down.
missiles need more Gs than the taget, or the target runs rings around them.
there ar no arguments about tbone shots.

an example of an arguement:
it doesn\'t pass through the hex.
it passed through where the ship would have been during that part of the
turn.
did not
did too.
Ad Nausium,

if it has to be in the hex, no room for argument.

Hello Aerron,
  I suspect we should bring this to a private set up before people start
complaining <grin>...
*********
well they seem fairly interested so far :)



>I suspect that part of the reasoning is due to game ballance as well.

Ah yes - the infamous D&D mentality that says "you forget your spells
because we say so - even if it has no bearing on reality".
You and I both know this is a crock of bull.  This means then, that a
missile travelling 60 hexes per turn may *NOT* hit a target that is closer
than 54 hexes (allowing for a SIM-10) or 50 hexes for a SIM-12.
  That would be like saying, that unless a man is exactly 400 yards away
when you fire a bullet that travels 400 yards per second - you can\'t hit.
*********************
that is kind of what I said, but I hope it can be slipped in as an optional
rule, if not, I can live with lower missile velocities (the numbers dont
get quite as big.)

I think a blowthrough rule is in order, set a max limit based on the armor
of the target?

This can also be adapted to ships that are in close formation (ie all in
the same hex).
***************
it would save on a lot of rolling :)




Hmmm - maybe I have been using the missile rules incorrectly.  I have
always assumed that any active attack can be countered by an active
defense.  But the way the rules read - it looks as though the contest of
skills is similar in GURPS terms, to the grapple attack...  <shudder>.  If
this is the case, it muddies up the statistics for how many missiles hit
and how many missiles are actively outmanuevered.
Example of why I hate there being no dodge to missile attacks!!!


Again, it seems to contradict the philosophy of GURPS.  An active attack
can be defended against with an active defense.  The method above removes
any chance of an active defense, and gives an incredible edge to what
amounts to a SPACE version of a TOW anti-tank missile.  Again... if this is
the actual "rule", <speachlessness...>
**************
I take it you think it is bad enough to need changing then? :)




Ok, you are correct.  You may target different turrets per round at
different missiles.
Thus, if you have 60 turrets, and 200 missiles incoming, you are entitled
to target the missiles as you see fit.
Round 1: 200 missiles, (assuming the standard 5% miss ratio) 60 shots, 3
misses.
Round 2: 200-57 missiles with again, 3 misses.
Round 3: 143-57 missiles with standard 3 misses.
round 4:  86-57 missiles with standard 3 missiles
Round 5: 29 missiles with one standard missile.
Round 6: last remaining missile can\'t possibly be missed by ship with 60
gunners gunning for it... right? <grin>
************
well they do get a -10 to skill on round 6....
200 missiles should get few through a 60 turret defense (fireing once per
turret that is).


Skill 14 gunners +14 acc + 9 target computer + 10 Point defense bonus + 5
max non-point defense laser RoF bonus = base 52 - 39 range = 13.
Round 1 to hits are 13 = 84% success rate.
Round 2 to hits are 11 = 63% success rate
Round 3 to hits are  9 = 38% success rate
Round 4 to hits are  7 = 16% success rate
Round 5 to hits are  5 =  5% success rate
This re-evaluates to:
200 incoming:
1) 50 destroyed
2) 38 destroyed
3) 23 destroyed
4) 10 destroyed
5)  3 destroyed
This is only 114 destroyed out of a firing rate of
************
this matchs the numbers I get if you only roll once per turret.

The point defense aspect of HIGH GUARD is implied where if you use lasers
offensively, you can\'t use them defensively.  I will have to double check,
or see if that ruling was a house rule <Grin>.
********************
Please, I think that you shouldn\'t be able to use them twice, but it is not
stated in GT either way(implying useing them twice).






  Like I said, we should actuall create a CA, then do the battle as I had
originally suggested.  Ie, we assume the high speed run, and then do the
200 missiles.  Use the rules as originally written with the "crock of bull"
ruling <grin>, and then the "advanced rules" aspect that you can introduce
in your pending book.
*************
ok, will a 30,000 space TL 12 ship do?

New rules to consider:
Surprise attacks: All surprise attacks deduct a set amount from the Point
defense bonus rated upon the type of crew the ship has on average.  If
Average crew, then the penalty is only X.  If raw or green, the penalty is
total (ie no +10 bonus).  If veteran crew, maybe -6, if crack, -4, and if
elite, -2 (or some such set up).
**********************8
so raw and green +0, Vetran +4, crack +6 and elite +8.
I like that, but think green should get a +2 in a suprise attack (they have
some training in it at least, and dont get lost on the way to the gunner
station :)


I would also like to introduce the concept of what range band you discover
the missiles via sensors before you can fire upon them.  As it now stands -
David Pulver announced after the fact that if you have not detected
missiles until they are in your hex, you automatically detect them IN your
hex.  This does not make rational sense to me.  Since the missiles have
*NO* chance of being detected prior to impact if fired from outside a
ship\'s sensor range, then why do they automatically get detected at a range
of 5,000 miles?
******************8
perhaps a -2 for no detection until the PD phase?


Introduce the concept of a dodge versus an active attack... as stated,
missile fire attacks are too much like a grapple attack with absolutely NO
defense!
***********
that would be nice, how about ramming to hit:
skill + 1/2 rammer size + 1/2 Target size
and target to dodge:
skill/2(or was it /3) - target size (no bonus for accel, if you have more
accel, the rammer already missed.)

Well, exactly what weapons are optimized against missiles depends on the sort
of missiles; since you generally know what angle missiles are going to be shot
at from you can actually armor them fairly seriously, particularly if you allow
ablative armor (I\'ve seen missile designs for a (non-traveller) TL 9 space

   The counter to that is to make a proximity-fused "top attack" =
missile, which purposely flies past the target, bypasses the most =
heavily armored side (like the bow), and explodes against another side =
that isn\'t armored as well.  Of course there\'s no kinetic damage and the =

still like the idea of ablative armor, though.
   I also like the "scatter-pack" missile full of submunitions -- =
another nasty idea.  I remember a sci-fi story I read some time ago =
which featured the use of one to damage one end of a dumbbell-shaped =

Only in G:T, where vectored-thrust ships appear able to accelerate in any
direction (does this entail physically tipping the T-plates or some magic that
lets thrust come out in arbitrary directions?). Otherwise, if thrust always
comes out the back, to evade or even just match targets acceleration you need
to turn a fair amount.

Bah, it depends on G ratios.  You can get half your Gs in sideways manuever by
a 30 degree change in thrust angle; if we assume that the thrusters can be
gimballed by 15 degrees (perfectly reasonable) any hits on side armor will be
against a 75 degree slope, which won\'t be very effective, and those hits will
be rare anyway.  A reasonably designed missile can do 12 Gs without much
effort.

Incidentally, those vector thrust systems increase drive weight by 50%...

Besides, as I mentioned, these were det-laser warheads.  Matching target
acceleration wasn\'t a big concern.

Ok, the problem is this. Our digestive system *normally* breaks
carbohydrates (sugars, starches, and a few other things) down into
simple sugars such as glucose. The enzymes involved may or may not work
on the wrong-handed sugars. I *think* they do. 

Likewise, protiens are broken down into their component amino acids.
And I am pretty sure that this will happen regardless of handedness.

So you\'ve got all these sugars and amino acids floating around in the
digestive tract. First problem is keeping the wrong ones from getting
into the blood-stream. And that *alone* is next to impossible. 

Next, you have the problem that changing the handedness requires
breaking down the compound and rebuilding it. *Completely*. Breaking
them down will release energy, but it takes that much energy *plus*
some extra to rebuild them the other way. 

Bacteria are *not* going to do that except to build their own tissues.
Which means they are getting the energy and raw materials, not you. 

The stuff that intestinal flora *do* help digest are *complex*
chemicals that our digestive system can\'t handle. The bacteria get some
energy by (for example) breaking cellulose down into starches and
sugars. The "waste" starches and sugars can then be processed by normal
digestion.

But when the problem is the *simple* sugars and the amino acids, you
are dealing with stuff that\'s *already* been broken down as far as you
can without winding up with inorganic chemicals. Plants and bacteria
can deal with stuff at that level, animals can\'t. 

And, as I noted, the bacteria dealing with it wouldn\'t leave any
*usable* waste.

To use bacteria to process native foods, you\'d have to do it
*externally*, and then eat the bacteria. For example, you might be able
to use yeasts to ferment the "wrong" sugars into alcohol. Or to convert
them into lipids (fats and oils) which tend to *not* have handedness.

Sheesh. How hard is it to realize that turning on computers etc gives
at least a *bit* more assurance that they aren\'t a dummy unit stuffed

TNE "World Tamer\'s Guide" has a table for atmospheric taint, but
I don\'t like it.  There are good chemical reasons for considering
a combination of "Low oxygen" and "high carbon dioxide" to be much
the most common atmospheric taint.

I\'m pretty much aware of life support, water, etc being recyclable.  Think I
even caught the discussion of this the last time or two it\'s come up (in
reference to costs IIRC).

> Food recycling requires a fair amount of space for plants and "animals"

It\'s precisely that which I think should have a high tech alternative.
Fauxflesh Vats are perfect way around this.   At least one vat for meat, then
have another vat that instead of meat, spits out a vegetable, etc.    Next up,
i\'d think cloning.  We know at Traveller TL13 cloning of small organs is
viable in pretty quick periods.  The details would be the hum dinger.  Are
there any other possible high tech alternatives to actually carrying food
storage, etc?

Only in G:T, where vectored-thrust ships appear able to accelerate in any
direction (does this entail physically tipping the T-plates or some magic that
lets thrust come out in arbitrary directions?). Otherwise, if thrust always
comes out the back, to evade or even just match targets acceleration you need
to turn a fair amount.

Bruce


   Do all GURPS Traveller spacecraft have vectored thrust installed?  If =
so, where is the reference?  I haven\'t seen this rule, but then again I =
haven\'t systematically read the entire book.  This question is important =
for aiming fixed-mount direct-fire weapons compared with the direction =
of acceleration.

Any mention of _neutrino_ scanners such as might be installed in

Why do you say "AND" a bomb?  It\'s 2 pistols

brokers, to which I sent the following post.  I\'m reposting it here,
(with slight editing to make it clearer) thinking it might be of
some interest to the group.

                  ================================

This was the post that lead up to it...

[Shawn, our PC with merchant skills and a cargo to sell, is new to
Mark and Bernie, the NPC ship captain of the ship Shawn came in on,
are talking.  Bernie has offered to introduce Shawn to a couple of
local import/export merchants and they are walking into startown
from the back gate of the starport.]

>> Brokerage and the Ollis Import/Export Company.  B & M are

>> isn\'t." said Bernie dodging across the busy street.

>"Hmm." says Shawn.

>> "Don\'t get me wrong, Ollis is sound and a fair trader, but he\'s

>> "You get my meaning?" Bernie asks.

>"B & M are the folks to see for your standard cargos and Ollis is 
>the man for the more unusual stuff." replies Shawn.

"...and cargos that are more risky, but *potentially* more
profitable." Bernie nods.

                  ================================

Then the player of Shawn asks...

>OOC: One question, I intend to use my broker skill. We are going to
>see brokers. How the heck is that going to work?

...and my reply...

What makes you think the brokers you are going to see will be working
for you? <grin>

                   =============================
  
Relevant Skills

Trader -- The ability to evaluate how well a potential cargo would
sell at another location.  Part of this skill is experience with and
knowledge of other systems, and part of it is an innate feel for a
cargo\'s value and profitability.  The Trader skill helps you decide
how much you are willing to pay for something, and how much you
expect to sell it for, somewhere else.  Research and Perception are
associated with the Trader skill

Broker -- The ability to get the best price for a cargo as (or for)
either the buyer or seller.  Fast Talk, Liasion, Streetwise and
Bargaining are associated with the Broker skill.

A licensed broker acts as an agent for a buyer or seller to insure
that the exchange of properties is fairly done, and by the laws of
most governments must really do so.  OTOH, the actual buyer and
seller aren\'t under the same obligation to be fair, and the broker
*is* representing *their* client\'s view of the property\'s value.
So, let both buyer and seller beware!

If you *hire* a licensed broker to help arrange for the purchase or
sale of a cargo you should expect them to try to get you a "fair"
price.  The buyer or seller don\'t have to agree a what a fair price
is, and the broker they hire will be working to get their client
their price.  They just can\'t cheat to do it...legally.

                   =============================

You probably won\'t be hiring a licensed broker at B&M or the Ollis
Import/Export Company...although you might.  If you hire one of them
to sell your cargo, they will try to find a buyer for your cargo and
try to get you, the seller, a good price.

What you\'ll most likely do is offer to sell your cargo to one of
them..or to clients they represent.  In that case, they will try to
get the buyer, not you, a good price.

When it comes to buying a cargo, they are going to offer you cargos
that they own or that are owned by clients they represent.  They\'ll
be looking to make a profit from the transaction.  However, to stay
in business they want to encourage repeat customers so most might
not try to skin you off *too* badly.  OTOH, some will!  They\'ll
work under the philosophy that "if a lamb comes trading it is asking
to be skinned" and it\'s better for them to do it and get the lamb
out of the game.

If you don\'t have Broker skill, or have a low skill, you might want
to seek out a licensed broker to represent you in negotiations. Your
broker and the other side\'s broker will fight out a contest of
Broker skills.

If you represent yourself, you will in a contest of Broker skills
with the merchant you\'re dealing with. 

I prefer roleplaying to roll-playing, so your encounters with
brokers, merchants, and manufacturers should be played out...at least
a little.  The rolling will take place in the background, and (I\'ll
admit it) will be modified by how you play out the encounters.

Does that help?

"So, who do you want to talk to first?" asks Lira, "B&M or Ollis?"

                  ================================

The one thing I didn\'t add in my description of the Trade skill was
that a good trader has to be a good researcher, constantly on the
look out for information about the conditions in systems that they
might trade in.  Incidental tidbits of data about weather
conditions, labor unrest, government stability, technological levels
and changes, and even fads and fashions can be the difference
between a profitable and an unprofitable trade.

I hope some of you find the above useful.

Speaking as an old Klingon/Orion SFB player, the key to defending against a
massed missile attack is defense in depth.

You want to target big armoured missiles with small missiles, leaving the
smaller, more vulnerable missiles for your weapons to deal with.

The tactic of putting an escort or fighter wing out front works as well, so
it can get shots at the wave as it goes past (although this is to some
extent an artifact of the fact you cant retarget drones in SFB).

I prefer to have a longer engagement time - I want the capability to keep
pouring fire at the inbounds.

Incidentally, Ditzie wants to know if you can get that rechargable battery
pack as a man-portable backpack.

Also, she is asking about the theoretical RoF of the standard GT 10 360 MJ
civilian laser, because it looks to take a 50 lb/$5000 battery pack to
power one shot, and there are a lot of people out there who feel a need to
have More Firepower.

I really should have said \'to defend a point\', not \'point defense\'. The
idea is to meet the missile wave at some distance, then detonate, as
missiles tend not to mount big nuke dampers.

Sounds fair. Make em choose between being vulnerable to counter-drone work,
or being vulnerable to point defense.

Dont forget combustion lasers - a small laser warhead with a 1000 km or so
range, that doesnt work by nuclear detonation.

You could also use a fusion gun.

This is almost impossible to pull off with Newtonian movement, unless you
have a tail-mounted one-shot laser or similar.

You are also vulnerable to fire as you pass around the target.

I havent forgotten them, it\'s just that a 20mm AC has an effective range of

I really need a life.

Assuming you use a small pistol, like one of the compact Glocks, you could
conceivably fit two pistols and a small amount of explosives (enough to
breach the window) inside a largish laptop.  Given the size of the recent
models, I don\'t think that you\'d be able to do more in each laptop than
smuggle in a disassembled gun or about .5kg of explosives in each.

significant being the ability to Load sector files.

To coincide with the release of WBD2 I am releasing Sector Generator V3.
This will generate full Sectors and allow you to save them in a format that

plan radical changes to the interface and display code.

Both programs can be downloaded from my website detailed below. (Why not

Why not; I was trained to shoot with either my dominant or weak hand. As for
shooting with both weapons at the same time it\'s awkward, but possible. My old
department was very conservative and plagued with politics that ensured that
we would old use .38 caliber (app. 9mm) revolvers. Six shots was considered
kind of tactically limiting, especially as we weren\'t allowed to use
speedloaders until \'86. We were allowed to use our off duty revolvers (small 5
or 6 shot weapons equiv to a body or snub pistol in size) as a back up weapon
(as long as it wasn\'t visible to the public). Thus everybody quickly came to
the conclusion that the quickest reload was a second weapon... I carried my
second weapon so I could grab it with either hand (ie under my uniform jacket
in a shoulder holster). At the range I tried firing both weapons with both
hands. I found it difficult, unless I fired one weapon at a time (looked at
the target and fired with one weapon, and then did the same with the other
weapon in my other hand). I never shot either weapon as accurately as I would
firing one weapon with both hands.

Ob Traveller: After this long winded story; I would only allow characters who
are truely ambidextous to fire two hanguns simultaneously without penalty. I
would allow a character who has handgun skill to do this, but at a minus one
skill level. Thus handun 2 would roll to hit as handgun 1, and I wouldn\'t
allow a handgun 1 player to do this at all...

Heinlein wrote a *LOT* of nifty things.  Most of his ideas were new at the

reading his stuff.  And I kinda miss the Admiral...

Basically, nothing. It\'s a shaped charge, explosions follow the path of
least resistance.
If you put a bundle of dynamite beside a wall and set it off, what would you
get?
A loud bang and some loose paintwork from the concussion.
If you put the same bundle beside the wall but with some other stuff to
point the blast in a particular direction (ie a shaped charge) then you
would get a hole, a loud bang, and loose paintwork.

The armour on an APC is designed to stop/slow bullets, a loud bang isn\'t
going to affect it at all.

Since hours my be individual to a given planet, so you might want to use
hours. A day is a day on any planet. For, the definition of a day is one
complete rotation of a planet. But, the duration of that rotation may differ
between planets.

As a biochemist, i know they don\'t, because enzymes have already a defined handedness (every amino acid is left handed...except some rare
microorganisms, although they only can produce one aminoacid or two from both handedness) that limits they\'re function to one handedness
only.

No, again because proteins are broken down thanks to the action of other
proteins (proteinases) which are already handed (left handed), as
above with sugars.

It\'s not impossible, as sugars have to pass through the intestinal cell to get
the blood vessels behind, they can\'t pass between the cells
cause they\'ve got tight junctions, which are hermetic.

Again, here in Earth it is not that way in any life being that have such
capability (some rare microorganisms, only)...

They have an enzyme capable of changing the handedness of the aminoacid (i\'ve
not heard of such enzymes for sugars, but it may well be that they also exist)
without breaking it down and having to rebuild it. And it only requires the
action of one enzyme (rebuilding it is a long process with many enzymes
implied).

Not any human intestinal bacteria i know of is capable of breaking cellulose into sugars (but several of them in nature can), and, i\'m
sure that no bacteria can break down cellulose into starch, as they\'re both different polymers with different functions in plants (and
natural bacteria can sure break them down, but it has no sense to break cellulose down and then build starch from the glucose you get...)

Both cellulose and starch are made of glucose blocks, so i agree that natural bacterias can break them down to get glucose.

Again i disagree, usually bacteria export those degradating enzymes outside, as they are not capable of importing those polymers inside
(too big), and those enzymes (included enzymes that change the handedness of aminoacids) function outside the microbial cell...so the
products of the chemical reaction catalized for them can be used by anyone around (our intestinal cells also), they leave the products
outside, and then the microorganism uptakes them.

> To use bacteria to process native foods, you\'d have to do it

Or you can eat the bacteria and then eat the product...but i agree with you, those bacteria would have not evolved to be into our
intestine and sure they won\'t survive...o worse, they may be to good inside our intestine and displace our flora and maybe be
pathogenic...

If i\'d have to do it, i\'ll make those bacteria pre-process the food, and then (instead of eating them,  as it has proven they have
HORRIBLE taste...in some research programs to solve the hunger of the world twenty years ago, with eadible microorganism biomass) i would
eat the medium in which they have grown (because it sure has the ezymes acting on the products)...

equally unusual results.  If 40 tons of a 200 ton ship are lost from
streamlining, then it actually makes excellent sense for a Free Trader to
be unstreamlined.  Add in a 40 ton fuel skimming vessel, and you can even
use the fuel tank on the vessel as part of your jump fuel and get jump 2
(or at worse a 2nd jump 1).  

You can even design a TL 12 (Gurps TL) 50 ton Modular Cutter which can
carry a 20 ton fuel module and 10 tons of cargo.  If your unstreamlined
ship carrys cargo in 10 ton detachable pods off-loading is simple
(assuming you can\'t just dock and off-load at the High Port) and you keep
the same 69 ton cargo capacity and give yourself jump 2.  Given the extra
flexibility of having a vessel like a modular cutter along, and the extra
jump capacity I can\'t see why any merchant ships *would* be streamlined. 

Personally, I think the whole ship design system would make rather more
sense if streamlining reduced volume by 10% rather than 20%.  It\'s still
clearly a sacrifice, but not a *huge* one.

There have been one or two attempts.  I have a cassette  sold  at
my local game store about 10 years ago:

    Journeys 1 - Pathways, Passages & Beginnings

Can\'t really recommend it though,  just  mentioned  it  here  for

It wouldn\'t be an atmospheric taint in Traveller terms. Tainted thin,
standard, and dense atmospheres per definition contain enough oxygen for
a normal human to breathe, since such tainted atmospheres can be
breathed with nothing more than a filter mask. A low-oxygen atmosphere
would be an exotic atmosphere (in Traveller terms that is).

And, yes, I know that "Behind the Claw" has a number of worlds where the
atmospheric taint is supposedly a low oxygen content. This is IMO a mistake.
YMMV.

It depends entirely on the sound effects CD. If you read the liner notes, it
may tell you that you have the rights to use the stuff. A sound effects set
that I have tells you how to use this stuff in films, movies, and audio
presentations. In this case, the liner notes were clear that the purchase
price of the CD also covered licensing. I have used a couple of the sounds,
in modified form, on a song I did for an internationally released
compilation.

Not entirely true. Deadheads have implicit permission from the band, which
the record company grudgingly puts up with.

Making a copy of an album "for a friend" is not the same thing, and if
caught you would be in trouble. You haven\'t made a profit, but technically
you\'ve stolen profit from the distributor, the record company, and the
artist. That\'s just the sort of thing that the copyright laws protect
against.

Companies tend to look the other way in some situations (like homegrown
mix-tapes sold by DJs) because it\'s free advertising. The cost and trouble
that would go into pursuing these folks isn\'t really worth the effort,
especially since they\'re advertising for the bands.

I\'d prefer to go with standard hours. For gaming purposes in on-

I saw part of a discussion of that a year or two ago, but skimmed
over the cost part of it...NOW I\'m interested. T4 has life
support costs coming out comparable to fuel costs, and that seems
wrong. IMHO Life support is a misnomer and it should be
Housekeeping and maintenance, but it still seems a bit high.

Once again FF&S2 suggests for endurance life support (food
recycling)
a) Low level plant life: yeasts, algae, etc. The "glop" that has
been suggested in previous discussions might go in this category.
b) vats and gardens. Your fauxflesh vats would go in this
category.
c) Small animals.
d) large animals.

All the equipment and technology for recycling food is likely to
require more space, be more expensive to install and maintain, be
much more finicky and give a poorer quality product than carrying
food, up to a certain point. The drawbacks of food recycling
outweigh the disadvantages for periods under a year or so. YMMV.

I\'ve been trying to generate some information on interstellar
trade and planetary economies using the various materials of T4.
I won\'t go so far as to call them broken, but I am a bit puzzled. 
PE gives a formula for generating the GWP of a world, but these
figures turn out to be too low on the one hand and too high on
the other.

On the one hand, turning GWP back into average per-capita income gives
Cr 1200-2000 per year.
Comparing these to T4\'s figures for food and housing costs and
salaries of ship\'s crew and PE\'s definition of a credit, they
seem about a third what I would expect.
On the other hand, if I translate the military Attack and Defense
factors into MCr, I get absurdly high naval sizes and rates of
production. I compared these with what Imperial Squadrons says a
given planet should be able to have, and it comes out to roughly
a tenth what PE gives. I must confess that the IS figures
intuitively feel *much* better.
So, does too low on the one hand and too high on the other work
out to about right?

The laptops I have recently worked on (new ones, yes), there is enough room
to fit small amounts of explosives and still be fully operational. Take
some of the unnessesary stuff out (use dummy removable CD-Rom/floppies) and
get even more bang for the buck.

It may be how Deadheads have operated, but if a copyright owner decides
to go after you, the fact that you didn\'t charge is no defense. And
*minimum* statutory damages start at $100 a copy. 

Record companies generally have *no* tolerance for this sort of thing.

I thought the *simple* sugars (glucose, etc) did pass through. At least
pass through the cell walls both ways.

Ok, I didn\'t know about *that*. I do know that at least one antibiotic
is based around a "wrong-handed" sugar. Which gives reason to suspect
that such are *not* the best thing to have floating around.

True. I knew that *human* intestinal flora can\'t. Cows and termites
have different flora. 

I\'ve also heard that we don\'t *want* such flora as they tend to produce
*way* too much methane in the process. We\'d die of what cattlemen call
"bloat".

Actually, it occurs to me that we might deal with it the way we deal
with lactose intolerance. Mass produce the required enzymes and then
take *those* with the food, and also add the enzyme to commercially
prepared foods.

On the taste issue, I recall reading that the algae considered for life
support systems doesn\'t taste *horrible*, it just doesn\'t taste good.
But there are recipes for it. :-)

So it\'d be a nice touch to have emergency life support gear that
uses algae. It provides good nutrition, and turns CO2 back into oxygen.
But after living off it for a while the crew will be *desperate* for
real food!

Has anyone *tried* to build the Enterprise under *any* version of the
Traveller rules?

For that matter, picture a colony that made it through the Long Night,
but had to rebuild their tech from scratch. The records available were
pretty much all from one *extensive* private library, but there was a
lot of random garbling. Thus, they don\'t realize that it was the
private library of a Star Trek fan who was also a real spacecraft
engineering expert.

In other words, they figure that the stuff that they can\'t make work
was either garbled, or covered in one of the unreadable files. They
think the Trek Universe is *real*, and when they get working ships,
they are going to go out to try to re-establish the Federation!

Heck, more devious GMs could even allow them to have made some
interesting tech advances based on not knowing that it\'s impossible.  

Warp drive and subspace radio wouldn\'t be appropriate. Transporters are
a major can of worms we probably don\'t want to open. But phasers,
antimatter power, photon torpedoes, and maybe even force fields/shields
are all possiblities.

Impulse drive is, of course, merely thruster plates.

I want to see the look on your player\'s faces when you describe the
ship, or when they get "hailed" by a Federation starship, complete with
the silly uniforms.

TNE "World Tamer\'s Guide" has a table for atmospheric taint, but
I don\'t like it.  There are good chemical reasons for considering
a combination of "Low oxygen" and "high carbon dioxide" to be much
the most common atmospheric taint.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
May be the detail for what constitutes a "taint". A "tainted" atmosphere
is one that can be breathed with a filter mask, so it must have a
life-sustaining oxygen content.

A high-CO2 atmosphere under CT might more accurately be considered
and "exotic" atmosphere, if the usual way to breath it is with an
oxygen tank. (I do recall a thread on CO2 scrubbing "filter mask", though).

I\'m well aware of FFS2s rules.  And I\'ve said numerous times in this very
thread that I don\'t consider them adequete for anything beyond TL10.  Maybe
late TL9.  
Fauxflesh vats are a whole order of magnitude better than the algae vats from
FFS2 (which are explicitly said to give out "gruel").   

W/ Fauxflesh Vats (or something similar that gives out vegetable, etc), there
is no need to store the food (refigerate, low berth, whatever).  A "biomass"
is sustained by the ships life support and is continually growing, possibly w/
a small amount of nutrient needed.  It\'s "harvested" when it\'s needed or it
grows too big for its vat, whichever comes first.

I don\'t think so.  Especially after thousands of years of high tech
spacetravel and given the canonical biotech capabilities of the Solomani, for
example.   You might be able to make a good argument for Fauxflesh being
Traveller TL 12+, but it shouldn\'t be all that finicky.   

Fauxflesh Vats are GURPS TL 9, which is a Traveller TL of 9-11.  I think it
should be no higher than Traveller TL 9.  That space is a one time shot and I
think these things are going to be small enough to be included in the costs
for extended life support from the original Fire, Fusion, and Steel (which
stated food was included).

Which version do you prefer (the opening credits, or the "Black Capsule"
version)?

Another song (as opposed to instrumental) used in a war movie, that can
help set a mood:  "We Gotta Get Out of This Place", by The Animals (used
in "Hamburger Hill").

Then again, for a more "optimistic" mood, you could use my Basic
Training platton\'s unofficial theme song:  "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt
Cheap", by AC/DC (works during negotiations for hiring a merc unit...).

That\'s hard to tell, what exactly _does_ a suit leak sound like? The sound we
hear from, for instance, a punctured inner tube is from the air expanding on
the _outside_ of the tube.

Ordinarily, I\'d tweak a recording of something like air escaping from an inner
tube. You could get real sound effect wacko and try to do something like seal
your mic _inside_ the inner tube and let the air leak out.  On second thought,
you could do this with a bicycle tube pretty easily...cut it, seal off both
ends with hose clamps, putting the mic in one end first. Pump it up, put a
hole in the end near the mic and record.

Try this with a fat tire tube, of course, pumped up to high pressure you might
get quite a long leak. Speed it up, slow it down, play with the pitch (IE:
Suck it into a computer somewhere along the line and play with the many, many
sound effects programs available...if you got a sound card with your PC one
probably came with that. On the Mac, try www.digidesign.com, they were selling
a 16 track \'digital audio workstation\' program (Pro Tools 3.4) for the cost of
shipping and handling a while back; sort of a teaser for their serious tools
and upgrades. )

But then, I don\'t _know_ what it sounds like from the inside, only the
outside. For sound effects it may well be more \'realistic\' being
unrealistic...just tape the air coming out of a valve held open.

I can go out and buy a functional 486 system about the size of a credit card,
CPU, Video Printer, serial ports and all. I can get a 1" HDD...doesn\'t have to
hold much, just Windows, or better yet, DOS and a tiny image display program
that just _shows_ the windows start up screens.

Go get an old, bulky, heavy used laptop. I have one...it measures 11.5" x 8.5"
x 1.75" _under_ the keyboard. The _computer_ part can be powered by 4 or so AA
batteries for as long as it needs to be powered, and can probably be shoved
into quite a small space, perhaps even behind the screen. That leaves most of
170 cubic inches to hold nasties. Some of that\'s taken up by the case, true,
so I\'ll be generous and call it 150 cubic inches.

If I go to something like a compact .25 or .22 auto, I could probably get four
of them in there.

Want to be real nasty? Just pack all of the case with C4, and replace the
plastic back of the screen with steel, wedge it between your seat and the side
of the aircraft. That would make it act as a reasonable shaped charge, tamped
anyway, and do horrific damage when detonated.

You could probably even do it right, make it a true shaped charge. Sit on a
wing seat, see what you could do to the plane.

Of course, you go with it, so it\'s definitely a suicide bomber trick.

The computer only has to _appear_ to work...

	A character with at least Pistol-2 can fire one pistol in each hand with a

   I thought that using a cube formula was a bit odd, since it\'s not =
that hard to get a more accurate rectangular box, but it\'s an acceptable =

  There\'s a quite amusing Turtledove short based on this ("Knowing is
Half the Battle..."?) idea; after an apocalyptic WW III a pocket empire
in SoCal (IIRC) eventually evolves a Technology Recovery Corps, who are
thrilled to find the plans for a prototype starship amidst the rubble. By
this time much of the world has been amalgamated, and the resources are
poured into the project as necessary to "complete" it...

[snip]

One interesting possibility, especially for leaks aboard ship, is that a
clear musical tone might result -- anything from a high-pitched reedy
whistle for a small leak in a small compartment, to a thundering bass
organ note for a large gash in a huge compartment.  This would result from
turbulence around the hole setting up standing waves in the chamber --
basically the same way a pipe organ or flute works.  The pitch would rise
and the volume decrease as the compartment evacuated.  Spacers would dread
hearing such a rushing, rising tone.  It\'s similar enough to what a
teakettle does that spacers might jump if someone was boiling water in a
kettle without their being aware of it.  And \'teakettling\' would be likely
spacer slang for the effect:  "I could hear the forward engineering bay
teakettling, so I went through the access tunnel instead..."

Low oxygen atmospheres would require a combination filter-
compressor to concentrate the oxygen in the atmosphere and reduce
the concentration of other gases. The problem is that the variety
of possible or even probable atmospheres cannot be well-reflected
in just one UWP digit. I\'d prefer not to be bound too strictly by the rules
in this case.

We\'re proud to announce that the latest version of Andrew
Moffatt-Vallance\'s Pocket Empires Excel Spreadsheet is now available on the
archive page at BITS website. This software supports users of T4 Book 8 -
Pocket Empires, one of IG\'s releases written by CORE.

http://www.bits.org.uk/

This version has some new features, as described by Andrew below:

<<Pocket Empires Version 1.60
This is a spreadsheet to handle some of the calculations involved in running a
Pocket Empires campaign. The spreadsheet currently:

  -  Calculates the GDP for each world
  -  Calculates Government Income, Fixed Expenses and
     Available Budget for each world
  -  Calculates Popularity and Prestige for each
     individual world
  -  Features a worksheet for calculating the prestige
     of multiworld Empires
  -  Calculates the trade codes for each world
  -  Calculates the initial Resource, Infrastructure and
     Culture scores for each world
  -  Calculates the Resource demand for each world
  -  Calculates the Resource trade benefits for each
     world

The sheet is capable of handling up to 350 worlds (roughly the size of an
average Imperial Sector). To add more worlds just copy and paste the
appropriate lines in the GDP sheet and these will need to be edited manually
(all references to "Constants!" sheet).>>

Well, here\'s how I handle it:

For example, a character is firing two handguns (snap fire) at once. The
"to-hit" task becomes:

	To snap fire a projectile weapon.
	(Skill + Attribute/2) > Difficulty

   I studied real and theoretical planetary atmospheres when
creating my "World Building" and cosmic chemistry posts. It is no
accident that Mars and Venus in our own system, for instance,
have atmospheres high in CO2. On smallish size rocky worlds in
the habitable zone of stars, an atmosphere high in CO2 is likely
to be the rule rather than the exception. (Average world size in
traveller is 5; closer to Mars than Earth)
   If you have liquid water on the world, you can dissolve much
of the CO2 in the form of carbonate minerals. (Earth reportedly has
enough CO2 bound in limestone to make its atmosphere resemble
that of Venus). Nitrogen is the next candidate to dominate the
atmosphere. If you have photosynthesis as well, you can get free
oxygen.
   There is reason to expect CO2-water-Nitrogen-oxygen
environments, but to have atmospheres contain breathable
proportions of these everywhere when world sizes, hydrographic
percentages and atmospheric density vary all over the place
doesn\'t work for me.
      I can a) throw out what little I do understand of planetary
chemistry,  b) make most of my "Tainted" atmospheres class A
exotic, or c) bend the rule about tainted atmospheres requiring
only filter masks to be breathable out of shape. I take the last choice as
the least objectionable. If "filter masks" can scrub CO2, so much the
better.

Gruel-yielding algae vats are Endurance Type V-a. At a minimum,

   Biological systems are complex enough to be subject to the Law
of Unintended Consequences:
   Given a sufficiently complex system, any intervention you
attempt will have at least three effects you did not intend and
at least one of those unpleasant, even if the intervention did
accomplish the intended purpose.
   This law tends to fill the annals of biological engineering
(geneering as a subfield) with examples of "marvelous advances"
that turned rapidly into expensive fiascos.  It also makes me a
bit skeptical about the prospects of such things as fauxflesh
vats, and to want to push them up the TL scale.

	There was a Heinlein book, titled "The Number Of The Beast,"
centered around \'pan-theistic multiperson solipsism\'--if anybody ever
thought up a universe, it existed, and the heroes were travelling
around through a variety of them.

IIRC, there are (in our intestine cells) ways to avoid sugars going backward to the intestine :Simple sugars (monosaccharides) can pass through
cell membranes thanks to proteinic nature transporters, there is one which can tranport glucose and galactose into the cell thanks to energy
provided by ATP hydrolisis (wich is used to transport sodium ions outside, wich enter the cell through the same transporter as glucose and
galactose) ; there is also another transporter that uses facilitated difusion to intake sugars (no energy expended, but must exist inner lower
concentration of fructose, the sugar it transports, to function, and it easily saturates himself, so the other transporter, the energy expense
dependant becomes necessary when just have ate to uptake sugars).

Cells can express different transporters at differents sides of their membranes, so they make sure that sugar transport (which in fact, has

easily saturated at one way as in the other, so sugar leaking isn\'t very important).

You\'re right, they\'re not the best thing to have contact with. Microorganisms are recognized by some of our immunity cells thanks to their cell
wall components, that include non usual left handed sugars (and no one wants to be always ill, and having immune responses due to the diet).

I didn\'t knew. Bloating isn\'t a nice way to die...i thought we didn\'t wanted
those flora due to the social not-well-seen side effect of having
to let those methane go out   :)

It\'s a good idea, sounds better to add the enzyme to comercially prepared foods, as the enzyme gets more time to act (not many enzymes survive
the acidic ph in the stomach) than eating some enzyme units at the same time than the food.

IIRC my industrial microbiology prof. said algae didn\'t succeeded as an eadible product to solve the hunger of the world (being produced at
large scale) due to the technical problems of getting all those microorganisms being illuminated enough for the process being enough optimal to
use. Also it\'s hard to supply them with enough CO2 to make them really productive...

I didn\'t recall any words on their taste...Taste issue was referred to yeasts as a biomass source for human use.

It now comes to my mind a film i saw a long time ago, where some people where launched in a spaceshis with huge domes with plants inside
(trees...) as in Earth they were diseapearing (or something, i don\'t remembar), and then they received instructions to cut the domes off and
lost the trees and one of them went nuts and killed the others to prevent it...

May be he liked their taste :D

        Hi, Erwin!
        In "RealWorld" Canadian Navy operations, we\'ve got three times as
many folk as you need to do a job.  That way one is one watch, one is
sleeping, and one is doing training or planned maintence.  I use this same
idea for Traveller....  I divide the number of engineers required by three,
and that is however many you actually need on watch.  Whoever is on watch
makes the roll.  If it is a less than one number, it means the engines are
sufficiently straight-forward that the Stoker only needs to be physically
there during special events, such as exiting and entering Jump or combat
operations.
        If you still have more than one engineer on, I just decide how
crucial the roll is and let the person with the right level of skill make
the roll...  so, a "do or die" roll will get made by the character with the
highest skill, to reflect they would be ones covering those systems, and a
less crutial roll gets made by a lesser-skilled engineer.
        Having too few engineers in the room when required adds one or two
points (I play CT) of negative DM to the roll.

        Happy Holidays!

But the point is that is just "sits" on the surface of the target, just like
the Claymore.  No one is "tamping" it down...

C4 has a speed of light burn...

As for armor, the man recited a story about a deus and a half, not an APC.
THAT is what *I* was talking about.  Obviously, you need armor piercing
weapons for armor.

>>>the equivalent of 33 cm of hard steel (that\'s DR 924 to you GURPsies out
>>>there, or about AV 16 to you TNEers)?

Am I missing something?  In FFS, 1cc of hard steel has an AV of 2.
So, 33 cm of hard steel armor would produce a 66 AV in TNE.  Still
awfully low, but not the riduculously low figure of 16AV

In GURPS, 1 inch of hard steel is DR 70.  Dividing 70 by 2.54
produces 27.56, rounding to 28 and multiplying by 33 gives you the
DR 924 figure from above.

However, if you include radical sloping on the armor (not
unreasonable for a tank) you get DR 1848, and because both FFS and
GURPS V2 use the same basic philosophies concerning armor values I
think it would be reasonable to double the armor value in TNE terms
to 132 AV.

BTW, has anyone converted the FFS armors into GV2 values?  If 1cm of
hard steel is 2 AV and DR 28, then we might say 1AV = DR14, thus...

Well, remember it\'s a flying tank. ;->

I have GURPS V2 at hand, so let me look...

A 120mm tank cannon is rated at 6d6x30(3), giving an expected value
of 630 (1890 for armor penetration).  A heavy N-PAW is rated at
6dx100 giving an expected value of 2100.  

Both of them compare well with a sloped DR 1848, which our AV 66
tank would have. So, in GURPSian terms it might not be so bad.

	Depends on how the thrusters are oriented, compared to how you want
to land. See the long flamefest I mean discussion about the
orientation of drive relative to the decks. The Kinunir has (IIRC)
4G, oriented parallel to the decks. If you want to land belly down,
you either (a) need a LONG runway, or (b) have CG so you can float
down.

	1) Not all tasks lend themselvse to multiple people working on them.
5 women still can\'t give birth to one infant any faster than one
woman.
	2) On the other hand, any task that *does* lend itself to being
worked on by more than one person can usually be decomposed into a
series of individual tasks.

	Keeping any complex equipment running often requires many people,
each doing a different thing. Beyond that, you might also consider
shift needs. One person can\'t be up and running 24 hours a day. Any
shift lasting longer than 6-8 hours should start requiring some kind
of endurance or concentration rolls.

Good question.

No.

The advantage of contragrav is you get more kilonewtons per everything,
with the limitation of you can only use it in a gravity well.

I think that wrapping the detcord around the tree converts it into a shaped
charge in that the tree can\'t absorb the blast from all sides.
(WWII formula was once around per inch of tree).

My dad (Royal Engineers, WWII, N. Africa & Italy) recounted how they
wanted to put a bridge in but the Germans had left a tank in the way.
It was upside down and boobytrapped with its gun barrel blocking the road.
They wrapped a lot of plastic explosive around the barrel, retired to a
safe distance...and when they came back it was still there.
Finally they used a couple of tow ropes and a tank to pull it to one side.
None of the boobytraps went off.

A properly designed shaped charge would have probably severed the barrel
but they didn\'t have anyone who knew about such things.

OK, I missed that part.  the only Real World example of this sort of thing
I\'ve heard of involved hanging Claymores on the side of M113s in Vietnam, as
a short-range ambush buster.

    'body' => 'The physiology of intestinal absorption of carbohydrates as described by
Guillem Plascencia is largely correct.

Carbohydrate polymers : e.g. starch, cellulose (the latter with
appropriate gut flora) undergo hydrolysis to shorter units (enzymes are
oligo- and disaccharidases) ; these fragments are mostly broken down to
monosaccharides : glucose, galactose, fructose and absorbed.

Absorption of the monosaccharides is predominantly by ATP driven sodium
co-transporters (so one sodium ion is absorbed across the intestinal
lumen with one molecule of glucose, say ; a similar co-transport system
handles amino acids). Diffusion plays a very minor role.

These transporters have different kinetic characteristics. The glucose
transporter has the best Tm (maximum transport coefficient) then the
galactose and the fructose transporter in that order.

Aside : In paediatric practice, the most common cause of diarrhoea in
affluent areas is often fructose overload induced (too much fruit
juice).

Carbohydrates are made up of the D (dextro, \'right handed\' isomers). The
transporters referred to above *can* take the L isomers, but at greatly
reduced affinity.

The stumbling block is at the polymer hydrolysis level. Chains of L
isomer carbohydrates would be virtually impossible for \'Terran normal\'
enzymes to break down.
Problems would stem from the activation of mucosa associated lymphoid
tissue ; these \'left handed\' carbohydrate chains would definitely be
antigenic.

This is assuming conventional linkages between monosaccharides.
The most important monosaccharide units (for human nutrition) are based
on hexagonal or pentagonal ring structures ; the usual bonds are [1,4]
or [1,6] linkages in polymers of these compounds.
The possible permutations of linkages are far bigger than for peptide
(amino acid-amino acid) or purine and pyrimidine (RNA, DNA) bonding.

Brief digression : Aliens with genetic material based on complex
polysaccharides, anyone?

On the subject of feeding the colonists, we\'re done for \'sugars\', now
there\'s proteins, fats, trace elements and cofactors (\'vitamins\') to
deal with....

Hostile biospheres will be a bear to tame.
It may be easier to torch (fusion? incineration?) the biomass and start
again.

Season One or Season Two? They\'re different.
The new one\'s not too bad as it\'s adapted from the season 2 titles.

BTW: Does anyone know of a program which allows to fade in/fade out or mix

A wonderful song. I\'ve got it on a single.
For Roleplaying I\'d prefer soundtracks, but got some problems to follow
the game mastering while fiddling with the CDs ... 

There\'s another song I\'d like to use for this, as I did for a magic show

"Silent Running", starring Bruce Dern as \'gasp\' the crazy guy (wotta
stretch!:), Directed (iirc) by Douglas Trumbull, sfx director on 2001.

Saw the dome model at an SF con a long time ago where Trumbull was a GOH, he
tried to get the whole ship, but by the time filiming ended only one of the
domes was left. Quite a neat model, little tiny robots in it and all.

Used to have the soundtrack on tape. In fact, parts of it would make good bg
music...

And no, there\'s a scene where he \'buries\' his crewmates in space. He was
living off the land, so to speak.

Well, the Silverberg book is "___<something>___ Highway" I think, \'twas quite

And if you look at them, ALL of Heinleins later novels are set in the same

My knee-jerk answer is "Yes, it should be a cooperative task". There is
the time factor, though. Most of the computer support work I do is done
solo, I simply don\'t have enough hours in the week to do all the tasks
my department needs done. (Though there are problems I consult
with colleagues on.) Freddie the Chief Engineer is busy tracking
down that short in the main fuel treatment pump, Jamie the Drive Hand
has to do the diagnostic on the thruster plates. Too many things on a big
starship for one engineer to do.

Then the GM can be nice and give you an emergency situation. The
power plant has to be brought on-line, *and* the damaged jump drive
has to be repaired, before the enemy ship finds you. More than one
roll to make, not enough task time for one engineer to do both.

Tsk tsk, you\'ve forgotten one of the prime tenets of terrorism:

"There are no innocents."

Simply by living in a country, you support the government of that
country. By not overthrowing your own government, you are party
to and responsible for every action of that government - and therefore
(even if powerless and/or a child) are a legitimate target for retribution
against that government.

Without that philosophy, no one can justify punishing a country by
bombing an airliner full of civilians...or dropping cruise missiles on
a city full of people.

ObTrav: As Dave said, moral dilemmas are a great way to spice up
a Traveller campaign...unless you have the odd fortune of having a set
of players with no moral scruples whatsoever. 

"We torture and maim the guy at the bar until he tells us where the
missing starship is." (soon followed by) "Why is everybody shooting
at us?"

That\'s what I get for teaching D&D players Traveller...<G>

Really? I thought it was a nitrogen/nitrate detector. I would have

using  radiation or what have you.

What I want is the technology to find the one passenger who always
checks his baggage but never gets on the plane, causing huge gate
delays. I would personally swap late-passenger-checking technology for
bomb-finding technology any day (hey, if your plane blows up you have an
excuse for being late)

ObTrav: The player\'s tramp merchant loads a high passenger\'s 4dt of
cargo into various nooks and crannies of the ship and then he doesn\'t
show up to board... what to do?

Interesting movie.

IIRC, the crew was ordered to dispose of the bio-pods - the project was
being cancelled due to budget cuts, maybe no one thought Earth
would ever be in good enough shape to have wild ecosystems again.
They were going to eject and self-destruct the bio-pods. Bruce Dern\'s
character ejected a pod while two crewmates were still in it (boom!),
and offed another one (two?) with a shovel. He buried the ones he
killed with a shovel in one of the bio-pods.

        I have discovered it depends on two things:  How the GM spin doctors
the intial briefing, and how big the pile of credits is vs the type of
characters being played.  In one scenario I ran, the players were hired to
function as elite counter insurgency troops against a native uprising that
had killed, or more usually, horribly maimed, hundreds over the past two years.
        I provided the group with Library data indicating the types and
extents of the attrocoites, how the rebels specifically went after civillian
targets, etc, etc. and had the local governement offer them a Dream Ticket
for their Merc Company.  So, about three months of insurection quashing
later, with the players riding high on the morality horse, defending the
down-trodden, etc, they ambushed a Rebel unit about to wipe out a village.
        One of the "Rebels" was carrying a government Regular Forces ID
card.  They\'d been had.  Badly.
        They geeked the government within a month for *free*.

        It all depends on how you layout the scenario, and how mercenary the
characters are.  Even Han Solo threw his hat into a fight that wasn\'t
his,...  =)

I thought about that, but I don\'t like that idea because the rules (CT, MT,
whatever) which define crew requirements never make any mention of shift work.
Assuming a 24 hour day, you\'d always need two or three of every crew position
then. The fact that _small_ starships never need more than one or two engineers,
one or two bridge crew, etc., seems to indicate that 24-hour coverage isn\'t
needed.

YMMV, of course.

It\'s called "Silent Running". The shipboard trees were the last
the Earth had and were placed in space as a "preserve". Someone
decided Earth no longer needed them and gave the thumbs-up to
destroy them (the moron!)

An *excellent* movie with novel uses of robots. Someone put
quite a bit of thought into it (equal to 2001: A Space
Odessey in visual background). It\'s definitely worth renting if
it can still be found.

As a matter of fact, I\'d say this one is worth owning.

This brings to mind (well to my mind, at least) the thought that the xboat
network is hardly as monolithic and unchangeable as some might suggest as a
handwave to explain it\'s irrationality.

[Of course, these are the result of a contiunity errors and/or changes of
thinking on the part of the various authors, but ...]

The claim that the xboat network made sense when it was established and
just didn\'t change due to geopolitical inertia doesn\'t jive with all the
changes noted above.

Woo hoo!!!

Depends how you lay it out. There are several choices for a spacecraft
to be able to take off:

1: Contra-grav with thrust > local gravity
   & streamlined (any level)

2: T-plates with thrust > local gravity 
   & vertical deck orientation (decks perpendicular to thrust)

3: (Contra-grav) *or* (T-plates) with thrust > ~0.5*local gravity
   & hypersonic airframe streamlining
   & a runway

1. is a standard traveller ship like a type-S; takes off vertically and 
then flies forward
2. is a tail-lander like the Broadsword or AHL or (real-world) DC-X; it\'s a
mild nuisance to unload a lot of cargo off it compared to a through-deck
design like most type (1) merchants

3. takes off and lands like an aircraft

Slope is probably already included in AV -- so yes, it\'s DR 924.  Which is,
incidentally, absurdly low (for comparison, frontal armor on a M-1 equivalent
tank in GVE is rated at DR 1,680...).

GURPS armor is rated in DR per pound-sf, not DR per inch (i.e. rated based on
weight, not based on thickness).  We\'ll ignore that for construction materials
rather than building materials, though.  I don\'t remember exact densities for
all the armors, but basically it is 0.15 * (density/toughness)

Well, the best GTL-12 armors are rated at 0.15 lb/sf (and incredibly
expensive), the standard armor used on spaceships is rated at 0.4 lb/sf.  I\'ve
always been somewhat unimpressed by traveller armor, weight for weight it
barely improves from TL 8 to TL 13.

Nah.  There\'s a reason for the 20% streamlining penalty, and (as far as
_storage_ volume goes) it isn\'t unreasonable.  What they should have done is
made the \'volume\' for streamlining only apply for purposes of computing surface
are and docking the ship (thus, a 200 T SL hull would count as 250 T if you
tried to put it in a spacedock, and also counts as 250 T for purposes of
computing surface area).

Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the skys
Air defenses were up, with electronic eyes.
Combat pilots were nestled in ready-room beds
As enemy silhouettes danced in their heads.

Every jet on the apron, each SAM in its tube
Was triply-redundant linked to the Blue Cube,
And ElInt and AWACS gave coverage so dense
That nothing that flew could slip through our defense.

When out of the klaxon arose such a clatter
I turned to the screen to see what was the matter;
I dialed up the gain and then quick as a flash
Fine-adjusted the filters to damp out the hash.

And there found the source of the warning we\'d heeded:
An incoming blip, by eight escorts preceded.
"Alert status red!" went the word down the wire,
As we gave every system the codes that meant "FIRE"!
On Aegis!  Up Patriot, Phalanx and Hawk!
And scramble our fighters -- let\'s send the whole flock!
Launch decoys and missiles!  Use chaff by the yard!
Get the kitchen sink up!  Call the National Guard!

They turned toward the target, moved toward it, converged.
Then the tracks on the radar all finally merged,
And the sky was lit up with a demonic light
As the foe met his fate in the high arctic night.

So we sent out some recon to look for debris,
Yet all that they found, both on land and on sea
Were some toys, a red hat, a charred left leather boot,
Broken sleighbells, white hair, and a deer\'s parachute.

Now it isn\'t quite Christmas, with Saint Nick shot down.
There are unhappy kids in each village and town.
For the Spirit of Christmas can\'t hope to evade
All the web of defenses we\'ve carefully made.

For look how the gadgets we use to protect us
In other ways alter, transform and affect us.
They keep us from things that make life more worth living
Like love for each other, and thoughts of just giving.

But a crash program\'s on:  Working hard, night and day,
All the elves are constructing a radar-proof sleigh.
So let\'s wait for next Christmas, in cheer and in health,
For the future has hope:  Santa\'s coming by stealth!


Happy Holidays!

My take is, it depends.

If the starship has an airframe configuration, then no - the thrusters
will get it moving fast enough to take off horizontally; and then it can
point the nose up and thrust down. Away we go.

If the starship sits on it\'s tail, then no. We had the huge parallel /
perpendicular decks argument a while back, and this was one of the
points - if the ship lands with its thrusters pointing at the ground, it
doesn\'t need CG to take off again. Just fire up the thrusters.

If the ship doesn\'t fit into either of the above, then yes - it can\'t
use it\'s thrust to take off, since it\'s pointing in the wrong direction.
(Unless you want to have some huge tilting mechanism at the starport).

Be careful: A large, dense planet (say, size A but denser than Earth)
could have 2G of surface grav, making taking off in a 2G ship - awkward.

I did see the post.  Jan 15\'s a wee bit tight, but I might talk to him.

I\'ve done deckplans for my own ships.  The most recent is my Acipter Class
Armored Merchant that I designed with Andy Akins\' spreadsheet (I always
detested <and nearly flunked> math in school).  If you\'re interested I\'ll
send you a zip file with the spread sheet and .jpg deckplans.

Whoa!

It probably wouldn\'t take long to empty a pair of human lungs in the vacuum.

Just think of how quickly helium is released when you inhale a baloon and
start talking.

The lung/vacuum pressure ration would obviously be much greater in space
than at a frat house party.

Hmmm, but the terrorists ought to understand that it is pretty much
impossible to carry off a coup in *this* country.  We don\'t necessarily like
what our country is doing, but that doesn\'t mean our government(those who
have; the powers that be) is going to truly reform.

The closest this country came to a coup in recent years was shortly before
the Oklahoma City bombing.  All of the patriot and militia groups were
called to show up, at arms, in D.C. in the fall of the previous year, if my
memory serves me well.  This call had been extended by self-appointed
General Linda Thompson, a real crackpot.

I don\'t remember hearing that anyone had shown up or that a firm date had
been set.

What the whole stunt *did* do, however, was allow the Feds to compile a list
of "true believers."  You can bet they are keeping tabs on the dangerous
ones, to this day.

And if you were in the military flying your squadron\'s AH-64A Apache
anti-tank helicopter and you were under orders to fire on a parade of
redneck militiamen, you\'re gonna obey orders or see your hiney in the Ft.
Leavenworth.

An Apache vs. a bolt-action rifle is a fine example of overkill.

A peasant COULDN\'T carry out a coup in this country or even successfully
organize one unless the government permitted it because it served their
purposes.

I like the idea, as polysaccharides are more soluble on water than nitrogenated bases, so in the beggining there would be greater amount of them
available...but , making the question into the other way : why if there were more polysaccharides available were nitrogenated bases chosen?

Some say because they are more stable, (given that there aren\'t enzymes around, sugars can react with amino groups to form Schiff bases in a
non-enzymatic reaction, so sugars would be a not very reliable information carriers... IIRC this may be a problem in diabetic patients, which have
a form of haemoglobin covalently joined to glucose, that can be used as an analitical measure).

So, even if nitrogenated bases are not the best, they are more stable than sugars (or they seem to). That could be a point to have in mind.

I agree!  I just bought a copy of it on LaserDisc from Ken Cranes
Video Online (http://kencranes.com).  The soundtrack is also available
on CD.  Joan Baez does all the vocals for the movie.  Of note is
that "Doctor" Peter Schickele (of "PDQ Bach" fame) composed and
directed all of the orchestral pieces for the soundtrack and it
is very stirring.

Doug Trumble (SFX director for "2001") directed this film with
no prior experience.  He likened it to OJT (On-The-Job-Training.)
To keep costs down, Trumbull hired college students for modelmaking
and other such special effects work. One of them was a young man
named John Dykstra, who, as some of you might know, went on to bigger
and better things (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi,
et.al.)

Cliff Potts (Wolf), Ron Rifkin (Barker), and Jesse Vint (Keenan),
played Bruce Dern\'s (Freeman Lowell) crewmates aboard the American
Airways Orbital Freighter "Valley Forge".  This ship, along with
sister ships "Sequoia" and "Berkshire", carry the entire remaining
biosphere for the industrialized-to-death planet earth.   Each
ship carries six "bio-domes", each of which contained a different
environmental base (tundra, desert, jungle, alpine forest, etc.)

Of all the crewmembers on all three ships, Lowell is considered
the "crazy old man", having voluntarily re-uped four times, and
thus having spent eight *years* aboard the Valley Forge.  Only he
truly cares about the forests.  The others simply think of them
as "cargo".  When the recall order comes, ordering the the crews
of the three ships to jettison and destruct the domes, and return
the ships to commercial service, Lowell rebels, and embarks on
an insane one-man crusade to save the forests.

This is a "must-see" movie for all tru SF entusiasts.

EXCELLENT idea.  There should definitely be blowthrough rules.
How about this: Divide the damage into increments equal to 50% of the
target\'s total HP.  The first increment does full damage, 1/2 for the
second, 1/4 for the third, 1/8 for the fourth, et cetera.  (this
essentially makes destroying the ship wholesale an asymptotic limit)

I was thinking more about huge bulk freighters, huge holds, and little

30,000 DP.

>did not

>Ad Nausium,
  I submit a very very easy method for determining of a missile can impact
on a ship or not.  First, I need to define the following terms:
Mandatory vector: this is the built up vector that a ship has that is the
result of both previous velocity plus current accelleration in the
direction consistant with it\'s last turn\'s movement.  Thus, if you moved 10
forward and 6 upper right - the velocity is 16.  And the movement from
previously last position is 10 up, 6 right.
Previous position: this is the position the ship ended at the previous
turn.  This is a counter that is left on the board.  Ideally, what should
be used are three counters for a ship and/or missile.  A) last position.
B) current position  C) mandatory vector postion in the future if the ship
does not accelerate or change it\'s vector in any manner.
Final position Triangle.  This is the triangle formed by any vehicle made
by the Mandatory Vector in the future position, the last position, and the
new position created by means of using the vehicle\'s acceleration.
HOW TO DETERMINE A MISSILE COLLISION:
  During movement phase, the ships get to move first.  Then the missiles
get to move.  The missile must move to the mandatory vector postion (since
an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside
force).  The player/pilot of that missile then "corrects" where the final
position of movement would be had the "outside force" in the form of
acceleration been applied during flight.
Impact determination: if at any time, the triangle created by the three
points of:
A) previous position
B) mandatory vector position
C) true ending position
Includes the target ship inside it\'s boundries - that ship has been
impacted upon at the velocity value of the missile at the time of it\'s last
position.
In other words, a missile that has a velocity of 72, plus a vector of 70
forward and 2 front left at it\'s last position, and it is able to impact
upon a ship the following turn - the velocity value is 72 (not 72 + the
acceleration value of the missile).
Remember - the mandatory vector is created by looking at the relationship
between a ship\'s previous position and it\'s final position after the
movement turn is done.  So, while this addes a litle bit extra in a step,
it remains true to inertial physics as we know it, removes any chance of
argument...
Player: "It could not have hit me"
GM    : "hmmm, you are inside the area the missile could have hit via
movement right?   Can\'t argue the fact that you are inside the triangle can
you?"
 I respectfully submit that this method will remove all arguements against
permitting realistic velocity impacts save one - game balance.
************
almost....say the missile has a vector of 100 in direction A while the ship
has a vecto of 10 in direction B(with A as up and B as one hexside
clockwise from it.)
the ship ends up 5 hexes in direction A from the missiles starting point.
it will be within the triangle, but no way the missile could have hit it.

so :
Player: "but I didn\'t enter the triangle until the missile was way down
there..."





Missile movement.  Ship is moving 100 hexes per turn, then the missile is
moving 100 hexes per turn.  It is the law of inertia.  If I launch a
missile moving 100 hexes per turn, and the missile can match *any* and all
course changes that it\'s target can make, and maintain a bullseye approach
on target - then the missile hits.  None of this bull about "It must end in
the hex".
************
it we can come up with an unaguable way of determining this, I am all for
it.

My original sugestion was with a triangle of all possible routs the missile
could have taken that must include both the satarting and ending points of
the ship.. I was told it was too cumbersom, and am forced to agree. yours
is a little simple, but still leaves room to argue....it also may be too
complex for play.


Civilian ships carrying weapons of mass destruction: whooooooo boy!  Don\'t
get me started on this one.  I cannot believe that the Imperium would
permit ships to be held by individuals, such that it can kill massive
amounts of people at a time - without warning!  Put a full powered laser in
the hand\'s of a terrorist, and watch how long it takes for the Imperium to
close down civilian ship\'s ability to mount lasers.  Defensive lasers on
the other hand - with a lower ability to do harm, would match both the
needs of the ship to defend itself against enemy missiles, and not permit
it to be a massive potential threat to civilians.
************8
well the lases in GT are defensive lasers...for effective PD you want a
laser that will allways kill a missile.

Um Aerron?  A question if I may.  How are you doing Point defense Phase firings?
The way I do it is this:  Each laser turret can fire only once at the full
effectiveness at a single target per Point Defense Round.  I use "round" in
this context to distinguish between the laser firing once at full
effectiveness, and then for each succeeding "phase" or "turn", at a
successive -2.  Thus, for me, in a Point defense phase, if you have 200
turrets with lasers in them, it makes better book keeping sense to fire
Turrets 1-200 at full power, then turrets 1-200 at -2, then turrets 1-200
at -4, etc.
***********
yes, just the way I do it, exept I allow a missed missile to be retargeted
in the next round.
  If I understand you correctly, are you suggesting that each point defense
turret gets to fire once at *EVERY* target at the full value, then once at
every target at the -2 value, then once at every target at -4, etc?
****************
no, the turret picks one target. if it misses, it can fire again at the
same target at -2 in the next PD round.

Actually, I rather like the original dodge rules.  (Skill + accel - target

As a break from Traveller, I\'ve been running SLA Industries (set in a
galaxy run by SLA Industries, headed by the companies\' more than 900 year
old founder, sort of a cross between Bladerunner, Brazil and Judge Dredd
with a hint of Glasgow (the city)). It is really easy on the ref, as you
give the players missions (not unlike paranoia) which they have to complete
whilst fitting into the Big Picture etc etc.

Anyway, this (after a while) can be a little tedious on the ref (seen one
seek and destroy mission, seen them all). So I decided to set a moral
dilemma - the players were sent to investigate a \'fraudster\' in a downtown
market. Turns out the guy was legit aside from the fact that he ran a
no-interest money lending facility (like the small Credit Unions) for his
fellow downtowners. This broke the law (as only SLA may operate banks etc
IMSIU) but was keeping people away from the banks and absolute poverty.
This was viewed as theft and fraud by SLA.

Anyway, one of the players (an Alien Predator/Samurai clone into Opera)
infiltrated the organisation, using his clan like honour to violate the
lender\'s trust. Anyway, they found out the whole story - but decided that
the Bigger Picture was that this guy was stealing from SLA. This surprised
me as I thought they\'d try and cover things up, but no, they went in like a
SWAT team and killed his entire team, and torched the establishment. And
there was \'collateral damage\'.

They handed his ledger with the loan details back to SLA\'s IRS and knew
that the people on it were set for prison at best. Anyway, I was somewhat
bemused by their interpretation of the Big Picture. And this from a group
who (in Traveller) usually don\'t do anything more dangerous than visit
restaurants.

But the surprise will be theirs soon, as the Even Bigger Picture is that
their Preator friend\'s name is on the list handed to the IRS......

So as ever, even on moral calls don\'t try and predict the player\'s response!

The UK bookstores are not very good. I had to order Heinlein\'s Starship

Cherryh that often. I had to special order _Inheritor_ this weekend! You
get a couple of shelves of the pulp fantasy stuff and very limited SF

I brought this question forward to David Pulver some time back.  His

noticed that the official xboat routes were messy at best, and a problem
at worst.  In that game, the Duke of Glisten (hey, IMTU all hi-tech,
hi-pop systems have at least ONE noble) owned a little thing called
Koranistar Lines.  They used it as a dummy corporation for an independent,
noble controlled xboat service (at j-4) to give them more secure service
than ol\' Sanchocheev would give them...

Let\'s see:
Quar - Jewell - Lysen - Efate - Roup - Regina - Treece - Risek - Rhylanor -
	Cipatwe - Powaza - Mora (a spur from Risek to Aramis)
	[The Zhodani-Regina-Mora route]

Retinae - Thanber - Vilis - Saurus - Lanth - D\'Ganzio - Quiru - Fosey -
	Moran - Mora
	[The Zhodani-Lanth-Mora route]

Karin - Iderati - Flammarion - Caladbolg - Wardn - Lunion - Quiru
	[The Darrian-Sword Worlds route]

Tobia - Our Planet - Empire - Gazulin - Junction - Bleak (all in Trojan
	Reach) - Chamois - Trin - Katarulu - Pallique - Fornice - Mora
	[The Tobia-Trin-Mora route]

Karin - Wonstar - Singer - Collace - Mille Falcs - Glisten - Ffudn -
	Edenelt - Katarulu
	[The Five Sisters-Glisten backup route]
	(this was intended to insure that if the Sword Worlds went to
	war, info would not be cut off)

All of our FFW plans focused around Glisten, Rhylanor, Mora and Trin -
the hi-pop, hi-tech worlds.  Of course, we didn\'t actually have a copy
of the FFW board game, just some JTAS\'s...  So, we (logically?) planned
to only defend in depth pop 8+ worlds with A-B starports and TLs of 9+.
Anything else the Zhodani could waste resources grabbing.

In our game, the PCs became aware of Zhodani war preparations, and 
arranged a visit by an Imperial Fleet (capital elements of the 43rd)
to Thanber just before the Zhodani attack on Jewell began.  It would have
received the info in five weeks (Jewell - Lysen - Tremous Dex - Denotam -
Frenzie - Thanber), but the Zhodani in our game (based on HG+TCS) went
there from Querion (his plans were very much like the Zhodani plans
presented in Spinward Marches Campaign) and they got ripped apart.
The 43rd then jumped to Querion and Sheyou; the lessened pressure on 
Jewell meant our Imperials went on the offensive, seizing Narval (which
was originally Imperial anyway) and from there laying seige to Cipango.

Of course, the lack of an attack across the Abyss meant our Glisten/Trin/
Mora forces needed a victim - can anybody say "What Sword Worlds?"...

When I finally bought Spinward Marches Campaign, I was shocked at the 
gross negligence on Santocheev\'s part - all that industrial might, 
technology superiority and he still fought a defensive war? I\'ve been
wondering what Pocket Empires would give us as far as economic strength...

So, IMTU, Cipango is a neutral world and the Jewell and Querion subsectors
are Zhodani free, and the so-called "Border Worlds Confederation" (as well
as Mjolnir, Gungnir, Enos and Tyrfing, to give the Imperium control over
all jump-1 traffic in the Sword Worlds) is annexed territory given as
fiefs to the successful ship captains of the FFW (it\'s a harsh occupation,
with many incidents as the Sword Worlds discover what "psionic suppression"
really means).

Note that IMTU there\'s a considerable "hawk" group of Spinward Marches
nobility - the Dukes of Tobia and Glisten lead them, while Archduke
Norris (he won the damn war, so we gave him the title in 1111) tries to
keep the moderates in power.  We kept trying to figure out which world
in Foreven sector was colonized by the Imperium in the 500s...  Anyway,
these guys keep the "Zhodani menace" in the TNS headlines in a clever
strategy to force Norris to support a harsher line. 

And the Dukes of Glisten and Tobia were preparing a trip to Capital to
get Strephon to look at a white paper Norris refused to consider:
"The Sixth Frontier War: The Final Psionic Solution".

Stupid Rebellion - we were winning!

In 1104, after the assassination of the Imperial Ambassador, the Dukes
of Glistin, Trin, Tobia, along with the Duke of Regina and the Marquesa
of Mora (I don\'t remember her title, but she was always included because
Mora is the sector capital, and Mora is a hi-pop, tl 15 world) wrote
a nice note to Strephon.  In it, they basically agreed that a new war
with the Zhodani was coming, and that they\'d back each other in writing
Imperial Warrants to take care of things, since the local bureaucracy
was horrible).  Why Norris needed that thing on the Kinunir I never
understood - there were whole stacks of the blanks at the sector capital.
Anyway, as sector duke, Norris was given command of the overall effort,
with the Dukes of Glisten and Tobia (as border dukes) made "Imperial
Marshals" - they couldn\'t be given any existing naval forces, but could
use their local construction as well as militarization of commercial 
shipping.  The Duke of Trin and the Marquesa of Mora (dang - what is
her title?) were given control of the Spinward Marches economic engine,
with Mora the responsibility for communications and Trin responsibility
for new development (Way Stations, etc).

For all intents, IMTU, Santocheev\'s sole command remaining within a few
months of the start of the war was over the Jewell defense, which Norris
insisted he personally take charge of.

Someone asked - what about the Vargr raiders?  Well, we took the Mora 
starting fleet, and sent it to the Thoengling Empire, and used that as
a base to beat the Ekhlle Ksafe (their highest TL is C, according to the
Vargr alien module - what a bunch of wimps), while the Thoenglings 
made some "demonstrations" against the Rukh Aegz.  

The Rukh Aegz are actually dangerous - Saell (1027 Gvurrdon) is a hi-tech,
hi-pop world.  We actually proposed a strike on the system, but never
carried it out due to what we felt were supply issues.  I\'d love to have
had the recent thoughts on supply in HG available during that game...

Excellent idea!  I\'ll definitely be adopting that one.  Streamlining may
make a reasonable portion of the hull unusable as decks, but at least 10%
(and usually) more of any ship is jump fuel tankage, which can be *any*
ship. 

I think your idea solves the problem nicely-

That\'s a misunderstanding of what I was saying.  The \'waste volume\' from
streamlining is in fact _outside of the hull_ -- it cannot be used for fuel or
anything else.  It\'s really only volume in the sense that it probably increases
the volume required to store the vehicle, since docking bays are probably
rectangular.
However, as a jump bubble is probably _not_ rectangular (if it has shape
restrictions, its probably limited to spheroids) reshaping a vehicle for
streamlining, while it increases the volume required to store the vehicle, may
not increase the size of the jump bubble.

Thus, a 200T SL hull has only 160 spaces free -- but you would only have to
install jump drive and fuel sufficient for 160 spaces....

As a big fan of Steve Perry\'s "Matador" series, I have a big interest 
in developing the Martial Arts world within my Traveller milieu.  
However, there are very little references to Martial Arts within the 
Traveller material I have available to me.  What I have seen 
indicates that the Aslan have a style involving their dewclaws, and 
the Vargr practice a brutal art known as Infighting.  GT refers to a 
Martial Artist template.  Little else seems referenced.

Seeing as how many of you have more detailed reference libraries for 
the Traveller milieu than I, I wanted to ask a few questions:

1)  Are there any worlds referenced as being centers for Martial Arts 
study and practice?

2)  Are there any sects or other organizations that teach or deal 
with Martial Arts?

3)  Are there any specific Martial Arts identified in canon material?

4)  Are there any established competitions (ala "Bloodsport" or 
"Hunters of the Red Moon") or Martial Arts sub-cultures (like the 
Musashi Flex from the "Matador" series)?

5)  What are the answers to these four questions IYTU?

Thanks in advance for any info anyone can volunteer.

The problem with this line of argument is that it is fixated on armed
rebellion.  (coups)

A couple of weeks ago I forwarded an OT thing I picked up about Indonesia,
describing million people strong unarmed demonstrations.  That\'s how you
overthrow governments.

If you use helicopters against them, you have three million people on the
streets the next day.  Your ground forces tend to suffer from mixed
loyalties:  "am I a citizen of (relevant country) or a hired thug?" when
faced with "the people".  Even mercs would tend to start worrying about
their pension plan when this kind of stuff happened.

I\'m not saying that repression wouldn\'t be possible - but this is usually
when governments start backing off.

The US militias have equivalents in Australia, so I\'m allowed to be rude
about them.  Basically, these people are stupid Nazis, and it\'s good they
are incompetent.  That, unfortunately, doesn\'t stop them from being
dangerous.

OBTRAV:  IMTU the Ine Givar are divided between over-gunned, under-brained
terrorists, and saner political revolutionaries.  The rebellion on
Dinom/Spinward Marches was led by the latter.  The relations between the
two are hardly amicable, and on occasion lethal, with terrorist cells
occasionally shooting "sellout politicians".  The revolutionaries would
rather the terrorists existed in some other universe....

I heard about a project involving modified E.Coli to turn biomass into
methane. They had to stop and re-think things when someone asked what
would happen if any of the strain got into humans. Apparently it
*would* be able to survive, and the methane production would have been
right up there in the "explosive emissions" levels. 

Makes for a great "plague", but not something you want around.

Illumination and circulation are the big problems. Zero g does make it
somewhat easier to keep a "vat" of microrganisms well mixed. No
tendency for things to "settle".

Alas, you don\'t want to use raw sunlight for illumination, as that gets
you problems with radiation mutating or killing the algae. On planets,
you can use a series of mirrors to bounce the sunlight around a few
corners. The radiation will go right thru lightweight mirrors instead
of bouncing the way light does.

Well, I recall a few articles back in the 60s about the edible algae.
I think you can *still* buy "kits" for growing them from places like
Edmund Scientific.

Since detcord is *linear*, you get the force expanding as a circle
centered on the cord. Now, try visualizing that with the cord formed
into a loop. You get forces *focusing* on the center of the loop,
merely due to the *shape* of the charge. 

A more or less "flat" or "spherical lump" placed against a wall *won\'t*
get any focusing.

> C4 has a speed of light burn...

Hardly. It\'s supersonic, but only a few machs. 

For lightspeed detonation velocity, you need something like
E.E.Smith\'s "duodec". *That* stuff was pure chemical nastiness. Smith
worked at an ordinance factory in the explosives Q & A section during
WWII. So while he *was* having a bit of fun, he also had a good idea as
to what an "ultimate" chemical explosive might be like. 

Another good one he came up with in a story was developed by humanoids
living on very cold worlds (liquid methane temps). It was pure
pentavalent nitrogen, bonded to itself. I think the formula was
something like N17. It was only "stable" at *way* below zero.

Pick up the Mageworlds books by Debra Doyle & James D. MacDonald. There
are 5 of them at the moment. And *large* portions of the plotline are
driven by folks getting revenge. 

Alas, too much of the background is incompatible with Traveller for it
to be swiped, but I\'m sure you\'ll find *something* you can use.

Yes they both use the same multipliers. Moderate ( 30 deg ) = x1.5Radical ( 60 deg

Maybe in the city, but not in the "other" circumstances which make up most
of this country\'s geography.  I was in an Air Cav unit.  Our helicopters
showed us how VERY exposed we could be while on ground patrol.  And...
OH-58\'s are VERY different than AH-64A\'s or a Blackhawk with Doorguns...
Sure, you try to shoot down that chopper with your semi-auto AR-15A2 with
its obligatory 15 round magazine before they zap your arse with their Air
Model 60\'s.

This doesn\'t even get into the fact that a military bird can fly right past
your foxhole in blackout mode and all you would detect is the sound...  Put
on a pair of NVG\'s(where are you going to get the batteries for your NVG\'s
over time?) and you\'d see that your arse was in a flood of light with a
minigun or a 40mm grenade launcher aimed at your gaping mouth.

The only time you are "free" in this country is when you are "free" to do
what you are told.  Just try to go without paying taxes...  You\'re not even
"free" to refrain from paying taxes!  If you want to maintain the illusion
that you are, the IRS will eventually allow you to practice your "freedom"
in a prison cell.

I think you underestimate the dehumanizing effect of putting someone in your
sights when you are basically a trained killer, as all infantry are.  All
that the troops would have to do is get scorched by a couple of molotovs and
they are going to be "scanning their sector."

Follow the money.  WHO is in power in Indonesia?  Are the people who are in
power also subservient to another, higher power, like the UN?  To whom does
the UN kowtow?  What would be their motive in permitting these
demonstrations?

Freedom is something you have when those who govern let out the line.

That\'s a...interesting world you live in Clif.  I would tend to disagree,
but that would make me a \'them\' wouldn\'t it?

Considering the amount of spam I get (be it commercial, MLM, tax scams,
porn, or bible-preaching - I get it all and gnaw on each and every spammer
impartially) I\'d have to say that the Fed is doing a pretty miserable job of
it, especially considering none of the 4+ bills at the Federal level that
will put teeth into my bite (well, only one puts teeth into it - the rest
just let me gum more energetically) have yet to pass.

And I might point out that this list alone puts 50+ messages in my inbox a
day, many of them from people I do not know.  Many with really preposterous
subject lines.  (like Overthrowing Government?  ;)  All of which I should
(but, alas, cannot) review.  Plus I get legitimate business enquiries (I
*do* ethical business on the net) and responses to enquiries I\'ve made via
e-mail.  I takes more than a few seconds to determine if some of the spam I
get is in fact, solicited or not.

So far as the Feds developing netiquette, that is really far out there.
I\'ve watched the TML\'s own version of netiquette develop over the past few
years, and as far as I know we don\'t have any Feds on this list...(looking
around and checking to see if my cover is blown...)

Depends on whether or not I planned to leave anything in it\'s place.
Destroying something is easy.  (Well, financing could be a problem...I
wonder how much in liquid assets Saddam still has available outside Iraq?)

Wrong.  All it takes is passion.  That is a considerable weakness.

This really has nothing to do with traveller, other than to spark some
campaign ideas.  Thank you for playing.

But is any of that email trying to organize a movement to overthrow the
government?  No, and that\'s my point.  With all the wackos out there, not
ONE email message trying to rally people to take arms against the government
has gotten to your inbox?

It\'s like the time I tried to expose the propaganda behind the whole Noam
Friedman story.  He was the Israeli soldier about 2 years ago who allegedly
opened fire into a Palestinian marketplace without cause.  Anyone who saw
the picture of Noam Friedman in the act should have said, "Things that may
you go hmmm..."

I tried to post the QUESTIONS and PROBLEMS of the story and the accompanying
picture on the Usenet and it was deleted so fast my head spun.  And that was
in late \'96 or early \'97...

Yeah and so is the idea that the Feds are going to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs revealing the source of any program meant to influence the
masses.

Oh?  You talk much about overthrowing the government on this list, do you?

You can bet that there is at least one secret squirrel who has made it his
job to familiarize himself with the Traveller subculture.

Sure, passion to get the job done, but they would also have to have no love
for their lives or their loved ones.  Take Political Correctness and all of
the fawning sycophants in Washington.  They don\'t want to do anything to
tick off those with power, you can be sure.  Liberals are some of the best
politicians because they don\'t let scruples or ethics get in the way of
their scramble for power.

        Hi, Jason!
        I just flipped through JTAS #23, and it describes the "Irklansa" of
the highlands of Menorb.  Rough synopis is "Psionic Survialist Samurai Ninja
Monks"....  Interesting culture, and the article specifically cites JTAS
#19\'s article that I mentioned in my previous response to your question.

        Happy Holidays!

        JTAS #19 has a complete section on "Suggestions for Martial Arts
Combat in TRAVELLER", by Bob Liebman.  I thought it was pretty good.

        The above cited article indicates the Geeonee have a native Art
called "Trakaj" for bodyguard work.

        None that I have ever heard of for CT.

        MTU is so far divorced from Cannon it is almost rediculous, in terms
of setting.  I use the CT rules, plus the bits and pieces in the JTAS I have
that I like.
        The Martial Arts article is one of them.  I have misappropriated the
"Blood Sport" style of tournament whole cloth, with and added twist.  The
Terran competetion, still fought in Hong Kong, is only held once every three
years;  only the finest from individual *worlds*, not nations, are invited.
Where deaths in the ring do occur, the Blood Sport competitions are frowned
upon;  in practice, they are not interfered with.

Just a week or two I think.

It was a piece of humor that was sent to me, but I grabbed it as a tagline
instead of feeding it to my humor list.

Methinks you treat the good admiral too harshly.  Think of all the good
he\'s done, providing for the support of widows and orphans.  Admittedly,
the widows and orphans in question are those caused by his incompetent
prosecution of the Fifth Frontier War.... <shrug>  C\'est la guerre.

Sorry to revive a (recently) terminated thread.

A possible solution for \'ruggedising\' vehicles can be created using
FF&S(2).

1. Each point of hull armour value resists two atmospheres pressure,
assuming the material chosen is fluid or vacuum tight.

So a starship with armour 20 can dive to a depth of 400m in water in one
standard gravity, given sufficient structural strength. (This is a
little more than a contemporary military submarine\'s maximum safe dive
depth, IIRC).

2. Structure equal to 1G per atmosphere pressure to be resisted is
required to maintain hull integrity.

Our armour 20 starship needs a 40G rated structure to dive to 400m
(approx 10m water = 1 atmosphere pressure in one gravity).

The structure loading may look a little excessive.

However, if one designs an aircraft by building an airframe like any
other hull (say armour 1, equal to a grav vehicle) and compare this to
the canonical airframe requirements (airframe mass as fraction of
overall vehicle mass), we get average structure equivalents of
1600-1800G for a hypersonic fuselage, 600-700G for supersonic, and
90-120G for subsonic, using TL appropriate materials and an average
craft density of 2 tons/m3.

If an aircraft needs to tolerate this sort of loading, then a spacecraft
which gets tortured like the typical PC (or military) ship needs to be
at least this robust!

Perhaps aircraft airframes need to be lightened up a bit e.g.
Airframe Type     Minimum Structure Rating
Simple            5G
Fast Subsonic     10G
Transonic         20G
Supersonic        30G
Hypersonic        40G
Adv. Hyper        50G

with an upper limit of twice minimum structure.

Canonical references e.g. \'Secret of The Ancients\' need not be
discarded. The fudges above give a more MT/High Guard \'feel\' to heavily
armoured starships.


Constructive criticism welcomed.

probably based on the real-world Assassins, being an aesthetic bunch of

and mental discipline are superior forces to weapons combat.

The article also included guidelines for creating your own martial arts
fighting styles.

I\'ll see if I can look it up tonight.

I also thought there was some reference to martial arts in TNE??

Definitely Silverberg. Certainly not Niven (this was before my Niven phase)
_Flight of the Unicorn_ was the title of a novel by Anne McCaffery too IIRC.

Clif, what you should know is that there is a tradition on the TML of
gentle roasting people who make statements like this (\'but I can\'t tell you

	armored vehicle>

	Perhaps more practical way of using directional mines as 
	self-defense system is to use small self-propelled warheads. 

	Small directional warheads are places on computer controlled 
	launcher tubes on each side of the vehicle. When radar 
	recognizes an incoming missile, the defense system selects one 
	warhead and fires it diagonally upwards and away from the tank.
	The warhead\'s delay fuse is set so that the warhead flies far 
	enough before exploding (few meters) in order not to damage the 
	launcher sensors with the blast.

	The exploding warhead fires a directional cloud of fragments 
	(like a "claymore" mine) designed to destroy or disable incoming
	missile.

	This kind of "active armor" system can be fitted on lightly 
	armored vehicles (such as SISU-PASI APC), since it does not 
	require heavy armor or damage the vehicle like reactive armor.

	According to the test conducted in Finland, "active armor" is 
	good enough to defeat most current anti-tank missiles, but 
	there is still ways to defeat the system. In addition to missile 
	defense, "active armor" warheads can be used as giant shotguns
	against any infantry troopers who get too close to the vehicle.

No, it\'s the original one from Johnny Mandel. On the backside there\'s only
music, called "M.A.S.H. March", perhaps this is from the series, as the
Cover shows the late Crew - but it\'s not the MASH Theme.
This release belonged to a special singles series, I don\'t know if it was
only released in Europe.

Problem with that arguement?  The Missile always can point it\'s "bullseye"
towards the ship.  If it needs to, the "triangle" can cover the area that
is equal in triangular area, as the current triangle, but on the other side
of the line.  Try it.  Create the Mandatory ending position.  Now, instead
of creating the triangle on how it *did* end it\'s position, make the "base"
of the triangle twice as wide.  One point of the triangle to the left of
the mandatory end point, and one triangle to the right.  This is the "TRUE"
area that the missile could have impacted upon.
Remember: the missile needs only adjust it\'s course change by a minute
amount to be able to impact on a target that has moved 100 feet - when the
missile is 1000 miles away.
**************
but in this case the missile is already past the target. the initial
position of the ship is five hexes behind the missile....

perhaps a liniar example would better explain my point.  the ship is at
point 0 the missile is at point five.  in the movement phase the ship moves
to point 10 and the missile moves to point 105.  the ship is now within the
triangle of the missile and accoriding to the rule you proposed, can be
hit. however there is no way the missile could have hit the ship, as it was
always ahead by at least 5 hexes..

forcing the missile to end its move in the targets hex may seem contrived,
but it seems to be the best solution  so far.

another benifit is that it is eady to caculat the velocity of the missile,
just count the hexes between the vector counters.

just a couple, it actualy compares very well with most systems,  just about

Point defense lasers as I designed them, will always kill if they secure a
hit.  Minimum damage with 5d6 x 24 (2) will secure 120 points.  With armor
of 120 plus 30 points of Hitpoints, the missile will stop 60 points of
damage and be rendered ineffectual with 60 points of damage.

my bad, I was thinking of the lower TL numbers I am looking at for
Starships. For example, at TL8 a UV laser can just barely take a SIM-12.

Actually, that is part of my assertion (if anyone was really listening...
:)  ).

The idea of whipping up a crowd is not new.  In the New Testament, the
pharisaical religious leaders are portrayed as mingling in the crowd and
inciting them to shout "crucify him!".

Think about it.  In High School, the only thing you need to get a food fight
going is the captain of the football team to yell, "Food fight!".  People
are sheep.

In response to my previous query regarding Martial Arts IYTU, Michel 
told me of two JTAS articles, one in JTAS #19 ("Suggestions for 
Martial Arts in Traveller") and one in JTAS #23 ("Irklansa").  I am 
interested in the information found in both.  (Who can resist a 
description like "Psionic Survivalist Ninja Samurai Monks", eh?)  If 
this info is available on the net, I\'d really appreciate the URL.  If 
not, does anyone have any other suggestions regarding obtaining the 
information within the articles?

In re-reading Milieu 0, I found a rumor in the last section (I have 
the softback) that spoke of a world which allowed dueling, but only 
using Martial Arts.  Did anyone expand on this idea?  I\'m looking for 
a world similar to Renault from the "Matador" series by Steve Perry, 
and would prefer canonical references, if any are available.  My 
preference is anything reasonably close to Terra, preferably within 
the Solomani Rim sector.

If none are available, I will develop a small moon, secondary to the 
mainworld of the system, which will hold the type of culture I am 
looking for.

Thanks, everyone, for your assistance.

Yeah, yeah, very funny, but I didn\'t say "with this list".  I said, "with
the Traveller subculture."  From where do you think the Feds are going to
recruit collaborators?  What was the profile they gave in "Wargames"?  They

cockpit at this point is there\'s no cockpit in inside, only the window.
If/when I build a cockpit for it, then I\'d have it illuminated like the
cover of the Starship Operator\'s Manual, thus it\'s current slight red glow.

I will be adding more detail to it in the texture maps for sure, and
possibly adding the cockpit.  Before that though, I\'ve got to rummage around
and see if I\'ve got anything good that Loren can use by Jan 15 (OUCH!!!).

As for custom shots, sure.  Because of the way 3D works it\'s not too hard to
change stuff.  At this point in time (i.e. I\'m not published nor do I work
for any of the big FX houses) I\'m pretty cheap.  I\'ll do 3D models of your
ship for $50-75 or so depending on how complex the model is and the scale of
it.  This is with the caveat that I retain rights to the meshes, texture
maps, et al for us in future pictures.  If you\'d like a shot of the FT with
the "Grendel\'s Daughter" logo replaced with your own, that\'d be cheap.
Especially if you already have the logo in electronic form and it\'s of good
enough quality to use directly.  Say about $15.  Drop me a line privately if
you\'re interested in any of the above.

OK, Clif, I\'m going to select from the myriad of things that pop 
into my head while reading your posts and say just these things:

1) Occam\'s Razor
   http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/occams_razor.html

   If you have 2 (or a dozen) different explanations for something,
   the simplest one is usually the correct one. Conspiracies are
   never simple.

2) The Canadian Federal Government is barely able to keep MPs from
   shitting in their own pants, much less coordinate any conspiracies.
   I have observed enough really smart people in my life to know 
   that the amount of control necessary to run an efficient government
   is impossible and that this is most likely a lot less effort
   than running a bad government for some nefarious reason and covering
   it up.

3) You are seriously paranoid. If you have any concern for your health,
   please find a doctor that you trust or go to any library and 
   find some medical books dealing with mental health & illness.
   I doubt that you\'ll do this, but what the hell - from one human
   to another, this is my honest advice.

ObTrav: Zhodani conspiracy theorists. Now THAT is some major mind-
wiping cover-up stuff. Or is it just normal life in the Consulate?

ObTrav2: Imagine if there was an Imperial equivalent to the CBC
(or BBC for you Brits, which is somewhat different, but mostly 
the same). A single media entity dedicted to celebrating the 
uniqueness & shared values of several trillion people who have
nothing in common and who, to a certain extent, hate each other.

******* the full version *********

The solution to resolving collisions between two objects with
100 hex moves is to subdivide the moves into smaller time periods
as the objects get close.

The easiest way that I can see is as follows.

Multiply the ship\'s speed, by the missile\'s speed, the ship\'s
acceleration this turn and the missile\'s acceleration
to get the "number of impulses"

(The result is a large number, but it is just to get things in order
 and common factors can be removed to make things simpler if you want)

Divide the number of impulses by each of the ship\'s speed to find
how many impulses between each ship movement.
Similarly for the missile.

A similar division gives the gap between course changes, eg the first 60
impulses have no course change, for the second 60 you use your first G of
thrust, for the third 60 you get your second G (and your first G is lost
if it hasn\'t been used yet), etc until the final impulse when you can use
your last G.

Then just step through the turn. Once you get the hang of things, you can
easily skip through the boring bits (afterall, this isn\'t SFB where
you have to make a fire and other activities descision for each ship in
the fleet at each step. :-)

As an added guide, you might want to workout the base movement of the ship
and missile (ie their vector with no acceleration) so that you don\'t
get lost half way through the turn and take detours that change the distance.

******** the simpler version *********

You don\'t need to do the full multiplication thing, dividing each speed and
acceleration by 10 and then accumulating the fractions so that an extra hex
is granted when they add up to 1 so that the total distance moved is correct
would also work.

Then when things get close, divide by 10 again.

ie
             Ship         Missile
         Speed  Accel   Speed  Accel
           47      4      106    13
Impulse  Hexes moved
    1       4      0       10     1
    2       5      0       11     1
    3       5      1       10     1
    4       4      0       11     2
    5       5      1       11     1
    6       5      0       10     1
    7       4      0       11     2
    8       5      1       10     1
    9       5      0       11     1
   10       5      1       11     2

as a help, a spreadsheet formula like

	INT(impulse*speed/max_impulse)-SUM(hexes moved so far)

was used to generate this table.

Wagner didn\'t write it (although a lot of the other music in the movie
*is* by him.)  The piece to which you refer is "O Fortuna", the first
passage of "Carmina Burana", which was written by Carl Orff (1895-1982).

Arrrrrghh! that\'s the one I was thinking of. The paperback has a pickup

Very true. Conspiracies require secrecy. The ability to keep a secret is
inversely proportional to the square of the number of people keeping that
secret. Since the Canadian government is about as airtight as a hockey net,
there\'s no way such a conspiracy is viable.

Although, because of the party system, we do a better job of that than the
Americans. Whether or not that\'s a good thing, though, is open to debate.

IMTU, that\'s what the TAS News Service is. You\'ll get the facts, but it\'s

No way.  I\'m even worse than that.  I consider Art Bell to be a
sensationalist and figure that with the resources at his disposal, he must
be on Fed payroll, too.

Ooo! Craig, remember this for the game!  Ok, so would a rising whistle by a
spacer be an insult?

LOL.  I have to say that makes me laugh. ; )

I don\'t believe in *them* or consipiracies.  This strikes me of the person who
set up "the people" vs "the military."  It\'s a quite unlikely situation since
people make up the military (of any nation, though they might be an elite,
etc).  That said, all that\'s needed is a visionary leader, of which I don\'t
see any in the modern world.  But an inspirational visionary could well
introduce the impetus for say a new Constitutional Convention or something
similar.  If, for example, Bill Clinton should completely flip out and somehow
get a significant fraction of the military to support him, the best case
scenario (for this fictional Clinton) would lead to something like T2ks US w/
at least a MilGov that states it\'s opposition to the illegal
presidency/dictatorship.  Of course, that\'s far fetched too.   ; )

Rather, to the number of disenchanted former "believers" keeping that
secret.

Take religion, for example.  (Something else which has a place in the
Traveller universe...)  Aren\'t some religions nothing more than a
"conspiracy"?  If you bust out of the close knit group and reveal some of
the scandals associated with a leader or relic of that religion, do you
really believe that the religion, which in all likelihood collects items of
value from its adherents, will refrain from coming against such a person?

> the Canadian government is about as airtight as a hockey net,
>there\'s no way such a conspiracy is viable.

And, again, my response is that if you were a "lone ranger" who wanted to
expose the conspiracy, likely at some personal expense, how would you get
the word out when you had more than 1 (to say the least) person working
against you to keep it under wraps?  This is the premise of the movie "Enemy
of the State," and you know what they say... "Art imitates Life."

For one, this propaganda you repeat programs people to deny any conspiracy
claim as an improbable "conspiracy theory" (unless you\'re the First Lady,
then you can get away with words to the effect of "deeply-entrenched Right
Wing Conspiracy" (forgot the first adjective she used).  Then, because you
are the First Lady, the one with access to the resources to both initiate a
conspiracy AND retaliate against those trying to expose it, everyone
BELIEVES her claim?  But if you are Ross Perot and only assert that the Feds
were trying to ruin your daughter\'s wedding, you\'re a crackpot.  And, of
course, Ross Perot recanted.  Did he really see the "error" of his
confession?  Did he simply dream it all?  Did he get to be a successful
businessman by being paranoid?  Did he eat some bad pizza?

There seems to be a conspiratorial double-standard going on, here.  ;  )

Back when I was in the Army, One of my jobs was Nuclear Weapons (12E for
the military guys) One day while I was at work in the building where the
training takes place, I got a call at the guard shack from a gamer buddy.
this is exactly how the call went...

"Building _ _ _ _, This is (My real name),"
Chuck: "Hey this is Chuck. I want to send a package bomb to (Name of NPC in
Traveller game [I KID YOU NOT] we were playing.) He is really getting on my
nerves."
Me: "Ok... do you care that the postal employees are hurt or just him?"

Chuck: "Just him."

Me: "Ok, I will let you know what happens."

Chuck: "Ok bye"

Later The same day, I got another call from another gamer buddy.

Mike : "I have decided to invade (Name of planet that sounds like place on
earth...oops.), I need ships."

Me: "How many?"

Mike: "I got three companys. Freighters will do. Maybe some sort of Escort."

Me: "Ok, what about weapons grades? or will what you have do?"

Mike: "Hmmm How about some upgrades. I\'d like to modernize my troops."

Me: "Ok I know what your finances (Meaning his PC) so I will let you know
if you can afford it. Bye"

THE NEXT DAY...I was suddenly pulled into the commanders office and there
was this \'suit\' who was giving me the \'I dare you to run\' look. The
commander was reading me my rights when he remembered I was an avid
RPG\'amer. He ordered me out of his office, explained to the man (who left
really pissed) and then chewed me up one side and down the other. (I made
my weight goal for that month BTW :} ) For the longest time I did not play
RPG while at work.

I am but a humble apprentice gearhead, but I shall endeavor to answer
what questions I can....

1.  IMO, based on Table 214 of FF&S2, and the description of G
compensation on page 80, providing artificial gravity and compensating
for acceleration are linked, and therefore, like love and marriage, "you
can\'t have one without the other."  Workstations provide an additional
1G of crew capability because they can hold the crewmember in place
against acceleration.  There has been an ongoing debate on TML about
whether a ship whose decks are perpendicular to the direction of thrust
can compensate for more Gs than one whose decks are parallel to the
direction of thrust (I haven\'t made my mind up about that issue).

2.  I see no reason why one cannot combine G-comp with G-tanks.  I
wouldn\'t allow G-suits to be effective under most starship
circumstances, as they are (IIRC) best suited (pun intended) for
transient acceleration effects, rather than the sustained acceleration
normally found in starship operations.  Keep in mind that "G-comp
stacking" is not allowed under FF&S2....

Late 20th century fighter aircraft can, indeed, pull multiple Gs. 
However, the aircrew can only do so for a very short period of time (a
few seconds).  Starships can accelerate at multiple Gs for hours or
days, and thus the compensation required is more extensive.

Of course, if you _really_ want to knock your players\' socks off, have
them encounter Haviland Tuf, master of the former Ecological Engineering
Corps biowar seedship _Ark_.  _Ark_ is about 30 km long, 5 km wide, and
3 km high, and has the capability to, well, unleash fearsome bioweapons,
both micro (plagues) and macro ("monsters").

Read _Tuf Voyaging_, by George R.R. Martin, for further details....

If this is Silverberg, it\'s a short story called "Trips", first pub 1973, which appears in the collections "The Feast of St. Dionysus" and "Beyond the Safe Zone". There\'s a home page for Silverberg at http://www.connectexpress.com/~jon/silvhome.htm

Also check out the superb SF Resource Guide at http://www.geocities.com/Area51/2801/sf-resource-guide.html if you want to find other SF authors\' home pages, etc.

A similar novel in terms of theme, good but not great, is Michael Kube-Mcdowell\'s Alternities.

And the Niven collection is "the Flight of the Horse"

Sounds more like you ticked someone off (not possible, right, you\'re such a

no Internet Regulatory Office to have officials.

I\'ll back that... former head of the Ohio militia was black, and now his
Jewish wife has taken over.

He actually appeared before Congress the same day Olsen did, but his
testimony was blacked off of CSPAN. I know someone who has the live
broadcast on tape with the General\'s testimony.

Sorry Doug, but giving away a copy you have made _is_ breaking copyright,
as is giving away the original while retaining a copy. We could trade
sound effects only if you and I swapped CDs/tapes/records.

The Grateful Dead had a different attitude to copying, and gave permission
to their fans to do so.

Funny you should mention conspiracies and religion in the same post, since
I\'ve felt for a while now that they both proceed from essentially the same
impulse:  the desire to have a single root cause to explain multiple 
observed phenomena.  Thus, rather than having many unconnected processes,
everything stems from one source.  Much simpler.  Any question can be 
answered with "God" or "the Illuminati", take your pick.

A far more disturbing concept for many people is that there\'s NO ONE in
charge.  It\'s all chance, physics and self-interest at play with each
other.  No hand at the controls, guiding things to a Purpose, great or
dark.  Just us poor dumb humans, muddling through as best we can.  And
the paranoid really IS just an insignificant speck that no one cares
about enough to plot against.

Scary, hm?

Ha! Ha! 

In my PBEM, the PC\'s have finally made it to the Mark system to claim the ship they inherited. Unfortunately, the ship seems to be missing.  I\'m sure if they could get hold of *me* they would torture me until I told they where it is hid. ;->

Then, as I think about it, and considering that everything is covered by

  You\'d never really know, a la "double-think" in _1984_. If the way
in which they pruned their political society pre-interstellar travel
was of that nature and maintained since (quite possible if the system
is self-perpetuating) then how could you tell if a belief system that
they rejected was merely incompatible with their values or whether they
were hard-wired during the socialization process to reject it or be
unable to consider it due to programmed revulsion or intentional lack
of the concepts to work around it?

  And, of course, the Zho\'s simply don\'t consider "emotional sovereignty"...

  I really shouldn\'t listen to 1984 soundtrack excerpts at work.

  Upon closer examination you may be in danger of serious doctrinal error,
as even followers of later editions can be redeemed merely by accepting the
superiority of High Guard (2nd ed; first ed. is _right out_ - burning at the
stake is involved here) or a similar authorized product following the plan 
of presenting sophisticated, yet playable detail.

   Not really.
   In Imperial date -201, the expansionist Sylean Federation
launched an offensive against the Interstellar confederacy. The
Confederacy did well in battle but their military and industrial
capacity had been severely damaged in a civil war. The Syleans
outmaneuvered the Confederacy, but were fighting a full subsector
away from home (a long way, by TL-11 standards). The fighting
came to an end about -100 when Syleans withdrew their forces to
engage the Chanestin Kingdom.
   In -107 an official Sylean trade delegation was executed for
"subversion and espionage" by the Chanestin Queen. The ensuing
Chanestin war alternated between hot and cold and rapidly
resulted in a standoff. The last Sylean offensive began in -69
but fizzled and degenerated into attrition and minor skirmishes
in the subsector between the two governments. A peace treaty was
signed in -44.
   IMTU the current date is -27, so almost no one still in
service has ever seen a "real" battle. Also, the largest
engagement fought since the Rule of Man amounted to fewer than a
dozen ships on either side.  Expect the next war to force a
shakeup of the whole SF Navy.  Zhunatsu Industries is looking for
naval architects who aren\'t afraid to critique current design.
[Any takers on the list here?]. Cleon thinks his senior naval
architecture staff argued too much about Fusion Plus and is
offering them early retirement.

I respectfully disagree. A triangle between the previous position,
"mandatory " position and final position will cover a *lot* more area than
what the missile could have hit via movement.

Consider three points in the shape of an isoceles triangle. The path the
missile follows will be a conic section from the previous to the final
position. It does not and can not pass through all the points in the
triangle.

Moreover, consider a ship and missile heading toward the same point at
right angles. If the ships just coast at high speed and do not thrust they
will hit each other. Yet the triangle of positions for both objects will
not include the other object and this rule will claim they miss.

IMHO the only way of resolving this is to break the movement into as many
steps as the faster of the two involved objects and move each 1 hex at a
time. Divide the faster object\'s velocity by the slower object\'s to find
how many hexes the fast object moves before the slower one does. Divide the
faster object\'s velocity by each maximun acceleration to find how often
each object can change its vector by one hex. You hit the ship if your
counters occupy the same hex at the same time, just like in real life.

This is only necessary  if you care if two objects collide, and there is
some dispute if they do or not. With detonation-laser missiles, this is an
extremely rare situation.

Am about to go away on holiday so haven\'t had a chance to go through my
material. Check out The Flaming Eye (MT), Imperial Encyclopedia (MT) and
MTj (no 4 I think) if you have them. If not and no one else comes through
contact me off list next tuesday as a reminder, and I\'ll scan my copies.

Webmasters\' apology -

The various items of software which Rob Prior wrote for Traveller for use
on MacOS computers are held in a linked page on my personal site (pending
transfer to the BITS site). Unfortunately, at some stage during the
building of the BITS site the subdirectory containing the demos and
freeware was accidently deleted. As a result you make have got a \'file not
found\' error if you tried to find any of Rob\'s demos. This should now be
resolved as I have restored the folder from my Backup CD. Apologies for any
problems.

At the same time I revised the QSDS software demo to a later version.

Have a good Christmas.

"Get Off the Unicorn" (or Pegasus?). The "off" was *supposed* to be
"of", but some stupid undereducated proofreader was unaware that "get"
can mean "progeny". So he/she changed it, and McCaffery didn\'t find out
until it was too late to change.

I *think* that g-suits and g-tanks can\'t be used together. If they
*can* be, then I bet that the g-tank rating *assumes* that you are
wearing a g-suit inside it.

Actually, we *can\'t* compensate very well.

Also, the gees pulled in a fighter and the gees in a spaceship are
*not* going to be the same. You see, not only the *amount* of
acceleration matters, but the *direction* matters.

The worst possible direction for acceleration is "head down" (that is,
it feels like you are standing on your head. The force is from your
feet *towards* your head). This is bad because due to the way the
circulatory system works, you get the *full* effect of the acceleration
over the distance from feet to head. So at 10g, you have the equivalent
of 60 feet of "pressure head" applied to the capillaries in the brain.
They\'ll go "pop" long before that. 

Head to feet accel is easier to take because we are designed to handle
that posture for extended periods. For example, the leg veins have
valves to help keep blood from pooling there, and to allow normal
muscle contactions when walking to help pump blood back into the body.
Even so, there are limits. This is the direction that fighter aircraft
pilots are taking acceleration in. 8 or 9 g will quickly result in a
blackout. Only *seconds* at such accelerations are possible, even with
g-suits, before loss of conciousness.

Front to back is the *easiest* accel to take. Centrifuge tests of the
astronauts have had them spending *minutes* at high accel. Possibly
hours at "medium" accel (say 3-4 g). This "flat on your back" accel is
what you encounter during the launch of current spacecraft. And it\'s
what a fighter *spacecraft* will have to deal with, because turning
will have to be via changing the main thrust vector. You can\'t "bank"
in space.

So with 3 g compensation, a pilot on a fighter can probably handle an
*additional* 3g over that. And do so for many turns. That means 6g or
better thrust.

On ships, you have to restrict thrust to levels where the crew can
still move around, or else have everyone in acceleration couches or
g-tanks.

It wasn\'t any sort of "Internet Regulatory Official" because there
*are* no such people. What it almost certainly was, was a message from
one of the many automatic SPAM killers on the net.

SPAM in newsgroups does *not* give the average joe *anything*. Spam is,
*by definition*, posting *inappropriate* content to multiple
newsgroups. Note that word. *Inappropriate*. 

Also, posting *seperate* but identical messages to multiple newsgroups,
*regardless* of content is *automatically* inappropriate. That\'s why
cross-posting exists. *One* message, adressed to multiple groups.

The feds haven\'t done *anything* to the Internet. Heck, you should read
up on the *lack* of success various goverments have had in forbidding
access to various info on the net. 

And SPAMming newsgroups is no more the proper way to get a message
across than is getting up in front of your church to speak about
something both non-related to religion and which the congregation isn\'t
interested in.

Newsgroups and mailing lists cover specific areas. If your message is
not about that area, then it doesn\'t belong. What you did was no
different than walking into someone\'s house uninvited and starting to
make a speech. 

I\'m certain there are newgroups where your message *if posted properly*
was on topic. You should have posted it to one of those, with
cross-posting to the others.

But claiming that SPAM is *ever* justified, all you do is show that you
haven\'t the vaguest idea how the Internet works.

I like the idea that the Type A Free Trader from CT is a

Depends. When we were teenagers, only my younger brother \'cared\' about
NPCs (so much so that he sacrificed his favourite character for some
chance-met children).

My last group often went on self-appointed missions to save lives. They
had an oddly consistent view of morality and \'rightness\', but Lord it was
fun!

Subject: Re: GT: Missiles and optional rules
1. Do note the location of the missile launch phase in the Sequence of
Action. If on round "alpha" you detect an enemy and unload your missiles
they will be in your hex or adjacent in phase six of that round. The enemy
may then try to detect your missiles in phase one of "round beta". If both
sides have detected each other as in the "smuggler vs. SDB" situation he
will automatically do so. Having done so, a canny captain will immediately
burn Gs in the opposite direction to reduce the missile closing velocity
and flip up his active sensors to engage in missile interception.
**********
and if he is far enough away he could even generate a miss.

3. I note that some captains apparently don\'t believe in turning on active
sensors in existing situations
***************
can the active sensors be turened on even if there is no detection until
the PD phase? if so that would be very helpful.


4. When firing weapons in point defense, please note that each individual
weapon may roll to hit once; this is the normal state of affairs; firing
by battery is only for exceptional situations e.g., very large ships to
speed things up. Thus, an SDB with two triple laser turrets is attacked by
a fat tragger smuggler with two triple missile turrets. It salvos six
missiles at the SDB. These appear at the launch phase and are detected.
Next round the SDB in the detection phase flicks on its active sensors.
Assuming closing velocities such that the missiles will intercept, this is
what may happen:

Gunner switches to third missile; penalty is now -4. Gunner needs 8 or
less to hit. Rolls an 11, a 12, and a 15. All three attacks miss.
Gunner cannot attack third missile again (better pray the other gunner is
on the ball), so switches to fourth missile;
penalty is now -6; 6 or less to hit. Rolls 7, 8, 5.  Missile 3 is dead.
********************8
this was what I wass doing different, I was allowing the missiles to be
retargeted by the same tureet at an additional -2.

this does bring up a question, how many chances does a ship get against a
missile? as many as it has turrets? (I belive this is what your example
shows).

so in other words we can just total the number of missiles incoming, and
roll to hit them for each turret simply subtracting a missle from the
number for each hit witht he exeption that a turret can only get as many
tries as there are missile.

as an example, a merc cruiser is engaged by 20 missiles (6 PD turrets
available)
turret 1: 4 hits
turret 2: 3 hits
turret 3: 4 hits
turret 4: 3 hits:
turret 5: 3 hits (3 missiles left)
turret 6: can only fire three times it engages the first missile at normal
PD, the second at -2 and the third at -4.
say it hits thee first 2, but misses the third. it *CANNOT* re-engage the
last missile at -6.

Is this correct?
5. Yes, you can shoot *and* use point defense in the same turn.
**************
Good, I will be sure to make that clear in examples.

  This specific case proves that the movement is not simultaneous.  Because
all ships *must* move first before missiles, you grant the missiles an
extra-ordinary abilility.  Perhaps my memory is bad, or my visualization
process is bad, but doesn\'t the same situation that you just provided prove
that the "Hit exactly" method is just as wrong as the triangle method?
<grin>.
*************
no, in this case the missile could not hit exactly, it would have to pull
95 Gs to generate a hit with the hit exactly rule.

  As for that specific case above,  you make a strong arguement for "GM
decision."
  Perhaps, the amending "fix-up" rule for the rule of triangles is:
 The previous position counter must have started inside the triangle, or...
the current position counter must be inside the "ending" area of  a
triangle (this is the area of missile operator\'s optional area due to the
Missile\'s acceleration).  In essense, if you start in the triangle, the
missile can always adjust to what you do, and nail you.  If you end in it,
you have to be within the "bottom" portion of the triangle.
*****************
that doesn\'t work either, for example if it starts in the bottm, and moves
out, that should also be a miss.

the only way that I can see to get a realistic veiw of it is to use the hit
exactly rule microphases or \'impulses\' like SFB or car wars.  that is just
too much complexity, I think that the hit exactly rule is close enough for
an aproximation when there are other aproximations in the system:

for example, you should realy only move half of your vector change during a
turn, but it isnt as playable that way.

raming damage should be dam*(velocity^2) but that also takes longer....hey,
this satisfies my need fot blowthourh rules.....the rules as written
already inlude blowthrough.


missile hits a CA with 10 hex velocity, it does dam*10, dam*90 blows
through and looks spectacular!!

Incidentally, if I end up revising the system for other uses, Iwould be
strongly tempted to suggest an alternative that works only when targeting
identical missile salvos:
Drop the "-2 for each additional target" and instead assume you hit a
number of missiles equal to the amount you succeed by (minimum 1).
Thus, a laser turret with a 12 or less chance rolls for three lasers and
scores 11, 13, 9, it would would kill 1 + 0 + 3 = 4 missiles.
This was not in actual rules , as it runs into problems (size modifiers,
etc.) when applied broadly and against all possible ramming targets.
It is, however, much faster and easier to explain.

Ebay has other Traveller stuff too, but not basic books right now - check
it occasionally though, I once saw the Traveller Adventure (CT) there for

I checked a few other auction sites, but no hits on the keyword "Traveller"

Why does everyone want things either complicated or wrong?
******* the full version *********
The solution to resolving collisions between two objects with
100 hex moves is to subdivide the moves into smaller time periods
as the objects get close.
The easiest way that I can see is as follows.
Multiply the ship\'s speed, by the missile\'s speed, the ship\'s
acceleration this turn and the missile\'s acceleration
to get the "number of impulses"
******************
this is both more complicated, and doesn\'t solve the problem for higher
velocities.  in order to slove the problem we would need impulses for the
velocity rather than the acelleration. and that would be a nightmare.




Then just step through the turn. Once you get the hang of things, you can
easily skip through the boring bits (afterall, this isn\'t SFB where
you have to make a fire and other activities descision for each ship in
the fleet at each step. :-)
***************************
but you would have to, incldung a fire and PD phase in each impulse. way
too complex to resolve large (or small even)fleet actions.




******** the simpler version *********
You don\'t need to do the full multiplication thing, dividing each speed and
acceleration by 10 and then accumulating the fractions so that an extra hex
is granted when they add up to 1 so that the total distance moved is
correct
would also work.
Then when things get close, divide by 10 again.
ie
             Ship         Missile
         Speed  Accel   Speed  Accel
           47      4      106    13
Impulse  Hexes moved
    1       4      0       10     1
    2       5      0       11     1
    3       5      1       10     1
    4       4      0       11     2
    5       5      1       11     1
    6       5      0       10     1
    7       4      0       11     2
    8       5      1       10     1
    9       5      0       11     1
   10       5      1       11     2
as a help, a spreadsheet formula like
     INT(impulse*speed/max_impulse)-SUM(hexes moved so far)
was used to generate this table.

Ooo! Craig, remember this for the game!  Ok, so would a rising whistle by a

actualy the picht would lower and the volume decrease. the reason that the

IMHO the only way of resolving this is to break the movement into as many
steps as the faster of the two involved objects and move each 1 hex at a
time. Divide the faster object\'s velocity by the slower object\'s to find
how many hexes the fast object moves before the slower one does. Divide the
faster object\'s velocity by each maximun acceleration to find how often
each object can change its vector by one hex. You hit the ship if your
counters occupy the same hex at the same time, just like in real life.
*******************
way to complex and still only handles 2D movement, the in the same hex rule
is a nod to modeling 3D vector solutions on a 2D map.



This is only necessary  if you care if two objects collide, and there is
some dispute if they do or not. With detonation-laser missiles, this is an
extremely rare situation.

Instant D6 = 1 penny, 1 nickle, 1 dime. Flip all. With 3 coins you have

It\'s a bit hard to \'read\' the die without use of the table at first, but
after a while you pick it up. It\'s actually easier to toss the coins in
the air \'I Ching\' style, rather than flip them individually. Emulating
some other die are easy. A D4 is 2 coins, a D8 is 2 coins  + one coin
(low/high). D12 are 4 coins (the D6 scheme above + 1 low/high) but the
next stop is D24 :-( You can make a D20 from that by ignoring the high
and low two values on either end, and \'re-rolling\', and a D10 the same
way with a \'D12\', just drop the high and low as a re-roll. This gives a
flat probablility curve.

In 2nd ed. you can armor a close structure hull. The only advantages of a
wedge are: 1) fully streamlined vs partial 2) close structure is much cheaper
(.6 hull cost mod vs 1.2) and 3) wedge is more resistant to Spinal mount
(especially meson) hits... I never understood the rationale for this (ie a
larger hit number to roll above to penetrate). I guess they assume a narrower
bow on profile for the beam to hit...?

Bloody well right.  Ain\'t no Indestructable Beachballs From Hell in CT.  And a damned good thing, too.  They seriously whack out not only game balance, but *also* the look and feel of the Game we love so much.

In some parts of the U.S., militias are *not* considered to be anarchist 
yahoos.  They\'re basically the state\'s National Guard component.

Depends on how you define that.

I find it extremely interesting that the Feds tried their damnest to attach a 
\'militia\' flavour to both of these tragedies.  And the thought of the Feds 
coming in with guns to pressure a variant religious group frankly scares the 
HELL out of me.

Absolutely.  Just ask any Afgani or Viet Cong.

While there is \'freedom of the press\' in the U.S., a *LOT* of news stories get 
buried.  For instance, an incident of a US Army major who was shot in the back 
at Potsdam while attempting to take pictures back in the 80\'s.  It got one 
day\'s mentioning in Europe, and *NO* coverage here in the U.S.
 
> Now back to TRAVELLER

ObTrav:  Consider the ramifications if the Imperium decides that a very 
popular religious movement has suddenly become a \'threat\' for whatever reason, 
whether it be tax resistance to the Imperium or extreme pacifism in a critical 
area.  And your players are tasked to \'fix\' this problem...

I find it extremely interesting that some people who do not understand spam
filters blame their bounced messages to the Evil Internet Regulators, thus
\'proving\' their belief in a great One World Government Conspiracy.

Hell, *EVERYBODY* knows you *DON\'T* post binaries or pics to non-binaries
newsgroups.  Except, of course, for the terminally paranoid afraid that the
Evil Internet Regulators are going to stomp their \'Truth\'.

The wedge configuration doesn\'t make it harder for a PAW to hit, only a
meson gun.  The difference in effect is based on the fact that a meson
gun beam must decay _within_ the hull of the target, while a PAW only
needs to hit the target.  The timing required for a meson gun is thrown
off more easily by the traditional wedge shape, as displayed by the Type
S scout/courier.  (Even though FF&S2 doesn\'t address this issue, I still
use the wedge for most major warships, both for the meson gun issue, and
for the kewl esthetics of the wedge.  Besides, many of the FF&S2 ships
I\'ve done are merely adaptations of my HG designs.)

You mean some people actually want to stop the One World Government? 
Wonders will never cease. Guess I\'d better bring this up at the next meeting, 
we really do need to explain ourselves better. It so easy for people to 
misunderstand. Maybe we should go back to "floridating" water again.

Actually, that scheme was thought up long before I started messing with
computers, large or small...I was in college, and studying microbiology
and chemistry at the time, so this was thought up from first principles:

"What do we have in our pockets? How can we generate random outcomes
from this stuff?"

Hadn\'t thought of that backpacking trip where we forgot the dice for a
long time.

And doh!...until you mentioned it, I didn\'t _recognize_ it as binary 8-)
However I have learned to reinvent the wheel quite efficiently....

As with mnost GURPS sourceboks, the Traveller books are actually pretty
rules-light, in favor of background and other playing material.

Gurps Traveller is excellent if you _don\'t_ have MT Imperial
Encyclopedia, or the CT Library books, but if you have a lot of CT and
MT sources there\'s not much of anything new in there.

Behind the Claw, OTOH, is a WONDERFUL sourcebook, rich detail throughout
the Spinward Marches, which I\'d recommend to anyone.

Aliens 1 is very good (and exhaustive) in it\'s coverage of the Zhodani
and Vargr, as well as some less well detailed minor alien races. I think
it\'s quite worthwhile.

Some of the books coming up look to be as useful as BTC, so all in all,
I think it\'s quite a worthwhile investment. You don\'t _have_ to use or
even like the Gurps rules to make use of the material.

The only downside is that all measurements throughout are NOT metric, as
GURPS uses a baroque and primitive measurement system: things called
yards, pounds, miles...:-P

IMTU, the Church of Yaskoydray had to "correct it\'s errors" on Psionics

Somebody correct me if I\'m wrong, but isn\'t the illustration in G:T on the
page with the Empress Marava-class far trader actually of a Garu-class far
trader from MegaTraveller Journal 4? The stats for the two are comparable,
but MT4 specifically says the Garu bridge is located in a starboard "snout"
with a characteristic strut-braced greenhouse-style canopy. The Empress
Marava picture I have shows streamlined wedge-shaped "snouts" and a rear
spoiler.

against previously revealed "truth."  The only people who are sore about it
are those still practicing polygamy because they were excommunicated for
being obedient to what had been revealed as truth from "God" by the prophets
who came before.

Let\'s see, I have it here, somewhere...

Yeah... anyone who wants to read how an infallible religious leader caves in
to government authority should go to their local library and read the
"Official Declaration 1" at the end of the "Doctrine and Covenants" of The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints .

From what I understand, the vote sustaining the elimination of polygamy in
Mormon culture was only unanimous because those who would have voted against
it were afraid of being excommunicated.

Go to a sustaining of Church leaders, sometime.  Whereas in other churches
you KNOW that people have big problems with the minister being "a man of
God", in Mormonism EVERYONE (that I have ever seen, and I\'ve seen quite a
bit back in my Mormon days) votes to sustain and support the leadership.  It
is culturally unacceptable to fail to sustain the leadership just as it is
"bad" to fail to partake of the bread and water, even though you might
personally feel "unworthy" to partake.

These sort of experiences prompted my comment that religion is just another
sort of conspiracy.  The sad thing is that they are not isolated to
Mormonism.  No longer am I into organized religion...

This isnt actually true.

You can build quite a nice  using High Guard.

rolling at *thinks* +16 isnt it on the damage table with Fac 9 or less.

Now, the \'canon\' designers didnt build them, but that is not to say there
arent any.

    'body' => 'I did some searching and found an MSDS that listed exposure data for
CO2 (see bottom of post). From this it is quite evident that you can
have sufficient oxygen (20% at 1 atm) and *still* run into CO2
toxicity.

Note that 4% is hazardous. And that *isn\'t* that unlikely on a planet
that has life but hasn\'t yet laid down massive coal beds or the like.
Planets with "young" biospheres are likely to have *very* high levels
of CO2!

This info may also be useful for those situations where life support
has broken down, or, due to a misjump, it\'s being run *far* past normal
limits.

EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE: 
INHALATION:
Nervous system control of respiration is dependent on the CO2 level
breathed in air. By reducing the oxygen level in air, CO2 can cause
suffocation. Symptoms include: headache, dizziness, shortness of
breath, muscular weakness, drowsiness and ringing in the ears. High
concentrations produce a faint acid taste and can cause paralysis of
the breathing control centers of the nervous system:
	  2% by volume in the atmosphere will cause a 50% increase in
	     the breathing rate;
	  3% a 100% rate increase;
	 >4% produces labored breathing and is dangerous for even a few
	     minutes of exposure;
	>12% causes rapid unconsciousness
	a few hours exposure at 25% results in death.

EMERGENCY FIRST AID:
Prompt medical attention is mandatory. rescue personnel should be
equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus.

INHALATION:
Conscious persons should be assisted to an uncontaminated area and
inhale fresh air. Quick removal from the contaminated area is most
important. Unconscious persons should be moved to an uncontaminated
area, given mouth-to-mouth recussitation and supplemental oxygen.
Assure that vomited material does not obstruct the airway by use of
positional drainage. Medical assistance should be sought immediately.

Although I\'ve been adept at making those paper cubes since I was 5,
I\'ve never used them, or the paper chit-in-hat method.

What I do when desperate is take a deck of playing cards, set aside
the K,Q,J,10,9,8,7s, and then shuffle the rest and draw as many dice
as I need.  If I have more decks, so much the better, I throw them in
as well to cut down on the unconscious cheating I seem to do
with small groups of cards.

 This is now up and accessable. Note that for whatever reason, I arranged the
decks opposite of my usual style, so the lowest deck is on the left.

Take it from me - just try it ! it is simple.

If you want to use 3D, then use 3D, (with models on stands and their
vectors represented by sticks and a simple "I arrive at the crossover point
after 20% of my move, you need 35%, so we miss" calculation.)

or give every counter a number to represent its "height" above the board

but if you are willing to use a 2D representation, then why not try to
get it right.

Simple example of the same hex problem:

PCs ship comes zooming in towards the enemy ship at 200 hexes per turn
at 180 hexes they launch and the enemy accelerates towards them and launches
missiles in the opposite direction.
Next turn the PCs are hit by the enemy\'s missiles after they have overshot
him but the enemy ship is totally immune to their missiles.
Result?
One dead GM or the rules get ignored - your choice.

It\'s definitely worth it, if only for the star-town map and counters
you get in the basic game, the number of times that map got used for a
generic city in my games, the players were begining to wonder if all
cities in the Imperiumwere prefabricated on Sylea and shippd out !

Rules and background are crap.  The Volturnus adventure series
however, is easy to translate to Traveller, especialy if you mix in
"Ordeal by Eshaar" and "Across the Bright Face"

Yup, that was the incident.  He was ordered to take the pictures, got shot for 
trying it, and the story got buried the next day.

minor point, but neither the VC or the mujahdeen faced AH-64s.  The best
the Viet Cong had to deal was the AH-1 Cobra, and that scared them to
death.  The Cong tended to vacate an area that was been worked over by
helicopters.

The Afghani Mujahdeen were being slaughtered by Soviet Hinds until they
recieved the best hand-held SAM in the world, the Stinger.  Using CIA
provided weaponry, they were able to force the war to their level.  A joke
among Soviet chopper pilots ran "what is the best way to avoid an American
SAM?" "Transfer to the infantry."

Nope.  As a former President-for-Life of the Legion of Rassilon, I know my
Doctors.  The idea of the very flappable 5th doctor up to his neck in a
Vargr pack just amuses me.  The 4th Doctor would join right in with the
howling, and offer them all jelly-babies.

Wasn\'t that great!  We saw that episode at a LoR meeting, and when the
Dalek started up the stairs, the cheering was so loud we had to pause the
tape until it died down.

You can easily use the Gurps:Trav stuff with any rules you want.

The only conversions are to TLs via a table, and removing the 20% penalty
for streamlining (or replacing it with a 20% increase in armour costs and
weights for streamlined ships).

There is lots of good stuff coming out of Gurps:Traveller, and most of it
could be converted straight over to CT or MT.

I have to disagree...  The system is not very good, but I do like the alien
races & some of the ideas in the game...  Like 2001 & 2010 sourcebooks... 
Added them into MTU...  So you do have the reason the 3I does not like AI

So let me get this straight, if I am to burn people that agree with me 99%
of the time...  And you are a member of the TML...  And the TMLers agree
with each other 99% of the time...  Ah, I see...

  I heard of that once, called (in that instance) the "winter war" or some
such name, but haven\'t found other references in common material since; I
suppose I should go into the stacks sometime but I had assumed that it was
just a skirmish or two that didn\'t make the encyclopedia entries.

Really? I am not familiar with this, unless you are talking about the
*almost* skirmish that took place in the lL/MO area.
*********************
He is probably talking about the \'winter war\' where some irregulars held
off a battain/regiment for about 8 months (no casualties to either side.)

when the army got to Salt Lake City, they were told if they entered the
city, they city would be burned to the ground.  as a comprimise, Camp
Williams was built.

not much of a war, more of a passive resitance campaign,

Was he referring to the "Utah War" of 1857 ?  Total combat
casualties: two horses. (Bullwhackers intimidated by a few shots
in the air and livestock killed or driven off from burned supply
trains don\'t count.)

   OB Traveller:  A Sector duke goes down in history for sending
the Imperial Navy and Marines to supress minor rebellions on
minor worlds and later withdraws them from Industrial HiPop
worlds that have announced their intention to secede from the
Imperium.
   Short on plot hooks? Just mine your favorite pre-industrial
era in history.  Use thinly disguised or slightly altered
versions of unfamiliar events.  Take different viewpoints and you
can use the same event as a seed for three or four different
plots.

That\'s the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  Evicted
from Missouri in 1838 by state governmental order. Evicted by mob
violence from Illinois in 1845.  Sent a 400 man Battalion to
serve in the Mexican war, while en route to Utah in 1846-47.
Detachment of US Army sent to supress a non-existent rebellion in
1857.  Forced by increasingly strict laws and penalties beginning
about 1862 to abandon religiously sanctioned polygyny in 1890. 
Utah inhabitants applied for statehood in 1849, not granted until
1896.

   How about this idea for a Traveller campaign?
   A strict and generally unpopular religious sect nevertheless
attracts numerous converts to sparsely inhabited worlds.  They
are remarkably successful at building thriving communities, but
arouse jealously and hatred in their neigbors. They are
repeatedly (outnumbered and outgunned) driven off the world they
have chosen to settle, as planetary governments stand by or
actually assist. Their efforts at self defense are intepreted as
evidence of agressive intent.
   They finally choose a previously uninhabited rockball to
settle, at the same time facilitating a natural trade route
through that world. The sect leaders claim allegiance to the
Imperium, but also announce that they will never be driven again. 
Because of their repeated forced evacuations, they have a TL just
sufficient for survival.
    Reports reach the Sector duke that they are practicing
slavery, smuggling nuclear weapons, and that civil war among them
is threatening their class C starport.  He calls on the Imperial
Marines to preserve order.  Rumors reach the sect that the
Imperium is coming to exterminate them.  The PCs are approached
almost simultaneously by representatives of a Megacorporation
which wants to control the trade route and agents of the
threatened sect for assistance in the coming conflict.

[Remainder of religious diatribe snipped]

   Isn\'t this WAY off topic? *I* personally disagree and object, but I
don\'t know that most people on the list know or care what you are talking
about.  Religious rants are no more germane to Traveller than political
ones.

   But this inspires several thoughts.

   Take your (least?) favorite religious group threatened with 
arrest of its leaders, disenfranchisement of its people, and
confiscation or closure of its property and places of worship.
   A) It can flee to the frontier. Examples: Pilgrims and any
number of early immigrants to the US, early Mormons. This assumes
there is a frontier to flee to; otherwise you get B or C.  
   [The Pilgrims were headed for Virginia and ended up in New
England...a sub-optimal place for colonization, by all reports
I\'ve heard. How many worlds in the Imperium boast a similar
origin?]

   B) It stubbornly resists and is destroyed as an organization.
The devoted minority goes underground with permanent resentment
toward their oppressors but little else.  Examples: Judaism comes
to mind. A political variant; the US Confederacy.
   [Actually, that makes a nice source of conflicts.  Any
forcible repression of a people might leave resentments that can
smolder for centuries.  Might that partially account for the
Rebellion and collapse of the Imperium?]

   C) It reaches some sort of compromise with the Government
which permits it to survive. The majority accepts the
accomodation as the will of God (or whatever), in some form.  A
minority does not, and denounces the majority as corrupt for
compromising, while the majority disavows the schismatic
minority.  Examples: Mormons post-1890. The Russian Orthodox
Church survived Lenin and Stalin in similar fashion, but
conflicts within it don\'t get much press where I live.
   [A religion is militant to begin with, and the "civil war"
your PCs got snagged into involvement with is a holy war between
two religious factions...senseless to anyone else but still
bloody.]

   US vs. the Mormons: A beautiful example of how majority
opinion plus creative legal interpretation can demolish paper
obstacles to oppression.
   But the Imperium never had paper guarantees of rights or
liberties to begin with.  It was founded on the idea that its
ruling nobles would be honorable, fair, responsible, etc. 
Clearly the reality fell well short of the ideal, but if there
were no ideal to begin with; if most of the nobles were selfish
and opressive most of the time, the Imperium would certainly
never have lasted as long as it did.
   So, what kept the nobles *noble*?

Depends, do like Gurps? It is great version that gets rid of the rebellion and
such, which IMHO is great.

It is well done and a good primer for a CT based campaign.

Just sit right back and you\'ll hear a tale, 
a tale of a fateful trip 
that started from the highport 
aboard this tiny ship.  
The pilot was a mighty flying lass, 
the skipper drunk and stoned.  
Five passengers set sail that day 
for a 3-jump tour, 
a 3 jump tour.  

Local space was getting rough, 
the tiny ship was tossed 
If not for the courage of the fearless crew, 
the  dragoon would be lost, 
the dragoon would be lost.  

The ship set ground on this uncharted desert isle, 
with Shaunna, 
and the skipper too, 
A terrorist, and his pal.  
An Army vet, 
the Professor and the steward Ann, 
Here on Shaunna\'s Isle!

So this is the tale of our castaways, they\'re here for a
long, long time.  
They\'ll have to make the best of things, it\'s an uphill
climb.  
The first mate and his skipper, too 
will do their very best to make the others comfortable 
in their backwater planet nest.  
No comms, 
no lasers, 
no air rafts, 
not a single luxury

rather suspicious thing, if you think about it) the Watchtower came out with

But those combinations have nothing to do with *flipping* the coins.
They list the possible *orders* you can arrange them in. 

1 PND
2 PDN
3 NPD
4 NDP
5 DPN
6 DNP

Whereas *flipping* gives 8 possibilities.

I *think* you might be able to combine the above to get a 24 entry

Simple bulk transport, the Arrikam is little more than a cargo hold with a
bridge and bare minimum of drive modules. Each crew member has his own
stateroom, and while some crew bunk together to sell middle passages, the
Arrikam is not rated to carry passengers.

SHIP DESCRIPTION

The Argash-class Trade Escort was designed to accompany merchant shipping
in dangerous areas. Its high acceleration give the Argash the legs to get
between a merchant and danger, while its tough construction and two

This starship was designed using the rules in GURPS Traveller

SHIP DESCRIPTION

Small but sleek, the Nelsoi can be found running high-priority passengers
and cargo from the Imperial Core to outlying sectors. Even at jump-6, this
is a lengthy trip. While low berths may seem odd for such a vessel, some
passengers prefer to spend the time in cryosuspension.

Well, I can only speak for me, as a player. If the group is a guerilla group
that goes after well defined types of targets, ie the forces of the enemy, then 
my character might or might not identify with them, depending on why they
struggle. Killing the civilian supporters or bystanders, they are just terrorests 
and beneath contempt.

As you might imagine from the above, I, as a player (and in RL, for that 
matter), would have no empathy for terrorists. Hunt them down, would be 
my mantra.

        Hi, Mike!

        If you check out the software link on my traveller page, you will
find a Classic Traveller character generation program.  It\'s my work, so
I\'ll spare you the "impartial" review of it =).  My favorite feature,
however, is that you can create any Service you like and add it yourself to
the program.

        http://www.atlantic-online.ns.ca/traveller

        If you have any questions, please let me know.

*NOT* alligators.  *Palm trees*.  We figure people like toothpicks more than 
they like luggage.

At the time that the Mormons arrived in Utah, the entire territory was the
property of Mexico.  They had fled the U.S. to practice their religion in
peace.

Well, as some who chose GURPS for his Traveller mechanics
before GURPS Traveller was ever agreed to, I though it was
great :-)

There are *many* paths to Traveller, for it is not the book, but
the journey that leads to enlightenment.  Embrace the difference,
welcome the insights from all the books, for in someone\'s eyes we
could *all* be branded heretic!

  Amazingly, the boxed figure sets can sometimes still be had new for
very little ($10 US, ~$15 in funny-coloured stuff). I got several last
year at Sentry Box <www.sentrybox.com> ; the "PC/adventurer" aliens
weren\'t too bad, and the bad guy ships box had worm warships up from 1.5
to 4 inches long. Apparently there was a second box of 25mm critters,
which are also still available - I found someone who had just bought a
box to use the mini\'s for various Blood Bowl player positions.

  Some of the scenarios are fairly good, esp. the SFKH series.

Contrary to popular opinion, Daleks _can_ climb stairs.  The high
point of Sylvester McCoy\'s reign as the Doctor came in the  story
"Remembrance Of The Daleks" when a Dalek levitated up a flight of
stairs.  Also, less explicitly, in "Genesis Of The  Daleks"  (Tom
Baker\'s Doctor) they are capable of  crossing  war-ravaged  rough
terrain from the Kalid\'s scientific bunker to the Thal domed city
... not possible if all they had under were wheels.

  Would the suppression of the Cherokee settlements centred on New Echota

    This wasn\'t "caving in" to the Government. The LDS church has been given the
direction to obey the laws of the land. Those are the laws of any land that you are
living in. Any exceptions to the above statement is judged on a case-by-case
basis.

    After taking it to the US Supreme court and failing to "win" the case, the
leaders were faced with the decision as to whether to uphold that decision 
or not.
    During this decision-making process, it was determined that the "gift" of
polygamy was being taken away because the members of the church were
not living in accordance with the laws laid down by the Lord.

>From what I understand, the vote sustaining the elimination of polygamy in

>it were afraid of being excommunicated.


    Then you misunderstand. It was unanimous because nobody felt it in their
hearts that  they should vote otherwise. Those who oppose are free to do so,
and will not be ex-communicated for opposing a decision.
    Opposition to sustaining the leaders or their decisions is not grounds, and
never has been in the LDS church for ex-communication. And I doubt that it
ever will be.

Everyone is given the opportunity to vote whether they support the leadership or
not. There have been times (not many but some) when people opposed either at
the "sustainment" or in private- and the problems were addressed between those concerned.
Partaking of the sacrament, "bread and water", is also an optional activity. Those
who are unworthy to partake, should not do so. However, there are very few reasons
for a person not to, and there are ways that the individual can easily avoid being
"marked" as not partaking.

Religion, Politics, Science, or any other inanimate object, other than a conspiracy,
is not a conspiracy. There may be people in any organization who are conspirators,
and any group can be used for the purpose- that does not however make the group
one, only those members within.

My apologies to the list, however as long as there is going to be open flaming of my
religion along with the twisting of the truth about it- I will defend it.

That\'s right. Adherance to the law, and agreement with that law are not the
same thing. In obeying those laws, the church was allowed to survive there,
and was able to do much more good than was possible by fighting those
laws, or abandoning the area.

Imagine that. Jehovah\'s Witnesses discovered that they did not have much
in the way of propaganda to turn people against the church and its doctrine,
so they dug up what mud they could find, and made up what they couldn\'t.

Alright, proposing that this is accurate. If I call a game shop "The gamers\' shop"
it doesn\'t mean that gamers own it, but that they partake of the offerings of that
shop.
In the same light, *if* JS Jr. called it the "Church of the Latter-day Saints" then
he was undoubtedly calling it the Church that the Latter-day Saints partake of,
not that which they own.
It is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and is the only religious
institution today which follows the pattern of the church as established by
Jesus-Christ when he was on earth.

Yes, I suppose that the truth is twisted in favor on occassion. However, it
is quite apparent that nobody is doing so on this list at present. If you\'ve
got no vested interest in Mormonism one way or the other, then why are
you trying to flame it ?

<soapbox>

If you\'ve got \'no vested interest in Mormonism\' one way or the other, then
howcome you\'ve been slamming it the last 2 days?

I\'ve been in the Church all my life.  And I refused to take your trolls on the
Church because I did not think it was appropriate to discuss it in this list. 
There are newsgroups dedicated to religious discussions.  This is not one of
them.

I will say *ONCE* for the record, and will post no more on this subject, that I
do *NOT* appreciate seeing my personal religious beliefs slandered in the
manner that Clif has done.  How he would react were someone to slander his is
of course up to him, and I refuse to engage in that discussion as well.

After his reply to this post comes in, he\'s for the killfile.

Paper rights may not be the actual issue.

Australia, for example, does not have freedom of the press. The government
can issue a D-notice, which prevents a particular subject being written on,
or suppresses an article.

Now, they havent been used much since an incident in WW2, where a paper was
ordered to censor a story, they disagreed that the story was about National
Security, the censors were insistent, so the paper ran with half of page
one blacked out.

There is debate at the moment about whether or not we Australians put a
Bill of Rights in our constitution when we get around to replacing the
Queen of England as our Head of State.

Some prominent lawyers are arguing against codifying rights, as once you
codify something you leave gaps for smart lawyers to exploit.

The other example I would use is that in a part-feudal, part bureaucratic
system, you often have a wide divergence of views and policies among the
decision makers.

The historical example I would use is Admiral Coligny, who was the Admiral
of France during the 16th century. He was a a Protestant in a government
that was an active participant in the Counter-Reformation. The Spanish
Chancellery contains a wonderful summary of a conversation in 1529 between
the Ambassador of France and the then-King of Spain, the aggressivly
Catholic Phillip II ...

\'The ambassador did not hesitate to declare <to the King of Spain> that the
Admiral was a very bad man and that the King put no trust in him, although
be it said, that he was doing less harm inside the court than outside it\'.

To pull this directly into Traveller, I see it as quite probable that you
could have various nobles and important bureaucrats having widely divergent
views, and all may act in the Imperial Name.

Now, this is going to put a practical limit on what you can get away with
along the lines of selfish and oppressive - it may be *your* planet, but if
others in the subsector feels that \'He\'s letting the team down, what ? Bit
of a cad. Someone should do something about it, before the natives get too
restless\'.

For example, let us assume that a noble is ruthlessly exploiting the
peasants, and the other members of the ruling elite in the subsector think
he\'s gone a Bit Too Far.

The obvious first step is to invite the noble in question to a ball or
similar, and issue quiet warnings to cool it.

The second step could involve signalling social displeasure (\'Well, Davon
my boy ... the Marquis is having a bit of a shin-dig, and he\'s decided to
invite this chappie on Argulon V ... bloke by the name of Chay or
something. Involved in a bit of a to-do with that rotter Baron Mogar. What
say you see him and pass along this RSVP ... the Marquis understands if he
cant make it ... but I promised him I\'d see what I could do ...\').

The third step is to actually assist opponents of the noble in question -
appointing their supporters to positions, expiditing attempts by third
parties to pull the nible down a peg and so on (\'Sublieutant, I understand
that your brother-in-law was just arrested on Argulon V ... would you be
interested in some leave ? The Vice-Admiral\'s ADC also mentioned that you
might like to join him for a quiet game of cards\').

The final-but-one step is to use the available Imperial resources to
indirectly foil the noble in question (\'Sir, I have orders to ask for the
assistance of the government of Argulon V in a practice landing for the
1012st Marine Drop Battallion\' ... \'But the planned drop zone is in the
Sierra Modena Mountains ... we are campaigning there against the remnants
of the rebels\' ... \'Sir, my orders are quite explicit in that I am to
request the lawful authorities on Argulon V for their assistance in the
practice landing for the 1012nd Marine Drop Battallion in the Sierra Modena
region of Argulon V. You may, of course, decline to provide this assistance
to the Imperium\').

The final step is, of course, direct use of Imperial resources to directly
fix the problem. BYO Warrant.

Wrong.  The First Century Church had ONLY 12 apostles.  Judas forfeited his
office by his apostasy.  There was one apostle for each tribe of Yisrael.

You have had a perpetual succession of 12 apostolic offices, NOT the
leadership of the original and only 12 apostles.  Does that mean that a new
tribe of Yisrael was formed each time a new man was appointed a Mormon
apostle?  Your ridiculous organization ruins the whole meaning of "12" in
the first place.

Automatic generation of the most important people on the planet. Title is
linked to gov type, name weighted towards ethnicity of the planet, and a
couple of randomly-generated personality traits.

If there is a Scout or Naval base, rank, name and traits for the
appropriate Scout Commander and Base Admiral as well.

Now, most PCs are unlikely to actually interact with any of these people,
but it would be nice to know who they are, so the GM can say \'The Director
of the mining colony is Jameson Abernathy ... the guy talking to you is one
of his flunkies\'.

On a subsector level, a quick generator for the appropraite Imperial,
Naval, Scout and Megacorporate officials, complete with names, ranks,
traits and a weighted location chart (weighted towards subsector capital
and most important worlds).

the motor crashes, the almost obsessive Government policy of hiring in

without the party\'s help or hindrance as they can\'t lead authorities to any
one other than their immediate patron if captured. Some resorces and
support can be found even from unexpected quarters.

2.      The patron is a counter revolutionary, if of a lost cause. While
the claim of legitimacy is good, the population don\'t care, their freedoms
and lifestyle are largely unchanged. If the counter revolution resorts to
(or is exposed as using) violent means, then sentiment may turn against it.

3.      The patron is an out patient on a light psychiatric (revolving door
sympathy) ward. Sadly for the party, he or she has not been taking their
tablets lately. The story is very plausible, detail is well constructed,
but any serious background check will reveal flaws. The authorities know
this person well and if told will send some police and psych staff to
collect him or her then interview the party for some time.

4.      The patron is a using the party to carry out a number of vengeance
strikes for his or her personal satisfaction. The data on the targets is
good, some support in equipment and cash is readily available. But once the
real targets (ex employer or ex lover (s)) are dealt with the patron
vanishes. Possibly informing police of the party\'s description. There is
also a list of targets for the players to go on with, for the good of the
revolution, you understand.

5.      The patron is an adjustor for an unpopular faction who will dump
the party as soon as they are set on their way. The targets are real
enough, but the purpose is a complete sham.

6.      The patron is an agent provocateur for:
        1-2.    The local government who are seeking an expendable group to
justify their imposing tougher laws on control of day to day activities.
        3-4.    A revolutionary faction who have lost heavily when trying
to use nonviolent means of gaining power.
        5-6     A foreign power (state or corporation) set on seising
control of the government.

occurred to me:

1.  In the 3d Imperium, is there an "Heroic" school of poetry, similar
to Kipling or Tennyson\'s "Charge of the Light Brigade"?  If so, is it
the dominant theme of poetry, a strong subsidiary theme, or a
disreputable (in the eyes of the literary establishment) theme?

2.  Are poets such as Rudyard Kipling more popular in the 3d Imperium
than they are today [late 20th century Terra]?  In other words, would an
average citizen of the 3d Imperium be more or less likely to recognize
references to Kipling or similar poets, compared to the average citizen
of late 20th century Terra in general, and late 20th century America in
particular?

Your feedback is appreciated.

Then do so accurately. Not through the use of propaganda designed
and distributed to compete with the church in a circle that such
competition should not exist.

>A Christmas Question:  If your church is so much like the original Church,

Our Church does not celebrate Christmas. The members of our church
do so, and that is because they choose to- not because of some dictate
or other "ruling" within it.
The purpose of the Christmas celebration, as far as I\'m concerned is to
honor the day of birth of Jesus Christ. Presents represent the gift of
giving.

Later.

"THE SOLDIERS NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS"

  By Major Bruce W. Lovely

   (With Apologies to Clement Moore Who First Wrote the Story for His Children
in 1822 also credit given to M/Sgt Noah Brazos Ross, RA18033195, a USArmy 18th
Field Artillery survivor of Utah Beach, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Battle
for the Ardennes, Deutschland  wrote "Daddy\'s Christmas" (Soldier\'s
Christmas)" as a Bonita, Montague County, Texas, highschool exercise in 1937)

                              Twas the night before Christmas, he lived all alone,
                                In a one bedroom house made of plaster & stone.
                               I had come down the chimney with presents to give
                                   And to see just who in this home did live.

                                  I looked all about a strange sight I did see,
                                   No tinsel, no presents, not even a tree.
                               No stocking by the fire, just boots filled with sand,
                                 On the wall hung pictures of far distant lands.

                                  With medals and badges, awards of all kind
                                   A sober thought came through my mind.
                                For this house was different, so dark and dreary,
                          I knew I had found the home of a soldier, once I could see clearly.

                                 I heard stories about them, I had to see more
                               So I walked down the hall and pushed open the
door.
                                   And there he lay sleeping silent alone,
                                Curled up on the floor in his one bedroom
home.

                                 His face so gentle, his room in such
disorder,                                                        
                                  Not how I pictured a United States soldier
						Was this the hero of whom Id just read?
                                 Curled up in his poncho, a floor for his bed?

                               His head was clean shaven, his weathered face
tan,
                                 I soon understood this was more than a man.
                                 For I realized the families that I saw that
night
                              Owed their lives to these men who were willing
to fight.

                                Soon round the world, the children would
play,
                             And grownups would celebrate on a bright
Christmas day.
                                They all enjoyed freedom each month of the
year,
                                 Because of soldiers like this one lying here.

                                  I couldnt help wonder how many lay alone
                                On a cold Christmas Eve in a land far from home.
                                Just the very thought brought a tear to my eye,
                                   I dropped to my knees and started to cry.

                                The soldier awakened and I heard a rough voice,
                                   "Santa dont cry, this life is my choice;
                                   I fight for freedom, I dont ask for more,
                                  my life is my God, my country, my Corps."

                                With that he rolled over and drifted off into sleep,
                                   I couldnt control it, I continued to weep.
                                  I watched him for hours, so silent and still,
                                I noticed he shivered from the cold nights chill.

                                  So I took off my jacket, the one made of
red,
                               And I covered this Soldier from his toes to his
head.
                                  And I put on his T-shirt of gray and black,
                             With an eagle and an Army patch embroidered on
back.

                             And although it barely fit me, I began to swell
with pride,
                          And for a shining moment, I was United States Army
deep inside.
                                I didnt want to leave him on that cold dark
night,

                                  This guardian of honor so willing to fight.
                 Then the soldier rolled over, whispered with a voice so clean
and pure,
                               "Carry on Santa, its Christmas Day, all is
secure."
	                             One look at my watch, and I knew he was right,

                               Merry Christmas my friend, and to all a good
night!

Thank you...  I say we call for a Jyhad agains Magic:  The Gathering... 
The Brainless Morons who play the game would be better out of the gene
pool...

True story, I was at my local gaming store, with my gaming group & we have
a table reserved for weds...  Anyway this weds we all get there & a bunch
of M:TG players were at our reserved table playing M:TG..  We asked them to
move so we could play Traveller...  They would not...  We went to the
owner, a good friend of mine, he told them to move off of our table... 
They said something like, we come in once a week to play M:TG & every week
we spend about $5 each...  He told them we come in once a week to play
Traveller & we each spend about $25 a week & buy him a pizza & a six pack
of soda...  Who do you think won....

ObTrav:  Do you think there would be a game in the 3I that could lower the
intelligence of humans like M:TG & would the Hivers have created it?

I would have to say yes the "Heroic" school of poetry is still around...

As for the dominant theme...  That would varry from world to world in the
3I...  On some worlds that are made up mostly of members of the military,
yes...  On some it is a strong subsidiary theme, & on others it is a
disreputable theme...  Also, I can see the Military would have it as it
dominant theme & the Emp. I think would encourage it...  Because it
stresses loyalty & honor...

Again, that would be world to world...  But, also I would have to say that
members of the military would also be more likely to recognize it than a
lay person..

In normal circumstances, it is relatively easy to drive a car, more
difficult to fly a plane (well, land actually), and even more difficult to
fly a helicopter. To which of these do you think piloting a grav vehicle
compares?

My instinct is that it would be more difficult than an automobile but less
difficult than an airplane, since you don\'t have to worry about spins,
stalls, and the like. What do you think?

4. How would you seal the helmet? More importantly, how would you seal the
helmet of the oft-depicted suits of combat armor? Usually, these appear to
be more akin to motorcycle helmets than astronaut helmets (which seem to be
joined to the suit at the shoulder), and I am wondering about how feasable
this design would be on a vacc suit.

I have some of my own ideas on these questions, but I would really enjoy the

back of the Imperial combat helmet, as depicted in MegaTraveller (especially
the Rebellion sourcebook). I assume it isn\'t just there for decoration or
aerodynamic shape.

Well, I know it\'s *really* just an aesthetic decision made by the artist who
designed the look, but I\'m looking for handwaves here.

My first guesses are electronics for a communicator, a computer for
environmental control and combat duties (automap, GPS, targeting aid when
linked to a smartgun, etc.), maybe some mechanical gear for life support (a
subsystem of the suits overall system), and a power supply. Any other ideas
(or criticisms of these ideas)?

I like the look of the helmet, and have no problem handwaving the visor.
IMTU, it\'s a solid-state sensor band using holographic technology to allow
unobstructed vision, similar to the one a certain sci fi show\'s engineering
officer wears. If it is damaged, the whole faceplate can be removed by
depressing the two lower-corner buttons to reveal the wearer\'s face, which
is still protected by a "bullet-proof" clear mask (although not so well as
when covered by several mm of superdense). This clear mask also serves as a
convenient display surface for the HUD, even when enclosed by the visor
faceplate.

But that black thingie in the back bothers me, from a logical standpoint. I
like the look, but I wanna know *why* it\'s there, or have a convenient lie
ready for my players.

Your comments would be greatly appreciated.

I\'d readily agree with you on this one.
All the manoeuvreability that an auto has in 2D, but with the added
complication of height thrown in.

A question : how sensitive is a contragrav lifter to local mass
concentrations (e.g. an ore body or an outcropping of granite)?

Do the \'road maps\' of a grav vehicle-using world have gravity gradient
contours (in addition to the usual ones so people don\'t fly into
mountains...)?

of generating the important people in a subsector.

Now, most Imperial citizens would have a very good chance at knowing who
their Subsector Marquis is, and many would have a better than sporting
chance at knowing important people on other worlds. Most corporate types,
for example, would either know (or be able to find out at short notice) who
the main players are for each megacorporation in their subsector. Military
types would tend to know who the Admiral-in-Charge is.

However, doing all this stuff is a huge amount of work. Therefore, lets
automate it.

The simplest way is to do an \'org chart\' for a typical subsector, and use
some variant of the Twilight 2000 \'card\' system for determining character
traits (is that still under copyright ?).

Now, in addition to the ruler of each world, each subsector is going to
have a ranking Imperial noble, a ranking Admiral, a ranking Scout
Administrator, and a bunch of megacorporate types (if a megacorporation is
an Imperium-wide corporation, then every subsector should have at least a
token representation. But not neccessarily all megacorps should be equal -
toss in a randomised ranking while we\'re doing it).

Given that the Imperium is run by an intertwining bunch of families, we
then get to roll some dice to see who is either related, feuding, or both.

Now, at one fell swoop, we should set up a bunch of plot hooks (\'Duke X is
related to Admiral Y, who is feuding with the LSP Subsector VP\'), do a
bunch of background for players and add a new dimension to the UPPs.

Airplanes and helicopters fly pretty much the same in straight and level
flight, and aren\'t much harder to control than a car; In fact, events
happen much faster in traffic and there are many more objects to run into.
It\'s only near the ground that aircraft get squirrelly.

Being a helicopter pilot, I have always taken grav vehicles to be an
advanced version of my aircraft, without all the nightmare of conflicting
aerodynamics that actually keeps a helicopter in the air. Grav vehicles can
hover, fly sideways and backwards, and lift straight up without climbing,
all of which take them out of the airplane analogy pretty quickly. 

Difficulty-wise, I\'d say that the advances in flight controls and the
relatively simple design (we presume) of grav vehicles makes them no more
difficult to pilot than driving a car with manual transmission: each hand
and foot has something different to do, but they all go together pretty
smoothly. This is different than, but equivalent to, a light airplane.

The main difference to keep in mind with all aircraft is that their motion
is relative to the air mass they fly in, not the ground. An air raft
hovering in a 30 mph crosswind is essentially flying sideways at 30 mph, no
matter what it looks like on the ground. Light grav vehicles would be
subject to bouncing around in turbulence, especially near the ground (one
good reason to still have clear landing pads); something as heavy as a grav
tank would be steady in a hurricane, if it could fly fast enough to keep up.

Indeed.  I\'m currently reading *Patriots*, by David Drake - based on Ethan
Allen and his actions in Vermont before/during the American Revolution.
Other SF books have been similarly based on RW events.

Drake is good for plotlines.  For instance, for ideas on merc tickets, there\'s
his Hammer\'s Slammers stories, and one not as famous:  Forlorn Hope, which,
IMNSFBHO, is one *HELL* of a read.

Where am I stealing my ideas from these days?  Niven/Pournelle, Drake, Jack L.
Chalker, and of course, the late Admiral.

Seriously, I _am_ a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe, a "real live

It\'s kinda interesting sometimes, finding out about people\'s perceptions

Stuart,

2 possible suggestions come to mind. One is for clarification. The
program buttons say something like print sector when it actually prints
a subsector, not a big problem. The second is to incorperate the code to
print the subsector map as well as the text description. Altogether tho
a very fine piece of work.

	Actually, by the time we can build grav vehicles, I\'d expect it to
be even easier to "fly" them than it is to drive a car, due to the
automation. You wouldn\'t actually be controlling the grav vehicle,
you\'d just tell the computer where you want to go and the built-in
control laws would figure out how to convert your desires into the
appropriate signals to the system. No need to worry about yaw, pitch,
roll, angle-of-attack, incidental aerodynamic forces and loadings.
Pull back on the stick to go up, push forward on the stick to go
down, pull it left to go left and right to go right, and press the
footpedal to go faster, or press the other one to slow down.

	That\'s assuming you have any "manual" control at all. Personally,
judging by the fact that 98% of the human population really can\'t
figure out how to safely drive in *two* dimensions, I shudder at the
thought of morons trying to deal with three ...

Actually, flying the vehicle would be quite easy, you just point the nose
in the direction you need to go, and let the antigrav take over. Since the
controls would be mostly automated, very little effort would be needed by
the operator.

The difficulty would be when a system fails at high altitude. With an
airframed vehicle, all you\'d need to do is fall back on a little basic
glider skills. Vehicles without airframes better have good ejection systems.

plan on releasing it when the licensing gets finalized (mail\'s slow this
season). Keep checking the BITS web site (www.bits.org.uk) for a demo
release.

Some questions while specifications are mutable:

Tech Levels
- ----
I\'ve included metric and american options for units. What about including
\'real\' Traveller TLs as well as/instead of GURPS TLs? Would this be
useful? I see four options for display:

1) Traveller TL (eg. TL12)
2) both TLs (eg. TL12/GTL11)
3) GURPS TL as "GTL" (eg. GTL12)
4) GURSP TL as "TL" (eg TL12)

I currently give the user choice between 3 & 4. Would adding 1 & 2 add any
_useful_ functionality?

Full Thrust Translations
- ----
Would it be useful to print out anything other than what you\'ve already
seen? I can think of Full Thrust ship sheets, for example. Does GURPS have
a decent ship sheet?  (Note that doing graphics is fiddly, so I\'ll only
add that feature is there is a real demand.)

PC Version
- ----
My access to PCs has been drastically reduced, and the student who was
working with me is as reliable as a teenager (surprise, he\'s 15!).
However, I\'m willing to work with a PC programmer to get this out the
door. Thanks to Chris Olsen I have Delphi 2.0, and I can use my neighbours
computer to run stuff (just can\'t really program there, not with their 4&5
year old kids climbing over me). The Mac source is THINK Pascal, and I
deliberately kept the code as portable as possible.

If interested, contact me and we\'ll work out financial arrangements
(probably a cut of sales: SJG  will get 5%, BITS has to recover costs,
we\'ll dicker over the remainder).

  The Imperium seems rather too heterogeneous for a "dominant" school to
be meaningful (IMHO), but there could well be a poet-laureate type ideal
to advance State interests. There could also easily be a Court style of
poetry that would change from reign to reign with the tastes of the ruling
family (and within a reign, or various Household members favouring different
arts/artists/etc.).

  Depends on whether or not they\'re a Solomani sympathizer? But seriously,
the Party likely relies heavily on the later modern period (pre-I.W.) for
propaganda purposes, not least because the pols aren\'t real likely to be
terribly familiar with much else.

  No idea, but if they were a settled community and advanced in adopting
European trappings then they might very well have been largely Christianized
by that time. They\'d almost certainly encountered RC priests, and probably
Protestant missionaries as well, and the French and Spanish had been making
conversions in the New World for centuries.

 i.e., I don\'t know :)  Was there genuinely such a thing as a secular
anything in the Americas in 1830?

 1) Originally, it was red :) - see the box art for the Grenadier figs.
 2) Assume it\'s a housing for a non-vital but bulky accessory (?).
 3) It\'s clearly (on the mini\'s, anyway, IMO) detachable, and quite
possibly not a 3-D solid (can\'t be sure due to limits with blocking off
in the casting process). It could very simply be a splinter shield, and
possibly intended mainly to prevent contact CBM\'s hitting the back of
the neck, which is a large flexible sleeve (armoured, but still...).

  I\'d go with #3, but I\'d like to hear from #2 as well.

  FWIW, #5852 TNE Coalition Marines/BD doesn\'t have the back extension,
so it may very well be an armour design choice of dubious necessity.

  BTW, RAFM\'s "Silent Death" mini\'s #0650 "Javelin" and #0653 "Praying Mantis"
are also the old TNE #5822 "Darrian Patrol Cruiser" and #5820 "RQS Inspection
Launch", respectively, and are thus still available retail.

A later episode, when Sylvestor McCoy was the Doctor, showed a limited
\'lift\' ability when faced with stairs, somewhat like a thruster
plate/contra-gravity effect,which allowed the Dalek to hop up stairs.

I have two freeware MT chargen programs for Windows.
The first, called "MegaTraveller GM Aid", was developed
by Dennis G. Landsem in 1992. The second, called
"MegaTraveller Character Generator", was developed by
A.S. Lilly, also in 1992.

I have the original .zip file for the first but you
may need to contact Andy for the second. His software
does state that it was for alpha-testing only and was
not to be distributed with his say-so.
(Yo, Andy, you out there?)

Dennis\' program forces some random rolls, yet includes
chargen from the 2 DGP alien modules. Andy\'s allows you
to manipulate every single roll but you can\'t save the
character.

Please notice that I used the word "was."  Sigghhhh.  My question was
whether atheistic, secular American Indians existed at that time.  If not,
then ALL actions against the American Indians of that time would have to be
considered as being "religious persecution", since their religion was so
much a part of their culture.

  It shouldn\'t be anywhere near significant. If the technology is a
_repulsor_ of some sort, however, then both the density (and rigidity)
of the surface and distance from it could become issues. But for CT
grav modules it shouldn\'t be an issue, AFAIK.

  Yes - some of us are used to thinking in Trav terms. One way to help is
to specify TTL in hexidec, and GTL in straight decimal notation. Anyone who

        Unfortunately, no...  this was years ago...  The short version was
that it was a TCS game and somebody\'s fleet got caught doing frontier
refueling...   Side A got caught completely off guard, as side B\'s vessels
approached the GG in its RADAR shadow, and engaged Side A from essentially
an ambush.  The vessels in the High Guard position (about 30% of the total
assets) had to fight a point-blank brawl with 100% of Side B\'s forces;  the
ships refueling were automatically declared "in reserve".
        I distinctly remember that one issue was that Side B\'s three
commanders were rolling phenomenally well on damage results...  more "2"\'s
for damage and "12"\'s for "to-hit" than any of us had seen.  The other was
that Side B was using a Battle-Rider patterned after the Star Fleet Battles
"Mauler"....  Spinal Z meson, USP 6  Agility, 6g\'s and USP 15 armor.  He had
dozens of the damn things, and coupled with several hundred fighters firing
as USP 9 nuclear missle batteries, simply trashed the smaller force in the
High Guard position.
        Of course, then he "broke through" Side A\'s line and was able to
fire unanswered upon the ships coming out of the gas giant....  I *think*
one Tigress was actually lost due to a drive hit that prevented her from
escaping the gravity well.
        Anyway, this was 10 years ago or so.  As I say, I don\'t have any
more details than that in what little memory I have.

  {
    'body' => 'A lot of this is repeats on what is already out there. I\'m thinking of this
from a PoV of a campaign based around my \'Small Scale Colonisation in
Traveller\' rules, so I\'ll concentrate on the lower half of starports.

Canon Basics :

Class E starports have no fuel and no maintainence. Basically, a marked
landing zone, and maybe a couple of buildings.

Class D starports have rudimentary facilities, navigation satellites,
unrefined fuel and some surface-orbit shuttles.

Class C starports have decent facilities, some orbital component, refined
fuel available and can maintain non-starships.

Actual sizes :

Now, a starport is built to deal with a particular pop code - a type D
starport in a system with 2000 people is going to look a lot different to a
type D starport on a world with a billion people.

A starport\'s capital cost is thus based on class and population.

Defenses :

E starports have no defenses. 

D starports would have primitive defenses - a couple of ground-based
missile racks, perhaps a ground-based point-defense laser, perhaps a
handful of third-line fighters.

C starports would have more extensive defenses, similar to those at a D
starport but more extensive, higher quality and including an orbital
component.

It is possible that local Imperial commanders would assign a particular
world Imperial defense assets - the world may not own any meaningful
defenses, but an Imperial escort carrier and a company of Imperial Marines
may be temporarily assigned to the world on a training mission. Some
training missions may last decades (nasty surprise for ground raiding
pirates huh ... \'Whats that Trepida doing here ???\').

Personell :

A starport has an Administrator, who is in charge. Starports may be
Imperial, Corporate or Locally controlled. Canon starports are always
Imperial, but private facilities are mentioned (eg Hard Times).

Imperial Administrators will typically be nobles - a Knight for a small
and/or primitive facility, working up the noble scale as the starport/fief
gets larger or more developed.

Corporate Administrators would be rank O3 for a small facility, going up to
rank O6 for a critical facility.

Local Administrators would usually be rank O4-O7, and the exact branch
would depend on the world ( Bureaucrat, Diplomat, local military could all
be appropriate).

Sometimes, the Administrator contracts the actual running of the facility
out to third parties, allowing them to spend their time on other matters.

Plot Hooks :

Obviously, players could be maneuvered into running a small starport out on
the frontier (Bowman Belt is a good one IMO). 

Military-inclined players could be kept interested by pirate raids and
such, while more socially inclined players could be kept busy by liason
with locals and visiting traders (getting someone to put the world on a
regular route should be a priority).

Smuggling and corruption could raise nice moral dilemnas, and if the
players are the authorities, then they get to deal with the horseplay of
just-landed crews ... they *are* the Imperial Authorities after all ...

Merchants could begin to trade on their own account with visiting traders.

Other adventuring opportunities include surveying the rest of the system,
or providing Local Assistance when the Navy turns up with a problem.

Heck, set it just before the FFW breaks out, and have them cut off, and all
alone ...

Praise is due to Allah that can not thank anybody on misery save He alone My
misery began from the birth of my child Islam who suffered from limbs
paralysis.

He was born on 23-8-1987 , and was admitted to Mansoura University  lospita
at the day of birth and stayed there for treatment, then he got out with the
same disease without any progrcss.
Also I kept going to professors of brain and nerves in Cairo with no
progress then , I travoled to Saudi Arabia to work and i was responsible for
his care and his treatment with no one\'s help, that he has sonseless
urination and stool.And I brought him the diapers of

TENA ART 71 01 0036 PCS/ST   I TENA MADE IN SWEDEN SMALL 50-80 OR BIGER
But The Company was closed and I returned back to Egypt and this was God\'s
will.

Now, I am in a misery that there is diapers,and  sometimes I found it in
fee- area in Port- Said in high costs as
I need more than 120 diapers per month
I have made a chair for him when I was in Saudia Arabia, but now it doesn\'t
work and he needs another special one and diapcrs.
I hope that someone can help me by having a special chair or diapers or
treating him in a special centre.
Thanks for every body who can help in making my family smiles again.

Pretty easy. Computerized controls (which is what you pay all that
money for in FFS grav vehicles) of TL9+ should ensure that the grav
vehicle is essentially perfectly stable; if you point it in a direction
and let go of the controls it will keep going straight (probably automatically
leveling out), as opposed to aircraft or even cars, which are at least
slightly unstable. The hard part is probably maintaing adequate
awareness of your environment - like other vehicles - especially at
high speeds; fast (200 km/h+) grav vehicles may require special
licensing and/or nav equipment and sensors.

Another possibility would be electronics/computer for the armours sensor
array. For example, command or recon suits could have a PEMS array with
dispersed elements on the armour - at the hands and feet - that with a good
computer could synthesize a view using the baseline provided by the span of
the wearer\'s arms, giving resolution a couple of hundred times better than
the normal eye andtwenty times better than the best binoculars.
Even normal suits probably use the whole visor as a PEMS array, which needs
at least a little computer power to process.

  A flamefest? - how convenient!  Steam engines, anyone?

  Striker dosn\'t cover external combustion power plants, but the values
below might be a reasonable starting point:

Striker:
  TL    Description            Output  Weight   Price   Fuel
  4?    early steam             0.05?   2.0      500     800? 
  5?    steam                   0.10?   2.0      500     600?   
  6?    steam turbine           0.15?   2.0     2000     400?
  5     Internal combustion     0.15    1.0     1000     900   
  6     Improved I.C.           0.25    1.0     2000     500
  7     Gas turbine             0.40    1.0     5000     500
  8     MHD turbine             0.60    1.0    10000     300

  Using the above (hypothetical stats indicated with a question mark)
there\'s a clear use at TL 5 for a fuel efficient EC unit (although the
output will be too low for a practical tank. By TL 6 the utility in
ground vehicles is becoming truly marginal.

  And what about you, sir? Are you perhaps merely dissembling to avoid
an exploration of Traveller Classic-ness? Are your deckplans compatible
with CT? Hmm, are they?                                                    :)

I like GURPS, and I like Traveller. The combination of the two is excellent
on most levels, but tends towards annoyance on some other levels.

Broadly, the G:T book is well put together and generally attractive. The
interior art is, for the most part decent, ranging from workmanlike to
rather good. The layout is really good, and the tone of the book is
excellent. There are insights from Loren punctuating the text that explain
why things are the way they are in the Traveller universe. Many of these
comments go on to explain what the ramifications of changing certain basic
assumptions in the OTU are.

As far as rules go, it\'s about as good a translation as you could hope for.
The basic flavor of Traveller has been retained, at least in my opinion.

My only problems come down to certain niggling details, it appears that the
costs of various drugs have been left out. Further, a rudimentary version of
the computer rules was left out, making the descriptions of various computer
programs confusing unless you already own a GURPS book with the computer
rules inside.

All in all, I am personally pleased with GURPS: Traveller.

I think we do have limits on what we can say...  Politics & religion are
two of them...  As a jew (& Clif if you want to flame me for supporting the
Mormons, please do it off list), I have to say that I support the Mormons
in their belief structure...  I also have to say that I support Islam,
Christos, Wicca, & all other religions...  They have a place in this world,
& no one should have the right to attack another for what they belive...  I
call for all of the members of the TML to come together at this special
time of year & say, with one voice, "I love you..." & by saying that I must
say to this list, I love you all...  You are friends of mine...

As to politics, well you all know how I feel about that...

I am sorry, if I did not post something related directly to Traveller, but
let us understand that we are also people here...

You are welcome, friend...  I say we all go out for a beer together on New

Same here...  I come here to the TML to engage in an intelligent debate
about Traveller, & other SF subjects...  Not be attacked by a narrow minded
little git like Clif...  I know I am a jew, but Mormons & jews have many
things in common & we support each other...  Next door to me lives a Mormon
Family, & they & I have shared many good times, just like everyone where I
lived have shared good times, as well as bad times...  It sounds as if Clif
wants us to go back to the way it was in the bad old days...  I do not...

What about the Jewish Traders that would live in Penache(sp) communities?

I\'d suggest early steam at TL 3, VTE (vertical triple expansion) steam at early 
TL 4, Steam turbine to TL 4, Geared turbine at late TL 4, Small Water Tube at 
early TL 5 and improved geared turbine at TL 5

                TL  Output Weight   Price  Fuel
Early Steam      3   0.05    5.0     500    500
VTE Steam        4   0.10    2.0     400    300
Turbine          4   0.15   25.0     500    700
Geared Turbine   4   0.20   50.0     600    500
VTE Steam        5   0.15    1.0     400    250
SWT Turbine      5   0.25   15.0     600    400
Geared Turbine   5   0.30   35.0     700    400

If you want to get truely technical, VTE is more fuel efficent than turbines, but 
only at low speeds (there\'s a bump at around 15 knots were the two switch).

Jesse, I am going to take a wild guess here, but you are a Mormon, are you
not...  If I am wrong, well then, I am sorry...  But, you will have to
forgive Clif, for he knows not what he does...  Or is simpler terms, he is

Sounds about right to me...  It seems when you have a decent, honorable
religion (not that I know that much about Mormonism, I am just going by the
Mormons that I know personally & they are decent, honorable people),
everyone wants to tear it down.  They go on about the fact that Mormons
keep, I think, two years supply of food handy as something evil.

Terrorists are always bad guys to me, no matter what their cause.

While I concede that there is a fine line between a patriotic freedom
fighter with no other options and a murdering terrorist, some actions are
very definitely on the wrong side of that line. Thus terrorists get lumped
in with users of biotoxins,  racist/"ethnic cleansers" and rapists as "very
definitely the bad guys". If my players wanted to do these kind of things
I\'d want a really interesting reason and a really fascinating moral
situation to explore. And even then I think I\'d have trouble restraining
the "call in the security forces and hose them with hot lead" reflex. Which
may refer to the characters or the players.

Now, I have used the "do we fire on this crowd of mainly innocent
protesters" dilemma a few times, or the "so-called \'dangerous criminal\' on
the run from the local police state.... help or hinder him?" ideas  and had
a good time with them, but terrorism is for the bad guys. Who deserve
whatever they get.... 

Guerrillas are a different can of worms. I have my own idea of what the
difference is - guerrillas are irregular troops fighting a "dirty war".
They may well use bombs and even attack "government institutions" like the
post office and the income tax buildings, but once you start walking into
pubs and executing random drinkers, or bombing shopping malls then you\'re
no longer a soldier, you\'re a murderer. The moral issue is quite clear. I
don\'t think I\'d be comfortable with PCs who took this route, and I\'d
certainly be merciless in determining the security forces\' response.

One could probably link this in with the "nuke Hiroshima/Firebomb Dresden"
argument, but.... NOT AGAIN, PLEASE!!!!!

Just some random thoughts on this happy day....

I thought the minimun needed for decent genetic diversity was on the order of

It\'s not *possible* to give a scientific explanation because what you
are calling "conciousness" (actually more like a "soul" or "mind")
doesn\'t *exist* as far as science is concerned.

If you physically duplicate the atoms and energy states (actually you\'d
be duplicating the "wave function") then science says it *is* the same.

So before you can drag science into it, you have to *scientifically*
define this thing you are calling "consciousness". There\'d have to be a
*measurable* difference between the results produced by the first
version and by the second. And if they can measure it, then it\'s only a
short step to duplicating it. 

BTW, the "scan and send" type device has no *real* reason to destroy
the individual. In fact several authors have written stories based on
the premise. Including one by Poul Anderson where they send a copy of a
troubleshooter to a colony world and when he\'s killed, they send
another copy of him. Which rather freaks out the colonists. :-)

While there is a fair bit of Wagner in "Excalibur", the choral piece that is

Carmina Burana
by Carl Orff

The version I have is from RCA Red Seal, RCD14550. But there are many versions
on many labels, so you should have no problem finding it.

I haven\'t ever used this in a Traveller game, but along with Starvinsky\'s "The
Firebird", "The Rite of Spring" (or "Le Sacre du Printemps") and "Petrouska"
and Prokofiev\'s "Alexander Nevsky" (soundtrack from a early Soviet film).

I highly recommend the BMG Classic edition of "Alexander Nevsky"
(09026-61926-2), as it has the sounds of the "battle on the ice" from the
film. For those of you not familiar with the story, Alexander Nevsky\'s ill-
equipped partisan troops lure the invading hordes of Teutonic German knights
out onto a ice-covered lake, where the heavily armored troops falls through
the ice and drown, thus saving Mother Russia, etc., etc., etc. A great film
and a great soundtrack once you get past thepropaganda!

    'body' => '                      The Terran Free Traders

One of the distinguishing features of the Interstellar Wars were the Free 
Traders, indeed it is generally accepted that they were a major factor in the 
ongoing tensions between the Terrans and Vilani. The Free Traders were 
independent Terran merchants who found a ready market for Terran goods 
amongst the Vilani frontier worlds. Whilst a few Free Traders could be found in 
the early years of the 22nd Century, they did not become a major factor until 
after the First Interstellar War. With the availability of large numbers of cheap 
surplus naval couriers and high tech Terran goods, the circumstances were 
right for a great flourishing of independent mercantilism.

The first Free Traders were collectives of former military personnel who had 
chosen to pool their mustering out benefits and use them as down payment on 
a surplus naval transport. This collective spirit was to distinguish the Free 
Traders throughout the Interstellar Wars period; most crews would consists of a 
group of shareholders working for a share of the vessels profits (or losses). 
Extra crewmembers might be hired on an as needed basis, but most ships 
avoided this as it greatly increased their expenses. Their command structures 
were informal with most decisions being made by consensus. Most crews 
generally accepted one of their number as captain (many interstellar 
regulations of the time required a captain), but few had use for other ranks and 
titles.

Initially the Free Traders were restricted solely to the Terran Confederation and 
the Vilani worlds within a few parsecs of the border. However with the Terran 
triumph (and resulting commercial concessions) in the 3rd Interstellar War they 
began to trade throughout the entire sector. By the dawn of the 23rd Century 
they were beginning to expand into adjacent sectors and had become a major 
commercial force in the rimward provinces of the Ziru Sirka.

The Free Traders did not follow organised trade route and while they did carry 
conventional freight, they were most noted for their speculative trading. 
Protected by their privileged position, the Vilani trading Bureaux had for 
centuries possessed an effective monopoly on interstellar trade. Despite paying 
considerable attention to their markets, they had gradually lost contact with 
their customers and by the time of the Interstellar Wars were no longer fully 
meeting the needs of many worlds. The Free Traders were able to capitalise on 
this and provide the Vilani frontier worlds with goods and services that the 
Bureaux were unwilling or unable to. Initially the Free Traders only traded in the 
few specialist goods which the Terrans had an advantage in (medical supplies, 
computers, and the like). Nevertheless, as Terran technology matched (and 
then surpassed) that of the Vilani, they expanded into other more mainstream 
areas. The watershed is usually regarded as the so-called Empty Peace 
(2158 AD to 2185 AD). During this period the Free Traders made considerable 
inroads into traditional Vilani markets, trading in everything from childrens toys 
to heavy machinery. It was during this period that the Free Traders overcame 
the traditional Vilani cultural prejudice towards alien goods as they came to 
regard Terran goods as equal or superior to their own. Once this prejudice was 
overcome, it was only a matter of time before the more responsive nature of the 
Free Traders came to supplant the Bureaux as the principle supplier of the 
border worlds.

                    The Free Traders Foundation

The Free Traders Foundation (FTF) was a non-profit organisation set up by the 
remarkable Terran industrialist Yukio Hasagua in 2121 AD. Intended to foster 
and encourage the growing Free Traders, the FTF championed the cause of the 
Free Traders against frequent disfavour in the Terran Confederation and the 
continued hostility in the Ziru Sirka. The FTF became the first port of call for 
any Free Trader who felt themselves aggrieved by either government.

REFEREE INFORMATION: The FTF was actually supported and encouraged 
by the CEIB (Confederation External Intelligence Bureau), who found that the 
Free Traders provided excellent cover for many intelligence operations.

Well, Clif, the confusion that your original message engendered on my part
is a reasonable sign that being careful when communicating would be
warranted.
 
In regard to your original question: it is difficult to know what sort of
religions existed on the North American continent during the early period
of settlement by Europeans, for two reasons:
 
- - one, there were several hundred different tribes (still are), and
religious/spiritual beliefs varied widely between them.
- - two, European explorers and colonists had an unfortunate tendency to
destroy any records of NA beliefs and to re-educate native people to
Christianity.  There were minor exceptions, but this was largely the rule.
 
Finally, regarding your notation about freedom of speech - hey, if you
want to be a jerk, feel free.  _I\'m_ not stopping you.

And remember, one interesting twist with this. The second duplicate DOES
NOT have the memories of the first so he/she will not remember people
the first duplicate knew, world/area specific knowledge, etc., but will
have memories of what the original did in the intervening time. Can be
interesting if the first duplicate (clone?) was married, had children
etc. since the clone wouldn\'t know them and may not have the same
feelings. An interesting example (albeit a bit over played) is the
situations encountered on "7 Days" with the on again, off again romance
between the 2 lead characters.

ISTR reading somewhere that as long as you have 30 people who are

A Traveller equivalent to AD&D World Builder\'s Guidebook.
It should include:

1) Extended System Generation so you can do something within a
system.
2) Planetary detail. Gravity, day and year length, and
temperature. World mapping so you can do something with climate.
3) Biology. Not just the animals generated in the main Traveller
rules, but plant life based on the climate. Relationships of the
animals, generation of sentient aliens.
4) Proportions of alien cultures and human subcultures.
5) Local population densities and cities. 
6) Extended TL. The TL in a world\'s UWP represents the locally
generated average TL at the starport...out in the sticks, it
might be considerably lower (It could be higher!). PE\'s
suggestion on breaking it down into Energy, Materials processing,
Information processing, medical, transportation, and R&D works
for me.
7) World philosophy or character.  The "World character" of PE is
connected with this as well, though some of these categories are
more useful than others. Planning, Militancy, Unity, and
Tolerance seem OK. I have a hard time distinguishing
"Progression","advancement", and  "growth". Two characteristics
that I would like to see are "equity" (degree of distinction
between social classes), and "Safety"  (Of your life, liberty,
and property: has little to do with law level)
8) Families. PE had the right idea, but I need a quick skeleton:
How many children a couple had and when, who and when a child
married, and how long each child lived. I can fill in the blanks
later. 
9) Economic structure. The trade class and TL give only a very
vague idea of what the principal industries on a world might be.
(UWP is C303422-B...Can the players expect fresh bananas if they
ever come here? What about vac suits? Spare parts for a grav
belt?) A way to estimate the volume and type of major imports and
exports and how busy the starport should be would be nice. What
are the common vocational skills? The Economic extension to the
UWP will do nicely.
10) Corporate and educational structure. (Can I expect a to find
a university here? A representative of Tukera Lines?)
11) Government and legal structure. The Milieu-0 campaign
hardback gives some nice ideas on the ULP (univeral law profile).
For government, some idea of the various functions of government;
e.g.  Finance, law enforcement, military and how important each
one is.
12) Social organizations and movements.  These might include
religious groups, political parties, revolutionaries, and all
kinds of "isms" and "ists".
13) Leaders. Important leaders in families, corporations,
government, and other social movements.
14) Changes. Social organization is not static, but changes.
sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly. Some ideas for generating a
history and making social changes would be nice.

I don\'t need yet another version of FF&S: I need something to
help flesh out bare UWPs so I can run interesting adventures.

  I\'d go along with that. You do have to worry about altitude
(motion in three dimensions) and atmospheric effects (wind and
turbulence). I suspect that grav vehicles would carry anti-
collision radar and that most "parking" spaces would carry
miniature beacons of some type for computer assisted landing.
  I expect grav vehicles to be subject to more flight regulations
(minimum/maximum altitude, flight corridors, no-fly zones,
minimum and maximum speed limits) than ground vehicles. Traffic
control in urban areas would be something of a mess.

Then why have written law at all? It seems easier to evade an
unwritten rule than one that is codified.

   I don\'t doubt that this kind of thing is *how* nobles regulate
each other\'s behavior, but I was thinking more of how they decide
what is just and fair. What standard are they using? 
Most earth governments I can think of have had some kind of
religious, ethical, or philosophical foundation for their rule:
some standard of what was "right" and "wrong".

     What does the Imperium use?
     Are there any hints beyond the emphasis on honor mentioned
in M:0 or Norris\' speeches in Survival Margin?
    I have an idea of how a belief system (not exactly a religion)
based on Terran religious concepts but not identical with any of
them could have become widespread among the Imperial nobility,
but I\'d like to at least float the idea before I develop it in
detail.

Don\'t see how this could be considered classified....  Figures given below
are for a 688-class sub; they\'re approximate, and will vary slightly up or
down as personnel transfer out after or before their reliefs report in.

    Command
       2 officers (Commanding Officer, Executive Officer)
       COB
    Navigation/Operations
       2 officers (Navigator, Communicator)
       11 comms/sensor operators
       10 nav/electronics
    Engineering
       6 officers (Engineer, 5 division officers)
       12 life-support techs
       37 propulsion/power plant techs
    Weapons
       2 officers (Weapons Officer, 1 division officer)
       8 gunners
       6 fire control
       16 sensor operators
       4 deck
    Supply
       1 officer (Supply Officer)
       3 storekeepers
       6 cooks
    Medical
       1 corpsman
    Admin
       3 yeomen
    Total
       13 officers
       118 enlisted

Notes:
   Command: The COB (known in non-submarine USN commands as the Command
Master Chief) is the senior enlisted person on the boat; his function is
mainly administrative, but I\'ve placed him here rather than with Admin.
    Nav/Ops: The sensor operators operate both active (radar) and passive
(ESM) sensors.  Navigation personnel are also responsible for
atmosphere-monitoring and interior communications equipment.
    Engineering: The "life-support techs" are the auxiliarymen, who are
responsible for most of the life-support equipment, but also own the diesel
and hydraulic plants.  The remaining personnel are the nucs, who are of
course responsible for the reactor and associated equipment, but also own
the air-conditioning and water-distilling plants.
    Weapons: The "gunners," of course, are torpedomen; they have four
torpedo tubes, with up to 22 reloads.  (Later boats - 719 on - also have 12
VLS tubes, with no reloads.)  The sensor operators are the sonar girls, who
again operate both active and passive sensors.  Deck division is composed
of the most junior personnel on board - non-rated seamen who are "striking"
for one of the other divisions on board, and will work full-time for that
division after they are advanced to PO3.
    Supply: Storekeepers are responsible for ordering spare/replacement
parts and supplies (except for food), and stowing on-board spares.  Cooks
order and stow food, as well as cooking it.  Newly-reported junior
personnel (PO2 or lower) who have not previously "cranked" will spend up to
120 days working for the cooks - washing dishes, waiting on tables, veg
prep, and other "KP"-like duties.
    Medical: The corpsman - usually a PO1 or CPO - takes care of routine
medical/sanitation matters in port, and emergency medical/dental work at
sea.  Anyone who needs the attention of a real MD is referred to a shore
facility.
    Officers: The CO is a CDR, the XO a LCDR.  Department heads are LCDRs
or LTs.  (The Eng and Nav are most likely to be LCDRs; the Chop - Supply
Officer - is almost invariably an LT.)  Division officers are LTs, LTJGs,
or Ensigns.

Drake\'s *Starliner* is another really good one.  It\'s set on an
interstellar liner (the main characters are ship\'s officers), and there are
these two old coots who keep telling wildly improbable tales about their
past adventures....

Actually, with the exception of aerobatic (stunt) planes and some
modern fighters, airplanes *are* designed to be inherently stable.
That\'s how a plane with no pilot can fly for hundreds of miles, and
only crash when it hits turbulence, runs out of fuel, or flies into
something. 

Ask anybody who has had even a *little* pilot training. *Flying* is the
easy part. At least in normal weather. Taking off is tricky, and
landing is *hard*.

Well, there *is* another problem. I forget to mention it in my other
post on stability. But since stability depends on the relationship
betwen the center of gravity (CG) and center of pressure (CP), how you
*load* a grav vehicle make a *big* difference. 

Since the shape of the vehicle is constant, the CP location is fixed.
But the CG depends on the mass distribution inside the vehicle. Load
too much *heavy* cargo into the back of a grav vehicle and it\'ll be
unflyable. Even a slight breeze will put it into a spin or a tumble.

Computer controls and variable direction thrusters can only do so much
to compensate for that sort of thing. 

So flying a passenger vehicle isn\'t going to be too bad. But flying a
*cargo* vehicle is going to require the skills of a loadmaster to make
sure you balance out the moment arms of all the cargo. (Moment arm
=distance from normal CG times mass of item). 

This can be *real* fun if you have a lot of heavy items, and they have
to be dropped off individually at different locations. Say drops of
weapons or ammo to groups of soldiers in a combat zone. Unless you get
*really* lucky, you\'ll either have to fly with a partial load (so you
can get at all the items without shifting others), or land, unload the
item *plus others*, and then rearrange the load so that you\'ll be
stable before take off. Not a fun thing to do under fire. :-)

Even if the vehicle *can* compensate for the badly offcenter load,
you\'ll have to *tell* the computer the locations and mass of the cargo.
Which, again, means a delay after each drop to tell the computer that
the distribution has changed (NOT something you want to try in mid air)

Worse, I bet that on all but the fancier military vehicles, the
computer will want you to give it the size and weight of all the items,
and then it will tell you how to place them for the best weight
distribution. Civilian vehicles would *definitely* be that way, so as
to avoid liability for crashes when some idiot misloaded his air-raft. 
And of course, this means that when you remove an item, the computer is
liable to *insist* that you re-arrange the cargo. 

I think I *like* this. It makes sense, it\'s technically accurate, and
it\'s *exactly* the sort of detail that will drive the players *nuts* at
some critical moment. :-)

Oh yeah, this also means that most grav vehicles that either carry a
*lot* of people, or carry much cargo will have a scale built into the
floor at one or more of the doors/hatches. For a bit extra, you add a
laser scanner to record the dimensions of the cargo items. That speeds
things up a bit.

So after everyone gets on board, the pilot may tell a few passengers to
swap seats based on the weight the computer recorded for them. Sort of
like a car a friend used to have. The friend weighed around 250, and so
did a couple of the folks who rode in it frequently. And it was a
small, *light* car. So we had to arrange the passengers carefully. You
*don\'t* want to have a 300 pounder in the back seat on the driver\'s
side and another as the driver. Make a quick turn to the left and the
car will wind up on its side! :-)

> 1. Of what material are modern (TL 7-8) vacc suits composed of?

Various materials. They have several layers. There\'s a cooling garment
(think of long underwear with fine tubing woven thru it) worn more or
less against the skin. This has water circulated thru it to carry
excess heat to the cooling unit in the backpack.

Next is a gas membrane layer which is basicly a mix of some synthetic
fiber and a rubber of some sort (probably synthetic rubber or even
silicone rubber). 

Over this is an abrasion garment, made of some *tough* synthetic fiber.
It\'s purpose it to keep you from rubbing holes in the pressure garment.

Finally, there may be an additional layer of sunshade/micrometeorite
garment. This is both to reflect excess sunlight (which is why it\'s
white) and to stop dust grain sized meteors *before* they impacr the
inner layers. 

The suits used on the Shuttle tend to skip the cooling garment (and
rely on forced air circulation) as well as have the layers fastened
together at the various "seals" which are much like the one for the
helmet. The abrasion garment still goes over the outside seperately.

You see, the shuttle suits, rather than being custom built for each
astronaut are composed of a series of interchangeable parts in several
sives. So you have several sizes of glove, boot, arm, leg, and the two
body segments (which join at the waist). 

> 2. What material advances might be postulated for higher-tech vacc suits?

Materials may get somewhat lighter/stronger. But the abrasion garment
and/or micrometeor/sunshade *have to be somewhat thick and heavy due to
their *purpose*. 

The big advance will be if we ever find a *practical* means of using
so-called "skin suits". These replace the pressure garment, the
cooiling suit *and* the cooiling unit, with a form fitting elastic
leotard sort of garment. 

The leotard is *not* gas tight. It relies on the fact that *skin* is
gas tight. The leotard merely supplies the required *pressure* on the
skin to counter the internal pressure. For cooling, sweat works *very*
well in a vacuum. So your body can handle cooling on its own. No need
for artificial assistance. 

The big problems with skin suits (which were first worked on in the
*50s*!) are two-fold. First, because the suit must fit *tightly*, they
are a *bear* to get on. They also require padding in a few places where
the body is concave instead of convex. Otherwise they can\'t prevent the
skin from rupturing there. 

The second problem is that the elastic material tends to lose its
elasticity after prolonged exposure to vacuum. That\'s one place where
future materials will be a real help. 

> 3. How do you seal a vacc suit after putting it on? I am assuming they do
> not have normal zippers.

Actually, a lot of them have perfectly normal zippers. It\'s just that
there are overlapping rubber "flaps" on the inner side. The internal
pressure pushes the flaps together, forming a seal. 

> 4. How would you seal the helmet? More importantly, how would you seal the

The normal seals for a helmet (even on a skin suit) involve the helmet
locking onto a collar. That\'s pretty much the only workable way of
doing it. 

On any suit that has air inside, you\'ve got the "balloon" problem. The
pressure garment wants to make like a balloon. And *bending* any of the
joints is a problem because that reduces the volume of the "balloon"
and thus increases pressure. That means that you have to exert a fair
amount of force to make the joints bend. And worse, if you try having a
"neck joint" rather than the collar and helmet setup, you can\'t turn
your head or even look up/down easily. 

It *is* doable (look at a USAF high altitude suit sometime), but it
isn\'t easy.

BTW, one problem they *still* haven\'t solved is waste disposal. Urine
is easy to deal with for men. You use an external catheter (basicly a
reinforced rubber with a tube attached to the tip, and some adhesive
strips to hold it in place). For women, it\'s rather more painful, since
the last I heard they still had to use an *internal* catheter (a
plastic tube inserted into the urethra and going on into the bladder). 

If you need to defecate, you do it beforehand, or if you are on a long
duration excursion (for example, the Apollo astronauts on the Lunar
surface) you use a *diaper*. Yes, disposable diapers are a spin-off of
the Apollo program! Ditto for the disposable wipes. 

This is a problem that *really* doesn\'t have a good solution. And it\'ll
take some *really* creative thinking to come up with one. If you can
find one, the entire astronaut corps will thank you.

BTW, *now* you know why the Mercury and Gemini missions used the "low
residue" foods. Because they *couldn\'t* take off those suits during the
flight!

If you decide that the problem *isn\'t* solvable, I want to watch when
you inform your players of this little known detail of extended vacc
suit operations. :-)

I forget the title, but Drake has done a book that is basicly the
"Jason and the Argonauts" legend with the serial numbers filed off.
He *likes* re-writing myths. And he does a good job of it.

Andre Norton\'s old SF juveniles are a good source of ideas too. Ditto
for a lot of Poul Anderson\'s stuff from the 50s & 60s. But Norton was
*definitely* one of the inspirations for Traveller. Free Traders,
Scouts, Forerunners (the Ancients, except that Norton has there be
many, *many* races and cultures before the current races). 

Just off the top of my head:

"Catseye": illegally exploring a Forerunner installation that isn\'t as
	dead as was thought.
"Storm over Warlock" and the sequel: First In Scouts, people trying to
	swipe stuff from a world that\'s red zoned because the Scouts
	are still trying to deal with the psionic natives.
"Night of Masks": a kidnapping job, an interesting planet.
"The Zero Stone" and sequels: Interstellar jewel trade, forerunner
	artifacts, several interesting worlds cultures as you trade for
	jewels.
"Dread Piper": a war vet comes home, tries to warn folks that their
	world isn\'t all that safe, gets rejected, winds up looking for
	forerunner artifacts in a series of lava caves (NEAT
	background!) and having to find a way out with a bunch of
	helpless civilians.

And of course, the entire "Solar Queen" series.

Not necessarily. Wheels can get over some moderately rugged terrain.

Well, I was watching "Ben Hur" last night (I\'ve been fond of it ever
since it was released) and I noted that the various "fanfares" and
marches in it and other "Roman" type films of the period might be
useful as background too. 

They are *different* from the more modern stuff, but still convey that

You don\'t have to worry about stalls, because they are caused by an
angle of attack such that the lift forces go away. And a grav vehicle
isn\'t using aerodynamic lift.

But spins *are* possible.  Anything moving at high speed thru the air
can create an unstable airflow by either poor design or violent
manuevers. At which point it will tumble, spin, etc.

The "trick" is that since the "thrust" is always in the *same*
direction RELATIVE TO THE VEHICLE, then truly weird things can happen
if the vehicle is not inherently stable aerodynamicly. This
*regardless* of whether or not the vehicle uses lift forces to stay in
the air. 

I\'ve seen many a model rocket whose builder overlooked this do the
*most* amazing manuevers (flight path looked like a tangle of yarn!).
Grav vehicles will be no different. 

In atmosphere, anything moving at any speed worth using *does* have to
worry about aerodynamic forces. 

What happens is like this. A gust of wind, or an imperfection in the
hull creates an unbalanced aerodynamic force. This force cause the
vehicle to pivot about the center of pressure (CP) of the vehicle.
Thrust forces keep on pushing along a line thru the cemnter of gravity
(CG, aka center of mass). 

If the CG is ahead of the CP, the aerodynamic forces from a slight
deflection generate *bigger* forces in the opposite direction thus
actually cause the vehicle to "correct" back to the way it was pointing
(positive stability).

If the CG and CP are more or less in the same place then the
aerodynamic forces will turn the ship, but no compensating forces are
generated (neutral stability). Thus the ship may have a tendency to
turn in one direction or another, which you can compensate for by
correcting the way you are pointing (think of riding a bike in a strong
cross wind. You wind up angling the wheel into the wind to keep going
in the direction you want to go).

If the CG is *behind* the CP, then the forces generated by a slight
deflection generate stronger forces *in the same direction* (negative
stability). This means that any deflection force is *amplified*. And
once a deflection starts, the ship will dance all over the sky until it
runs into something or something breaks.

So flying a grav vehicle is *worse* than driving on ice. :-)

BTW, the stability of an aircraft affects the eease of manuevering.
Positive stability basically means that left to its own devices the
craft will "want" to fly in a straight line. 

Some aerobatic craft have *very* small stability margins. That\'s why
they are tricky to fly. But they do amazing stunts. 

And some modern fighters have *negative* stability and are only flyable
because of *extensive* computer control.  The computer is constantly
making *active* corrections to keep the plane flying in the direction
that the pilot wants it to. When the pilot moves a control, the
computer translates that into "he wants to go *that* way" and adjusts
the control surfaces and thrust accordingly. These can\'t be flown
without computer assistance. And the computer program has to know the
responses of the plane. You can\'t swap it into a different model of
plane and have it work. 

BTW, this is why you *don\'t* take "non-airframe" ships into atmosphere.
The ship\'s computer isn\'t programmed for the required compensation, and
in fact it may not be *possible* to both compensate for wind forces
*and* keep pieces from falling off. Remember that modern jets have run
into "microbursts" that have dropped them multiple thousands of feet in
*seconds*.

The shape is good for protecting the head and neck from falling debris,
much like the traditional fire-fighters helmet.  I always picture the space
back there being used for a small water supply, possibly some sort of food
concentrate, and batteries for the helmet\'s sensor array.

 One quick note on World Building. 

I\'ve been looking for a copy of the World Builder\'s handbook for quite a
while. So for Christmas the wife bought me a copy of World Tamers
handbook, a TNE book. Much to my surprise when I opened and starting
reading the system generation section it\'s all in D6, the credits list
material taken for World Builders handbook and Joe D. Fugate Sr.Now I\'m
not sure, since I don\'t have the original, but I suspect this is a
direct or slightly modified version of the MT book. It appears to be
perfectly compatable with GT and the information generated is certainly
cross platform enough to use. In additon the sections on servey,
colonial economics, and bootstrap operations can easily be moved to
other Millieu.

My point? I don\'t know if this book is any more easily available than
the MT World Builder\'s book, but it\'s another that people interested in
this area should look for. Also, a second point the maybe Marc or Bloo
can answer? Since the material appears in this book can it be re used
without problems with the new owner of DGP, or was World Builder\'s a GDW
publication? In other words could the information be re printed with the
new (hoefully soon!) publication of Trav?

        Hi, Phil...

        I am sorry, to me this isn\'t a problem...  Nobody in their right
mind accelerates at an enemy when conducting missle/ torpedo engagements...
PC vessel should have done a "Fire-Turn-Burn" manuever and had proximity
fused, radar-triggered warheads.  The weapons go off as soon as they start
to "open" on the target, and the Bad Guy missiles are now playing
hypotenuse-catch-up with the player ship.

        Of course, if you are playing table-top ship engagements using
counters, and the players are stupid, then, sure...  they get killed.  Just
like every other bad tactician in history.  Which is the reason I *don\'t*
use counters for ship combat.  You gotta presume that if a character has a
Gunnery 2 and Pilot 2, that he is up to scratch on combat tactics and will
fight the ship to the fullest of their ability and knowledge...  Knowledge
the player most likely doesn\'t have.
        Unless you want to spend *a lot* of time doing "simulator"
engagements until the layers are reasonably savvy with the way the whole
thing plays...  and then *they\'ll* be trying your maneuver on the Bad Guy.

I\'ve got two sorts of skin suits IMTU a standard tech model and a
"nanotech" model.  The players may run into the nanotech model, but
it isn\'t commonly available. 

IMTU, standard skin suits are an expensive alternative to the
standard vacc suit.  They are put on in a "relaxed" mode and are
"tightened" slowly, and in segments, after the wearer dons them.
While the suit tightens, wrinkles can be smoothed out and the
padding adjusted for a proper fit.  They provide good short term
protection, but you still need what amounts to a standard vacc suit
over it for extended use outside.

The skin suit has a hood that extends up and over the head and ears.
Plugs are inserted into the ears with integral hearing aids that can
connect to suit radios.  The face mask is clear semi-flexible
material with connectors for air and radio communication.

Waste is handled with catheters and this is one of the reasons that
they are generally for short term use, even when everything is
plugged into a longer-duration hard suit.

>The second problem is that the elastic material tends to lose its
>elasticity after prolonged exposure to vacuum. That\'s one place where
>future materials will be a real help. 

Right, that\'s why they\'re expensive, IMTU, and are specialty
products of a few select systems.

The nano version is extremely high-tech.  It is made of a
self-repairing, self-adjusting, self-sealing, color-varying
material composed of interlocking nano-machines.  The suit covers
the *entire* body, including the face, with the section over the
eyes being able to adjust from opaque to semi, (or completely)
transparent.  The part that covers the face can be "rolled up" into
a pocket on the forehead, and then pulled back down at a moment\'s
notice.  Hard plugs are built into the material for radio
connections, breathing and feeding tubes.  Waste is handled by the
material itself through storage, processing, and eventual
elimination or incorporation in the material of the suit.

A spacer with an advanced nano skin suit can wear it for months at a
time without ever taking it off.  They may wear regular clothes over
it while aboard ship or on a planet and slip into a hard suit for
extended work outside in space, but their "second skin" is as much a
part of them as is their real skin.

Of course, even these suits aren\'t perfect.  Though they eliminate
virtually all waste, their is a slow buildup of certain compounds
that smell, ie you stink after a few weeks of wear.  They also
remove body hair, leaving the wearer bald...all over, and
considerably more sun sensitive.  Extended wear of these suits also
produces distinctive marking on the skin around the face and eyes,
rings around the wrists and ankles, etc.  Finally, skin problems
from bacterial, fungal or allergen reactions are common.

I\'ve wondered about this too.  If someone has both WBH and WTH, could you tell
us how similar the two are? What is in one that is not in the other?

They don\'t share a lot of common information. 

WBH contains:
- - a discussion of how to survey worlds, including a Planetographers Checklist, 
contact procedures, etc
- - equipment descriptions for survey equipment, plus a number of DGP equipment 
sheets
- - some relevant vehicle information, plus MT stats, deckplans, pictures for 
the Donosev class survey ship
- - advanced world generation tables, taking up about half the book
- - world mapping guidelines

The world generation rules extrapolate from each of the 6 UPP stats. 

If you have WTH, then chapter 8 contains material/tables common with WBH. What 
this amounts to is:
- - some of the size related details (for density/gravity)
- - some of the atmosphere related details (for temperature)
- - some of the hydrosphere related details (for world mapping)
Note the word "some" - and bear in mind that WBH looks at all the stats.
Then you get a whole set of different rules, for colony building, mass combat, 
low-tech design, etc.

WTH is about half way between WBH and Pocket Empires. For world generation, 
I\'m afraid WBH is far far better book. But WTH has some good things in it, 
which WBH does not have (eg weather rules) and the colony building game is 
interesting.

Plus the artwork & production values of WBH are alot better.

Thanks for the quick review and bummer.

I was looking through some of my old TD\'s the other day and ran
across an article by Nancy Parker on adding cultural details to
UWP\'s.  It reminded me of what I\'ve heard is in WBH.  Was her
article pretty much what eventually went into that section of WBH?

Take a close look at the "Spinner" sequences from _Bladerunner_ (the
"Spinner" is the flying police car). The graphics on the dashboard depict a
flight corridor through the city and a landing pad on the roof of Police
Headquarters; the voice-over (very faint) gives a very convincing and

I just wanted to add in my 2 cents worth here (No religion or conspiracies
:-)
I was thinking that Urban traffic control with hover craft would work much
like
you see in the movie "The Fifth Element", or even the Jetsons cartoons
(albeit a bit too simplistic there).
Something else that came to mind on this thread, was that I imagine hover-
craft would be harder for US to fly, just as a Car would be harder for say
a 15th century teamster to drive.
However, in a world where they are common place it should be basically a
routine task. Uhm... my knowledge of Traveller comes mostly from the MT
boxed set- so if I\'m wrong in using that for a basis- please let me know.
Instead of making a hover vehicle harder to pilot than a car, I\'d just make
the TL a little higher so that lower techs (like us) have a penalty to
success
with them.

Later.

Well, another thing to keep in mind is that more revolts have been
started by the powers that be removing "customary privileges" that were

Check out the concept of "common law". In essence, that\'s one of the
things that juries exist for. Ditto for the way the "reasonable person"
standard shows up all over the place in legal decisions.

Here we get into the difference between "rule of law" and "might makes
right". There are a *lot* of governments who rule on the basis of what
they can get away with rather than what the "law" says. And a number
whose "law" was the whim of the dictator.

So you not only have to worry about the "principles" you have to worry
about how *seriously* they take them. Compare the *actions of the

"Honor" has been the principle behind a number of governments. And it
seems to work about as well as anything else.

Heck, no need for a "religion". Check out the Code of Chivalry and the
principles of Bushido.

  Sounds interesting, although the neutralization of the US aboriginals
isn\'t a subject I\'m terribly familiar with.

  Which begs the question of whether the current Western tendency
favouring secularism will survive post-I.W. and/or into the 3I. The
I.W. period (and later RoM/Solomani philosophy) could well have been
an encouragement for all sorts of New Age types of thinking

  We know that Aslan, K\'Kree, and Droyne cultures have strong mystical
underpinnings, and doubtless at least some human worlds, but what is the
overall feeling of the 3I (official or otherwise) and is there a detectable
trend towards one or the other extreme?

  FWIW, the Psionics Suppressions could very well have seen a re-emphasis
on rationalism (secular or not - but a reduced tolerance for mushy-headed
flakiness in general - like trading in derivatives? :> ), and the 5FW would
not have endeared the Zho\'s or psi\'s in general to Impie society.

        Hi, Bruce!
        I always thought that G-Vehicles were controller like snazzier
helicopters...  G-Vechiles basically showed up as a replacement for combat
helicopters, so I would presume that they would have tried to allow the
crews to transition easily....  So the collective, elavtor, etc are probably
all there.  I *think* the Apache can do 300 knots wide open (500+kph) so the
same electronics would suffice...  How fast is an F111 doing its attack runs
at NOE?  That\'s *now-tech* electronics and sensors in the attack/ NOE role.
I figure it wouldn\'t be terribly more complicated;  maybe the computer
program has a natural tendency to hover and settle if the controls aren\'t
acted upon for a certain amount of time.  
        The CF-18 has a similar concept;  if the pilot goes out cold (ie: no
joystick input) and altitude dips below 500, the computer takes over and
hauls for 10000 and flies figure-8s until the pilot takes control again. 
        Anyway, Just My Humble Opinion. =)

Okay, so I am "the bad guy" for telling the truth about a religion from
which I received an honorable release as a full-time missionary, but then a
list long-timer accuses my ancestors of incest and it is okay?

The usual double-standard, eh?

Pre-Maghiz planetary transport was virtually all gravitic in nature. The
EM pulse knocked out all of the contragrav units, causing the vehicles
to drop like rocks. After the disaster, and as a result of the massive
loss of life, all "modern" Darrian transportation has been designed as
winged craft capable of glideing in the event the contragrav fails. 

Still, I wonder, do the Darrians require that a person demonstrate
proficency at gliding in order to get an operator\'s licence? Or has this
just devolved to a qirk?

Since I was the first to ask you and Jesse to move you discussion off
list I\'d like to repy to this, this one time only. The problem wasn\'t
the initial argument. It was that YOU refused to remove it from the
list. Even after being politely asked to do so. Jesse, who may or may
not be as much to blame (not my call) did stop replying on list. Your,
increasingly hostile, replies were still on the list. 

Now many people recieve the list. It cost most money to recieve the mail
(connection time, phone time etc.). For you to continue with the
discussion that was, basically, of interest only to yourself, and Jesse,
showed an extreme lack of manners, and an incredible disreguard for
others. Because of this a single instance of name calling from one who
is normally a decent poster is, if not acceptable, at least excusable
behavior.

 Oh, one last request, if you are, indeed, here just to cause trouble,
possibly a mis-conception but one that YOU continue to foster, why not
go somewhere else? If you are here to discuss Traveller than do so.Now
if all you care to do is cause trouble you can flame me! I will not
reply to any off topic rant you may wish to send my way. i WILL gladly
discuss any Traveller related opinions you may have.

Incidentally. . .this discussion has made me think of something I ought to ask
about.

I have copies of the old Book 6, the Grand Survey/Grand Census books, the
TNE World-Tamer\'s Handbook, and a copy of Pocket Empires.  I *don\'t* have a
copy of the MT World-Builder\'s Handbook.  Am I missing any significant
material
that I should be aware of?  If so, is there anyone who would be willing to
sell me
a copy of the WBH, or let me *borrow* one for about three months?

(No promises that the GURPS book will resemble any of the above all that
closely, of course.  There are limits to how much of the DGP material I can
use anyway.  I do want to at least be aware of everything that\'s been done
along these lines for Traveller before.)

   Not necessarily even a dirty war. It\'s possible (though
difficult) to run a highly effective guerrilla campaign with very
little bloodshed.
   As for the rest, I\'d agree. IMTU, terrorists are not
imprisoned for lengthy periods: They are given a speedy trial and
either released as innocent or executed immediately. [People
arrested as terrorists are seldom found innocent the first time,
and almost never the second.]
   As a GM, you can give murdered NPCs influential friends and
relatives with a well-developed sense of vengeance and give 
trigger-happy PCs interesting lives.

   I don\'t know the figures, but the smaller and more isolated
the population, the more it is subject to genetic bottlenecks and
founder effects. You can expect to see genetic variations that
are rare or absent in most of the population to be quite common
on smaller, isolated worlds. There is also a greater range of
environments each with different selection pressures.
    I suspect that genetic mixing would tend to occur whether the
world specifically encouraged it or not. Reactions would vary,
but the "exotic spaceman lover" and  "girl in every port" would
be common themes in the TU.

    His story: [One of my girlfriends insisted on getting
married, and even then the local judge demanded a bribe of half
my savings to keep me out of jail. I couldn\'t get out of there
fast enough.] 
   Her story: [Well, my son is a little odd, but you see I fell
in love with a spaceman when I was young and foolish...I even
married him.  He left me a nice dowry and a living breathing
memory, but of course he never came back.  I remarried a few years
later, and my new husband raised the boy like his own flesh and
blood.]

It is a very old story.  Laban was the farmer with the shotgun and Jacob was
the Marine.

    'body' => 'Some thoughts:
In the MA nobility was \'nobilified\' by a form of social contract: the peasants
gave their surplus and were protected therefore. The noble went to war for his
peasants. Those were the times of the all-mighty mounted Knight.
With the decline of the Cavalry and the knight (due to the introduction of
Pikemen, Longbowmen) the importance of this diminished also. But the Nobles
retained their
status and privileges. Therefore over the next centuries the nobles either
moved on to 
new business like in England, were they became powerful Merchants or pre-
capitalists or like in France sticked to their old way of living and became
more and more parasitical [which btw was one of the triggers of the French
Revolution]. 

For the Imperial nobility I assume that it is mostly constituted of families
of great wealth and social influence (e.g. the kennedys, or Rothschilds ),
meaning that they
have a real power base and a social one (family members in important positions
etc.)
Because of the dynastical intertwixations (excuse this neologism), most
families better stick to the rules of the nobiliy (i.g. honor etc.). Another
factor are the obligations to the public: as a chief employer and political
leader the noble better have public support, or who is going to buy his
products ! And if a noble violated social norms and conventions his social
might would be destroyed (e.g. the belief in
the \'rightness\' of being ruled by nobles and the trust they are given could
easily be
destroyed by ruthless exploitation of the subjects, or severe misbehaviour
(for example something like Clinton+Monica ...Ok Clinton is still in political
power, but his social/ethical power seems to be nonexistent if you know what I
mean...
Of course there are those nobles who are evil or ruthless...but to be
succesfull the noble is far better off by to meet social and political
standards...even Dulinor cared
well for HIS people...they were his powerbase after all...
Conclusion:
Nobles act noble because the society which supports them expects them to do
so.

Please comment on those theses :-)

seriously; I think that bigotry will supercede biologically based logic. On

Actually, they are easier to get on (and off) than the hard suits,
which cannot be donned unaided. There were tests done on this, there\'s
an article about the Paul Webb suit ( "The Space Activity Suit",
Aerospace Medicine, 39:379, April 1968).

There seems to be no obvious reason why NASA chose the hard suit
option,  the skin suits were cheaper (about  $750 supposedly in 1980
terms) , easier to work in, less bulky, safer ( a hole was far less
catastrophic than the overpressure suits), they didn\'t need the fancy
joints the overpressure suits need.

The best guess is that Webb didn\'t have the appropriate "political"
support.

>They also require padding in a few
>places where the body is concave instead of convex.
>Otherwise they can\'t prevent the skin from rupturing there.

In Webb\'s suit they were rubberized nylon bags of specific shape. The
bags are sealed, and thus expand in a vacuum to provide the neccessary
pressures to the "concave" bits.

>The skin suit has a hood that extends up and over the head and ears.

The Webb SAS had a ring built in around the neck with a clear plastic
bubble filled with oxygen at a pressure of 170mg of Hg , just like in
all the \'50s magazine covers !

>>The second problem is that the elastic material tends to lose its

This was no problem in Webb\'s 1968 suit, the materiel is Spandex, it
was the old rubber suits of the 40\'s that had a brittleness problem.

Supposedely $750 each in 1980\'s dollars, but buildable by a small
metalwork shop and a seamstress given the Spandex and the plastic.

Spandex, trying to get one built in a "seamstress\' shop" of the

 I just cannot stand his narrowmindedness, I know I should forgive him, but
I cannot.

But, if you want it, I forgive you...  *weg*

Btw, should we not change the term "Flame" to "FGMP-15 Blast" or "Plasma
Blast"?  This is the TML after all & we do not have flame throwers, but we

I have Grand Census and WBH but not Grand Survey. If anyone has a copy of 
Grand Survey for sale I\'d be very interested.
Judging by a comparison of Grand Census and WBH, I\'d say there\'s probably very 
little value add when you go from GS/GC to WBH. Someone said elsewhere that 
the Donosev stuff was new ... that would make sense, since I think GS/GC were 
CT books, whereas WBH is an MT book, and therefore the ship is MT. Since the 
vehicle stuff is also MT stats this is probably also new, but you\'re probably 
talking about 6 pages max.

No. The culture stuff (which came from Grand Census previously) is:

Population - 
determine number and size of cities
determine social outlook - 3 vectors - progressiveness, aggressiveness, 
extensiveness
determine local customs - 6 large tables

Government -
determine structure of government
religious profile (optional!)

Law -
uniformity of law (who does the law level apply to)
legal profile (breaks down law level to 5 subcategories)

Technology -
technology profile - breaks down tech level to 14 categories

The Nancy Parker stuff is a good complement to this, although there\'s no 
intrinsic method to tie the two together, so any anomalies either have to be 
weeded out manually, or be subjected to the usual handwaving.

Depends on the ship\'s intended function.  A warship, which requires a
lot of surface area for sensors and power plant radiators (especially
for Basic, Advanced, or Extreme Masking), may be better served with the
Wedge configuration.  Another ship, with a mission profile that requires
an Airframe hull, would be cheapest as either a Needle or Dome/Disc
configuration, and couldn\'t be built with a Box configuration hull.  If
the naval architect\'s primary concern is armor protection, then a Sphere
provides the least surface area, thus requiring less total mass of armor
to achieve a given thickness.  This then allows for reasonable maneuver
performance with less powerful drives, thus requiring less power plant,
thus being cheaper.  (BTW, this is a major factor in the Impregnable
Beach-Ball From Hell school of naval architecture.)  Keep in mind also
that, for most ships, the price of the hull is relatively insignificant,
when compared to the price of the systems within that hull.  (The
preceding applies to T4 ship construction [any system].)

Under HG, a Close Structure configuration ship (the closest one to Box)
is only partially streamlined, and thus cannot land (although it can
skim fuel from a gas giant).  Only the Needle/Wedge and Cone
configurations are fully streamlined.  Further, the Needle/Wedge
configuration is one of the best hull forms for resisting meson gun
hits.  Only Dispersed Structure and Buffered Planetoid resist meson guns
better, and neither of those are streamlined at all.

Besides, even in warship design, esthetic considerations are a concern. 
In order best to show the flag, a warship should _look_ like a warship. 
IMHO, a Wedge configuration warship presents a much more imposing
presence than does a Box ship.

Heinlien, of course.  And I like his stuff *mostly* before \'The Number of the

Betsy Moon you can keep.  R.L. Meluch can outwrite her any day of the week.  
And I have zero problems with Chalker\'s lust of biotechnology.

Nope.  They were in Grand Survey, too.  I intend to check with management

Well, Joe gave me permission to xerox out-of-print material, and as Roger
Sanger hasn\'t bothered to revoke it I assume it\'s still valid, therefore I
_could_ copy mine for you at cost.

Figure a hundred pages at 5 per page, plus $2-3 for shipping.

I\'m not a geneticist, but I\'ve researched this and posted the results from
time to time. Anyone who wants more detailed citations should check the
archives about five months ago.

Short answer: a controlled breeding population of 50 is sufficient for a
short (one generation) bottleneck; for 10 generations, at least 500 is
preferable. Controlled breeding means equal numbers of offspring per parent
and per generation; double the numbers (100 or 1,000) if this is not
possible. This is breeding population -- double again (approximately) to
account for normal age distributions in humans. This population is just
sufficient to avoid infertility and extinction due to inbreeding (most of
the research was done on endangered species). The final loss of genetic
variability from the original sample population is about 40-50%.

These figures improve rapidly as the population increases. By the time the
total population reaches 10,000, they don\'t experience any noticeable loss
of genetic variation over a couple of millenia. The comments above about
founder and selection effects are spot on, as well.

Pardon this intrusion into an obviously private conversation
on a distributed list. 
</sarcasm>
I don\'t care about who is narrow minded or if the TRUTH gets 
out. What I do care about, is that I don\'t subscribe to this 
list for this non-traveller blathering and finger pointing.
Find the right forum for your topic. Please take this where 
it belongs, private mail.

OB Traveller: Obviously this kind of mail list would not 
be possible in a multi-world political entity. So, they 
might exist on a planetary level. How would a list of 
folks with similar interests work this over jump distace?
Arrainge for two or more planetary lists to be updated
from X-boats bringing last weeks messages from the quilting
list on Ruie to your world and then your replies taking
a long time getting back? Or would that kind of thing not 
be worth the effort?

  I have TNE basic rules (for extended system generation); World
Tamers Handbook, and I get some useful info from Path of Tears as
well. I also have  T4 Pocket Empires and Imperial Squadrons, and
I\'m trying to get my hands on Psionics Institutes (My FLGD still
had it, waiting for me to cough up the cash last time I checked.)
I use everything I have from time to time.
  Scouts and WBH are somewhat OOP, aren\'t they? I\'ve seen Scouts,
but I have very little CT material and not much more MT. I think
I\'ve read Worldbuilding (That\'s the one by Orson Scott Card,
isn\'t it?), and it has the concepts, but no mechanics.
  I used to play AD&D but gave that up some time ago. While I was
looking for published worldbuilding info I ran across the WBG
which has some nice sections on Kingdoms and Sociology, and
Cities and provinces. It gives lots of nice "Pick one or roll if
you don\'t care" tables, and it\'s integrated so you can build your
world top down or bottom up or some combination, and it will
still hang together.  Its big weaknesses are that 1) it is too
much oriented toward the fantasy multiverse of AD&D 2) it deals
strictly with low tech (TL0 3) societies, and 3) it gives too
little hard enconomic information for the would be merchants and
credheads among us.
   A further problem is that the mechanics (and sometimes
results) of all these sources are incompatible. A while ago I saw
a post from someone who had tried to scale up the economics rules
of WTH (far too cumbersome for my taste) and didn\'t like the
results.  And all these *still* don\'t fully cover the territory.
   I\'m just self confident enough to offer to write the thing
using as much existing Traveller material as I can get my hands
on if someone would offer to pay me for it. <g>

It seems to me that "common law" depends even more on how
persuasive your lawyer is than statute law, although IANAL and I
could be wrong.

I\'m not impressed by the long lifetimes of governments built on
the whim of a dictator. "Might makes right" style governments
tend to create resentments that bring down the strong man\'s
weaker successors in short order.  I\'d take the USSR as an
example of what can happen when you try to build a stable
government on a principle of "good is what serves the party",
rather than a model for Imperial longevity.

>"Honor" has been the principle behind a number of governments.

IIUC, Chivalry seems to be based on Christianity plus remnants of
Germanic and Roman warrior ethic.
Bushido is connected with Shinto (japanese religion), isn\'t it?

IMTU, an early Rule of Man philospher (I haven\'t named him yet)
studied Terran belief systems searching for ethical principles
that were common to the various religions of earth. (codes of
Chivalry and principles of Bushido would have been among those he
studied)  His writings were persuasive and reasonably well-adapted 
to the realities of Interstellar society; so much so that he was called the
24th century Confucius.

  "Fireships", IIRC. Pretty good, and enough action/intrigue/character
development to suit, too. Having then read a comprehensive life of Sir
Francis Drake I could see where almost all of the events in the novel
came from; I\'m quite glad that I didn\'t read the history first, though.

  Shouldn\'t that be "Revisionist History"? :)

you can tell, somehow, that doug has actual infantry experience...while
armchair electronics designers like me suggested filling it with 
irrelevant and impractical electronics.

The only question is whether the armour was designed by actual infantry
or by theoreticians...

SHIP DESCRIPTION

Glisten\'s current defense philosophy depends on force projection: rather
than concentrate their resources entirely on system defense botas, the
governing council has chosen to invest in several squadrons of long-range
cruisers for joint patrol operations with the Imperial Navy (thus also
guaranteeing that the Glisten Home Fleet will be kept fully informed of
any emerging hostilities). 

The Defiance cruisers are the latest class of warship commissioned under
this philosophy. While not the largest ships in the fleet, they are the
newest and competition for a berth is fierce among ambitious junior
officers.

Rob, thanks for posting these designs, they are great inspiration.  This
one\'s got me confused, though.  Why use only 79.5 of the 100 spaces
available in the hull?  

It seems to me that what you have now is an advanced X-Boat.  If it\'s
really intended to carry commercial cargo on semi-scheduled runs across the
Rift, at least give it another 20 tons of cargo space and some low berths
for passengers who just can\'t wait or have to accompany their cargo.  That
will knock the acceleration down a bit, but that may not be an issue.

Alternatively, if it\'s really a fast courier, consider that it might also
have to carry VIPs or time-sensitive cargoes, in which case, its real space
acceleration may be important.  I\'d suggest adding a second stateroom, four
low berths (one module), another ton of cargo to accommodate a standard
cargo container (IMTU, I plan to use the ones from the Traveller
Adventure), and as much maneuver drive as possible I think that gives a
total of 16 maneuver modules, with an approximate acceleration of 6g.   
Total cost does go up, but only by about 5 MCr, or 14 percent.  In
exchange, you get a much more flexible ship that can shave a few more hours
off a critical transit.

There you have it.

Warships are supposed to be big shiny wedges.

9) Economic structure. The trade class and TL give only a very
vague idea of what the principal industries on a world might be.
(UWP is C303422-B...Can the players expect fresh bananas if they
ever come here? What about vac suits? Spare parts for a grav
belt?) A way to estimate the volume and type of major imports and
exports and how busy the starport should be would be nice. What
are the common vocational skills?
*****************
I usually use the following to work out available services, remembering
that on low pop planets 75% of the pop. is usually close to the starport
and all the major services are.

It\'s surprising what you can pack into 144 pages if you do it
right.

Is it OK if I throw in some more detailed suggestions, then?
   1) For detailing stars, update the tables that give
luminosities and themperatures for various stellar classes. TNE, 
WTH, and presumably WBG give old classes and figures.  The
temperature, luminosity, and mass of stars almost have to be
given in a table. A full length version would probably be too
long, but an abridged version would need some interpolation
rules. For the extended system, more icy moons in the outer
system.
   2) The calculation of temperatures on a planet look a bit
squirrely to me. RW world temperatures include factors for
albedo, or the amount of light reflected. Maybe you could
simplify things on the other hand by giving just one table for
atmosphere/greenhouse effect instead of two?
   I would be interested in how the base temperature varies with
season or time of day, instead of just having minima and maxima.
I don\'t know how well founded WTH\'s scheme for variation of
temperature with latitude is.
   Also, I find in myself a tendency to be *too* bound by the
rules. A reminder that RW numbers are seldom exactly as given in
the tables would be in order. Designers should feel free to vary
the factors within limits in order to fit the design concept. For
that reason, if tables are computed with a formula, give the
formula as well.
   3) Climate zones should be determined in connection with
temperature ranges and the local presence of hydrographics.
Weather might also be included along with climate.
   4) For mapping and Terrain types, I\'d like to see two levels
of design. The first level would be the physical type (e.g.
plain, hilly, mountainous, cratered, or sea)  with rough
indicators of altitude or depth. Altitude modifiers based on
world gravity and weather factors.
   5) the second level would be the "ground cover" or vegetation
type. This should be determined separately and would depend on
both climate zone and physical terrain.
   6) The "terrain types" given for the animal generation tables
in TNE and T4 are a combination of physical type and ground
cover. These could be kept or even extended a little.

That\'s probably the best answer I\'ve heard.
   How do nobles who realize this keep their children from taking
their privileges for granted, so that the next generation or few
doesn\'t degenerate into selfish exploiters?
   It seems to me that noble families train their children almost
from birth in both the theory and practice of "nobility", or the
conduct that is expected of them if they are to retain the
support of the people.
   It\'s said that there is nothing so practical as a good theory,
and so I was thinking of the moral or ethical "theory" that
guides how children are taught and trained. Of course, this
"theory" is reinforced by social expectation and as the
consequences of observance and violation of the "principles" are
seen.

I want to update (and slightly rearrange) the Traveller FAQ on
Freelance Traveller.  Your help would be appreciated.  The
following questions are being added:

- - What is Traveller?

	This one requires your help.  Certainly, everyone who plays
    it, reads it, or writes for it has their own idea - but
    there\'s a common thread that runs through it.  Saying
    "Traveller is a science-fiction role playing game" isn\'t
    really adequate; it doesn\'t distinguish Traveller from the
    other SFRPGs out there.

- - Who/what is GDW?

	Dates? Principals? Origins? Origins of Traveller involvement?

    What else?

- - Who/what is DGP?

	See "Who/what is GDW?"

I want to revise the following question, and reorganize the
portion of the FAQ pertaining to it:

- - What products have already been released?

	Clearly, a reference to BITS Traveller Bibliography is
    warranted here.  What doesn\'t it cover (i.e., what\'s come out
    since it was written/published)?  Especially important:
    what\'s in print vs. what\'s out of print.  My intent is to
    have separate pages for each licensee.  I also need an update
    on what BITS products are out there.

More Info Needed for this question:

- - When will [insert product here] be released?

	Can anyone point me to the GURPS Traveller release schedule? 
    Marc, any comment on T5?  Like when, and who?

BITS and SJGames - what\'s the \'sales territory\' for SJGames?  US
only?  US/Canada?  The world except Europe?  Responsible FAQ
maintainers need to know!

General question:  What other changes, if any, should be made in
the Traveller FAQ? (if you need to check the FAQ to see what\'s
currently there, visit Freelance Traveller at
http://come.to/FreelanceTraveller and follow the links to the
Information Center, then the FAQ.  Or, point your browser at
either http://w3.execnet.com/jeffz/infocenter/faq.html or

Really.  Assuming Marc Miller and the folks at SJ Games don\'t object 
violently to the first draft when I get it to them.

Hmmmm.  Ever write a gaming supplement?

You run out of pages *fast*.  Fortunately the draft thus far seems to be
coming in on page budget without too much oversimplification.

Done.  There are actually ways to simplify this nicely, for main-
sequence stars at least, without giving up too much realism.

You need the albedo to do it right.  Oddly enough, I think I may have
found an error in the old average-surface-temperature formulae.  At
least my astrophysics text has a different formula. . .and the implications
of the difference aren\'t trivial.  I need to verify my facts, though.

My meteorology is a bit wobbly, so I may stick close to the WTH
approach.

Done, in a number of cases.  One of the biggest quarrels I always had
with the old systems was the way all stars of a given spectral class
had *exactly* the same mass, luminosity, and so on -- and all planets
in orbit 2 were at *exactly* the same distance from the primary.  Made
it a bit hard to come up with planets of a arbitrary climate type around
any star. . .

Hey, that\'s a neat idea.  I think I\'ll use it.

I\'ll see what I can do.  All good suggestions. . .

        I am in a medieval recreation/ recreation group, and one concept you
hear a lot of is "obligee de noblesse"...  Roughly, "the Obligations of
Nobility".  Another way to put it, is that "Nobility is as Nobility does".
While the class structure makes for feeling of removal from the general
populace, one is constantly aware that actions of the one affect the lives
of the many.  How much this awareness affects ones actions is the difference
between a beloved Crown and a despised despot.  IMHO.

According to a number of sources the primary  motive  unit  of  a
Dalek is a half meter diameter  sphere  which  functions  like  a
wheel (moved using magnetic fields), with gyroscope balance units
to keep the edges of  the  shell  off  the  ground.  The  limited
levitating ability is not  documented,  but  the  fact  that  the
sphere unit cannot traverse rough ground is (thus, as preveiously
stated, even the originals must have  had  a  \'secondary\'  motive
unit).

I\'m going to be out-of-contact for the next week ... maybe during
that time I\'ll try and come up with a  Dalek  design  using  Trav
rules.  Maybe I\'ll even come up with a RICE -style paper on  this
race.  No promises.

I\'d follow the 16th century scientific journal model. The early
versions resembled the digest version of a mailing list (without
the redundancy). You would have a "sponsor" in one of the larger
planets collect reports from various correspondents and issue
them in compiled form.  Another center might have its own
journal, possibly with a slightly different focus. Some people
would subscribe to more than one of them.  Each journal would
subscribe to important neighboring journals and echo or at least
mention the most important results.

The first had few air vehicles, you got to see flight control from inside

    'body' => 'Armoured Car (Tech Level 8)

   The vehicle has a crew of 3 (driver, gunner, commander) and carries one
passenger.
Its turret mounts an autocannon and a medium machinegun in a single mount,
with direct fire control. Height: 1.25 m (+ turret 0.5 m). Width: 2.2 m.
Length: 4.25 m. Total Volume: 10.43 m^3. Weight: 7.0 tons. Flotation: yes.
Ground pressure = 25. Price: Cr43,465.

 Movement: Road, 189 kph/157 cm; cross-country, 38 kph/31 cm; water 9 kph/ 8 cm.
 Movement Effects on Fire: Move half or less, no effect; Move more than
half, -4 EFP.
 Armour: Chassis front, 26; chassis sides/back, 12; deck, 6; belly, 2;
turret front
24; turret sides/back, 17.
 Target Size DM\'s: +1 low, +1 high.
 Equipment: Sealed environment. One ton (1.0 m^3) of cargo.
 Power: 0.81 megawatt MHD turbine consumes 243 liters of fuel per hour; fuel
capacity is 651 liters, enough for 2.7 hours. P/W ratio is 94; vehicle is Light.
 Weapons: see medium machinegun on table, page 36. Basic load is 3000 rounds.

  The autocannon is single-barrel, 25mm, hyper-velocity with electric action. It
engages 4 targets, with a ROF of 40. Only a KEAP (solid shot) round is rated:

                 Effective          Long           Extreme 
2.5 cm A/C      2000 m +3 (16)  3000 m +2 (14)  4500 m +1 (12)

 (Personal armour below TL 14 is pretty irrelevant to a hit from this; if
a CT damage value were somehow desired then roughly 8D would be reasonable.
A limb hit might be subject to a limit of 4-6 D while destroying the area.)

  Rounds weigh 0.6 kg each. Only KEAP is supplied, at Cr 6 each.
Capacity is 750 rounds, enough for 18 turns of fire.


  Design notes: Yet another design without electronics; the wargame we were
playing generalized units by TL, after their other stats and PV were worked
out using the design sequences. Add whatever amuses you. The vehicle price
doesn\'t include ammo - add Cr 8,100 for a basic load for both weapons. The
vehicle isn\'t subject to catastrophic results from ammo hits, and is meant
to hunt light AFV\'s while using the GPMG to discourage stalkers.

  It\'s pretty much intended for security or contact/courier duties rather
than serious recon or scout duties; as a straight paramilitary gun-carrier
no more than two occupants would be necessary.

  As the chassis ("low") profile is over four times greater than the turret
("high") this might be a good unit to rate as +0 high - the target is about
of man-sized area, and smaller vertically.

  If the turret is de-installed (remove armament, box; remove turret casting)
then the whole can be crated up at around 1 Dt, with little bracing for 5 st.
The turret is 1.8 x 2.0, with all faces moderately sloped; the hull has only
a radical front slope.

Viable is a hard term.  Many populations have small
diversity and are "viable" under most definitions of
the word.  Many island populations have very little
genetic diversity and may have been formed by 
less people that you can squeeze into a mini-van.
Problems with low genetic diversity do occur, but
once the population has culled the "defects" out 
of it\'s gene pool it can inbreed its way to a happy
homogeneous mass of humanity.  Then again, there
are dangers on a lack of diversity.  Look at what 
happened to the Native Americans when they 
encountered European diseases.

Modern science has not hard on this issue.  Most
geneticists peg the "good breeding stock" numbers 
from 500-5000.

  If you assume that a large group would mostly be interested in new
research rather than general discussion then most traffic on other
lists would of no real use due to the time lag.

  A sufficiently small group (and scholars or professionals in many
fields on lower pop worlds would likely count) could try and write
a report or digest on their discussion threads after they finished
with them and distribute them to nearby worlds with similar groups.

  A small group on a low pop world might be fairly close in effect to
the same type of group on a high-pop world; to keep traffic manageable
the hi-pop culture would likely have vastly differentiated lists, and
at the upper end fairly restrictive in membership. While a lower-pop
world might not have as many brilliant or elite contributors, that would
not rule out meaningful input.

The hull is an infintessimally small proportion of the total ship cost for
most ships, even civilian ones.

In my opinion, there are two sorts of ships - the ones that minimise their
surface area (spheres), and the ones that maximise their length (needles).

You adopt a sphere if you want thickest armour for the lowest overhead, and
you adopt a needle if you want the maximum length for the biggest possible
spinal mount.

Open frame works for battlerider tenders, but they arent really warships
(you keep them wayyyyy to the rear).

The theory is hinted in the T4 rulebook:
p.7 "Duty, honor and loyality:
       Interstellar society values people (human or not) it can depend on.
       Those who are loyal and faithfully serve their duty are the ones to 
       shoulder important responsibilities, and a natural nobility arises from
       those innovative leaders of society who unwaveringly and honorably
       follow the orders of their superiors."
And in MT it is stated that Nobles raise their childreen indeed to follow even
local traditions (the nobles of Cogri are blinded at birth because of local
custom etc.)
The T4 explanations is a bit to blue-eyed for me...dont forget that nobles
represent
the interests of  their subjects and sometimes most important the economy of
their
\'lands\' (planets). A noble has two obligations: To the Iridium Throne and to
his \'Lands\'
...sometimes those interests collide...most drastic example: Withdraw of the
corridor fleet  What is the person in charge to do ? Sacrifice his Sectors and
the domain of 
denebs security and help the \'rightful\'  emperor ? Or place his interests and
those
of his underlings (and of the Megacorps who bribe him ;-) ) above the war
against
the Assasin  Dulinor, being the interest of the whole imperium ?
Actually, in early Solomani history (-2700 to -2500 Imperial ) in Europe (Ill
take the Holy Roman Empire as an example) there was a constant struggle
between the Kaiser (Emperor) and the Kings, Princes and Dukes of the various
smaller states which germany was made of. In times of external threat, the
neccessity of central
power to effectively lead and most importantly equip a large army stiffened

like to invite comments (Players may rest assured that any changes will not

partners (re Finished goods trade) and the effects of surpluses (ie failing to 
spend your full budget).

Trade partners.
I\'m thinking of restricting the worlds which can be counted as trade partners.
To me it makes no sense that planet Dirtball with its E class starport and 20 
inhabitants should count as a viable trade partner for planet Powerhouse with 
its A class starport and 2 billion inhabitants (trading with Dirtball should not 
increase powerhouse\'s GWP by 10%0. Therefore I\'m thinking of putting a 
limitation on the worlds which may be considered as trade partners.

Surpluses
The accumulated surpluses in PE do not represent investments (these are 
covered in infrastructure improvements etc.) It strikes me that by failing to 
spend your full budget you are effectively taking wealth out of your economy
(a similar situation to the habit of the Archimedian Persians building up 
massive surpluses of gold). I\'m thinking of having surpluses also acting as a 
negative drain on GWP like deficits, but nowhere near as severe. The rational 
behind this is that taking wealth out of the economy you create deflationary 
pressure.

Any jump, no matter what the distance, requires the standard 168 hours (+/-
10%).  An old sneaky trick is to jump to your current position, catching
the enemy by surprise as they police up the battle area.

IIRC, a micro jump does indeed require the same amount of fuel as a J-1.

In response to some inquiries:

Dad-hood seems to suit me, Skyler is my third "recruit" - and
(as far as we\'re planning) the last. Grandkids (in twenty years
or so) are another matter, of course. :) 

My wife is doing fine. A little tired, but both her and our new addition
are resting comfortably.

Skyler\'s UPP is still under investigation, but her Social Standing (at
least in the eyes of her parents and grandparents) is a definite
F tending towards G. Out of eight children sired by my brothers
and I, Skyler is only the second of the female persuasion.

Her social standing in the eyes of her eldest (five year old) brother
may be a bit lower..."Daddy, are there still more boys than girls in
our family? No, I mean our whole (extended) family..." :o)

Thanks again...

children would take up some fraction of the space, air, and life support 
requirements that an adult would require.

As a parent, I have some evidence to the contrary:

1) My car can easily fit three adults in the back seat, including the 
equipment such adults often carry (purses, bookbags full of gaming 
manuals, etc).

Three children, including two car seats, a large bag of diapers, snacks,
spare clothes, small toys, etc - the minimum equipment to leave the house
with the little ones - fill both back seat and trunk to overflowing.

My five-year old is also perfectly capable of occupying as much living
space as an adult, with his capability to cover tables with coloring paper,
rooms with toy spaceships, and shelves with all manner of books. His
ability to share some toys with his father helps somewhat.

2) My five-year old and one-year old will devour, at a sitting, nearly as
much or more food (each) as I do. Further, their water requirements
frequently exceed my own - ranging from bathwater enough to flood 
the bathing room to a needed glass of water (often at night, and just
as the wife and I were practicing our liaison skills).

Furthermore, once my kids enter their pre-teen years, getting two of them
to share the same stateroom will certainly be more stressful than
having your Free Trader attacked by Vargr corsairs.

Children may take up some fraction of the space, life support, and other
life-support requirements of an adult. IMO, the fraction is somewhat higher
than 1/1.

Three binary digits have 8 posible values.  111 base 2 = 7

Why the bother, just mark up any normal pencil with 1-6 on each of its side
and roll using that - this is what we used during militry training when
dice looked suspicious to the officers milling about.

Not being an expert, I might ask a couple of questions.

Did they even *have* system defenses?  After 10000yrs of being the
bad-boys-on-the-block, did they even think that there was anyone to
defend against?

I would say, just as a start, there were far less defenses within the
heart of the Ziru Sirka than at the edges, thus making it a kind of
\'pie-crust\' defense.  Even once the Terrans started to make a lot of
noise, it could take a while to get enough might there to make a
difference.

    'body' => 'As a Wiccan, I have been skeptical to bring my religion or other 
alternative religions into my Traveller games for many of the same 
reasons that many others on the list seem uncomfortable bringing in 
the mainstream JCI religions into their games.  Some gamers are more 
comfortable in dealing with religions not their own, while others 
prefer to reserve that for Fantasy clergy in other types of games, 
and still others who wish to dodge the whole issue entirely.

With the recent discussions about various religious holidays on or 
around the Winter Solstice, I wanted to add my best wishes to 
everyone in the celebration of their Holidays, and to wish all a very 
Happy Yule!  (And, to the best of my ability, Happy Hannakuh, Merry 
Christmas, Blessed Ramadan, Season\'s Greetings, Happy Holidays, and 
for those to whom this applies, Happy Birthday, for what it\'s worth.) 
 May this Season bring you closer to that which you hold dear, and 
bless you with Peace, Joy, and Happiness.

Then I asked myself, how could this relate to Traveller?  So, not 
without some risk and intrepidation, here goes:

ObTrav:  Many of the alternative religions currently being practiced 
on this planet we call home center around an observance of the nature 
cycles of the Wheel of the Year.  Shamanism, Druidism, Wicca, et al, 
give significant honor to the passage to the seasons and the year.  
These religions observe both the Winter and Summer Solstice, and the 
Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, as well as intermediate Holidays based 
on planting and harvest times, roughly halfway between each of the 
astronomical phenomena listed before.

When Terrans go into space, first into their own solar system, and 
later, across the interstellar reaches, how do they handle the 
changes induced by new worlds, with different seasons and different 
length years?

Many of the more Traditional practitioners of these various religions 
might elect to continue to honor the cycle of their homeworld, Mother 
Earth.  Especially during initial explorations and settlements, many 
Circles or Covens (loose organizations of Wiccan practitioners, 
similar to a church congregation, who meet and practice their 
religion together) might continue to honor Terra\'s cycle.

More non-Traditional Circles/Covens would wish to embrace the cycle 
of their new home, and thus begin to honor the Wheel of Life of the 
new planet, as well as attune themselves more readily to the cycles 
of their new home.  In doing so, many of these Circles/Covens would 
be considered to have "gone Native" and adapted their religious 
worship to coincide with the Solstices, Equinoxes, and Seasons of 
their new home.  Thus, Terran Wicca would be different from Martian 
Wicca, or Barnard Wicca, etc.  (But then again, we are a muchly 
diversified faith, as it is.)

In other situations where time or weather/seasons have little or no 
impact on the culture (such as sector-wandering Travellers, asteroid 
belt mainworlds or tidal-locked plantets), many of these religious 
practitioners would probably fall back on their religious upbringing, 
or possibly adopt the Universal Standards used by the Imperium, which 
means falling back to Terra\'s rotational period as the basis for 
their religious practices.  Thus, the Wheel of Life turns completely, 
and returns to its origin, coming full circle in the passage of time.

It has quite a poetic feel to it, doesn\'t it?

Thank you for this opportunity to share some thoughts of particular 
significance to myself.  Should you have any comments, either 
positive or negative, I welcome them.  If the comments are not of a 
Traveller nature, I request that they be sent to me privately, so as 
not to burden this list with material not related to Traveller.

Failure to do so will not result in any comment from myself, as the 
material will not be related to the purpose of this list.  In 
addition, I ask my fellow TMLers not to respond to any unrelated 
material that might be generated on the list by this post, or any 
like it.  If this list doesn\'t support non-Traveller comments, then 
we can get on with the business at hand, which is to enjoy the 
game/way of life we know and love, and have come to identify as 
Traveller.

Blessed Be,

Orthodox Judaism would still see Jerusalem as the center of the universe and
the standard upon which the calendar is based, while extra-terran Reform
Jews might "go with the flow" of changing the calendar, since they would
question tradition.

Christianity has had a habit of taking non-biblical holidays and making them
"christian", so they would probably try to transform native/pagan holidays
into something "christian" in an effort to bring in new converts.

I won\'t even go into what Mormonism would do.

Jehovah\'s Witnesses, depending on what had transpired since 1914, seem to
only hold up the days of their larger meetings and of Nisan 14(on their
calendar, not on the Jewish calendar--about a month off).  All else is
taboo, even birthdays.

The Pope, however, is on record as saying that if interplanetary
colonization became possible, they would try to convert alien life to Roman
Catholicism.

Yes, the Tale of Paks trilogy was a very engrossing series.  I really came
to love that character and emotionally invest myself.  But then, I did that
in the "Split Infinity" series, also.  Something about the Paks thing had a
gritty realism to it, though, and I liked the fact that magic was something
that prompted a reaction of awe, because it was so rare, rather than being
commonplace.  Magic seems too much like cheating, to me.

Yesterday, my 20 hp Paladin became a "Little" Girl Giant\'s field goal kick.
By all rights I should have died, but the cleric came along in the nick of
time and saved me.  Dying in RPG\'s is a good thing.  Makes you feel less
invincible.

I seldom trust any one textbook without reservation. The formula
I use was from a recent (1996) astrophysics text. As I put it in
my spreadsheet, it goes:

TP:  Base mean planetary temperature, K
EFS: Effective stellar temperature, K.
ALB: Planetary Albedo
RS:  Stellar radius;  Km
OD:  Orbit distance;  AU

TP = EFS * ((1 - ALB) ^ 1/4) * SQRT( RS/ (2* OD * 1.496e11))

The constant is a combination of a couple of physical constants
and conversion factors. This formula is for a rapidly rotating
planet: the formula for a slowly rotating one differs by a factor
of two somewhere, IIRC. I didn\'t note it down.

The text mentioned an atmospheric effect as well, but I didn\'t
find any details on estimating it.

No. Common law is more along the lines of all the old precedents and
the like. Court rulings *not* based on the written law become part of
the common law. And they can be hell to change...

Chivalry does have an element of religion in it, in that you are
expected to follow your reliogion faithfully. But the chivalric code
actually came from *Islamic* culture (back when *they* were the most
advanced culture in the Western world). 

But the basic concepts are things like be kind to the weak, fight
honorably, and all that stuff about "pure love" for your lady. It fits
well with fealty type arrangements (ie verbal contracts in the form of
mutual oaths where lord and vassal each have *clearly* defined duties,
obligations, and privileges. And violation of the terms by *either*
side not only negates the contract, but tends to make others cautious
about making contracts with that party).

Yes, all the "honor" stuff actually boils down to a form of contract
law! 

> Bushido is connected with Shinto (japanese religion), isn\'t it?

I\'m not entirely certain about that. Again it\'s a case of Shinto being
the predominant religion (with Bhuddism a *strong* second) of the
culture, but not necessarily being part of the code.

Confucianism leads to a *quite* different setup than what we\'d think of
as "nobles". In the real world it led to the Chinese Mandarins. Which
is a system of *bureaucracies* rather than nobles. To give you an idea
how ingrained bureaucracy is into Chinese culture, their religions had
a "heavenly bureaucracy"!

The essence of becoming a Mandarin was learning a bunch of required
material and passing exams on it. Said material being Confucian
philosphy that had little or nothing to do with the requirements of the
actual *job*. Shades of the civil service exams!

That\'s where the "fealty" type system comes in. A noble swears oaths
with both his superior(s) and his subordinates. Those oaths constitute
a verbal contact that spells out what each party owes the other.
Violation by *either* party negates the oath. And if it gets around
that you\'ve been forsworn, folks aren\'t going to want to enter into a
fealty relationship with you as subordinate *or* superior. 

In essence, being a noble in a fealty based system is based on your
"rep". Get a bad rep, and you\'ve had it. 

And the fact that the oaths go *both* ways means that if the noble
starts trying to demand things from his vassals that he isn\'t entitled
to by the oath means that he\'s violated it, and they can tell him to go
piss up a rope. And getting help from other nobles to get these things
is likely to cause *their* vassals to start getting a bit uneasy. 

Also, keep in mind that things like taxes and troops are part of what\'s
covered by the oaths. The noble may have household troops that he pays
for *personally*. But so do his vassals, and much of his "army" will be
composed of units who "owe" him service because of their lord\'s oaths
to him. If he violates his oath, they can up and leave. 

So based on this model, I can see nobles being responsible for some
military units that they *personally* raise and pay for. And various
cities and the like may raise units as well. So the Baron of thus and
so may be owed fealty by the cities and towns of a region. But *they*
supply most of the troops he uses to protect the region and to do other
things. 

You can extend this sort of model to non-military areas easily enough.
For example, when applied to industry it resembles calassic
syndicalism. 

And this sort of thing is *necessary* to make any sort of system of
nobility where the nobles actually *mean* something work. Each "level"
*has* to have its own troops, otherwise the central authority can order
them to do things on threat of force because *it* controls the military.

On the other hand, this sort of localized and heirarchical military
organization is well suited to something as spread out as the Imperium.
It means that the locals will have the ability *and* authority to deal
with problems on their own.

What you *really* have to deal with in the above are "biomes". An old
intro to ecology book I borrowed once had this chart listing all the
land-based biomes on Earth. The controlling factors are average yearly
temp and average yearly precipitation. 

When you con side that average temp is a function of *both* latitude
*and* altitude, you get interesting effects such as the way you move
from forest to scrub to alpine meadow as you move up a mountain. Just
like you go from forest to scrub to tundra as you move towards the
poles. 

The problem with this is that it means that vegetation depends on
*weather*, while weather depends to some extent on vegetation!
Remember, the Sahara *was* forest and grasslands. Overgrazing killed
the vegetation (and still is!) resulting in the spread of desert. 

You see, plants, especially trees, give off a lot of water vapor which
increase the precipitation downwind... Kill the trees and the downwind
area suffers a "drought". Which is why parts of Africa have had
essentially *continuous* droughts for the past 30 years.

Anyway, the point (and problem!). Is that a lot of this stuff is
interdependent. So much so that if I ever try doing detailed stuff I\'m
seriously considering a program that starts out with some uniform
vegetation and has the computer run through a few thousand years of
weather to see how it stabilizes. Alternatively, simulate the grasses,
etc spreading from the seas and large lakes to the land and run the
simulation for a few millenia. Digging up the correct formulas (to the
extent that they are known) is a pain.

Well, Andrew Moffat-Valance is busy with his PBEM, and Kenji is in Boston

A thing to remember is that this particular bit of the Ziru Sirkaa was a
peaceful, stable backwater before Terran contact. Sure, the Governor kept
some troops and naval vessels on hand, but they didnt expect to use em.
Think of Siberia circa 1820 ...

I\'d say the philosophy of warface wouldnt have been changed much - you have
to remember that the 3I has pretty solid Vilani roots, and the Vilani are
damn stubborn.

>Did they use SDBs?  Fighter squadrons?  Cruisers?  Marines in Vacc 
>Suits, Grav Belts and Laser Rifles?
>

I think a standard defense pattern would be a number of missiles at the
base (perhaps using a reusable contragravity boost phase to get out of the
gravity well, then switching over to AND), backed up by any mobile forces
the Governor may have assigned.

I find grav belts unlikely - they are generally held to be TL12, and the
Vilani were a pretty solid TL11. You can build a manpack grav module at
TL10 under FFS2 (think of it as a grav bike sans the bike), but you also
need a doctrine that can take advantage of the tactical mobility.

Marines with laser rifles in vacc suits, yeah.

>How about the backwater worlds of the Solomani Rim sector, both

Well, there is a limited amount of defense possible until you get a
population in the millions. It doesnt matter if every man is a soldier, if
there was 5000 of you to start with and they just show up with two cruisers
and a drop division.

My feeling is that it would be defended by a couple of militiamen with stun
rifles (even if they are Vilani, miners get rowdy). It\'s an outpost,
there\'s no Vargr within hundreds of parsecs, and there has been no
technology leakage across the border.

Yeah, the Sunbeard Declaration. I think one of the wilder member of the
pro-piracy faction argued against it with many ahhh innovative and
imaginitive arguments, but he was apparently kicked into line by other,
saner, members of his faction (*pulls tongue back from cheek*).

The economics model isnt too bad, once you take Pocket Empires and kick it
into shape (base costs on population etc). It\'s the vanilla trade model
that really badly sucks - it neither makes sense, encourages adventure, or
makes it possible to duplicate the canon background.

I disagree - Aliens Archive was one of the good books! IMO of course...

It\'s not meant to be a first rate AFV, or even a serious combatant.
That, and I have real problems with some of the missile rules allowing

Well, for the record, it wasn\'t a "truce" but rather an attempt
to push one "compromise".  I had some problems with part of
it but I had already put myself into a unilateral truce and
the way to let the thread die down wasn\'t to start rehashing
the points involved.

I suspect that that WBH was pretty much just a restating of GS/GC,
possibly with superficial detail added.  If so, I can probably do without
a copy of WBH.  Otherwise I need to lay hands on one soon.

  IIRC both Bushido and (State) Shinto underwent some significant changes
around the period of the Restoration (some of it prior to and helping to
enable the political changes, too).

  The 3I may not have a substantive State ideology (perhaps due to its
size and heterogeneity), but it\'s pretty rare in that repsect, then.

Ummm...  It looks like we are rapidly developing two FAQs with
quite a bit of overlapping information.  I would offer a freeze
on development of BOTH FAQs (the TML FAQ, and the Traveller FAQ
that appears on FT), merge the common material into the Traveller
FAQ, and keep the TML FAQ strictly related to TML stuff - i.e.,
Done to Death topics, procedures for maintaining a subscription,
and so on - stuff that would be of interest _only_ to people who
are actually subscribing to the TML.  The rest should be in the
Traveller FAQ, which is of general interest to anyone who plays
Traveller.  If someone would be so kind as to point me to the TML
FAQ, I\'ll slurp it up and update the Traveller FAQ appropriately,
and I\'d be interested in hearing any appropriate discussion on
this issue, and on any ideas people have for new or revised
Traveller FAQ material.

Nah, try the Macho die-rolling method. Your opponent grabs a handful of
chest hair and yanks it out, divides the number of hairs removed by the
die-number (e.g 6) and the remainder is the number rolled :P

Ummm, it\'s an \'Armoured CAR\' not an IFV. But if you want more firepower then
who am I to disagree.

Children tend to be more active, negating both the air and space
savings. And since children are *growing*, their nutritional needs are
*lot* higher. A child 3 feet tall has 1/8th the mass of a 6 foot adult,
but consumes more like *half* as much food. More if you let them. 

*Dwarfs or midgets*, having finished growing will consume less food
than larger adults. Even then, they\'ll need more food than you\'d think
simply because they have a less favorable surface to volume ratio,
which results in needing more energy to maintain body temp.

However, there has been *much* speculation among theologians regarding
this subject. 

You see, we need to be saved because of Adam & Eve\'s "original sin". We
are a "fallen" race. If an alien race hasn\'t fallen, they wouldn\'t need
to be saved. Likewise, if they *have* fallen, it\'s not certain that
they won\'t have been given their *own* Savior. And if his teachings
resemble Christ\'s things will get *really* interesting. 

So regardless of what the Pope said (he\'s only infallible when making
rules under certain conditions, which I\'m *certain* weren\'t met when he
answered this question) the Catholic Church would likely look things
over *very* carefully before doing anything official. 

Oh yeah, I haven\'t even *touched* on the can of worms that\'ll be opened
regarding the question of whether or not the aliens have souls!

    'body' => 'My general take (ie IMTU) on religion in the Traveller universe (and it\'s very 
much my take from a TU building perspective, not from a religious one, says 
he, trying to tread lightly) is this:

- - religion is about "who am I", "where am I going", "where did I come from", 
"what happens when I die", "what is my place in the world/universe"

- - a citizen of the traveller universe might see these questions as partially 
answered by the Ancients. From the players/citizen\'s perspective, since they 
don\'t possess all the relevant Traveller supplements/adventures, the Ancients 
have a position similar to the monolith in 2001. Big, mysterious, subject to 
thousands of possible interpretations

- - a lot of people inclined to religion are going to be inclined to some kind 
of speculation about the role of the Ancients. Major religions, of a sort, are 
going to be founded around particular hypotheses. "Traditional" religion is 
going to be in competition with these new religions.

- - on the other hand, since knowing the truth about the Ancients *may* not 
answer all your questions, there\'s still a place for the religions we know 
today. But "competition" forces them to merge, find common ground and, to an 
extent, change. Your mileage may vary, and obviously you may well want to tilt 
this towards your point of view. But it\'s not too difficult to imagine 
moderate or extreme change to existing religions, without excluding them or 
indeed denying their relevance. The background/future history for Dune is a 
good example for this.

- - Bear in mind when building these future histories that existing Terran 
religions are not necessarily bound to merge with *one another* - they may 
encounter similar beliefs in other worlds with whom they believe they find 
common ground. Indeed the discovery of common ground would be claimed as 
"proof" to support a particular party\'s point of view, and used to win 
adherents. These discoveries may well be the key events driving 
mergers/schisms in religious movements.

IMTU, I\'ve had for a long time a major quasi-religious order called the 
WordGuild, originally the Guild of the Divine Word (bad pun), who obsessively 
seek and collect evidence of the Ancients, and alternative Ancients 
hypotheses. They run huge library ships which travel the length and breadth of 
the Imperium and Solomani space. They run agents throughout their sphere of 
influence (got to get to the Ancients find first). They are planning secret 
expeditions toward the Core and beyond the Rim.

To support this, they need money. Being a religion gives them adherents gives 
them money. Then they need to take the money and make it work. They secretly 
control corporations, and at times megacorporations. Some companies are just 
fronts for the WordGuild. Some planets are effectively wholly owned by the 
Guild, and used to run bases, build ships, etc. Some other religions are just 
fronts for the Guild, or else Guild experiments in particular Ancients 
hypotheses, intended to flush out particular items of information.

This gets away from some of the traditional issues about religion - it\'s a 
cult of knowledge, rather than one of life, or of death, or of right and 
wrong. But it fulfils the role in a Traveller campaign of a big organised 
religion, while remaining very much founded in the Traveller background, and 
without particularly offending anyone. It is also an endless cheap source of 
plotlines. I have a longer write-up. If anyone\'s interested I\'ll try and fix 
it up and post it.

You\'d love the illustrations in an old filk song book I have. The

Just a note. While I am not a follower of Islam, I do happen to know
that Ramadan is more or less equivalent to the Christian observance of
Lent. It also moves thru the (Gregorian) calendar on a 19 year cycle.

Quarter days and "cross-quarter" days. They are tied to the solar
longitude, though the dates for the "halfway" observances have gotten
tied more to traditional dates than to the actual solar position. 

Here\'s the info for 1999 on Earth (for my longitude):

Solar
longitude	date	observance	comments
- ----	----	----	----
 -45		Feb  4	???
   0		Mar 20	vernal equinox	defined as 0 solar longitude
  45		May  5	beltane?
  90		Jun 21	summer solstice
 135		Aug  7	???
 180		Sep 23	Autumnal equinox
- -135		Nov  7	???
 -90		Dec 21	winter solstice

These all depend on the axial tilt of the planet. And they are equally
spaced thru the year.

Planets with eccentric orbits may also have to worry about seasonal
effects due to the planet\'s position in it\'s orbit. These will *not* be
evenly spaced (when I figure out how to calculate them, I\'ll let you know)

Just as Jewish practice has decided that for those in places where the
sunrise set cannot be used for observances (most folks north of the
Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic circle), the time of
sunrise/sunset at Jerusalem may be used instead.

Well, considering that the idea is to work *with* Nature, not against
it, I\'d say using local cycles makes sense. :-)

Actually, even tidal locked planets will have "seasons". It\'s called
"libration", and it basicly means that during the course of a year, the
terminator shifts a bit east and west, with one full cycle per year.
You can see it on the moon if you look really hard. It\'s due to the
orbit being elliptical. (and it\'s hard to explain without diagrams).

I would also be interested in getting a copy of this long-sought book. (a

But postage for me would probably be more in the region of $8-10 due to

That looks roughly equivalent to what I\'ve got.  The discrepancy with the old
Book 6 formula is in the albedo factor -- Book 6 had surface temperature as
being _directly proportional_ to the quantity (1 - A), rather than
proportional
to its fourth root.  I just spent an hour or so monkeying with the Stefan-
Boltzmann equation to make sure I could rederive the formula properly,
so I\'m fairly confident that I\'ve got the right relationship.

I\'d *really* like to see something that covers *non* main sequence
stars. Because there are so many neat plots you can base around the
peculiarities of the various pre and post main sequence stages.

Sure, they shouldn\'t be *common* but they should be detailed. Or at
least have an entry somewhere that says "non-main sequence star" with a
list of possible types. That would allow for an "exotic stars"
supplement or article if there isn\'t room in the main book.

As noted in another message, this sort of thing gets *very* messy,

What, you want us to use a flamethrower on a target?  I would prefer a nice

Anybody ever read Gregory Benford\'s short story collection \'Matter\'s End\'?  
Thre\'s a short story in it, about 3 pages long, called Proselytes, where an 
alien race sends its missionaries to Earth to convert us \'heathens\', only 
getting shot up in the end by yet *another* alien race intent on converting 
everybody to *their* militant religion.

Interesting reading.  And definitely one of those things that makes you go 
\'Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...\'

A word from the other end of the spectrum, I am ordained in one of the most
conservative Christian denominations around.  Well...  conservative about our
tradition, rather liberal in our politics.

I have long felt that traditional SF failed to understand what a powerful
cultural force religion is.  Being agnostics, we assume that the future will
be uniformly agnostic.

But I have a hunch Frank Herbert might be more prophetic than Gene
Roddenberry; the future might look more like Dune than Star Trek.

ObTrav: IMTU, the Roman Catholic Church failed to raise its eyes to the stars.
During the critical 23C, they were busy squabbling over the primacy of Rome.

However, a splinter group became very active and very successful evangelists.
Excommunicated in AD2437, they came to be known as the Solomani Catholic
Church.  IMTU, they are scary -- everything the conspiracy theorists believe
about Jesuits...

Solomani Catholics observe the 365-day Imperial calendar.  However, the
ancient date for Easter (and thus half the holy days) is tied to the cycle of
the terran moon.  After decades of fighting, they declared these holidays
fixed to the Imperial calendar.  Christmas is observed on 358; Easter is 092
and Pentecost is 141.  Sunday is observed on Senday.  (There may be ultra-
conservative renegades who still count Easter the old way.)

In my Spinward Marches, there are several other faiths.  The Daryen have a
kind of vague deism, not a terribly inspiring faith but a logical one.  They
celebrate a Day of Atonement in memory of the Maghiz.

The Sword Worlds are solidly Lutheran, being descended primarily from humans
from Lutheran nations.  Their churches are state churches, and little
attended, but their clergy are important state officials.

Islam is growing among the Jonkeereen.  Can you tell I liked Dune?  I\'m
thinking of unleashing them in a jihad across the Marches...

I\'ll drink to that.  :)

you won\'t have me next year though, because at midnight, 1/1/2000 I plan to
be on top of Telegraph Hill screaming "I win!" at the top of my lungs.
When I was diagnosed with HS in 95, my long term survival goal was to live
to see 2000.  Now it looks like I\'ll make it.

The short-term goal was to live long enough to see the Regency Sourcebook.

Agree completely. Even his Vietnam stories can be milked for merc
campaigns.

I\'ve also just read Lois McMaster Bujold\'s "Shards of Honor" and it is
a perfect example of the problems with the sort of thing that Cleon
Zhunatsu was trying in M:0.

The surprising thing is that it\'s realy just a retelling of "Romeo &
Juliet" with a happy ending, but some parts are wonderfully done,
especially how the "public story" differs dramatcally from what really
happened, despite the best efforts of the heroine to tell the truth.

The only other book I can remember that did this as well was "The Real
Story (The Gap into Conflict)" by Stephen Donaldson, though that was
specificaly written to portray such a difference

Bujold\'s other stuff, like "The Warrior\'s Apprentice" is also good for
Traveller background in a
P.E period.

(Started right with Traveller a decade ago, and stick to it), so what 
was a striking surprise to me could be well-known. Hence, I ask on 
illumination....

The surprise was this: I was watching this with my 
girlfriend, trying to explain which kind of races we were 
watching. So first I say these are elves, then the goblins 
appear, and then the protagonist is attacked by a bunch of 
stereotypical bad guys, and I stare at them and say "...and... 
these...are... VARGR????."

I swear it, they looked exactly like a bunch of low-tech Vargr to me, 
only a bit taller and stronger. If pressed, I could have said they 
had some Urzaeng blood. But they were, for me, clearly Vargr. In a 
fantasy RPG.

A couple of minutes later, somebody in the story called them 
"Kobolds." I had heard the name before, but I never saw this 
Vargr-image.

Is this some sort of standard in Fantasy, I mean, are the Kobolds 
physically like Vargr, or it is just in this anime? If they are like 
Vargr, I have just found a new source of illustrations for Traveller 
games involving Vargr!

I include the following Timeline of Terran history for my First 
Contact campaign, Project StarRise, for your perusal.  In it, I hope 
you will find the seeds for such later developments as the First IW, 
a Megacorporation\'s founding, and GenAssist, as well as some 
significant details leading up to First Contact.  The items labelled 
with an asterisk (*) are canon.  Those labelled with an ampersand (@) 
are inspired by the Prometheus Rising data.  The rest, for better or 
worse, is my own fault.

The Greater Republic of Texas was inspired by 2300AD.  The Western 
League of Sino-Australian Nations was inspired by a comment on this 
mailing list, which indicated that Australian and either China or 
Japan would most likely unite under such conditions.  (In this case, 
I chose China, due to the Trade Wars.)  The Trade Wars were inspired 
by the novel "Cybernetic Samurai."  The eugenics program Project: 
Adam concept came from the movie "Soldier" and was further inspired 
by "Star Trek Classic:  Botany Bay" episode and the short-lived TV 
series "Space: Above and Beyond."  The Barsoom Project was named for 
Edgar Rice Burrough\'s work, and Podkayne Down is dedicated to the 
works of the Dean of Science Fiction, Robert A. Heinlein (oft called 
the Admiral on this list.)  And finally, the "Reach for the Stars" 
Declaration of 2093 owes a grudging nod to the movie "Toy Story" for 
its title.  :)

I welcome any relavent comments, suggestions, and discussions.  Thank 
you for your time.

In Service,
Jason
==========================================

Terran History, from the foundation of the United Nations until 
First Contact:

1940\'s

*United Nations founded at the end of WWII in New York in 1945.

1950\'s

*Terra begins their first tentative efforts toward space exploration 
in 1957.

1960\'s

*First lunar landing by US on June 21, 1996.

1970\'s

The timeline of the Traveller Universe begins to slowly depart from
the Real World\'s timeline in 1978.  The division becomes more apparent
at the turn of the 20th Century.

1980\'s

In 1984, the US Space Shuttle Challenger explodes due to a 
propulsion system failure.

1990\'s

Tensions in Middle East between Iraq and Kuwait lead to one hundred
day long First Gulf War in 1990.

Further tensions in Middle East between Iraq and Kuwait lead to Second
Gulf War in 1998.

2000\'s

First International Space Station (ISS) completes its five years of
construction in 2003.

*US manned voyages to Luna resume in early 2004.

*Archimedes settlement on Luna established by the US as a small 
mining base in 2006.

*United Nations Space Coordinating Agency (UNSCA) established in 
2008.

2010\'s

*Copernicus settlement on Luna established in 2017 by America, 
Britain and Japan.

The Trade Wars, a series of severe economic maneuvers by several of
the world powers to establish dominance of the World Market, begins in
2018.

2020\'s

The end of the Trade Wars in 2021 results in the Second Great
Depression, also called the Crazy Years.

In 2023, the former US state of Texas, under the direct of charismatic
Texan Republican party leader Moses Adamson, secedes from the United
States to form the Greater Republic of Texas.  Minor military
skirmishes occur before President Adamson and President Chelsea
Clinton of the United States negotiate a peace settlement, which in
turn is ratified by both nations\' legislative bodies.  Texas\'s
independence is recognized in exchange for fairly lucrative trade
agreements between the two new nations.  In early 2024, the GRT is
recognized as an independent nation by the United Nations.

@In 2029, the United Nations issues several articles designed to
facillitate the recovery of the world\'s economy, and fosters the
organization of multi-national corporate conglomerations.  These trade
blocs become the new political identities within the UN.

2030\'s

The United States and Greater Republic of Texas begin a joint manned
space mission to Mars known as the Barsoom Project in 2030.

Scientific breakthroughs in gravitic research at the Texas Space
Center in Houston revolutionizes space travel in 2031.

The Barsoom Project achieves a successful Mars landing in early 2032. 
Texican astronaut Jared Schmitz takes the first step onto Martian
soil.

The United States of America and the Greater Republic of Texas begin
earnest plans to colonize Mars, and the first mining and research
settlement, Podkayne Down, begins construction in 2038.  The United
States constructs a small base on the Martian moon of Deimos that same
year, the Aries Station.

2040\'s

Several other national blocs establish colonies on Mars during the
2040\'s, including the European Commonwealth and the Western League of
Sino-Australian Nations.

The United States turns some of its attention toward a manned mission
to Mercury.  In 2044, US astronauts under Project Hermes are the first
to walk on Mercurian soil.

The New Eastern Soviet Bloc and the Greater Republic of Texas both
launch independent missions to the Asteroid Belt in 2046.  The United
States follows up with explorations of their own with months.  Upon
discovery of many mineral-rich resources within the Belt, more blocs
strive to establish colonies among the asteroids.

*In 2047, the European Space Agency (ESA) Long-Range Colony Mission
leaves Terra.

The Western League of Sino-Australian Nations and the New Eastern
Soviet Bloc both send Long-Range Colony Missions toward nearby star
systems in 2049.

2050\'s

*Mercury Solar Observatory first established in 2051.

Throughout the 2050\'s, the various blocs use the Asteroid Belt as the
launch point for manned missions to the outer Solar System.  Numerous
projects begin to explore and settle the moons of Jupiter starting in
2051, Saturn in 2054, Uranus in 2055, and Neptune in 2056.  Colonial
expansion throughout the inner Solar System and the Jovian moons
begins to occur in earnest in the late 2050\'s.

*By 2058, various national blocs have established bases throughout 
the Terran solar system.

The US Charon Mission to Pluto in 2058 marks the attainment of the
final frontier within the Solar System.

2060\'s

A series of unexplained explosion at the Charon Station on Pluto in
early 2061 causes the US to react aggressively.  The Charon Station is
heavily fortified, and the United States establishes a strong
defensive posture over their Plutonian territory.  The UNSCA denies
the US the right to maintain sole control of the outermost planet,
based on precedence set by expansions into the outer system during the
previous decade.

The Neptunian Skirmishes of 2061 and 2062 between the US and other
national blocs staging missions to Pluto causes the UNSCA to step in. 
After long mediations behind closed doors, the UN Security Council
announced that Pluto would fall under the jurisdiction of the United
Nations, and that the US was given the right to protect Pluto in the
name of the United Nations.  The space surrounding Pluto and Charon
was declared interdicted in the Treaty of Pluto 2062, and only UN
Security Council personnel were granted access to the Charon Station. 
The research or discoveries made on Pluto are not divulged to the
public, and are the cause for some unrest among the political
unstable.

Political tensions among expanding colonies and blocs mount, leading
to several interplanetary skirmishes:  the Jovian Assault of 2064, the
Battle of Ceres in 2068, and the Titan Incident in 2069.  Political
tensions are high by the end of the decade.

2070\'s

The Io Incident of 2071 over violations of GRT Jovian airspace by
United Arabic Coalition vessels after repeated warnings sparks
retaliatory terrorist acts within the domed cities of several outer
system colonies.  Several thousand die in the aftermath of the
explosions, and the Io orbital city of San Juan Baptista is destroyed.

The Greater Republic of Texas immediately declares war on the United
Arabic Coalition, and the Solar System become embroiled in its first
true interplanetary System War.  Armed conflict both on Terra, her
colonies and interplanetary space caused the death of over two hundred
million people over the System War\'s duration.

The System War comes to a close when the New Arabic Freedom movement
overthrows the United Arabic Coalition, and sues for peace in late
2077.  The United Nations recognizes the two new national blocs, the
New Arabic Free States and the United Coalition of Islam, which arises
from the political turmoil of the System War and internal civil war of
the old UAC.

Occasional radical terrorist activitie during 2078 and 2079 inspires
the UNSCA to announce and support the Ganymede Accords, which
redefined the rights of UNSCA officials to search and monitor
interplanetary transactions and trade, with an eye towards reducing
terrorist activity and maintaining peace.

2080\'s

*A corporate consortium in Europe is founded in 2080, colloquially
called "the Company."

*Luna, Terra\'s moon, unifies as a nation in the United Nations in 
2085.

*Researchers in the Asteroid Belt develop the Waven Hyperspace Shunt
drive in 2087, allowing jumps through hyperspace of distances up to 30
AUs.

In 2088, investigative reporters in the United States reveal to the
world the existence of a fifteen year old military eugenic research
project, Project: Adam.  Through cloning and selective gene spliciing,
Project: Adam was intended to develop genetically superior warriors,
in the event of a Second System War.  The United States comes under a
lot of scrutiny from other members of the United Nations.

In 2089, two other military eugenics programs, from the Western League
of Sino-Australian Nations and the New Eastern Soviet Bloc, are
revealed by UN Security Council agents.  A third was discovered in 
development by "the Company."

2090\'s

In early 2090, the United Nations General Assembly proposed and passed
the Anti-Eugenics Act, which emancipated the subjects of the various
military eugenics projects, and made such acts on humans illegal
without the authorization of the UN Security Council.  Many of the
"Eugenes" had trouble adapting to normal society, and those unable to
adapt retreated to positions within the various armed forces or
military boarding schools.

@In 2093, US President Margaret Inch issues the "Reach For The Stars"
Declaration, charging the United States Space Force (USSF) with the
task of launching the first successful interstellar space mission,
utilizing the new WHS technology.

In late 2094, the Gaussenberg Equations allows the WHS field to be
stabilized beyond 30 AUs, and full Jump-1 capacity is achieved.

@In 2095, the US begins construction on Deep Space Station Alan
Sheppard, a space station approximately half-way between Terra and
Barnard\'s Star.  It is finished in under 14 months.

@In September, 2096, the USS Starleaper I travels to Barnard\'s Star 
on first interstellar space mission to another star system.

Oh, sorry I forgot. I come from a low tech world. :( But there is hope, have

Seriously though, if you are playing a campaign in the TNE universe then the
Flame-thrower is a perfectly viable weapon, if you have your tech levels set
to accommodate such.
However, a Plasma-thrower  might be the HT equivalent of the Flame-thrower
here on Urth. Ever played Paranoia?

I can see why, in the Basic DM\'s guide it says \'These small, evil dog-like
men ... have scaly, rust-brown skin and no hair\' I chopped out the bits
irrelevant to the description.  To those playing AD&D, have fun (I know I
sure did.)
So the rust-brown would appear to be the \'fur\' colouring.
As for a source of images, sorry, the only half-decent one was in the first
edition AD&D Monster Manual, after that they become gobliny things. Bummer
eh.

Historically though, the word \'Kobold\' means evil spirit.

 Anson.

From the read, I thought it was a good start, and could be the basis
for a decent random gen. method.  I haven\'t built any characters
with it, though, so I don\'t know how well it works in practice.

As much as I\'ve enjoyed Rob\'s GTrav vehicles, do you know what I\'d
*really* like to see?  A few example GTrav characters, that\'s what!
Characters built using the "normal" system, as you put it, as well
as several using the Templates.  As good as the GT book is (and it
*is* good), I think it assumed the readers were more familar with
GURPS than Traveller.  We old Travheads need some examples and some
explanations that weren\'t there.

Ok, GURPS isn\'t CT/MT or TNE, and the levels of attribute and skill
you need are different, and it\'s not just add 3 to everything
either. ;-> So....

Just how much skill does a Pilot need, and in which skills to equal
a Pilot-1 or a Pilot-4?  What about an Engineer..which skills and
what levels does he need?  Merchant skills aren\'t the same, how do
you compensate?  What about combat skills...do they need to be
higher than non-combat skills, as implied in the B book?

Then let\'s talk about task levels... ;->

...but, I *would* like to see some example characters with
explanations as to why you designed them the way you did.

However, since the Traveller Universe is canon, this should be phrased

That\'s "Shepard". Not that I\'m picky ...

All in all, though, I thought it was pretty darn good!

and best done well away from action.

  The schedule for consumables now reads as: 1500 KEAP rounds, Cr 9000;
3000 GPMG rounds, Cr 3600; 651 liters fuel, Cr 163; 4 ATGM\'s, Cr 512.

Here\'s a timeline that I\'ve worked out for MTU. I don\'t guarantee that it
is 100% canonical, but it\'s close.

- ----
     -2204      Hiroshi Estigarribia establishes the Rule of Man.
     -2177      Estigarribia\'s  son  is  proclaimed  Emperor Hiroshi II.
     -2170?     After  consolidating  his  position Hiroshi II transfers
                the government from Dingir and Vland to Hub/Ershur.
- -2170 to -2000  The Great Terran Diaspora and the Plague of Duskir.
- -2100 to -1849  The RoM fails to settle on a formal method of choosing a
                emperor.  Succession  struggles routinely causes massive
                civil unrest.
 ca. -1850      Solomani Rim cut off from the core of RoM.
- -1849 to -1776  Succession struggles becomes worse. Up to a dozen indivi-
                duals may be vying for the throne at any one time.
     -1776      The treasury on Hub/Ershur refuses to acknowledge a mone-
                tary issue from the branch treasury at Antares. Generally
                regarded as the date for the fall of the Rule of Man.
- -1776 to -1500  The  first  stages of the Long Night is marked by warfare
                among the RoM\'s small successor states, sometimes no more
                than large-scale piracy. Interstellar trade cease in most
                areas. Some worlds, not self-sufficient, simply die; many
                worlds\' economies are ruined; most lose the technology to
                construct starships.
     -1526      The last governmental body claiming to be the Rule of Man
                (on Sylea/Core)  ceases to exist.  Interstellar ships can
                no  longer  travel  (on  the average)  more than one year
                (perhaps thirty parsecs) without being attacked. Also the
                net  growth of industrial output throughout the empire is
                negative;  factories are closing faster than new ones can
                open.
     -1500      The wars in most of the former Rule of Man are over: most
                of the old starships has broken down and no one knows how
                to  repair them.  Only a few scattered areas have managed
                to  keep  jump  technology and only on the Rim are any of
                these pocket states close enough to interact a little.
- -1500 to -1400  In  the  Solomani Rim  pirates  still occasionally plague
                what little trade remains, but the steady decline of said
                trade  and  the well-armed ships of the Terran Mercantile
                Community makes piracy a bad business and by -1400 it has
                almost disappeared.
     -1120      First  Aslan Border War begins.  Reavers from Dark Nebula
                and Magyar cease to bother the Solomani Rim.
      -650      Sylean Federation established.
      -500      Trade is reestablished in many areas by now.
       -30      Cleon\'s Campaign begins.
   76 to 120    Pacification Campaigns.
       100      The IISS reaches the Solomani Rim.
       200      Most  of  the worlds of the Solomani Rim are trading with
                themselves.
       380      Imperial-Aslan border established.
  426 to 588    The various Solomani Rim worlds and governments joins the
                Imperium without fighting.
       426      Easter Concord joins the Imperium.
       588      Incorporation of Sol into Imperium.

- ----

I\'ve also written a few library data entries about the period. Again,
they are my interpretation of canon, not guaranteed canonical. I hope
people can use it.


Here is my suggestion for resolving the various dates and
events given for Terra, the Terran Mercantile Community, the
Old Earth Union, the Rule of Man and such:

- ----
LIBRARY DATA:

OLD EARTH UNION: Interstellar government from -1110 to 588 compri-
sing  Terra  and  the  worlds  closest to her:  Barnard,  Calgary,
Dismal,  Ember,  Fenris,  Forlorn,  Hades,  Heiphaistos,  Inferno,
Junction,  Loki,  Midway,  Peraspera,  Prometheus,  Sirius and Ys.
Fleet bases were also maintained at Aggida,  Markhashi, and Meshan
- -  all within jump-3 of Terra  -  but  these systems were not con-
sidered  part  of the Union proper;  Agidda was a balkanized world
and  thus  unable to send representatives to the Union Council and
both  Markhashi and Meshan had been abandoned during the recession
that followed the fall of the Rim Province (qv.) in -1690.
    The  OEU  was  formed  in  -1110  out of the Terran Mercantile
Community  (qv.)  as  a response to worsening economic conditions.
Although  experiencing some problems  -  a short, vicious tradewar
with  the  newly  formed  Dingir League  from -1106 to -1098 put a
severe  strain  on  both  sides  -  the Union proved strong enough
to  defend  itself  from any serious threat during the rest of the
Long Night,  and  in  588  it was peacefully incorporated into the
Imperium.

REAVERS:  Towards  the end of Twilight,  some of the less affected
states  in outlying sectors turned to plundering old Terran Confe-
deration worlds that had lost interstellar ship technology.  These
plunderers  were called Reavers and differed from ordinary pirates
in preying on whole worlds.  This lent their name a special horror
that has clung to it down to modern days. Most of the Reavers came
from Dark Nebula,  Alpha Crucis,  Magyar,  and of course, Reavers\'
Deep.
    Some historians hold that the Reaver era ended in -1118 when a
Reaver  fleet  from  the Opljiok Defense League lost two thirds of
its  ships in an attack on Jarslav.  With the Aslans becoming ever
stronger  the various Reaver states in Magyar and Dark Nebula grew
unwilling to risk such losses.
    On  the other hand,  the name continued to be applied to inde-
pendent warlords who,  escaping with loyal fleet elements from the
breakup  or  takeover  of  a small state with a few working ships,
could easily make their way into the Great Unknown and have a good
chance of dominating one or several primitive planets. Some of the
most notorious Reaver lords like Blackjack Duquesne, Orchid Lu Wu,
and Grand Admiral Izanak belong to the period from -1120 to -1000.
    During  the  latter  half of the Long Night it became usual to
label  any  opponent a Reaver,  thereby justifying practically any
treatment of that opponent.


RIM PROVINCE: Administrative division of the Second Empire compri-
sing most of the defunct Terran Confederation. It is, depending on
what historian you ask, either one of the first or one of the last
parts of the Rule of Man to succumb to the Long Night.  It was one
of the first areas to loose contact with Hub;  in -1854 the second
new  governor  sent  out  from  Hub failed to reach the province\'s
capital, Dingir,  and Acting Governor Ayara Twofeathers instituted
the  custom  of  Governor-appointed successors,  a system that was
kept to the end of the provincial government.
    The  lessening  flow  of commerce between the rim and the core
was  already  rendering  taxes  more and more meaningless,  and 16
years later the province ceased to remit taxes to Hub except on an
intermittent  basis.  For a while Dingir tried to keep up payments
in the form of precious metals and gems, but when the third of the
treasure  fleets  carrying these payments failed to return,  these
too were discontinued.
    On  the  other hand,  the government at Dingir kept ruling "in
the  name of the Emperor" for another century and a half,  keeping
the  peace  and  enforcing  Rule of Man regulations.  It collapsed
finally in -1690, when a huge budget deficit forced the government
to  decommision  two  thirds  of  the already decimated provincial
fleets  and  turn  over the rest to various individual planets and
the Terran Mercantile Community (qv.).


TERRAN MERCANTILE COMMUNITY:  Loose  trade  association  formed in
- -1862  by Terra and her closest ex-colonies that later grew into a
corporation.  Ostensibly a purely commercial organisation,  it was
actually a means of circumventing Rule of Man prohibitions against
member  planets having their own navies.  The TMC built a merchant
fleet  that  toed  a  very  fine line between commercial ships and
naval vessels.  The ships carried enough armament to protect them-
selves  from pirates and raiders,  but not enough to classify them
as  naval vessels.  Their merchant fleet made Terra and her fellow
worlds in the TMC a formidable commercial force.
    When  the  Rule of Man  in  the form of the Rim Province (qv.)
collapsed  in  -1690,  The Terran Mercantile Community had a space
fleet  to  patrol  its  systems and to replace the now gone Second
Empire fleets.  The TMC\'s merchant fleet cushioned the blow of the
Long Night  and  made it possible for Terra to survive in relative
comfort.
    The  TMC  took  over  many of the functions of the Rule of Man
(though abandoning the extreme edges of the old Rim Province), but
was  careful  at first not to assume the mantle of government.  By
avoiding  the appearance of ruling it avoided alienating the other
planets and driving them into forming their own unions. Relying on
the  protection  of the TMC ships were cheaper than building their
own,  and  the  TMC  itself  took  pains  not to be percieved as a
threat.
    For  several  centuries the TMC managed to maintain this deli-
cate balance,  but the steadily worsening commercial climate even-
tually  forced them to retrench.  Like the Rim Province before it,
the  TMC  found  the  strain of protecting the furthest worlds too
much of a burden. From -1500 on other Rule of Man successor states
in Alpha Crucis,  Dark Nebula,  Magyar and Reavers\' Deep routinely
raided worlds on the fringe of the TMC sphere (see _Reavers_), but
although  this  was a contributing strain,  it was not the primary
factor. The Reaver Era ended before the end of the TMC, and Reaver
attacks in any case concentrated on fringe worlds that had already
been  abandoned  by the TMC and lost interstellar technology.  The
primary  factors  were  economic depression and a widespread trend
toward isolationism, causing a shift to planetary self-reliance at
the expense of interplanetary trade.
    When the worlds near Easter in -1112 formed the Easter Concord
and  other  worlds began talking of forming their own unions,  the
TMC  decided to cut its losses.  In -1110 the corporation formally
transformed  into the Old Earth Union,  abandoning all worlds out-
side the Union to their own devices,  and becoming a small,  tight
group instead of a large, loose one.
    See also: Old Earth Union.
- ----

Notes: The Rim Province is my invention (well, the name anyway.
I\'m sure some such sub-division existed).
- ----
Here\'s a few more:

CULTURAL ROOTS REVIVAL:  Cultural movement that swept Terra in the
11th  and  10th  Century PI encouraging people to rediscover their
pre-spaceflight roots.  Old arts and crafts were revived; likewise
old architecture,  books,  plays,  dances, dresses, languages, and
songs.
    The  CRR  was  a  reaction to the transformation of the Terran
Mercantile Community  into the Old Earth Union and the loss of the
stars that many felt this represented,  a deliberate further aban-
donment  of the universe around,  a desire to forget what had been
lost  and  turn  to values that could not be lost.  In this it has
been likened to the neo-nationalist phenomenon observed on many of
the worlds abandoned to themselves during the Long Night,  but the
resemblance is only skin deep.  Where the neo-nationalist messages
were always "strength through unity" the CRR message was "strength
through diversity".


"PRIDE OF THE RIM":  Legendary  treasure ship which disappeared in
- -1690  and has since become the object of numerous fruitless trea-
sure hunts.
    When the bankrupt Rim Province went into voluntary liquidation
in -1690,  the planetary governor of Gashurzid (Solomani Rim 2602)
organized a coup.  He commandeered a 1.000.000 T ore transport and
renamed  it  PRIDE OF THE RIM.  He  thereupon  through a number of
manouvres of spurious legality contrived to have it\'s holds filled
with  precious  metal ingots,  state-of-the-art electronics,  rare
pharmaceuticals,  precious stones and other valuables, topping off
with  the  cream  of more than 2000 years worth of accumulated art
treasures looted from the top museums of the world.
    Escorted  by  a  squadron  of 2nd Empire cruisers he then left
Gashurzid en route for Terra.  But on the second jump PRIDE OF THE
RIM  failed  to  appear  at the other end.  The escort immidiately
organized  a search of the surrounding star systems,  but no trace
of the PRIDE was ever found.
    As  none of the identifiable parts of the cargo have ever been
seen again either, it is generally believed that the PRIDE suffer-
ed  a misjump,  and that it and its vast fortune is still drifting
around  somewhere  in  interstellar space.  PRIDE OF THE RIM is to
this  day  a  popular  bait  amongst  confidence tricksters of the
Solomani Rim.

  IIRC (and I haven\'t read the rules comprehensively for years :( ):

 1) Operator Guided (/wire-guided) missiles don\'t require the firing vehicle
to remain stationary, which is (AFAIK) rather unrealistic for modern ATGM-
equipped AFV\'s.

 2) Laser Designated rounds always hit unobscured targets, which makes heli
gunships a questionable investment in those rules, even before grav units.

 3) Homing missiles are way too flexible - firing at aircraft is OK, as
presumably they\'re handed off to the missile guidance system after radar
ID/tracking, but according to the rules a single gunner can dump homing
missiles off of multiple launch rails in a turn, against multiple AFV\'s
cowering in a tree-line, for example. This really concerns me, as the
capacity for abuse (if the above interpretation is correct, and I hope
it\'s not) is immense.

 4) IR Follow-up rounds are prone to abuse; dropping them might be nice.

Sounds like a good reason to _have_ flamethrowers (an attack to which
one\'s own forces are more resistant than the enemy\'s...).

Game Designers\' Workshop was established in 1973 as a wargame publisher. While
it initially concentrated on military simulations, it soon (1975) branched out
into role-playing games. The founding partners were Frank Chadwick, Rich
Banner, Loren Wiseman and Marc Miller.

GDW fell on hard times in the early 90\'s and closed its doors in 1996.

Clif, I have to put this to you simply...  I know this will hurt you... 
But, I think the entire TML hates you...  If you were a race, I think even
the most liberal member of the TML would say, "Wipe it out."...  Clif, I am
going to have to say this, but personally, I find you to be the kind of
thing even Arnold Judas Rimmer on the "Red Dwarf" would find to be morally
bankrupt...  Sadam Hussein would get a warmer reception here than you
would...  Hell, I would much rather have Adolf Hitler over for dinner, than
spend any time with you...  Lets face it, you are the least liked person on
the TML...  Even Anson, the person who loves everyone, cannot stand you...

Since the collapse resulted in the independence of the Baltic States, the
Ukraine and all of the Central Asian Republics, I severely doubt that there
was any over-riding plan involved.  The Russians have owned or coveted
those areas for centuries, and given Russia\'s history of being invaded, I
can\'t imagine them deliberately given up their buffer states.  Especially
the CAR, since the Soviet Union had enough trouble with Islamic militants
when they were under the USSR\'s thumb.

Fine.  Sell *your* computer and forward him the money.  Better yet,
volunteer with UNICEF and go to Egypt, which will get you far away from the

I don\'t think so!   It would be impossible for teh second rate units and

the regular forces

Other than that, it looks pretty good. Just what do you have going on at

Not really.  The only difference w/ TNE is the upper cap is a bit lower.   TL
12 is what TL15 was to the Imperium...  Highest commonly available.  Most
common overall is Oriflammes TL9 compared the Imperiums TL12 (isn\'t that
right?).

Maybe for teh Wilds, but not for the RC, much less the Hivers or the Spinward
States.

Well, tell you what, I\'ll post my Droyne Sport below (this was

Well, the only exact thing is the odds of making a roll (as per
the table in Basic).  What is considered sufficient can very.
A low level realistic campaign will consider 18 quite impressive
while a high level cinematic one will have skills over 20...

That being said, my experience is that you need a skill of
12 to be seen as "competant".  I\'ve always equated this to
Skill-1.  OTOH, in a physical skill 18 is very high.  In
some compaigns nobody will be this high, in others you may
get a bit over.  For mental skills 18 is a bit more reachable,
since the progression is flatter (but still pretty darn good),
I few people will get his high and a skill of 20 is something
that only a few characters will reach.  Since, in the games
I\'ve played, skill-4 was the highest I saw, I always equated
these to that.


> What about an Engineer..which skills and

>what levels does he need?


For a ship you definately need Mechanic (Jump Drive), Mechanic 
(Power Plant) and Mechanic (Manuever Drive).  I\'ve seen 
Engineering (Vehciles) which I think is the skill to fix
the misc parts of the ship (airlocks, hull breaches, etc.)
But as a GM I\'ve been thinking of letting players use any
mechanic skill for these kinds of routine things.

>  Merchant skills aren\'t the same, how do

How so?  A Merchant 15 is as good a merchant as Mechanic (Power
Plant) 15 is at being a mechanic.


>What about combat skills...do they need to be
>higher than non-combat skills, as implied in the B book?


Well, they only need to be higher because you are generally
keen not to die and so want to make sure you suceed.

>

>Then let\'s talk about task levels... ;->


Well, your task level is to roll under your skill.  Now
you apply modifiers.  I came up with the following to
help me decide...


<fontfamily><param>New_York</param><bigger><bigger> 0 standard
- -2 tricky
- -4 hard/difficult
- -6 very hard
- -8 formidible
- -10 almost impossible

Osseskil


His background was that his Oytrip was planning on expanding
into trade and had sent him out to scout out the Spinward Marches.


ST	9
DX	13	
IQ	13
HT	11


The racial package I used had a -3 to ST, I bought it up
a couple of levels so he could at least use some weapons
without recoil problems.  He wasn\'t primarily a combat
character, but he also got -3 hit points so I bought
up HT so he would have at least a decent chance of making
a roll to stay conscious or alive (if I was doing it again
I might have gone with a 12).  He needed to be good at a lot
of skills so I gave him an IQ and DX of 13.


The Racial package gave him the following advantages.

Night Vision (1/2 Dark. Pen.)
Claws
Invisibility
Winged Flight
Peripheral Vision


Because I wanted him to be able to fit into an existing group 
that had most thing covered, and because he was a Sport, I
wanted him to be able to do a lot of different things so
he could full in as needed...

I\'m thinking of a code of behavior that expresses a set of
values.  Much of the discussion here seems to be centered around
generalities such as "Duty, honor, and loyalty" and "obligee de
noblesse". I would expect political and ethical theorists of the
Imperium to be more specific in outlining what a noble ideally
should and should not do.

I\'ve noticed the same problem, and your notion of restricting
trading partners seems to be a good idea. I\'d look at ruling that
SomeWhere needs to have at least 5% of Powerhouse\'s GDP before
SomeWhere can be considered a significant trading partner of
Powerhouse.

For that matter, most of the mainstream religions have holy days
tied to the lunar and solar cycles of earth.  How would someone
on a moonless world with a different year and length of day
calculate the date of the Jewish passover or Christian Easter? 
Would they keep compatibility with earth dating and lose the
all connection with the natural cycles of the planet, follow the natural
cycles and sacrifice the earth standard calendar, or try some compromise?

I liked that trilogy, too, but I don\'t see a big role for that
particular theme in Traveller.
The nobility in her Familias Regnant universe ("Hunting Party",
"Sporting Chance", "Winning Colors") looks a lot like the
Imperial nobility.  They also deal with problems of cloning nobles
and the social implications of extended lifespans. She uses rejuvenation
instead of anagathics, but the issues are similar. The Navy in those and
the spinoff series ("Once a Hero", "Rules of Engagement") looks a lot like
the Imperial Navy, too.

But isn\'t that how common law does change? A persuasive lawyer
makes a convincing case that the "common law" as accepted is not
fair in his particular case, and a judge issues a ruling which
sets a new precedent. If the new precedent is followed instead of the older
ones, common law changes slightly.   
IIUC, in most US law schools, Constitutional Law has much less to do with
the text of the constitution, than with the body of precedents and "common
law" that have grown up around it.

Perhaps those who applied the label "Confucius of the 24th century" had no
better grasp of Confucianism than I do. Someone correct me if I am wrong,
but my picture of Confucius is that of a moral and ethical
philosopher, with an intellectual approach to proper principles
of government. I also understand that he believed in "heaven" or
"the gods" but claimed no expertise in those subjects.  His
philosophy eventually became highly influential in Chinese
government.
That\'s about as far as the resemblance goes. I\'d attribute the adaptation
of the moral principles to a noble-style government to a much later Sylean
writer.

I have several biology textbooks plus an encyclopedia which
discuss these same issues, in greater or lesser detail. It\'s one reason for
including altitude. I would also prefer an average yearly temp to highs-
and-lows.  "Biomes" are primarily determined by plant cover, and
some of the Terrain types in Traveller do correspond roughly to
biomes.  You can only go so far, though, because you might not have
conifers or grasses any more than you have lions and clams in a different
world\'s biology.  A broad similarity based on similar ecology and
environment falls along the same lines of reasoning as the Animal encounter
generation.

How certain is it that it was overgrazing and not a change in climate
associated with the end of the last ice age?
For world-building purposes, I\'d call temperature and humidity
the primary determiners of vegetation type. Dependence of weather on
vegetation would be a second order effect.

True...but this is a game, not a PhD thesis. My philosophy is
that if a little added realism means a lot more complexity,
forget the complexity and keep it simple. OTOH, if a little bit
more complex means a lot more realistic, then go for the realism.

These posting don\'t even have anything to do with the matter at hand, they 
(IMNSHO) are to do with a dislike of a particular individual which resembles
the worst of Vargr pack mentality. Now said individual may have said some
*really* stupid and even offensive things, but there is absolutely no call for
this.

And for said individual, you don\'t get off either, you are simply provoking
these attacks. You may have been right royally toasted over some comments
and hauled across the coals by "the head"; but you are simply provoking
these attacks. How about trying something novel like acting responsibly and
making meaningful contributions to debates at least a little related to Traveller.
If you find something sufficently annoying that you can\'t control yourself and
keep on your hands, just say it once and say it intelligently and leave it at
that. Most people here are intelligent enough to actually see the obvious and
figure out what going on.

Now I will get off my soapbox and convert it into a racer for my children (a
much better use) and hope that the level of posting can rise above that which
I would expect from those children.

Under the late, unlamented \'Old Regime\', they would *NEVER* have allowed 
Yeltsin on tv looking as bad as he does.  And they would *NEVER* shown the 
power struggle for his successor.  And under *no* circumstances would they 
have allowed anybody outside of the Supreme Soviet to see just how bad things 
really *are* there.

All in all, it looks like a collapse to me.

difficult and lengthy read (English is not my primary language, and 1998
was a little scarce in free time) but I liked it a lot.

The novel is a mostly fictional cronichle of the various adventures of the
two English Astronomers, which were commissioned to define the boundary
between Pennsylvania and Maryland in the 18th Century.

In the novel, they set course using compass, sextant and other instruments,
and were followed by a crew of axemen and engineers which cleared a path
through forests, measured distances using chains and set pillars to fix the
various points along the line.

I\'m wondering if this could be a good idea for a Traveller scenario.
Obviously it only makes sense on a low-tech planet (GPS works best than
chains and pillars). Two (or more) states on a balkanized, low TL planet
could ask a party of engineers to use high tech instruments to trace a
boundary across a continent. The line should be easily recognizable without
using high TL instruments (no radio beacons, laser, satellites) and would
cross various different terrains, obviously teeming with more or less
hostile fauna and natives.

I think that a small craft (a Scout, for example) could act as a sort of
orbital relay base, but most of the work should be on the ground, and even
with TL 12-13 stuff cutting down trees and setting artifical landmarks
should require a lot of work.

This could be a good scenario for a Scout team. The referee may easily
introduce techincal, diplomatic and even military complications along the way.

Any further ideas on this?

LOL.

Speaking of Kobolds and Vargr . . .

Now that there is a great new mutliplayer capable game where you can fight
Kobolds by the score (Baldurs Gate), I\'m thinking that a similar game with a
Traveller theme, with Vargr Corsairs replacing Knee-binting Kobolds, and
certainly improving on them, would be a knock out.

I want to play Traveller like this!  :-)

I think the point is that it wasn\'t a full scale war.

Yes, there is the precedent of the Civil War, but I suspect there would be
political difficulties sending the armed forces in to work over a whole
state.  If it was done carefully and democratically, it might be possible
to convince the US government that the game wasn\'t worth the candle.

Think about it:  would you like to see another Civil War?  Mightn\'t it be
possible that enough people in the other states felt that letting Texas go
was a lesser evil than sending the troops in?

That\'s what I suspect happened.

As for the Chelsea Clinton joke:  fine, but it won\'t age well.

According to Alien Module 6 (Solomani) Estigarribia was succeeded by his
chief of staff.  It\'s not clear that this was his son, and, unless the
Terran Confederation had instituted hereditary succession in the Navy (???)
it probably wouldn\'t have been, IMHO.

Otherwise, this is pretty cool material.

But MT is just the compilation of all the previous good books with
commentary (analagous to the Old Testament and New Testament...). Aside for
combat and the strikerisation of HG I see no differences, except the errata
(*).

(*) almost as good as the King James Bible edition which stated \'Thou shalt

\'The Sparrow\' by Mary Alos Ferrar (I think that\'s the surname - will have
to check) is all about a Jesuit mission by STL ship to a world in a nearby

I\'d say the best way to get to Traveller would be to *not* cancel the

That should be Ares (Mars) as opposed to Aries ( a sign of the Zodiac).

I\'d like to see this- please post it, or send it to me privately if others
don\'t want
to see it...

I thought I\'d throw in my 2 creds on this topic as well...

I think that Earth\'s religions and holidays would be taken with the
individuals
to the New Worlds much the same way that immigrants brought them to the
US. with them.
They wouldn\'t change incredibly (if at all), and would still be celebrated
according
to earth\'s cycles. These would be a "Fundamentalist" type people- planets
may
well be discovered and colonized with the principles, or activities of the
religion/s
in mind.

A second group would be the Natives of the planets encountered. I think that they
would tend to have their own religions, philosophies, etc. Some religions would be
bent on "teaching them the light" and subjugating them, while others may accept
theirs as just another religion.
Some of these natives would join the "new religions" and there may even be
political reasons behind these (Thinking of Japan\'s history of changing religions
to keep any single one from having too much power in their society.)
Others would consider the new religion/s to be competition to their own beliefs
and the nature of competition would run from mild rivalry, to outright warfare.

I think that many of the Colonists would become worshippers of the religions of those
planets that they landed on. Believing the "truths" of the natives to be more accurate
than those of their own religions and cultures.

And, yet another group, would decide that bits and pieces of all of the new
religions mix with the old to create New Age religions of different types. Or
simply all are "thrown out" for newer ideals and such.

As for holidays, those which are of a religious nature would probably be celebrated
by these various groups according to which of the above "methods of worship"
they chose to participate in...
Other holidays would probably be taken with colonists to their new worlds, and
celebrated by the Earth calendar- that way when they get a Merry Christmas (for
example) from home, they\'re celebrating Christmas on their new planet as well.
Then historical events on each individual world would probably create new holidays,
and many holidays of the worlds that people were on would get celebrated for
political, social, or religious reasons as well.

The variations on what the Colonists and Natives would do are about the same
as the variations that have appeared on earth, exponentially increased by the
number of planets that were colonized, and the conditions involved in that
colonization- I would think.

Later.

Because:

1) it may not be his - it could be his employer\'s.

2) it will hardly cover the cost of treatment.

3) You are assuming he can get a reasonable return on the price of his

There again, maybe I\'m a little backward in thinking that I\'ll let slip a
spam from someone making an appeal to raise money for their sick child.

Of course, it could all just be a money grubbing hoax in which case let
loose the dogs of war.

Anyway, for the record;

1) Unlike Legate\'s comment, I don\'t hate Clif. He annoys me  (certainly a
while ago but he seems to be calming down). Personnaly, if I got to commit
Xenocide on anything it\'d be the K\'Kree.

2) Reading the posts previous to this, I thought I\'d let it (the spam)
slide, but you seem to be using it as an excuse to flame \'Clif\', which
behaves in the way you objected to when he did it with respect to Jesse. I
feel in this case you\'re being harsh. However, I would advise Clif to
minimise his posts for a while to avoid flare ups like this.

3) I did ask Rob to intervene after reading the best part of a week\'s TML,
and he appears to have taken the warning option. IMO Clif appears to be
trying to avoid comments that were aggravating people. If he keeps it up
that\'s fair enough, if not I would happily support Rob M removing him. So
give him a chance?

All the best,

Dom

Again.

You\'ve been on this list, Chris, I think as long as I have (remember the
Traveller and Xboat lists?) and know that occasionally (like monthly) the
traffic becomes completely non-traveller and at least somewhat acidic in
nature.

Several calls for sanity in the past have proven useless.  I once even had
a canned email I sent to individuals who I thought were getting completely
off-topic.  This worked for a little while (I think) but was labor
intensive.

>I just wish everyone would just relax a bit and let the whole thing just
>die.

I\'d say "hear, hear" if I thought it would do any good.

There are several lists now; The Tech list, a writers list, a Classic
Traveller list (which, alas, has little or no traffic), I might be seen to
advocate an even further division into a "flame war" list, a "gurps
traveller" list, and a "designs only" list.  The problem will become the
crossposting and relevancy-questionable posts on all lists.

And then there\'s killfiles, or for eudora users filtering specific email
addresses to "trash".

When I started converting my MegaTraveller campaign over to GURPS back in
\'93, I came up with the following:

     Engineer/TL (Life-Support)
     Engineer/TL (Power Plant)
     Engineer/TL (Maneuver Drive)
     Engineer/TL (Jump Drive)
     Electronics/TL (Life Support)
     Electronics/TL (Manoeuvre Drive)
     Electronics/TL (Power Plant)
     Electronics/TL (Jump Drive)

According to GURPS Basic Set, Third Edition - Revised (p 60), "a successful
roll [against Engineer skill] will let you (for example): ... diagnose a
mechanical or electrical problem; perform a repair...."  (A successful roll
against Electronics skill will let one "...diagnose a glitch; perform a
repair....")  I\'m therefore not certain Mechanic skill is required, but if
so, I would include:

     Mechanic/TL (Power Plant)
     Mechanic/TL (Life Support)
     Mechanic/TL (Jump Drive)

I would include Mechanic (Manoeuvre Drive) if HEPlaR technology were being
used, but I don\'t think it would be necessary for thruster plates.

However, both Electronics/TL and Engineer/TL are primarily concerned with
designing the specified equipment, not with operating it on a routine
basis.  Shouldn\'t there also be some sort of professional skill required,
such as Starship Engineer?  And if so, should it have the required
specialties, as above, or should it just be a generic skill?

Here are the pagan festivals/sabats and common/christian holiday
correspondances as I can recon them:

Feb 1 or 2 -- Imbolc -- "Groundhog\'s Day"
Mar 20 -- Ostara -- Vernal Equanox, "Easter" 
May 1 -- Beltaine -- "May Day"
June 21 -- Summer Solstice "?" (Memorial day weekend? Independance Day in
US? Do any other countries have a near-equivalence to this holiday?)
Aug 1 -- Lughnasadh, first harvest festival, Festvial of Grain.  
Sept 23 -- Mabon, Autumnal Equanox.  Another Harvest Festival
Oct 31, Nov 1 -- Samhain.  Final Harvest. Day to honor the dead.
"Holloween/All Souls"
Dec. 21 -- Yule, Winter Solstice.  "Christmas, Haunaka(sp?), et al..."

It is interesting to note that in the southern hemisphere the sabats are
reversed, as the seasons are reversed from those in the northern
hemisphere.  I have been told this from pagans living in Austrailia and
New Zealand.

OBTrav: How would pagan/wiccan colonists react to a world in which there
are no seasons.  Or a world which is tidaly locked?  They may have to rely
on the time on Earth. Keeping each second as acurately as they can.  This
sect may become some of the best clockmakers in the galaxy!

Let\'s take this off-list.

me personally and let me know that a cheque/money order is in the mail. My

What you have are point producers (trees) and area producers (grasses).

If you can manage it, I\'d like to see a system that generates a biome,
starting from the climate and working through producers to primary and
secondary consumers.

Then once that is done, I\'d like it to describe the biochemistry and
physical appearance of the lifeforms!

(OK, I know that the second part is a really tall order.)

Just think of this as the biological equivalent of Bruce\'s Definative
Sensor Rules.

    'body' => 'My friends,

First, thanks to those who have replied already regarding
corrections to my First Contact timeline.  I have integrated the
corrections given so far, and apologize for my lack of resource
materials to insure the correctness of my pre-1978 data.  (Also,
I\'ve corrected the 1978 entry to reflect Real World (tm) leaving TU
timeline.)  Please, continue with the comments.  I appreciate them,
and find them very helpful.

Second, regarding my folly with the Greater Republic of Texas. 
True, I am a Texan, and am very proud of my state.  For all of our
resources, in the Real World (tm), the state of Texas doesn\'t have
the political savvy or the military capacity to make such a
secession, nor does it want to, for the most part.  (There are those
radical few, but I prefer a more practical viewpoint.)  This was
mostly written in as homage to those on the TML who first made me
feel welcome.  They play 2300AD as well, and this political
development has its place in that timeline.

In support of the secession, let me present the following:  By 2023,
the United States has been engaged in a three-year Trade War with
Japan and other major powers of the time, and are now two years into
an eight-year long Depression.  Things are bad; the US has not yet
recovered from the economic straightjacket it has found itself in.
Moses Adamson, understanding the value of the natural resources, etc,
under Texas authority (world\'s largest source of Helium [West Texas];
a significant amount of domestic petroleum; supplementing or
supplying electricity to over 27 states [Nichols Power Plant,
Amarillo, TX]; agricultural production; high tech industry [Austin
and Dallas]; the coordination of the US space program [Houston Space
Center, Houston, TX]; and others I\'m not currently aware of), and
seeing a means to achieve his personal goal, rallies a political
movement that promised a surge in the Texan economy.  Due to the
depression and other factors, a peace accord is settled between the
US and GRT before the situation deteriorated to war.  If the two
nations had gone to war, most assuredly the US would have won,
although at some loss in resources.  (Moses did find some support
with some radical factions that would have tried desperate maneuvers.
However, that could have been dealt with in time.)  In addition, war
tends to be good for the economy.

However, Moses Adamson, unbeknownst to the general public, had a
Special psionic power, similar to the Mule from the Foundation
series by Isaac Asimov.  He had the capacity to control minds of
those whom he met and physically touched.  One handshake was all it
took.  When President Adamson died, he left behind the legacy of the
GRT.  (Eventually, it will rejoin the US.  Even before the end of
the 21st century, the two are operating in tandem on many projects. 
The cultural inertia will eventually succeed.  However, for the
period of First Contact, they are two politically separate
entities.)

In addition, his grandson, now coming of age during the First
Contact era, shows similar psionic potential, and sees a lot of
opportunity in joining the Terran Exploration Service or the Terran
Navy after the Vilani interstellar empire Ziru Sirka is contacted by
the Starleaper I.  (Think Pocket Empires in the early days of
Solomani Exploration.  The scenario should be most entertaining.)

Third, the Chelsea Clinton line, while humorous, will get old soon. 
I will most likely remove it.  However, it does show a point: 
Margaret Inch is not the first female US President; there have been
others before her.  Also, I get a personal kick out of imagining
Chelsea\'s campaign slogan.  She runs Republican and starts most
speeches with "While I may be my father\'s daughter, I have proven
that I am not my father."  I apologize should this have offended
anyone, and hope that it is taken in the spirit of fun in which it
was intended.

Please keep the comments and suggestions coming.  I want to use 
a timeline that makes some logical sense, and provides for some 
interesting role-play opportunities.  Your comments help make it so, 
and keeps the spirit that I am striving for.  I appreciate your 
assistance and input, and look forward to hearing more.  Also, does 
anyone have any additions they\'d like me to consider adding?

Thanks for your time and your input.

In Service,
Jason

There\'s another story I forget both the title and the author) where the 
premise is essentially that aliens land on Earth in pursuit of a
cleansing, holy war... and G*d is really on their side. We end up on

frustrating).  Some of you have gotten into the habit of
including the version number in the file name.  This is bad,
because it means that you have to notify us when you release a

Actually, since Texas, (and California, IIRC) are unique in that they were
independent republics, not territories, before they voluntarily joined the
US, they might be able to generate enough legal legs to stand on in a
sesession action.

OTOH, since the only ones who really wnat to do it are loonies the
Republic of Texas folks or the Montana Freemen, it\'s unlikely to happen.

My guess is it\'s an Ancients Site, quite the seminal Ancients Site, too,
considering this is where Grampaw came to get his workers so long ago. 

Maybe the bit about finding the drive Grampaw hid ^h^h^h^h \'discovering

No, a moderated list is NOT the answer, unless you\'re volunteering to

With all due respect, sir, I believe that you underestimate the quality
of Army and Air National Guard units.  The 49th Armored Division,
TXARNG, is equipped with more M1 Abrams tanks (I\'m not sure whether they
are vanilla M1s or M1A1s) than any Active Component division.  I don\'t
know what assets are found in the Texas ANG, but neigboring Louisiana
has F-15Cs, the same air-superiority fighter found in the Active
Component.  While Guard units may not spend as much time training as AC
units (of course, they also don\'t waste as much time doing things such
as post beautification...), the National Guard has the advantage of many
long-service members, staying in the same units for 10 years or more,
working together with the same fellow Guard members.  Contrast this with
the routine transfer of AC personnel every 2-3 years.  Finally, many AC
soldiers in Texas (for instance) have ties to Texas, which may make them
less effective fighting fellow Texans.

Having said all this, I will admit that the AC could defeat the Texas
Army and Air National Guard, given enough expenditure of resources.  The
question is, would it be worth the cost?  I don\'t know.  That would be a
question for the President, the Congress, and, in the end, public
opinion.

Here here! I was on a list that went from lightly moderated to heavily
moderated, complete with keywords for topics and all that. The traffic
dropped by half and, frankly, it sucked.

I much prefer the mature conversation and exchange of ideas on this list
(well, with some notable lapses ...). Even if we do get off-topic
occasionally, it is normally not *too* far off, and it is also normally
quite educational.

BTW, thanks to everyone who responded to the vacc suit, flying a grav
vehicle, and imperial combat helmet posts. I found the information provided
most useful.

ObTrav: Once again, I was on the road driving, and I began to look at the
construction of bridges and overpasses. It put me in the mind to think about
high-tech construction.

In 2300AD there was a material called "construction composites" listed on
the armor rating table. Does anyone have a clue what these were supposed to
represent?

I guess more to my question -- would high-tech societies use exotic and
advanced materials for the construction of things like overpasses, bridges,
houses, and the like? Or would the old standbys of stone, plaster and wood
still see wide use? My instinct is to believe there would be a combination
of materials used, based on local availability, aesthetics, and so on. But
for things like bridges (for example) there might be definite benefits for
using a material like superdense instead of regular steel in the structure.

Oh, and does superdense rust? What about bonded and coherent superdense?

Its true!  When I was a teen, I shot a can of ravioli at point blank range
with only a .22 and had a lot of it on my clothes, as a result.  : )

And also have the UK not cancel Blue ( Ummm? can\'t remember name - Steel?)
and then invest in HOTOL in the mid 80\'s, deploying in the mid 90\'s.

    'body' => 'Eris\' suggestion to post some characters got me thinking, so here is my
first contribution :)

There are presently three methods for generating GURPS Traveller characters.
They are:

1.) Build from scratch as a GURPS character.

2.) Build using the templates given in the GURPS Traveller book, which are
basically partially completed characters that you then customize.

3.) The UNOFFICIAL but entertaining random creation system created by Robert
M. Brown in the article "Some Classic Randomness" and published by Pyramid
Online. This system, while it is not exactly like the old Classic system (no
survival rolls, lots more skills, no "mustering out"), does allow for
varying point levels and has a good \'feel\' to it. It\'s probably worth the
$15 for a year\'s subscription just for those of you who would like to use it
:)

The following is a character I created using this third method. Following
the character, I will explain how I \'tweaked\'it, and special issues arising
from the use of these tables.

Randomly Generated Merchant Captain (snazzy name, eh?)    5 terms

ATTRIBUTES

ST 10 DX 12 IQ 13 HT 11

ADVANTAGES

Charisma +1, Handsome, Status 1, Courtesy Rank 5 (Captain), Wealth

DISADVANTAGES

Overconfidence, Callous

SKILLS

Computer Operation-13, Piloting (Starship)-14, (Grav Vehicle)-13 Lang:

Suit-12, Mechanic (Power Plant)-13, Diplomacy-13, Administration-13,
Bribery-13**, Knife-13, Accounting-11

* Includes the +2 IQ bonus
** There is no actual "Bribery" skill in GURPS, but it is listed in the
Social skills group. If you wanted to use it, I suggest making it a
Mental/Easy skill defaulting to IQ-4; otherwise, make this something like
Savior-Faire or Fast-Talk.

POINTS

Attributes: 60 Ads: 54 Disads: -16, Quirks: 0, Skills: 72 TOTAL POINTS: 170

all in all, a good character, one I would be happy to play. His Wealth
advantage makes up for the lack of mustering out benefits (as he can buy a
LOT of stuff with 4x starting wealth of Cr 15,000), he has decent skills for
what he does, and some very interesting \'color\' skills.
    I noticed that when rolling up this character, a lot of the skills came
out at odd numbers that don\'t really fit in the GURPS skill buying charts. I
redistributed those points to other skills to make them come out even. A GM
could just let them be and say the character is close to improving.
    This character, if he were built by the suggested guidelines, could have
up to 40 points in Disadvantages and up to 5 one-point "Quirks". This would
lower his point total to 141 points.

The tables provide not only skills but Advantages and Disadvantages,
including stat increases. The suggestion is and I agree with it, to cap
attributes at 15, otherwise a lucky roller could wind up with an 18 IQ or
some such, which is usually quite unattainable to any starting GURPS Player
Character.

Next, I\'ll whip up a character using the template system and post that.

I thnk I have spotted the difference, are you including cost and mass of

I still think you will need more bridge crew, but that is a personal thing,
they fit within the rules, but have a lot more work to do than other

Sounds about right to me...  It seems when you have a decent, honorable

everyone wants to tear it down.  They go on about the fact that Mormons

I have looked high and low, and have thus far not been able to 
discover what is hidden canonically at the outermost planet of our 
Solar System.  When designing that portion of the Timeline, I 
intentionally left it secretive and urgent, and decided to keep with 
canon from the get-go.  Therefore, Pluto had to be interdicted from 
the start.  The explosions were inspired by GT:BTC.  It seems that 
every research center explodes at least once before it makes a 
breakthrough, even the psionic ones.  Shortly thereafter, the US 
convinced the UN to hold the secret, based on whatever was discovered 
there.

My current thoughts center on the Helluva Ancient Site idea, with a
lot of things to research.  (Perhaps this is the reason Terra jumps
TLs so quickly during the early IW period, and why Terra remains so
advanced in engineering and medicine well into the future.)

Marc, Loren, do you have anything you could contribute to this 
discussion?  Or is it privileged information soon to be revealed in 
either GT:Solomani Rim or T5 SAEP: First Contact?  Or is that 
something canon will never define?

Other options could include: alternate lifeforms, alternate Elder 
race site, a one-way gateway to alternate location(s)/dimension(s) 
(or even time periods) being explored by Solomani but never 
completely grokked, or a hyperintelligent and near-immortal yet 
non-mobile lifeform/construct.

Hey, it may even be a strange ripple in the time-space continuum,
similar to the wilder Bermuda Triangle theories, that the Solomani
are trying to duplicate.  Unfortunately, they keep losing their
researchers.  :) 

So, I really didn\'t answer that question.  I still looking for what 
feel like a good roleplaying opportunity that fits well with my 
campaign milieu before I settle on that.  Until then...

The Jewish calendar *isn\'t* tied to the lunar/solar cycles. It was
*based* on them, but for centuries it\'s been based on a series of rules
that have nothing to do with astronomy. 

And the various christian churches use a method to calculate the date
of Easter that is also divorced from the actual astronomical events.
The Orthodox Churches use a slightly different calculation, but
*neither* is synched correctly with the moon.

The date of easter is *supposedly* the first sunday after the first
full moon after the spring equinox. But the date gotten by actually
using astronomical data can be as much as a month off from the one
gotten via the formulas the churches use.

There *is* talk of switching to the actual astronomical date starting
in 2000. But no one knows for sure if this will actually happen.

Islam will have *big* problems off Earth. Their months start when the
first sliver of the new moon is *observed* at sunset. You can calculate
when the next month *should* start, but it\'s the actual observation
that counts. And yes, this means that the month can be different in
different cities!

Well, as noted above, Judaism and Christianity are *already* divorced
from the cycles of earth except for the day/night cycle. Islam is so
tied to them that they are going to have to make some major adjustments
when they move off planet.

I have no idea about Hindu or Buddhist issues, nor those of any other
religions.

This gets into one of the harder to grasp (emotionally) aspects of
living on another planet. The *day* is a different length. So is the
year. This means that (for example) on Mars, the day is about 24.66
hours. Which means that 365 earth days are 355.23 martian days. So
following the earth calendar is a *major* pain.

BTW, there is *one* bit of terminology that has already been adopted
for dealing with observations from the various Mars landers. A local
planetary day is called a "sol" (probably short for solar day) so as to
avoid confusion with the 24-hour day that we use. I figure this will
perpetuate into the future.

So to people in the future, "day" will mean 24 hours (86400 seconds).
Sol will mean a *local* planetary day unless you explicitly specific
another planet. 

Likewise hour will mean the standard 3600 second period, while some
other term will be used for the subdivisions of the sol. I\'m leaning
towards "chron" as the term. For convenience, a sol will always be
divided evenly into chrons. How many will depend on the actual length
of the sol, as well as on how conveniently the sol can be divided into
work shifts and the like. Ten is a bad number in most cases because
only 2 and 5 go into it evenly, and 2 shifts or 5 shifts per sol seem
unlikely. 12 and 24 are good because they divide by 3, 4, 6, etc. 

I don\'t really see a need for a local time unit smaller than the chron.
More likely, just as many timeclocks do now, the chron will be divided
into hundreths (centichrons, possibly referred to as cents), or
thousandths (millichrons, or mils).

Going in the other direction, given the nature of the Imperial
calendar, I suspect that month will be relegated to a strictly local
reckoning of sols. Year will be the standard Imperial year of 365 days.
Anno will be the local year (plural is annum).

I\'m willing to bet that most local festivals will be figured according
to the local calendar, whereas Imperial festivals will be on whatever
sol starts closest to the start of the Imperial date. Which means that
an Imperial (or other off planet) holiday could happen several times an
anno or only once every few annums. It all depends on how long the anno
is.

BTW, note that without the year/anno and day/sol distinctions the above
paragraph would be a *lot* more complicated!

I *am* going to write an article on this. But in the meantime, I give
permission to use the terminology in any SF material. We *need* a
standard way of talking about this stuff!

I\'ve read a story by David Brin? where we make contact with "galactic

And old theme....

I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
Why so can I, or so can any man; but will they come when you do call
for them?
- - Shakespeare, King Henry IV, Part I

It\'s a *rude* shock to players when the native shaman/priest/whatever
calls upon the spirits/god/whatever AND GETS AN ANSWER!

   Shaman: "Va\'al doesn\'t want you to mine here."
Player #1: "So? What\'s he gonna do, strike me with lightning?"
<KRAKABOOM> (lightning from a clear sky)
Player #2: (looking at the smoking patch of fused earth that used to
be player #1)
            "Uh... right. Where would Va\'al like us to put the mine?"

*Justifying* the response can get tricky, but Star Trek did it enough
times. With those examples, most GMs ought to be able to do a *better*
job.

But you\'ll have plants/animals that fill the same ecological "niche".
The "conifer equivalent" may not look a lot like the terran equivalent,
but it will be "evergreen", tend more to wide spread, near surface
roots, and be more tolerant of cold and low precip than the "deciduous"
equivalent. And the sap will even tend to be more "resinous" because
that cuts down on water loss.

If you\'ve got the references handy, it\'d be nice to have a list of
known biomes (with a rough description of the limiting conditions for
them). Then the rest of us can try to come up with possibilities for
the less terrestrial planets/environments.

A couple recent additions I\'ll offer are "deep rock", and "mid ocean
vent". They\'ve discovered that *the* most common lifeform on earth are
chemosynthetic bacteria living in micro-cracks in crustal rock. They\'ve
been found *miles* deep. The best estimates of the total mass of such
bacteria has them outmassing the rest of the biosphere!

The mid-ocean vent biome would be the critters living around the "black
smokers". Chemosynthetic bacteria are the base of the food chain, with
some odd sponges and those enormous tube worms feeding off them. And
then the crabs and other critters feedong off the others. The earth
could get dumped into deep space and these critters would survive until
the ocean froze around them. 

And the deep rock bacteria would just metabolize ever more slowwly
until the earth cooled enough for them to freeze. But that\'d take a
*long* time given the heat leaking up through the crust.

I\'ll bet that any planet with a *sub*-surface temp in the right range
and that was massive enough to have had liquid water for at least a
million years or so will have the deep rock bacteria.

And for those who want to *really* be "different" in their Traveller
Universe, consider that there\'s no reason why time as experienced on
board the ship, and out in normal space should match.

H. Beam Piper had jumps take almost no time in realspace, but the folks
on board ship experienced time during the jump...

Well, clear back in the 60s they had satellite observations showing the
steady advance of the Sahara. And they spotted some anomalies (green
spots surrounded by new desert). Investigation on the ground showed
*two* things. First, an irrigation system based on well pumped water
(present in lots of other places). Second, *fences*, to control
grazing. 

In *historical* times the Middle East has been changed from climax
forest to desert, simply by uncontrolled grazing of goats and over
harvest of timber. Lebanon used to be a *major* timber producing
region. But not only did they over harvest, but the free-ranging goats
ate the saplings. 

Grasses and trees *both* transpire *major* amounts of water. And in the
climate in the middle east and northern Africa, once the plants are
gone, the upper layers of the soil dry into a close approximation of
baked clay, and any subsurface water *stays* subsurface. And the rains
run off instead of getting absorbed.

It could probably be handled by a precipitation modifier for
vegetation. And a suggestion that in some cases it might be a good idea
to check the vegetation against the adjusted precip.

	I would much prefer not to go to a moderated list. I like to think
that I, and most of the other members on the list, are adults who can
choose for ourselves what to pay attention to and what not, rather
than expect one person to predigest and censor everything for us.

	Problems like this seem to crop up annually on the list. Usually,
they die down when enough people decide to just not respond to
flagrant provocations. For those rare instances where an individual
continues to be offensive and launches new attacks even in replies to
unrelated emails, the list moderator can remove that one individual
from the list.

	Again, I would rather react appropriately to problem posts/posters
AFTER giving them a chance, instead of trying to pre-censor
everything.

Actually, as I noted, even a tidally locked world will have seasons
unless its orbit is *perfectly* circular. That\'s because the planet
tries to rotate at a uniform rate, but with an elliptical orbit, that
means that the center of the locked face isn\'t always pointing directly
at the star. Thus the terminator shifts east and west once a year. 

Also, the seasons *we* are used to are due to earth\'s axial tilt. It\'s
also possible to have seasons due to the ellipticity of the planetary
orbit (Brian Aldiss\'s "Helliconia" is an extreme example of this). 

On earth, we are closest to the sun during the middle of winter in the
northern hemisphere. But Earth\'s orbit isn\'t all that eccentric. 

Some planets may have significant orbital *and* axial seasons. Giving
you some really weird stuff to keep track of. 

Want some fun? Consider pagan/wiccan colonists on Mars. The moons are a
*lot* smaller (just speeding dots of light). And as observed from the
surface, one of them goes *backwards*. Their periods are really short
too. A matter of a day or two for one, mere hours for the other. 

And won\'t it be fun recalculating the astrological influences. For one
thing, the zodiac will be different because Mar\'s orbit is inclined
differently than Earth\'s, so the sun moves thru different
constellations. And what does it mean to have *Earth* in one of the
houses? :-)

The farther you get from our solar system the more the very
constellations will change.

	President Bush took the airborne leg of the nuclear triad off
24-hour alert during (IIRC) his second term. A bit later, the
National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP, pronounced Kneecap,
also known as Looking Glass) also stopped its historic 30 or 40 years
of continuous flight (with different planes, not the same one for 30
years ...).

  According to their descriptions in GURPS engineering skills are
difficult to learn _scientific_ skills mostly concerned with designing and
modifying the systems they concern. (same for electronics)  A free-trader 
ship operating in friendly territory with regular access to high-quality
starports would have little use for these IMO. (OK, maybe just a point or
two for the chief engineer.)
  Navy/starmerc vessels would probably have better trained (and paid)
engineers with high-level engineering and electronics skills just so that
they can rebuild all the systems that have been shot to pieces in combat.

 Mechanics is used to "diagnose and fix ordinary mechanical problems"
according to the description . I believe this should be the baseline skill
for engineering/maintenance personell. Even if you feel engineer skills
are required, it should probably be just the chief engineer that has them.
Assistants should be able to get by just with mechanics skills.

  IMO the various mechanic skills should fill this niche quite nicely.

Let me guess.  The lurkers support you in private mail.  To date, you have
done little but insult people, make baseless accusations, and genrally act

Tone it down, take it to private mail, or piss off.

Diamond based semiconductors have a high immunity as well.  I would 
expect a large space based industry to invest heavily into the research 
and development of these devices.

Sure, but I don\'t think it\'s a bug.

PS. Could you use some other way of indicating quotes? I get the digest,

No need to explain... the efficient use of puffins as Slid Weapons is
well-known, so it is only natural that someone would employ the streamlined
penguin as a thrown weapon.

Frankly, I\'d be tempted to mark the line by using the ship\'s laser to
fuse it into the soil and cut it into rock. But you still need to do a
*lot* of surveying work first. 

For one thing, even with IISS quality gear, it\'ll take a while to just
establish *where* the poles and equator are. And then determing
latitude on the surface may or may not be easy, depending on the
availability of a usable pole star for making observations.

  Would you like to explain to me how anybody is supposed to have skill
levels of 18 (let alone over 18)? In my experience a qualified starship
crewmember will need at least 20 or so different skills to even get a job.
My character has 38, and is still lacking some crucial ones. (I conned my
way into the crew, basically. Please don\'t tell the captain.) The way I
see it, to get a skill of 18, you either have to have obscene stats of
14-16 (costing a huge pile of points), or you have to spend in excess of
20 points on each skill.

  BTW I agree that 12 is a basic competency level. I just don\'t think most
people would have all that many skills higher than this, and even the
highest ones probably wouldn\'t exceed 15 ,unless the person was almost
legendary in his field. (I have hard time picturing a far-trader crewed
by nothing but legends.) I\'m not saying a skill of 18 couldn\'t appear in a
game. What I an trying to say is, that people with these should be one in
a million (at least), not every second PC. 

  Another point is, that a person with engineer/jump drive-18 (for
example) would probably have committed most of his life to training in
that single field. With IQ 12 (a bright person) you would need 16 points
for this. With 400 hrs of practical work required for 1 skill pt, this
comes up to 6400 hrs, over 3 years of solid work in nothing but one single
skill.(doing _nothing_ else)  The actual time to reach this level would
probably be many times more. A person like this would probably be drawing
a huge paycheck from a megacorp, not working on a leaky far-trader getting
shot at by pirates.

>Do tell...

Y\'all conviced me.

While writing ACQ, I was doing the intro for the thrown weapons portion,
and was giving a few examples of what a thrown weapon would be.  I had
knives, grenades, and...  blank.  I knew I wanted three items, but couldn\'t
think of one.  So I typed "penguins" just to fill space.

James and I contiinue sending larger and larger files across the ether,
correcting and commenting on each others\' work, when one day I find this
under the rules on aerodynamic thrown weapons:

"Aerodynamic objects are those specifically designed for throwing, like
javelins, Frisbees, and throwing knives (penguins although very
aerodynamic tend to "resist" being thrown by flapping their little
flippers wildly about, and are therefore treated as non-aerodynamic objects
for throwing purposes)." 

Needless to say the image put me on the floor in a scale 9.2 ROFLMAO event.

Now, nearing the end of the writing, we\'re doing the weapons table, and I
set out go to the depths of gearheadiness.  I was going to design a penguin
using 3G3.  And convert it to T4.  Twice.  I even considered autofire rules
for throwing handfuls of Fairy Penguins (little guys about the size of
humming birds.)

[Now if this doesn\'t sell some extra copies of ACQ...]

Shipyard:

1) I was converting using the formula from GURPS Traveller, which is long
tons not short tons (which are used everywhere else in the book).  Loren,
the conversion notes should probably explain this for other non-American
types.

I\'m now using the correct conversion factor (thanks Christopher).

2) The exported files (as opposed to those printed out from within the
program) didn\'t convert all the numbers. 

All values are now converted.


I\'d rather not repost all those designs to the TML. They are valid
designs, just use short tons for the spreadsheet section and reconvert the
emass/lmass totals. I\'m working on an integrated PDF book of GT starships:
I\'ll post that to Freelance Traveller when I\'m done (assuming that Jeff
has room).

Doing It My Way
Extending The UWP
Government

The existing UWP code for government provides a very generalized
overview of the structure of the government of a world, and
shoehorns a government into one of a limited number of types.
Unfortunately, there are limitations to this; often an actual
government configuration can fit into more than one
classification, and many classifications cover a wide variation
in the actual structure of the government.

While the debate over the proper scope and function of a
government will probably not end prior to the actual heat-death
of the universe, it is generally agreed that there are three
functional divisions to government - the Legislative function, or
the making of law, the Executive function, or the keeping of law,
and the Judicial function, or the interpretation of law.  In
addition, there is the "State" function, which, rather than being
connected with law, is more focussed on ceremony and diplomacy.
Each of these functions has its own characteristics, and the
government overall has characteristics of its own.  This article
will develop a more detailed method of profiling a government.

It is proposed that the existing UWP Government code expresses
the most notable feature of the government in question, and may
not present a true picture of the government\'s functions.  Thus,
although the governmental systems of the United States and the
United Kingdom of pre-starflight Terra are functionally very
similar, the government codes would be different - the most
notable aspect of the United States government is that frequent
elections for virtually all positions, including legislative
representatives, are held, making the government a Representative
Democracy, while, in spite of the fact that the UK operates much
the same way, the most notable feature is the existence of a
hereditary head-of-state who theoretically can exercise power at
whim, and enjoys the support of the people of the country, making
the government a Charismatic dictatorship.  A more accurate
profile would reveal that both governments are in practice very
similar.

It should be noted that this profile applies only to the highest
levels of government - it is entirely possible that lower levels
of government have subtly or radically different structure (for
example, a functional autocracy at the top level may still permit
local governments to make local decisions on a consensus or
democratic basis).

An extended Government profile will appear as follows:

00-0-L/E/J/S

The code naturally divides into six groups.  The first group,
consisting of two digits followed by a hyphen, represents the
overall evaluation of the government.  The first digit represents
the apparent structure; the second represents the level of
intrusiveness. Conventionally, these are identical to the
Government and Law codes of the UWP, respectively.  

The second "group" is a single digit followed by a hyphen, and
indicates how the theoretical limits of governmental power are
established.  The valid codes are:

        0 - None.  The government may not be limited in theory by

            anything other than the personal ethics of the
            leaders.
        1 - Statutory Constitution and Stare Decisis.  The
            government is limited by extant statute law and by
            precedent for similar situations.
        2 - Impeding Constitution.  There is a written
            Constitution separate from the body of law and
            precedent.  This Constitution enumerates the specific
            powers that may be exercised by the government, but
            implicitly or explicitly bars the exercise of power
            beyond those limits.
        3 - Enabling Constitution.  There is a written
            Constitution separate from the body of law and
            precedent.  This Constitution enumerates specific
            prohibitions on exercising of power by the
            government, but implicitly or explicitly permits the
            exercise of any power not expressly prohibited.
        4 - Restrictive Constitution.  There is a written
            Constitution separate from the body of law and
            precedent.  This Constitution enumerates both allowed
            powers and prohibitions, and leaves the decision on
            the legality of the exercising of other powers to
            other means.

The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth groups consist of a letter
followed by up to four digits, and represent the characteristics
of the individual branches of the government.  The first
character of the group is a letter, L for legislative function, E
for executive function, J for judicial function, and S for State
function.  They may occur in any order; it is conventional to
list them in the order of dominance in government visibility.  If
multiple functions are considered together, such as head-of-state
and head-of-government in the United States, the codes should
only be included once, but with both letters (thus, ES... for the
example of the U.S.).

The digits of the division profiles represent the following:

        - The structure of the division:
          0 - direct participation by the populace at large.
          1 - single individual exercising power at discretion
          2 - single individual exercising power with
              advice/consent of a formal council
          3 - single individual exercising power within
              strictures imposed by other branches or populace at
              large
          4 - single elite council (selected from a restricted
              population)
          5 - single demotic council (selected from the populace
              at large)
          6 - multiple councils

        - The method of selection of the division
          0 - not applicable (for direct participation structure)
          1 - hereditary succession, including appointment by
              predecessor
          2 - appointed by executive branch
          3 - appointed by legislative branch
          4 - appointed by judiciary branch
          5 - appointed by head-of-state
          6 - elected from the populace at large by the populace
              at large
          7 - elected from the populace at large by restricted
              franchise
          8 - elected from a restricted group by the populace at
              large
          9 - elected from a restricted group by restricted
              franchise

          In the case of multiple councils selected by different 
          methods, the method for selection of the largest
          council (most members) should be used, and there should
          be associated notes explaining in more detail.

          In cases of elective selection with restricted
          franchise, or of elite councils, a third (and possibly
          fourth) digit should be included, to indicate the
          nature of the constraints on eligibility.  It may be
          assumed that election by "populace at large" is in fact
          restricted to citizens at or above the age of majority;
          "restricted franchise" indicates the imposition of
          additional restrictions.  If two restriction digits are
          needed, the first is for the restricted group from
          which the membership is selected; the second for the
          restricted group that does the selecting.

          Restriction codes are:
          1 - Age.  Franchise is delayed after majority, revoked
              after a specified age, or both.
          2 - Financial.  Franchise is restricted to those who
              can demonstrate a certain level of wealth and/or
              property ownership.
          3 - Hereditary.  Franchise is limited to those who can
              prove descent along specified lines from a
              historically-enfranchised individual.
          4 - Gender.  In polysexual (2 or more sexes) species, 
              franchise is limited to specific sexes, but not to
              all.
          5 - Intelligence/Education.  Franchise is limited to
              those who can demonstrate a specified level of
              intellectual competence.
          6 - Race/Ethnicity/Religion/Cultural - Franchise is
              limited to members of approved groups based on
              inheritable physical characteristics or social
              identification.  In some forms of social
              identification, the identification may be partially
              or fully involuntary.
          7 - Occupation.  Franchise is limited to members of
              approved trades, professions, or occupations.

Examples:

(1) The United States of America has a moderately intrusive
government (moderate law level) whose most notable characteristic
is an elective legislature (Representative Democracy).  There is
a written Constitution that both prohibits and allows
governmental powers, and leaves the decision in areas not
explicitly mentioned or unclear areas to a decision by other
methods.  In general, focus on the government for the purposes of
news reportage focusses on the head of government, who is the
head of the executive branch, and elected by the populace at
large, theoretically from the populace at large.  The head of
government is also head of state, and there is little
differentiation between the functions.  When the Executive is not
the focus of government-focussed news, the Legislature generally
is.  The legislature is several councils, theoretically selected
from the populace at large by the populace at large.  The
Judicial branch is a single elite council (selected from scholars
of law), appointed by the Executive (though with approval from
the legislature).

The government profile for the United States of America would be

44-4-ES26/L66/J427

(2) The fictitious Caliphate of Al-rak has a highly intrusive
government (high law level) whose most notable characteristic is
a hereditary monarch as head of state (Charismatic Dictatorship).
There is no Constitution; the monarch has theoretically absolute
power.  The legislative parliament is a single council that
selects the head of government, and is elected by and from the
male citizens only.  The head of government is limited in his
ability to exercise power by the advice of the parliament.  The
judiciary is composed of members of the priesthood appointed to
the supreme judicial council by the monarch.

The government profile for the Caliphate of Al-rak would be

A8-0-S11/E237/L4944/J457.
