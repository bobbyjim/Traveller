Really simple to figure: K\'Kree max TL is 14 (module 2), Imperial is TL 15
(with a few worlds being either isolationist tl 16-17, or emergent tl 16 in
a few fields). Under Bk 5: High Gurad, and all later Traveller design
structures, the following limits are in force:

TL      Max J-n
15+     6
14      5
13      4
12      3
11      2
9-10    1

Thus K\'Kree max TL 14 indicates a J-5 max, while Imperial max TL 15
indicates a J-6 max. Figuring 35 jumps per year maximum operational speed,
that\'s a full sector of difference! Realize also that the K\'Kree structure
of government has fewer levels, and less interstellar autonomy, so
decisions need to be made closer to home in terms of turn around time, so
the k\'kree would operate closer to home.

William,
Thanks for the clue. I never noticed this about tech levels before and it
does make a huge difference. I guess I didn\'t find any text where this
inference was made. Makes sense for the K\'kree to lag behind the Imperials.

What is harder to explain is how the Imperium has lagged at TL15 for so long,
after earlier climbs. I guess a basic Traveller premise is that technological
change is not steady-and-upward, but that it can level off.

I don\'t really have trouble believing in a universe that is stagnating. It\'s
just that it seems like the Imperium is a culture that would be continuing to
progress technologically, and I don\'t see why it has hovered so long at and
near 15.

The Traveller background provides a number of historical events -- such as
the Long Night -- to stop tech progress or send it backward. What gets me is
how LONG things take.

However, our current rapid change could be seen as a historical
anomoly...after all, things did stay much the same for many thousands of years
of human history.

I think you send a message with the line:

in it to xboat-request@MPGN.COM. A program will read it and remove you
from the list. Be sure to send the message from the account that\'s

I hope that works; my memory is often muddled when it comes to

Just read the queries about the backward nature of Traveller technology, and
I thought I\'d add my 2c worth --

The clues are all there in the pre-Virus material - and it boils down to this,
the Terrans (and the Darrians, which were Terran influenced *without* Vilani
contact) were able to make massive advances in the Interstellar Wars that led
to the collapse of the Nasu Sirka, and trashed the Vilani, who were not. The
difference was that Terran *society* was one where individualism and the idea
of progress were *not* the dirty words that they were in the Vilani Empire.
The Terrans would, quite probably, have completely transformed Vilani society
in the aftermath of the collapse, except for the treason of the Fleet, led
by Admiral Estigaribbia ... as they planned to subsume the Vilani Empire into
the Terran mainstream. While this would have been unpleasant in the short term
for the Vilani, it would have been much better in the long term - as the
increased technology that would have resulted from untrammlled Terran techno
research would have been much more than they could have expected themselves.

Unfortunately, Estigarribbia and the Fleet were obviously a minority (despite
their justifications that they "understood the plight of the conquered" -
obvious propaganda of no value) amongst the whole set-up, and *required* the
support of the Vilani bureaucrats to set themselves up. The "price" for such a
deal - up front *and* as part of the ongoing Vilani influence (domination would
not be too fine a point to put on it!) in the bureacracy - adoption of a whole
variety of Vilani social attitudes ... including the strictures against "too
quick" technological research.

It is likely, though difficult to tell for certain, that the Traitors had to
use Vilani bureaucrats and security personnel to help their occupation of the
Terran Federation, as they were (as already noted) in a tiny minority. Terran
society was thus placed under the control of the ultra-conservative Vilani, and
their iron hand crushed Terran inventiveness and progressive ideas. Sure, the
society was not completely vilanified, but it *was* modified enough that it
lost the "edge" that it had had.

There\'s a lot more, of course, and I have (modestly) put together a complete
alternative history for the Imperium and Terra from before the Interstellar
wars through to 1120 - one which completely deletes Virus and provides an
explanation for the whole backward mess that the Imperium is (and will, likely,
*always* be until somebody reforms its society - by crushing it).

A small number of extra copies are available at a modest cost, as are a number
of other supplements that provide advanced tech for Starship Design (based on
High Guard), Personal Equipment, Planetary Vehicles and, as I get around to it,
Starships and Military Weapons. If you\'re interested, drop me a line and I\'ll
answer questions and provide further details ... but, one up front, none of the
stuff is FF&S compatible, as the so-called "advanced" technology provided
there, though it certainly fits in with the backward Imperium, has no claim to
be "advanced" at all!

I\'m looking for something that will generate new systems, not

program to, hopefully, allow some sort of configuration of

you to lower/raise average tech levels.  I\'ve found some that
create systems in a graphical, but non-UWP format.  What I want
are text listings like from the old Scout book that I can print
out, edit, email to players, etc.  Graphics would be a bonus, but
would be frosting on the cake. <g>

It will have to run under OS/2.  Of course, that means it can be
a DOS or Windows 3.x program as well. <g>

Frankly, I think the designers of Traveller couldn\'t (or more likely didn\'t
want) imagine too much super technology. Nobody probably expected the
importance and power of computers in the seventies. Even at TL15, most
societies in Traveller aren\'t very different to our todays Western society.

Technological advances are very important for our culture, but there\'s no
reason why all societies should give new inventions such a high priority.
Some say that technology stagnation is indeed stepping backward but is this
really true?

What\'s about this explanation: TLs higher than 10 are tied to progress in
jump technology only. I understand TLs as artificial classifications of some
Imperial bureau of Technology and perhaps they didn\'t thought inventions or
discoveries worth an overall TL16 classification yet.

I think, it\'s a flaw of Traveller, that low and high TL-world coexists and
no one tries to raise all world to the same high TL but perhaps Imperial
authorities realised that diversification is the real strength.

..as shown on earth in the Dark Ages in europe. Greek knowledge was
declared wrong by believe. (Because it cannot happen what shall not
happen...) However, other nations like the Arabian world, raises to new
highs in mathematics, medicine and astronomy in the same era.

 Just to confirm, you\'re asking for a simple UWP, TNE-style?  Not
 the extended system profile that the DGP World Builder\'s Handbook
 set out?

 If that\'s what you\'re interested, contact me.  I have some old
 stuff lying around that I might even be able to find, written in
 Turbo Pascal, which, if I can find it, I can translate into BASIC
 or REXX for you (and for the rest of the list, if there\'s
 interest).

 Also, I note that TNE has two or three sets of rules, to cover
 worlds in the Reformation Coalition or similar polity, to cover
 Wilds, and to cover Regency.  There\'s a lot of overlap, though.
 Which rules are you looking to start with?  My recommendation
 would be based on what part of your Long Night your campaign is
 going to take place in - at the beginning, right after the
 Disintegration, use the Regency rules; in the middle, the darkest
 part of the night, use Wilds; and at the end, when Dawns, both
 real and false, are occurring, generate RC-type worlds.  There are
 other modifications you can use, such as the Hard Times rules, but
 you\'ll still need the program to generate the basic UWP.

X::>It will have to run under OS/2.  Of course, that means it can be

 BASIC or REXX are, as I recall, supplied with OS/2.  Turbo Pascal
 (at least the version I used for those programs) generated DOS
 (16-bit) .COM files.
