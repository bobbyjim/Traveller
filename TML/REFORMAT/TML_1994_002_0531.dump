 But your own paragraph on tactics indicates part of their role:
Overloading point-defenses and scrubbing surface features.  The standard
missile in TNE is capable of a lot of mayhem, and will scrub surface
bits off of _any_ ship.  The more ships (of any size) you\'ve got firing
these things at the enemy, the less capable the enemy will be to
respond.
 The levels of armor described in Steven M Bonneville\'s
(bonnevil@mermaid.micro.umn.edu) post almost, BUT NOT QUITE, return
us to the days of MT, when anything without a meson gun was harmless
above a certain level.  In TNE, with all of a ship\'s surface features,
it is quite possible to get a mission kill without penetrating the
armor.  Nothing is completely invulnerable.

 Perhaps an irregular dirt clod or a symbolic plant growing from the
ground for Soil.  The few Coyn faces we\'ve seen suggest an extremely
symbolic style, IMHO.  The more this can be followed, the more mystified
your players will be.

 >Beast	    A ferocious six-limbed carnivore in mid-jump[6].

 Or perhaps just a paw-print.  Save the ferocious carnivore for the
most dangerous (in your opinion) of the major races that replaced
the animals.

 >Achievement  A brimful cup.
 >Defeat       An empty, tipped-over cup.

 Or a mountain pinnacle with a tiny figure, and a chasm into which a
figure is falling.  The various ways of showing these two are boggling.

 >dissappeared.

 Since the major races eventually replaced these, they may also represent
specific forms of danger, or specific concerns that the Droyne must
watch for.  Grandfather replaced the original Coyns with new ones that
had different pictures but meant much the same things.  Perhaps the
Droyne once had to worry about the overbearing habits of a particular
omnivore.  This animal had a ever-expanding territorial sense, and was
forever competing with others of its kind to expand that individual
territory.  The Coyn depicting this beast was replaced by the Humaniti
Coyn (or perhaps the Aslan Coyn) as Grandfather\'s warning.
 Looked at in this way, the Major Race Coyns might also represent
personalities: the Militant (K\'Kree), the Meddler (Hivers), the
Curious (Humaniti), the Random (Vargr), and the Migrator (Aslan).
These may still have been represented by animals from Eskayloyt who
embodied these (or other) personality arch-types.

comments:

Small arm Tl16 focal arrays are effectively free & miniscule. The above
4mm FA is sufficient to give no attenuation out to extreme range for a
pistol (including optic sights) in standard atmosphere. It has a nominal
volume of 0.008 cc and a cost of Cr0.004

Of the options, the laser sight is nice but nearly doubles the empty
weight, the optic sight doesn\'t give enough extra performance to be
expecially worth it, and any of the options add enough to the cost to
take the weapon out of the cheap "Saturday Night Special" market for
which it\'s intended.

I would say quite conservative.  At TL 14 you can construct a 9.5m bay laser
(there is no point in building much larger) feeding 6000 Mj (only 4* a standard
barbette laser) which will throw a penetration over 2000 out to 80 hex
range.  That will not a lot of Damage after pen (about 15 points), but it
is not zero.

Note also there are some trade-offs we can do to get a small ship with a 
laser that has 2000+ pen at very close ranges.

True for the smallest weapons, but is it such a bad idea? Also, you are

I think what we may have here is a classic race between armour and armament.
I am not sure how to develop any sort of "optimal" solution for a given
tech level, I guess its the sort of thing that would have to "come out in the
wash" in a given campaign.

While you would depend on the "big gun" spinal mounts to deliver ship-killing
critical hits, I think correct use of Light units (properly designed
for doing damage against armoured targets) would be an important tactical 
consideration.

I wonder how much artistic unity they have -- and why some Droyne are
crazy enough to make some sets out of uranium!  Good luck, Hans!

The concept for an Ancient-era coyn for Eskayloyt is interesting, but
it should probably be expressed as "Homeworld", since presumably at
that point it had not yet been lost.  Also, the Ancient period lasted 
long enough that it\'s possible that the "Human" and "Vargr" coyns were 
added before the Final War; humans, at least, were fairly well 
integrated into quite a number of Ancient societies -- about half, if 
the figures for the 3rd Imperium discovering evidence for some 90+ human 
minor races and charting some 200+ Ancient sites are accurate.  The old 
symbolic implications of those coyns were probably fairly interesting....

I\'m not quite sure about the "native beast" replacements, but I don\'t have
a better suggestion.  "Innocent bystander" races from the Ancient period
that got wiped out by collateral fire in the Final War?  No, that\'s not
it either.

Note that all six species represented on the coyns are important powers.
Yaskoydray didn\'t accidentally pick a "minor" race that didn\'t make it.
And of those six, five developed hyperdrive independently.  It makes one
wonder if he didn\'t use something like the Zhodani core artifact to peer
into the future.  Or tamper with _TRS Pathfinder_ so that the Aslan got 
jump drive just before they could blow themselves into oblivion.  Either
way, it suggests that all this "Six Races" nonsense is literally a self-
fulfilling prophecy.

>Voyages         A sailing ship.

Or a STL starship -- the pre-Ancient Droyne did have tech-10 without jump
drive for thousands of years before the Ancient period; they even had a
couple of interstellar colonies.  


Also, note some interesting coyn relationships from the table:

Genesis | Aspiration | Sacrifice | Defeat | Death | Achievement
  The life cycle.  Observe the droyne lesson; one is born, dreams,
  makes sacrifices (for the common good?), meets eventual defeat,
  then death, but *then* attains true achievement.  Defeat and death
  are not the victor.  Is this droyne philosophy peeking out?  Or
  even a droyne concept of the after-life?  Interesting.

Darkness | Cold | Noise | Signal | Heat | Light
  A progressively more positive line of "energy" or "positive entropy".
  Note how the pairs work.  The "Void--Fire" series also may work like
  this.

Beast | Mercenary | Voyages | Justice | Chance | Phoenix
  Think of this like the "energy" sextet.  It would then pair from
  closest to most extreme as:  Voyages/Justice, Merc/Chance, Beast/Phoenix.

Well, as I mentioned there might be a possibility of using them in very
large numbers as nuclear missile launchers, and try for a direct hit on
the battleship.  Somehow, I doubt even factor 2000 armor would take well
to having a nuke go off next to it.  Of course, the target solution is
fairly simple once the missiles get that close, so you\'d have to fire 
a *lot* of them and concentrate your fire on one enemy target.

Of course, there\'s a counter-tactic.  For MCr12.5, you can overwhelm a
single standard 150MJ laser turret using standard power, with ten missiles.
It has an ROF of 10 in a thirty minute round, maximum.  (This assumes,
unlike normal space combat, that all shots are effective and destroy one
incoming missile in the zero hex.)  But using FF&S, it is possible to 
build a rapid-fire laser with an ROF of 800 (two shots every five seconds)
which would probably nicely solve the problem.  I don\'t know what the
power requirements of such an anti-missile laser would be.  Arming the
little fleet escorts with "pea-shooter" meson weapons would probably be 
a better bet if you\'re trying for serious internal damage.

    Perhaps if I say that the technical managers are also vassals of 
    the noble they serve this helps? I didn\'t think I would have to 
    explicitly point that out, as I thought it was implied already. 
    
    However, with this proviso (ie technical experts being vassals), 
    you have the inter-relatedness. I think we have a reasonable 
    description of what -a- Feudal Technocracy could look like. Thats 
    -a- Feudal Technocracy, not -all- Feudal Technocracies. I was not, 
    by the way, proposing that the system I posted was the ONE TRUE 
    DEFINITION OF FEUDAL TECHNOCRACY. Just that it describes -a- 
    system that fits the term. After all, given Traveller\'s method for 
    classifying governments, the same government could be classified 
    different ways depending on which aspects of it are seen to be 
    most apparent by the typical traveller. 
    
    <It seems to me that what\'s happening (and not particularly with 
    <you, Cynthia, nor Hans) is that many folks are confusing

    Possibly. In my case I used aristocratic titles (Baron, Knight 
    etc) as terms to identify with Feudal systems from our own earthly 
    history that I am most familiar with, and which other people on 
    the TML might be more familiar with. Obviously I could have been 
    clearer by describing the importance of the mutual obligations 
    between vassals and his/her liege lord.
    
    <Feudalism is based upon mutual obligations between the lord and 
    <his vassals.  An aristocracy has no such requirement.  In 
    <medieval feudal aristocracies these obligations were centered

    I Agree so far.
    
    <In a feudal technocracy the technocracy `buzz-word\' shifts the 
    <focus from military affairs to industrial activities
    
    I agree it can do. I don\'t agree it automatically does. The \'buzz 
    word\' as it has been termed describes an approach to managing 
    industrial resources (see the definition I posted earlier). In 
    Traveller, technology and the industrial capacity for producing 
    high technology weapons is crucial to the ability to wage war. So 
    I think you can still have a high tech militarily centred Feudal 
    system which is technocratic in nature. From what I\'ve seen and 
    heard the Battletech universe is a lot like this. Maybe areas 
    engaged in large scale TCS campaigns are like this too 8-).

    To me your kieretsu description seems like it -also- fits the 
    description of a Corporate Government. You see it as a good 
    example of a Feudal Technocracy. Given Traveller\'s way of 
    classifying governments, there is no reason why it can\'t be both. 
    The classification you choose obviously would show what aspects of 
    the government are most apparent to, or which have most effect on, 
    Travellers. Which ties in with Mark Miller\'s article on government 
    types way back in JTAS or wherever ( I think it was JTAS ).
    
    By the way, William White recently posted an interesting article 
    on what Feudal means to the XTML that is worth checking out too. I 
    thought it had some nice ideas for variations on the traditional 
    Feudal model.
    
    And since we have gotten on to discussing government types, does 
    anyone else have an example of how they have interpreted a 
    Traveller government type they\'d like to post? I\'d certainly be 
    interested. After all, it gets a bit boring if all your Feudal 
    Technocracies and Corporate Governments start to look the same.

Keep this is mind.  This `inter-relatedness\' between the participants in
feudalism is the key point that distinguishes it from other government
types.

I question this defintion below.

There is nothing specific about socioeconomic status with respect to
feudalism.  It is rather the differences in the responsibilities of
the various parties that determines their relative *political* power.
A vassal may very well have greater *wealth* than her liege but the
nature of the feudal relationship ties her to her liege nonetheless.

Again, there is nothing about `elites\' or `priviledge\' inherent in feudalism
*or* technocracy.  Elite trappings from medieval times are related to the
aristocractic relationships based upon heredity between the ruling class
(nobles) and the ruled (commoners).  This was not a feudal relationship
but rather an oligarchic one.

In medieval feudalism the ruling class controlled *all* forms of technology
as well as the economic basis for that technology.  Furthermore, the modern
meaning of the term technocracy does not pertain to a single type of
technology but instead refers to a source of authority based upon technical
ability in general (as opposed to some other source such as property
ownership, heredity, divine access, popular consent, etc.).  In contemporary
society, technical ability is also closely tied to industrial capability and
the economic base.  This suggests that a feudal technocracy based upon a
single form of technology will be the exception rather than the rule.  Most
feudal technocracies will therefore be based upon an `inter-related\'
relationship between those with industrial capabilities.

Actually, it is the fact that the feudal technocracy is based upon
a full range of technological endeavor that permits different segments
of the ruling class to work at cross purposes.  Look at how the hegemony
of the AMA has been rattled now that insurance providers and employers have
entered the health care debate.

These are all interesting suggestions but some might be better classified
as types other than feudal technocracies.

This is the oligarchic or aristocractic aspect of medieval society.  It
was called serfdom.  The feudal relationship existed *between* the members
of the ruling class (lords and vassals), not between the ruling class and
the commoners.

> 2.  Corporate Feudalism:  A complex arrangement consisting of

This is more akin to an aristocratic model.  In most corporate systems
the employees will serve at the whim of management.  Even heavily unionized
systems that limit management\'s ability to replace workers still do not
create any obligation upon management toward the workers other than that
of continued employment.  If management chooses to run the
company into the ground, the workers are powerless and unable to stop
them or correct the move - at least not through any agreed upon and 
previously defined relationship.

Here is the system of `inter-relatedness\' that characterizes the Japanese
*kieritsu* and begins to describe the true nature of a feudal technocracy.

This is essentially redundant but it describes the mechanics of the
feudal relationship quite well.

Again, self-sufficiency makes a feudal relationship problematic.  Without
the need for `inter-relatedness\' there can be no feudal relationship.

This is another aristocractic form.  Basing authority upon heredity
removes the need for an agreed upon relationship between parties based
upon their `inter-relatedness\'.  Under a caste system there is no
obligation placed upon the upper castes toward the lower castes.

If medical practitioners can deny their services at will then this
is an aristocractic relationship, not a feudal one.

> 2.  TRANSPORT - In a world where communities are isolated and not

Again, there must be some sort of `inter-relatedness\' for this relationship

Again, this may be a technocracy but it is not feudal.  Am I beginning
to sound like a broken record?  (Please stop, Dave.  Dave?  What are

This has been some excellent work and is quite a contribution to anyone\'s
campaign.  It may even fit many folk\'s view of government code 5 but I
think we could be more careful in our defintions of any type of government
if instead of focusing upon the particular manifestations of a certain
government type, in this case various forms of technology, we instead 
focus upon the nature of authority (who has it) and the source of that
authority (how it is legitimized).

     Want to stepup to the world of multi-media? Then this is for you!!!
Dear Correspondants:

	As with last week\'s Junque Mail, I\'m here again pushing
some obsolete multi-media hardware/software. OOPS! I don\'t mean
the Hardware or Software is obsolete, only that I am dis-investing 
in multi-media [the big buzz-word in computers today]. I have
decided that since I use the CD/ROM drive in my system less than 
once a month, it is a luxery I can no longer afford. OH! One more
thing, this unit is an IBM PC compatible unit. It WILL work with
Apple MacIntosh also, but you\'de have to buy drivers etc for it,
as the ones I have that I\'m throwing in are for the IBM.
	So, here we go again. 
	FOR SALE ---- ONE CD/ROM DRIVE with Accessories.
The drive itself is an external model, so if you have a small 
computer with zero internal drive bays left, it won\'t matter. The
DM-5024 is manufactured by the Texel Corporation, a Japaneese firm
with local offices in Santa Clara, California. It comes in a 
9.5 x 10 x 2.125 inch white plastic enclosure with its own internal
power supply, and an internal audio amplifier for CDs with sound
clips on them.
	The Interface card and the software are manufactured by 
Trantor Systems, Inc of Freemont, Ca. Both the Drive unit and the 
SCSI interface card have very extensive documentation. The software
documentation is contained on the disks themselves in the form
of read.me and help files. 
	The accessories pack for this excellent value includes:
the CD caddy [of course!] a pair of stereo headphones for the
drive\'s audio amplifier, all the connecting cables and hardware
necessary to install this unit in an IBM PC {I don\'t know about
the MacIntosh ... but both the drive and SCSI interface ARE com-
patible with Apple.} and TEN CDs complete with any auxilliary
software necessary to run them, jewel cases for each CD, and of 
course the documentation on these CDs.
	The CDs are: 1] PUBLISH IT! (version 2.0) by Timeworks 
software. This CD includes a built in graphics tool box, 69 fonts,
a thosand clip art images, 85 ready to use sample layouts and a
complete word processor. [plus THICK users manual. The others
all have documentation, but Publish It is the best.
	2] The Aircraft Encyclopedia by Quantum Press
	3] CD Game Pack II by Software Toolworks
	4] GUIDE Star Charts (Version 3.0) Probably the best
Star Chart/Planetarium program available in the USA today. See
Review in a recent (June or July, 93) issue of Sky and Telescope.
	5] US History on CD/Rom by Bureau Development Corp.
	6] US Atlas and AUTO MAP by Software Toolworks
	7] Software Toolworks Multimedia Encyclopedia - is what
I was using the most often.
	8] The Best of Media Clips, by ARIS entertainment. This 
disk has photographs, .wav and .midi sounds and other neat multi-
media things.
	9] Selected Astronomical Catalogs from NASA, the guys who
brought you the Challenger Disaster. This disk is a pretty good
one however, full of diffrent star catalogs, including the Yale 
Bright Star Catalog and the Gliese catalogue.
	10] North American Indians, by Quanta Press.
All these CDs are contained in a hansome, utilitarian plastic 
"media Mate" which will keep them handy, safe and out of the way
when you\'re not using them.

	The price of this complete package is $550.00 {US$ only}.  As for shipping,
I\'ll pick up the first $20.00 - which will be enough to send this via 3rd
class slow-boat to china mail in the US.  After that, YOU pay the shipping.
The package, which is all packed, just waiting for a lable weighes 18 pounds
[better round off to 20 to account for vagerencies in bathroom scales.] Now
you can shop around and decide for yourself how fast and how much ...

     Anyone interested in this should contact me, electronically via E.Mail,
before the 4th of July. The price of $550.00 for the entire package is
guarenteed until then.

     While both Loren Wiseman and Frank Chadwick are listed as

     I\'m not sure if it\'s a good idea to post back through the

via personal email. If I get enough response, I\'ll post a summary
or two back to the mailing lists. Let me know when you\'re arriving

   Thruster plates only provide thrust.  Going by DGP\'s explanation in SoM,
thruster plates can change the direction of thrust, but the amount of
thrust decreases as it moves away from its main axis, so you get only 10%
thrust in reverse.  A short, squat ship with it\'s thruster on the bottom (a
tradition flying saucer or cone shape for example) would be the best
configuration for a ship - uncomplicated VTOL ability, and the decks are at
right angles to the normal axis of thrust and the ground; if you lose your
inertial compensators or are sitting on the ground, the g-forces are coming
from the accustomed direction.

   You can, of course, define how it works for your own purposes.  You
could have thruster plates act on a volume like the contra-grav lifters.
This way you don\'t have to worry about the placement of the drive or the
axis of thrust.  , Another consequence is there won\'t be any feeling of
acceleration due to the drive - the drive is acting to accelerate on
everything in the volume.

   The scale efficiences modifier was eliminated.  But, the need for power
has diminished as well.  The MT Subsidized Merchant had a 1476 MW
poerplant; the TNE version has a 282 MW plant.  In MT, your basic ship
laser required 250 MW;  adding 4 lasers to the merchant requires 68% of its
installed power.  Only 6% is required for the TNE version (4 lasers at 4.2
MW each).  This makes it easier for characters to arm their ships.

   Engineering crew seems to be making up for the shrinkage in power
plants. :)  One recent design, a 20kt battle rider, required 840 engineers
(this with TL-16 computers) - plus the 140 cmd crew.  Using the power
plant\'s volume instead of output gives somewhat more acceptable numbers.
Meson guns are almost as bad as power plants: a TL15, 25600 Mj MG (see
below) requires a crew of 128.

I\'ve designed a cruiser-sized meson gun, resonably sized for that class of
ship, with a DV of 1000 (yes, one thousand).  A Tigress could sport something
even larger, possibly with a DV several times that, depending on how
specialized
you want to design the ship.

I have, and bay weapons tend to be pretty useless except as hull-scrapers.

If a PA is operating at the maximum Mj for it\'s length, its penetration value
works out
to 5 times it\'s length in meters within it\'s effective range.

I don\'t have the exact numbers here, but for a 50-ton bay that works out to
a PV of 60, and for a 100-ton bay a PV of about 80.  Considering that cruisers
and battleships will have armor ratings in the THOUSANDS, they\'re only
good for blinding the enemy (a tactic which will be very popular in battles
under
BL rules, I should think.)

Bay mesons have such pitiful range they\'re not worth building in most cases.

Lasers should be limited to about 50 Mj/tech-level, which is an arbitrary
limit,
but is needed for game balance.  Joule for joule, lasers are more versatile
than
PA\'s or MG\'s and have a superior ability to deliver damage to the target.
Allow them to compete directly, and there rapidly becomes no point to building
PA\'s and MG\'s.  Putting a limit on them keeps them at the low end of the
weapons
spectrum, where they have traditionally been in Traveller.

It depends on exactly what is being claimed. You asked for an explanation of
how come Gram dominated Saxnoth when Saxnoth was more powerful than Gram. I 
suggested that maybe Gram had been a higher tech level recently (and/or
Sacnoth lower) due to an econo-technological cycle effect. You _claimed_

I could come up with just one example, I would prove my point outright. But 
just because I can\'t dosen\'t mean it isn\'t possible. Now, if I were to claim 
that the lack of evidence to the contrary _proved_ anything, then I would be 
making a UFO-nutter type claim. But I\'m only saying that the lack dosen\'t 
disprove anything.

What factual record? We have _one_, count them, one, complete listing of
world UWPs for the Spinward Marches, the one first published in _Spinward
Marches Campaign_ and since reprinted (with the UWPs _unchanged_) in
_Imperial Encyclopedia_ and _Megatraveller Journal_ #3 (Before you decide
to dispute that, check the data. Despite the changes in alliegiance noted
in IE and MJ3 there are no changes in world population level or multiplier
(this based on a spot check of 40+ of the planets, including all the Vargr-
occupied ones in Aramis Subsector)). How can you establish any sort of
projection on that? So it _could_ be that the TLs have grown slowly and
steadily. Or they could have been rollercoasting up and down over the
centuries. We just can\'t tell from the record.

The _discovery_ tech level of the Imperium have been one TL per three or
four centuries, hasen\'t it (I forget exactly; the discovery times of
Jump-4, -5, and -6 was mentioned somewhere once. I think it worked out 
at one per three centuries)? But we\'re talking about _developement_ TLs.
I say again: A moderately important colony like Regina that advances it\'s
economy by 5% (or even 20% if you go by _Striker_ rules) in eight centuries
by slow, steady increments that never declines, is difficult to believe. I
can believe in economic up- and downturns that averaged out into 5% over the 
centuries much more readily.

Hmmm. Perhaps I can restate my argument in a clearer way than I have done
before:

Assumtion: The only reason why an Imperial planet in 1105 is not TL 15 is
that it can\'t afford to be (I\'m ignoring those few planets where there 
are legal, moral, or philosophical objections to advanced technology).
(This is the crucial assumption.)

A planet with TL A therefor has an economic condition we will call
Economic Level A. Should the planet advance from EL A, its technological
level will advance too (To, say, TL B). If the planet at any future date
becomes poorer, its economic level would decline to EL A again. Its 
technology should decline as a consequence, since the planet obviously 
cannot afford to maintain the technology (if it could, it would have had 
TL B in under EL A in the first place). Since economies do seem to have a 
tendency to fluctuate (vide the world as we know it), it seems plausible 
that it will do so in the Spinward Marches too.

It would be nice to have a few quotes. I skimmed _Space Viking_ last night
without findng any reference to either Gorram or Lothar Ffayle being barons,
but I did notice that while Traskon is a farming and ranching barony (hence
a land barony) Sesar Karvall is, indeed, baron of Karvallsmills, not of
Karvall. And there is a reference to the \'financial and industrial barons
of Wardshaven\'. So, yes, Gram does have industrial fiefs.

Then its not analogous to a feudal society. Let\'s get a few definitions
straight:

From "Oxford Advanced Learner\'s Dictionary" (1974):

_feudal_: of the method of holding land (by giving services to the owner)
during the Middle Ages in Europe.

_fief_: land held from a feudal lord.

_vassal_: (in feudal times) person who held land in return for which he
wowed to give military service to the owner of the land.

And from "Funk&Wagnall\'s Standard Dictionary":

_feudalism_ The medieval European system of land tenure on condition of
military aid and other services.

_feudal system_: A politico-economic system [...] founded on the tenure
of feuds, or fiefs, given as compensation for military services rendered 
by chiefs and by them sublet by allotments to their subordinates and vassals.

_feud[2]_: Land held of a superior on condition of rendering service; a fief.

The feudal baron held his lands on condition that he supported his liege
lord. Many broke their oaths on occasion, but that was in defiance of the
law. (The only valid excuse was winning).

And these shareholders never represent different interest groups that wheel
and deal and compromise to get their respective representatives on the
board? The board is always composed of people who are in complete accord?
And all the shareholders are always in accord too?

Act in what way that is different from owners of different share blocks in

I didn\'t include the corporate model as an example of the equivalent of

And a vassal does what his liege lord says or he is \'fired\'.

Yes and no. He owns a lot of it from the days where his father was the
biggest lord around. He became king when he conquered the other lords
around him (in which case he came to own their land) or when the other 
independent lords decided to back him, in which case he did not own their
land... yet. But when he became strong enough, he made those formerly 
independent lords do homage for their own lands, thereby actually laying 
claim to it. Or he made war against a recalcitrant lord, acquired the land 
by conquest, and made the former owner or somebody else do homage for it. 
Check a history of medieval Europe for more detail.

>Rather the king supplies `coordinated services\' (i.e. joint military

Coordinated services may be the reason why the other lords decided to back 
him. But what they owe him fealthy for is the tenure of their fiefs.

>No, the king is the equivalent of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
>The Chairman provides `coordinated activites\', i.e. `running the company\'
>in return for the financial support of the shareholders, i.e. `cooperation\'.

Look, the shareholders in a corporation is a conglomerate owner. In theory
they make up one person, the owner of the corporation. The Chairman works
for the owner. The vassals \'works\' for the king. See the difference?

>A true feudal technocracy is much more complicated than this because it

A fief has _one_ owner. A baron can\'t sell off shares of his barony to make
the buyers part-barons of the fief (He may be able to sell bits of the fief, 
but these bits then become parts of other fiefs). And if a company is the 
equivalent of a fief then there won\'t be any shareholders, just one baron.
You\'re getting mixed up because so many of the companies we know of today 
are incorporated. In fact, I realize that I\'ve been using \'corporation\' and
company interchangably. That was wrong. Please read \'company\' whenever I\'ve
used \'corporation\' in connection with a feudal technocracy. There can be no
shareholders in a feudal fief, technocratic or not.

I suppose that a part holding in a BIG company could be a fief in itself.
But that would be owned by _one_ person, and that person would have the
title. And there\'s certainly no mention of any \'Baron of a Third of the
Megatronics Company\' in _Space Viking_ ;-)

That\'s just precisely what I claim he couldn\'t. He gives the barony in
its entirety to Duke Angus, and Angus appoints another Trask as \'Vicar-
Baron\'. And just like that Lucas is no longer a baron.

>He owned that entire block of shares of the total economic sector of Gram.

He owned a barony. I\'ll sonceede that the fact that it was a land barony
is irrelevant, and that it could just as well have been a computer firm.
But if it had been, it would have been as indivisible as any land barony
(ie. he might be able to sell off peripheral parts, but the core must
remain relatively intact).

Have we read the same book? Angus increased wealth allowed him to buy more
fighting men which allowed him to attack Omfray and other enemies and to
gain the support of some of the other big dukes. And, as someone says on 
page 124, "He\'s King as long as the great lords like Count Lionel and Joris 
of Bigglersport and Alan of Northport want him to be" (Obviously Angus 
hasn\'t reached the point where he can annex the big counties and dukedoms 
for himself, but then, he\'s only a first-generation king).

No, in a young FT it\'s the ones who has glommed onto a big slice of the
industry and dole it out to vassals. In a well-established FT it\'s the
ones whose ancestors did that and then supported an even bigger duke for
king.

Wait a minute. The Chairman keeps back part of his employees\' salaries and
place them in a pension fund, right? That gives hin  lot of pull in electing 
the board of the fund, agreed. But the money that accrues from the fund 
belongs to the employees, don\'t it? How does the Chairman see a penny of it?

We\'re most certainly not saying the same thing. If a noble holds his land 
from an overlord he cannot transfer his support without breaking his oath. 
If he\'s an independent lord that is not a king we\'re still in the early 
state of the formation of the kingdom.

But a feudal king did own the fiefs, at the very least formally.

>If Uther Pendragon had `owned\' the fief of Cornwall he could have

Oh no he couldn\'t. The feudal contract was binding on the overlord too.
He had promised to protect his vassal\'s rights. Uther couldn\'t remove
the Duke without cause. (Also, of course, the whole episode takes place
long before the feudal system evolved).

A fief is held in tenancy from the owner. Fail in your obligations and you
forfeit the fief.

You\'re talking about economic might regardless of the social system. But
a sovereign power is only vulnerable to outside economic influence if 
they are vulnerable. By this I mean that if Gram has all the raw material
they need then they can impose trade restrictions that leaves Sacnoth\'s
greater economic strength whistling at the door. The reason US Industry 
fears the japanese is that the US _is_ vulnerable. But why should Gram
be vulnerable just because the US is?

Not according to the Traveller rules.

No, the cycles has nothing to do with that argument. They just provide one
explanation (out of several) of how Gram can have homebuilt TL 12 ships if 
we decide that a military parity is necessary to explain anything.

If Anders _owns_ fiefs on Sacnoth then it\'s actually equivalent to the
England/Calais situation. So I don\'t think that\'s likely, since that
would make Sacnoth balkanized. Still, the Scouts might have misunderstood
the situation when they compiled their survey. But those vassals could 
only get out of supporting Anders by breaking their oaths and turning to
Harald for protection. Then he would be their overlord. Nohow would they
become kings themselves.

Subject to King Anders\' oaths to his vassals. The feudal oath is a two-way
one.

>*and* similar *then* to the corporate model.

No. _If_ Anders could appoint and remove governors of his holdings at will
then he would be an autocrat. If he gives the holding in fief he cannot
revoke it except for cause. That _is_ the feudal system

Now we\'re suddenly into the military situation. I thought you were talking
about economic superiority? I\'ve always postulated that Gram had access to
TL 12 ships of its own. And I postulate that neither Harald nor Anders
wants to duel with submachineguns at 5 paces.

William White writes a whole heap of good stuff:

Sure. I\'ve never said \'feudal technocracy\' couldn\'t actually be non-feudal.
I\'ve merely postulated that it was and argued from that assumption.

The essence of the definitions of feudalism I\'ve seen is that you \'pay\'
for tenancy with services instead of money.

The rest of your arguments are all very nicely thought out. But I suggest
that the technocracy bit lies in the substitution of industry for land as
the feudal fief. Thus the fiefholder might render technological service
instead of or in addition to military service.

Otherwise your posting is most impressive.

Admiral Jackie Fisher was First Sea Lord of the British Admiralty at the turn 
of the century, and he invented the all-big-gun battleship -- called the
1st one Deadnaught.  (More or less invented, I know about the Italian and
US developments at the time, by it was Dreadnaught that set the standard)

Agreed.  Also, I notice that Meson screens and Nuclear Dampers have antennas
in their designs.  If I destroy those antennas, do I get a prize?

Actually, my problem with MT was the same as my problem with HG -- the use of 
weapons as damage absorbers.  It was like covering the Iowa with 50-cal MG\'s
and then saying you had to knock them all out before you could take out a
big gun.  The new rules suit me a lot better.

I don\'t think 2000 is going to turn out to be that much armour once we get going
at ship design.  We probably need some sort of structure to compare apples and
apples, like TCS provided for high guard.  Perhaps we should be working on
designs in a TCS environment  -- say TL14, unlimitted pilots.

I like the idea of a contact nuke, but I guess our friends at GDW don\'t.  I

after  all  with bipod and scope the extream range is  Just  over
4.5 Km and this should cause spotting problems.


All for now.

I would suggest that, given a strong memory of the rebellion, Regency forces
would be controlled at a far more cetralized level.  Fleets would still be
deployed to subsectors, but ship, squadron and command staff rotations would 
frequent to avoid forming local alliances.  I would suspect that jump capable
"provincial" forces would also be banned, and local defence command would 
be assigned by central command.

The pay-off in return would be a greater scope in Regency-wide affairs than 
would have been possible under the Imperium.

Has enough data been posted to permit development of a TCS (or alternative,
take your pick) budget for the fleet?  The regency and its enemies could form 
a good focus for our ship design and tactics discussion.

I rather liked H. Beam Pipers term from the Terran Federation period -- The
"Fleet-Army Force."  It identifies the tie-in between the two components
very clearly.

I\'ll be happy to work from pretty much any formula for budget, etc.  TCS does
give a number, however.  (On the other hand, maybe its the wrong number.
The very fact that a TCS campaign is a straight wargame means that you start
the whole exercise in an arms race.  What are the big-time threats to the 
Regency right now?  Is there an active arms race on with any of them?  I think
these factors are more important than the budget numbers.  Then there is the
question of the proportion of fleet resourses going to anti-virus defence...)

Right, I\'ve been playing around with FFS for a while now, designing
this and mulling over that - the general thing, and I\'ve got some
ideas/questions that maybe other people have worked on:

Please note that I haven\'t got the book with me at work, so I\'ll just
have to guess most of the figures, but I hope they are almost
correct.

1) Homopolar Generators. These seem to be the major restriction on the
size of most devices, especially weaponry, within FFS. However, I got
wondering about whether batteries could be used in their place. One
quick calculation later, and I come up with the following:

For a laser, I assumed each pulse lasts about 0.1 seconds, therefore
we need the 0.036 sec discharge rate battery type (or we could
extrapolate). This has an output of x3125 at 3MW (?) at TL15. This
comes to (3125X3X0.036)=337.5Mj per cumet. HPGs are 0.04 cumet per Mj
(?) which is only 25Mj per cumet. This gets even wider a discrepancy
at lower discharge times, so a meson gun at 100 shots/turn would only
really need the 3.6 second battery which works out at about 1350Mj per
cumet.

This creates a slight technology gap... I am of course assuming
batteries can be recharged at that speed, which I would have thought
was possible, as they can discharge that fast!

I also cannot believe that a spinning wheel (which is what HPGs are at
TL 8+(?) ) can give up all x000Mj of energy in a short a space as
0.036 seconds. Has anyone tried working out the friction or even the
speed the wheel would need to be spinning at to store so much energy?
I can believe large power capacitors, so why this rotational K.E.
system?

2) What is there to prevent the same HPG being used for more than one
weapon? The rules state that the HPG is capable of keeping up with any
rate of fire (again I don\'t believe that), so if it can manage 800
shots/turn, why can\'t it drive four different focal arrays at 200
shots/turn? All that would be needed is the extra focal arrays, an
extra beam pointer for each FA, and some extra control (this could be
an MFD to drive the FAs or maybe install three extra workstations). I
first though of this idea for a Janus mount, where the two identical
spinal weapons were synched to fire alternately from the same HPG.

3) Black Globes used as solar arrays seem to absorb one heck of a lot
of energy. In the habitable zone, a gigantic size globe will absorb
1/10 (1200^2) = 144,000MW!! Over one single turn, this will be
1800x144,000 = 259 million Mj - try absorbing that lot into a HPG
without overload.

Even a smaller screen will absorb 1/10 (40^2) = 160MW which is 288,000
Mj per turn - has this lot got to be taken into account when designing
the HPGs for absorbing incoming fire?

Maybe we can drag a small ship behind the main craft carrying a black
globe generator and use that as the power supply for my craft....

4) Why does anyone bother with tunable lasers at TL13+ when x-ray
lasers become available? The range modification of any atmosphere
condition is never worse than ten times smaller than the visible laser
modifier, so an x-ray laser with a range multiplier of 100,000 is
always better than the tunable one.

5) Why did GDW have to go and make fusion weapons non-viable as space
weaponry anymore? Grumble moan grumble. Have to make my OWN rules now.
*sigh*

6) When designing bay PAWs, would it be possible to have the tunnel
along the greatest diagonal of the bay? As far as I can remember, the
100 ton bay has dimension of 15.65 x 9.5 x 9.5 thus restricting tunnel
length to 15.65m.

But the greatest diagonal is 20.6m, thus effecting an increase of
tunnel length of 33% or so. Much better....

Same effect applies with turrets and barbettes if you fancy generating
PAW turrets or even close range Meson barbettes.

Personally, I just ignore the standard socket designs myself, and just
design the weapons into the body of the ship - no waste of space and
free to choose my own dimensions.

Which brings me to...

7) How do I calculate the maximum dimensions in the other two
directions on a ship? I know the length - but what about width and
height? At the moment, I am assuming that it can be derived from the
average cross-sectional area: i.e.

Volume/Length = avg cross-sectional area.

The width and height can then be derived from them. A cylinder or
needle config would just be sqrt(area), and other configs can have
widths and heights of any reasonable figures which multiply together
to the area. This are the main body figures. Thus, I know roughly how
large my sideways facing meson guns can be....

Anyone any other ideas? Perhaps a table of W and H multipliers might
be a good idea.

8) Where are the design rules for the bulk of space missiles? I have
found the warhead and propellant rules, but what about guidance design
etc? Have I just missed them?

Oh well, thats enough for now. Otherwise, it\'s a wonderful book. I
just hope we\'ll get to see FFS 2 or something similar, with computer
programs, robots, ships, submersibles etc etc.

Aha! Just remembered - in the TNE rule book, it lists an expanded
version of the battery list for higher TLs, and tells you how to
design them for any piece of equipment. Just one small question - no
piece of equipment actually has a power requirment listed with it! So
how do we work it out then? Anyone done a table?

Here\'s one crack at it...

Regency Military Forces -- Basic Structure.

The basic organizational unit of the Regency armed forces is 
the Regiment.  Paradoxically, the Regiment is a unit which 
will never be encountered on the battlefield.

Instead, the Regiment is composed of two or more battalions.  
The base battalion remains fixed to a recruiting territory -- 
a fixed area of a given world.  It is responsible for 
administration, recruiting and basic training of individuals 
who will then serve with the Regiment\'s 1-2 active service 
battalions.  In addition, the battalion may maintain one or 
more reserve battalions -- part time soldiers and veterans 
using out-of-date equipment.

All Battalions of a Regiment are of the same troop type.  
Thus the Battalion is the building block of other formations.  
Regiments are recruited based on the society and capabilities 
of the home world -- for instance, low tech worlds produce 
light infantry regiment, while armored troops are recruited 
on worlds where advanced technology is more familiar.  In 
particular, space EVA units are be recruited as much as 
possible in asteroid belts.

Special Service Regiments (SAS, Drop Troops, whatever) are a 
detached assignment of the best troops from line regiments.  
Members retain their regimental assignments, and return to 
their regiments (probably to a promotion) on the completion 
of their tour.

Higher level formations are built up of Brigades, a formation 
made up of 2-4 Battalions.  Although Brigades have no 
"permanent" structure, the value of established team 
relationships is recognized, and long term partnerships 
between complementary battalions (say, lift infantry and grav 
tank) is commonplace.

In a combat situation, Battalion and Company combat teams 
will be formed by the brigade commander as required for the 
mission at hand out of the component companies of his 
brigade.

Officers also remain members of their regiment for their 
whole careers, but may be detached to various staff commands 
for extended periods.  Above field grades, regimental 
membership has more to do with club membership than command 
structure.

I hope this is helpful.  It is, of course, the British / 
Commonwealth regimental system;  but I think that it is an 
approach with real virtues in military terms, and good 
adventuring flavor.

I will put some thought into higher formations, to troop 
types, and "how large should a battalion be, anyway?"

    'body' => 'I\'ve been seeing the terms "zaibatsu" and "keiretsu" tossed about
rather freely in the discussion on what "feudal technocracy" really
means in Traveller.  Just in case the only understanding of these
terms is coming from bad cyberpunk, here\'s a fairly lengthy except
from _The Japanese Today_ which hopefully explains some of this.
Incidentally, I highly recommend that book if you are interested 
in Japan and need a place to start, especially since I had to hack
up this essay a bit to hit the high points.

I also think that I should take a moment to point out that DGP\'s
WBH allows representative authority of a feudal technocracy to
range from a single ruler, through various types of councils, to
rule by the *demos*, so there should be a wide range of types of
feudal technocracies.  Be flexible!


from: _Traveller: The New Era_, 1993, p.188.

"Feudal Technocracy.  Government by specific individuals for those
 who agree to be ruled.  Relationships are based on the performance
 of technical activities which are mutually beneficial."
 

from: Reischauer, Edwin O.  _The Japanese Today_, 1988, p.305-7.

"In prewar times, the distinctive Japanese economic institution that
 most caught the attention of the outside world was the so-called
 *zaibatsu* system.  The term *zaibatsu* is perjorative, meaning 
 "financial clique".  It is specifically applied to certain giant 
 financial, commercial, and industrial combines but is loosely used for
 prewar Japanese big business in general.  [...]
 
"The zaibatsu came to control a very large part of the upper level of
 the Japanese economy [...] ...before long the government became 
 suspicious of the growing influence of big business... [...]
 
"It is ironic that after the war the American occupation in turn 
 attacked the zaibatsu for being the root cause of Japanese imperialism
 and on these grounds singled them out for destruction.  Their ownership
 was removed from the controlling families virtually without compensation,
 and the great combines were broken up into their component parts.  
 Before they could be further atomized in a traditional American "trust-
 busting" operation, the occupation\'s reform program was halted, leaving
 the larger corporate subunits of the original zaibatsu intact.  Since
 the occupation, these have gradually reassumed their old names [...] 
 and have drawn together in loose, informal associations, now known in
 Japan as *keiretsu*.
 
"Because of the existence of these keiretsu groupings, many observers
 have asserted that the zaibatsu system has been restored, but this is
 not correct.  The keiretsu form something like clubs, whose members
 may look first to each other for aid and cooperation before trying
 other sources. [...]  But these relations are by no means exclusive,
 and there is no central ownership and none of the rigid controls once
 excersised within a zaibatsu organization. [...]
 
" ...zaibatsu were typically under the control of a central holding
 company, largely owned by the original family.  The holding company
 controlled several major affiliates and these in turn a series of
 minor affiliates.  This sort of pyramiding of control is common enough
 in the West, but what made the Japanese case unique was the fact that
 the controlling company often lacked majority ownership....  Control,
 however, was exercised through other means.  The affiliate would
 probably be completely dependent on the banking, shipping, and trading
 facilities of the combine; interlocking directors were common; 
 executives were switched around among the component firms as though
 they were members of a unified bureaucracy; the advantages and prestige
 of belonging to a large zaibatsu combine were great; and a strong sense
 of personal loyalty to the combine permeated the leadership, much as in
 a pre-modern feudal domain.  Young executives joined a zaibatsu 
 enterprise for a lifetime career.
 
"A typical zaibatsu organization was not like the contemporary American
 conglomerates, which bring together entirely unrelated corporations
 under the same ownership.  Instead, they were rational outgrowths of
 evolving economic activity and therefore are better described as 
 combines.  They tended to cluster around a central bank that financed
 the various activities of the combine.  These functions often stood in
 a vertical relationship.  For example, a series of seperate companies
 might mine a certain ore, fashion it into manufactured products, 
 transport those abroad on the combine\'s shipping line, and sell them 
 abroad and purchase the needed raw materials for the whole process
 through the combines "general trading company" [...], while all of
 these different stages of the operation would be financed by the 
 combine\'s bank."
 
I hope this helps out a bit!

    'body' => 'Hi all,
	in the recent discussion of feudalism and feudal technocracy it seems
there has been some talking at cross-purposes.

	Some relevant powers of a feudal king which have not been mentioned
are the powers to grant new titles and existing unheld titles and the
administration of disputes between vassals( and hence law). This power is
significant when it comes to the sharing-out of newly obtained resources,
whether from conquest, purchase or legal skulduggery. 

The feudal system is inherently unstable, especially in times of transition 
when there may be no clear heir or successor. (this sounds familiar...oops
:-) ). It involves a continual struggle for power between the king and the
vassals and between the vassals, as the king attempts to safeguard his
position by centralising power, and the vassals attempt to strengthen
their positions, and reduce the king\'s power (consciously or otherwise).

	David Johnson has been alluding to the "strong barons" version of
feudalism where the vassals are in a position to pick and choose their
king(IMHO). Hans Rancke has written about a "strong king" version of
feudalism where the vassals are due to circumstances stuck with the
current king, like it or not. Both these versions are historically 
recorded examples of the feudal system in action.
 
	In the first version the king\'s power is limited to what the vassals 
will accept. This may even go so far as to the king being relegated to a 
figurehead. The vassals are most definitely the owners of their feifs and will
strenuously resist interference in them by the king( or anyone else for that
matter). Here the vassals may form a united block behind a figurehead king
(oligarchy-like) or may squabble disastrously as an ineffectual king\'s calls
for peace and unity are ignored. In the latter case the king may fall and
total balkanisation may ensue if no resolution is reached.

In the second version the king is most definitely boss, with overwhelming
support from the majority of his vassals. In this position the king is 
very powerful, and effectively does control \'everything\'. He can introduce
laws strengthening his rule, declare rebellious vassals to be outlaws and 
strip them of their holding,(to be awarded to loyal followers), and pretty much
do as he likes. If this continues for long enough the government may change
to another type, such as a dictatorship. (In this version of feudalism all
land WAS ultimately ruled by the king, and doled out to his loyal vassals).

The normal feudal position is between these two extremes. The king is 
powerful and has significant latitude of action, but must listen to his
vassals and be careful not to upset the majority of them too much. 
The vassals wish stability and will follow the king unless he becomes
too unreasonable or overbearing in his rulings.

David wishes to prove that Sacnoth should rule the Sword Worlds by virtue of
its TL advantage over the official ruling planet, Gram. While is certainly
possible for this change to occur, it is by no means automatic. There are
many other relevant factors which are not specified and which would affect
the outcome. It is possible to set up a campaign to justify almost any 
prejudice a referee has. Maybe Sacnoth has a policy of appeasement so they 
are not the ones bombed by an attacking force. Maybe there is something in
the atmosphere or soil of Sacnoth that makes the inhabitants less aggressive,
or conversely the inhabitants of Gram are more aggressive. Maybe the Zhodani
are mind-controlling the Sacnothians into acquiescence etc, etc. Anything can
be justified, nothing is automatic.

Hope my contribution to this thread makes sense,

	And only a few weeks ago people were arguing that TML was 
moribund!   Excellent post!

	A few nits to pick, though.  Many of the examples you give of 
feaudalism, such as corporate feudalism, are already present in the 
government type structure, such as the corporate state.  I think the 
critical difference is the lack of or highly limited societal mobility.  A 
common thread throughout all your examples is the codification of 
position as hereditary...I think that this could serve as the sole 
definition of a feudal state, and the basis of that segregation, military, 
contract, medical or whatever is less important.  

	Indeed many of your examples are not precisely feudal in 
nature, but more like technocracies, ie: the technical or scientific elite 
holding power.

	A feudal society was as marked by the responsibilities of the 
higher classes to the lower as by their rights...all power derived from 
the bottom, in reality...just look at the restoration of the Meijii 
emperor over the Shogunate in 19th century Japan.  That change was 
spearheaded by some rather small, rural provinces.

	Since, whether GDW based the Sword Worlds entire or only part 
on Piper\'s book, I re-read Space Viking the other day.  In it the 
protagonist (Prince Trask) expresses surprise that an outsider 
declared his (very classic land and production based) feudal society as 
a tyranny.  Trask than explains that no one has any power that is not 
explicitly granted by the people below, and all that has to be done to 
eliminate a tyranny is withhold the support necessary.  In fact, this is 
very much like European \'classical\' feudalism...The king theoretically 
wielded great power, but only as long as he held the support of the 
lesser nobles, who only wielded their power with the support of those 
below, etc. because the true power...armies, were not standing, but 
composed of all those lower knights and barons, who quite freely 
looked out for their own hides.  The pledged fealty to the king, but that 
oath was binding both ways...the king had to act to their benefit, or he 
had no power.

	This is really only possible in lower populations, where the 
lowest tiers of the society still wields enough political power to 
make a difference.  This argues forcefully against large population 
feudal states.  The Japanese example I had mentioned before was not

evolved from a true military-based feudal state to a giant

 idea in his rapid-fire anti-missile laser.  He suggested that this weapon
system would be an ideal system to mount on a Battleship to defaeat huge
clouds of missiles launched by escorts.

About a week ago, there was a small TML furor over what role (if any) a
frigate class ship would have in an Imperial Fleet.  In the US Navy, a
Frigate is a screening vessel, used for anti-missile, anti-air and anti-sub
defense.  Perhaps Frigates would play a similar role in an Imperial Fleet.
A Frigate would be a small (5,000 to 10,000 tons displacement) ship,
equipped with long-range sensors and defensive laser batteries.  To aid
in its anti-missile role, it would also be equipped with the anti-missile
lasers.  It would also carry a large number of EMS jamming suites, either
on the ship or in the form of remote drones. 

In this configuration, a Frigate would also make an admirable space
minesweeper.  Its small size might allow it to avoid sensor lock from the
mines, and its weapons would already be configured for targeting and
destroying large numbers of missiles/mines quickly.

(Of course, this assumes everybody else enjoys laying fields of independent
ship\'s missiles as mines, like I do to my PCs from time to time).

This still leaves the question about what escorts do in a fleet.  I think
anything smaller than a destroyer is going to be of very limited usefulness
in a fleet action.  I think the \'scrubbing\' of surface features would be
a fighter mission, not a escort mission.  Escorts could launch clouds of
missiles, but I think this would be better served with a purpose-built
design (something like the Brilliant Lances Missile Corvette, but with
more launchers).  

In reality, destroyer escorts would certainly be of use in small
ship actions and actions against civilian or paramilitary ships, but in actual
fleet actions escorts would be relegated to acting as security elements on
the edges of fleet formations, and acting as sensor platforms and 
communications links.  They would still be very useful for chasing nosy
PCs away from fleet formations.

This does not reflect the views of my employers.  They are so heavily
armored as to be impenetrable to all but the Death Star main gun.

If they weren\'t so expensive, I can just see this tiny little missile
with a BG generator and capacitor and HEPLAR drive and guidance...
no powerplant, it uses the BG and caps/HPG/whatever and then does
little bursts of accelleration... and then rams.

I did think about this, but I like my notion that these six represent the
Droyne concept of elements. If they do then Soil is more representative
of all kinds of ground surfaces than of argricultural land only.

Some of them, like the flame, the sigma wave, and the ice crystal, yes.
But the \'full-body representation of a human\' seem pretty direct. That\'s
one reason why I decided that the six small pictures of the Droyne castes
could concievably be on the coyns.

Interesting idea. I\'ll see if I can make something of it.

Oh sure. But then, the Phoenix presumably wasn\'t caled Phoenix either. 
This is just a translation. Eskaoyt is what a human archeologist would
cal it if he ever figured it out.

Agreed. I don\'t think the Vargr would make it  -  at that time they were just
one of a number of projects, confined to one world (In my Traveler universe,
at least, the Ancients tried other animals as subject for uplifting, but most
of them failed and none apart from the Vargr achieved major status (there\'s
one planet in my Foreven Sector with a race uplifted from otters)). But the
humans could have. However, I decided on the assumption that the coyns were
less important to the Ancients  -  more important than just cards, but not
as important as when the very continuation of your species depend on them.
So I\'ve assumed that they were not modified in Ancient times. Entirely a
matter of choice, of course.

For my part I abhor the causality violation implicit in precognition 
(unless the precognition is merely really good extrapolation ability).
So I assume that the Aslan coyn didn\'t get introduced until the Aslans
were already into space in a big way. As far as I\'m concerned Grand-
daddy (or, in my universe, the mysterious beings behind the Grandfather 
Legend) made one of his every-10,000-year visits to our universe around
- -1000 and updated the coyns at the time.

That is another possibility that I\'ve considered, but why would Gramps
bother?

True. But if the six lost coins really was hunting animals then the other
coyns were propably made up at a time when hunting was still important to
the Droyne.

A very interesting idea! However, that would mean that Sacrifice couldn\'t

Now put yourself in the Regency.  Virus has made every piece of 
electronics potentially dangerous.  Maybe it will get infected and try to 
wipe you out.  Maybe it will just hold an egg to infect something 
bigger.  The threat Virus poses is very real.  Dealing with this threat 
will profoundly change the Regency.  Think of all of the computers and 
electronic they must have.  Why to convert them to safer configurations 
could take decades...

Any formation of Regency Military Forces must have an Electronic Warfare 
Unit.  This unit would provide Virus protection in addition to more 
traditional EW functions.  I imagine it would also have to have some

 Wes Esser <wesley.esser@hd62.haledorr.com> posted a massive undertaking in
the
form of his vision of the Rgency government.  The majority of his
masterpiece is quite well thought out.  In particular the idea of a
planetary leaning in the one legislative arm and a population-based
slant in the other, the short take on the executive branch is sensible
and to the point, and the placement of the Regent in the scheme of
things.  Some points follow that I do wish to take issue with:

- - District courts: while matching the lowest level courts with the
Senatorial Districts I think there would be some basis for Planetary
Courts either in place of or in addition to these District Courts.
This would keep much of the local agenda from being decided by those
from different worlds.  This also would save on transportation costs.
At any level are jurors chosen in a manner similar to that in the
United Sates?  If so it is far less costly to move people about on a
single world (or system) than it would be to transport them one or
more parsecs, not to mention the time involved.  Think also of cost in
travel incurred by legal representation that need to travel to a
different system to participate in cases - or does the court travel to
the different planets to hear cases?  Obviously this applies to those
districts encompassing multiple systems.

- - Senate term length: 10 years seems like a long term.  Personally I\'d
favor four or five year terms.  I guess I\'m just a product of my
environment :) (check the trailer to see where)

- - Military: I agree that the military is not one of the branches of the
gov\'t but it does have some influence in the governing of the Regency
- - especially considering the quarantine and rapproachment with the
Zhos.  BTW does the Regency (and formerly the Imperium) have a
separate police force or is the military, particularly the army and
navy, given the task of enforcing laws?  Also shouldn\'t that be C-in-C
of the REGENCY Navy and Supreme Marshal of the REGENCY Army?

An improved method of achieving this objective, IMHO, would seem to be a
carrier/tended equiped with a number of remotely-piloted vehicles guided
from the mother ship.  This would allow the delivery systems to carry
the same punch with better maneuver performance as space for crew and
life-support would not be needed.

Regarding the ship classifications I like the proposed scheme that
battleships carry the heaviest weapons available at a given tech level
but modified to include armor in sufficient quantity to prevent turret
(& possibly bay) weapon penetration.  Cruisers would be armed similar to
battleships but without the full armor.  Lighter ships (destroyers,
frigates) would probably suffice with bay weapons and escorts and
cutters might only be expected to carry turreted weapons.

To add my Cr2\'s worth to the SDB argument - ships are tough to come by,
and they are expensive.  TNE pirate ships typically are modified
merchants and warships valued around MCr200-225.  As such one SDB coming
to the aid of a merchant harassed by one or two pirates is a definite
threat.  Also in the post re. protection of shipping lanes while the SDB
must maneuver to the location of the pirate the victim should be running
to the SDB and unless grappled and thrust applied in a different
direction will continue to do so thus decreasing the time until the
cavalry arrives on the scene.

Perhaps the fluctuations in the SWs TLs are due to a variety of internal
causes.  I\'m not entirely sure I understand the feudal technocracy govt
but suppose it allows for a large amount of \'infighting\' among the
junior levels of the technocracy on each world.

This may only take the form of buying out each other\'s economic assets
on up to sabotage of various forms and possibly assassination and
warfare.  Suppose every so often these small manueverings among the
technocrats build to a particularly large crescendo that results in a
large loss of the economic/industrial infrastructure with a
corresponding drop in TL.

Furthermore perhaps this postulated internecine rivalry may be more
prevalent on some worlds (such as Sacnoth) than on others (Gram) which
causes more of an introspective world-view and prevents Sacnoth from
gaining political control of the Sword World governing body despite a
higher level of technological achievement.  In fact it isn\'t all that
difficult to imagine, given such a scenario, that Gram may very well
sponsor various acts of espionage and intrigue just to ensure their
position and also to see that Sacnoth doesn\'t come to power.

Just an idea that occurred to me while enjoying the "The Hans and David
Show."  :)

Perhaps, but lasers provide a solution to the question of how to arm a small
ship to have some impact against large ships.  You are right on the effect on
Traveller "tradition" however -- traditionally, HG fighters are so much 
twaddle.

The X-ray laser bothers me, however.  Unless my spreadsheet in completly wrong
(and it works for the book example) with an X-Ray laser I can punch full
power out to 80 hexes with a nominal (1 meter) focal array.  I would sooner
see some meaningful range depreciation.  On the other hand, if you make a 
set of technological assumptions, you should live the consequences.

For the lasers I am designing (6-8 Gj input energy) some limitation on power
transmission might make some sense.  As it is the light SDB I am designing
right now will look like a capaciter with an attitude -- mostly HPG\'s.

Because I do intend to design to the rules as written, pushing the envelope 
where needed.  If we all do that, we may find the tradeoffs between armour,
punch, and speed that the new rules impose.  If there are truely none, if 
there turn out to be no limitting factors, then we can talk about fixes.

In the meantime, do you have a sheet of factor 2000 armour you would like a 1m 
hole in? :-).

fomulas used are based on TCS formulas. However rumour has it that TCS
figures don\'t necessarily apply to the Imperium (or necessarily anything
else in the traveller universe).
    Therefore the best thing to do is maybe forget the TCS vs 5FW debate
and start anew by testing the TNE figures givenn in the RCEs sourcebook.
But that\'s my opinion.....

ABSTRACT
        Economic statistics derived from the sector UWP listings in the
        GEnie library. Note that Traveller and MegaTraveller are trademarks
        owned by GDW. The sector listings are also owned.
 
NOTES:
An asterisk before a Sector name signifies there is system information missing
in that sector file.
 
\'Urb\' identifies \'urban systems\' that are high population, high technology.
The population figures are given in millions.
Gross product is in trillion Imperial credits. (TL 15 credits.)
All Gross Subsector Product figures are given in Imperial Credits,
using the conversion table in Striker Book 2.
 
Starport ship capacity is given in millions of displacement tons.
Shipyard Capacity formula: capacity = total pop * (GM = 1) / 1000

========================================================================
 
    Insofar as ship sizes are concerned (for the figuring of ship
classifications). CT made large vessels likely and probable given the combat
and design rules. MT made warships top out at about 50k tons or less because
of the combat rules (Meson guns made larger vessels impratical except for
maybe showing the flag.... otherwise they appeared to be to fragile in
combat). With the advent of TNE maybe the balance has gone back to CT sizes
(or has it). So far this last is unknown till some designs get generated
and combat done.
    Plus RCEs and Regency ship classifications will differ because of the
big buiding gap. (Which also brings up building capacity... looking
at Oriflamme[?] as an example of sorts might be wortwhile).

Has anyone got the RCES equipment manual and some time ?

the  shot guns as by my calculations they dont work at  all ,  id
be  much  graetful  for this as im  now  having  serios  thoughts

  FEUDAL TECHNOCRACY AND JAPANESE TERMS (and firms!)

As for US industry, part of the problem is the Japanese are much better
about long-term planning than we have been.  US companies seem to think
of next-quarter\'s profits.  Japanese firms try to think of next decade\'s.
Then, there\'s other cultural barriers...but that\'s off on a tangent.

>It sound like the *kieritsu* is merely capitalism without anti-trust laws.

No, not really.  The Japanese *do* have anti-trust laws -- the US
helped write some of them in the late forties.  They\'re run by that
boogeyman of the US, MITI (Ministry of Int\'l Trade and Industry), 
I believe.  And please be careful about the differences between 
keiretsu and zaibatsu -- they are like apples and oranges (to use a 
cliche).  They\'re both fruit.  They\'re both more-or-less round.  They
are not the same thing.  

Let me try explaining the difference again in a *very* rough and at
least partly inaccurate way.  Zaibatsu were focused, vaguely feudal
cartels which, while not monopolies, occasionally were able to form
oligopolies in certain fields.  Keiretsu are loose, informal associations
which are in a sense networks of informal corporate "connections" 
that can work together to overcome problems.  Members of a keiretsu
aren\'t tied together in the way the zaibatsu were.  The part that makes
either of these look "feudal" to Westerners has a lot to do with, among
other things, the associated lifetime employment traditional in Japan.

Let\'s look at the Traveller terms again:

"Feudal Technocracy.  Government by specific individuals for those
 who agree to be ruled.  Relationships are based on the performance
 of technical activities which are mutually beneficial."
 
The first sentence is the "feudal" part.  The second sentence is the
"technocracy" part.  (Roughly.)
 
Note both what this says and doesn\'t say.  Government "for those who
agree to be ruled".  The zaibatsu concept works for this; you can
choose who you work for. Maybe they aren\'t interested in what you
can offer.  Maybe you aren\'t interested in what they offer.  So then
you both pick someone else.  Once you choose, it\'s expected that you 
have chosen for life.  In return, you have a place for life. 
The organization won\'t desert you, and you won\'t desert it.  This
whole thing is a lot like the freemen --> vassal process worked in
the middle ages.  Those relationships were based on mutual
protection, so the equivalence isn\'t quite total.  Whether or not
these relationships are hereditary isn\'t specified.  Neither is
societal inflexibility.  Such a system might be constructed in which
it is possible to start at the bottom and be gradually promoted into
a position of power, perhaps even one of the "specific individuals"
that help to run the whole system, by being at the top of their
particular feudal chain.

Another quote on early zaibatsu, same source as yesterday (p. 297):

"The ownership of large family enterprises remained in the hands of
 the original family, but management was gradually transferred to
 head clerks, who stayed with the company for life.  In fact, the
 whole business firm was a sort of extended family, with a strong
 sense of mutual loyalty between employees and employers...."
 
Kind of a cross between the two.  And more extreme systems either
way can easily be imagined.  And companies don\'t even need to be
part of it -- that isn\'t specified either!  There are many ways
to develop a government by specific individuals by those who
agree to be ruled, based on whatever.


  ASLAN AND FEUDALISM

Another system to look at in Traveller while considering this is
the Aslan Hierate\'s clan system, which culminates in the Tlaukhu,
the council of the Twenty-Nine.  While not a feudal technocracy, it
is a fairly feudal system.  The fteirle have no king.  But one is
properly respectful to the Yerlyaruiwoko!  Some clans are considered 
"more important" than others in stature, but there is no true central 
authority.  There\'s other cultural stuff going on here too, so 
be careful.  But you don\'t even *need* a single leader over everyone,
if you have another stable solution -- like a lot of little leaders
that don\'t go for each other\'s throats.

  OTHER RELATED GOVERNMENT TYPES

"Company/Corporation.  Government by a company managerial elite;
 citizens are company employees."
 
Note that this seems to imply one company in control.  Which makes
sense -- this government type is most often seen with small population
codes, so it works well for isolated mines, facilites, and so forth.
This covers everything from a SuSAG psi-drug facility on an otherwise
uninhabited world, to "The Chartered Zarathustra Company" which is
in charge of the resources and colonization of Zarathustra.  

Now, if you have a collection of companies which own or control bits
of the planet, perhaps a better code would be:

"Balkanization.  No central ruling authority exists; rival governments
 compete for control."

And in fact, most of the government types can be twisted in a way
that allow companies to be used, if you twist the company enough too.
That\'s the beauty of Traveller government types; they are flexible. 
A lot of the codes in the UWP are like this.  The idea of the UWP is
to have a system in which you can generate a sample world in ten 
minutes and then be able to take it and develop it massively in many
different possible directions.  Without a system in the game like 
the UWP, we\'d never be able to develop entire sectors in a way that
was at all realistic in a reasonable amount of time.

We seem to have sparked a great deal of interest with the feudal technocracy
discussion.  It\'s generated a lot of useful information, IMHO.

From Thurday night, Alistair Langsford <langsl@cbr.hhcs.gov.au> writes:

I guess I was looking for an explanation of the nature of the vassal
relationship.  In a medieval feudal aristocracy the lord received military
services and local resources from the vassal and in return provided 
coordinated security.  In a situation in which the technical vassals
`manage\' activities for the lord I don\'t see what they\'re getting in
return that is equivalent to the security provided by the medieval lord.
If all the `technocrats\' get is pay you really only have a corporate
system.

Okay, I was trying to focus on the specifics that distinguish a feudal 
technocracy from other forms like a corporate model or aristocractic
oligarchy.

Yes, this is key regardless of what terms are used to describe the

I think technocracy speaks of more than mere `management\' of technical
activities.  I beleive technocracy calls for *rule* of the society by
those with technical knowledge and skills.  I see `technical\' as being
much broader than just engineering and science - it is the entire network
of infrastructure that permits technical activities to occur - industry.

Certainly, but as I\'ve suggested elsewhere, I believe such a `specialized\'
feudal technocracy will be the exception rather than the rule, just as
representative democracies with a very narrowly defined demos will be the
exception.

Maybe except the key difference as I see it is that in a corporate system
there is no bond between employer and employee.  The employer may sever the
relationship (in effect remove your `citizenship\') at will.  This is why
corporate systems only occur at low population levels.

Again, yes, but this sort of dampens the discussion.  I find it useful and
interesting to focus on those aspects which *do* distinguish one form from
another.

As I\'m always one to stir the pot, how about this idea?  If we look at all
government types in terms on two key points: the nature of ruling authority
(who rules) and the source of that authority (who consents to that rule)
we can see that *all* government types, except those where a *single*
individual is able to exert *direct*, personal control over the others
(i.e., very small groups), are inherently *democratic* in the source of
of authority.  Even the most oppressive totalitiarian theocracy requires
*some* degree of consent from the populace in order to function.

This seems to be a point of some disagreement.  It seems to me it has been
suggested that anti-Viral activities will be the focus of the Quarantine
Service while more `traditional\' military activities would be handled by
the conventional military services.  I also seem to remember other suggestions
that there would not be such a distinction.  [WARNING! : I don\'t have TNE!]

What\'s the distinction here between `indigineous\' defense battalions
(those forces that remain on a particular world) and `mobile\' forces
(the `regular\' Army)?

Does this include aerospace and nautical forces?  I\'d like to see work

Yes, I\'d prefer a `strategic\' (dare I use that word again?) focus in
addition to a `tactical\' focus.  It seems to me it should be simple to start
at the `General Staff\' and `Admiralty\' level and work down just as it is
beneficial to start at the combat unit level and work up.

Let\'s get busy!

I think the final analysis of what fleet strengths should be lies
with each individual gamer\'s view of the universe.  You can argue
this source or that source forever, getting nowhere.  That\'s pointless,

Work it out yourself for your world.  Me?  When I work it out from

less military spending or different breakdowns of where it goes
and get an order or so less in magnitude in spending.

I\'m worried we\'re getting a little acrimonious here.  Let me state that I
*accept* that the techno-economic cycles are *possible*.  I find them very
*unlikely* based upon my understanding of economics *and* technology.  I
also find the idea of Zhodani support to be a more credible (and therefore
more likely) explanation for Gram\'s domination of the Sword Worlds.  I also
prefer this explantion from a *gaming* standpoint because it provides for
some interesting ramifications in the Sword Worlds should the nature of
Zhodani support for Gram change in the New Era.

I accept this.  And it *is* a factual record.  From *Supplement 3: The
Spinward Marches* to *MegaTraveller Journal* #3 we have a period of about
fifteen years of elapsed time.  Clearly there were some changes in this
data (you\'ve mentined the allegiance codes) so the fact that UWP changes
weren\'t made *must* be assumed to be intentional.  (Although I *suspect*
there *was* no intention, as in much of what\'s appeared over the years.)

Now [WARNING: I don\'t have TNE!] it\'s my understanding that there were some
significant UWP changes for the the Regina subsector material presented in
*TNE*.  Clearly, this is intentional as well.  Whether it is *reconcilable*
with any of the pre-TNE material is another matter.

I don\'t think it\'s that certain.  Yes, there may have been cycles but as
it stands the records show fifteen years of stagnation and *no* evidence of
any down turn.

Let\'s remember all this is occurring in a 2D universe!  How\'s that for a
suspension of disbelief?  Seriously, I, too, find the rate of technological
advancement inscrutably slow but can rationalize it as a legacy of Vilani
culture.  These `techno-economic cycles\' seem to add one more layer of
required suspension of disbelief for me, especially in the absence of any
evidence to support them.  You must also realize by now that we\'re you to come
up now with just *one* example of a down turn, I\'d explain it away as a mere
typo?  :-)

This is what grates with my economic and technological sensibilities.  You,
yourself, have maintained that *maintenance* of a particular level of
technology is easier than *advancing* into a new level.  Technological
capability may be tied to economic capability but it is not directly so.
Economies fluctuate all the time.  Technological fluctuation occurs much
less frequently and is a much more *serious* event.  I maintain that a
*severe* economic downturn would be required to produce a significant (in
terms of a tech level change) technological downturn.  Recall that our only
modern example where this sort of event *might* have happened is during the
Great Depression.

So, in conclusion Hans, I agree that these `techno-economic cycles\' are
quite *possible*, but based upon my understanding of economics and technology
they are, IMHO, very *unlikely* and virtually impossible on a wide-scale
basis such as an entire subsector, much less across an entire sector or
more.

Now on to the question of feudal technocracy.

Why not?  What if I had said `*holders* of industrial production\'?

> Let\'s get a few definitions

What I get from your emphasis on these defintions is a focus on *land*.
Is that where our disagreement lies?  I grant the `ownership of land\' by
the lord but don\'t see it as being very important despite what the venerable
Oxford tome has to say.  The key part of the lord\'s end of the feudal
agreement was the provision of coordinated security services, not some
tenuous grant of land possession.

Of course there is dissent among the various shareholders, just as there
was often dissent among the vassals of a particular lord.  I don\'t see
your point here.  What is there about this that suggests it isn\'t feudal?

The various shareholders in a *particular* corporation all hold `fealty\'
to the Chairman of *that* company.  This is akin to a medieval situation in
which a single individual had risen to the top of the feudal structure,
a king.  Maybe the difference here is that you\'re looking at, say, Gram,
as medieval Germany, while I\'m at looking the entire Sword Worlds as all of
medieval Europe?

I\'m confused.  You wrote:

> >>Traditional feudal society	Corporation		Feudal technocracy

Which suggested a three-way comparison to me: feudal aristocracy, corporate
system *and* feudal technocracy.  I guess I misunderstood you.

> And a vassal does what his liege lord says or he is \'fired\'.

In theory, yes.  In practice, not very often, unless the system had travelled
well down the road toward autocracy.  A corporate model is *always* auto-
cratic.

Etc.

Okay, I stand corrected.  I maintain though that this `ownership\' was not
the important, *practical* aspect of the lord\'s part of the feudal
agreement.  Rather, it was his provision of coordinated military services
that was what *mattered* in the feudal arrangement.

> Coordinated services may be the reason why the other lords decided to back

Okay, I stand corrected again,  You\'re talking about the *philosophy* of
feudalism (the legal basis) and I\'m talking about the *practice* of it (its
practical implementation).  I think my focus is more useful in trying to
understand the translation of the medeival feudal aristocracy to the 
feudal technocracy of Traveller.

> Look, the shareholders in a corporation is a conglomerate owner.

No.  The shareholders are a morass of different interests just like the
various vassals of a medieval lord.

> In theory
> they make up one person, the owner of the corporation.

Again, I don\'t think talking about theory is particularly useful.

> The Chairman works
> for the owner. The vassals \'works\' for the king. See the difference?

In practice there is *no* difference.  In *practice* the medieval king
`works\' for the vassals in provinding coordinated security services just
as the technocratic king works for the shareholders in providing 
coordinated profit services.  The medieval vassals provided military
service *and* taxes and the technocratic vassal provides financial
capital.  The two situations are *very* analogous, IMHO.

Just as any single bloc of shares has *one* owner.

Exactly.  Just as purchasers of shares gain title to their own new fief!

> And if a company is the 
> equivalent of a fief then there won\'t be any shareholders, just one baron.

No.  A private company, without public shareholders (there may *still* be
several *private* shareholders), is akin to a `barony\' on an island in
the middle of an ocean somewhere.  It\'s not part of a feudal system either.

> There can be no
> shareholders in a feudal fief, technocratic or not.

The group of shares held in common by any single shareholder (this may be
a group of individuals but with respect to their stock they are acting in
concert) *is* a fief!

> It sound like the *kieritsu* is merely capitalism without anti-trust laws.

I think that is a *great* definition of feudal technocracy!  See, because
it considers the entire economy (i.e., `capitalism\') it is much more 
complicated than any single corporate system.  (BTW, the reason there
*aren\'t* any anti-trust laws in a feudal technocracy is because political
power is tied directly to economic power - there is no `government\' to 
control the economic barons.  In a sense, the civil war on Joyeuse can
be seen as an `anti-trust\' action!)

> Nope. The central tenet of feudalism is *service* as a medium of repayment.

Again, you\'re arguing feudal *theory* and I\'m arguing feudal *practice*.
Medieval vassals paid taxes to their lords.

It seems to me you\'re still focused on a single company.  A feudal
technocracy has to involve the *entire* economy.  To use the *Space Viking*
model, there were probably `veterinary service\' fiefs under Traskon and
`geological service\' fiefs under Karvalmills, just as Traskon and 
Karvallmills were held in fealty to Duke Angus.  Remember that Trask
and Karvall were Angus\'s *vassals* but Trask later *sold* Traskon to
Angus. Ownership was not the legal basis for homage in Piper\'s Sword
Worlds.  Profit generation was.

Trask sold the entire barony because he needed it for the ship, *not* because
he couldn\'t sell it in parts!  (He was also anxious to get away from Gram.)

Why?  This happens all the time, now.  Through a series of mergers and

any telecommunications businesses as it\'s `core\'.

Okay, so he did just like I\'ve suggested Sacnoth ought to do with Gram.
He used his greater economic strength to acquire military force that
permitted him to quicken the process of economic hegemony and eventual
monopoly.  He convinced other Gram nobles to support him just like I
suggested Sacnoth might find supporters among the other Sword Worlds for
a move against Gram.  Are you arguing my case now?  :-)

Doesn\'t `glommed onto\' here mean the same thing as `controlling large blocks
of industrial production\'?  What difference does it make how they came into
possession?

No, I\'m not talking about the *company\'s* pension fund.  It\'s pension funds
for, say, teachers.  The teachers\' union has a pension fund for its members.
These funds can run to billions of dollars.  The manager of this pension
fund, hired by the teachers\' union, is responsible for gaining the best
return for the fund (or she get\'s fired - a corporate arrangement).  The
pension fund manager chooses to buy shares in, say, IBM.  The teachers\'
union becomes a shareholder of IBM, a `technocratic vassal\'.  If the fund
has purchased a large enough share of IBM it enjoys a great deal of influence
on the IBM board.  If IBM isn\'t profitable it\'s shares lose value and the
pension fund loses money.  This makes the teachers mad and the next thing 
you know, CEO Akers (the technocratic lord) is out and CEO Gerstner in now
running IBM.

It\'s actually much more complicated because the teachers\' union pension fund
is invested in General Motors and Exxon and Mitsubishi Industries, etc. as
well.  And then you have the railroad union, and the government employees
union, and Ross Perot, all the other investing shareholders in the market
place, including the corporations themselves which all own shares in each
other.  It\'s as complicated as medieval Germany.

Again, you\'re focused on theory and legal underpinnings.  Do you suppose
Duke Angus was acting within `legal\' bounds when he invaded Glaspyth?

Tom O\'Neill has already identified our respective focuses upon opposite
ends of the feudal spectrum.  (Although I don\'t see myself as *being* on
the other end - it\'s just easier to illustrate the workings of the
system from there.)

No.  In a feudal *technocracy*, economic power is tied directly to political
power.  (Just as political power was tied to land and military power in the
medieval feudal system.)

Because the Sword Worlds do not have the political stucutures outside of
the economic stucture that contemporary free-market governments do.  In
actuality, Gram is *more* vulnerable than the US.

Okay.  You argue this one with former-TMLer and flame-prone Mr. Higginbotham.

I was simply pointing out, as Duke Angus of Wardshaven recognized, that 
military action would speed up the process of economic domination.  It
makes domination happen quicker but it will happen regardless.

Yes, he did.  Very good.  I\'ve already responded on some points.

Try to get away from theoretical definitions an instead think about how
it is implemented in *practice*.

No.  It\'s based upon *possession*, of a land fief or a stock fief.  It is
manifest in the nature of the *obligations* (coordinated services on the
part of the lord, local services and resources on the part of the vassal)
arising from the feudal agreement.

Just a quick bit of recognition to those of you who joined in the feudal
technocracy debate.  Thanks to Bill White, Steve Bonneville, Tom O\'Neill,
Bruce Johnson, Pete Juzyk and, of course, my sparring partner, Hans Ranke,
for your participation and contributions.  This has been the sort of
inclusive discussion I\'ve always known the TML was capable of.

BTW, have you noticed the paltry level of particpation over on XTML so
far?  I told you all those gigabytes of pre-PIE (Post Imperial Era) in the
sky posts were mostly hot air.  :-)

Happy Travelling,

I know this has been hashed out once, but I thought another close
look at it couldn\'t hurt.

The maps of the Frontier-Wilds line in _Survival Margin_ and TNE 
don\'t quite jibe.  SM suggests that some vargr states in Gvurrdon
are still holding out.  (Look *above* the legend box near the Zho
border.)  TNE shows everything outside Regency/Consulate space to
be Wilds.  If you take all wilds to be virus-infested, then there
are no uninfected surviving vargr states.  So the Regency is 
forced to defend the entire coreward border at full force.

In Deneb, some subsectors are totally lost: Million, Atsah, and
Antra beyond the xboat line, and a world or two in Lamas.  Except
for some loss in Antra, these were mainly worlds *already* lost
to the vargr or the client states near Atadl.  The worlds in the
Great Rift, although shown otherwise, are isolated out far enough
to be safe.  The naval blockade at Catacomb (2234) is actually
*outside* the frontier line drawn.  No bases were at Catacomb as
of 1120.

In Reft, the Rift Republic is a Frontier.  However, so is the RC.
It belongs to neither side of the Rift -- it\'s jump-7 either way.
However, the link to the Denebians at Tonnurad was threatened by
the New Lords expansion in the 1120s.  The Republic\'s defense is
assured since the only virus approaches are through the Old Islands
worlds -- and we all know about how strong the local military is.
Otherwise, the Reft worlds on the Denebian side are fairly safe.
All have class-B starports, and there is a former Imperial Navy
base at Arnorac (2509) that had seen a sharp increase in traffic
since 1116, and which the RQS could use.

In Troy, the defensive line seems to exclude two important worlds
(the *only* two worlds) in the Binary subsector.  Both should be
safe.  First, they belong to the Denebian side of the Rift.  One,
Sarage (2938), was the site of an Imperial research station and
naval base.  The other, Auitawry, is a weird one.  An interdicted
droyne world at tech-15, with a class-A port, droyne naval base,
known Ancient site, and 500 million residents.  It might *own* the
other by now!  So even if virus could get there, it would have
a few troubles once the worlds had warning.

I wonder how Virus and the Ancient ship in Komesh would get along?

In Riftspan, the New Lords have it right.  The main jump-5 route
that runs through the mid-rift cluster has been cut just short
of it, at Aoki (1816).  Afatre (2219) on in is outside the line.
There is a *second* jump-5 route across the rift that branches
off at Esui, but it is also cut in the best place, at Waikhta
(1420).  The cuts are in just the right places to deny the virus
access to any worlds accessible on the Denebian side of the Rift.
From Waikhta, you can reach two worlds, and shortly the mid-Rift
cluster is accessible.  I fully expect that both systems look like
Aslan naval depots by now.

In fact, the Aslan line is far more defensible than the Regency\'s
position.  A better place for the Regency line would be Corridor/B
Windhorn/N, and the best would have been Corridor/D, Windhorn/P.
However, these were vargr held regions.  I suppose that the vargr
fought a valiant rear-guard action in Corridor and Windhorn to
try to save themselves and the states further to spinward (a success
would have brought "mongo charisma" <grin>) but undoubtedly it was
impossible for them to organize enough to form a tight barrier in
time.  It probably held long enough for Deneb to get organized, 
though.

I have a longer post which I\'ll get to soon I really want to get some 
permissions first as some of the "NPC\'s" are mine and one of my player\'s
P.C.\'s who are not really able to travell as they have duties to the 
Domain ( Tm. :-) ) so I make this post instead.
Last night Jim ( James Kundert ) and I were talking on the phone about a 
many things, Some pertaining to our campaign group, Where do we go from here
and the change over to the T:TNE rules set. 
One fo the things we discussed was the premise that you could and would see
Heplar, Fusion Rockets and thrusters in the same milue. Think for a munite.
say the technology for thrusters is a little esoteric and the method of 
manufacture requires a tech of a certain type then eariler ships or those  
built at places unable to build the ( VERY Expensive ) thrusters would use
the alternatives and the spaceports would know how to handel those ships.
"Just park it over there Yea thaat slagged down area". "I\'m sorry sir but
now that your ship si docked in the upstation your engines will have to be
locked out!"
Another idea that occured to me was how do you clean a starship? Especilly 
the interior. Programmible Vacuum cleaners? ( I was reading the Roche world 
why do you ask...? :-)) nobody has designed some thing like the Christmas
bush motile for traveller.
Jim pointed out that we haave traditionally had no good rules for the design 
of robots... Don\'t I know I was trying to design a character she is an 
excellent pilot working for the navy and weighs in at about 400 tons the 
latest in stealth thchnology and an accidental AI.
Why they can not replicate her is a murder mistery that I may run someday.
Any way she is test flown by an ex scout pilot ( irrreverent, but then aren\'t 
they all ;-)) she also meets a lady who explains to her her rights as a 
thinking being and she wants to muster out after 20yrs.... boy ain\'t INI gonna
love it... Her name is Paulinene ( as in peirls of... [ honist I did\'nt think 
of it really it\'s not my fault ;-)]). 
By the way on board the ship she has a holigraphic image for interacting
with humans, so unless you are pretty sharp, the casual observer might not
realize that the ship\'s pilot is not human...
Any way I\'ve rambeled on far to long but if some one wants to give a shot at 
designing a cleanbot, or Christmas Bush, Please do. as for paulene go ahead 
and use her if you want to drive your sensor ops crazy.
after all the idea is to 
Have Fun
isn\'t it???! :-) :-)
see ya

Impact missiles? Naaah forget it. I must agree with GDW in FF&S that the
change in rules and how the "real" world works you can\'t expect to get a
missile within impact range of a starship if it is armed with a laser.

Saturate the defenses? No way, if that should be pssible we must see
launchers with a ROF of at least 10 a minute, and the missile must have
more than 4Gh to spend of fuel. With the volume of the missiles and
magazine limit on the turrets and barbettes I find this unlikely.

But I can think of other types of missiles that can be of use. They
don\'t need to impact, but has to get real close to the target. I can
think of two types of missiles.
 - Antimatter missile
 - Black hole missile

Both missiles need small warheads compared to the missiles in TNE. One
gram of antimatter should be enough to fry a starship at a decent range.
The antimatter is held in a gravitic bottle and mixed with matter when
the missile is close enough to hurt the target.

Black hole missles can function in a similar way. When the missile is
close enough, the black hole can be released and "shot" at the target
with a gaussrifle thingie or something similar. A weapon like this will
be expensive, and thus only useable against battlecruisers or larger to
justify the cost.

I haven\'t given the starship design a full test to date. I\'m tinkering
with a ramscope ship for one of the alien races in Gvurrdon. The race is
not able to utilize jumpships due to a phenomenom that kills them during
jump. The reason I have made them vulnerable to jumpspace is that their
world is a TL 16 world, and that would put them in a position to quickly
conquer much of Gvurrdon before thay are stopped.

Anyway I think we will meet limitations in the designs as we put on
armor, drives and weapons. A fighting ship should have a decent Gh
rating or else it will run out of fuel mighty fast. And that is the
worst limitation of them all. Even a decent merchant get problems with
fuel, and a merchant in a brawl? He\'s in big trouble. Ten to twenty Gh
will run out pretty soon, and much of it has been spended to reach orbit
and jump point. I find it unlikely that merchants will refuel at a gas
giant, unless the mainworld orbits a gas giant, or the 100 diameter
limit of the star is far outside the habitable zone of the system, and
that the gas giant is in a favourable position for a route from jump
point to the world.

The un-manned turrets and barbettes require MFD\'s if installed. These
turrets and barbettes are recomended to be installed on larger starships
(2000tons or more) to save in on the crew count. The Turrets should then
be combined into batteries, with one MFD per battery.

Everyone seems to be getting into our TML Regency Sourcebook, *Shall Not
Perish*.  Fantastic.  Some broadly ranging comments:

Steven Gott <sgott@u.washington.edu> writes:

Does this mean you think the regular military will have a role in fighting
the Virus rather than this just being the responsibility of the Quarantine
Service?

An interesting concept.  Does this mean *every* military asset in the
Regency must be retrofitted in some fashion?  With that sort of government
spending going on I can\'t see the Regency economy `straining\' for decades.
(Of course, the rumored `need for economic expansion\' of the Regency in
TNE has always sounded too much like rehashed Reaganomics to me.)

You think so?  I would have thought that use of this sort of weapon would
have become quite inconceivable after the Viral Collapse.

Sword Worlds :-)

A `true\' heir to the Iridium Throne showing up with a Unification Fleet?
(Rebellion II).

Regency nobles upset at the `democractic\' reforms taking place (Rebellion
III).

Regency `democracts\' upset at the slow pace of `reforms\' (Rebellion IV).

Again, keep in mind that the judicial function was performed directly by
the nobility under the Imperium.  How might the nobility have come to
forfeit this right/responsibility?

At this level of court system we\'re not talking jury trial but rather 
courts presided over by judges - like the US Supreme Court and Circuit
Courts.

This was the original practice of the US Circuit Courts.  (The judge
travelled around the `circuit\'.)  Now, folks tavel to these courts.
I suspect the Regency model might be more akin to the early US model
(assuming the nobles have forfeited their judicial function which I\'m
not sure should or could be the case).

> - - Senate term length: 10 years seems like a long term.

Not if you keep in mind the travel times involved.  A senator from
Dunmag in Deneb is going to spend a lot of time just travelling back and
forth to Mora.  This is also the speed at which communication about issues
will travel between the capital and the home district.

> - - Military: I agree that the military is not one of the branches of the

Keep in mind that the separation of the military from the political
process is a decidedly modern, Western idea.  For most of human history
and still in many places today the military is a key player in the
political process.  This is also a part of the Imperial tradition.
Remember the Civil War and even the Rebellion.  This latter though,
might have led to some poltical efforts to *limit* the influence of
the military.  This might have been one of the ways the power of the
nobility was weakened.  Much of the power of the nobility has been
embodied in the military in the past.

Police operations *per se* were the primary responsibility of local
worlds.  The Imperial military serve in police roles with respect to
piracy and the like but most of what we consider to be `crime\' (robbery,
theft, assualt, embezzlement, etc.) was handled by local authorities.

Possibly.

Again, possibly, but this would have to be a *major*, traumatic event.
I don\'t see how it could occur very often or across several different
worlds.

Yes, of course, but is this somehow more plausible than the mere fact of
Zhodani assistance to prop up Gram?  I don\'t think so.  It also doesn\'t
present as interesting of possibilities as the Zhodani explanation if the
role of the Zhodani changes in TNE.

This is a good point.  Since we\'re examining the Regency it makes since
to use the *POT* figures, doesn\'t it?

This is a key difference between the feudal technocracy model and 
contemporary free-market economies.  In a feudal technocracy there is
no governmental entity outside of the economic system to intervene with
anti-trust or any other sort of regulation.

Thanks again for all this material about the *keiretsu* and *zaibatsu*,
Steve.  It\'s been very helpful *and* interesting.

(BTW, I have a great picture of me in front of the MITI building in Tokyo.
There\'s a `homeless\' man sitting in the background right in front of
the headquarters of this US `boogeyman\'.)

What makes it look feudal to me is the `inter-relatedness\' of the 
various corporate entities - something that is quite uncommon here in
the US.  There is clearly a system of agreements (explicit or implicit)
that define the roles and responsibilities of all participants.  It\'s
*quite* different from the autocractic corporate model.

I never meant to suggest that the *keiretsu* (I\'d never heard of the
*zaibatsu* before you mentioned it, Steve) fit my idea of a feudal 
technocracy perfectly.  Rather, the *keiretsu* merely served to
introduce the economic and industrial aspects of a feudal technocracy.
I felt this was needed since many of us are already familiar with the
aristocractic aspects of medieval feudalism but have little or no
familiarity with the industrial and economic basis of a technocracy.

> "Feudal Technocracy.  Government by specific individuals for those

I refuse to live with this miserably vague definition.  The first
sentence describes *any* representative democracy.  If we look at
`technical\' in the second sentence as meaning `any specialized branch of
knowledge\' then this entire definition might be used to describe a
popular theocracy in which clerical specialists perform various
religious rites for the `governed\'.  Thus, this canonical definition
is virtually useless.

The relationships between freedmen and serfs and the nobles in medieval
society was not feudalism at all.  Feudalism concerned the relationship
between members of the aristocracy, the ruling class.  Hence, a feudal
technocracy gives a system in which the relationships between the
members of the ruling class (the technocracy) are governed by feudal
principles.

Good point.  I hadn\'t thought of it this way.  I still think the government
codes could be improved though by focusing on the nature of authority (who
rules) and the source of authority (who consents).

Good work here.

The K\'kree rise again!  This, actually, is exactly the K\'kree tactical
solution to fighters spelled out in Alien Module 2.  They can\'t have a 
lot of fighter pilots in craft since they don\'t like cramped spaces.
So they hit on this solution.  The Fleet Marshal of the Kirunka\'rra
space wing is undoubtedly prepared for TNE!  Now if they can only fit
enough crew in their ships....

Give the gent a prize!  This gets at the difference between "feudal" and
non-"feudal" government.  (My understanding of why company/corporate rule 
is a low population feature is a bit different, but I went over that in
my last post.)

"Ah, this is obviously some strange usage of the word *democratic* that
 I wasn\'t previously aware of."  :)
I get the thesis here, that power is ultimately derived from the masses.  
But I don\'t know that I could possibly call an oppressive authoritarian 
government "democratic".

NEW INVESTMENT.  The point has been made many times on sci.space that it
is not possible to ressurect the Saturn V because the whole TL 6 infra-
structure of suppliers would have to be recreated.  This costs money, some-
thing one doesn\'t have a lot of in an economic down-turn.  To use another
example, lets say this country was in a severe depression and GM wanted
to cut costs.  Since it already had an existing TL 7 production plant, it
is not immediately going to switch to TL 6, because this would involve
retooling.  However, if this depression continued long enough the might
stop replacing their robot welders, and might start using people again.
GM also might begin designing "low-tech" cars that would eliminate a lot
of the cost of a car.  But again, it wouldn\'t do this quickly because
it would require them to retool their factories.  Also, GM would only do
this if they thought conditions would exist long enough to make the
investment worthwhile.  This whole process depends on how long their old
plant lasts until it wears out and how much it costs to go "low-tech."
	The above situation is unlikely to come about through the normal
business cycle because there are so many "automatic stabilizers" in 
economies that keep recessions from getting too deep or lasting too long.
Feudal Technocracies are likely to have even more of these stabilizers
than we do.  Life-time employment means that people will not quickly
lose their jobs, which will buoy consumer spending, for instance.
	To recap, TL decline through economic decline will only occur
through non-economic shocks like war, Virus, etc. and even then will only
occur when people have reason to believe that the economy will remain 
depressed for some time to come.

Gvurrdon sector library data.

by

Roger Myhre


Aek Elakfough (black cauldron): (Gvurrdon 0439). This system have
experienced an booming belting industry. In 1112 large amounts of
Titanium and Yttrium (latter which are used in the superconductive coils
of the grav vehicle modules). Both of the belts in the system have
proven to be rich on both substances. The number of inhabitants have
exploded since the news got publicly known. This forced the system
owners to build a fairly large spacehabitat. It is a wheel that revolves
to create gravity. It is known under the name of Aek Wheel. The
beltprofiles are: Orbit 1     100m,  n-20 m-70 c-10,  1AU
4       5Km, n-20 m-60 c-20,  0.5AU

Alloulloukde Tosoekh: One of the biggest ship warfs in the Gvurrdon
sector. It is based at Aengvoung (1726). It is reputed for its contact
net for connecting potential buyers to patrons for financing of crafts.
It boast that many of the crafts the Kforuzeng corsair band uses are
bought from them.

Ankhir (Gvurrdon 1728) C6869BB-7  Hi: This system have probably gone
through more hardship than most other systems in Gvurrdon. The
population lives under ground in tunnels. When the system was first
settled for 800 years ago it boasted with an advanced TL 11 technology.
Then the disaster struck. The small government did not succeed in
controlling the masses and civil war broke out. Following this war the
world got splintered between several powerblocks.  With more than 600
years of war and other minor conflicts the TL started to decline when
the harsh environment took its toll on the equipment. The fact is that
the surface temperature of this planet can sink down to - 237M-0C. The
following wars was then the matter of survival for the powerblocks.
About 50 years ago this system did get help from outside by request from
some minor factions. Firstly the helpers was met with resistance, but
later when the other factions had expended their stock of fighting
materiel they had to succumb for outside pressure. From this point the
planet got united under one central government. This planets largest
export articles are a strange sort of algae that lives in the oceans of
this planet. Orrkong, a shrimp like creature is also an export article.


Church of the Chosen One: This is a religious sect which has their base
at Aegadh (Gvurrdon 1317). They are the world rulers there. The sect
believes that the Ancients made the Vargr to populate this part of the
galaxy. The church does not worship the ancients, but just asks the
devotees to be faithful and to trust the church. The church do not have
any holy book as most other churches, but it boast an Ancient artifact
that the church claims to be a two way communicator with the Ancients.
This has not been proven when the artifact is looked up on as holy, and
no one has been allowed to inspect it scientifically. The powerbase of
the church has been waning since it were founded about 300 years ago.
The number of devotees was quite steady during the Rebellion. They did
note a slightly increase in 1125 to 1127, but frorm there the number
dropped steadily. So now they have turned inward, and redirecting their
resources to prove once and for all that the Vargr is the heir to the
Universe.


Denner (expr): Common name for Vargr from Freedom League, or more
commonly named Corsairs\' Den.


Dzen Aeng Kho: (Society of Equals.) This allegiance despite its name are
soldier based. To prove that you can be equal, you have to manage to go
through a dangerous test that could severely cripple those who are
unlucky. All non soldier professions are looked upon as under rated
beings. Medical profession is an exception to this when medics are
important to save the life of a wounded soldier. Anyone can try to
become an equal no matter what his or hers background is. Those who fail
the test is denied access to any soldier career. Even the cubs from an
equal have to prove itself as an equal before a soldier career are open
for the candidate. Equals and non equals are not permitted mate with
each other. The test can be taken anytime during the life, but it is
wise to take it early when young and old have to go through the same
test. The central body of the government are mainly built up by former
military career personnel that have retired active duty. Only equals can
vote in the parliament or run for some sort of governmental office.

REFEREE: For characters that are born in Dzen Aeng Kho, they have to
roll this task before they choose one of the following careers:  Any
military Officer, Leader, Aristocrat and Law enforcer.
Difficult, Willpower
Referee: On a Catastrophic Failure roll 1D+1 and subtract STR, AGL and
CON of the indicated amount. Example: The PC rolls a 4. He must subtract
2 from STR and one from both AGL and CON. For those who manage this task
give a CHA+1. If the parents of the character is rated equal give a -1
on the above task. The parents are rated equal on a roll of 15+ on 1D20


Edge, The (Expr): A terminlogy used of the political state between Thirz
Empire, and Society of Equals. Their "Cold War" status has everyone on
their toes. If a break in the quarantine line it will most likely be in
Society of Equals. They are zealously watching what Thirz Empire do,
rather than watching their border against the Virus. Their oppinions in
The Spinward Assembly are also a conflict. It looks like that they
oppose each others ideas, suggestions just for the spite of it. More
than one time Zhodani representatives had had to cool down the Thirz
Empire representatives. However as there is no-one is holding Society of
Equals in leash they seem to do and say whatever they will. However
everyone are starting to get a bit tired of them. And regency has
started to put on some pressure, but it hasn\'t taken any action, as a
war will surely open the quarantine line for the advance of the Virus.


Extends line contract: A contract between the Oberlindes Lines and the
government on Ougzdaelzoerrgh, Gvurrdon (2040). The contract gives
Oberlindes lines allowance to use the starport on Ougzdaelzoerrgh for
trading and supplying post for starships that are going into the
extends. This contract where vital for the Oberlindes to get when the
recent hostilities between Vargr forces and the DoD forces started in
1117. Oberlindes met much resistance in the Empire when they first took
initiative in mid 1119 to reopen their routes into Gvurrdon, when it got
closed by the hostilities. The line into Gvurrdon sector starts at
Dentus, Spinward Marches (2201).  During the war against the Kedzudh and
Kforuzeng alliance, the Imperial Navy had undercover agents working on
this base. Starport at Ougzdaelzoerrgh got upgraded to type A after
signing a contract with Oberlindes Lines. Oberlindes have a 47% share in
the starport.


Fair Witness: A new type of careers that has appeared in Thoengling
Empire. It all started with a proposition from the Thoengling cemtral
government to train certain high intellect Vargr to mediate in conflicts
and stay in as fair and correct witnesses. After a few years several
corporations started to use fair Witnesses in contract negotiations.
Today anyone can hire a fair witness if they can pay the price. A Fair
Witness will report anything he experiences, without giving his own
oppinion on what did transpire at a given event. Thus sometimes hiring a
fair witness can backfire, because many believe that the fair witness
will give testimony in the customers favor. AM-;Fair witness cost from
2000cr hour to the astronomical millions.


FEKI: An institute that have specialized on educating sophonts that do
not have the capability or money to spend to go to a normal college or
university. FEKI is short for Fo Engragvaegkfu Kuerrgars Ingaez. Which
can be translated to The School of Many Worlds. Costumers are usually
from low populated worlds and/or belts. They support a wide array of
courses that can be taken. From simple courses like drawing to more
demanding things like medical or engineering courses that takes a year
or two to run. The appliances are collected by mail, and a course
package are then sent to the pupil. What the course package contains
depends on the course taken. From just a few books to computer software
or computers specially made for the course taken. Homebase is on Ouse
Faeg/Ksits Uathu Odzuetarug (1724).  During the Virus craze FEKI almost
got bankrupted. All the more advanced courses was not selling when they
relied on computers. However as the fear from the Virus dropped the
costumers came back, and the more advanced courses started to sell
again.


Gnoerrgh Rukh Lloell: (Anti-Rukh coalition). This is a coalition of
worlds that did not rally behind the Great Leader Rukh in 972. Rukh\'s
Charisma forced billions to to his cause. However many worlds rimward of
Saell which had secured economic ties with worlds around Saell, would
not rally to Rukh, so they established Gnoerrgh Rukh Lloell. In the
beginning they did not manage to do much damage to the Rukh Aegz, but in
the latest 10 years several worlds spinward of Saell have pulled out of
the Aegz, when it proved unable to protect the worlds against terrorist
acts and other anti-Rukh operations.  It disappeared as a political
entity in 1123 when Rukh attacked. The war was over in matter of months,
but the mopping up took more than a year. Anti-Rukh managed to deal some
heavy blows to Rukh even when they was outnumbered 15 to one. The reason
for this was the deep undercover groups inside Rukh.


Kfan Uzangou: A periodical newsletter which are distributed through out
the Gvurrdon sector. The newsletter released its first issue in 864
(Imperial). The newsletter fresh and boasting reports soon got popular
in other systems, so that the print had to be increased. In 987 the
format changed from paper to cheap microchip format, which then could be
accessed by most computers. The paper format have not disappeared
totally, but the print is just 4% of total distribution. Kfan Uzangou
(White Fangs) has its main office at Gvurrdon (0821).  In 1127 the
magazine started to distribute to Spinward Marches. However as the treat
from the Virus became apparent, Regency put down a blockade. KU couldn\'t
change to paper format, when this would sky rocket the distribution
cost. KU took then contact with one of the small media distributors of
Spinward Marches, called Spinward Media Expression (SME). They would get
the text on optical readable microfilm, while the interior art and
pictures would be put on ordinary dias. SME would then put the magazine
on holocrystals, or in paper print. In Regency the magazine is
distributed on the Galanglic name White Fangs.


Oulaekho Arms: A weapon producer with its main office and production
plant on Saell. It sells weapons to most worlds in Gvurrdon. The Firm do
also have several subsidaries  around the Spinward part of Gvurrdon.
Gvaeknoks do also have a share in their weapon production plant on
Ghenkerongolu (Gvurrdon 1528). This plant is called Dokhoullae.


Pandrin: (Gvurrdon 2240). This system were the former Oberlindes trading
center for the Gvurrdon sector. But when the Kedzudh invaded the world
in late 1118 Oberlindes had to close down the center and move it to
somewhere else.  Oberlindes has made it clear that they are looking into
reopening their old base here. Local investors are apparently doing
their part to ensure that Oberlindes comes back.


Sibiatl: A minor psionic institute in Gvurrdon. It does not have any
fixed base, when it changes location time to time. The Sibiatl are a
cooperation between the Zhodani and Vargr psionics to broaden the
knowledge of psionics among Vargr in the in the spinward part of
Gvurrdon sector. In addition to teach psionics it gives classes on just
general information.

REFEREE: The Sibiatl are well reputed among the Vargr in the Thirz
Empire. The psionic training courses cost approximate 240,000Cr. and
takes about 5 months. Initial testing cost 12000 credits. An information
course cost 2000 credits, and is held 5 days with 2 hours a day.


Soungadano (Gvurrdon 2414) B671363-A  Lo Ni: Soungadano is a former
prison planet for Thoengling Empire. Some still view it as a prison
planet when some criminals have the choice between selecting a ordinary
sentence or try to re-install their charisma on this planet by working
for a living. The climate is harsh with temperatures above 300M-0C. In the
winter the temperature may sink below -46M-0C. These severe swings in
temperature makes it a dangerous place to live. There is frequently
storms that can easily kill an unwary traveller. The main exports s
compounds and crystals. Animals both dead and alive is also an export
article, buut not a very popular one. The world has been isolated since
the Virus struck. So how the conditions is on the planet at present is
unknown.


Spinward Assembly, The: A crisis council which was established by the
initiative of Archduke Norris in 1132 to coordinate knowledge and
operations in how to fight the Virus. Its presence (The Assembly) has
been quite visible in Gvurrdon, as the Vargr has proven unable to dam up
against the Virus effectively. only in the few latter 20 years that the
Vargr has managed to get on top of the situation by quarantine
restrictions. The assembly got the following members: Regency, Zhodani
Consulate, Aslan Hierate, Thirz Empire, Society of Equals, Thoengling
Empire. In addition several smaller states has observer status in this
assembly. If and when a thrust into the infected areas are going to take
place, this assembly will surely have a hand in the game.


Taknarkag: (Gvurrdon 0630 B370467-A Ni De). This is a single city
planet, which by influence from Goerrg Rukh Lloell (Anti-Rukh
coalition), left the Rukh Aegz alliance. The entire population resides
in a city built only over the last 185 years, by the design of the
famous Vargr architect Voronol. Taknarkag was reputed in the Rukh Aegz
for it brilliant architectural design. Even Humans have copied this city
to an extent. Humans will find the Trading Post bar and nightclub
inviting, when this is designed specially for humans in mind. More
daring humans, or humans which have experience with Vargr clientele and
behavior may use the Kornak Lounge. The navy base are now staffed by the
local militia with a few jump capable ships.


TeeBee (Toothless Bastard [expr, org: re]): An curse originally from
Regency. It was first used against those Vargr that worked as crew on
infected starships. Those Vargr are generally of low Charisma, thus not
very desireable by other Vargr as followers. Used against other Vargr
will certainly spell trouble. The Virus has by itself no Charsima, and
thus no appeal to the common Vargr, but those who are in their employ
voluntarily or not.


The Equality War: This war were fought between the Society of Equals and
Thirz Empire. The war raged from 1111 to 1116. In this war Society of
Equals lost much territory. Society of Equals did also lose their
capitol system, Dzuerongvae (1413), but the rulers managed to escape.
This forced the Society of equals to move the capitol. The new capitol
is now at Taeksoudhanou (1623).


The Glass bond: The alliance between Kedzudh Aeng and Kforuzeng corsair
band were called the Glass Bond, when it appeared fragile when the
allegiance first were signed. However the success the allegiance have
earned in the invasion of The Spinward Marches have apparently
strengthened this allegiance. Imperial analysts speculate that the
allegiance may fall apart now that the forces to Norris have been able
to stop the constant advance of the Vargr. The Glass Bond broke up in
1129, when Kedzudh declared that the campaign in Spinward Marches was a
success, and that further action was not desirable.


Therrg\'s First Reasoning: Therrg is one of the representatives of "The
Spinward Assembly", and represents Thirz Empire. He do also have
connections with Church of the Chosen One. He had a reasoning that has
been quoted to the lenght that it has become a cliche. "If the Virus is
intelligent, why do we then curse It for Its acts that every intelligent
lifeforms has shown a inclination for? Of course because we all bash our
friends head in every now and then does not make Its (Virus) acts more
tolerable. It only explains the entropy of the universe."
Therrg\'s Second Reasoning: "That day the computer talks to me I\'ll throw
it out of the window."
Cptn L. A. Slastinger\'s addition: "Has anyone told him that his office
is underground?"


Thirz Empire: The second largest interstellar state in Gvurrdon. It got
close bonds with Zhodani,and the presence of psi capable vargr here is
large. About 12% off all inhabitants here have been tested and/or
trained. The entire state are viewed as a large client state of Zhodani
by others in Gvurrdon. Zhodani have a large contigent of both military
and economical advisors in this state. The reason to this is that the
Zhodani by its close relationship with the government can limit the
number on corsair raids inside their borders.


Tirrils: An avian alien race native to Tirrokoelaeks (Gvurrdon 1821).
The Tirrils lives at TL 0. Which would classify them as barely sentient.
The Vargr which first took contact with them, hunted them for their fine
feather hide. But when it became evident that the birds were sentient,
all hunting ceased. The Tirrils are protected from hunting. Any killing
of a Tirril for their hide is penalized with death. The Tirrils are
about 150 centimeter high, and got bright colors from blood red to deep
navy blue. The chest and abdomen are generally white or silver grey.
They got a 15 centimeter long beak like a gull and powerful claws they
use to dig in the earth for Lummi roots or insects. What\'s curious about
the Tirrils are that they have excellent mathematical knowledge. Some
are so good that they can calculate the jump coordinates and data for a
distances up to one parsec without the aid of a computer. Some Vargr
merchants use Tirrils onboard their vessels for entertainment and for
their excellent mathematical skill. The language of the Tirrils are
consisting of whistling and body posture. Very few have been able to
learn their language without specific aiding tools as flutes. Those who
have been most successful with learning their language have usually good
musical skill. Most humans may be able to do basic communication with
just whistling with their lips. Vargr have proven unable to communicate
without flutes or language computers. Tirrils can with great difficulty
learn some Vargr languages. But human languages are easier for them to
learn. This is due to the specific development of their vocal cords.
Tirrils are popular on Tirrokoelaegz for their beautiful sing song
skills, and are often employed at taverns and inns for entertainment.
When the Tirrils are lacking manipulators they usually do not wear
clothes or use tools. However a few Vargr corporations have built waldos
that the Tirrils may use. However few do make use of the waldos when
they constrain them from flying.


Tongaesodhongaell massacre: During the Equality war
Tongaesodhongaell/Gvurrdon (1015) were heavily attacked by nuclear and
chemical weapons. Most of those who could not afford the overpriced
tickets out of the system before the attacking fleet reached the world,
got killed in the attack.The world are Interdicted by the Thirz Empire
because of the high radiation level. The world is still interdicted for
reasons unknown. There has also been a number of voices that demand that
the ancestors of the survivors are to be evacuated, but the Thirz Empire
don\'t want to for some reason.


Ukekhaedha: Ukekhaedha which can be translated to: Ritual of Charismatic
honor. This is a duel fought to death. The ritual have its roots from
Fukoezo (Gvurrdon 2702). The ritual have been law regulated the latest
since early 900. This has been done so that the number of duels to the
death was not to going to deplete populace of males, which are the only
gender which can do this ritual. To perform the ritual the offended part
must get approval from the court to do so. If the court finds the
offended part got good reason to re- install his charisma, the ritual is
permitted. However the requester get one week to cool off to see if he
changes his mind.

The ritual is performed like this:
Firstly the combatants undress completely, and donn loincloths. Both get
a gun with one poison dart. The combatants then selects how far from
each other they will stand. The closest range permitted are 7 meters and
21 meters at most. The guns are holstered when the ritual really starts.
First the Oenurzksan (the patient wait) starts. Here the two combatants
tries out wait each other. Sometimes one of the combatants chicken out
and wont go through with the ritual. Longer the wait more Charisma will
the offended part get back, if he wins the duel. He will also get back
more charisma if he is the last to draw the gun to shot when the action
starts. Some even waits until the other one has fired his gun before he
fires his own. If both miss their shots, the duel is ended and the
offended part cannot make another try. If the offender survives he will
not get any benefit than his life. If the offended part survives he may
get back all the charisma depending on how long the wait was and how he
performed overall. If both parts die, the duel is noted as an unresolved
matter and the case is closed. To be permitted to do this type of duel,
you must have experienced a major loss of charisma and economical loss.
Off worlders cannot under any circumstances perform this ritual in a
legal way. There have been some cases where humans have been performing
this ritual illegally, when they have offended a Vargr.


Urukhu: (nation of Urukhu). A former Interstellar empire which consisted
of the following systems: 2806  Ukokhuvoen, 2807  Kaekfesa, 2808
Dorrorue, 2908  Kutsgarrae, 3107  Ozago.

After Urukhu died in 1112 the nation started to collapse. The nation
were on its highest at 1103, when they managed to fend off a attack from
the Thoengling Empire. However the war effort did take its toll on the
Urukhu nation. Urukhu died in an assassination attempt at an age of 54
years. Who which are responsible for the act are unknown, but the Lliegz
corsair band are suspected. The Lliegz band tried to establish two bases
in the nation just after the war with the Thoengling empire. Urukhu
would not have them there, and the constant battle with the corsairs
depleted the limited naval forces even more. The Lliengz corsair band
were splintered in 1116 by internal disputes.


Uthith Fleet: Fleet of the Ekhlle Ksafi (40th squadron) based at Uthith
(Gvurrdon 1738). During the FFW, it occupied Yorbund (Spinward Marches
2403) and Heya (Spinward Marches 2402), but did not press further,
spending much time mopping up and consolidating. After the Gireel Fleet
was destroyed destroyed at beck\'s World, the Imperial 212nd fleet forces
Uthith back. On 252-1109, Admiral Thuekhs negotiated a separate peace
and withdrew the Uthith fleet from Regina subsector. Many vargr veterans
of the heyan occupation commonly have souvenirs, particulary bottles of
fine Heyan liquors.

When the Oekhos tirades, presented through a Vargr entertainment device
called Utovogh wass released. These devices became increasingly popular
in the Ve Ekhlle Ksafi space. Several voices started to demand action
against the Imperials for the defeat during the FFW. However nothing has
happened when the fleet to Ve Ekhlle was virtually non-existent. The
40th squadron did built a lot of new ships in the period 1123 to 1170.
The number of ships quadrupled. This seems much, but when the fleet only
consisted of a handfull of light cruisers, that was bearably
serviceable, the build- up wasn\'t considered a threat by Regency.
However Regency do keep an eye out for trouble.


Voronol Knaergh: (925-1005 Imperial). Famous Vargr architect. He have
designed many buildings in the Rukh Aegz alliance. His pride are the
Taknarkag city, which he used 10 years in drawing. Unfortunately he did
not live long enough to se the first stages of the city being completed.


Wolfpack: A group of infected Vargr ships. As pre-virus vargr starships
was quite low on maintained standard, Vargr ships that has been infected
has their best strenght when they operate in numbers. The onset of the
Virus forced dthe vargr governments to set up stricter standards to
starships. Something that made a post Virus starships more able to
withstand a Virus infection. And also to battle them in a space combat
as their equipment standards are higher than infected crafts.

The groups of Gvurrdon as per 1200 Imperial.

Gvurrdon is filled with different political factions and groups. All got
their own agenda, and goals for the future. This makes it and different
place than most other sectors in charted space. The different outside
groups as Zhodani and Regency add to the confusion. The alliances among
the groups are also difficult to understand at times.

Allez: Remnants of the old Rukh alliance. The Rukh party tried to hold
off long as possible, but when the break did come, they lost all
control. After several years of internal fighting, a loose group of
aristocrat managed to get some kind of control. The alliance  is now
ruled by the aristocrats, but the worlds got some self rule to a limit.
They might not pass new laws without the Allez government gives them
permission to do so. They have over the last years worked with improve
their relations to the surrounding factions, among those Regency.
Zhodani already got an embassy here, from the time Rukh existed.

Church of the Chosen One: This quasi-religious sect has been diminishing
the last 50 years. During the Rebellion, and shortly after it
registrated a small increse in popularity, but the advent of the Virus
changed the opinions again. As a result of this they have closed most of
their centers, turning their resources into finding the Ancients, to
prove once and for all that the Vargr is meant to inherit the universe
after the Ancients.

Dzen Aeng Kho (Society of Equals): A military ruled society, where the
citizens must be rated Equal before they can get voting status, or enter
certain careers. To get rated as Equal the citizen must go through a
test, which can be dangerous. This test is taken at age 16 usually, but
it can be taken later. Non-Equal citizens that did not make the test
might be rated Equal later if they perform excellent in their line of
duty. And this is usually in the military services. SoE do also keep
slaves, but they may not be mistreated.

Gvaeknoks Trade Union: Formed in 1172 when Gvaeknoks got fed up by the
trading difficulties between Thirz Empire, and Society of Equals (SoE).
A new base had to be found. The break up of Rukh gave the right
opportunity to establish a base where Gvaeknoks could keep a political
presence without losing control. The Gvaeknoks Trade Union (GTU) was
formed short after. Gvaeknoks holds the control over the interstellar
government, but the worlds themselves maintain their own government.
Gvaeknoks got even more popular as it invested in different projects to
build up the local economy. Thus Gvaeknoks can buy cheap and sell
expensive to worlds outside GTU.

Kedzudh Aeng: Formed originally to hold corsairs at bay, but formed the
Glass Bond alliance with Kforuzeng in 1116-17. Imperial analysts
concluded that this bond wouldn\'t hold for long, but they were wrong.
After the campaign in Spinward Marches was finished, Kforuzeng started
to look for new markets. Kedzudh worked for improving its relations to
Regency. Kedzudh are still a loose alliance, with the worlds handling
their foreign policy on their own. Only the near presence of the virus
do keep them together today.

Noerrgh Confederate: A dissident group lead by Noerrgh started to get
popular in 1178. By two years it has spread to near lying worlds.
Noerrgh wanted to disband the monarchy of Thirz Empire, but the Royal
Thir Family resisted. Armed conflict broke out, but an armistice was
reached in 1182. Noerrgh Confederate is actually a wobbly alliance. They
don\'t seem to manage to agree on a single item. The only reason that it
still exist might be that Zhodani got some control, with help of Thirz
Empire, over the group. Why Thirz has not moved in and taken control is
not known.

Oberlindes Lines: A Spinward Marches based trade company. They are maybe
the best traders in the sector, not counting Gvaeknoks. As the peace has
been spreading through the rimward reaches of Gvurrdon Oberlindes are
looking into reopening their base at Triad, that got closed in 1117.
Further expansion into Gvurrdon are also planned, but there is a few
problems. Kforuzeng got quite a presence in the rimward portion.
Economic analysts just wait on the day that Emissary the Oberlindes
trade cruiser will clash with the light cruiser of Kforuzeng, Ozarr.
Gvaeknoks do also close their borders for Oberlindes, making a coreward
expansion difficult.

Regency: Doesn\'t have any direct presence in Gvurrdon, but keeps
emissaries around in the different groups to know what is happening.
They got best relations with Thoengling and Rueks Legacy. The relations
to Kedzudh and Ve Ekhlle Ksafi are also softening up.

Rroerz Uerra: This is actually what is left of Anti-Rukh coalition. When
the Rukh war was over, these worlds rebuilt their society. Helped by a
Zhodani backed Rroerz political party. The Zhodani presence has been
fading the last few years, but still there.

Rueks Legacy: One of the splinter groups of old Rukh. they hold a small
base, and try to stay out of trouble. To protect their worlds, they have
hired ships from 40th squadron. Repeating raids from Corsair\'s Den saw
to this.

The Freedom League: Also called Corsair\'s Den by outsiders. Kforuzeng
has control over this alliance, even on local world government level.
However not full control. Kforuzeng tried to take full control, but
found it too difficult, and that they could loose Charisma on it.
However after Kforuzeng took over the situation on the worlds became
actually better. Many corsair groups sought to Kforuzeng after this.
Corsairs that visit this place can come and go as they like, far as they
do not break any rules here. No one asks questions where the wares comes
from. The trade taxes are also quite low.

Thirz Uerra: An Interstellar Monarchy formed with the help of Zhodani.
The worlds got independence in that way that they can choose their own
local government, but the monarchy with its appointed governors do the
interstellar policy. This part of Gvurrdon holds a large percentage of
the Psionic capable Vargr. They fought the Equality war against SoE from
1111 to 1116. Where upon SoE lost much territory. It maintains good
relations to most factions in Gvurrdon, excepted for SoE, where a cold
war status is at hand.

Thoengling Raghz: Has always had good relations with the Empire, and
continue to nurture this through Regency. It is maybe the interstellar
state that has suffered most from the Virus. First they managed to keep
it at bay, but a breakthrough forced the Thoengling Navy to withdraw.
The Capital was lost in matter of weeks. Now there is only a handful
worlds left from this state, which once was the biggest is Gvurrdon.

Ve Ekhlle Ksafi (40th Sqr): One of the alliances that participated in
the FFW against the Imperium in 1107 to 1110. The government is a strict
military rule, but the individual worlds has gotten more to say the
latest years. The reason for this might be by the pressure from Regency
because of the Virus. Ve Ekhlle Ksafi doesn\'t like Regency much, but it
is not strong enough to make a dent in Regency\'s armor. The fleet
capability of Ve Ekhlle Ksafi has been built up over the years, but
still small compared to other groups.

Zhodani: Their aims for the Gvurrdon sector has changed over the years.
As their long time allied Rukh disappeared, Zhodani had to move in with
force to prevent that Zhodani owned industry didn\'t get caught in the
middle. However they was not able to prevent that Rukh broke up, maybe
for the best. As Zhodani sought after to control the groups along their
border to keep them safe, it got easier now that the tension in this
area of space loosened. It did also get easier to deal with the
different worlds after Rukh disappeared. Zhodani has opened quite a lot
of trade missions in Gvurrdon the latter 20 years.

d Xienners can\'t shape change at all.

This shape change would have made them perfect soldiers, but they are
friendly and peaceful. Their culture is closely related to the nature,
even for their high technology. Killing can only be done in necessity.
This has made them the perfect diplomats, which are sought after in
Gvurrdon and surrounding areas. Another feature is the total lack if
Psionics. They can\'t utilize psionics at all, and try to mindread them
is futile.


Tirril

An avian alien race. The Tirrils lives at TL 0. Which would classify
them as barely sentient. The Vargr which first took contact with them,
hunted them for their fine feather hide. But when it became evident that
the birds were sentient, all hunting ceased. The Tirrils are protected
from hunting. Any killing of a Tirril for their hide is penalized with
death.

The Tirrils are about 150 centimetre high, and got bright colors from
blood red to deep navy blue. The chest and abdomen are generally white
or silver grey. They got a 15 centimetre long beak like a gull and
powerful claws they use to dig in the earth for Lummi roots or insects.

What\'s curious about the Tirrils are that they have excellent
mathematical knowledge. Some are so good that they can calculate the
jump coordinates and data for a distances up to one parsec without the
aid of a computer. Some Vargr merchants use Tirrils onboard their
vessels for entertainment and for their excellent mathematical skill.

Tirrils are popular in various parts of Gvurrdon for their beautiful
sing song skills, and are often employed at taverns and inns for
entertainment.

When the Tirrils are lacking manipulators they usually do not wear
clothes or use tools. However a few Vargr corporations have built waldos
that the Tirrils may use. However few do make use of the waldos when
they constrain them from flying.


Ungrest

This race descend from a desert dwelling carnivore. It got a thick hide,
almost chitin like in substance. They are somewhat hunched. When rolled
up they are totally hidden behind their shell like back, which gives
them very good protection. Their appearance is almost insect like, which
can scare the hell out of unwary travellers. They are quite small and
stocky, but not clumsy, even when they may seem like it. Even before the
Vargr contacted this race, they had acquired tech enough to start a
space programme. The first contact with Vargr, and Humans accelerated
this process.

They claim to have developed jumpdrive on their own, but this has not
been confirmed. However they are not able to use the jump technology to
its fullest. So in this field they are still on tech 9. The reason for
this is that the Ungrest can\'t survive the jump for some strange reason.
But the Ungrest do use so called unmanned jump launches, which actually
are crafts rangingfrom 100 to 300 ton. These are used to move supplies
fast through the system, and to the neighbouring system that they have
started to colonize. The Ungrest move through interstellar space with
SLD ships, powered by a ram scope.

The Ungrest is quite aggressive, but not outright hostile. Various
merchants do trade with them, but any technology is unavailable, when it
is much specified for the race. And the Ungrest is unwilling to sell out
technology to inferior traders. This might stem from a paranoia that
they are afraid of that the tech might be turned against them. However
there is possible to buy lot of other non- technical stuff like
foodstuffs, and art.


Bzruellokh

This race stems from an world which are quite chilly, which explains
their heavy built due to insulating fat. Descendants from
omnivore/gatherers which evolved on the great steppes of this planet.
They are massing about 95kg, the females a bit less. Their legs are
short with broad feet, that prevents them from sinking too deep into the
snow. Their early forefathers had quite a lot of body hair, which
disappeared when the Bzruellokh started using clothing to protect them
further from the chill. Their arms are long, reaching down to the knees
when they stand upright, and powerful. Their skin resembles that of a
human, but is rougher and thicker. The skin color ranges from white to
yellowish. Their arms and head is covered with thick white hair. The
face holds two small eyes which are set deep into the skull. The ears
resembles that of a rabbit, but is a bit broader.

>From what is usual among other races, Bzruellokh does have a peculiar
rhythm. Their pre-sentient ancestors hibernated during the winter,
gathering food in the summer. Thus they almost never sleep half of their
local year. In a modern society this is quite difficult, but this
hibernating are still being done. But the cycles are more controlled, so
that their society still works, even in the winter. Their starships got
special hibernation modules, for crew or owners that are due for they
hibernation cycle. The fact is that the Bzruellokh gets sick if it can\'t
hibernate over certain period. Drugs can prolong the wake time between
hibernation, but are used sparingly.


Opliaraz

Descendants from omnivore scavengers that was cave dwellers. The latter
has given them sight that spans from visible light to the infrared
spectrum. They got large black eyes. Matter of fact the pupils are the
only part of the eye visible. Their size is small compared to humans,
with an average height of 145cm. They got bat like ears that can be
moved towards a sound. This coupled with their wide field of vision,
that is 220 degrees gives them a superior surveillance capability
compared to most other sentient races.

Their society is built around the family, which forms a clan. When the
Vargr contacted these the first time, they were hunted for their fur.
Even when they had advanced into the iron age. This hunting was stopped
some hundred years ago, by a group of resourceful explorers. However the
Opliaraz is still xenophobic about outsiders. Those who wants to do
business in this system should do it through the Aelluengh Mercantile
Company, which is the only company the Opliaraz will trade with. The
reason for this is that the Aelluengh is owned by the ancestors of those
who helped the Opliaraz from extinction.

Gvurrdon Sector codes, and UWP codes.



Gvurrdon subsectors has no official names in the Vargr extends, but they
are named by the Imperial IISS for the
purpose of easy reference to a given part of the space. Thus most
subsectors in Gvurrdon has been given the
names of leading Vargr consentration in the subsector (if known). Given
the strange behavior of the Vargr, some
of these subsectors may have other rulers  now than then, when the names
were thought up.  The exception of this
rule are those sub sectors that borders to the Regency, where the old
Imperial mapping standards are more
common.

The sub sector names are:

Sorry for the heavy quoting but I think this provides a great opportunity
to examine just how the Traveller government codes might be improved so
that they are less arbitrary and therefore more useful.

I\'ve mentioned this before but, IMHO, it is uesful when examining a
government type to look at two issues: the *nature* of authority (who
rules) and the *source* of authority (who consents to that rule, or
who *is* ruled).

The keys here from a definition standpoint are the two suffixes *-archy*
and *-cracy*.  These are often used interchangeably to mean "rule".  They
are sometimes used to mean the same thing as in "monarchy" and "autocracy"
which are often seen as meaning "single or self rule".  Generally though,
the suffix *-archy" is used to denote a ruler or a system of rulers
("matriarch", "hierarchy") while the suffix *-cracy* is used to denote
the source of rule ("technocracy", "aristocracy", "theocracy").

It is useful to look at the distinction between the two suffixes when they
are used with the same prefix, say, "demarchy" and "democracy".  Demarchy
is used to distinguish actual, direct rule by the people, or *demos*, (through
referrenda and the like) as opposed to democratic rule based merely upon
the *consent* of the people in which actual authority may be placed in the
hands of some representative group or person.

When viewed in this fashion the *nature* of authority can have only three
manifestations: a single ruler (autarchy), a group of rulers (oligarchy),
or rule by the entire *demos* (demarchy).  Similarly, the *source* of
authority has only two manifestations: either it comes from the ruler(s)
themselves (autocracy) or else it is based upon the consent of the *demos*
(democracy).

This gives the following five government types:

- -Autocractic autarchy: rule by a single individual without *any* consent
  of the governed group.  Obviously this can only occur in *very* small
  groups where the `ruler\' is able to exercise direct, personal control
  over the `ruled\', say, a parent-child relationship or a captor-prisoner
  relationship.
- -Autocractic oligarchy: rule by a group of individuals without any consent
  of the governed group.  Again, this can only occur in small groups where
  the `rulers\' can exercise direct, personal control over the `ruled\', say
  bankrobbers holding bank employees hostage.
- -Democractic autarchy: rule by a single individual based upon the consent
  of the governed.  This fits our conceptions of a `traditional\' monarchy
  but actually it also can only occur over relatively small groups, say
  a company or a small military organization.  (It\'s how Jean-Luc Picard
  rules the starship *Enterprise*.)
- -Democractic oligarchy: rule by a group of individuals based upon the
  consent of the governed.  This permits the rule of large groups such as
  modern nation states.  In this case, the rulers are not just the exective
  and legislative figures at the top of the government but the entire system
  or regulators, tax collectors, police enforcers, etc. that exercise
  authority in the `government\'.  This form may sometimes be very oppressive
  (the Iranian `theocracy\' came to power in a popular revolt and continues
  to enjoy a great deal of consent among a majority of the *demos*) but it
  is unable to continue once the consent of the *demos* is lost (hence
  the collapse of the Soviet Union).
- -Demarchy (democractic demarchy is redundant): direct rule by the *demos*.
  This is very difficult to accomplsh on a large scale but is facilitated
  by the advent of high technology which permits quick and broad disemination
  of information.  (Imagine a instantaneous global communications network
  that would permit `real time\' discussion and voting on governmental issues.)

In the Earth Colonies campaign we have developed the following table to
generate UWP government codes using this scheme:

Government (Throw 2D-5 + pop)
Digit   Government
0-  none
1   autocratic autarchy
2   demarchy
3   autocratic oligarchy
4-6 democratic oligarchy
7   no central authority
8-9 democratic oligarchy
A-B democratic autarchy
C+  democratic oligarchy

Higher population worlds almost exclusive have `democractic\' governments
because of the inability of any single individual or group of individuals
to directly, personally exercise authority over the rest of the populace.

This system leaves the actual characterization of the populace\'s consent
to authority up to the referee (or at least independent of population).
A Code C `democractic oligarchy\' may be a "theocracy", a "technocracy",
a "plutocracy", or a `representative democracy\'.  Which seems to make
sense since there is no clear relationship between these sorts of charcteri-
zations and the *size* of the particular *demos* involved.

Observations, questions and contrary views are solicited and encouraged.

I\'m sorry you think so. I haven\'t felt acrimonious in this debate (until

impression.

If you\'re really prepared to argue that all the population levels and
population multipliers in the Spinward Marches could possibly remain intact
for 15 years of peaceful development, much less Vargr raids galore, then
I\'m dropping out of that discussion. Think about what you\'re saying for
just a moment. No world increased it\'s population by as much as 10%? No
world lost as much as 10% in a raid? They all remained at _exactly_ the
same population? Every single one of them?

You don\'t need TNE. I\'m talking CT and MegaT. I\'ve ignored TNE because I
anticipated the argument that the years from 1120 to 1200 represent rather
unusual circumstances.

There\'s no way all 400 worlds in the Spinward Marches could have had their
population level totally stagnant for 15 years. some of them, sure. Not
even most of them, but some. Since the data in _Imperial Encyclopedia_
and _Megatraveller JOurnal 3_ dosen\'t show these changes, the data on
population must derive from the same census. Perhaps no new census was
made between 1105 and 1120. Other parts of the UPP may have been updated.
But as far as the population data goes, the three sources is one and the
same.

Good for you. I can\'t. Not for the Marches, whose culture in most every
Traveller publication to date has been shown to be overwhelmingly solomani-
style, and certainly not for the Sword Worlds who are spcifically _said_
to be Solomani-derived.

Sure. That\'s propably why we haven\'t seen any technological downturns in
the wake of economic downturns here on Earth. I admit that there will be
a cushioning effect so that you could propably maintain TL B for a while,
since the investment in the factories and tools have been made. But
factories have to be maintained too. And if noone can afford to buy the
stuff the factories produce, why maintain them? And how? Try imagining
economic boom cycles scaled to an interplanetary population, rather than
a single planet population. If a depression is severe enough, the
factories will close.

How severe? That\'s the whole point, isn\'t it? A planet with billions of
inhabitants may be difficult to affect... but maybe not too dificult if
you have even more billions of people to do it.

Recall that our only

Seems to me I\'ve heard about factories in third-world countries that have
closed down after the parent company has pulled out. Admittedly I can\'t
quote any examples.

Has anyone else noticed that X-ray lasers are even deadlier for their size if
gravitic focusing is not used.  The effective range on a TL13+ X-ray laser
barbette is 15 hexes, without using gravitic focusing.  This isn\'t all that
bad.  The big advantage is that it has an 85% efficiency (at TL15), instead
of 20%.  The biggest thing in the turret is the HPG, so a much higher energy
can be reached with the higher efficiency.

Here is a TL15 X-ray laser barbette design.  It isn\'t manned.

Energy 1400MJ.  Input energy 1650MJ.

Focal Array     22.4 tons   22.4 kl     4.48 MCr
HPG         15.5 tons   57.75 kl    .5775 MCr
Beam Pointer (10 Hex)   3 tons      3 kl        .3 MCr

This totals 140.9 tons, 83.15 kl, 5.3575 MCr.  At 100 shots per turn it draws
92 MW. Combat performance is as follows:

10: 94-1/30 20: 70-1/22 40: 35-1/11 80: 18-1/6

This has better performance at short and medium range than Roger Myhre\'s design
(6/11, message 7956) of a 423 MJ TL15 gravitically focused, unmanned barbette,
which had 51-1/16 out to 80 hexes.  It has much better performance at these
ranges than the Brilliant Lances designs.  If you are willing to sacrifice long
range performance, leave out the gravitic focusing and use X-ray lasers.

In response to Roger Myhre\'s discussion of antimatter missiles:

Warheads for antimatter missiles wouldn\'t be all that small.  If you wanted a
non-impact warhead that could actually damage a ship, it would have to be
pretty large.  assuming we can get a missile within 100 km of the target, this
is 10e7 cm.  the energy per cm^2 is about 10e-15 of the blast energy at this
range.  To do one point of damage to a square cm, going by the FF&S guideline
that the effective range of a laser is where the energy is distributed over a
square cm, we need to deliver about a megajoule to a square cm, requiring on
the order of a megaton (1 megaton = 4.2e15 Joules).  This requires about 50
grams of antimatter, and it still has no hope of penetrating armor.  it could
damage surface features, but the energy would probably be too diffuse to do
much.  if a spot on a surface feature can withstand a 1 MJ laser easily, all a
1 megaton blast is going to do is lightly toast the outside of the ship.  :)

Either a much bigger warhead is needed, or the missile needs to get closer.
The consensus seems to be that impact missiles would be shot down easily.
Signifcant damage might be done by a warhead in the tens or hundreds of
megatons, but that would require more than a kg of antimatter.  manufacturing
the stuff isn\'t exactly easy...  Well the warhead is pretty small, if you want
to waste all that antimatter in a marginal weapon.

 Others?

SUBSECTOR MAPS AND UWP DATA

I would suggest a typical subsector on each of the Regency frontiers: the
Zhodani frontier (Jewell), the Vargr frontier (Regina, Aramis, or Pretoria),
the Virus frontier (Lamas, Dunmag or Usani) and the Aslan *ihatei* frontier
(Tobia, Gazulin, Pax Rulin or Glisten).  The capital subsector, Mora, would
be representative of the Regency \'core\'.  Maybe a subsector in the Deneb Wilds?

Let\'s follow the *Path of Tears* format with Imperial Era (IE) and Post-
Imperial Era (PIE) UWP stats.

MAJOR WORLDS OF THE REGENCY

Major worlds ought to be Mora/Mora, Deneb/Usani, Gazulin/Gazulin,
Regina/Regina, Rhylanor/Rhylanor, Glisten/Glisten, Lintl/Vestus,
Pretoria/Pretoria, Magash/Sabine, Vincennes/Vincennes and Lunion/Lunion.

Any other candidates?

REGENCY LANGUAGE

Anyone care to offer a few examples of Riftian jargon after 70 years of
divergence from Galanglic?

REGENCY MEGACORPS

Delgado Trading (miniturization, heavy mining & refining, publishing and
   trading)
- -A key player in the war against the Virus.

General Products (starships, non-starships, heavy machinery)
- -Quality problems were threatening existence by Rebellion.  Domain/Regency
 susbsidies would be likely in order to maintain a major shipbuilder (cf.
 the Chrysler bailout).

>Now on to the question of feudal technocracy.

This is where I\'m tempted to become a tad acrimonious. I\'ll try to hold
it down, but it\'s a little hard to provide definitions of what I\'m
talking about and then having them dismissed as "not relevant". If you
have any authorities on feudal Europe that informs you that the feudal
lords didn\'t really care about formalities, could you quote them for
me, please? If you can\'t, don\'t you think you just might consider the
possibility that the old feudal system actually worked in some way
at least remotely related to the teory?

Even if you are right, for which you presented absolutely no evidence, it\'s
also possible that if someone looked at a new type of government and called
it \'feudal\' something, they might be having dictionary definitions in mind
too.

Because a feudal society is one where the feudal lord gives out land fiefs
in return for allegiance and support. By analogy a feudal technocracy is
one where the lord gives out industrial fiefs in support for allegiance
and support. Gee, I could have sworn I said this before.

>>Let\'s get a few definitions

>What I get from your emphasis on these defintions is a focus on *land*.

That\'s great. That means you got half my argument. These definitions
focus on land because that\'s what the people in feudal Europe focused
on. The second half of my argument substitutes industrial holdings for
land in order to derive a definition of a feudal _technocracy_ and assumes
an analogous treatment of those holdings.

>Is that where our disagreement lies?  I grant the `ownership of land\' by

That seems to be the problem in a nutshell. You don\'t see it. Why? What do
you know that I don\'t? From where do you derive your deep insight into how
feudal Europe REALLY worked? Tell me what books I\'ve missed.

>The key part of the lord\'s end of the feudal

Is this something you just know? Who told you? Not the dictionary. Did
you read it in a book? Quotes, please.

I just don\'t see how the shareholders in your description of a feudal
technocracy acts any different from the shareholders in any other
system with corporations. The standard capitalist society, for example.
Where does the feudal come into it?

>>>In a feudal technocracy there are several *different*

How? Why? They elected him (well 51+% of them did). They can fire him any
time they want to. Legally. They employ him. Where\'s the fealthy in that?

>This is akin to a medieval situation in which a single individual had risen
>to the top of the feudal structure, a king.

The king\'s vassals have all sworn to support him. Did the shareholders
swear to support their Chairman? No. They offered him a good salary and
a pension plan. Not fealthy.

>Maybe the difference here is that you\'re looking at, say, Gram,
>as medieval Germany, while I\'m at looking the entire Sword Worlds as all of
>medieval Europe?

At the moment I\'m not looking at the Sword worlds at all. I\'m looking at
the whole concept of feudal technocracy. Of which I have several times
said: "By analogy, a feudal technocracy is one where industrial holdings
takes the place of land". I then presented a definition of a feudal
society. Let\'s have your definitions. Not examples, since I\'m apparently
to dim to understand them. Straight definitions.

>>And a vassal does what his liege lord says or he is \'fired\'.

Take an early feudal society. See a knight who holds a manor from a baron.
See him give two fingers to his baron. See his baron take his (the baron\'s)
manor back from the knight and decorate the gate with the knight\'s head.

Why do you maintain that? What facts do you base this on? How come you
know more than the dictionary (Not just a snide question. Dictionaries
have been known to be wrong. But I do feel that the burden of proof is
on you in this case. Why do you think feudal society differed so
radically in theory and practice? Let\'s have some reasons).

Oh, are you? That means that you can quote me reams of examples of how
things really worked in practice, while I won\'t be able to find very
many examples of thing working according to the mere theory, right?
Would you care to begin?

>I think my focus is more useful in trying to

>feudal technocracy of Traveller.

I will tentatively agree that this seems reasonable. Ignoring for the
moment the possibility that \'feudal technocracy\' is defined in terms
of the theory of feudal society instead of the practice. So let\'s hear
about this practice.

>>Look, the shareholders in a corporation is a conglomerate owner.
>
>No.  The shareholders are a morass of different interests just like the
>various vassals of a medieval lord.

The shareholders of a corporation makes the same decisions a sole owner
of a company makes. The only difference between a corporation and a
non-corporation is that the first has shareholders where the second
has an owner. I repeat: the shareholders in a corporation is a
conglomerate owner.

>>In theory they make up one person, the owner of the corporation.
>
>Again, I don\'t think talking about theory is particularly useful.

I suggest you make up your mind on that on a case by case basis. Certainly
any great difference between theory and practice makes relying on the
theory problematical. But what is the great, yawning chasm between theory
and practice in this instance? Why are shareholders not like an owner?
(And why is a raven like a writing desk? ;-)

>>The Chairman works
>>for the owner. The vassals \'works\' for the king. See the difference?

>In practice there is *no* difference.  In *practice* the medieval king
>`works\' for the vassals in provinding coordinated security services

This is where I say "No he dosen\'t!", right?

>just as the technocratic king works for the shareholders in providing
>coordinated profit services.

And just how does the technocratic king (your version) differ from the
Chairman of a corporation? If there isn\'t any difference then why have
two seperate names for the same system?

>The medieval vassals provided military
>service *and* taxes and the technocratic vassal provides financial
>capital.  The two situations are *very* analogous, IMHO.

The medieval vassals provided various kind of service in return for
holding the land. The people you describe acquire their holdings
and band together for mutual benefit. The first is a feudal system.
The second is just a gang.

>>A fief has _one_ owner.
>
>Just as any single bloc of shares has *one* owner.

Sigh. OK, let\'s try to get past the redundancy into something constructive.
This bloc of shares you\'re talking about. Does it have any sort of
coherence? Is it all shares in one single corporation, or is it simply
a portfolio? Is it possible to put a lable on the bloc and call it
something other than \'Martin Vesterlund\'s current stock portfolio\'? Can
it be called \'The barony of Thorvallsmines\' and is there a specific baronial
title associated with it? Can the title be transferred to someone else by
sale or inheritance? Can the bloc be sold off in small bits, and if it does,
what happens to the title?

>>A baron can\'t sell off shares of his barony to make the buyers part-barons
>>of the fief (He may be able to sell bits of the fief, but these bits then
>>become parts of other fiefs).
>
>Exactly.  Just as purchasers of shares gain title to their own new fief!

Who decides on the new title? And if a \'fief\' is just a stock portfolio,
what\'s the difference between this system and any capitalist society?

>>And if a company is the
>>equivalent of a fief then there won\'t be any shareholders, just one baron.

>No.  A private company, without public shareholders (there may *still* be

Like the Isle of Man?

>It\'s not part of a feudal system either.

Why not?

So the baronies you\'re talking about has nothing to do with the examples
we see in _Space Viking_? (All the fiefs we hear named are owned by one
single person apiece  -  what you claim to be isolated baronies that are
not part of the feudal structure (this might surprise Duke Angus to learn)).

>>There can be no
>>shareholders in a feudal fief, technocratic or not.
>
>The group of shares held in common by any single shareholder (this may be

You DO mean a stock portfolio! How do you figure out the baronial titles?

OK. I arrive on Gram with a draft for a billion credits in my back pocket.
For that I buy 10% of Megatronics, 30% of Dynaline, 51% of Gombril Spaceyards
and 1% of a half dozen more (Assume for purposes of argument that I can find
people willing to sell). Now. What\'s my title? Who is my liege lord? Who are
my vassals? What\'s my rights and what\'s my obligations?

>>Nope. The central tenet of feudalism is *service* as a medium of repayment.
>
>Again, you\'re arguing feudal *theory* and I\'m arguing feudal *practice*.

Again you dismiss evidence without any further argument.

>Medieval vassals paid taxes to their lords.

Some medieval vassals paid part of their service in money. All of them
paid some or all of it in service.

I am. The company is IMO the FT equivalent of the feudal land holding.
Like Karvalmills is one holding. Traskon is one. Etc.

>A feudal technocracy has to involve the *entire* economy.

It does. Each company is a fief, owned by a nobleman. All the fiefs
together constitutes the entire economy.

>To use the *Space Viking* model, there were probably `veterinary service\'
>fiefs under Traskon and `geological service\' fiefs under Karvalmills,

Propably? What makes you say that? Where does it even imply that anywhere
in the book?

It wasn\'t the sole basis, granted. But neither was it in early feudal
Europe. In an early feudal system each lord is independent. But they
are lords because they have vassals. They band together for mutual
protection, promising to support the king. Eventually they king assumes
ownership of their land.

>Profit generation was.

Elucidate, please.

What do you base that on? I base my argument on the analogy between a
medieval barony and what I believe to be the feudal technocratic
equivalent of such a barony. The fact is that Trask did sell the
whole thing. And that it was called "The Barony of Traskon", not "Lucas
Trask\'s holdings".

Because it didn\'t happen in feudal Europe and I assume that a feudal
technocracy works analogously to a feudal society.

We\'re not living in a feudal society, now.

True. And if a society you imagine to be a feudal one allows such things
to happen then perhaps it isn\'t one, after all.

No. He gained enough strength to deal with an arch enemy. The operative
word is \'enough\'. It\'s not enough for Sacnoth to gain an advantage over
Gram, it must be a decisive advantage. And Harald must be willing to
pay the price of using it.

>He convinced other Gram nobles to support him just like I
>suggested Sacnoth might find supporters among the other Sword Worlds for
>a move against Gram.  Are you arguing my case now?  :-)

No, I\'m arguing that since Sacnoth hasn\'t moved against Gram just maybe
Harald hasn\'t been able to find supporters among the other Sword Worlds.
And/or perhaps he dosn\'t dislike Anders as much as Angus hated Omfray.

Bingo! There\'s the fallacy. The teacher\'s union dosen\'t become a vassal,
it becomes a part owner.

Of course they do. you\'d expect an owner, even just a part owner, to have
some say in how his property is run, wouldn\'t you?

In a capitalist society CEO Akers isn\'t a lord, he is an employee of the
teacher\'s union pension fund and the other part owners. In a feudal
technocracy he would be a vassal (He wouldn\'t be a vassal of any pension
fund, though. In fact, he\'d propably be a duke and may or may not be
independent. And IBM wouldn\'t be a corporation, but a company/fief).

I certainly am. So did a lot of feudal lords. Look at the whole business
of the civil war between Stephen of Blois and the Empress Maud. Some
lords, like Geoffery de Manderville, played fast and loose with their oaths
and their allegiance, but lot\'s of noblemen actually acted on the \'theory\'.

He propably was. Angus and Omfray were both sovereign lords.

They don\'t? I thought they owned a big slice of IBM? Why don\'t they have
any right to do so? And if they don\'t, how did they manage it, and why
isn\'t this Akers person suing the pants off them?

You keep saying that, but how does it work? Start with the basic building

differently from a garden variety capitalist society.

Why not? You have a world. The world is a feudal technocracy. They produce
a king. The king sez: "No sale of industry to outsiders. Dixit". They just
happen to have a balanced economy. How are they vulnerable? And don\'t say
that I don\'t know that Gram is like that. I know I don\'t (I can\'t have both
economic fluctuations and a balanced economy). What I want to know is, why
couldn\'t it possibly be? Why MUST Gram be vulnerable?

It worked for Angus in one particular combination of strength and allies.
Dosn\'t mean it would work for Sacnoth in another situation. (Actually, it d
idn\'t work for Angus, btw. He blew it in the end. But it could have if he
hadn\'t been crazy).

Try to consider the possibility that the definitions are as they are

I apologize.  I didn\'t mean to dismiss your points about medieval feudalism.
Clearly, you have a much better understanding of medieval feudalism than I
do.  I suggest though that your very familiarity with medieval feudalism
is hindering your ability to see a feudal technocracy as something different.
I feel that it is in terms of *technocracy* and how a technocratic system
might be "feudal" that I have failed the most in communicating my ideas.
I will endeavor to be more successful.

Certainly, but they chose to call it "feudal technocracy", not "technocractic
feudalism".  This is an important distinction when one is focusing on
precise definitions.

How is "giving out industrial fiefs in [exchange] for allegiance and
support" different from "selling shares of an enterprise in exchange for
financial capital"?  In my view, they are the same thing.

Here\'s one problem in communication.  We do not share the same definition of
an "industrial holding".  I believe to you this means a single corporate
entity, a company.  To me, it is a block of stock - a share - in an
industrial enterprise.  I believe my definition is more accurate but in
any event we ought to be able to discuss this in common language now.  We
both see an "industrial holding" as being the equivalent feudal "fief" but
we have identified them as different things.

Alas, I\'m not discussing how medieval feudalism worked.  I\'m trying to
show how some of the *practices* of medieval feudalism would be manifest
in a futuristic *technocracy*.  This is another source of our communication
problem.

This is the "key part" of the feudal arrangement that will be manifest in
a feudal technocracy.  In `theory\' one might say that a corporation `owns\'
its shares and merely `grants possession\' of them to it shareholders in
return for `services rendered\' in the form of financial capital.

In a capitalist market economy an external governmental entity exists to
provide the legal framework for interactions between actors in the market.
(This lack of a stable source of legal authority is the major barrier to
market reforms in Russia today.)  In a feudal technocracy, feudal
principles provide the legal framework for interractions in the marketplace.

The various shareholders can only act through cooperation.  An individual
shareholder cannot fire the Chairman (the `technocractic lord\') on their own
(unless they hold a controlling share which is uncommon).  Thus they can
only remove the technocractic lord if a majority of the shareholders (vassals)
agree that she had failed in her duties as prescribed by the `feudal\'
arrangement.  (These are primarily related to the generation of profits for
the firm.)

Keep in mind that this is not equivalent to contemporary market systems
which have an external governmental entity to define *all* aspects of the
system from embezzlement to anti-trust action.

No, they provide the technocratic lord with financial capital.  This is
the equivalent to `fealty\' in a technocracy.  (The enterprise provides the
Chairman\'s salary and pension.  A few years back Lee Iacocca was paid *one*
dollar one year.  Clearly, there is a different principle at work here than
the mere employee-employer relationship of the corporate model.)

See.  I don\'t want to talk about medieval feudalism.  I want to talk about
how aspects of feudalism will be manifest in a futuristic technocracy.

I guess I should have said "`ownership *is* not the important" and
"coordinated military service that *is* what *matters*" and added that
I was speaking in terms of how feudalism is manifest in a technocracy.

Again, I guess I should have been more clear that I was talking about how
the principles of feudalism would be manifest in a futuristic technocracy.
I didn\'t realize that we were arguing over what medieval feudalism was.  I
thought we were trying to discover what feudal technocracy would be.

It\'s not the same.  It\'s *very* different.  A single owner needs no system
of rules to govern how she makes her decisions.  A group of shareholders
*does*.  In a feudal technocracy it is my view that feudal principles will
serve as this system.

Shareholders are not like a single owner because they require a set of
principles to govern their coordinated (there\'s that word again) actions.
It is specifically the portions of the medieval feudal definition that
relate to the ownership of *land* that are *least* useful when trying to
understand how feudal principles might be applied to a futuristic technocracy.

Well, I don\'t really see the differences in names or titles as relevant.
I see the Chairman as serving in the role of technocratic *baron* (if
there was one single Chairman in the entire economy then she would be
`king\').  There are some differences here because the contemporary market
system is not the same as a feudal technocracy due to the influence
and role of government entities external to the marketplace.  This is
where the *kieretsu* come in because the relationships among the players
there occur (mostly) outside the influence of the government.  (You must
realize that none of these examples fit the model entirely.)

I disagree.  Medieval feudal vassals "banded together for mutual benefit"
under an aristocratic lord who provided coordinated security services.
Forget the focus on `land\' and one might descibe this as a mere `gang\'
as well.  (I don\'t choose to, mind you.)

I would express this the other way around.  It is a *portfolio* rather than
`simply\' shares in a single corporation.  A group of shares in a single
corporate entity makes the shareholder the `vassal\' of the `baron\' of that
particular corporation.  As the holder of different blocks of shares
in a variety of corporations I will have a variety of `vassal\' relationships
to several different `barons\'.  This is how the technocracy becomes more
complicated but I believe this sort of situation even occurred under the
medieval feudal system on occasion (and I can\'t cite examples).  Rememeber
as well that each `baron\', each corporation, also holds shares (or is bound
by other relationships such as supplier agreements) to other `barons\',
who might be better classed as `counts\' or even `dukes\'.

Certainly.  Why wouldn\'t this be the case?  The `title\' (which is actually
the definition of the prescribed responsibilities associated with that
share of stock) transfers with ownership by sale or inheritance or whatever.
If a particular block of stock represents a majority or even full holding
then one might call is something like `the Barony of Traskon\'.  :-)

> Who decides on the new title? And if a \'fief\' is just a stock portfolio,
> what\'s the difference between this system and any capitalist society?

The title is defined by the feudal responsibilities associated with that
block of shares.  Contemporary market systems attach no such relationship
to shareholding because all such responsibilities are provided through the
external government entity.  Remember this is not just legal things like
right to ownership and such but basic principles of the entire economic
system like currency supplies, interest rates, rates of exchange, etc.
(Recall Steve Bonneville\'s post that pointed out most *zaibatsu*
were organized around a central bank.)

> Why not?

I wasn\'t talking about the Isle of Man.  I was talking about an isolated
island that existed independent of any other feudal system.  A privately-
held corporation is in essence `outside\' the rest of the economic system
if you focus merely on *ownership* as too much of the medieval model
might lead you to do.

I think the system I\'m describing fits *Space Viking* pretty darn well.
Mind you I\'m not sure Beam put the effort into his system that we\'ve already
put in here!  :-)

We don\'t know this.  *All* we know is that *Trask* owned *Traskon*.

> what you claim to be isolated baronies that are

A wholly-owned holding still may still be part of the feudal system if the
feudal arrangements cover things in addition to mere ownership.  The
feudal arrangement for Traskon Barony may have descibed things like the
price Wardshaven would pay for Traskon beef, the nature of such transfers,
where Traskon acquired feed for its bisonoids, how veterinary services
were received, hiring and pay issues for ranch hands, etc., etc., etc.
Remember, in a contemporary market economy the external government entity
does most of these things.  There is no external government entity in a
feudal technocracy.

> You DO mean a stock portfolio! How do you figure out the baronial titles?

I don\'t know.  How did they do it in medieval times?  I imagine something
in the feudal agreement defines these sorts of things.

> OK. I arrive on Gram with a draft for a billion credits in my back pocket.

Well, I think you could probably figure this out yourself now but here goes.
You are Hans, Baron of Spindleworks (under the Duke of Megatronics), Count
of Gronemetrics (under the Duke of Dynaline), Duke of Gombril, and a minor
squire to a half dozen other lords.  You hold fealty to all of these lords.
You probably have dozens of your own vassals now.  (Now please don\'t hold
me to specifics here, but you get the idea I hope.)  You see that if King
Anders of Gram were to do this on Sacnoth he would be in vassalage to any
lord of which he owned a minority holding.

Again, I apologize.  I should have said "medieval feudal theory (or practice)"
and "futuristic feudal technocractic practice".

> I am. The company is IMO the FT equivalent of the feudal land holding.
> Like Karvalmills is one holding. Traskon is one. Etc.

Now you see how I\'m using "industrial holding" differently.  There is nothing
about a technocracy that requires a holding to be held in full.  (And I\'m
not sure you can support the claim that Karvallmills was held in full.  Also,
it\'s even possible that Trask only held a majority interest in Traskon.
Angus would still have gained control had Trask only sold a majority holding.
The very fact that Nik Trask was appointed Vicar-Baron suggests he might have
held a minority interest.)

Nothing.  How does it conflict with what\'s in the book?  It helps me explain

What `service\' did Duke Angus provide to Trask and Karvall and his other
vassals that was equivalent to the medieval duke riding forth with his
knight to protect an embattled baron?  (I suppose you\'ll say the same
military service.  Ug!)  What the Duchy of Wardshaven did, IMHO, was
coordinate economic activites (there\'s the feudal part) so that the
economic baronies of his vassals were able to function.  The Bank of
Wardshaven provided a source of investment capital for Karvallmills to
purchase milling equipment, some other vassal provided civil engineering
services so that Traskon had reliable water supplies, Karvallmills provided
collapsium for the vehicle manufacturing barony to build earthmovers for
the civil engineering barony, etc., etc., etc.

I don\'t see much technocracy in your model.  If political power is based
merely on industrial (as opposed to land) holdings where does the
"government by those with specialized knowledge" part of technocracy
come in?  Your model of feudal technocracy looks merely like futuristic
feudalism to me.

> And that it was called "The Barony of Traskon", not "Lucas
> Trask\'s holdings".

Excuse me for being dense, but what\'s the difference what it\'s called?  As
I envision it (and as I\'ve *tried* to describe it) the terms `barony\'
and `holdings\' mean the same thing.

Okay, before I get into to my entire "IBM as feudal technocratic barony"
model let me make the disclaimer that despite the fact the I was using the
real names of the CEO and former CEO all my references to shareholders
(teachers\' union and such) are strictly for illustrative purposes and do
not have anything remotely to do with the actual situation at IBM.

> Bingo! There\'s the fallacy. The teacher\'s union dosen\'t become a vassal,

You say, "Tomato."  Dan Qualye says, "Tomatoe."  :-)  It\'s the same thing.
In a feudal *technocractic* model a `part owner\' *is* a vassal.

> In a capitalist society CEO Akers isn\'t a lord, he is an employee of the

Well, yes, but I wasn\'t talking about a market economy.  I was using this
example to illustrate how a feudal technocracy works.

> In a feudal
> technocracy he would be a vassal

What can I say?  We have exactly opposite understandings here.  Again, you\'re
focused on the ownership of land, or now shares of stock.  You get this from
your understanding of medieval feudalism.  Where does the technocracy fit in
your model?  Or does the mere fact that there\'s `something technical\' about
IBM or any industrial firm satisfy you in this regard?

IMHO, `technocracy\' describes the basis for the ruling class\'s exercise
of authority and `feudal\' describes the nature of the relationships between
the members of this ruling class.

> What\'s so complicated about medieval Germany?

Wasn\'t one of the problems with the formation of a nation-state in Germany
the fact that under the feudal system there the holdings were always split
among all the heirs of a dead lord?  This led to more and more fragmentation
among the various principalities and greater and greater intermingling of
the feudal agreements between various barons. This was unlike the experience
in other medieval nations where holdings passed to the eldest heir.  (Or do
I need to get my money back for those Western Civ courses?  :-)

fedualism and back to feudal technocracy.

And what was the basis of this `legal\' authority?  How was it defined?

A minority shareholder has no legal influence in a corporation (other than
that pertaining specifically to the ownership of its shares).  A large
minority shareholder nevertheless has a great deal of *influence* among
other shareholders and can sway these other shareholders to action against
the Chairman of it can convince them that the Chairman, by not adequately
providing coordinated profit services, has violated his `feudal\' duties.
It *is* legal for a majority of shareholders to `fire\' the Chairman.  Your
question about `suing\' illustrates the difference between our market
economy and a feudal technocracy once again - there is no external entity
under which to seek such redress in a feudal technocracy.

Are you beginning to see the difference?  In a market economy a government
entity external to the marketplace provides the framework of principles
which govern the nature of interactions in the marketplace.  In a feudal
technocracy these principles will be provided by the feudal agreements.

Could a medieval king do this if a majority of his barons did not support
this move?  It\'s my view that in a feudal technocracy a majority of barons
would not support a king who proposed this course of action because it is
counter to the enhancement of profit.  If someone shows up from offworld
with a wad of cash willing to pay twice what you think your ranching barony
is worth and your liege tells you you can\'t do it you\'re going to be mighty
displeased.  It\'s as if a medieval king had proposed unilateral disarmament!

Now let\'s talk about economic might.  The entire Mexican economy is about
5% of the US economy.  Where would Mexican industry be in the face of US
industry if there were not an external government entity (the Mexican
government) trying to protect it and another external government entity
(the US government) making some effort to see that US industry respect the
will of the Mexican government?  The entire European Union economy is about
120% of the US economy but it is highly fractured when compared to US
industry.  The only thing protecting European industry from being diced up
and swallowed by US industry is the intervention once again of external
government entities on both sides of the Atlantic (this is, in fact, a major
motivation behind the whole idea of the European Union) and these powers enjoy
roughly the same level of technological capability.  Does that give you some
insight on what Sacnoth *ought* to be able to do to Gram under a feudal
technocracy where there are *no* external government entities to protect
less powerful economic players?  Remember, we have already tied technological
capability to economic output so *clearly* Sacnoth\'s technological edge over
Gram should translate to an equivalent economic edge.

Accepted.  How does a technocracy work?  How is a futuristic feudal
technocracy different from medieval feudalism?

> So why use the word \'feudal\' if the arrangement isn\'t feudal?

Two things:  Feudalism was much more than the ties to ownership of land;
and a feudal technocracy is something quite different from medieval fedualism.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been enjoying the discussion so far.  Please advise as to whether I\'m
summarizing correctly (that will depend on which camp you\'re in, I suppose):

Historical feudalism could be described as a "feudal landlord-ocracy," in
which the landowner granted the right to use his land to certain vassals.
The vassals obtained the land and the people on the land (serfs, peasants,
or tenant farmers), and were obliged to fight at the landlord\'s bidding, and
usually to provide some men-at-arms from the people.  The people gave all of
their surplus production (food in historical times -- I\'m referring to
Europe, but there were analogous situations in Japan, China, and Russia as
well) to the landlord\'s vassal.  The people got protection from outside
enemies -- the landlord and his vassals would protect their lands and the
people on them -- as well as from internal problems -- their lord, the
landlord\'s vassal, would establish as manorial court and provide police-type
services.  The landlord\'s vassals got the surplus of the lands, which could
be traded, as well as often absolute power over the people.  The landlord
got troops, as well as taxes, and the surplus of his own personal holdings.

Maybe I\'ve left some details out, but that\'s how I recall European feudalism
working in broad outline (remember from history class, not from being
there).

In a feudal technocracy, some technology is substituted for the land; rule
is by the owners of the technology, who grant a right to use it to some
vassal class.  The vassals then hold the technology and the people who apply
it.  The people give the technocrat\'s vassals their surplus production
(which is probably not food), which the vassals can sell.  Probably the
people give all of their production to the vassal class (vassal is really a
misnomer here; it just means someone who owes fealty to someone higher in
the feudal hierarchy), which sells it and pays a wage to the people who buy
items for their subsistence.

The vassals owe the technocrat something -- possibly military service, or
the provision of some military items.  Perhaps the vassal\'s fief creates
enough surplus production to finance a tank or a COACC fighter.  It\'s very
unlikely that the vassal and his men-at-arms just show up for war, but it\'s
not impossible, either.

The problem that I\'m running into in analogizing feudal landlord-ocracy into
feudal technocracy is that I\'m using terminology, and the attendant systems,
that comes from capitalism, which is a different development altogether.
Having advanced from feudalism to capitalism, can we have a feudal structure
again?

Ok this probably has ended up obfuscating more than clarifying.  I\'ll try
again when I\'m fresher.

Here are two unrelated questions (maybe not so unrelated):

How have referees handled the question of slavery in the CT era?  Do your
Imperia allow slaves?  Interstellar slave trading?  Feudal technocratic
serfdom?  Labor unions?  Scratch that last one for now -- in fact, scratch
the last two.  I want to know about your views on regular sophont-as-chattel
slavery in the CT Imperium (and other states, too, I suppose).

What were the cultural effects of the psionics suppressions?  Are religious
visions considered a form of clairvoyance, and persecuted?  Are
mind-altering drugs associated with the Zhodani and avoided?  Or are they
embraced as a way of altering one\'s own mind without the interference of
another person?  Do people make psionic jokes?  Is meditation outlawed (or
embraced)?  Is hypnotherapy practiced?  What about psychiatry?  What about
neurosurgery?

    'body' => 'Hello fellow Travellers,

just my comments on anti matter missiles:
I don\'t use them as penetrators. What I do is use them as slow destructive
charges. My use of antimatter is the following:

The missile is indeed a smart version of a usual drone, which carries an
antimatter dispenser on board. The drone maneuvers close to the enemy
vehicle and releases the antimatter in low quantities as hydrogen gas. There
is no immediate reaction, because space is nearly empty and the few matter
antimatter collisions in space will give a slight area jamming effect
(+1 Diff Mod for all Sensor actions, if antimatter is around).

The drone releases the Antimatter using a vector which will bring the enemy
starship in contact with the antimatter cloud. To do this the drone has to be
in the same hex as the target ship. If the antimatter is released in an adjacent
hex, it will disperse and become inert with respect to damage. If the drone
successfully insert antimatter in the pass of the target ship, the antimatter
causes 1 minor hit per round to all external devices (i.e. Antennas). If there
are no more devices on the hull, the hull is attacked. Each round of contact
to Antimatter reduces the hull armor by (50000/disp tons), because the
antimatter attacks the hull surface. One antimatter discharge of the missile
will be active for 2 space combat rounds, unless any maneuvers are done.
Regardless of the piloting roll or the thrust spended, the antimatter will
not be in contact with the ship anymore.

One shot of Antimatter in the sense above is 0.5 kl. To design the drone use
the spaceship design sequence. You need full computing power (i.e. no Flight
computer) and a special Software to do this job. Fully RCV operation is not
possible, because the time delay would severly limit the effectivity of this
weapon. As with standard X-Ray-Laser warheads, this weapon can only be used
at range 0. And it cannot be used in atmosphere, because in atmosphere the
drone will be destroyed by the released Antimatter.

required Antimatter launcher:
Volume: 0.25 kl, Weight: 0.25 kl, Power required: 0.5 MW, Price: 95000 Cr
Launched volume: 0.5 kl Antimatter per Space combat turn.
Modus Operandi:
The Antimatter launcher is the inverse of a bussard ramscoop. It uses
superconduting magnets to accelerate the antimatter hydrogen onto the target.

Hey! You\'ll be making me blush next. I\'m no expert. I have read quite a lot
of historical fiction, including some set in this time frame, but I know
full well that one should be wary of relying on such information. Some
fiction authors know what they\'re talking about, others definitely do not.
That\'s why I checked with a dictionary.

>I suggest though that your very familiarity with medieval feudalism
>is hindering your ability to see a feudal technocracy as something different.

Not quite. It\'s the basis of MY assumptions about feudal technocracy. I
realize that if a feudal technocracy is not feudal, then it may work very
differently. What is hindering my ability to see it working differently
is my faiure to see any fundamental difference between what you describe
and ordinary capitalism.

>How is "giving out industrial fiefs in [exchange] for allegiance and
>support" different from "selling shares of an enterprise in exchange for
>financial capital"?  In my view, they are the same thing.

In the first case the vassal does not pay money to acquire the fief, he
undertakes to perform the technical duties involved in running it. In
other words, he agrees to perform a service in exchange for the holding.
In the second case he possesses goods equivalent in value to the holding
and pays for it. In the first case he is obviously beholden to the lord,
since he has been given something for nothing (or rather, nothing more than
his solemn word that he will perform certain services as compensation. That
is of course quite a lot in any society where a man\'s word is considered
important). In a sense he is paying rent on is holding, except that he pays
his rent party or totally in service  -  and that is a central facet of a
feudal arrangment: service as payment for tenancy. In the second case he is
under no obigation to the seller. Goods of (supposedly) equal value has been
exchanged.

Right.

So I gather. Now the question becomes, does it make sense?

Of course you do. Otherwise you would be agreeing with me.

For a start I\'d ike a definition of a technocracy. Not a FT, but any system
that can be described as a technocracy. What are the essential features of a
technocracy?

>In `theory\' one might say that a corporation `owns\' its shares and merely

That would be an extremely distorted view of a very simple arrangement: A
number of people pool their ressources to become joint owners of a business.

>In a capitalist market economy an external governmental entity exists to

That turns out not to be the case. The whole world economy, for example, is
based on negotiations between sovereign nations. Sovereign nations have no
external governmental entity to provide any legal framework. Yet would you
claim that the interactions between the U.S, EU, Japan, Russia, China, ect.
is not capitalist in nature?

>(This lack of a stable source of legal authority is the major barrier to
>market reforms in Russia today.)

The disappearance of the USSR removed the established framework between the
member republics. The USSR were an exampe of a government providing a
framework. Now the republics are negotiating as equals to replace the
framework. Once they work out various treaties to govern their interaction
we will have an example of a framework provided without a government. The
internal relations of the EU is a hybrid. GATT is a negotiated framework.

But the principles you\'ve mentioned is not feudal.

Which seems to be a normal, standard business relationship. We buy a part
of the company. A majority of us decides how it should be run and hire
someone to do it for us. If he dosen\'t perform as we like, we fire him
and hire someone else.

As is the case in any corporation.

Of course one can have market systems without government supervision. Well,
you may need a government to make sure noone shoots at you while you\'re
manufacturing or trading, but what more do you need?

Why call it \'fealthy\' then, since it isn\'t remotely like fealthy?

>(The enterprise provides the Chairman\'s salary and pension.

Of course it does. His salary (and pension) is an operating expense.
Naturally the enterprise has to generate enough money to cover that.
Wether the salary is fixed or depends on profits has no bearing on
that (It has a lot of bearing on the Chairman\'s incentive to strive
for the best possible results).

But the other knights dosen\'t have a beef. We were talking about how an

fellow empoyees to support him might get away with a strike.

Not very.

They need one rule: Decisions are taken by a share majority. The only
difference between shareholders and a single owner is that the single
owner can run his company himself OR hire someone to do it, while
shareholders HAS to hire someone (although that someone can be one
of the shareholders, maybe even a majority shareholder, in which case
the difference is even less).

Principles, you say? As in theory? OK. What feudal principles?

They _require_ ONE pinciple: Majority rules. They can have more.

That\'s unfortunate, because that is the basis of the whole feudal system.
And that, of course, is why a system where you can become a vassal by
running a business instead of a land holding cannot be called a straight
feudality, but must be qualified to include industrial holdings.

No, I meant a feudal technocracy and any other capitalist system. If
there isn\'t any real difference why have two seperate names for the
same systems?

Agreed.

Only if she partitioned out the various industries to fiefholders in

No, no, no. The cornerstone of the feudal arrangement were the manorial
holdings a big landholder gave to strong men in return for their promise
to support him. That made them vassals and him a feudal lord  -  a
sovereign feudal lord. It was these lords who banded together under princes
or kings for mutual benefit. Eventually the difference between the king\'s
own direct vassals, who had sworn fealthy to him in return for land, and
the other feudal lords who had sworn fealthy to him in return for protection,
became blurred and in the end those sovereign lords were not sovereign any
more.

>It is a *portfolio* rather than `simply\' shares in a single corporation. A
>group of shares in a single corporate entity makes the shareholder the
>`vassal\' of the `baron\' of that particular corporation.

I can well understand that you put \'vassal\' and \'baron\' in quotes, because
this has nothing to do with vassalage og baronies. It\'s simpy a fancy way
of saying that if you buy some shares in a corporation you and your fellow
shareholders get to elect the man who runs the business and in return he
should make sure the shares pay dividends, because if not you will fire him.

>Certainly.  Why wouldn\'t this be the case?  The `title\' (which is actually
>the definition of the prescribed responsibilities associated with that
>share of stock) transfers with ownership by sale or inheritance or whatever.

So a \'title\' isn\'t a title either.

>The title is defined by the feudal responsibilities associated with that
>block of shares.  Contemporary market systems attach no such relationship

>external government entity.

If you mean that a government will enforce obligations freely entered into
by subjects of that government, then you\'re right, but what\'s that got to
do with it? The \'responsibiities\' inherent in paying money for shares in
a company is usually defined by the parties involved without recourse to
the government. "I pay you for part of that company. I get a say in who
we hire to run it. I get a share of the profits. Agreed?". The government
need only ensure that people keep their word (athough admittedely most
governments don\'t have the good sense to stop there).

>Remember this is not just legal things like
>right to ownership and such but basic principles of the entire economic
>system like currency supplies, interest rates, rates of exchange, etc.

You\'ll have to explain that. How does owning shares in a company allow me
to have a say about currencies, interest rates, and rates of exchange, etc?

>A privately-held corporation is in essence `outside\' the rest of the
>economic system if you focus merely on *ownership* as too much of the
>medieval model might lead you to do.

But I don\'t focus *merely* on ownership. A medieval fief-holder certainly
interacted with other people than his liege lord. Like all the neighbours
for a start. Likewise a private company interacts with other companies as
much as any corporation. In fact, if you were the chairman of a company
dealing with the chairman of another company then it would matter not a whit
wether you had been hired by a single owner or a bunch of shareholders. Nor
would it matter if he had been hired by one or the other.

>I think the system I\'m describing fits *Space Viking* pretty darn well.

I think it fits terribly. Obviously this is a different subject.

>>(All the fiefs we hear named are owned by one single person apiece  -

>We don\'t know this.  *All* we know is that *Trask* owned *Traskon*.

You don\'t think Sesar Karvall owned Karvallmills? Andray Dunnan did. So did
whoever it was who called him \'Baron of Karvallmills\'.

A feudal arrangement is not about mere ownership. It\'s about tenancy in
exchange for service.

There\'s not a shred of evidence to support that. The only thing we are
told for sure is that the fighting men of Traskon and Karvallmills
henceforth will be seen as solidly behind Duke Angus. Very possibly
Trask and Karvall have been independent (though themselves feudal lords
to _their_ liegemen) until the wedding and the ceremony we see is the
public declaration of fealthy to Angus.

>>I am. The company is IMO the FT equivalent of the feudal land holding.

>Now you see how I\'m using "industrial holding" differently.

Yes. What I can\'t see is how your \'industrial holding\' differs from an
ordinary stock portfolio. And if there isn\'t any diference then why
have a special name for the system?

>>It does. Each company is a fief, owned by a nobleman. All the fiefs

>*Technocractically-speaking*, what\'s the rationale for insisting that all

That the service a vassal gives in return for an industrial holding is to
manage the holding for the liege lord. Since the holding is a business of
some kind the vassal has to be competent to run the business.

Right. \'The fighting men of Traskon and Karvallmills\', remember? And Lucas
explained that the reason he supported Angus was that Angus was the only
duke Lucas thought had a chance to unite Gram and become a king, and Lucas
thought a king was a good idea. And how did Angus unite Gram? He used his
fighting men to conquer the lords he couldn\'t persuade to support him.

What\'s the difference between this and what the head of a conglomorate
does that makes it feudal in any way, shape, or form?

That may be so, but there\'s not one jot of evidence in the book that this
was the basis of the feudal relationship between Trask and Karvall on one
side and Duke Angus on the other, and some evidence to the contrary. And
btw, to fit your above definition, shouldn\'t Trask and Karvall own a share
of Wardshaven in order to be Angus\' vassals?

>I don\'t see much technocracy in your model.  If political power is based

You need to be able to perform whatever technical task your holding demands
in order to perform the service you pay for your tenancy.

Right. But since the whole definition of feudalism has to do with land, a
system where industrial holdings can substitute cannot be called true
feudalism.

In spite of the fact that the relationship between a part owner and the
chairman he helped elect is nothing remotely like the relationship
between a vassal and his liege lord. That\'s not "Tomato/tomatoe". That\'s
"Tomato/fried egg".

And I was using the example to demonstrate that your concept of a liege

a liege lord at all.

Not shares. Companies.

If it hadn\'t been for that four-line definition provided by GDW then that
would have been enough. To satisfy that I add that these holdings require
the vassal to run them himself.

All very well. I admit that I may be on thin ice with the \'technocracy\'
part (Maybe a definition of \'technocracy\' would help). But you are under
the ice about the feudal relationship. Nothing you\'ve described resembles
a feudal arrangement.

That\'s the whole problem with sovereignity. There is no authority over the
sovereign. That\'s one reason petty lords support a king: to provide a
legal authority to settle their disputes.

Like the right to replace the chairman if he can get enough other share-

Or, as it could also be expressed, that by not doing his job properly the

That\'s what I thought.

Why can\'t there be?

Except in those market economies where no government exists. A government
is not an absolute requirement for a market (although it can be a big
help in keeping people from shooting each other), nor does it _have_ to
interfere with the market whose tranquiity it ensures (Unfortunately,
human nature being what it is, few politicians can resist the temptation
to meddle).

That would depend on wether they disliked the idea more than the idea of

Unless, maybe, the king can persuade you that dealing with an outsider

Possibly, but will your neighbours be? Unless the offworlder can buy their
holdings too, why would they care? Don\'t you think they would support the
king against you? For that matter, would you sell that which gives you
your position in society for mere money?

It does, except that I don\'t accept the postulate that a feudal technocracy
can\'t have a government. Certainly not my concept of a FT and not even the
kind of FT you\'ve described. Even granted the conglomorate type society
you call a feudal technocracy there\'s nothing to prevent the players on
Gram from realizing that allowing the stronger Sacnoth players to play
wil eventually mean loosing all the marbles to them. Now, if Gram needs
something that only Sacnoth can provide, Sacnoth can use that dependency
to force Gram to let them play. But if that vulnerability isn\'t there,
Sacnoth can go fly a kite made out of their stronger credit notes. Or
if Sacnoth is considerably stronger than Gram, militarily, they can force
their way in, provided they are willing to use force. But if they aren\'t
that much stronger, or if they aren\'t willing to use their strength, that
still leaves them out in the cold.

>Remember, we have already tied technological
>capability to economic output so *clearly* Sacnoth\'s technological edge over
>Gram should translate to an equivalent economic edge.

Sure. In _TCS_ terms their money is worth the same (higher technology, but
lower starport type, (indicating less trade relatively)). In _Striker_
terms their money is worth 14.3 % more. But 14% or even 50% superiority
is cold comfort if you\'re exchanging nuclear missiles.

>Two things:  Feudalism was much more than the ties to ownership of land;
>and a feudal technocracy is something quite different from medieval fedualism.

Something different, obviouly. But as I mentioned earlier, I assumed from the
start that \'feudal\' had some meaning analogous its old one.

There is a probability of a ban on robots, at least as independent entities,

    Most older vessels will probably be refitted to newer tech (this being
easier than building new ships) where possible. The Regency needs to use
whatever technological advantage it has so that it can best protect its
boarders (Virus, Zhodani, Aslan, Vargr, etc...).

If either of these happen I would figure on assassination wars, somewhat like
the Aslan, I think most of the leaders would be too worried about the Virus
for one thing at least to start a major war. Unless of course said individual

I think Norris is smart enough to use whatever methods he needs to clean

Campaign?  If enough folks would be interested, I would

The game would be two-sided, with players allocated to
sides in order of request to join.  The players on each
side will have to work out among themselves command
procedures, ship designs, etc.

The campaign would take place between two subsector-
sized units, with a third frontier sector seperating
them.  Both sides will be assumed to have come up to
TL13 within the past year, so existing fleet production
will be 20% TL11, 80%TL12, + TL13 production as desired
from one year\'s budget starting 52 weeks before the
start of game.

If there are requests, I may add a couple of tertiary
powers to the game.

Tactical combat would be resolved by the referee, in
accordance with player\'s orders and with the aid of the
local gaming group.  At critical junctures in a tactical
situation, if there is a player with the force, I will
consult if I feel input is required.

I expect the game to move quite slowly, with generous
deadlines (and especially so during initial design and
periods of intense tactical activity).

I will assume that the two societies at conflict are
reatively open, so that many details of at least older
designs will be public knowledge (...pass me Jane\'s,
will you?)  and particlarly interesting designs and
events will be posted to TML.

If you are interested, please email me directly.  I will
allow a couple of weeks to gather responses, and judge
from that if I should proceed.

 Frankly, I don\'t either.  I can see where, given the ranges and velocities
of space combat, it would be very hard, but no matter how improbably it is, a
ship can be constructed to deliver enough missles quickly enough to make at
least one hit probable -- and an impact by even one delayed-detonation H-bomb
riding in a high velocity penetrator ought to really ruin your day.

OTOH, can you image how the "tradition" based gamers would react to missles
becoming genuinely effective?  In traditional high guard, a missile armed
figher cannot seriously threaten a large warship.  With impact nukes honestly
represented, they could.  Perhaps that is what the decision to ban them was
based on.

Possible or not, I do think we are talking Ancients technology here. Or
close to it at least.

Several SF writers has used black holes or singularities (same thing) as
weapons or as a means of locomotion in either real space or hyperspace.
David Gerrold use it in his latest book "Covenant of Justice". Larry
Niven used it as a murder weapon and as a weapon from destroying
starships. One of the two latter (if not both) stories are not realistic
as Stephen Hawkins found that black holes of the size mentioned in these
stories would only exist a few seconds before they ceased to exist.

And a missile with with a black hole must keep the black hole "alive"
until after it is used. And this will undoubtfully cost power and/or
mass. How much? do anyone know? [sigh, back to the drawing board]

They can take ROF overpowering according to the rules given in BL. That
will say; To get a -1 difficulty level you multiply the power
requirement with 5, and with 10 for a -2 difficulty level.

How do the cost come out for lasers not using gravitic focusing? That
could be interesting to know for those who are going to the tournament
GDW will hold at GenCon. Alas I can\'t come this year. I hope I\'ll make
it next year.

Suggestions for alternate Coyns:

In the modern set we have the six castes.  An ancient set might
have seven.  The seventh caste being that of the ancients
themselves:  Grandfather and his children.

While I think that the races idea being representative of their
respective personality types, I might also suggest that they
represent the competition that the Droyne face in the present
setting.  Grandfather, when setting out the coyns thought he had
better show the Droyne who/what else was out there in the universe.
I guess I\'m thinking of Niven\'s Ringworld Engineers where the Pak
had built their ringworld with bits and pieces of other worlds to
serve as warnings to their descendents:  Earth, Mars, Kzin etc.

But at other times, it was not apparant just who were the races
that Grandfather might want to show to the Droyne.  Example:  Until
the Aslan hit space, they were a pretty small deal.  Thus, Coyns
from before that time wouldn\'t include them.

But what other races are out there?

The extinct race on Sabmiqys:  The Gya Ks.  Until -8000 when their
planet was wiped out, these guys must have looked like a potent
force to Gramps. (TL 17 but no jump drive.) [Challenge]

The extinct race on Spica now known as the Hasst\'kor:  The creators
of the Prt\'.  Until -10000 when they were wiped out in a war, they
were doing quite well.  (TL 16) [Challenge]

The Droashav, also known as the G\'naak by the K\'kree:  The original
G\'naak carnivores who almost conquered Kirur in -27000.  Their TL
is unknown, but was at least TL10, and some of their
instrumentation has survived 23000 years without any maintenance.
(Sounds like TL 16+ to me, but no jump drive).  [MegaTrav Journal]

The Hhkar:  The stogie smoking lizards have been in space since
- -50000.  (TL10 but no jump drive.)  [Challenge]

The intelligent Chamax thingies:  (Unlikely, but these guys were
space faring in the 700s. (TL9-10 but no jump drive) [Double
Adventure 5]

The unnamed alien race in Traveller\'s Digest #21.  These guys were
just sort of thrown in without any explanation.  They were
obviously some kind of servant race for the Ancients.

The Primordials:  These guys who were so dang powerful, they made
Grandfather look like a doddering senile old Worker Caste.  Then
they got bored and died.  I almost did too when I read that one.
[Knightfall]

Alternately, an ancient set of coyns might have proto-vargr on
them.  Vargr looked quite different in -300,000.

Or How about Dolphins?

How about another dead alien race we\'ve never heard of before in
Traveller?  The Krell from Forbidden Planet?  The things from
Aliens (JTAS)?  The creatures the Aliens originally snacked on in
Alien?  Larry Niven\'s Slavers?  David Brin\'s Progenitors?  Arthur
C. Clarke\'s Ramans?  The Ancient High Martians from Space: 1889?
The Daleks?  The aliens from UFO?  The Mysterons from Captain
Scarlet?  The alien races from 2300AD?  James P. Hogan\'s giant
Ganymeans.  Saberhaugen\'s Berserker creators?  The Moties?  H. P.
Lovecraft\'s Ancient Ones?  The mice from Hitch Hiker\'s Guide to the
Galaxy?  The Hive creatures from Alt.Pub.Havens-Rest?

Who knows, maybe in the future we may be seeing coyns with Ael Yael
on them or Brinn, or Newts?  [The players find a bag of coyns that
went through a time warp.  From the past, or the future? :-]

One obvious use for the short range highly efficient X-ray lasers is in
defense against fighters and missiles, both of which need to be close to
attack.  Range isn\'t needed, and much better firepower is available without
gravitic focusing.  In fact, for missile defense it might be advantageous to
put more than one laser in a turret.  Hers\'s a TL15 turret design that has
three lasers, each of which fires at 800 per turn.  Three shots at -5 Diff...
can it miss????

This system uses one beam pointer and one HPG for all three lasers.  If a
separate beam pointer and HPG are used, the power drops to about 200 MJ, still
adequate for missile defense.

With a little geometry, I determined that each focal array has a diameter of
1.65 meters.  This makes effective range 5.5 hexes.  The focal arrays are
built to fire at 800 shots per turn.

Discharge Energy 430 MJ (each), Input Energy 506 MJ (each)

Beam Pointer (5 Hex)    1.5 tons    1.5 kl      .15MCr
Focal Arrays        22.07 tons  22.07 kl    4.414MCr
HPG         35.42 tons  17.71 kl    .1771MCr

This totals 58.99 tons, 4.7411 MCr, and Draws 675 MW at maximum rate of fire.

Performance is:

5: 52-1/17  10: 29-1/9  20: 14-1/5  40: 7-1/2

Its pretty crummy at long range, but with three shots, each at -5 Diff, it
probably wont miss.  Firing every .75 seconds... if YOU were a fighter pilot,
would you go anywhere near this thing???  :)

Eric Moore says (message 7987) that 1 MJ per square centimeter is enough to do
serious damage to antennas.  I agree with this, but GDW apparently doesn\'t.
Their guidline for lasers is that 1 MJ per square cm is about a point of
damage.  I think that warships would be built with a different design
philosophy if large nukes were a mainstay of space combat.  A missile gets
within 100 km, detonates, and then your blind because all of your antennas are
slag.  This isn\'t exactly a difficult fire control problem either.  Antennas
would be designed to better withstand this kind of abuse.  A zillion watt
particle accelerator in a jillion ton vessel is useless if you\'ve burnt off all
the antennas.  maybe you could look through a porthole and aim???  :)

Large fusion bombs aren\'t that hard to build, especially at higher tech levels.
They\'re also MUCH cheaper than antimatter.  And even if you want to be
environmentally conscious, there is a known fusion process that is entirely
clean.  Boron-11 fusing with a proton (hydrogen nucleus) produces a Carbon-12
nucleus which is stable, and some gamma rays.  No positrons, no nasty
radioactive waste.  Just soot.  Of course for it to be clean is has to be
detonated by inertial confinement (lasers), or by gravitic confinement if you
want to use that tech.  And boron-11 isn\'t even that rare.  The other naturally
occuring isotope (B-10 i think) is commonly used in reactor shielding.  The
palnt to separate natural boron are already lying around.  There\'s even piles
of Boron-11 already separated.  The only catch is that its a lot harder to make
it fuse than the hydogen reactions.

Another design point: forget solid fuel on space missiles.  Put a small
powerplant (2 MW) and a 8G HePlaR drive on it.  Then you can carry about 100
g-turns of fuel, and fly circles around other missiles.  And why not more than
one warhead.  The missiles in Brilliant Lances aren\'t very optimized.  Unless
an 8G missile needs 80 points of armor.  This is clearly ridiculous.  40cm of
steel on a 7m long missile?????  what were they thinking???

This doesn\'t make any sense.  Under what theory can a corporation

own its shares and grant possession of them to shareholders, when shares

themselves are merely evidence of ownership?  Shareholders provide capital

only once, when they buy.  Lenders providing loan facilities maybe have

some duty to render service in the form of providing capital.

Fealty is loyalty.  How is the provision of money equivalent to loyalty?

The Chairman--and, more importantly for this discussion, the CEO--

owe a duty of loyalty to the company and the shareholders, not the other

way around.

Again, you\'ve turned the relationships around.  The shareholders aren\'t
vassals;

rather, the management of the corporation owes a duty of loyalty to them,

to maximize the value of their investment.  The employees of the corporation

are closer to vassals of the CEO, and maybe a feudal structure could be

arranged around this idea.



Hans Rancke writes

I (probably obviously) agree with this analysis.  What is being held in
tenancy,

and what kind of service, are the defining issues here.

Actually, I think you will find that a laser can have any beam divergence
you like!
Check out the laser formulae in FF&S.
You can see the remote because you program it to send frequent messages to
you.
The advantage of a laser communicator is that the high frequency allows the
antenna to be much smaller than a radio frequency antenna of the same beam
divergence. Also a true tight beam radio communicator would be just as hard
to jam as an equivalent laser communicator!

The communications lag is a real problem if you are trying to do "seat of
the pants" flying by direct control but is less so if a certain amount of
automation is allowed.
By fitting your remote with sensors and a computer capable of determining a
target solution it can attack the enemy without direct intervention of the
controller!
The computer can also be programmed to perform evasive maneuvers!
The remote controller\'s function is to make "executive" decisions; which
ship to attack, when to evade, which sensors to use etc.

The K\'kree CAN use this for remote fighters but whether they WANT to after
the effects of the virus on computer controlled weapon systems, particularly
on those in constant communication with other computers is another matter.

I think the answer is yes. It better be in the Imperium, since FT\'s are so
common. A FT does not need to be capitalist - indeed the very system would
often dictate against capitalism. If control of a particular resource
determines one\'s place in society, selling it off may not make sense.
(As Hans mentioned in a previous posting). There does not necessarily even
have to be money (at least in the form we currently recognise it).

Slavery has been acknowledged as existing in a number of Traveller
publications. By Imperium law, slavery is outlawed. However, by the policy
of imperial non-interference in local affairs, it seems that many local
populations effectively live in serfdom, if not outright slavery. It
also makes for stirring adentures and story-lines, regardless of
whether it makes economic sense or not.

This actually is quite relevant. One characteristic of the feudal system
is some form of serfdom or slavery for the common people. In the 19th
century company-store-type wage-slavery produced a serf-like relationship
between employees and company owners - thus the industrial Robber-Barons
were born. Feudalism has been called a medieval protection racket. The
common people were almost powerless and lived at the whim of their lords.
Certainly, I associate feudalism with powerlessness for the common
people.

If this is a common attribute of FT\'s, then they will tend to be
isolationist and xenophobic, at least at higher social levels, to prevent
the commons from getting ideas above their station. This also makes
social status extremely important in such a society, and anything that
risks it something to be avoided. Capitalism and the rising mercantile
class is what destroyed feudalism - money replaced land as the measure
of a person\'s worth, and penniless nobles found themselves in debt
to rich but unlanded merchants.

I will try to give an example of a non-capitalist FT.

Consider a vacuum world with a number of population centres. At some stage
the environmental engineers controlling the life support systems perform a
takeover and gain political power by virtue of their technical knowledge
ie. their ability to selectively turn off the life support systems. This
covers the technocracy aspect of the definition.

The takeover being successful, the engineers use the already-established
life-support regions to define their individual holdings, or feifs.
Holding the de-facto power of life and death in these regions, they can
distribute the control of industries and buildings pretty much as they
desire, creating vassals. The people in these regions are dependent on
their Regional Engineer (Baron/Lord) for their continued existence.
Resources are traded between regions on the barter system, the resources
including workers (serfs/slaves) with special skills. Engineers provide
their serfs with all the necessities of life for service, not payment.
A Planetary Engineer (king) may or may not exist, but if he does he
adjudicates disputes between regional engineers, appoints replacements
when there is no clear successor and appoints new engineers to newly
formed regions, which may occur from building or reorganisation.
This is the feudal component of the FT.

The above system could use money, but I left it out to make my point.
(perhaps they have a religious objection - after all, money is the
root of all evil). The above system will only work so long as the
serfs accept their subordinate position. An Engineer\'s title depends
on his control of the life-support apparatus of his area, and trading
or selling it means losing control of that region. Anyone who gains
control of a region must be able to operate it\'s environmental systems,
as that is the basis of his rule there, whether that is personal
control or control of subordinates loyal to him - but the latter leaves
him open to betrayal and takeover by his subordinates.

This is just one example, and I hope it is a useful contribution to this
ever-expanding thread.

Quite possible. It was a judgement call wether the coyns had been modified
during the 2000-year Ancients period. Just as it was a judgement call that
the pre-Ancients didn\'t have more than one set of coyns. I decided in the
end that though coyns had been important during the Ancient period (as
evidenced by their widespread occurence in Ancient installations) they
had not been of such paramount importance as they became when casting
became dependent on them (In fact, a case could be made for the caste
coyns not being original, but that would leave me with six more to make
up).

Right. In my universe Grandfather (Or rather, those mysterious beings who
gave rise to the Grandfather myth) last revised the coyns around -1000.

I hadn\'t thought much about the interim sets. My players are on a Grand
Tour to a number of previously undetected Ancient sites in the Spinward
Marches (courtsey of a Hiver archeologist with an Ancient artifact) and
one of the stops will be Vanejen where the coyns failed to help the
Chirpers living there regain their ability to caste. Hence I\'ve concen-
trated on the Ancient sets the PCs will find in the sites and the first
coyn set that the Chirpers have kept for 75,000 years (quite a feat, that,
but all their coyn sets have 38 pieces  -  obviously an early variant).
Thanks for your ideas. They would certainly be relevnt for anyone
excavating old Droyne ruins (as opposed to Ancient ruins). Unless, that
is, Grandpop didn\'t take care to recall each old set every time he put
out a revised edition... ;-)

I\'ve imagined that the criterion Gramps used to choose was a sizable
number of planetary populations. That\'s why the Aslans are there in
spite of not having developed the jump drive themselves (Or perhaps
Gramps used the Major Race criterion and simply didn\'t realize that
the Aslans had \'cheated\').

Did they get off the planet in a big way?

Definitely a contender. But why would they be removed again? They are

And propably died out long before -75,000. Anyway, the Ancients propably
had lots of servant races. That\'s why I don\'t think the Vargr would be
on any Ancient coyns. Back then they were just one obscure experiment out
of many.

Primordials? What Primordials? They\'ve never been heard of in my universe.

And any humans quite different too. In fact, the human on the -75,000 coyn
set is IMO a \'homo antiquitus\', humans the way they looked in Ancient times.

My premise is that the last revision took place around -1000.

First if you are to deliver a lot of missiles at one target, the turrets
and barbettes for these has to be better. Something like the VLS system
to USS Ticonderoga. And missiles take up premium space. And the rapid
firing laser thingie mentioned later will stop almost anything that
approaches of missiles. Do you see any use in missiles with 200 armor
points? It leaves precious little space for controls, warhead and drive.

Why must the nuke impact? I believe the electromagnetic pulse generated
will do enough damage to most ships within several hundred kilometers.

Nope, never in a hundred years. Even a brainwashed soldier wouldn\'t do

The discussion has taken a very militaristic slant. What about the
traders and pirates? I don\'t believe merchants will have access to the
best missiles possible. Those available might even be built in a way
that prevents them from detonating in a gravity well, or close to it.
Else any crazy nut can hold a planet for ransome.

Anyway, what I would really like to do is revise the GURPS fire combat
rules to make them a little more streamlined and less overwhelming in
damage. The two biggest complaints I have about non-fantasy/lowtech GURPS
is:
        Gun stats are too detailed for quick play.
        Damage is excessive.

I find that the range mods in GURPS go up and down to quickly to keep good
track of accurately, especially if more than 4 people are involved. I also
concur with the excessive damage - I believe ultratech combat stats could
be scaled back a tad with no problem.

ANYWAY - I was wondering if anyone else had done this, or would be
interested in the results.

ALso, I\'d like to use FF&S to create Shadowrun weapons - far more difficult
because of the way Shadowrun does damage. Any takers?

A couple of differences:
        First of all, a shareholder is not responsible for the development
of the shares the CEO & assorted lackeys are. Secondly, from a more
romantic point of view, loyalty and fealty do not come from being paid off,
but from the heart - this is an ideal which is nice, but historically there
were probably more than a few lords & vassals who contemplated loyalty
based on personal gain.

        I think you\'ve been approaching Techno-Feudalism wrong from the
beginning. From what I\'ve read in this exchange, the CEO of a corp and the
Baron of a fief are being equated. But who\'s got the power? The CEO runs
things, but he must answer to the Board of Directors, who are in turn
selected by the dominant shareholders (usually). Granted, the Baron has to
have some level of consent from his vassals (and initial consent is
strengthened by years of tradition and faith in the ruling family).
However, while the Baron has legal authority over his vassals and subjects,
the CEO of Corporation X has no legal authority over the shareholders.

        IMHO it is the predominant shareholders who have the ultimate
authority in a FT. Rail Baron Getty invests and eventually controls 35% of
Getty Rails. *He* is the Baronial equivalent, and the other stockholders
have their own fiefs - parts of Getty Rails. But since Getty owns most of
the company, everyone agrees to follow his lead (most of the time) and
looks to him for leadership.
The CEO, the Board of Directors - these are but the minions of the
fiefholders who maintain the company, equivalent (perhaps) to the Sheriffs,
Castellans, and others who were granted authority but not fiefs.

        Now, rather than going to war to acquire more fiefs, Getty simply
invests in another company. This can lead to hostile takeovers, poison
pills, and all the other trendy economic actions involved in mergers &
buyouts. If it works, Getty gets a significant portion of another company\'s
stock. It may not be controlling interest, but then again, King Henry never
controll all or even most of France, either.
        The other shareholders can initiate their own dealings and
eventually acquire a power base outside the company - but Baron Getty might
be aware and could take steps to prevent them from getting far.

How\'s that for Feudal Technocracy?

My OED offers for technocracy: n. Organization an management of a countries

And for feudal system: medieval European form of government based on relation
of vassel and superior arising from holding land in feud.

and GDW offers the laconic definition for feudal technocracy:  Government by
specific individuals for those who agree to be ruled.  Relationships are based
on the performance of technical activities which are mutually beneficial.

Now David Johnson (if I have this straight) has argued for the equivalence of
"share fiefs" with "industrial fiefs".  I cannot accept this because a share
holder performs no TECHNICAL service for the corporation.    He provides
Capital and receives dividends and a measure of control.  I think this is
a more proper role for a Capitalist, not a Technocrat.

If, on the other hand, the ruler grants an industrial fief to a vassel the
vassel will have a technical role - managing the industry.  He must then
find "vassels" for the feifs within the plant, say the Information Systems
fief.

Thinking about this, I think perhaps the "Industrial Feudalism" of Mote Prime
(Niven & Pournelle) resembles a "Feudal Technocracy" as well.

As a side note, while Aristocratic terminology rang true for Piper\'s Sword
Worlds, it probably confuses the issue in this debate, since the historical
view of a Medieval Duke is of a person whose only skills were in military
matters; the feif itself was run by a paid employee.

More or less. But the discussion keeps shifting to new interesting aspects.
Now you\'re trying to suspend our disbelief in the notion that three different
UWP listings for the Spinward Marches made over a period of at least 12 years
could possibly have _all_ the population data identical.

>I merely stated that since there were changes to the UWP data over this

It is 17 years if your\'re talking about data from the earliest Traveller
background material (which didn\'t have population multipliers) and 12
years if you\'re talking about the three full listings I\'ve mentioned
before. The only change I know of (although there may be others; I\'ve
only spot checked) is Regina\'s change from TL 10 to TL 12, and it was
suggested that that was merely a correction of a typo.

>*and* the population and other figures were not changed that it must be
>*assumed* to have been done intentionally.

Only if there is no simpler explanation. I suggest that they are all three
based on the same census and that only the allegiance codes were updated
for the _Imperial Encyclopedia_ and the _Megatraveller Journal_ publications.
If there should be a few differences (and with a spot check of 10% of the
systems I didn\'t find a single one) I suggest that they are typos or
corections of typos.

Agreed. As a matter of fact I\'m of the opinion that the history of the
settlement of Charted Space does not make sense unless one postulates
that most well-developed worlds (not excluding the Aslan ones) practise
population control. But to go from there to the assumption that _all_
worlds in the Spinward Marches (a not yet developed area, after all)
practise it is IMO to go to far.

>Keep in mind as well that due to rounding conventions, a 10% increase (or

I\'m well aware of that. I used 10% as an average. Remember that roughly 10%
of the worlds should have a mantissa of X.4 (whatever X may be) and that in
that case considerably less than 10% increase is necessary to kick it over
into the next higher number. A world with a mantissa of 8.4, for example,
needs only a 1.2% increase to reach 8.5. Fulacin, a TL 5 world with a
population of 543 million in 1105 needs only a 1.3% increase. In 17 years!

>It\'s my impression that most worlds in the Spinward Marches are going to be

They certainly _ought_ to be, since they\'ve had up to ten centuries of
developement. Yet Spinward Marches is again and again referred to as a
\'frontier\'  -  not only in the \'frontier with other nations\' sense, but
also the \'developing area\' sense. Certainly scores of systems seems to
be woefully undeveloped.

>Furthermore, while one might expect high birth rates and low death rates

Now, are you SURE you\'re not allowing the discussion to affect your good
sense here? I would expect a lot of emigration FROM high-population planets
to developing low-population planets. That\'s usually the way it goes here
on Earth: From the crowded (or opressive) to the less crowded.

Oh, sure. But that should register too, shouldn\'t it?

Far more unlikely. I refer you to the examples of Forboldn, Fulacin, and
Vanejen. Each of them ought to have had changes in population, most likely
also TL and starport type in the case of the first two. In each case the
lack of change could be explained away. But it would have to be explained
AWAY. And my point is that if you need a new and distinct explanation for
each world you examine, then a simpler solution that explains them all is
to be preferred. I stand by my claim that the three different UWP listings
we have are one and the same (and one that was already somewhat out of date
in 1110).

                         incredible, surely?

I see no reason why both can\'t be true. Nevertheless, if you think that the
Zhodani help alone is sufficient (and I don\'t intend to dispute that) and
you don\'t believe the other then don\'t use it. (But I STILL think the
developement of the Spinward Marches has been slow, SLOW, *S*L*O*W*!!!)

I\'d say that it\'s the same kind of "possible" you get when you\'re talking
about all the air in a room suddenly collecting under one table. Sure, it\'s
*possible*. ;-)

The size of a unified economy, yes. But do you really think that the Mexican
economy is the more stable because of the size of the population of the US?

Oh, far, far from it. Orders of magnitude different. But then, I know
something of statistics and can\'t see the population thing happening in
a thousand years and have very little knowledge of economics and see no
difficulty at all in those economic swings. As for putting numbers on it,
that\'s difficult. But taking a wild stab I\'d say that at any given year at
least one in a hundred worlds inside the Imperium is getting shafted enough
by outside manipulation to be on the decline and several times that number
outside the Imperium. Exactly how long it takes for a downturn to affect
the TL is another difficulty. Not less than 10 years, I\'d say. And of course
a downturn would not always last long enough (As you can see, I\'m weaseling
like crazy. That\'s because I really know too little about economics to put
numbers on anything. But I\'ll have a shot at defending these ones).

Yes, but are you saying that 10 billion people have a greater difficulty
affecting 1 billion people than 1 billion people have affecting 100 million?
My guessing bone tells me that the proportions would remain roughly the
same.

Oh yes it is. This is one thing I\'m certain of (as defined by Traveller,
that is). There are scores of low-population worlds with a high-tech
classification that they couldn\'t _possibly_ maintain on their own
population base. In 1105 Fulacin ran a Type A starport and a TL of 13
with a population of 800. You couldn\'t even run a civilization with
half that TL with that. All these worlds must have their TLs artificially
maintained by outside sources.

The question is, are missiles of any use at all.  In the context of GDW\'s rules
(which is what I plan to go by) it is easy enough to armour capital ships over
the penetration limit off the 500Kt det-laser.  However, I do not think that the
potential damage to sensors and shields can be ignored, so some form of
point-defence is needed.

The benefit is that, by launching a missile attack against my opponent, even if
I cannot penetrate his defences, I am forcing him to either (1) use his main
weapons (which could otherwise be punching holes in my capital ships) to defeat
the attack or (2) allocate resourses at design time to either point defence or
specialized zone defence ships.

I am going to want some more BL experience before I commit myself to where the
tradeoff lies.

I think its a tautaulogy  that enough missiles can saturtate any defence.  You
just have to define enough as 1 + the number of missiles that could be destroyed
by 100% effective point defence fire.  I think your point is that it might not
be worth it, which is true.

Good question.  Much the same as the question Why Can\'t My Nuke Ever Impact.
Damned if I know, I didn\'t write the rules :-)

Well, chances are any crazy nut CAN hold a planet for ransom.

I do plan to play with these rules a bit.  None of the weapons I have seen in
TNE (I am still wating for BL) seem to rate very highly for fleet use.  Most of
the ships seem to be equivalent to light cutters with machine guns, and the
pirate equivalents.  I think major combat units will be quite a bit different.
One of the criteria I am using for hull design is the armour to defeat
penetration by any basic game laser.

Traveller 73 is worth picking up, if only for "Strange Lights Over
Hokum", a GREAT TNE adventure by Mike Mikesh (sp?  sorry!).  While set
in the TNE, it could easily be converted to any era, or GURPS Atomic
Horror :-) (I\'m busily trying to figure out how to convert it to
Space:1889 ;-)

"Hokum" should appeal to people on both lists: it\'s a non-combat
oriented adventure with high amusement value.  I can give more
specifics, but I hate posting spoilers.

Product Release Dates: Confusingly, GDW keeps listing all the TNE
stuff as if it\'s available.  I know the RC Equipment Guide is out,

    After reading much of your post, I think I am finally coming
understand your point of view -- not necessarily agree with it, but at
least understand it.  The question arises: what is the difference
between your view of "feudal technocracy" and laissez-faire
capitalism, or libertarianism?  If the government concerns itself
merely with external defense and preventing violent crime, and leaves
economic interactions to "market forces", how does that differ from
your picture of a "feudal technocracy"?

    Probably in much better shape.  Mexico\'s "formerly" socialist
habits of nationalizing industries and "protecting" the hell out of
them with tariffs, etc.  guaranteed inefficient, ineffective national
industries unable to compete against an efficient free-market economy.
With the opening up of Mexico, we are seeing more efficient,
competitive Mexican companies going into partnership with U.S.
companies and/or competing with them.

    I hate to burst your soap bubble, but the main thing keeping the
EU economy from dominating the world is the "intervention once again
of external government entities on both sides of the Atlantic".  The
socialist, interventionist policies of most European nations has
hobbled and crippled their economies to the point where most of these
economies are on the edge of collapse from spiraling budget deficits
and skyrocketing unemployment, all directly traceable to socialist
"tax the producers until they can\'t produce anymore and throw revenues
down a fiscal black hole" policies.
    It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the best way to make an
economy boom, and improve the standard of living for all is to provide
the basic legal foundations for entrepreneurship to flourish (i.e.,
establish and respect property rights), and then get the government
the hell out of the way!  Government intervention beyond protecting
property rights just gums up the works.  The U.S.  is productive IN
SPITE of the U.S.  Government; German corporations are productive in
spite of the German government, and in spite of the European Union.

    Excuse me for getting up on the soapbox, but I can\'t stand to see
outright misinformation spread about without some attempt at
correction.

>Having advanced from feudalism to capitalism, can we have a feudal
>structure again?

    It would be difficult at high-population levels, because feudalism
depends on the responsibilties of each individual to each other
individual, going up and down the ladder.  OTOH, many idealists have
postulated that in an enlightened society, the only "government" would
be that of each individual willingly carrying out his/her/its
responsiblities and obligations to other individuals above and below
him, a la feudalism.  I expect that a true Libertarian society would
appear feudal with class mobility.
    As for the concept that societies inevitably go from tribalism ->
feudalism -> capitalism -> communism, (if that\'s what you\'re referring
to) hasn\'t Marx been discredited yet?!?  :-)

Maybe, but I think `frontier\' might mean something quite `advanced\' in terms
of `development\' in a millenium-old interstellar empire.

No.  Most migrations are from rural areas to urban areas and result in
an increase in population in developed areas and a decrease in developing
areas.  Even in developed areas migration is only from the urban center
to the suburban fringe.  There is no sigificant migration from New York
City to rural Iowa, much less to rural Somalia.  There has been a great deal
of migration from rural Haiti and rural Central America to urban Florida,
California and Texas.  Similarly, migration in the Regency can be expected
to be from low-pop worlds to high-pop worlds.  This may not show up as
changes in population figures because *a lot* of folks from *a lot* of
low pop worlds would have to immigrate to Porozlo, say, before the population
number there changes much.

To some extent, yes.  I\'m not sure what you mean by `unified\'.  Do you mean
`isolated\' instead?

I\'m not sure I get your point.  If you mean could an economy of 1 billion
easily affect a neighboring economy of 100 million (assuming somewhat
equivalent tech levles), I\'d have to agree.  If you mean could an economy
of 1 billion cause severe *fluctuation* (enough to affect tech level) in
a neighboring economy of 100 million, I\'d have to say again that it\'s not
very likely.  The larger economy would have to fluctuate quite a lot to
do that.  This might be more pronounced in a 10 million economy or smaller
though.

Yes, yes.  I thought we\'d already agreed that these anomalies don\'t fit our

I think replying directly to specific quotes is beginning to stretch out
the discussion and making it difficult to maintain a coherent thread so
let me try to respond without quoting directly and then pick and choose
quotes `out of order\' as appropriate.  (If I miss an important point by
doing this please let me know.)

We seem to have spent a lot of effort discussing the `feudal\' portion of
feudal technocracy but not much discussing the `technocracy\'.  I\'ve tried
to suggest that a technocracy is much like a capitalist market economy but
haven\'t been very successful in describing how a technocracy is *different*
from a capitalist market economy.  The main difference as I see it is that
in a capitalist market economy there are government entities external to
the marketplace that provide the political framework which allows the
market economy to function.

Hans Ranke <rancke@diku.dk> asks for a definition of technocracy which
seems like a good place to start.

Grabbing a handy dictionary (I know others have already done this):

Technocracy: government by technicians, specifically management of society
  by technical experts.

This refers to the *nature* of authority.  It defines the ruling class.
What is meant by `technicians\' and `technical\' experts though?

Technical: having special, usually practical knowledge, especially of a
  mechanical or scientific subject.

This is the first of several definitions.  Of particular interest is the
sixth definition:

Technical: (6) resulting chiefly from internal market factors rather than
external influences.

This suggests a technocracy is a government where authority is exercised by
a class with specialized knowledge.  This knowledge is somehow practical,
scientific and related to market forces.  This suggests technology which is
the confluence of the practical application of science and the requisite
economic factors that permit that application.  Hence, technocracy is rule
by an industrial class based upon the `practice of technology\' - everything
that is required for technological endeavor.

A technocracy ties political power (government) to economic power (industry,
the `practice of technology\').  This is something much more sophisiticated
than mere government by engineers and scientists.  It takes much more than
just engineers and scientists to successfully run industry and an industrial
economy.

In contemporary market economies much of the political framework that
permits the industrial economy to function is provide by democratically
established governments that exist external to the economic system.
Furthermore, the basis for political power is also outside of the economic
system.  (Keep in mind the above `sixth\' definition of technocracy here.)
Thus, contemporary capitalist systems are not technocracies.

Nevetheless, any technocracy needs a political framework to permit the
functioning of the industrial economy.  To meet the requirements of a
technocracy this framework must arise from *within* the market place.
One way to do this is for the strongest economic actor to establish this
framework.  One might call this `autocratic technocracy\' or "what\'s good
for General Motors is good for planet Earth".

Another means might be to establish this framework through a formalized
system of well-defined relationships between the various actors in the
industrial economy.

Let\'s grab that dictionary again:

Feudalism: the system of political organization [prevailing in medieval
  Europe] having as its basis the relation of lord to vassal with all land
  held in fee and as chief characteristics homage, the service of tenants
  under arms and in court, wardship, and forfeiture.

Now medieval feudalism, as we\'ve already seen, was closely tied to the
the ownership of land.  This was the *nature* of the authority in a
medieval feudal structure - it defined the ruling class just as "specialized
knowledge" or industrial proficiency defines the ruling class in a
technocracy.

There was more to the feudal system though.  It was based upon "the relation
of lord and vassal" with respect to that which defined the the ruling class,
namely land.  The characteristics of fedualism (homage, service, wardship,
forfeiture, etc.) were all manifestations of this relationship between the
actors in the feudal system.  Feudalism provided the framework needed to
permit the fuedal economy to function.  It did this through a formalized
system of well-defined relationships between the various actors in the
feudal economy.

Sound familiar?  That\'s just the sort of thing that might provide the
political framework in a technocracy.

Whew!  I feel like I deserve some college credit for all that!  :-)

Okay, now let\'s look at some specifics of the discussion that might help
to further illustrate this point.

Hans writes:

Nation-states *are* the `external government entities\'.  They are not actors
*within* the industrial economy.

Of course not.  This is the essence of a capitalist market economy.  It\'s not
a technocracy though.

This misses the point.  First, there was not a capitalist system within
the Soviet Union.  In centrally-planned economies the government *is* an
*internal* entity in the economy but this most certainly is *not* an
`industrial economy\', i.e. one geared solely to the `practice of technology\'.
Centrally-planned economies have other goals such as full-employment.
Furthermore, *political* power is not tied to economic power but rather
is *superior* to economic power.  (Hence all the unprofitable but still-
powerful industrial actors in the former Soviet states.)

There is currently no entity (external *or* internal to the economy) within
the former Soviet states to provide a framework under which an industrial
economy can function.  Thus there is no legal framework to guarrantee
access to profits, rates of exchange, control of investment or any of the
other factors necessary to conduct profit-oriented industry.

[BTW, I\'m not claiming `industrial economy\' is `better\' than any other
system, I\'m just explaining what\'s necessary for it to function since I
see that as the goal of a technocracy.]

Exactly (except for the part about "without a government").  It is clear
from all of these examples that some sort of framework is needed.  In all
of these cases that framework is established by governmens acting external
to the industrial economy.  In the former Soviet states, in the European
Union, under GATT, the only recourse of any economic actor to seek redress
for mistreatment is through its own local governmental entity or through
structures established and enforced by its local governmental entity.
There are no agreements between, say, a Kazakh oil field and an Australian
drilling corporation, that are not enforced by some governmental entity
that exists *external* to the marketplace.

These are all elements of the capitalist system.  None of them are elements
of a technocracy.

> Of course one can have market systems without government supervision. Well,

You need someone to print currency, to establish procedures to guarrantee
control of investments and access to profits, to control monetary supplies
and rates or exchange, etc.  In capitalist market economies governmental
entities external to the market perform these functions.  Under technocracy
these functions are performed *internal* to the market.

Let\'s take for example this idea of a `technocractic lord\' `selling\' shares
in her enterprise to a `technocractic vassal\' in exchange for financial
capital.  Under a capitalist system the goverment prints that money and
guarrantees its value.  In a technocracy the lord and vassal must come
to some agreement themselves as to just what that `financial capital\'
is worth because the vassal (shareholder) doesn\'t have any `money\' to
`give\' to the lord (chairman).  In essence, money is nothing more than a
promise guarranteed by the government.  In a feudal technocracy, feudal
principals are used to guarrantee that `promise\' internally to the market.

I think that\'s enough for now.  I hope I\'ve made some progress in explaining
what, IMHO, a feudal technocracy is.  To recap:

1. The nature of authority: authority is exercised by those possessing
   specialized knowledge related to the practice of technology as manifest
   in an industrial economy.
2. Politcal power and thus the framework for the industrial economy must
   arise from *within* the industrial economy.
3. Feudal principles will be used to establish the framework through a
   system of well-defined relationships between the actors in the market.

Remember, it\'s feudal *technocracy*, not technocratic feudalism.

I see this `evidence of ownership\' as being analogous to the feudal title
granted by an aristocractic lord to his vassal tenants.  Ownership of a
portion of industry in a technocracy (a block of shares) is the same
as *tenancy* under the feudal system.

> Shareholders provide capital
> only once, when they buy.

No.  In a technocracy where there is no governmental entity external to the
industrial economy to print, manage and guarranty currency the shareholders
must have a well-defined and continuous relationship with the technocractic
lord in order to guarranty the value of and access to that capital.

> Fealty is loyalty.  How is the provision of money equivalent to loyalty?

In a technocracy there is no external entity to provide `money\'.  What
serves as currency in a technocratic system must be arranged through
agreement by the participants.  One might call the shareholders portion
of this agreement `loyalty\'.  The key is that the system requires inter-
dependent relationships between the actors - `lord\' and `vassal\'.

Don\'t confuse CEO and Chairman (and I have been guilty of this myself in
the past).  The CEO is just the `chamberlain\' who sees to the day to day
operations.  The Chairman is the technocratic lord.  An aristocratic
lord had a duty to his vassals to provide coordinated security services.
A technocractic lord (Chairman) has a duty to her vassals (shareholders)
to provide coordinated profit services.

Focus on the `duty\' rather than the more nebulous `loyalty\'.  IMHO, it\'s
important to examine how things such as `loyalty\' are manifest in order
to apply feudal principles to technocracy.

No.  I\'ve said this before.  There is no `inter-relatedness\' between
employee and employer.  The corporate model is a specialized form of
autocracy.  It is in no way feudal.

A block of the corporate enterprise is held in `tenancy\' in exchange for
the `service\' required to guarranty the access to and value of financial
capital.

See my previous post (TML 634/7959) for why this canonical definition is
so vague as to be virtually useless.

I\'d have to disagree.  A technocracy may not have to be capitalist but it
involves much more than the control of resources or a particular technology.
A technocracy is government by the class of individuals responsible for
the complete `practice of technology\'.  In a capitalist system this role
is played by the actors in the industrial economy (but these actors do
not have political power to match their economy power which is what makes
them different from technocrats).

> This actually is quite relevant. One characteristic of the feudal system

No.  Feudalism defined the relationships *between* the members of the
ruling class, not between the ruling class and the ruled classes.  Serfdom
occurred in concert with feudalism but was not part of feudalism.

> Capitalism and the rising mercantile
> class is what destroyed feudalism

No.  The rise of the mercantile class destroyed the feudal ruling class and
hence the framework of interactions between the members of that ruling
class, feudalism, disappeared.  Concurrent with the ascendancy of the
mercantile class was a separation of political power from economic power.
In a technocracy these two spheres of power are reunited.

> I will try to give an example of a non-capitalist FT.

Any system in which a group of elites control some crucial technology to
exercise control of the remaining populace is neither feudal nor
technocractic.  It\'s not feudal because there is no `inter-relatedness\'
between the participants and it\'s not technocratic because those who
control a particular critical technology are not involved in the `practice
of technology\'.

Nor was an aristocratic vassal responsible for providing coordinated
security services.  The `development\' of a technocratic fief (shares)
is associated with the responsibilites necessary to guarrantee the
value of and access to the capital provided to the technocratic lord.

> Secondly, from a more

And in a technocracy where the value of, access to and control of `money\'
must be guarranteed through the `agreements\' between `lord\' and `vassal\'
one might find some `romantic\' aspects for loyalty as well.

> However, while the Baron has legal authority over his vassals and subjects,

Well, first, again, the CEO is not the `technocratic lord\', the Chairman
is.  This `legal basis\' for any relationship in a capitalist market
economy is provided by the government entity external to the market. In
a technocracy there must be some relationship between the `lord\'
(Chairman) and the `vassals\' (shareholders)  that is developed among
themselves.  This is the basis for all `legal\' issues between them.  For
example, in a market economy the external government entity guarrantees
the value of the capital provided by the shareholder to the chairman.  In
a technocracy the `lord\' must have some means to ensure the value of and
access to this capital.  In a feudal technocracy, feudal agreements
between lord and vassal will do this.

This is no different from `Baron Gustaf\' who provides 35% of the military
forces in an aristocratic duchy.  This is what I\'ve been saying all along.
The shareholders are the equivalent of medieval feudal barons.

The CEO, yes.  The Chairman, no, because without the role of the external
government entity to enforce the `legal\' behavior of the Chairman this
person controls all of the financial capital provided by the shareholders.
The only way for the shareholders to guarrantee their own access to their
funds, in the absence of the external governmental entity, is through a
series of agreements with the technocratic lord (chairman).

Look at your OED definition of technocracy again.  It doesn\'t talk about
`technical service for a corporation\'.  It talks about `management of
industrial resources\', i.e. industrial holdings or `fiefs\'.

These are `proper roles\' for both.  The difference is that a capitalist
has a government entity external to the market to establish the framework
for interaction there.  A technocrat must establish this framework internal
to the market.  The most powerful technocrat can establish this framework
through fiat if she\'s powerful enough.  That might be called `autocratic
technocracy\'.  If there is no single technocrat powerful enough to establish
this framework herself then some system of agreements must be reached
among the various technocrats to establish the framework.  In a feudal
technocracy, feudal principles are used to establish this framework.

What does that have to do with it? If an authoritaive source makes a misprint,

It might make for migration from rural areas on low-pop worlds to urban areas
on the same worlds (always providing that such planets had urban areas). The
classic SF theme is from overcrowded planets to frontier planets. And the
only colonization project we have any knowledge of (The Forboldn Project,

An economy so tied together as to actively compensate for fluctuations in
production. A large country is less suceptible to a bad harvest because
the governing forces can transport food from areas not affected to areas
affected. If the same population was a number of isolated economies, the
very same harvest would cause some of these countries disaster despite
the total number of people involved being the same.

It fits my understanding perfectly. Some outsider brings in (or some local
imports) the machinery needed to produce some kind of high-tech stuff from
local raw materials. As long as the factory is functioning that planet is
effectively of the equivalent tech level  -  even if the factory has to
be maintained with imported spare parts.

Here\'s the fallacy. Nothing in the definition requires the expertise to be
economic. Sure, it _could_ be  -  if economy is accepted as a science with
an associated technology. Focussing on the sixth most common meaning on a
word to the exclusion of all other meanings seems very specious. I\'d be
happier if you could include some of the more common meanings too. The
definition of technocracy didn\'t say "see _Technical_ (6)", did it? Any
society managed by technical experts would seem to fit.

(By definition). However, a merenment by engineers and scientis isenough to satisfy the definition and is therefor a technocracy. Stick with thebroad definitions.

Li the man who ges o run the factory is under a specific obligation to

There\'s a small, but important difference between ownership and tenancy that

tenancy you don\'t).

Leaving aside that you can have technocracy with or without a government and
that you can have money with or without government and government with or
without currency (I use \'currency\' as \'government-backed\' money here)...
hmmm... leaving that aside there\'s not much left of that argument...

I can\'t keep repeating myself each time this comes up, so from now on

Not \'must be\'. \'Can be\'. One company could put out money backed by its

Or government-backed money. There are lots of possibilities.

So the socalled shareholders does not provide any goods or capital? This
begins to resemble my notions more and more.

Absolutely right. Otherwise it\'s not a feudal arrangement. But by now you
can drop the quotes around lord and vassal. If the vassal dosen\'t buy the
\'share\' then he is a vassal and his lord a lord.

>The Chairman is the technocratic lord.  An aristocratic lord had a duty to
>his vassals to provide coordinated security services.

That\'s true enough. _In addition_ to giving out the fief in exchange for
the loyalty of the vassal the lord also assumed the duty to protect his
vassal.

>A technocractic lord (Chairman) has a duty to her vassals (shareholders)
>to provide coordinated profit services.

That makes sense. In addition to giving them their fiefs she also assumes
the duty to protect them financially. A good analogy. Of course, the
crucial part of the feudal relationship is the providing of the fiefs,
since lots of other systems require the leader to protect the followers.
In fact, I can\'t think of any that dosen\'t.

>Focus on the `duty\' rather than the more nebulous `loyalty\'.

Not a good idea. In a feudal relationship both sides have duties to the
other part, so you can\'t say who\'s the lord and who\'s the vassal from
that.

>A block of the corporate enterprise is held in `tenancy\' in exchange for
>the `service\' required to guarranty the access to and value of financial
>capital.

This is pure gibberish. Oh, sorry! I mean, I don\'t understand a word you\'re
saying here. Could you put it in layman\'s terms?

Ohhh noooo someone is trying to put the science in my sci fi.  I don\'t
entirely agree with the difficulty in laser communicators (also FFS has
maser and meson communicators that are also tight-beam) but you are
correct about comm lags over a distance.  Possibly an electronics
/control craft would need to accompany each squadron.

Insomuch as keeping comm links with the remotely piloted vehicles (rpv)
should you lose contact the rpv should have rudimentary programming to
either allow it to continue the mission or break off and withdraw to a
programmed marshalling point.   Also a radio backup could come online to
attempt recommunication before switching back to tight-beam modes.

Also my theoretical tender/carrier would have an extensive suite of all
the best electronic/communication gear that would enable it to monitor
the precise location of all craft invloved in the action, especially its
rpvs, so if a comm lock was momentarily lost with a particular unit its
position could be scanned, adjusted for its vector, and tight-beam comm
reestablished.

Unless I missed an important section of the official rules nothing is
mentioned in either TNE or FFS about communication lags (which I agree
would definitely exist) or major difficulties with maintaining laser (or
maser, meson) communications.

Younger sons/daughters of Regency nobles and/or ihatai upset at the
limited opportunities for advancement within the ranks of nobility and
also the acquisition of new systems as fiefs.  This is somewhat related
to the anti-democratic reform movement.

I never ruled out that this function was performed by the nobility of
the Regency.  Although I would think one of the initial reforms of
democracy would be to remove the power of the nobility from the courts.

This provides some interesting role-playing opportunities.  I don\'t know
of any gov\'t/military organization that orders a particular piece of
equipment (that need to be replaced) to be immediately removed and
destroyed and the replacement issued to every single unit/ship/person
that works with that equipment.

It would seem that while the units on the frontline might immediately be
equipped with VIRUS-safe comps reserve units and those on the Spinward
border would almost certainly not.  It is also doubtful that the
frontline units would universally received such improved equipment.  No
doubt a great deal of jury-rigged comps are being used.

Now imagine a group of players venturing forth against a possible VIRUS
hazard.  Is the equipment they are issued protected against the VIRUS?
If jury-rigged is the performance downgraded?  How successful is the
jury-rigging?  Not to mention that it is rare for a piece of equipment
to work as advertised when it is state-of-the-art,  the bugs always have
to be worked out:)

Regarding the possibility that the Regency military (regular navy) is
involved in VIRUS actions it is my opinion that if they are it is only
in a reservce capacity.  The Regency Quarantine Service was established
to perform this duty (by guarding and maintaining the quarantine zone
[gee doesn\'t that sound like the Neutral Zone?]) but if a major invasion
by a Vampire fleet were identified no doubt the RQS could call upon Navy
fleets to meet this threat.  Possibly the protocols for calling on Navy
assistance were inadequately implemented when the Rape of Trin occurred.

Just my Cr2 worth.

    'body' => 'CASUAL ENCOUNTER:    SHIP\'S CATS

        There is a breed of cats called "Ship\'s Cats" that have
been specifically bred to serve on space ships. There have been
small amounts of genetic tinkering in their line. This has mainly
been changes to their instinctual reactions to certain things.
Of course the original product has interbred and changed over time
leaving a species which is partially engineered and partially
adapted.
        Ship\'s Cats can deal well with changes in gravity and
can cope quite well in zero-G. Most understand standard "brace
for acceleration" warnings and can act accordingly. Special
cat-spacesuits are available on the market and it takes minimal
training for a cat to learn how to get in and seal themselves.
        Although they are still competent at chasing out small
vermin of a variety of species (which *still* can cause problems
on ships) they are less skilled at this than their terrestrial
companions. They do have a keen sensitivity to changes in
pressure and electrical disturbances. Often their behaviour can
point to potential problems.
        They tend to understand the difference between Crew and
Passengers and are good at not being seen by people who would not
appreciate seeing them. Exceptional specimens can even distinguish
between High and Middle passengers.
        Ships Cats are more restrained in their breeding habits.
They tend to remain infertile for long periods during travel.
They will come into heat when at dock for an extended period,
such as during annual maintenance. Also if they are with another
animal that is not a near relation they will move into a breeding
cycle. Their ability to distinguish relations is based on scent
and makes it safe to have more than one cat from one family on
a ship.
        The offspring of these family units are highly sought
after. Many of their skills are learned from their parents and
the type of ship they were raised on. As such there are Navy
breeds, Merchant breeds, etc, etc. Certain family lines are
widely known and the subject of idle dockside talk.
        Most spaceports allow registered ship\'s cats into
their extrality zone with the same processing as for crew.
All such animals must be identified, though.

        Moving from the general to the specific, my players had
a Ship\'s Cat for ages but lost it due to various events. At one
point they decided they wanted another. Nothing specifically
notable happened with their first one, it was just generally
useful. However they decided to buy their next one at a small pop,
tech level G spaceport. I decided that the selection was limited
and give them three choices.
        The first was a fairly mangy looking beast. This, of
course was the best buy, being an authentic experienced cat. They
could have got it at a good price as the sales people didn\'t think
much of it.
        The second was basically your standard Terrestrial Model
Russian Blue. Pretty, pedigree, and pretty expensive. But,
just a cat.
        The third was just for laughs: a cross-eyed neurotic
Siamese with a god-awful throaty meow. Moderate in price.
        What do the players go for? The bloody Siamese! They
named it "Crosby" because of the eyes and thought it was
cute as it wandered around bumping into things.
        It has, of course, been no end of trouble for them.
Crosby has a knack of turning up in the wrong place at the
wrong time. Perhaps it has some of the Ship\'s Cat\'s genes
bred into it: in reverse. Usually it announces its presence
in such a circumstance with its throaty yowl.
        It sat on passenger\'s breakfasts. It crapped in the
marine\'s shoes. It managed to get into the Exec\'s shower
cubicle and turned it on without being discovered for several
hours.
        In one circumstance the players were involved in a
sniper fight in a crashed spaceship on a planets surface.
Suddenly, on their internal speaker channel they hear Crosby\'s
familiar yowl. "It must be warning us!" they decide and
send some of them racing back to the ship (parked nearby)
to see what was up. When they got there Crosby was sitting
on the bridge console playing with the pretty lights.
        Later they were making a tension filled landing
on the base of a dubious genetic lab under threat of
a laser battery (see the Critter follow-up posted earlier)
with a critically wounded passenger. Just as they are
committing to landing up jumps Crosby onto the bridge
console as pleasantly as your own moggy jumps on they
Sunday paper you are trying to read.
        They began wondering how Crosby, who could barely
walk in a straight line, could keep getting into places
that were crew-locked. Eventually they found out the
ship\'s Chief Steward had entered Crosby onto the database
as ship\'s crew for tax reasons. This meant that the
ships computer considered Crosby crew. Crosby\'s yowls
matched no known language recognition so the ship had
dutifully engaged the self learning language ability
and tried to comprehend the feline utterances as orders.
Of course, it frequently got it wrong. So far the worst
Crosby has managed to do was lock everyone off the ship.
It hasn\'t found the right pitch for self-destruct just
yet...

I will post some designs in the next weeks. I\'m preparing some sessions for next
weekends large con in germany, FeenCon in Bonn Bad Godesberg, so I\'m a bit busy.
Because I like High Tech designs using Thruster Plates, I did some odd things
like a Fighter of less than one displacement ton. Think of it, using EMS Jammer
and EMM it\'s impossible to detect (Submicro: +2 to detect against active and
passiv EMS, EMM +1 against EMS, EMS Jammer: an additional +1 or +2 (depends on
TL of sensing ship) is: +4 or +5 to difficulty. If the fighter is in short range
the base difficulty is Average + 4 diff level = 1 more than impossible, so no
task allowed). At the moment I check if I can do this using fusion power plant
instead of the currently installed MAA plant.

I saw several submissions of weapons in this list, but what I need are some
stats like in RC Equipment Guide (I just don\'t bother the design sequence, I\'m
just too lazy to design small arms. I stick to Starships and Vehicles).

Once again Phil Pugliese <PPUGLIESE@pimacc.pima.edu> has chosen to insult
me on the TML because he doesn\'t like what I have to say.  Frankly, I\'m
getting a little tired of this.  I find it incredible that this guy can
bitch about wasting bandwidth at the same time he\'s hurling personal
insults!

To set the record straight on the Feudal Technocracy thread, this discussion
went off-line almost *immediately* as soon as folks expressed some dismay
at its lengthiness and relevancy.  My last posts on the matter appeared
the *same* night as the first request by Andy Lilly that the discussion
move off-line.  The last feudal technocracy post to appear from *anyone*
appeared the night immediately following Andy\'s request.  Furthermore,
while there have only been three (3) requests to move the discussion off-
line (including that cretin Phil\'s) there have been *at least* ten (10)
TML members who have contributed constructively to the discussion.

So please, Phil, will you crawl back under your rock?  I thought you had
run away to XTML anyway?

P.S.  Sorry, folks, but I suspect this creep is really going to start
      wasting everyone\'s bandwidth now.  Rest assured though, this will
      be *my* last post on the matter.

  The Society of Space Breathers

  "Really, the odds were against it.  How often would you expect to
  come out of jump right in the path of a rogue missile?
  Fortunately, the Navy ship that had fired it (it was a test
  firing) had disarmed the warhead - it just punctured the
  Engineering chamber, and knocked out all power to all systems.
  Fortunately, there was a battery-powered radio with a good chunk
  of range; we were able to get a squawk out on it, and the Navy
  ship came into the area at max.

  "That\'s when we found out that (a) somehow all the spacesuit
  locker doors were jammed shut, and (b) there was no airlock that
  the Navy ship could successfully attach a "hose" to.  The one
  functional airlock (because it could be manually operated -
  except the air pumps) could handle _one_ spacesuit at a time.
  Period.  We weren\'t getting out of this one so easy.

  "Fortunately, the Navy ship was close by, and we had "Slipstick"
  Smith, who could calculate in his head like you wouldn\'t believe.
  What?  Oh, why was he called "Slipstick"?  Well, he had a habit
  of fiddling with some old toy of some sort that he had, when he
  calculated stuff for us in his head - said he could do math on
  it, but that\'s not possible; it was just a wooden board with a
  couple of sliding pieces on it.  I looked at it once; it had a
  bunch of numbers on it, but they were just painted on.  No
  buttons, no readout, no nothing.  Tell me how you do math on
  that, bright boy.

  "Anyway, Slipstick figures out that (a) a man can hold his breath
  long enough to jump from our ship to theirs, and (b) we won\'t
  lose enough air total to hurt by passing through the airlock
  without pumping it down first.  Especially since we\'re not gonna
  stay on the ship longer than we have to, anyway.

  "That\'s when Doc chimes in.  She says that we\'ll explode if we
  try to hold in a breath while making the jump, and Slipstick is
  just plain looney.  Slipstick turns to her and asks how long a
  person can survive after exhaling before he _has_ to inhale
  again.  Turns out that we had plenty of time to do it that way,
  too.

  "Well, you can guess the rest.  As a precaution, Doc told us each
  to hyperventilate before blowing the air in the lock, and don\'t
  worry about trying not to breathe - it won\'t matter once the air
  is gone.  But jump as fast and straight as you can...  We all
  made it; didn\'t lose a soul.  The Navy was surprised that we\'d
  risk it, but when we told \'em that the air was leaking out, and
  we had to do something, they allowed as how maybe it would work.
  But they\'d put a guy on a tether out there just in case.  Didn\'t
  need him, but..."

  That is how the Society of Space Breathers got its start.  It
  was not any kind of formal organization initially, just a group
  of people with a shared experience that was well out of the
  ordinary.  The organization was formalized at a dinner hosted by
  (then) Duke (of Regina) Norris Aella Aledon, later the Archduke
  of the Domain of Deneb, and the First Regent.  Anecdotal evidence
  says that it was a "roast" of some high Naval officers, and a
  "play" was put on by a few of the Duke\'s retainers, spoofing on
  how the Navy likes to give out awards, and one of the awards was
  for "Heroic Sacrifice of Respiratory Rations".  (Un?)Fortunately,
  the Duke knew about the rescue, and liked the idea.  Not long
  afterward, he sent the first "Space Breather" ribbons to the
  survivors of the disaster, and empowered any ship\'s commanding
  officer, in any service or none, to give the "award" for any
  rescue where the qualifications were met.

  The qualifications established are:

  1) The recipients have made an unaided transfer from one ship to
  another, 2) as the recipient of emergency assistance to a
  disabled vessel, 3) without benefit of any protective clothing,
  breathing apparatus, portable airlock, rescue ball, life pod, et
  cetera, 4) outside the limits of atmosphere.

  The award itself consists of a strip of ribbon (really
  holorecord tape), in "space black", with the name of the rescued
  ship and the date of rescue imprinted on it in gold or silver.
  It is worn hanging from a lapel pin or military ribbon pin, whose
  design is at the wearer\'s discretion.  Most wearers pick one of a
  limited set of pins which have developed into symbols of
  breathing space.  Military and paramilitary recipients generally
  wear the ribbon descending from a standard ribbon pin with no
  ribbon depiction.  Droyne recipients favor a pin with a replica
  of the "Void" coyn.  Aslan wear an intricate monogrammatic
  representation of the Trokh inscriptions for "Breath" and "Space"
  intertwined (note that it is in the "male" script, even when the
  recipient is female).  Vargr and Non-(para)military recipients
  wear a variety of pins, but the most common motifs seem to be
  either a pin with no "face" attached at all, or a four-pointed
  star, although on worlds with Droyne population, the Void coyn
  design is also popular.

    'ts-index' => '1994-06-22.am410',
    'body' => '        I realize this is probably a foolish thing to do, but nevertheless
I am compelled to dive into two ongoing controversies on this mailing
list:  the nature of a feudal technocracy and the reasoning behind x-ray
laser missiles.

        First:  Feudal Technocracies.  This government type has been
perplexing me ever since I first read Book 3 of the original _Traveller_
set.  For a while I thought it might mean knights-and-lasers, then (after
reading Niven and Pournelle\'s _Oath of Fealty_) I assumed it was a
patriarchal sort of corporate state.
        But then I got to thinking about the meanings of the two words.  A
feudal system is one in which there is no distinction between economic and
political roles -- the nobles control the basis of wealth (land), and the
more land you own, the bigger and more important a noble you are.
Relationships are determined by personal ties rather than by institutional
offices.
        A technocracy is a system in which governing tasks are performed
by experts, selected on the basis of training and expertise.  The exact
mechanism has never been specified, so a technocracy could be elective,
hereditary, appointive, or whatever.
        Putting the two into the Cuisinart and turning it to "high"
produces the following scenario:
        A feudal technocracy is one in which _knowledge_ is the
fundamental basis of economic and political power.  (Perfect for an
"information economy" by the way.)  Individuals control access to stores
of information which they possess, and those with greater supplies of data
are more powerful.  In place of feudal oaths we have the equivalent of
copyrights and patents (which, interestingly enough, descends from the
"letters of patent" granted to new nobility).
        So here I am, a feudal-tech baron.  What do I do?  I own (say) the
patent on role-playing games.  Anybody who wants to produce them must
become my vassal, and give me a share of the profits.  If I am a smart
baron, I will use much of my resources to expand my "data fief" through
research and development, buying-out of smaller holders, education, etc.
Note that feudal barons occasionally had to defend their rights by force;
as a Techno-baron I must do the same, by sending goons to beat up
unauthorized users of my role-playing patent.  Similarly, I can try to
steal other baron\'s information holdings -- by all the usual methods so
familiar to readers of cyberpunk fiction.
        What appeals to me about this model is that it is _plausible_.  I
can see it developing already in the current fight over the "Information
superhighway" and control of movie libraries.  None of the other f-tech
societies made much sense.  I offer this for constructive criticism and
opinions.  Flames and gripes will be sneered at.

        Forging bravely ahead, I will now deal with the Missile Question:
This one is fairly simple.  A nuke in space is not really much good unless
you get it very close to the target; on the order of a few hundred meters.
 A real nuke does its damage by shockwave, and there just _isnt_ any blast
wave in space.  (Well, yes, you do get a cloud of plasma ejected by the
bomb, but its mass is small and it dissipates rapidly.)  Radiation flash
effects dissipate following the inverse-square law, so even they fall off
fairly quickly (and remember that ships will be shielded against radiation
anyway).  To damage an enemy ship with a nuclear missile, you need
fantastically good tracking and prediction electronics, a _huge_ warhead,
on the order of 10 or 100 megatons, and a vast amount of fuel, so that it
can chase down the target and get close enough to do damage.
        Contrast this with the x-ray laser missile.  It uses a smallish
warhead (500 ktons max), which is nice if you worry about somebody using
one as a bomb.  It delivers its energy across a large distance without
attenuation; so the missile merely needs to get in the same hex as the
target (recall that Brilliant Lances hexes are 30,000 kilometers across).
It delivers the damage at lightspeed, so doesn\'t need to catch up to the
target before going off.
        Want some "real-life" proof?  The SDI organization picked nuke-det
laser bombs as the weapon of choice against incoming missiles.  They could
have chosen plain nukes, but x-ray lasers did the job better.

This model removes the military from the actual government structure.
Previous information on the Imperium has suggested that while the
nobility meddles in the military, the military generally remains outside
the political system except in times of severe stress like the (First)
Civil War.  Even in the Rebellion, we did not see the military itself
as a player in the political struggle (despite my earlier comments to this
effect).

The legislative branch retains the noble Moot and the popularly-elected
Senate.  The model retains the Imperial tradition of the nobility as being
responsible for judicial functions rather than the Regent-appointed courts
suggested by Wes.  The executive branch includes both the Regenct-appointed
executives and the traditional nobility.

Senate review is limited to executives appointed by the Regent.

I suggest the following rationale for the rise of Regent-appointed executives.
Under the Imperium all noble patents came from the authority of the Emperor.
In the Regency there is no such clear authority to serve as the source of
noble patents.  Therefore, the Regent has appointed Governors (for subsectors)
and Residents (for worlds) when vacancies have appeared in the noble ranks
as surrogate executives pending the `restoration\' of the Empire.  In actual
practice, these executives permit the Regent to establish a loyal power base
independent of the nobility.  The nobility has grudgingly accepted this in
the absence of an Emperor to replenish the noble ranks.

This system avoids noble and Regenct-appointed executives having the same
jurisdiction.

Comments, critiques and accolades are encouraged.

         consists of two chambers, the Moot and the Senate, which share
         power.  The judicial branch consists of a series of appeals courts
         of varying power, and executive branch consists of the various
         Governors.  The military is not a separate branch, but is not
         beholden to the other branches.  The Regent is the highest level
         of authority for each branch.

         At the top of this hierarchy, wielding the highest power of the
         executive, legislative, judicial and military branches, is the
         Regent.  The office is held for life and passed on to the
         designated heir.  The Regent appoints candidates to all executive
         and judical posts on the sector and subsector levels, subject to
         confirmation by the Senate.  The armed forces are controlled
         directly by the Regent with no oversight by the Senate or the
         Moot.  The titles held by the Regent include, but are not limited
         to:  Lord Regent of the Third Imperium, Archduke of Deneb,
         President of the Senate, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Navy,
         and Supreme Marshall of the Imperial Army.

         The Moot is the senior chamber of the legislative branch, composed
         of the peers of baronial rank and higher in the realm who serve as
         long as they maintain their title (usually for life, although
         abdications do occur).  There is approximately one noble per
         planet in the Regency, and as such, the Moot tends to favor the
         rights of lower population worlds.  The members of the Moot are
         predominantly human.  Although the Moot does vote to confirm the
         succession to the Regency, this power is mitigated by the fact
         that they can only vote for, not against a new Regent.
         Politically the Moot tends to be dominated by the Aristocratic,
         Imperiallist and Sovreignist blocks.

         The Senate is technically the junior chamber of the legislature,
         although in fact it is more active politcally than the Moot.
         Senators are popularly elected representatives of Senatorial
         Districts of approximately 1 billion sophonts.  Being based on
         population, these districts can vary in size from a portion of a
         world to a dozen or more entire worlds.  Because of this, the
         Senate tends to favor the high population worlds, where some 96%
         of the Regency\'s population live.  In addition, the Senate is a
         more cosmopolitan body, with 29 Llelywolly Senators from Junidy,
         11 Gl\'lu Senators from Kibushish, one Ebokin Senator from Yebab,
         several Aslan Senators from the spinward regions, and even one
         Chirper Senator from Vanejeen.  Senators serve 10 year terms, and
         may be elected to no more than 3 terms in succession.  The Senate
         has the power to confirm or reject all appointments to the
         Judicial and Executive branches made by the Regent. Unsuprisingly,
         the Senate tends to hold Democratic/Interventionist views.

         The judicial branch exists to decide when (or if) Regency law has
         been violated, and consisists of a series of courts at various
         levels that have the ability to review the decisions of courts at
         lower levels. The lowest level are the Regency District Courts,
         corresponding to the Senatorial Districts.  These courts are the
         base of Regency law, and spend much of their time hearing local
         cases dealing with conflicts between Regency law and the local
         laws.  Decisions of the District Courts may be appealed to the
         Subsector Appeals Court, which can in turn lead to an appeal to
         the Regent\'s Court on Mora.  The final avenue of appeal is
         directly to the Regent, who can reverse the decision of any
         Regency Court.  Justices of the District Courts are elected from
         the district.  Justices of the Appeals and Regent\'s courts are
         appointed by the Regent for indefinite terms, but are subject to
         confirmation by the Senate.  They may be removed from office by
         the Regent, or by a vote of the Senate.

         The executive branch consists of the Subsector Governors appointed
         by the Regent and confirmed by the Senate, and Planetary Governors
         appointed by the Senate.  It\'s purpose is to ensure that the will
         of the Senate and of the Regent is carried out.  Thus the
         Governors are responsible for collection of taxes, implementation
         of policy and enforcement of Regency law.

         The military in the Regency is not an actual branch of the
         government, but it funtions in many was as such.  The head of the
         military is the Regent, and under him are the Admirals and
         Marshals of the Realm.  Each Sub-Sector has a Fleet admiral
         assigned to it, and each high population world has a Reserve
         Admiral in charge of the reserve fleet, and a General in charge of
         the planet\'s ground forces.  The military, through the person of
         the Regent (undoubtedly with advice from the Senate and the Moot),
         has the right to decide when to wage war or make peace.  It is
         effectively outside the the control of the Senate, the Moot and
         the Governors on most matters.  The military is, however, bound to
         uphold Regency law, and thus must obey decisions of the judiciary.

David Johnson <djohnson@mms403.jsc.nasa.gov> writes:

This suggests the aristocracy has given up its traditional judicial role
held under the Imperium.  This is a major change that represents a major
loss of power for the nobility.  Is there a rationale for this loss?

This represents another loss of power for the nobility.  One wonders just
what the nobility does in the Regency?  And more importantly, how they came
to lose such influence?

This is a good idea but I\'m not sure how to rectify it with the inclusion
of barons in the Moot.  (And I don\'t see how barons could be excluded either.)
Maybe there is a way to deal with this by adjusting the population levels
for the Senate districts.  How many Senators are there in the Regency at one
per billion population?  Lowering this number to one per half billion (or
less) would increase the number of Senators (and correspondingly the
influence of hi-pop worlds) with repsect to the barons of the Moot.

Electing Senators at-large in any of these mulit-billion districts would
further enhance the influence of hi-pop worlds.  In your example one might
expect Pixie, Yres and Boughene (and possibly part of Menorb) to be included
as one sub-district (and thereby give the smaller worlds a chance at some
representation).  On the other hand, three at-large Senators would all be
likely to come from Menorb.

This is some great work.  I might suggest as a modification leaving the
judicial function in the hands of the nobility.  (They\'ve already been
weakened by the appearance of the Senate abd it doesn\'t really affect the
split in the power structure you\'ve outlined.)  Furthermore, the Regent\'s
Governors (subsector and world) are also a big threat to the nobles.  They
also seem to be in direct conflict.  (What\'s the relationship between the
Duke of Vincennes and the Subsector Governor or the Marquise of Efate and
the Planetary Governor?)  Maybe these Regency executives only exist in fiefs
where the noble patents have been vacated, either through death without
issue or through the dislocations resulting from the Rebellion and the Viral
Assault?  Possibly, for example, there is no longer a Marquis of Glisten
but rather an *ihatei* Governor (I\'d prefer `Resident\' for worlds to
distinguish them from a subsector Governor) who was appointed by the Regent
when Glisten came back `into the fold\'.

Keep in mind that the separation of the military from the political
process is a decidedly modern, Western idea.  For most of human history
and still in many places today the military is a key player in the
political process.  This is also a part of the Imperial tradition.
Remember the Civil War and even the Rebellion.  This latter though,
might have led to some poltical efforts to *limit* the influence of
the military.  This might have been one of the ways the power of the
nobility was weakened.  Much of the power of the nobility has been
embodied in the military in the past.

*POT* apparently has a table of all RC worlds, their populations, political
bloc and number of representatives.  Anyone care to post a list of Regency
worlds with populations (maybe Roger\'s hypertext can help here?) and we can
work on representatives from there?

Note to the Kind XTML Admin:
I have had difficulty posting to the XTML. This is my third post 
and each time has required at least two attempts. No bounces,
they just get swallowed up in the void that is sunbane.

Just thought you should know
message follows ...


Hi All,

This is the second CT adventure from my mid 1980\'s campaign that
I\'ve uploaded to the XTML. I\'d like to follow this with more but
the rest of them require formatting and editing. Add in the 
possibility of my wife going into labor any day now and you may 
not here from me for a month or more.

So, unless I hear howls of anguish from the XTML, I\'ll continue.


A few background notes:

I wrote this after seeing a movie set in the late 1800\'s. I can\'t
recall the name at the moment. It involved a British agent trying
to counter Russian influence in the Black Sea region. I had always
used a 1800\'s flavor in my campaign, so this seemed like a natural
scenario to use.  

The Rhalta Domain is an aristocracy with a free economy. It is the
premier naval power of the sector, and the only power with a TL 15
fleet. Access to the nobility by the citizens has improved following 
two revolts in the past 200 years. Most military and foreign policy 
moves are made to support economic growth. The megacorporation 
Molke Heavy Industrial Inc. has significant influence in the 
government.

The Malek Technium is an aristocratic technocracy with a state 
managed economy. It maintains control over its population by
controlling the technology available. This has hindered the
economic growth of several worlds. This state was founded by 
corsairs and refugees from the Rhalta Domain. Two wars have been 
fought against the Rhalta Domain in the past 100 years, without a
decisive winner. The Malek Technium continues to sponsor corsairs
which prey on Rhaltan shipping.



- ---- hack-n-slash here ----


Scenario - Maiskin Extraction 

Contract 
A Rhaltan Naval Captain, Jarek Taggart, offers a lucrative contract
to retrieve an agent operating in the Malek Technium. He is to be
picked up on Maiskin, a known base for corsairs operating in the
perimeter. Graek should be delivered to Sentinel for transfer to a
Rhalta Domain destroyer escort. Taggart offers 500,000 Cr plus
expenses. He will go as high as 750,000 Cr and throw in a lucrative
cargo if required.

Background
Deputy Defense Advisor Miklas Graek has supplied the Rhalta Domain
with informative though routine updates on MT activities in the
Jhourae subsector for the past five years. His latest bulletin
detailed plans for a MT forward outpost in the Muvauri system, which
would be a violation of the Jhourae Concords. Graek will be revealed
if the Rhalta Domain acts upon his information. Therefore, Graek is
to be extracted prior to any Rhalta Domain countermeasures. He is
currently on a diplomatic tour of the perimeter systems.

Captain Taggart will arrange for the players\' starship to be
restocked, refueled, and loaded with a sufficiently suspicious cargo
to permit them to pass as corsairs. Once they reach Maiskin, the team
will have to contact Graek and help him elude his bodyguards. Within
two hours of his disappearance, Graek\'s security officer will coerce
port officials to delay departure authorizations until a search can
be completed. If the players have not left before the search begins,
they will notice that they are held in standby indefinitely.
Unauthorized departure may be considered as a desperate alternative
to hiding Graek from the search parties. If the starship leaves the
port without being searched, either through early or unauthorized
departure, a Crusaeder class defense cruiser will attempt to stop and
board them before they reach the 100 Diameter jump point. 

MT Defense Cruiser      
Crusaeder   IDC-B4348G2-450300-80008-0   1533.3 MCr       2 Ktons
   batteries bearing     2     2   1        Crew = 20
   batteries             2     2   1        TL = 13 
Pass = 0. Low = 0. Marines = 10. Cargo = 89. Fuel = 760. EP = 160.
Agility = 4. Craft = cutter.

If the party successfully makes the jump to Sentinel, Malek Technium
ships will jump to all probable destinations. If the players are ahead
of schedule, they may seek refuge in the asteroid belt until the
transfer occurs. 

An operative for the MT working in the Rhalta Domain Naval command has
delayed the orders for the DE to meet the players. The tampering will
appear to be a data transmission error. The discrepancy will be found
when the orders are reviewed. The players must survive 1D6 days in
the asteroid field before the DE arrives. The Crusaeder DC will
conduct scans for 1D6 days before assuming that the players\' ship
jumped to a different system.

Your penance is public humiliation, caning with a 3\' long clear plastic
DIP package mailer, and thirty lashes with UTP type 5 Twisted Pair

I like it.  How\'s this?

In order to be appear in the digest, messages must contain one or more
codes (listed below) embedded in the Subject line, seperated from the
rest of the text by a non-alphabetic character. These codes are used by
the digester to create custom, filtered digests. For example, the
following would appear in digests filtered to include Classic Traveller
and 3rd Imperium messages:

        Subject: CT,IMP: How many Ancients can dance on the head of a pin?

_____RULESET______ ______ERA_______  ________GENERAL________ ____DESIGN SIGS____
CT  Classic Trav   IMP 3rd Imperium  ANN   Announcements     VDES Vehicle Design

  Credit Squadron  AHIS Alternate          specific stuff
FFS Fire Fusion &       Histories

So folks, what do *you* think? Have I misplaced FFS? I think before we
add any more categories, we\'ll probably want to remove some. I think 21
categories is a good working maximum.

    Okay, Ken\'s been posting ships of the Neubayern Navy.  Here\'s some 
ships of the New Home Navy -- founding nation of the Old Islands 
Alliance.  One of New Home\'s most effective combatants (during the 
period from 5727 to 5729 AD) was the Wasp Fighter.  Here it is, and 
the squadron that supported it.

New Home Carrier Squadron:

    5x Admiral Class Carrier 
        5x Carrier Wing - 30 fighters per wing.
        5x Petra SDB 
    1x Carrier Recon Wing - 4 Bishops optionally carried by Admirals.


Admiral Class Fighter Carrier. Carries 30x Wasps & 1 500-ton craft.
CL-K7445G4-090307-08000-3     TL 13     MCr 7563.25/6050.6  12,000 tons
            2   2  2                 (w/o fighters)
            2   2  2
Crew=175 Staterooms=90 Agil=4 Fuel=5280 tons Extra Fighter Fuel=320 tons
Low=30    Frozen Flight Crew=30 Fighters=30 Wasps BigCraft=500 tons total.

    Like all of New Home\'s carriers and tenders, the _Admiral_ was a 
configuration 7 hull, allowing for maximum flexibility in carried 
craft.  Before all of New Home\'s fighter wings were upgraded to Wasps, 
some Admirals carried the obsolete TL 12 "Mosquito" fighter; later, 
Admirals carried the lethal TL15 "Scorpion" fighter.  
    Standard doctrine required that the non-combatant Admiral 
carrier jump into the peripheries of the system and drop its 
long-duration fighters, which would proceed to the target under their 
own power.  In the event that fighters must be picked up while under 
pursuit, the Admirals would deploy their Petra SDBs as screening 
ships; the Petra\'s job was to hold off any pursuing enemy until the 
fighters could be picked up.  If it was then safe to pick up the 
Petras, they would be picked up before the Admiral jumped out; if not,
the Admiral would jump out, and the Petras would scatter and hide in 
the outer system until it was safe to recover them.  It was felt that 
the MCr 452 Petra and 6 crew were more expendable than the MCr 7564 
Admiral and its 235 crew, and were not likely to be lost anyway.
    In practice, Petra casualties ran extremely high when deployed to 
cover a retreat; many posthumous medals went to Petra crews.  A new 
screening vessel with jump-1 capability to allow it to escape was 
eventually designed.


Wasp  heavy fighter
FH-0706B71-000000-00003-0       TL 13   MCr 123.62      75 tons
                      1
                      1
Crew=2 EP=7.7 Agility=6 Nuclear missiles.  Stateroom=1

    The Wasp was designed to be virtually impossible to hit (at TL13, 
it can only be hit with spinal mount weapons) while delivering 
non-trivial damage to the target.  It has a bridge plus the largest
computer available at TL13, and a 6G maneuver drive.  The Stateroom 
allows extended operations away from base or carrier.  Standard 
munitions are nuclear missiles to allow it to inflict damage to 
capital ships, except when supplementing customs and anti-piracy 
details.  It is unarmored (configuration 7 to save cost); if it is 
hit, no armor could save a ship this small from the only weapons 
capable of hitting it.
    Wasps have been used for missions ranging from offensive combat 
operations with a carrier squadron, commerce raiding with one carrier,
system defense operations, to anti-piracy patrols (in-system and
out-system with one carrier).
    The Wasp was eventually replaced by New Home-manufactured 
Sansterrean Pike Heavy Fighter (a TL 14 fighter with the same design 
philosophy) and later the New Home Scorpion TL15 Heavy Fighter.


Petra Class light SDB
PB-5906AE1-600000-4400-0 TL 12     MCr 451.5 500 tons
                  11
                  11
Crew=6    Staterooms=4 Agil=6 Fuel=43 tons  Pulse Lasers. Fusion Gun.

    The Petra was designed as a cheap SDB that could dish out as much 
damage as possible for a 500ton boat.  Changes in technology rapidly 
made the Petra obsolete, and the hundreds of Petras destroyed in the 
Old Islands War during the defense of New Home were not replaced; 
rather, the Wasp figher took over the system defense boat role.  After
5727, the only operational Petras were those attached to Carrier
Squadrons.


Adrian Bishop Class Scout/Courier.
SF-2241441-040000-40000-0     TL 13     MCr 123.664    200 tons
            1     1
            1     1
Crew=? Staterooms=6 Cargo=3 tons Fuel=108 tons Agil=1 Fuel Refinery. Scoops.
Vehicle=Air/Raft.

    The Bishop was originally designed as a multi-role Fleet Courier/ 
Fleet Recon Scout/ Diplomatic Courier vessel.  As part of a Carrier 
Squadron, the Bishop was intended to scout target systems (Fleet 
Recon) and maintain communications with HQ (Fleet Courier).  When 
actually used in combat, the 1G Maneuver driver proved to be a severe 
limitation -- it couldn\'t evade enemy pursuit long enough to jump out.  
It was replaced in those roles by the more capable Peregrine 
Scout/Courier, and relegated to Diplomatic Courier/X-Boat roles by 
late 5728.  


Peregrine Class Scout/Courier - a higher performance replacement for the
Bishop Class S/C.

SF-2646651-000000-50000-0     200/240 tons   TL 13     
                  1                          MCr 205.23/164.184
                  1
 
Crew=? Staterooms=6 Cargo=2 tons. Fuel=72 tons. Agil=6. Drop tank
fittings. Fuel Refinery. Scoops. Vehicle=Planethopper Staff Car (cargo).

Note: carried Jump fuel for 1x Jump-3.  Carries a J-4 drive big enough for
240 tons == size of J-5 drive for 200 tons (designed for J-5 upgrade).
     Performance:   J-4 carrying 40-ton tanks thru jump.
                    J-5 (upgrade) with 40-ton tanks, dropped.


Vehicle Note: the Planethopper car from DGP\'s "101 Vehicles" is my 
personal favorite for a Staff Car -- it\'s massively armored for a grav
car, and thus suitable for your flag officers to flit about a war zone
in... plus it has a wet bar.

Hi All,

This is the second CT adventure from my mid 1980\'s campaign that
I\'ve uploaded to the XTML. I\'d like to follow this with more but
the rest of them require formatting and editing. Add in the 
possibility of my wife going into labor any day now and you may 
not here from me for a month or more.

So, unless I hear howls of anguish from the XTML, I\'ll continue.


A few background notes:

I wrote this after seeing a movie set in the late 1800\'s. I can\'t
recall the name at the moment. It involved a British agent trying
to counter Russian influence in the Black Sea region. I had always
used a 1800\'s flavor in my campaign, so this seemed like a natural
scenario to use.  

The Rhalta Domain is an aristocracy with a free economy. It is the
premier naval power of the sector, and the only power with a TL 15
fleet. Access to the nobility by the citizens has improved following 
two revolts in the past 200 years. Most military and foreign policy 
moves are made to support economic growth. The megacorporation 
Molke Heavy Industrial Inc. has significant influence in the 
government.

The Malek Technium is an aristocratic technocracy with a state 
managed economy. It maintains control over its population by
controlling the technology available. This has hindered the
economic growth of several worlds. This state was founded by 
corsairs and refugees from the Rhalta Domain. Two wars have been 
fought against the Rhalta Domain in the past 100 years, without a
decisive winner. The Malek Technium continues to sponsor corsairs
which prey on Rhaltan shipping.



- ---- hack-n-slash here ----


Scenario - Maiskin Extraction 

Contract 
A Rhaltan Naval Captain, Jarek Taggart, offers a lucrative contract
to retrieve an agent operating in the Malek Technium. He is to be
picked up on Maiskin, a known base for corsairs operating in the
perimeter. Graek should be delivered to Sentinel for transfer to a
Rhalta Domain destroyer escort. Taggart offers 500,000 Cr plus expenses 

Background
Deputy Defense Advisor Miklas Graek has supplied the Rhalta Domain
with informative though routine updates on MT activities in the
Jhourae subsector for the past five years. His latest bulletin
detailed plans for a MT forward outpost in the Muvauri system, which
would be a violation of the Jhourae Concords. Graek will be revealed
if the Rhalta Domain acts upon his information. Therefore, Graek is
to be extracted prior to any Rhalta Domain countermeasures. He is
currently on a diplomatic tour of the perimeter systems.

Captain Taggart will arrange for the players\' starship to be
restocked, refueled, and loaded with a sufficiently suspicious cargo
to permit them to pass as corsairs. Once they reach Maiskin, the team
will have to contact Graek and help him elude his bodyguards. Within
two hours of his disappearance, Graek\'s security officer will coerce
port officials to delay departure authorizations until a search can
be completed. If the players have not left before the search begins,
they will notice that they are held in standby indefinitely.
Unauthorized departure may be considered as a desperate alternative
to hiding Graek from the search parties. If the starship leaves the
port without being searched, either through early or unauthorized
departure, a Crusaeder class defense cruiser will attempt to stop and
board them before they reach the 100 Diameter jump point. 

MT Defense Cruiser      
Crusaeder   IDC-B4348G2-450300-80008-0   1533.3 MCr       2 Ktons
   batteries bearing     2     2   1        Crew = 20
   batteries             2     2   1        TL = 13 
Pass = 0. Low = 0. Marines = 10. Cargo = 89. Fuel = 760. EP = 160.
Agility = 4. Craft = cutter.

If the party successfully makes the jump to Sentinel, Malek Technium
ships will jump to all probable destinations. If the players are ahead
of schedule, they may seek refuge in the asteroid belt until the
transfer occurs. 

An operative for the MT working in the Rhalta Domain Naval command has
delayed the orders for the DE to meet the players. The tampering will
appear to be a data transmission error. The discrepancy will be found
when the orders are reviewed. The players must survive 1D6 days in
the asteroid field before the DE arrives. The Crusaeder DC will
conduct scans for 1D6 days before assuming that the players\' ship
jumped to a different system.

The players will obviously not want to confront the Defense Cruiser
in open combat. Surviving in the asteroid belt can be accomplished by
stealth and guerrilla style tactics. Drifting unpowered in the belt
will make it difficult to be detected. Missles may be modified to act
as homing mines which can be deployed in the belt.

When the RD DE enters the system, the MT vessel will attempt to
intercept the players vessel before the tranfer can occur. A strong
show of force by the RD DE will cause the MT DC to withdraw.

Hi All,

It appears that sunbane is coughing up some of the failed messages 
to the XTML. I received a note that a post I made on Monday was

guess this is what I get for coming into work on a holiday

    I hope no-one out there in Classic-Traveller-Land gets offended if I ask
if there\'s any interest in the GDW board games based on "the little books":
Imperium, Dark Nebula, Invasion Earth, 5th Frontier War, and I guess even
Snapshot. Oh yeah, I left out Mayday, but I never bought that one for some
reason.
    I guess the main reason I\'m asking is that I always thought that a play
by email version of Imperium or 5th frontier war would be a bunch of fun, and
a randy diversion from the standard work week. I actually have some experience
doing this kind of thing (play by email), and I\'ve got a little bit of spare
time coming up in the near future. So.... If there\'s any interest at all,
I\'ll sock together some perl code and get something going.
    For those who are unfamiliar with these games, what follows is a brief 
description:

    "Imperium: Empires in Conflict: Worlds in the Balance" by Marc Miller.
Set in the Traveller Second Imperium, the board is a star map 32x28 hexes 
centered roughly on Sol. This area contains about 45 systems connected by a 
number of jump routes. Counters represent squadrons of ships of up to about
Tech-9/10, Troop Counters, "Colonies & Worlds", etc. Two players, Imperial and
Terran (pre solomani), establish colonies in unoccupied systems, and duke it 
out in a regional land-grab. I\'m pretty sure you can still buy this game. If
you have any interest in strategic space games, I STRONGLY RECCOMEND IT.
    "Dark Nebula". Essentially the same rules and scale of Imperium. However,
It\'s set over by the Aslans. Also features about six geomorphic sub-sectors.
I could tell you more, but I can\'t seem to find my copy of it. Probably my 
wacky brother ran off with it....
    "5th Frontier War". Okay, so you like strategic space games, and pre-
plotted movement doesn\'t scare you. A refinement of the Imperium concept. Scale
is larger (about half of the spinward marches). Many more counters. Two 
players, Zhodane and Imperial, duke it out the 5th Frontier War land grab
(Refer to Library Data in Classic or MegaTraveller). I\'d tell you more, but
one of my dead-beat friends has my copy....
    "Invasion Earth". Set in the Solomani Rim War. Board represents Terra.
Imperial player lands troops, and tries to subjugate urban areas. Terran player
tries to avoid this. This is a _great_ game to play if you know some nutty
Traveller player that keeps ranting about the Solomani, and you know you\'re
a better board gamer. Get this person to play the Terrans (of course), and
pummel the poor sucker. Then, laugh in this person\'s face. CAUTION: This may
result in attempted physical beating by Terran player.
    "Snapshot". I can\'t believe that any Classic Traveller player has never
heard of Snapshot. Ya\' gots some deck plans. Ya\' gots some counters. Ya\' gots
some handy tables all on a single sheet of paper. Rap this up with a combat
system that is essentially Classic Traveller Combat, but a little bit more
playable, and you\'ve got Snapshot. You can\'t get it from GDW any more (I\'m
pretty sure), but if your campaigns ever involve personal combat between
4 - 10 participants, the extra playability is worth using this game\'s rules.
Combat with more than 10 participants, find a copy of Striker, trust me on 
this one.

    To recap, I\'m asking the following questions... Is there anyone out there
who plays these games? We usually use them as aids to a Traveller role-playing
campaign. Is there anyone who has come up with iteresting rule variants to 
these games? If you\'re interested, I can send you pages of single paragraph
options and rule modifications to Imperium (I just love that darn game, can\'t
get enough).
    I am offering to set up a play-by-email Imperium server. Is there any
interest? It\'ll take me about two weeks to about a month to schedule the time.
Send mail directly to me, I\'ll post results on the list later. Is there anyone
interested in a play-by-email 5th Frontier War server? I\'m not so much of a
fan of this game, but it just screams for automation of some sort, so it may
take a bit longer. If I write the code correctly, the Imperium pbem server
can quickly be converted to a Dark Nebula pbem server. Is anyone interested in
this? 
    Interested in a Snapshot, Invasion Earth, Mayday, or Azanti High Lightning
pbem server, you\'re out of luck. My experience with these games tells me that
the amount of communication with these game\'s pbem servers would essentially
make them unplayable, cumbersome at best....

    I hate to ask this final question since it so obviously demonstrates my
ignorance of the finer points of copyright law. But.... Am I going to open
up myself (and/or the university) to possible legal penalties by providing
such a pbem server? My guess is that as long as I wasn\'t distributing material 
copyrighted by GDW (Rules, Maps, Counters, etc.), I\'d be pretty safe. The way
I see it, is that by my effort, I am providing a communication service to the 
Imperium playing community on the internet. As long as the output from the
server could reasonably be shown to be usable only to someone who has a 
legal copy of the game, am I safe? Sorry to sound so paranoid, but I\'m one
of them geeks that actually sits down an reads Microsoft disk envelopes...
    I\'m assuming that if I got express written permission from GDW, these 
points would be moot. If I asked Marc Miller or Frank Chadwick _real_ nice,
described it as a service to Internet Imperium players everywhere, and 
something that might generate interest(possibly sales) in the board game, 
do ya\' think they might provide such a written blessing of the project?
Anyone here know if Marc or Frank are \'reasonable\' dudes that won\'t try to
maliciously sue poor university continuing education instructors? Do Frank,
Marc, and/or other responsible parties at GDW have mail addresses I can ping
them at? Do they read this list?

    Well, thanks for putting up with my raves. I would really appreciate any
informed legal opinions, or any statements of interest in a Imperium pbem
server. Mail \'em to me direct, no need to waste more bandwidth on list.

My problem with Traveller is, to find some good adventure ideas that
\'feel like science fiction\'. Often, I think, it\'s no more than a
ordinary fantasy adventure. Yesterday, I\'ve browsed through my old
Traveller book (it\'s black, too -- but it\'s the German version) and
found some short adventure ideas (under the heading "the sub sector
awaits you") better than all I recently saw from GDW.

That adventures seems all to be combat missions with a short briefing,
a shoot out and a rewards collection. IMHO very boring and I don\'t
like such kind of military campaigns. Looks like a dungeon walk, you
you ask me.

So I wonder if anybody has some ideas for some \'good old\' adventures
(hopefully without mercenaries) (s)he could post here.

For example, the adventure about that TL 16 space station in Challenge
72 had a good idea -- but the adventure again was a "kill all what
moves" type of setting. Or is my prejudice true, that the combat part
in the TNE rulesbook is so large, because all the game should be about
is combat?? (I don\'t hope so.)

Some days ago, someone mentioned the games Imperium (IM) and Dark
Nebula (DN). I own both games. I like Imperium but I think, DN isn\'t
as good as IM. 

In DN, because of the variable map often one player can be easily
isolated by blocking only one world. Move your whole fleet to that
world in your first move and if the opponent don\'t want a decision
combat he\'s blocked. Moreover, the jumproutes are often `unrealistic.\'
There\'s a Jump-7 between TAIDA NA and OJA on the original-layed-out
map and a lot of other near distance worlds there aren\'t jump routes
at all. Because there\'re only four map with connection to all 4 sides,
there aren\'t that much different arrangements you might think. But
it\'s a nice idea to gain benefits through exploration during the
play. IMHO the game isn\'t designed carefully enough.

IM is better, but not much. Maybe both games aren\'t that successful
because they aren\'t very fair. I\'ve made the observation that in IM
the Imperial players wins more often than the Terran player. In DN
nearly every game we played the Solonami player has won. Has anybody
made other observations?

I would like to discuss some rules (btw, I own the german version of
IM, so I\'ve translated it back with the help of the DN rules):

Movement: Do you allow a jump into deep space? (I would think no,
because you can only jump along the green lines and you don\'t know the
jump number of the ships.)

Is a jump from deep space to a world allowed? (Maybe the same missing
jump number argument, but what if the distance is shorter than the
lines that connected that world?)

We tried an extension rule, that a monitor can be transported with 4
transports. Comments?

Is it sufficient to have a tanker with the jumping fleet or has the
tanker stay at the tertiary star? Or has it to be there one turn in
advance?

We changed the rules (in IM) that all capital ship can transport
fighter, too. So only outpost can be transported only be tranports.

Combat: Terran monitors aren\'t useful at all. Terras only effective
weapon (I as an Imperial player are afraid of) are the missile
boats. If the Imperial player has the smaller fleet, there\'s a 72%
chance, that range is long in the 2nd combat round, too. That\'s often
enough time to destroy the Terran fleet.

Do I undervalue the Bx ships? I think, they aren\'t worth their money.
Because you will go bankrupt because of mantenaince costs.  So we
reduced costs by 1 for all ships.

Who declares a break off first? Attacker or defender? (I vote for
attacker)

If all ships of a fleet are visible, the complicated ship allocation
phase has been proven to be superfluous, because our `chaotic
challenging\' "I will attack this ship, then I will defend with that
ship -- no that will be attacked, too." lends to the same result.

Is the combination High Intensity Short Range Missile Fire allowed?

I never found Suicide Attack useful at all. The +1 bonus isn\'t worth
the destruction of the own ship, I think.

In DN the hiring of allies is IMHO too easy. Because most neutral
units don\'t have a missile factor >= 10, so it\'s a 83% success
chance. (I understand the rule that the missile factors of the neutral
give the DM)

I think, surface combat is broken. Neutralized troops are dead - they
only don\'t know yet. I think, a -1 (or -2) DM to their combat strength
would be a better rule. What means the rule, that shielding troops can
limit the combat but that the rules say that combat go one until all
units of one side are destroyed? If two troop counter fight together,
will there stength be added? Will the defender destroy only one of
them or both together?

If there\'s a Terran strength 4 jump troop (JT4) attacking a strenth 2
regular imperial unit (RI2) and an outpost, the RI2 will do defence
fire, having a chance of 1:6 to destroy the JT4, then the JT4 will
have a 5:6 change of destroying the RI2 ?? Let\'s assume that none of
them will be destroyed. So, the RI2 will be supported by the outpost
and chances change to 2:6 and 4:6 ?? Correct? The JT4 will probably
win and destroy the outpost next, because it can\'t destroy the JT4.
Too easy...

We changed the rules that landed ships etc aren\'t destroyed but
captured (if that\'s possible due counter limitation). Also there\'s the
rule that damaged ships has to land to be repaired. So an attack may
be very valuable...

Btw, has anybody tried to use the rules with another map?  Has anybody
`designed\' other types of ships or even better, a formular for a
general design?

Umm..   What about undersea exploration mission, with some Earth quake in

Yeah, I liked it too.  Might use the settings in my planned Reformation
Coalition Adventure soon.  You can always change the story line a bit, so
less combat is elimenated, thus, an adventure with out combat.  It
shouldn\'t be too hard..

The combat section in TNE is large because they are trying to make a
realistic combat rules.  You can always modifie, or not even use them if
you wise.  you have the power.  :-)

No.  "Jumps are possible only along the routes printed on the map" and
     "A jump must be from a stellar hex to a stellar hex.  It may not 
      begin or end on a portion of the jump route between the ends."

No.  Same reasons.  This would make sublight travel fairly pointless.
Imperium uses a "tramline"-style hyperdrive, not the Traveller one.

Monitors actually can move to another system -- but only by sublight.
I don\'t know what the ramifications of your change are otherwise.

Yes.  "When [a tanker] moves to a tertiary system, it is immediately 
       capable of refueling friendly ships, enabling them to leave 
       the hex using hyperspace jumps."  [MOVEMENT -- Refueling]

What does this do to Motherships?  I mean, if you can carry even one
fighter unit on a B(x), then why would you build one of those nearly
defenseless motherships?  They\'re cheap, and maintenance is low, but
they\'re awfully fragile.

I too dislike the overemphasis on mercenaries.  In my first Traveller
campaign, the Ref told us to use Book 4 or 5 to generate characters,
since characters generated by the other methods didn\'t measure up.  I
did, and got a character that IMHO had far too many skills.

Fortunately, I went on to other Refs and to Ref myself.  Here are some
of the better experiences I have had:

o Playing a displaced barbarian king (ala Conan) aboard a marauding
  pirate ship.  This was good "light" Traveller.

o Running a "first contact" scenario, where a group of Terrans in
  orbit around the moon in the near future detect neutrino emissions
  coming from the wrong direction.  What surprised me was how the
  characters made very good use of the fact that their equipment,
  while being much lower-tech, had some great strengths since it was
  designed quite differently.

o Just plain going as you please.  If the players are involved, they
  can often initiate everything by themselves.  The Ref merely needs
  to hold on to the reins a bit.  This is the most rewarding form of
  Traveller, if you ask me.  Of course, you might want a few partly
  thought-out adventure threads that they might find themselves in
  (although winging it works too), plus you probably want to keep
  track of what\'s happening in the rest of the campaign.

I\'ve found that the best games involved nothing from the Traveller
background at all.  That\'s what is so good about the CT background,
IMHO.  You got a feeling that the common people did not care much
about politics and empires (except maybe at Core).  I put together
a campaign once set in Diaspora during the Rebellion.  I put it in
a "backwater" locally isolated cluster of stars and made the planets
generally disagreeable to outsiders (a common taint in the atmosphere
of each of them).  Certainly there was some trepidation about the
possibility of conflict with the Solomani, Aslan, and Daibei all
around them, but they had gone through changes of ownership in the
past and the lives of the occupants of that cluster never changed too
much.

My point is that your campaign background strongly influences what
kind of adventures you are going to have.  You need to establish
where the characters are going to be mostly and flesh out that area.

If they are going to be doing trading in starports, put together a
bunch of starports and some ships that they might encounter and
determine what businesses and such are operating in the sector.  It
should be easy to lead them off somewhere with a lucrative deal, but
the focus should be on making money (for the characters at least).

If they are going to be pirates, figure out where their base of
operations is (an asteroid field?) and what traffic passes within
their striking range.  Try to avoid the temptation to put an Ancient
base there.  I think we got the Ref rather annoyed when he had our
pirates find an Ancient base and we chose not to explore it any
further than figuring out its defenses (that technology stuff was
too dangerous).

The Diaspora campaign I mentioned was in a backwater with many
criminal types and such (ripe for adventures).  I had one thread
where a local crime lord had been secretly testing out mood-altering
drugs on a planetary scale.  But this was the focus of the campaign,
not simply an adventure.  The adventures were mostly related to that
overriding goal, and once the crime-lord was stopped, there were
links to other activities that the crime-lord was involved in.

I never much cared for the "Adventurers for hire" type campaigns.

As a matter of fact, Imperium DOES use the Traveller hyperdrive.  If you
plot out the Imperium map in THREE DIMENSIONS (you have to extrapolate
with some of the Stars that have Imperial names, but they\'re there...)
you discover that ALL of the green lines represent Jumps of 2 Parsecs
or less (Jump 2).  This is in line with the technological levels 
prevalent at the time of the Imperium\'s first contact with the 
"Solomani."

There probably were ships that travelled to deep space and then to another
system (having enough fuel for multiple jumps, hence could travel along
non-standard routes...) but these were probably non-standard ships
(therefore didn\'t have a major enough impact on the war(s) to warrant
inclusion in the Imperium counter mix.

    'body' => 'Lately we\'ve had the opportunity to compare traveller with
AD&D a lot, an inevitable comparison for the hard core RPG
group.

The conclusion we came to is that the traveller adventures
need to be more varied than the AD&D ones (at least, the ones
we play).  

Traveller is much more of a vehicle for playing roles.  The
framework (character generation) is IMHO less limiting to
the development of an independent personality than that
of games like AD&D.

That said; the best adventures I\'ve played/GM\'d were clue 
followers.  The term \'clue followers\' distinguishes this
from a mystery-type adventure which is only one type of clue
follower.

Usually, each clue is accompanied by a problem to overcome.
Examples of this are firefights, persuasion tasks, problems
to solve...etc.  This clue will lead on to the next and so on.

Alright, alright, stop talking theory and give out some meat.

THE TEASER:
The Setarans of Mertractor IV were a race whose time had come
and gone over Two Thousand years before the coming of humaniti
to this part of space.  Their ruins on the arboreal world of 
Mertractor IV bring tourist, students, and professional 
archeologists alike to this remote corner of the Spinward Marches.

Now one archeologist, Professor Bernard Sheafhouse, whose work on 
these ruins is well known in professional circles, is hiring
your organization (a salvage & transport firm) in a very secretive
fashion to go to one of the remote worlds of the subsector.  He says
he has evidence that the Setarans, thought to be a non-spacefaring 
race, had actually colonised a few planets.  If true, this would be
one of the premier discoveries of his career, and of his profession
in recent times.

Ok, cut to the chase;

There are several possible adventure outcomes/plotlines.  In the 
interest of space, I\'ll summarise my own ideas.

1.)  The professor is quite rich, and more than a little loony.  He has 
several shards of a medallion in a vacuum storage box which he occasionally
tries to manipulate to figure out which is which, and how they go
together.  He will occasionally let a player try, but there are just too
many missing peices.  He will offer to hire the player\'s starship
and actually purchase some excavating equipment and orbital sensors
geared to finding underground ruins and voids (a really good densitometer
would suit this task).

Using some (indeterminate) clues on the medallion the professor takes
the characters to a relatively low-tech, recently (w/in 1000yrs)
colonized planet nearby (w/in the subsector) to search for ruins.
There are several possibilities, the first few of which turn out to
be nothing.  The last one turns out to be an illegal mine, run by
local slave traders.

There are many choices at this point.  It could be that there are a few
small ships in orbit belonging to the bad guys which try to shoot the
player\'s ship down, successfully.  also, the players may decide to mount
their own rescue op with rewards in mind of a very generous (when it 
comes to slave traders) Imperial gov\'t.  Once shot down they could be
captured, or they might stumble on the Professor\'s ruins.  There could
be something useful among the ruins (some "magic" alternate technology
which allows them to escape or disable the bad guys), or the ruins could
point to something else.  Go figure


Possibility number
2).   The professor is brilliant, and dead.  He had already contracted
the players before being murdered, yes murdered.  He sent off the medallion,
which is more complete than in the last scenario, to the players, along
with a holorecording explaining that the Setarans were more advanced than
anyone thought, and it turns out Mertractor IV was a *colony* of the 
Setaran people.  The homeworld should hold wonders of alternate technology
and treasures to an archeologist (and others).  Unfortunately, he says, there
are others who are fiercly interested in the profit side of this discovery.

Without getting too detailed, the adversary in this plot is whoever murdered 
the professor.  There should be clues pointing towards his estranged
assistant, his wife, and perhaps a collegue.  Any of these are candidates
for the "bad guy".  There are not enough clues to take anyone to the
planet of Prof. Sheafhouse\'s dreams, but these clues should be gathering
until the players can figure it out.  As the last clue falls into place the
"bad guy" should be revealed (they?) in time to steal the clue, and perhaps
put the players in a room with a devious device to bring about their demise
(ala the old batman series).

The rest is almost history; the case, followed by a confrontation, gun in
hand, with the "bad guy (oops, or bad gal)" at the planet in question (which
may turn out to be just another colony), and some incident involving the 
alternate technology of the Setarans.  Note this tech should be different, 
not more powerful (necesarily). Perhaps they\'ve developed a "stun field"
or semi-intelligent robots.  in either case the limits of age of the stuff
and lack of spare parts/correct energy recharge would be good.

OK, that\'s enough for now.  Hope the clouds were seeded for future
development...

Thank you for your answers. Either I can\'t read the rules carefully

[Capital battle ships can carry fighters]

This improves the usability of that ships. Otherwise, I personally
think they aren\'t worth their money. Perhaps for the Imperial player if
he loses that ships before maintenance and adds them to the recycling
stack. 

[Terra never win]

If you play the campaign, the Terran player has to try to lose his
first game, without losing many ships. Because the Terran has higher
production and he will profit better from peace time, he has better
chances to win the next two games. The Imperial of course must now not
only win but also destroy his enemy.

[ground combat -- shielding]

Ah. Thanks. Now I understand the rule (I think ;-). That changes
ground combat. But the odds are still much too bad.

Stefan says:

>I\'ve made the observation that in IM the Imperial players wins more

In my experience, the Terran player has won ONCE: when the Imperial
player didn\'t set up on the Terran\'s doorstep.  Once the terrans
had Procyon and the other junction (the double star: I don\'t 
remember the name), the game was over pretty quickly.

>Movement: Do you allow a jump into deep space? (I would think no,
>because you can only jump along the green lines and you don\'t know the

No, in the 2nd edition of Imperium, it clearly prohibits this.  You
can only jump along the "green line" jump routes.

>Is a jump from deep space to a world allowed? (Maybe the same missing
>jump number argument, but what if the distance is shorter than the

No, I think from a rules POV, once you\'re using sublight movement,
you have to continue using it until you get to the destination.

>We tried an extension rule, that a monitor can be transported with 4
>transports. Comments?

Since basically you\'re trying to dissassemble and then reassemble a
battleship, and  since they take a turn to replace, I wouldn\'t favor that
rule.

>Is it sufficient to have a tanker with the jumping fleet or has the

We played with the rule that the tanker had to be with the fleet, but
if more than one fleet of ships were just passing through a hex that
required them, the tanker had to stay in that hex.

>We changed the rules (in IM) that all capital ship can transport

Hmmm.... again, that\'s interesting, but then it eliminates the
need for REALLY expensive mother ships... it does make capital
ships more useful: I like this one :-)

You are absolutely correct.  A fix we discussed but never tried
was to make the beam weapons work at 1/2 strength at long range.
Terran Heavy Cruisers and Strike Cruisers are neat too.

>Do I undervalue the Bx ships? I think, they aren\'t worth their money.

Do you mean maintenace costs?  Battleships are effective
at blowing things up, but expensive to maintain.  They\'re 
just about the Terran\'s only serious advantage, too. How do you
want to modify them?

Attacker declares first.

We just let the person who had the most ships pair them up.

Yes.

It\'s useful if 1) you\'re attacking a ship with only missles
that has no missles left, 2) if you HAVE TOO take out a larger
ship.  It is a toss up.

I don\'t know about the first one: I liked the % reduction of 
ground troops in Fifth Frontier War.  This is how screening (shielding)
works:

The defender has three units, two troops and an outpost.
If the attacker has two jump troops attacking, the defender can
use his two troops to engage the two attackers.  Those four units
fight until one  side or the other is destroyed.  Even if
the attacker wins, the outpost can\'t be attacked until the 
nexty ground combat phase, because it was screened.

>Too easy...

The Terran troop is screened, and can\'t attack the outpost until
the next ground combat phase.  Theorhetically, the IMperial player
could drop Jump Troops on the planet, and change the course 
of the battle.  Since the Imperial plaer always wins space battles,
this is pretty likely ;-)

>We changed the rules that landed ships etc aren\'t destroyed but

Then I guess you can\'t use them for screening...

No, I\'m against this one.  Ships the size of Battleships would
have to be repaired in Orbit, in my opinion.

No, but it\'s doable.  I think at it\'s heart, Imperium is a great game
with some serious balance problems...

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I\'ve always found the above to be true & have never found a way around
it. (I\'ve never tried the reduction in maint. costs that has been sug-
gested previously, though.) Otherwise, the Imperials only get capitals
from Appeals & both *sometimes* get them when there\'s nothing else left
to build. 
=========================================

chances to win the next two games. The Imperial of course must now not

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My experience is that Terra almost never loses a war until it gets wiped
out. The Imperial player can hold his PP\'s down by constantly appealing
to the Emperor & that means that he gets the peacetime building bonus.
I\'ve experimented with various restrictions, such as only allowing appeals
every other turn or not counting appeals as reductions in PP\'s but have
yet to find a satisfactory solution. The 2nd ed. rules have doubled the
\'cost\' of appeals which reduces the number that the Imperial player can
make but it also allows the Imperium to \'lose\' the war even faster so it
doesn\'t really cover all the bases.

Ye1ah, ground combat is still somewhat dissatisfying to me too. I pretty
much agree with the "flawed gem" <sic> statement that someone wlse made
earlier.

But how?  How?  The Imperial player controls the tempo of the game
with his appeals to the emperor.  How do you make it inviting enough

    I\'ve been following the "standard Imperial background", in which 
slavery and slave trafficking were highly illegal (i.e., capital 
crimes) Imperial-level crimes in which the Imperial government gets 
involved.  OTOH, extra-Imperial states are a whole \'nother story.  The
Solomani Confederation lets its member states decide such issues on an
individual basis; there are Solomani nations that forbid slavery, and 
nations that practice it the basis of their culture (The Wu 
Technocracy, with its genegineered castes comes to mind).  Vargr 
nations vary similiarly.  The Zhodani abhor the very idea of slavery. 
I\'m not sure about Aslan and K\'Kree.  Strike that.  The K\'Kree have 
whole "slave races".
    As a specific example, in my campaign the Society of Equals in 
Gvurrdon (Vargr nation) permits slavery, but is very particular about 
who may be legally enslaved.  Their neighbor, the Thirz Empire, does 
not tolerate slavery per se, but does have a system of farming out 
prisoners-of-war to Thirz clanlords as temporary slave labor 
("thralls").  Thralls must be freed if ransomed or repatriated, and 
have some minimal legal rights; they can\'t be arbitrarily killed or 
mistreated.  (The assumption is that thralls are temporary slaves, 
providing labor in return for the trouble of keeping them captive 
(food & board, guards), and should be returned intact when ransomed or
repatriated after the war).
    Society of Equals slaves are slaves in the classical sense; 
property of their owner, who can dispose of them as he/she/it wills.  
Economics affect this; you don\'t kill an expensive technician-slave 
out-of-hand, but extremely rich Equals have been known to commit some 
appalling cruelties.  An Equal may not be enslaved; lesser citizens 
can be enslaved as punishment for a crime.  The pups of a slave are 
allowed one chance to take the Test of Equals; if they make it, they 
are Equals, if not, they are slaves for the rest of their lives. 
Foriegn slaves may be registered as Society slaves by their owners. 
Otherwise, foriegners have most of the legal rights of free lesser 
citizens.
    Corsairs based on independent worlds between the two nations raid
Thirz worlds for captives who are enslaved and sold in the Society of 
Equals.  Recently (1112), the Thirz have used this slave trade as a
reason to annex the independent worlds.  In addition, the Thirz are 
using the pretext that the slave-raiding corsairs were backed by 
Society business interests to start a war with the Society of Equals.

    Okay, how\'s that?

This was quite a while ago.  The barbarian king had an AMAZING skill
with swords and was very strong (I think his Strength and Endurance
were both max\'ed out at F).  He also had some small latent psionic
skill (probably something common to nobles on his planet--he used to
be king of his entire planet.  After being displaced from his home
world by a corporation that wanted his planet\'s resources, he got
sick of the empire that could let this come about and what was left
of his people for buckling under to the greed of the corporation.
Eventually he joined up with a bunch of pirates.

I remember that the pirates had just acquired a decent-sized corsair,
but they were a bit more subtle.  I remember one episode where we
captured a free trader by putting my character in a lifepod along
with a few others.  When the trader picked us up, the others gained
their trust then my character took on the (small) crew in hand-to-hand
combat while they got to the secret cache of weapons.  About this time
the corsair appeared and they surrendered easily.  I told you it was
"light" Traveller.

Anyway, the group eventually found an asteroid field in which they
wanted to set up a base.  They discovered what was obviously (to the
players at least) an Ancient base.  Somehow we managed to get in (I
think my player did something entirely non-obvious to most people
used to high-tech stuff) and the others learned how to control the
defenses.  "Great, now we\'re invincible, let\'s go out marauding!"
we all said.  "But, but..." the Ref said.  C\'est la vie.

I ran this one for a convention, and the players loved it (although
it is a bit difficult to finish in 4 hours).  In this scenario, the
world had united under a common government after a short-lived brush
war which had left the Far East decimated.  This government was still
on shaky ground, but someone discovered a key to viable fusion
technology, an element called "aiuconium" (the convention was named
AU Con).  It was also discovered that the element occurred naturally,
though it was rare, and that it was likely that the element could be
found on the moon.

The players were astronauts who took a hybrid chemical/fusion ship
into orbit around the moon.  They went to the dark side of the moon
when the moon was the most sheltered from radiation from the Sun and
the Earth and turned off all of their systems so they could use some
new ultra-sensitive sensors.  While cataloging the moon, they
something appeared OVERHEAD, which turned out to be an imperial
destroyer/frigate which misjumped into the Terran system (the empire
had not known about Earth, yet).  The characters\' ship was small and
unarmed/unarmored, and they were using only passive sensors and
hand-operated pressurized cannister-type thruster, so they were able
to find out something about the Imperials (who were listening to the
Earth\'s radio) before they made their presence known.  The Imperials
would have tried to convince the astronauts that they were friendly
and would have wanted to return to get "diplomatic support", but the
astronauts were WAY too far ahead of them, and launched an attack on
the unsuspecting Imperial honor guard (not the way I expected it to
go, but they were able to get past them--I think they killed most of
the command staff).  By the way, none of the players had even known
what Traveller was, so they deduced the Imperials\' motives on their
own (they were supposed to eventually).

The characters had some advantages, of course.  They were hand-picked
"best-of-the-best" astronauts who were not only in top physical
condition, but also very resourceful, and scientific geniuses, while
the Imperials were a bit bungling while at the same time hoping to
gain some status by doing a great deal on their own before returning
for an occupation force.  They also understood most of the Imperial
technology (not jump drives), in particular being experts on nuclear
physics.

First contact scenarios always had a certain intrigue for me.  One
other time I tried to run a post-nuclear first-contact campaign.
That was short-lived, although I did get to make up some really
interesting creatures (ala Gamma World).

I also ran a first contact scenario in the old Star Frontiers game
many years ago.  This had a human-looking race with advanced
technology acting like benefactors.  Meanwhile, a race that looked
closer to the Sathar (the villians in that game) would lead raids
on the "benefactors".  It turned out that the "benefactors" were
closer to reptilian than human and the others were more mammalian
than reptile, and the "benefactors" were the evil ones.  This was
before I saw "V".  Honest.

> <I never much cared for the "Adventurers for hire" type campaigns.
>

I preferred pulling characters out of "normal" lives.  One campaign
had an extremist environmentalist (practically an eco-terrorist),
an ex-thug on the run from his old mob, a Retief-style spy, and a
few others (all player characters) working together to stop a
particularly nasty mob chief.  The spy was given the assignment,
the rest simply ended up getting involved.

As I said earlier however, I do not like militaristic campaigns at
all.  I think it would have been better if the "expanded" character
generation method of Books 4-6 (well at least 4-5) were never added.

If you want a more episodic feel to your adventures, consider
setting up the characters as explorers or spies/private eyes.
If you\'re willing (or forced) to split up the characters, then
you have more options (think "Deep Space 9", "Babylon 5", or
other TV shows).

    Steve and I have been working out how we want to integrate FF&S 
ship designs (which we like) into our Classic 3rd Imperium Trav 
campaign, (which we also like).  Technologies we have decided on:  
Thruster plates, cost and weight as stated in FF&S; ContraGrav, ditto; 
HePLar, ditto; Fusion Rockets, ditto; and more primitive rockets, cost 
and weight DIVIDED BY 10.  

    Not-so-arbitrary rules we have decided on:  HePLar and Fusion
Rockets are really, really dangerous to be in back of.  Imperial Law 
forbids using either in the atmosphere of an inhabited world -- 
violation falls under the Mass Murder/Genocide laws.  Worlds with no 
atmosphere usually forbid their use within X hundreds of kilometers of
major inhabited areas.  Extra-Imperial worlds may follow Imperial 
practice or they may allow HePLar-powered landings at special 
starports equipped with "blast pits" far from inhabited areas.

    Campaign implications: here I\'ll use a player character as an 
example. We briefly take Captain Alexander Plankwell back to his prep
school days...

    "...Ahem.  Cadet Plankwell, are you paying attention?  Very good.  
Please review for the class the standard ground-to-jump launch profile 
for an interface-capable starship."  

    "From the ground, the ship engages ContraGrav to neutralize the 
pull of gravity; it probably uses Scramjets to accelerate to the jet\'s 
ceiling, and then switches them to rocket mode until clear of the 
atmosphere."  

    "`Probably\', Cadet Plankwell?"  

    "Yes, ma\'am.  For a small starship like a free trader, scramjets 
[1] are the most economical of fuel.  A dedicated lander might use a 
high-performance rocket to get to orbit fast, but a starship would be 
concerned with minimizing fuel load it has to carry for landing and 
takeoffs."  

    "So you accelerate at full blast, to orbital velocity?  That 
doesn\'t seem very economical to me."  

    "No, ma\'am, it wouldn\'t be.  A small starship probably couldn\'t 
even carry that much fuel and still have space for jump fuel.  It 
cruises at low acceleration, taking advantage of the ContraGrav to get 
above the atmosphere without ever actually achieving orbital velocity.  
This phase of the launch might take two or three hours."  

    "Continue."  

    "Once it\'s above atmosphere, the ship can engage its main maneuver 
drive and vector out to the jump point, or accelerate to escape 
velocity if travelling in-system."  You paused, and hastily added, 
"getting clearance from Traffic Control, of course.  You wouldn\'t want 
to fry someone in your drive flame."  

    "What if you ship is equipped with Thrusters?"  

    "Well, in that case-- just engage the ContraGrav and accelerate 
under thrusters from the ground to jump point.  I just assumed that we 
were talking about civilian ships--[3]" 

    "Never `assume\', Cadet Plankwell.  You know what `assume\' makes of 
`u\' and `me\'..."  [4]

- ----
Notes:

[1] Scramjets are what FF&S calls "AZHRAE" -- combination turbojet/
ramjet/ rockets.

[3] Thrusters (standard MT drive) are too expensive to be
profitable for civilian use, but mandatory on military vessels -- they 
give your ship virtually unlimited Delta-V and unlimited 
landing/take-off capability.  

[4] I hated this stupid Navy proverb the first time I heard it, let 
alone the fifteenth...

- ----

Reasoning behind rules mods: 
    We lowered the price of the older rockets to something reasonable 
because I wanted them to be affordable in their intended niche:  
landers, and landable starships.  After 10,000 years of space flight, 
it is reasonable to assume that industry can mass-produce H2-O rockets
for commercial customers rather more cheaply than U.S. aerospace 
companies can hand-tool one a year for government contracts.  I wanted
merchant ships (which are concerned with costs, first, last and 
always) to choose rockets over thrusters as a means of getting off the
ground.  That way, merchants use HePLar and rockets, and the military 
uses thrusters, and THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MILITARY & CIVILIAN 
SHIPS besides the number of guns.  Piracy is now possible; to make a 
pirate, take a free trader, rip out the HePLar, and put in thrusters. 
Add guns, and extra bunks for the prize crew.  There you go.
Other ships not concerned with costs will probably have thrusters; 
they\'re just too convenient.  Scout Service ships, other government 
owned vessels, and private yachts all fit in this category.

    Second, I cut the weight on "conventional" rockets after doing 
some research and finding out that the FF&S figures made rockets that 
had about 1/10 the thrust to weight ratio of the Saturn V and Saturn 
1C rocket engines.  They were much too heavy (about 10x) for the
volume taken up and thrust produced.


A couple of notes about starships and vacc suit ops:

    Radio doesn\'t penetrate bulkheads; hence Imp. standard ships have 
a system of "repeaters" that pick up transmissions on standard freqs.  
and relay them thru the ship\'s internal communications net to local 
transmitters in the destination compartment.  This way communications 
capability is retained during vacuum operations.  To cripple 
communications by enemy forces (e.g., a boarding party), the repeater 
system can be set to acknowledge only authorized users, or transmit a 
scrambled signal, much like the regular (voice/data) network 
communications.  

    Military vessels have a network of life support connections 
running thruout the ship, such that anyone in a vacc suit is, at the 
very worst, no more than 2 minutes from an ELS (Emergency Life 
Support) connection that he can plug his vacc suit into, and not have 
to rely on a PLSS.  (Idea stolen from submarines).

    Last, mindless nit-picking:  metric tonnes are NOT UNITS OF
THRUST (FORCE)!  A metric tonne is a unit of MASS!  An English ton IS
a unit of force, however ... Which is to say that a tonne doesn\'t
always weigh the same, but a ton does. :-) (Weight being a measure of
gravitational FORCE).

discussion of jump point determination.  I never though about it before

an objects mass, mass distribution than diameter.  As you stated, 
diameter bades computation produces huge numbers for giant stars and gas 
giants.  If gravity is indeed the thing that makes a jump into a bad day 
then the mass, density should certainly be more important.  For example a 
gas giant like say Jupiter while much more massive than terra (300x ?) 
has about 2/6 the average density.  As such grav gradient at similiar 
distances relative to the planet size will be lower with the gas giant.  
Therefore to get a similiar gradient (as 100 diameter on Terra) with Jupiter 
you would have to be closer than 100 diameter.  I havent sat down to 
check these intuitive statements and as such might be dead wrong.  
Hopefully I will have confirmed the statements before this message is posted.

In closing I must bring myself back to the point that it is sometimes 
dangerous to get into this sort of discussion in the context of an RPG 
and to remember what Stewart said, This is to make worlds orbiting large 
stars accesible.  I am sure that most people will always use the 100

the subject, Ill save this for another submission.  Back to the Space 
Station....

Maybe TL 8 is too early but goung up a TL or two wouldnt change things 
much.  Like you say the key is figuring out how to mod the rules.  As 
soon my Mid-Terms are finished I think ill put some thought into this.
The main thing that many people may not realize is that it is very 
difficult to model multi parameter systems.  You can get equations to 
match quite well the way real systems behave..BUT..a)How many people want 
to sit playing with an equation with a half dozen terms just to figure out 
how fast your car will go.  Thus ultimately it is up to the individual to 
a certain degree to introduce the added level of detail for his/her 
satisfaction.  Altough in closing I will say that the game system 
producer is wholly responsible for not handicapping the users with 
systems that consistently produce unreasonable results (where 
unreasonable is defined by the nature of the model).  If a user has to 
write new rules then why would he/she have bought the game in the first 
place?

Ground Vehicle design sequences break down for very light vehicles, 
motorcylces, anything under about 1 MT,  I wouldnt mention it if this 
were a minor thing, they really break down.

I also have here some suggestions on mods to powerplants and additions.  
In general Powerplants are heavier at TL 6 and above than they are in the 
real world.  For example the TL 7 Gas Turbine in the 1970 UH-1 was about 
800 shp(0.6 MW), it weighed about 1100 lbs (0.5 MT) this is about double of 
what the tl 7 gas turbine produces per MT.  Also there is a marked 
absence of hi effecieny internal combustion engines (or even mediocre 
efficieny)  as such I have made up a table of powerplants and offer it as 
a suggestion as soon as I can dig it up.  A quick list from memory.
Details such as mass, fuel con price are forthcoming...

Additions and mods: (Mod in comments means mod to exsisting, add is obvious)
Description             Comments
- ----
TL 6 Imp Int Comb       Mod/Reduce wt, reduce fuel con
TL 7 ImpEff IntComb     Add/Slightly reduce wt from above, reduce fuel con

TL 10 VImp MHD          Add/Epitome of gas turbine, up around 1mw/kl,hi cost

As stated, I will send numbers and supporting rationale as soon as I dig 
it up.  The FF&S powerplants are the same as the Megatraveller ones 
except that the detail of FF&S makes apparent the failings of the old 
table.  Also Im trying to come up with a way to factor in vehicle 
mass into fuel consumption during particularly obtuse departmental 
seminars.  I think you will agree that fuel con does not scale strictly 
linearly with powerplant volume.  I havent put much thought into this(and 
probably wont) but its something to consider.  Well Im sure youve all had 
your fill of me for tonight so until next time.....

I was somewhat astonished at the timing of this article, being that
I\'m currently mulling over this very subject in anticipation of
releasing yet another program (this time a sector generator, or rather
set thereof).

Anyway, a little over a year ago, we had a long discussion about
the problems in basic mainworld generation (pgs 24 and 25 of the
megatraveller ref\'s manual). And needless to say, I was in favor of
route #1 (change the damn system) whereas others were in favor
of route #2 (rationalize the inconsistencies). I really have nothing
new to add on this topic, except to say that I\'ve just put a
transcript of the old discussion up for ftp. Feel free to take a
look at it, and if you do, let me know what you think.

Yeah, that sounds like the oldtimers I\'ve known.  Especially the
squawking and squabbling!

I think that it\'s too bad that some of the long time Traveller players,
most recently Nick Sylvain, have found TNE so annoying that they\'ve
gone away.  Nick has always had something useful to say, as have many
of the other "oldtimers" on the TML who are no longer around.

I have problems with some things about TNE, too.  Some of them fairly
major.  But heck, I had problems with "Classic" Traveller, some of
them major as well.  As anyone who ever tried to run the old adventure
"Research Station Gamma" knows, sometimes you just have to wing it.
And if something is too broken to use (like the MT "Frightning Ships"
supplement) then you don\'t buy it.  Some people would say TNE falls
into this category.  Their choice.  (Some people are sick of new
rules sets.  No problem there!)  Besides, I loathe GURPS. :) 

So I guess I\'ll be around for a while.  Of course, I reserve the right
to flee at will if things get too brain-dead.  Doesn\'t look like that
quite yet, though.  After all, DGP could have *published* that awful
"Baddies From The Core" outline from MTJ #4!  (Concept ok.  The
implementation outlined, no.)

THANKS
Kudos (to borrow Roger Sanger\'s terminology) to those who contributed useful

****** QUIET PLEASE ******

To those who chipped in on the anti-TNE lobby, I would like to say firstly,
that I mostly agree with them with regard to TNE, the manner in which it has
been \'thrust\' upon gamers, etc.
However, as pointed out by some others on TML (and refering you back to my
\'cartoon\' of 562/7058), harping on about TNE won\'t solve anything. To
paraphrase Arnold Rimmer (Red Dwarf, speaking to the others, two of whom are
armed to the teeth ready to take on a Polymorph which has horribly attacked
them all and sucked the aggression out of Rimmer\'s mind):
"I don\'t want to inflict my opinions upon anyone... just regard me as... a
\'facilitator\'... It seems clear that the time has come to really hit hard...
and fast... I\'m talking about a really major leaflet campaign here... and if
that doesn\'t work... it\'s the T-shirts with \'Out with Polymorphs\'"

1) If you don\'t like TNE (rules, etc.)... you don\'t need others to reinforce
your dislike. Just because you won\'t run any such games yourself - and won\'t
shell out for the rulebooks, et al. - doesn\'t mean that you\'re going to turn
around when your referee says "I\'m gonna run a TNE game next week" and tell
him to *&^$ off (well, hopefully not - we still have AD&D 1st/2nd edition
fights here). In such circumstances you might as well at least have a go and
see just what it is like.

2) If you don\'t like the TNE background... keep running things in the old
Imperium. Most scenarios can be adapted for CT or MT - whether pre or during
the Rebellion. There have been quite a few discussions on TML over the last
few months saying how a post-rebellion Imperium could have reformed such that
you can run the rebellion (for a change) but still get back to stability after
a few years. There\'s no reason why an article about the background of a TNE
post-blitz planet can\'t still be used in CT/MT settings, just pretend there\'s
been a more-localised conflict or ignore all the war stuff and just extract
the cultural stuff, etc.

3) If you do like TNE... then it\'s unlikely that people harping on about its
faults is going to change your mind - all this does is irritate.

If people really feel so strongly that they have to leave the list, or refrain
from sending in CT/MT material then...

1) Previous checks of TML members have shown that at least half either don\'t
use TNE or don\'t even use the approved DGW background. So there is still a
very good audience for CT and MT material (perhaps our \'facilitator\' James
could correct me if this is no longer the case).

2) So, by withdrawing your support from the forum you are \'abandoning\' the
rest of us die-hards who will drain every scrap of scenario or idea for use
in their CT/MT campaigns? I don\'t have time to write up every detail of the
planets my players come to... I just scramble for anything I\'ve read of late,
any scenarios (Star Trek, Star Frontiers, anything!) I\'ve seen, and then lie
through my teeth to make it all fit my own campaign. You can practically see
the vampire teeth-marks / circular leech holes on the original material!

3) How about some constructive hints on how to convert between TNE and MT,
particularly with regard to the character skills, etc. so that articles can
be more generic between CT, MT and TNE. Okay, so someone indicated Survival
Margin might help here, but us TNE-illiterates are unlikely to buy that if we
won\'t buy TNE itself!

4) If people are really, really, really desperate for non-TNE support, then
should we ask our already over-burdened facilitator James to start up another
mailing list? Not specifically for anti-TNE gripers or for TNE-lovers, just
one where the acronym TNE is never heard? Frankly I think this would be a lot
more work and some of use would have a lot of trouble deciding whether to send
to one or both mailing lists and those who subscribed to both might get
duplicates of a lot of the stuff.

Everything above is my own opinion (c)1994 A. S. Lilly All Rights Reserved.
Which means when flaming back at me you are not allowed to repeat the exact
wording of anything I said. Unless I give you specific written permission to
do so. Probably... Oh what the Hell...

Let\'s see a continuation of the constructive scenario ideas, backgrounds and
important discussions which have been evident the past months.

SOFT SKILLS

I am assuming (quite arrogantly in fact) that Joni M Virolainen (596/7465) was
refering to me (562/7058) and Dave Johnson (560/7044) when he mentioned about
\'soft\' skills (Liaison, Carousing, Admin, etc.). I have some stuff in the
pipeline in that vein but it\'s not ready for TML quite yet. I\'m sure other
referees have systems for evaluating such skills - I tend to play such off the
top of my head, using a simple feedback loop: player satisfaction is the
feedback mechanism. Feedback loops can go crazy sometimes (Player rolls
double-1 but looks so sad referee says he still managed to crack the Imperial
code computer with his Computer-0 skill)... so you have to have \'common sense\'
limits.

MORE GENERALLY

My games are centred on player/referee enjoyment and the positive feedback
given after a good game. If the players enjoy talking about past events their
characters have been involved in, and the mention of specific incidents brings
a smile to their face, then you\'re doing it right.

INTERSTELLAR POLITICS / SPACE COLONIES / HOSTILE WORLDS

I think Bill White (597/7491) brought up an important point when considering
why some star systems don\'t seem to have a logical basis for the siting of
their starport, huge population on a hell-hole world, etc. The price of
interstellar travel might not seem too bad when you\'re a rich adventurer with
the price of several High Passages in your wallet, or a Far Trader owner
carrying weapons or jewels. But when it comes to bulk (and I mean millions of
tons) goods - ores, metals, petrochemicals, foodstuffs, etc. then in-system
transport is expensive enough, without bringing in such low-value goods from
other systems. In such circumstances I would imagine that initial colonists
would congregate around the site with the greatest natural resources. With
regard to the starport-on-a-hell-hole problem, if the hell-hole is the source
of the resources then it\'s going to need big port facilities to ship the stuff
elsewhere in the system. Other ports in system need only have space ports to
handle the goods. Perhaps more importantly, the F-class spaceport to handle
in-system bulk goods might well be several times larger than the \'main\' A or
B class starport which serves the inter-system traffic.

It\'s my sense that the sort of geographic variations you\'ve mentioned will
tend to decrease as TL increases because one of the effects of an increase
in TL is an improvement in communications and distribution channels which
tends to facilitate or enhance technology transfer.  Current TL discrepancies,
not only within developed nations, but among developed nations and developing
nations are closing and this has increased with advances in technology.

This is a fair assessment, IMHO, but this very view seems at conflict with
variable TLs.  Again, if Sacnoth truly is at TL 12 while the other worlds
are at TL 9-11 then it ought to quickly come to dominate the entire
Confederation.  Remember, technology is at the heart of the `feudal
technocracy\' of the Sword Worlds Confederation.

Again, I tend to agree with this idea but it then again seems at conflict
with the variation in TLs in the Sword Worlds.  If a particular world in a
`feudal technocracy\' enjoys a fundamental advantage over the other worlds
it should quickly rise to prominence.

This idea of a fundamental advance does need to be rectified with Hans\'s
point that in the Imperium campaign the ease of access to higher TLs points
to an economic or sociological basis for any TL rating rather than a basis
upon technological endeavor.  If I want to build a Jump-3 starship on Gram
all I need to do is jump over to Sacnoth, buy some blueprints (or hire a
shipwright), and jump back to Gram.  Since this isn\'t happening (otherwise
Gram would be TL C with a class A starport) then either I can\'t afford to
buy the blueprints (or hire the shipwright) *or* there is some social
reason why I can\'t do this.  You can take it a step further to say that
Gram doesn\'t have the TL 12 factories needed to manufacture components for
such a ship but can\'t I just jump down to Sacnoth and get plans for them
to?  So, it\'s not about access to technical knowledge because clearly
that\'s available.  One sociological barrier might be a border (Japan may
have difficulty competing with US aircraft manufacturers because it can\'t
gain access to the knowledge) but this shouldn\'t be a problem *within* a
particular state (Boeing in Seattle is hiring from the same pool of
engineers and buying from the same pool of suppliers as is McDonnell-
Douglas in St. Louis).

Such variation in economic cycles from world to world would seem to suggest
that there is little integration between the economies of the Sword Worlds.
This seems unlikely to me.  Even if there is little political cooperation
there ought to be much economic cooperation or the Sword Worlds would have
fallen to the Imperium - or the Darrians - long ago.

Well, maybe, but I find this unlikely for a `feudal technocracy\'.  Technology
is a fundamental aspect of Sword Worlds culture.

Well, if this was the case, why wasn\'t Sacnoth the capital at that point?
Leadership clearly fluctuates among the Sword Worlds so ought not these
fluctuations be tied to any fluctuations in technology?  Again, keep in

Well, again maybe, but only if that balance of power doen\'t destroy any
of those precious ships.  If I were Sacnoth I wouldn\'t sell any other 
worlds ships, fight them to a destructive stalemate, build some new TL12
weapons of my own, and set myself up as a TED, in a sense.  If the Sword
Worlds are as fractious as it seems, even if Sacnoth doesn\'t do this it
seems the next world to hit the `peak\' of it\'s cycle would.

This entire `technological cycles\' idea seems to me to be more and more
difficult to rationalize.

I can\'t explain it.  I think the variable TLs in the Sword Worlds are just
what you get when you do random generation with a flawed system.

I\'m not so sure.  In effect, Depot is something like a contemporary
shipyard and naval facility or air base and aircraft manufacturing plant.
There are the employees and facilities of the plant and the military
personnel of the base but these folks do not produce their product in
isolation.  They are supported by a host of suppliers and contractors
at some remove from the site.  This support is maintained through the
infrasturcture of the rest of the region and nation.

If this infrastructure exists in Deneb - and essentially Vincennes is the
only source available - then Depot might continue to function.  Clearly
this would be a priority of the Domain and later the Regency.  On the
other hand, if Depot was previously supported by Imperial infrastructure
beyond the Domain then it might be more feasible to move these facilities
to Vincennes.

Remember, the entire premise of the Rebellion, Hard Times and the Viral
Collapse has been the *interdependence* of the various worlds of the
Imperium.  (My own opinion is that this has been over played, but then
I frequently find myself at odds with what is canonical.)  Thus, the
loss of much of the Imperium is going to be a severe blow even in the
Domain/Regency and this loss ought to be most severely felt on those
most technologically advanced worlds that were most closely tied to the
Imperial infrastructure - like Depot.

Finally, there is this issue of just what is measured by technology level.
The Traveller literature has long struggled with this but I believe the
most common interpretation has been that TL indicates what technology is
most commonly available in and around the world\'s starport.  This really
doesn\'t speak to me because it seems then that every world ought to be
TL 9 at a minimum by definition!  I mean *starship* are going to be the
`most common\' technology at any starport.  Furthermore, this take is not
particluarly useful when interstellar commerce is interrupted and 
conditions at the starport may change much more drastically than on the
world as a whole.

My own view is that TL represents the production capability of the world.
It\'s the level of technology at which most indigenous goods and services
are provided.  This sometimes gets difficult to explain due to the 
variations and combinations produced by the world generations rules but
you must have guessed by now that I\'m not one to abandon a rational
explanation just because it\'s in conflict with some ill-considered rule
published in one of the `holy books\'.  :-)

Summary: What weapons should be mounted on an MBT and why - for

Seems to me damage and penetration per FF&S\'s authors is a function
of energy release at the point of impact.  Therefore energy efficiency
as it relates to the amount delivered to the point of impact and the
amount generated is the key.  OK, with that in mind it should definitely
be the case that a TL 8 laser is inferior to a TL 8 KEAP round.  The 
energy transfer is just much more efficient.

But what about a TL14 Laser vs a TL 14 KEAP?  By this point, it seems to me,
the laser should be more efficient at transferring energy to the target.
But is it?  Could it be the *type* of energy release?  KEAP rounds use
Kinetic energy of a very hard object hitting at very high speed to penetrate
armor, Lasers use heat energy to try to "burn" through armor or damage
components.`

I guess the point is that the laser is a "softer" penetrator.

So the question becomes, why mount lasers?  Is there some advantage to
using lasers to do damage instead of KEAP rounds?  and does this 
advantage outweigh the cost of the added weight and power requirements
(plus maint., spare parts, etc. etc.). 

Also let\'s think in terms of deployment considerations.  I want to deploy
a division of Imperial Armor via starship.  It is worth a tremendous amount
of time and resources to *not* need ammunition shipped in to supply that
division.  For this reason I\'m willing to sacrifice *some* killing power
to mount a laser or other DE weapon (whose ammo is easily supplied i.e.
hydrogen) instead of a KEAP weapon whose ammo needs to be hauled six sectors
in vulnerable supply ships.

Tac-Nukes work great in the desert, or otherwise unoccupied areas, but 
armored fighting vehicles are also expected to take city streets and
arable land which their employers expect to use later on.  a nuke (even
a small one) might not be feasable in light of mission objectives.

I wonder what TL OGRE is?  Could the laser\'s delicacy have been corrected for
at higher TL?

This brings up another possibility though, using lasers as a secondary
weapon for "softer" targets and point defense work, saving the main gun
rounds for other MBTs, or perhaps substituting missile launch facilities 
for the main gun altogether.  The laser would be capable of penetrating
light armored vehicles and killing more delicate "aircraft" or "attack
grav vehicles", Missiles would come into play for harder targets.  This would 
also give non-direct fire capability to the vehicle.  It would, however,
raise the cost of each "kill" since a KEAP round has proven much cheaper
than a guided missile ever could be.  Also, I think that missiles would be
somewhat easier to counter than KEAP rounds due to their necesarily slower
speed.  In fact, the secondary laser turret would be a good tool for
"shooting down" such missiles.

I think the designers of the TNE combat system were told to keep the potential
complications down (they didn\'t) which means leaving out heterogenous armor
combinations.  I was reading about Chobham armor recently and wondered
why Superdense couldn\'t be layered with some similarly hard substance, just
to get the layered effects.  

Making good old reflec or ablat an AFV armor (I still think it should be a 
personal armor option!) would complicate things, but not unduly,  a seperate
penetration value would be used for DE attacks (the first time only with ablat)
and KE attacks.  This idea is not needed, however, if lasers are not as good
penetrators as lasers.  Whay have two types of armor when conventional is 
so resistant to lasers anyway?  Perhaps on lightly armored vehicles it would
be an advantage.

OK, Just a summary and I\'ll stop using up space :).  MBT design for high
tech Imperial (I\'m talking pre-collapse here) or other space-deployed
units would have a heavily armored (conventional) hull with dual turrets
(I like the over-under config - was that Rob Dean\'s idea?).  Primary
armament a large (12cm, 14cm) smoothbore ETC CPR gun, loadout primary
KEAP penetration rounds (topside turret), secondary I would put a heavy
laser (one with lightly-armored vehicle penetration capability) on the 
underside turret, and two light lasers for point defense and soft target
capability positioned to cover overhead and either side of the vehicle
(the larger laser can be pressed into underside point defense).

This way the vehicle is not dependent on ammunition supply to be useful
(a compromise, of course).  It fulfills both a support role and a self-
defendable MBT "tank killer" role.  It is orbit-deployable (oops, did I 
say it was a grav vehicle?  good old thruster plate/Magatraveller style
self propelled "we don\'t need no stinkin\' heplar" grav vehicle), and 
a "hard target".

As the common vehicle of Imperial battalions I would set design TL as about 
TL 14 or so.  A TL 15 variant in first-line units, and TL 13 in reserve
units and local militia.

I\'ll try to get a design for this vehicle together to check the feasability 
of such a thing, what ammo load it could carry etc.

This is a good point.  I\'m something of a Sword Worlder though (I was in
the *JTAS* `draft\' a long time ago and served in the Confederation Second
Grav Tank Corps during the 5FW) and decided to `be conservative\' and choose
the lower TL choice in my modifications for TNE to avoid any suggestion
of partisanship.  I\'m curious what others think of this issue.

I agree with Hans\'s point but I think this has major ramifications for the
Regency and other Spinward States in TNE.  As Alistair suggests above one
would expect the Viral threat to serve as an important motivator for all
interstellar states to seek to overcome the economic and social obstacles
to the spread of their highest technological capabilites.

Just as the Regency is most likely sending scientists and engineers from
its TL 15 worlds to study on Vincennes, I would think the Sword Worlds 
would be doing the same.  They might even put aside their distaste for
Imperials and Zhodani in order to participate in technological exchange
programs with them.

It was in the interests of the Imperium to maintain the technological
diversity of its worlds - it made the lower-tech worlds easier to control
through advanced technology and the higher-tech worlds easier to control
through control of the means of transportation and communication between
them.

Such motivations become suspect in the face of Virus.


Finally, Bill White <whitew@eden.rutgers.edu> writes a whole bunch

I agree with much of what Bill writes - his argument is well thought out.
I, too, prefer to `rationalize\' the `inconsistencies\' that appear due
to `glitches\' in the rules.  With Traveller world generation though these
`inconsistencies\' are, IMHO, just too rampant.  Yes, there may be policy
reasons for the Imperium to subsidize `un-needed\' starports and
to promote settlement of `Nifflheims\' when several `Edens\' are just
a week away, but I find it impossible to explain these sorts of decisions
when such explanations often become necessary for multiple occurrences in
a single subsector.

I don\'t like rules, but world generation is one of those places where
a lot of useful information is generated very quickly - a good measure
of the usefulness of a rule - and in this instance we\'re still plagued
with relics that were developed a long time ago when sci-fi role-
playing was still relatively new.  It was fine - even fun and interesting -
to have such `awkward\' worlds when we were just adventuring in Regina
subsector but now that the entire galaxy is at our disposal I think it\'s
time for a little tinkering with the mechanics.

Scheherazade Wavecatcher appeared in *Melbourne Times* #1.  She ought to
be easily adaptable to just about any Traveller campaign - even the dreaded
New Era.  :-)

Scheherazade Wavecatcher

Scheherazade is an attractive, middle-aged Dolphin female.  She is somewhat
small for a female Dolphin and her soft build reveals her non-athletic nature.
In atmosphere, Scheherazade is always dressed in a stylish e-suit with integral
waldos, voder and contragravity.  In hydrosphere, she is typically unclothed. 
Scheherazade usually scorns the use of translation devices, relying instead
upon here own linguistics skills.  Just in case though, her voder is equipped
with a full translator for use in emergencies.  She often carries a
computer-recorder and comm-link.

Scheherazade speaks native Delphinese and understands most major Human
languages as well as Meren and several Aeroi dialects.  She can speak all these
languages with the use of her voder.  Her words tend to come quickly when she
is excited or angry, but she has learned to control this in professional
situations.  A natural diplomat, Scheherazade is gregarious and a facilitator
of conversations.

Scheherazade has mastered the social skills required of a diplomat, but several
of her assignments in less sophisticated areas of society have led to her
comfort among them as well.  She is also quite able to persuade others of her
point of view.  She is an innovator and highly adept at adjusting to new
situations.  She is often looked to as a leader.  Her own respect for authority
is generally tolerant.
  
Scheherazade has few interests outside her work.  Fortunately, the work of a
freelance diplomat requires a broad range of interests.  Scheherazade has
extensive contact throughout the diplomatic community, especially in economic
and criminal law fields.

Scheherazade has two co-mothers to whom she is very close.  She is similarly
close to her sole brother.  She has a single birth-daughter who has not spoken
to her in years.  She is closer to her two care-sons.  Recently, she has become
involved romantically with Ulfilas Yellowknell, a writer of some renown.
She has made professional enemies of Pelham O\'Boyle, a Commonwealth army
officer who was court-martialed as a result of her investigations early in her
career, and of Akbar Aubademaker, an instructor at the Universidad de Lima who
attempted unsuccessfully to take credit for her research.  She counts
Jacqueline deVlaminck, a pirate encountered while negotiating the Nyanza
Anti-piracy Protocol, and Dean Quadros, a belter she met during her work on the
VanMaanen Mining Accords, among her professional friends.

Somewhat typically of Dolphins, Scheherazade is an idealist.  She has gone
freelance to pursue her belief in greater harmony among all peoples, a position
that was not always fostered in the Commonwealth diplomatic corps.  Her
continued association with Hsun Li, her former superior in the Corps, has lead
to several challenging assignments for a wide variety of clients.  Most
recently she has served as a trade negotiator for Aeroi interests in Ourora
subsector in the aftermath of the Markets War.

Earth is the homeworld of both Dolphins and Humans and the birthplace of Terran
civilization.  All Terran states in the Earth Colonies Sphere were originally
colonized by settlers from Earth, or their descendants.

Earth is the capital and most important world of the Commonwealth of Earth. 
The world suffered extensive ecological damage during the 21st through 24th
Centuries and only recently has most of the damage been erased.  Earth of the
31st Century is closer to the \'garden planet\' of yore than it has been since
the rise of industrial civilization.  Scattered among its vast oceans and
forests are gleaming megalopolises.  Exploitation of natural resources has been
abandoned in favor of a balanced stewardship.

Kerry -
     I wrote the articles in collaboration with James Holden.  That
segment is actually a condensation of something in the Grand
Explorations manuscript which Geo Gelinas and I wrote.  (Although the
book was ultimately cancelled, the material might begin to see print
soon in the form of magazine articles.)
     The similarities to Theta Borealis sector, published by Group One,
were deliberate so as to lend validity to that product.
     You\'re welcome to forward this information back to whoever
posted the above.  Thanks.                                        MIKE

The Group Program
     In 359, the Scouts began a massive deep space exploration effort,
named the Group Program after Dr Sylvester Group, the prominent
scientist that lead the campaigned for it.  The primary objective was
to send ships with astronomical sensors well outside the Imperium.  At
the same time, the ships would carry exploration teams to study the
systems along the way.  With the support of other scientists from a
wide range of fields, he won the endorsement of several dukes and
ultimately that of the Emperor Anguistus.
     The project set up headquarters at Deneb and prepared two series
of missions focused on two different directions roughly ninety degree
apart from one another.  The series called Group One focused on areas
to spinward, while Group Two went to coreward.  Each set up a
permanent colony on a remote hospitable world to support these remote
scientific endeavors.
     Group One established itself at Pautho (Theta Borealis 1506
A567456-E V), a very hospitable world, but barren at the time.
Imperium-wide attention given the projects attracted numerous
engineers and technicians to settle the colony.  They rapidly set up a
class A starport, city, and hinterland with the lavish support of the
Scout supply line.  The colony tech level started out fully at the
Imperial maximum (TL13).
     Advanced scouts particularly selected Theta Borealis for its many
budding minor races.  The colonists recruited a few thousand to help
build the colony.  In return, Pautho gave the aliens technological
assistance which allowed a few to start their own interstellar
communities after a couple of centuries.  Humans from Pautho often
settled on these alien worlds to form commercial companies.
     Meanwhile, Group Two settled Geokha (Sigma Zephyrus 3210
A689559-E V) in the same fashion.  This sector, called Zhiaqrqiats in
the Zhodani language, was rich in Ancient sites.  Geokha itself had an
enormous intact Ancient city completely untouched by the Final War.
However, the Ancient withdrawal was evidently quite orderly, leaving
little to physically ship back to the Imperium for study.  The
searchings by scientists and the occasional artifact hunters
periodically encounter rich finds, though.

Except the background, that is.  Many of the supposed barriers
to travel would not exist without this as at least a practical
requirement (for example, you can do it, but you waste fuel and
it adds an element of danger).

An example from Classic Traveller is the Great Rift, and the
corresponding J-n routes across it which would no longer be needed
(before saying they\'re for traders, think about the cost savings
of using a smaller Jump drive and the fact that you have more cargo
space by making a series of smaller jumps--besides, they weren\'t
just for traders).

An example from TNE (which I don\'t own) is the Regency\'s defense
against the virus.  I guess TNE claims they are covering every
cubic meter in a shell 6 parsecs thick around the Regency (which
is ludicrous--they would have to be able to INSTANTLY destroy any
ship coming out of jump in that area and NEVER fail).  More likely,
they are covering every planet and gas giant at the border.  Of
course, this doesn\'t work if it\'s easy to jump to empty space.
There would be a whole chain of Virus refueling stations extending
throughout the Regency\'s open space by now (scary, isn\'t it?).
Make it a little harder to do, and the refueling stations still
appear at the border (slowly), giving the blockade fleets another
horror they have to face before it\'s too late (not to mention the
occassional deep-space jump patrol popping in on top of literal
fortresses just inside of Regency space).

It\'s possible they don\'t often make much economic sense.  (Maybe I\'ll do
a quick analysis sometime.)  But they might make very good military
sense, as a refueling depot.  All you need are the hulls for holding
the LHyd fuel, tanker/tugs to haul them around and fill them up, and
a parsec or so to hide them in.  I don\'t know whether the logistical
assets to support such a venture would be worth tying up or not.


On Depot and its\' TL16:

Point taken.  However, I think that Depot\'s tech is supportable on
the Domain\'s resources.  Deneb has enough TL15 worlds to handle any
materiel Depot got from other worlds at that tech level (maybe with
some retooling) and it would be fairly difficult and time-consuming
to ship anything significant from further away.  The nearest TL16
world outside Deneb was the capital of Corridor, Kaasu (Corr. 1209).
The only other TL16 worlds in that direction are the two in Vland,
Gemid and Lukham.  So Depot had to be fairly self-sufficient in the
way of manufacturing.  And from what we\'re told, typical Imperial
naval policy dictated this.  Still, I\'d expect short-term equipment
problems, especially with experimental ships like the uprated TL17
armed Voroshilev battleships, since those contractors and that project
was not originally in Deneb.  It still will be rough for a couple
of decades, but not I believe, insurmountable.  

Hmm...Depot (Deneb) may have been centered on Imperial prototype
development and testing, as well as high tech production.  Does
anyone else remember any TL16 naval depots?  (It seems to me that
some of the depots were designed with major secondary missions.
Except Depot (Corridor).  Its\' secondary mission was its\' primary
mission -- to be the biggest naval base in the Imperium!) :)

>My own view is that TL represents the production capability of the world.

Agreed.  I really liked the DGP _World Builder\'s Handbook_ development
of the tech level concept into types of technology at different levels,
with UWP tech level represented as the height of commonly available
technology on the world.  That didn\'t rule out weird tech level 
variations in places, or lower tech in undeveloped regions, and so on.
For instance, UWP tech for modern Earth was 8, best representing the
planetary production (i.e. the industrialized, computerized "First
World" countries), but low common was only 6, representing the best
available elsewhere.  The book, if you can still find a copy, presented
a nice flexible system.


On Imperial Politics:

The x-boat system is an interesting case study.  When designed in the
mid-600s, it was state of the art: tech 13, jump four.  (Although
the Imperium was considered tech 14 in 700, so the government probably
had many jump five ships by then).  After four hundred years of service
it was still jump four.  While political reasons for having a slower
information system have been expressed (the government gets news by
jump six first), there are other considerations.  The x-mail system
may have been aging, but it still worked, and it would be terribly
expensive to redesign the entire system for jump six.  What if the
way stations would need to be moved?  Think of the expense of the
new x-boat designs!  [Especially in the old Classic Trav design
system which explains why we have the xboats we do!]

Even so, prior to the Fifth Frontier War, there had been talk of
building a jump six express route from Regina to Capital in order
to keep closer track of the Zhodani situation.  (Which may have been
Imperial sabre-rattling, but is still interesting.)  TNS news
releases on such things were in the 5FW game, and may have been in
JTAS was well.

I\'ve only gotten through part of Jim\'s discussion but if you\'re going
to participate in our current world generation discussion then I
strongly urge you to check this out first.  It will save us a *great*
deal of duplication.


Andy Lilly <A.S.Lilly@bnr.co.uk> asks with regard to the Earth Colonies
world generation variant I posted:

It\'s not that you\'re not reading the tables correctly it\'s just that I
didn\'t bother to explain them.  The description of government types C+
as \'democratic oligarchies\' merely describes the nature of authority and
consent under these governments.  The \'democratic\' means that ultimately
the government enjoys some level of consent (even if that\'s merely a
consent to oppression in the face of an alternative of death - which is
what permits the oppression to continue) from the populace.  Since high
government levels result from large populations some sort of consent
*has* to exist.

The \'oligarchy\' in the government type description merely describes the
agent that exercises authority.  In this case, a group of individuals
(as a opposed to the single individual of an autarchy).  At C+ we get
an oligarchy again because population levels are high which strains
the ability of a single individual to exercise authority.

The specific characteristics of this \'democratic oligarchy\' are left
to the referee.  If you prefer a theocracy go right ahead.  The rules
are simply constructed to permit an extremely oppressive government
type without requiring that it be characterized as theocratic.  (A view
expressed in the canonical rules that, IMHO, reflects the Western humanist
bias of the original developers rather than an objective take on
government types - there was nothing \'religious\' about the rule of Sauron
in Mordor!)

How would this affect the inter-planet dealings? Individual Sword Worlds

Ah, but thats the whole point. You don\'t have the factories because you can
buy your TL 12 stuff cheaper from Sacnoth than you can build them yourself.
And you don\'t build that ship yourself becuase it\'s cheaper to buy it from
Sacnoth, too. This also impose a natural restriction on Sacnoth\'s ability to 
dominate the Confederation: If they become too expensive the other worlds 
_will_ build TL 12 factories  -  which will propably trigger a recession on 
Sacnoth and close down a lot of industry  -  quite possibly enough to drop 
Sacnoth a TL in the process. That\'s what I mean by economic cycles.

On the contrary, there is a lot of intergration. That\'s why their economies
can affect each other that way. What they don\'t have is much economic 
_control_. Each world will do what seems best for itself.

How do you know that? By that logic the independent worlds along the edge
of the Imperium should have fallen to the Imperium long ago too. They are
certainly even weaker than the Confederation. Lots of independant worlds
have fallen to the Imperium in the old days. But the Imperium had to stop
somewhere. It happened to be before they swallowed the Sword Worlds (Of
course, the fact that the present Sword world government (centered on Gram)
is rumoured to be heavily backed by Zhodani money may explain a lot). The
Imperium did occupy 12 of the Sword Worlds for a time after the Third 
Frontier War, as a matter of fact. They just decided to go home again.

(Do me a favour and describe how a feudal technocracy functions. Of all the
government types that\'s the one I\'ve never been quite clear about. I have
a vague idea, but I can\'t quite see how it would work in practice). Anyway,
as I said above, the Confederation is not one.

Because it was only one of 20+ worlds and the rest wanted it differently?

Why should it? It is tied to political power. One source of political power
is technology, but it\'s not the only one. Besides, the leadership dosen\'t
fluctuate all that much. The Sword Worlds had been led by Gram for centuries 
in 1120.

Elucidate please. I\'m not trying to be snide, I actually can\'t see why that
should affect the inter-planet relationships.

Oh, dear! You really have a gamer\'s mentality, don\'t you? (And, yes, here I
am being snide ;-) The Sword Worlds have had their civil wars, true, but
they don\'t have them twice a decade. I think they\'ve had four or five in
15 centuries. They\'re not the local Monday Evening Gaming Club trying to
do each other down, reasoning that having 50 \'victory points\' and win is
better than having 500 points and lose. Wars cost. Maybe the Sacnoth 
leaders think a destructive stalemate would destroy too much. And, as
I\'ve mentioned above, if Sacnoth dosen\'t sell those ships then the other
worlds _will_ build the factories to make the parts and build their own. If 
that\'s the way it works, then the only reason why the other worlds are not 
TL 12 is precisely that Sacnoth IS selling them ships and spare parts.

If you haven\'t read the discussion from last year\'s TML made available
by Jim Vassilakos <jimv@ucrengr.UCR.EDU> some of this might not make any
sense.  Also, note that I originally sent this message as mail directly
to Jim.  (So he\'s probably whom I mean when I write "you".)

My general feeling was that the discussion was starting to get a little
too complicated.  I guess I agree with Jim\'s comment of 19 Feb 93:

> Hmm... this is starting to entail lots
> of variables.

I\'m not much for rules in the first place.  My approach to role-playing is
to generally ignore the rules except when they can provide a lot of useful
information with a relatively small amount of effort.  This is illustrated
by the difference between the basic and extended canonical rules.  The
basic rules give plenty of info on the main worlds for a relatively small
amount of effort while the extended rules give lots of info for the (less
important) rest of the system *and* requires a great deal more effort.

That said, I do feel the basic rules need work which is why I developed
variant world generation tables for the Earth Colonies campaign (but that
only address the main world).

The concern about spectral types interested the scientist in me (I was an
engineering major) but pretty much bores the role-player in me (I\'m now a
humanities major).  I realize some `garden\' worlds get generated about
stars that sort of ruin the garden but I\'m willing to deal with that on
an individual basis.  (I realize though that this becomes an issue when
you seek to expand the system to include some sort of random life generation.)

I really liked the idea suggested by Bruce Pihlamae that proposed an
approach to developing worlds similar to that used to generate characters.
The generation of the geosphere, native biosphere, external cultural
influences and subsequent interactions seems very interesting.  (I also
like the `resonance\' of this approach with the character generation scheme.
This does begin to become a product of one\'s approach to one\'s particular
gaming universe though - another important point raised in the discussion.)
Unforunately, this particular stream of the discussion seems to have died
out.  (I also agree with your sense that this is more `world building\'
than `world generation\' - sort of like the `expanded\' character generation
rules - but I *do* like it.)

I\'ve jimmied (Oops!  Just realized you might not like that term.  :-) with
the trade classifications myself.  (In addition to many of the points raised
I\'ve always found the fact that waterworlds - Hyd A - can\'t be agricultural
to be more a product of our own land-lubber bias than objective consideration.)
Generally, though I\'ve never been satisfied with my limited attempts to
rectify this situation.  This is probably due to the fact that trade codes
don\'t really matter except in the trade and commerce rules.  Not being
much for rules anyway I just don\'t encounter the trade codes that much.

The other point I found of interest was the notion of some sort of `life
scale\' that details the sophistication of native life.  In general I come
down on the side of this measure not addressing technological accomplishment
(sentience is important regardless of TL, IMHO).  On the other hand I\'m
uncomfortable with randomly occurring sophonts but the idea of a code that
will tell me whether the local life consists of water-borne single-cell
organisms or highly sophisticated mobile predators does seem quite useful.
I see no problem just adding this code to the `Remarks\' section of the UWP.
Say a code like `LX\' where the `X\' is the UWP digit.  (I\'ve added columns
under `Remarks\' in the Earth Colonies campaign that address local defense
battalions and system defense boats already.)

I find the `Resource\' measure of less use.  Planets are pretty large bodies
and most will possess *some* sort of resources.  It seems to me that more
important will be the *accessibility* of those resources which leads you
back to `good\' biospheres.  (No matter how much lanthanum there is on some
`hell-hole\' there is a price to be paid to extract that resource in such
an environment - making it ultimately less valuable, unless you *can\'t* get
it somewhere else - and if I can\'t get it anywhere else, how did I find it
to be useful in the first place?)

The last issue I feel I need to address is the suggestion that government
and law level might influence tech level.  First off, you\'ll see from the
variant world generation that I posted from the Earth Colonies that I\'ve
rejected the government types from Traveller (which were always problematic,
IMHO) in favor of a government characteristic that attempts to address the
nature of popular consent and the exercise of authority that is unrelated
to the specific manifestation of that consent and exercise of authority.
I also abandon the `weapons restrictions\' guidelines for law level in favor
of a more loosely defined level of government intrusiveness that primairly
manifests itself in `encounter throws\' for the local police - whether
such an encounter occurs because of a weapons violation, expired license,
or your haircut is up to the referee.

That said, I would be very careful about any modification of tech level by
government type or law level because such modification is highly susceptible
to contemporary political views about the nature of technology and the
practice of science that are extremely lacking in objectivity.  Even in
the TML discussion there was a great deal more ideology than technology - both
with respect to `oppressive vs. open\' government types and with repsect to the
nature of government intrusiveness (law level) into the practice of science
and technology.  (I say this as a practicing engineer currently involved
in the joint US-Russian space program *and* as a soon-to-be science and
technology policy graduate student.)

Excellent article!  Exactly the kind of thing I subscribe to this list
to read!  

When I roll up systems, I don\'t muck with the starport or population 
rules.  I like the challenge that results from having to explain why
a world has 10 billion people on it when its temperature is 100 below
zero and has an insidious atmosphere.

If the rules change so that only garden worlds have high populations,
then each worlds starts to look suspiciously the same.

Regency Quarantine Service

In the years following the withdrawal of the Corridor Fleet the Domain
of Deneb Navy & Scout assets conducted a fighting retreat before the
onslaught of the Vargr invasions.  In 1125 the frontier of the Domain
had been pushed back to the spinward half of Deneb Sector while the
other half had been reduced to Wilds.

When Norris established the Quarantine (312-1130) the Patrol was
combined with part of the Regency Interstellar Scout Service
(Exploration and External Mapping branches) to form the Regency
Quarantine Service (RQS).  Communications (xboat & courier service) and
Internal Mapping functions remained unchanged (within the borders of the
Regency).  The RQS soon became a separate service.

The Quarantine border was extended to more defensible positions and is
several parsecs deep to prevent high jump performance ships from leaping
over the blockade.  By 1201 this border ran through the following
subsectors:

        Deneb:          B - G - K - O
        Reft:                   C - B - F - E - I
        Trojan Reach:   L - P - O
        Riftspan Reaches:       C - G - F - E

The Scout/Courier ships now available to the RQS were modified to create
Quarantine Cutters quickly followed by the addition of 70-ton Inspection
Launches.  The RQS still wasn\'t able to maintain a virus-proof seal
along the entire border which resulted in the creation of the RQS
Auxiliary comprised of private citizens assisting the patrol of the
border.  Later 150-ton Quarantine Cutters (stretched versions of the
Scout) entered into use by the RQS.

The above data on the RQS is pieced together from Survival Margin and
T:TNE manual.  The following is my conjectures on tactics of the RQS as
well as some additional necessary assets.  For each system that contains
gas giant(s) and/or a world with water present the RQS will need to base
assets able to defend those sites and send messages to other systems in
the Zone.  This would include manned bases in position around such
planets and small fighter craft in addition to the ships normally in use
by the RQS.

When a ship arrives at a system within the Zone and is detected by RQS
sensors they will be hailed.  If they respond they will be instructed to
rendezvous with either a Quarantine Cutter or an Inspection Launch
depending on the size of the ship.  If any problems arise when
communication is attempted the RQS will dispatch armed craft (either
Cutters or fighters who tend to shoot first and ask questions later.
Fighters would be designed with high manuever capabilities and would be
based at all refueling sources.

They would not be launched until a suspect ship is fairly close.  This
provides multiple benefits: the fighters have ample fuel, the incoming
ships are low on fuel, the bases are close-by so are able to provide
heavy fire support (Particle Accelerators and Meson Guns).  Another
option would be to replace some or all of the fighters with remotely
piloted vehicles operated from the base.

Finally should incoming hostile forces overcome an RQS base there must
be some means for notifying other nearby systems.  This is accomplished
by maintaining a small unmanned station outside of the 100 diameter zone
which contains jump torpedoes.  When RQS forces are nearly overwhelmed a
signal is sent to the station which then launches all of its torpedoes.
Each torpedo is preset to enter jumpspace at the proper time.  One
torpedo is sent to each nearby system.  As part of the notification
signal additional data can be transmitted and sent with the torpedo such
as compostion of enemy forces.  When the torpedo arrives at its
destination it begins broadcasting its message to RQS bases.  This
system is a response to the Rape of Trin and currently only 1 in 3
systems are equiped with these stations.


Next:  The RQS in 1200 and beyond.

I agree with the majority of the discussion that followed.  Large
artificial habitats will no doubt be avoided like the plague (or the
Virus).  Smaller AHs (not Avalon Hills! :)  will only be established if
the need is great enough.  BTW this only applies to such groups as the
RC, the Regency would not have such phobias.

An example would be Kruyter which is inhabited by RC workers of a
private corporation attemting to recover minerals and relic equipment.
This would provide the only good reason for returning to such worlds.
If additonal reasons for the continued habitation of the world are found
(such as being a J-2 way station between more important systems) then
possibly the colony would continue to exist.

As far as the tech needed and phobia toward such I think if people are
willing to trust returning to space in ships they will have no problem
with AHs.  They will of course take all the precautions used on
spacecraft to deter Virus infection.

  I agree that the stats seem to be a result of applying a mechanical
system to the process without editing the results.  As the Regency and
other peoples further spinward were not touched by the Virus (with a few
exceptions) they would not have suffered the degradations suffered by
worlds in the Wilds.  In addition during the first few decades the
economies, tech levels, and possibly populations may very well have
increased for the following reasons:

        - the Zhodani and Regency entered a new, more peaceful stage in
their association with each other

        - with the loss of Corridor and contact with the Imperium the
Regency needed to produce more items for self-sufficiency.  What they
couldn\'t produce would be purchased from the Zhos, Darrians, Sword
Worlds, etc.

        - ship building outside the Regency probably increased and
starport quality with it.  To successfully equip the RQS ships were
needed, ships not available from the Imperium.  The Regency would need
nearly all of its shipyards to produce RQS ships.  Civilians would have
to go elsewhere and initially that would probably be to Gram in the
Sword Wlds and Mire & Jacent in the darrian Confederation.  An effort to
upgrade other starports to capture a share in this new market would be
made by the Sword Wlds, Darrians, Arden & Border Wlds.

The updated stats seem well thought out and well within the bounds of
believability.

playing Classic Traveller.  The last one struck me last night after dropping
someone of at the airport.

Idea 1:
The Imperial Police Agent:  This came from an idea involving extradiction
of criminals from countries and even states within countries.  Basically
if a criminal commits a crime on planet A and then flees to planet B, who
brings the criminal to have justice on planet A.  The Imperial Police 
Agent was different from bounty hunters in that they were given a ship
for there use and have powers of arrest on all planets.  If they required
extra help on the arrest they could enlist the aid of the Imperial Navy.

I used this idea as a campaign for a group of two people.  It is better
suited for a small group.


Idea 2:
Planetary Dictator:  I want to have the some fun playing planetary 
governments.  The players have to form a political party on a democratic
world and get into power.  Once in power they have to try maintain their
hold on power.  This can be done democratically or by coming up with a way
to form a dictatorship.  In the game I played a planetary civil war enabled
the P.C.\'s to declared marital law, they just forgot to remove it.


Idea 3:
The Customs Barrier:  After going through security at the airport here
I noticed two things:  it is very light, and in all the traveller games
I have played I have never had to go through security or customs at a
starport.  For this adventure the PC\'s have just landed on a high law
level world and are trying to get through customs.  Unknown to the PC\'s
(unless they ask) the government has decided to outlaw a large range of
items.  Items outlaw should included an item on of the PC\'s is carrying
i.e. the wearing of black items of clothing is now outlawed.

The search for contraband should be extensive and maybe involve guards
with rubber gloves etc.  This gives the PC\'s a chance to use those little
used admin, bibery, streetwise skills.

Also the guards will be lightly armed and armoured with a large heavy 
armed and armoured swat team as backup.  This team would be hidden away.
The players in my group have a nasty habit of shooting problems.

I hope these ideas are of some help

I understand that the Italian M4 Spectre have a clip magazine capacity
of 50 rounds.  It has a length comparable to most 20-30 rounds
magazine by using a four column arrangement.  If you keep that in mind
higher capacity clip magazine doesn\'t *have* to mean a significantly
longer length.

I don\'t recall which version of the Calico appeared in C72, but the
9mm model comes with a 50 round held in a helix pattern on top of the
weapon.  A 100 round version is also available.

If you\'re really worry about the physical bulk of the magazine, take
the solution used by some version of the HK G11.  The stock breaks
opens and a 100 round brick of its caseless ammo is inserted w/o any
metal/plastic jackets.  pretty niffy ah?

With 40+ referees with active Traveller campaigns frequenting the TML,
between them there must be a LOT of NPC\'s floating around out there.

One of the referee\'s most tedious tasks is to generate NPC\'s.  Oh,
how much easier life would be if there were an NPC pool from which
a ref could pull an NPC whenever he needed.  (sigh)

Such would be the case if each of you posted your NPC\'s to the TML.
Take advantage of the leverage of cooperation, contribute your efforts,
and receive in return the efforts of 40!

The concept is starting to catch on, as several people have already
submitted theirs.  The NPC pool is growing!


NPC\'s are the life-blood of any campaign.  I love to read other refs\'
NPC\'s because it reflects their RPG-running style, and is a window inot
their imagination.  There are a lot of refs on the TML who would also
love to see your NPC\'s...

I hope you liked the 3 characters I included with the latest episode
of They Came From Beyond.  I hope to have episode 4 posted by the end
of the upcoming weekend (whew, these episodes take far longer to write
than the original adventure took to play!).

Having fun,
Rodge.

Apart from having long banana magazines, you can double your ammo capacity
by the quick\'n\'dirty method of taping or clipping two magazines together.
Modern magazines have their capacity increased by being thicker so that
they contain two columns of rounds.

Drums tend to be less reliable than straight magazines.

The big advantage of a top- or side-mounted magazine is that you can lie
prone and it doesn\'t get in the way.

Finally, if you have too big a magazine, it becomes heavy enough to upset
the balance of the weapon.  In the case of pistols and bullpup rifles,
this is not such a serious problem as if the magazine is mounted forward.

The major problem as I see it is the loss of cargo space where you
have to carry the extra fuel.  Any of these deep space refueling
stations would be expensive to operate.  I would guess that a
constant stream of tankers would be necessary to support a busy
deep space station.
 
The few imperial ships that are meant to function by using a deep
space stopover, usually carry a fuel bladder in their cargo hold,
or would have the extra fuel capacity built in.  The Imperiallines
Type TJ Frontier Transport is a ship that comes to mind with it\'s
jump 6 capability as opposed to the Type TI Frontier Transport
with its J-2 capablility.  The TJ is meant as a special courier
and is designed as such. The TJ even looks like the TI for
security reasons.
 
The one problem I have is with the TNE ship designs.  Now that we
are back to somewhat realistic thrusters, I find that I need more
fuel for my M-drives than for the J-drive.  So if you are willing
to sacrifice maneuverablity when you exit from jump, most TNE ship
already have the capability to do a deep space stopover without
carrying extra fuel.
 
CT and MT ships however would need to carry extra fuel.  I agree
that a deep space stopover is allowable, however it should be a
MAJOR problem to do so.  Either the refueling problem, difficult
piloting (or rather navigation) task, or something.  It is
allowable as it is the way the Aslan bridged the Riftspan Reach
gap (commercial ships are still only J-2 or J-3).  See GDW Alien
Module 1 for details.
 
I disagree that it creates a big problem with the Virus and the
Regency blockade.  The Virus doesn\'t have the refueling capability
to move a large fleet by the way of a deep space stop, and knowing
that the regency is watching for them, they wouldn\'t put
themselves at such a tactical disadvantage. (Less than 20 G-turns
of fuel remaining as opposed to the 40+ G-turns fully fueled)
 
It makes even less sense for merchantmen to use smaller J-drives
as this increases the travel time and decreases the profit.

One last point, In Arrival Vengence the ship rendevous with a deep
space comet for refueling on the way back to the regency.  This
allowed them to cross the Great Rift through the Gushemege,
Corridor, and Deneb sectors.  But the location and orbit of the
comet was a state secret for such an emergency.

Re: 1. I know ALOT of people dislike T:TNE. Is it due to the system, or

    2. What would people change in the current Traveller version?
                         and
    Contents of T:TNE Deluxe Edition

Several months ago this very topic was heatedly discussed on TML and
I\'ve included a humorous summary that was posted:

Once upon a time, before the sinking of F.G.U. and the rise of Star Wars
licensed products, there was a game called Traveller. It came in three
small booklets and it was good. But with the waning of the years of
innocence GDW did look upon the face of their sales, and lo, begat Mega
Traveller of Many Colours, and did fill it with many fine and strangely
crafted rules. But yeah the people of the Imperium did look upon the new
creation wrought in the image of the three books and lo saw that it was
flawed. Listening to the torment of the multitiude GDW did release
errata sheets; and they were legion. And the people did name the Many
Coloured One "Typo Traveller" and were filled with dismay.

With the passing of the age of Innocence came \'The New Era\', and there
was many wiping of slates clean. And lo the sides of the die did
multiply thricefold and more, the Imperium was swept away, and the
people did weep. Yet from within the lamentation the people did look
upon the new book and did like the new uncluttered task system and
rejoiced over character generation. And yeah they threw down their laser
carbines for they were as nought in the face of the enemy, and picked up
rifled muskets for they had better penetration at small range than the
ACR with DS rounds.

And yet in this moment of triumph \'Errata\', the Evil One, did once more
spoil the party with seditious mistakes and inconsistencies.

And it is Now, and I that speak to you from the far distant land of
England. A land that has not yet seen the light of FF&S or indeed this:

 U> From: gt6963c@prism.gatech.edu
 U> There are 2 books and 1 booklet in the deluxe box:  TNE rules, FF&S,
 U> and an "upgrade" booklet that covers changes to the main rules that
 U> have been made by the creation of FF&S.  It says that "updated rule
 U> books will have the designation version 1 mod 1, dec 1993 on the
 U> title page".
 U> John

With confusion and a sadly dwindeling bank account, I seek T:TNE Errata
to fill the holes in our blessed book. Sages of the TML, answer me:

   What errata is currently available?
   Where may such wise lore be found?
   Does this involve more than changes to system travel times?
   Will GDW slay Errata for good with version 1 mod 1?

I can only watch and hope.

It seems that the less TMLers were upset over the game system (a
combination of Classic Traveller (CT) & Twilight 2000 (T2K)) as they
were over the setting (i.e. the eradication of the 3rd Imperium (3I).
Many of us who\'ve played Traveller for some time were devastated at the
loss of the 3I, or more pointedly GDW\'s apparent intention to stop
support of such with modules & sourcebooks & move in new directions.

GDW not only changed the system but also the setting all at once and
officially has left the 3I behind as but a note in history.  The rules
overhaul in my opinion is good.  The character skills have been heavily
altered but still have the Traveller flavor.  Combat has changed to the
T2K system, I agree somewhat with A. Shock\'s opinion regarding lasers (I
would limit their pen to 2-2-2 as non-rigid armor does nothing to
lasers) and automatic fire (it seems that more damage is done by firing
the full number of single shots that if the weapon is fired on full
automatic!!).  These rules are GDW\'s \'house rules\' that they now use for
all their (dwindling) rpgs.  The boxed set includes the rules book which
contains all the rules:
        character creation
        task resolution
        world building, space travel, commerce,
                equip maintenance & repairs (a la T2K), psionics
        combat - planetary (i.e. individual), vehicle, & space
        equipment list

in one 380 pg tome which also includes 2 scenarios (one in the RC & one
in the Wilds).  Also included is Fire,Fusion, & Steel which is a tech
design book for firearms, vehicles, and spacecraft plus a map of
Diaspora sector & accompanying stats (for both 1119 & 1200) plus char
gen charts.

The setting GDW seems to actively support is as follows: as the Final
War wound down Lucan was researching a secret weapon.  Dulinor
discovered this & raided the research base not knowing what was being
developed.  He thereby acquired the AI Virus & spread it.  The Virus was
bred for distruction and what the warring factions didn\'t destroy it did
- - leaving the former Imperium in ruins, depopulated, and in many cases
without space transport or contact.  Except for the Domain of Deneb (now
known as the Regency) which had warning of the Virus & set up a
Quarantine Zone at its borders.

Seventy-five years later the survivors are starting to crawl back into
space.  GDW is supporting one such area - the Reformation Coaltion.
This group first tried peaceful trade but their initial missions all ran
into serious trouble.  They then sent rescue missions which achieved
using force what the peaceful trade missions did not.  The RC is now
embarcked on a mission of reuniting all the worlds of the former
Imperium.  The only propblem is most of the worlds are run by TEDs.


Technically Advanced Dictators rule by might.  Nearly all the worlds of
the Imperium suffered a drop in Tech Lvl but some relic tech items are
left.  Those who have advanced weapons can rule over many even if they
are few in number.  The RC is democraticvally inclined (at the moment)
and therefore only wants like minded worlds to join (and will eliminate
TEDs to bring democratic rule to planets).

This is the Star Viking campaign which is described in the rules along
with mention of two alternate settings: the Spinward Sates (Regency) and
a Pocket Empire.

I personally rather like the current setting - the Imperium always
seemed too big & not subject to external threats.  Even the Zhodani were
only a threat to but a portion of one sector.  Nonetheless GDW should
have taken a cue fromTSR and maintained multiple settings.  Many of the
TMLers want the old Imperium.  The Regency is very similar but does not
seem to enjoy much official support.  GDW should issue products for both
the Regency and Reformation Coalition settings and possibly more (its
the new way to make money - Task Force Games does it with Star Fleet
Battles, Avalon Hill with Advanced Squad Leader, and TSR with their
multiverse of D&D settings).  On the TML we have started developing our
own background for the Regency.  Feel free to join in with your comments
and ideas.

First off, my cr0.02 about deep space jumps and refueling.  (Please keep
in mind my avowed aversion to rules details.)

I\'ve always considered that jump calculations use gravity wells as `targets\'.
The better your jump drive (jump-2 over jump-1, say) and/or the better your
navigator (navigation-2 over navigation-1, say) the better you are at
`targeting\' a specific gravity well.  Furthermore, the stronger a gravity
well (i.e. a star over a gas giant or giant over a rocky planet) the easier
it is to target  (it\'s also `stronger\' if you\'re closer).  Similarly, the
lesser the `interference\' of other gravity wells (no similarly or larger
massed objects in the vicinity - and `vicinity\' increases with mass) the
easier a specific gravity well is to target.

What this means is that in a typical system the largest star will be the 
easiest target.  Jumps from outside the system will require higher jump
numbers and/or higher skilled navigators to target smaller bodies like
gas giants and planets (and at least the star\'s well gets me `targeting\'
in the general vicinity).  The gas giants in a binary or trinary system
will be more difficult to target than those in a solitary system.  Similarly,
the planets in a system with several giants will be more difficult to target
than those in a system with only one giant.

With this premise `coordinated jumps\' are quite difficult which seems to
mesh with canonical thinking.  My fleet can probably all emerge in orbit
about a system\'s major gas giant but it will have to maneuver afterwards
to regain its formation.

Jumps to deep space are difficult because there is no gravity well to serve
as a target.  Even if I stage some sort of refueling post it will be
difficult to get close - the lack of any other significant gravity wells
in the vicinity helps but I\'m still targeting something *much* less
massive than a star, gas giant or planet.  It\'s possible but some ships
are going to emerge at a distance from the staging target that is beyond
the range of their maneuver drives/life support.  Fuel drones will get
there eventually since they don\'t have to worry about running out of
recycled air.  (I guess in this d**med New Era they\'ll run out of fuel too!)
As I build up fuel at the staging depot my gravity well will increase
making it easier to target but this will still be much more difficult than
jumping to a star system.

That\'s the rationale.  I don\'t have any specific rules to back it up.
Basically, if the ref wants them to make it they will, and if she doesn\'t,
they won\'t.  IMHO, that\'s role-playing.

The Confederation is really little more than a mutual-defense pact set up
to protect the Sword Worlds from Imperial incursions and to permit joint
`defensive\' operations against the Darrians.  Think more of NATO
than the European Union.

Sure, I do this if I value cheaper products over dependence upon Sacnoth
(or whatever world currently is on an `up\' cycle).  If I\'m as smart as the
Japanese I don\'t get caught in this trap.

There are other ways for Sacnoth to preserve its dominance.  The technology
of the US is largely available to Latin American nations.  Unfortunately,
many of these nations lack the stability, primarily political, required to
support a similar level of economic and technological achievement.  Fostering
this instability has been standard American policy for nearly a century.
One of the reasons Central Americans who can\'t own American cars don\'t build
their own factories is that the US military drops in every once and a 
while to topple the local government.  When we\'re not doing that we\'re
supplying arms to some `disgruntled duke\' who keeps the fires of instability
burning.  We are able to do this because we have the will and a significant
technological advantage.  The other Sword Worlds won\'t be able to `gang
up\' on Sacnoth for the same reason that everyone from the Rio Grande to
Tierra del Fuego hasn\'t `ganged up\' on the US.

If the King of Gram is equipping his navy with TL 12 equipment built on
Sacnoth then he\'s *not* doing what\'s best for Gram and his fief-holders
*ought* to depose him.

Well, except these other worlds don\'t keep invading the Imperium.  Clearly,
the Sword Worlds are able to coordinate their efforts well enough to fend
off not only Imperial military efforts to neutralized them but political
and economic efforts as well.  The Imperium has not been doing to the Sword
Worlds what I\'ve described for the US in Latin America and suggested for
Sacnoth within the Confederation.  If they\'ve tried, it hasn\'t worked or
the Sword Worlds wouldn\'t keep joining the Outworld Coalitions.  The Zhodani
may be a factor (although the alliance between the Zhos and the Sword
Worlds is one of convenience - there\'s little love for the Zhodani among
the Sword Worlds people) but I suspect there must be a great deal of political
and economic cooperation among the Sword Worlds to have permitted them
to remain independent.

Ooops!  Maybe I\'ve made your point.  Maybe this is why Sacnoth doesn\'t
just take over!  :-o  But then again, if relations among the Sword Worlds
are friendly then they ought to see some advantage in several high-tech
worlds with class A starports.  Maybe there is some sort of negotiated
`balance of power\': Sacnoth gets the high tech and Gram gets the shipyard?
(But don\'t the shipbuilding rules state that any world can build ships for
its own navy regardless of starport class?)

Well, first, the Confederation is nothing more than a bunch of cooperating
feudal technocracies (with some exceptions).

Second, keep in mind that, IMHO, GDW has never gotten the feudal technocracy
aspect of the Sword Worlds right.  The canonical take on this government
type has been merely a `high-tech\' aristocracy.

A feudal system is one in which ruling authority is granted to a specific
individual by others who provide support to that individual in return for
his efforts at coordinating their collective activities.  In medieval
times this was centered around common defense.  The fief-holders provided
military and economic support to the `lord\' and in return he used these
common forces to protect each of them from `barbarians\' and such.  In a
technocracy these efforts are not limited to military affairs but are
focused on the entire range of technological activities.  The `lord\' is
essentially the `chairman of the board\' of a huge conglomerate.  He
coordinates the activites of manufacturers, distributors, financiers,
retailers, etc. so that each can function in the marketplace.  It\'s something
like the Japanese kieritsu(sp?).  In the case of the Sword Worlds this
sort of thing is happening on a planetary scale.  Every technological (and
economic) interest on Sacnoth holds `fealty\' to the King.

Another good way to look at this is as a `plutocracy\'.  The economic elites
(`technocrats\' in a high-tech society) are also the political elites.  Unlike
conventional Western democracies (some might argue this point), there is
no separation between politcal power and economic power.  In the US we have
as much separation of `business and state\' as we do of `church and state\'
but in a technocracy this is not the case.  It\'s not like the `state-
controlled\' economies of the old East bloc - it\'s still a `capitalist\' system.
If your `company\' or `fief\' goes sour your political influence does as well
(because you can no longer support your `liege\').  Again, the Japanese
system - if you ignore the politcal government - is a good model.

Maybe, but again, if I\'m the King of Sacnoth my TL advantage permits me
to pretty much `smash and grab\' at will.

Now you see that in a feudal technocracy, technological power *is* political
power.

A good point.  I can\'t explain it.  As I understand it I don\'t see how any
world but the technological leader can be the dominant world.  (And Gram is
clearly mentioned as `dominating\' the Sword Worlds.)  Maybe the Zhodani
influence is a factor but it seems to me that the anti-Zhodani sentiments
in the Sword Worlds ought to work against this.  (The Contact article on
the Sword Worlds from *JTAS* mentions the anti-Zhodani sentiment.)

> Elucidate please. I\'m not trying to be snide, I actually can\'t see why that

Hope my explanation of a feudal technocracy helped.  I don\'t see any specific
reason why it should apply to inter-world relations except that since many
Sword Worlds are feudal technocracies I would expect them to take a similar
approach to inter-world affairs.  I just don\'t see a bunch of economic barons
voting and negotiating joint communiques.

> Oh, dear! You really have a gamer\'s mentality, don\'t you? (And, yes, here I
> am being snide ;-)

Yes, I admit it.  I want the Sword Worlds to be as fractious and quarrelsome
as they were in Piper\'s *Space Viking*.  You see, since `my\' Sword Worlds
have always been that way I *really* have no use for the rehashed Space
Viking-wannabees of the Reformation Coalition.

(Speaking of rehashing Piper, does anyone remember how much that Amber Zone
article about the `rogue\' Sword Worlds captain in the 800-ton mercenary
cruiser from the post-5FW war *JTAS* seemed *so* familiar to the plot of
*Space Viking*?  You know, the Sword Worlder who had (in this case) her
fiance killed just as they were to be married and so sold the family
estate to buy a ship and go hunting for the killer?)

Another good point but only because I don\'t think the Sword Worlds have

Maybe, but keep in mind the US policy in Latin America.  Sacnoth doesn\'t
*need* to dominate militarily in order to dominate.  Especially if the
economies are as integrated as you\'ve described then the feudal technocracy
extends *across* the subsector and there ought to arise someone at the
top and that someone ought to be the highest tech world.

Well, it seems to explain the way the Sword Worlds have been portrayed better
than how I *think* they *ought* to be portrayed.  :-)  I guess I need to
understand what causes these cycles - why doesn\'t this occur in the Imperium?

I\'m sitting on the fence here.  I guess I\'m struggling with those differences
in the Sword Worlds that were introduced either to keep them `different\' 
from Piper\'s novel or just because whomever `created\' them wasn\'t really as
much of a Sword Worlds fanatic as I am.  In either case, I just don\'t 
think the differing TLs and lack of several starports in the Sword Worlds
makes sense and I\'d like to `fix\' in in TNE.

Thanks, Hans, for the chance to work through this.  I hope it continues.

Yes, this is a must!  I would only suggest that an initial `jump drone\' is
dispatched as soon as the in-system forces are engaged by a hostile force -
just in case things go poorly you wouldn\'t want the drone not to be
dispatched at all.  Better to have the folks at the next base prematurely
worried than surprised.

This is a great rationale for the improvement of starports in the Sword
Worlds.  I can just see the Deneb Information Service (DIS) news brief
now:  "Oberlindes Lines Announces Shipbuilding Contract with Gorram
Yards on Gram/Sword Worlds".

Excellent idea.  Some variations would be to introduce the "Circuit Judge"
like "Judge Roy Bean" (sp?) or even Judge Dread (without the weapons).

I\'ve always wondered how they would take a case to a higher "off-world" court.

You also could have an inter-system bodyguard operation for important
personages like: the visiting diplomat, professor, surgeon, or scientist.

How about introducing the players to some important personage and have
one of them call hime "recalcitrant" and have the locals misinterpret it
as "thick head".  Don\'t laugh, our Prime Minister did it to the Indonesian
Leader.  Substitute whatever words you like but make it a grave insult
and have them carted off for flogging or something equally violent.

scout for the Scout Service.

Shiela-X is a tall distinctive-looking, woman.  Her figure is thin, but the
way she dresses reveals her sex without question.  She works out
semi-constantly (high End., Str), and often wears tight spandex outfits
(one of her favorites is transparent) especially in battle, which she lives for.
She is also often seen in leather hip-length boots.

She is almost never seen without her Cigar, a huge Freudian thing which she

Remember, just about everything about Shiela-X, her anti-social behavior,
her tastes, her auto-eroticism (she\'s very sexually self-centered) is due to
her designers desire to create a tool for deep space exploration.  She was 
intended to be put alone of a type S for months or years at a time and sent out
into the unexplored vastness.  It was found that regular humans required 
companionship too badly, and computers/robots did not have the required
independence of thought to survive or make the missilns successful.

Her training as a pilot began at a very early age (to the detriment of other
subjects like History, Literature, etc) along with training in electronics,
computers, navigation, engineering, a smattering of weapons skills and tactics
intending to give her survival skills for almost any situation.

Her education therefore is excellent in areas like metallurgy, botany, biology
(not sufficient for skill levels, just a good general knowledge), but terrible
for history, literature, philosophy, or psychology.  Judgements should be made 
regarding which level is used for a given roll.

Shiela escaped her keepers at the age of 16, and after stealing a small ship
made it appear as if she crashed it (actually making a controlled crash from
secondary controls in the engine room) which destroyed the entire front section
of the craft.  This was in the Mertractor system on a planet with a large 
underground society.  She disappeared into this realm for awhile (learning her 
streetwise skills here), making friends and contacts.

The Imps eventually figured out she was still alive (she blew up an arboretum)
and began pursuing her in earnest.  Note that in my campign world there is a
serious aversion to cloning or creating persons artificially.

At the time of our adventures She was about 32 years old.  She paired up with 
the rebellious (and Psionic) Son of the Duchess of Mertractor, Quentin Xavier
Bim III, but he is another story.


Personal note;

Typically my players and I would play Traveller (the original) in a classroom
where we went to college (Clark University, Worcester MA).  We never knew which
 of several classrooms would be available, so we would write on the blackboards
in the lobby of the building, "Shiela-X where are you?" in big letters, and 
the room number in small ones at the bottom.

Years later, people were still seeing "Shiela-X where are you" on those black-
boards on occasion.  The game long since ended.

I think that instead it\'s calculations based on charted positions,
etc.  While your idea is interesting, how do you locate the
targets?  Also, this seems to be against the 100 diameter idea: you
want to be far away from gravity wells, not close to them.  

I think that you target your ship towards a coordinate in space,
not towards a gravity well...

If I were a player in your campaign, I would want to know how my ship
is targeting gravity wells parsecs away: that would indicate alot of 
interesting possiblities ;-)

Erm.  The old, old _High Guard_ rules said that was an option for planetary
navies.  I guess to allow tech-8 E-starport worlds to have rockets (and
hence explain Earth.)  It probably isn\'t exactly true now.  There\'s an
interesting discussion of shipbuilding in the RC in _Path Of Tears_ about
B-port worlds building starships with drives imported from A-port worlds.
The "One Small Step" articles in _Challenge_ also allowed some minor
shipbuilding on low port worlds, but I forget the details.  (Of course,
in old _High Guard_, you couldn\'t build tech-8 ships....)

I\'m not sure about the current TNE ruling.

If you don\'t like the TNE computer virus, why not just replace it with a 
\'green\' virus, i.e. one that kills off plants or living creatures. Give it a 
long enough incubation period and assume it can be carried as spores or 
bacteria or something in starship air or on crew boots or in crew people, 
etc. and make it attack livestock or food crops (or even people) and you 
have quite enough reason for complete collapse of planets plus paranoia 
about infection from outside (i.e. the Regency \'blockade\'; or is it the 
Coalition - I don\'t have TNE).

It might be more believable that after a few years someone would come up 
with a means of neutralising this (innoculation?) than the strange lengths 
required to fight a computer virus. It also explains the spread of the virus 
more easily and doesn\'t require suspension of belief with regard to the 
(computer) virus\' infection methods.

Anyone working in germ warfare care to elaborate? :)

Remember, too, that RQS patrols *all* borders, even the Zhodani and
spinward ones.  Not as heavily, but it\'s a safety measure in case
someone screws up their part of the border.  Also don\'t forget that
the Zhodani/Vargr are patrolling an area to coreward that may not
be clearly marked on the current map.  (People who have _Survival
Margin_ and TNE know about the variability of maps, i.e. the Black
"Sphere".)  The Aslan are a first line of defense for the jump-5
Riftspan route to the old Hierate, as seen from the Regency.

Judging by the text, sadly minimal.  The Exploration Office is
apparently shut down.  Contact & Liaison and Survey are apparently
restricted to operations inside the Regency...updating old 
cartography and maintaining internal mutual understanding among
the various sophont species of the area.  I miss the IISS.

I suppose that it is possible the RISS is quietly trying to maintain
the old IISS Group offices out in Theta Borealis and Sigma Zephyrus,
though.  The old sector staff was pretty committed, and they may yet
have *some* small discretionary funds.  It\'d be a shoestring operation,
though.  There might also be some long-range Imperial base ships like
the Solomani ones that have not yet returned from multi-decade missions
to spinward, or even gone back out -- they have to be fairly self-
sufficient.

I am announcing my plans to create a second Traveller Mailing List.

TNE, for good or ill, has caused a deep division in Traveller gamers. A
large number of very productive TMLers have dropped off the list as the
TNE material (most specifically, the TNE setting) have made TML no
longer interesting to them.

These people feel they no longer have a forum where they can discuss
Traveller topics of interest to them. We\'ve lost a lot of creative and
interesting people. This represents a loss of valuable talent to the
game and a loss to the TML community.

This is a behavior similar to when people unsubscribe from a newsgroup
when the "signal-to-noise ratio" grows too small. When this happens,
often an enterprising individual suggests that the newsgroup be enhanced
by division into different topical areas.

So, I am announcing my intention (again, for good or ill) to create a
topical sublist disjoint from (but related to) TML. This list will exist
to discuss the Imperium in the Classic and Rebellion period. It will
focus on the black book and MegaTraveller environment. It will not be a
totally TNE-free zone. Depending on initial response, application of TNE
rules to the Classic and Rebellion settings may be tolerated.

I have not yet decided on a name for this sublist. Nor am I taking
subscriptions for it at this time. The TML, however, will be the first
to know when the mechanisms are ready.

Please spread the word. Let disaffected former TML subscribers know that
this is in the works.

Perhaps it is no longer true, but it used to be that you GAINED
cargo space by doing a number of smaller jumps (the fuel usage
can be recalculated based on a smaller ship\'s mass--if you base
fuel usage solely on hull size, use inflatable or drop tanks).
In addition, you saved space by using a smaller jump drive.

Without TNE, I am at a disadvantage.  It occurs to me that a
large fleet action would not be necessary, though.  Why not
penetrate to the center of the Regency where they are not so
vigilant and "infect" them from the inside out?

This is a reasonable argument, although I believe that most
merchants will not have large jump drives.  They are far too
expensive, and less of your ship is dedicated to cargo.  They
will likely restrict their trade to nearer stars, except in
special cases, which would justify either the extra expense
or the extra time.

Again, things may have changed, but it used to be that a
large jump drive (and equipment to support it) overwhelmed
the cost of a ship, to the point where it was generally not
profitable to use one in a trader.

I think we are all in agreement.  The background states that jumps
to deep space are possible, but indirectly implies that they must
not be easy.  We already know gravity affects jumps, why not use it
as a \'target\' as David Johnson suggests (perhaps even a mandatory
one)?  This is consistent with the Arrival Vengeance using a comet
(it has it\'s own gravity well, even though it is small).  Perhaps
sufficiently dense "dark matter" could even be used, but precisely
locating it might be difficult.

And the next thing you know Sacnoth is being visited by the combined fleets
of the rest of the Sword Worlds who are anxious to ensure that you won\'t
visit their world next.

Yes, that was my own impression. Though perhaps it is a little more. The
original Sword Worlders were refugees from a lost war. Perhaps this gave
them an Us-and-Them mentality that prevails to this day. You can fight
between yourselves, but only if you don\'t cripple the other guy so much
he can\'t help against \'Them\'.

Which may be why Sachnoth is due for their own downturn on the cycle in the

Think about this for a moment. Sacnoth is not the US in that analogy, they 
are another one of the Latin nations.

Ah! There\'s another point. _Significant_ is a significant word here (;-).
How significant is an advantage of 12 over 11 and 10? The only figures I
have are some from Steve Higginbotham that are based on his extensive
experience with Trillion Credit Squadron campaigns. So they apply to
Classic Traveller. Quite possibly (almost certainly) things are different 
under Megatraveller and New Era rules, but how different and in what 
direction is difficult to say, so I will stick to Steve\'s until someone
comes up with better ones. According to him, and assuming competent ship
designs, a TL 12 fleet is twice as efficient, ton for ton, as a TL 11 and
six times as efficient as TL 10. Not an impossible imbalance to overcome
when you\'re 20 to one (I don\'t have the Sword World population figures
here. What is the population of Sacnoth compared to the rest of the
Confederation? It\'s no use being twice as good as the other fellow if 
there\'s 10 of him.)   -  even if the other worlds don\'t buy TL 12 ships
elsewhere.

Depends on what he buys. Some things (like computers) would be risky, other
things could be checked against sabotage. But perhaps he buys them from the
Imperium instead. After all, they are propably playing the US to the Sword
Worlds\' Latin America.

>Clearly,

I don\'t see how that follows at all. The only times the Sword Worlds
invade the Imperium is with promise of Zhodani help. You can\'t make
many assumptions based on how people behave when they think they have
a powerful ally.

>The Imperium has not been doing to the Sword

Based on the constant instability of the Sword Worlds it seems to me that
that may be precisely what the Imperium has been doing.

If they\'ve tried, it hasn\'t worked or
>the Sword Worlds wouldn\'t keep joining the Outworld Coalitions. 

On the contrary, if the Imperium has been doing that it explains why the
Sword Worlds are PO\'d enough to keep on joining an alliance that has struck 
out again and again.

I\'ve no doubt they are a major factor.

As mentioned above I disagree. I\'m also not at all sure that he would want

As I\'ve replied, technological power _enhances_ other kinds of power. A 2/1

Well, I still believe that your understanding is mistaken. A population 1 
million world with TL 12 is weaker than a population 10 million world with 
TL 11. Or 10 population 1 million worlds with TL 11. Not to mention the
central point in my theory of Sword World economic-technological cycles:
The TL 11 worlds had TL 12 themselves not so long ago and still retain

Well, maybe you should try. It might help ;-). No, waitaminute. It\'s not
economic barons, it\'s economic kings. There\'s a differenceC

I really think you should try to make up an explanation that fits the known
facts rather than to make up an explanation and change the facts to fit them.
(But I know just how you feel. I have the same attitude to the conduct of
the Aslan and Vargr in the Rebellion. The only way they could have the
succes they are described as having is if the whole Deneb Domain is run
by imbeciles or traitors. There\'s no way they could be the threat thay are
portrayed as unless their military opponents are hopeless incompetents. So
perhaps my disagreement with you is just that I _can_ see a way for the
Sword Worlds to work the way they are described while you can\'t.)

There\'s no answer to this argument (I know, I\'ve used it myself ;-). All
I can say is: Try sitting down one day and start all over by listing known 
facts about the Sword Worlds, discarding all your own interpretations for 
a while, and then try to make sense of them  -  just as an interlectual
excercise. Perhaps you\'ll come up with something useful.

Think about the kingdoms of medieval Europe. There were some mixing of
feudal duties between kings (especially between England and France). But
eventually the individual countries prevailed over the feudal structure.
There\'s no reason why a king should welcome a feudal pattern just because
their own power is based on it. And, in fact, we KNOW they don\'t. If they
did the Sword Worlds would be an empire instead of a confederation.

Depending on your POV, it might be more applicable to equate the Mromons
with TNE people, making the TNE rules the Book of Mormon. Or better yet,
make TNE part of the Walkdenbooks New Age religions, perhaps with TNE being
the "Newly Revised PC Bible".

No offense meant to any of those groups, of course. Besides, I don\'t play
*any* form of Traveller; I just hang out here for the sci-fi. ;)

Many alien races supposedly travel abroad.  When the virus
struck, many of these travellers were stuck in the Regency far
away from their home worlds.
 
The Newts travelled around a lot, so there are probably a few of
them.  Any clues as to other species stuck in the Regency?

Believe me, they make enormous military sense!  Deep space stations 
(particularly mine) altered the entire strategic picture of the 
Islands War in Steve\'s TCS game.  The use of deep space stations would
have changed the entire course of the Fifth Frontier War, if the Zhos 
or the Imperials had used them...

Deep space stations are nearly impossible for the enemy to find *by
chance* (unlike solar systems); since they can be placed anywhere, 
there is NO border anymore, and no chance of predicting where the 
attack is coming from, and NO chance of intercepting the enemy fleet 
before it is in your system.  The war changes to one of fortifying and
defending bodies of strategic interest, like home worlds and major 
colonies.  In such an environment, habitable gas giant moons are a 
pearl beyond price, because the 100-diameter radius of a gas giant is 
well outside the orbits of the moons, giving the defender halfway 
decent warning of an enemy fleet on his doorstep... Otherwise, your 
planet better have massive orbital fortifications and/or planetary 
defenses, or it is a sitting duck for the first fleet to pop out of 
jump-space at the 100-diameter limit.  Your fleet will have no chance 
to defend against that attack before the enemy fleet is close enough 
to your world to bombard it or launch a ground assault.

The above comments about habitable gas giant moons also apply to 
hostile inner-zone worlds that are inside the 100-diameter jump limit 
of a star... They are also defensible with a fleet.  Perhaps strategic
considerations merited the colonization of some of those 
"overpopulated hellholes"?

I\'ve rationalized the use of deep space stations in the Islands, and 
lack of their use by the Imperium by deciding that it is a very 
difficult navigational task to jump to and from deep space points. 
The Island nations had a good supply of such skilled navigators 
because the Island worlds are so scattered that merchant ships and 
many military vessels *must* use multiple deep-space jumps to get 
anywhere.  Most of the Imperial worlds are close enough together that 
Imperial ships can jump from world to world, and thus the necessary 
skill to be a ship\'s navigator isn\'t as high, and deep-space jumping 
is not a standard part of basic Imperial navigator training.  I 
also venture to add that Impy merchants consider deep-space jumping
as risky a practice as burning unrefined fuel in your jump drive, and 
discourage it.  So do their insurers.  Someone else can explain why 
the Imperial Navy and Zho Navy don\'t do it very often...

The effects would be too different.  First, viruses tend to be *very*
species specific.  It would be likely the outside alien governments
would get missed.  Second, if it destroyed the ecosystems of planets,
the Imperial core would be essentially rendered uninhabitable, especially
if the "virus" was persistent in nature.  Third, unlike the computer
virus, direct physical contact would be required to spread the virus.
Fourth, the rate of spread would either be slow enough to save outliers
(like, say, the Solomani Confederation), or unnoticable enough to 
sneak into Deneb undectected.  

It might be possible to work up a plausible scenario of some sort, but
it would be substantially different in form than the TNE scenario.

Out of curiousity, how many of you are interested in Sky Galleons of Mars,
that is, you play (or would if you had more opponents, scenarios etc.)?

For those who don\'t remember, SGoM is the game of sky vessel combat that is
somewhat cut down and included in Space:1889.

A second question for those who are interested, would you be interested in 
playing in a campaign game of the English & Regency fleet vs the Oenotrians
(plus perhaps High Martian & pirate problems)?

Roughly, what I have in mind is for various Admirals and squadron leaders
to have to carry out a variety of missions (patrols, support the ground troops,
try to disrupt enemy supplies, put down pirates, or direct assault on enemy
fleets) on a campaign level.  Where opposing forces arrive in the same place
at the same time, a battle is fought using SGoM.  

If there is interest shown, I\'ll expand on these ideas a bit.

HISTORY OF THE IMPERIUM WORKING GROUP
- --Clay Bush, 30-April-1994

This a general post for all Traveller afficionados out there. It\'s an
insider\'s view of a Traveller fan organization.
- ----

What is HIWG?
============= 
HIWG is a multi-national organization of Traveller fans. That\'s as specific a
definition as I\'ve come up with.
 
It started in 1987 when MegaTraveller came out, and was to develop Imperial
history. It did a lot of this, and many ideas went into Rebellion Sourcebook
and other products. It outgrew this focus, though, as people exchanged
programs, wrote up sectors, and developed races.

A good portion of MEMBERS\' work has seen print. HIWG itself has several
newsletters (AAB Proceedings is the general newsletter, STARBURST is the
Australia-New Zealand newsletter, and WHITE NOISE is the current United
Kingdom newsletter), but it does not and will not publish any supplements
itself. No collection of 100+ scattered people can imitate a company
successfully.
 
Instead, there is a list of people who joined HIWG, wrote some documents, and
developed their ideas enough that GDW (or others) chose to publish them.
 
We see our function as a meeting place for fans, and we expect good things to
happen from people interacting. It\'s hard to predict what will develop in
advance, as we\'ve discovered.

The discussion has been muted as everyone waited to see TNE when it came out.
It is picking up steam, however, now that all the core pieces of TNE are out.

LAND GRANTS 
To encourage ownership and friendly competition, we allocated sectors and
areas to "analysts." Some of this material has seen print as library data,
some published sectors have had their worlds named by HIWgers, and others are
very sketchy. HIWG got credits, but Fugate did end MTJ4 with a note that HIWG
material was too much "why" and not enough start-adventure-here. 

Nevertheless, much of HIWG\'s material is about detailing sectors and their
inhabitants. GDW selected specific a HIWG member to collapse the rest of Old
Expanses, and other "collapse the sector" projects are underway. The results
will be in the HIWG library, along with the collected official sector UWP
files.

To prevent overloading one person, HIWG divided the Imperial universe into
four "quadrants." The four met at Reference/Core. With the Virus leveling
Imperial space, HIWG may develop some new organization to better fit the new
realities. It\'s being kicked around by members. 

OTHER PROJECTS
There were also a number of equipment and ship designs that HIWGers
exchanged.
Witha new system (Fire, Fusion, and Steel) to absorb, this has died down. It
will pick up after members finish revising their worksheets and programs. We
are looking at starting a design special interest group to handle exchanging
this information.

(Bryan Borich\'s "Starships, Starports, and Vehicles" distributed MT craft
designs. People contributed their own, and Bryan verified, compiled, and
distributed them. Bryan\'s been busy with work in that "real world" where we
get paychecks, and FF&S is still new, but I expect a restart before the 1994
is out.)
 
There is also some interest in a Classic Traveller working group and an
Alternate Technologies working group. Neither is yet a working entity, but
HIWG\'s results have always depended on what members decided to put in.

HIWG LIBRARY 
Most work is exchanged in numbered documents. (The numbering system is being
revised to separate New Era from Rebellion era work.) The library also
contains a few programs, sector UWP files, and other collected data.

HIWG documents are available on disk or as hardcopy. I think most people
reading this post will prefer the disk versions. If I pulled together all the
documents and files that have been done, I would fill eight 1.44MB disks.

(If a HIWGer writes an adventure, it goes off to someone as a submission. And
quite a few get published. The adventures just aren\'t in the HIWG library.)

MEMBERSHIP
Membership gets you copies of AAB Proceedings, a membership directory, and a
list of documents. Programs we exchange between people who have the same
machines (Mac, IBM, Atari), and interest groups with their own newsletter
form
around interesting areas.

Membership is available at US$2.00 per issue of AABP from the membership
secretary. Usual membership payment is US$12. Send to:

Thanks to the efforts of PBJuzyk, Steve Bonneville and others we\'ve made
some great additions to the TML Regency Sourcebook.  Here\'s the latest
draft.  There are still many areas in need of development so please jump
in wherever your interest is piqued.

*SHALL NOT PERISH* - A TML Regency Sourcebook

(Reference TML Msg 586/7338 22-Apr-1994)

REGENCY TIMELINE

Anyone care to add a general history borken out by decades from the Rebellion
to TNE?

1121-1130
  312-1130 Quarantine established
1131-1140
1141-1150
1151-1160
1161-1170
1171-1180
1181-1190
1191-1200

Significant dates are still needed for the following:
 Declaration of the Regency
 The `Rape of Trin\' (Gram?)
 Death of Norris(?)
 Openings to the Zhodani(?)
 Others?

THE QUARANTINE LINE

>From PBJuzyk <psualum@aol.com>:

When Norris established the Quarantine (312-1130) the Patrol was
combined with part of the Regency Interstellar Scout Service
(Exploration and External Mapping branches) to form the Regency
Quarantine Service (RQS).  Communications (xboat & courier service) and
Internal Mapping functions remained unchanged (within the borders of the
Regency).  The RQS soon became a separate service.

The Quarantine border was extended to more defensible positions and is
several parsecs deep to prevent high jump performance ships from leaping
over the blockade.  By 1201 this border ran through the following
subsectors:

        Deneb:          B - G - K - O
        Reft:                   C - B - F - E - I
        Trojan Reach:   L - P - O
        Riftspan Reaches:       C - G - F - E

The Scout/Courier ships now available to the RQS were modified to create
Quarantine Cutters quickly followed by the addition of 70-ton Inspection
Launches.  The RQS still wasn\'t able to maintain a virus-proof seal
along the entire border which resulted in the creation of the RQS
Auxiliary comprised of private citizens assisting the patrol of the
border.  Later 150-ton Quarantine Cutters (stretched versions of the
Scout) entered into use by the RQS.

SUBSECTOR MAPS AND UWP DATA

I would suggest a typical subsector on each of the Regency frontiers: the
Zhodani frontier (Jewell), the Vargr frontier (Regina, Aramis, or Pretoria),
the Virus frontier (Lamas, Dunmag or Usani) and the Aslan *ihatei* frontier
(Tobia, Gazulin, Pax Rulin or Glisten).  The capital subsector, Mora, would
be representative of the Regency \'core\'.  Maybe a subsector in the Deneb Wilds?

Let\'s follow the *Path of Tears* format with Imperial Era (IE) and Post-
Imperial Era (PIE) UWP stats.

MAJOR WORLDS OF THE REGENCY

Major worlds ought to be Mora/Mora, Deneb/Usani, Gazulin/Gazulin,
Regina/Regina, Rhylanor/Rhylanor, Glisten/Glisten, Lintl/Vestus,
Pretoria/Pretoria, Magash/Sabine, Vincennes/Vincennes and Lunion/Lunion.

Any other candidates?

REGENCY GOVERNMENT

Using the *World Builders\' Handbook* model, executive authority is obviously
held by a `ruler\' - the Regent.  What about legislative authority?  Under
the Imperium this was also held by the `ruler\' - the Emperor.  The suggestions
of greater `democracy\' in the Regency might be apparent here.  In a mulit-
body legislature (Moot?) the aristocracy would certainly still have a voice
so let\'s call the upper house the `Chamber of Nobles\'.  A second body might
be the `Chamber of Delegates\' that is composed of representatives from
individual worlds (probably with representation weighted by population - one
doubts Pop 1 worlds will have the same say as Pop A worlds, especially since
the Chamber of Nobles will already reflect this bias).  Might there be a
third (or fourth?) house?  Generally, legislative authority in the Regency
would be classed as `several councils\' in *WBH* terms.

While primary authority will be executive (the Regent), secondary judicial
authority might also exist to complement the secondary legislative authority.
Again, under the Imperial system judicial authority was held by the single
ruler and `delegated\' down through the aristocracy.  My sense is that the
Regents will still maintain judicial authority similar to the Imperial model.

Therefore, in *WBH* lingo the Regency has a primary executive/judicial ruler
with several secondary legislative councils.

*POT* apparently has a table of all RC worlds, their populations, political
bloc and number of representatives.  Anyone care to post a list of Regency
worlds with populations (maybe Roger\'s hypertext can help here?) and we can
work on representatives from there?

REGENCY POLITICS

The Nobility:

Archduke of Deneb and Regent: Norris? Seldrian? Avery?
Duchess of Mora: Elane Shankarr Muudashir at Mora
 -Leader of the Aristocratic bloc, possibly
Duke/Duchess of Deneb: Aleksandr Lagaashinga or his heir at Deneb
 -Leader of the Imperialist bloc?
Duke/Duchess of Gazulin: Sharik Arcadia or her heir at Gazulin
 -The most prrominent new Democrat?
Duke/Duchess of Regina: Seldrian Aledon or her heir at Regina
Duke/Duchess of Glisten: at Glisten
Duke/Duchess of Rhylanor: at Rhylanor
 -Possibly a leader of the Santanocheevists?
Duke/Duchess of Vestus: at Lintl
Duke/Duchess of Pretoria: at Pretoria
Duke/Duchess of Sabine: at Magash
Duke/Duchess of Vincennes: at Vincennes?
 -Where does Count Audine Garhik, Marquis Vincennes (Norris\'s nephew)
  fit in here?  If Count Audine is Marquis of Vincennes but not Duke
  then where is the Duke\'s seat?  Why isn\'t it Vincennes if the subsector
  capital is there?
Duke/Duchess of Lunion: at Lunion
Duke/Duchess of Trin\'s Veil: no longer at Trin!
 -Possibly a leader of the Isolationist bloc
Duke/Duchess of Vilis: at Frenzie
 -Prominent in the Santanocheevist bloc?
Duke/Duchess of Lanth: at Lanth
Duke/Duchess of Lamas: at Lamas? (Quarantine Line)
 -Prominent in the Expansionist bloc

 -Prominent in the Expansionist bloc
Duke/Duchess of Geniishir: at Geniishir? (Quarantine Line)
 -Prominent in the Expansionist bloc
Duke/Duchess of Gulf: at Qevar
Duke/Duchess of Zeng: at Zeng

Other dukes/duchesses-in-exile who will be prominent in the House of
Nobles and the Aristocratic and Imperialist blocs:

Duke/Duchess of Antra/Deneb
Duke/Duchess of Million/Deneb
Duke/Duchess of Atsah/Deneb? (overrun by Vargr during the Rebellion)
Duke/Duchess of Tobia/Trojan Reach: heir of Duke Alexander

These political blocs have been suggested:

Isolationists want to maintain the Quarantine.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Trin\'s Veil?
Expansionists want to move out into the Wilds.
 -Enjoys Instellarms backing.
Democrats seek to expand `democratic\' values.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Gazulin?
Aristocrats want to maintain the noble aristocracy.
 -Led by Duchess Elane of Mora
 -Possibly known as Muudashirists?
 -Enjoy much support among the House of Nobles
Tolerants favor a relaxation of psi prejudices.
 -Discretely supported by SuSAG.
Santanocheevists oppose any moves toward accommodation with the Zhodani.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Rhylanor?
 -Enjoys Instellarms backing.
Imperialists still hope to one day resurrect the Old Imperium.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Deneb?
 -Enjoys support from Tukera Lines.
Autnomists favor independence and a complete break from the Imperial past.

What is the nature of the Regency government?  Someone mentioned that Avery
from *AV* serves as a cabinet minister(?) to Seldrian (the Regent) which
suggests some sort of ministerial portfolios (cabinet posts for Americans).
What is the nature of the relationship between the Regency Moot and the 
Regent?  Does the Moot have any `real\' power?  What about the relationship
between the Chambers of the Moot?  How are members of the Chamber of
Delegates chosen?  Is this decided by each individual world or are there
`common\' standards throughout the Regency?  If there is some sort of voting,
who gets to vote?  Everyone?  Adults only?  Literate adults?  Propertied
adults?  How long after I move from Junidy to Strouden can I vote there?

Remember that even a system where *only* the Chamber of Nobles has some sort
of `limited\' veto power over the Regent is one that is more `democratic\' than
was the Old Imperium.

REGENCY LANGUAGE

Anyone care to offer a few examples of Riftian jargon after 70 years of
divergence from Galanglic?

QUARANTINE SERVICE AND REGENCY PATROL

>From PBJuzyk <psualum@aol.com>:

Regency Quarantine Service

When Norris established the Quarantine (312-1130) the Patrol was
combined with part of the Regency Interstellar Scout Service
(Exploration and External Mapping branches) to form the Regency
Quarantine Service (RQS).  Communications (xboat & courier service) and
Internal Mapping functions remained unchanged (within the borders of the
Regency).  The RQS soon became a separate service.

The Scout/Courier ships now available to the RQS were modified to create
Quarantine Cutters quickly followed by the addition of 70-ton Inspection
Launches.  The RQS still wasn\'t able to maintain a virus-proof seal
along the entire border which resulted in the creation of the RQS
Auxiliary comprised of private citizens assisting the patrol of the
border.  Later 150-ton Quarantine Cutters (stretched versions of the
Scout) entered into use by the RQS.

The above data on the RQS is pieced together from Survival Margin and
T:TNE manual.  The following is my conjectures on tactics of the RQS as
well as some additional necessary assets.  For each system that contains
gas giant(s) and/or a world with water present the RQS will need to base
assets able to defend those sites and send messages to other systems in
the Zone.  This would include manned bases in position around such
planets and small fighter craft in addition to the ships normally in use
by the RQS.

When a ship arrives at a system within the Zone and is detected by RQS
sensors they will be hailed.  If they respond they will be instructed to
rendezvous with either a Quarantine Cutter or an Inspection Launch
depending on the size of the ship.  If any problems arise when
communication is attempted the RQS will dispatch armed craft (either
Cutters or fighters who tend to shoot first and ask questions later.
Fighters would be designed with high manuever capabilities and would be
based at all refueling sources.

They would not be launched until a suspect ship is fairly close.  This
provides multiple benefits: the fighters have ample fuel, the incoming
ships are low on fuel, the bases are close-by so are able to provide
heavy fire support (Particle Accelerators and Meson Guns).  Another
option would be to replace some or all of the fighters with remotely
piloted vehicles operated from the base.

Finally should incoming hostile forces overcome an RQS base there must
be some means for notifying other nearby systems.  This is accomplished
by maintaining a small unmanned station outside of the 100 diameter zone
which contains jump torpedoes.  When RQS forces are nearly overwhelmed a
signal is sent to the station which then launches all of its torpedoes.
Each torpedo is preset to enter jumpspace at the proper time.  One
torpedo is sent to each nearby system.  As part of the notification
signal additional data can be transmitted and sent with the torpedo such
as compostion of enemy forces.  When the torpedo arrives at its
destination it begins broadcasting its message to RQS bases.  This
system is a response to the Rape of Trin and currently only 1 in 3
systems are equiped with these stations.

REGENCY NAVY AND ARMY

This would seem to follow pretty much the Imperial model although there
looks like there might be a good debate taking off on this issue now.

QUARANTINE AREA OF OPERATIONS

>       Trojan Reach:   L - P - O
>       Riftspan Reaches:       C - G - F - E

So the Quarantine Line runs through Lamas/Deneb, Dunmag/Deneb, Usani/Usani,
Kamlar/Deneb, C/Reft, Macon/Reft, F/Reft, Usher/Reft, L/Trojan Reach,
P/Trojan Reach, O/Trojan Reach and the subsectors in the Riftspan Reaches.
Who maintains the Line in these *ihatei*-occupied subsectors in Trojan
Reach and the Riftspan Reaches?

What\'s the mission of the Quarantine Service?  Can anyone produce a map
of the entire Quarantine Line?  Are there any places were the Quarantine Line
has recently been expanded?  To follow the *POT* template we ought to provide
maps and UWP data for such worlds.

REGENCY MEGACORPS

Delgado Trading (miniturization, heavy mining & refining, publishing and
   trading)
- -A key player in the war against the Virus.

General Products (starships, non-starships, heavy machinery)
- -Quality problems were threatening existence by Rebellion.  Domain/Regency
 susbsidies would be likely in order to maintain a major shipbuilder (cf.
 the Chrysler bailout).

GSbAG (starships)
- -Probably doing well equipping the Quarantine Service and the Deneb Navy.

Hortalez et Cie (banking and investment)
- -With addition of Zirunkariish assets most likely dominates Domain.

Instellarms (military products)
- -Probably doing well, although mercenary actions can be expected to be
 limited in Deneb by government efforts to conserve resources.  Can be
 expected to favor the Expansionists and Santanocheevists.

Ling Standard Products (mining, electronics and computers, starships,
   starship systems, power generation, small arms)
- -Probably the primary commercial and military contractor combating the Virus.

SuSAG (chemicals, pharmaceuticals, geneering, extra-Imperial psi drugs)
- -Will the illegal psi drug manufacturing move into the Regency?  Obviously,
 SuSAG will support the Tolerant bloc, if not openly then certainly with
 financial backing.

Sternmetal Horizons (mining, manufacturing, power generation, food processors)
- -Probably doing well.

Tukera Lines (shipping)
- -Probably still active and possibly a supporter of the Imperialist bloc.

Vilani Bureaux (probably not active in Deneb after the Collapse):
  Makhidkarun
  Sharurshid
  Naasirka (assets acquired by LSP?)
  Zirunkariish (assets acquired by Hortalez)

Okay, I\'ve got some sort of `jump space gravity well detector\' - maybe
it\'s a `Johnsonometer\'?  :-)  It doesn\'t matter that those `gravity waves\'
from that star in the next system are 3.26 years old because the relative
motion between here and there in the past 3.26 years isn\'t significant.
(Didn\'t the *World Builders\' Handbook* say I could `scan\' systems at
interstellar distances?)  This also makes Navigation skill useful (since
even my Model 1/bis can just input coordinates into the nav\'puter).

Actually, no.  I want to get close (that\'s the whole idea, right) but I
can\'t get *too* close or my jump drive goes wacko.

If this is how it works, how do I explore new territory?  Just jump out
there and hope there\'s a system?  I supposed I can take astronomical
measurements for coordinates, but isn\'t that just `photonic\' targeting?

Remember when I suggested a new Regency-specific mailing list?
Well, I\'m sure glad it DIDN\'T come about.

As for seperate areas for TNE and pre-TNE Traveller, well...

The Pros:
- ----
You might placate some of the people who ditched due to TNE, and some of 
them might come back to participate.

The Cons:
- ----
More administrative work for James -- keeping two lists, etc.
Possible reduction of the critical mass that has been achieved on TML.
Creates a little more hassle for those who like partaking in discussions
and swapping in all eras.
You can already discuss anything relating to Traveller on the TML, from any
era -- to diminish its subject matter for the aesthetic concerns of a 
handful seems ludicrous.

The participation level of those who ditched wasn\'t that high anyways.
If TML is not regulated/restricted from CT/MT posts, TML\'ers will go
right on posting such, to the loss of those who subscribe to the subject-
limited list exclusively.

- ----

Seems like a rather lopsided issue to me.

I prefer the general Traveller theme.  It\'s much simpler -- you read the
messages you want to read.  You keep the messages you want to keep.

Plus, I love bigger crowds -- 500 is a pretty big crowd!

Okay, okay, so I\'m a little *too* eager.  I\'ve two questions though.
Where do non-CT/MT, non-TNE Traveller discussion (like the Earth Colonies)
end up? And secondly, when do we get a Pre-MT/Rebellion mailing list?  :-)

This might be a good idea.  James, how difficult would it be to develop
a mechanism that would `reject\' messages that didn\'t conform to this format
like you already have for messages with 80+ characters per line?

To illuminate why merchants would find deep space jumping dangerous,
consider this.  When you jump into a deep-space hex, you have no 
"landmarks" to orient by -- normally, in a stellar system, you have a 
nearby star and some planets to fix your location, but for a deep space
station, you are dependent on an accurate jump and the station\'s 
radio beacon/radar reflector.  On _Brilliant Lances_ scale, a ship
jumping 100 diameters from a size-8 world is a bit over 40 hexes away
from target.  Finding a lone station at even that close a range could 
be tricky.  And if the station isn\'t where you think it is or your 
calculations are substantially off, you and your ship may be waiting a
long time to be found.

My guess as to why the IN and ZN don\'t seem to use deep space refueling
much is two-fold.  First, it may be tricky to maintain fuel levels in
the cache without tying up too many fleet tankers, especially if it
is in a forward area.  Cynthia, what\'s your experience with this?  It
may also be that we just don\'t hear much about them -- our usual source
of info is the TNS, and such bases would usually be secret installations.

I think that such stations have been used -- my interpretation of the
4FW "Battle of Two Suns" which was "midway between Yres and Menorb"
as depicted in the CT adventure _The Kinunir_ sounds a lot like a 
fight over a fueling and resupply base in deep space.  It would explain
why the fates of Efate, Yres, and Menorb hung in the balance over the
outcome, and why afterward the Zhodani supply lines were too long.
It would also explain why the battlefield may still have ships from which
parts could be salvaged.

The following library data first appeared in *Melbourne Times* #1:

CREATE: An acronym for Cultural Revelation, Appreciation, Tolerance and
Education, CREATE is a Nyanzan quasi-governmental organization responsible for
development and promotion of artistic and cultural interchanges among
Federation worlds as well as between the Federation and other Colonial States. 
Largely through the efforts of CREATE, Nyanzan artistic and cultural endeavors
are not only recognized but widely applauded throughout the Colonies Sphere. 
Artists from across the Sphere are drawn to the many educational institutions
operated by CREATE on Federation worlds.

Gaez Gavvi Eudrael (GGE): Roughly translated as "External Security
Directorate", the GGE is the primary Meren intelligence agency in the Colonies
Sphere.  Focused mainly on countering Aeroi efforts during the Markets War, its
operations have been scaled back with the end of that conflict.  Still, the GGE
is believed to have recruited Dolphin and Human agents from most Colonial
States in recent years.

House Moreira: A major Ouroran mercantile entity, Moreira provides passenger
and freight transport among Community worlds and operates interface routes as
well.  It is a Community leader in the manufacture and export of starships,
computers and robotics, and a variety of vehicles and crafts.  Moreira is also
the largest operator of starports in the community.
Lucent Templars: An elite military order of the Abrahamic Synod whose members
are found in all of the Synod\'s military services.  Appointment to the order is
made personally by the Supreme Aspirant and entails extensive, and highly
secret, religious and military training.  Claims that this includes training in
psionic disciplines have been vehemently denied by the order and have never
been substantiated by reliable sources.

Markets War: Period of confrontation (c2955-3000) between Aeroi and Meren
interests over access to markets in the Colonies Sphere.  While the two
entities never actually met in all-out war, each was involved in various
activities, including market monopolization, military support of local
governments and indigenous guerrilla movements, commercial and political
espionage, financial leveraging and arbitrage, and industrial and mercantile
sabotage, that resulted in often intense tension in the region.  Ended with the
political collapse of the Meren Expansionist Clique and the mysterious withdraw
of many Meren elements to their own sphere.

Prometheus Foundation: An independent research and development house that has
been instrumental in the dissemination of technology throughout the Colonies
Sphere.  Prometheus agents and researches are encountered throughout the Sphere
wherever technology is being developed.  Many states are critical of the
Foundation\'s insistence on sharing its technological innovations but none have
been willing to forego the advantages of cooperation with the Foundation.  The
Prometheus Foundation\'s origins trace back to a late 20th Century arms
manufacturer that translated military technology into commercial technology for
developing nations.  Among its more famous accomplishments has been the
subsector organization used by most States in the Sphere that was developed to
foster cooperation across borders.  The Prometheus Foundation also provides
minimum Class E starport facilities throughout the Sphere where such facilities
are beyond the capability of individual worlds.

Transtellar Lines: One of the major Commonwealth interstellar carriers,
Transtellar liners and freighters are common throughout Commonwealth space and
beyond.  Transtellar operates interface routes to all major Colonial States. 
Transtellar\'s origins trace back to a corporate charter granted during the
period of early sub-light re-colonization just prior to the development of jump
drive.

Universidad de Aztlan: The major university of the Empire of Aztlan is one of
the most respected educational institutions in the Colonies Sphere in the
fields of engineering and technology.  In addition to training cadets for the
Empire\'s military services the Universidad de Aztlan also graduates the
majority of the Empire\'s shipwrights and other starship industry technicians. 
Unlike other Aztlan universities, the UdeA does not accept students from
outside the Empire.

Ysinal udi-Quinan: The major Aeroi mercantile house in Auriga subsector is also
the largest organization of its type in the entire Colonies Sphere.  From its
headquarters on hvi-Unapfi, Ysinal udi-Quinan manages Aeroi investment and
trade development activities throughout the Sphere.  Even though a
quasi-governmental agency, Ysinal udi-Quinan includes several non-Aeroi
corporations among its holdings.

The Sirius subsector is named for its brightest star (at 1718.20) and contains
34 worlds including the Dolphin and Human homeworld of Earth 1720.19.  The
highest population is 8 billion at Earth.  The highest tech level is 13, at
Takla Makan, Ensanche, Orinoco, OleMweia\'s Belt and also at Earth.
Ten worlds in the subsector claim allegiance to the Commonwealth of Earth,
including its capital, Earth.  Two worlds claim allegiance to the Theridian
League to trailward in Theridia subsector and one world claims allegiance to
the Empire of Aztlan to spinward in Procyon subsector.

Good point.  I hope I\'m not trying to `force\' the Sword Worlds into my own
view of how they `should\' be but clearly that\'s how I\'m being perceived.
I\'ll have to try harder.

This is some really good stuff, except I thought Sharurshid and the other
Vilani megacorps had withdrawn to the Ziru Sirka during the Rebellion?
[WARNING: I don\'t have TNE!]  It seems to me that even if the Vilani
Bureaux had maintained a presence in the Domain of Deneb this presence
would have been cut-off by the Virus and the Quarantine Line and the
`Imperial\' megacorps would have assumed control of former Bureaux assets.


Now back to the Sword Worlds.  Hans Rancke <rancke@diku.dk> writes:

> Encountering their TL 12 fleet en route. Now what?

Well, first, remember in my scenario, Sacnoth hasn\'t been selling any TL 12
goods to Gram, and since they probably can\'t get any from the Darrians
or the Imperium (the Zhodani, maybe, I admit, but Sacnoth has similar access)
so the Sacnoth Fleet only encouters a TL 11 Gram Fleet.  (I believe this was
the case in the 5FW.  Forces from different worlds - Gram and Joyeuse -
reflected the TL of the specific world.  Anyone have easy access to those
*Fifth Frontier War* counters who can check for sure?)

Before I go further, let me say that I\'ve taken to heart Hans\'s (and Phil\'s)
comments that I should focus on the `facts at hand\'.  I\'m really trying to
come to an understanding of the situation based upon the facts rather than
my own view of `how it ought to be\'.  I just see many inconsistencies in
what few facts we have at hand.

> (Or _not_ encountering

Well, yes, but this is the nature of interstellar warfare in the Traveller
universe.  :-)

Well, maybe, except that if Sacnoth does it\'s `front work\' some of the
other Sword Worlds will be allied or at least tolerant of it\'s actions.  If
it hits the `leader\' of the opposition first the remaining worlds will be
less likely to jump up for their own `chance in the barrel\'.

> Perhaps this gave
> them an Us-and-Them mentality that prevails to this day.

Are those refugees *Piper\'s* `original Sword Worlders\' or GDW\'s?  :-)
I believe the original GDW Sword Worlders were merely fleeing the
Interstellar Wars rather than their own specific defeat.

This might be true, but I don\'t think Sacnoth (or whoever) will need to
`cripple\' the other worlds in order to dominate the Confederation.

> Which may be why Sachnoth is due for their own downturn on the cycle in the
> not too distant future.

I admit, if these `cycles\' exist it explains a lot, but I just don\'t see
what causes them, nor understand why the same thing hasn\'t happened in the
Imperium or the Darrian Confederation.

> Think about this for a moment. Sacnoth is not the US in that analogy, they 
> are another one of the Latin nations.

Okay, but I don\'t believe this situation is analogous in terms of the TL
disparities (I\'ll get to that in a bit).  In a `Latin\' scenario with no US
I see several different blocs centered about the `stronger\' nations like
Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia (which will see much more stability
when the US drug market disappears).  This is quite similar to Sword
Worlds history.  If one world rises to dominance (possibly with Zhodani
aid) I suspect it will stay there.  In a feudal technocracy, it ought to
be the highest tech world.

BTW, if Gram does maintain its position with Zhodani aid *and* the Sword
Worlders have this `us vs. them\' mentality it seems much more likely to
me that a combined fleet is going to show up at Gram, especially in light
of the anti-Zhodani sentiment in the Confederation.

> How significant is an advantage of 12 over 11 and 10?

Another measure would be the TL mods used in *5FW*.  I don\'t remember the
details (and my copy is 250 mi. away in Fort Worth) but I seem to
remember just a few battalions of TL 15 Imperial troops being able to
hold off several TL 10-11 corps of Sword Worlders.  Let\'s use the
figures you\'ve quoted until someone else digs up their copy of *5FW*.

Okay, let\'s look at the info I posted a while back:

Sword Worlds Subsector Data c1120 (from *MTJ* #3)
Tizon (+6)      0922 B386887-A M   Ri                   323 Sw  K2VI M3D

These are all the pop 8+ Sword Worlds.  Gram, at twice the population
of Sacnoth, ought to be able to fight the higher tech Sacnoth to a standstill.
Anduril, at one-tenth the population of Sacnoth, could choose the `winner\'
in such a conflict.  Narsil, at a ten-to-one advantage over Sacnoth, suffers
a twelve-to-one technological disadvantage.  Seems a Sacnoth-Anduril alliance
should be able to topple those `Zho-puppets\' on Gram.  Since Gram is the
capital that suggests a Gram-Anduril alliance (or Zhodani aid).

Where?  I doubt the Imperium or the Darrians would sell to the Sword Worlds.
The Zhodani, maybe, but what advantage do *they* have in fostering instability
in the Confederation?  A stable Sword Worlds on the border of the Imperium
would have been in the interest of the Zhodani!

I\'m wasn\'t thinking sabotage - I was thinking war-time embargo.  Tough to
wage a military campaign if you\'re buying your ammo-vehicles-medkits-
transport ships-*et al* from your adversary.

I doubt it.  At the risk of beating a dead horse, if allied Mexican-
Brazilian-Argentine troops had recently occupied San Diego and San Antonio
you can bet there would be *a lot* of support in the US for much more than
just `fostering instability\' in Latin America.  (It\'s often fashionable to
make light of US resolve as being `typical\' of great powers like the
Imperium but keep in mind the last time any `foreign\' troops were in the
US proper they were from Virginia, Georgia and Maryland!)  It\'s clear
that any supposed efforts by the Imperium to merely foster instability
in the Sword Worlds have been unsuccessful - it hasn\'t prevented them
from attacking every time the Zhos get a wild hair.

I\'m not sure I understand your point.  Regardless of why the Sword Worlds
have attacked the Imperium there are clearly reasons why the Imperium
hasn\'t `dealt\' with the Sword Worlds long ago.  I doubt the Zhodani would
have gone to war over an Imperial invasion of the Sword Worlds so there
must be some reason the Sword Worlds themselves were able to deter such
action.

I can\'t reconcile this `fact\' with the proposed `cycles\'.  (And yet, I
can\'t reconcile Gram\'s leadership either.  I\'m still generally confused
and dissatisfied.)

Again, this seems contradictory to me.  Any Imperial meddling in the Sword
Worlds has caused the *opposite* result - Sword Worlds incursions - so
why hasn\'t the Imperium sent ". . . the [Imperial] Marines to that little
[subsector spinward of Glisten] and *stopped* that problem!"?

> >The Zhodani may be a factor
> 
> I\'ve no doubt they are a major factor.

Okay, this seems the only reasonable solution.  The Zhodani are supporting
Gram in its leadership of the Confederation.  Through this support, and
*despite* the generally anti-Zhodani sentiments in the Sword Worlds, Gram
is able to maintain its leadership in spite of the greater technological
accomlishments of Sacnoth.  In addition to it\'s support of Gram, the
Consulate has made it clear to the Imperium that it will not tolerate
direct action against the Confederation.

In a sense, the Sword Worlds have been nothing more than a Zhodani client
state.  (Ouch!  That\'s tough to admit.)  To continue to tromp on my Latin
American analogy, it\'s as if the Soviets had supported a Cuban-Mexican-
Brazilian-Argentine-*et al* confederation that overran Florida, Texas,
and California every few decades (and Lanth and Glisten are more like
Yuma, Del Rio, and Key West).  It\'s shaky, but I can understand it.
Maybe the `anti-Zhodani sentiment\' in the Sword Worlds was just Imperial
propaganda?  (More likely, it was another poorly-considered `rationali-
zation\' by the original developers used to explain why psionics weren\'t
rampant in the non-Imperial Sword Worlds.)

Given this, one would expect some major changes in this relationship now
that the Virus has severed Deneb\'s connection with the Imperium and there
has been some *rapproachement* with the Zhodani.  The Zhodani no longer
get as much value from supporting Gram.  Scanoth rises triumphant!?!  :-)

So, what do you think?  Have I done it?  :-)

Well, I guess I still haven\'t explained my view of what a feudal technocracy
is.  The Sword Worlds leaders may be called `kings\' but they\'re more like
`CEOs\' - they are at the top of a huge, conglomerate, capitalist, economic
power structure.  They don\'t have an `empire\' just like the `barons\' of
the Japanese `keiritsu\' don\'t.  They have a cooperative arrangement - a
Confederation.

I think this has been some good work.  It\'s certainly helped me to understand
the Sword Worlds better.  I just hope Phil Pugliese:

When I first scoured Megatraveller, I thought I saw something to the effect
that, as you postulate, economics and infrastructure are what limit TLs.
TL10 traders sell TL10 computers to a TL8 world. Even if they have the
manuals and maintenace books, all the buyers are going to have to rely on
TL10 servicing, which would require TL10 computter training, probably from
imported engineers or natives who study abroad, etc. Essentially, they
can\'t just read the books - they need to be at least capable of
manufacturing the tech themselves and support it as well.

I would postulate that trade with more advanced planets may let you reach
higher TLs more quickly, but not immediately.

As for Earth, I think the differences between the Core and the Spinward
Marches (Regency) would be more akin to the difference between New York and
San Francisco & surrounding regions, circa 1890. S.F. was a pretty advanced
city for its time, but it in no way rivaled New York. It was still a
frontier, where they were still building the infrastructure that New York
alrady had.

You can\'t run before you can walk. Even if someone shows you how and holds
your hand, you still have to get there on your own.

Since James suggested this to us in the first place, that\'s probably
not an issue for him, or (if it is), he believes the ROI is worth it.

Unlikely, since those that enjoy TNE will either remain with the original
group, or join both groups and post as is appropriate.

Join both groups.  If the hassle is too much, maybe your enthusiasm isn\'t
enough.

True, but many of us feel that mixing TNE with earlier traveller is like
mixing _Ren_&_Stimpy_ with _Masterpiece_Theatre_.  In our eyes, the two are
mutually exclusive.

Careful when you use the word handful.  I\'m not sure how long you\'ve been
with the TML, but I\'m going on 6 (or so) years, and the number of voices
I\'ve seen disappear due to TNE is appalling.  I\'d hardly call it a \'handful\'.
Also, how many of the current subscribers are active contributors?  Maybe
there\'s a reason.

> The participation level of those who ditched wasn\'t that high anyways.

BZZZZZT!!  Nice try.  Thanks for playing.

Ask James about the old TML metrics.  At one point (several years ago),
I was one of the 3 highest-volumn posters (# of lines and frequency) on
the entire TML.  Metlay (God bless him), was also in that group, and he
fall dropped the TML altogether, rather than have to endure TNE.  Nick
Sylvain was also a high volumn contributor, and the only thing I\'ve seen
from him recently was his announcement of impending departure, also because
of TNE.

That\'s not really the point.  We (the anti-TNE folks) want to not have to
wade through the low signal-to-noise ratio that TNE presents in the TML.
It a separate group, it ceases to be a problem for us, and those of you
that enjoy TNE (and creamed spinich and enemas and so on...) can stay
right here and do exactly what you\'ve been doing all along.

> Seems like a rather lopsided issue to me.

Seems like a pretty selfish one to me.  You\'d rather keep us around, even
when we don\'t want to be here, rather than lose part of your audience?
This may cause many folks that dropped out to come back.  The flip side
is many are leaving anyway, they just don\'t have anywhere else to go.
The separate mailing list would resolve that.

If crowds is your scene, try commuting in Manhatten.

It seems I haven\'t explained my idea about the economic cycles well enough.
Basically I postulate a series of recessions and booms. Since I postulate
that the Sword Worlds have access to TL 15 physics texts from the Imperium,
I also assume that a lower-than-15 TL is the result of economic conditions:
A TL 12 world can\'t support the industry needed to build the TL 13 stuff
needed to maintain the TL 14 industry needed to build the TL 14 stuff
needed to maintain TL 15 industry. Got that? So a recession could (depending
on its severity) drop the TL of a world while a boom could raise it. Thus
I assume that Gram had TL 12 a few decades ago, which is when they built a
lot of their current fleet. (Remember, I also assume that a world can 
maintain ships and equipment at least two levels above their own TL). So
they have the ships and they can, if necessary, maintain it on their own. 
Furthermore, my thesis is that if Sacnoth wasn\'t selling TL 12 stuff at
competetive prices them Gram would build it on its own  -  the reason why
they aren\'t doing it now being that Sacnoth is selling it cheaper than they
could build it themselves. You see? It all hangs together. The situation
you postulate  -  that Sacnoth has a TL 12 fleet and Gram hasn\'t  -  is not
possibe under my assumptions.

>(I believe this was
>the case in the 5FW.  Forces from different worlds - Gram and Joyeuse -

I hadn\'t thought about that. Yes, I think you\'re right. I\'ll check. That
would certainly knock my theory over the head. Except that I just might
claim that FFW had made a mistake ;-) Ah, how difficult it is to abandon
a well-loved theory...

>Before I go further, let me say that I\'ve taken to heart Hans\'s (and Phil\'s)
>comments that I should focus on the `facts at hand\'.  

And if the Gram ships in FFW really are TL 11 (which I think they are) then
that comment is going to return and hit me in the face like a boomerang! ;-)

>I\'m really trying to
>come to an understanding of the situation based upon the facts rather than

Well, I\'ll continue my argument as if FFW didn\'t exist. For the moment,
anyway. Until I get a chance to think about it a bit.

Now you\'re postulating historical facts to support your view. This is no
more (and no less) valid than me postulating that Gram is the one that has
done its political homework and has the backing of the other Sword Worlds.
Either is equally possible in theory. But one of them has things turn out
the way GDW says they did and the other one dosen\'t. IMO one should prefer
the one that corresponds most closely to GDWs version.

Now, if you could demonstrate that Sacnoth couldn\'t possibly loose a
confrontation with all the other Sword Worlds then you\'d have something
much more solid.

Actually, while I\'ve no doubt that GDW\'s Sword Worlds owe their origin to
Piper, they actualy have a lot less in common with Piper\'s than one might
think.

I believe, however, that the GDW SW ancestors did, like Piper\'s SW ancestors,
flee a lost civil war.

Remember that my theory ties TLs tightly to the economy. I know it hasn\'t
worked that way on Earth today, but it\'s the only explanation that I can
see why nearly all worlds aren\'t TL 15. So relegate the TLs to the back-
ground for a moment and think about the world economies today. We\'ve got
economic boom/recession cycles. Why shouldn\'t the Sword Worlds? As to why
it dosen\'t happen in the Imperium and the Darrian Confederation:

        1) Maybe it does. Why is only 4 Imperial worlds in the Spinward
           Marches TL 15?

        2) Maybe they have a better control of the economy than the 
           Sword Worlds. The Imperium, at least, has enough size to
           dampen local problems.

So far no problem. This is just what the Sword world history says happened.

So this seems to be the assumption that dosen\'t fit. Examine it. Change it
to fit. Specifically the part of the assumption that has the individual
Sword Worlds tied together in an \'emperor-level\' feudal technocracy. Try
to imagine the tecnocracies stopping at the planetary level.

How deep is that anti-Zhodani sentiment? You assume they think of Zhodani
as a 50ties redneck thought of russians. Perhaps it\'s a 20th Century
Yankee/Southerner dislike.

Well, Steve\'s figures was about ships and not troops, but even so, there\'s
a ot of difference between a 12-11 disparity and a 15-10. In fact, Steve
claims that a TL 15 fleet has a 500-1 advantage over a TL 11 fleet and can
defeat any number of foes of lower TLs.

If, that is, wars were decided by mathematical formulae. Let\'s not get that
simplistic. Lots of instances in history where the apparently certain loser
didn\'t. I would have been satisfied if Gram wasn\'t too far behind. That
they are equal given a TL 11 fleet and clearly superior given a TL 12 fleet

Gram certainly needs allies given that the Zhodani help is covert enough to
be just a rumour. Perhaps Gram buys Zhodani ships at a discount. No feudal
technocrat could be very upset at a peer taking advantage of a good deal,
surely?

Perhaps the anti-Zhodani sentiment was strong on Sacnoth but weak on Gram
300 years ago. Nowadays they _do_ have a politically stable Confederation.
Gram has been in charge for three centuries.

How long does it take to go on a war-time production scedule? Always
remember that Gram knows perfectly well how to make these things. They
just can\'t make them as cheaply. That\'s the central point of my theory:
THE MOMENT SACNOTH STOPS SELLING TL 12 STUFF SOME OTHER SWORD WORLD

What time in history are you talking about? Just after the 3rd FW where
the Imperium occupied 12 of the Sword Worlds? Or after the 5th where they
set up a puppet government of half the Confederation? The Imperium _did_
a lot more just after these incursions. They just didn\'t keep it up for
centuries  -  which I consider perfectly politically plausible. After
the heat dies down a later government relaxes the more stringent measures.

But they did. The occupied half of them after the 3rd FW. Later they decided
that keeping up the occupation wasn\'t worth the bother. The 4th FW was
settled by negotiation, not Imperial conquest, so they didn\'t get a chance
there. After the 5th FW they cut them in half and tried with a puppet
government.

1) Why?
2) What if the Imperium wasn\'t as sure as you are?

Remember, on paper the Zodani _ought_ to have been able to kick the Imperial
ass. Nowadays we know that the reason why they didn\'t commit enough forces
to do this was that they didn\'t want to take over Deneb. They\'ve been 
static for 2 millenia (I have a private theory that they have some massive
internal troubles, but that\'s by the way). In essense, the Zhodani have
been playing a very cynical game with their Vargr and Sword World allies,
using them as cannon fodder. They never intended to win those wars (this,
much more than their thought police/doctors makes the Zhodani bastards
in my books). But neither the Imperium nor the Sword Worlds knew that. The
Imperium were frightened enough of the Zhodani potential to refrain from
taking drastic advantage of any of their victories; the Sword Worlds were
impressed enough to get suckered into yet another Outworld Coalition.

>Again, this seems contradictory to me.  Any Imperial meddling in the Sword

The Sword World incursions were a result of the Zhodani alliance, and had
nothing to do with their strength relative to the Imperium.

They have. They just took them home again after a while.

How general are those sentiments? Or rather, how violent? Is it a general
\'kill-the-zhos\' hate (your choice?), a somewhat widespread \'all psionics/
zhos needs bashing\' resentment (my own choice), or an occasional \'zhos 
stink\' dislike?

Not technological accomplishment (What\'s the accomplishment in buying an
Imperial physics textbook?). Temporary economic advantage.

Quite possible.

Make that overran every two centuries and you\'re nearer the mark. This is
actually quite important. If the Sword Worlds really bothered the Imperium
every other decade then I agree with you that the Imperium would do
something about them. But they don\'t. And, disregarding the 4th FW, the
Imperium has taken quite decisive action whenever the Sword Worlds have 
ovestepped the line.

OK. So you think the Confederation is one huge Feudal Technocracy, right?
I think it is a confederation of (mostly) feudal technocracies. On what
do you base your assumption that it must be the one and can\'t be the other?
(Note that my argument is that if both are possible then we should choose
the assumption that fits the facts best. Only if one is inevetable or the
other impossible should we choose in despite of the known facts). I won\'t
dispute that if you have a lot of feudal technocracies on the planetary 
then a further feudal level is a distinct possibility. All I\'m saying is
that it\'s not inevetable, that a planetary king could just as well think
of himself as a real king and treat the other kings as such.

All I need is the air that I breathe...
- ----

One of the hazards of space travel is going to be running out of breathable 
    air. When considering a particular \'scene\' for a scenario I was 
    planning, I realised I had no good idea of how long it takes a person 
    to use up the available air in a sealed room. So, some questions for 
    the list.

Imagine you are in a sealed room. How long does it take a person to die 
    because the air gets bad - and why? Is it lack of Oxygen, or the 
    presence of impurities?

If the room is filled not with air, but with Oxygen only:
- -   what atmospheric pressure should it be at to be safe? I believe that if 
    the pressure is too high the atmosphere promotes any sort of minor 
    spark into a serious fire/explosive hazard.

- -   how long before a typical human unfortunate dies from bad air in this 
    scenario.

Some questions on firearms...
- ----

 ..   At what tech level can you build guns out of non metallic materials?

 ..   What sort of non metallic materials are possible - plastics, carbon 
    fibre, or what? 

 ..   At what tech level can you build caseless ammo and weapons to use it? 
    And when does the result become as practical as weapons using cased 
    ammo?

Note:
    I\'m interested in both real world comments as well as comments based on 
    whatever is covered in (CT/MT/TNE) Traveller rules.

I have an \'act first think later\', hot shot pilot player character, Cal Morgan,
who wants a high tech pistol with some kick. I gave him a Gauss pistol. On
reflection I thought I would try to design a heavy TL 11 pistol utilising
electro-chemical propulsion; I picked up FF&S and had a go. This produced some
interesting results, and a weapon much more to Cal\'s tastes. Below are all the
workings for the weapon with design notes, followed by an observation on the

Design Notes

My first stab at designing using FF&S. A very user friendly product, and soon
got results. If you spot any bad errors let me know.

The major difficulty with this design was keeping the weight down! With such a
high muzzle energy the receiver came in at a hefty 1.2 kg. I fiddled with the
muzzle energy to get it out at under 2001 to preserve the 1-Nil penetration.

Why do weapons with muzzle energy of 2001 to 3000 drop penetration back to
2-Nil????????

The ECT weapon system had battery weight costs for the magazine, but took away
the recoil due to it\'s firing mechanism.

I found the barrel length and casing length vital to the design, as this
determined the muzzle energy, and thus the receiver characteristics. I rifled
the barrel. Is this ok on a pistol? (I am afraid I don\'t know anything about
real guns).

The weapon is a heavy sidearm, known as a \'Pulse Pistol\' as ECT weapons use an
intense pulse of electrical energy to ignite the working fluid in the round to
a plasma state. ACRs in my campaign are called Pulse Rifles. . .

Having put together my design I looked back at the Gauss pistol in the upgrade
booklet to see how it compared. I just couldn\'t believe how poor the stats
were. TL 13 weapon with a SS recoil of 5? It can fire bursts, but with a recoil
of 11? A short range of 11 meters?

I applied a quick assumption that the pistol had a Muzzle Velocity of 1500
(FF&S p.102). Without designing the whole system, and using the knowns found in
the upgrade booklet, I reckon the stats for the weapon should look more like
below:

TL 13 Gauss Pistol
                                                 Recoil
Weapon                  Rof Dam  Pen    Blk Mag SS  Brst Rng

4mm Gauss Pistol - Dart  5   2   Nil    1   35   2   6   19
4mm Gauss Pistol - HEAP  5   3   2-2-2  1   35   2   6   14
4mm Gauss Pistol - tranq 5   -1  Nil    1   35   2   5   11

I struggle to get the stats found in the upgrade booklet. Any thoughts anyone?

I am now into session 2 of refereeing DGP\'s \'Flaming Eye\' campaign, using the
wholly superior TNE rule set. I believe the Imperium to be a superior
background, and TNE to be a better set of rules. Right now I have the best of
both worlds.

I\'ll keep this short, but here is my .02Cr on splitting the list.  I enjoyed
CT and never really liked MT.  I can deal with TNE.  Except for the change in
the Maneuver Drives I like the new vehicle design better.
 
I don\'t want to see the mailing list split.  But seeing how some people pay
for their mail by the byte I can understand not wanting to recieve mail you
don\'t want.  It is throwing money away to them.  For me mail is part of my
basic service at a local BBS. For $0.25 an hour I can afford extra mail.  So
rather than lose the CT posters, I must say split the list.  I can afford to
subscribe to another mailing list and I will as I\'m interested in Traveller in
ALL forms.
 
The tagging of messages by prefixing them with a CT, MT, or TNE was a great
idea.  And would work if this was a newsgroup and I could use a off line
reader.  With the mailing list though, you still run into the price per byte
for some people.
 
Again, these are my views, but I believe they make sense.
 
One last comment on something someone else mentioned.  TSR supports multiple
setting for AD&D.  You\'re right. Why didn\'t GDW do the same?  And rather than
the virus, cleaning up after the Rebellion would have taken a few hundred
years anyway.

Okay, you may remember when James initially posted the suggestion of
creating another mailing list for the anti-TNE crowd that I jumped at
the idea.  Since then I\'ve had some second thoughts.

I\'m going to get to Mark Cook\'s arguments for the separate list in a moment.
(Nothing personal Mark, you\'re just a handy proponent.)  First though, I\'d
like to explain my own situation.  I\'m pretty new to TML - only having 
subscribed in January of this year.  I think since then though, I\'ve been
a pretty active contributor - for good or ill!  :-)  I started the CT/MT
vs. TNE background discussion a while back and I think most of you ought
to know that I have little use for TNE.  I don\'t give a hoot about rules
(I never even used the CT/MT rules for much of anything except character
and world generation) and I feel the TNE background offers *nothing* over
what could have been done with a CT/MT `frontier sourcebook\'.  While I 
have just about *every* GDW and DGP product since those first `Three Little
Black Books\', I have not purchased *any* TNE products and I\'m seriously
considering letting my subscription to *Challenge*, which goes back to
*JTAS* #5, expire.

That said, Mark Cook <markc@CSOS.ORST.EDU> writes:

One might suggest the same about `oldtimers\' who find it too much hassle to
put up with the `noise\' of TNE postings.

I\'m not sure I buy this.  If all these folks were still contributing there
wouldn\'t be such a `low signal-to-noise\' ratio.

Hmmm.  There seems to be plenty `selfishness\' to go around here.  Look, 
I\'m just as pissed as anyone at what GDW has done to Traveller and I don\'t
appreciate these `newbies\' bitching about my `whining\' all the time either
but that doesn\'t mean I want to pick up my toys and go play by myself.

I doubt it, but I\'d like to offer a challenge to allow you to prove me wrong.
Let\'s have all these hordes of oldtimers `walk their walk\' instead of just
`talk their talk\'.  Let\'s see what this new mailing list would look like
right her in TML.  Beginning June 1st (which should give enough time to
get the word out and to let folks transitioning from school to get settled
for the summer) let\'s have `Pre-TNE Days on TML\' for all these oldtimers
who are just bursting with megabytes of pre-PIE-in-the-sky information to
contribute.

I would *love* the opportunity to participate in discussions about Imperial
background.  That\'s what I loved about HIWG (except I wasn\'t `on-line\'
with GENIE which kept me somewhat `ghettoized\').  I would *love* to develop
*other* campaign backgrounds like the Earth Colonies on TNE.  If folks were
really contributing like this I suspect all the TNE devotees would be
`dropping out\' or clamoring for their `own\' list.  (Sorry, newbies.)

But I don\'t think that will happen.  I suspect those folks who are dropping
out have a variety of other reasons besides merely the TNE `signal-to-
noise\' ratio - things like other priorities in their lives now, something
that happens to all of us.  But please, go ahead and prove me wrong beginning
June 1st.

I also think there is another problem with creating a new list.  Namely, if we
start with the anti-TNE crowd, where do we stop?  I (and many others I
suspect) was never very pleased with MegaTraveller and the Rebellion.  Do
we get a pre-MT/Rebellion list next?  How about a `background only\' list
so I don\'t have to be hassled by all those pesky, boring discussions about
laser comm frequencies and starship lavatory design?  What about an anti-
Grandfather list for those of us who disliked that whole fantasy trip?
And another list where the Sword Worlds don\'t have those d**ned economic
cycles of Hans\'s?  :-)

Now, please, Mark (and others), let\'s not have more argument about our
arguments about a new list.  Just take me up on my challenge and start
posting all that pre-TNE stuff to the TML.  You don\'t even have to wait
until June 1st - get that `signal-to-noise\' ratio up *now* because every bit
of bandwidth that\'s wasted arguing against me instead of being pre-TNE
posts just makes my case and argues against a separate list.

OK, let me propose why the Impies and Zhos don\'t use \'em: it\'s a 
*political* decision.

Suppose deep-space refueling stations are common.  Then, worlds which
are 6-12 parsecs in from the border become vulnerable to attack without
warning.  They would thus want some defensive elements stationed full-
time in their system.  This would probably at least quadruple the fleet
elements that would have to be deployed to provide "border coverage" for
all these "non-border" systems.

Can the Navy support all these requests?  I don\'t think this is likely.
You run the risk of being spread too thin.  So what is the enterprising
World Leader to do?  Build a big system fleet or lots of planetary
defense fortifications.

However, how are a planet\'s big system defense fleets and large planetary
defense batteries perceived by its Larger Political Entity (Imperium or Con-
sulate)?  I think they do not like them at all.  First I\'ll give some
Traveller facts and then I\'ll do some interpretation.

Fact 1: Planetary defense forts are not covered in Traveller literature.  The
closest thing is "planetary defense battalions" from the boardgame "Invasion:
Earth", which are not that effective.

Fact 2: System defense boats are the accepted mechanism for system defense.
But, the quantities for these seem very low.  I think a Traveller News
Service brief from the JTAS "War" issue read something like "the ten heavy
SDBs in the Regina system were sent to defend the system gas giant, which
would be the first priority of an attacking fleet."  This seems like a
very small number for a world at the edge of the Imperium.

Interpretation: The Larger Political Entity (Imperium or Consulate) does
not allow large system defense forces.  This would give too much power
to the individual worlds.  By taking responsibility for defense of the
whole LPE, the LPE Navy can be used for "showing the flag" and other semi-
coercive means of keeping the member worlds in line.  This will allow the
member worlds to exist together more peacefully, since they can\'t easily 
have internal military disputes.  (Also makes single-world rebellions
difficult.)

To summarize Cynthia, deep-space refueling implies the need to fortify
planetary bodies.  Given the need to enforce internal cohesion, however,
the Imperium and Consulate have decided to not allow large (autonomous)
planetary defenses.  Thus, they both did not use deep space refueling
stations during the Frontier Wars.

I would assume large planetary defenses (and fuel dumps) would be much
more prevalent in Trillion Credit Squadron games, which have much smaller
(probably single-system) political entities.

Comments are appreciated...

As far as I see, the only issue is if enough people are

those that have already left because of TNE.  People who
want it all can just subscribe to both.

The only inconvenience this should cause is if a great

past high-volume contributors have largely been quiet or
left the list, this seems unlikely.

Officially, we don\'t know a blessed thing except the vague allusions in
_Survival Margin_.  Much like the whole "Who are these IRIS people?"
business from Strephon.  A quick unofficial guess-work analysis:

Longbow appears to be some sort of psionic-based interstellar communications
project, possibly in the research phase since prior to the First Civil War
and First Interstellar War, which appearently has come to fruition by the
early 1100s, at least enough to cause Strephon to consider repeal of the
Psionics Suppression Acts of the early 800s.  

Someone or something named Pentecost is connected to the project.  Pentecost
was the day upon which the disciples of Jesus were "filled with the Holy
Spirit and began to speak in other tongues", and is a Jewish feast day 
celebrating the first fruits of the harvest.

Longbow was apparently being used to warn the Imperial government of some
sort of mysterious threat approaching the Imperium at superluminal speeds
and which would apparently reach the outer borders in about 1202.

Make of the tidbits what you will.  Apparently Pentecost went missing
during the Rebellion.  Strephon apparently witnessed a test from the
Depot at Lishun to Capital, but we don\'t know much since he was busy
waxing obscure...er, poetic.  This is one of those "increasing the aura
of mystery" things that GDW is so hot on these days.  (No implied value
judgment intended.)

 I admit to mixed feelings about this move, but will probably end

  While I agree with this statement, I can\'t see that creating a
seperate group for CT/MT folks will reverse the "loss to the game"
except among the TML lists.

 >This list will exist to discuss the Imperium in the Classic and

  Similarly, the "base-line" TML will not be a CT/MT-free zone.  I
refuse to cater to isolationists\' desires for a monopoly of information.
My Traveller posts will go to _whoever_ is interested, on either list.
  Also, given the nature of netters and gamers, the list split will
not end the superiority argument/gripe.  I refuse to point fingers at
current TMLers, but the publicity that the split will demand will
inevitably attract new members to both lists whose interest is in
"The Difference". I have yet to see a group of netters who can
completely resist that kind of salt in an old wound.  Expect flare-ups.

 >Depending on initial response, application of TNE rules to the
 >Classic and Rebellion settings may be tolerated.

  As most of the CT/MT folks are primarily hot about the setting (or,
in their words, the lack of one), I certainly _hope_ that rules
cross-overs will be "tolerated".  Why?
  One of this list\'s strong points used to be its vehicle posts and
discussions.  Unfortunately, the primary vehicle designers are all
among the Anti-TNE group, and most have not bothered to even _glance_
at the TNE vehicle design rules (I\'m sure someone will respond and
give us a list of reasons for this, so I won\'t anticipate them).
  I have used every edition of the rules.  I started my Traveller
years with the purchase of the brand new JTAS #4. I consider the
current ship-building and ship-to-ship combat rules to be better
meshed and more usable than ANY previous edition. ANY. What\'s more,
these rules are such that they can be used with any previous edition
of the roleplaying rules with much less translation work than might
be expected. Part of the work has already been done
(see TML message 534/6615 for "Three-Pack Turrets").  I\'m sure
that the rest will be discussed in detail. You have only ask, and
the TML will produce _someone_ with an answer.

    'body' => 'Gentlesophonts:

Dug out my *Rebellion Sourcebook* and pulled out the following information
to start some development of the Regency Navy for our TML Regency sourcebook
*Shall Not Perish*.

First off, the *RS* states that a typical Imperial sector fleet consists
of about 1000 combat ships (battles, cruisers, carriers and escorts as
opposed to tankers, scouts and auxilliarires) which averages out to 62.5
ships per subsector.  Each subsector has a `numbered\' regular fleet and
a `reserve\' colonial fleet.  A numbered fleet has 2-10 squadrons and from
50-200 ships.  This suggests that the `1000 ships\' number must only refer
to numbered fleets since an average of 62.5 ship per subsector would mean
only 31 ships each for the numbered and reserve fleets.  This is consistent
with other comments that the sector fleet is composed of the numbered 
subsector fleets but conflicts with statements that include the reserve 
fleet as part of the sector fleet.  Nevertheless, I\'ll deal with only
the numbered fleet ships here.

So here\'s a break down of the Regency Navy based upon the information in
the *RS* (all numbers are approximate):

Spinward Marches Fleet (11 fleets, 687 ships):
212th Fleet (Jewell)              213th Fleet (Regina)
214th Fleet (Aramis)              193rd Fleet (Vilis)
18th Fleet (Lanth)                23rd Fleet (Rhylanor)
43rd Fleet (Lunion)               73rd Fleet (Mora)
208th Fleet (Five Sisters)        100th Fleet (Glisten)
207th Fleet (Trin\'s Veil)

Deneb Fleet (16 fleets, 1000 ships):
194th Fleet (Pretoria)            212th Fleet (Lamas) [same # as Jewell?]
151st Fleet (Antra)               61st Fleet (Million)
195th Fleet (Sabine)              257th Fleet (Inar)
125th Fleet (Dunmag)              88th Fleet (Atsah)
196th Fleet (Star Lane)           258th Fleet (Vincennes)
154th Fleet (Usani)               183rd Fleet (Geniishir)*
193rd Fleet (Gulf)                260th Fleet (Zeng)
55th Fleet (Kamlar)*              184th Fleet (Vast Heavens)*
*probably reduced strength due to smaller patrol area

Trojan Reach Fleet (4 fleets, 250 ships):
201st Fleet (Pax Rulin)*          202nd Fleet (Gazulin)
203rd Fleet (Sindal)*             204th Fleet (Tobia)
*probably reduced strength due to smaller patrol area

Reft Fleet (3 fleets, 188 ships)
19th Fleet (Vestus)               74th Fleet (Macon)*
128th Fleet (Usher)*
*probably reduced strength due to smaller patrol area

Total Regency Navy (c1120): 34 fleets, 2125 ships

Several fleets have been `displaced\' as a result of the Viral and *ihatei*
assaults: 151st Fleet, 61st Fleet, 125th Fleet, 88th Fleet, 55th Fleet,
184th Fleet, 203rd Fleet and 204th Fleet.

These assets might have been transferred to the Quarantine Service.

There\'s lot\'s of development work to do here: squadron composition of each
of these 34 fleets, squadron and fleet commanders, deployment and force
compositions, etc.

Jump in and have a bite!

Thanks, Mark, for taking the pre-TNE position and expressing it more
eloquently than I have.

The level of contribution today is similar to what the old TML enjoyed,
but the contributor\'s names and the topics are quite different. The old
TMLers are now no longer listening, and pre-TNE era support, which these
people would love to do, founders due to lack of a forum in which to
discuss it.

The sheer volume of the postings is what turn off several many listeners
- -- even casual listeners frequently drop the TML because they cannot
drink from the fire hose.

The subject line (and enforcement) idea has given me an idea. Currently
TMLers can select three frequencies: nightly, twice-weekly, and archive
bundle. Maybe a better approach is for TML to join the information age
and allow subscribers to select digests automatically cutomized to their
interests, filtering the traffic for them, based on article subject
lines. These digests would allow each subscriber to adjust the traffic
level as well as topical interest.

Users could subscribe to any or all of the following subject interest
areas (notice that existing topical interest lists like CAT could easily
be grafted on as topical subject areas of TML):

        CAT             - Computer-Aided Traveller
        Classic         - Black Book/Traveller Book Ruleset
        MT              - MegaTraveller Ruleset
        TNE             - TNE Ruleset
        Imperium        - Third Imperium Era
        Rebellion       - Rebellion Era
        Regency?        - Regency Era
        Admin           - List Administrivia
        Announce        - New product, list, pbem announcements, etc.
        Miscellaneous   - Stuff that doesn\'t fit the above

What it would take from me is a serious dedication of time to develop
the filterers and list management. I\'d also need to add a robo-admin to
allow people to automatically maintain their list of topical items, and
develop instructions clear enough that even net-newbies can deal with
them.

Sounds like a lot of work, more than I may be willing to chew off.
Still, it\'s interesting. I\'ll let you know if there\'s any chance this is
doable.

In the mean time, it would probably be wise for me to set up the simple,
pre-TNE mailing list to stop the exodus today before the Third Imperium
dies in the hearts of its fans.

I\'d be willing to investigate mechanisms to help implement this
scheme (which I like a *lot*) when I get back from Central America,
if you\'re interested in any help.

Yes, please.  If introduced as a transitional tool (of indeterminate
duration), we can placate the anti-TNE camp (which I sit firmly in),
and then work on a more elegant solution (such as you propose above)
at our leisure.

Okay, we\'ve started with the Regency Navy, now let\'s take a look at the
Regency Army.  By `army\' I mean `mobile\' ground forces available for off-
world actions.

I\'m using the article "Troops in the Fifth Frontier War" from *JTAS* #10
as a reference for determining troop availability.  Thanks also to Steve
Bonneville for `grepping\' data on Deneb high-tech worlds in TML msg
592/7421 from May 4th.

At TL 16, only worlds with Pop 7+ will have mobile troops.  The only Regency
world that meets this criteria is Vincennes.  At Pop A, Vincennes can
support three (3) `army\'-sized (combat factor 5C) units (3 x 5C-16).

For convenience let\'s identify these units as follows:

1st Vincennes Army (TL 16)
2nd Vincennes Army (TL 16)
3rd Vincennes Army (TL 16)

TL 15 worlds also must have pop 7+ in order to support mobile troops. In
the Regency, Magash (pop 9), Starn (pop 9), Dekha (pop A), Rhylanor (pop 9),
Mora (pop A), Glisten (pop 9), Trin (pop A in the Rebellion era - but
destroyed by the Virus in TNE) and Lintl (pop A) meet this requirement.
Dekha, Mora and Lintl will support three armies like Vincennes:

1st Dekha Army (TL 15)
2nd Dekha Army (TL 15)
3rd Dekha Army (TL 15)
1st Mora Army (TL 15)
2nd Mora Army (TL 15)
3rd Mora Army (TL 15)
1st Lintl Army (TL 15)
2nd Lintl Army (TL 15)
3rd Lintl Army (TL 15)

The pop 9 worlds can support four (4) `corps\'-sized (combat factor 1C)
units (4 x 1C-15) as follows:

1st Magash Corps (TL 15)
2nd Magash Corps (TL 15)
3rd Magash Corps (TL 15)
4th Magash Corps (TL 15)
1st Starn Corps (TL 15)
2nd Starn Corps (TL 15)
3rd Starn Corps (TL 15)
4th Starn Corps (TL 15)
1st Rhylanor Corps (TL 15)
2nd Rhylanor Corps (TL 15)
3rd Rhylanor Corps (TL 15)
4th Rhylanor Corps (TL 15)
1st Glisten Corps (TL 15)
2nd Glisten Corps (TL 15)
3rd Glisten Corps (TL 15)
4th Glisten Corps (TL 15)

These 16 corps are equivalent to three `armies\' (with one corps remaining).
Regency troops at lower tech levels can be developed from the UWP values
using the *JTAS* #10 article.  I\'m not sure what the TL cutoff is but
regular `Imperial\' troops do not go below TL 13 or so.  Can someone with
*5FW* help us out here?

This basis should provide a similar starting point for development as did
the Regency Navy post: what are the deployment, organization, commanders,
etc. of these Regency Armies?

At the a high atmospheric pressure oxygen becomes toxic.  This is the reason
Scuba divers use compressed air instead of oxygen.  At normal pressure the
fire risk from an all oxygen atmosphere is very high.  

The breathable air in a room is converted to bad by a person consuming
oxygen which is replaced by carbon dioxide.  Eventually the lowering oxygen
levels will cause a person to die from oxygen starvation.  At which point
I don\'t know but the amount of oxygen used by a person depends upon their
activity rate.  By doing little the air in a room can be made to last longer.

Away to extend the time a person has in a sealed room is to have someway
to replace the oxygen.  If there was a bottle of compressed oxygen in the
room it could be opened occasionaly to increase the oxygen levels.  This
may have to be done carfeully if there is no gravity in the area.  If a valve
on a bottle of compressed gas is broken, the bottle can smash through brick
walls.

Expanding on the Regency Navy and Army posts, let\'s look at the Sword
Worlds in detail.  This exercise might serve as an example for expansion
of any Regency subsector military forces.

There are no clear rules (with the exception of possible *Trillion Credit
Squadron*, which I don\'t have) tying naval forces to any sort of UWP data.
Based upon the `1000 ships per sector\' mentioned in the *Rebellion 
Sourcebook* we get an `average\' of 62.5 ships per subsector.  Based upon the
world generation rules, in the Spinward Marches we get an average of 26.7
worlds per subsector with a total average subsector population of 46 billion.
This, combined with the average ship figure, works out to an average of
roughly 700,000,000 people per regular naval combat ship.  This is a very
rough number, and specifically does not account for tech level effects, but
I\'ll use it nevertheless.  I welcome any `less soft\' figures though.

This number suggests that only Pop 8+ worlds will be able to support regular
naval forces.  This doesn\'t quite `jive\' with *5FW* (Joyeuse, a Pop 7
worlds raised a fleet) but it\'s a fair working point.

Combining this with the *JTAS* #10 "Troops in the Fifth Frontier War"
article we get the following forces for major Sword Worlds:

Tizon (pop 300,000,000; TL 10)
 No ships
 One corps (1C-10), two divisions (20-10)
Narsil (pop 20,000,000,000; TL 10)
 29 ships (J1-10)
 Four armies (5C-10), one corps (1C-10)
Anduril (pop 200,000,000; TL 11)
 No ships
 One corps (1C-11), one division (20-11)
Gram (pop 6,000,000,000; TL 11)
 Nine ships (J2-11)
 Five corps (1C-11), one brigade (10-11)
Sacnoth (pop 3,000,000,000; TL 12)
 Four ships (J3-12)
 Five corps (1C-12), one brigade (10-12)
Sting (pop 300,000,000; TL 10)
 No ships
 One corps (1C-10), two divisions (20-10)

Thus, the entire Confederate Navy consists of 42 ships.  The Confederate
Army consists of something around seven armies.  These figures seem a little
low but keep in mind there has been no accounting for what are called
reserve or `colonial\' forces in the Imperium.  These are `older\' forces
used to supplement the regular forces.  For the Confederate naval reserve
let\'s assume an additional 42 ships but at one TL below that of the regular
forces: 29 at TL 9 (J1-9), nine at TL 10 (J1-10) and four at TL 11 (J2-11).
These `reserve\' forces may have comprised the Joyeuse Fleet of the 5FW.

The Confederate regular army forces are for offworld or `offensive\'
operations and do not reflect indigieous defense battalions on each world.

This example could be used to develop naval and army forces for any subsector
in the Regency (or elsewhere).  I hope we see it so applied!

Since it is getting late, and I don\'t want to root through my pile of 
Traveller stuff just before going to bed, I won\'t try to cite page numbers.
However, we do know that "deep meson gun sites" are the preferred method
of ground-based planetary defense, and that these are supplemented by
ground-based missiles and lasers.  I agree that these devices do not show
up in 5FW, which I _do_ have in front of me as I type.

Regina has only 10 SDBs, according to the 5FW map.  However, the numbers of
boats are strongly dependent on population, and Regina is not a high-population
world.  Jewell has 120 TL12 boats, Efate 150 at TL13, Rhylanor has 200 at
TL15, Zivije 120 at TL11, Louzy _500_ at TL8, Rethe has another 500, and
Porozlo has 1000 SDBs at TL10. 5FW does not distinguish between TLs for SDB
efficiency, so those 1000 Porozlo boats are quite a menace to any invading
Zho fleet.  Checking the population levels produces the following:

Population A: 500-1000 SDBs
           9: 100-200
           8: 10-12
           7: 1
          6-: 0

Note that some of the worlds in the population 8 or higher category also
contribute local jump-capable squadrons to the Imperial forces in 5FW.

I don\'t really think that the Imperium (as depicted) is all that hostile 
to local forces.

This reminds me--someone posted a few weeks ago that they didn\'t think that
the Imperium allowed multi-planet governmental bodies.  Go back and check
Adventure 7: Broadsword, for an example of a world (Garda Vilis) ruled from
the neighboring world (Vilis).  Also, there are quite a few type 6 governments
in the Spinward Marches.  I play that _some_ of these may be under direct
Imperial control, but the majority are in situations like that of Garda
Vilis.

I think you eventually pass out from the unrecycled air - you fall asleep
as your brain gets oxygen starved, and you don\'t wake up until the New Era
;)

>If the room is filled not with air, but with Oxygen only:

        You will die. Pure oxygen is poisonous to people, especially at
high pressures (this from a Cthulhu adventure I ran based on the bottom of
the South Pacific, but also corroborated by my J-o-T skill).

>- -   what atmospheric pressure should it be at to be safe? I believe that if

        See above. I\'m not quite sure that oxygen is poisonous at normal
pressure, but I\'m sure it is under pressure. And yes, pure oxygen and
sparks do not mix in a pleasant fashion.

>- -   how long before a typical human unfortunate dies from bad air in this
>   scenario.

        Depends on how much such a human had to start with. How big is the
room? When does the air shut off? Are thei spare tanks?

I think you could hedge on this to whatever is appropriate to the
adventure. Just assume that the room had x hours of air left, or had x
hours of backup air, or that x hours of air are in some convenient Vacc
Suits lying in the corner.

>At what tech level can you build guns out of non metallic materials?

Define Gun. You can build a simple gun-like contraption from natural
materials. If you want something more refined then you will have to wait
until the proper process comes along. I would say that only at TL7-8 (I\'m
more used to GURPS TLs, but I think those are the corresponding Traveller
TLs for Modern Times) for the ceramic/plastic guns that seem to get past
metal detectors.

> ..   What sort of non metallic materials are possible - plastics, carbon

I\'d bet MacGyver could build a simple Cannon-Locke or Matchlock out of
Bamboo and twine. . .

I would say the modern day. Caseless ammo requires being able to
manufacture a round with the powder already on it and not held by a
cartridge. Of course, technically I guess the old ball-and-musket was
"caseless" in a sense. . .

Granted, but the \'two group\' idea would solve the problem for both
groups.  Those that don\'t like TNE can avoid it easily, and those
that like all the Traveller variations can mail to and read both lists.

The ratio would be better, but the noise wouldn\'t be any less.  To me
(and, I suspect, many others), getting 1000 lines of useful material
out of 2000 lines of signal is not much better than getting 200 lines
of useful material out of 1200 lines of signal.

The problem is, Dave, that a lot of folks have alreayd picked up their
toys and left.  This might (no guarantees) get some of them back.  I say
this not because I just want the increased volume, but because many of
them were outstanding contributors.

Sigh.  I wish it were that easy.  I\'d love to prove you wrong, in the
fashion you offer, just to get the old timers back.  Unfortunately, if
any sort of pre-TNE incentive is offered, I suspect that what we\'re
more likely to see is a gradual return of some of the more interested
folks.  There are many that are still members of the TML today, but
just don\'t speak up out of lack of interest in the TNE.  If I weren\'t
so mouthy, you wouldn\'t ever hear from me. :^)  Scott Kellogg doesn\'t
post nearly as often as he used to before TNE (although his posts are
every bit as worthwhile and valuable as they used to be.)  Surprisingly
enough, this very subject (the TML/TNE split) has brought a couple
of old-timers out of the shadows, if ever so briefly, to wit:

For those folks that remember, we\'ve lost the priceless wisdom
of Metlay, the wonderful ship designs of Rob Dean, and many
others.  I never see posts from Bertil Jonell any more, and
I can\'t recall the last time Adrian Hurt stomped me into a

voices are silent, and I for one, would almost anything to
get them back.

It has been suggested (and argued) that the TML list should be split into
several splinter groups.

I think that both sides have stated their points of view:
1) The volume and noise/signal ratios of the current TML are too high for me.
2) What\'s a little volume, it\'s the contributions that matter, wade through the
   cruft - the rest of us do.

Personally, I find myself falling into the first camp for various reasons, some
of which are technical and some of which are personal.  Firstly, I receive the
nightly bundles, which is about all that I can handle at one sitting since I\'m
saddled with a MUA that does _not_ automatically break the digests down into
individual messages for me.  This same limitation in my MUA requires me to wade
through entire articles that I couldn\'t give a hoot about just to get to a
short posting that I _am_ interested in.

I think that James\'s suggestion of automatic, individualized digests would make
everyone happy, you get what you want to read, you can post to the relevant
sub-lists as needed, heck you can cross-post if it\'s relevant to more than one
group.

I don\'t think that requiring a special "tag" in the subject line is the proper
way to go about things, though.  It makes much more sense to me (from a
technical point of view) to have separate mailing addresses for each of the
list, as well as separate "digestifiers" for each list.  If you want to
cross-post then send the message to all of the lists that are (or might be)
concerned.

I might also include a list called "Traveller-general",(or somesuch) that would
(hopefully) have broad appeal.  In the case of a cross-post to more than (say)
three sub-groups, the _actual_ message woud be posted to Traveller-general, and
only a short pointer message would be cross-posted to the others.

Yes, this scheme requires some thought in posting, but the poster _has_ to
realize that he/she\'s not only using up his/her own time, but the time of
countless others that may or may not have the same specific interests.

I think that it would be much more efficient in general to split the various
sub-groups out, require those that are interested to subscribe (or perhaps
subsribe them by default, and let them unsubsribe if they wish) than to
continue with the current high-volume mish-mash that we currently have.

As an aside, I probably will subscribe to any and all Traveller related mailing
lists that get created.  The main advantage for me will be that I\'ll be able to

I \'ve been following the discussion, and note a *major* suumption being
made by practically everyone. An incorrect assumption, at that.

Interstellar space is not "empty". It\'s full of all sorts of dark
matter. Comet nuclei, the occasional planet,  giant molecular clouds,
etc.

A comet nucleus is a "dirty snowball", that is, it\'s water ice, with
amonia, methanne, and a fair amount of "dirt". The dirt willl be mostly
fairly finely divided stuff like carbonaceus chondrite meteoric
material. Plus bits or rock and other things.  And these snowballs will
be tens to hundreds of kilometers in diameter.

It\'ll be *real* easy to extract hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and
many other things useful for ship fuel or life support from these. And
even the small ones will supply fuel and other consumables for *decades*
of heavy use.

This may be a good reason for carrying fuel purification plants. If you
mis-jump into an "empty" hex, you have a fair chance of locating
something useful if you stretch your sensors to the limit and use
manuever fuel (and low berths) carefully. In CT or MT, scratch the bit
about manuever fuel. :-)

Also, once found, relocating them would be easy. Especially if you
plant a good beacon. I\'m willing to bet that pirates and
revolutionaries would find these ideal hideouts.

I\'d also be willing to bet that a number of such "bases" whether
illegal, or just "company secret" might survive the Virus, because
they\'d have long practice in "I\'m not here" tactics. If a ship jumps in
and doesn\'t give the right codes, they won\'t broadcast anything to it.
And if it acts "wrong" it\'ll be considered an enemy and dealt with. If
it\'s merely a misjumped ship, well, accidents happen.

This could explain the survival of groups of merchant ships. The
locations and codes wouldn\'t be entered into the ship\'s computers so as
to prevent them being found by the law or by competitors. Likewise, log
entries would be faked to make it seem like the ship had made one jump,
not two (or more) small jumps. So the virus might never find out about
them.

Yes. :)  The people in the room breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon
dioxide (well, some anyway; as anyone trained in CPR knows, a fair amount
of oxygen goes out too.)  Eventually, the oxygen partial pressure in the
chamber falls in favor of the carbon dioxide, until not enough oxygen is
left in the room for the occupants to continue respiration.  How big is
the room?

If you\'re really interested in this, check out old submarine stories --
WWII-era and prior submarine crews were *vitally* concerned with this 
question.  The old "diesel" boats equipped with the German schnorkel
could run their motors underwater, and ventilate with outside air, but
carbon *monoxide* fumes still could cause problems.  A lot of research
was done on both, from what I understand.  Nowadays, nuclear subs have
enough power to spare for "scrubbing" systems that this isn\'t the same
sort of problem.

As for the question about the pure oxygen environment, I\'ll leave that
to the Apollo 1 experts in the crowd.  Actually, come to think of it,
carbon dioxide build-up was an important hurdle for the disastrous  
Apollo 13 mission as well.

The battalions were grav-mobile, and had about the same bombardment factor
as a BatRon (but not same defense/offense).  Earth also had three corps-
level PD emplacements, non-mobile, one identified with each starport on
the chit.  Those had the highest bombardment in the game and a sizable
defense garrison.  Are you speaking from tactical experience?

Humans are used to breathing area that is 80% N2, 20% O2. The air
pressure they breathe it at is 14.7 lbs/in^2. The partial pressure of O2
is about 0.20 * 14.7 lbs/in^2, or about 2.9 lbs/in^2. This is the
theoretical minimum air pressure that humans can sustain while still
being able to get adequate oxygen supply to their cells. The practical
minimum air pressure, however, tends to be higher than this -- for one
thing, altitude sickness may set in at this low a pressure (bodily
fluids filling up the lungs). Also, pure O2 is only wise for short
periods as it tends to oxidize the linings of one\'s lungs. I believe
that astronaut\'s space suits have them running about at 4-5 lbs/in^2,
and the cabins of early space craft at around 6-7 lbs/in^2.

I think the shuttle uses a O2/N2 mix that approximates earth atmosphere
at sea level. All that inert N2 adds a lot of weight but makes the
astronauts much more comfortable.

        There has been some debate over alternate materials over in 
Rec.guns, particularly about stuff like the \'plastic\' gun depicted in the 
movie "In the Line of Fire\'.  For those who haven\'t seen it (and don\'t 
mind a spoiler;-) the bad guy, an expert in making plastic and 
composite materials (among other things) makes a simple two shot 
pistol that would pass through a metal detector.  Opinions varied, but 
given current tech levels on Earth (8-10 or whatever) such a gun is 
quite possible.  Also, remember the infamous Glock \'plastic\' pistol of 
several years back.  It was mostly made from non-metallic 
components.  The company has since increased the percentage of 
ferrous metal components, but at the time it was quite revolutionary in 
design.  Similarly, ceramic materials of sufficient toughness and 
durability exist to make the hard part of firearms today; what lacks is 
the economic incentive to make them.  Steel is cheap, and will 
probably continue to be cheap for some time to come.  There are 
other considerations to making guns lighter, too.  As long as we\'re 
using guns that recoil, a lighter gun is not neccessarily better.  Since 
perceived recoil is very dependent on the mass of the gun, a light gun 
has more perceived recoil, and a much greater effect on the accuracy 
of that second shot.  A Marlin .44 mag carbine has much less 
perceived recoil than a .44 mag snub revolver, and is much more 
accurate. Weight also affects the first shot accuracy as well.  A 
heavier gun requires more effort to move it, so small motions are 
less likely to upset the aim once it\'s established.. 

        Therefore the only time that non-metallic components will be 
used, in firearms, or anything else, for that matter, is when they 
impart a greater advantage over more conventional materials.  This is 
pretty much a standard dictum of manufacturing design.  Carbon fiber 
composite materials are pretty much state of the art stuff, as 
materials go, but they\'re commonly used in fishing rods, because 
they\'re so much better that other alternatives (performance-wise) that 
they make economic sense, oce you\'re tooled up to make them in 
quantity.  OTOH, the same carbon fiber technology is usable to make 
bicycle frames, but since the margin of performance gain is so much 
smaller over the best of more common materials, they\'re only used in 
very high performance (read ungodly expensive) applications.

        The same applies to caseless ammunition.  Caseless 
ammunition is in common use today...it\'s used for the 20 and 30 mm 
cannons used in fighter aircraft like the US F-16, and others (I don\'t 
know any others off hand)  These give a huge advantage over 
conventional cased ammo.  You lose the weight of the shells, and so 
can carry more ammo, and you don\'t have to store the shells after 
firing them.  (a great problem with cased is that when ejected from a 
highspeed aircraft during dogfight maneuvers, they can easily cause 
great damage to the aircraft firing them)  So, in one sense, we\'re (at 
tech 8 or 10, whatever we are) already capable of caseless ammo. 
Similarly, there have been experimental hand weapons made that 
use caseless ammunition for a few years now.  This has other 
problems, namely durability, and safety.  Coventional cased 
ammunition can be dropped, ground into the dirt, carried through mud, 
dunked in streams, rattle around in a pocket for years, and still work.  
Such durability hasn\'t been verified for the caseless ammunition 
avaliable today.  It will become practical, when A) it does prove as 
durable and useful as conventional ammunition, and B) it is 
sufficiently cheap that is is cost effective to switch, which involves a 
weapon redesign.  The latter probably won\'t happen until a 
government or two, large ones, decide that this is the new standard, 
and order it for their armies. Then, thanks to the economies of scale, 
caseless becomes cheaper and more avaliable than cased, and will 
probably start to supplant it.

        This long winded explanation of something tha would be easily 
answered by going to my books (or my campaign, where to simplify 
things, all commonly avaliable guns are caseless, and come in two 
calibers) is to point out what I percieve as a great problem of the 
\'granularity\' of the Tech level scale.  As someone has pointed out, 
Earth today is a low tech level, but only because we don\'t have 
interstellar flight.  Since the tech level is based on broad classes of 
technology, I don\'t think it\'s applicable to very minute detail, so the 
question of \'when is caseless ammunition avaliable\' is really moot.  
It\'s avaliable when it\'s needed and economically viable.  We had 
\'caseless\' ammunition over a hundred and fifty years ago, when 
paper cased cartriges for muzzleloading rifles were in common use; 
what tech level were we in 1800?

It depends on the volume of the room and how many folks are trying to
breathe.  Of course, I don\'t know *how* it depends (i.e. minutes per
liter of air per person).  It also depends on the pressure and percentage
of oxygen.  The greater the pressure and/or oxygen concentration (and
the fewer the people) the longer you can survive.

It\'s lack of oxygen, unless impurities are also being introduced.  The
human waste product, carbon dioxide, isn\'t harmful.

The explosive hazard is a product of oxygen concentration not pressure.
The higher the concentration, at any pressure, the greater the risk.
The confusion comes from the fact that higher concentrations permit the
air to be `breatheable\' at lower pressures.  Thus, early US spacecraft
used all-oxygen atmospheres at lower pressure (some chemistry folks or
divers can probably explain the partial-pressure thing) because the
craft pressure vessel didn\'t need to be as strong if the internal pressure
was lower.  The capsule fire in Apollo I on the launch pad changed all
that.  Since then, US spacecraft have taken the weight hit and used 
stronger crew pressure vessels in order to keep the oxygen concentration
closer to what it is in `normal\' atmosphere.

> - -   how long before a typical human unfortunate dies from bad air in this

A 100% concentration of oxygen at the same pressure as `air\' (~20% oxygen)
would permit you to breathe about five times longer but you would probably
only use a 100% oxygen environment at lower pressure (in order to gain the
stength/weight savings of the early US spacecraft).  At 20% of atmospheric
pressure (or thereabouts) you wouldn\'t live any longer in a 100% oxygen
environment than you would in a 20% oxygen atmosphere at standard pressure.
Below 20% of atmospheric pressure you\'d having trouble breathing even in
a 100% oxygen environment.

There isn\'t really a simple answer to your question.  Me, I\'d just wing
it.  Either they get out in time, or they don\'t.  :-)

    I was initially for the idea of a pre-Virus list...  because I was
    hoping that all those discussions about the Imperial background,
    equipment, places, amber zones, etc.  would come back.  I don\'t
    give 0.02 credits for the RCES, and the only use I have for the
    Regency stuff is for filling in holes in the c. 1112 Domain of
    Deneb area.  The Earth Colonies stuff is fascinating, but I\'m not
    sure yet what I\'ll do with it.

    ...but a pre-Virus TML is pointless if nobody posts on it.  I
    think David has a point; is anyone still interested in DISCUSSING
    the era besides me?  I have stuff I could have posted, but I
    sensed an underwhelming amount of interest in pre-Virus material
    -- all the posts were about TNE gun designs, Regency politics,
    RCES politics, etc, etc, etc.  I once issued an appeal for TNE
    ship designs from the TML\'s famous ship designers (that\'s you,
    Scott and Robert!), and saw nothing posted in return.

    I say pre-Virus list, because like someone else here, I like the
    TNE rules, but despise the background.  I\'d like to be able to
    discuss Pre-Virus and alternate history backgrounds, but using TNE
    rules,too.  Am I just whistling Dixie?  Or is there a chance of
    this happening?

    'body' => 'There have been a number of postings of late about Imperial military
structure; especially in the Regency.  I have been running CT/MT/TNE
campaigns for more than 10 years, and I have always had a problem with 
GDW\'s ideas on Imperial military structure.  While GDW\'s structure is
fairly straightforward, they forgot just how big and feudal the Imperium is
(was/will be).

In my campaigns, the main military arm of the Imperium is the Imperial Navy.
The Marines are part of the Navy, just as in the United States.  The 
Imperial Army does not normally exist, except as Army-level HQ and support
units stationed at convenient locations.  

The Navy has three levels to it; Imperial Navy, Imperial Navy Reserve and
Colonial Navy.  The IN is the regular active force.  The INR consists of
recent retirees and Depot-stored excess ships, and includes training
units and ships at various IN bases.  It would also include support ships and
large transports for Imperial Army movement. The Colonial Navy is an ad hoc
force made up of starships from the navies of Imperial member states.
Such units would tend to be mainly patrol or escort vessels; few worlds
need or can afford dreadnaughts.  Each sector has a single fleet, with one
group per subsector (each with 1 or more squadrons).  Each sector also has
one reserve fleet, which can be bolstered with Colonial forces during a
declared emergency.  These units would be organized into planetary squadrons,
or composite squadrons for worlds with only a few ships.

The Marines are the regular ground forces.  There are Fleet Marines assigned to
ships as security or drop troops, Garrison Marines assigned to guard
Imperial facilities, and Line Marines assigned as additional units.  These
forces are used for fast response, and are the ground force normally used.
If drop troops attached directly to Groups are not sufficient, the fleet has
access to Line Marine units carried in bulk transports.  In general, a 1000
ship Sector Fleet would have a full corps of Line Marines available, as well
as several Marine Landing Brigades (Drop Marine brigades) in the fleet,
and at least 1 Marine Landing Force (Drop Marine battalion) per subsector
Group.

If more ground force is needed (an extended occupation) the Imperial Army
would come into play.  Units would be activated from the armies of
Imperial member states.  They would be combined with units of compatable
Tech Level to form divisions, corps and armies under Imperial Army control.
The IA would supply high-tech command and support units, and INR transports
would carry the forces into battle.

The justification for this is largely economic.  It is expensive to maintain
a full-time army.  The Imperium has a proven need for a Navy and for quick
reaction ground forces carried by the Navy, but a full-time Army is a 
needless drain on resources.  Why not use the armies of the member worlds,
much like a feudal levy (except better trained and equipped). 

Just some thoughts... any sort of input is welcome.  I have done a lot
with deep-space stations too, so maybe I\'ll throw my weight into that
discussion next time.  As regards the TNE/CT controversy, I find the 
new background OK, but I would like a Regency/Imperium sourcebook 
someday.  I am fairly pleased with the rules, except for starship combat.
I\'m lazy, so I like the cheesy simplicity of CT starship combat or the 
abstract comfort of High Guard.

None of this reflects the views of my employers (who would probably
like MT starship combat better anyway).

The following news briefs appeared in *Melbourne Times* #2:

Melbourne Times News Service

Anokye/Pollux (1419.16 B848689-B) 21 Apr 3001
 In its official report released today, the Navy confirmed that the
unidentified ship destroyed at Epimetheus/Pollux three weeks ago by the frigate
Foch was an Aztlan Maza-class escort.
 According to the report, the Foch was conducting frontier refuelling shortly
after emerging from jump when it encountered the unidentified ship in the upper
reaches of the gas giant\'s atmosphere.  When it refused to respond to the
Foch\'s hail, the ship was fired upon and eventually destroyed.
 Initial efforts to identify the ship were hindered by the loss of the
wreckage in the giant\'s lower atmosphere.  The report states that the ship was
identified after an analysis of telemetry gathered by the Foch during the
engagement.
 A spokesperson for Commodore Geraldine Kolchak declined to comment on the
report, but sources close to the Commodore stated that the discovery of an
Aztlan warship in Commonwealth space was certain to lead to further escalation
of tensions in the Pollux subsector.

Dedn/Europa (2934.30 AA6A865-D) 24 Apr 3001
 In a terse communique released today, the mysterious Committee for State
Security announced that it had assumed all executive authority in the Meren
Worlds.
 Actual composition of the Committee remains unclear.  The Committee has been
rumored to be an extension of the reactionary wing of the Expansionist Clique,
which has suffered from increasing turmoil since the end of the Markets War.
 The status and location of Morrochai Gvo remains unknown.  The communique
stated that the Meren Autarch had been "relieved of its responsibilities" by
the Committee.
 In a separate statement, Ivondond Verch, leader of the Reformist Clique and a
frequent critic of the Autarch in the past, called for Morrochai\'s restoration
to its "appropriate and lawful position" and characterized the action of the
Committee for State Security as a "supra-legal usurpation of executive
authority".

New Canaan/Gaea (2215.10 A865999-D) 27 Apr 3001
 The New Lhasa Skystupa fell to the ground today.
 The gravitic spiritual and entertainment complex slowly descended from its
aerial position 800 meters above the city after its main gravitic generator
shut down.  A Skystupa spokesperson stressed that it had been a controlled
descent and that the Skystupa\'s 860,000 inhabitants were never in danger.
 The cause of the generator failure has yet to be determined.  The
spokesperson stated that Skystupa engineers hoped to have the complex airborne
again within a few days.
 The New Lhasa Skystupa is the first gravitic urban complex developed on New
Canaan.  The effect of the generator failure upon additional Skystupas
currently under construction at New Medina and New Istanbul remains unclear.

Aztlan/Procyon (0911.20 A9879A7-D) 28 Apr 3001
 The Imperial Household announced the engagement today of Crown Princess Sola.
The heir to the Adamant Throne will wed Don Arturo Kumate, an officer in the
Diplomatic Corps.
 The Crown Princess, currently serving as an auxiliary craft pilot in the
Imperial Navy, had long shown little interest in marriage.  Sources in the
Household have denied reports that the Crown Princess was pressured into the
engagement by Empress Ana and Grand Duke Guillermo.
 Don Arturo first met the Crown Princess nearly 18 months ago during a
reception held for her by the Ehime monarch at the Ehime embassy.  Don Arturo
has served as Her Majesty\'s ambassador to the Ehime court for the past three
years.
 The wedding, in accordance with Imperial tradition, has been scheduled to
coincide with the annual Festival of the Founders to be held later this year. 

Earth/Sirius (1720.19 A867988-D) 01 May 3001
 Earthsteward Emile Cevera opened year-long ceremonies today celebrating the
Tricentennial of the founding of the Commonwealth of Earth.
 "As we cross this threshold of our fourth century, we reach forward to the
myriad of opportunities that beckon to us," said Cevera in remarks carried live
across the globe.
 The Commonwealth Tricentennial will be celebrated in a variety of events over
the next year throughout the worlds of the Commonwealth.  The celebration will
climax with the Commonwealth Games to be held here at Earth.

Nyanza/Nyanza (1531.12 A86898A-D) 03 May 3001
 The Nyanzan Subsector factor for Ysinal udi-Quinan announced today that the
Aeroi mercantile giant had reached an agreement with the Nyanzan Navy to
provide armed escorts for YuQ shipping operations in Nyanza, Wanganui, Aquila
and Ourora subsectors.
 The three-year contract includes provisions for piracy suppression as well as
escort duties.  Representatives of the Federation Navy declined to discuss the
actual price of the contract.  Analysts at the Nyanza Securities Exchange
estimated the amount to be in the gigacredit range.  Ysinal udi-Quinan stock
had risen 5.625 points by the close of trading today.
 A spokesperson for the Ouroran embassy criticized the joint Aeroi-Nyanzan
effort as an "unnecessary and provocative escalation" of the recent trade
tensions in the region.

Amazonas/Ourora (1934.24 A766955-D) 12 May 3001
 House Moreira officially closed the Mendes Highport today.  The closing
coincided with opening ceremonies for the new Amazonas Highport which has been
operational for several months now.
 The Mendes Highport was constructed around the hull of the Conestoga-class
sub-light transport Chico Mendes which brought the original settlers from Earth
over five hundred years ago.  The ship served as an orbital base of operations
for the initial colonization of Amazonas.  Over the centuries the orbital
facility has grown into a sprawling shipyard complex that served as Amazonas\'
primary Highport.
 The new Highport was constructed by Moreira after it determined that further
upgrades to the Mendes facility were impractical.  Moreira officials have
described the new Highport as the "centerpiece of commercial infrastructure" in
the Community.
 The Mendes facility will be stripped down and the Chico Mendes hull
refurbished in time for the sexacentennial of the settling of Amazonas.

The following Sophont Brief on the Aeroi first appeared in *Melbourne
Times* #2.

The Aeroi were the first extraterrestrial race encountered by Terrans.  Aeroi
civilization is apparently not much older than Terran although the Aeroi did
achieve jump drive, with its subsequent interstellar expansion, several hundred
years prior to any Terran state.  In a sense, because it was an Aeroi ship that
first discovered a Terran settlement, the Aeroi actually \'encountered\' Terrans.

Physiology: The Aeroi are descended from arboreal, air-breathing grazer stock. 
A typical Aeroi measures 1.2 meters in height and masses about 35 kilograms. 
Aeroi are able to \'stand\' to a height of approximately 1.6 meters and their
\'wingspan\' measures nearly 2.6 meters.  Their coloring tends to be a variety of
shades from pale yellow through a deep orange.  They are hairless but their
tough skin provides good protection.  Aeroi are exceptionally agile both on the
ground, their primary environment, and in the air.  Aeroi flight capability is
limited primarily to gliding although actual \'powered\' flight is possible under
certain conditions (dense atmospheres, lower gravity).  Aeroi are limited to
speeds of 20 kph on the ground but have been known to approach 100 kph in
flight.

There are two Aeroi sexes with physical differences limited to the sexual
organs.  Aeroi young are born after a gestation period of six months encased in
a hard-shelled envelope somewhat similar to the eggs of Terran avians. 
Multiple births are extremely rare.  The young are \'hatched\' from this envelope
after a period of two months.  Females were originally responsible for the
envelope-stage young while males generally cared for the hatchlings.  These
traditional roles have become obsolete with the rise of technological
civilization.

Aeroi reach sexual maturity in their early twenties at which point they
generally leave their parents\' care.  Aeroi bond in exclusive female-male pairs
although these pairs seldom last beyond the period required for child rearing. 
Both Aeroi females and males remain fertile into their early fifties.  Life
expectancy commonly exceeds 120 years.

Aeroi posses exceptional visual (extending into the infrared range), auditory
(extending beyond Human high-frequency ranges) and taste senses but have no
olfactory organs.  A pair of eyes are located at the front of the head, as
is the mouth.  An ear is located on both sides of the head.  Breathing
orifices are located in this region as well.  Tactile senses are somewhat
limited due to the protective nature of the epidermal layer.

Aeroi manipulative appendages, which hang from the lower portion of the
abdomen, are highly agile and posses generally higher strength than those of
Humans.  The \'wing\' appendages also terminate in manipulative members although
these possess less strength.Their \'wings\' are also quite agile - giving them
great maneuverability in the air despite being limited to gliding flight most
of the time.  Aeroi utilize the \'wing\' appendages for ambulation and are also
quite mobile on the ground.

Aeroi speech organs are able to produce most Human sounds and both Dolphin and
Human speech is well within range of Aeroi hearing.  Much of Aeroi speech
though, occurs beyond the range of Human hearing but not of Dolphin hearing. 
This allows Aeroi to communicate to Humans if necessary but also allows
protected communication in the presence of Humans.

History: Aeroi sentience is attributed to changing environmental factors that
lead to decreasing food supplies for early Aeroi groups.  The gradual decline
in available vegetation lead to the need for increased cooperation among
far-ranging Aeroi groups in locating sources of food.  Family bonds dominated
most groups with numbers ranging from 12 to 30 individuals.  As the
environmental conditions continued to worsen, the need for manipulation of the
environment lead provided a further impetus for intellectual development.

The deteriorating environmental conditions led to increased conflict among
early Aeroi groups.  The scarce grazing areas though also served to maintain
great physical distances between groups.  Conflict became more \'strategic\' in
nature and was focused on migration and grazing patterns rather than actual
confrontation between groups.  Records of violence between Aeroi groups does
not survive in the historical record.

Eventually, groups learned that conflict could be managed.  Cooperation, in the
form of mutually beneficial arrangements, became increasingly common.  Conflict
still exists but takes the form of competition in the formulation of
arrangements.

Aeroi groups grew into clan or tribal organizations but mobility remained
important.  Even though technological advancement and improved environmental
manipulation have decreased the need for mobility it remains quite important in
the Aeroi psyche.  These \'tribal\' affiliations also remain quite strong.
The advent of technological civilization led to increasing mobility in the
search for resources and to competition among tribal groups.  This served as a
primary driver in the Aeroi move off-world and, with the discovery of jump
drive, into interstellar space.

The first record of Aeroi contact with Terrans is with worlds settled from the
Ehime Prefecture late in the 29th Century.  Since that time Aeroi economic
interests have expanded through most of the Colonies Sphere.  Until recently,
much of this period was characterized by intense economic conflict with the
Meren.

Psychology: The Aeroi are highly individualistic but are also strongly
influenced by tribal bonds.  Competition among tribal groups is almost
instinctual and the importance of individual contributions to this conflict is
widely recognized.  Aeroi can be ruthless to those outside their own tribal
group but are exceptionally compassionate to tribal members.

While the Aeroi seem to thrive on conflict they find violence as abhorrent. 
This is not so much a revulsion toward violence as it is a recognition of
violence as being blunt and inefficient tool.  In a sense, Aeroi see violence
as \'beneath\' them.

Aeroi see conflict and competition as natural methods of providing improvement
and innovation.  The idea of cooperation in an environment free from
competition is completely alien to the Aeroi.

To a certain extent, the Aeroi see outsiders as natural.  Aeroi tribal groups
have always seen each other as outsiders.  While this has prevented a cohesive
racial attitude from developing it has provided the Aeroi with an advantage in
dealing with non-Aeroi sophonts.  They see non-Aeroi as no more \'alien\' than
other Aeroi tribes.

Society: In modern society, Aeroi tribal groups are generally organized around
some sort of commercial enterprise.  These groups are often insular and because
of this highly diversified in their activities.  The Aeroi respect for the
individual leads to a great deal of tolerance for diversity within the group.

Each tribal group provides its own governmental structures.  In this sense
there is no Aeroi government per se.  Instead a variety of organizations, all
of them Aeroi, compete in a broad range of activities.  One might even say that
there is no Aeroi society, but rather a collection of Aeroi societies.

Aeroi tribal entities are almost exclusively commercial ventures.  These
entities are fierce economic competitors both among themselves and with
non-Aeroi groups.  The Aeroi seem to have some difficulty interpreting the role
of Terran governmental entities.  For this reason the boundaries between
economic and political competition are often blurred from the perspective of
Terrans.

The Aeroi distaste for violence is apparent in that Aeroi military and security
organizations are almost exclusively staffed by non-Aeroi.  In general, Aeroi
military forces tend to be small and conflicts limited.  The Aeroi prefer, and
are usually able, to resolve conflicts by non-military means.

[Rest of the table omitted.]

Ooops!  Guess that was a lot of information to digest at one time.  The
first problem is that the headers for my table aren\'t as clear as they
could be.  A better header might read like this:

Hex_Location   World_Name/Subsector_Name (Allegiance)   Distance (pc)

Thus, for example, the world Issyk Kul, located in hex 1620.20 in the
Procyon Subsector, is a member of the Commonwealth of Earth (Co) and
is one parsec away from Earth.

In the Earth Colonies campaign many subsectors are named for
their brightest star.  In this Jump Destinations Table for Earth/Sirius
(that is, the world Earth in the Sirius subsector), Procyon,
Fomalhaut, Pollux, Sirius and Vega all refer to *subsectors* rather
than to the stars themselves.  Following the Traveller convention the
*system* name is omitted and the main world name is used with the subsector
name instead.  Thus, the star names from the 2300AD Near Star List do
not appear in the world/subsector names in the Earth Colonies campaign.
For example, in the example above, the world of Issyk Kul is actually
located in the Alpha Centauri system but appears on star charts and the
like as Issyk Kul/Procyon.

The 2300AD Near Star data lists Cartesian (xyz) coordinates in lightyears
(cyr) for the star systems.  These coordinates were converted to parsecs
(pc) and overlayed onto a three-dimensional sector hex map (basically a
`stack\' of 36 standard Traveller 2D sector maps to add `depth\') centered
on the Sol system (Earth) located at hex 1720.19 (again the conventional
1720 sector hex location but at a `depth\' of 19 pc in the `stack\').

A Jump Destinations Table like this one for Earth is developed by a
world developer so that jump distances don\'t have to be continually
calculated for that particular world using the Cartesian formula.  These
calculations *can* be made though for any two worlds in a sector if their
hex locations are known.  For example, Issyk Kul, at hex 1620.20, is one
parsec from Earth, at hex 1720.19 as follows:

SQRT [ (16-17)^2 + (20-20)^2 + (20-19)^2 ] = SQRT [ (-1)^2 + (0)^2 + (1)^2 ]

= SQRT [ 1 + 0 + 1 ] = SQRT [2] = 1.4 which rounds to 1

Hope that makes the 3D Earth Colonies Sphere a little clearer.

"In argument, truth is discovered."
                 -Russian proverb

I think we\'re beginning to discover some truth about the Sword Worlds.

From Sunday night, Hans Rancke <rancke@diku.dk> writes:

No, I get your point, I just don\'t see any `facts\' that support these cycles.
What is it about the technological disparities between worlds that suggests
these cycles?  I understand that you\'re saying that without things cycling
up and down there ought to be no disparities - every world would be TL 15.
Why does this have to be the case?  While it\'s clear that technological
knowledge ought to be equivalent throughout `known space\' there is nothing
to suggest that economic development is constant as well.  It might
be that lower tech worlds just haven\'t `grown\' to higher technological
accomplishment yet - like on contemporary Earth.  Why the need to propose
these mysterious `techno-economic cycles\'?

I\'m not sure this is really relevant to our discussion but I\'m not sure
I agree with this idea.  A TL 6 mechanic is going to have problems fixing
the electronic-fuel-injection in my TL 8 car just as a TL 6 computeroid
is going to have difficulties trying to replace the vacuum tubes in my PC.
A TL 4 electrician won\'t have a clue how to fix the CRT on my TL 5 TV.
Of course, you\'re going to say she can because her world was at TL 8 when
she went to trade school two decades ago.  :-)

If the 5FW counters `prove\' that there are truly disparate TLs in the
Sword Worlds doesn\'t that lend credence to the idea that disparate TLs
are due to disparate techno-economic *development* rather than `cycles\'?
And won\'t that, in turn, generally call for Sacnoth to be the dominant
world unless Gram is receiving outside help?

I agree.  Someone *please* dig out those *5FW* counters!

If there is true techno-economic disparity in the Sword Worlds then Sacnoth
can dominate *economically* - like Japan does today - and it doesn\'t *need*
a confrontation.  (But a little `demonstration\' might not hurt!)

Really?  How so?

I just checked the *JTAS* Contact article again.  It merely describes the
original Sword Worlds settlers as `Solomani exiles\'.  There is no mention
of *any* warfare.  The time is the c-400.  I\'m not sure when the Interstellar
Wars occurred.

Doesn\'t different levels of `techno-economic development\' explain the
disparate TLs as well?  This *is* how it works today!  Why the need for
something different?  Maybe `techno-economic development\' is really what
TL is measuring.

Because these are the only four that have achieved that level of `techno-
ecomomic development\'?

But this isn\'t what *you\'ve* proposed!  If Sacnoth is selling its high-tech
goods to all the other Sword Worlds then the technocracy can\'t stop at the
individual worlds because the economy doesn\'t!  This is the nature of a
feudal technocracy - the poltical situation is tied directly to the economic
situation.  If the economy is interstellar then political power in inter-
stellar and the center of power out to be the strongest technocracy - Sacnoth.
Unless there is outside influence like the Zhodani.  Again, quoting the *JTAS*
Contact article:

"A Confederation Council, made up of representatives from all worlds,
regulates interworld trade, handles diplomatic relations with outside powers,
and adjudicates interworld disputes."

Sounds like the Japanese *keiritsu* to me.

> as a 50ties redneck thought of russians.

No, I don\'t.  I have no idea how deep this sentiment is.  Remember, I suggested
that this `sentiment\' might not exist anywhere except in the mind of Imperial
propagandists.  Here\'s the quote from the *JTAS* Contact article:

"This public prejudice against psionics has been the major element in limiting
Zhodani influence in the region."

Well, fine, but I\'m merely trying to provide some data for your 10-to-1
question.

Actually, with the benefit of historical observation there are very few
incidents where any `unlikely\' victory can not be explained.  We share this
`historical viewpoint\' as `developers\' of the Sword Worlds.

> Perhaps the anti-Zhodani sentiment was strong on Sacnoth but weak on Gram
> 300 years ago.

Well, again, maybe.  Another interesting fact from the *JTAS* Contact article:
the only Psionics Institute in the Sword Worlds is on Sacnoth!  Which is
listed as a "third factor (and in may ways the most significant)" why psionics
have not been made an integral part of Sword Worlds culture because "the
omnipresent interworld rivalry reinforces the latent anti-psi prejucice
among the inhabitants (and governments) of those worlds not politically
dominated by Sacnoth."

> Nowadays they _do_ have a politically stable Confederation.

Doesn\'t sound like it from the above quote.

I was thinking more along the line of a `mini-pacification campaign\'.

The geo-political reason is called `spheres of influence\'.  Examples are
the US in Vietnam and the Soviets in Afghanistan.  The Sword Worlds are
removed from the Consulate yet are situated on the Imperial border.

I wasn\'t trying to explain the SW incursions.  I was trying to explain the
lack of an Imperial pacification campaign.

They haven\'t `stopped\' it - it keeps occurring!

I merely saw `decades\' as analogous to centuries when comparing a millenia-
old empire to a two-century-old nation.  I feel the Sword Worlds *have*
been a bother and that the Imperium *hasn\'t* taken *decisive* action. A
pacification campaign is decisive and consistent with past Imperial actions.

> Very propably. Or perhaps it\'s a "Real Men don\'t need psionics!" thing.

This is what the *JTAS* Contact article suggests.  My suggestion is that
that entire `real man\' schtick for the Sword Worlds is all just a bunch
of Imperial propaganda.  I suspect the Sword Worlders are no more 
`paternalistic, macho, vain, braggarts\' than Zhodani are `mind-sucking,
inhuman totalitarians\' once the veneer of Imperial propaganda is removed.

> Depends on the economic developements.

Not if the reason for Gram\'s leadership has been access to Zhodani aid.
In TNE one might suspect King Angus of Gram to be cherising his last cigar
and cursing his former patrons like Fidel.

> OK. So you think the Confederation is one huge Feudal Technocracy, right?

No, I think it is a bunch of planetary technocracies too.  *You* have suggested
there is a great deal of economic integration between these economies which,
in my understanding, calls for a broader interstellar technocracy as well.
In this view there are no `planetary kings\'.  There are just `CEOs\' that
see their influence and power spread across several worlds.  They don\'t have
a direct economic interest in things like diplomacy so they relegate it
to the Confederation Council.  But since economic power is political power
in a feudal technocracy then the strongest poltical power ought to be the
strongest economic power.  We both see this as Sacnoth.  You choose to see
mysterious cycles to explain Gram\'s leadership while I blame the Zhodani.

Who\'s assumptions better fit these facts?

Some more good work.

military worked.  Here\'s my two bits:

I disagree about the Imperial Army.  IMHO, they\'re a fairly important and
much under-noticed branch of the Imperial military.  The Marines may be
the shock troops and Rapid Deployment Force, but much of the day-to-day
scut work falls to the Army.  They pick up the jobs the other services
miss.  They are the "UN peace-keepers" that keep fighting on balkanized
member-worlds from getting out of hand.  They\'re the occupiers who help
maintain civil order in the former Solomani Sphere.  They\'re the planetary
Coast Guard, who perform search and rescue missions when necessary.
In areas of unrest, they\'re responsible for the defense of member-worlds
within the 1/10 diameter limit.  When necessary, they\'re the troops that
go in behind the Marines to secure the planetary foothold they\'ve made,
and follow it up with the type of force the marines aren\'t meant to deliver.
If there\'s a big public-works project to be done, the IA Corps of Engineers
are called in.  Note that at least seven of the eleven regiments of the
Imperial Guard were IA units, with the IISS and Marines providing one
each and a special formation of Aslan another.  (Note that these IA
forces under the General Staff staged the coup that unseated Styryx in
favor of Gavin.)

The IA is supported by the powerful, high-tech worlds, although recruiting
is universal.  Like the IN, Colonial Reserves and planetary or even
national armies are permitted...as long as certain unofficial but well
understood guidelines are followed.  In fairly safe regions of the realm,
they aren\'t very visible.  In the Marches and in the Solomani Rim, they
are a more common sight.

Note that the IA is a joint command, as mentioned in _Mercenary_.  It
isn\'t just the army, but also the aerospace force and wet navy.  The
idea is that the main mission is defense of individual worlds.  Because
of thise focus, levels above the individual world command are less
important in the IA than in, say, the IN, which is interested in the
defense of entire subsectors and sectors.  Furthermore, individual
units, while loyal to the Imperium as a whole, would typically be more
closely related to their host world than an IN command is, due to the
need for coordination between planetary government and the Imperial
defense forces.

The joint command system in the IA also means that, depending on the
mission and the composition of the troops, it is equally likely that 
one would see a Vice Marshal as a Major General, for instance, in an
overall command position.  Wet navy forces would tend not to be          
deployed as freely off-world as land or air forces, of course.

In terms of inter-service rivalry, notice that some of the peacetime
IA missions are broadly similar to missions that might be undertaken  
by IISS Contact & Liaison teams.  This sort of dove-tail overlap 
seems to be characteristic of the way the Imperium operated its\'
military forces.

On another note:

>I\'m lazy, so I like the cheesy simplicity of CT starship combat or the
>abstract comfort of High Guard.

Cheesy!  Heck, it was great, once you got past the trigonometry.  You
could play it with a handful of index cards, a calculator, some 
mimiatures, and enough flat space.  (Oh, I suppose a tape measure and
dice would be useful too....)  Portable, quick, clean rules.
Although owners of the 1977 rules might notice that ranges seem to have
increased just a bit in the modern era. :)  At least we\'re now using
the metric system.

we split the list?" angst there.  The big issue was over computer 
wargames vs. classic paper and cardboard games.  Usually a person 
prefered one over the other.  Instead of splitting the list they elected 
to use voluntary message headers.  On the subject line an article about 
computers would have the mssg "COMP:" This worked pretty well.  It would 
work for the TML as well IF each message was sent individually instead of 
in bundles.  I don\'t know if engrg@UWO.CA has the resources to do this 
though.  I sincerely believe that splitting the list is a bad idea.  I 
have a great deal of empathy for the CT/MT crowd.  I can understand the 
very justified sense of frustration that comes from spending hundreds of 
dollars and hundreds to thousands of hours learning about Lord high 
poo-poo and the land of the nobodies only to have it all become INVALID.  
I used to be this obsessed as well.  After a while I found that it was no 
fun though.  This is supposed to be a hobby.  We are supposed to be 
enjoying ourselves.  Splitting this list splits our community.  Everybody 
loses from this because instead of banding together we become separate.  
Already these separate groups are building their sense of self by 
identifying and attacking an "OTHER".  In our community the rift is over 
CT/MT vs. TNE.  This is almost as stupid as the conflict in the Russian 
Orthodox Church about whether to use three fingers or two when making the 
sign of the cross.  TNE has a very broad vision.  CT/MT fit within the 
scope of TNE.  The equipment has changed but it isn\'t 1978 either.  Our 
views of science have changed.  What is possible now wasn\'t possible 
then.  What seemed likely then, much like flying cars from the fifties, 
has proved to be more difficult than we imagined.  

With a change in technologies comes a change in social structures and 
politics.  This is a basic premise of science fiction.  By changing the 
equipment in Traveller GDW ***HAD*** to change the third Imperium.  The 
TML has provided nearly countless examples of how the new TNE rules 
change the way things work in a traveller campaign.  This really proves 
my point.  GDW had a choice.  Either they could leave Traveller alone or 
they could change it.  They chose to change it.  Once they began to 
change it they realized that the third Imperium made much less sense than 
before so either the changes had to go or the third Imperium had to.  GDW 
chose to dump the third Imperium.  This is a fact.  It can not be 
disputed.  They have offered the Regency as a replacement and this makes 
sense because most of GDW\'s developement is in the Spinward Marches.  
Opening traveller to other companies had the unanticipated affect of loss 
of control for GDW.  Imagine that as the referee in your campaign your 
players could change the fundamental realities of your campaign world.  
I\'m sure that GDW faced something like this and chose to reassert control 
of their campaign.  Thus we have TNE.

This has gone far afield and I apologise for its length 

Later I may continue and discuss how TNE opens new doors for SFRPG\'s and 
all of the "good" aspects of TNE.  Until then I wish to share my regrets 
that like any change the creation of TNE has resulted in the destruction 
of the third Imperium.  I never really like it but I used it.  I took the 
ideas in the the third Imperium and used them.  I took adventures from 
the black books and used them.  They were great adventures because they 
could stand alone from the third Imperium.  Sadly, this trend was not 
continued in MT and it is the main reason I lost interest at the time.

Speaking of ship designs,

Here is the Dakaar-class freighter, which was partially described
in _The Drenslaar Quest_ by W.H. Keith published by Gamelords.

While the Dakaars operate mostly in Reavers\' Deep, equivalent 
designs are likely common throughout Imperial space.


Dakkar-class freighters were built by Starstream Enterprises 
on Caledon (Tech Level 12) and were operated by Starstream, 
Dakaar Trading (a subsidiary of the Dakaar Corporation), the 
Aariskin Corporation of Ildrissar, and a number of other 
subsector- or larger sized shipping and trading concerns. 
These ships are designed primarily for surface-to-surface 
cargo transfer capability.  While they have no space dedicated to 
a ship\'s vehicle, most crews commonly carry an air/raft in the 
cargo hold.

The time depends on the size of the room, who is breathing, and
whether they are conserving their air.  Normally about 4% of
the air is converted from oxygen (O2) to carbon dioxide (CO2)
per lungful, but this may change as the ratio changes.

Normally there is 20-21% O2 in the air, humans need at least
half that to survive.

CO2 is poisonous, however.  I heard once that CO2 poisoning
would kill you before O2 deprivation would in this situation.
This may have only been under pressure, however.

There are easy ways to neutralize the CO2, however.  Divers
that use recycled air do this (supplementing with additional
O2).  There are also ways to convert it back to O2 (I think
submarines do this now).

Any room filled with O2 is a fire hazard.  The O2 doesn\'t
actually explode, but it promotes burning of anything else
in the room.  As the pressure increases, this effect will
increase, so that more and more becomes vulnerable, but...

The real hazard is that pure O2 is deadly at ANY kind of
pressure above 1 atmosphere.  Pure O2 will allow you to
breathe at a LOWER pressure, however.

>     scenario.

I don\'t think the CO2 poisoning effect would be diminished
(it might actually be worse, since there will be more O2 to
convert).  Therefore, no longer than before.

It\'s a bit complicated to determine exactly how long the
unfortunate has.  Partial pressures determine if the air
is breatheable and/or poisonous.  5% CO2 at 2 atmospheres
is as poisonous as 10% CO2 at 1.  Less O2 is also needed
at higher pressures, and even 20% O2 can become poisonous
if the pressure gets high enough.

As a rough rule of thumb, you could divide the volume of
air in the room by the volume of a lungful of air.  This
is how many lungfuls would convert 4% of the air from O2
to CO2 (alter this 4% number drastically based on activity
level--perhaps 1-10%?).  At one atmosphere, the air will
be unbreatheable when the O2 drops to 10% or the CO2 rises
to its toxicity level (whatever that is).

Increasing pressure would help prevent O2 deprivation
(assuming the O2 partial pressure doesn\'t reach toxic
levels), but it would not reduce the CO2 poisoning effect.

Actually Survival Margin should not be treated as Virus-infested by
CT/MT enthusiasts.  The majority of it is filled with TAS news regarding
events within the 3I (or at least the various factions) and should be of
direct use with rebellion-era campaigns.  Then there is the rules for
conversion of characters to TNE.

Another thought slowly crept into my gray matter recently.  Namely some
of the scenarios for use in the Star Vikings campaign could be used in a
rebellion era campaign.  Given the premise that as the Black War
continued the Imperial infrastructure began to break down leaving forces
of the factions with reduced assets and many of the worlds have
withdrawn from the interstellar community and may be more than a little
xenophobic.

Smash & Grab scenarios may be adapted by having forces of the factions
raid worlds for many of the same reasons RCs do: rescue prisoners,
capture  technology, overthrow gov\'ts to install one that favors their
faction.  As you mentioned ideas for scenarios can come from almost
anywhere - they just need the proper interpretation.

The idea of the NPC swap is great and Ill submit some of mine later today 
but one thing that can also be a challenge is coming up with original NPC 
names sometimes on the spot during a session and when preparing for it.  
To help alleviate that burden I would like to submit my names list that 
keep handy when Im a GM.  Perhaps someone has a similiar list they would 
like to share.  Note that many of these names will be familiar as they 
are taken from popular and obscure novels.  Some from the credit pages of 
well known Traveller pubs.

    'body' => 'I like Steve Charlton\'s Ideas on Imperial Marine/Army/Navy
organization, and want to fill it out a bit.

I\'ve had it in mind (and still am planning to) design some of the
major components of a Marine Expeditionary Division of the
Imperium.  Here\'s some design considerations;

Everything this division needs must be optimised to take up the
least amount of volume.  MBTs and APC with energy weapon armament,
a focus on energy-based support weapons would be the beginning to 
prevent a huge logistical need for shells/bullets.  Infantry weapons
would be similarly designed.  Actually I would probably equip with
4mm Gauss weapons because of the low signature (compared to energy
wpns) low noise, and since 4mm gauss ammo is relatively easy to
manufacture at any industrial world, and takes up a low amount of
space per round.  (manufacture one jump-2 away-much easier to transport
than some tech-14 ACR explosive or binary propellent ammo).

Actually there is a series of books, "Until Relieved" is one of
them, where a weapon (which I think was a gaus weapon) used wire
on spools as ammo, and had a cutting/straightening tool to seperate
the wire into individual rounds.  Not a bad idea.  (could that have
been one of the series by J. Andrew Keith?  The memory fades when you
hit 27.)

Space transport should be modular.  I envision a "Rodger Young" class
Company Assault Transport which would be deployable alone, in pairs,
or in hordes as a division.  I also thought there would be just a few
"Divisional Assault Transports", Which I want to build as a battle
rider, each rider holding one battalion of either combat or support
function.  This configuration allows planetwide coverage for orbital
fire (one ship would only be able to cover a portion of the planet
with orbital fire) and sensors.  It also reduces in-system vulnerability 
(not counting the tender, of course) of the division if there are still
space-bourne defenders (there should not be).

At one point I was thinking of an artillery vehicle with four 5-barrel rotary
mass drivers.  This would allow the equivalent of a platoon of artillery in 
one vehicle.  It would also increase vulnerability since one well-fired
missile takes out a platoon of artillery.  The other problem was that the 
MDs had to be 100mm (to fire submunitions and Remote Deployed Minefields)
and this created an enormous power requirement.  They do seem possible,
however, and I intend to design them as such.  The advantages of deploying
one vehicle in place of four is still greater than the disadvantages.

Imperial Marines are equipped with Tech 15 hardware whenever practical.
This should save space, make the expeditionary force superior in technology
to the majority of opponents, and prevent the full utilization of any 
captured equipment (since the enemy cannot maintain TL15 stuff on TL12 world,
in theory).  

The Marines are a combat organization.  Other functions are handled by other 
branches whenever practical.  For example, there\'s a (Marine) combat engineer
battalion attached to the division, but if additional engineers are 
needed in a given situation, borrow them from the regular army.  Logistics
is handled by Navy personnel until supplies reach the ground.  I would put
Air Superiority in Navy hands, but Close Air Support (when used) with
Marine pilots.  Likewise, there should be a Marine officer directing
orbital Fire Support (although the gunners are obviously Navy).

Ok, Now my questions.  How many combat battalions in an Imp. Marine
Division?  How many companies per battalion?  Platoons per company?
Troops per platoon?  Are companies combined arms? or are platoons?
Is artillery organic to the Battalion? or the company?

Translation of above;  What does the Table of Organization and Equipment
look like for a Marine Division?  I\'ve made some suggestions above, but am 
not familiar enough with military organization to know "what works"
and what doesn\'t.  What "monkey wrench" would get thrown into Marine
organization within the imperium?  Perhaps a few incompetent Noble
commanders?

Remeber that Marines are probably often deployed as companies, and should have
many of the divisional services provided at lower organizational levels
(A combat engineer squad?  I guess we could get carried away.)

was their choice. I still think that if everyone agreed to, we could just live
in peace with each other. For instance, I run an Imperium-based game using the
TNE rules. Ideas I might come up with that aren\'t strictly rules based would be
useful to anyone running in the Imperium, wouldn\'t they? And here\'s a weird
thought-is there anyone out there who LIKES the Virus-based TNE background,
but prefers to use MegaTraveller or Traveller to run it? I\'d be really inter-
ested in seeing ship designs etc. for something like that. Another idea: there
are some nifty things in FF&S that aren\'t in High Guard. How would you go about
"porting" these things backward so you could use them in the older version?
   I do agree that the constant fighting about TNE vs. CT vs MT has probably
hurt the list. I\'m willing to completely drop the subject under the following
condition:
      No more insulting remarks made about either TNE nor the people who
play it. You can say "I really don\'t like TNE" rather than "TNE bites and so
do you".
   I\'m a naturally defensive person and it really bugs me when people slam
something I enjoy. I\'ll try to control that, but all I ask is that others
try to control their vehement dislike of TNE and not be insulting.
  I\'d really prefer to get back to talking about Traveller. I\'d rather not
see the list split, not because I\'m afraid of losing my "audience" but because
I really do enjoy the diversity of subject matter and opinion that a larger
list allows for.

One of the things which makes SF for me is Non-Humans. Despite the number of
pre-generated non-human races in Traveller (Vargr, Droyne, Hivers, K\'kree, 
Aslan) there seems to be no establised method of rolling your own. Do the 
members of the list have any hints, tips or suggestions on how to create a 
believable non-human race, for use as either PCs or NPCs? Are there any 
favourites out there from the annals of Traveller history?

P.S. Has anyone else noticed the similarities between the RCES Marines as
portrayed in Smash & Grab and the MI from Heinlein\'s Starship Troopers?

P.P.S. Being a relative newcomer to the list, I would value the input of
those who chose to leave the list when TNE was launched, so I vote for
the \'temporary two lists\' idea. (I have CT, MT and TNE.)

high-tech electronic-money-rich world tumbled into chaos.

        Has somebody else thougth about this?

        Other things: I would switch to the Pre-TNE list and drop the
TML, personally.  I\'ve just downloaded 2.3 megs of old TML mail and
after some cleaning, I\'m down to about 600 k of data I actually care
about reading. :)
        Yes, I am trough whining about TNE... Say guys, how about TNE
Done Right? <ducking>

        Personally, I\'m a MT fan.  I\'ve been playing Traveller for
oh, about 10 years, but I had no access to background material for
the deluxe CT set I had.  MT had a rich, complex background... It was
a lot more interesting... So I\'ve been trying to learn everything
about the 3rd Imperium/Rebellion era since then, getting many
headaches in the meantime :).  I wouldn\'t want to drop everything for
TNE. :)

Ammel Brodrig                   Born, Arizona Dawn  Day 187,1160

I was born in the coastal city of Alameda on Arizona Dawn where I 
grew up with my two sisters.  My parents worked in the area.  My 
father was a ParaWIG drivers and my mother a computer builder.  They 
urged me to excel in school and other activities.  I was able to get a 
Federation Scholarship to the cosmonautical Academy on Prima.  After my 
four years there, I entered the fleet.  Through hard work and 
determination I was able to climb up through the ranks and after only 14 
years in the fleet I was on the verge of my own command.  Quite an 
accomplishment.  Then it happened.  The Icarus Incident.  I was the XO of 
the NeoSol Federation Destroyer Icarus, the CO was the son of some 
Council Senator.  We were doing a routine docking  with a civilian high 
port.  When docking was imminent, the CO inexplicably vented the Heplar 
thrusters into the docking area.  The surge and heat buckled the main 
door and the plasma exhaust superheated the air in the hangar deck 
causing an oxygen flash fire the moved through the entire wing of the 
high port.  518 people died and hundreds more were injured.  In the 
ensuing investigation the CO dissappeared from sight and questions about 
him were brutally repressed.  The most mysterious being that a post 
accident med exam revieled some sort of implant? in the CO\'s head.  I 
never knew what to make of this.  In any event I was the only one 
available to court martial.  They had to "hang" somebody, the CO was 
nowhere to be found so they chose me.  The navy will always protect 
itself, I learned and will make you look like a complete bozo to do so.  
Some called for my execution, in the end I was discharged to the colonial 
corps where I now run a system outpost in the system of Home.  Me and six 
other sad sacks and several dumb robots.  I think that I had my fill of 
this, youre going to get screwed anyway so you might as well have fun, I 
think I\'ll take Belle Starr up on that offer...I always wanted my own 
High Port.

help take care of them.  Even with Noel\'s talents, the Speculator grows 
long in the tooth....so Im looking for that big multiMCr deal...any

Well anyway, Im off to Alameda High Port to pick up some important

wouldnt be the first...the other turned out to be mistaken.

Ref: BJ is the ultimate speculative trader.  He tools around in a 100

Enope.  But does he really want that ranch?  Isnt it really the thrill of 
the deal that makes his heart beat!?....

They said it must never be allowed to happen again.  But when Union of 
Senled tanks rolled across the Great Plain into Nemo, no one lifted a 
finger to help a small defenseless nation.  Sure they talked but decided 
It was easier to let Union of Senled have their way.  Maybe theyll be 
satisfied with that, right?!?  Well it was my home they razed.  My 
parents they butchered and so I had to do something about it.  When that 
command ship blew up in the harbor I watched from shore...my handiwork 
having been responsible.  They eventually figured out what happened and 
who.  I was captured and due to be shot until a raid broke me out of 
prison and I ran to Enope.  I know that the Union of Senled has agents 
here on this planet.  I also know that there is a beedling vault on 
Aurigae, I just dont know where.  In a war zone there is little 
opportunity for careful archaeological surveys...what I do know is that 
vault may contain what we need to push the Senled out of our nation, or 
in the wrong hands...ensure Union of Senled domination of Aurigae.

Ref: Jana started off as farmer and studied biology and agriculture in 
tech school.  When Senled invaded her home country of Nemo she became a 
resistance fighter(or terrorist depending on your POV) and helped to sink 
a Union of Senled ship in Nemo\'s Landing Harbor.  She was captured and 
imprisoned but subsequently escaped in a Nemon raid in the facility.  She 
escaped to Enope where she met Ulysses Stark where he was then a local 
Constable.  They eventually married (covertly).

Subject: re: A pre-Virus/TNE list

First up:
- ----
Thanks to those who replied with useful tips on running out of air, and 
availability of non metallic guns. Much appreciated. I\'m still interested 
in more info on this if anyone has comments to make. This is one of the 
main reasons I find TML a useful thing to subscribe to: the helpful 
suggestions of others.

Re: A second Traveller List
- ----

I would prefer it if the list didn\'t have to split, but can cope if it 
does. My main worry (as some other posters have expressed) is that there 
may not be enough in the way of traffic on either list to keep them going 
if the list splits. Rather than debate it though I think we are just going 
to have to try it and see. 

I do think the idea of people posting Pre-TNE material to the TML is a good 
one though. It would demonstrate:
    
    (a) the amount of actual active support the separate list would get. 
    Though admittedly only from those who are still part of the TML: it 
    wouldn\'t show up those who left and who might come back - but will they 
    come back anyway? Do they know about what is being proposed, and has 
    someone asked them what their view is? 
    
    However, if there is enough support amongst -current- TML membership 
    then I think it is clear that the split has a good chance of working.
    
    (b) whether people actually found the \'signal to noise\' ratio still 
    poor to accept even after the amount of useful signal improves.

I agree. I like the new generation traveller rules. My current campaign is 
set pre_Rebellion, c 1107, but uses the new rules. 

What do people think of PRE_VIRUS rather than PRE_TNE? Would this be 
acceptable to the people who wanted PRE_TNE in the first place? For me, the 
important difference between CT, MT, and TNE is their respective 
backgrounds, much more than their rules.

I\'m still interested in -reading- it at least. And then maybe asking a few 
stupid questions after 8-). Please post so we can all find out what 
interest exists.

Steve then goes on with an excellent explanation of a workable, sensible
military structure for both naval and ground/planetary forces.

The question I have is just how is this different from the canonical
structure?  There are a few minor discrepancies (like subsector naval forces
organized into `groups\' rather than `numbered fleets\') but on the whole it
seems quite compatible with `official\' military organization.  Admittedly,
it\'s the first time I\'ve seen the Imperial Marines divided into Fleet,
Garrison and Line units but this is mere color.  The use of Imperial Army
forces only on an as-needed basis also seems to be consistent.  The
Imperium didn\'t rely upon mobile Imperial Army units to protect individual
worlds but instead left that to `indigineous defense battalions\' raised
by and restricted to individual worlds.  Imperial Army forces were raised
at roughly ten percent of these levels for `Imperial\' use.

My own take on the problem with Imperial military structure was the idea
of `separate\' planetary forces - aerospace and `wet navy\' forces - that
were distinct from the `ground\' planetary forces - the `army\'.  Since
distinctions between land/water/air/orbital transportation disappears
at Imperial tech levels (TL 13+?) it seems to me that military organiza-
tional distinctions should `disappear\' as well.  I find it hard to believe
that the Imperial Army and Marines are not equipped for combat on a 
waterworld or have to rely upon Naval or other aerospace forces for
close-air support, inter-theater transport and the like.

An Imperial Army (or Marine) unit should contain land, water, air and
orbital elements capable of dealing with combat situations in any planetary
environment.

In the Earth Colonies campaign, I\'ve dealt with this issue by abandoning the
traditional `army\' units types - infantry, cavalry, armor, etc. - for more
generic `planetary\' unit types as follows:

Anti-bombardment units consist of guns, missiles, screens or other forces
  intended to counter aerial or orbital bombardment.
Bombardment units consist of missiles, airborne bombers, ortillery or other
  forces that attack from a position removed from the battlefield.
Combat Platform units consist of battlefield weapons platforms such as armor,
  air combat, ground attack, sea attack or other forces.
Patrol Platform units consist of mobile weapons platforms used for land,
  air or sea patrol.
Platform Carrier units consist of mobile forces used to introduce Combat
  Platform units directly into remote battlefields.
Transport units consist of mobile forces used to transport other units
  between bases or battlefield rear areas.
Troop units consist of battlefield troop forces such as infantry, cavalry,
  jump troops, robotic troops or other forces.

In conventional military terms, anti-aircraft batteries and ballistic
missile defense (SDI/`Star Wars\') forces would be Anti-Bombardment units;
ballistic missile, air bomber and cruise missile forces would be Bombardment
units; fighter aircraft, tanks, and attack submarines would be Combat
Platform units; AWACS aircraft, reconnaissance satellites and some surface
vessels would be Patrol Platform units; aircraft carriers would be Platform
Carrier units; airlift and sealift forces would be Transport units; and
marine infantry and air cavalry forces would be Troop units.

The concept of the battalion as the basic military unit is maintained but
the idea of `battalion\' is broadened to described a particular collection
of combat forces regardless of whether the `battalion\' is actually a
`conventional\' collection of troops, a collection of combat aircraft,
a collection of submersibles, or whatever.

Me too.

A 1960\'s era Rand Corp. published study "Habitable Planets" covered this issue,
among others, in some detail.  It may be avaliable in large university
libraries, it was at my university.  It is recommended reading for anyone
interested in what type of planets humans could live on.  It has been over 5
years since I last checked it out and I can not recall any details but it
provides upper and lower limits of oxegen, atmos. pressure, temp etc.  

If anyone has easy access to a university library a short summary of its
conclusions would be beneficial to the mailing list.

Text item: Text_1

     I have for the past year played a mixed game of T:2300ad and MT.
     Mainly allowing some of the 2300ad races and at least the stutter warp
     drive into the MT game.

       My question/suggestion is can the Pentipods (who are bio -
     technologist) create a \'biological\' computer to run the new starships?
      In theroy it should be possible.  The qustion is: if one can be
     created how much volume would it consume and what amount life support
     will be required to maintain it?  Also at what point of complexity
     would the \'computer\' become selfaware?  I figure without a cybiline
     interface the computer would be immune to the silicon virus.  I have
     not neen able to find anything in either 2300ad or FF&S to offer any
     clue as to how to design one of these units.  Any suggestions or ideas
     would be apprecated.

            ASLAN INVASION OF REGENCY TERRITORY
 
 
I was looking over some UWP data of the Spinward Marches
recently, and many of the worlds I thought were part of the
Regency (Rebellion Era) were marked as being controlled by the
Aslan.
 
The data in the Imperial Encyclopedia reflects this.
 
One of the worlds was Glisten!
 
I wouldn\'t have expected an asteroid cluster with a population of
9 BILLION and a tech-level of 15, a naval base, a scout base,
major shipyards with large Imperial Naval contracts, and a
civilization based heavily on interplanetary transportation to
fall to any but the largest conceivable Aslan Fleet!  What
happened?
 
Was there a typo?
 
Does the errata clarify this?
 
A skim through TNS (Traveller News Service) entries failed to
clear this issue up.
 
So, Attention all Regency and Rebellion History buffs!
 
MY QUESTION IS THIS:

Found this in my Mech Eng. Handbook so I ought to be accurate:

**** WARNING: MILDLY TECHNICAL DISCUSSION FOLLOWS!!! ****

A average person consumes 0.83 kg of oxygen and produce 1.00 kg of CO2 per day
for a give volume of air at 1 atmosphere and 25 degree C come to something
like this:
        7.776 * Volume in cubic meters = hours of Oxygen for 1 person

However I am unaware of the concentration of CO2 would be toxic to human in a
sealed enviroment so this would be a ultimate limitation.  Also these value 
are for someone who\'s awake so it can be increase if these folk were asleep or
resting.

The best example of this would be the Apollo 1 tragedy.  The crew capsule at
that time used a pure oxygen supply which ultimate killed the crew when it
caught on fire(fuel was in the cabin material).  I would rate
the odds of a fire a MUCH greater risk then running out of O2.  Assume this
scenario is played out in the presence of operating device (electrical/optical
/or mechanical) I would try the following:

                To determine if a oxygen fire starts:
                        Average: Pressure in atmoshpere + modifiers

                        modifiers
                        +1 if mechanical device present
                        +1 if optical/electronic device present
                        +2 if High speed mechanical device present
                        +3 if High power electric device present
                        +5 if Anything sparks!

Determining on the nature of the material the fire could be a glowing amber
(low level of reactant or slow burning type) or an explodsion that engulfs the
entire room...  Makes for short adventures though....:(

The Glock series pistol and the Steyr series rifles are both examples of
existing guns with frame built of plastic.  However the receiver and barrel
are both made of traditional metallic materials.  So late TL-8 is when I would
expect them.

In order to make the barrel and receiver out of non metallic would be
diffcult.  What is need are high temperature, high strength, and high wear
resistant materials.  So far none of the non-metallic materials exibit all of
these qualities.  If the goal is to pass through airport type metal detector
then you could use metal composite made of non-ferrous (i.e. iron) materials.
Materials like Carbon Titanium composite is an example.  But don\'t expect to
see these until about TL-10

In FF&S it states that any non-ETC rounds after TL-10 are caseless.  As to
when it becomes practical it depends on your definition of \'practical\'.  If
the concern is \'cook-off\' that pretty much been solved.  If the conern is
reloading you\'re out of luck.  In my campaign I allow players to make their
own ammunition (within reason as to type) if they possess a ammunition mould
and press set...think of it as an injection moulding machine for ammunitions.
However it\'s a ship mounted device...definitely not man-portable.

Also as a side note: use of caseless ammo allows receivers to be designed
without the normal ejection cycle...thus allow a potentially higher cyclic
rate of fire.

Subject: Shall Not Perish 16 - Regency Navy

[Regency Fleet list omitted...along w/some other stuff]

Just a few comments on the list...

Looking back at my MT map of the Spinward Marches.  Isn\'t all of Glisten
subsector within the area of Aslan Conquest?  Not to mention about a quarter
of Trin\'s Veil Subsector (spin-rim ward)?  Assuming the conquest area
would narrow as it reached deeper into Imperial territory, I dare to
assume that Pax Rulin, Gazulin, Sindal, and Tobia would\'ve been overran as
well.  (Also see Imperial map in Survival Margin, pg 98)

I would suggest that the 100th, 201 to 204th fleet be either deleted
(persumed destoryed during the invasion) or reconsolidated into a new
fleet due to heavy losses. (probably incorporated into the most senior
of the five fleets)  I don\'t know if \'displaced\' is such a good description
of what happened to fleets from conqured areas.  It seem unlikely that
these fleets would withdraw and let their keep be overrunned unless they\'ve
taken significant losses.

However, If the Aslan Ihati and the Regency are at peace in the New Era,
these fleets could be re-established with Aslan Ships.

Also about 1/2 to 2/3 of Aramis Subsector was overrun by the Vargr
Invasions.  I would imagine the 214th also took a beating before this was
allowed to happen.  If the terrority was not retaken by the time of the
New Era the 214th would probably still exist but expect it to have shiny new
TL-16 ships and performing quite aggressive patrols along the frontiers.

The 193rd fleet would be tasked with the job of keeping the Swordworlders
in line (punitive strikes/aggressive patrols/showing the Regency banner).

Given the proximity of 43rd fleet to the area of the Aslan conquest, I
would expect the 18th (Lanth) fleet be re-delopyed to help cover that
subsector\'s border with the Swordworlds.

Considering the central location of the 73rd (Mora) and 23rd (Rhylanor)
Fleets, these would probably be the original core of the Patro.  Expect
to find large number of high jump performance battle squadrons here.

The same would go for the Deneb Fleets.  I don\'t have a map of the Sector
so I\'ll leave it to other to ponder their fates.  However the Reft fleets
are probably gone.  Dulinor wouldn\'t let go of 188 perfectly good fighting
ships so nearby.

- -Ed

p.s. Great listing.

p.p.s. BTW I beleive the Deneb 212th (Lamas) should be 213th.  Still 
conflict with the Regina fleet though.

Signal to noise ratio.  TNE != Traveller.  The game systems are very
different.  The flavor of the games is really different.  If I wanted
realism, I\'d join the army.  I\'ll stop ranting now.

This seems to be a common problem with large groups.  Look at the
Classic Trek vs. Next Generation vs. DS-9 fights.  Look at the 
DS-9 vs.  Babylon-5 fights.  Look at the rec.games.mecha vs. the
sci.military folks fight on the B-5 newsgroup.  Most of the fights 
are silly. 

I will admit that the rec.games.mecha vs. the sci.military folks fight
is fun to watch.  The giant robot fans are basing their arguments on
game rules while the sci.military folks are talking about real world
experiences.  Weird.  Catch it on the Babylon-5 newsgroup.

I\'d like to see the list split.  That way if I have a busy day I can
save the TNE postings for another time.  Also then I can discuss the
old adventures without someone bringing up the GDW-virus.

[ WARNING: IMPERIAL VIRUS HAS INVADED SUNBANE!]
Well, seems like it anyway :-)
This didn\'t seem to get through first time, so I\'m resending. Thanks to 
Pierre (609/7649) - yes, a currency-killing virus would be devastating. I\'m 
sure I\'ve heard this one before, I\'ll have to see where from... a book? TML? 
Anyone know?

GREEN VIRUS

I\'d just like to explore a \'green\' virus (601/7543) a little further. Thanks
to Steve for his input (602/7555), I\'d like to ask the following (of him and
TML as a whole):

> First, viruses tend to be *very* species specific.

My biology knowledge (at the limit) tends to zero, so I can\'t argue, merely
propose:
a) I used the word virus. Would any virulent form of bacteria or other
organism be more suitable as a biological warefare agent?
b) The virus could afford to be specific if it targeted the correct victim.
There might be a suitable common factor among most worlds (type or species of
livestock, crop type, human type, etc.) that would allow it to hit all worlds
hard. If not, perhaps this might explain why some worlds have survived better.
Surely some \'agent\' which affected humanoids in a generic manner (e.g.
respiratory) would affect all the human species and could still be quite
lethal to Aslan and Vargr. Perhaps the Hivers don\'t use the same blood
oxygenation techniques that our bodies rely on. Perhaps (like Asian flu), the
virus (oops, used that word again), can cross between apparently dissimilar
species in certain cases?

> Second, if it destroyed the ecosystems of planets, the Imperial core would
> be essentially rendered uninhabitable, especially if the "virus" was
> persistent in nature.

The species-specificity probably prevents total annhilation of an ecosystem.
Assuming the \'agent\' was intended as a biological weapon (rather than some
strange disease that dropped off a passing asteroid or was sent by the
ZHhhasjycgerh from a nearby hostile galaxy), the makers would not have
intended to wipe out an entire planet\'s flora and fauna as this would make the
world useless to them (assuming they were intending to take control of it).
On the same lines, the \'agent\' would be reasonably short lived (weeks to
months) once active, otherwise the planet would again be unusable by the
\'conqueror\'? Of course, if the Hivers sent it, or somehow had a hand in it, 
perhaps they already have the neutralising agent and are just watching 
everyone else squirm?

> Third, unlike the computer virus, direct physical contact would be required
> to spread the virus. Fourth the rate of spread would either be slow enough
> to save outliers (like, say, the Solomani Confederation),...

Even if the \'agent\' were spread by contact, it ought to be able to cover the
majority of the Imperium eventually - after all, most worlds are contacted by
starships. On major traffic routes with several hundred or thousand ships a
day passing through, landing, etc. the chances of contamination ought to be
high. If the \'agent\' can be airborne, or can stick to the outside of a ship
(somehow surviving atmospheric entry, vacuum of space, solar radiation, etc.)
or anything along these lines then it could still spread widely. Of course,
if the incubation (or inactive) period of the \'agent\' is too short then it
would start showing up before it had spread very far. Perhaps this was
intentional - find a potentially hostile planet, sow the seeds, leave planet
innocently and then a year later when the war has started the inhabitants
wonder why their crops/livestock/etc. have all just died.
With regard to the Solomani (and Zhodani, Aslan, Vargr, et al), I\'m not sure
how bad they\'ve been hit anyway [FACT ALERT: I don\'t have TNE!] and it would
only require one trader to smuggle his goods (and hence the \'agent\') across
the border to a source who then carries the goods to an A-class starport,
providing a central distribution point for the \'agent\' to all the surrounding
worlds.
An airborne \'green\' virus certainly doesn\'t require physical contact to the
degree that the computer virus does (even if it were spread by data networks
and radio links).

> It might be possible to work up a plausible scenario of some sort,...

I\'m trying:
a) just out of interest (knowing little about such warfare methods),
b) in case any TNE virus-haters find this more useful than the computer virus,
c) in case I can use this \'agent\' on a smaller scale in other games (hell, I
ain\'t even had the Rebellion yet!).
The GDW virus has already taken some direct hits in all the flak that\'s been
thrown at it. It\'s still flying, because it\'s the official version, but I
think it\'s probably less plausible than a \'green\' virus, especially when it
appears that some people are wondering if the computer virus is psionic, in
order to explain it\'s methods of contaminating low tech computers, etc.!

> ... but it would be substantially different in form than the TNE scenario.

Why? My initial thoughts were that an \'agent\' would be designed to mostly
knock-out a planet (killing crops, livestock or people) without destroying its
useful factors (flora, fauna, natural resources, man-made structures). Once
discovered it could be defeated (eventually) but progress would be gradual and
even once a counter-agent were discovered, it would be difficult to distribute
to every world affected. In those areas where the \'agent\' had died out
(possibly intentionally, possibly due to over-gorging itself on the available
victims - a bit like yeast dies off in brewing), people would get together
pretty quickly and set up quarantine areas. These would have to be big
because, just like the computer virus, a single infected ship or person could
bring back the virus.

Right, I\'ve lit the fuse, let\'s see what pretty colours the fireworks are. Any
CONSTRUCTIVE replies (direct or to TML) would be much appreciated. I\'m not
interested in long arguments on why a \'green\' virus wouldn\'t work. Instead
replies of the "this factor would be a problem... but perhaps the virus was
engineered to get around it like this..." would be much more useful.

SHIELA-X (601/7539) - Thanks Pete. I know some players who\'d love to 
play/meet her.

L\'OEUL D\'DIEU (601/7538) - My French knowledge is as extensive as my 
Biology. If this is God\'s Eye (or something) where\'s the Mote? Thanks Steve, 
another set of data to add to my collection.

EARTH COLONIES (603/7566, 7567) - More useful background (I don\'t play 
anywhere near the Solomani but the organisations, etc. will still appear in 
my games near the Spinward Marches). Keep it coming, Dave.

DEEP SPACE STATIONS - Nice discussion, especially 602/7554 and 603/7565 
(err, lost the name and Steve again, respectively). Just where does every 
tenth supply ship go after it leaves the Naval depot? It seems to jump in 
the wrong direction for any of the known naval bases... ah! Just imagine the 
embarrassment finding Zhodani naval bases in \'empty\' sectors of the Spinward 
Marches, Imperial bases in the middle of the Solomani Rim, etc.

REGENCY SOURCEBOOK - Just wish I had TNE and could contribute in some 
manner. Oh well... What we need is another mailing list, say tml_beta? :-)

AND THE LATEST BIWEEKLY MAILING
Looks like lots of other messages got lost as well as mine.

BLASTER - Yummy

DEEP SPACE STATIONS - Keep talking guys

LONGBOW - Interstellar psi networks - old hat. My 3I campaign uses them 
between all Imperial subsector capitals, especially those in threatened or 
rebellious areas. Of course, the populace don\'t know this and it\'s pain of 
death to let the news leak out. Since I play a Scout Corp special agent 
(with my colleagues posing as Imperial counts and countesses) we 
occasionally are allowed to use the psi post service if we need urgent 
direct contact with the central intelligence office of the Emperor (who 
hasn\'t been killed yet!).

AIR AND BREATHING - Gasp... splutter... I knew I should have checked that 
air pressure gauge on my vacc suit oxygen tank!

EARTH COLONIES NEWS - Keep it coming Dave

AEROI - Remind me from whence the Aeroi originated? Was it a JTAS or are you 
the originators?

DAKAAR - Ship plans! Ship plans! What\'s on sunbane at the moment (rather 
than me having to search for it), what\'s going to be on there and do we have 
a standard drawing format yet? GIF?

NPCS - Thanks Tariq.

HIWG - Roger Myhre - can you give us details when you get the HIWG stuff on 
sunbane, so we know where to look? Thanks

ENOUGH WAFFLE

              TML INTERESTS -- WHO PLAYS WHAT?
 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION LATELY ABOUT AESTHETICS ON THE
TML, TIMIDITY INHIBITING POSTING DUE TO DOUBT ABOUT TML\'ERS
INTERESTS, AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS MUCH INTEREST ANYMORE
AMONGST TML\'ERS IN THE CLASSIC AND REBELLION ERAS.
 
LETS CLEAR THIS UP ONCE AND FOR ALL...
 
The overwhelming response to my For Sale notices for Classic and
MegaTraveller spares indicates a high level of interest in
pre-TNE eras.
 
As for my own pushing of TNE, it might interest you to know that...
 
I have yet to begin playing TNE because I\'m determined to play
all the way through the first two eras before I do.  I do however
have a deep facination with TNE, and since my gaming group has
been on haitus for the past month-and-a-half or so, I\'ve been
posting a lot concerning the Regency circa 1200.  Well, as
circumstances would have it, (Seattlelites, take note) my gaming
sessions shall be starting up again this coming Saturday, so the
slant of my messages shall probably be returning to the Classic
Era very soon.
 
How soon we forget...
 
NOT VERY LONG AGO, BACK IN JANUARY, GUY GARNET (aka DEREK
WILDSTAR) DID A SURVEY OF TML\'ERS TO SEE WHO WAS RUNNING WHAT
KIND OF CAMPAIGN (CT, MT, TNE), AND WHAT RULESETS THEY WERE
USING.  OVER 40 TRAVELLER REFEREES RESPONDED.
 
BELOW IS TML BUN 541 / MSG 6734, WHICH INCLUDES GARY\'S SURVEY
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS.  I THINK YOU WILL FIND IT MOST
INTERESTING...
 
====================================================================
====================BUN 541 / MESSAGE #6734=========================
=====================WHO PLAYS WHAT? SURVEY=========================
==============By Gary Garnet / aka Derek Wildstar===================
=======================January 31st, 1994===========================
====================================================================
 
A (relatively) recent discussion on TML got me thinking about campaigns.
What do Traveller players and referees currently play?  So I asked that
TMLers who are currently in a campaign (as either players or referees) to
send me some e-mail saying which rules and what campaign background you are
using.
 
I got a total of 42 responses, describing 52 campaigns (two people were
involved in three campaigns at once, and six were involved in two campaigns
at once).  Several people described campaigns which had just ended (finished
and unlikeley to continue) or ones that they *would* run if an opportunity
presented itself - I didn\'t count either of these cases.
 
I can draw some interesting observations from the results.  First of all, 42
responses is a statistically significant sample of the TML population.
While I have no way of knowing if the sample is random or not (the sample
is those people who responded to my survey), there is also no reason to
believe that it is *not* representative of the TML as a whole.
 
I\'m on more shaky ground when I try to extrapolate the results on TML to the
game-buying population as a whole.  I would suggest that TML is representative
of the older segment of the game market (college students and young adults),
while it virtually ignores the younger segment of the market (high-school-age
buyers).
 
 
SUMMARY:
 
The envelope, please:
 
The rule set with the most campaigns is _TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA, with 50% of
the vote, and more than twice the number of the closest runner-up.
 
The background with the most campaigns is CLASSIC THIRD IMPERIUM, with 48%
of the vote, and slighly less than twice the number of the closest runner-up.
 
 
RULES:
 
    Rank    Title               Percent
 
    #1  Traveller: The New Era      50%
    #2  MegaTraveller               21%
    #3  "Classic" Traveller         19%
    #4  2300AD                       6%
    #5  GURPS                        4%
 
I was suprised to see MegaTraveller get more votes than Classic Traveller,
although the result is quite close (one vote!).  From TML traffic, I would
have expected it to score significantly higher.
 
 
CAMPAIGNS:
 
    Rank    Era or Background       Percent (*)
 
    #1  "Classic" Third Imperium      48%
    #2  "New Era" Campaigns           27%
    #3  Rebellion                     12%
    #4  Other                         10%
    #5  2300AD                         4%
 
(*) Does not sum to 100% due to rounding.
 
This result was suprising, particularly in light of the above.  I would have
expected that the New Era campaign background would have been more popular
with New Era purchasers, but only a small majority (54%) of those who use
T:TNE play in the official T:TNE universe.

What\'s interesting here is the depth of support for the "Classic" Third
Imperium.  No matter which rules set you are talking about, it seems that
there is a significant percentage of those people playing in a 3rd Imperial
background.  It would be interesting to compare sales to date of T:TNE with
total sales of Classic Traveller and MegaTraveller, I wonder if it
correlates with the numbers of campaigns currently being played?
 
 
CONCLUSIONS:
 
I note that the largest single segment of the Traveller campaign "space" is
the T:TNE rules and the "official" Post-Collapse background.  But this
is internally fractured, and (for example) RCES or Star Viking materials may
be of limited utility to people who are running a Pocket Empire or Regency
campaign.  These "New Era" campaigns also represent slightly less than 27%
of the Traveller campaigns currently being played.  While there\'s no larger
single rules/setting combination, there should be a way to reach a broader
part of the Traveller players.
 
If it were up to me, I\'d certainly put some effort into a "Classic" Third
Imperium campaign supplement.  Potentially, such a supplement could be
impetus to cause new sales of the T:TNE rules, be "converting" people who at
present see no advantage to changing rules systems.
 
Again, IMHO (In My Humble Opinion) there\'s not a whole lot of point to the
other segments of the market.  There\'s no effective way to write for the
"other" segment - FF&S comes about as close as you can get to targetting this
population with it\'s alternative technology rules.  The Rebellion represents
a small market (11.5%), and in addition, "Third Imperium" materials may
still be useful in a Rebellion-era campaign.
 
The numbers for 2300AD may not be reliable.  TML is composed primarliy of
Traveller players, and discussion doesn\'t usually apply very well to 2300AD
topics; therefore the game and it\'s background may be significantly
under-represented in the survey.
 
 
NOTES:
 
"Traveller: The New Era" includes two rule sets: Traveller: The New Era and
Deluxe Traveller: The New Era (referred to elsewhere as T:TNE and DT:TNE,
respectively).
 
"MegaTraveller" is just that.
 
"Classic Traveller" is a number of rules sets and options: Traveller (the
original boxed set, Books 1-3), Deluxe Traveller, The Traveller Book, and
Starter Traveller.  Any or all of these rules, in combination with Books
4-8, Striker, and/or the DGP Task System (described extensively in The
Travellers\' Digest prior to the publication of MegaTraveller) - these all
were aggregated under "Classic" Traveller, because they were effectively the
same game.
 
"2300AD" includes Traveller: 2300 and the revised edition, 2300AD.  No
respondents reported that they are using the original (Traveller: 2300)
edition.
 
"GURPS" is, of course, a Steve Jackson Games product; it was included
because I have heard considerable anecdotal evidence that it is a popular
choice for people who don\'t consider Traveller a viable game system, but
want to continue playing in a Traveller-like setting.  It is aparrently not
as popuar as word of mouth would have it.
 
The definitions of the campaign backgrounds are or course more subjective.
In general, I went with whatever label the respondent chose for his or her
campaign.  In a few cases it was a tough call, but I put the response in the
category that seemed to fit best.
 
"Classic Third Imperium" campaigns are those set in or around the
Pre-Rebellion Third Imperium.  Some referees indicated that they may implement
the Rebellion in their campaigns.  Just like hypothetical or future campaigns,
I categorized campaigns based on what is happening *now*, and not on
future plans which may or may not be realized.
 
"New Era Campaigns" are those set in a Post-Crash universe, whether it be
the official RCES and Star Viking setting, or referee-developed Pocket
Empire, Free Trader or even Regency campaigns.  I would like to provide a
breakdown of the different types, but in many cases there isn\'t enough
detail in the responses to say for sure which category is applicable.
 
"Rebellion" campaigns are those set anywhere in Imperial space in any time
after the assasination of Strephon to the Crash.
 
"Other" campaigns are those in original referee-generated universes, or
universes modified beyond recognition.
 
"2300AD" campaigns are those that use the Traveller: 2300 or 2300AD campaign
settings.  There don\'t seem to be many of these around anymore.
 
 
If anyone has additional questions about this, send me some E-mail and I
will be happy to answer questions about this survey.

So you see, there still is a lot of interest in the Classic and
Rebellion Eras.  Unless these refs have all changed over in the
past 4 months.  Confirmations, anyone?
 
I hope I\'ve helped to distinguish all doubt.
 
As for what guidelines there are for discussion on the TML, the
only restriction in TML\'s charter is that it be at least vaguely
related to Traveller!
 
Don\'t be timid, don\'t be shy.  Get your favorite subjects
flowing!  Whether it be CT, MT, or TNE, for that\'s what the TML
is all about:  "Traveller, in all of its forms."

What we get from TCS is an annual naval budget, based on UWP, and 
shipyard capacity, based on starport type and UWP (specifically, 
population).  I don\'t have TCS handy right now; Hans, Ken, someone

A LOT low, unless you are talking about capital ships only.  I might 
believe that the Sword Worlds has only 42 active-duty Battleships, but
given the naval budgets and yard capacities of even Tizon or Sting 
(let alone Narsil - ohmigawd!), I cannot believe that the Sword Worlds
has only 42 total battleships, cruisers, carriers and escorts.  Sting
alone should have that many.

Remember, the Confederation has been in the habit of taking on the 
Imperium; I suspect they run a much larger navy in proportion to their 
population than the Imperium does.  Compared to the Navies of 
independent single worlds, the Imperium has an incredibly low (factor 
of 100 or more) naval strength in proportion to its population (based 
on my experience playing TCS).

I know we had a long-running thread about the pros and cons of deep 
meson gun sites a few years back, and I don\'t intend to resurrect that 
thread, BUT-- experience playing TCS has shown one not-so-minor defect 
of those "deep meson gun sites" that Impy planets are so fond of:  
they are shorter ranged than missiles.  A fleet can stand off and 
bombard your starport, industries, surface installations and troops 
out of existance without your meson guns being able to reach it.  

>Regina has only 10 SDBs, according to the 5FW map.  However, the

I assume that the SDBs mentioned in FFW are more like Mora\'s 
multi-hundred thousand ton planetoid monitor than like those 200-ton 
fighters-on-steroids that are listed as SDBs in the various Traveller 
books.  I would be hard put to imagine that a world with Regina\'s yard
capacity and budget was restricted to 10 overgrown fighters, or that 
10 oversized fighters would pose a serious threat to an invading 
fleet.

This is a contradiction that has been around since Classic Traveller 
and never been explained.  Several places it has been explicitly 
stated (no, I don\'t have it in front of me now) that the Imperium 
does not allow multi-stellar member nations.  I believe it was 
mentioned in one of the Solomani supplements, to contrast it with the 
Solomani Confederation which was made up of multi-stellar member 
nations.  Yet, we have always had those Type 6 governments, some of 
which were described as having Imperial military governors (like 
Terra), most of which are described as colonies of some neighboring 
system. Go figure.

        Although I am not a "player" of Traveler, CT, etc,etc. I
am an advid READER of the fiction generated as a spinoff. Part of 
this is the rich backround data that supports the Traveler 
Universe.
        Recently, David Johnson, whoes work we have all enjoyed 
here sent me a copy of his group\'s publication, THE MELBOURNE 
TIMES. This publication is something like the old JTAS, with a 
multi-page "News Service" entry, great illustrations, and several
feature articles.
        The News Service is based on Dave\'s "Earth Colonies" 
campaign, and is extreamly dense in information content. I read it
through the first time and found that I had to go back and re-read
it to get the maximum effect. THAT\'S how packed with info it was.
I finally sat down and began taking notes, it was that good! I got
Issue #3 as a sample, I do not know where this is in the "flow" 
of the zine, but it\'s News Service covered the period 1531.12 to 
0723.27 [0ct 22, 3001 to Nov 12, 3001].
        Also included in this issue was a "Sophont Brief" on a new
alien race I had not encountered before the MEREN. If they ARE 
familiar to you, then anything I could say would not due this 
article justice, and if they are new to you also, and if you\'re 
tired of aliens who are genetically altered cats and dogs .... or
humans ... then I urge you to pony up $1.50 for at least issue #3
of MELBOURNE TIMES. It\'s worth it even if allyou use is the 
Sophont Brief. But I\'m willing to bet you\'ll find a lot more of 
use in this, like:
        1 - Library Data. Short [1/2 page] but again close spaced
            8 point type, so there is a lot of data there.
        2 - Personafile - New NPCs for your campaign, this one,
            Benazir Chatterji would be suitable as a patron.
        3 - Worldscape/Starfield - although the physical genera- 
            tion of a system can be automated, the backround and 
            especially NAMEING everything is a pain in the...well
            you know what I mean!
        4 - And finally although it\'s not called the AMBER ZONE, 
            it is! An excellent adventure idea - utilizing dolphin
            characters.
All in all, MELBOURNE TIMES is well worth the $5.00 {$10.00 
overseas} that Dave and the guys want for their work. It\'s 21-24 
pages of hard data, NPCs and adventure ideas!

Today, generally the Rule of Three prevails.  Three combat platoons makes a
company, three combat companies make a battalion, etc.  There is no "Law of
War" that makes this a golden rule.  What is important is the span of control
of the commanders.  Of course that can change with technology.

Before you do the TOE of the Division you need to hypothesize how the Division
fights and what effect TL-15  would have on combat.  Suppose all of the
infantry would be TL-15 Battle Dress, Grav Belts and Fusion Rifles.  How are
they employed that is different from today\'s infantry units?  What kind of
logistical tail would this require.  What if they had battle dress but not grav
belts?  Do you need Grav Tank support?  Etc., etc., etc.

If want some basic info and/or help I have a good knowledge of US Army TOE and
some relivent background, 4 years in the 82nd Airborne Div and 8 in the Special
Forces.

>Remeber that Marines are probably often deployed as companies, and

>(A combat engineer squad?  I guess we could get carried away.)

A more effective method would be attached troops/units.  The Task Force concept
is used extensively by  the US Army to tailor make Co., Bn. and Bde. task
forces for specific missions.  Units are attched as needed to accopmlish
specific missions.

PS: Can a TL-15 4mm Guass rifle penetrate TL-15 Battle Dress?

Baraka made it to the Galaxia Deluxe.  The air-lock took longer
than normal.  Baraka\'s fear of being trapped reached an all-time
peak, despite the apparently normal people sharing the air-lock
with him.  He had his hand in his pouch ready to draw his plastic
pistol when the inner doors started to open.  He thought he heard
a scream...
 
He started to draw his weapon, but realized it was nothing more
than bad bearings on one of the door motors.  Baraka sighed
deeply, and just stood there as the others left the air-lock for
the hotel\'s busy lobby.  Baraka poked his head out, looking first
to the left, then to the right.  The people looked normal enough.
 
With a slight smile on his bugeyed face, Baraka weaved his way to
the public vidcomms.  He slid his credcard into the slot and
keyed in a sequence.  The screen said "Calling James L. Tiberius.
Waiting for answer, please stand by..."  Baraka wondered why the
phone had no voice.  Still slightly paranoid, as he waited Baraka
glanced from individual to individual in the lobby to see if he
could spot any that were not quite normal.  He couldn\'t.
 
"Baraka, how many times have I told you never to call me here?"
The man on the screen was in his fifties, his face covered with 3
days growth of grey whiskers.
 
Startled, Baraka replied, "James, am I GLAD to see YOU.  My cover
is blown.  I\'m choking.  You\'ve got to help me!"
 
"I\'m retired, remember?  Call the precinct."
 
Baraka couldn\'t stand his friend\'s condescending tone, it almost
always frustrated him.  "There\'s something weird going on in that
neighborhood.  I\'d be a sitting duck in there."
 
"You and your paranoia.  You\'ll be fine."
 
Baraka started to raise his voice, but remembered where he was
and moved in closer to the mic instead.  "They\'re insane.  I
killed two of them."
 
"What the hell are you talking about?"
 
Baraka, looking quite serious now, stared into the vid-dot
sitting just above the phone\'s screen and lied through his teeth.
"Two of Eddy\'s boys came to get me.  I killed them both.  I had
to, or I was dead meat."  Well, at least it was partially true.
He was trying to follow Jorga Porshe\'s example -- don\'t tell the
truth if it will land you in the funny farm.
 
"Where are the bodies?  What did you do with the bodies?"
 
Baraka slapped his hand over the speaker, and leaned closer to
the mic, and whispered loudly, "Keep it down, would ya?  There
are people all around."
 
Jim said something, but he couldn\'t hear him.
 
Baraka wanted him to see the bodies, or at least what was left of
them.  He fantasized about being Jorga Porshe, suave, always with
the right plan, and the right thing to say.  "Physical evidence,"
he mumbled to himself, as his hand slid down off the speaker.
 
"What?"  Jim was obviously getting irritated.  "What evidence?
Where\'s the murder weapon?"
 
Baraka\'s mind began to wander.  *Baraaaaaaka*  *Baraaaaaaka*
 
"Baraka!"
 
He snapped out of it, glad to be free of the horrifying
flashback.  He started to puke, but was already emptied out.
 
Jim was convinced something was up.  "Where are the bodies?"
 
"In my apartment."
 
The ex-detective paused, then stated sternly.  "Baraka, I want
you to stay where you are.  I\'m going to call the precinct now.
Everything is going to be okay."
 
Baraka, looking quite pekid, shook his head slowly.  "You owe
me.  I need your help."
 
There was a long pause.
 
Years ago, when Detective Tiberius was undercover to bust up a
small exodrine smuggling operation, Baraka had saved his life.
Had James taken that drink, he wouldn\'t be alive today.  He
befriended Baraka after that, and swore that he would repay the
deed.  "If ever you need my help," he had said, "I\'ll be
there."
 
Jim took a deep breath.  "Alright, I\'ll see you at your apartment."
 
Baraka\'s eye\'s grew wide.  "No way!  I\'m not going back there."
 
"Meet me there in 1/2 an hour."  Bzzzt.  The screen went blank.
The words "Thankyou for using Telequick" appeared on the screen.
 
It was quite comfortable in the lobby, yet, despite his jumpsuit,
Baraka was shivering.  He didn\'t feel very good.
 
*Baraaaaaaka*

        Steve Gumnit assassinated him back in 1979 or so.  In real
        world time 1979.  Game time was also 1979 Terran dating system
        as well!
 
        Any number of folks after that attempted to grab the Iridium
        hot seat since then.  The few that successfully managed to
        take it found that it really wasn\'t worth having.  It is
        really hard to keep a low profile when you are Emperor!
 
        I had a group that was around when Strephon was assassinated
        ala GDW; however, they were really far out on the rim and the
        news was about 2 years old at the time.  They were much too
        busy surviving and avoiding \'Imperial entanglements\' to check
        up on what happened.
 
        My current game is set in 1105, so Strephon is still alive and
        kicking.  The players are Zhodani agents, so we will see what
        happens.

        Well, since I don\'t use the virus, and I never had quite the
        destruction that GDW did, there aren\'t \'WILDS\' in my game.  I
        (and my players more importantly) didn\'t want to play
        Twilight 2000 in space.

        I still use a picture of the Shaw of Iran as the picture of

That depends a bit on how "airtight" you play the blockade.  If you play it as
airtight as GDW suggests (destroying every incoming ship), no one unless you don
\'t plan to
return. Ever.  Ships are just too expensive to waste.  Including by the Regency 
Government!

If you play it as a reasonably tight custom blockade where your ship can be cert
ified clean and
go on, then all sorts of speculative merchants will go to set up trade posts (ou
tlets for medium tech goods), seek hi-tech facilities requiring few repairs, new
 (or fabled in old trade circulars) products.  (Examine Piers Anthony\'s old Poly
technic League/Nicolas van Rijn stories for a good inspriational feel).

The down and out will go looking to squat on a large "mostly free" chunk of real
 estate.

The missionarily inclined will go to rebuild down-trodden survivors (whether the
y want it or not :-).

The Gov\'t will sends Scouts and set up listening posts for its own knowledge and
 protection.
  

>What would the Regency government itself be doing about the wilds?

It would want to explore.  However, note the limitations set upon it by the expe
nse of the 
blockade (in the next few messages, I have a discussion about the Regency Navy &
 RQS & such
rude things as budgets and taxes.)

I\'ve been watching this discussion for a while, and it has prompted me 
to post some of my own material on Sacnoth.  Regarding the above, I 
sifted through the description of the Sword Worlders in the Contact 
article, compared it to the apparent Imperial standards of behavior, 
compared the Imperial culture to 1980\'s American culture (the two are 
quite different), and concluded that Sword Worlders are probably a lot 
like conservative 1970\'s Americans.  By *IMPERIAL* standards, the 
SWers are `paternalistic, macho, vain, braggarts\'; by 1990 normal 
American standards, they *might* be mildly sexist and/or racist; by 
1990 American liberal standards, they\'re Republicans :-).  By 1970 
American standards, they\'re just plain folks.  

What follows is my campaign summary for Sacnoth:
 
Sacnoth is a very Earth-like world, one of the most Earth-like in the 
entire Spinward Marches.  It is slightly smaller than Earth, and the 
gravity is slightly lower (0.89 G).  There is slightly more than half 
as much water (49% of the surface area).  Its sun is somewhat brighter 
than Earth\'s - an F9 V. The temperature and climate is about the same, 
though there are more local climatic extremes due to more land and 
less water to buffer the climate than Earth has.  The atmosphere is 
standard O2-N2 mix, but polluted from Sacnoth\'s industries and cities.  
Fortunately, Sacnoth\'s medical and environmental technology keeps up 
with the resultant health problems.  It has a long day, 33.68 hours, 
and a long year (504 Sacnoth days, 708 Earth days).  The seasons are 
correspondingly long, and, in the early days of Sacnoth\'s settlement, 
the six months of winter resulted in a very high rate of clinical 
depression and suicide.  At the present time, this hazard is averted 
by light-enhancing interior design and customary use of 
stimulant-laden drinks during the winter.  (They drink lots of 
coffee-type drinks.)  Winter Melancholy is still a frequent 
affliction, but is almost instantly recognizable and easily treated.  

Sacnoth is inhabited by 8.91 billion people, the overwhelming majority 
of which are human (A very few Vargr, no Aslan, no minor races), 
mostly of Solomani descent.  There are some people of mixed 
Vilani-Solomani blood, but the cultural heritage is overwhelmingly 
Solomani Scandinavian-Germanic.  The major population centers are the 
megalopoli of Berkagerdi, Trettigard, Jordestad, Tyssestad, and 
Asarna, and various other, lesser cities (under 100 million).  The 
megalopoli are divided into city-sized administrative units called 
Cantons, ruled by a noble of at least Baronial rank.  There are two 
city-sized orbital habitats, Vemdalhavn and Eyrarhavn, and many 
smaller, factory-sized installations.  The shipyards of Berkagerdi and 
Vemdalhavn are capable of building up to 5000 ton starships, and a 
variety of non-starships.  

The current government of Sacnoth is a feudal monarchy (NOT a 
constitutional monarchy!); the current King is Harald VII.  He is the 
same monarch who ruled before the war, though certain of his advisors 
were ousted in the political re-alignment that resulted in the 
formation of the Border Worlds.  Sacnoth nobles traditionally have 
families late in life (age 75 to 125), and King Harald\'s heir, Prince 
Johann, was killed in naval combat during the war, so the question of 
succession is somewhat uncertain right now.  Current politics revolve 
around the succession question, and the very real resentment felt by a 
significant fraction of the population (esp.  the military) at 
"knuckling under" to the Imperium and "becoming an Impy puppet state".  
The military in particular feels betrayed by the government they 
served so loyally, much like the German Army after WWI.  

Transportation is uniformly gravitic; wheeled vehicles are quaint 
museum pieces from other worlds -- much like chariots in the real 
world.  Sacnoth builds very high quality grav vehicles (TL 13).  
Sacnoth medical technology is extremely advanced (TL 14); if there are 
any pieces of you left to put back together, they can probably fix 
you.  As a result, in addition to the standard crimes defined now, 
violence against another person falls into the categories of Assault, 
Lethal Assault, and Murder.  Murder is an Assault that results in 
permanent death, whereas Lethal Assault is an Assault that results in 
temporary death (dead, but resuscitated later).  

The standard of living is uniformly high, though there are always 
people who are less advantaged than others.  However, there are no 
"backward" parts of the world.  As is to be expected in a world of 
almost 9 billion people, laws and regulations affect most fields of 
endeavour, but are not particularly oppressive -- just annoying.  
Paper is another quaint historical curiousity, but entering data into 
administrative databases is still called "paperwork".  Sacnoth\'s 
industries are mostly automated, but household robots are unknown and 
the use of robots to replace anything besides dumb manual labor is 
virtually unknown.  However, all equipment more sophisticated than a 
broom is quite "smart" (think modern microwave oven, but voice 
controlled, for example).  

 
 A few noted products/brand names:
 
 Husqvarna - energy weapons, gauss weapons 
 Nibellung Gravitics - grav vehicles - Enclosed air/raft
 Tonsonig Metals - fissionables, industrial crystals, basic alloys 
   
  System Fleet - After FFW 

about 70% of Sacnoth\'s fleet was destroyed during the Fifth Frontier 
War.  What remains include 32,000 heavy fighters, approx.  600,000 
tons Jump-3 capable (avg 50,000 tons?, approx 12 hulls), 4.8 million 
tons Jump-2 capable, and 7.2 million tons Jump-1 capable (avg 5000 
tons, 2 biggest 30,000 tons, total approx 1440 hulls).

Beg to differ with you.  Such jumps are done in several places in GDW\'s own 
adventures.  In fact, the J5 route across the Great Rift includes more than one
such station.  Such jumps and deep space stations are PART of the background.

How do you get to the Islands Clusters without them?  (Must be, otherwise the
Islands would have been rediscovered by the 3I LONG before the 900s.  (See 
Trillion Credit Squadron for details.)

However, note that costs of operating a series of Deep Space stations increases
geometrically!  Assuming the cost of operating 1 station is 4 times as expensive
as operating an orbital port (probably more like 8, but 4 will do).  To operate 
the
second one, you need to do the same operation from the first!  Setting up that
second station into the depths is 16 (or 64 starting with 8) times as expensive 
to 
build and operate!  Note that regardless of whether they are used for commerical
purposes, building and maintaining something by anyone (including the military o
r by 
Vampires) has a cost in logistics and energy spent for that purpose.  That\'s the
cost I\'m discussing.  Governments cannot set these babies up deep into the Rift 
all
over the place.  This is also why the Vamps are unlikely to "flank" the Regency 
through
 the Rift - it requries to many resources to do.

Ah, you have hit upon another of the reasons why the Regency cannot really exist
given the Virus (and why I didn\'t buy TNE).  You\'re correct - they cannot mainta
in a perfect 
seal.  Actually, it\'s even worse
than you describe; see my upcoming discussions of the Regency\'s naval problems).
Nor can they defend against misjumps - given several hundred ships set to purpos
ely
misjump, several could easily penetrate the Regency.  There should be several Tr
in\'s Veil
type occurrences if not a wholesale rampage.

However, the technologic capability has ALWAYS been available as part of the Tra
veller
milieu.

It does, of course depend on your circumstances.  GDW\'s adventures include cases
of smuggler bases, ancient\'s bases, and naval bases (The Darrians have a major 
naval base hidden in deep space) as well as a few commercial stations.  Note: 
The question was whether it could be done.  

My comments on COST are trying to point out that it rarely is, because it is qui
te
expensive.  The sole reason the Aslan sought for their route over the great Rift
 was that
(for the clan in question), the only other routes for expansion lead to Imperial
 and Solomani
space.

Even in CT & MT, any ship capable of more carrying more than 1 jump\'s worth of f
uel can
make deep space jumps.   That\'s stated several places explicitly.

No?  Why not?  As described by GDW, various forms of the Virus are perfectly cap
able of
coordinating a fleet of several hundred vessels (networked over comm links) as e
asily as you move your hands and feet.  These include vessels of all shapes and 
sizes - including space tankers.  So, as Mr Virus, I pop a jump2 fleet to somewh
ere between two stars.  I refuel some vessels from teh tankers - including some 
of the tankers.  The tankers jump back to "vamp space" and refuel.  They come ba
ck to the fleet hole up point, and refuel more of teh fleet.

Some of the vamp fleet (fully loaded) leaps further into Regency space within te
h dark between the stars.  Spare fuel is forwarded to only some ships.  The rest
 are told to wait.  Do this a fwe more times and some ships appear behind the Re
gency\'s wall and turn on their transmitters.  Uh oh!  For a more elaborate invas
ion, a tanker squadron makes a few leaps back and forth.  It takes time, but if 
the Regency doesn\'t ever patrol the dark between the stars, they will get their 
fannies wacked.

Uh, stored in a what? Computer memory or three?  In imperial military computers

David Johnson says:

>I\'ve always considered that jump calculations use gravity wells as `targets\'.

That\'s not what various elements of the background material describe, though
I will grant they have some effect - try to jump too close to a grav well and yo
u 
don\'t come out.  Jump drive is described as going from point A to point B throug
h a medium (jumpspace) other than our space time continuum where the travel time
 is much shorter.  
There\'s nothing in the mechanics that gives you a bonus or minus 
for trying to get closer or further  from a grav well beyond.  I have to presume
 it doesn\'t
matter then.  If anything, since if you flub a navigation skill roll (In TNE), m
eaning you used 
less skill than required for success, you come out further away, I presume its e
asier to 
jump further from a star than close to the 100 diam limit.
  
All the targeting information for Navigation is based on your data bank.  Up to 
date
nav data includes information about the orbits and  locations of bodies in the s
tar system. 
I\'d imagine that the first fella jumping into s star system comes in well away f
rom the star 
and spends a while observing, so that the next fella will know where is permissa
ble and 
not permissable to jump in.


But I\'ll grant that for t

If your fleet tries jumping into orbit around system X\'s gas giant, odds are goo

The problem is more likely one scale.  Consider interstellar distances.  Now, le
t\'s add extremely small perturbations in the EXACT attitude of your ship as it e
nters and travels through 
jumpspace.  Things like the speed able spacer Jock Strapp is jogging at while ex
ercising in the ship\'s corridors, or the effect on the drive mount of engineer K
appappappappadan\'s boom box while he play Beethoven\'s 5th.  These have a small e
ffect - enough to move the ship at most a couple hundred klicks - like the space
 generally occupied by a fleet while maneuvering!  Since these are not all known
 in advance (some haven\'t occurred; what if  engineer K switches to the
Beatles instead (ah, those longhaired Solomani...), they cannot be completely co
mpensated for.  Of course your fleet disperses a bit during jump - it\'s safer th
an appearing interspersed or appearing close enough to risk collision in those f
irst moments. 

>Jumps to deep space are difficult because there is no gravity well to serve

But you don\'t target a gravity well!  Traveller does not include gravity detecto
rs, and certainly not
ones that work at interstellar distances.  However, you are on to something...

I agree with the effect, but not the reasons,  Remember, gravity wells do
not affect the Navigation plot!  Certainly, a station of any size (smaller than 
those
purported to house 1 million or more, but something that size is prohibitively e
xpensive for
a deep space station) will not produce enough of a gravity well to be noticed.
However, as I said before, due to the need to know exactly where gravity well ge
nerators are
(stars, planets, planetoids, etc), known systems are well mapped.  You can targe
t to the
nth degree and appear (with luck) say anywhere within a 10,000 km bubble without
 much
effort because you have a vast body of data available to you, prompting you to a
ccuracy.

In a jump to a deep space point, there are few such references.  So, instead of 
accuracy to
the .000001th degree, you may only be accurate to the .001th degree.  The coordi
nates are just
not that carefully defined in the navigation data until several hundred jumps ha
ve been made, the general jumpspace perturbations along the route have been docu
mented, and any deep space bodies have been located and recorded.

To recap:

It can be done.  It is part of the canon that it has been done.  It will be done
 if the costs justifies it, but that probably won\'t be very often.

Hah!  Sure -- it\'s the best evidence we\'ve got for the Imperial Army 
structure questions.  (It\'s a different thread, but you did ask....)  :)

The counters in 5FW represent the Imperial forces that are space-mobile; 
in other words, planetary army formations are only represented where 
they have been "imperialized" and released to Imperial deployment.  
(Someone else can look at planets, if they want!)  What does the 
interstellar government have in the primary theater of operations?

* Huscarles: 
     One elite regiment, tech-15, heavy lift infantry, deployed into 
     its\' six battalions.  (4518th "Duke Regina\'s Own".)  Details of 
     composition are in _Spinward Marches Campaign_.  Originally 
     Imperial Marines.
             
* Marines: 
     Seven regiments, two of them elite, all tech-15.  
     
No other large forces loyal directly to the Imperium are elites.

* Regular Army:
     Eight field armies, six corps, eight divisions, four brigades, four
     regiments.  75% tech-15, 25% tech-14.  Regiments are mainly drop 
     troops.  Brigades are all lift infantry.
     
* Colonial Forces:
     RESERVES: Three field armies, six corps, five brigades, one 
        regiment.  TL 10 to 15, average 12 to 13. Larger formations tend 
        to better equipped.  The regiment is a tech-15 heavy lift 
        infantry unit, however!
     PLANETARY:  Two field armies, nine corps, two divisions, one 
        brigade, one battalion.  TL 8 to 13, average 10 to 11.   The 
        tech-8 unit is the Esalin Mechanized Infantry Division.  
        (Remember the "UN peacekeepers"?)  Both armies are from Porozlo 
        -- the only world represented twice!  Assumed to be 
        "imperialized" planetary forces since all here have planets 
        for identifiers.
    Again, all brigades are lift infantry.
    
* Mercenaries:  Yes, the Imperium has this nasty little habit....
     One division, one brigade, one regiment, seven battalions.
     TL 12 to 16, average 14.  Five of the battalions are elites,
     including the tech-16 unit. 

The marines are in first, easy to move to trouble spots, and are better
equipped and have higher morale, but most of the force is in the Army.
(Also note, because of this, the marines might get used more in 
"peacetime".  Remember too, the technological background of the Marches 
when considering the state of equipment in the regular and reserve 
forces.)

Yes -- at the corps or army level.  But for best effectiveness, expect 
to see the battalions to be a bit more specialized in their training.  
Think about what such a capability would require.

Usually deployed as regiments.  When the 4518th was given to Baron 
Regina, it was composed of two battalions of lift infantry, one of lift 
cavalry, and one of jump troops.  It probably still follows Marine 
doctrine.  There, some artillery is attached to the infantry/drop 
troops, some to regimental.  HQ also gets a fighter squadron and an 
_ortillery_ (planetary bombardment) squadron.  Organization seems
to follow the modern Western model closely.

Makes sense.  The _Kinunir_ is the closest thing that I can think of 
that\'s been seen, but it\'s just not adequate.

against the Virus?  What kind of fleet do you build?  Without getting
into the heavy specifics of weapons (I\'ll leave that to those more
talented, interested and experienced in ship design),  I\'ll discuss the
military issues faced by such a defensive blockade and the most economic
means of resolving such issues.

First, let\'s consider the problems imposed by Vampire ships:

1. Scope of task: You need to produce a complete blockade in systems at 
   least six parsecs deep all along the perimeter.  Based on the map in TNE,
   this is a line some 62 parsecs long in 1200.  Sorry that I don\'t have a 
   Deneb map, but assuming that the density of systems is the same as the
   Spinward Marches, that\'s some 70 systems total that the Regency needs to
   garrison.  This does not include systems that the Zhodani watch in    Chronor
   and Jewell.  Nor does it include anything on the Spinward edge of the 
   Regency - as if the Regency would not fear infection from any Virus ships
   having crept across the J5 route from Aslani space or through Zhodani 
   space having made the trip around the Windhorn.  Nor does it include
   naval forces arrayed against piracy or other external threats - like the
   Aslan ihatei from the Trojan Reach or the Zhodani Consulate.  

   Nor does it include guarding the dark between the stars.  Vessels must
   patrol these places, but bases in all the empty hexes is simply too 
   expensive.  
   
   Why must you guard 6 parsecs in depth?  To stop penetration by a J6       ves
sel.  Why must you patrol the empty parsecs?  Its too easy for a 
   squadron of vessels to piggyback fuel to deep space jumps and pierce
   the blockade. 

   The final threat, of course, cannot be effectievly guarded against:
   misjump.  Given a few hundred ships attenpting to misjump, a few will 
   pop in the middle of the Regency.  You know, those "safe" areas without
   excessive impediment to travel so life can pretend its still the 3rd
   Imperium.

   All it takes is one to get through and plant its eggs.

   Note: if you examine the maps in Survival Margin, the safe area of the
   Regency was a much smaller area that did not include the Deneb Sector! If 
   that map was accurate (why else would GDW print it? :-), the Regency        p
ulled out of areas too large for it to defend and left them to the         tende
r mercies of the Virus!  That must have been delightful PR for
   Norris\'s administration!)
   
2. Location: Given the enormity of space, with the only limit on entry into 
   a system being the 100-diameter limit, there is an awful lot of space 
   in any star system that a Vampire can appear in.  I\'m not that up on the
   technical end of MT, but from FF&S, you will need a fair number of

3. Identification:  Vampire ships can be of any class, from a 100-ton
   Scout vessel to a 1,000,000-ton battle rider (complete with Batron
   attached!).  They do not appear or act different than a human-run 
   ship.  Since TL8 computers can do decent voice synthesis, I\'ll
   assume higher TLs have no such problems.  So, how do you tell a
   Vampire (or worse yet in the beginning a mere Virus carrier) from
   an uninfected ship?  Every ship entering a system must be interrogated,  
   investigated, and determined if it is safe or not - and quickly.
   (in fact TNE says "the first thing a ship sees when it comes out of jump
   space in Regency space is a naval vessel").

4. Defense: Full defense is just about impossible.  Consider - at least 
   in the beginning of the "infection" period when the number of Vampires is
   thickest and defenses against infection are nil, a Vampire simply needs     t
o enter the system and broadcast (download) eggs to any number of
   computer-linked communications systems.  A 1000AU radio is the most 
   dangerous weapon aboard a Vampire - it can start broadcasting as soon
   as it arrives in system to any number of accidental listeners!     
   Certainly, it can begin broadcasting before it can be detected.

   (Ah, three cheers for Imperial standardization.  Mr Virus can easily
   enough write and quickly down load small programs to locate one of
   the few popular imperial comm systems, issue the (well-known) 
   commands to have the comm system point an ear up to the sky, and
   let out a "ready" peep.  While the inspector ships are still closing in 
   on the new ship, it is already down-loading itself to awaiting, open
   systems on the planet.)

   Defense must be prepared to destroy ANY and every ship that enters the
   system.  And any ship that may be in the system before it can leave in
   the event of infection.

Now, for the defenders, there are a few advantages:

1.  Most infected vessels are not military; they should be defeatable by
    light military forces.

2.  The effect of Viral infection is not immediate.  by the late 1130s, the
    Regency scientists should have figured out a bit about how the Virus
    works - enough to have figured out how to detect it dormant in a 
    computer system.  Shutting down the system and removing Mr. Virus at 
    that point may be annoying and inconvenient, but it will beat the hell 
    out of genocide and mass destruction!

3.  After the first ten years or so, the threat should thin out enormously
    as Vampires wear out and become non-functional.



Next, How do you defend a planetary system?

Given the Regency fleets I identified in msg 605/7586 let\'s look at how
these naval forces might be organized in TNE.

I propose, rather than organization based upon the sectors of the Imperial
era, that the Regency Navy will be organized along the `fronts\' of the
Regency: Zhodani, Vargr, Virus and Aslan *ihatei*.  This leads to the
following fleet organization (I\'m going to adopt Steve Charlton\'s
terminology):

The Spinward Fleet (4 groups, 250 ships)
212th Group (Jewell)             213th Group (Regina)
193rd Group (Vilis)              18th Group (Lanth)

The Coreward Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
214th Group (Aramis)             23rd Group (Rhylanor)
194th Group (Pretoria)           211th Group (Lamas)
195th Group (Sabine)             257th Group (Inar)

The Rimward Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
43rd Group (Lunion)              208th Group (Five Sisters)
100th Group (Glisten)            201st Group (Pax Rulin)
202nd Group (Gazulin)            203rd Group (Sindal)

The 1st Quarantine Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
151st Froup (Antra)              61st Group (Million)
125th Group (Dunmag)             88th Group (Atsah)
154th Group (Usani)              183rd Group (Geniishir)

The 2nd Quarantine Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
260th Group (Zeng)               55th Group (Kamlar)
184th Group (Vast Heavens)       204th Group (Tobia)
74th Group (Macon)               128th Group (Usher)

The Regent\'s Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
73rd Group (Mora)                207th Group (Trin\'s Veil)
196th Group (Star Lane)          258th Group (Vincennes)
193rd Group (Gulf)               19th Group (Vestus)

Subsector names merely reflect the Imperial era origins of the groups
and may or may not correspond to New Era designations.  (For example,
one might expect the 203rd Group to now patrol Regency worlds in District
268.)

Does anyone have any idea what the percentage breakdown might be for
battle, cruiser and assault (carrier) squadrons within a `typical\' group?

In the above organization one might expect the Spinward, Rimward and
Regent\'s Fleets to have a higher percentage of BatRons while the Coreward
and Quarantine Fleets would have more CruRons.  AssRons would probably
be concentrated in the Regent\'s Fleet.

Comments, critiques, suggestions and questions are welcomed and encouraged.

    'body' => 'Recently there\'s been much talk about CT/MT material (or lack thereof) on 
the TML. So, I decided to send off this ship from Steve\'s TCS game:

    The _Mikhail Gorbachev_ class Battlecruiser
    
BC-1 Mikhail Gorbachev BC-P6357F3-490100-60E09-0 MCr46,662.7 50,000 tons
batteries bearing       8  8 1 6  Crew=395.
batteries         A  A 1 8  TL=12.
Low=137. Cargo=644. Fuel=18,500. EP=3500. Agility=5. Marines=150

Notes: All lasers are pulse lasers. Ship has frozen watch, fuel scoops, 
and purification plant.

This is the original design of the _Gorbachev_ class. 24 of these ships 
were built by the Naval Forces of Neubayern, all named for political 
leaders of twentieth-century Earth. This version of the class saw action 
against Amondiage and Sansterre during the Old Islands War, and against 
New Colchis during the Topas War. Following the Topas War, Alliance 
Supreme Commander Sir Isaac Connor described the class as being the 
"workhorse of the Alliance Fleet."

Following the war of 5627, the ships of the class underwent the Series A 
upgrade, which equipped the key ships of the NFN with Alliance technology.

BC-1 Series A BC-P6357H3-490300-(ND)000A-0 MCr42,370.9 50,000 tons
batteries bearing    8   12    4 Crew=370.
batteries      A   13    5 TL=12(14).
Low=510. Cargo=699. Fuel=18,500. EP=3500. Agility=5. Marines=650.

Notes: All lasers are beam lasers. Ship has frozen watch, scoops, plant. 
The refit cost MCr1,351.24 per ship, and took 14 weeks.

The Series A _Gorbachev_ was one of the first warships to incorporate the 
heavy laser technology developed by Sansterre. The letter-code bay 
weapons and highly efficient spinal mounts made possible by this 
improvement in laser technology gave Alliance ships a powerful punch at 
close range.

These refitted ships were also among the first to carry TL14 letter-code 
missile bays. The combination of a letter-code bay and nuclear missiles 
gave the _Gorbachev_, and latter Alliance ships, the ability to crack 
even the heaviest armour.

The Series A version of this battlecruiser saw action in the Serendip 
War. The entire class participated in the Second Battle of Neubayern, 
when the Serendip Belt tried to depopulate Neubayern, and five of them 
were lost or damaged beyond repair.

The surviving 19 ships were among those which fled to Home and Sansterre 
during the Imperial occupation, where they underwent the Series B refit 
which incorporated the tremendous advances the Alliance had made in 
weapons and propulsion.

This covers the "history" of the _Gorbachev_ class. I\'ve got plans to 
write up the "current" status of the class (along with the Series B 
version) in the world of the Islands Cluster, but make no promises as to 
when this will be...

I\'ll post other NFN designs from the Alliance in days to come, unless of 
course you don\'t want me to. :-)

I have been following the earth colonies discussion.  I think its a great 
idea but you dont need me to tell you so.  I once ran a camp with 
quasi traveller rules (before I had ever seen traveller...I used 
champions hybrid rules) based upon an extensive system of earth colonized 
worlds (100+).  I just joined TML a couple o weeks ago and have some 
questions regarding the Earth Colonies.

Questions-What is the status(if any) of Extraterrestrial Humans or non 
Human sentients?

Could someone post a five point (or more at one line per point) synopsis 
of the Earth Colonies background.  I mean fundamental things.  I can get 
details (historical, political,etc) from the discussions and submissions. 

I would love to join this discussion.  Even if youre only using Terrans, 
there is enough variety in Terran culture to more than satisfy a 
backgrounds need for contrast, depth, and variety.

        Has anyone read Orson Scott Card\'s novels, "Speaker for the Dead" and
"Xenocide" ?   Card writes about a disease (the Descolada) that causes
massive mutations in all the life forms it infects.

************************SPOILER ALERT************************

        IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THESE NOVELS, THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WILL
SPOIL SOME SURPRISE PLOT TWISTS.

        The Descolada massively alters the ecosystem of any world it may
happen to be deposited on, making the world more easily exploitable for
the disease\'s creators. You can think of it as a slow and painfull
biological version of the "Genesis Device" from "Star Trek II, Wrath of
Khan". As is the case with ST2\'s Genesis, the Descolada is also a powerful
weapon.
        The Descolada makes for a terrifying enemy, but it is not
magical, and it can be fought. It can also destroy entire civilizations
(and species) if it is not fought successfully. It can do much of what
the virus is supposed to do, and Card has already written two novels on
it, working out many of its implications. This might be useful to
someone trying to create Wilds in his Third Imperium campaign.

Agreed.  The Sword World fleets (two of which were in _5FW_) seemed
similarly small, but I forget the figures offhand.

About the multi-world governments in the old Imperium: they weren\'t
_quite_ illegal.  Worlds were allowed to sponsor colonies on nearby
worlds, to get them going.  A small amount of internal conflict was
allowed, but the second things looked like they might get out of 
hand, the Navy and Marines were called in.  Some cultural regions
had close pre-Imperial ties, but were usually forced to officially
act through the Imperial bureaucracy at the multi-world level.  It\'s
possible that some exceptions were allowed where it served the 
government\'s interests.  For instance, the Vegans were given that
huge autonomous region near Sol to counterbalance the Solomani
Confederation.  They were even allowed to maintain an internal 
navy under their control at TL14+, many ships of which were retired
second-rate Imperial vessels, which admittedly often had the most
powerful weapons downgraded.  So it\'s possible the Imperium did 
this very occasionally on a smaller scale -- but they kept a real
close watch on them.  They probably didn\'t have too much trouble.

After all, the Imperium was pretty good at object lessons.  What
they did to Ilelish during the early years is an example.  I\'m
sure that when the Solomani lost Earth, quite a few people breathed
a sigh of relief that the Imperium didn\'t dare to put the Terran
tropical regions to the nuclear sword, even after an evac.

Yeah, I killed the Emperor in one pre-MT campaign, too.  A friend
of mine had just gotten the GDW Zhodani, and I read it cover to
cover and was inspired.  This was the high-power campaign with a
PC playing the "Duke of Egyrn", so I appointed him special ambassador
to Zhodane with instructions to discuss the "Pa\'an Question" which
was unresolved after the 5FW.  (He started out as an IISS Imperial
Warrant psionic agent, and worked his way up the noble ladder over   
the course of the campaign, so he was a vehemently anti-Zho psi,
which threw another wrench into the works.)

Essentially, over the course of negotiations, he and his retinue
got to know the Zhodani, and slowly began to "go native".  Then
the news of Strephon\'s assassination reached Zhodane.  When it
became clear that the Zhodani were more interested in the Core
Expedition (which he had known nothing about, of course) than
the attack on the Marches he expected, he became very confused. 

A replacement arrived to discuss the new situation, and he was   
recalled.  The Imperium collapsed into a Second Civil War, the
Marches dominated by a "Regina Free State" around Norris.  So 
he ended up working to stabilize the area behind the claw....
As I recall, Strephon was killed circa 1117 or 1118, so the
Zhodani found out circa 1118-1120.  It\'s been a while.

The bizarre thing is, I didn\'t really _plan_ any of these new
developments in advance, they just sort of *happened* as I went
along, because they seemed to fit the plot so well.

I knew the scenario had worked because afterward, the PC playing
the Duke came up to me and said, "God, Steve, you\'ve not only got 
me *liking* the Zhodani, I might want to ally with them!  The Zho 
are either *incredible* propogandists, or I\'ve lost my mind!" :)
Best campaign I ever ran.  High power campaigns can be fun!

Not at TL 15 (or 18 for that matter) to detect more than the presence of
the star.  It has nothing to do with TL and everything to do with signal
differentiation.  At those distances, all you\'d receive is light sent from a 
point source.  All signals from that system would appear as the same signal.


>If this is so, how do I explore new territory?

That\'s easy:  pick coordinates well beyond the 100 diam limit of the star (1000
is a good choice).  Odds are very good that you won\'t bump into the gravity
well of a planet.  Head slowly toward (take a month or two) the star and 
examine it to determine the system\'s ecliptic plane.  Then examine the 
ecliptic plane for planets. As you drift in, you will get more data and figure
out the orbits of the planets.

That\'s part of what the ISS used to do.  No one said all Scout Service work
was exciting.

Next time, someone can use your data to determine where in orbit the planets
will be, and where is a safe jump point.

Hey! I just got an idea for system defense!  Build LARGE artificial grav
generators.  Something Bship sized should be able to generate a large moon-sized
G well.  In war, you can move a few around your system around the 100 diam 
limit of your mainworld and disrupt those coming in - except your folks who 
you can tell where these items and their masses are placed.

I vented once, and only once.  I feel no need to do so again.

Someone give Jeff Davis Loren\'s address or GDW_Support\'s address and let
him ask there and save us the venting.

My apologies to Jeff Davis who is probably quite nice and is quite welcome
here.  He just asked a decent question just as the round of roiling was 
quieting down.

Unfortunately, this question will continue to be asked - and answered with
equal vehemence on both sides.

And for the record, I did not buy and will not buy TNE because I don\'t like
the changes made to the setting. I believe the leap to TNE was made because
GDW had two purposes:  1. They wanted to upgrade the rule set to their set of
House Rules (used with TW:2000, cadillacs & dinos, & Dark Conspiracy)
2.  They wrote themselves into a corner with the Rebellion and wanted a fresh
start.  Some folks like it, and others do not.

Not meaning any disrespect but would that make them Latter Day
Travellers?  BTW has anyone else noticed the recent news release from
Iran.  Their High Ayatollah has decreed that it is sacrilege for muslims
to watch TV via sattelite.


SPLITTING GROUP

I am not in favor of splitting the group.  I have CT, Mt. & TNE and have
played all incarnations starting w. CT in the eqarly \'80s.  I enjoy
reading the thought\'s others have regarding all types of Traveller as
well as both official and individual campaigns.  The use of identifying
headers seems a brilliant idea.  If you don\'t play the game, ignore the
message and why flame the other system when the bandwidth could be
better used to crow about the system you\'re fond of using.


DEEP SPACE STATIONS: (in a Steve Urquel voice) "Did I do that?"  At
least I think I mentioned something about them that started this round
of discussion.  IMHO DSS\'s can make economic sense given the right set
of circumstances (distances of systems and the political/economic
situation of those systems) as well as military sense.

I can not remember (in CT, MT, or TNE) anything from GDW indicating the
mechanics of how a ship navigates (astrogates for us Latter Day
Travellers) through jump space.  I can think of three methods:

1) A vector (distance & direction) is always directly related to
jumpspace navigation; if I wish to jump two parsecs 270 degrees from my
current forward position the parameters necessary to achieve that can be
directly calculated.

2) Jumps are made toward gravity sinks.  When I start to enter jump
space the ship is attracted to gravity nodes - the navigator allocates
the proper amount of enery to drop out of jumpspace outside 100
diameters to avoid merging with heavenly bodies.  Or as Han Solo put it,
"It\'s no mean trick.  Be nice if we rushed it and passed right through a
star or some other friendly spatial phenom like a black hole.  That
would end our trip real quick."

3) Jumps might be calculated toward objects emitting sufficient
radiation (for a sufficiently long enough time - at least a dozen years
or more) to be detected by starship sensors and used to lock in a
course.  Obviously a DSS would not emit enough radiation nor would it be
in existence for a long enough period of time if it did.

Looking at the "official" evidence either methods 2 or 3 seem to be the
correct method, probably 2 since gravitational fields are specified as
being involved in the procedure (one must be at a sufficient distance to
avoid having gravity interfere with the jumpdrive.

As was pointed out during the 5FW neither side made use of DSS\'s and
while the 3I & Zhos may be a lot of things neither group would be likely
to pass up any advantage, no matter how risky.

Thank you David Johnson for the kind comments.  You are quite correct
regarding dispatching jump drones.  Initially the procedure was to await
the outcome of hostile actions before launching drones but after the
Rape of Trin RQS Expedition Leader David Johnson brought this matter to
the attention of the RQS command which swiftly altered the procedures to
launch drones if a ship enters within 100 diameters of a fuel source
without acknowledging commo contact or as soon as hostile actions break
out.  Possibly this minor procedural fauz pas is responsible for the
Virus penetration to Trin but if so it has never been made known to the
public.


bonnevil@mermaid.micro.umn.edu (Steven M Bonneville) points out
correctly that the RQS also patrols the Zho & other spinward borders.
This is true but the RQS only maintains light assets (mostly inspection
launches) for inspections while the Navy maintains a strong presence in
these areas.  Naval ships are called upon to enforce the Quarantine
procedures should firepower be required.


L\'oeul d\'Dieu/Spinward Marches (3010 B98A510-B)
  While not a major world this system became the Patrol\'s base of ops in
275-1120 and thereby deserves some attention.  When Norris established
the Quarantine (312-1130) the Patrol was combined with part of the
Regency Interstellar Scout Service (Exploration and External Mapping
branches) to form the Regency Quarantine Service (RQS).  The base then
became an important asset of the RQS.

I think we\'re all on similar wavelengths regarding deep-space jumps,
although we all have taken different approaches to the seemingly
conflicting data about them.

I think we\'re agreed on the following "facts":

o Deep-Space Jumps ARE allowed
o Deep-Space refueling stations DO exist
o Deep-Space refueling stations ARE NOT extremely common
o Large distances (eg: Great Rift) DO present an obstacle to travel
o Blockades (eg: Regency) ARE possible
o Stellar and planetary bodies DO affect jump (eg: 100 diameter limit)

If anyone else has any facts to add, please do.  But take note, I
have avoided using obscure references as well as many not-so-obscure
rules references so that I can generalize.

To me, a natural conclusion from all of these facts is that jumps to
deep space are somehow very difficult and/or risky.  This is not the
only conclusion at which you could arrive, but it makes sense to me.

Another suggestion has been that it is simply too expensive to use
multiple jumps (for traders) or to set up deep-space refueling
stations (for the military).  I don\'t think this reconciles all of
the facts, for reasons I\'ve already stated.

====================

I am now done talking about the effects of the background, game
mechanics, etc.  The rest of this is merely a suggestion, which
doesn\'t come from the rule book, so don\'t start quoting me page
numbers from books I probably don\'t have. :-)  I\'d better give
that a few more smileys: :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)

====================

My interpretation has been that gravity plays an integral part in
jumps, such that it is difficult to jump to interstellar space.
I am now inclined to revise this interpretation so that gravity
wells are REQUIRED as destinations of any jump.

There is plenty of interstellar dark matter, so deep-space jumps
would still be possible, although the difficulty of finding such
matter may change throughout the galaxy (eg: there might be less
in the Great Rift, and the Regency might have cleared it out at
the border).  Also, interpretations of how much matter is needed
may vary (eg: do you need something the size of a comet? will a
dust cloud do?).  These two things would affect whether deep-space
jump points are common or are well-guarded secrets at different
places in the galaxy.

This also helps me justify the way mis-jumps work.  I avoided
mentioning this earlier, since it opens up a whole new can of
worms (intentional mis-jumps: JUST SAY NO! :-) :-) :-).

In general, I disagree based upon the Imperial naval tradition discussed
in the *Spinward Marches Campaign*.  It is important to maintain the
tradition of a military unit so I doubt *any* unit would be disbanded
unless it had suffered a *particularly* stunning defeat.  The units
fighting the Aslan *ihatei* most probably were not *destroyed* in a pitched
battle but rather fought a series of engagements from which they were
forced to withdraw.  A similar situation would have occurred on the Vargr
front.

With this in mind I would expect *all* of the fleets to have survived in
some form or another.  This would permit them to be reinforced and rebuilt
by the New Era.  Recall that I mentioned the subesctor associations merely
to indicate the Rebellion-era origins of the fleets.

On another note, this entire issue of Aslan *ihatei*, Vargr and Virus
incursions into the Regency and subsequent borders must be resolved.  I\'ll
try to start that effort in another post.

> However, If the Aslan Ihati and the Regency are at peace in the New Era,

It\'s my belief (desire?) that many of the *ihatei* have been incorporated
into the Regency in those former regions of the Domain that were occupied/
settled during the Rebellion era.

Remember, I\'m the guy who never bought the idea of Vargr incursions into
the Regency in the first place.  It\'s my view that a clever Regent ought
to have been able to keep the Vargr at bay by fostering their inherent 
instability.  (Some folks have claimed this policy would facilitate the
spread of Virus in the Extents.)  In any event, I would expect the Regency
to have reclaimed any territory lost to the Vargr during the Rebelion era
by TNE.

With the *rapproachment* between the Zhodani and the Regency during TNE I
would expect the Sword Worlds to be much less of a threat without the
support of their Zhodani patrons.  (Much like Cuba now.)

The relationship between the Rebellion-era Patrol, the Quarantine Service
and the Regency Navy is one still to be discerned.  Wasn\'t the Patrol
originally staffed by Aslan?  This is why I felt many of the *ihatei* have
been incorporated into the Regency.  Does any TNE material mention the
fate of the Patrol in TNE?

The three Reft fleets on the spinward side of the Great Rift are clearly
safe from any sort of claim by Dulinor.  Their challenge was the *ihatei*
as well.

Thanks.  Yours too.

Well, on a whim I\'ve reidentified it as the 211th Group which at least doesn\'t
conflict with any Regency units.

These are very important issues for our Regency sourcebook project *Shall
Not Perish*.  These problems with borders in the Domain/Regency actually
pre-date the Rebellion era discrepancies noted above.  (You\'ll recall my
questions about the discrepancies in the Border Worlds in Sword Worlds
subsector after the 5FW.)

What I\'d like to do is to try to identify *all* `official\' maps of the Domain
of Deneb (Spinward Marches, Deneb Sector, Trojan Reach and Reft Sector) that
either show borders of world allegiance codes from *Supplement 3: Spinward
Marches* to whatever has appeared for the Regency in TNE.  This would include
everything - like the map of Pax Rulin subsector in *Leviathan*.  I\'d like
to identify the source of the map, the `real\' date it was published, and
it\'s supposed date in the campaign.  (And please, let\'s try to be more
specific than just `Rebellion-era\'.)

I\'ll examine whatever maps I have over the weekend.  Rodge and Ed, will you
give us the appropriate sources of the citations you used above?  Anyone
else, please contribute as you can.

In addition to identifying sources, we need to start to get a handle on the
discrepancies.  If possible, when you post your sources, please try to
identify as many discrepancies as possible.  Give world name and hex location
and whatever border/alignment discrepancy exists.

I\'ll serve a coordinator of this effort.  It shouldn\'t take but a few days
if enough folks participate.  Once we\'ve gathered all the data I\'ll post
a summary and then we\'ll try to resolve the discrepancies for *Shall Not
Perish*.

Let\'s get busy!

Notes: This ship has a frozen watch, fuel scoops, and purification plant.

This is the original version of the _Excelsior_ class. The NFN built 15 
of these ships, most of them named for historical battleships. The 
exception was the lead ship, which was named for a fictitious ship class 
from Star Trek. This version of the ship saw action during the Old 
Islands War and the Topas War--following the Topas War, FAdm Connor 
described it as "the best battleship in the Islands."

This class also received the Series A refit immediately after the wars.

     Y=35, Z=50
Notes: This ship has frozen watch, scoops, plant. The refit cost 
MCr1,887.6 per ship and took 15 weeks.

The Series A _Excelsior_ wasn\'t a major improvement over the original 
version. The Admiralty felt that upgrading the battleships further would 
delay improvements on other ships unacceptably, so the upgrade was 
postponed.

The battleship _Musashi_ was officially handed over to the Alliance Navy 
in 5629, and served as the flagship of the Alliance for several years. 
The Series A version of the battleship saw action in the Serendip War. 13 
of the ships participated in the defence of Neubayern, and two of them 
were lost or damage beyond repair.

The 13 surviving _Excelsiors_ fled to the safe worlds when the Imperials 
arrived. During the Occupation, the ship received a major refit, 
effectively becoming a new class of ships.

Okay, here\'s my first take on a map.  Y\'all can use this as a guide for
reporting on your own maps.

Source: *Spinward Marches Campaign* sourcebook
Published: c1985
Game date: c1111

This sourcebook contains two maps of the Spinward Marches: one inside the
front cover (8.5 x 11) and one centerfold (11 x 17) that are essentially
identical.  The borders show every world in Regina, Aramis, Lanth, Rhylanor,
Lunion, Mora, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil as within the Imperium.  Imperial
borders in Jewell, Vilis and Five Sisters are `consistent\' with previously
published works.  Although they conflict with the UWP data that appears
in this sourcebook, the maps do not show the Border Worlds in Sword Worlds
subsector but rather show the united Sword Worlds like previous maps.  Two
worlds in District 268, Mertactor 1537 and Mille Falcs 1637, are shown as
part of the Imperium which matches the UWP data.

The sourcebook includes UWP data for all worlds in the sector.  This data
shows alignment codes for the Border Worlds for the following worlds in
Sword Worlds subsector:

1424 Beater (mentioned as capital of the Border Worlds in text on P17)
1522 Dyrnwyn
1523 Durendal
1524 Hofud
1525 Sting (mentioned as capital of the Border Worlds in text on P19)
1526 Steel
1626 Iron
1627 Bronze
1628 Mithril

Separate text also mentions that there are ten Border Worlds which is
consistent with this list.

Clearly, this source contradicts itself but other than the confusion about
the Border Worlds capital this might be explained by the use of an earlier
map here.

Because there has been some mention of Regency expansion into District 268
in TNE I\'ve included the following list of worlds there shown in the UWP
data as `Client States\', presumably of the Imperium.

1132 Bowman
1138 Tarsus
1232 Walston
1237 Collace
1238 Pavabid
1337 Judice
1340 Motmos
1434 Tarkine
1435 Dallia
1532 Elixabeth
1631 Talchek
1632 Milagro

That covers this source.  Let\'s see the rest of them!

Welcome to the Sword Worlds Development League, Cynthia!  Thanks a bunch
for some really great stuff on Sacnoth.  We\'ve only got 22 more worlds

This may be what you\'ve said but I just want to get clear that the *JTAS*
Contact piece says very specifically that this Teutonic heritage is
merely `cultural\' and that the Sword Worlds enjoy the full range of
Solomani *ethnic* diversity.

So your work represents the post-5FW era.  Have you brought Sacnoth up
to TNE?  Where do you stand on the capital of the Sword Worlds in TNE?
Does Sacnoth have a chance?  :-)

Is this *TCS* information?  Didn\'t you say somewhere else (maybe you didn\'t,
I can\'t find it now) that Sacnoth\'s shipyard could only build 5000-ton ships?
If so, where do the larger ships mentioned above get built?
  
Some great work.  And once again, welcome to the `club\'.  :-)

Okay, here goes (but no promises of brevity):

Who: The Commonwealth of Earth, an interstellar state headed by Earth.
  Several interstellar entities known as Colonial States headed by worlds
  originally settled in a sub-light diaspora from Earth that began in the
  24th Century AD.  Major Colonial States are:
    Empire of Aztlan
    Abrahamic Synod
    Federation of Nyanza
    Ouroran Community
  Several other minor Colonial States exist.
  A basic premise is that Humans have finally `recognized\' Dolphin
  intelligence and most of these Terran states enjoy integrated Dolphin-
  Human societies.
  The two spacefaring extraterrestrial sophont species that have been
  encountered: the Aeroi and the Meren.
What: The Commonwealth of Earth, the major Colonial States and the Aeroi
  and Meren are at TL 13.  Minor Colonial States exist a one or two tech
  levels below this.  Many independent worlds and mini-states exist at
  a variety of tech levels.
  The motivation for the 24th Century diaspora was a severe ecological
  catastrophe.  Coping with this catastrophe on Earth provided time for
  the Colonial States to establish themselves as major interstellar
  players.
  The Earth Colonies campaign uses a 3D campaign area based upon the
  `real\' system locations from the 2300AD "Near Star List".
Where: the Colonies Sphere a 30 parsec *sphere* centered on Earth that
  represents the extent of exploration by the Commonwealth Scout Service.
  Other Colonial States have ventured beyond this region.  Both the Aeroi
  and the Meren originate from beyond the Sphere.  (Also known as the
  Earth Colonies sector.)
When: The dawn of the 31st Century AD.

> I would love to join this discussion.

Jump right in!  Keep in mind though that development of the Earth Colonies
campaign is handled by the Earth Colonies Development League (ECDL) off-
line through the newsletter *Melbourne Times*.

Keep in mind that the Earth of the Earth Colonies is not the same as the
Terra of the Solomani.  The Earth Colonies campaign is a completely original
campaign background. 

Happy Travelling,

Okay, let\'s look at the Sword Worlds Navy again.  I know these rules are
for individual worlds but let\'s try looking at the Sword Worlds as a whole
first.  Let\'s assume a `subsector government\' of 5 (feudal technocracy).
The Sword Worlds population (c1120) is approximately 30 billion.  These
parameters give:

Budget: cr500 x .95 x 30,000,000,000 = 14,240 Gcr
Capacity: (30,000,000,000 x .95)/1000 = 28.5 Mt

Now I don\'t have much idea how to convert this to ships and squadrons but
just using the tonnage figure and an estimate of 50,000 tons per `capital\'
ship gives 570 ships!  No wonder the Imperium hasn\'t conducted a pacification
campaign against the Sword Worlds!

Either you *TCS* wonks have to help me out here or we need to begin to
accept that the *TCS* rules just aren\'t compatible with the naval forces
that appeared in *5FW*.  (And start arguing about which to throw out?  :-)

    'body' => 'Subject: *Shall Not Perish* - RICE Papers

I\'ve been watching the growing information about the "Regency
Sourcebook" (Working title, which I _like_, "Shall Not Perish") and 
decided to explore some aspects of the Regency that were never 
really explored even when the Third Imperium Chamber of Commerce 
published little black books.  The occasional Contact article in 
JTAS was good, but insufficient.  So, I decided to pursue the 
_cultural_ aspects of the Regency.  What my research revealed is 
introduced in the following document, RICE Paper #0000.
- ----
RICE Paper #0: Introduction


1.  What is RICE?

RICE, the Regency Institute for Cultural Education, is a
non-governmental organization dedicated to increasing the level
of knowledge and understanding of the various cultures that the
traveller may encounter within the Regency and in its immediate
neighbor stellar states.  This mission is carried out through
our efforts to keep the Regency Library Data network as
up-to-date as possible, and our distribution of information
directly to travellers on request, through such publications as
this series of RICE Papers, and our representatives at traveller
assistance centers, including, but not limited to, facilities
operated by the Travellers\' Aid Society.  We are funded by a
combination of tourism corporations, the Travellers\' Aid Society
and similar extra-Regency organizations, and private donations.


2.  The History of RICE.

When the borders of the Domain of Deneb were sealed late in
1129, the resulting panic caused an upsurge in isolationism, and
a general decrease in economic activity on the interstellar
level.  The Domain government, in an effort to prevent the
fragmentation of the Domain, instituted massive efforts to
promote interstellar tourism and commerce, and to publicize the
successful efforts of the Patrol (later the Regency Quarantine
Service) in preventing the infiltration of Virus into the
Domain.  One of these efforts was the Deneb Cultural Exchange
(DCE), which had much the same mission as RICE today.  However,
as a governmental agency, the information available was limited
to that which the various worlds of the Domain chose to make
available.  Simultaneously, the Travellers\' Aid Society created
the parallel Deneb Travellers\' Exchange (DTE), which made an
effort to get accurate information from field researchers, but
which was drastically underfunded, due to a dropoff in the level
of utilization of TAS facilities.  In 1145, after the
liberalization of the Domain government, and the subsequent
reorganization into the Regency, and rapprochement with the
Zhodani, Vargr, and Aslan, the DCE was privatized and operated
by a consortium of megacorporate tourism subsidiaries.  Shortly
thereafter, an agreement with the Travellers\' Aid Society
allowed the DCE and the DTE to share information and facilities.
In 1160, the arrangement was formalized, and RICE was created.
Now, we have been asked by various planetary and interstellar
governments to expand our target audience, from those who have
already decided that travelling is what they\'d like to do, to
the general public.  Thus, the RICE Papers, of which this is the
first.


3.  What Are the RICE Papers?

The RICE Papers were originally conceived of as a set of
pamphlets focussing on a single aspect of a culture that a
traveller should be aware of.  When we submitted several drafts
to various governments, we were advised that our original format
was indeed useful, but that we should also provide broad
overviews of the various planetary cultures, preferably in a
format that could give the reader an idea of what would
typically be encountered in the course of a visit to the culture
in question.  Thus, there will be two series of RICE Papers.
Numbered RICE Papers will provide the broad overview, while
lettered RICE Papers will cover one specific topic in somewhat
greater depth.  The lettered RICE Papers are actually associated
with a particular numbered RICE Paper, and the letter will be
prefixed by the number of the corresponding numbered RICE
Paper.  Thus, if RICE Paper #1643 is on the planet Ruie, then a
RICE Paper focussing specifically on the legal system on Ruie
might be RICE Paper #1643-A, and a RICE Paper focussing on local
cuisine might be RICE Paper #1643-B.


4.  How Do I Read a RICE Paper?

RICE Papers are mostly ordinary text narratives.  However, as a
convenience, we are also providing extended UWP data, in a
DGP-based format.  These should be interpreted as described
in Appendix A to this RICE Paper, and the text considered in
that light.  At the end of this document, we have appended a
sample extended UWP, with brief annotations.  Also, be aware
that information provided by a RICE Paper is correct according
to the best information available to us at the time of
publication.  Governments change, and information may be
misinterpreted by our field researchers.  It is recommended that
you verify any information that you feel may affect you both
before embarking on your trip, and before leaving the starport
extraterritoriality zone on your destination world.  While we
encourage people to leave the extraterritoriality zone and
immerse themselves in the local culture, we recognize that under
some circumstances it may be inadvisable to do so, and
acknowledge that one can get a taste of the local culture, and
have an enjoyable trip, without leaving the zone.


5.  How Do I Get the RICE Papers?

RICE Papers are placed on the Library Data network as they are
ready, and copies of the text can be retrieved from the network
databases as required.  There are future plans for making
hardcopy available, but these plans have not been finalized yet.


6.  When Will the RICE Paper for <insert chosen planet here> Be
    Available?

In order to get the highest quality reports from the field, we
have chosen not to require that a particular planet be done at a
particular time.  We do record requests, and, when demand
warrants, add requested planets to a list of the "Ten Most
Desired Destinations" distributed to all RICE Liaison Offices.
As field researchers choose to go to one of these planets, they
are removed from this list.  However, we do not require that a
researcher choose a planet from this list, and in fact, many of
our researchers will deliberately avoid any planet on the list,
preferring to search out that one particular undiscovered gem
that is well off the major trade routes.  We believe, as
indicated, that we will get better reports from this policy, and
that this will better serve those who are looking for a pleasant
and interesting trip.

         and sector coordinates, in parentheses

Line 2:  TAS Standard World Profile: starport, size, atmosphere,
         hydrosphere, population, government, law level, tech
         level, followed by types of military facilities on the
         world, trade classifications, population magnitude,
         number of planetoid belts (exclusive of the main
         world, if it is a belt), number of gas giants,
         allegiance, and the standard Hertzsprung-Russel
         stellar classifications for each star in the system.
         Use the standard interpretations for these figures.

Line 3:  Surface gravity, in standard g, followed by local day
         in hours:minutes:seconds, and local year in standard
         days, hours:minutes:seconds/local days,
         hours:minutes:seconds.  Normally, starships will
         gradually adjust their internal gravity and light/dark
         cycles to match the destination planet.  However, some
         people require more than the week of jump travel to
         adjust.  This information is provided to allow
         travellers to begin the adjustment process before
         embarking.

Line 4:  Atmospheric density in standard pressures, weather is
         either "natural" or "controlled"  This information is
         provided to allow adjustment prior and during travel.
         Note that atmospheric density significantly different
         from that which a traveller is used to may require the
         traveller to use assisted breathing apparatus.

Line 5:  Basic temperature, degrees Celsius, 35 degrees
         latitude, followed by the range in basic temperatures,
         expressed as (degrees per ~8 degrees latitude, followed
         by equatorial temp to polar temp), followed by the
         maximum change in temperature in the polar regions
         (maximum summer increase to maximum winter decrease,
         followed by latitude where seasonal temperature changes
         become noticeable).  Use this information and that in
         the next line when selecting clothes to pack.  On most
         worlds of technical level 8 or higher, indoor
         temperature is normally controlled to be within the
         range of 10 to 20 degrees.

Line 6:  The size of the daily variation in temperature.  This
         is the difference between the high and low for the day.

Line 7:  Classifications of products widely available for
         export.  These are listed in the order natural
         products; processed products; manufactured products;
         information.  Within a classification, products are
         separated by commas.  These are GENERAL CLASSES ONLY,
         representing the kinds of goods that the planet excels
         in producing, causing an export market.  Consult trade
         representatives to determine the availability and
         market for specific products.

Line 8:  Social classification.  There are three entries for
         this line.  First is progressiveness indicators,
         attitude/activity, then the aggressiveness indicators,
         attitude/activity, then the extensiveness indicators,
         global/interstellar.

Line 9:  The legal and technical profiles.  The legal profile
         consists of six entries, in the following order:
         overall law level, representing the likelihood of the
         traveller being required to experience one or more
         portions of the legal process; weapons law level,
         representing the restrictions on type, availability,
         and "carryability" of personal weapons by individuals
         not part of the planetary law enforcement agencies;
         trade law level, representing the level of restrictions
         placed on the exchange of property; commercial law
         level, representing the level of restrictions on doing
         business in general, including labor laws, zoning,
         permits, and so on; civil law level, representing the
         level of enforcement of restrictions on personal
         activity, and personal freedom level, representing the
         types and severity of restrictions on personal
         activity.  The technical profile consists of 14 entries, 
         as follows:  First, the range (high and low) of technology 
         commonly available on the planet.  Next, the technology 
         levels for Quality of Life: Energy production, computers 
         and robotics, Communications, Medicine, and Environment.  
         Next, the technology levels for transportation: Land, 
         Water, Air, and In-System Space.  Next, the _acknowledged_ 
         level of common military technology: personal and heavy, 
         and finally, the novelty tech level.  Items can be found 
         of the novelty tech level, but, as the name implies, they 
         are novelties, and not to be expected to be generally 
         available.  They are typically demonstration or 
         experimental models, or imported.

We believe that this is the minimum set of information needed to
alert the traveller to any general conditions that he needs to
be aware of.  Following this extended profile will be the text
of the RICE Paper, calling out the general characteristics of
the culture, and any noteworthy conditions or habits that can
help the traveller to understand the culture better, or to avoid
making mistakes that will insult the local population or involve
the traveller in legal action.
- ----
I\'m open to comments and questions on RICE Papers, and suggestions 
as to which planets to tackle.  At this point, I am using as a 
baseline the MegaTraveller UWP for the Spinward Marches, except for 
Regina Subsector (from TNE), and as I find MT-era or later docs for 
other sectors/subsectors of any of the Spinward States, I\'ll use 
them as baseline material.  For the record, if nobody has guessed, 
I am using DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook to flesh out the XUWP, 
and applying liberal amounts of imagination to convert the result 
into a RICE Paper.  Comments, as I said, are welcome, including 
even those comments that tell me to shut the hell up.  RICE Paper 
#0001 will be coming soon.

Yes but these subsectors also provides a \'Home port\' for these fleets.  This
is particularly important for crew with families and routine logistic support.
Not to mention that it\'s a great way for the region to benifite economically
from these ships.

Should not be too diffcult with out the Zhodani actively supporting the
incursions.  Also the Aslan ihatei units ought to give them an interesting
surprise.

I vaguely recall reading the same referance.  But considering the mission
of the Patrol as a centralized fast reaction force these two fleets will be
the idea core.

Over a period of 70 years I would imagine the incorporated ihatei units be
fairly evenly distributed throughout the Regency.  So between rebuilding the
reavaged fleets and setting up the Quarantine area the descendents of the
ihatei should be everywhere.

Also about five years ago at a Los Angeles Gaming convention I recall Loren
Wiseman mentioning the ideal way to deal with the ihatei is to trade land
grant for service.

***:Regarding Regency Maps

Here\'s a list of the border hex from the MT Box set (c 1987)

On the South (Aslan/Rimward) side:

1541,1540,1539,1538,1437,1337,1436,1435,1434,1535,1634,1735,1834,1934,

2637,2638,2739,2839,2940,3039,3040

Worlds bounded by these hex were suppose to be under control of the
Aslan ihatei.

Everytime I take a look at this I can only imagine that it\'s must\'ve been
one heck of a fight.

At the North (Vargr/Coreward) side:

2201,2202,2303,2402,2503,2504,2505,2506,2507,2607,2708,2807,2907,2906,

subsector)

      The _Berlin_ class Light Rider

BM-1 Berlin BM-K6068F3-C00100-00009-0 MCr10,780.7 10,000 tons
batteries bearing      A  Crew=440.
batteries        A  TL=12.
Low=220. Cargo=218. Fuel=800. EP=800. Agility=6. Marines=350.

Notes: Has a frozen watch, fuel scoops, and purification plant. This 
class normally operated in groups of four.

This is the original _Berlin_ class rider. 180 of these riders were 
built, and the class was originally meant to serve as part of the core of 
the NFN, along with the _Provence_ heavy riders. Riders of this class 
were named for cities on Earth.

The class saw extensive action during 5627. In the Old Islands War, it 
was found that the Amondiage _Sword_ class was almost perfect for 
fighting the _Berlin_. In addition, the weaknesses of the rider concept 
were dramatically displayed when half the NFN\'s riders were captured at 
the Third Battle of St. Genevieve because they couldn\'t retreat from the 
system. The disastrous showing of the riders during that war convinced 
the Admiralty to drop the rider concept, although riders would remain in 
service for several years yet.

During the Topas War, the _Berlin_ made just the opposite impression on 
the Serendip Belt when a Light Rider Squadron and a Cruiser Squadron tore 
up half the Belter Navy. The _Berlins_ of the Light Rider Squadron were 
captured, but the performance of the NFN ships so terrified the Belters 
that they later ran away rather than fight an Alliance force.

Following these wars, fourteen of the twenty _Berlins_ captured by the Belt 
were given to Topas to serve as the core of its Navy, and the other six 
were kept hidden by the Belt. In 5629, the NFN officially gave twenty of 
its _Berlins_ to the Alliance Navy.

In 5631, the NFN decided to give their remaining _Berlins_ a Series A 
refit. 60 riders received the refit before the Serendip War.

BM-1 Series A K6068H3-C00300-0000A-0 MCr10,755.6 10,000 tons
batteries bearing     A  Crew=440.
batteries       A  TL=12(14).

Notes: Has frozen watch, scoops, plant. The refit cost MCr347.6 per ship 
and took 9 weeks.

40 of the Series A riders, along with the 80 remaining original model 
_Berlins_, participated in the Second Battle of Neubayern, where the 
Missile-A bays of the refitted riders helped pulverize one of the Belter 
battleships. 73 of the riders were lost, however.

When the Imperials invaded, 20 Series A _Berlins_ were hidden in deep 
space. The rest of the class was scuttled (very visibly) in the Neubayern 
system to prevent capture by the Imperial Navy. When the Imperials were 
thrown out, the 20 _Berlins_ were reactivated to act as system defence 
boats for a few months and then were relegated to museums. They never saw 
action again.

Okay, so we have the Regency Navy (RN).  The Regency Army (RA) consists of the
traditional three force commands: Aerospace (COACC), Nautical, and Ground.
The Regency Quarantine Service (RQS) consists of assests originally gained from
the (mostly Aslan?) Domain Patrol and the DISS.  Is there still a scout
service in the Regency, an RISS?

Now that we\'ve seen the post-5FW era *Spinward Marches Campaign* borders and
allegiance data, let\'s compare the early Rebellion era information from
MegaTraveller.

Source: *MT Players\' Manual* rulesbook
Published: c1987
Game date: c1116

This rulesbook contains a map of the Spinward Marches  inside the
front cover (8.5 x 11).  The borders show every world in Regina, Aramis,
Lanth, Rhylanor, Lunion, Mora, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil as within the Imperium.  
Imperial borders in Jewell, Vilis and Five Sisters are `consistent\' with
previously published works.  The map shows the Border Worlds in Sword Worlds
subsector but adds two more members (Tyrfing 1324 and Sacnoth 1325) bringing
the total worlds up to twelve.  The two worlds in District 268, Mertactor 1537
and Mille Falcs 1637, are still shown as part of the Imperium.  There is
no UWP data in this book but a library data entry for the Spinward Marches
(P91) mentions the Border Worlds.

Three of the other MegaTraveller books, the *Referee\'s Manual*, the *Referee\'s
Companion* and the *Rebellion Sourcebook* do not have any Spinward Marches
border or allegiance data (except in Imperium-wide maps that are difficult
to read at that scale).

Source: *Imperial Encyclopedia* sourcebook
Published: c1987
Game date: c1118

The sourcebook includes UWP data for all worlds in the Spinward Marches.
This data shows alignment codes for the Border Worlds for the following
worlds in Sword Worlds subsector:

1324 Tyrfing (added since post-5FW era)
1325 Sacnoth (added since post-5FW era)
1424 Beater
1522 Dyrnwyn
1523 Durendal
1524 Hofud
1525 Sting
1526 Steel
1626 Iron
1627 Bronze
1628 Mithril

This data is consistent with the *MTPM* map and adds two more former
Sword Worlds to the Border Worlds.

The Imperial Client States in District 268 have been affected by the
invasion of the Aslan *ihatei*.  The following worlds are listed as
client states in *IE*:

1132 Bowman
1138 Tarsus
1232 Walston
1237 Collace
1238 Pavabid
1340 Motmos
1434 Tarkine
1532 Elixabeth
1631 Talchek
1632 Milagro

The new information in *IE* reflects the invasions of the Aslan *ihatei*
and the Vargr.  Thirty-nine worlds in District 268 and Glisten and Trin\'s
Veil subsectors have Aslan allegiance codes and 21 worlds in Regina and
Aramis have Vargr allegiance codes.  This information is not reflected
in the sector map that appears in the *Players\' Manual*.  The worlds
overrun by the Aslan are:

District 268
1337 Judice (was Imperial client state in post-5FW era)
1435 Dallia (was Imperial client state in post-5FW era)
1436 Talos
1537 Mertactor (was Imperial world in post-5FW era)
1634 Pagaton
1635 Binges
1637 Mille Falcs (was Imperial world in post-5FW era)

Glisten subsector (were all Imperial worlds in post-5FW era)
1736 Melior         1737 Egypt          1739 Aster
1836 Callia         1932 Mithras        1934 Weiss
1935 Windsor        1937 Overnale       1938 New Rome
1939 Craw           2035 Aki            2036 Glisten (subsector capital)
2038 Trane          2132 Centry         2134 Caledonia
2137 Sorel          2138 Horosho        2140 Romar
2231 Marastan       2232 Crout          2233 Tirem
2234 Inthe          2236 Tsarina        2237 Wurzburg
2331 Bicornn        2334 Ffudn          2336 Bendor

Trin\'s Veil subsector (were all Imperial worlds in post-5FW era)
2536 Squanine
2739 Dodds
2839 Farquahar
2940 Thornastor
3039 Tenelphi (Yikes!  `My\' homeworld!)

With these sorts of gains into the Spinward Marches you would expect the
the Aslan to have overrun Sindal, Pax Rulin, Tobia and Gazulin in the
Trojan Reach.

The Vargr made gains to coreward in Regina and Aramis as well:

Regina subsector (were all Imperial worlds in post-5FW era)
2201 Dentus
2202 Kinorb
2303 Yorbund
2402 Heya

Aramis subsector (were all Imperial worlds in post-5FW era)
2602 Corfu          2607 Focaline       2701 Lablon
2706 Heguz          2708 Violante       2905 Pavanne
2906 Carsten        3001 Jesedipere     3002 Yebab
3003 Nasemin        3004 Zykoca         3005 Aramanx
3008 Pysadi         3102 Rugbird        3103 Towers
3104 Feneteman      3202 Junidy

Again, one would expect similar sorts of Vargr inroads into Pretoria,
Lamas, Antra and Million in Deneb sector.

There are Imperium-wide maps in *IE* that show the progress of the Rebellion
during 1116-1120.  Again, these are difficult to read because of the scale
but the 1117 map show Aslan *ihatei* in Sindal, Tobia, Pax Rulin and
Gazulin and in Usher and Vestus in Reft sector.  The 1118 map shows Aslan
moving into District 268, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil.  By 1119 the Aslan have
been forced out of Vestus.  By 1120 they have been expelled from District
268, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil.  None of these Imperium-wide maps reflect any
Vargr gains into the Marches or Deneb.

The situation on the rimward front does coincide with Norris\'s plans for
dealing with the *ihatei*:
1. Contain their advance to within 5 pc of the border (not quite)
2. Negotiate a halt to the incursions (basically a delaying tactic)
3. Build up forces to counter the incursions
4. Expell the invaders
By 1120, the Domain seems to have seen some success here although one
might expect the *ihatei* settlers to have remained even if their
naval forces were expelled.  (That\'s the nature of *ihatei* invasions.)

Next, let\'s look at the later Rebellion era as depicted in *Travellers\'
Digest* and the *MegaTraveller Journals*.

I think we\'ve lost track of the original question. As I recall it (correct
me if I\'m wrong) you started out by asking how come Gram was the leader of
the Sword Worlds when Sacnoth was so much more powerful. I assumed that
you were talking about powerful in the naval sense (since a TL or two
dosen\'t mean nearly as much as the population size in the economic sense).
So I proposed two possible reasons why the Gram and Narsil fleets maybe
wasn\'t less powerful than the Sacnoth: One possibility was that Gram and
Narsil bought TL 12 ships. Another, postulating these economic cycles, was
that maybe they had been TL 12 themselves and still had a lot of TL 12
ships from back then. (Those two possibilities turned out to dovetail so
neatly that they subsequently got intermixed, but that\'s by the way). 
Since then I\'ve tried to defend the notion that the economic cycles are
_possible_. I don\'t say that they definitely must be, that there are no
other possibilities. Just that they are perfectly possible. I don\'t try
to prove that they exist, only that they could exist. OK? Nor did I use
them to explain the disparity of different TLs. My argument in that 
direction was:

        1) TL 15 _knowledge_ is readily available to anyone in contact
           with Imperial society.
        2) That many worlds have lower than TL 15 _industry_, cannot
           therefor be explained by a lack of knowledge, but must be
           due to other reasons.
        3) The most likely limiting factors are economic.
        4) Economic cycles are well-known on Earth today.
        5) Granted, economic cycles does not cause TL swings on Earth
           today (as far as I know).
        6) However _if_ technology is limited by economy (as it is in   
           the Traveller universe), sufficiently large booms and recessions 
           _ought_ to be able to affect the TL of a world.

It applies to the ability of Gram and Narsil to maintain a TL 12 fleet with
TL 11 and 10 economies.

But my whole point is that they _will_ have much more than a clue. The
knowledge is there even if the industry isn\'t.

That too.

No, it proves that the authors of a board game have different priorities
from the authors of a role-playing game.

Not in terms of the economy according to _Trillion Credit Squadron_. The
GPP (Gross Planetary Product) of Gram is close to that of Sacnoth and that
of Narsil is a lot bigger.

There are 7 SW squadrons that must be TL 12 (jump3 capable), 9 that could
be TL 12, but propably are TL 11 (jump2 capable), and none that can be TL
10 (no jump1 squadrons). The troops are marked with TL: One brigade from
Gram is TL 11 and one from Joyeuse is TL 10. The rest are anonymous and
consists of four TL 10 corps and 2.5 TL 11 corps. No TL 12 corps at all.
The whole force is much less than the total available Sword World forces;
the attack on the Imperium appears to be a secondary effort. Most of 
their prime units must have gone against the Darrians. Any Gram TL 12
units could be there.

I had always assumed that GDW just took all the Sword World names they could
find in "Space Viking" and used the Tolkien names and the Norse Mythology
names (not even swords!) to fill out the subsector. But a short while ago I
checked, and it turns out that there are a whole bunch of Piper SWs that
has no Traveller SW counterpart. Most of the duplications are with really
famous swords like Excalibur, Joyeuse, and Durendal  -  the kind of names
anyone would dig up once the idea of \'Sword Class\' names had ocurred to
them. So what the Traveller SWs owe to Piper is actually little more than
the concept of the sword names. The societies are different in a number of
ways too (Women accepted in \'male\' roles for instance).

You\'re right. I\'ve mixed my own idea up with the official info. \'Exiles\'
does imply some sort of pressure on them, though.

This was long after the Interstellar Wars. _Cats&Rats_ says that they left
Terra in -420. That they used 29 years to get to the Spinward Marches
implies a desire to get _really_ away from it all. My interpretation is
that they were losers in a civil war in the Old Earth Union. Not official.

That\'s just what I said. It\'s two different and independent bits of my
argument. The disparate TLs indicates a close tie to economy. Economy can
(and often does) fluctuate. Ergo TLs can fluctuate. If you postulate that 
Sword World economy dosen\'t fluctuate you get stable TLs. If you postulate 
that it does you get unstable TLs.

Certainly. The stable economy theory. But one set of UPPs isn\'t enough to
say anything one way or the other about this. Of course, we do have 
several sets of UPPs for the Sword Worlds, but since they have world
populations fluctuating by bilions within a decade I don\'t know that
we can really rely on them.

I think that is wrong. Whatever the age of an institution, the people who
run it usualy thinks in terms of their own generation.

The pacification campaigns took place before even the Ante-bellum period of
the Imperium. The 3rd frontier War took place after the Civil War and the
Psionic suppressions. I find no problem with accepting that Imperial
attitudes were different in those two periods.

I must have a different definition of \'intergration\' than you. I think these
worlds all produce whatever is most profitable at any given time and sell it
to anyone who will buy. That\'s not intergration in my book.

GDW failed to consider the ramifications of what they had already established
about Aslan ihatei and made a massive mistake in an effort create one more

And the Vargr (as originally described) are equally incapable of posing a
credible threat. 

I\'ve presented my arguments against the seriousness of Aslan ihatei threat 
before. I\'ll do it again if anyone wants to dispute the matter. But for
now I\'ll just post a letter that I worked out to explain away most of the
inconsistencies and what happened afterwards:

- ----
Message from High Commissioner the Lord Goolanzoon, Sector Admiral, Imperial
Navy  (ret.),  Minister without portfolio of the Archduchy of Deneb,  to His
Grace Archduke Norris of Deneb using the private cypher:


Mora, 345-1118

Dear Pruneface,

Well, the "Committee to Review the recent events in the Trojan Reaches with a
view to ascertaining etc. etc."  -  in short, what went wrong and what can we
do about it?   -   has finally completed it\'s investigation.  No doubt you\'ll
eventually get a predigested resume of our findings through your tame bureau-
crats, but I thought you\'d appreciate a informal overview. (And to be totally
honest, I\'m too damn exited to wait for an official reaction).
    First of all,  there\'s  no doubt that the whole thing was shockingly mis-
managed by the Duke of Tobia and Admiral Torgeson. They seem to\'ve lost their
so-called heads completely.  True, most of the regular units were up coreward
watching the zhos, but the astrographics of the Reach is such that any first-
year  cadet  could\'ve  stopped  the aslan by garrisoning a few key worlds and
forming  a few  fire-fighter squadrons.  These are ihatei,  after all,  using
obsolescent  clan hand-me-downs   -   not much superior to our Reserve forces
(rather the reverse,  if anything).  Hell,  give me a half-decent spy network
and  a  good  courier system and I\'d\'ve undertaken to stop them with half the
forces the two fatheads had.
    Instead  Tobia  and  Torgeson  concentrated their forces to guard the few
worlds that were already so well protected  that no sane aslan would dream of
trying  to  muscle  in on them and sat around with their thumbs up their bums
while  our bewhiskered land-grabbing friends grabbed left,  right and center.
And  none  of  the other nobles had the gumption to do anything more than try
and protect their own little patch  (mostly with pitiful results). Personally
I think that the proper cure for what ails the local nobility is a collective
brain-transplant.  If  you  can\'t  find  enough donors,  a set of cheap paper
substitutes will still be an improvement!
    I know, I know.  We can\'t really do anything about the nobles   -   but I
can  dream,  can\'t I?   -   but you ought to sack the top three levels of the
Fleet,  at  least.  There\'s a few you\'d have to kick upstairs and a couple of
exceptions, but most of the idiots deserve to be cashiered. That\'s the result
of the Reach being too far from any real fighting for centuries,  I guess   -
all the fools wind up down here, where they,  quote "can\'t do any harm",  end
quote. Ha, bloody ha! I\'ve said it myself, may the Guiding Spirit forgive me.
    I  spoke  of  fools,  but  I\'m pretty sure that there\'s also a few knaves
around. That shocking business with Aki - ihatei that far inside the frontier
and 30 parsec from their base, for the luffa Mike!   -   couldn\'t\'ve happened
without  the conniving of somebody pretty high up.  I have a few of my bright
young  men  looking into it   -   hopefully giving the lardbutts of the local
Naval Intelligence  (hmpf!)  a few well-deserved heart attacks in the process
- -  and when we find the culprits, the bastards are going to breathe vacuum!
    Mind you, I\'ve often wondered what made the aslans commit that particular
bit of lunacy. Imagine trying to control 10 billion locals with a few hundred
thousands.  They  had a couple of tech levels on the locals,  true,  but as I
always say,  once you can make explosives the rest is just dressing.  Anyway,
young Blackstone-Hawke - remember him?  He was one of Santanocheev\'s hangers-
on  and wound up in charge of the Gazulin Reserve Fleet after the shake-up  -
Well, he seems to have had a few more brain cells than we gave him credit for
(or  perhaps  being stuck in the boonies for half a decade has wised him up).
The  moment he heard about Aki he put a fleet across the aslani supply lines,
and  the  last  I  heard about it the survivors were at the peace tables with
their tail between their legs.  (Not that far between their legs though. They
have  been  raiding Glisten and a lot of other places for supplies,  and they
still control the Aki system. But I guess you know all this already).
    Anyway, there\'s no getting around the fact that the dam is well and truly
broken.  Apointing blame is all very well   -   it\'s rapidly becoming the fa-
vourite  sport  of the local nitwits   -   but the real problem is what to do
about  it.  Curiously enough according to my tame sociologists the problem is
more the locals than the aslans.  You remember the old diplomatic joke?  "You
give  us  what  we  want  or we beat the hell out of you and take it anyway"?
Well, apart from at Aki and a few other places, the aslans seems to have come
up  with a variant:  "You sell us what we want or we beat the hell out of you
and buy it anyway"! Most of them prefer to buy rather than take  -  they just
don\'t  take  no for an answer!  Nor would there normally be any problems with
getting  them to swear fealthy to the Imperium.  Well,  that\'s not altogether
true;  some of the clans are quite anti-Imperium.  But we\'d have the strength
to deal with them if we could get along with the rest.
    That  would  seem to solve most of the problem,  wouldn\'t it?  If they\'re
willing to pay for what they take and to become loyal citizens, then we real-
ly should be able to work out something, right?  Alas, the locals have become
thoroughly paranoid about them and in many cases refuse to share their worlds
with  them.  They  organize their own militias and try to push the aslans off
their planets. And you know what happens when you push an aslan  -  he pushes
right back!  If something isn\'t done, the descendents of both sides are going
to be sniping at each others 200 years from now.
    Fortunately  we have been able to come up with a solution!  That\'s right,
we have an answer,  and it\'s so simple that you\'re going to kick yourself for
not thinking of it yourself.  I did when my aide earned the fastest promotion
in history with just one sentence.  Think about it. What are our two greatest
problems  today?  One is that we have all these young aslans swarming up from
rimwards, eager for land and willing to fight for it, and we can\'t stop them,
because most of our ships are up corewards trying to keep the damn Vargr from
devastating more planets than they already have.
    I really wish I could see your face now,  Pruney.  As my aide said:  "Why
don\'t we get our two problems to fight each other?" Corewards and in Corridor
there  are  scores  of planets whose populations have been decimated;  untold
acres of prime land whose legitimate owners and their heirs are dead and gone.
We  can  hire all the ihatei we can get and pay them off with that land!  And
you can bet your bottom credit that the survivors are not going to regard the
aslans as interlopers. They\'ll be saviours!
    Furthermore, once we have a credible offer to make, we\'ll be able to play
the aslan clans off against each others. You know how fragile aslan alliances
are,  Frankly I\'m amazed that the present one has held so long as it has, and
it  has only done so because they could get more out of cooperating with each
other than with us.  The land the aslans can get down here rimwards is mostly
second choice.  Give them an offer of prime land and they\'re not going to let
the  Vargr  stand  in  the  way.  And we\'ll be able to favour the friendliest
clans, leaving us in a position to make the unfriendly ones toe the line.
    With the extra strength the aslan can supply  (not to metion the ships we
will be able to spare from the rim)  we should be able to clear the Domain of
Vargr.  Hell,  we  may  even be in a position to clear Corridor,  although my
aslan  experts  doubt  it.  They say that the present massive burst of ihatei
will  taper  off in a year or so,  and that it will be a long time before the
pressure builds up to the pre-Revolution level. For one thing, the ihatei has
mostly  leap-frogged over all the neutral worlds we kept between them and us,
and  it will be some time before they\'ve "filled in the cracks".  Still,  who
knows? Perhaps enough of them will prefer Corridor to filling in cracks.
    What  I  suggest is that we keep this plan secret and try to surprise the
Vargr.  The most pressing problem is Aki and the rest of Glisten. If you will
send me a warrant,  I\'ll take over the negotiations and get the ball rolling.
I\'ve  already put my staff on to planning the logistics which,  I admit,  are
going to be a headache. But worth it, I\'d say!

Cheerio,
Goggles.

Your idea of article subject lines seems most excellent and you list
topics seem fairly well broken down.  While I initially favored not
splitting the list in all fairness to those who have yet to embrace TNE
(or know something that infidels like myself are ignorant of) a split
seems to be in order.

Why should they suffer and in some cases pay for data that is worthless
to them.  I shall miss them but hopefully the filters will be feasable
and soon allow us to reap the benefits of technology> TML - mail listing

As a Latter Day Traveller with access to *PoT* info detailing the
military assets of a world can be found on pages 95-97 of that book of
ineffable damnation (TM the other company (lest mention of their same
summon them like demon-spawn)).

From that book: "The greater the perceived threat or need for security
forces, the more resources will be devoted to defense.  This system uses
total personnel as  auseful guage of the resources devoted to the
military."

balkanized worlds - ea. nation averages 1% of its pop in armed forces
(this can vary by 50%+ in either direction.)

non-balk worlds - only about 0.25% pop in armed forces

hi-pop worlds or countries - multiply total number of personnel by 0.5.
Note not all nations on balk worlds are subject, only those with pops of
1 billion+

These forces are broken into four branches: wet navy, air force (inc.
orbital & sub-orbit craft), space force, and ground forces.  The
calculation of the percentage of the total each force is comprised of is
fairly complex.  The space force for example:

Base percentage determined by starport: A = 10%, B= 8, C = 6, D = 4, E =
2, X = 0 which is modified as follows:

(ignoring TL 8-)
        Factor  Modification
        TL 9 or 10      x 0.5
        pop = 8 x 0.2
        pop = 9 x 0.03
        pop = 10+       x 0.004

Once the number of personnel in each force is established the equipment
is determined bearing in mind only a small percentage comprise the
actual crew with the remainder support & logistics.

Ex - Space Force: One combatant for every 500 personnel.  In large
services (30000+) half of the personnel will serve with major combatants
(1000+ tons) with one in service for every 1500 personnel.  The balance
will be regular combatants.  Small services (<5000) will partially or
fully man armed merchant craft with one in service for every 250
personnel.

These numbers seem skewed when put into use, for example:
Tizon (pop 300,000,000; TL 10)
600,000 personnel, 200 major ships,  600 regular ships

Narsil (pop 20,000,000,000; TL 10)
400,000 personnel, 133 major ships, 400 regular ships

Gram (pop 6,000,000,000; TL 11)
2,250,000 personnel, 750 major ships, 2250 regular ships

Someone tell me my calculations are off!! It is midnight. Or as

Any suggestions for a name for this gun?  The purpose of the gun is to
provide Coalition forces with a one-man weapon that can overcome battle
dress equiped forces of TEDs.

    'body' => 'Since people originally asked about the composition of the Sword
Worlds military, here\'s the lowdown from 5FW:

Since the game is focused on the primary theater of operations, 
we only see the Joyeuse and Gram fleets.  The Darrian theater
is off the game board, as is the rimward theater and most of
the Sword Worlds Confederation, so the Sacnoth and Narsil fleets
are not represented.

Planetary forces are estimates converted from the wargaming
notation to something a little more clear to the general reader.

ARMY: 
       Mjolnir has no defenses, tech-10.
       Gungnir has one division, tech-8.  Balkanized world.
       Joyeuse has an SDB, one corps, two divisions, and one brigade, 
         tech-10.  Balkanized world.
       Gram has 120 SDBs and twelve corps, tech-10.
       
   Mobile forces available are:
    
       Six corps (one elite), two brigades, TL 10 to 11, mostly 
         tech-10.

NAVY:  Under the Gram and Joyeuse Fleets:
       Six BatRons, seven CruRons, two AssaultRons, one TankRon.
       Fleet is roughly 60% jump-2, 40% jump-3, suggesting roughly
       60% tech-11, 40% tech-12, minimum.
       
Three admirals are available.  One must be a Zhodani liaison.  
  Unfortunately for the Sword Worlds, their skill is inversely
  proportional to their rank.  The ranking flag, Riksdattar, is
  much like Santanocheev.  [Incidentally, if her name is formed
  in the Icelandic manner, Riksdattar is a woman.  Just an
  observation for the SW culture watchers.]
  
*ANALYSIS*

Hm.  I guess the SDB figures are for craft or are more abstract...
Terra only had 34 wings in 1001, after all.

Note that Gram is stated to be TL 10!  However, _Spinward Marches 
Campaign_ confirms the tech-11...but it also says Regina is tech-12,
which is an increase of two tech levels from previous supplements.  
Would someone kindly check the CT book _Supplement 3: The Spinward 
Marches_ to see if this is the case?  It might answer some questions.

Since the SW were not colonized until -399 imperial, and they have 
had no patron like the Imperial colonies, is it possible that they
are just entering a period of technological growth?

Note the paucity of forces available to the SW government.  It
would seem that they aren\'t really prepared for much of an
offensive campaign. 

Side notes:

The leadership in 5FW is interesting.  Generally speaking, the 
Zhodani have better leadership than the Imperials.  Santanocheev
isn\'t a complete disaster as an admiral -- he\'s a bit like General
McClellan from the US Civil War; he reacts and plans very slowly,
but in battle he\'s a decent tactician.  Norris isn\'t a tactician,
but he has a grasp of strategic planning and a reaction time that\'s 
pretty phenomenal. The IN actually has a couple of junior admirals
that tactically *impede* the performance of their fleets!

Seditious TNE influence:  by using _PoT_ rules in a wildly 
inappropriate way, estimated armed forces from UWP.  Ground force
seems a bit low, but probably explainable by needing more hands 
in space in a pre-Collapse professional military.  The SW seem to be
a naval power, anyway.

  I looked over Graham Spearing\'s TL 11 10mm ETC pistol.  The numbers
all check out except for the bulk listing.  With a length of 28cm, the
bulk is only 1, not 2.
  If the bulk listing is ok for the player, but the 3 recoil is a bit
hefty, try adding a 4 cm muzzle brake.  It will make it bulk 2 (32 cm
length), but drop the recoil to 2.  It will only make it slightly
heavier (2.0071 Kg unloaded vs 1.8071 Kg unloaded) and only raise the
bottom line price by Cr50.

    Many blights and wilts are multi-species.  Fungi and viroids seem 
    to be non-discriminating...

    A number of virii are multi-species; influenza is perhaps the best
    known example.  Several truly unpleasant tropical nasties jump 
    from monkeys to humans (HIV, for one).

    Many epidemic diseases have vectors other than humans (Bubonic 
    Plague in rats & fleas, for example).

    For a truly evil virus, read the posts I made about a time-delayed
    nanotech "virus" back in the late Hard Times/Survival Margin days,
    when the Virus was a rumor being condemned on the TML.

    As a matter of record, according to the Julian Protectorate 
    article some years back in Challenge, the Gashikaan Empire once 
    tried to wipe out the Vargr species using a tailored virus.  They 
    killed a lot of Vargr, the disease was brought under control, and 
    the Vargr nations nearby were really pissed off and trashed the 
    Gashikaan Empire because of it.  I don\'t remember whether this was
    the "Sack of Gashikaan" or if the bitterness fostered by the "Sack
    of Gashikaan" was what led to the attempted genocide.  In any 
    case, the modern Second Gashikaan Empire is still a bunch of 
    Vargrphobes.

>Does Sacnoth have a chance?  :-)

(1) No. My groups are still post-5FW, and I doubt I will ever use the TNE
universe.  (However, we have the Imperial Occupation of the Islands Cluster
and the Sixth Frontier War coming up instead... and possibly the 2nd Solomani
Rim War.)

(2 & 3) Sacnoth will take Capital of the Border Worlds Confederation away
from Beater as the popular backlash against "knuckling under to Impy puppets"
crests; the Border Worlds will cease to be a tame puppet...er client state of
the Imperium.  However, true to traditional Sword Worlds fractiousness, the
Border Worlds/Sword Worlds split will stand, as  Gram and Sacnoth will be
unable to agree on proper usage of the Metal Worlds.  (The Border Worlds has
opened them to colonization, particularly from overcrowded Sacnoth -- the
Sword Worlds, still having many underpopulated, relatively pleasant worlds
open for further colonization, demands that they be closed to further
colonization and retained as "resource worlds"...i.e., they don\'t want
Sacnoth having more political allies and votes in a reunited Confederation
government).  The Joyeuse civil war will finally grind to a close, as those
who have been fostering instability there change policies, and Joyeuse will
become an significant part of Sword World politics once it rebuilds.

>Is this *TCS* information?  Didn\'t you say somewhere else (maybe you didn\'t,
>I can\'t find it now) that Sacnoth\'s shipyard could only build 5000-ton
ships?
>If so, where do the larger ships mentioned above get built?

Some were built on Gram, and some in Sacnoth\'s yards *before* the war, before
the Impy Navy raid that trashed Sacnoth\'s A yards... (yes, I am playing fast
& loose with old history -- i.e., the CT Spinward Marches Supplement;
remember that UPPs are based on IISS surveys and can be out of date...
especially if they update them by hiring a detached duty scout to spend 20
years per sector updating them... remember Adventure #0, that came with some
versions of the CT boxed set?)

>22 more worlds to go.

Sorry, Sacnoth is the only world I have quite that much detail on (one of my
PBSEM players has a character that lives and works there), but I have some
information on Big Game Hunting on Hrunting,...

    'body' => 'Navigation

         Normal space navigation is carried out with the aid of System
    Navigation Beacons, which provide precise 4-D position fixes to
    users.  Most System Navigation Beacons use some form of
    spread-spectrum technology to reduce the power required to make a
    broadcast signal heard across an entire solar system, and to avoid
    drowning out nearby radio traffic from the power of the signal.
    Since a spread-spectrum signal is weaker than background noise at
    the receiver, the receiver has to "know" the Pseudo-Random Noise
    (PRN) code imposed on the carrier signal to identify signal amid
    background noise.  The Imperium has a set of standard PRNs used
    Imperium-wide for normal use.  Military navigation systems have
    their own secret PRNs with encrypted Nav signals.

        In a war zone, the Imperial Navy (or local authority, if
    non-Imperial) will shut down the civilian system to impair enemy
    navigation insystem.  This is one reason, in addition to hazards
    from combatants, that War Zone systems are made Amber zones or
    occasionally Red Zones.  [BTW, this is based on our (1992 Real
    World) GPS and Russia\'s GLONASS systems].

         Grade of starport usually implies comparable grade of
    navigation systems.  A class E starport may have one beacon at the
    starport (which is useful for finding the starport, and not much
    else), whereas a class A starport mainworld has a full
    constellation of navigation beacons around every major body in the
    system (which makes deep space navigation a trivial exercise).

         Interstellar jumps make use of a published ephemeris for a
    system, listing all the celestial bodies and major installations,
    and their orbital statistics such that their positions can be
    calculated at any given time.  With an accurate ephemeris and
    competent navigation, a merchant ship or battleship can jump
    precisely to the 100-diameter limit of their destination world.
    Without an accurate ephemeris, it is usually necessary to jump
    into the outer system, above the plane of the ecliptic (to avoid
    debris and traffic), and calculate one\'s own ephemeris from
    collected sensor data.

         Many worlds with less-than-trusting rulers issue falsified
    ephemerii.  The fixes provided by their System Navigation Beacons
    compensate for this falsification, so it has no effect in ordinary
    use.  During Emergencies (war, raids, etc.), the Beacons can be
    shut down, and the falsified ephemeris makes it harder (tho far
    from impossible) to get an accurate jump fix, and, more important,
    makes it nearly impossible to launch a ballistic strike from an
    extreme distance (i.e., throw asteroids at the planet from beyond
    detection range.)  The ephemerii used by the Imperial Navy are
    either *UNCONFIRMED* (the public, possibly falsified ephemerii
    issued to civilians) or *CONFIRMED* (true, usually classified,
    ephemerii that have been verified true by Scout Service
    surveying.)

        This is pretty accurate, but quite misleading.  Based on what you

        _You_ misunderstood the significance of these numbers, at least.
The budget is an annual budget, and the capacity is shipyard capacity.
        Since TCS requires 10% of ship cost as annual maintenance, to all
intents, the _value_ of the SW Navy is 10 times the annual budget, or
TCr142.4.
        The shipyard capacity has some bearing on Navy size, but, in my
experience, not much.  The only world in any of my TCS games that _ever_
operated its shipyard at capacity was one doing a lot of contract work
for other players (due to its higher TL).  Most of the worlds seldom
operated at more than 20% capacity.

        However, a good guideline for Fleet size is 1 ton of ship for
KCr750. This results in a Sword Worlds\' Fleet of about 190,000,000 tons,
or 3800 ships in the 50,000T range.
        Note that this thumbrule can vary quite a lot, depending on TL, but
it works reasonably well from TL11-15.

        The two sets of rules are completely incompatible.  I have, however,
always assumed that the FFW fleets are a simplification of the reality
it pretends to model for ease of play.  Who wants to play a game with
10,000 pieces, after all?

Subject: Weapon Designs in Traveller

Much as I dispise the authors of TNE for throwing away the
whole potential of CT/MT and restricting the game to a
not-very-interesting universe there is one bit they managed
to get just right. From the back of FF&S:
        "Other games give you lists of weapons, we give you
the factory".
        This is *exactly* what Traveller used to be about, but
not just for weapons, but the universe too. Now that the TNE
bitch is out of the way this opens up some interesting ideas
I have had...

        I think the FF&S weapons & ammo design is a pretty cool
idea. It would be cute and easy enought to do to have the 
simple ammo/pistol/rifle rules in a small application for
design. The problem is that as they exist they are useless
to me since I spit upon TNE combat.
        However, the only really TNE specific bit is where they
translate the physical stats of the gun (muzzle velocity,
etc) into those stange numbers. If you just replaced this table
with one showing good old penetration, attenuation and damage
you would have nifty firearm design rules for MT. By a similar
mechanism you would have the same for CT.
        Taking this idea to the logical extreme I thought that once
I had an application I could just get an expert at any particular
system to translate the physical outputs into the game mechanics
of *whatever* particular system. GURPS, Paranoia, etc, etc.
        We don\'t need the application to start with. Just the tables.
Whose first? I\'ll happily coordinate the results.

Recently there was some discussion re. the composition of ground forces.
According to the Book of Moron (thats Path of Tears for those who have
embraced TNE which includes me) forces are comprised of the following:

one battalion equivalent per 2000 personnel (includes one maneuver      
        battalion (of about 500) and its support personnel (about 500)  
        plus up to 1000 others in the supporting military infrastructure

types of maneuver bttns: infantry, cavalry, armor, airborne, commando,  
        etc.
support bttns:
        combat support: combat eng, field art, air defense, antitank art,
                coastal defense, fortress art, etc.
        non-cmbt support: signal, forward supply, transport, maintenance,
                MPs, etc.
infrastructure: medical, veterinary, admin, training, theater and rear  
        area supply, judge advocate general, and general staff personnel


one division equivalent per 20000 personnel typically of 10 maneuver and
10 support battalions and 10000 infrastructure personnel

Fron TL5+ the typical battalion consists of five 100 man comnpanies: 3
line, 1 support, 1 HQ

Hope this may be of some use to someone.  As to my intended discussion
of the RQS in the new era it will need to simmer for now . . . the old
computer needs to go into the shop and based on the last time I\'ll be
without for 4-6 weeks :(   At least that should give me time to come up
with something really creative.

Old style rebreathers used CaCO3 to absorb CO2.  Modern rebreathers
crack the CO2 electrically and recycle the O2.  This is the same
method used aboard nuclear subs.

Not quite accurate.  O2 toxicity begins at 2 ATMs of 100% O2.
Anything less is not normally dangerous.  This is the reason
that std. compressed air diving is physiologically limited to
a max. depth of 289 FSW (ft. of Sea Water).  That equals 9
ATMs (atmospheres) of sea water, plus 1 for the surface, for
a total of 10 ATMs.  The rounded value of O2 as comprising 20%
of normal air, gives it a partial pressure of 2 ATMs at 288
FSW.  Any deeper diving requires custom mixed gases.

Ok, I take back what I said about proofreading, here\'s a *real*
doozy....

Recently, for whatever reason, I looked into designing a ship 
capable of interstellar flight with a payload of five billion
tons, using FF&S.  (A *huge* payload.  Some of the CT referees
out there who liked FASA may know where my number is coming
from.)  So I checked out drive systems.

FTL travel works great...a ship with jump-1, and able to jump
three times without refueling, uses 32% of its internal volume
for drive systems, including fuel, as would any other large 
jump-1 ship.

STL travel stinks.  And it revealed a *major* bug in the FF&S
rules.  At tech-9 and above, the best options are the fusion
rocket and the Daedalus drive.  Supposedly, the Daedalus drive
is a better choice; "the engines [have] a lower thrust-to-mass
ratio than a conventional fusion rocket, but provide fuel 
efficiency about one order of magnitude higher." (p. 74)

#$**$%^@!  <This is a family mailing-list.>  :)

Per cubic meter of maneuver drive: (in metric tons)
 
                  THRUST       FUEL USE  ...fuel per ton of thrust
 Daedalus drive: 1.5 ton   0.00050 ton/hr.     0.000334 ton/hr
 Fusion rocket   9.0 ton   0.00035 ton/hr.     0.000039 ton/hr
 HEPlaR drive:  33.4 ton   0.02917 ton/hr.     0.000873 ton/hr
 
Figures are rounded.  HEPlaR figures include the required fusion
power plant in the drive\'s cubic meter, here assumed to be at
tech-10, are included for comparison with the tech-9 drive systems.
The advantage of a higher thrust-to-mass ratio is that your engine
is smaller.  HEPlaR fuel use doesn\'t improve...but the engines
get smaller.

The Daedalus drive is an order of magnitude *worse* in fuel 
efficiency than the conventional fusion rocket!!!  Combined
with its\' worse thrust-to-mass ratio, the engine is fairly
worthless.

Of course, maybe fuel efficiency isn\'t the issue...a big fusion
rocket isn\'t exactly a healthy thing to be around.  But that
wasn\'t the selling point in FF&S!  At tech-10, the smaller motor
of the HEPlaR probably outweighs the fuel efficiency advantage
of the Daedalus drive.  (It might be worthwhile at late tech-8.
The Daedalus design was originally supposed to be staged, and
that may also help its\' prospects as an interstellar drive, but
not as a competitor with the fusion rocket.)  The fuel 
efficiency of all of these seems to be a bit short of the kind
of performance I was looking for.  (It *is*, however, quite
realistic.)

This also brings up another interesting point.  It seems to me 
that even accounting for the extra mass needed in the motor of
a fusion rocket, it is more efficient than a HEPlaR drive.  This
suggests that there may be an advantage to using fusion rocket
designs in some cases on a military vessel, perhaps as a second
drive system.  

Any comments?  Am I reading this wrong?

me to offer my own examples and illustratons to the argument.

Many would agree that the knowledge on how to build an atomic bomb is
readily available in books stashed in libraries the world over. Thus,
anyone can get the knowledge to build a bomb.

I want one, so I go to the library and check out "How to win friends &
influence people the Oppenheimer way". I read carefully, and build a case
and timer, etc. Then I hit a stumbling block: Plutonium. Where do I get it?

Regulations aside, I can\'t afford it. Looks like if I want my own nuke, I
will need to invest some money or play the lottery frequently until I get
enough cash to buy or manufacture Plutonium.

Similarly, even if a TL10 world had access to TL12 technology, they
wouldn\'t be able to put that knowledge to much use until they had invested
time & money into developing the appropriate infrastructure.

I agree that most world have access to the knowledge. However, I would bet
that some wouldn\'t, and even those that did still would\'nt be able to put
it to much use.

Take the example of the TL6 mechanic trying to fix a TL8 car. Sure, he\'s
read the manual, and maybe seen a videotape or two, but he hasn\'t actually
*done* it. Mechanically, I would rule that he still has a skill penalty.
Knowledge must be confirmed.

I imagine that what would happen would be that a number of specialists who
were familiar with higher TL equipment would make a living fixing it,
though the market would be smaller since all that hi-TL equipment is going
to be imported.

Hi All,

I really like Ken Hagler\'s High Guard ship designs. I\'m a big fan of
those simple but useful design and combat rules. Also, I like to 
collect designs so please keep them coming. I\'ll try to post some 
of my old favorites soon.

I recently found a 400k floppy with my circa 1985-86 traveller
campaign on it.  I\'ve been able to recover most of the information
from some corrupted MacWrite files. What is this? Has the Virus
destroyed my Third Imperium as well as GDW\'s?  ;-) Anyway, the 
files require some cleaning up and format changes. I\'ll try to post
them in the next few weeks provided that my wife doesn\'t go into 
labor first. It\'s mostly amber zones and background. 

I\'d like to see a CT/MT list because I\'ve been overwhelmed by the
volume lately. I hesitate to bring up CT issues because it\'s hard
enough to follow everything that\'s going on now. 

But, here it goes....

I remember in the early TML a lot of bandwidth was spent on how High
Guard was flawed concerning Agility. The argument was that the same
energy was being used twice. I\'ve looked through my archives and I
can\'t find if this was resolved. Could someone please fill me in?

First of all point blank range is the principal factor in determining

this .The next important factor is the frontal area of the round and 
finally the actual muzzle velocity itself.  These are reducing factors.  
After some playing aronund with the equation of motion i came up with the 
following equation for determining a reasonable short range for MD.  Try 
it and see if you like it.  If you want Ill formalize the method and post 
it or send it to who wants it.  
***Note only works for Mass Drivers***

Short Range= 8(MV)/(MV * r )^1/3 
Where MV is muzzle velocity
r is round radius in cm
This reads as 8 times MV divided by (the cube root of (MV times r))

Hey, I was only using the best rationale I could come up with.  Once y\'all
get the *TCS* data maybe you can then address what appears to be a 
discrepancy between that and the *RS* `1000 ships per sector\'.

This is a good point but it really boils down to whether the Sword
Worlds are more like the independent worlds of *TCS* or like the
Imperium doesn\'t it?

I guess what I\'d rather have seen than just comments that this doesn\'t
make sense to you was some suggested alternative.  I\'m not very `attached\'
to what I\'ve developed for the Sword Worlds naval forces but a response
that basically just says "Un uh" isn\'t very interesting *or* useful.

The *RS* says that Imperial naval fleets, which are responsible for a
single subsector, consist of "50-200 ships".  It goes on to explain that
these are battles, cruisers, carriers and some escorts.  Given this I
don\'t see it as completely unreasonable that the Sword Worlds, drawing
from fewer than a complete subsector\'s worth of worlds, are only able to
raise 42 ships.  Yes, they may be more militarized (due to their culture
and their Imperial experience) but they are also a frontier that is
more thinly populated than the `average\' Imperial subsector.  Sure,
they might have twice or three times that many ships so rather than just
saying the answer *isn\'t* 42  :-)  please suggest some alternative and
provide a rationale.

It may be hard to imagine but it\'s consist with canonical material.  I
believe there was some stuff in *JTAS* that referred specifically to the
Regina SDBs as being the 400-ton variety (something in TNS about them
"vectoring toward Assiniboia"?).  It\'s clear from *5FW* that SDBs depend
upon world population (although I couldn\'t find a clear pattern and I
played with the values from *5FW* and *S3:SM* for quite a while).  I feel
Imperial military doctrine doesn\'t call for SDBs to be a significant
factor in a major war - that\'s the role of the Navy.  SDBs are more for
dealing with raiders and pirates.

Please, give us a sample.

I\'d like to point out though that there are two levels of Regency military
development needed here.  One is at the level of the battlefield, which
concerns unit organization, equipment, and the like - tactical issues;
and the other is at the subsector or sector level - resources to support
forces, deployment, command structures - strategic issues.  It seems there
ought to be a great deal of variety at the tactical level (forces to assault
a TL 15 military facility from orbit vs. `peacekeeping\' forces on a TL 8
balkanized world) but that there ought to be some coherent structure at
the strategic level (subsector HQs, troop levels, logistical structures, etc.)

Peace,

Yes, this is true, but I\'m not sure how this would affect redeployment of
these forces in the face of incursions.  I doubt the Regency admiralty
would permit these forces to be destroyed needlessly trying to defend
their home ports.  Faced with defeat at the hands of the *ihatei* (or 
other foes) I believe they would withdraw and regroup.  Keep in mind
that by TNE many of the `overrun\' regions have been recovered and these
fleet units could be redeployed to protect these `gains\' once again.

Well, maybe, except that an Aslan-crewed force would need ships and equipment
designed for Aslan.  Furthermore, it appears by TNE that the Patrol no
longer exists - it has been `absorbed\' by the Quarantine Service.

This misses Pysadi 3008 which I cited from the *IE* UWP data.  Clearly the

This is a great idea, Jeff.  (Although are you sure `rice papers\' isn\'t

What with the uncertain timelines and all maybe it would be a good idea
to include a `date\' for when the RICE paper was written that ties it to
the source for the basic UWP data?

    'body' => 'Thanks to Steve Bonnev, Peter Brenton and David Johnson for the
 responses.  Just to clarify; I have assumed that "Army" (Imperial or
planetary) is a sort of generic term that includes aerospace and wet
naval forces.  However, in situations where Imperial military might
is called for, I think that both of these elements would become
non-issues.

Don\'t panic yet!  Let me explain my heresy first.  In the case of aerospace
forces, an Imperial task group of whatever size would have some form
of orbital support fire, and perhaps even cover from carrier-based
space fighters.  In addition, high-tech AFVs can be classed as aerospace
fighters in many respects, maybe slower but with far more firepower.

In the case of wet navy forces, surface vessels could be directly engaged 
by orbital support fire, fighters or even grav vehicles.  A PT Boat might
be fast and agile, but would be a slug compared to a TL13+ AFV.  The
submersible threat would be more problematic, but I do remember that
the old "Fighting Ships" booklet and some of the GDW material
relating to the defense of Terra in the Solomani Rim War mentioned
that SDBs and fighters were often based in the oceans.  I would suspect
that such vessels would have some limited combat ability in the sea.  I
think lasers might be a bad idea under water, but penetrating x-ray or
maser weapons would work, as would meson weapons.  Even missiles
(direct impact) would work, with some modifications.   Of course, I was
not a physics major, so you may all stop laughing if I am wrong!  :-(

This does not mean that such vehicles would be the best solution, but
it would certainly be more cost effective to use mission-capable existing
designs than it would be to spend funds on whole new classes of vehicles.
An Imperium-wide military machine does get a tad expensive, so these
concerns are very valid.  Besides, we know the 3rd Imperium must be
cheap or broke, or else they could have afforded a less sequel-like name.

As regards Peter Brenton\'s ideas on a Marine Expeditionary Division,
I have used a similar concept.  The Imperial marines would certainly
need to field big units (divisions and corps), but a lot of the dirty work
could be done with the clever employment of smaller mobile units.  This
is where the distinction of Fleet Marines vs Line Marines came in.  The
ship-borne Fleet Marines might just be the ship\'s troops of an Imperial
"ship of the line", or they might be purpose-carried for rapid operations.
I had three classes of such units; Marine Combined Arms Teams (MCATs),
Marine Assault Forces (MAFs) and Marine Assault Brigades (MABs).  

A MCAT would consist of a combined arms company of two rifle platoons
and one armor or mechanized platoon, with a support platoon for
command and heavy weapons.  These would be ad hoc units, formed
from a MAF designated to be broken up into smaller units.   The MAF
could be divided into three MCATs.  The MCAT would be carried on a
5,000 ton starship, which would also have a pair of fighters for aerospace
support.

The MAF would be designed for longer-term field deployments, with
the intention of being at least semi-independent.  The MAF would be made
up of two rifle companies and one armored or mechanized company, with
a weapons company (MRLs) and an artillery battery (2 Meson guns) for 
fire support, an engineer platoon, a medical platoon, a port service platoon
(to handle starport operations at the local captured starport, or at
whatever landing field the engineers built) and a command and general
support company.  The MAF would be carried on a 10,000 ton starship,
which would also carry a squadron of fighters for aerospace support, and
would have orbital support weapons.

The MAB would be especially popular for extended independent
operations.  It would have one armored or mechanized battalion, two
rifle battalions, an artillery company (3 batteries), a drop
infantry/commando company, a cavalry troop (grav bikes & speeders)
an engineer company, a medical company, a port service company and
a reinforced command and general support company.  The MAB would
be carried on a 50,000 tons starship, which would carry a wing (3 
squadrons) of fighters for aerospace support, and would be well
armored and equipped with orbital fire capable weapons.

Of course, the above was using the old High Guard rules, which were
fairly lenient for space requirements.  I would suspect the tonnage of
the ships would be increased by 50% to 100% in MT or FF&S.

This does not reflect the views of my employers.  Neither does the
continuation of this in my next message.  Nuff said.

Notes: This is a fleet battle tender. It can carry up to 40,000 tons 
worth of riders--normally four _Berlins_ or two _Provences_. Has a frozen 
watch, and fuel purification plant.

This is the original, and only known, version of the _Rhine_ class. 70 
were built for the NFN, named for rivers on Earth. This class saw action 
in the Old Islands War and the Topas War. Following the Topas War, FAdm 
Connor commented that the ships\' substantial missile armament made them 
useful as \'auxiliary battleship\' in some situations. In 5629, five of 
these ships were handed over to the Alliance Navy.

Many _Rhines_ were present in the Neubayern system at the beginning of 
the Second Battle of Neubayern, but they successfully escaped to St. 
Genevieve where they joined the Alliance Fleet. Many of these ships no 
longer had riders to carry, as these had been destroyed at Neubayern, and 
were handed over to the Alliance or mothballed.

The fate of the _Rhine_ was unclear since the riders were being phased 
out. The NFN had begun experiments with a class of 1000-ton laser-armed 
gunboats, but the experiment had not yet yielded any concrete results 
when the Imperials arrived. Many _Rhines_ were scrapped or hidden, but 
five were hidden on Sansterre.

When the Cluster Liberation War came, one of the _Rhines_ carried forty 
of the experimental _Thunderbolt_ class PFs, while the others carried 
various riders. Following the War, some of the _Rhines_ were reactivated 
to carry PFs, while others were used to carry disabled ships to shipyards.

Since the Alliance Navy uses _Rhines_ primarily as support ships in 
peaceful areas, those that remain in service are a very low priority for 
upgrades. As of 5650, there are no known refits of the class, although it 
has been rumoured that one ship has been modified for use as a technology 
demonstrator.

Those bored with me, or revolted by all this militaristic talk can
skip to the next item.  The rest of us can then make fun of you at our
leisure  (just kidding)  :-).

To continue:  What good are MCATs, MAFs and MABs?  Remember
that this was all designed for a pre-rebellion campaign.  The Imperium
had its share of enemies, but much of the IN and IMC\'s job was
internal peacekeeping.  Small firefighting units were a major element
of Imperial military doctrine.

In general, all groups (subsector fleets) would have at least one  MAF
available, either intact or divided and deployed as three MCATs.
The Sector Fleet would have a full corps of Line Marines available at
various bases, with their large troop transports, but the fleet would also
have a number of MABs available.  In unruly sectors, there might be 5 or 6 
MABs, while a small or quiescent sector might only have one or two.

In terms of deployment, I always gave each subsector at least 1 patrol
squadron.  This would consist of about a dozen destroyers or destroyer
escorts, with one escort carrier (a 25,000 ton carrier with a reinforced
wing of fighters) and some form of light cruiser (Gionetti or Azhanti
High Ligtning, depending on my mood).    This squadron would also
have either an intact MAF or 3 MCATs attached to it.  If the subsector
had multiple patrol squadrons (pirates, illegal alien problems),  the MCATs
might be split up among the squadrons or additional MAFs assigned.

The MAF/MCAT would be used in the usual "show the flag" operation
or as a rapid intervention team to defuse critical situations.  Such a 
deployment would also alert one or more of the fleet\'s MABs.  If a 
situation arose requiring a full MAB, that deployment would alert the
other MABs and the Line Marines in the sector.  If those forces are sent
in, the Sector Duke would probably need to seriously consider
mobilizing the IA.  Since MCATs, MAFs and MABs all have dedicated
transports, they could respond to any situation in a week or two, while
the Line Marines and IA forces are busy locating transports and stuffing
all their gear into cargo modules.  Anybody who has watched the US Army
trying to load one armored battalion onto a train will appreciate just
how long it takes to move such forces, even if some equipment is
pre-packed or prepositioned.

Anybody have any feedback?  Come on in, the water\'s fine.

PS - Regarding A. Langford\'s quest for non-metallic guns.  Have a
          look at some books on medieval sieges.  Many of the larger 
          bombards were made of wood, bound together with brass rings.
          I also think I remember a picture of a hand gun from that period
          made of similar materials.

PPS - This month\'s Popular Science has an article on Fuel Cells, which
             have caused me a certain amount of grief in my current TNE
             campaign.  One problem; the technology involves hydrogen
             and oxygen freed from water or methane, but FF&S says that
             fuel cells use hydrocarbons (gasoline to us non-chemists).  Can
             anybody shed some light on this?

Again, none of the above reflects the views of my employers.  No way,
no how.

This is some good work.  Thanks folks.

It seems we have a clear conflict here between rules sets.  The *5FW*
shows much smaller forces than both *TCS* and *POT* suggest is available.
Nevertheless, *5FW* is the only source of `official\' naval and army
forces.  On the other hand, the *POT* rules meet the `most recent\' criteria
*and* seem to be more comprehensive - dealing with space and planetary
forces.

The question to be resolved seems to be how do were rectify the current
rules (or *TCS* for that matter) when they suggest a world like Tizon in
the Sword Worlds could have dominated the entire battle field in the 5FW?

Hi Steve,

I wish I could say you are... but. You aren\'t. When GDW-beta list was
playing around with the pre-release stuff we had on FFS (precious little)
it became clear VERY quickly that the most effecient drive that still
fit within reality was the Fusion Rocket - and aside from it\'s nasty side
effects is a beautiful deep-space drive. I designed a number of ships
from that system, and planetary landings aside, Fusion is the best bet.

    One of the things that happened after High Guard came out was a 
major change in the sizes and numbers of Naval vessels cruising about. 
For pre-High Guard CT, 10 400-ton SDBs WAS a major defense force -- 
and a 400-ton patrol cruiser was a real warship, and the Kinunir 
(1200-tons) WAS a Cruiser capable of subduing anything in the 
subsector.  Post-High Guard and "Supplement 9: Fighting Ships" (the 
REAL "Fighting Ships"), 10 SDBs was a joke, not a force.  The Kinunir 
becomes a light escort, comparable (loosely) with the Chyrsanthemum 
and Fer-de-Lance class escorts.  If you are playing in a High 
Guard/MT/TNE universe, do not take anything from early JTAS or very 
early supplements about Naval strength as "canonical".  The "canonical" 
material isn\'t self-consistent; it was composed over at least two 
different "world-views".  You have to decide which world-view you are 
using, and throw out the material that is inconsistent with that view.

    I have been assuming a post-High Guard+ worldview.  It is 
possible, even likely, that the apparent inconsistency between TCS 
strengths and 5FW counters relates to the shift in Naval strength 
between pre-and post-High Guard.  Did 5FW come out before or after 
High Guard?

    I believe that the WAR!  issue of JTAS had designer\'s notes for 
5FW, and how to derive your own defense batallions and SDB strengths.  
Unfortunately, I don\'t have it with me today to look up.  

    Many aspects of Imperial doctrine appear to have be thought up by 
someone who never played a TCS (or similar Naval warfare) campaign; 
they just don\'t work in practice.  For instance, after some TCS 
campaigning, it turns out that the Battlerider/Battleship controversy 
is a non-issue:  if your enemy does not have meson weapons, use 
Battleships, because the jump drive allows you to get your expensive 
hull and jump drive away when your guns and M-drive have been 
crippled, and if he does have meson weapons, use Battleriders because 
a meson hit is just as likely to cripple the J-drive as any other 
system.  With the battleships just as likely to be lost as the 
battlerider, the battlerider\'s ability to carry more weaponry, 
screens, armor and fighters makes a difference.  Proper doctrine 
reduces the vulnerability of the tender -- it should either be fully 
combat capable, or stay the hell away from the battlefield.  

    I think that real Imperial Naval officers, who have 10,000 years 
of space combat experience to draw on, would use doctrines based on 
that experience, that make sense; therefore, I regard most of what was 
said regarding Imperial Naval doctrine in JTAS and Challenge as so 
much hogwash.

Okay, here\'s where I diverge.  I was thinking more along the lines of
`economic\' strength, which I agree is tied to population, than mere naval
strength.  Keep in mind that Gram and Sacnoth are on the same order of
population (6 billion and 3 billion, respectively).  Narsil is at 20
billion but it\'s two TLs below Sacnoth.  Still, in a feudal technocracy,
one tech level is going to make a *tremendous* amount of difference.  (It\'s
like the difference between Japan and Mexico if Japan\'s economic power 
gave it corresponding political power in Mexico.)

I believe I\'ve accepted that these cycles *might* exist and that if they
do they would explain Gram\'s leadership of the Confederation.  My concern
has been that I can\'t see what *causes* these `techno-economic\' cycles
(since we\'ve agreed they have no `real world\' parallel) and that I don\'t
see how they explain the tech level disparities.

I just disagree with you though when you say:

I feel that it takes more than just knowledge.  I don\'t care how much you
know about internal combustion engines, if you can\'t refine oil to make
gasoline and you don\'t have a continental highway network you\'re going
to have a rough time getting your Yugo or Hyundai from Houston to Detroit.
The knowledge may be there on a lower tech world but the corresponding
infrastructure isn\'t.

Please, Hans, I\'ve got a smile on my face right now and there is absolutely
no malice in it.  I\'m enjoying the living daylights out of our discussions.

Well, I think we\'re beginning to see there are some serious conflicts
between *5FW*, *TCS* and the TNE military forces per *POT*.

Hmmm, Steve Bonneville has reported:

Looks like there is a discrepancy *within* *5FW* between the counters (TL 11)
and the map board (TL 10).  Is this the case?

More Hans:

Well, maybe, but this doesn\'t agree with the campaign as it was reported in
*Spinward Marches Campaign*.  According to *SMC*, the Narsil Fleet patrolled
the Darrian border (and eventually lost the disputed worlds in Querion to
the Darrians) while the Sacnoth Fleet patrolled the rimward border and
was eventually destroyed by the Imperial 214th Fleet attacking from Glisten
and occupying what became the Border Worlds.  Note the Narsil Fleet was
deployed against the lower tech Darrians rather than the Imperial Navy.

Well, not exactly.  There are other similarities.  The whole feudal
technocracy thing.  The *JTAS* article on the former Sword Worlds naval
captain who\'s spouse/fiance was killed on their wedding day so she sold
the family estate to buy a ship and chase the killers - nothing more
than Lucas Trask in a dress!

I think this `liberation\' issue is merely a matter of when Piper was 
writing (early 60\'s) versus when GDW was creating Traveller (late 70\'s).
Remember, the GDW material makes a big deal of the `mis-treatment\' of
women in the Sword Worlds.  As Steve Bonneville points out:

>  much like Santanocheev.  [Incidentally, if her name is formed

I think there\'s a great deal of similarity between Piper\'s Sword Worlds
and GDW\'s Sword Worlds on the issue of how women are portrayed/treated.

This sounds like a good rationalization.

Okay, but why suppose these still-unexplained cycles when they\'re not needed
to explain the disparity?  If the different economies are merely at
different stages of development (with higher TL being an indication of
greater `advancement\') there is no need of these cycles.  Then Zhodani aid,
already well established in the canonical material, explains why Gram has
lead the Confederation when one would expect more advanced (higher tech)
Sacnoth to do so.

Ah, but what about *all* those other worlds *outside* the Sword Worlds 
that aren\'t experiencing these cycles?  What `facts\' suggest the Sword
Worlds should be different from the rest of the universe?

Billions?  Really?  Can you cite the sources?  This is interesting from
our allegiance/borders viewpoint too.

> Are the US and Europe and Japan different countries? Yet their economies

No, they\'re not tighly entwined politically *and* economically like the
case would be in a feudal technocracy.  A better example would be, say,
California and, heck, all the other states west of the Rockies put
together.  When California wants federal water in Montana, it gets it.
Largely because of it\'s greater population (which also gives it a larger
economy) which gives it greater political power in the representative
democracy we have here.

> >If the economy is interstellar then political power in interstellar...
> 
> I don\'t see how that follows.

By definition.  In a feudal technocracy, economic power translates *directly*
into political power.  You get to be `king\' because you control the largest
share of stock.

> > Sounds like the Japanese *keiritsu* to me.
> 
> Sounds like a slightly stronger European Union to me.

Yes, it does, except that in Europe representatives are chosen through a
representative democracy that places power in the hands of individuals
equally while in a feudal technocracy (and in the *keiritsu*) those
representatives are chosen by shareholders that place power in the hands
of the owners of production.

I agree.  I would explain this apparent conflict (it\'s a fact Gram has led
for a *long* time but it\'s someone\'s opinion that the Sworld Worlds are
`unstable\') as more cleverly-disguised Imperial propaganda.

[Has anyone realized how convenient this has become for GDW?  By clearly
placing some misleading information in published works (like the library
data in the *Imperial Encyclopedia* that was identified as having a SMART
bias) they (and we) can explain away just about any inconsistency at a
latter date.  Clever, or just lucky?]

Another good point, but it still begs the question of the Imperium not
`dealing with\' the Sword Worlds.

If I\'m Freya Freighters of Sacnoth and I buy a controlling interest in
Loki Levitation of Gram I have not only gained economic influence on Gram
but *political* power as well.  Since, at TL 12, I\'m clearly the strongest
economic power then I\'m going to gain more and more of this sort of
control.  As soon as the King Harald of Sacnoth (thanks, Cynthia) buys
a controlling interest in the holdings of King Angus of Gram, Angus 
becomes Harald\'s *vassal*!  That\'s how a feudal technocracy works.

Some really good stuff, Hans.  BTW, I think you\'ve got the *ihatei* situation
pegged exactly.

        Well, no.  Not really.  Actually, in terms of fuel usage, it is
SLIGHTLY better than the fusion rocket.  But it will never be used if
fusion rockets are available, unless you can live with small
fractional-G acceleration.

        I thought of this a while back.  Military vessels designed by me (as

INSTEAD of Heplar.

        I wish that whichever idiot gave GDW that definition of "point-blank
range" had kept his ignorant mouth shut...
        "point-blank range" has absolutely NOTHING to do with height of the
gun above the ground.  It has much more to do with the little known
detail that bullets, upon leaving the barrel of any gun, rise above the
line of the barrel by a small amount.  Point-blank range is the range
that the bullet has dropped BACK down to the line of the barrel after
that rise.
        Consider this, btw.  If you use GDW\'s definition of point-blank
range, then almost by definition, an anti-aircraft gun of a given muzzle
velocity will have a longer point-blank range than an anti-tank gun of
the same muzzle velocity (the anti-tank gun sits low to the ground
(maybe 2 ft up), while the AA gun sits higher up (typically 5-8 ft, back
when we built AA guns))...

        More thinly populated???  The SW have around 30 gigapeople in them,
all reasonably high tech. Regina subsector can only claim about 7
gigapeople, Rhylanor about 25, Vilis less than 10...
        Plus, of course, the 50-200 ships per subsector is ridiculously low
BY TCS STANDARDS.  In my game, Neubayern had several thousand warships,
New Colchis had more like 10,000 ships.  All the Islands together
amounted to about the resource base of the SW, and collectively, they
could muster over 1000 warships in the 50,000T+ range, plus a few more
thousand in the 10,000-50,000T range, plus another bunch in the
1000-10,000T range, plus fighters (a total of over 100,000 fighters in
the Islands).
        Besides all that, if you assume only 40-odd major Sword Worlds
warships, then the SW are in the same position the Islands were in when
the game began: any squadron of Tigresses could beat up their Naval
Forces all by itself.  Frankly, any single Tigress could beat up the SW
Fleet if it is only 40 major combatants...


> It may be hard to imagine but it\'s consist with canonical material.

        Do yourself a favour, and learn to ignore canonical material when it
is clearly pretty stupid.  Regina may have had 10 400T SDBs, but if it
did, ask yourself "Why?"
        There is no military use for them (any of Neubayern\'s Flower class
escorts (of which there were more than a thousand) could take all ten
SDBs at once.
        There is no real civilian use for them (other than to let pirates
run amok through the Regina system) - remember that Regina orbits a gas
giant, and has a HUGE jump-limit to patrol - thye couldn\'t patrol it
adequately with ten of ANYTHING, much less SDBs that are no match for a
well-equipped pirate.
        Customs cutters?  They\'d need more than ten, given that large
jump-limit, unless Regina has civilian traffic amounting to no more than
30-40 ships per day arriving/departing.  And if that is all the civilian
traffic Regina has, then Regina\'s starport must be smaller than the port
of New Orleans...

        There were designer\'s notes for FFW in one of the Journals...

        Au contraire, mon vieux...Impy doctrine (which is frankly idiotic)
assumes that the battle for the gas giant between the enemy fleet and
your SDBs will be the crucial part of the defense of any system.  It is
SUPPOSED to prevent the enemy from refueling before your Fleet can reach
the GG where they arrived, thus allowing you to pound them into bloody
paste before they can escape.
        Admittedly, this isn\'t worth a pile of warm spit in terms of Naval
Doctrine.  I point out, for those who are interested, that in only ONE
case in my TCS game did a Fleet jump in to a gas giant, rather than
arriving at the 100 diameter limit of the main world.  And that one case
came because the attacker wanted the enemy to know he was coming, so as
to cause the enemy to be deceived as to the objective of the attack.
        In all other cases, the ships jumped in using drop tanks (and aso
arrived with enough fuel to leave, if they had to), and arrived at the
100 diameter limit, thus allowing the target only an hour or two warning
before the attack began for a response to be formed...

        Faced with defeat by Ihatei?!?   What a concept!!!  I suppose
Regina\'s ten 400T SDBs might be faced with defeat by Ihatei, if the
Ihatei could get in that far, but I find it hard to believe that any
_important_ Impy force could be defeated by the Ihatei...
        Can someone out there design a TL14 ship of no more than 30,000T
that can fight off an attack by an Impy BatRon as long as there are at
least 100 of them present?  I admit that using TNE rules, this is much
more possible than it was under either HG or MT, but it is still pretty
unlikely...

Any suggestions for a name for this gun?  

John Bogan <john.bogan@asb.com> replied to me:

The Garnett

That gun was designed by Guy Garnett (Wildstar@quark.qrc.com), longtime 
TML member and coordinator of the TNE-Pocket sublist and admin of the GDW-
Beta sublist.  

GDW-Beta was formed to test some of the design sequences in FF&S, and 
Guy tried to re-create a real-life Soviet anti-tank rifle from the 1930\'s (PK
something)
using the small arms design rules.  Upon seeing the result, he called it the
"poor man\'s fusion gun".  POT describes its use EXACTLY as he envisioned.


Guy also has a regular column, "House Rules", in _The Traveller Chronicle_,
a new Traveller magazine now gearing up for its fifth issue.


I say give credit where credit is due.  The Garnett Gun it is.

Been thinking about the portrayal of the Sword Worlders in the official
campaign material.  Let\'s look a little closer at the "Contact" article
on the Sword Worlders from *JTAS* #18.

On the status of women:

"Sword Worlds society is militaristic and male-dominated, women having a
much more subordinate position than in the Imperium."

Sounds bad, right?  Here\'s the specifics:

"Almost without exception, men fill important public offices, business
positions, and high military commands.  While women are not legally or
culturally prohibited from any occupation, any woman in a `male\' profession
is expected to exhibit male rather than female behavior (at least in public).
The reverse, however, is not true.  Men may never exhibit female behaviors
(in public at least) without losing face."

Sounds more like the US today, or at least in 1970.

On the instability of Sword Worlds governments and interworld rivalry
let\'s look at the historical timeline:

- -189  First interstellar government, the Sacnoth (or First) Dominate, formed.
- -102  First Dominate falls in First War of Rebellion, various individual
      and multiworld governments exist.
 104  Triple Dominion formed
 217  Triple Dominion falls, again various smaller governments prevail.
 604  Second Dominate formed after First Frontier War.
 698  Gram Coalition overthrows Second Dominate
 788  Trilateral Alliance replaces Gram Coalition after loss in Darrian War.
 848  Trilateral Alliance falls, replaced by Gram government four years
      later.
1110  Border Worlds break-off after Imperial occupation following the 
      Fifth Frontier War.

Thus, we have six governments ruling for over 700 years over a period
of nearly 1300 years (not counting the Border Worlds).  Prior to the
current government (c1110) at Gram each Sword Worlds government lasted
an average of approximately 90 years - three generations, which is pretty
good for a feudal system.  The most recent government had existed for
over 260 years by 1110!  The interregnum between the current government
and the previous one was only four years.  There was virtually no
interregnum in the two government changes prior to the last one which
means the Sword Worlds have had a single interstellar government, albeit
with changes in the seat of government, almost continuously since the
Second Dominate was formed in 604 - over half a millenia and nearly half
the life of the Third Imperium!

Imperial propaganda: "a battle for the hearts and minds" indeed!

I too felt a little uncomfortable with the religious comparisons made a
while back.  I think a good rule to follow when considering making some
comment about another group is to consider a similar comment made
about the corresponding group that you identify with.  You might have
a little insight then into what you might be doing to someone else.

If you must have a group to `put upon\' stick with fictional ones like

The _Dinimbue_-class express boat, or "xboat", has been used by the
IISS Communications Office for centuries as one of the workhorses of
the Imperial communications network.  Optimized for their job, the 
ships are unsuited for almost any task besides carrying electronic
xmail.  The ship carries extensive databanks and a powerful and 
triply backed-up maser communicator.  Only one communicator is
meant to be powered at a time; the radio is for emergencies and
xboat tender retrieval operations only.  The class is named after
the professor at the University of Sylea who, in 624, designed the
infamous "Poni Express" insignia which has since adorned all IISS 
Communications Office ships and crews.

DESIGNER\'S NOTES:  This is an attempt to capture the spirit of
the old CT xboat design using the FF&S/Brilliant Lances ship design
rules.  Since any size ship may now carry jump drives, the ship
was simply reduced in size by a factor of five, to the minimum
possible size.  The ship is state-of-the-art for the late 600s
Imperial, when the xboat net was started.  To accurately reflect
the high proportion of fuel to cargo, those hits have been spelled
out explicitly in the damage table rather than using the standard
"Hold" result.  (Typical practice in my designs...a little more
realistic.)  Since the sensors are a bit sub-par (which seems to
fit well with the concept and GDW\'s typical designs), I assume that 
the tender has a beacon which makes it easy for the xboat to
to center its\' commaser.  The old "80% for quantity purchase of
class ships discount" is applied in parentheses under price.
Like the classic xboat, it\'s a sitting duck.

Iwo Lyon                                Born 1180  Giga, Frontier
Str-7  Agl-A  Con-8  Int-6  Edu-4  Chr-5  Soc-4
Iwo was born and grew up on the planet Giga which is located in the 
region of sparse stellar population at the edge of NeoSol subsector known 
as the frontier.  When he was 12 raiders? or a scout force from an 
mini empire across the frontier raided his Windrider village.  Led by a 
man known only as Gushmegne, they massacred almost everyone they could 
find including Iwo\'s father, mother and brothers.  In 1193 he was found 
by a NeoSol Federation Scout wandering through the desert regions of Giga 
in a catatonic state.  The scout took him in and carried him back to his 
home on the planet Aurigae.  The trauma on Giga had awakened Iwo\'s 
nascent Psi abilities and contact with a secret order on Aurigae served 
to develop them further.  The members of this order are the gaurdians of 
a merging of Psi Abilities and Martial Arts known simply as The Way.  
There are 5 facets of the way that are inherent in an individual just as 
Psionic abilities are inherent.  Trauma and training awaken them.  When 
the Union of Senled invaded Nemo in 1198 his adoptive family was killed 
by a ballistic missile attack(conventional) on their home city.  This 
trauma awakened the second way in Iwo.  After this he joined the crew of 
a far trader owned and operated by BJ Eyzaguirre.  He has used this 
position to smuggle TL 10 weapons to the TL 6,7 Nemon National League.  
His life filled with tradgedy he no longer smiles and always has a look 
on intensity on his face.  He has devoted himself to practicing the two 
Ways he knows and seeks adventure to awaken the others.  He also will 
look for ways to assist the Nemon National League and hates any 
representative of the Union of Senled.  

Iwos conventional skills should be appropriate to a junior spacehand.
Added to these skills
UAMA-6 Stealth-3  Riding-2

****Iwo only has experience with the first two ways****

The Five Facets of the Way are
1)The Way of the Shining Path( Hand Strike -4)
  Microtelekenesis combined with hand strikes, gives a hand strike some  
  penetration ability.  Say Pen of 2 if it penetrates then does full 
damage, otherwise no damage.

2)Way of the Breeze (Enhanced Stealth treat as Stealth-8)
This way enables the user to move about being very difficult to see or hear

3)Way of the Comet (Super Speed)
Using teleportation this allows super fast movement.  Say Psi Level * 
10m/turn) 

4)The Way of the Hurricane (TK Blast)
This is simply an area effect TK Blast of great power.  Car flipper, wall 
buckler at higher levels.

5) The Awareness of Reality (Ultimate Way--Masters Only)
The Awareness of reality is the most difficult and possibly the most 
powerful way.  It enables the practitioner to "fold" things in and out of 
reality.  It is in a sense sort of a PsiTransfer that functions as a 
black globe sort of thing.  It absorbs energy impacting it (up to some 
max) and the user can store this energy of short periods of time then 
dumping it into his or her own Psi based attacks, actions etc.  I havent 
quite figured out how to formulate this but suggestions are welcome.  
Just like a globe it can be overloaded and prevents communication across 
it.  This included Psi communication?  

Each way requires one combat action to activate and pulls from some pool 
of UAMA and Psi-Level.  I havent had the chance to really sit down and 
work this out in detail but I have the main idea pretty much to my 
satisfaction.  I think that I havent introduced anything in direct conflict 
with any era of traveller.  It certainly adds an element of space opera 
to the universe.  Can you imagine Masters of the Way battling it out in 
some high port while the PCs get caught in the middle.  I know some of 
you might say I should play champions for this but as I said there is no 
direct conflict with the Traveller Universe here and I think it adds to 
my campaign (at least in my head).

Solon Maghib enlisted in the Navy at the age of 17 where he soon 
expressed an interest and aptitude for the Special forces.  He joined the 
SPACR (Space Planetary and Atmospheric Combat Regiment) at the end of his 
first term and distinguished himself.  At the end of his 2nd term he was 
selected to attend OCS.  Graduating from there he was soon promoted to 
the rank of Sub-Lt.  Much of his activity is classified but he did 
recieve a commendation for his part in closing down the Gamma project.  A 
geneering experiment initiated by a private consortiun whose subjects 
where kidnapped from low tech worlds.  During his 4th term his family was 
killed in the well known Icarus incident where the Destroyer Icarus 
vented its thrusters inside a docking bay killing 518 people. (See Ammel 
Brodrig)  He left the Navy at the end of this term and move to Enope 
where he spent his time carving stone and wood, living off of the land.  
While on one of his treks through the wilderness of Enope he discovered a 
diamond.  It was not long after that he was framed for murders of two 
junior constables.  The local  Chief Constable Ulysses Stark was on the case 
and he discovered evidenve that Solon did not commit the murder.  It was 
Aaron Nessus, the son of a man who was regionally(planetwise) powerful.  
The Constable came upon Nessus holding Solon at gunpoint bragging about 
how he framed him for the murders.  When U Stark ordered him to drop the 
weapon Nessus instead aimed for the Constable, He was shot dead by The 
Constable U Stark.  Far from being heros both Solon and U Stark found 
life very difficult on Enope after that.  When given the oppurtunity to 
leave Solon joined Amara Adan of NeoSol Systems Corp and her Corporate 
Action Team.  

From an interview of Solon Maghib by a local news service on Enope

For some reason people have this concept that the SPACR drops from orbit 
on top of the enemy and starts blazing away. Wrong.  Thats very unlikely 
and happens only when something has gone very wrong.  We are much more 
likely to spend two weeks hiding in the rafters of some warehouse on a 
clandestine spotting and observation mission.  You never know when 
there\'s one of us around.  Could be one reading this over your shoulder 
right now.  Don\'t look! too late you\'re DEAD!  They teach us so much, but 
they don\'t teach us how to cope back in the real world.  When my family 
was killed in the Icarus incident.  I broke from what I thought was 
real.  I left the Navy and moved to Enope where I formed reality from 
stone and wood through sculpture...

Thats gonna have to be it for today, Ill try to get the other 3 or 4 on

Thanks!

For your enjoyment, here is the original design and commentary.  PLEASE NOTE
that this item was written PRIOR to the publication of FF&S, and that
I haven\'t corrected the FF&S stats for this gun from the PRELIMINARY
version of FF&S, so the FF&S design IS NOT CORRECT as stated below.  The gun
as given in _Path of Tears_ and _RCES Equipment Guide_ *HAS* been corrected
to the final version of FF&S, and is as correct as the rules allow.

Personally, I prefer the "real world" stats, which are provably more correct
than any of the FF&S-generated information.  The second column of the design
table below gives the actual values for the real-world gun, as accurately as
I have been able to determine them.  Feel free to use these in place of the
FF&S statistics.

If a lot of the following sounds familiar to purchasers of _Path of Tears_,
well, this materials was used (with permission) by GDW for both POT and the
_RCES Equipment Guide_.



- ----8<---- The following is a post originally dated October 29, 1993:

This is (yet another) small arms design; tonite I\'ll knock off of the
small arms and see if I can design a Ilyushin Il2m3 (better known as
the Shturmovik) to check out the aircraft design sequences.  That plane\'s
armor should be, um, challenging, in the FF&S system.

No longer do your TL-5, xenophobic natives have to cower in fear of
Reformation Coalition backed Star Vikings.  Have the local warlord call
up a few squads of these "poor man\'s fusion guns".  With Ball ammunition
(locally producable at TL-5), they can penetrate TL-10 Battle Dress and any
Combat Armor.  With DS ammunition (a TL-8 item), these weapons have damage 
and penetration equal to (or better than, particularly at longer ranges)
the FGMP-14 and FGMP-15 and can effectively defeat all forms of personal
armor, as well as the side, deck, belly, and turret armor of the G-Carrier
and the Grav Tank.  

Given their relative low cost, particularly when compared to their high-tech 
opponents Battle Dress (Cr220,000) and Fusion Gun (Cr54,000), these weapons 
are clearly very cost-effective.

Notes:
1 - Whenever two figures are given, the first is for ball (an option for
Armor-Piercing Incendiary would have been nice) and the second is for the
"high-tech" (TL-8) Discarding Sabot round.
2 - Figuring the internal magazine as a box magazine that\'s permanently
attached to the weapon.  I\'m also using the grams to kilograms "fix" that
I mentioned in my first weapon design.

Comments: Yes, this really was a real gun.  Originally designed as a man
portable, anti-tank small arms rifle by the Soviets during WWII, the gun
was quickly outclassed by the rapidly improving armor protection of
German tanks.  The cartridge lives on as the ammuntion for the TL-6 KPV
machinegun (found on many Soviet armored vehicles and anti-aircraft
defenses).  The gas-operated action of this rifle (scaled down, of course)
found its way into the SKS rifle.

All in all, I\'m not really very happy with this FF&S design; the weapon
came out more than twice as heavy as it should have (a hundred-and-fifteen
pound rifle).  I think the problem here is that the FF&S design system is
too linear; if you push on the high end, you get guns that are much too big 
and heavy, and if you push on the low end, you get things like 10mm (cal) 
by 3mm (long) cartridges and guns that are much too light.

I note that the two biggest contributors to the weight of this gun are the
receiver and the bipod.  Both of these are directly proportional to the
muzzle energy of the weapon.  One (probably the bipod) or both of these
formulae are definitely wrong.  One "fix" might be to make the bipod a
multiple of the mass of the weapon (probaby 1/10th the mass of the weapon,
minimum 1kg) instead of basing it on muzzle energy.


Tactical Considerations:
The close range of this weapon exceeds the extreme range of every fusion
gun except the FGMP-14 and -15, and the short range equals or exceeds the
extreme range of any of the fusion guns.  The best use of these weapons
would be long-range fire at the attackers, from behind cover (preferably
cover strong enough to resist an extreme-range fusion gun strike) or
sniping from outside the range of their weapons.  If this is impossible 
(and it frequently is), then a series protected positions likeley to suprise 
the enemy are good (around a corner in a corridor, for example).

Game Use:
This weapon (or rather, one using the "real world" stats and not the FF&S
design, which is completely impractical) could be quite useful to anti-RC
forces in the New Era.  A relatively low-tech design, it is quite capable
of being manufactured by many worlds in the Wilds.  Although the DS
ammunition is probably going to be considerably harder to produce, there
will probably be a number of worlds equipped with it.  As Star Viking
activities expand, it is very likeley that traders operating in the wilds
will find a demand for this type of weapon.

Several adventure plotlines are possible around this weapon; one which 
suggests itself to me is probably obvious.  The players (RCES or \'Lancers) 
attempt a smash-n-grab on some TL-5 to TL-7 dictator.  They expect an easy 
time of it.  Pull this one on your players after they\'ve done two or three 
of the same type of missions in a row and have had a chance to get 
overconfident and complacent.  Suprise them with the weapon; without the DS 
ammunition, it shouldn\'t be too deadly, but should (if employed well) be 
able to prevent the PCs from accomplishing some or all of their objectives.  
Drive home to them in a practical sort of way how difficult their lives 
would be if lots of worlds had them.  Later developments in the campaign can
involve efforts to stop free traders from spreading the guns (or the designs)
around the area.  Another one might have to do with discovering that someone
is producing DS ammunition.

- ----8<---- End of original post.


An interesting additional scenario or plot complication has occurred to me
since then.  POT and RCESEG use the FF&S stats for this weapon, which place
it at over a hundred pounds - considerably heavier than the \'real thing\',
and severely limiting mobility with the weapon.  One option would be to
assume that the version of the weapon that is being distributed throughout
the wilds by Free Traders has been considerably over-engineered (making it
even *more* rugged, reliable, dirt-tolerant and generally idiot-proof that
is usual for even a Soviet weapon).  Considering that most of the metal
parts are probably about twice as thick as they need to be, you could
probably club someone with it and not loose accuracy.  The thing should be
easy to field-strip, easy to maintain, and shouldn\'t malfunction even under
considerable provocation.

Once the players think that they\'ve got the drawbacks of this weapon
identified, you can spring the \'lightweight\' version on them.  This would be
the \'real world\' weight weapon, and is considerably more portable than the
FF&S version.  A logical place to do this would be to decide that some world
at around TL-5 or TL-6 invented this weapon on its own, for native use.  It
would also be a bit more fragile than the \'heavy\' version, requiring some
skill in its use to keep it in top working order.

One final caveat when using this gun in a RC campaign (particularly in one
based on scenarios in _Path of Tears_).  The POT sourcebook also contains
some RCES \'improved\' armor, with an armor value of 6 (probably specifically
designed by the RC to protect against this gun).  While this is a reasonable
thing for the RC to do, it\'s worth a second thought for a role-playing
campaign.

With AV-6 armor, RC troops are relatively well (although not perfectly)
protected against the gun, significantly reducing the threat to your PCs.
This is good, in that PCs won\'t die, but bad in that to increase the level
of the threat you (as referee) have only one option: to introduce DS
ammunition.  This will unfortunately increase the amount of damage the gun
can do to PC-deadly levels.  The "average" damage would be 21 points (33 if
you roll D10s for damage the way I do).

I personally recommend AV-5 combat armor against the ball-equipped gun.
This will allow 2 dice of damage through, which is a crediable threat but
one unlikely to kill PCs with a single shot.  Use the (rare and expensive)
DS ammunition against vehicular and battle dress equipped targets with an AV
of around 8 to 10.  Again, the idea is to provide a credible threat without
an inordinate risk killing PCs with a single lucky shot.  An average of 7
(11 with d10 damage dice) points is enough to make anybody sit up and take
notice, but not so much that they\'ll be dead before they can react.

I realize that, as the referee, you can \'save\' any PCs you feel like by
rolling a disproportinate number of misses, assigning hits to NPCs, or even
managing to throw 6 dice and not roll any number higher than a two (aren\'t
referee screens wonderful devices?).  But having to do this (or the reverse,
and consistently giving all the \'breaks\' to the bad guys) indicates a poor
scenario design or a poor balance between the PCs and the opposition.
Sooner or later the PCs will catch on, and it\'ll be bad for both their
morale and for theis suspension of disbelief.  It\'s better to get it right
in the first place than to have to make \'fixes\' for the rest of your
campaign.


Well, there you have it - the Garnett Gun.  Enjoy!

<bing!> Wrong, but thanks for playing. See FF&S page 70, column 2, para
3, "FC"; "Fuel consumption, in tonnes, per hour per tonne of thrust."
                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So the Fusion Rocket line should actually be:

Fusion rocket   9.0 ton   0.00035 ton/hr.     0.000350 ton/hr

This makes the Daedalus slightly better, but still nothing like an order
of magnitude.

What REALLY worries me, though, is the fuel efficiency of AZHRAE
engines.  Has anyone actually tried to design a tech 8 surface-to-orbit
vehicle (NASP or similar)?  As far as I can see, it\'s not actually
possible to carry enough fuel to make orbit from an Earth-sized world.
(I\'ll go into details of the calculation only if necessary.)  Does
anybody have a fully-worked design for something of this sort?

>Any comments? Am I reading this wrong?

Only that table heading - and there are still big problems.

XTML will be provided in nightly, biweekly, and archive bundle digest
format (just like TML).

To SUBSCRIBE to XTML, mail xboat-request@engrg.uwo.ca.
To SEND ARTICLES to XTML, mail xboat@engrg.uwo.ca.

Eventually, XTML will be rejoined with an improved, tech level 8 TML,
coming hopefully within the next year (something like this will be
necessary anyway in order for me to manage the administrative load). The
Advanced TML will introduce:

        o topical filtering of TML - the digests will only include
          topics you have a stated interest in. Key topic identifier
          strings will be required on the subject line so the filters
          can recognize content.

        o a robotic list admin to handle subscription, unsubscription,
          address changes delivery frequency, and personal topic-filter
          changes

        o higher-reliability message digestion (this has been bugging me
          lately, folks).

Mea culpa -- you caught me making an overly broad statement.  Let me
try that line again:
  "First, viruses *tend* to be very species specific."

Both influenza and rabies are examples of multi-species virii.
As far as I know, however, they are still both limited to class
Mammalia.  Influenza is unstable genetically, which is why there
are so many flu strains and why coming up with effective vaccines
is so hard.  Bubonic plague is caused by a bacterium, _Yersinia
pestis_ (unless they\'ve changed their mind about the genus again),
so it\'s a slightly different story.  Many non-viral microorganisms
could be expected to have effects in alien ecologies that are 
chemically similar to our own, especially those involved in 
decomposition.  The bacteria and fungi work directly on the
chemical structure of an organism, giving them a lot of food
opportunities.  

Viruses are another story.  Typically, viruses have a "host range"
of organisms they can infect, and usually this range is limited
to one species.  From what I recall, a virus targets it\'s quarry
based on the chemical antigens and structure of the surface of the
preferred cell.  (So HIV attacks certain white-blood cells, but 
not, for example, nerve cells.)  So a virus will typically be 
optimized to attack one specific sub-system, and sometimes the 
optimization is very very specific.  The viruses that attack
multiple species are usually targeting very similar cell types.

Furthermore, the target cell needs to be able to interact with
the DNA or RNA strand the virus releases.  If the alien isn\'t
DNA/RNA based, or simply can\'t produce the parts the virus needs
for construction, the infection won\'t work.

There are usually subtle differences between cells even in similar
species, especially at the cell membrane level viruses use to
recognize potential targets.

Conceivably, a virus designed to affect all Terran mammals could
infect the vargr, since vargr are Terran mammals, and members of
a genus in class Mammalia related to _Canis_.  But all external
similarities aside, a human should be more closely related 
genetically to a strand of kelp than to an aslan, or any other
alien.  (In Traveller this may not be true.  But then, the aliens
in Traveller are more science-fantasy than reality, of course.)

Targeting specific species would be simpler.  You just have to
pick a cell type unique to the population that you are targeting.
This sort of thing might make a horror like a disease that prefers
Vilani or Zhodani, for the most part, possible.  You really
couldn\'t *trust* such a thing, since the human minor races are so
closely related, but someone might try.

I suppose one could speculate about the existence of a Lucanian
biowar weapon that did target several species, not necessarily a
virus, that mainly was meant to nail humans.  That might have some
interesting effects on future history -- the former territory of
the Imperium might end up being dominated by a number of very 
non-human alien species that were unaffected by the weapon and
thus lucked into ready-made pocket empires early on.  Some of 
the nastier may have even helped the weapon along....

Yuck.  This is getting ugly.  As far as I know, the Imperium
never used CBW, although they did stockpile some in the Marches
during the bitter Third Frontier War.  The Second Empire of
Gashikan did mount a particularly despicable attempt at 
xenocide in the -1400s (31st century AD) against the entire
vargr species, using a series of microbes.  The vargr stopped
it, but almost all the vargr in Gashikan sector died.  It was
the worst part of a long series of interspecies wars set off
by the Sack of Gashikan in -1658 (AD 2860).  Note that only
the vargr were targeted.  An Ancient biowar weapon seriously
depopulated Zhdant, but it was targeted primarily at the world\'s
(now extinct) Droyne population...and who knows *how* it worked;
it was an Ancients weapon.  (Besides, it was out of character.
Not only did it not kill all the humans, it was misdelivered
and didn\'t hit right until after the Zhodani had space-flight.
Usually Ancient weapons seem to hit whatever they attacked, and
destroy whatever they hit.)

Discussions of the viability of the GDW VIRUS are similar to discussions
of the existence of God: there are two sides and neither can be
conclusively argued.

Possibly VIRUS is not properly named, or is the common reference used
for what is involved.  This is similar to my work at a wastewater
treatment plant - we use bacteria and algae to treat wastewater but most
of the workers refer to these biological organisms as \'bugs\' which they
are not.

From my understanding the VIRUS was developed from research of a silicon
life form.  This life form is completely unlike anything that exists on
Earth in 1994 so we, the members of TML, may very well have gross
misconceptions of this beastie.  This life form seems to exist as
computer code that is able to burn new circuits much as we can construct
various forms of habitats to increase our quality of life.  In so doing
this VIRUS, as it is called by the humans whose computers it has taken
control of, has decided to use those computers to control the various
forms of equipment in meeting an agenda of its own.

If this were merely a computer virus it well could be said to be
unbelievable.  Even as it is I feel that GDW simply used it as a plot
device to bring about the transition from MT to TNE (I wonder if thios
much banter goes on re. the transition from TSR\'s AD&D (TM) to the 2nd
edition rules?

would like to introduce a new type of ammunition/weapon that I have 
played withand might start using.  The goal is the beloved Blaster of 
SciFi fame.  I wont post this in standard weapon form because it is 
really intended to initiate discussion.

This weapon is the Magnum Bolt Rifle.  It is compact,  at 60cm and 
beefy at about 6.8 kg loaded.  A fat weapon.  At 60cm its short 
enough to be a sort of heavy blaster.  It fires a round that has as its 
base a 20mm x 32mm Straight ETC cartridge.  This gives Ea of 8500J.  
The rules bending is this.  One of the available ammo aside from Heap and 
DS is a Plasma Pulse Cartridge that sits on the end of the ETC 
cartridge.  It is ballistic tipped.  The ETC cartridge initiates the 
"reaction" in the PPC.  A micro piezo electric fuze in the ballistic cap 
discharges the plasma stream upon impact.  It is in a sense a Super HEAP 
round.  Dont ask me how it works.  It is in effect a ballistically 
delivered plasma pulse.  The special effect would be that the cartridge 
glows because of the heat and it fails completey after about 0.5 s when 
you just get a 20 meter stream of plasma.  Maybe doing 1D6 burn damage to 
anybody in the stream hexes.?..A PPC about this size is a 3D6 attack.  
The round energy with a 20 cm barrell gives 5D6? So the total would be 
about 8D6?  It would have a pen of 1-1-1 but a max range of 200m because 
of the cartridge consumption. So....you get a large caliber weapon that 
fires a glowing bolt at about 400 m/s (slow enough to be seen?) That will 
punch right through battle dress.  You get the range of a slug weapon 
with the Pen of a Plasma weapon.  Think about it, ballistically delivered 
fusion cartridges?  And after about 200m you get a bright streamer.  Even 
better the thing gives off a bright explosion? when it hits a target 
inside 200m.  Hell, if you dont like my bolt ammo just look and see what 
a rifle firing 20mm x 32 mm Heap ammo can do.  That alone would make an 
extremely devastating but still compact weapon.  I can see it now, the 
Battle Dress trooper at TL 10 coming down and seeing these guys in 
T-Shirts with some short compact weapon and while theyre laughing hearing a 
kaboom and wondering where that hole through his chest armor came from.  
As soon as I find my FF&S Ill formalize all this stuff.  But the Magnum 
Rifle is something Im definitely gonna dump in a campaign...

given up through the Cluster Liberation War.

     _Rorke\'s Drift_ class Heavy Cruiser

CA-1 Rorke\'s Drift CA-N6368F3-090100-00E08-0 MCr30,626.8 35,000 tons
batteries bearing      D    1 9  Crew=296.
batteries        F    1 A  TL=12.
Low=273. Cargo=806. Fuel=13,300. EP=2800. Agility=6. Marines=250.

Notes: Ship has frozen watch, fuel scoops, purification plant.

This is the original _Rorke\'s Drift_ design. 60 of these ships were built 
for the NFN, all named for famous battles fought on Earth. This version 
of the ship saw action during both the Old Islands War, in which six were 
lost, and the Topas War. Following the Topas War, FAdm Connor commented 
that the lack of armour made this class to vulnerable to risk against 
capital ships.

The surviving cruisers received the Series A refit in 5630.

CA-1 Series A CA-N6368H4-090300-N0009-0 MCr30,670.5 35,000 tons
batteries bearing    D  1 9 Crew=281.
batteries      F  1 A TL=12(14).
Low=641. Cargo=676. Fuel=13,300. EP=2800. Agility=6. Marines=1000.

Notes: Ship has frozen watch, scoops, plant. The refit cost MCr1,330.47 
per ship and took 14 weeks.

The Series A _Rorke\'s Drift_ received the new Missile-A bays and a laser 
spinal mount, and also had the Marine contingent greatly expanded, from 
two companies to a heavily reinforced battalion.

The added accomodations for the Marines came in handy, as the _Rorke\'s 
Drift_ class was called on to perform several disaster relief missions 
throughout the Cluster in the next few years--the Marines were frequently 
replaced with medical personnel.

In addition to the disaster relief missions, the class also saw action in 
the Serendip War. 34 of them were at the Second Battle of Neubayern, and 
13 of them were lost or damaged beyond repair.

When the Imperials invaded, eleven ships were hidden in deep space, and 
the remaining thirty were removed to the safe worlds. There they received 
the Series B refit.

CA-1 Series B CA-N6368J4-000700-N000A-0 MCr35,315.2 35,000 tons
batteries bearing    1 Y Crew=410.
batteries      1 Z TL=12(15).
Passengers=30. Low=720. Cargo=647. Fuel=3640. EP=2800. Agility=6. 
Marines=1000.   Y=51, Z=60

Notes: Ship has frozen watch, scoops, plant.  Has an NH3 fuel system, 
Helson-Canomaar Overdrive jump system, and enhanced output maneuver drive.  
Carries one 30-ton small craft.  Has 1800 ton missile magazine (600 
battery-rounds).  Carries 40 ER missile controllers.  Missiles have 
anti-missile fire control capability.  Has enough fuel for four jumps 
before refueling.  The refit cost MCr22,691.7 and took 48 weeks.

The Series B _Rorke\'s Drift_ is representative of the other Series B 
refits. An NH3 fuel system was installed, reducing the fuel mass to 52% 
of normal. The newly-developed Helson-Canomaar Overdrive system was also 
added (this was the most expensive single component), reducing the jump 
fuel requirement by a factor of ten. Combined, this allowed a ship to 
jump with 5.2% of the pre-refit fuel requirement.

This enourmous savings in space mostly went to weapons.  Using the 
multi-bay system, which allows more bays than normal to be carried at the 
cost of doubled tonnage requirements for each \'extra\' bay, 60 100-ton 
missile bays were added. All missile bays were equipped with anti-missile 
fire control, which allows a missile bay to act as a repulsor bay of 
three factors lower. Also, enough magazine space was added to support ten 
turns of ER missile fire. During the Cluster Liberation War, these ships 
carried exclusively Kinetic Energy missiles. These missiles do damage 
like a nuclear missile, but aren\'t affected by nuclear dampers and have a 
- -2 penalty to hit. 

The older Series A ships were reactivated late in the CLW, but were used 
primarily to mop up Imperial stragglers. The Series B ships performed 
with distinction during the War, though. Even with the improved nuclear 
dampers and anti-missile fire control, they were still too vulnerable to 
go toe-to-toe with Imperial capital ships--instead, they fired ER 
missiles from beyond the Imperial\'s range.

The high point of the class\' career was the Battle of Pamraeltan. The 
Imperial Naval Base in that system was to be the jumping-off point for 
the Imperial\'s planned reconquest of the Islands following their initial 
defeats there. They had mustered a sizeable force led by a _Tigress_ 
class battleship. The Alliance Navy had learned of the Imperial plan, and 
launched a preemptive strike on the Imperial fleet as it was being 
assembled. During the ensuing battle, a squadron of _Rorke\'s Drift_ class 
cruisers fired a single salvo of KE missiles at the Imperial flagship, 
rendering it dead in space and badly damaging its weapons and fuel tanks. 
Before the Imperials could get there flagship to safety, it was destroyed 
by an Alliance planet-buster.

But according to the only _Traveller_ rules we have on the subject (_TCS_)
technology _dosn\'t_ make that much difference. If you look at the credit 
conversion table you\'ll see that the credits of two worlds with the same 
starport type (which I take in this context to mean the same level of trade)
differ by only 5% per TL. Now, I\'m not an economics major. Perhaps that
notion is as ridiculous as some of the mistakes that I am able to spot. 
But since I don\'t know any better I\'m arguing from those tables. With
twice the population of Sacnoth Gram is nearly twice as powerful as Sacnoth
economically.

We don\'t agree on that. We have plenty of real world parallels for economic
cycles. Since we agree that a lower-than-15 TL can only be due to economic
reasons, economic instability _should_ result in TL instability. (Btw. I\'m
not so sure we don\'t have any examples of that. Didn\'t some farmers put
their cars in the barn and go back to the horse waggon during the Great
Depression?).

Make that steamships instead and you have a better analogy, since the ships
of space don\'t need any highways. Even if you can\'t produce boiler plates
you may still be able to rivet them together when they come apart.

No offense taken. I do mean that, but I also direct you to the word \'try\'.
If different sources disagree we have to choose between them, and in most 
cases I\'d be inclined to choose the role-playing source over the board
game source. I\'d be happier if we could reconcile them, but it\'s just not
possible. _TCS_ gives much bigger fleets than is present in 5FW.

I had forgotten that. OK, consider the above retracted. 5FW forces are just

I said \'little more\'. You\'re right on both above counts. But Elaine would

I think so too, but what\'s that got to do with it? It _is_ a pretty
significant difference between the two societies.

Mistreatment? Men and women are assigned different roles in society,
thereby denying some women the chance to fulfill their potential (and
some men too, btw.) That\'s not good, but I wouldn\'t call it mistreatment.
On top of that women have a safety valve in that they are accepted in 
\'male\' roles provided they adopt \'male\' behaviour. Males are never
accepted in \'female\' roles.

As Steve Bonneville points out:

Nothing contradictory in that. Riksdattar is a female accepted in a \'male\'
role. And apparently she\'s really accepted, not just tolerated (Either
that or she\'s the daughter of a king. \'Rik\' is a nordic name, but it
could also mean \'realm\').

Except to explain why it took Gram 14 centuries to go from TL 12 to TL 11.
OK, there\'s been some civil wars in between, but they\'ve had centuries
since the 3FW. This _could_ be explained by a slow, steady, uneventful
economic rise over the centuries with, say, a TL per two centuries. Or
it could be an economic roller-coaster that pulls one world two steps
back every time it get one step ahead. Personally, knowing how today\'s
industrial magnates love to screw around with each other, the second
picture seems much more likely than the first.

First of all, how do you know they haven\'t? Regina was settled in 75. It 
was TL 10 in 1105. It was TL 11 or 12 in 1120, wasn\'t it? (I haven\'t the
books with me here and may be misremembering). Why did Regina gain one
or no TLs in 10 centuries and one more in 15 years? It dosen\'t make much
sense if you assume that TLs always increase or stagnate (barring wars).
It makes perfect sense if TLs rise and fall over the centuries.
Secondly, even if the Imperium _is_ stable there could be a very good
reason for that: Imperial control. The Sword Worlds have a political
machine, a commitee, to rule them. The Imperium has a single authority
who can shift things around to keep the economy more or less stable 
whoever it may hurt in the short run. The Confederation Council has to
take short term hurts into consideration.

Where did you get that definition? I mean, if you made it up yourself you\'re
begging the question. I admit that I\'m vague about just how a feudal
technocracy works, but isn\'t that because it\'s a term GDW made up (Or lifted
from some SF book?)? Or is there some dictionary definition of the term? 
Have there ever been a formal feudal technocracy in Real Life? 

>You get to be `king\' because you control the largest share of stock.

In a feudal society you get to be king because you have the support of the
great lords. In theory you gets that support because you own the land and
lend it to the great lords in return for their sworn support (In practice
the great lords often control the land whatever the King wants).

By analogy a feudal technocracy is one where the King theoretically owns
all the industry (the source of power analogous to land in a feudal
society) and lend it out in exchange for support. In practice many great
lords propably control their \'fiefs\' whatever the King wants.

What you are describing is a corporate government, not a feudal one. In a
feudal government power (in this case, ownership of shares) flows from the 
top to the bottom. What you describe is power flowing from the bottom (the 
individual shares) to the top.

After the 3FW the Imperium dealt with the Sword Worlds by invading them.
Later a different administration decided that the occupation was either
unnecessary ("They\'ll never dare do anything again, not in a thousand 
years"), or just too expensive, or both. The 4FW was settled by negotiations
and one proviso must certainly be that the Imperium did not retaliate
against the Sword Worlds. And after the 5FW they again dealt with the 
Sword Worlds, this time by setting up a puppet governmnt on half of them.
I just don\'t understand how you can say that they didn\'t deal with them.
They\'ve dealt with them at least twice.

Granted, but the only way you can get that influence is if the king of
Gram allows you to buy that controlling interest. Remember the \'feudal\'
in the government class. The king theoretically _owns_ those shares and
what you pay for must be the right to benefit from them. And one of the
things you must pay with is the promise to support him. So it\'s even
possible that King Harald will not allow you to invest in anything on
Gram.

Ulysses Stark grew up on Arizona Dawn in one of the more populous 
cities.  He enlisted in the NeoSol Confederation Marines at the age of 17 
and served as an autogunner, MP and various other duties.  In 1189 
Ulysses, along with a hand (platoon) of Marines were stranded on a 
frontier  planet due to an accident/oversight.  He and his team evaded 
hostile locals for 16 months before being befriended by one group of 
nomads.  The people there talked about something called "Helios?"  The 
lost platoon was rescued in late 1190 and returned home under relative 
secrecy but not before the friendly nomads had given to Ulysses the 
tattered remnants of some long dead archaeologists journal...the exact 
meaning of its observations still a mystery due to its fractured nature.  
He married the Nemon Rebel and fugitive Jana Biesecker on Arizona Dawn in 
1193 and retired from the marines in 1197 after 20 years of service.  He 
then became constable for a small district on Enope and raised riding 
animals.  When two junior constables were found shot to death in their 
ATV in a local wilderness area all fingers pointed to the strange loner 
who lived in the hills by the name of Solon Maghib.  Ulysses vowed to 
hunt the killer down and did so only to discover him held prisoner by the 
son of a local wealthy statesman.  When challenged the man Aaron Nessus 
fired at the Constable who shot him dead.  Constable Stark subsequently 
found life very difficult on Enope and eventually decided to leave, 
trying to find his fortunes working as a security consultant for some 
corporation or high port.  He still recieves a pension of about 900 Cr/month.

Not necessarily the case.  Naval forces may be forced to jump outsystem
(or at least vector out of orbit) after landing planetary units and before
they are able to retrieve them.  I\'d hate to be the planetary commander
who had to fight opposing orbital bombardment and aerospace forces with
only ground forces.  Similarly, I\'d hate to have to fight ballistic
missile submarines and orbital satellites with only AFVs or other grav
ground vehicles.

This is an important point that I think is very difficult for us TL 8
humans to understand.  Distinctions between ground, air and orbital
craft/vehicles will tend to disappear with the advent of contragravity.
I\'m not going to argue this from a design rules standpoint (I wouldn\'t
be able to anyway) but from a philosophical standpoint, at average
stellar tech levels there won\'t *be* clear distinctions between things
like AFVs and aerospacecraft.  To the extent that we still see such
distinctions I think we are merely falling victim to our experience that
has been limited to things like tanks and fighter planes.

Yes, but again we are limited by our own concepts of submarines.  The
wet navy material that appeared in *Challenge* was a great start in this
direction.  It showed things like submarines attacking orbital craft
and the like.

I think this acceptance of air, sea and land forces and the subsequent
focus on land forces (which goes all the way back to *Mercenary*) is
way too much 20th Century thinking and not enough 57th(?) Century
thinking.  The next time you think 20th Century experience is relevant
for Traveller planetary combat ask yourself how well a Prussian cavalry
officer might envision a carrier battle group hunting for attack
submarines.

In the Traveller-era I believe there will be two types of military
forces:  space forces (the Navy) and planetary (land/sea/air) forces
(the Army).  There may be some specialized forces like the Marines but
the only command division will be at the point where certain grav
vehicles/craft cannot escape planetary orbit.

The stuff that\'s appeared on ground forces is good as far as it goes but
I\'d like to see a combat force that was equipped to move through several
worlds in a subsector: a water world, a vacuum world, a `garden\' world,
and a desert world for starters.  I\'ll let all you folks with military
experience or inclination decide whether this needs to be a corps or
army or several armies with whatever associated space forces are 
necessary.  Each of these worlds has some sort of planetary and local
space forces but not more than your fleet of several squadrons ought
to be able to deal with if you have the right force composition.

I realize the Imperium doesn\'t need this sort of flexibility because it
can just lumber along and wait for the appropriate forces to be transported
to the respective worlds but the Imperium is gone.  What kind of forces
is the Regency going to use to chase that Vampire Fleet from behind the
Black Curtain back across Corridor, mopping up or `cleansing\' worlds
along the way?

How long does it take if I have contragravity?  :-)

*I\'m* certainly the last person to argue over rules (I generally throw
them *all* out) but I don\'t think it\'s this cut and dried.  The `1000
ships per sector\' and `50-200 ships per numbered [subsector] fleet\'
figures are from the *Rebellion Sourcebook*, a MegaTraveller reference.
It was these numbers that I used to estimate the Sword Worlds naval
forces at 42 ships.

The distinction seems to be more of `strategic\' focus (fleet compostion
and such per *5FW* and *RS*) versus `tactical\' focus (ship tonnages and
the like per *HG*, *TCS* and *TNE*).  I believe this is where the
actual inconsistencies are.

It was *JTAS* #10 (the `War!\' issue was #9).  The article only covers
*ground* (not aersopace or nautical) forces.  There are no corresponding
rules for SDBs or other space forces in *JTAS*.

This is fine with me.  So what do we do now?  What is the rationale for
accepting the *TCS* or other `tactical\' part of the canon *over* the *RS* or
other `strategic\' part of the canon?

Yes, more thinly populated "than the `average\' Imperial subsector".  This
inludes those heavily populated subsectors in the Imperial core.  Regina and
other subsectors in the Spinward Marches are also `frontiers\' - they\'re not
`average\' for the Imperium.

We\'ve already established this.  Again, what is the rationale for

What I\'m asking is why you choose to accept *TCS* data over *RS* data?

You\'re "mixing apples and orange".  Why would I choose to have a *TCS*-

Let\'s see what a little creative rationalization can do with this.  I 
postulate one or more fuel refining depots in orbit about the gas giant.
There are strictly controlled traffic corridors between the 100-diameter
jump point, the fuel depots and Regina itself.  85% percent of incoming
traffic and 100% of outgoing traffic passes through these corridors.  Of
course, some `unauthorized\' traffic might skirt these corridors but I\'m
not worried about protecting them from corsairs anyway.

I came up with this in about 30 seconds.  Give me a couple of weeks and
I\'ll make those 10 SDBs *invaluable*!  (As long as you don\'t restrict me
to *5FW* constraints while you use *TCS*.)

Again, these only covered *ground* forces.

Remember MegaTraveller?  The Imperium only fights for high population
worlds.  In *5FW*, high pop worlds have *hundreds* of SDBs that are able
to match the jump-mobile naval squadrons.  Furthermore, I believe that
*JTAS* said that the 10 Regina SDBs deployed in the gas giant\'s atmosphere
in order to `harrass\' opposing forces.  There was even a rule in the
game for declaring your SDBs `active\' or `passive\' or some such thing.

What do we have here?  The Cult of the Trillion Credit Squadron?  :-)
I\'m not trying to argue what *TCS* says.  What I want to know is *why* I
should ignore *5FW* and *RS* in favor of *HG* and *TCS*?

More Cult dogma?  The *Rebellion Sourcebook* clearly indicates that most
of Glisten subsector as well as portions of District 268 and Trin\'s Veil
subsector fell at one point to the *ihatei*.  Once again we see that the
`strategic\' viewpoint conflicts with a `tactical\' one.  How do we choose,
rationally, between the two?  Can we reconcile them at all?

Finally, I\'ve got a question for all you *TCS* cult members.  Is there any
clear way to identify ship types or classes based upon tonnages?  In other
words, is there some breakdown like:

Battles          100,000+
Cruisers         40,000 - 100,000
Destroyers       5000 - 40,000
Etc.?
(Please don\'t take issue with my numbers.  I don\'t have a clue what the
actual values out to be.)

What about types/classes themselves?  Is there some finer breakdown than
battles, cruisers, carriers, escorts, etc.?  Is there a way to tell a
frigate from a destroyer, etc. (besides what the designer choose to call it)?

The following library data first appeared in *Melbourne Times* #2:

Discovery Service: The exploration and missionary service of the Abrahamic
Synod.  The Discovery Service has primary responsibility for survey of new
systems as well as for contact with new cultures.  The Scouts of the Discovery
Service are renown throughout the Colonies Sphere for their scientific and
surveying skills.  The Discovery Service has also proven quite effective in
spreading the Abrahamic faith among the new peoples contacted.  It has shown
greater success in gaining new members for its State than has any other scout
service.  Primarily because of this record of success the Discovery Service has
been banned by most Colonial States from conducting operations on their
respective worlds.  Discovery Service teams are generally welcome on
independent worlds due to their extensive record of aid to developing worlds.

General Hulls and Drives: The largest corporation in the Commonwealth, General
is the largest manufacturer of starships in the Colonies Sphere.  General
builds all classes of starships from private yachts to naval battleships at
shipyards on both Commonwealth and independent worlds.  In addition to its
manufacturing operations, General is a major insurer in Commonwealth space. 
The company also has extensive holdings in the chemicals (primarily jump fuels)
and mineral processing industries.

ikrahanbe: Aeroi meditative state commonly used as a means of focusing
intellectual effort on a particular problem.  Often used during trade
negotiations, the technique involves the complete encirclement of the Aeroi by
its membranous wings in concert with a semi-conscious mental state.  The
process seldom lasts more than a few minutes.  After emerging from ikrahanbe,
Aeroi are usually able to present a proposal that is agreeable to all parties
concerned.  The technique is sometimes unsettling to non-Aeroi who confuse it
with some sort of psionic talent.  The Aeroi claim the process is strictly
internal to the practitioner and several independent examinations have failed
to detect any evidence of psionic activity.

Equipment Guide is now available for $20.00.  Is it worth it?  Yes, if you\'re
a user of FF&S.  The RCEG has a lot of good designs for all players and NPC\'s.
It covers equipment used by the RC, the Guild, and planets in the wilds.
 
Basically it is broken down into four types of equipment.  Equipment
(resporators, armor, drop capsules, etc), Weapons, Vehicles, and Spacecraft.
The equipment is further categorized by availability (RC, Relic, Guild, Wilds,
Hivers). 
 
Finally, there is a four page FF&S rules expansion in the back.  Modules and
Pods are added to spacecraft design.  Floatation screens to ground vehicle
design, Grav belts to lift vehicle design.  For Aircraft design, further notes
for compound helicopters are added as are aircraft modifications for other
planetary environments. (How to compromise your design so that it works in
Thin atmospheres as well as your native standard atmosphere).  
 
For small arms, Dual-feed receivers, Modular small arms, and overpowered
cartridges are dealt with.  For high-energy weapons, Rapid-fire High-energy
weapons are added, Plasma and fusion bazookas are added, and the question of
concussion and burst of high-energy weapons is answered.  In Munitions,
guidance and missile design is added.  Shotgun and Flechette rounds for
Grenade Launchers are added.  A New Rule is added for projectile weapons with
a penetration of Nil.  And in Misc. some details of Workstations and Labs, and
Hatches and Rates or Troop Egress are dealt with.

Whew!... A lot a rule for just four pages but if any of those area are things
that you are designing with FF&S then you will want RCEG.

All in all it is a good source of equipment for the busy GM.  There are even a
few adventure ideas for dealing with relic equipment buried in the
descriptions.

Other Impressions.  Lots of decent artwork.  Most equipment has a picture to
go with it.  Eight full color plates of the equipment in use.  

What I miss.  DECKPLANS!  One thing I loved about CT was the detail level of
standard starships.  That seemed to be farmed out with MT and is nonexistant
with TNE.  Maybe they will finally appear in the Personalities of the
Reformation Coalition supplement, but I won\'t hold my breath.

   I based my fighting-ship classifications on the spinal mount.
Battleships would have the largest SMs for their TL, cruisers the smallest,
and escorts/destroyers would only have bay and turret weapons.  Ships from
lower TLs tended to be larger than equivalent higher TL classes - my
philosophy was to wrap the smallest hull around the SM I could.  Finer
gradations were based on secondary weapons or performance (lots of
missiles, high accelleration, heavy armour, etc.).  Then there are
fighters, but I never could see a lot of use for them in space combat.

This all applies to MT; I haven\'t designed enough ships to get a feel for
TNE ships.

dispute over which version of Traveller reality we should use to visualize
fleet conditions in the Imperium.

I haven\'t got time for a detailed answer, but you have to start on the
basis of accepting that there is no way that 5FW can be reconciled with
TCS.  Once you get past that, the reason for not accepting 5FW as the
model is this:  The ship levels in 5FW are way too low for any reasonable
bottom up estimate based on population or economic activity.  

Take Glisten as an example: Glisten is inhabited (according to the Imperial
Encyclopedia data) by about 8 billion people.  If they were responsbile for
the maintenance of the entire "average subsector" fleet, neglecting any
contributions by the other worlds in the subsector, 42 ships with an
average crew of 1000 (probably a bit high remembering the mix of ships from
Supplement 9) would represent .0005% of the population.  Even with a
thousand support personnel for each crew member (I hope you will agree that
is an unthinkable level of bureaucracy!), that would still be less than
half a percent of the population.  If those 42 ships had an average displacment
of 50,000 tons, typical High Guard designs would give them a cost of about
50,000 MCr, which means that each of the 8 billion people would have con-
tributed about Cr260 to build them--over a ten year period (or more).  This
would work out to be an annual tax burden of 26/12000 for the average starship
steward, 2/10 of one percent, and less than that for a more highly skilled 
worker.  Retirees could easily pay it out of their pensions. (-:  If the
Imperium was seriously interested in defending itself, it would spend more
money.  Likewise, serious attackers could easily spend more than a fraction
of a percent of the annual wages of their populations, so the 5FW numbers
are not reasonable.

I agree with Steve Higginbotham, who said that 5FW was best viewed as a
"simplified" representation of the "real" world, since no one would want to
push 10,000 counters around.

A heavy weapon. I say if you\'re going to do it, go all the way and make it
a squad support weapon, with a belt feed and longer barrel.

20mm???? This is not a personal weapon! If anything, it would take the
modern grenade launcher\'s role.

Calling it a "heavy blaster" IMHO conjures up Han Solo dashing thorugh
Imperial corridors with a large energy handgun. THis thing is what squad
leaders use to bust a fortified position before rushing forward.

Sounds to me like a very unstable weapon, especially if it jams (I don\'t
have FF&S but the reality checking says: it may jam and blow up in your
face when the plasma just *has* to go).

>Don\'t ask me how it works.

Too bad. I\'m asking. The gun initiates the reaction. The fuse releases it.
What if the round cooks off prematurely? Where does the energy go? What if
nearby electromagnetic interference sets it off?

>It is in effect a ballistically

The round would have to include a little magnetic force-tunnel thingy to
project the plasma forward properly. Otherwise it would go splat and
vaporize everything around it, rather than focusing on the target.

This may be the range of a sidearm but this thing is more than a sidearm,
and doesn\'t come close to the range of a proper battlefield rifle.

That is not a rifle. That is a Very Heavy Machinefun or a Light Autocannon.

Or more appropriately, consider what a member of a Mesoptomanian militiaman
would make of the over-the-horizon high-speed death that characterizes so
much of warfare today. I refer you to GDW\'s Harpoon game and the satellite
scene from *Patriot Games*.

While I agree that there will be a consolidation of forces, there will
always be those vehicles that, when restricted to a single environment,
will still have a substantial edge over those that are not.  Take a grav
tank, for example. Yes, it can fly, but if the design only accounts for
low-level flight and not intercontinental transit, think of how much more
armor and payload it can carry without the extra thruster plates, fuel, or
whatever. Ther will always be room for specialization.

Analyse the economic strength of the 30 billion people in the Sword Worlds. 
Assign what you think is a reasonable sum of money per citizen for them to 
spend on their yearly naval budget (assume 1 credit hasthe buying power of
a US $). Now see how many naval vessels you can buy for that. Decide what
part of the initial purchase price it will cost to operate a ship. 1/20th?
1/10th? 1/5th? Whatever you decide, multiply the number of ships in the
fleet by the inverse number. Now match the figure you arrive at against 
the figure TCS gives you and against the 42 battleships _RS_ gives you.
Which is closest? By how many orders of magnitude?

If you accept the rationale that _5FW_ is a board game with other priorities
than _TCS_ then you certainly needen\'t. If you try to fit them all into a
coherent whole you need to address these discrepancies. GDW claims that 
BOTH_TCS_ and _5FW_ are based on the same reality. A few simple calculations 
show that that can\'t be true. Now what?

And you just the other day agreed with me that the only faintly reasonable
explanation for this is that the Imperials blundered massively and didn\'t
fight the ihatei with anything approaching an important Impy force. (And
even then I just can\'t accept the defeat of Tobia).

Both tactically and strategically the ihatei are in deep shit if they poke
their furry muzzles across the 4-5 parsec gap that seperates the spinward 
3/4th of Trojan Reaches from the coreward 1/4th.

I think you need to consider some more design issues, and some game balance
issues.

First, the PPC cartridge is going to be smaller than a conventional ETC round
from the same barrel.  This is because you will need a "container" to
direct the force of the plasma bolt that is bigger or thicker than a 
corresponding HEAP cartridge casing.  I still think it would be a nasty weapon
but this will help bring it down a notch.

Which leads handily to my next issue.  Cardinal rule: anything the NPCs get
the PC will get eventually.  Give *them* a compact weapon capable of defeating
battle dress (and light vehicle armor???) and your in trouble.  Make sure that 
there are some limiting factors; I would make the range very short ("due to
the extreme weight of the round"), the cost per round very high, and/or the
recoil very high.  A fully automatic version would be right out.

Ok so much for the voice of reason.  Now think about this; why have the bolt 
go off on impact?  seems to me you could do some serious area damage with the 
addition of a simple proximity fuse, or a timer fuse which causes the round to
go off at a set distance from the barrel.  It would act a bit like a plasma
shotgun; the round leaves the barrel at 400 m/s, at 20m it goes off-creating an
effect like there was a plasma-gunner standing there.  I would go for a more 
diffuse bolt which attacked a cone, use the rules for flechettes but with 
the "fragments" being hot plasma.  I wouldn\'t dare to guess a damage after
sermonizing above.

I am hardly a TLC cultist, but I do have an answer for that one: NO.

The current nomenclature game into being between the introduction of steam and
the turn of the century, and it was intended as a set of functional designations

Battleships were the "ships of force" able to stand up to other battleships.

Cruisers were light ships with long legs, able to serve as the "eyes" of a 
battle force, or take on extended patrolling for commerce raiding/protection
or force projection.

Destroyers were designed to destroy enemy torpedo boats -- that is, provide 
a defensive screen for the battle fleet.

There were a selection of minor types, but that was the core, and with the 
exception of a few new types (the Fleet and Escourt Carriers) it held through
WWII.  After that, everything went to hell in a handbasket.

Ship designations since the start of the cold war have had a lot to do with
the politics of defence appropriations and nothing to do with function (which
is why Destroyers now do extended patrols, Agis cruisers provide zone defence,
and Janes lists submarines first among a nation\'s naval assets.)

In Traveller, it is even madder - witness the Patrol, Mercenary, and Kinunir
"Cruisers" in the same universe with the "Azanti High Lightning".  In my HG
designs I always tried for the WWI functional designations -- but when I 
start FF&S design, I plan to stuff the whole mess for a new set of functional
designations that have some relation to real tactical employment.

The following NPC sketch first appeared in *Melbourne Times* #2.  Adelaide
Olowua ought to be adaptable to any campaign with minimal effort.

Personafile: Adelaide Olowua

Adelaide Olowua is a Human female of medium height.  Her features reflect a
strong African-branch influence and are considered attractive by most Humans. 
She keeps her black hair close-cropped.  Her athletic build is somewhat unusual
for one approaching late middle-age but not surprisingly so.

Adelaide usually dresses in close-fitting clothes - she claims they are merely
functional but is acutely aware of their ability to highlight her figure.

Of average strength and endurance, Adelaide is surprisingly agile.  She is
bright and has a great deal of experience from which to draw.  Her position as
a retired merchant captain has offset the negative social affect of being a
free trader.

Adelaide\'s interests tend to be simple: good food, good drink, good company. 
She enjoys a good story and appreciates good piloting.  She has little
tolerance for authority.  She enjoys playing grav-ball and the rhythm lute. 
She is quiet, but sociable.

Adelaide\'s allegiance lies with a small group of people: her ship mates, her
family and a few close friends.  She is generally devoted to these people and
will make major efforts to support them.  She withstands trauma well and is
very cool under fire.  She is a respected leader and can lead large groups with
success although she has not yet taken advantage of this ability.  Her own
respect for authority is minimal - a reaction to the restrictive conditions on
her native Nyanza.  Likewise, Adelaide is very tolerant of other viewpoints and
lifestyles.

Born June 21st, 2948, at New Lagos on Nyanza, Adelaide\'s travel documents still
show Nyanza as her home.  She has not had a permanent home for many years but
uses her mother\'s address.

Adelaide\'s father died shortly after she was born.  Her mother, Lily Olowua,
remarried when Adelaide was in her teens.  She has a younger half-brother.  She
herself has been involved with several men but has never been married and has
no children.

Adelaide\'s friends tend to be ship mates.  Her ship\'s navigator, the Dolphin
Bolivar Sprayswallower, is a veteran of the Nyanzan Navy, and has served with
her for five years.  Duncan Ishige, her ship\'s steward, is the son of a friend
from her days at the Academy.  The robot Archimedia, the ship\'s engineer, was
purchased by Adelaide over four years ago but has since been emancipated. 

Adelaide first met her closest friend, Refuin iks-Louan, over twenty years ago.
She has always had the utmost respect for the Aeroi\'s mercantile skills and
asked him to join her crew when she became a free trader.

Adelaide has made more than a few enemies, especially among customs officials
in the Ouroran Community.  She has always somehow managed to stay above the
letter of the law, if not the spirit, and thus has avoided any serious trouble
so far.

Service History: Adelaide attended the Victoria Lines Merchant Academy on
Nyanza, receiving her Merchant\'s Certificate with Honors in 2970.  In addition
to extensive flight training she studied Victoria Lines\' administrative
procedures.  Upon graduation she chose service in the Deck Department and was
commissioned as a Fourth Officer.

During her first term Adelaide spent much time dirtside, including a stint at
Victoria Lines Deck Department School.  In addition to the computer and gunnery
skills she learned at the School she did a lot of brawling and carousing in
startown establishments.

Adelaide successfully completed the promotion exam to Third Officer in her
second term.  Many of her assignments were route service in frontier regions
where she spent much of her time performing EVA during orbital operations.

Adelaide\'s third term was spent at a variety of dirtside posts.  She spent some
time as a vehicle driver and was involved in more than a few fire fights with
smugglers.  She also managed to complete the promotion exam to Second Officer.

Adelaide completed the promotion exam to First Officer early in her fourth term
and was subsequently assigned to Command School.  She was taught standard
merchant legal practices and had an opportunity to learn Victoria Lines ship
tactics.  In her off-hours, she continued to spend her time in the less
reputable areas of startown.  After Command School she was assigned as a pilot.

Command School had been a good move - Adelaide made Captain in her fifth term. 
Now the one responsible for the trade mission, she proved to be a capable
leader.  She also learned some of the more \'underhanded\' aspects of merchant
operations.

Adelaide continued to prosper in her sixth term and grew comfortable with the
unpredictable nature of merchant operations.  She also became familiar with the
economic aspects of the business.

Ultimately, Adelaide began to chafe under the strictures of the Lines and
decided to muster out in 2994.  In addition to financial and material benefits
she received possession of her Far Trader Rampart Parabola.  She began the life
of a free trader.

Recent Activities: Adelaide has been plying the space lanes as a free trader
for over six years.  She has managed to maintain a fair profit margin but not
without resorting to more than a few illegal activities.  While she does not
consider herself to be smuggler - she calls it profiteering - many customs
officials would disagree.

As Nyanzan free traders go, Adelaide is something of a shining star.  She has
never resorted to outright piracy and would not do so given the opportunity. 
She considers avoiding duties and regulations to be a matter of course.  Taking
from others is another matter entirely.

The Rampart Parabola has encountered more than a few pirates itself over the
last few years.  Adelaide has been ruthless in these encounters and has so far
avoided any major losses.  In fact, she and her crew have developed something
of a reputation among the pirates of Nyanzan space.

Adelaide is well known for her honest dealings (with brokers and traders) and
is often highly sought after by those who have a cargo that they want shipped
while avoiding any \'official\' entanglements.

         Hi guys - 
              All this talk about naval forces etc set me thinking, so I
         decided to do an analysis of the class A starports in the Domain
         ca 1120.  The original list had some 95 starports, which I broke
         down by tech level.  This gave me the following info:

         TL     No of Stpts    Total Cap    %Cap
         G         1           12.0 MTons    %8
         F         9           47.5         %31
         E        11            3.5          %3
         D        10           26.5         %17
         C        14           31.0         %20 
         B        22           25.0         %16
         A        12            8.0          %5
         9        11             .004        <%.01
         8         4             .3          <%.5

         Total Cap=Total Shipbuilding capacity in millions of displacement
         tonnes, per the TCS guidelines (peacetime)

         %Cap=Percentage of total capacity for this category (may not =100
         due to rounding)


         In other words, the majority of the class A starports are TL12 or
         less (%64), but the bulk of the shipbuilding capacity is at TL13
         or greater (%59).  In fact, over 1/3 of the shipbuilding capacity
         of the Domain is TL15 or above!  I don\'t know about anyone else,
         but this suprised me - it hardly jiibes with the "rude frontier"
         image that people sometimes have about the Domain.  It does
         however explain how the Domain could survive at a high tech level:
         it actually has a strong, high tech industrial base.

         I did some more analysis of these worlds, sorting out those worlds
         that have significant shipbuilding capacity (1 million tons +) to
         get the following list:

         Capacity=Total Shipbuilding capacity in millions of displacement
         tonnes, per the TCS guidelines (peacetime)
         %Total=Percentage of total capacity for this category (may not
         =100 due to rounding)
         Min=Minor Combatants (ca 1000tons)
         Maj=Major Combatants (ca 50000tons)


         These figures are taken from the TCS budget info posted by Ken
         Hagler, with the total atarport capacity figured as follows %25
         devoted to minor combatants (avg 1000 T), 25% major combatants
         (avg 50000 T), and %50 allocated to civil ship construction.

         This gives an annual construction rate of almost 750 major ships/
         year, with nearly 60 million tons at TL15+.  This translates into
         300 major combatants *PER YEAR*..

         What this seems to imply is that the MT figure of 1000 ships per
         sector is a limit imposed by Imperial Policy, not by the
         limitations on planetary economies.   The actual number of ships
         would be determined by a number of factors:  

         1.   Basic nature of the interstellar government (i.e.,
         militaristic alla The Sword Worlds, or pacfistic, or somewhere in
         between).
         2.   The budget of the interstellar government for maintenance.
         As a quick rule of thumb, I would allow 1/2 of the TCS budget for
         the planet to be used for maintenance, the rest going to upgrading
         and new ships.
         3.   The current political situation - a government at war, or on
         the brink of war, would allocate more resources to weapon
         building.
         4.   Other more pressing uses for shipbuilding capacity,
         (exploration services such as the Zho Core expeditions, patrol
         services such as the Quarentine, orcommercial use)
         5.   The useful life of a starship - the longer they last the
         easier it is to maintain a larger fleet.

              I think this may shed some light on the continuing discussion
         about the Sword Worlds.  The Sword Worlds will have to spend a
         fairly large portion of their planetary budgets on the maintenance
         of their fleets, and will thus be operating on a sort of "cold
         war" budget (sound familiar?).  This might be the mechanism behind
         the proposed "boom-bust" cycles.  The converse would be true for
         the Imperium (and Domain).  A much smaller portion of the whole
         economy would be devoted to military ends, and a larger portion
         would be available for development purposes, both public and
         private.  This would keep the econonmic development on a more even
         keel, and could be the reason that the "boom-bust" is not seen in
         the Imperium.  With it\'s isolation and the burden of maintaining
         the Quarentine, the Regency might start to experiance the same
         kind of effect.  Perhaps this is the "overheating" mentioned in
         TNE.

         As for using the PoT formulae (which I like conceptually), the
         figures that were posted last week were wrong...the thing that was
         missed was the population multiplier.  On a Pop 8 world, the
         multiplier is .2, at Pop 9 it is .03, and at Pop A it is .004!  In
         other words, a world whose population is an order of magnitude
         higher than another will not necessarily have a corrispondingly
         large space force.  In practice, this gives worlds like Efate,
         with a Pop of 9, a fleet of major combattants in the teens (I
         don\'t have the figures in front of me now, sorry)
         I think the PoT figures work great for the Wilds, where there
         shouldn\'t be too many worlds with huge relic fleets (otherwise
         what makes the RC any better?)  I bet you could modify the
         formulae pretty easily, but I prefer to leave the ref room to make
         some decisions about absolute fleet sizes, while having guidlines
         of the maximum possible numbers of ship.

         Ok...so there\'s my two centicredits worth...

The _Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide_ has hit the stores.

Quick comments and first impressions:

* The art in TNE is really beginning to irritate me.  Nearly every
  page has some space wasted with the rococo and worthless TNE
  pseudo-computer borders.  There\'s a @#$*#$& POWER SWITCH at the
  top of a lot of the pages, and I just wish it were functional so
  I could turn off the damn art.

  There\'s also an 8 page color spread in the middle with the, IMHO,
  mediocre to bad drawings of RCES going about their "duties", as
  so often seen in Challenge.  IMHO, a waste of four-color ink.
  A better choice would have been something like the color vehicle
  paint drawings in the T:2000 vehicle supplements, which were far
  superior in artistic merit and were useful and relevant to the
  supplement, and often enlightening in themselves.

  Some of the equipment drawings are useful.  A bright spot in the
  book\'s art design are the drawings of two TL14 Ithkluri weapons.
  The Hiver ships shown look like shoeboxes.  I\'m trying to forgive
  in the interest of promoting alien psychology in ship design,
  but the picture of the Hiver Utility Vehicle landed on a moon
  looks very unrealistically bad.  I can deal with boxes in the
  vaccuum of space, but where\'s the landing legs?  The Schalli
  battle-dress looks like it escaped from _Battletech_.  Stats
  for an _Aliens_ style cargo handler are given on a battle
  dress page, but it\'s easy to miss because there\'s no art for
  it, and it\'s in a corner.  Shame, shame -- major art and 
  marketing oversight, IMHO, here.  (How do I know?  One of the
  color plates shows an odd variant of it.)

* The subtle and not so subtle Imperium-bashing can get a bit
  heavy for old-timers who remember what it was like even at
  it\'s worst.  I get the impression that the RC thinks that
  it is desigining equipment that was overlooked by the fallen
  civilization (the Imperial idiots!).  I may be reading more
  into this than is really deliberately there.

* Some new FFS rules are introduced.  The RC seems to be somewhat
  confused about the difference between a grav belt and a G-tube
  or grav bike.  Also, grav belt propulsion by ducted propellor
  somehow bothers me -- I liked the grav belt on the cover of the
  MT _Imperial Encyclopedia_.  There is no such thing as a "two
  man grav belt" -- that thing is a bedframe grav bike.  Some
  interesting musings on how gravitic fields work, and what
  happens when you stick a weapon or your arm outside the grav
  belt\'s field.

* Every time they say that independents have trouble getting RC
  body sleeves, I ask, "Why would they want one?"  I miss the 
  IISS TL15 uniform vacc suits, which made the IISS look more
  like professionals, IMHO, and less like superheros in their
  long-johns.  There\'s a very comic book feel to TNE in the RC,
  and if I wanted to play in the comic books, I\'d play _V&V_ or
  _Champions_ or the like.  I don\'t.  This goes back to art.
  Ditto for the battle dress -- especially the light model that
  looks like the poor fool is wearing a corset.  Now Imperial,
  Solomani, or Zhodani battle dress from MT and previous -- 
  those are much more interesting. 

* The info included seems more useful.  There are some equipment
  designs, a lot of weapon designs with associated rounds and
  magazines, and a fair number of vehicle and starship designs.
  Modules for the _Auroras_ are included.  A TNE _Trepida_ is
  included, designated by the RC as _Intrepid_ (they thought
  the Imperial designation was inappropriate.)  The companion
  _Astrin_ APC is not included, nor the ballistic vehicle 
  re-entry system the IMC used, which seems like it would be
  a good candidate for inclusion, considering the uses intended
  for this supplement.  (Admittedly, we haven\'t seen that system
  spelled out in stats yet in the game.)  A MT-era Solomani design
  for a "grav tank" called the _Chariot_ is included, here called
  the _Pyrrhus_ since it isn\'t really a MBT grav tank, and if
  used like one....  The art used for it is familiar, but I
  don\'t know if the _Chariot_ was in DGP\'s _101 Vehicles_, or
  if they\'re just reusing the picture for, say, the Gram grav
  tank.

  Also, comments in the text indicate that the Hive Federation
  is able to equip its\' Ithkluri Marines at TL 14 already, and
  that they are *exporting* TL 13 parts to the RC.  DGP stated
  that the Federation was at TL 15/16 before the Rebellion
  (marginally superior to the Imperium), and since the only
  damage they suffered was due to the Collapse itself, I suspect
  the Federation is well on its\' way to becoming the pre-eminent
  technological and trading power in Charted Space.

Summary.  I\'m still a bit unsettled about this one.  If I get it,
it will only be to strip out the useful stuff and chuck the bizarre.
I\'ve never seen a book so putatively realistic that gave me such
a sense of unreality.  Your milage may vary -- I\'d like to hear
other people\'s opinions, especially the newer players.

 ::>a little too tongue-in-cheek? :-)  Can anyone post a RICE paper?

 Sure.  I was thinking that consistency of textual material would 
 be a Good Thing, but since these things _are_ done by different 
 field reporters, they would actually reflect the different styles.  
 The only thing that I would suggest is that the XUWP be kept in 
 the standard format as presented in RICE Paper #0000, modified as 
 discussed below, and that no lettered RICE Paper be published 
 until the numbered RICE Paper that it is associated with has been 
 published.  Also, since under this scheme there is a possibility 
 that multiple RICE Papers may get published simultaneously, I 
 would recommend NOT assigning a number, but instead using the TML 
 number of the message that contains the RICE Paper.  Of course, if 
 a lettered Paper is being published, _that_ one gets an assigned

 Also, RICE was just a fortuitous acronym.  I almost changed it 
 when I saw what it led to, but decided that I liked it...  The DCE

 Absolutely, good thought.  I\'ll add that in RICE Paper #0001 (or 
 whatever number it turns out to be, per the revised method of 
 numbering ).  As it stands, Spinward Marches except Regina 
 Subsector is per Imperial Chamber of Commerce issues as of 1116 or 
 thereabouts (Megatraveller Imperial Encyclopedia); Regina 
 Subsector is per Regency Board of Economic Development issues as 
 of about 1200 (Traveller: The New Era).  I know I have Deneb 
 Sector somewhere, and I think it\'s of the 1116 issue, but I\'m not 
 sure.  If someone has "accurate" info, contact me off the list so 
 that we can arrange appropriate information transfer...

Hmm. Perhaps ideally... :-) It might be fairer to note that the \'elected\' 
representatives only get where they are by lying, back-handers, use of the 
media to portray them as \'nice people\', etc. [allegedly]. They rarely think 
for themselves, preferring to tow the \'party line\'. In the case of a certain 
current European government within a few miles of myself, the strings are, 
in reality, pulled totally by the owners of production, who ensure the 
politicians vote as they desire in order that they can maintain their high 
profits and so that the politicians can become directors when they retire 
from politics. Perhaps not so different from a feudal technocracy? :-) or 
should it be :-( ?

THE SWORD WORLDS \'DEBATE\'
A lot of the problem seems to be over someone having TL11 and not having as 
good starships as a TL12 world, etc. Given the World Builder\'s Handbook, for 
TL11, maximum TL for a particular facet (power, ships, domestic, etc.) is 11 
+ (11/5) = 13. So in theory the world might be rated TL11 but actually still 
retain (or have built up to) TL12 or TL13 in their starship production. This 
might well be the case if the world was particularly worried about being 
able to defend itself from attack. Perhaps the TL12 ship production is 
military only, so all other ships (traders, etc.) are only TL11. Perhaps the 
domestic economy (if you play TL as a reflection of economy) has suffered to 
make up for this input into the military such that the populace only has TL9 
or worse facilities. Just some thoughts...

WHY DOESN\'T EVERYONE HAVE THE BOMB?
New Scientist once carried an article describing how to make a nuclear bomb 
in your own home. It did point out that you\'d die of radiation poisoning but 
that if the exercise was being carried out by a terrorist this might not 
matter. Given the theory that plutonium is available by cash or manufacture, 
how does one get it? Obvious answer is to go and TAKE it. That\'s what 
terrorists could do. If your own country isn\'t suitable, pop across to a 
nearby dissolving multi-state ex iron-curtain country, tip some guards a few 
credits and walk off with a preprepared warhead. Hell, take the whole 
missile. :-)

To apply this to a wider range of products, even should your own world be 
TL11 and unable to supply TL12 replacements for your bought-in TL12 
thingummy-jigs, there\'s no reason why you shouldn\'t buy, steal or smuggle 
such from other worlds. If it\'s important enough then I would assume a 
government would be quite willing to go many jumps and deal with less than 
scrupulous worlds in order to obtain what they want. You only have to look 
at today\'s arms trade.

    Yep.  Blame GDW...  they could have modeled Classic Traveller on 
Star Wars, or Star Trek, both of which show signs of thinking 
"futuristic", but instead went with "1970s with Starships"...

    He would quite rightly suggest that it was the province of the 
Navy, not the cavalry, to envision such things...  

    If you think the modern or future world has nothing to learn from 
the military geniuses of the past, why is Sun Tzu\'s "Art of War" 
required reading for U.S.  Marine officers?  (I have read Sun Tzu; 
much of his commentary is timeless.)

>This is fine with me.  So what do we do now?  What is the rationale for
>accepting the *TCS* or other `tactical\' part of the canon *over* the *RS* or
>other `strategic\' part of the canon?

    A) personal preference.
    B) TCS is based on world economies directly; given X people at 
Techno-Economic Level Y, you get X*Y*C credits to play with.  Make up 
and apply a good thumb-rule for translating credits to number of hulls 
at Z tons each, based on known prices of ships as listed in the rules.  
Poof, you have a number of ships per region (sub-sector, sector, 
square foobars) that is consistant with the rest of the rules (i.e., 
makes sense).  The Rebellion Sourcebook stuff seems to be a lot of 
"we\'ll pull an even number out of thin air and write it down...".  

    On the other hand, for poltical reasons, the Imperium may be 
building a lot fewer ships than it is capable of...  (a) most of its 
yard production may be in mercantile shipping (the "phantom" bulk 
haulers once discussed on the TML), (b) member worlds may be 
exploiting the advantage of being in a large Imperium:  an Imperium 
needs fewer ships to defend its borders than the sum of the ships each 
member world would need to defend itself.  Therefore, member worlds 
need spend much less tax money and build fewer non-producer
(military) vessels than an independent world would.  Note that both
arguments assume that both TCS & RS numbers are valid in the same
universe.
    The objection to this argument is that if argument (b) is true, 
the Imperial economy should be booming...  so why do we have so many 
worlds with the Techno-economic levels of banana republics?  And, the 
numbers given in 5FW and RS sources are *TOO* low to defend the 
borders of the Imperium, even with the size advantage -- not when one 
independent world can produce a big enough fleet to seriously threaten 
the entire Spinward Marches, IF the Spinward Marches fleets are as 
small as suggested in RS.  

    You could also argue that *only* 5FW & RS numbers are valid; I 
simply cannot stomach that.  When GWP (Gross World Product) CAN be 
estimated based on listed population and required standards-of-living 
from the MegaTraveller rules, and ship construction costs are known 
from the same rules (likewise, both facts can be ascertained in CT 
rules), IT MAKES NO SENSE for worlds to build a tiny fraction of the 
Navy they are capable of building, especially when their "lives, 
fortunes and sacred honor" are threatened by (pick one) Imperial 
conquest, Zho conquest, Sword World raiders, Vargr raiders, Solomani 
conquest, K\'kree militant vegetarianism, etc, etc, etc.

>You know someone with 10,000 years of space combat experience?  :-)

    You\'re being silly.  I can go to my bookcase and pull out two 
military works by generals dead over 2000 years, both from Empires 
that have undergone worse "Dark Ages" and worse Tech Level losses than 
space-faring humanity ever did in Traveller...  The Vilani have been 
spacefaring for 10,000 years, and fighting other spacefarers for a 
signficant fraction of that.  Add in Aslan military history (2000 
years), Terran military history (3000+ years), Zhodani, Vargr, and 
K\'kree military history (several more thousands of years), and you 
have one hell of a huge body of "Theory and Practice of Interstellar 
Warfare".  

    I quote you:  "way too much 20th Century thinking and not enough 
57th(?)  Century thinking."  You are forgetting the sheer weight of 37 
centuries... for Terran humanity alone.  How much have we (Real World)
learned about the Art of War in 3700 years?  A lot.  How much have we 
forgotten?  None.  In a Dark Age, the Art and Technology of War is the
one thing that advances, rather than declining...

    You\'ve seen Hans\' opinions about the Ihatei doing anything in 
Glisten or Trin\'s Veil...  his opinion is similar to ours.  To be 
kind, most of GDW\'s Rebellion-era material is not the highest quality 
they\'ve ever produced.  Also, don\'t 5FW counters (including the SDBs) 
represent Squadrons and Fleets, rather than individual ships?

    Yes. Tonnages are approximate, based on classes from Supplement 9,
and from memory.  Classes are usually based on size and intended use.

Primary function: slug it out with other large ships; has
spinal mount; jump capable; aka "Capital ships".

100,000+ tons           - Battleship
70,000 - 100,000t       - Heavy Cruiser, Battlecruiser
40,000 - 60,000t        - Cruiser
20,000 - 40,000t        - Light Cruiser, Cruiser

Primary function: as above, not jump capable.

over 5,000t             - Rider, BattleRider

Primary function: carry small combatants (fighters, SDBs)

any size            - Carrier
add armor           - Armored Carrier
add spinal mount    - Strike Carrier

Primary function: carry large combatants (Riders)

any size            - Tender
add armor, weapons  - Battletender (?)

Primary function: escort capital ships and carriers, engage SDBs, 
light riders, badly-designed fighters and mop up damaged capital 
ships.

1000-3000 tons      - Escort, Light Escort
3000-10,000 tons    - Destroyer, Destroyer Escorts
10,000-20,000 tons  - rarely seen for some reason. (Frigate ?)


Primary function: commerce raiding, anti-piracy patrols, customs 
cutters.

300-1000 tons       - Close Escort, Patrol Escort("Patrol Cruiser")
1000-3000 tons      - Escorts as above, on independent or convoy duty.


Primary function: engage similar combatants or cruisers, travel in 
large battle groups of same type. (My own designation, based on an 
extra-Imperial nation with non-standard doctrine).

3000-20,000 tons    - Corvette or Frigate

Primary function: small non-jump combatants, delivered in swarms to 
battlezone, or used for commerce raiding.

50-200 tons         - heavy fighter, small SDB. If well-designed, can
                    disable capital ships if in large numbers.
20-50 tons          - fighter.  Commerce raider.  Cannon fodder.
6-20 tons           - light fighter, interface fighter. Cannon fodder.

>    Is there a way to tell a frigate from a destroyer, etc. 
>(besides what the designer choose to call it)?

    Beats the hell out of me.  Depends if you are using classic 
European usage or modern American usage for the term "frigate".  The 
former means a large ship, not quite as big as a "ship of the line".  
(the USS Constitution was a frigate) Modern equivalent would be heavy 
cruiser or cruiser.  The latter usage means a small escort, smaller 
than a destroyer with slightly different duties.  
    American frigates were formerly called "Destroyer Escorts".  The 
purpose of the Destroyer is clearer if you remember that the name is 
short for "Submarine Destroyer".  As a carrier group or battlegroup 
escort, the destroyer\'s job is anti-submarine warfare; the frigate\'s 
job is manning the radar pickets (listening for enemy aircraft, ships 
or missiles in coming) out there at the edges of the fleet.  Ideally, 
the frigate is between the Carrier (or Battleship) and its 
accompanying cruisers and the enemy, and will "see" (and handle 
fire-control against) the enemy before the enemy can "see" the core of 
the Carrier Group.  Or something like that.  
    And I have no idea what a Traveller Frigate would be good for 
(spatial equivalent?)  In any case, the type names are chosen by the 
military based on intended use, not by the designer.  The U.S. Navy 
has changed the type names of several ships during their lifespans, as
they were refitted and given different duties.

    Necessarily.  If you don\'t have orbital control, your guys won\'t ever

while an enemy fleet existed insystem).

    Probably just as long.  Civilians don\'t have a good appreciation of
just how much STUFF an Army needs to move to function.  It\'s not just
tanks and APCs and howitzers and men.  The tanks and APCs and howitzers
amount to only a small part of any military force larger than a company.

    Yes.  Even if it had 40 1,000,000T battleships.  This, like all
military issues, is a TL issue.  TL dominates tactics in Trav, it
dominates operations, it dominates strategy.  It even dominates
logistics...
    If you ignore TL, then EVERYTHING you say about the military situation
in Trav is meaningless drivel...

> What I\'m asking is why you choose to accept *TCS* data over *RS* data?

    Because RS is inconsistent with the reality presented in other places.
For instance, the ability to fight an interstellar war WITHOUT resorting
to sterilization of worlds is a function of military strength.  With a
small number of ships, it becomes impossible to move large enough units
to the target area.  And if you can\'t take the world, you either leave it
alone (and if it is safe to leave it alone, then there was no point in
coming here in the first place), or you sterilize it.
    Yet Trav REPEATEDLY described successful invasions of worlds.  Several
in the FFW, more in the Rebellion.  WHERE DID THE SHIPS COME FROM?
Supposedly, the total amount of shipping available to the Imperium was
declining steadily during the Rebellion, yet they were coming up with
invasion forces right up to the point when the fighting ground to a halt.
    If Dulinor had had 2000 ships at the start of the Rebellion, where did
he get the resources to conquer whole subsectors?  Certainly, 2000 ships
weren\'t it.  Unless EVERY one of the 2000 ships could move an entire
division of high-tech troops, which they couldn\'t (The Tigress is the only
Impy ship ever described that could move a division, though mention of
assault transports was made)...

    No, I\'m describing a SINGLE SHIP.  Designed using HG, which was the
system used to design that SDB.  You are assuming that a ship designed
under High Guard is somehow different than another ship designed using
High Guard just because the one ship was designed for a TCS game, and
the other was designed as a bit of local color for the Traveller game?

    Let\'s use a calculator instead.  Regina\'s 100 diameter limit is about
12,000,000Km.  One incoming corridor, one outgoing corridor means 24 giga-
meters to patrol with your 10 ships.  Which means each ship has at least
2,400,000Km to patrol (assuming the ships are NEVER down for maintenance
and things like that).  Weapon range of 300,000Km means you have to run
900,000Km to get within weapon range of a pirate attacking someone as far
from you as he is likely to get.  Which means that you take about an hour
and a half to get within firing range of the pirate if you had your hands
on the controls just waiting for this to happen.  If the pirate is at all
competent, he can blow up his target in half an hour, and be gone well
beyond your sensor range before you get there.  If, on the other hand, he
is stupid enough to be trying to capture the ship, he\'ll have done that
in an hour, and you\'ll find yourself with a velocity differential of
about 330Km/s relative to him (he won\'t be in weapon range, because he\'ll
have run AWAY from your line of flight for that very purpose).  If he\'s
pulling 4G, and you 6G, you\'ll catch him in about 4.5 hours, which is
about two hours longer than it\'ll take him to reach the jump limit if
he\'s smart.  And if he\'s stupid enough to not jump before you reach him,
then you have to figure out how to beat him up before you overshoot
him (about an hour at your current relative velocities), WITHOUT killing
the innocent civilians on the captured ship.  Of course, to complicate
your planning on beating him up, you have to keep in mind that he is
twice as big as you are, and twice as well armed, and your nearest friend
is around 3,000,000Km away still.  And if he is smart, then he has a very
good friend running amok through your shippin lanes while you are off
chasing him...:-)
    As most of the old TMLers can tell you, I think piracy will never work
in Trav.  But the situation you described is about as close to paradise
for a pirate as I can imagine in Trav - lots of traffic in a small area (thus
saving you the trouble of FINDING targets), defenders spread out all over
that traffic lane (thus letting you know where they are so you can avoid
them).

    I\'m not restricting you to ANY constraints.  I am using HG to design
pirates, you are using HG to design SDBs (the one in question is the
standard SDB from the Trav game (and Mt, and TNE, in different
incarnations).  It has NOTHING to do with FFW.  FFW just provided the
background for GDW to describe the SDB.  And if you\'d like to design a
BETTER SDB (using HG, or any other rules set) feel free.  It won\'t make
a difference, any more than it would make a difference whether the US Navy
used ten PT boats or ten Iowa class BBs to patrol the US coastline.  The
problem isn\'t the capability of the patrol ship, the problem is the
NUMBER of the patrol ships.  Keep in mind that your ten ships can only be
TEN places at once...

    If the Imperium only fights for high pop worlds, how did they grab
the Border Worlds from the SW?  Only one High Pop world there, so they
shouldn\'t have touched any of the SW except Sacnoth...
    As to "*hundreds* of SDBs", that is irrelevant to the utility of
the SDBs that Regina supposedly sent to the GG.  You have to assume that
the Commander of the Regina System Defenses knew what he was about.  So
he obviously expected to accomplish something by deploying ten 400T SDBs
to Regina\'s GG.  But WHAT?
    As to "harassing", what harassment could those offer to a battleship?
Or even a Fleet Escort?  I think if you drag HG out, you\'ll find that
any combatant larger than a DE can deal with any possible action by ten
of those generic SDBs without breaking a sweat.  In fact, I venture to
suggest that ONE (1) Impy Sylea class fighter could deal with anything
those ten SDBs could do to harass anything...
    And "active" meant that your SDBs did something (mostly died), while
"passive" meant they did nothing (and therefore lived, but accomplished
nothing while doing so).

    No.  We have people who like to do EXPERIMENTS!  Try it some time.
Pick out a rules set you like.  Design ships.  Design a Doctrine for
using the ships.  Deploy the ships IAW your Doctrine.  Then let some-
one ELSE design ships, and a Doctrine, and let him put his Doctrine and
ships up against YOUR Doctrine and ships.  DON\'T take GDW\'s word for
waht works.  Or mine.  And don\'t GUESS!  Get off your lazy behind and
FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!
    As to the question of strategy and tactics and operations, if your
Doctrine doesn\'t cover ALL of them, it won\'t be worthwhile for anything
other than defending a system that YOU are in (you can\'t give tactical
orders to a froce that is three weeks travel away from you...).
    In my TCS game (which was more a strategic game than a tactical game,
and more an operational game than either one), TACTICS didn\'t actually
mean very much.  All the players could do is decribe BROADLY what
tactics their fleets should use (what "the Book"said).  The normal
decisions they made were operational and strategic (how should we spend
our money to advance our goals?  Where should we deploy ships to?  How
many should we deploy there?)
    As to why you should ignore FFW and RS, consider:
    1)  Built into FFW and RS is GDW\'s picture of "tactics" and "ship
design" and "logistics" and everything else.  Which means that
accepting their picture of the Impy Navy requires that you accept
their picture of how a battle is fought.  (Remember those SDBs which
are actively defending the GG?  Or passively hiding there?  Well,
they don\'t accomplish much UNLESS I go to the Gas giant!  FFW assumes
that a Fleet MUST go to the gas giant (and that there is only ONE gas
giant)  So the function of those pieces in that game assume a certain
tactics used by all sides.  Which is all well and good IFF those tactics
are the BEST tactics possible given the TECHNOLOGY!  They aren\'t.  In
three TCS games I\'ve run, I saw only three attacks that used the gas
giants the way GDW said they were used.  All three failed.  I saw only
ONE attempt to defend at the gas giants the way GDW said they should be
defended.  It was the most disastrous defeat for the defending Navy I
have EVER seen.
    Note that the three attacks using GGs the way GDW said they were used
were all involving UNDEFENDED gas giants.
    2)  Neither of those games deals effectively with ANYTHING but the
Impy forces in general, and the non-Impy forces in the Spinward Marches.
This ignores too much of the Trav Universe, and requires that you
assume that the K\'Kree, the Hivers, the Solomani, the Aslan, and the
countless Vargr states ALL FIGHT THE SAME WAY!  This is incredibly
stupid, UNLESS the "SAME WAY" is the BEST way to fight.  I have seen
too much HG combat to believe that "defend the gas giant, fight them
as they come from the GG to the main world, defend the main world" is
the BEST way to do anything.  I have also seen too much to believe that
"attack the GG to refuel, move to the main world while beating up their
fleet, attack the main world" is the best way to attack anything...
    3)  And finally, neither of these sources is "strategic", which is
the only thing you claim for them that TCS isn\'t also.  Both are only
vaguely related to any military factor other than number of
ships/men/tanks, etc.  Which any student of the military can tell you
is pretty insignificant compared to other concerns...

    You assume that GDW did more than arbitrarily decide the fate of the
Ihatei and GListen, eh?
    You seem unaware that strategy grows out of tactics/logistics/operations
and that tactics grow out of strategy/operations/logistics.  If you can move
your army 30 miles in one day, your "strategy" cannot call for the capture of
an enemy position 300 miles from your nearest forces three days from now.
Because if your strategy DOES call for such, then you\'ll have to change
strategies in three days when your men fail to accomplish the objective you
have set for them.  And if your strategy requires that worlds be taken
intact, then they cannot be bombarded with nukes and dinosaur killers.
    If the Operational Simulation produces different battle results than
the tactical simulation, then the operational simulation is a bad simulation.
Once your operational simulation produces results consistent with playing
out under a tactical suimulation, then you can proceed to determining
whether the strategic elements decribed in RS are actually relevant to your
operational goals.  If they are not, then clearly the strategic elements so
described are not a good model of the reality you purport to describe.

    Alternately, you can ASSUME that the strategic concerns described are
correct, and assign operational/tactical concerns consistent with that.
    BUT< if you do, then you should be aware that you have then made an
assumption comparable to the French assumption in 1940 that the Germans
could not get through the Ardennes in less than ten days, and certainly
could be stopped at the Meuse River by the forces present along that
frontier.
    Ultimately, ALL strategy/operations/tactics are a function of what
ONE man(army)/ship(navy) can accomplish with the weapons available to
him/it.  So you have to know what a man/ship can accomplish before you
can make any realistic analysis of what your Army/Navy can accomplish.
    And you can\'t determine what one man/ship can do by looking at
a strategic primer.

> Etc.?

    Well, for all you RS/FFW Cult members, no, there is not.  Labels in Trav
are largely arbitrary, based on the assumption that spaceships in the far
future are similar to modern Naval vessels.  They aren\'t.  Not even close.
Which is why so many people who play the game misuse their fighters (which
are NOT analogs of modern fighters, but rather of modern PT boats).
    However, that being said, GDW seems to use the following:

    Battleship = 200,000T+
    Heavy cruiser = 75,000-100,000T
    Light Cruiser = 30,000-50,000T
    Escort = 5,000-10,000T
    Destroyer = 2000-3000T
    Destroyer Escort = 100-1000T
    Fighter = 100T-.

    Note that in my experience, ships as small as 30,000T have been described
as
battleships, and ships as large as 100,000T have been described as light
cruisers,
by the few people who knew that doctrine for use is what made it a given
type,
NOT tonnage.


> What about types/classes themselves?  Is there some finer breakdown than
> battles, cruisers, carriers, escorts, etc.?  Is there a way to tell a
> frigate from a destroyer, etc. (besides what the designer choose to call
it)?

    No.  The designer is the only one who knows what the proper label for
something is.  The USNavy today has 18 "cruisers" that are smaller than
their destroyers.  And once upon a time, a cruiser twice as large as those
destroyers was labelled a "frigate" (back when we were in a nostalgia phase
in the Navy, and wanted to bring to mind the Constitution and such).
    You may, of course, assign labels to suit yourself, f you don\'t like the
designer\'s.  If your labels don\'t take into account tactical/operational
use for the ships, they will be pretty meaningless, but that\'s your
privilege...

Get that damn grav vehicle off of my train!  You\'re messing up my 
harmonious tech level karma.

Actually, the problems I saw were more because the equipment was
being combat loaded; which means important stuff was being loaded
last so as to be the first thing unloaded.  The problem was, nobody could
agree as to what was important.  

OK, Glisten... A couple of people were surprised that Glisten with its
umpteen billions of population and lots of SDBs would have fallen
to the Ihatei.  I imagine the Aslan did not really invade Glisten so much
as capture all of the surrounding agricultural worlds.  I\'m sure Glisten
had hydroponics and carniculture plants as internal food sources, but
there would have been some form of dependence on supplemental outside
food sources.  Basically, reprocessed algae might keep you
alive, but probably would not keep you overly happy or healthy.  The
Ihatei probably waited a few months and then suggested a small change
in alliegence in exchange for some non-artificial food.  The humans would
get to stay alive, retain their property and eat a good meal, while the Aslan
would gain a high-tech industrial base in the Spinward Marches.

What do you think, sirs?

Hi all,


Are all the weapons in the Twilight:2000 game usable with the TNE game 
system? Is this a new marketing strategy for GDW to make all their games 
compatible? I bring this up because I was looking through issue 72 of
Challenge and there is an article on advanced infantry weapons and the 
stats are identical to TNW weapons.

Which brings about the point, are the vehicles in Twilight:2000 
compatible with TNE rules. I was thinking of running a variant where the 
PCs are from a Tech-7 world and they have to fight off an invading 
Imperial Army of Tec-12. (Abrams vs. G-Carriers, whoopee!)

Greetings Fellow DawnNet Users
You can call me Pierre
I will be using Tariq\'s account with his knowledge to provide information 
that I have acquired through various sources.  Hopefully you will find 
this useful or at least interesting.  Please direct all inquiries 
regarding Arizona Dawn Info Service and NeoSol subsector Info News 
Service to Pierre at this address.

I have uncovered some information about the Gamma Project of which you 
have seen previous references to. 

Apparently the original project initiated on Arizona Dawn 20 yrs or so 
ago was officially closed down by the Federation Government after certain 
ethical and scientific questions were raised.  It now appears that some 
individuals in government, the military and private sector sustained the 
project clandestinely.  When the Unified Sphere was chartered and got 
going the Vega Group, a Union Investigated Service discovered evidence of 
the projects continued exsistence and even evidence that it had 
progressed to human experimentation.

The Gist of the Gamma project is this...
It has long been thought that electronic and photonic components could be 
used to enhance human physical abilities.  This is the well known field 
of cybernetics.  More contreversial is the idea of enhancing human mental 
abilities by directly interfacing the human brain with a processor.  The 
initial Gamma project involved experiments in this field.  It now appears 
that the renewed Gamma project took even this radical idea a step or two 
further.  Its supporters suggested that based on the idea of a computer 
or processor that alters its physical structure according to changes in 
its virtual structure, it could be possible to build a semi-organic 
processer based upon neurological models that would exhibit similar 
performance or behavior.  Much still not known about both the virtual and 
physical structure of the brain it was suggested that an initially semi 
organic yet artificial processer could be devloped (grown?) that could 
interface with the brain in a way no one had previously conceived of.  It 
appears that the supporters just started to see if they could do it 
without thinking if they should or the consequences.  Some critics have 
called the idea a sort of semi-organics computer virus that has the 
cability to infect the human mind.  Consequences....multiplied effeciency 
for other Cybernetic enhancements.  Improved interface with external 
processors, etc.

It appears as one of the more heinous facets of the entire renewed Gamma 
Project that human beings were KIDNAPPED from frontier worlds and less 
developed regions on worlds loosely bound to the then NeoSol Confedertion 
to be used as test subjects...many of these tests failed...I do not know 
what became of those subjects.  Information that Ive collected showed 
that a Raid by a SPACR force somewhere on the frontier shut down the 
project but quite a bit remains unclear about the whole thing.  It is 
rumored that there are some big names involved in this.  I believe that 
the Dawn Foundation and the Vega Group are pursuing the continued 
investigation.  When I obtain more information I will pass it to you.  

I have come across an internal paper written by a Major in the 
Unification Marines that may prove insightful into the philosophy of the 
Corps as well as explain its developmental philosophy before and after 
the Charter.

Thank you for your attention 

Pierre

I just realized that I subconsciously neglected to stress the
interior of the hull for acceleration.  Obviously, it shouldn\'t be
necessary in this design, but if you retrofit a manuver drive of
some sort into the thing, you should consider it.

on RCEG review, musings....

I just realized, if grav belts typically move around by propellor,
and contragrav only reduces a 1G field to 0.01 G, what happens
on a vaccuum world -- do you float down like a feather?  You can\'t
fly to high altitude either.  Your velocity varies with density of 
atmosphere.  Yuck.  I *really* miss the old grav modules.

The _Pyrrhus_ "grav tank" has been identified as the so-called
grav tank in the TNE rulebook, and has a virtually identical 
silhouette to vehicle #11, "Striker Grav Tank, TL9" in DGP\'s
_101 Vehicles_.  I knew I saw it somewhere.

The _Dinimbue_-class express boat, or "xboat", has been used by the
IISS Communications Office for centuries as one of the workhorses of
the Imperial communications network.  Optimized for their job, the 
ships are unsuited for almost any task besides carrying electronic
xmail.  The ship carries extensive databanks and a powerful and 
triply backed-up maser communicator.  Only one communicator is
meant to be powered at a time; the radio is for emergencies and
xboat tender retrieval operations only.  The class is named after
the professor at the University of Sylea who, in 624, designed the
infamous "Poni Express" insignia which has since adorned all IISS 
Communications Office ships and crews.

DESIGNER\'S NOTES:  This is an attempt to capture the spirit of
the old CT xboat design using the FF&S/Brilliant Lances ship design
rules.  Since any size ship may now carry jump drives, the ship
was simply reduced in size by a factor of five, to the minimum
possible size.  The ship is state-of-the-art for the late 600s
Imperial, when the xboat net was started.  To accurately reflect
the high proportion of fuel to cargo, those hits have been spelled
out explicitly in the damage table rather than using the standard
"Hold" result.  (Typical practice in my designs...a little more
realistic.)  Since the sensors are a bit sub-par (which seems to
be typical of GDW ships like this), I assume that the tender has a 
beacon which makes it easy for the xboat to center its\' commaser.
The old "80% for quantity purchase of class ships discount" is applied
in parentheses under price.  

Like the classic xboat, it\'s a sitting duck.  The ironic thing is,
considering the size of this craft, it really *does* deserve the
title "boat" instead of the "ship" any jump vessel rightly deserves.

round however I was trying to keep in mind that this is science FICTION 
and I was mainly looking for special effects as well as a justification 
for choosing the weapon over an M-16A1....I realize that It is important 
to maintain consistency within the rules but I would really love it if 
someone can come up with a weapon that produces the desired dramatic 
effect yet is still relatively compact.  A plasma carbine or pistol, Even 
if you could build it, in the current sequence it would have a short 
range of a few meters and about the same damage as a .45 and cost a 
helluva lot more.  Maybe I should just suck it up and realize that the 
PC, NPC should chose between his slug pistol or a laser pistol as his/her 
sidearm...I think that I will do this.  Anyway a laser pistol can have a 
pretty high damage for a sidearm and only rigid armor is gonna stop it.  
Range is of course only human physiologically limited.  Im gonna whip put 
my FFS over the weekend and see if a gauss pistol gets up there.

I should point out however that a head shot from a tl 8 9mm 2D6 pistol has a 
30% of instantly killing a PC with a Con of 6.  If the shooter is a short 
range (say 8m) and has a slug pistol asset of say 7(4) =11
He has a 16/20 or 80% chance of success. (Average Shot, 17-20 Auto miss)
Furthermore there is a 11/20 (55%) chance of outstanding success doubling 
the average damage of 7 to 14.  The product of these two probabilities is 
44%  Now there is a 14/20 (70%) chance that a D20 will roll under the damage
of 14 thereby doubling the damage again to 28 which is more than twice 
the PC head hit points (2 x Con).  The net prob is 0.8 * 0.55 * 0.7 = 0.3  
Make this a 3-D6 pistol and the percentage goes up I believe to 49%

BUT
It could be that my reasoning is flawed..but Im fairly sure it isnt as 
far as the net probability is concerned

My interpretation of the rules is flawed in that you do not cumatively 
multiply damage, the second doubling only adds the double the original 
damage but again Im pretty sure my interpretation is correct.  This 
certainly produces a when it rains it pours effect.  The round that gets 
you really gets you!

Thats more than enough from me

    'body' => 'In answer to the recent question about how ship types are classified, the
Imperial ship classifications appear to be somewhat arbitrary. Here\'s a
description of the system I used for the Neubayern Federation Navy:

Battleship--  A ship designed to pulverize any other ship, with heavy bay
armament and a big spinal mount. 100,000+ tons.

Battlecruiser--  A ship midway between a battleship and a cruiser, basically
the smallest ship that could still go up against a battleship and not
necessarily be committing suicide. :-) 50,000-100,000 tons.

Strike Cruiser--  A classification invented because I had a "heavy cruiser"
design with more firepower than the old battlecruiser, and I thought that
sounded odd. Eventually, it actually developed a real meaning--a cruiser
designed more for battles than for other cruiser duties. 40,000-50,000 tons.

Heavy Cruiser--  An all-purpose ship that could serve either as a powerful
battle unit, as a patrol unit, or as anything else I came up with. Many of
them served as remarkably well-armed hospital ships. :-)  30,000-40,000 tons.

Light Cruiser/Raiding Cruiser--  Different names for the same thing, this was
a cruiser that specialized in commerce-raiding and long-range strikes at an
enemy\'s rear area. The CL/CR bit rose from the fact that the Alliance needed
a "Raiding Cruiser," which I designed, but the NFN officially disapproved of
raiding (despite wanting the means to do it). 20,000-30,000 tons.

Destroyer--  A ship designed for escort and fire support duty. It differed
from a cruiser primarily in the lack of a spinal mount and significant troop
contingent. 10,000-20,000 tons.

Fleet Escort--  A ship that was designed as a TL12 copy of the Imperial _P.F.
Sloan_ class. I was never very impressed with these (despite their adequate
performance), probably because of their somewhat poorly thought-out origin.
5,000-10,000 tons.

Fleet Tender--  A ship designed to carry battle riders. 100,000+ tons.

Fleet Carrier--  A ship designed to carry fighters for offensive action in
special Heavy Carrier Squadrons. 100,000+ tons.

Carrier--  A ship designed to carry fighters for defensive action
accompanying other types of squadrons. Note that despite the intention, there
wasn\'t a real division of the carrier roles in practice, and the smaller type
got written off as a bad idea. 50,000-100,000 tons.

Heavy Rider--  A battle rider built to carry a spinal mount, with no other
offensive weapons. 20,000 tons.

Light Rider--  A battle rider built to carry offensive bay weapons, and
nothing else. 10,000 tons.

Fast Patrol Boat--  A sort of "super fighter" built around a single 100-ton
bay. It was an experimental design that was supposed to operate just like a
really big, really tough fighter.

Fighter--  All of these were originally meant to engage enemy capital ships,
but it didn\'t work this way. Only the 90-ton FA-5 Krait was up to fighting
ships with an realistic chance of success. The Krait was also being tested as
a glorified point defence system for engaging incoming missiles.

1) The economics of building and running starships as set forth in various 
   CT and MegaT products makes it impossible for a high-population world to 
   base it\'s food supply on imports; the available trade fleet is simply not 
   big enough to import a significant amount of food. (A low or medium 
   population world can do it if it relies on the trade fleet of a nearby 
   high-population world). (Possiby things have changed with TNE, but if so 
   I\'d like to see some figures.) Glisten MUST produce nearly all of it\'s
   own food (And why do you think that a TL 15 society will have to make
   do with processed algae?)

2) History has shown that people can stand quite a long siege on low rations. 
   Even if Glisten imported, say, 10% of it\'s food, and even if those 10% 
   meant the difference between just getting by and slow starvation, Glisten 
   could hold out for a long time. Time enough for the Imperium to free the 
   aforementioned food-supplying worlds. And, of course, Glisten could
   always import food from worlds farther away; it would cost more, but 
   Glisten is one of the four richest systems in the Spinward Marches. Not
   to mention one of the four most important systems to the Imperial Navy.

3) Glisten is 20-30 parsec from the nearest substantial Aslan world. It
   will be incredible easy for the Imperium to disrupt their supply lines.

4) Aslan ihatei do not have the strength to stand angainst even a modest
   Imperial fleet. Split up and spread out across all these agricultural
   worlds they become even easier to deal with.

[About the strength of Aslan ihatei: It cost money to outfit ihatei fleets, 
money that the clan must deduct from it\'s naval budget. Outfit too many 
and you friendly neighbouring rival clan will jump your clan holdings at 
home. Ihatei fleets consist of roughly 50% fighting ships and 50% transport 
ships (the cost of their scout ships is negligible in comparison to the other
two ship types). This cuts their fighting strength in half. Ihatei fleets 
are outfitted with obsolescent clan vessels, making the typical ihatei 
fleet TL 12 and jump-3, worse even than Imperial subsector forces, let 
alone Imperial regulars. Strategically there runs a broad starless gap of 
more than 3 parsecs\' width through the Trojan Reach from the Great Rift to 
Beyond. Only in two places can jump-3 ships cross this gap without using 
drop tanks or deep space fuel depots. Given a half-decent spy network a
reasonably competent Imperial admiral coud garrison the two choke points
and patrol the rest of the far side to seriously hinder the buildup of drop 
tanks and the laying of fuel depots. Politically the ihatei come from 29
major and scores of minor clans. The biggest clan can hardly represent more
than 5% of the total Aslan strength. If they act independently their fleets
will be small enough to be threathened even by individual Imperial squadrons,
and if they cooperate they have to work out whose ships goes where in any
fleet action (What clan admiral will consent to having his ships blown up to 
destroy an Imperial fleet so that the othert clans can reap the reward?)]

(Then there\'s the problem of defending your wives and cubs once you\'ve
managed to settle them somewhere. Remember the world where all the humans 
died of a mysterious disease which didn\'t bother the Aslans? Yeah, right!
If that really happened that world would be glowing in the dark a few
months later).

Dr Maximillian Economopolous  (Dr Max Eco)      Born 36,1150 Aurigae

Dr Eco was born outside the coastal city Adskir\'s Landing on the planet 
Aurigae and grew up on or near the water because of the seafaring 
tradition of the region.  He developed an early interest in computer 
technology and continued to develop this despite his early seafaring life.  
Boredom and economic reasons led to Max\'s joining the merchant marine at 
the age of 17.  With a cooperative captain he was able to streamline the 
operations of his ship and increase its effeciency in more ways than 
one.  After a couple years in Max decided to pursue his interest in 
computer technology and due to his aptitude was able to win a scholarship 
to study at Sol City University on Prima, then capital of the NeoSol 
Confederation.  While there he continued his maritime pursuits by diving 
and racing powerboats on the lake just outside the spreading city.  Max 
got an university degree in Computer Technology and was invited to pursue 
graduate work.  He developed an interest in the very theories of computer 
science and studied such concepts and virtual reality and biological 
combinations with computer technology.  He ultimately developed an 
interest in quantum computer technology. (dont ask)  After finishing the 
graduate program he obtained his doctorate in Computer Science.  The 
scholarship required that he serve an 8 yr term in the Federation Scientific 
Agency and did so studying the problem of heuristic computer systems 
whose physcial structure is modified by the virtual structure.  He also 
spent some time studying the problem of electronic/photonic interfacing 
with biological organisms and was part of a team that tested some simple 
enhancements on animals.  Its ultimate goal was the cybernetic enhancement of 
humans in a whole new way.  The program at this stage showed little 
promise of success.  Due to changes of focus and ethical questions the 
program was discontinued.  After completing his term Dr Eco returned to his
home planet Aurigae to the University of Ayken located in the Nemon 
Province.  Archaeologists there had discovered both an ancient Sea Bottom 
Arcology as well as an ancient base of some sort, dates were put at 1000 
yrs or better.  The Arcology had been intentionally flooded or so the 
theory went but the cause was not known.  What got Dr Eco involved was 
that both sites contained fragments of various sizes of some sort of 
three dimensional crystalline computer core.  Dr Eco believed he could 
recover some of the virtaul knowledge from these fragments based upon his 
quantum computing models and theories.  This combined with the draw of 
the sea led Dr Eco to join the sea going research team where he spent 
most of his time aboard the Aurigae Explorer, a survey ship.  As 
fragments were recovered with Dr Eco personally recovering some, an 
interesting picture developed.  During this time there was a potentially 
very dangerous conflict brewing.  A people known as the Nemons primarily 
because they lived in that province on Aurigae around the supposedly 
ancient city of Nemo\'s Landing were(and still do) claiming to be the 
indigenous people of Aurigae (or more indigenous than anyone else by 2000 
years or so).  The Union of Senled, an emerging military power claimed 
that this was not true and that the Nemon region actually is part of some 
Kingdom of Senled that did indeed exsist about 120 yrs ago.  The evidence 
collected by the surveys was suggesting that the Nemons have been there 
at least 1000 yrs or more.  The computer core fragments that were being 
analyzed by Dr Eco appeared to be Imperial.  Furthermore there are 
numerous references to people who called themselves Nemons who had been 
there hundreds of years or more by that time.  Was the Arcology the 
remnants of an Imperial facility on Aurigae?  Are the Nemons Solomani 
settlers from the second Imperium or even Before? How long have they been 
on Aurigae?  If they are proven to be indigenous what does this mean?  
Will the Confederation use this as an excuse to weaken the emerging Union 
of Senled? Probably!!

Assisting Dr Eco in his investigations were his brother and Sister-in-Law
Gellek Adan, and Giselle Adan.  Their young daughter Amura back home in 
junior academy on Arizona Dawn.  While Dr Eco was ashore at the 
University of Ayken analyzing some new fragments a mysterious explosion 
ripped through the Aurigae Explorer while it was on another survey 
operation.  Going down in less than two minutes all aboard were drowned.  
Several bodies were never recovered including those of Max\'s brother and 
sister in law.  Dr Eco went to Enope to raise his neice Amura for 
his dead brother.  Years later he returned to Aurigae.  Follow up surveys 
confirmed the wreckage of the doomed ship.  Dr Eco himself dived on the 
wreckage in shallow water...something wasnt right about the 
wreckage....sabotage?  When he returned to the University he found 
his office ransacked.  His samples and artifacts gone, his data stores 
wiped.  Two days later the Union of Senled invaded the Nemon Province.  
One attempt on his life encouraged Dr Eco to leave Aurigae, which he did 
traveling to Arizona Dawn where he was recruited by the Vega Group a 
Unified Planetary Sphere govt ageny.  Here he was put on a team that was 
involoved in the top secret investigation of the Gamma Project.  His 
prior experience with biological electronic/photonic interfacing being 
directed related to ambitous and unethical project. Dr Eco makes 
infrequent contact with his niece Amura Adan who is in charge of the 
corporate Action Team for NeoSol Systems Company.

possible.  There might even be a trend in the Regency\'s military to look for 
low tech solutions to military requirements.  A FN-FAL has no electronic parts
to host a VIRUS egg, for example.  

The Black war poses some very challenging problems for the Regency.  
Having to deal with a raider jumping in at the 100 diameter limit, 
blasting at full accelleration to the target, dumping its bombload of 100 
Megaton Nukes, and coasting out to the 100 diameter limit to jump away is 
a frightening threat.  Vampire vessels can exercise this same tactic so 
keeping a defense for this sort of attack is still required in the new era.

The rebellion suggests that the Regency should design a "Military with a 
conscious".  Officers should be expected to exercise some judment on 
following orders.  A ship captain assigned to carpet bomb an orphanage 
should be expected to use his or her conscious to conclude that this is a 
wastefull unmilitary activity and that this order should be refused.

I\'m just scratching the surface here.  I think that any military force 
designed for the Regency will be shaped by its history  and the history 
of its neighbors.  It will also be shaped by the perceived needs of the 
Regency.  To design a military for the Regency requires that we identify 
these needs and find possible solutions for them.  I realise that this is 
not as glamourous as deciding how many MBT\'s per platoon, but by building 
a firm foundation first we will save ourselves a great deal of pain later on.

    'body' => 'In the "discussion" ("flames" is starting to be a better word) of fleet 
sizes, bear in mind that you are talking about two different sets of 
numbers.  TCS has budgets based on population and governments, and this 
figure covers _everything_.  The fleet sizes in Rebellion Sourcebook and 
elsewhere are _not_ everything.
 
The figures in Rebellion Sourcebook only include cruisers, carriers, 
battleships and some escorts; they omit entire squadrons like AssaultRons 
(which I think explains a good point that someone made about how all the 
invasion forces could be carried by the number given for ships available 
to Dulinor).  I would imagine that the figure would certainly only be 
operational ships, and so would exclude ships in mothballs or "ordinary".
 
The figures in Rebellion Sourcebook are internally inconsistent anyway.  
Even if you interpret the 1000 ships figure as being each for numbered 
and numbered reserve fleets, it still seems small; 16 minimum size 
numbered fleets of 50 ships is 800 ships, which leaves little leeway.  If 
you don\'t believe that the 1000 ships is each for numbered and numbered 
reserve fleets, it is even further out.
 
To further explain the apparent inconsistency, there is the maintenance 
overhead aspect of the TCS rules (10% for operational ships and 1% for 
ships in ordinary).  Both the economics of shipbuilding and published 
sources surely show that there would be many ships in ordinary.  I have 
not seen this taken into account in some of the discussions.
(Incidentally, does anyone know why these are so high? Operational 
civilian ships only need 0.1%).  
 
Anyway, if you take Glisten as an example, it has an annual military 
budget of about TCr4.  Even if it had the biggest yards in the galaxy, it 
could still only build TCr40 worth of operational ships, as maintenance 
of these would soak up the entire military budget.  In Fighting Ships of 
the Shattered Imperium (which I know is not the best source of designs in 
the world, but it is official), TCr40 doesn\'t buy all that many _big_ 
ships; Battleships and Dreadnoughts are commonly TCr1 or more.
 
Even when you add in the taxation income from the rest of the subsector, 
the figures do not grow by orders of magnitude (particularly if you 
reduce the value of the money by starport/TL), since Glisten dominates 
virtually every other world in the subsector.
 
Anyway, it looks to me that GDW have always been deliberately vague about 
definitions of numbers, to avoid apparent contradictions like this.  So 
you are all free to some extent to interpret the numbers how you like.

Uncle!  I don\'t have *TCS* so I can\'t discuss it.  We\'ve fallen over into

Yes, I know.  This is where we agree.  There are Real World examples of
*economic* cycles, but . . .

Why?  This is what I\'m having difficulty with.  You realize just *one* 
single example of a world that went *down* in TL and then back up would
make your case?  So far, I haven\'t seen such an example.

I think you\'re confusing the *use* of technology with the ability to
*produce* technology.  I think this figures in the historical example of
Regina that you keep using.  (I\'ll get to that in a bit.)  Nevertheless,
I\'ll give you this Depression-era `techno-economic\' cycle if you\'ll grant
me that the *keiritsu* are a good example of feudal technocracy.

Okay, a poor analogy but you get my point.

But I wouldn\'t call that capability the same as the tech level of the folks
that built the boiler.  Again, I think you\'re confusing use with the
ability to produce.  Didn\'t we already settle on that a long time ago?
("That" being the idea that TL measures the ability to *produce* a certain
level of technology rather than the mere use or presence of it.)

This is a good rationale.  I can accept this, but . . .

*TCS* *also* gives much bigger fleets than the MegaTraveller *Rebellion
Sourcebook*, another role-playing *and* later-occurring source.  Since *5FW*
and *RS* seem to be somewhat in agreement, one might make the case for
accepting them over *TCS* and *HG*.  I\'m not necessarily proposing this,
I\'m just trying to point out that the choice isn\'t as clear to me as
it seems to be to others.

I don\'t think it\'s appropriate to judge works outside the era they were
created.  My point is that if Piper had been writing in the late \'70s,
I doubt this particular difference would exist, just as it was `impossible\'
for the folks at GDW to create an `unenlightened\' Sword Worlds in 1978.

But isn\'t this information no more `reliable\' than early `official\' data
that painted the Zhos as `mind-sucking totalitarians\'?  We have to accept
that these sorts of observations reflect the bias of whatever Imperial
`observer\' provided the information.  GDW has established a tradition of
painting such sources as being `biased\' to one degree or another.  That\'s
always been one of the appeals of Traveller to me.  Every point of view
is ambiguous - no simplistic `chaotic good\' templates here!

Okay, let\'s a gree to disagree.  This whole Piper bit is an obscure tangent
anyway.  (But I\'ll bet some TML\'ers are out combing the shelves of used
book stores for Piper works!)

I *get* the *economic* fluctuation, what I don\'t get is how *technological*
ability gets tied to it!  Beside your Depression-era example (which 
represents the most serious economic cycle ever *and* confuses use with
ablity to produce) I can\'t think of any other.

Basic scientific method:  my explanation of "slow, steady, uneventful"
growth explains the observable facts without any need of your mysterious
cycles.  On the other hand, just *one* example of a *down-turn* would make
your case.  So far, it hasn\'t been made.  (And things like the Long Night
or the Viral Collapse don\'t count!)

Okay, here\'s where I think you\'re confusing *use* with *ability to produce*.
The comment above suggests to me that you\'re assuming Regina was at TL 10
in 75.  How could it possibly be at the time it was settled?  There were
no factories, no maintenance facilities, no *anything*!  The only
technological capability in the system was on the settlement ship(s).
Maybe these were at TL 7 or something but it must have been *decades*
(if not longer) before any starships were being built on Regina.

Of course, this all goes to pieces if you don\'t accept the `ability to
produce\' definition for TL.  The problem with `use\' is that every world
on the map becomes *at least* TL 9 every time a starship lands!

> I\'m beginning to see where you\'re going wrong.

Well, at least we\'ve found something to agree upon again.  :-)

Bingo!  You\'ve caught me.  This is how I understand a feudal technocracy
from reading Piper.  Since I believe the GDW Sword Worlds have a great deal
in common with Piper\'s I accept that GDW must have lifted the idea of a
feudal technocracy from Piper.

Not that I have come across.

> Have there ever been a formal feudal technocracy in Real Life?

Yes, I think the Japanese *keiritsu* (which is not a `corporate government\'
but I\'ll get to that in a bit) is a feudal technocracy.

This is good, but you\'re about to confuse *owning* the means of production
with *managing* an operation, i.e. a corporate government.

A corporate government is a specialized form of autocracy.  In a corporate
government everyone involved is an *employee* of the person(s) in charge.
They have no choice but to follow the dictates of the manager or leave
the company.  Maybe I led you astray by describing the `king\' in a feudal
technocracy as a `CEO\'.  This was inaccurate and I apologize.  The `king\'
is like the Chairman of the Board of Directors (often also the CEO).  As
such she is repsonsible for seeing that the will of the shareholders is
carried out.

In a corporate government the CEO does not have to listen to the Vice
Presidents or other officers of the company -  she gives the orders and
they carry them out.  In a feudal technocracy, the Chairman ignores
the voices of the other Directors (who represent blocs of shareholders)
at her peril.  When things get tough, the directors *remove* the Chairman
and find a replacement.  In the corprate model, when things get tough
for an Executive Vice President, she finds another job (or jumps out
a window).

In a feudal technocracy the `king\' owns the largest bloc of shares of
*everything* but he doesn\'t necessarily own everything.  If no one owns a
controlling bloc you get balkanization, like Joyeuse.  The `king\' may
own everything, may own a majority of shares, or may own a plurality of
shares (the biggest bloc but not a majority).  `Fief\' holders under the
`king\' will have stronger positions (and more independence) as the `king\'
owns less of the total holdings.

A good modern example outside the *keiritsu* would be the influence of
pension fund managers on corporate America today.  Because pension funds
often hold huge blocs of stock in a corporation they are able to influence
the policies and practices of the corporation.  They are, in effect, the
`fiefholders\' of the Chairman or `king\' who may still control the largest
bloc of shares but is no where near having a majority holding.

The key element here is that in a feudal technocracy the economic influence
of shareholders translates directly into politcal power.

> Granted, but the only way you can get that influence is if the king of
> Gram allows you to buy that controlling interest.

No, only if he owns everything.  If he only owns a plurality or majority
his `barons\' can sell their shares at will.

> The king theoretically _owns_ those shares and
> what you pay for must be the right to benefit from them. And one of the

Right, and if King Harald buys an interest in Gram\'s holdings he becomes
a player in the political system there.  He may choose to honor his
`bond\' to King Angus (sorry, I\'m sticking with Piper) or he may not.  My
point is that since, under my world view, Sacnoth is the strongest 
economic power, Harald will one day triumph over Angus.  Unless of course
Angus has managed to control all the shares on Gram, in which case Gram
becomes an autocracy rather than a feudal technocracy.  (And then Harald
just uses his higher TL military to defeat Angus!)

I\'ll give you this is you give me an example of a downward turn in your
cycles, otherwise I\'m sticking with the scientific method.  :-)

I think I\'ve made a decent start.

Not quite. In your discussion with Cynthia and Steve you have two different
conditions (the different sizes of fleets) that is irreconcilable and
consequently the problem of which source to accept. In the economy question 
we have one condition set forth by one source and not mentioned in any 
other source. Since there is no contradiction I submit that we should go by
the one source we do have (Actually, we have two since _Striker_ gives
similar (though not identical) results. _Striker_ and _TCS_ are, however,
contemporary). The only known source we have on the effect of TLs on the
economy states that the difference of one TL on otherwise identical worlds
is that the higher TL planet\'s money is worth 5% more.

>>economic instability _should_ result in TL instability. 
> 
>Why? This is what I\'m having difficulty with.

Is the difficulty with the fact that there are no examples, or is it the
very concept you can\'t accept? If the first there\'s not much I can do 
since I proposed them to explain somthing else. Since they are, therefor,
merely inferred I don\'t see how you can expect an example. If I had an
example I wouldn\'t have to infer it. If it\'s the concept, however, I shall
try to illustrate. Not that technological cycles must be, but merely that
they could be:

Example 1:
"I/S Hansen Motor" on Gram who builds jump-1 and -2 engines decides to
expand and builds an new assembly line in their factory for producing 
jump-3 engines. Gram now becomes TL 12 in space technology (by definition). 
"Sleipner Spring-motorer", the well-known jump engine manufacturer on
Sacnoth notes the subsequent drop in sales of jump engines to Gram and 
lowers the price on jump-3 engines. Baron Hansen decides that he can\'t afford
to fight this move and converts his jump-3 assembly line to make jump-2
engines. Gram is now, once again, TL 11. 

Example 2:
As before, but this time Hansen manages to get some other nobles to back
him and proceeds to sell jump-3 engines to all of Sleipner\'s former customers 
driving Sleipner off the market. Sacnoth is now TL 11 (in space tech).

(Btw. there\'s another, perfectly simple, explanation of how Gram could be
as strong as Sacnoth (Note that I don\'t agree that they need to be): Gram
could be solidly TL 11 in most areas and TL 12 in space technology while
Sacnoth was TL 12 in just enough parts to qualify for TL 12 status but of
only TL 10-11 in other, vital areas (Check _World Builder\'s Handbook_ for
details).)

How many worlds do we have any historical data on? A mere handful. While an
example might prove my point, the absence dosen\'t disprove it (since I\'m
merely trying to establish that it could happen).

No I don\'t. If the depression drove some people to abandon their cars, a
more severe depression could, conceivably, have driven almost everybody
to do so. If that happened, most car factories would close down and very
few new cars would be made (In fact, for a time you might have people 
using old cars that were no longer manufactured  -  a use TL _higher_ 
than the production TL).

Can\'t do that since I still don\'t know exactly how the *keiritsu* work. I\'ll
accept that they form your definition of a feudal technology, but I suspect
that your definition is not the only possible one. Certainly your definition
is not that of a feudal system (though I acknowledge that compound words
sometimes take on a meaning quite different from any of it\'s components. I
would regard that as a bit of a cop-out, though. IMO a feudal technocracy
ought to be feudal in some way).

Neither did I. I said that the people who couldn\'t _build_ a boiler might,
nevertheless, be perfectly capable of repairing it. This was in connection
with being able to maintain higher-han-your-own-TL equipment, remember?

I think so. At least, I heartily concur. TL _ought_ to indicate the ability 
to produce (unfortunately there are countless worlds with low population and 
high TL where that dosen\'t make sense. How can 10 men build a starship?).

Try comparing the _TCS_ naval expenditure of Cr 500 per citizen with the
real world (Double it to account for non-space forces too). A credit is
supposed to correspond to a US$. Now compute the taxes the average 
swordworlder would pay to support 42 200,000 T battleships  -  no, make 
that 500,000-tonners if you like. Compare that figure to the real world.

Do you really think that no contemporary of Piper wrote about social
systems with more equal treatment of men and women than his Sword Worlds?
Or that TCS couldn\'t have gotten away with describing a minor, antagonistic
power as far more repressive than they did?

Because if technology wasn\'t tied to economic features then most every
world in Charted Space would be TL 15! (Except those with religious or
philosophically induced limits.)

>Beside your Depression-era example (which 
>represents the most serious economic cycle ever *and* confuses use with

Conceeded, but let me address that confusion of use and ability to produce.
I\'m not confusing the two. But if something becomes too expensive to buy,
don\'t you think that it would shortly thereafter go out of production? So
if use decline sufficiently and does pick up again, the ability to produce
automatically disappears too.

Except that they represent a stagnation of the economy that is quite
incredible to me. It\'s the \'slow\' I object to. One TL in umpteen centuries
is not slow, it\'s moribund.

Right. I will give you those decades. I\'ll even make them centuries. So the

EIGHT centuries and two more in two decades?

Funny, I too think that Piper\'s Gram describes a feudal society, possibly
even what GDW thought of when they coined the term \'feudal technocracy\', 
but I disagree that it describes one that works the way you claim. The only 
shares I remember mentioned is the ones in the Tanith Venture, an offworld
commercial venture. Every other \'holding\' in the book is a solid land fief.
The holdings are enhanced by various commercial features like the mines
on Traskon and the Karvall steel mills, but the old feudal fiefs were also
enhanced in value from whatever water mills and mines to be found on them.
Piper\'s Gram is merely a feudal monarchy set in a more technological
advanced age than the medieval feudal monarchies of Terra.

It only just struck me, but why are you assuming that there are any share-

theoretically owns all the industry (the source of power analogous to land 
in a feudal society) and lends it out in exchange for support."

Who owns the corporation in a corporate government? Who owns it in a feudal
technocracy? What\'s the difference? 

I think it would be useful to agree on the equivalences of various terms
in the three systems we\'re talking about. Here\'s mine:

Traditional feudal society      Corporation             Feudal technocracy

King                                 -                  King

The king is the man who owns the fiefs and doles them out in return for
support from his vassals. In that respect he is the equivalent of the
owner or the shareholders of a corporation. But an owner\'s power does not
depend on the support of their CEOs, so there is no real correspondence.

 Fief                           Corporation             Corporation

Land was what supported the fighting men that was the military power in the
old feudal monarchies. In more advanced societies industrial holdings pro-
duce wealth that pays for military power.

Vassal (Duke/Count/etc.)        CEO                     Vassal

The vassal manages the fief for the king. If the fief is an industrial
holding then his work resembles that of a company CEO.

Steward/Reeve/Guard Captain     Company Officer         Company Officer

The officers who helps to run the holding, hired and fired by the man in
charge.

Sub-fief                        Subsidiary              Subsidiary

A vassal may parcel out parts of his holding to lesser vassals. 

Feudal service                  Dividends               Feudal service

In a feudal society a vassal pays his liege lord with service, not with
money. Shareholders, on the other hand, recieve their pay in money.

     -                          Board of Directors           -
     -                          Shareholders                 -

These have no real equivalents in a feudal society.

>In a feudal technocracy the `king\' owns the largest bloc of shares of
>*everything* but he doesn\'t necessarily own everything.  

You didn\'t get this from Piper. Duke Angus owns his holdings outright. Baron
Trask owns all of Traskon. Baron Karvall owns all of Karvall. When Lucas
Trask pledges Traskon in return for a ship, Angus gets the whole bit, not
just a share of it. 

>If no one owns a
>controlling bloc you get balkanization, like Joyeuse.  

If the Dukes can\'t agree on who to support for king you get balkanization.

>A good modern example outside the *keiritsu* would be the influence of
>pension fund managers on corporate America today.  Because pension funds
>often hold huge blocs of stock in a corporation they are able to influence
>the policies and practices of the corporation.  They are, in effect, the
>`fiefholders\' of the Chairman or `king\' who may still control the largest
>bloc of shares but is no where near having a majority holding.

Still sounds like corporate politics. I don\'t see where the feudal bit gets
into it at all. The Chairman of a Corporation dosen\'t excersise _any_
control over the pension funds, does he? The pension fund managers dosen\'t
perform services for the Corporation Chairman, do they (They don\'t even
pay him money). Thus there is no true equivalence between the pension fund 
managers and a fiefholder in a feudal society.

I realize that I assume that the word \'feudal\' in \'feudal technocracy\' has a 
semantic content close to the normal definition of the word and is not a
mere buzz-word. 

>The key element here is that in a feudal technocracy the economic influence
>of shareholders translates directly into politcal power.

In a feudal technocracy industrial holdings IMO takes the place of land for 
the purposes of generating the wealth that translates into power.

>>Granted, but the only way you can get that influence is if the king of
>>Gram allows you to buy that controlling interest.
> 
>No, only if he owns everything.  If he only owns a plurality or majority
>his `barons\' can sell their shares at will.

If he owns them he can dictate who gets to buy them.

>>The king theoretically _owns_ those shares and

>>things you must pay with is the promise to support him.
> 
>Right, and if King Harald buys an interest in Gram\'s holdings he becomes
>a player in the political system there.  

But what if King Anders just refuse to let his baron sell his holding?

>He may choose to honor his `bond\' to King Angus 

He damn well better.

>(sorry, I\'m sticking with Piper) 

Why? We are talking about the GDW Sword Worlds, aren\'t we? Why invite
confusion?

>or he may not.  

Thereby forfeiting his right to the fief. 

>My point is that since, under my world view, Sacnoth is the strongest 
>economic power, Harald will one day triumph over Angus.  

1) Being stronger is not an automatic ticket to victory.
2) He isn\'t that much stronger.
3) Assuming just for a moment that your view of feudal technocracies is
   true (which I doubt), the whole concept could as easily work the other 
   way round. King Anders could own huge blocks of Sacnoth industry, making 
   Harald a puppet of his.

>Unless of course
>Angus has managed to control all the shares on Gram, in which case Gram
>becomes an autocracy rather than a feudal technocracy.  

If Anders owns all of Gram he will have to put people in charge of parts of 
it, which could result in various systems, including a feudal technocracy. 

 .(And then Harald
>just uses his higher TL military to defeat Angus!)

Again you assume that Harald and his ancestors would want to conquer Gram
militarily. Again I suggest that they may not be ready to pay the price.

No, I was talking about their respective GPPs. Of course, if King Anders
owns a big slice of Sacnoth, he gets a good slice of their GPP too ;-)

Try this: The knowledge exists, but is still very expensive. An example
might be our very own space program. How many projects have been cancelled
or postponed because of budget constraints? (With the number of NASA people
on the list I\'m sure I\'ll get an answer ;)

Money funds research. Research advances Technology. Therefore, economic
fluctuations will affect the development of technology.

As has been pointed out, in a severe economic slump, technology can decline
(We can by 10 TL10 ships for the price of 2 TL11 ships? Let\'s go retro!)
because of reduced demand. WHile only a severe catastrophe can reduce a
world\'s TL significantly, it can be stalled and degenerated by economics.

A final note: If you\'ve  played Sid Meier\'s Civilization game, or games
similar toit, you know that economics plays a big part in your
technological advancement. Sure, you may know how to build the Hoover Dam,
but how long will it take to save enough money to build it? To be sure,
Civilation isn\'t the most precise model of population advancement, but it
is based on principles that hold through today and tomorrow.

One quick comment:

Most of the Rebellion-era discussion I\'ve heard about the improbability
of Regency losses has been focused on Glisten and the Aorlakht.  But
according to David Johnson\'s list from a few days back, an equally
silly example is the Vargr conquest of Junidy.  It may be nominally
only tech-9, but it has 28 billion people and an Imperial Naval base
and IISS Way Station, and a Vargr trading station.  The only possible
excuse would be for the native Llellwyloly to go over whole heartedly
to the Vargr, and somehow this seems unlikely....

    'body' => 'More troubles on the FF&S/BL front:

Lately I decided to try to check out the boundaries of the starship design
rules by building a K\'kree Xeekr\'kir! (Imperial designation "Merchant").
Obviously, FF&S/BL is meant for Imperial ships only.  However, the only
main differences were in accommodations, airlocks, and a few other details
of ship design which were easily converted from CT rules.  (The changes
can roughly be summed up that the K\'kree require twelve times the space
Humans do for movement and living.)

The trouble came when I started calculating crew sizes.  K\'kree usually 
travel in herds -- besides working crew, accommodations need to be set aside
for wives, bodyguards, advisors, and so on.  Between this and their space
requirements, they needed 5000+ ton ships in CT.  This allowed, in CT, a
primary crew of ten or so, and about sixty or seventy family members, some
of whom also had shipboard duties of various types.  The ship I designed
had jump-2, one gee drives.

But crew requirements have exploded in TNE.  This 6000 ton ship required 
some 4 engineers for the drives in CT/MT.  In TNE, my preliminary and now
abandoned calculations indicate a requirement of some 64 engineers.  This 
effectively closes out K\'kree star travel on this size class of ship.  My
quick estimates suggest that the K\'kree may now require starships in the
battleship size class under TNE rules (100,000+ tons).

It looks like this rule change effectively closes out the K\'kree as a 
starfaring power.  It is now extremely difficult for K\'kree herds to 
move about at all like they did in CT.

Now, I don\'t know what the justification for the increases in crew size are
in TNE.  If it\'s a reaction to the *#@$ virus, they neither say so anywhere
nor provide alternative crew calculations for non-Virus campaigns.  Any
input or comments on this business?

Furthermore, this sort of thing sharply limits the size of the ships that
human adventuring crews can run with the party.  And warships of significant
size will have truly stupendous crew requirements.

Somebody asked recently why so many old-time "classic" Traveller players
are complaining about the rules changes, because they\'d never seen AD&D
players react like this when AD&D Second Edition came out.  Well, my friend,
that\'s because TSR didn\'t do something that at times I could describe with a 
pungent four-letter Anglo-Saxon word to the rules.  Right now is one of those
times, but I\'m restraining myself.  AD&D 2nd Ed. *is* AD&D.  TNE isn\'t quite 
old Traveller.  So some of us who played for a long time with the old rules
get upset sometimes when things we think had better work don\'t, again.  It 
doesn\'t happen so much over there, I hear.

A while back someone wanted a better direct fire range formula for mass

The following is one I worked out:
                      r          (  3.858*10^-6*Muzzle Vel     )
Short range (m) =---- ln( ---- +1 )
                  1.286*10^-5    (            r                )
r is in cm, muzzle vel is in m/s.
Send me a message if you want to know how I derived it!
Or if you don\'t want to use the natural log button on your calculator (or 
spreadsheet) a very rough fix is to use 0.25 instead of 0.015 in GDW\'s 
formula.

For indirect fire use 0.01 instead of GDW\'s 0.004.

The first 2 Empire class carrying the first 54 Vanguards constituted a true 
"Trillion Credit Squadron".

About the ongoing TCS v\'s FFW debate, the thing to remember is that the TCS 
budget is based on the taxes paid by the average Imperial citizen that is 
devoted to the upkeep of the Imperial navy. Just what the average citizen of 
the Imperium actually is can only be determined by adding up the 
population*TL of every world and dividing by the population of the Imperium. 
I\'m not going to do that but I think that the average citizen probably lives 
on a TL 10-11 world with a class C starport. Thus by the time the money gets 
spent building and maintaining ships on TL14-15 worlds with class A 
starports its only worth half as much. Once you take into account the amount 
of money diverted to run the bureaucracy and R&D,( to keep ahead of the 
Zho\'s etc. Just think of the amounts of money spent by the likes of Lockheed 
to not build aircraft :-)), you have probably Halved the money again! Then 
take out the money required for expendables ( try adding up the cost of all 
those nukes) and your not left with all that much to buy ships with!

Stay tuned for "The Compleat FF&S Errata" or "Why didn\'t they get someone to 
proofread the bloody thing"

   The 0.1% for civilian ships is just for annual maintenance.  The TCS 10%
is supposed to cover everything - personnel, bases, supplies etc.  Today,
the initial cost of the hardware is one of the smaller parts of of the
budget.

   Ships cost about 1 MCr per ton.  If you spend half the budget on 200 000
ton ships, you get about 100 with that TCr40.

   Ignore FSotSI - many of them break the rules regarding maximum armour,
which inflates the ship cost dramatically.  For example, the BH-15 (armour
120G) masses over 30 tonnes per kL.  Not too shabby considering superdense
is only 15 t/kL.  Almost all its TCr17 is based on that impossible hull.

UP Marines  TL 9-Ellat 9mm Assault Rifle

The Ellat is designed to provide forces with a high lethality relatively 
compact weapon of significant stopping power.  It fires caseless ammo and 
is NOT ETC for reliability purposes.  It is on the lower end of the tech 
spread for UP forces and is in the process of being replaced by the 7mm 
Advanced Rifle.  However it is still found in some units and is a 
favorite of militias and mercanaries despite its poor range.

Accurized 9mm Sniper Rifle TL 10
The only thing that this rifle has in common with the 9mm Assault rifle 
is that is uses the same round.  It has a different reciever, a different 
stock and barrell.  In addition it is accurized and optically sighted.  
It has a good range that should prove favorable to those sharpshooting PCs.

The three round burst is an aimed 3-rd burst.  Roll D3 for number of hits

As you can see this is a pretty good sniper rifle, I think that some of 
the things I have done are justified.  Any comments are welcome.

Brack Stinger Machinepistol 5.6mm
The Brack Stinger is a small caliber TL 11 ETC pistol capable of fully 
automatic fire.  It is more a mini sub machine gun more than a pistol.  
However the ETC round still packs a punch.  It is manufactured by Brack 
on Arizona Dawn primarily for military personnel.  It is a favorite of 
the various investigative branches of the Unified Sphere Government.

Perhaps the fluctuations in the SWs TLs are due to a variety of internal
causes.  I\'m not entirely sure I understand the feudal technocracy govt
but suppose it allows for a large amount of \'infighting\' among the
junior levels of the technocracy on each world.

This may only take the form of buying out each other\'s economic assets
on up to sabotage of various forms and possibly assassination and
warfare.  Suppose every so often these small manueverings among the
technocrats build to a particularly large crescendo that results in a
large loss of the economic/industrial infrastructure with a
corresponding drop in TL.

Furthermore perhaps this postulated internecine rivalry may be more
prevalent on some worlds (such as Sacnoth) than on others (Gram) which
causes more of an introspective world-view and prevents Sacnoth from
gaining political control of the Sword World governing body despite a
higher level of technological achievement.  In fact it isn\'t all that
difficult to imagine, given such a scenario, that Gram may very well
sponsor various acts of espionage and intrigue just to ensure their
position and also to see that Sacnoth doesn\'t come to power.

Just an idea that occurred to me while enjoying the "The Hans and David
Show."  :)

not strictly.  However the divergence is small.  For one the Bulk ratings 
in TW 2000 are lower than they would be in TNE. Also beware that you have 
the corrected weapons stats from the TNE book.  Most weapons in the first 
TNE book are significantly underated.  There is an Errata booklet.  Some 
TW 2000 weapons are actually TL 8 (HK G11, FN-FAL).  The idea about the 
TL 12? force invading the TL 7 worlds is an interesting one.  Thats a 
pretty big TL spread but perhaps the fact that the higher TL force has to 
bring its stuff with it will provide some balance.  There are plenty of 
TL 7 weapons that could take out a TL 12 Grav tank.  

While Im on the subject..does anyone have any knowledge of or experience 
with a platoon level traveller combat scenario.  I have considered trying 
to adapt some traveller weapons to the Last Battle system(Sands of War) 
but the speed of grav tanks turns them into helicopter!  

Oops!  I would like to apologize for revealing my war gaming roots up 
there.  Im curious.. how would your PCs be involved in this invasion.  
Getting caught in the middle somehow?  Well  I guess Ive answered your 
question.  Ill just leave you with this

TL 8  120 mm Smoothbore 50 Caliber Gun  APFSDSDU will give a Pen rating 
about 160-170

TL 11 120 mm Smoothbore ETC Gun  APFSDSCI Pen Rating over 250

It should be an interesting invasion...Id like to keep this discussion 
going.. Lets call this the premise

The PCs are on this TL 7 world and presently 2000+ km from their ship 
(which is in contested territory anyway) and they are racing someone to 
get something and get back to the ship (if it hasnt been captured or 
destroyed)  This works best if the PCs had little or no warning about the 
invasion.  Hell...maybe us TMLers (or whats left of us) can write a 
module for me to use next time Im Refereeing.  Oh well.

    MY 2 CENTS ON FEUDAL TECHNOCRACY & THE SWORD WORLDS
    ----
    
         Reading Hans\' and David\'s discussions on Sword Worlds government 
         prompted me to do some research. Here are my results.
    
    TECHNOCRACY:
    ----
     n.  Organisation  and management of a county\'s industrial resources by 
         technical experts for the good of the whole community; Hence 
         technocrat, advocate of this.
    
         (from the Concise Oxford Dictionary)
    
    FEUDAL TECHNOCRACY:
    ----
    
         Government by specific individuals for those who agree to be 
         ruled. Relationships are based on the performance of technical 
         activities which are mutually beneficial.
    
         (from TNE, p188).
    
         This could be lots of things. However, it sounds like the feudal 
         system we all know from history/hollywood/fantasy role playing 
         could fit in with this. 
    
    CONCLUSION (IMO, of course 8-))
    ----
    
         One possible interpretation of a Feudal technocracy comes from 
         combining what we understand by the terms Feudal and Technocracy. 
         
         The Feudal bit is in fact just like the Feudal system we know from 
         history, with for example a King and his vassal Nobles (Dukes, 
         Marquis, Counts, Barons, Knights) each of which has his/her own 
         vassals who comprise the remainder of the population (e.g. 
         Upperclass, Middleclass, and Lowerclass). And of course Nobles may 
         also have lesser ranking Nobles as vassals, depending on your 
         version of the Feudal system.
    
         Each Noble (including the King) has a staff (e.g. a council of 
         advisors supported by a  \'civil service\' or \'public service\') to 
         assist in the administration of his domains. When it comes to 
         managing the industry within a noble\'s domain, the staff are 
         technical experts in that relevant technologies. This last is the 
         \'technocracy\' bit. The ruling classes believe in this method of 
         managing industry, which makes them technocrats. By analogy, the 
         practice would probably extend to the management of fields other 
         than those traditionally thought of as comprising \'industry\'.
    
         To me the above description seems to fit the term \'Feudal 
         Technocracy\' better than David Johnsons *kieretsu* (sp?) model. 
         I don\'t know enough about *kieretsu* to say whether or not they 
         also fit the description. To me they sound like a better model for 
         Corporate governments.
    
    So, what do people think? Comments welcome.

Well, we all know the REAL reason for that is that Regina was made out to be such
an important world in the Marches\' affairs that having such a relatively low tech level
as 10 seemed a bit peculiar.  Even more, it\'s forward location and Tech-10 defenses
made it rather vulnerable to Zhodani attack, as 5FW players may know.

The solution was to tweak the TL upward slightly during the shift to MT.

I tend to regard the lower tech level as one of those "early Traveller inconsistencies",
like the major warship status of the Kinunir, and retroactively give it the
higher tech.

Otherwise, attribute the increase to the 5FW.  As a solution it has its problems,
but its the closest thing to a reasonable rationalization available.

Here\'s some additional material for *Shall Not Perish*, our TML Regency
sourcebook.

We\'ve already identified the following political blocs for the Regency:

Isolationists want to maintain the Quarantine.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Trin\'s Veil?
Expansionists want to move out into the Wilds.
 -Enjoys Instellarms backing.
Democrats seek to expand `democratic\' values.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Gazulin?
Aristocrats want to maintain the noble aristocracy.
 -Led by Duchess Elane of Mora
 -Possibly known as Muudashirists?
 -Enjoy much support among the House of Nobles
Tolerants favor a relaxation of psi prejudices.
 -Discretely supported by SuSAG.
Santanocheevists oppose any moves toward accommodation with the Zhodani.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Rhylanor?
 -Enjoys Instellarms backing.
Imperialists still hope to one day resurrect the Old Imperium.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Deneb?
 -Enjoys support from Tukera Lines.
Autnomists favor independence and a complete break from the Imperial past.

I\'d like to propose two additional blocs:

Interventionists want the Regency to play a stronger role in the affairs
  of individual worlds.
 -Enjoys support among most megacorps.
Sovereigntists oppose efforts to limit the sovereignty of individual worlds.

From what I recall of TNE\'s spiel on starships, you now have lots of 
crew because you can\'t trust your computers any more (or maybe that\'s 
the inference I drew). It makes things kind of difficult for 
retro-designing old rules starships -- I bought FFS over the weekend 
and tried to redesign the Fiery class GE using FFS. I *think* I\'m 
doing the design right but I still end up with a fast escort with less 
armour than the Gazelle and a measly 17 G-turns of thrust.

I think some tweaking of the engineering/maintenance numbers for crew 
sizes are in order. What I plan to do is compare the engineering crew
requirements in CT, TCS and MT and see how they look compared to 
TNE/FFS. If anyone\'s interested, I\'ll report back to the list.

You said it. I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1983 or so and I don\'t 
like the idea of using TNE rules for the Imperium. That said, I think 
the new rules are failry good (except for the personal damage rules, 
but I\'m working on that :-). As a result, I\'m working on a 
non-Imperial background at the moment which has been stalled somewhat 
due to getting FFS and discovering all those variant technologies ...

Pete,

I tried out you FFS Excel template for <2cm slug waepons.  While I liked it
ALOT there is one major error.  In the Design Evaluation Box the Burst Recoil
Calculation is not correct.  It only gives the Burst size not the recoil
calculation for a burst, which is what should be displayed there.

Please make the correction and email the TML and me when it is complete.

Thanks,

Kevin

I like it.  How\'s this?

In order to be appear in the digest, messages must contain one or more
codes (listed below) embedded in the Subject line, seperated from the
rest of the text by a non-alphabetic character. These codes are used by
the digester to create custom, filtered digests. For example, the
following would appear in digests filtered to include Classic Traveller
and 3rd Imperium messages:

        Subject: CT,IMP: How many Ancients can dance on the head of a pin?

_____RULESET______ ______ERA_______  ________GENERAL________ ____DESIGN SIGS____
CT  Classic Trav   IMP 3rd Imperium  ANN   Announcements     VDES Vehicle Design
MT  MegaTraveller  REB Rebellion           Releases, Errata  WDES Weapon Design

  Credit Squadron  AHIS Alternate          specific stuff
FFS Fire Fusion &       Histories
    Steel          GM   Scenarios

So folks, what do *you* think? Have I misplaced FFS? I think before we
add any more categories, we\'ll probably want to remove some. I think 21
categories is a good working maximum.

This is great work, Wes!  The reason I\'ve been pursuing this discussion was
to generate this sort of information.  All these folks arguing for different
rules isn\'t particularly interesting *or* useful.  IMHO, though, efforts

See!  This is useful information.  It adds to our understanding of the
Regency (or the Imperium) and is a great contribution to *Shall Not Perish*.

You mean there is another course besides endless rants about one\'s favorite
rules?  :-)  Once again, we\'ve managed to discover a background issue in
the morass of rules data that exists out there.

I do too.  Thanks, Wes, for actually *trying* to reconcile the divergent
rules information rather than merely rejecting out of hand the source that
you disagree with.  (of course, it still doesn\'t explain the *5FW* counters
for the Sword Worlds . . . .)

I\'m sorry if it has appeared acrimonious.  That certainly hasn\'t been my 
intention or impression.  And I really don\'t care *which* \'reality\' we
should accept.  I\'ve been trying to understand *why* we should accept either
one over the other.  IMHO, the ideal situation would be to reconcile *all*
official information.  I recognize that this may not be possible but I
think Wes has shown us that it\'s less impossible in this case then some
folks think.

Thanks to Wes I don\'t think we do *have* to start with this assumption.  If
we broaden the discussion beyond mere issues of rules to include the entire
campaign we recognize that *rules* are just a tool that can be used to
facilitate the larger endeavor of the entire campaign background.

See, here we are again.  What\'s the value of basing the decision merely
upon \'rules\' data like population and \'economics\'?  If we remember that
this is an entire role-playing campaign, we see there are other aspects
like politics and culture to help us explain these \'facts\'.

This may be but you have to admit it is based upon a \'rules-only\' point
of view.

    TCS maintenance costs include stuff like crew payrolls, military 
pensions, life support costs, berthing costs, bases, training schools, 
etc, etc, etc, that are paid for separately from "annual maintenance" 
when using the role-playing rules (CT Book 2, High Guard, MT, TNE) for 
ships.  

>In Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium (which I know is not the

"Shattered Ships" is utterly worthless as a source of ANY information,
official or unofficial.  It is so riddled with typos that EVEN GDW has
apologized for it; furthermore, the ships that aren\'t typographical 
errors violate the published rules six ways from Sunday.  Ignore it.

Hans & David:

    Yes.  I excuse this rate of progress in most of the Imperium by 
chalking it up to "Vilani Cultural Influence"; the Sword Worlds has no 
such excuse.  Rather the opposite:  technophile Terran cultural 
heritage, surrounded by enemies, constantly fighting wars.  You need a 
really good explanation why Sacnoth isn\'t TL21 already...  

Feudal Technocracy:

Hans:
>I realize that I assume that the word \'feudal\' in \'feudal 
>technocracy\' has a semantic content close to the normal definition of
>the word and is not a mere buzz-word.

    So do I. If anything, the "technocracy" part is the buzz-word.  
David, what you keep describing sounds like a plain old Corporate 
state (Gov 1) to me.  Frankly, a true "Feudal Technocracy" as 
described in the CT/MT/TNE definition is either extremely rare or 
describes the standard Vilani bureaucracy when it is still small 
enough to be functional.  Most non-Vilani Gov 5 worlds are probably 
just High-Tech Feudalisms, a la Piper\'s Gram, or the worlds of the 
Keltiad (Patricia McNeally).  

    To further muddy the issue, I have somewhere an issue of High 
Passage or JOTAS (I forget which), in which Mark Miller describes the 
Traveller government codes.  He said that these government codes DO 
NOT actually describe the whole government, but how it appears to 
outsiders (travellers) that must deal with it (i.e., what kind of 
government hassles your PCs get...).  Don\'t pin too much on a single 
UPP digit; set up your world\'s government anyway you like, and pick a 
UPP digit that approximates it.  There will be several to chose from.  
Is the U.S.  a representative democracy (gov 4) (based on government 
structure as outlined in the Constitution), a civil service 
bureaucracy (gov 8) (based on how the Federal government is supposed 
to work), an impersonal bureaucracy (gov 9) (based on how the Federal 
government usually works) or a charismatic oligarchy (gov C)(the 
country is really run by a relatively small coterie of elected and 
appointed officials who know each other, pat each other\'s backs, and 
get the job by looking good in 30-second sound bites)?  

    As with TechLevel definitions, GDW created endless fodder for 
arguments by mixing structural definitions (Representative Democracy, 
Tech level of a given artifact), with procedural or functional 
definitions (impersonal bureaucracy, production level of a world).  

When doing detailed looks at a world, I find that GURPS Space has 
better random-generation tables for government type than Traveller.

You are confusing "scientific method" and Occam\'s Razor.  OR is not 
"scientific method", it is simply a useful heuristic for sorting out 
multiple explanations.  It is not necessarily correct, either.

    Yep.  I can take a 1st ed.  AD&D character, monster or scenario 
and drop it *unchanged* into a 2nd ed.  AD&D campaign.  Any necessary 
changes are trivial enough to do in my head as I encounter them -- for 
the most part.  The only exceptions are dragons and the "d" critters 
- -- most of them went thru upscaling in combat abilities and hit dice, 
and scenarios involving them have to be rebalanced.
    To drop a CT/MT scenario into TNE, I have to redo the NPCs, the 
equipment, the animals, and the ships.  All that is left is the plot, 
and most of the MT stuff had really poor plots.  In some cases, the 
change from unlimited delta-V thrusters (or CT non-specific "maneuver 
drive") to limited delta-V reaction drives totally throws the plot out 
the window.  Let\'s not even mention that if you use the TNE "Virus" 
background, all the old 3rd Imperium background material is worse than 
useless.  TNE is an entirely NEW game with the Traveller name still 
attached...

    This may be true of, say, Ley sector, but the Spinward Marches 
faces one of the 3rd Imperium\'s two biggest enemies, and GDW material 
has repeatedly stated that the Spinward Marches, Deneb, and Corridor 
Fleets are *OVERSIZED* because of the Zhodani and Vargr threats.  
There is no greater threat besides the Solomani, and GDW material has 
depicted the 3I deploying more forces against the Zho/Vargr front than 
the Solomani Rim -- apparently, the Solomani were trounced during the 
Rim War...  <sarcasm intended>.

(Yeek!  This has been going on for a while)

First - I have a terrible feeling that _Ihatei of Doom_ will soon become
a trademark.  I wish I could think of clever things like that.   It could be
the second in a string of movies about a famous interstellar archaeologist
wandering the Spinward Marches.  In the first feature, Rhylanor James
and the Lost Oytrip, our hero discovers an ancient device designed to
communicate directly with Grandfather, only to have it stolen by the
perfidious Zhodani.  The second, Rhylanor James and the Ihatei of Doom
finds our hero saving the Domain of Deneb from a secret cult of Aslan
worshippers, with the help of a somewhat tubby Newt by the name of
Slick Round.  The final installment, Rhylanor Jones and the Last
Emperor finds our hero travelling to Usdiki to find the whereabouts of
Strephon\'s Cloning Machine, with the help of Dr. Quentin James (who is of
course secretly Rhylanor\'s father).  On the way, Rhylanor alienates an
entire army of Emperor worshippers, who do their best to stop our hero
out of a fear that mass production of Strephons will severely lower his
market value.

Sorry, I digress.  Long weekends are good for the soul! 

There are a few problems with Hans arguments.  The most obvious one
 (and the least satisfying as this is the source of all the hubbub) is this:

The Aslan conquered Glisten subsector, therefore the Aslan were capable
of conquering Glisten subsector.

This is all well and good, but how?  Hans Rancke points out that

>Aslan Ihatei do not have the strenght to stand against even a modes
>Imperial fleet  Split up and spread out ... they become even easier to deal
>with.

I was initially inclined to agree with this statement, but it is based on two
assumptions that may not be true:

1.  The Imperium had a modest fleet available to stop the Aslan
2.  The Aslan fleet was quantitatively and qualitatively weaker than
      the local Imperial forces.

Remember, at this point the Domain of Deneb (DD) has been cut off
from the Imperium, and has been fighting a war with large-scale
vargr invasions and pirate raids along the coreward and trailing borders.
This invasion was serious enough to allow the loss of Depot in Deneb
Sector, a major source of IN reserve forces and equipment.  These
raids began before the Ihatei invasion, and many forces from the
Trojan Reach area were likely drawn into the conflict coreward, leaving
frontier defenses in that traditionally quiet area severly weakened.

As the ease of spread of the Rebellion has shown, there was significant
discord in the Imperium.  It is possible that while the fleets of DD did
not rally to Lucan\'s or Dulinor\'s call, many individual waships might
have done so.  Others may have seen an opportunity to turn bandit,
join up with the Vilani or Antareans, or left the Imperium altogether.
Significant naval forces would be occupied with internal security duties,
further weakening frontier defenses.

As to the strength of the Ihatei, do not base your assumptions on human
or Imperial norms.  The Aslan are a warrior culture.  This means the Aslan
will devote significantly greater portions of the GAP (Gross Aslan Product)
to military equipment.  A warrior strives for the best weapons he can get,
so much of that money will go to ships.  I obviously have no good
historical precedents (not many starships in the middle ages) but I do
point out the relatively large size of military forces in the Germanies in
the 19th Century.  I would not be surprised if the Alsan could field a
military two to three times the size of a comparable sized human empire.

As to tech levels; don\'t assume that a TL12 or 13 society has any real
technological uniformity.  As I point out above, the Aslan are a militant
race.  The females are likely to be the scientific brains of the region,
but the funding for scientific research will ultimately be controlled
by the various (male) clan heads.  While the males will not concern
 themselves with financial details, they will expect a useful return on the
investment of clan funds.  Picture this scenario:  Two female Aslan
 scientists, Alwaro and Elwaro, go before the Clan\'s head, Kytharako,
advised by his cheif finance officer Lyhara, a female.

Alwaro:  Honored Sire, I seek funds for a project.
Kytharako (looking bored):  What is it now?  Another study of (hiss)
                                                           Leaf-eaters?
Alwaro (looking abashed):  Yes, Honored Sire.
Kytharako:  Such talk bores me!  Be gone from my presence!
                         (looking at Elwaro)  Another scientist?  I suppose you 
wish
                         to study snowflakes?
Elwaro:  Your words are true, Honored Sire.
Kytharako:  Whay should I give you more than I gave Alwaro?
Lyhara:  Honored Sire!  Do you not remember?  Elwaro presented you
                   with the new plasma focusing ring last year.  She has greatly
                   enhanced the power of our house!
Kytharako:  What has this to do with snowflakes?
Elwaro:  Noble Sir, the ways of science are strange.  By studying the
                  crystals of nature, perhaps I can learn to make better laser
                  mirrors, and increase the range of our clan\'s strength.
Kytharako:  Khhrrr, you are wiser than many would realize.  The money
                          is yours.

What I am trying to get at with this pathetic attempt at virtual roleplay is
that Alsan science will focus on weapons technology as a means of
fiscal survival.  I would image Aslan weapons technology might be 1 or
2 levels higher than their general tech level.  A TL12 squadron would be
an unequal challenge to a TL15 squadron, but three TL12 squadrons with
TL14 weapons would be easily an equal match to the TL15 squadron.

Supply Lines:  The Ihatei are coming to DD to settle and stay.  They are
probably expecting to live off the wealth of the new territory rather than
surviving off of a tenuous supply line.  Given the rapidity of their conquest
of the Trojan Reach, I am sure they managed to seize a respectable
industrial base; certainly enough to maintain a steady supply of
ammunition.

Food Supplies:  While Glisten might be able to raise bulk food supplies
readily enough, there are many trace elements (certain minerals and
vitamins) that do not lend themselves to hydroponic agriculture.  Since
I am writing this at TL8, I have no idea if a better method exists at TL15,
but the fragility of these closed ecosystems in Traveller leads me to
beleive this is still a problem.  The various laws of entropy make it
clear that a sealed system cannot sustain itself indefinitely.  Blockade
running might slow the collapse of the Glisten artificial ecosystem,
but that will end once the Aslan roll up the systems around Glisten.  With
no base to mount a releif effort from, the Imperium is not going to be
able to releive Glisten.  I think the Rebellion Sourcebook data strongly
infers that the DD was unable to mount effective counterattacks into
Ihatei territory until well after the loss of Glisten.  If a counterattack was
impossible (for whatever reason) a releif mission to beseiged Glisten
would be equally wasteful of time and effort.

In your last paragraph, you make your strongest point: the Ihatei have
to hold what they seize.  Frankly, I think that is not going to be possible
for the Aslan, due to their small population base.  Their only chance is
to win the hearts and minds of humans on occupied worlds, and the
occasional nuclear or biological attack on DD worlds is going to make
that very hard for the Ihatei.  Hmmm... maybe we need to start up a new
furor/discussion frenzy on human resistance actions in the occupied
territories.

Thank you for your response, Hans.  Despite the hammering above, I
though your arguments were very good.  In all honesty, I think the 
battle lines in GDW\'s Rebellion Sourcebook were mostly random, and
intended to add a threat of danger for some complacent old Spinward
Marches campaigns.  So please dont think I am picking on you; I am
always this obnoxious after a three-day weekend.

        I\'ve vaguely watched some of the debate on the takeover
of Glisten. I don\'t have my spinward marches map with me on
this trip so some of the following points may be off but bear
with me. The one crucial fault I find in most for the arguments
is this:
        STOP THINKING LIKE AN ASLAN MALE.
        THINK LIKE AN ASLAN FEMALE.
        I think it is easy enough to prove, as many have done, that
a military takeover of Glisten by an Ihatei fleet is laughable at
best. However if you think about it from a non-military point of
view it may not be so funny...

        Picture this: An Aslan male sits at home having breakfast
with his four wives and associated residents. The wind blows
through the veranda and a bird gurgles in a nearby cage. The third
setting of tea has been brewed, stewed, and served.
        Husband: "Wife #1. I am experiencing... the urge."
        Wife #1 quickly considers the impact on her schedule versus
the political advantage of having a daughter to marry off (Remember
the women are the medical technicians. Fertility treatment and
control? You bet!) Lightning quick whisker flicking and ear movements
pass between the four wives as the negotiating starts all unseen
by the husband who is inhaling the vapours of his tea. "My Lord."
Comments #1 verbally, It\'s been... so long."
        Husband: "Yes, but. I remember you speaking to me about
biological determinism. It is simply something I must do. The
Imperium will be a great enemy." He serenely takes a sip of tea.
        All the body-language fencing between the wives stops
instantly. "But they would outnumber us 50 to 1 and they have
a much more advanced fleet!" said Wife #4 who hadn\'t learned the
bloodymindedness of men yet.
        "Yes, it will be a great fight." He blows little bubbles in
his cooling tea. "Number four, you will arrange a meeting with
my brother\'s family, Number three, you will see to the maintenance
of the ships and thingies, Number two, um. Well, Number one, you
know about these things, see to it." He then goes back to
blowing bubbles in his tea. Well pleased with himself.

        Aslan males seldom think without acting. Whereas Aslan
females seldom act without thinking. In this sort of situation
the women are faced with the irremediable bloodymindedness of
the men and take what contingencies they can. Delays can be laid
but the inevitability of it all has to be catered for.
        The prime focus of a high-status woman (wife or sister)
is that of a corporate executive. The forces she has to bear are
not military. One family unit may not present much military or
economic power but given that the male Aslan "itch" for land is
not an isolated occurrence there are likely to be quite a few
wanting to seek their death amongst the rather superior Imperials.
For every male with enough ships and arms to even think of
getting to the Imperium there are at least two or more wives and
female relatives running the economic concerns that support the
unit.
        With the above scenario repeated several times over the women
are going to start getting together to pool their resources.
The Aslan have, on average, a lower tech level than the Imperium.
This means that their money is worth less, or, more importantly,
an Imperial credit goes further buying Aslan goods. Pushing
trade links into the Spinward marches, naturally heading toward
Glisten, trade centre of that area, is facilitated for the
Aslan because of this. Effectively exporting cheap Aslan labour
does create a trade deficit but remember this is the women\'s
equivalent of moving the economy onto a war footing. The deficit
can be padded by reinvesting the capital in high-tech Imperial
goods. These can be sold further back in Aslan territory and
much of the loss recuperated. It is a long trade link but here
the women are converting capital reserves into economic investment.
Considering the alternative is putting the money into military
hardware that is almost certainly going to get blown away it
is the better choice.
        So we have the Aslan pushing their goods in Glisten
sub-sector and creating an export market for Imperial goods.
An aid to this process are all the Aslan who have moved there
looking for land pre-rebellion quite peacefully which is
well documented. Don\'t just think of the Aslan males squatting
quite happily on their new sandboxes but again, for every
man there are several women conducting and setting up business.
        Ireland experienced something similar when it took in
400 of the Vietnamese boat people. Although they had no money
they came from a middle class background. In a country where
unemployment hits 21% in areas after five years not a single
one was not working. Most in businesses they had created
themselves
        If Imperials are reluctant to buy into the new Aslan trade
opportunities the recent settlers certainly will. And again,
many of the have settled quite peaceably and probably have
full citizen rights which enables them to act as a local agent
for the entrapenurial Aslan.
        The Imperium is unlikely to get too protectionist about
the trade either. With echoes of the rebellion bouncing around,
the markets are bound to be bouncy and domestic Imperial
investors cautious. People usually vote with their pockets and
if strong Aslan trade looks to bring chance for prosperity to
an otherwise depressed economy then it becomes a very attractive
option.
        So as Aslan trade influence waxes so too follows legal
and political influence. Generous donations to parties and
co-operation in paying taxes are likely to influence politicians
toward more favourable Aslan laws. More settlers? No problem.
Plenty of Aslan-Imperial cultural exchanges.
        More and more Aslan come. Invaders? No! Settlers! Lots
of nice press photos of local system defence navies welcoming
joint Aslan patrols of their system. With the uncertainties of
the Rebellion echoes doubtless self-defence is high on the mind
of many citizens with the pull back of components of the Imperial
fleet.
        The Alsan settle on previously uninhabited or unused areas
(check your charts, there\'s plenty). How do they support 
themselves? They just have to continue as the women started.
Running the economy. I\'ve just been through Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Singapore on the little (!) business trip. You don\'t need
natural resources to be incredibly prosperous!
        The Hivers may excel in manipulation but you have to
remember: three quarters of the Aslan population (the women)
consider economics and corporate management as the elite profession
of choice. ("What do you want to be when you grow up, little girl?"
"I want to be a corporate investment strategist!")
        The Scout service may have marked Glisten down is being
controlled my the Aslan but it is likely that this would have
been a surprise to Glisten itself!


        The limousine picks up the Aslan husband from the domestic
spaceport and brings him to his house via a long circutorious
route across his new lands. His four wives await him on the veranda.
        He smells and blows bubbles in his tea. "It isn\'t quite
what I expected."
        All the wives look concerned in unison. "Are you displeased
in any way, my lord", asks #3.
        He concentrates, takes a long sip, and then tries to remember
what he was saying. "Well, I just thought there would be lots of
guns and things."
        Wife #1 steps forward. "My lord, I could not have your serenity
disturbed as such. The Imperials are not worthy opponents. We merely
arranged a leveraged takeover of some local interests with clan
capital and ..."
        "Pah", interrupted the husband. "None of this woman\'s talk."
He inhales his tea once again, his eyes surveying the landscape.
All his. "I wonder if there is good hunting..."
        The bird in the nearby cage gurgles.

Okay, this might work (but I ain\'t gonna do it!).  There seems to be much room
for variation here though.  Isn\'t the \'42\' *RS* figure already within two
orders of magnitude of what *TCS* might suggest (~5000 \'capital\' ships)?
I would guess the 42-ship figure itself already has something like a plus
or minus one order of magnitude uncertainty.  This particular course might
lead to nothing more than a flame war over assumptions.

I guess I\'d like to see something along the lines of what you\'ve proposed

Fortunately, Cynthia makes a stab at this in a bit.

Yes, I agreed.  So one course is just to say "A ha!" and congratulate
ourselves on catching GDW with their pants down around their ankles.  
Another, possibly more interesting, course might consider that Norris is
an even more incredible strategic thinker than we\'ve thought and thus
he *conceeded* these regions to the *ihatei* knowing they could be 
assimilated and used later against the Vargr, or Lucan or whatever threat
Deneb (and later the Regency) might face.

Nope, I don\'t think this at all.  (I\'ve read *Art of War* too and I liked
it so much I there\'s a Dolphin mercenary named Sun-Tzu Sharkkiller in my
Earth Colonies campaign.  Nevertheless, I don\'t think USMC commanders

much of what we accept today about the actual conduct of warfare will
change through seven tech levels even if many of the underlying concepts
are timeless.

Good points all.  As far as I\'m concerned you\'ve made the point that Hans
was suggesting above.  Can we go on now to figure out what a \'typical\'
fleet and squadron in the Regency might look like?  Can we determine what
the total military (navy and army) forces of the Regency are?  This was
my intention way back when.

Yes, yes, I know.  I know the *Imperium* has this access.  What I was
questioning was your apparent claim that somehow we 20th Century Humans
(specifically you) had access to it as well.  I thought you had made this
comment in an effort to justify your claims about the \'reasonableness\'
of your *TCS* figures.  If I just misunderstood you let\'s save the

if you hear no more on this point it means *I* was mistaken!)  :-)

I kept asking this question because IMHO everyone was just saying we should
ignore the *5FW*/*RS* information merely because it contradicted *TCS*.
Being asked to accept that as a matter of faith was getting a little
tiring.

Good point.  I\'ll try to keep this in mind and stay \'temporally

Here it is again folks: the Great TCS Schism!  :-)  (Please, don\'t flame
me TCS-ites!  I really don\'t care whether there is or isn\'t a
breakdown.  It\'s enough to know there is no clear answer.)

At least we\'ve got a \'fictional\' religious group to insult now!  Curse
those blasted TCS-ites!  May they rot on the *5FW* board map!

But seriously, this has been some good work.  Thanks to everyone who
has contributed.  Maybe we can develop a consistent system:

This is in line with what Les said above.  Can we work out a series of
ship classes here based upon what he calls "real tactical employment"?

 Hypothesis:  Because TL10 represents what I call a "catalyst"

 then, once steel is discovered, the exponential curve becomes

 economical "maneuver" drive to get out to the asteroids, where it 
 becomes possible to discover the principles of jump drive.  Jump, 
 and the associated technologies, act as the next catalyst, and 
 those technologies build on each other, just like solid-state 
 computers built on vacuum-tube computers built on basic tube 
 electronics built on an understanding of electrical theory built 
 on observations of what happens when magnets interact with other 
 things...

Pathetically, I never got to go to Epcot Center.  I was terribly deprived
as a child.  I did get to visit Chester\'s Land of Desert Amusements here
in Tucson, which had fun, hands-on activities like the popular
"Lick the Hantavirus Rodent" exhibit.

In reality, I was using food as an over-simplified example.  What I was
trying to get at was that a perfect closed ecosystem does not exist, and
will not exist at TL15.  The problem might be due to trace elements missing
in food, or an inability to crack sufficient oxygen from ice asteroids in
the Glisten Belt; the cause is basically irrelevant.  The effect is that Glisten
might be militarily powerful, but still be unable to withstand a long-term
siege.  Entropy is just as powerful in  TL15 Glisten as it is in a TL8
Biosphere.   Think of it as punishment for living in a hollowed-out rock
instead of a proper world with an atmosphere.

However, the Aeroponics would be a very good idea for a Glisten type
closed ecology.  It would be far less unpleasant than Algae extracts, and
require less lifting power than a comparable hydroponics plant.   This
would make it more viable for starships as well as orbital habitats and
similar closed environments.   It would also be a nice scenic diversion,
almost a park-like setting for the tunnel and dome dwellers of Glisten. 

 And far more romantic than a walk past the algae vats.

PS - The Gestapo did have more stylish uniforms than the BATF.

None of the above reflects the views of my employers.  We dont have
stylish uniforms either.

I realize this is like talking about evolution to a creationist but when I
played *5FW* there were situations in which naval forces would enter a
system, land ground forces, and then have to face an opposing naval force
that subsequently jumped in system.  In the course of the battle the first
naval force could be forced to withdraw without retrieveing its ground
forces (BTW, this happened to the Sword Worlds at Lanth in the *official*
campaign).  The ground forces left behind had no \'aerospace\' support from
their orbital elements.  If I were the ground commander in such a situation
I\'d have liked to have had some way of dealing with that enemy fleet now
in orbit besides surrendering or hiding in a cave somewhere, thus, I\'d
have landed attached aerospace forces of some sort.  (And this ignores
the fact that should I have managed to defeat that orbital force I might then
need some sort of air or sea lift capability to continue the planetary campaign
if my own naval forces have already jumped out system!)

You\'re forcing me into "apples and oranges" again!  Why would I force the
Imperium to maintain *RS* protocol and then allow the Sword Worlds to
use *TCS*?  That\'s not only unfair, it\'s stupid!  I could have just as
easily used the *RS* methodology for Glisten subsector and come up with
a number for the 214th(?) Fleet that was similarly absurd to you TCS-ites!

>     So let\'s ask another question:  What makes you think *RS* qualifies

Let\'s talk English 101.  *FYI*, when someone places a word in quotation
marks (like I did with \'strategic\' and \'tactical\' *every time I used them*)
it\'s an indication that they are using the word in a non-standard way and that
it\'s meaning is suggested by the context of the text in which it appears.
Thus, I used \'strategic\' and \'tactical\' as easy ways of distiguishing
between the \'big picture\', sector-level focus of *5FW* and *RS* and the
\'little picture\', ship-design focus of *HG* and *TCS*.

BTW, why the need to get so \'acrimonious\'?

>     If you ignore TL, then EVERYTHING you say about the military situation
> in Trav is meaningless drivel...

Again, why the need to get so angry and insulting?  As far as this issue
is concerned, I find it more than a little irritating to have accepted a
point in one discussion for the sake of argument (in this case, Hans\'s
point about the Sword Worlds that tech level differences of one or two 
*aren\'t* that important) only to get *flamed* for it by someone else in
another discussion!  If you\'d been following the discussion on Sword
Worlds technology, Steve, you\'d have known that *I* think differences
of just *one* tech level *are* vitally important.

Here\'s some \'reality\' for you.  There were several assault transport 
squadrons in *5FW* and these were exactly how large troop forces were moved
around.

Now, I\'m not still trying to argue *5FW*/*RS* vs. *HG*/*TCS* (I\'ve already
accepted Cynthia\'s and others\' points) but I do hope you\'ll see that
there is no inherent value in calling for one source to be ignored *merely*
because it contradicts other sources!

[Sorry about this heavy quoting folks.  I tried to cut as much as I could

I\'ll try to write it simply.

You say your escort *Pansy* can beat my ten SDBs at Regina.

You say this has nothing to do with the differences between *5FW* and *TCS*.

You admit that my problem is the *number* of my ships rather than their 
  individual capability.

I say:  THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ONLY TEN (10) SDBS AT REGINA IS A *DIRECT*
RESULT OF THE *5FW* RULES!  As we\'ve already seen, if *TCS* rules were
used for Regina there\'d be *a lot* more than just 10 SDBs there!  So,
please quit wasting everyone\'s bandwidth!

And prior to occupying the Border Worlds the Imperial 214th Fleet
destroyed the Sacnoth Fleet at Sting!  (BTW, there are *three* hi-pop
worlds in the SW.  The Gram Fleet was defeated by the Imperial 213th
Fleet and the Narsil Fleet was defeated by the Darrians.)

>     As to "harassing", what harassment could those offer to a battleship?

Uh, suicide run around the \'high guard\' during refueling?  Uh, forcing
some naval elements to remain in system to continue to protect ground
forces from SDB bombardment?  (Unless, of course, the ground forces had
attached aerospace elements.)

>     No.  We have people who like to do EXPERIMENTS!  Try it some time.

If you\'ll recall it was my \'lazy behind experiment\' that came up with
the \'42-ship\' Sword Worlds fleet that started this discussion.  No one
has yet stated that this *5FW*/*RS* focus is inconsistent with itself,
merely that it doesn\'t jive with *HG*/*TCS* and some folks think the
latter makes more sense.

So again, why the need to get angry and insulting?

There you go again.  Maybe studying a little more grammar and punctuation

No, again, if you\'d been paying attention you\'d know that I\'ve accepted
this.  What I\'ve asked is that given this arbitrary decision can we
develop a reasonable rationale to explain it?  This has been a common
endeavor of much of the background discussion we\'ve had here on the TML.

No.  Again you are making assumptions about my knowledge of military

Fine.  So based upon your wondersous experience with *TCS*, what is the
structure of Regency naval forces in TNE?  How many squadrons are there,
what is their composition and deployment?  These are the sorts of ends
this discussion was directed towards.

ARMOR RATINGS and the IMPERIAL NAVY SHIP-OF-THE-LINE

I just gained enlightenment on another shift in the rules which
should interest battle fleet naval architects.  This one is related
to starship armor factors on very large ships.

In _Brilliant Lances_, there is a design for a 1000-ton TL15 
Imperial Navy DE, the _Chrysanthemum_-class.  It is a close structure
with armor factor 62, which comes out to 2.214 cm of bonded super-
dense armor at a volume cost of about 0.62 % of the ship.  I decided
to scale this percentage for a 500000 d-ton sphere, to see what sort
of armor we might expect to see on a _Tigress_-size battleship.
(It\'s not quite fair, since the DE loses some mass to configuration,
but that isn\'t really vital for this argument.)

It turns out that at 0.62 % of ship volume, the _Tigress_-size ship
can carry some 25.087 cm of bonded superdense armor, for an armor
rating of 702.  This is 2.25x the amount of armor needed to stop a
standard TL15 150MJ beam laser dead.

If one is willing to armor an expensive battleship a little better 
than a DE, at 1.77 % of ship volume you can have 71.5 cm of bonded
superdense armor plating, and an armor rating of 2002.  This is just
sufficient to stop a TL15 500 kT nuclear detonation x-ray laser dead.

Note that either value is sufficient to stop any of the "pea-shooter"
class PAWS in _Brilliant Lances_.

These armor ratings are very definitely not ridiculous.  If anything,
they may turn out to be conservative.

It looks to me like the lighter weapons are really only useful for 
anti-missile fire or to try and scrub the communications and sensory
antennae off a ship.  The only other thing I can think of doing with
them is to try to saturate a big ship\'s anti-missile defenses and get
a fusion weapon right up next to it.  So I suppose the *really* big 
ships like the _Tigress_-types will depend more on what we\'d currently
consider very heavy weapons to do any real damage to the enemy line.
I have no idea what sort of power the TNE equivalent to the meson-T
delivers on target, but it is probably massive.  The big ships will
need to depend on heavy bays to back up the main gun, though, since
the turrets and "pea-shooter" spinal mounts on escorts won\'t do much 
good.  I\'m not sure if the 100-ton bays can cut it; I haven\'t checked.

As for the _Chrysanthemum_ in a fleet action, well, I guess it really
is a cheap "tin can".  I suppose it\'s supposed to be an SDB hunter
and commerce cutter.

This is a good analysis.  To tell you the truth, I like the feel of being
able to armour my dreadnaughts in proper Fisher fashion.

As for tactics, would you not want to (1) engage with (relatively) light
armourment to detroy the antennas for the meson screen (I am under the
impression that cust out the meson defence) then (2) engange with the meson
armed big ships.

I have been thinking of some lighter meson armed ship ideas as well, but that
needs some development.

Thats fine.  If there is no magic "torpedo" for frying big ships, torpedo
boats do not serve a lot of purpose.

Oh yuck.  The MT 400 d-ton SDB had a specific gravity of about 2.0 laden,
so it wasn\'t a problem before.  You could give up some of the hydrogen fuel
storage and flood those fuel tanks with water, er, "unrefined fuel".  It
would take 29 G-turns worth to bring the SDB\'s specific gravity to just
over 1.0.  That would add about 725 tonnes of mass to the ship.  Since the
SDB has 112 G-turns, I suppose you could pay the price. 

Seems to me that you\'d be better served adding armor to the hull and getting
some added value out of the mass -- besides, superdense armor is more compact.
But maybe there\'d be some value in "crash surfacing" with this design.

This is a good point but one might wonder then why Sacnoth has not made

Maybe, but it\'s tough to fight a prolonged war this way against an opponent
who can produce his own goods internallly.  Essentially though, this is what
I\'ve proposed for Gram - it\'s been receiving aid from the Zhodani.

rules.  I hope that this post will show one end of the limit 
of Meson gun design.  I have read in the GDW-Beta archives of 
a meson SMG design which I would love to see posted.

This extreme is an attempt to build the Star Wars Death Star 
main weapon.  Some time ago I retrieved the following from 
rec.arts.sf.science, posted by Erik Max Francis, 
max@alcyone.darkside.com, in response to a question there:

Now for Earth, from the sci.astro faq, we have:

(1) G =   6.673e-11 N m^2/kg^2 (7e-11)
(2) M =   5.974e24 kg
(3) R =   6.371e6  m

Which, unless I have screwed up here, is about 2.25e32 j, or 
2.25e26 Mj

So if we want to build a death star, we need a weapon (a 
Meson Gun would seem ideal) which will feed that much energy 
into the core of a planet in a reasonably short period of 
time -- say about 30 minutes.

Lets assume that we can design the weapon with an ROF of 100.

This gives us a discharge energy of 2.26e24 Mj.  Working at 
TL 14 and selecting a tunnel length of 250 m (to give a short 
range of 10 hexes, the other calculations fall out:

3a Effective Tunnel Length 300m
3b Tunnel Volume           5.62e24 m^3
3c Cross Sectional Area    2.25e22 (a diameter of 8e7 km !!)
3d Tunnel Mass             3.37e24
3e Tunnel Price            5.63e23 MCr

I won\'t bore you with damage values, which run from 7e12 
down.

Well, so much for the Meson armed death star -- back to the 
drawing board, Darth.

It\'s a different secret than the official one for several reasons; one, that
I don\'t like the whole Grandfather business at all, and, two, that even if I
did like it most of my players know it too, and that tends to ruin their
sense of wonder. And IMO the secret of The Ancients ought to be full of
wonder.

I have, however, tried to make my version fit all the clues left behind. My
Ancients left the universe in much the same state than the GDW Ancients did,
they just went about it differently. So some of he things I work out should
be useful even to those who want to stick with Grandfather and the kids.

At the moment I\'m trying to work out how an Ancient set of coyns looks. We 
know the names of the coyns in the set of 36 used by modern Droyne, and 
we\'ve been told what some of them looks like. The Ancient set consisted of
38 coyns and some of the odern coyns (Aslan, Hiver, K\'kree) cannot be part 
of the set.

I\'ve listed the facts I\'ve used (numbered) and the assumptions I\'ve made
(lettered). If anyone can come up with facts I have missed or have some 
good ideas, please let me know.

1) Coyn sets found in Ancient sites range in size from 6 to 38 pieces.
   [_Imperial Encyclopedia_ p. 21].

a) The lesser sets found are subset of one standard 38-coyn set, not 
   alternate sets.

b) The Ancient coyn set is identical to a pre-Ancient coyn set used by 
   pre-Ancient Droyne in prediction ceremonies.

2) Grandfather introduced the coyns as a tool of casting to a number of
   Chirper worlds around -75,000. [_Droyne_ pp. 6 and 45]. On some worlds
   the Chirpers gained the ability to caste, on others it didn\'t work
   (Vanejen, described in _Research Station Gamma_, is an example of the
   latter).

3) Grandfather modified the coyns on later visits and introduced the Aslan,
   Hiver and K\'kree coyns (at least). [_Secret of The Ancients_ p 32].

b) The Ancient coyn set consisted of six groups of six plus two specials.
   The six castes was one group. Void, Soil, Air, Gas, Water, and Fire was
   aother (these were the Droyne concept of elements: Earth (Soil), Water,
   Fire, Good (breahable) Air (Air), Bad (unbreathable) Air (Gas), and the
   absence of any of the other five (Void). 18 of the other coyns mentioned
   in the modern set were also in the Ancient set, though any grouping of 
   them into sixes lacks common themes (the third group, Darkness, Cold,
   Noise, Signal, Heat, and Light are pairs of opposites  -  but so are
   Genesis & Death and Defeat & Achievement from another of the groups).
   Anyway, the abovementioned plus Aspiration, Sacrifice, Beast, Mercenary,
   Voyages, Justice, Change, and Phoenix (can\'t really be a phoenix, of
   course; it must be a legendary Droyne beast with the same characteristics 
   as the phoenix) were also part of the Ancient set. Humaniti, Vargr, 
   Aslan, Hiver, and K\'kree was not. Remains the Droyne, which was one of
   the two special coyns. The remaining special coyn disappeared from the
   set when Grandfather re-introduced it, presumably because it was no
   longer relevant to the new Droyne. I suggest Eskaloyt, the Droyne
   homeworld itself. We now have 30+2 coyns. We lack one group of six, all
   of them coyns that were subsequently removed. One solution supplies not
   only a group with a common theme, but also the explanation of why they
   became redundant: Six prey animals native to Eskaloyt. Used by primitive
   Droyne to perform hunt magic.

So I suggest that the Ancient coyn set consisted of:

Worker     Warrior      Drone       Technician   Sport    Leader
Void       Soil         Air         Gas          Water    Fire
Darkness   Cold         Noise       Signal       Heat     Light
Genesis    Aspiration   Sacrifice   Defeat       Death    Achievement
Beast      Mercenary    Voyages     Justice      Chance   Phoenix
Hissayt    Emissyob     Ayvaylk     Bestoy       Nebbay   Hayyarn
Droyne     Eskaloyt

But I can\'t just hand a list like that to my players. I\'d much rather give
them a description of what the coyns look like. And that\'s where I need some
help. I\'ve come up wih a description of most of the coyns. Some I like, some
I\'m not thrilled about, and some I downright dislike, but can\'t come up with
a good alternative to. So if you think of something you think is better, let
me know.

c) The modern coyns that duplicates Ancient coyns duplicates their design 
   too.

4) The first Grandfather set (in -75,000) consisted of 38 coyns and included
   one with a human and one with a flame [RSG pp. 4 and 38].

d) The set of six fake coyns menioned on page 13 of _Twilight\'s Peak_ are
   copies of real coyns (albeit modern coyns); they depict an aslan leader,
   a flame, a human, a cloud, an ice crystal, and a sine wave.

e) The depictions of the six castes on page 64 of TP and pp. 12-13 of
   _Droyne_ are taken from the coyn depictions of those castes.

f) The coyn shown on the back of _Droyne_ (two flames and the lower third
   is obsured by a droyne) is not a variant of the coyn wih the single
   flame.

Now to match coyns to descriptions. The first six are easy, thanks to
assumption e):

A massive droyne with digging tools     Worker
A tall droyne with sword and shield     Warrior
A flying droyne with a bottle[1]        Drone           
A medium droyne with tools and detector Technician
A slender droyne with ball and bat[2]   Sport
A big-headed droyne with a spear[3]     Leader

[1] A feeding bottle, perhaps?
[2] My best guess. It looks like a giant spoon and an irregular disc. I
    suggest that it\'s for _feldoss_, a popular droyne game that I just
    made up ;-) 
[3] A ceremonial spear, of course. See later.

The rest are a bit more tricky. The ones we know about, apart from the
Aslan and the human, was a flame, an ice crystal, a cloud, a sine wave,
and two flames. The flame and the ice crystal can be Fire and Cold. The 
cloud could be Air, Gas, or Water (or any of the philosophical concepts, 
of course; a cloud could be the symbol of hope to an agrarian community
("I do so hope it will rain")). The sine wave I eventually assigned to
Signal, which gave me a jagged zig-zag line for it\'s opposite, Noise.

Now, going down the list here are the symbols I came up with for each coyn:

Void        Nothing engraved. A blank disc.
Soil        A massive cliff. 
Air         A white cloud (ie. the outline of a cloud).
Gas         A black cloud (ie. a filled-in outline of a cloud).
Water       A foam-flecked wave.
Fire        A flame.

(Except for the Void and the Fire I\'m pretty dissatisfied with these, but
they are the best I can come up with. Any suggestions?)

Darkness    Two different sized cresents (The moons of Eskaloyt)
Light       A sun.
Cold        An ice crystal.
Heat        A campfire (Two flames arising from a tree log). 
Signal      A sine wave.
Noise       A zig-zag line.

Voyages     A sailing ship.
Justice     A ceremonial spear[4].
Chance      Six sticks in a random pattern[5].
Beast       A ferocious six-limbed carnivore in mid-jump[6].
Mercenary   A big-headed droyne with arms and armour[7].
Phoenix     A six-limbed animal surrounded by flames.

[4] Used by primitive Droyne leaders to dispatch those judged guilty or
    supurfluous to the community (This must have been before krinaytsyu
    became common; when it did, the Leader kept the spear as his symbol
    of authority).
[5] The Droyne use such sticks to generate random numbers according to 
    the pattern they fall in; coyn drawing is not, of course, considered 
    a random procedure since theyare assumed to predict future events.
[6] The _Stomfelk_, the most feared predator on Eskaloyt.
[7] I reasoned that mercenaries must be krinaytsoyni, and the most common
    krinaytsoyni are leaders. Hence a leader with weapons for a mercenary.

Genesis     An egg.
Death       A droyne skull.
Achievement A brimful cup.
Defeat      An empty, tipped-over cup.
Hope        Six stars in a random pattern[8].
Sacrifice   A droyne sitting with eyes closed[9].


[8] Well, what can I say? If I could come up with good symbols for Air
    and Gas, I\'d use the (rain) cloud for hope. As it is I\'m falling back
    on a Droyne constellation symbolising hope.
[9] A droyne commiting krinaytsyui, of course.

The Hissayt, Emissyob, Ayvaylk, Bestoy, Nebbay, and Hayyarm are various
six-limbed herbivores and omnivores once important to Droyne hunters. I
had descriptions of them all worked out, but those notes seems to have
dissappeared.

Finally the two special coyns:

Droyne     A group of three droyne, a leader, a drone, and a worker[10].
Eskaloyt   Some strange irregular outlines (diferent on the two sides)[11].

[10] In other words, an alpha-male, a female, and a beta-male.
[11] Polar projections of Eskaloyt. Since they don\'t have the lattitude
     and longitude lines common to human map projections they are unlikely 
     to be identified as such by humans. 

Well, that\'s what I\'ve got so far. Any comments?

         David Johnson was looking for some suggestions about the governent
         of the Regency - here\'s my take on it:

         ----%<----

         Government Structure of the Regency

         The Regency has three actual branches of government: Legislative,
         Judicial, Executive; and the Military.  The legislative branch
         consists of two chambers, the Moot and the Senate, which share
         power.  The judicial branch consists of a series of appeals courts
         of varying power, and executive branch consists of the various
         Governors.  The military is not a separate branch, but is not
         beholden to the other branches.  The Regent is the highest level
         of authority for each branch.

         At the top of this hierarchy, wielding the highest power of the
         executive, legislative, judicial and military branches, is the
         Regent.  The office is held for life and passed on to the
         designated heir.  The Regent appoints candidates to all executive
         and judical posts on the sector and subsector levels, subject to
         confirmation by the Senate.  The armed forces are controlled
         directly by the Regent with no oversight by the Senate or the
         Moot.  The titles held by the Regent include, but are not limited
         to:  Lord Regent of the Third Imperium, Archduke of Deneb,
         President of the Senate, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Navy,
         and Supreme Marshall of the Imperial Army.

         The Moot is the senior chamber of the legislative branch, composed
         of the peers of baronial rank and higher in the realm who serve as
         long as they maintain their title (usually for life, although
         abdications do occur).  There is approximately one noble per
         planet in the Regency, and as such, the Moot tends to favor the
         rights of lower population worlds.  The members of the Moot are
         predominantly human.  Although the Moot does vote to confirm the
         succession to the Regency, this power is mitigated by the fact
         that they can only vote for, not against a new Regent.
         Politically the Moot tends to be dominated by the Aristocratic,
         Imperiallist and Sovreignist blocks.

         The Senate is technically the junior chamber of the legislature,
         although in fact it is more active politcally than the Moot.
         Senators are popularly elected representatives of Senatorial
         Districts of approximately 1 billion sophonts.  Being based on
         population, these districts can vary in size from a portion of a
         world to a dozen or more entire worlds.  Because of this, the
         Senate tends to favor the high population worlds, where some 96%
         of the Regency\'s population live.  In addition, the Senate is a
         more cosmopolitan body, with 29 Llelywolly Senators from Junidy,
         11 Gl\'lu Senators from Kibushish, one Ebokin Senator from Yebab,
         several Aslan Senators from the spinward regions, and even one
         Chirper Senator from Vanejeen.  Senators serve 10 year terms, and
         may be elected to no more than 3 terms in succession.  The Senate
         has the power to confirm or reject all appointments to the
         Judicial and Executive branches made by the Regent. Unsuprisingly,
         the Senate tends to hold Democratic/Interventionist views.

         The judicial branch exists to decide when (or if) Regency law has
         been violated, and consisists of a series of courts at various
         levels that have the ability to review the decisions of courts at
         lower levels. The lowest level are the Regency District Courts,
         corresponding to the Senatorial Districts.  These courts are the
         base of Regency law, and spend much of their time hearing local
         cases dealing with conflicts between Regency law and the local
         laws.  Decisions of the District Courts may be appealed to the
         Subsector Appeals Court, which can in turn lead to an appeal to
         the Regent\'s Court on Mora.  The final avenue of appeal is
         directly to the Regent, who can reverse the decision of any
         Regency Court.  Justices of the District Courts are elected from
         the district.  Justices of the Appeals and Regent\'s courts are
         appointed by the Regent for indefinite terms, but are subject to
         co[C[Cnfirmation by the Senate.  They may be removed from office by
         the Regent, or by a vote of the Senate.

         The executive branch consists of the Subsector Governors appointed
         by the Regent and confirmed by the Senate, and Planetary Governors
         appointed by the Senate.  It\'s purpose is to ensure that the will
         of the Senate and of the Regent is carried out.  Thus the
         Governors are responsible for collection of taxes, implementation
         of policy and enforcement of Regency law.

         The military in the Regency is not an actual branch of the
         government, but it funtions in many was as such.  The head of the
         military is the Regent, and under him are the Admirals and
         Marshals of the Realm.  Each Sub-Sector has a Fleet admiral
         assigned to it, and each high population world has a Reserve
         Admiral in charge of the reserve fleet, and a General in charge of
         the planet\'s ground forces.  The military, through the person of
         the Regent (undoubtedly with advice from the Senate and the Moot),
         has the right to decide when to wage war or make peace.  It is
         effectively outside the the control of the Senate, the Moot and
         the Governors on most matters.  The military is, however, bound to
         uphold Regency law, and thus must obey decisions of the judiciary.

         ----%<----

         I have tried to incorporate a few important ideas in this outline,
         most importantly the divisions of power between the Senate and the
         Moot, and their different focuses (i.e., the population based
         Senate v. the planet based Moot), the conflict between
         Sovreignists and Interventionists (to use David Johnson\'s terms),
         and the role of the Regent as the font of all political power. 

         One idea that I would particularly like comment on is the
         Senatorial District.  It would seem odd to me to allow , say,
         Menorb and Pixie the same level of representation given their
         different populations.  So I have combined Pixie into one district
         with Menorb, Yres and Boughene.  This gives a fairly compact
         district of 3,060,900,800 (New Era figures) which is further
         divided into three subdistricts, each of which elect one Senator.
         This seems to be more in tune with a democratic body than the
         arbitrary sector/subsector designation, as it can recognize
         clusters of worlds as sharing common circumstances without giving
         them seperate governments.  The main problem with this is the
         exact nature of the districts (they are a pain to figure out), but
         that seems ok to me too..it lets things stay flexible as
         populations grow and shift.  And just imagine the fights in the
         Senate of over redistricting!  I can see a whole adventure based
         on census taking, and whether the population of Wochiers has
         really passed 1 billion.  How\'s that for cerebral adventuring?  

         Also, this concept gives the minor races more of a chance to have
         representation in the Senate.  Imagine a Gl\'lu delegation
         wandering around in insulated suits full of ammonia - how\'s that
         to remind your players that they aren\'t in Kansas anymore.



         So there you go guys...  go to town!  I\'m off to the beach for a

This is fine but you have to recognize the `inter-relatedness\' of the
feudal system.  The vassals provide local resources (knights, taxes, etc.)
to the lord in return for coordinated services (military protection).  This
is what distiguishes a feudal system from a simple aristocracy where their
is no inter-relatedness.

Yes, this is technocracy but it has no system of inter-relatedness.  If the
technocrats are merely advisors appointed by the ruler then they serve at
her whim.  This is not a feudal system.

I don\'t think so.  Rather, it is merely a technocracy (such as exists in
many contemporary nations) within an aristocratic system.

I hope I\'ve distinguished the difference between corporate government and
a feudal technocracy in my prior post in response to Hans.  One key is the
matter of scale.  A corporate government only works on a relatively small
scale (hence the lower government digit) while a feudal technocracy works
on a larger scale.  This difference of scale results in siginficant
differences between the two types.

There is a more elegant solution to this inconsistency and Hans has already
suggested the answer.  If you think of tech level as being tied to economic
growth in an environment where each technological breakthrough need not
be `rediscovered\' but merely `grown into\' (in an economic sense) it\'s
actually quite simple.

If you think of the economic growth of Regina from it\'s settlement in 75
you would expect the situation to go something like this: early economic
activity would be highly exploitative with natural resources being extracted
for export and most manufactured goods imported; eventually, indigineous
industry would appear but even this would be limted at first.  Regina
quickly became a hub for further exploration and development in the Marches
so it\'s economy would move from exploitation of natural resources to one
of trading services where manufactured goods from the Core were shipped
out to developing worlds and resources from these worlds were shipped back
to the Core (probably just Deneb sector).  This `trading post\' economy
would continue for quite some time (similar to, say, St. Louis in the
exploitation of the American West - it had been settled a *long* time and
had quite a large population before any automobiles were manufactured there).
Eventually, as `civilization\' moved into the Marches, a `full\' economy would
emerge on Regina with a significant industrial base.  This would lead to
rather significant increases in economic output and thus tech level.

I hope I made this clearer in my last response to Hans.  It seems to me
that what\'s happening (and not particularly with you, Cynthia, nor Hans) is
that many folks are confusing feudalism with aristocracy.  Feudalism is based
upon mutual obligations between the lord and his vassals.  An aristocracy
has no such requirement.  In medieval feudal aristocracies these obligations
were centered around military affairs.  In a feudal technocracy the
technocracy `buzz-word\' shifts the focus from military affairs to industrial
activities (including service industries) but the system of mutual obligations
remains.  It is these mutual obligations that distinguish a feudal technocracy
from a corporate government.

Right, but we\'re not talking about knowledge here, we\'re talking about
the ability to *produce* a certain level of technology, i.e. industry.
(Tech level 15 *knowledge* ought to be available from your local library
data terminal on most Imperial worlds.)  For the ability to *produce* a
certain level of technology to `go away\' you\'d have to have a *severe*
economic down turn like the Long Night or the Viral Collapse.

As one of those people and a long-time space advocate I have to admit that
*no* space project has been cancelled or postponed due to budgetary
constraints.  Budget decisions represent a redirection of *priorities*,
not a lack of economic resources.  In the same period that space technology
has been virtually stagnant (c1970 to the present) there have been 
*tremendous* advances in computer, medical and biological technologies.
(Of course these fields haven\'t had the `advantage\' of almost complete
government subsidy that the space program has had.)

> Money funds research. Research advances Technology. Therefore, economic

Yes, but it won\'t affect the ability to produce technology in the Imperium
where the higher tech knowledge already exists.  Neither does it explain
*reductions* in the ability to produce a certain level of technology.

A better example (Oh no, I\'m making Hans\'s point!) might be to compare Detroit
to the Japanese automakers.  Because Nissan, Toyota and Honda were able to
produce higher quality automobiles more efficiently there was nearly a
*de facto* tech level drop in the US.  Nevertheless, even this example 
only concerns a particular industry which might explain a drop in one
of the *WBH* tech level specialty areas.  An overall tech level drop would
have to affect *several* sectors at the same time.  IMHO, that could only
be caused by a major economic catastrophe.

This is a good point on which to redirect this discussion back to the
original purpose.  How do we determine naval and army (ground/air/sea)
force composition and organization for the Regency?  I don\'t care whether
we use *5FW*/*RS* protocols or *HG*/*TCS*/*POT* protocols.  I made an
initial suggestion for the Sword Worlds using my best guess at *5FW*/*RS*
protocols which got the shorts of a lot of TCS-ites in knots.  Fine.
So will some of those TCS-ites *please* make an alternate suggestion?
I\'d do it myself but I don\'t have *TCS* or *POT*.

Here are some questions to consider:

How are Regency naval and army forces organized at the subsector and sector
level?

What is the overall composition of Regency military forces?

What is the compostion of a `typical\' Regency naval squadron and a `typical\'
army battalion/regiment/division/corps/whatever-you-think-the-`basic\'-unit-
ought-to-be?

Who are the major military figures in the Regency?

I don\'t either.  I\'d really rather see folks suggestion *alternatives* to
any point *anyone* makes rather than merely trying to rip holes in a position
they disagree with.  The latter course is neither interesting *nor* useful.

My ccr2 worth on the Vargr and Aslan incursions.

As for the Vargr at high pop worlds like Junidy, consider this: nuclear
blackmail.  A corsair band shows up, threatens to drop some nukes unless
the locals surrender, so the locals do.  This wouldn\'t work in the `old\'
days because the Imperial Navy would show up, blockade the world, and
chase the Vargr down in the Extents if they fled.  (Remember, the Vargr
aren\'t suicidal, just greedy, ruthless and opportunistic.)  In the chaos of
the Rebellion such an Imperial response became much less likely so some Vargr
were emboldened.

As for the *ihatei*, clearly these Aslan came to dominate high pop worlds
like Aki and Glisten through economic and diplomatic means as well as military
means.  It\'s one thing to say Glisten would fight when they\'re assured of
eventual relief from the interior; it\'s quite another when that relief is
much less certain - especially when reliance upon that relief from the
interior has been ingrained for centuries.  (Texans like to think of
ourselves as tough cookies but if a Latin American army showed up at
Houston one day and it was unclear when, if ever, the US Army was going
to help out, I wouldn\'t put it past the Mayor to quitely succomb to `these
wonderful benefactors from the South\'.)

As for the eventual reincorporation of *ihatei*-occupied worlds into the
Regency I suspect many of those Aslan settlers would have no problem
becoming Domain citizens once the Domain Navy *did* show up and it was
certainly a lot simpler (and less bloody) to accept this *fait accompli*
than to try to eject the *ihatei* squatters.

For the same reason Entrope isn\'t TL 15: Economic problems at a level of

So? With imported tech you may be able to win a short war against someone
who can produce what you have to import even if you can\'t win a long one. 
With no imports you\'d lose even a short war. So the imports makes sense
in any case.

Unfortunately I haven\'t seen it. Could you mail me a copy if you still have

of various features of feudal, corporate, and feudal tech societies.

But why do you assume that the TL digit of an UWP has anything to do with
_ability_ to produce? To me it makes just as much sense that the TL is
the level of technology actually produced, regardless of capability. That\'s
why I think an economic downturn can affect TL; when it\'s no longer 
profitable to build something the society stops doing it, even though they
still could if they had to  -  and we have a TL decline.

That brings us to a dead end. I think it could be caused by less than 
catastrophic declines in economic affairs, but then, I\'m profoundly ignorant 
of economics. It\'s mostly SF to me ;-). So by now we\'re down to different
articles of faith. So I\'m signing off the \'technological cycles\' debate
unless someone else interjects new blood. You don\'t think they\'re possible, 
I do. End of story. I\'d much rather get on with finding out just how a
feudal technocracy actually works.

If nobles of baronial rank are to be included there will be *several* per
planet.  Barons are responsible for planetary regions and cities.  Marquises
rule at the planetary level.

I like this idea but it has to be rectified with the above issue.

A good point but one might hope that by the 57th(?) Century folks might have
come to realize that a person of one ethnic group might still be able to
represent the interests of other groups (as opposed to the unfortunately
commonly held view to the contrary in contemporary America).

This suggests the aristocracy has given up its traditional judicial role
held under the Imperium.  This is a major change that represents a major
loss of power for the nobility.  Is there a rationale for this loss?

>          The executive branch consists of the Subsector Governors appointed

This represents another loss of power for the nobility.  One wonders just
what the nobility does in the Regency?  And more importantly, how they came
to lose such influence?

This is a good idea but I\'m not sure how to rectify it with the inclusion
of barons in the Moot.  (And I don\'t see how barons could be excluded either.)
Maybe there is a way to deal with this by adjusting the population levels
for the Senate districts.  How many Senators are there in the Regency at one
per billion population?  Lowering this number to one per half billion (or
less) would increase the number of Senators (and correspondingly the 
influence of hi-pop worlds) with repsect to the barons of the Moot.

Electing Senators at-large in any of these mulit-billion districts would
further enhance the influence of hi-pop worlds.  In your example one might
expect Pixie, Yres and Boughene (and possibly part of Menorb) to be included
as one sub-district (and thereby give the smaller worlds a chance at some
representation).  On the other hand, three at-large Senators would all be
likely to come from Menorb.

This is some great work.  I might suggest as a modification leaving the
judicial function in the hands of the nobility.  (They\'ve already been
weakened by the appearance of the Senate abd it doesn\'t really affect the
split in the power structure you\'ve outlined.)  Furthermore, the Regent\'s
Governors (subsector and world) are also a big threat to the nobles.  They
also seem to be in direct conflict.  (What\'s the relationship between the
Duke of Vincennes and the Subsector Governor or the Marquise of Efate and
the Planetary Governor?)  Maybe these Regency executives only exist in fiefs
where the noble patents have been vacated, either through death without
issue or through the dislocations resulting from the Rebellion and the Viral
Assault?  Possibly, for example, there is no longer a Marquis of Glisten
but rather an *ihatei* Governor (I\'d prefer `Resident\' for worlds to
distinguish them from a subsector Governor) who was appointed by the Regent
when Glisten came back `into the fold\'.

Again, Wes, great work!

The trick is, they\'re related. You can\'t simply nhave TL15 knowledge. You
also have to have references to TL14, TL13, TL12, etc to build upon. All of
this takes up space, whther physical or virtual. To use modern equipmetn
analogies, if a world can\'t afford, or decides to redirect its prioroites,
it may have less "disk space" than is required to hold all the Imperial
TL15 data. So sure, a few places may act as repositories of information,
but it may not be very available, and the world will still have (generally)
access to only TL x.

And why do we redirect those priorites? Because we can\'t afford to explore

It\'s the very concept.  I accept that some technological variations might
be tied to economic fluctuations but I have great difficulty with the idea
that overall technological capability (what TL measures) is going to vary
much unless there are *huge* fluctuations in the economy, i.e. the Long
Night or Viral Collapse.

The examples you cited are fine but they only refer to individual firms.
For the techno-economic cycles to occur they have to affect entire
industries.  A particular Gram jump drive manufacturer might get a `jump\'
on a particular Sacnoth jump drive manufacturer but for the techno-
economics theory to hold *several* Gram industries (ship building, medical
tech, communications, robotics, *et al*) would have to `get a jump\' on
similar industries on Sacnoth.  This really seems to be a stretch of the
imagination to me.  I\'ll admit it\'s possible but it\'s not very darn likely.

Yes, I\'m aware of *WBH* but while this might explain a particular circumstance
it doesn\'t explain the subsector-wide situation.  Gram might have higher
space tech than Sacnoth but by the same reasoning Narsil might have higher
space tech than both.  This just leads to ever-more-insidious possibilities.

Wait a minute!  This is the same `reasoning\' UFO-nuts use to make claims
about ET visitors.  It is the burden of any claimant to provide evidence
of their claim.  Merely suggesting that your argument can\'t be disproved does
not make your point!

Certainly they could have but I believe they were copying Piper wholeheartedly
and were merely `updating\' to fit the general attitudes of their own time.
They certainly intended for folks to `play\' Sword Worlders and so didn\'t
want them to be too repressive (like the Solomani which were never featured
as anything but `bad guys\' until *Solomani and Aslan*).

We seem to go back and forth on this.  I accept that technological
achievement (TL) is tied to economic capability.  What I don\'t accept
is that fluctuations in the economy (relatively minor in the overall scheme
of things) are reflected in *fluctuations* in technological achievement
(a relatively major event).  Again, why the need to propose this in the
absence of *any* evidence of a downward technological `fluctuation\'?

I don\'t know but nothing about this slow rate of advancement calls out for
your mysterious techno-economic cycles.  I might suggest that this problem
arises from our own limited contemporary experience in which GDW has tied
technological achievement of several tech levels (TL ~5-8) to a chronological
period that only spans a single lifetime.

Not true.  Gorram Shipyards was an industrial fief, not a land fief.  There
was also banking fief.  A feudal technocracy works similar to the feudal
aristocracy we are more familiar with.  The difference is that the medieval
feudal arstocracy was tied to land fiefs as you describe while a feudal
technocracy is tied to industrial and service fiefs that exist in `modern\'
society.

We all know these obligations were often ignored and `legitmacy\' often
fell to the most charismatic or otherwise powerful liege lord.  This is
the whole basis of the Arturian legend.  Uther Pendragon lost his kingship
as his vassals rebelled or refused to support him.  Arthur regained that
kingship by uniting those vassals in the Fellowship of the Round Table.

No.  A feudal technocracy is a system of government where the owners of
industrial production give their support in exchange for economic opportunity
or `protection\'.  A medieval baron pledged his knights and a portion of
his economic wealth to his liege.  In return, the liege-holder (ulitmately a
king) agreed to use the combined strength of all of his barons to protect
each fiefdom from assault or other danger (like internal strife).  Similarly,
in a feudal technocracy like the *kieritsu*, the owners of industrial
production pledge their economic support (i.e. cooperation) to a central
authority which cooridinates the efforts of various industrial and service
sectors towards the perceived common good, namely profits.  This is a 
voluntary arrangement where the individual corporate entities may or may not
choose to continue to cooperate.  Just as feudal barons might choose to
no longer support their liege and often did just that when they perceived
an advantage for themselves.

> Who owns the corporation in a corporate government? Who owns it in a feudal
> technocracy? What\'s the difference?

In a corporate government there are a single group of shareholders as
represented by the corporate board of directors.  This board acts in essence
as a single entity.  In a feudal technocracy there are several *different*
and independent groups of shareholders (i.e. the `barons\') who each act
as *separate* and distinct entities.

> I think it would be useful to agree on the equivalences of various terms
> in the three systems we\'re talking about.

I don\'t think it\'s appropriate at all to discuss a corporate model
here.  A corporate government is a specialized form of an autocracy.  In
a corporate model there is, in theory at least, no imput at all from those
participating in the system.  You just do what the boss says or you\'re fired.
I\'ll focus my comments on the comparison of feudal aristocracy and feudal
technocracy and try to point out where the corporate model isn\'t relevant
as appropriate.

This isn\'t correct.  In a feudal aristocracy the king does not `own\' the
land.  Rather the king supplies `coordinated services\' (i.e. joint military
protection) in return for `cooperation\' from his vassals (i.e. local military
forces and tax revenue).

No, the king is the equivalent of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
The Chairman provides `coordinated activites\', i.e. `running the company\'
in return for the financial support of the shareholders, i.e. `cooperation\'.
A true feudal technocracy is much more complicated than this because it
concerns *all* of the shareholders of *all* of the industrial and service
entities acting in the entire marketplace.  In this sense, if there is a
`king\' he has gained monopoly control of the entire economic sytem.  This
is why US industry fears the Japanese *kieritsu* so much.  They are concerned
that their coordinated activity gives Japanese industry a competitive
advantage.

No, the dividends received by shareholders in a feudal technocracy are

aristocracy.

No, *shareholders* are the equivalent of *fiefholders*.  Each block of 
shareholders, represented by their boards of directors, is equivalent to
the fiefholders of a feudal aristocracy.  Each block of shares is a fief.

There\'s no conflict here!  Trask could have sold only a portion of Traskon.
He owned that entire block of shares of the total economic sector of Gram.
Remember, it was partially because of the greater economic power he gained
from the acquisition of Traskon that *Duke* Angus eventually became *King*
Angus.  Traskon Barony increased Angus\'s share of the total economic output
(GPP?) of Gram and thereby led to him becoming king by virtue of his control
of the largest portion of the entire economy.

Right.  And in a feudal technocracy, `dukes\' are merely those who control
large blocks of industrial production - shareholders.

Yes, he provides coordinated control of the combined assets of shareholders
(like the pension funds) in an effort to produce profits and hence dividends
or increased stock value for the shareholders.  This is just like the feudal
aristocratic model where the king provides coordinated control of the 
combined resources of fiefholders in an effort to produce security.

*Au contraire*!  The pension funds and other shareholders provide *cash*
to the chairman just as aristocratic vassals provided military forces and
tax revenue to the king.

It is *exactly* the same.

We\'re saying the same thing.  If the technocratic baron chooses to place
his support in the hands of a different lord he transfers not only economic
power but political power as well.

> If he owns them he can dictate who gets to buy them.

He doesn\'t own them just as an aristocratic king didn\'t own his vassals\'
fiefs.  If Uther Pendragon had `owned\' the fief of Cornwall he could have
just `removed\' the Duke and taken his wife Igrayne.  Instead he was forced
to lay seige to Cornwall when the Duke no longer chose to support him.

Okay, okay.  It\'s King Anders then.

No, thereby forfeiting his right to protection from the aristocratic king
or profits from the technocratic king.

It is in a feudal technocracy.  Again, it\'s why US industry fears the 
Japanese.

He is if he really enjoys a full tech level advantage.  (Of course, you
must give up your `cycles\' to accept this point.)

Yes, he might except that the TL 12 vassals on Sacnoth might choose to
no longer support Anders (since their TL 12 industry ought to be better
able to compete *against* Anders\'s TL 11 holdings on Gram) and so they
would strive for their own competitive advantage and thus greater politcal
power.  Eventually, some Sacnoth vassal of Anders\'s would rise to a
position of dominance on Sacnoth as King Thorvald or whomever.

No, if Anders of placing people in control then they enjoy their control
*at his whim*.  This is not a feudal arrangement at all.  It is autocracy
*and* similar *then* to the corporate model.
 
> Again you assume that Harald and his ancestors would want to conquer Gram

No, I\'m just assuming that a little military action might make the economic
conquest of Gram a little simpler.  Think of Japan with a full tech level
advantage, a nuclear arsenal and the ability to project global military force.
There\'d be no `voluntary\' import restrictions on Japanese autos in the US in
that scenario!

 But your own paragraph on tactics indicates part of their role:
Overloading point-defenses and scrubbing surface features.  The standard
missile in TNE is capable of a lot of mayhem, and will scrub surface
bits off of _any_ ship.  The more ships (of any size) you\'ve got firing
these things at the enemy, the less capable the enemy will be to
respond.
 The levels of armor described in Steven M Bonneville\'s
(bonnevil@mermaid.micro.umn.edu) post almost, BUT NOT QUITE, return
us to the days of MT, when anything without a meson gun was harmless
above a certain level.  In TNE, with all of a ship\'s surface features,
it is quite possible to get a mission kill without penetrating the
armor.  Nothing is completely invulnerable.

 Perhaps an irregular dirt clod or a symbolic plant growing from the
ground for Soil.  The few Coyn faces we\'ve seen suggest an extremely
symbolic style, IMHO.  The more this can be followed, the more mystified
your players will be.

 Or perhaps just a paw-print.  Save the ferocious carnivore for the
most dangerous (in your opinion) of the major races that replaced
the animals.

 Or a mountain pinnacle with a tiny figure, and a chasm into which a

 Since the major races eventually replaced these, they may also represent
specific forms of danger, or specific concerns that the Droyne must
watch for.  Grandfather replaced the original Coyns with new ones that
had different pictures but meant much the same things.  Perhaps the
Droyne once had to worry about the overbearing habits of a particular
omnivore.  This animal had a ever-expanding territorial sense, and was
forever competing with others of its kind to expand that individual
territory.  The Coyn depicting this beast was replaced by the Humaniti
Coyn (or perhaps the Aslan Coyn) as Grandfather\'s warning.
 Looked at in this way, the Major Race Coyns might also represent
personalities: the Militant (K\'Kree), the Meddler (Hivers), the
Curious (Humaniti), the Random (Vargr), and the Migrator (Aslan).
These may still have been represented by animals from Eskayloyt who
embodied these (or other) personality arch-types.

empty weight: .571 kg , loaded weight: .702 kg
ruggedized to melee standards
bulk: 1  , cost (empty): Cr256

ROF: SA  ,  damage: 4 ,  pen: nil  ,  range: 80

options:
 laser sight .5kg,  Cr300 (range 240m)
 optic sight .1kg,  Cr150 (range increases to 92)
 tunable combuster +Cr187

comments:

Small arm Tl16 focal arrays are effectively free & miniscule. The above
4mm FA is sufficient to give no attenuation out to extreme range for a
pistol (including optic sights) in standard atmosphere. It has a nominal
volume of 0.008 cc and a cost of Cr0.004

Of the options, the laser sight is nice but nearly doubles the empty
weight, the optic sight doesn\'t give enough extra performance to be
expecially worth it, and any of the options add enough to the cost to
take the weapon out of the cheap "Saturday Night Special" market for
which it\'s intended.

I would say quite conservative.  At TL 14 you can construct a 9.5m bay laser
(there is no point in building much larger) feeding 6000 Mj (only 4* a standard
barbette laser) which will throw a penetration over 2000 out to 80 hex
range.  That will not a lot of Damage after pen (about 15 points), but it
is not zero.

Note also there are some trade-offs we can do to get a small ship with a 
laser that has 2000+ pen at very close ranges.

True for the smallest weapons, but is it such a bad idea? Also, you are

I think what we may have here is a classic race between armour and armament.
I am not sure how to develop any sort of "optimal" solution for a given
tech level, I guess its the sort of thing that would have to "come out in the
wash" in a given campaign.

While you would depend on the "big gun" spinal mounts to deliver ship-killing
critical hits, I think correct use of Light units (properly designed
for doing damage against armoured targets) would be an important tactical 
consideration.

I presume BL is built around small combatants (a sort of Mayday on Steroids?)

I wonder how much artistic unity they have -- and why some Droyne are
crazy enough to make some sets out of uranium!  Good luck, Hans!

The concept for an Ancient-era coyn for Eskayloyt is interesting, but
it should probably be expressed as "Homeworld", since presumably at
that point it had not yet been lost.  Also, the Ancient period lasted 
long enough that it\'s possible that the "Human" and "Vargr" coyns were 
added before the Final War; humans, at least, were fairly well 
integrated into quite a number of Ancient societies -- about half, if 
the figures for the 3rd Imperium discovering evidence for some 90+ human 
minor races and charting some 200+ Ancient sites are accurate.  The old 
symbolic implications of those coyns were probably fairly interesting....

I\'m not quite sure about the "native beast" replacements, but I don\'t have
a better suggestion.  "Innocent bystander" races from the Ancient period
that got wiped out by collateral fire in the Final War?  No, that\'s not
it either.

Note that all six species represented on the coyns are important powers.
Yaskoydray didn\'t accidentally pick a "minor" race that didn\'t make it.
And of those six, five developed hyperdrive independently.  It makes one
wonder if he didn\'t use something like the Zhodani core artifact to peer
into the future.  Or tamper with _TRS Pathfinder_ so that the Aslan got 
jump drive just before they could blow themselves into oblivion.  Either
way, it suggests that all this "Six Races" nonsense is literally a self-
fulfilling prophecy.

>Voyages         A sailing ship.

Or a STL starship -- the pre-Ancient Droyne did have tech-10 without jump
drive for thousands of years before the Ancient period; they even had a
couple of interstellar colonies.  


Also, note some interesting coyn relationships from the table:

Genesis | Aspiration | Sacrifice | Defeat | Death | Achievement
  The life cycle.  Observe the droyne lesson; one is born, dreams,
  makes sacrifices (for the common good?), meets eventual defeat,
  then death, but *then* attains true achievement.  Defeat and death
  are not the victor.  Is this droyne philosophy peeking out?  Or
  even a droyne concept of the after-life?  Interesting.

Darkness | Cold | Noise | Signal | Heat | Light
  A progressively more positive line of "energy" or "positive entropy".
  Note how the pairs work.  The "Void--Fire" series also may work like
  this.

Beast | Mercenary | Voyages | Justice | Chance | Phoenix
  Think of this like the "energy" sextet.  It would then pair from
  closest to most extreme as:  Voyages/Justice, Merc/Chance, Beast/Phoenix.

Well, as I mentioned there might be a possibility of using them in very
large numbers as nuclear missile launchers, and try for a direct hit on
the battleship.  Somehow, I doubt even factor 2000 armor would take well
to having a nuke go off next to it.  Of course, the target solution is
fairly simple once the missiles get that close, so you\'d have to fire 
a *lot* of them and concentrate your fire on one enemy target.

Of course, there\'s a counter-tactic.  For MCr12.5, you can overwhelm a
single standard 150MJ laser turret using standard power, with ten missiles.
It has an ROF of 10 in a thirty minute round, maximum.  (This assumes,
unlike normal space combat, that all shots are effective and destroy one
incoming missile in the zero hex.)  But using FF&S, it is possible to 
build a rapid-fire laser with an ROF of 800 (two shots every five seconds)
which would probably nicely solve the problem.  I don\'t know what the
power requirements of such an anti-missile laser would be.  Arming the
little fleet escorts with "pea-shooter" meson weapons would probably be 
a better bet if you\'re trying for serious internal damage.

    'body' => 'I tried to post this last week, but it was a no-go.  Since there\'s still some
discussion re:  feudal technocracies, I thought I\'d try again.  Here goes:

                            FEUDAL TECHNOCRACY

     I have been following the Sword Worlds debate with only mild
interest, but a line in one of the posts struck my attention. 
What follows is entirely tangential to that discussion, however.

     One of the participants in the SW thread said, concerning
feudal technocracies, that he or she thought there should be
"something feudal" about them.  That set me to thinking about
what a feudal technocracy is, at least in Traveller terms.

     First, some purely hypothetical statistics as background. 
How often do feudal technocracies occur within the Imperium?  The
number of worlds in the Third Imperium is given as 11,000:  I
don\'t know where that came from, but I will use it here.  That
means, using the world generation routine given in the rules --


             THIRD IMPERIUM FEUDAL TECHNOCRACIES BY POPULATION

Pop  Freq  Feud Tech:   %Occur     #Occur
 0    2.7%     DR 12     .001         11
 1    5.5%     DR 11     .003         33     
 2    8.3%     DR 10     .007         77
 3   11.1%     DR 9      .012        132 
 4   13.9%     DR 8      .019        209

 9    5.5%     DR 3      .003         33     
 A    2.7%     DR 2      .001         11

               TOTAL =   .112       1227

Pop:           UWP Population Code
Freq:          Population code frequency within Imperium
Feud Tech:     Die roll required for UWP gov code 5
%Occur:        Frequency of UWP gov 5 worlds @ pop code
#Occur:        Number of UWP gov 5 worlds @ pop code     

Thus, approximately one-tenth of the worlds within the Imperium
may be feudal technocracies.  A majority of these are small
communities under one million in population, though a very few
high-pop feudal technocracies exist.  Interestingly, UWP Gov Code
5 may be the mode of the government type data set -- that is, the
most frequently occuring value.  I haven\'t done the math on that,
but it is intuitive given the results above.
     The above chart implies that feudal technocracies are a
common category of government throughout the Imperium.  It can be
inferred from the above that a feudal technocratic government is
best suited to an intermediate-sized community, for reasons which
may or may not be clear.  I would argue that feudal arrangements,
by defining the relationships among the individual members of a
society, grow too complicated above a certain population size or
density.

     It may be helpful, at this point, to elaborate upon what a
feudal technocracy is.  In a discussion of the concept of
feudalism, a historian named Morris Bishop said that it is "one
of those words that have taken on so many extended and figurative
meanings that the original [one] has been obscured."  Bishop goes
on to say that feudalism "is a total organization of society,"
specifying the status of individuals within its purview, and
establishing implicit and explicit responsibilities among them. 
     In medieval times, this feudalism centered around land,
agriculture, and military service.  In terms of the Third
Imperium, a feudal technocracy may focus on very different
elements.

     The central idea of a feudal society, in any event, is the
codification of the complex web of social, legal, and economic
interrelationships among its members.  The term "government" is
therefore somewhat of a misnomer.  (I suspect that many a feudal
technocracy may appear to be a balkanized world to the untrained
observer.)  UWP Gov Code 5 refers to feudal *societies*.

     If we accept the definition of a "technocracy" to be "a
government by an elite controlling some aspect of the application
of the society\'s technology", then the worlds to which we assign
UWP Gov Code 5 must meet two criteria.  
     First, the legal rights, responsibilities, and roles of
individuals must be defined in terms of their socioeconomic
status (thus, "feudal").  
     Second, an elite class which controls some critical
technology must make up a privileged, ruling class (ergo,
"technocracy").
     This critical technology may be military technology -- the
lance, armor, and warhorse of the medieval knight, for example --
but does not have to be.  Nor is it necessarily a single
technology:  access to more advanced technical knowledge and
resources may be sufficient.
     However, the existence of a critical technology helps to
differentiate a feudal technocracy from an oligarchy.  It occurs
to me as well that, whereas oligarchies may tend to be relatively
homogeneous ("monolithic" in World Builder\'s Handbook terms),
feudal technocracies admit more possibility for conflict, as the
elites may sometimes work at cross-purposes -- though within the
social bounds established by the feudal arrangement.

     How many different types of social systems can be posited
which fit the first half of this definition?  I could think of
five; there are probably more.

1.  Traditional Feudalism:  An elite, usually military, ruling
over a producing "proletariat" of farmers and laborers.  A
separate intellectual class may exist, as well as a small
mercantile class.

2.  Corporate Feudalism:  A complex arrangement consisting of
individual economic organizations within which "employees" and
"managers" have certain specified tasks.  "Owners" in one form or
another may serve as the ruling class, but the managerial elite
will, by virtue of their expertise, have considerable power.  The
corporations themselves are bound by a web of economic alliances
and buyer-seller arrangements.

3.  Contract Feudalism:  Within this type of society, economic
relations between individuals are defined in terms of "contracts"
which may be implicit or tacit but which, by certain behaviors,
all parties acknowledge to be legally binding.

4.  Arcological Feudalism:  The society is arranged as one or
more arcologies; that is, self-contained and economically self-
sufficient communities.  As with corporate feudalism, an elite
managerial class of technical experts holds considerable power
within the society.

5.  Caste Feudalism:  All economic roles are hereditary and
confer a greater or lesser degree of social status upon the
possessor.  The highest caste controls the society\'s critical
technologies.

     It is difficult, perhaps, to imagine a society wherein the
critical technology is not military.  It might help, therefore,
to do some brainstorming on this issue.  Some of the following
may be reasonable:

1.   MEDICAL - The society\'s elite are the doctors who can extend
or deny life-saving treatment, including anagathics.  Rather than
the Hippocratic Oath, their credo is to advance the interests of
society as a whole by their efforts.

2.  TRANSPORT - In a world where communities are isolated and not
self-sufficient, those who control transport technology exert a
great deal of influence upon other members of the society.

3.  COMPUTER - In a complex economy, those who control the
computers and telecommunications technology that enable it to run
smoothly hold considerable power to direct resources as they see
fit.  In some places, highly advanced AI-like "expert systems"
may be the elite.  ("The Computer is your friend.")

4.  ENERGY - By controlling an industrial society\'s sources of
energy, those who build, maintain, and direct a world\'s power
grid can gain considerable political influence and economic
advantage.

5.  ENVIRONMENT - In a hostile environment, the engineers who
control and maintain life support systems are of critical
importance, and may be able to extract political power from their
position.  Alternately, the toxin-removing, food-preparing
"shugilii" of the Vilani may fall into this category.

     The above elements can be combined to provide the referee
with some inspiration when obliged to detail a UWP Gov Code 5
world.  For example, a Pre-stellar world with caste feudalism and
medical technocracy may require the genetic typing of children to
determine their "proper" function in society.  The highest caste
may be the Eugenes, who manipulate the breeding of the lower
castes to achieve their ends.  Lower castes accept the system
with the belief that adherence to "Wedding Protocols" will result
in higher caste offspring, and thereby advancement.
     Travellers to this planet will be struck by its unusual
social structure.  Alien, indeed.  Possibilities for patrons and
adventures exist here, as well.  The Eugenes may wish to improve
the breeding stock by gaining some high-quality off-world genetic
material, and commission the PCs to find suitable donors.  A rich
but low-caste trader might desire the PCs to use their High
Stellar computer expertise to falsify her son\'s genetic record so
that he will be declared suitable for high caste upon reaching
maturity.

     The point of this admittedly lengthy post is that worlds in
a science fiction adventure should be to some degree alien or at
least exotic, and should serve as gateways to adventures that are
not just "cowboys with rayguns".  Or Star Vikings with assault
rifles.  
     Feudal technocracies, to continue the metaphor, do not have
to be barons with blasters.  

     All the above is IMHO, of course.  I know there are some
holes in my argument.  Any comments, gripes, protestations,
modifications, exhortations, helpful hints, complaints, or
accusations will be greatly appreciated.

    Possibly. In my case I used aristocratic titles (Baron, Knight 
    etc) as terms to identify with Feudal systems from our own earthly 
    history that I am most familiar with, and which other people on 
    the TML might be more familiar with. Obviously I could have been 
    clearer by describing the importance of the mutual obligations 
    between vassals and his/her liege lord.
    
    <Feudalism is based upon mutual obligations between the lord and 
    <his vassals.  An aristocracy has no such requirement.  In 
    <medieval feudal aristocracies these obligations were centered 
    <around military affairs.  
    
    I Agree so far.
    
    <In a feudal technocracy the technocracy `buzz-word\' shifts the

    I agree it can do. I don\'t agree it automatically does. The \'buzz 
    word\' as it has been termed describes an approach to managing 
    industrial resources (see the definition I posted earlier). In 
    Traveller, technology and the industrial capacity for producing 
    high technology weapons is crucial to the ability to wage war. So 
    I think you can still have a high tech militarily centred Feudal 
    system which is technocratic in nature. From what I\'ve seen and 
    heard the Battletech universe is a lot like this. Maybe areas 
    engaged in large scale TCS campaigns are like this too 8-).

    To me your kieretsu description seems like it -also- fits the 
    description of a Corporate Government. You see it as a good 
    example of a Feudal Technocracy. Given Traveller\'s way of 
    classifying governments, there is no reason why it can\'t be both. 
    The classification you choose obviously would show what aspects of 
    the government are most apparent to, or which have most effect on, 
    Travellers. Which ties in with Mark Miller\'s article on government 
    types way back in JTAS or wherever ( I think it was JTAS ).
    
    By the way, William White recently posted an interesting article 
    on what Feudal means to the XTML that is worth checking out too. I 
    thought it had some nice ideas for variations on the traditional 
    Feudal model.
    
    And since we have gotten on to discussing government types, does 
    anyone else have an example of how they have interpreted a 
    Traveller government type they\'d like to post? I\'d certainly be 
    interested. After all, it gets a bit boring if all your Feudal 
    Technocracies and Corporate Governments start to look the same.

     Want to stepup to the world of multi-media? Then this is for you!!!
Dear Correspondants:

        As with last week\'s Junque Mail, I\'m here again pushing
some obsolete multi-media hardware/software. OOPS! I don\'t mean
the Hardware or Software is obsolete, only that I am dis-investing 
in multi-media [the big buzz-word in computers today]. I have
decided that since I use the CD/ROM drive in my system less than 
once a month, it is a luxery I can no longer afford. OH! One more
thing, this unit is an IBM PC compatible unit. It WILL work with
Apple MacIntosh also, but you\'de have to buy drivers etc for it,
as the ones I have that I\'m throwing in are for the IBM.
        So, here we go again. 
        FOR SALE ---- ONE CD/ROM DRIVE with Accessories.
The drive itself is an external model, so if you have a small 
computer with zero internal drive bays left, it won\'t matter. The
DM-5024 is manufactured by the Texel Corporation, a Japaneese firm
with local offices in Santa Clara, California. It comes in a 
9.5 x 10 x 2.125 inch white plastic enclosure with its own internal
power supply, and an internal audio amplifier for CDs with sound
clips on them.
        The Interface card and the software are manufactured by 
Trantor Systems, Inc of Freemont, Ca. Both the Drive unit and the 
SCSI interface card have very extensive documentation. The software
documentation is contained on the disks themselves in the form
of read.me and help files. 
        The accessories pack for this excellent value includes:
the CD caddy [of course!] a pair of stereo headphones for the
drive\'s audio amplifier, all the connecting cables and hardware
necessary to install this unit in an IBM PC {I don\'t know about
the MacIntosh ... but both the drive and SCSI interface ARE com-
patible with Apple.} and TEN CDs complete with any auxilliary
software necessary to run them, jewel cases for each CD, and of 
course the documentation on these CDs.
        The CDs are: 1] PUBLISH IT! (version 2.0) by Timeworks 
software. This CD includes a built in graphics tool box, 69 fonts,
a thosand clip art images, 85 ready to use sample layouts and a
complete word processor. [plus THICK users manual. The others
all have documentation, but Publish It is the best.
        2] The Aircraft Encyclopedia by Quantum Press
        3] CD Game Pack II by Software Toolworks
        4] GUIDE Star Charts (Version 3.0) Probably the best
Star Chart/Planetarium program available in the USA today. See
Review in a recent (June or July, 93) issue of Sky and Telescope.
        5] US History on CD/Rom by Bureau Development Corp.
        6] US Atlas and AUTO MAP by Software Toolworks
        7] Software Toolworks Multimedia Encyclopedia - is what
I was using the most often.
        8] The Best of Media Clips, by ARIS entertainment. This 
disk has photographs, .wav and .midi sounds and other neat multi-
media things.
        9] Selected Astronomical Catalogs from NASA, the guys who
brought you the Challenger Disaster. This disk is a pretty good
one however, full of diffrent star catalogs, including the Yale 
Bright Star Catalog and the Gliese catalogue.
        10] North American Indians, by Quanta Press.
All these CDs are contained in a hansome, utilitarian plastic 
"media Mate" which will keep them handy, safe and out of the way
when you\'re not using them.

        The price of this complete package is $550.00 {US$ only}.  As for shippi
ng,
I\'ll pick up the first $20.00 - which will be enough to send this via 3rd
class slow-boat to china mail in the US.  After that, YOU pay the shipping.
The package, which is all packed, just waiting for a lable weighes 18 pounds

you can shop around and decide for yourself how fast and how much ...

     Anyone interested in this should contact me, electronically via E.Mail,
before the 4th of July. The price of $550.00 for the entire package is
guarenteed until then.

   Thruster plates only provide thrust.  Going by DGP\'s explanation in SoM,
thruster plates can change the direction of thrust, but the amount of
thrust decreases as it moves away from its main axis, so you get only 10%
thrust in reverse.  A short, squat ship with it\'s thruster on the bottom (a
tradition flying saucer or cone shape for example) would be the best
configuration for a ship - uncomplicated VTOL ability, and the decks are at
right angles to the normal axis of thrust and the ground; if you lose your
inertial compensators or are sitting on the ground, the g-forces are coming
from the accustomed direction.

   You can, of course, define how it works for your own purposes.  You
could have thruster plates act on a volume like the contra-grav lifters.
This way you don\'t have to worry about the placement of the drive or the
axis of thrust.  , Another consequence is there won\'t be any feeling of
acceleration due to the drive - the drive is acting to accelerate on
everything in the volume.

   The scale efficiences modifier was eliminated.  But, the need for power
has diminished as well.  The MT Subsidized Merchant had a 1476 MW
poerplant; the TNE version has a 282 MW plant.  In MT, your basic ship
laser required 250 MW;  adding 4 lasers to the merchant requires 68% of its
installed power.  Only 6% is required for the TNE version (4 lasers at 4.2
MW each).  This makes it easier for characters to arm their ships.

   Engineering crew seems to be making up for the shrinkage in power
plants. :)  One recent design, a 20kt battle rider, required 840 engineers
(this with TL-16 computers) - plus the 140 cmd crew.  Using the power
plant\'s volume instead of output gives somewhat more acceptable numbers.
Meson guns are almost as bad as power plants: a TL15, 25600 Mj MG (see
below) requires a crew of 128.

I\'ve designed a cruiser-sized meson gun, resonably sized for that class of
ship, with a DV of 1000 (yes, one thousand).  A Tigress could sport something
even larger, possibly with a DV several times that, depending on how
specialized
you want to design the ship.

I have, and bay weapons tend to be pretty useless except as hull-scrapers.

If a PA is operating at the maximum Mj for it\'s length, its penetration value
works out
to 5 times it\'s length in meters within it\'s effective range.

I don\'t have the exact numbers here, but for a 50-ton bay that works out to
a PV of 60, and for a 100-ton bay a PV of about 80.  Considering that cruisers
and battleships will have armor ratings in the THOUSANDS, they\'re only
good for blinding the enemy (a tactic which will be very popular in battles
under
BL rules, I should think.)

Bay mesons have such pitiful range they\'re not worth building in most cases.

Lasers should be limited to about 50 Mj/tech-level, which is an arbitrary
limit,
but is needed for game balance.  Joule for joule, lasers are more versatile
than
PA\'s or MG\'s and have a superior ability to deliver damage to the target.
Allow them to compete directly, and there rapidly becomes no point to building
PA\'s and MG\'s.  Putting a limit on them keeps them at the low end of the
weapons
spectrum, where they have traditionally been in Traveller.

Keep this is mind.  This `inter-relatedness\' between the participants in
feudalism is the key point that distinguishes it from other government
types.

I question this defintion below.

There is nothing specific about socioeconomic status with respect to
feudalism.  It is rather the differences in the responsibilities of
the various parties that determines their relative *political* power.
A vassal may very well have greater *wealth* than her liege but the
nature of the feudal relationship ties her to her liege nonetheless.

>      Second, an elite class which controls some critical

Again, there is nothing about `elites\' or `priviledge\' inherent in feudalism
*or* technocracy.  Elite trappings from medieval times are related to the
aristocractic relationships based upon heredity between the ruling class
(nobles) and the ruled (commoners).  This was not a feudal relationship
but rather an oligarchic one.

In medieval feudalism the ruling class controlled *all* forms of technology
as well as the economic basis for that technology.  Furthermore, the modern
meaning of the term technocracy does not pertain to a single type of
technology but instead refers to a source of authority based upon technical
ability in general (as opposed to some other source such as property
ownership, heredity, divine access, popular consent, etc.).  In contemporary
society, technical ability is also closely tied to industrial capability and
the economic base.  This suggests that a feudal technocracy based upon a
single form of technology will be the exception rather than the rule.  Most
feudal technocracies will therefore be based upon an `inter-related\'
relationship between those with industrial capabilities.

Actually, it is the fact that the feudal technocracy is based upon
a full range of technological endeavor that permits different segments
of the ruling class to work at cross purposes.  Look at how the hegemony
of the AMA has been rattled now that insurance providers and employers have
entered the health care debate.

These are all interesting suggestions but some might be better classified
as types other than feudal technocracies.

This is the oligarchic or aristocractic aspect of medieval society.  It
was called serfdom.  The feudal relationship existed *between* the members
of the ruling class (lords and vassals), not between the ruling class and
the commoners.

> 2.  Corporate Feudalism:  A complex arrangement consisting of

This is more akin to an aristocratic model.  In most corporate systems
the employees will serve at the whim of management.  Even heavily unionized
systems that limit management\'s ability to replace workers still do not
create any obligation upon management toward the workers other than that
of continued employment.  If management chooses to run the
company into the ground, the workers are powerless and unable to stop
them or correct the move - at least not through any agreed upon and 
previously defined relationship.

Here is the system of `inter-relatedness\' that characterizes the Japanese
*kieritsu* and begins to describe the true nature of a feudal technocracy.

This is essentially redundant but it describes the mechanics of the
feudal relationship quite well.

Again, self-sufficiency makes a feudal relationship problematic.  Without
the need for `inter-relatedness\' there can be no feudal relationship.

This is another aristocractic form.  Basing authority upon heredity
removes the need for an agreed upon relationship between parties based
upon their `inter-relatedness\'.  Under a caste system there is no
obligation placed upon the upper castes toward the lower castes.

This has been some excellent work and is quite a contribution to anyone\'s
campaign.  It may even fit many folk\'s view of government code 5 but I
think we could be more careful in our defintions of any type of government
if instead of focusing upon the particular manifestations of a certain
government type, in this case various forms of technology, we instead 
focus upon the nature of authority (who has it) and the source of that
authority (how it is legitimized).

Admiral Jackie Fisher was First Sea Lord of the British Admiralty at the turn 
of the century, and he invented the all-big-gun battleship -- called the
1st one Deadnaught.  (More or less invented, I know about the Italian and
US developments at the time, by it was Dreadnaught that set the standard)

Agreed.  Also, I notice that Meson screens and Nuclear Dampers have antennas
in their designs.  If I destroy those antennas, do I get a prize?

Actually, my problem with MT was the same as my problem with HG -- the use of 
weapons as damage absorbers.  It was like covering the Iowa with 50-cal MG\'s
and then saying you had to knock them all out before you could take out a
big gun.  The new rules suit me a lot better.

I don\'t think 2000 is going to turn out to be that much armour once we get going
at ship design.  We probably need some sort of structure to compare apples and
apples, like TCS provided for high guard.  Perhaps we should be working on
designs in a TCS environment  -- say TL14, unlimitted pilots.

I would suggest that, given a strong memory of the rebellion, Regency forces
would be controlled at a far more cetralized level.  Fleets would still be
deployed to subsectors, but ship, squadron and command staff rotations would 
frequent to avoid forming local alliances.  I would suspect that jump capable
"provincial" forces would also be banned, and local defence command would 
be assigned by central command.

The pay-off in return would be a greater scope in Regency-wide affairs than 
would have been possible under the Imperium.

Has enough data been posted to permit development of a TCS (or alternative,
take your pick) budget for the fleet?  The regency and its enemies could form 
a good focus for our ship design and tactics discussion.

I rather liked H. Beam Pipers term from the Terran Federation period -- The
"Fleet-Army Force."  It identifies the tie-in between the two components
very clearly.

I\'ll be happy to work from pretty much any formula for budget, etc.  TCS does
give a number, however.  (On the other hand, maybe its the wrong number.
The very fact that a TCS campaign is a straight wargame means that you start
the whole exercise in an arms race.  What are the big-time threats to the 
Regency right now?  Is there an active arms race on with any of them?  I think
these factors are more important than the budget numbers.  Then there is the
question of the proportion of fleet resourses going to anti-virus defence...)

Here\'s one crack at it...

Regency Military Forces -- Basic Structure.

The basic organizational unit of the Regency armed forces is 
the Regiment.  Paradoxically, the Regiment is a unit which 
will never be encountered on the battlefield.

Instead, the Regiment is composed of two or more battalions.  
The base battalion remains fixed to a recruiting territory -- 
a fixed area of a given world.  It is responsible for 
administration, recruiting and basic training of individuals 
who will then serve with the Regiment\'s 1-2 active service 
battalions.  In addition, the battalion may maintain one or 
more reserve battalions -- part time soldiers and veterans 
using out-of-date equipment.

All Battalions of a Regiment are of the same troop type.  
Thus the Battalion is the building block of other formations.  
Regiments are recruited based on the society and capabilities 
of the home world -- for instance, low tech worlds produce 
light infantry regiment, while armored troops are recruited 
on worlds where advanced technology is more familiar.  In 
particular, space EVA units are be recruited as much as 
possible in asteroid belts.

Special Service Regiments (SAS, Drop Troops, whatever) are a 
detached assignment of the best troops from line regiments.  
Members retain their regimental assignments, and return to 
their regiments (probably to a promotion) on the completion 
of their tour.

Higher level formations are built up of Brigades, a formation 
made up of 2-4 Battalions.  Although Brigades have no 
"permanent" structure, the value of established team 
relationships is recognized, and long term partnerships 
between complementary battalions (say, lift infantry and grav 
tank) is commonplace.

In a combat situation, Battalion and Company combat teams 
will be formed by the brigade commander as required for the 
mission at hand out of the component companies of his 
brigade.

Officers also remain members of their regiment for their 
whole careers, but may be detached to various staff commands 
for extended periods.  Above field grades, regimental 
membership has more to do with club membership than command 
structure.

I hope this is helpful.  It is, of course, the British / 
Commonwealth regimental system;  but I think that it is an 
approach with real virtues in military terms, and good 
adventuring flavor.

I will put some thought into higher formations, to troop 
types, and "how large should a battalion be, anyway?"

It depends on exactly what is being claimed. You asked for an explanation of
how come Gram dominated Saxnoth when Saxnoth was more powerful than Gram. I 
suggested that maybe Gram had been a higher tech level recently (and/or
Sacnoth lower) due to an econo-technological cycle effect. You _claimed_
that this wasn\'t possible. Since then I\'ve been arguing that they are. Not 
necessarily likely (although I think they are, but then, as I\'ve stated 
before, economics are mostly SF to me), but at least possible. Obviously, if 
I could come up with just one example, I would prove my point outright. But 
just because I can\'t dosen\'t mean it isn\'t possible. Now, if I were to claim 
that the lack of evidence to the contrary _proved_ anything, then I would be 
making a UFO-nutter type claim. But I\'m only saying that the lack dosen\'t 
disprove anything.

What factual record? We have _one_, count them, one, complete listing of
world UWPs for the Spinward Marches, the one first published in _Spinward
Marches Campaign_ and since reprinted (with the UWPs _unchanged_) in
_Imperial Encyclopedia_ and _Megatraveller Journal_ #3 (Before you decide
to dispute that, check the data. Despite the changes in alliegiance noted
in IE and MJ3 there are no changes in world population level or multiplier
(this based on a spot check of 40+ of the planets, including all the Vargr-
occupied ones in Aramis Subsector)). How can you establish any sort of
projection on that? So it _could_ be that the TLs have grown slowly and
steadily. Or they could have been rollercoasting up and down over the
centuries. We just can\'t tell from the record.

> 
>I don\'t know but nothing about this slow rate of advancement calls out for

The _discovery_ tech level of the Imperium have been one TL per three or
four centuries, hasen\'t it (I forget exactly; the discovery times of
Jump-4, -5, and -6 was mentioned somewhere once. I think it worked out 
at one per three centuries)? But we\'re talking about _developement_ TLs.
I say again: A moderately important colony like Regina that advances it\'s
economy by 5% (or even 20% if you go by _Striker_ rules) in eight centuries
by slow, steady increments that never declines, is difficult to believe. I
can believe in economic up- and downturns that averaged out into 5% over the 
centuries much more readily.

Hmmm. Perhaps I can restate my argument in a clearer way than I have done
before:

Assumtion: The only reason why an Imperial planet in 1105 is not TL 15 is
that it can\'t afford to be (I\'m ignoring those few planets where there 
are legal, moral, or philosophical objections to advanced technology).
(This is the crucial assumption.)

A planet with TL A therefor has an economic condition we will call
Economic Level A. Should the planet advance from EL A, its technological
level will advance too (To, say, TL B). If the planet at any future date
becomes poorer, its economic level would decline to EL A again. Its 
technology should decline as a consequence, since the planet obviously 
cannot afford to maintain the technology (if it could, it would have had 
TL B in under EL A in the first place). Since economies do seem to have a 
tendency to fluctuate (vide the world as we know it), it seems plausible 
that it will do so in the Spinward Marches too.

It would be nice to have a few quotes. I skimmed _Space Viking_ last night
without findng any reference to either Gorram or Lothar Ffayle being barons,
but I did notice that while Traskon is a farming and ranching barony (hence
a land barony) Sesar Karvall is, indeed, baron of Karvallsmills, not of
Karvall. And there is a reference to the \'financial and industrial barons
of Wardshaven\'. So, yes, Gram does have industrial fiefs.

That\'s the assumption I\'m working from.

I don\'t really think that a retelling of the doings of 5th century tribal
chiefs is all that useful as a basis of comparison. Though I suppose that
they do reflect how Mallory thought things worked.

Then its not analogous to a feudal society. Let\'s get a few definitions
straight:

From "Oxford Advanced Learner\'s Dictionary" (1974):

_feudal_: of the method of holding land (by giving services to the owner)
during the Middle Ages in Europe.

_fief_: land held from a feudal lord.

_vassal_: (in feudal times) person who held land in return for which he
wowed to give military service to the owner of the land.

And from "Funk&Wagnall\'s Standard Dictionary":

_feudalism_ The medieval European system of land tenure on condition of
military aid and other services.

_feudal system_: A politico-economic system [...] founded on the tenure
of feuds, or fiefs, given as compensation for military services rendered 
by chiefs and by them sublet by allotments to their subordinates and vassals.

_feud[2]_: Land held of a superior on condition of rendering service; a fief.

>in a feudal technocracy like the *kieritsu*, the owners of industrial
>production pledge their economic support (i.e. cooperation) to a central
>authority which cooridinates the efforts of various industrial and service
>sectors towards the perceived common good, namely profits.  This is a 
>voluntary arrangement where the individual corporate entities may or may not
>choose to continue to cooperate.  Just as feudal barons might choose to

>an advantage for themselves.

The feudal baron held his lands on condition that he supported his liege
lord. Many broke their oaths on occasion, but that was in defiance of the
law. (The only valid excuse was winning).

And these shareholders never represent different interest groups that wheel
and deal and compromise to get their respective representatives on the
board? The board is always composed of people who are in complete accord?
And all the shareholders are always in accord too?

>In a feudal technocracy there are several *different*

Act in what way that is different from owners of different share blocks in
a corporation?

>here.  A corporate government is a specialized form of an autocracy.  

I didn\'t include the corporate model as an example of the equivalent of
a kingdom, but as the equivalent of a fief.

>In a corporate model there is, in theory at least, no imput at all from those
>participating in the system.  You just do what the boss says or you\'re fired.

And a vassal does what his liege lord says or he is \'fired\'.

Yes and no. He owns a lot of it from the days where his father was the
biggest lord around. He became king when he conquered the other lords
around him (in which case he came to own their land) or when the other 
independent lords decided to back him, in which case he did not own their
land... yet. But when he became strong enough, he made those formerly 
independent lords do homage for their own lands, thereby actually laying 
claim to it. Or he made war against a recalcitrant lord, acquired the land 
by conquest, and made the former owner or somebody else do homage for it. 
Check a history of medieval Europe for more detail.

Coordinated services may be the reason why the other lords decided to back 
him. But what they owe him fealthy for is the tenure of their fiefs.

>No, the king is the equivalent of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Look, the shareholders in a corporation is a conglomerate owner. In theory
they make up one person, the owner of the corporation. The Chairman works
for the owner. The vassals \'works\' for the king. See the difference?

A fief has _one_ owner. A baron can\'t sell off shares of his barony to make
the buyers part-barons of the fief (He may be able to sell bits of the fief, 
but these bits then become parts of other fiefs). And if a company is the 
equivalent of a fief then there won\'t be any shareholders, just one baron.
You\'re getting mixed up because so many of the companies we know of today 
are incorporated. In fact, I realize that I\'ve been using \'corporation\' and
company interchangably. That was wrong. Please read \'company\' whenever I\'ve
used \'corporation\' in connection with a feudal technocracy. There can be no
shareholders in a feudal fief, technocratic or not.

It sound like the *kieritsu* is merely capitalism without anti-trust laws.

Nope. The central tenet of feudalism is *service* as a medium of repayment.

The feudal technocrcy equivalent of the military protection received by

I suppose that a part holding in a BIG company could be a fief in itself.
But that would be owned by _one_ person, and that person would have the
title. And there\'s certainly no mention of any \'Baron of a Third of the
Megatronics Company\' in _Space Viking_ ;-)

That\'s just precisely what I claim he couldn\'t. He gives the barony in
its entirety to Duke Angus, and Angus appoints another Trask as \'Vicar-
Baron\'. And just like that Lucas is no longer a baron.

>He owned that entire block of shares of the total economic sector of Gram.

He owned a barony. I\'ll sonceede that the fact that it was a land barony
is irrelevant, and that it could just as well have been a computer firm.
But if it had been, it would have been as indivisible as any land barony
(ie. he might be able to sell off peripheral parts, but the core must
remain relatively intact).

Have we read the same book? Angus increased wealth allowed him to buy more
fighting men which allowed him to attack Omfray and other enemies and to
gain the support of some of the other big dukes. And, as someone says on 
page 124, "He\'s King as long as the great lords like Count Lionel and Joris 
of Bigglersport and Alan of Northport want him to be" (Obviously Angus 
hasn\'t reached the point where he can annex the big counties and dukedoms 
for himself, but then, he\'s only a first-generation king).

No, in a young FT it\'s the ones who has glommed onto a big slice of the
industry and dole it out to vassals. In a well-established FT it\'s the
ones whose ancestors did that and then supported an even bigger duke for
king.

Wait a minute. The Chairman keeps back part of his employees\' salaries and
place them in a pension fund, right? That gives hin  lot of pull in electing 
the board of the fund, agreed. But the money that accrues from the fund 
belongs to the employees, don\'t it? How does the Chairman see a penny of it?

We\'re most certainly not saying the same thing. If a noble holds his land 
from an overlord he cannot transfer his support without breaking his oath. 
If he\'s an independent lord that is not a king we\'re still in the early 
state of the formation of the kingdom.

But a feudal king did own the fiefs, at the very least formally.

>just `removed\' the Duke and taken his wife Igrayne.  

Oh no he couldn\'t. The feudal contract was binding on the overlord too.
He had promised to protect his vassal\'s rights. Uther couldn\'t remove
the Duke without cause. (Also, of course, the whole episode takes place
long before the feudal system evolved).

>>Thereby forfeiting his right to the fief.

>No, thereby forfeiting his right to protection from the aristocratic king

A fief is held in tenancy from the owner. Fail in your obligations and you
forfeit the fief.

You\'re talking about economic might regardless of the social system. But
a sovereign power is only vulnerable to outside economic influence if 
they are vulnerable. By this I mean that if Gram has all the raw material
they need then they can impose trade restrictions that leaves Sacnoth\'s
greater economic strength whistling at the door. The reason US Industry 
fears the japanese is that the US _is_ vulnerable. But why should Gram
be vulnerable just because the US is?

Not according to the Traveller rules.

>(Of course, you must give up your `cycles\' to accept this point.)

No, the cycles has nothing to do with that argument. They just provide one
explanation (out of several) of how Gram can have homebuilt TL 12 ships if 
we decide that a military parity is necessary to explain anything.

If Anders _owns_ fiefs on Sacnoth then it\'s actually equivalent to the
England/Calais situation. So I don\'t think that\'s likely, since that
would make Sacnoth balkanized. Still, the Scouts might have misunderstood
the situation when they compiled their survey. But those vassals could 
only get out of supporting Anders by breaking their oaths and turning to
Harald for protection. Then he would be their overlord. Nohow would they
become kings themselves.

Subject to King Anders\' oaths to his vassals. The feudal oath is a two-way
one.

>*and* similar *then* to the corporate model.

No. _If_ Anders could appoint and remove governors of his holdings at will
then he would be an autocrat. If he gives the holding in fief he cannot
revoke it except for cause. That _is_ the feudal system

Now we\'re suddenly into the military situation. I thought you were talking
about economic superiority? I\'ve always postulated that Gram had access to
TL 12 ships of its own. And I postulate that neither Harald nor Anders
wants to duel with submachineguns at 5 paces.

William White writes a whole heap of good stuff:

Sure. I\'ve never said \'feudal technocracy\' couldn\'t actually be non-feudal.
I\'ve merely postulated that it was and argued from that assumption.

The essence of the definitions of feudalism I\'ve seen is that you \'pay\'
for tenancy with services instead of money.

>make up a privileged, ruling class (ergo, "technocracy").

The rest of your arguments are all very nicely thought out. But I suggest
that the technocracy bit lies in the substitution of industry for land as
the feudal fief. Thus the fiefholder might render technological service
instead of or in addition to military service.

Otherwise your posting is most impressive.

Right, I\'ve been playing around with FFS for a while now, designing
this and mulling over that - the general thing, and I\'ve got some
ideas/questions that maybe other people have worked on:

Please note that I haven\'t got the book with me at work, so I\'ll just
have to guess most of the figures, but I hope they are almost
correct.

1) Homopolar Generators. These seem to be the major restriction on the
size of most devices, especially weaponry, within FFS. However, I got
wondering about whether batteries could be used in their place. One
quick calculation later, and I come up with the following:

For a laser, I assumed each pulse lasts about 0.1 seconds, therefore
we need the 0.036 sec discharge rate battery type (or we could
extrapolate). This has an output of x3125 at 3MW (?) at TL15. This
comes to (3125X3X0.036)=337.5Mj per cumet. HPGs are 0.04 cumet per Mj
(?) which is only 25Mj per cumet. This gets even wider a discrepancy
at lower discharge times, so a meson gun at 100 shots/turn would only
really need the 3.6 second battery which works out at about 1350Mj per
cumet.

This creates a slight technology gap... I am of course assuming
batteries can be recharged at that speed, which I would have thought
was possible, as they can discharge that fast!

I also cannot believe that a spinning wheel (which is what HPGs are at
TL 8+(?) ) can give up all x000Mj of energy in a short a space as
0.036 seconds. Has anyone tried working out the friction or even the
speed the wheel would need to be spinning at to store so much energy?
I can believe large power capacitors, so why this rotational K.E.
system?

2) What is there to prevent the same HPG being used for more than one
weapon? The rules state that the HPG is capable of keeping up with any
rate of fire (again I don\'t believe that), so if it can manage 800
shots/turn, why can\'t it drive four different focal arrays at 200
shots/turn? All that would be needed is the extra focal arrays, an
extra beam pointer for each FA, and some extra control (this could be
an MFD to drive the FAs or maybe install three extra workstations). I
first though of this idea for a Janus mount, where the two identical
spinal weapons were synched to fire alternately from the same HPG.

3) Black Globes used as solar arrays seem to absorb one heck of a lot
of energy. In the habitable zone, a gigantic size globe will absorb
1/10 (1200^2) = 144,000MW!! Over one single turn, this will be
1800x144,000 = 259 million Mj - try absorbing that lot into a HPG
without overload.

Even a smaller screen will absorb 1/10 (40^2) = 160MW which is 288,000
Mj per turn - has this lot got to be taken into account when designing
the HPGs for absorbing incoming fire?

Maybe we can drag a small ship behind the main craft carrying a black
globe generator and use that as the power supply for my craft....

4) Why does anyone bother with tunable lasers at TL13+ when x-ray
lasers become available? The range modification of any atmosphere
condition is never worse than ten times smaller than the visible laser
modifier, so an x-ray laser with a range multiplier of 100,000 is
always better than the tunable one.

5) Why did GDW have to go and make fusion weapons non-viable as space
weaponry anymore? Grumble moan grumble. Have to make my OWN rules now.
*sigh*

6) When designing bay PAWs, would it be possible to have the tunnel
along the greatest diagonal of the bay? As far as I can remember, the
100 ton bay has dimension of 15.65 x 9.5 x 9.5 thus restricting tunnel
length to 15.65m.

But the greatest diagonal is 20.6m, thus effecting an increase of
tunnel length of 33% or so. Much better....

Same effect applies with turrets and barbettes if you fancy generating
PAW turrets or even close range Meson barbettes.

Personally, I just ignore the standard socket designs myself, and just
design the weapons into the body of the ship - no waste of space and
free to choose my own dimensions.

Which brings me to...

7) How do I calculate the maximum dimensions in the other two
directions on a ship? I know the length - but what about width and
height? At the moment, I am assuming that it can be derived from the
average cross-sectional area: i.e.

Volume/Length = avg cross-sectional area.

The width and height can then be derived from them. A cylinder or
needle config would just be sqrt(area), and other configs can have
widths and heights of any reasonable figures which multiply together
to the area. This are the main body figures. Thus, I know roughly how
large my sideways facing meson guns can be....

Anyone any other ideas? Perhaps a table of W and H multipliers might
be a good idea.

8) Where are the design rules for the bulk of space missiles? I have
found the warhead and propellant rules, but what about guidance design
etc? Have I just missed them?

Oh well, thats enough for now. Otherwise, it\'s a wonderful book. I
just hope we\'ll get to see FFS 2 or something similar, with computer
programs, robots, ships, submersibles etc etc.

Aha! Just remembered - in the TNE rule book, it lists an expanded
version of the battery list for higher TLs, and tells you how to
design them for any piece of equipment. Just one small question - no
piece of equipment actually has a power requirment listed with it! So
how do we work it out then? Anyone done a table?

from _The Japanese Today_ which hopefully explains some of this.
Incidentally, I highly recommend that book if you are interested 
in Japan and need a place to start, especially since I had to hack
up this essay a bit to hit the high points.

I also think that I should take a moment to point out that DGP\'s
WBH allows representative authority of a feudal technocracy to
range from a single ruler, through various types of councils, to
rule by the *demos*, so there should be a wide range of types of
feudal technocracies.  Be flexible!


from: _Traveller: The New Era_, 1993, p.188.

"Feudal Technocracy.  Government by specific individuals for those
 who agree to be ruled.  Relationships are based on the performance
 of technical activities which are mutually beneficial."
 

from: Reischauer, Edwin O.  _The Japanese Today_, 1988, p.305-7.

"In prewar times, the distinctive Japanese economic institution that
 most caught the attention of the outside world was the so-called
 *zaibatsu* system.  The term *zaibatsu* is perjorative, meaning 
 "financial clique".  It is specifically applied to certain giant 
 financial, commercial, and industrial combines but is loosely used for
 prewar Japanese big business in general.  [...]
 
"The zaibatsu came to control a very large part of the upper level of
 the Japanese economy [...] ...before long the government became 
 suspicious of the growing influence of big business... [...]
 
"It is ironic that after the war the American occupation in turn 
 attacked the zaibatsu for being the root cause of Japanese imperialism
 and on these grounds singled them out for destruction.  Their ownership
 was removed from the controlling families virtually without compensation,
 and the great combines were broken up into their component parts.  
 Before they could be further atomized in a traditional American "trust-
 busting" operation, the occupation\'s reform program was halted, leaving
 the larger corporate subunits of the original zaibatsu intact.  Since
 the occupation, these have gradually reassumed their old names [...] 
 and have drawn together in loose, informal associations, now known in
 Japan as *keiretsu*.
 
"Because of the existence of these keiretsu groupings, many observers
 have asserted that the zaibatsu system has been restored, but this is
 not correct.  The keiretsu form something like clubs, whose members
 may look first to each other for aid and cooperation before trying
 other sources. [...]  But these relations are by no means exclusive,
 and there is no central ownership and none of the rigid controls once
 excersised within a zaibatsu organization. [...]
 
" ...zaibatsu were typically under the control of a central holding
 company, largely owned by the original family.  The holding company
 controlled several major affiliates and these in turn a series of
 minor affiliates.  This sort of pyramiding of control is common enough
 in the West, but what made the Japanese case unique was the fact that
 the controlling company often lacked majority ownership....  Control,
 however, was exercised through other means.  The affiliate would
 probably be completely dependent on the banking, shipping, and trading
 facilities of the combine; interlocking directors were common; 
 executives were switched around among the component firms as though
 they were members of a unified bureaucracy; the advantages and prestige
 of belonging to a large zaibatsu combine were great; and a strong sense
 of personal loyalty to the combine permeated the leadership, much as in
 a pre-modern feudal domain.  Young executives joined a zaibatsu 
 enterprise for a lifetime career.
 
"A typical zaibatsu organization was not like the contemporary American
 conglomerates, which bring together entirely unrelated corporations
 under the same ownership.  Instead, they were rational outgrowths of
 evolving economic activity and therefore are better described as 
 combines.  They tended to cluster around a central bank that financed
 the various activities of the combine.  These functions often stood in
 a vertical relationship.  For example, a series of seperate companies
 might mine a certain ore, fashion it into manufactured products, 
 transport those abroad on the combine\'s shipping line, and sell them 
 abroad and purchase the needed raw materials for the whole process
 through the combines "general trading company" [...], while all of
 these different stages of the operation would be financed by the 
 combine\'s bank."
 
I hope this helps out a bit!

    'body' => 'Hi all,
        in the recent discussion of feudalism and feudal technocracy it seems
there has been some talking at cross-purposes.

        Some relevant powers of a feudal king which have not been mentioned
are the powers to grant new titles and existing unheld titles and the
administration of disputes between vassals( and hence law). This power is
significant when it comes to the sharing-out of newly obtained resources,
whether from conquest, purchase or legal skulduggery. 

The feudal system is inherently unstable, especially in times of transition 
when there may be no clear heir or successor. (this sounds familiar...oops
:-) ). It involves a continual struggle for power between the king and the
vassals and between the vassals, as the king attempts to safeguard his
position by centralising power, and the vassals attempt to strengthen
their positions, and reduce the king\'s power (consciously or otherwise).

        David Johnson has been alluding to the "strong barons" version of
feudalism where the vassals are in a position to pick and choose their
king(IMHO). Hans Rancke has written about a "strong king" version of
feudalism where the vassals are due to circumstances stuck with the
current king, like it or not. Both these versions are historically 
recorded examples of the feudal system in action.
 
        In the first version the king\'s power is limited to what the vassals 
will accept. This may even go so far as to the king being relegated to a 
figurehead. The vassals are most definitely the owners of their feifs and will
strenuously resist interference in them by the king( or anyone else for that
matter). Here the vassals may form a united block behind a figurehead king
(oligarchy-like) or may squabble disastrously as an ineffectual king\'s calls
for peace and unity are ignored. In the latter case the king may fall and
total balkanisation may ensue if no resolution is reached.

In the second version the king is most definitely boss, with overwhelming
support from the majority of his vassals. In this position the king is 
very powerful, and effectively does control \'everything\'. He can introduce
laws strengthening his rule, declare rebellious vassals to be outlaws and 
strip them of their holding,(to be awarded to loyal followers), and pretty much
do as he likes. If this continues for long enough the government may change
to another type, such as a dictatorship. (In this version of feudalism all
land WAS ultimately ruled by the king, and doled out to his loyal vassals).

The normal feudal position is between these two extremes. The king is 
powerful and has significant latitude of action, but must listen to his
vassals and be careful not to upset the majority of them too much. 
The vassals wish stability and will follow the king unless he becomes
too unreasonable or overbearing in his rulings.

David wishes to prove that Sacnoth should rule the Sword Worlds by virtue of
its TL advantage over the official ruling planet, Gram. While is certainly
possible for this change to occur, it is by no means automatic. There are
many other relevant factors which are not specified and which would affect
the outcome. It is possible to set up a campaign to justify almost any 
prejudice a referee has. Maybe Sacnoth has a policy of appeasement so they 
are not the ones bombed by an attacking force. Maybe there is something in
the atmosphere or soil of Sacnoth that makes the inhabitants less aggressive,
or conversely the inhabitants of Gram are more aggressive. Maybe the Zhodani
are mind-controlling the Sacnothians into acquiescence etc, etc. Anything can
be justified, nothing is automatic.

Hope my contribution to this thread makes sense,

        And only a few weeks ago people were arguing that TML was 
moribund!   Excellent post!

        A few nits to pick, though.  Many of the examples you give of 
feaudalism, such as corporate feudalism, are already present in the 
government type structure, such as the corporate state.  I think the 
critical difference is the lack of or highly limited societal mobility.  A 
common thread throughout all your examples is the codification of 
position as hereditary...I think that this could serve as the sole 
definition of a feudal state, and the basis of that segregation, military, 
contract, medical or whatever is less important.  

        Indeed many of your examples are not precisely feudal in 
nature, but more like technocracies, ie: the technical or scientific elite 
holding power.

        A feudal society was as marked by the responsibilities of the 
higher classes to the lower as by their rights...all power derived from 
the bottom, in reality...just look at the restoration of the Meijii 
emperor over the Shogunate in 19th century Japan.  That change was 
spearheaded by some rather small, rural provinces.

        Since, whether GDW based the Sword Worlds entire or only part 
on Piper\'s book, I re-read Space Viking the other day.  In it the 
protagonist (Prince Trask) expresses surprise that an outsider 
declared his (very classic land and production based) feudal society as 
a tyranny.  Trask than explains that no one has any power that is not 
explicitly granted by the people below, and all that has to be done to 
eliminate a tyranny is withhold the support necessary.  In fact, this is 
very much like European \'classical\' feudalism...The king theoretically 
wielded great power, but only as long as he held the support of the 
lesser nobles, who only wielded their power with the support of those 
below, etc. because the true power...armies, were not standing, but 
composed of all those lower knights and barons, who quite freely 
looked out for their own hides.  The pledged fealty to the king, but that 
oath was binding both ways...the king had to act to their benefit, or he 
had no power.

        This is really only possible in lower populations, where the 
lowest tiers of the society still wields enough political power to 
make a difference.  This argues forcefully against large population 
feudal states.  The Japanese example I had mentioned before was not 
the best.  By the time of the Meijii restoration, the Shogunate had 
evolved from a true military-based feudal state to a giant 
bureauocracy, hereditarily determined, to be sure, but still a 
bureauocracy.

    'body' => 'Steve Bonneville (bonnevil@mermaid,micro.umn.edu) has an interesting
 idea in his rapid-fire anti-missile laser.  He suggested that this weapon
system would be an ideal system to mount on a Battleship to defaeat huge
clouds of missiles launched by escorts.

About a week ago, there was a small TML furor over what role (if any) a
frigate class ship would have in an Imperial Fleet.  In the US Navy, a
Frigate is a screening vessel, used for anti-missile, anti-air and anti-sub
defense.  Perhaps Frigates would play a similar role in an Imperial Fleet.
A Frigate would be a small (5,000 to 10,000 tons displacement) ship,
equipped with long-range sensors and defensive laser batteries.  To aid
in its anti-missile role, it would also be equipped with the anti-missile
lasers.  It would also carry a large number of EMS jamming suites, either
on the ship or in the form of remote drones. 

In this configuration, a Frigate would also make an admirable space
minesweeper.  Its small size might allow it to avoid sensor lock from the
mines, and its weapons would already be configured for targeting and
destroying large numbers of missiles/mines quickly.

(Of course, this assumes everybody else enjoys laying fields of independent
ship\'s missiles as mines, like I do to my PCs from time to time).

This still leaves the question about what escorts do in a fleet.  I think
anything smaller than a destroyer is going to be of very limited usefulness
in a fleet action.  I think the \'scrubbing\' of surface features would be
a fighter mission, not a escort mission.  Escorts could launch clouds of
missiles, but I think this would be better served with a purpose-built
design (something like the Brilliant Lances Missile Corvette, but with
more launchers).  

In reality, destroyer escorts would certainly be of use in small
ship actions and actions against civilian or paramilitary ships, but in actual
fleet actions escorts would be relegated to acting as security elements on
the edges of fleet formations, and acting as sensor platforms and 
communications links.  They would still be very useful for chasing nosy
PCs away from fleet formations.

This does not reflect the views of my employers.  They are so heavily
armored as to be impenetrable to all but the Death Star main gun.
