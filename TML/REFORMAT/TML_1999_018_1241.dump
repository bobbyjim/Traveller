Dom mentioned that SJG "doesn\'t do" adventures (normally), but that he
figures they\'ll carry these BITS items anyway.  If for some reason SJG does
not want to sell them then The Traveller Trader will look into getting them.
We will gauge interest levels prior to ordering, but I really want to see
all of the BITS stuff make it over here in decent numbers.  Say what you
will about my will-power, but I just can\'t resist the urge to own every
Traveller product I hear about ;-)

I like that as a good GM approach. Unfortunately I like to have a
mostly-plausible explanation for things as my players are bound to start
asking questions about it, because if I don\'t then they\'ll start
pondering the problem and I\'ll suddenly have to become an expert on
terraforming, or biochemistry, or jump-drive mechanics. It leads to some
very interesting speculative or philosophical discussions, but it does
tend to interfere with game flow.

I know it\'s back to the discussion a while ago about players being
experts where GMs aren\'t bit it happens.

Besides, I _like_ knowing this sort of thing. Roleplaying has confirmed
my long-held belief that "there\'s no such thing as useless information,
only information I haven\'t found a use for yet."

Actually, I like to have plausible explanations socked away for
everything too, but I can\'t say too much about some of my background
material because *all* much PBEM players are on the list.  <G>

>I know it\'s back to the discussion a while ago about players being
>experts where GMs aren\'t bit it happens.

Not that I\'ll officially admit to *ever* doing this, but a trick is
to let the expert players come up with one or more plausible
explanations.  Pick one secretly, then just smile knowingly and
refuse to tell them which of their solutions is the correct one.

>Besides, I _like_ knowing this sort of thing. Roleplaying has

Oh, absolutely!  And it is easier to use someone elses explanations
than to come up with your own.  That\'s why mnost folks wants there
to be as few holes in rules and background as possible.  Of course,
I also want to be able to insert my own twists to everything, if for
no other reason than to keep the well read Travellers off balance.

Back to Terraforming and the large number of systems with planets
more Earthlike than they should be...

We all come up with handwaves for the occasional world, but when
there are *lots* of them it gets to be something of a problem,
right?  So, assuming some *ultra-high* TL culture decided for some
unknown reason to terraform worlds what would they do?

For example how *could* they produce worlds...

 too warm for their size, star and orbit?

 with dense breathable atmospheres when they are too small, large,
 young, or old?

That\'s one Loren will have to answer.

FWIW the TML heavily influenced BITS decision to start making adventure
books around the size of the old LBBs. These first two are the toe in the
water. If they come across I assume they\'ll end up around the price of the
101s (as we will sell them at the same price £5 GBP which translates to $8
USD IIRC).

Of course if sales are good you\'ll see more of these. They have GT/T4 stats
as standard, and notes on how to convert to CT/MT/TNE, plus the unified
task system I posted a while ago (slightly rejigged to make the % chances
between each game similar).

I\'ll admit to it, and my players know I do it. It also affects freebie
points at the end of the game, as I reward players on both playing in
character /and/ developing plausible suspension of disbelief. And penalize
munchkins who point out paradox for no purpose other than being a nuisance.

In Storyteller\'s WoD this is accentuated by the "Reality is Perception"
theory, which I have always used to different extremes, even in sci-fi
games.

In Traveller, I would award for gaming props like maps, deckplans, beastiary
entries, etc. Does anyone else award for non-chr oriented input? Dis-like
it? Have other ideas?

Note: Although I have played Traveller alot, I have never arbitrated. The
systems I have arbitrated are: AD&D, Star Wars, Twilight 2k, Amber Diceless,
and Storyteller. I won\'t bother listing what I have played. I have noticed
that some games are distinctly different in the way one must handle chrs and
game play, most obvious being Amber vs Anything. Since I only have
experience under one Traveller arbiter, what would mebers of the list
believe to be the primary differences from other systems in handling game
play?

  I can think of several ways that could be abused (having tried to design a
fleet based on a similar scam^h^h principle). At the very least a requirement
would be needed that the J-1 drives would have to be of a high enough TL that
the combos J-# would have been allowable.

  TCS has basic rules on linking ships\' controls for Jumps, but it doesn\'t
allow J-drive linkages; the strong implication is that it\'s impractical.

Might be something on http://www.pbem.com.

Way I handle things is, I set up a couple mailing lists.  I run 2 groups, so 
I have 3 lists.  I use 1 list for each \'session\' and the other one for 
announcements, rules changes, etc.  I use Onelist for this.  
(http://www.onelist.com)  So far, it works pretty good.

As to how I play, I have my players post to the game list they\'re on with 
what they want their characters to say and do.  I run the NPCs of course.  If 
I need a dice roll, I ask the player to use an email dice server at 
http://www.pbm.com and have it send the results to the list.  Since I set up 
the dice server to be able to *send* to the lists but not *recieve* from 
them, it works out pretty good.  I try to post as little as possible to the 
lists, as I believe I\'m just laying out the background and such and that it\'s 
really the *players\'* game.

It\'s a lot of work sometimes, but I think it\'s worth it.  I wouldn\'t get the 
chance to play otherwise.

Yup.  This is how I do it.  And it tends to crank the workload up a bit on 
the day to day end of things.

I had the chance to play in an ICQ game, but my ICQ client is a clone that 
doesn\'t work too well with the real thing.

I agree, it\'s annoying.  I haven\'t decided whether I want to keep
the popup, or go with the delay page; I can\'t decide which is
less offensive.  But the come.to URL is just to nice to give up

Essentially, yes.  But the come.to URL is guaranteed to point to
the current site, even if it needs to get moved for whatever
reason (as it has several times in the past).

I haven\'t checked yet (I believe that currently, there\'s a delay

Um, not necessarily, in a frames-supporting browser (which most

You have the GeoGuide instead, which must be at the top of the
page, and is about the same size as the popup at other places.
Only marginally better, IMO.

There will always be a disadvantage to a free service, unless it
is specifically being subsidized for some specific purpose of the
owner/operator by some other service - or by the o/o\'s other
income.  That represents my understanding of the present state of
Downport; it\'s also the current state of Execnet.  GeoCities, V3,
Xoom, and so on are all trying to make the free service pay for
itself the same way free TV pays for itself - by selling
advertising.  Someone has to make the choice as to whether the
penalty of having commercials displayed along with the show is
worth the exposure for the show.  That\'s the decision I need to
make now, and which I am in the process of making.

Sounds like Storyteller ethics. Thanks for the info, I\'ll be following those

I\'d go with the delay screen, for the same reason I went with the
GeoGuide banner on my GeoCities site.  The delay scren, once you\'ve
passed through it, has the decency to stay out of your way.  The pop-ups
jump back up as you navigate through the site.  (At least they do on
GeoCities et al.)

Nope.  The final product of the kind of stuff that would be
thrashed out in TDR would certainly be welcome in Freelance
Traveller\'s "Doing It My Way" section, though.

Freelance Traveller was originally conceived of as a "magazine"
for Traveller fans, without discriminating as to milieu or system
(except that I don\'t consider "Traveller 2300", the original name
of what eventually became 2300AD, to be Traveller). Later, I
decided that rather than just a magazine, it should be a
"resource" for Traveller, with more than just the stuff that
you\'d find in a print magazine.  While I\'ve moved in that
direction (the Computer Connection was the first significant
step), there\'s more to come, waiting on time (for me to do it)
and technical availability (things like CGI scripts, FrontPage
components, java applets and javascripts, and so on).  I have
hopes, but I suspect that my "goal" will move farther away every
time I take a step toward it.  Which is good, in a way, because
it means that I\'ll always have that next step to take, which will
make the site better.  I\'m currently averaging over 100 hits per
week, which was something of a milestone; I\'m now beginning to
look at the possibility of 150 per week - but I know that I can\'t
do it with just more of the same.  Time is the key, and as long
as people are willing to keep coming, and keep waiting, and keep
writing, I\'m willing to cram occasional 32-hour days into 24
hours, so I can make the site better.

I\'d feel better if I got the occasional feedback and/or
suggestion, though - direct via email, until I have time to get
the forms working...

In case anyone is interested I have the \'official\' picture of the CG pogo 
stick on my site. It is \'official\' because Roderick Elliot himself gave it 
a blessing almost two years ago. Follow the sig below to the BSSHTS page. 
One of these days I really must update that page to the 1120s.

(Yes, I read KoDT on occasion....)

ObTrav:  Were the KoDT folks to try their hand at Traveller, I expect
that we would see characters rolled up as per Book 4 or Book 5, but with
one term in either the Scouts or the Merchant service.  And, wouldn\'t
ya\' know it, all the characters (except maybe Sara\'s) would end up with
starships from mustering out....

Hi Jesse, I know this is a bit later in the week, but how about recreating

But as I noted in the part you didn\'t quote the *question* was "what is
the justification for THE RULES saying the unstreamlined ships can\'t
land on planets with atmospheres?"

That means that it *can\'t* be GURPS that\'s being talked about. Of
course that should have *also* clued people in that a lot of *other*
things brought up in the discussion weren\'t relevant either. :-(

Short answer. They *can\'t*.

Long answer, they could, but only via means which will be *glaringly*
obvious. For example, *large* mirrors in strategicly placed "orbits".
Or massive installations on the planet that tap internal heat. Or just
lots and lots of "heater" type installations, scattered across the
planet. 

The energy to *stay* warm over millenia has to come *from* somewhere.

>  with dense breathable atmospheres when they are too small, large,
>  young, or old?

Atmosphere rentention depends on *how long* you want the atmosphere
retained. As noted in other posts, Luna could probably retain a
breathable atmosphere for more than 100,000 years. A "mere" 10,000 is
easy. So that takes care of "too small". 

Too large, well, once you get *rid* of the extra, the planet doesn\'t
really have any means of *getting* more. 

Too young? The atmosphere wuill be thicker, and still have most of its
hydrogen (as methane, ammonia and water on planets small enough for us
to care about). A bit of seeding with the right organisms and the
composition will be "corrected".

 2 NH3 -> N2 + 3 H2
 2 H2O + CH4 -> CO2 + 4 H2
 
The above are "net" reactions. The actual intermediate steps get messy.
*real* messy if lifeforms are involved.

Though if you go in for "mega engineering" you can haul astronomical
amounts of oxygen from elsewhere and dump it on the planet somehow.
Then you get this.

3 O2 + 4 NH3 -> 2 N2 + 6 H2O
2 O2 + CH4 -> CO2 + 2 H2O

Too old? Atmosphere *does* tend to leak away after billions of years.
So you haul in some comets to replenish things. Actually a *lot* of
comets.

And if an atmosphere isn\'t breathable, you seed lifeforms to convert
the N2/CO2 to N2/O2.

Just a couple of notes. 35kHz is getting up near the point where sound
won\'t travel through air anymore. 

Also, *some* humans can hear in the upper ranges. Children who\'ve had
asthma can hear up to 30kHz (maybe more). I know from *personal*

PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS.

Once the books are out (which should be Thursday in limited numbers) they
will be available for distributers.

I commented earlier that SJ Games do not normally do adventures because if
you look at their catalogue you will see this to be the case. However, SJ
Games do not normally carry other people\'s products, which they do for
BITS.  So the best approach is to be calm and wait a little.

Once the books are out it may be worth making a polite enquiry to their
mail order side if they are getting them in.

BUT PLEASE DO NOT SPAM SJG, AND DEFINITELY DO NOT EMAIL THEM SAYING "WHY
AREN\'T YOU STOCKING THESE BOOKS" BECAUSE IT ISN\'T APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.

Naturally, if we are asked to supply them we will let you know.

Thanks,

Dom

Yep, it\'s still there, unchanged since I wrote the darn thing nigh-on 
2 or 3 years ago. Updating it is on the "list of things to do when I have
free time", which with a one-year-old, is, of course, never.

Here\'s a question: having finally gotten the PalmPilot version of gcc up
and running, does anyone on this list own a PalmOS device? Any interest in
a sector viewer for the Palm? Any input on what version of Traveller it
should support - the plain CT/MT info or should I run out and get First
In to add all that funky G:T stuff in instead?

Disclaimer: This is just an idea. No promises.

SJG is starting to carry several other companies\' products through their
new Warehouse 23 catalog. (http://www.warehoue23.com)  Right now, in
addition to BITS, they are selling Atlas Games and Cheepass Games products.
 

There needs to be a distinction drawn between what SJG produces themselves
and what they sell through Warehouse 23.  SJG does not produce GURPS
adventures because they have historically sold very badly.  However,
through Warehouse 23, SJG seems to have no problem selling adventures
produced by other companies. For example, Warehouse 23 offers all of Atlas
Games\' Cyberpunk adventures (for the RTal Cyberpunk game, not GURPS).  In
fact, it looks like once they decide to carry a specific manufacturer in
Warehouse 23, they carry all of their products.  So I think it\'s almost
certain that they will carry the new BITS adventures.

There is an e-mail link on the Warehouse 23 home page for suggestions on
products they should carry, but as Dom says, it\'s probably best to wait and
see what happens when the books are actually released and available.

(Dom, you might want to drop them a line, just so the Warehouse 23 people
know these books exist.)

Is it in your browser?  No one else has ever told me they didn\'t see
anything.

Did you also try REFRESH a few times?  Geocities has been having problems I
think as the other day I had to refreh my own site 5 times before it all
came up.  This is a recent problem too.

I guess I was confused about _which_ rules you were talking about. I dare
say I wasn\'t the only person confused either. (Not a criticism, more a plea
for clarity.)


Just to clarify things (before my morning coffee):

Streamlined Ships: No one has a problem with them entering atmoshere at
high speeds. They\'re designed for it.

Partly Streamlined Ships: Note that this includes the GURPS Traveller USL
(unstreamlined) configuration. They aren\'t optimized for atmospheric work,
but have centre of mass/centre of thrust aligned so that they _can_ travel
in an atmosphere. Their control computers are programmed to allow this. Not
nearly as maneuverable as a streamlined ship, and the referee should
definately require piloting skill checks, especially in high-speed and
heavy weather situations.

Unstreamlined Ships: Note that this catagory is basically open frame and
planetoid hull forms, although really asymmetric designs should also be
classed this way. Atmospheric resistance has been totally ignored when
designing them. Even if their engines can support them, turbulence will be
a real danger: any attempt to enter an atmosphere should require amazing
piloting rolls, and there\'s a large chance of damage to struts, antennas,
and so on.

You (Leonard) were talking about the third catagory (unstreamlined), not
the second (USL hull code from GURPS Traveller). Have I got that right?

Well, that\'s a little different - when you _pay_, you can get all
sorts of perqs.  I\'ll have to see if V3 still offers the low-cost
option, and what the price is if they do; it may be a way to go.

And your evidence for this is...? Sorry, but I don\'t recall anything

Morale is more of a question of feeling you need to fight as opposed to a
straight question of thinking you\'ve got a chance of winning. As an example
consider American Indians; Usually technologically outclassed and facing a
war against the US army. They fought because they had to to survive, not
because they knew they could win.
As a counter example consider Yossarian from Catch 22, "I agree that the war
has to be fought, I also agree that to fight the war somebody is going to
have to die, I just don\'t see why that somebody has to be me." I\'m sure I
just mangled the quote, Heller forgive me, but that\'s the gist of the
argument.

I\'d say off-board as well. As an aside I wonder at what point with all the
EW, ECM, ECCM, Radio, radar, etc, polluting the battlefield it would become
functionally imposible to get a usefull commo signal through and everybody
will have to make do with runners and semaphore for command & control?

Oops, sorry I wasn\'t particularly clear in this post perhaps a few examples
are in order. The values in the charts are per soldier so

US army sqaud c.-2575
1 SMG (FP 1, DAM 2, RNG 1)
1 Auto Rifle (FP1, DAM 3, RNG 6)
8 SA Rifle (FP.5, DAM 3, RNG 6)
Squad Totals FP 6, DAM 3 (well 2.8333 but round to nearest) RNG 5

close but not quite standard SL

now try a TL8 Squad I used for a merc battalion once
3 Laser Carbine (FP .5, DAM 5, RNG 4)
6 Assault Rifles (FP 1, DAM 2, RNG 4)
Squad FP 8, DAM 3, RNG 4

Etc.
The key to decifering this mess (and giving umph to lasers)
does indeed lie with the assumptions behind the AHL rules.
a brief summary follows.

In AHL you roll to hit and then roll for damage. AHL was a board game
depicting boarding actions on an imperial cruiser,and it abstarcts damage a
bit differently than the standard rules. After a hit is scored roll two
dice, add the damage value of your weapon, and subtract the armor value of
the target. The result is compared to a chart that gives varied damage
levels, No wound, light, serious, and death. No wound results are rare in
the absence of high armor vs low damage factors. The damage factors from the
chart are the ones I took from AHL.

When converting this to SL values I made a couple of value judgements. The
first being that FP reflects the posibility of causing a wound regardless of
how severe.
So a laser carbine has the same wound producing ability against targets in
mesh and flak armor with a steady decline in capabilities against greater
armor.
which means that lasers will be beter combat weapons against armor than
assault rifles which are better weapons against unarmored targets.

OTOH your approach is much simpler, and therefor much more generally
usefull.
{I seem to have an in built need to make things more complicated than they
otherwise ought to be.}

Perhaps TL+Fwrd Obsrv skill or less on 3D. This is more of a question of how
good the sensors on the warhead are I think.

In general good numbers, Perhaps tough you should split the squads with
higher FP into teams at half the Listed FP. Or even deploy battle dress
equipped P/FGMP as individual hero types with a FP of 4/6? or else you\'ll
need to add several cols. to the IFT (for 72,144, etc fp)

In general I don\'t think there\'s a wrong way to go about the conversion of
SL for traveller. Either keep things simple and abstract or glomb on bells
or whistles as suits your needs, SL is a reasonably ellegant system that can
take a lot of tinkering.

In general PC\'s should be deployed as individual hero counters with
apropriate weapons (That\'s one of the reasons my charts were given per
weapon instead of per squad) Although a PC should always rate at least 1 FP
And 1 RNG even if the carry a single shot snub pistol with Tranq ammo. IMHO.

I\'ll Keep thinking about this, and how to convert other rule systems into SL
terms but
I probably can\'t keep up with the list on a daily basis for a few weeks.
Please do not be offended if I don\'t get back on the questions that are
raised by my lack of technical communications skills.

Absolutely, but think "out of the human-level box" for a minute.
You\'re considering what a TL15 culture might be able to do, but I\'m
not talking about Traveller level technologies here.  I\'m talking
about tech as far beyond Grandfather\'s tech as he is beyond ours.
What might TL30, 35, 40+ cultures be able to do?  We can only
imagine.
  
Traveller tech barely acknowledges...
  controlled antimatter,
  force fields (black/white globes),
  matter transmitters,
  pocket universes.

Traveller tech doesn\'t ever seem to have...
  extensive use of nanotech,
  stable wormholes,
  catalyzed matter/energy conversion.

Not saying I\'d use such, but consider these "sufficiently high tech
as to be magic" ideas...

Put one end of tiny stable wormholes inside a gas giant\'s atmosphere
and the other ends somewhere on (or under) the surface of a small
planet.  Now you have an almost endless supply of atmosphere
supplied by gravitational pressure...and a lot of heat too.
Discoverable?  Possibly, but this might look a lot like natural
outgassing if the ends were deep under the surface, and even if
discovered what are the odds they could figured out a TL40 device?

Reverse it for a massive atmosphere planet and vent the atmosphere
somewhere(s) with lower pressure.  Now you have two (or more) places
where their pressure equalizes to more manageable levels.

Implant matter conversion devices throughout a small planet\'s core.
They run, like a therostat, just enough converting matter to energy
to keep the core molten.  Core stays hot, plate tectonics continue
much longer than they should, magnetic fields exist, atmosphere
continues to outgas and be recycled long after a marginal planet
should have shut down.  To discover them you\'d have to get into the
core...

...see? 

I\'ll let others imagine how nanotech, the ability to pinch off
pocket universes and freely manipulate force fields might be used.

I\'d never give the PC\'s unlimited (or even limited in most cases)
access to *any* of the above technologies, but deep background you
never know what might have happened hundreds of thousands of years
ago.

The TL15 Imperium *might* be able to figure out how some of this was
happening, but not how to duplicate or control the processes.
Frankly, if my poor little TL8 brain can imagine things like this,
what a TL40+ society might be able to *do* could be simply beyond my
(or the 3I\'s) imagination.

Right!  I don\'t think we have any reason to worry about it.  I\'d be
very surprised if SJG doesn\'t continue stocking BITS books.  By all
accounts, the BITS books *have* sold well for SJG.  They don\'t have
to sink any production costs in them either, so BITS sales should be
a high profit item for SJG.  It only makes sense that they will want
to give the new BITS products a try.  They\'ll order a few to "test
the market", if nothing else, like with their first order.

From everything I\'ve read it isn\'t that SJ(and SJGG) doesn\'t *like*
adventures.  I think he/they do, but in the past the adventures
books they have produced haven\'t sold as profitablely as other types
of books.  SJG has to make a profit, so lower profit adventure
books are going to be a lower priority than higher profit
products...right?

Hopefully, the BITS line will continue to sell well.  As long as they
do SJG will naturally want more.  If we continue to support their
Traveller line with our dollars, SJG might even become interested in
producing Traveller adventures of their own...you never know. <g>

Oh, and about Loren...didn\'t he write recently that he was reading
the TML, but couldn\'t post (or didn\'t have time to post), something
like that?

PalmPilot Professional linked to a Mac at home and an NT4 box at work. ie

I would prefer to see CT/MT style info. And I would happily put it on my

FWIW GoLive (ex-Cyberstudio) 4.0 recommends 580 width max to ensure 14"
monitors can see the whole page. Something that I admittedly did not put
into practice for BITS\' site.

Website Update:
- ----
The BITS website has been updated with the two new adventures, the Khiidkar
Incident & SpaceDogs, being added to the products page. If you\'re
interested in what the covers will look like, check out the thumbnail
scans, and also Jesse Degraff\'s  first version of the cover for SpaceDogs
at http://www.vision-forge-graphics.com/  This does more justice for the
art than the thumbnail!

GenCon UK 99:
- ----
Two days to go! Anyone here going who wants to run/play Traveller, look up
the BITS stand (by Brittania Games, the Chivalry & Sorcery 3rd Ed
publishers) and sign up for a game.

Anyway - we\'re running three tournaments this year -

"Delta 3 is Down" - Zhodani/Imperial interactions in the Spinward Marches
Frontier.
Thursday 1500hrs, Slot 6

"The Return of the SpaceDogs" - Our Vargr heroes are called upon to save
Little Heaven once again ion this sequel to last year\'s tournament (which
is also on sale as a scenario as one of our new releases).
Saturday 1500 hrs, Slot 14

"Traveller Fun" - Another Traveller SciFi tongue in cheek adventure
following on from last years \'Star Worn\' and 96\'s \'White Dwarf\'.
Sunday 1000hrs, Slot 17

So feel free to sign up and play! If you fancy GMing, give me a yell...

We\'ll also have the new releases, plus all the earlier 101 Books, the promo
T-shirts, mice mats and stuff that are left and the BITS second hand
Traveller Stockpile.

The reason I did that was because I run at 1280x1024 native resolution and
people who cruised my site were complaining it was all screwed up on their
lower res screens.  The only thing that helped this was my forcing them into
a 640x480 format.  Believe me, I\'d rather NOT do this..but then the site
doesn\'t look like anything but mashed up garbage.

I\'ve designed my site with users in mind, which is why you will find VERY
few graphics on it, no Java or Java script; to save on load times.
Geocities still squeezes its java applet in though.  I also used to have
MIDIs embedded but removed them when users asked me to.  Later I realized
myself how annoying that stuff is.

Oh, sorry I misunderstood you.  I can send the source to you if you\'d like.
No biggie to me although I know some people are xenophobic about viewing
their source.

Good.  I hate those pop-ups.  Very annoying.

	You shouldn\'t have to specify width at all in tables. Or, if needed,
specify it in % instead of pixels. That way, it won\'t matter if users
are running at 640x480, 1280x1024, or even using their palm pad ...

Jory, the midi\'s themselves aren\'t usually annoying...as long as the
user has the *option* of playing or not playing them.  It\'s the
sites that force you to listen, don\'t let you turn off the sound, or
even adjust the volume that bug the heck out of me.

If I ever run across some sound I\'d like to put on my site, I\'ll
attach it to a button and let the user click it *if* they want to
hear the sound.

OK, so Travellers travel and Imperial Marines are more interested
in blowing things up than in building them; but for those who do
world building, once you\'ve build your world, what are people
going to do there, and where and how are they going to live while
they are doing it? Within the last month, someone mentioned
roughnecks in space, and more recently artificial gravity and
space stations. The topic of SF architecture has been tickling
the back of my mind lately, so I thought I\'d start to sketch out
some construction rules.

Places where a GM\'s imagination can use an extra boost might
include:

1) Worlds with inhospitable conditions:
     Water worlds, desert worlds, tainted atmosphere, low
atmosphere, vacuum, very cold, very hot worlds.
2) Orbital architecture
     Highports, orbital colonies, belters, asteroid hull ships.
3) Special purposes
     Agriculture in hostile environments, spaceports,
construction in hostile environments, communications arrays,
mining and manufacturing, military bases, public buildings.

Some things to be considered:
1) Construction
     a) Materials types and costs
     b) Labor costs
     c) Construction machinery costs
2) Living space
     a) Living space requirements (area and volume)
     b) Access space (corridors etc.)
     c) entrances, exits, and windows
     d) Furniture and furnishings
3) Life support.
     a) Food requirements
     b) Water requirements (Drinking and other purposes)
     c) Air circulation (Oxygen supply, waste gas removal)
     d) Heating and cooling
     e) Gravity (rotation vs artificial)
     f) Waste disposal
     g) radiation protection
4) Environmental protection
     a) Filters and respirators
     b) Environmental suits
     c) cleaning, repair, maintenance of these
5) Building equipment
     a) Plumbing & ventilation
     b) Communications
     c) Power
     d) Moving machinery (e.g. elevators)
     e) Other machinery (e.g. maintenance robots)
6) Facilities
     a) Emergency and medical
     b) Sports, recreation, entertainment
7) working facilities
     depend on building\'s purpose.
8) Maintenance:
     a) cleaning
     b) Equipment maintenance

I have FF&S 1 and 2, and some of these are already at least
partly covered in those sources, but not to my satisfaction. I
hope to be posting some of my own ideas and asking questions.
Since I\'m going to school right now and have other commitments,
it will probably take a while to develop some of these ideas, but
there should be plenty of potential for discussion here. Some of it should
even be useful. <g>

Normally I\'d point you at the Ships of the Interstellar Wars part of my
website. However, it appears to be down right now (I\'m looking into
alternatives). Still, if you\'d like I can bundle up the source text files and
send them to you.

That\'s just it.  I kep running into sites where they\'ve hid the MIDI control
panel.  Or I\'ll be listening to MP3s, hit a site, and BOOM..such a
dis-harmonious cacophony it makes your ears twinge in despair.  :)

You don\'t actually need TL15 to do the initial terraforming; you can
probably start it at TL10 and go from there. Nor is there a problem
keeping them warm over millennia. Once you\'ve got them warm to start
with - via ZS terraforming, Ancient manipulation or any of Eris\' nifty
ideas (which I may be forced to steal for a campaign of my own :) ), the
thermal inertia in a system will make them lose heat relatively slowly
over periods of tens of thousands of years.

During the final attack towards Earth, Lyta and Garibaldi go out onto
the surface wearing breathers and cold weather gear. At present, Mars\'
atmosphere is <1% that of Earth, and you would need a pressure suit to
go outside. The fact they can go outside without the suits implies a
much thicker atmosphere than at present.

If you don\'t mind them having been designed using FFS1 I have a stack of TL9

I actually do have more ships and other equipment but have not got round to

Seems to me that the problem you pose falls into three groups:

(1) Conventional surface structures, perhaps with features like filters and
overpressure for tainted atmospheres
(2) Sealed structures (like spacecraft), whether free-floating or on the
surface
(3) Subsurface construction, which combines aspects of the first two with
excavation

>Some things to be considered:

For sealed structures, use the existing spacecraft construction rules of
your choosing as a base, with whatever cheap options you can employ. Good
planetoid hull rules might let you expand to subsurface construction.

For conventional surface structures, there are a couple of useful
references. The best are /Time Saver Standards for Building Types/, a
series of books for professional architects that give them the basics and
design parameters for unfamiliar building types (e.g., an architect with
experience in schools is called on to design an apartment building).
Another is the /Unified Building Code/ (for Yanks -- I don\'t know what the
rest of the world uses), which lists things like acceptable thicknesses for
concrete slabs. I have found both of these in mediocre-to-poor public
libraries.

There is also a series of books, the name of which escapes me (Mann\'s?),
that gives estimates for building costs on a per-square foot basis every
year, plus historical data. These are great, and are available online, but
at $150 apiece you won\'t find them outside an architect\'s office.

Best reference here is /Space Settlements, A Design Study/ (NASA SP-413)
and it\'s successors (/Space Resources and Space Settlements/, NASA SP-428),
which may still be on sale from the US Gov\'t Printing Office or available
from various space advocacy groups. The appendices list the numbers the
study used; the main text describes one approach to building space
habitats. They may be a little dated by now, but the data is still useful.
More recent material can be found in the Case for Mars books published by
the American Astronautical Society Science and Technology series (No. 74
has the very useful /Building Mars Habitats Using Local Materials/, Bruce
A. Mackenzie, AAS 87-216), or in the Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society.

For the VE2 fans out there, I recommend GURPS Architecture:

http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/2574/archt.html

This is a comprehensive building design system, modelled on GURPS Vehicles
2/e. The focus is pre-Industrial, but the coverage extends out beyond GT
tech levels (to force fields and teleporters). [Sorry -- there is a pop-up.
The information is worth the annoyance.]

Finally, GT: Starports (written by John M. Ford) is due out in November.

Sure. But even *without* getting to the core, it would be "glaringly
obvious" that there was *something* messing around with the planet. The
effects would *not* be natural.

Sure. But my point was that it\'d be obvious that there was tampering,
not that anyone could figure *how* the gizmos doing the tampering
*worked* (well they could figure out *what* it did, just not *how*).

And stumbling across a few "Forerunner" artifacts that can\'t even be
*moved*, much less taken apart ought to be good for the more "arrogant"
players.

As I said above, they could figure out *what* was happening
(teleportation, mass/energy conversion, etc), bur not *how*.

A 19th century physicist could figure out that an RTG  or even a
nuclear reactor was turning heat into electrical power. But he\'d have
*no* idea *where* the heat was coming from. 

BTW, according to speculation by Dr. Robert Forward the "best" tech to
"invent" would be something that converted angular momentum into
energy. The conversion factor is *obscene* (based on the way angular
momentum contributes to the stress-energy tensor). A barely measurable
amount of angular momentum amounts to something like several *kilos* of
mass. :-)

Yep. Since they are the only type that *any* version of the rules says
"may not enter atmosphere" about. 

And I\'d class *some* properly designed "open frame" ships as
"partially streamlined". After all there are a lot of "open frame"
objects on earth that handle strong winds ok. 

It might even be possible to design a "planetoid" type hull to land.
But that would definitely be a case of "throwing money at a problem" to
solve it. :-)

I don\'t know if anyone knows *why*. It\'s just an observed fact. 

At a guess, maybe the same genetic(?) problem that causes the lung
condition is linked to the way the inner ear works.

Interesting; the most common emails I get about the BITS website are that
it is too big for their browser to view properly. I have had one comment on
frames (and I\'ve since put in a no frames option), and one on launching the
detailed product descriptions onto new windows (deliberate to avoid people
reloading the images for the main page).

The size is the biggest issue - several people have emailed and asked me to
shrink the site in width and height (which has been done since it was
relaunched last November). The biggest problem is that several people use
browsers modified by their ISP which eats part of the screen. As a result,
the only assumptions I make now are (1) 256 colours. Workarounds are in for
(2) <800 x 600 and (3) non-Frames. At present, the BITS site is
non-Javascript (which may change).

Like it or not, HTML is moving away from the original hypertext concept to
something more akin to print press. I\'m willing to bet that most sites out
there aren\'t HTML 4 compliant...

Ideally, you need to find a way to view the screen as other users are.
Perhaps dropping the resolution just before you check the site - just a
click on the control strip. I do wonder if I should reinstall navigator 2
and try checking things at 640 x 480.

As I said, I ignored the 580 initally.

If you\'re not too violently anti-GURPS I strongly recommend you take a
look at Matt Riggsby\'s "GURPS Architecture", which can be found at
        <http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/2574/archt.html>
(the html file\'s 148k, plus another 28k of graphics).

It covers building at all TLs, although it does focus more on historical
times because of the more accurate information available. It doesn\'t go
into much detail for exotic environments (although it mentions
underwater & antigrav floating buildings), but has a lot of good general
ideas. I don\'t have FF&S but imagine you could convert the GURPS
Vehicles references to it.

To quote the author on its limitations:
"Some types of buildings are better built with Vehicles than with these
rules. Specifically, orbiting and free-floating space stations are more
properly built with Vehicles rules than with these architectural rules.
These rules are designed to represent stationary structures supported by
solid ground. A space station is simply a large vehicle with no engines
(or, more likely, very small ones for attitude control)."

	Unfortunately, it\'s still coming up completely black. Quick check
with View|Source reveals that Netscrape did in fact download the
page, as the source is there. A little more digging shows that you
set the background to black (bgcolor="#000000") ... but I don\'t see
anything where you change to _foreground_ (i.e. text) to something
other than the default ... black! At least not until a ways down the
page. However, there\'s images with ALT tags further up the page that
will wind up showing black text on black background for anybody who\'s
got images disabled. Doesn\'t explain why I can\'t see the links where
you\'ve changed the font color to something other than black though.
I\'ll have to investigate ...

	Incidentally, I don\'t see anywhere on the page that you\'ve even got
a table width set ... I\'m confused.

	That\'s my whole point--website creators shouldn\'t make *any*
assumptions about the browser. You can\'t guarantee that the user is
in your resolution, sees your colors, for that matter, you can\'t even
assume that the user can SEE! That, and the cretins who assume that
just because it loads in only five seconds on their workstation from
their hard drive, it must load just fine out at the end of a 28.8
connection ...

	Not that I\'m innocent of the crime of forcing my presentation on
others, but its still a minor pet peeve of mine and I\'m working on it

I don\'t have a PalmPilot, but a Windows CE version would be nice. And First

Ah, but Bob Forward has such wonderful Traveller ideas! It\'s nice to see
that people are finally beginning to take them seriously with the
ground-laser-powered launchers.

Living with a 31.3k at home I always check the download times.... It\'s one
of the reasons all the individual product descriptions on the BITS site
launch new windows - I was getting fed up of reloading the menubar and
products page (which is graphics heavy).

Amen, brother, amen.

During the summer I had to navigate the BITS website by guessing at
filenames, because my monitor was too small to display the entire
navigation frame. There\'s a few other Traveller websites that use
Javascript for navigation which I can\'t access, because Netscape 2* doesn\'t
run the right level of Javascript.

That doesn\'ty work for me.  This is a 19-inch monitor so lower resolutions
do not look the same as they would on a 14, 15 and 17 inch monitor at
different resolutions.

What I need is a computer with each of the sizes listed of monitor.  :)
Anyone gonna give me some?

What I did was to make a background bitmap at 1024 x 768.  I then put a
800x600 rectangle in the upper left corner and then another rectangle
(640x480) over that one.  I made the rectangles different colors so that
when I am working on a new piece of software or a web page I can put it in
the upper left and see where it would fit for various screen sizes.

later I wanted to change my background so I made little hash marks on the
edge of my frame at the appropriate locations.

	This is a very good idea.  Although I\'ve never liked the half-

	I am in full agreement.  My bias will continue to be

	your input.

	I agree, the PC has to have some potential influence or they

	personality of the PC, they might be included as a leader, a
	scout, a sniper, or a hero.  For my own purposes, I run the

	using SL.  On a larger scale, I use the "Highway to the Reich"
	rules to keep track of the battle within ~100 km (this allows

	support, etc.; not to mention connecting the PC\'s actions to
	the overall success of the military campaign.

	A nit: Canis is a genus (like Homo), the timber wolf is Canis

	IMTU, the Vargr have vision that is slightly superior to humans

	their noses more than their eyes.

I ended up reading it into word and reformatting to lose the junk and pretty it

My advice: Either maintain a printable version of the material or ensure the

actually be an advantage. Whatever, white backgrounds are a good idea anyhow.

That sounds like the energy source that "The Doctor" convinces the

It still looks pretty durn out-effing-standing, Jesse.  BTW, did you
do the background for that in LW or did you use Bryce? (I\'m betting
on Bryce.)

Speaking of Bryce, any tips on how to produce a nice lumpy, firey
meteor trail?  I\'m trying to do one right now, but it\'s turning out
to clean and lazer-like.

On a totally unrelated topic: are you coming up for the ARPC Full-Auto
Winter Fun Shoot?  It\'s fun shoot only (no interrupting competitions),
on Saturday, Dec. 11th.  If so, plan to crash at our place this time
and save on lodging expenses!

How about downloadable text files of information?  Small, simple and
readable on almost any computer.

Like if I have some charts on my site, I could have duplicates in an ASCII
text file that can be downloaded for printing.

Is this a good idea?

Oh, certainly!  Of course, they would figure out that somebody had
been mucking around with the galaxy. I\'d *want* them to worry about
it. <g>

And Nik is right too, *we* could start terraforming now, given our
level of technology, It would be a *slow* process and depend on the
sort of things you mentioned, mirrors, comets, seeding with CFC\'s to
build up greenhouse effects and perhaps with biologicals to remove
atmosphere.

Yes, I\'ve read that. I\'m sure doing something like this would violates
conservation of momentum somehow or other....doesn\'t mean I might not
stick it in a game sometime, though.

Hee! Gotta love The Doctor. <g>

It sounds awfully close to the Dean Drive, too. Dean\'s drive
supposedly converted Angular momentum to Linear momentum. This would
convert angular momentum to energy, then the energy could be used to
produce linear momentum. That\'s why I said it *must* violate the
conservation laws somehow.  It\'d be a joy if you could do it though.

You have to convince me that the buffering (turbulence or no turbulence) is
sufficient to matter; I\'ve seen no evidence that it can be sufficient to make
me care on a typical spaceship (which is huge and dense).

This is something I\'m *very* interested in. Unfortunately I will have very
little to add to this thread (my line of work is different) but I\'d like to
archive the resulting discussion and put it on my page: I\'ve created a
"Technician" career for T4
(http://www.inrete.it/games/traveller/t0005.html), and this would be
perfect background info for it. 

I\'ve always wondered why Traveller didn\'t have an option for less
combat-oriented adventure(r)s. 

BTW, I even proposed Marc Miller to include an Engineering:civil (or
something like that) in the next version of Traveller, but to no avail.

From what I recall from my CT/MT days, I thought weather control was 
established at TL8.  However, I have been wrong before, and it would 
not surprise me to find out I\'d misremembered.  I just remember 
checking for weather control starting at TL8 when generating world 
data under Grand Survey and WBH.

Of course, now I\'m using Stuart Ferris\'s fantastic World Builder 
Deluxe software, and so don\'t remember as many of those details as I 
used to.  Thanks, Stuart!

Thanks,

Loren is a *very* busy man.  I am not positive about his reading habits
when it comes to the TML (I don\'t bug him about it), but I certainly read
everything on the list.  I do keep my eyes open for interesting tidbits,
and I know how to contact my not-so-secret masters when I think that
something should be brought to their attention.

Word of warning:  Do not take this as an open invitation to send a billion
emails my direction for the future G:T.  If you spam me, I will find you
and kill you. ;)  On the other hand, I am ecstatic that SJ Games is
supporting Traveller and I want to help promote this as much as possible.
If you have an intelligent email on the subject, I am more than willing to
read it and consider passing it on or acting on it.  Just keep in mind that
Loren is the G:T line editor, and he holds ten times more weight on the
matter than I ever will.

I\'ve worked out the bugs in my Traveller Experience system, and here\'s
the write up for those interested to peruse.

This system should work well with any Traveller edition, especially CT,
MT, and T4.  You\'ll see that the system mirrors character generation in
that a PC will go up (more or less) about 1 skill level per game year
and 1 characteristic level per 4 game years.

Of course, a lot depends on your gaming style.  PCs could go up much
faster using this system--a direct reflection on the number of XP the
ref decides to award.  If your preference is faster character
improvement, simply award more XP than I do.

For better or worse, here\'s the system.

Enjoy.

Kenneth.



==============



TWEAK 15:  EXPERIENCE

Experience Points:  PCs are awarded XP at the end of every game
session.  Each skill usedwhich had an impact on the nights gaming
sessiongains 1 XP.  In special cases, the ref may award 2, or even 3,
points to a specific skill if it had a major impact on the game.
Players are encouraged to point out which skills should be awarded XP,
but refs discretion prevails over all awards.

XP are noted next to the appropriate skill.  If a PC does not actually
have the skill in question, but has earned experience against that
skill, then the skill should be placed on the PCs sheet in parentheses.




Bonus Points:  PCs can be awarded bonus XP for good role playing and
great ideas during the session.  These points can be applied towards any
skill the Player wishes, with approval of the GM.  This simulates PCs
studying skills in their spare time and Eureka! thoughts with regard to
skill improvement.  Players can direct their character\'s development
with these points.



Characteristic Experience:  PCs can gain XP towards their stats too.
Treat these like skills the PC does not yet have by recording the stat
on the PCs sheet in parentheses and noting XP next to it.



Prerequisite Points:  At the beginning of each game session, PCs are
allowed throws for skill improvement.  Any skill that has earned enough
prerequisite XP may be thrown for.

In order to throw from improvement, the skill must have earned XP equal
to the next level.

Ex:  Going from Pistol-0 to Pistol-1?  You need 1 XP.

Ex:  Going from Pilot-4 to Pilot-5?  You need 5 XP.



Improvement Throw:  A number of dice are thrown equal to the new skill
level.  Success occurs when all 6s are thrown.

Only one attempt per skill is allowed per game session, but a Player can
throw on as many eligible skills as he chooses.

Ex:  Trying to go from Pistol-0 to Pistol-1?  You throw 1D.  Success
occurs on a throw of 6.

Ex:  Trying to go from Pilot-4 to Pilot-5?  You throw 5D.  Success
occurs on a throw of 30.



INT Bonuses:  +1 DM if INT 5-9.  +2 DM if INT 10-14.  +3 DM if INT 15.

Ex:  On the Pistol throw above, success occurs on a 5 or 6 if the PC has
INT 7.

Ex:  On the Pilot throw above, success occurs on a total of 28+ if the
PC has INT 13.



XP Bonuses:  Bonuses to the throw can also be obtained by spending extra
XP.  Using Double the amount of required XP nets a +1 DM on the throw.
Triple the amount of required XP nets a +2 DM on the throw, and so on.



Cost of Trying:  Every time a skill increase is attempted and fails, the
cost for trying is 1 XP from that skills total.  All other XP are kept.

If a skill is improved, all XP are wiped out.  The new skill begins anew
sans any XP from the previous level.



Level 0 Skills:  If an attempt made to gain a skill at level 1 fails, a
second throw for improvement is allowed free of cost.  If this second
attempt is successful, the PC gains the skill at level 0.  (Only
attempts for level 1 skills).



Experience Limit:  We use a modification of the Experience Limit rule
listed on pg. 30 of MT.

If a PCs total skill levels do not exceed (INT + EDU), then
prerequisite points remain as stated above.

If a PCs total skill levels are (INT + EDU) > 2 x (INT + EDU), then
prerequisite points are doubled.

If a PCs total skill levels are 2 x (INT + EDU) > 3 x (INT + EDU), then
prerequisite points are tripled, and so on.

Bonuses derived from additional XP are subject to the same figuring, but
INT bonuses remain the same.

Since it gets harder to improve the more skills a PC earns, Players
should be strategic in throwing for improvement for specific skills.  In
this fashion, Players can mold their characters, and some skills will
remain unimproved while XP build up (potential is there for the PC to
improve, but he is not applying himself in that direction).



Characteristic Increases:  Characteristics are treated like skills with
regard to experience and improvement.

I\'ve worked out the bugs in my Traveller Experience system, and here\'s
the write up for those interested to peruse.

<P>This system should work well with any Traveller edition, especially
CT, MT, and T4.&nbsp; You\'ll see that the system mirrors character generation
in that a PC will go up (more or less) about 1 skill level per game year
and 1 characteristic level per 4 game years.

<P>Of course, a lot depends on your gaming style.&nbsp; PCs could go up
much faster using this system--a direct reflection on the number of XP
the ref decides to award.&nbsp; If your preference is faster character
improvement, simply award more XP than I do.

<P>For better or worse, here\'s the system.

<P>Enjoy.

<P>Kenneth.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<P>==============
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<P>TWEAK 15:&nbsp; EXPERIENCE

<P>Experience Points:&nbsp; PCs are awarded XP at the end of every game
session.&nbsp; Each skill usedwhich had an impact on the nights gaming
sessiongains 1 XP.&nbsp; In special cases, the ref may award 2, or even
3, points to a specific skill if it had a major impact on the game.&nbsp;
Players are encouraged to point out which skills should be awarded XP,
but refs discretion prevails over all awards.

<P>XP are noted next to the appropriate skill.&nbsp; If a PC does not actually
have the skill in question, but has earned experience against that skill,
then the skill should be placed on the PCs sheet in parentheses.

Success occurs on a throw of 30.
&nbsp;

That is totally bizarre, I see everything fine in IE 5.0 and NS 4.6..

The background is supposed to be black, but the links are RED and visited
links are in light blue;

Text is that off-orangish color.

You can\'t create a popup window without javascript, frames doesn\'t support
it.  You can, of course, create a frame containing advertisement without a
popup window, but that\'s much easier to ignore, particularly if you also
turn off image loading.

That\'s why the site now has a no-frames option plus the index page (which
you can reach by clicking on the main logo) which can get you everywhere on
the site... I haven\'t implemented any javascript for the same reason...

They should display the same widths ie by dropping the number of pixels
available to 640 you will see the same as a user with 640 by 480. The
number of pixels displayed is tied to the graphics card more than the
monitor now - for example, my Apple 15"AV Multisync will display from 640
by 480 in millions of colours to 1024 x 768 in 256 colours. This is
governed by the video RAM (1Mb).

Changing the Display in Windows 95/98/NT should have the same effect as
using a lower res machine.
On the Mac use the Monitors & Sound control panel or the control strip
module on OS>7.5

>What I need is a computer with each of the sizes listed of monitor.  :)
>Anyone gonna give me some?

This isn\'t going to be a lot of use as the monitor physical tube size is
pretty much separated from the resolution. If you display 640 x 480 on a
19" monitor it has the same number of dots/pixels as a 14" monitor, but has
them in a bigger space ie each pixel is bigger.

Yes, or an Acrobat file if formatting is important. RTF (Rich Text) is also
okay. But don\'t use a format like Word 97/00 because it means you limit
your audience to those with the same software.

Noted - I originally had the black stripe as part of a background
image, but Netscape has a bug in it that sometimes resulted in
the black stripe encroaching into the body text. I changed it to
the present arrangement as the next-best option to preserve the
look I wanted, while avoiding Netscape bugs.

I really don\'t want to go to frames; there are enough people that
still object to them, and there are still enough browsers out
there that don\'t support them.

It\'s not a _bad_ one - but bear in mind that space is an issue,
and every text file I have on the site is essentially one more
page\'s worth of space taken up - that I can\'t use for other
content.  At Downport, this isn\'t a problem - at the moment; who
can say what the future holds - but at the mirror, and at any
other sites where I might maintain an archive or mirror, space
limitations come into play, and rather quickly.  I have to decide
whether "total accessibility" or content is king, and, quite
frankly, I lean toward content.  I don\'t think, for example, that
FT is _unusable_ for Lynx users, but I don\'t design with Lynx in
mind, and I\'m fairly sure that there will be some material that\'s
just not readable with Lynx.

GT p107 indicates that Artificial gravity appears 2 TLs early in Traveller,
at GTL 8.  Artificial gravity includes inertial compensators, so no
additional systems are required.

THey were... Cliff, Leroy and Phil were gearheads, jerks, and
rules-uber-alles flame-mongers.  Leroy at least had some good ideas, if you
could get pas t the personaltiy he presented.

My hostility towards GT is more a matter of the sweeping (but oft subtle)
revisions and ignoring of prior (CT, to be specific, ALL GDW CT) canon.
That, and finding it to be very much suffering from a variety of GURPS
approaches instead of Traveller approaches to subsystems.

>GT seems a worthy heir to CT, at least as good

>the atrocity TNE made of the OTU.

Arguable there... The "Bad Dream" approach and the whole GT phenomena (I\'ve
been opposed to GT since SJG\'s first offer posted to the list what, 4 years
ago? For exactly the reasons I dislike the current edition. Which I have,
have read, and dislike... I\'m not slamming it unread...):
	It changes several items of cannon.
	It is not compatable with other editions mechanically (Nor was TNE,
but hey, I hate TNE\'s mechanics...).
	It lacks the conflict inherent in the Rebellion or 5FW settings;
conflict integral to the style of games I run.
	The writing style does not feel "travelleresque" to me.*

I dislike TNE for many of the same reasons: it changes or ignores whole
swaths of cannon, is not compatable with prior editions, and has rules that
do not support a travelleresque feel, IMHO and IMExperience, as player and
GM.

* And as for that BD in GT:SM, the untravelleresque label was general
discussion, not my descision/label along. more than 15K of commentary
appeared on the lsit recently about it.

Actually, HTML 4.0 Rec specifies that a frame targeted that doesn\'t exist
should be created as an independant frame, above the parent frame. I\'ve
managed to get this to work under NS 4.01. Similar in result to IE\'s IFRAME
tag.

Thanks for the sources. I\'ll try to have a look at some of these
as time permits. Some of the stuff in the architecture and NASA
sources ought to be extracted for the benefit of the gearhead-
minded.

The vehicle design sequences in FFS 1&2 work up to a point, but
they do assume everything is working well. For abnormal and
emergency situations (leaks in environmental containment,
imbalance in life support, power failures, supply shortages,
damage repair, etc), they are entirely inadequate. Also, they
give no clue about how long it takes to build them.

I have mixed feelings about relying too heavily on GURPS
material, especially if I haven\'t seen it. Architecture and
Starports (when it comes out) may have some of the answers.

Yup, that was precisely my intent with the original question.  I wanted to 
know about CT/MT/T4 ships.  I\'m for the most part comfortable with the how 
and why of GT.

yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!!!!!!  To all those!!!! :)

Seriously, being an owner of a Palm 3, I\'d love to see any and all kinds of 
gaming programs ported to this platform.  Since it\'s inconvenient for us to 
have a PC in the room we game in, all these wonderful support tools out 
there are only really useful between sessions.  I\'ve written some very 
basic stuff for my TI-85, but it\'s capabilities are quite limited, and 
tackling the development of stuff on a new platform is beyond my current 
capabilities.

As to specifics, being a GT player I\'m naturally prejudiced in that 
direction...  However, what I _really_ would love to see is support for Far 
Trader commerce data.

But again, _any_ gaming tools for the Palm (or even pointers to them) would 
be greatly appreciated.

I\'ve looked at the code that V3 puts up (I don\'t know about other versions, 
but Netscape 4.61 let\'s you scroll left/right in "View source" 
mode....)  And All that\'s on the page is the JS for the pop-up, and a 
meta-redirect tag.  This is about what I expected.  Unfortunately, the 
redirect doesn\'t work for some reason.  I think it may be malformed, but I 
don\'t have the time to check right now...

Hee hee, actually that\'s in Lightwave.  You can actually do very nice
landscapes in Lightwave, it\'s just not quite as easy (dare I say drag and

Uhhhhh.....no clue.  I\'m a Bryce newbie.  I know almost nothing about it.
I\'ll forward this to work and one of my buddies who\'s more of a Brycer than
I am.  There\'s also some really killer tutorial links out there that he\'s
found, plus a spacey article in one of the 3D magazines some time ago that I
might be able to dig up and scan for you.

But that does present a major problem, especially with small text (like

The TNE guy seconds that.  Although it wasn\'t what I expected.  Gets in
pretty heavy into the sociology, which was an entertaining suprise, while
still giving a cordial nod to the science.  Real fun equipment too.  I still
have reservations about FT, \'cause IMHO some of their economics is a little
shady and/or...shall I say...conservative?  But I would still say pick FT up
because it gets into the "environmental" aspects of what the Traveller
universe is all about extremely well.

    And, yet the idea is canon.  *weg*  Sorry, "Death of the Singing Star",

How about changing resolutions and then

(150% - 200% of normal distance)

Okay, it\'s not hi-tech or radical, but it should work.

Actually, the usual problem is trying to view a graphic scaled
for 640x480 on a 14" monitor when using a 19" or 21" mnonitor
running 1600x1200. At the normal viewing distances for such monitors,
the text will be far too small.

The most obvious difference is that stat increases should be more of
a lifestyle change thing.

For ex, I could improve my strength by working out at the Gym but
I\'m not going keep that extra strength if I stop going.

Similarly with improving Soc by going to parties and spending money.

Actually, this might be a good idea for skills as well - skill 1
is kept forever but sill 5 needs a regular infusion of xp to avoid

From personal experience, maintaining peak skill levels requires
regular involvement with the skill but even completely lapsed
skills rarely drop below half peak ability.

Note that the difference in price is that config 7 (dispersed structure)
is 50,000Cr/dton compared to the cheapest partially streamlined hull
at 60,000Cr/dton.
Also config 7 cannot be armoured.

The point that I am trying to make is that if someone successfully
argues that all ship designs can operate in an atmosphere, I\'m going
to ask why I can\'t save some money by designing a ship that can\'t.

The rules state how much I save (10,000Cr/dton) and the additional
penalty (you\'d have so much surface area to armour that you effectively
can\'t, so no armour allowed.)

(I\'m ignoring asteroids because I think they should have a large minimum
 size to avoid structural integrity problems, still the High Guard rules
 do tend to work against 100dton rocks.)

An interesting question is between streamlined and partially streamlined
ships in CT. Clearly both can operate in an atmosphere (gas giant skimming).
The difference is ocean refuelling, so perhaps only the fully streamlined
designs can travel underwater? (Not a design feature that immediately comes
to mind when looking at the Imperial Star Destroyers from Star Wars. :-)

T4 gets all this stuff correct (of course):

Unstreamlined is unstreamlined so space only (or very low speeds) and bolt
on bits where ever you want.

Streamlined - the faster you go, the more you pay and you need hypersonic
capability for gas giants. With contra grav, a subsonic design can reach
space from Earth in half an hour.

Aerodynamic - streamlined with wings! You\'re back to bits bolted on to the
surface but these bits are specifically designed not to fall off in an
atmosphere.

Which seems to allow it for fuel tankage.

However, if you look at the rules for backups, they specifically state
that you cannot use (eg) a power plant-3 and a backup power plant-3 to
get a power plant-6 output.

If your 10kt ship was jump-6 then you could argue connecting one
to the 50kt frame an achieving jump-1 as backup, but giving the 50kt
frame J-3 and needing to bolt on 10kt ships with their own J-3 drives
for a combined J-3 ability seems totally out.

I\'m still not convinced of the design for other than some sort
of exploratory trade and for that it seems too big. Instead of
dragging your J-1 ships around for a week, why not let them head back
to their trade worlds whilst you jump the main ship off to another
trade hub?

On the other hand, if the riders were non jump, high G, then the
ship could arrive in system and send freighter to all the planets
at once.

I\'m still not convinced that carting the extra drives and hull through
jumpspace works - especially at destinations worth visiting with a 50kt
ship.

Your analogy is wrong. Gurps Vehicles _is_ the design system used to create all
items of equipment in GT. It is the equivalent of FF&S2 for T4. I recall you had
lots of options in FFS2 too.

GT is not exactly the same as CT (or T4, TNE, MT). Why do I need to say that?

Standard Traveller Setting?  Is that another phrase for CT? I am not proposing
changing the setting.  Are you trying to start a system war?

I am not making something that is markedly different. Just using the design
system to add chrome and "realism". I want my ships to make sense under the
system I am using. I hate inefficient design. Gearhead is as Gearhead does :-)

In fact I am not particularly concerned with making more powerful combat ships,
I don\'t do combat. I am much more interested in scouts and merchant vessels,
which would actually be less powerful.

You are going to hate GT Starships, which is about exactly this kind of thing.

The \'standard Traveller setting\' is the nuts and bolts behind the game.  
Starships can jump up to 6 parsecs a week normally, and *always* take a week 
to make the jump.  Certain technological developements depend on *other* 
technological developements, for instance, jump drive doesn\'t become feasible 
*until* both gravitics and fusion power is known enough to be workable.  
Communications proceeds at lightspeed *or* the speed of a ship that\'s 
actually *carrying* the message.  That kind of thing.

Depends on how badly they whack out the underlying assumptions of the Traveller
setting.  I\'m going to keep my eye out for it and make my decision then.

No the analogy is quite correct. VE2 is the design system for the _entirety_
of GURPS, as FFS2 is the design system for the entirety of T4. The difference
is that GT does not use the entirety of GURPS, only those portions that fit
the setting. You wouldn\'t use FTL radio, parachronic transporters, Cosmic
power plants, soulburner engines etc in Traveller, yet they appear in VE2. The
important difference between FFS and VE2 is that what appears in FFS is
part of the Traveller setting (or clearly labeled as "alternate" in FFS1),
whereas the same is not true of VE2.

> GT is not exactly the same as CT (or T4, TNE, MT). Why do I need to say that?

No its not _exactly_, but it tries to be as close as is possible. GT is still an
evolving system, there are still "bugs" in its conversion. The armour problem
is acknowledged to be one of these bugs and from what I understand, a
workaround is likely to appear in Starships or Imperial Navy.

In the case of GT yes it is. All the GT material has been written with the very
specific instruction from SJG to reproduce the look and feel of CT as closely
as possible. The problem with GT is it is quite possible to change the setting
without intenting to do so. All published GT warships have used expensive
metal armour, if ships using a significantly better form of armour start appearing,
the setting has been changed. Now an experimental design using better armour
might be possible (bleading edge tech) and would probably make a nice
adventure hook. However, such things should not be regarded as standard. If
they are, then for some unknown reason, all the major starfaring nations of the
Traveller setting are deliberately and knowingly building substandard warships.
That is a major change to the setting.

I briefly considered doing that too, but I just don\'t like re-directs.  I
think I\'ll hold out for my own domain one of these years.

Personally, I don\'t like them, but yes there are I think 5 or more books in
the series.  It\'s Weber\'s most popular character.

I haven\'t seen it in my FLGS.  Course, we\'re 250 miles due west of the 20th 
Century here at the best of times...  <grin>

But still, I don\'t like the idea of \'The Bad Dream\', either.  But it\'s been explained to me that this is an *alternate* TU, not the main line.

Personally, I *LIKE* the Rebellion era.  I just have trouble making sense of the MT rulesset sometimes when I don\'t have enough sleep under my eyes.  Guess that\'s why I play it with CT rules.  <shrug>

Actually, I kinda like \'em.  They\'re good clean fun space opera.

First book in the series is called \'On Basilisk Station\'.  Let me know when you read that one.

Dom:

Lots of others, and you kind of started in the middle.  If you liked
Enemies, I think the earlier ones will blow you away.

The first is _On Basilisk Station_, followed by  _The Honor of the Queen_,
_The Short, Victorious War_, _Field of Dishonor_, and _Flag in Exile_.   
_In Enemy Hands_ and _Echoes of Honor_ come after _Honor among Enemies_. 
There are also some collections with stories by other authors; the first
one, _More Than Honor_, is handy for the geography and technology lesson in
the back although I didn\'t care for the stories that much.  I haven\'t read
the other one (_The World of Honor_?).

I think the point being made is that Gurps Vehicles _isn\'t_ the design
system used to create all items of equipment in GT.

Instead a modified version is used that bans some tech, changes the
tech level of other things and creates some new tech.

Similarly, standard TNE did not use all the rules in FF&S
(eg FTL comms and warp drive).

FF&S2 had far fewer options. There were optional construction materials,
but nothing you would want to use for a starship hull.

Personally, I think a lot of this could have been solved by sticking
to Trav tech levels and not having this early tect/late tech issue.

Clearly, that wasn\'t an option open to the writers.

That must be another "Phil" - I hope!

From before my time on the list, I assume.

There certainly are. :) Try

The Short Victorious War

Honor Among Enemies
Echoes of Honor (Hardback only)
Worlds of Honor (Hardback only - a collection of short stories)

And in case you\'ve missed them, I\'d also recommend the Vorkosigan books
of Lois McMaster Bujold, but that\'s a whole other crate of

Then you *need* to track down as much of Norton\'s SF as you can. Her
"Forerunners" are a much better model than "Grandfather". And some of
the artifacts we run into are downright scary.

No more so than converting mass to energy "violates" conservation of mass.

Forward\'s but one of *many* people pushing that idea. 

> Hmm... I bet Ditzie could have some fun with _that_ one...

One of the early version of the concept had anti-missile laser
installations being used for launchers most of the time. 

A planet that used laser launchers not just for small cargo and
personnell pods would be a *nasty* surprise for anybody figuring on
conquering the "low tech" planet. 

Asuuming multiple launch sites, the ones for the "small" pods would
have *banks* of gigawatt lasers with ROFs in the range of 100+ pulses
per *second*. 

The major launch sites might go as high as a terawatt, again with
*dozens of high pulse rate lasers. 

Being within line of site of a major launch site would *not* be
healthy. And getting too close to a "minor" site wouldn\'t be real
healthy either. 

If they use laser asissted propulsion *between* planets, then it just
gets worse. 

Matter of fact, there are a *lot* of things that work well at one tech
level, but won\'t even get *built* if the next tech level seems to be
"in sight". But *if* they are built, folks that either don\'t remember
them, or who come from a culture that skipped that stage are in for
some *rude* shocks. :-)

I hope not.

I\'m sorry, John, but I have to agree with the original poster (apologies:
I\'ve lost track of who that was). GURPS Vehicles isn\'t so much a design
system, as a metasystem -- a toolkit for deciding what features you-the-GM
want to incorporate in your universe. My charter is to do some
pre-selection for you, consistent with the GURPS Traveller background as
published. If nothing applicable has been published for GT, I am supposed
to "be familiar ... with the original /Classic Traveller/ source material"
and look there for my parameters.

"Traduttore, traditore." (Italian: "The translator is a traitor.") I don\'t
expect I can please everyone.

I still intend to include some optional material, a la FF&S, so that people
coming to GT from TNE (say) don\'t have to go back to VE2 to figure out how
HEPlaR should work. There is also *absolutely nothing* to prevent you from
exploiting the full range of options available in VE2 (or any other GURPS
sourcebook) for your Traveller universe; I just can\'t publish that way.

Can I echo those like Dom and Juliean who\'ve given a thumbs up to this?

I would love to see \'plain\' info and/or First In.  Far Trader data would be
great too.

Having just got hold of a Palm IIIx myself and been really sold on it as a
\'life - changing\' (I know, sad, isn\'t it) tool, the only thing it needs to
round it off is Traveller development!  As the Library I work in has just
bought the O\'Reilly _Palm Programming: The Developer\'s Guide_ by Rhodes and
McKeehan (well alright - as Technology Librarian I ordered it) maybe I
should just go learn C and try it myself.

Perhaps there\'s enough of us for a TML: Palm sublist...

My *only* frustration with the Palm has been discovering that TML digests
get truncated around 1 in 4 times.  (There\'s an upper limit of 8000
characters on incoming email).

Not in FFS2.  There wasn\'t any optional (or alternate) technology in
the second version. There was in the first version, the one for use
with TNE, the one that I like the best. <g>

In FFS v1, the GM was responsible for choosing a technological
framework of which standard and alternate technologies could (and
couldn\'t be used)...exactly like the GURPS GM using VE2. VE2 is a
toolbox of possible technologies, all aren\'t available in *all*
campaigns.

FFS2 presented a subset of the technologies given in FFS1 limited to
those deemed suitable for a "standard Traveller" game. GT and its
supplements are supposed to be doing the same for VE2, but it\'s not a
finished product yet.  There are still burrs that need to be knocked
off the molds.

> > GT is not exactly the same as CT (or T4, TNE, MT). Why do I need to say that?

Because on the TML there are some people that consider (pick the
above) to be "the one true way" and all deviations there from to be
heresies. No, I\'m not joking.  

>From what was written in GT (and since) its goal is to be a close
emulation of the "feel" of CT. That\'s good enough for lots of us, but
not all, so expect sporadic, loud complaints whenever GT deviates from
strict CT/MT/TNE or T4...depending on who\'s canon gets spiked...to
make a play on words. <g>

Start?  The Canon Wars between the various factions *never* end in
here, they just die down when the participates get exhausted, only to
resume again a few weeks/months later. <g>  We won\'t admit it, but we
secretly like it that way...the constant fighting make us stronger
(hum, sounds like DBZ). <g>

Andrew is correct and armor appears to me to be a big sticking point,
or maybe better to say DR vs the effectiveness of weapons. 

Personally, I much prefer the TNE/T4 style of presenting armor, but I
like the GURPS scale for weapons. What I am doing is using TNE armor
scaled to produce GURPS scale DR and weapons that do GRUPS scaled
damage.  This avoids the thorny problems of VE2\'s armor. My ships have
Crystaliron and Superdense armor but the DR\'s (or AV\'s) are based on
TNE-AV*14 per cm and give values that work with GURPS weapon damage
levels.  Examples:

  20 cm of Hard Steel is DR 560 and is about 50/50 against a 5dx32
weapon
   2 cm Crystaliron is DR 224 and is about 50/50 against a 6dx10
weapon
  
 Min DR for a spacefaring ship is DR 140

As do all gearheads. <g>  

However, remember that the various versions of Traveller have a 20+
year history of beating the sharp edges off Traveller gearhead
designs, GT has less than 1 year. There is still a lot of bashing to
do on VE2 before it matches Traveller\'s traditional gear, and yes that
is the goal for a subset of VE2 (or VE2 inspired) design rules to
produce gear that matches Traveller gear and vehicles.

We\'ll see. <g> I\'m sure *some* people will hate Starships. Personally,
I\'m more afraid I\'ll be disappointed with what I can pull out of
Starships...however I am still hopeful.

This has been a hugely successful series for Baen Books.  Putting the first 
book on line (to get you hooked for the rest) is probably much cheaper than 
the 1.99 paperbacks there were selling to get you hooked.

FYI, "On Basilisk Station" is now only available in a hardcover 
edition.  This is a case where the hardcover edition was published after 
not just one softcover edition, but two!

There are two collections of shorts written in the Honor Harrington 
universe by other others.  One is a good read for mil-fic fans.  It has 
stories by David Drake and S.M. Stirling.

Don\'t tell me that, I don\'t have enough room for the books I\'ve got, I don\'t
need to start buying the Honor books in HB, though if ever a series deserved
to be purchased in HB, this is it.

As a result of this series I think I\'ve also read the rest of his Sci-Fi

One story deals with one of Honor\'s ancestors making "first contact"
with the treecats". That one is by Weber. Another deals with the
abortive attempt to overthrow Rob S. Pierre and the Committe for Public
Safety. Weber made it official, it *should* be read, as it helps
explain how a certain Admiral gets onto the committe. The final story
is set way off in the Terran federation (or whatever it is) and isn\'t
all that great. 

> I haven\'t read the other one (_The World of Honor_?).

"Worlds of Honor". This one has *two* stories about the history of
human/treecat relations. One by Weber, one by someone else. Both good.
And the other stories fit well into the history.

But they *do* distribute wind loads "evenly". And they have been moved
in moderate winds. Thus showing that a "slow" landing may be possible,
if tricky.

It\'s a very old Judges Guild product, and it\'s called "Doom of the Singing 
Star." Very large, a bit silly, and a little risky to be calling a canon 
source, IMO.

    And, yet, Marc Miller & Loren Wiseman did so.  So the fault lies with
them.  I.e. bitch to them about letting it be a canon source, not the list
or me.  As it is an authorized Traveller Product, then it is canon, if it is
not, then *weg*  only that which came from GDW is canon & T4 & GT are not
canon & not worthy of being discussed upon this list for long.  So you
cannot have it both ways, either it is canon & so it T4 & GT, or it is not &
nor is T4 & GT.

after searching up and down the Traveller web ring and still finding
nothing I sent out several querries with little response.
	I questioned Marc Miller to see if any names had ever been given
to the Verge sub-sectors and he did not know of any.

I submitted a compiled list to Marc and he has approved the sub-sector
names for the Verge sectors as:

This afternoon, I\'m heading out to GenCon UK (fortunately just a two hour

outfit and limp (& Droid Blaster) ready for action.

Provided everything goes well with Andy Lilly\'s imminent fatherhood, we\'ll
have two new books (the adventures previously mentioned), three
tournaments, a number of demos (Traveller in all different flavours and
Full Thrust, plus a 25mm mini\'s game), all the current BITS products, the
second hand material and the stand in the Trade Hall!

If you\'re around, come and see us!

As a result, I\'m unlikely to post anything more to the TML until Monday.

Well, the Honor H setting is traveller like in that ships are the
fastest means of communication. They are decidely *non*-Traveller in
that the ships can be attacked between stars. Also, the "shields"
provided by the impeller wedges makes things very different. As does
the *high* accelerations of ships and missiles.

BTW, I don\'t believe that fusion reactors will go "boom" the way Weber
has them doing.

Drat!  I wish you\'d told me that last week.  I\'ve just gone through the
hassle of getting one from the States as I couldn\'t locate one over here.
Drat, drat, drat.  (Can you send details off list in case I have to advise
friends who want one...?)

Still, you\'re absolutely right.  I can do something like 22wpm on graffitti
(took some practice) but would still much rather use the GoType! for any
serious text entry.

I\'m seriously thinking of doing all the data entry for the Traveller
periodical article bibliography on the machine.


BTW, TMLers might be pleased to know that the second edition of _The
Traveller Bibliography_ is now in some danger of actually seeing print.
Whether Andy Lilly will get it out for GenCon is a good question (unlikely
I believe with all his other demands), but hopefully very soon either way.
It covers everything CT, MT, TNE, MMT & GT right up to Alien Races 2.
Around half of the previous entries have been revised in one way or another
so this edition will be even better!  (Also, the 7 errors of the first
edition have been corrected and I trust not too many more added.)

Personally I don\'t care much for rules, but I like background material.

I very occasionally design HG2 ships, but spend a lot more time on world
design and stuff like that.  In the Real World(tm), I\'m more interested in
history than guns, ships or planes, so I guess I\'m consistent.

Most of the old Traveller players I knew were just the standard
role-playing crew - lots of students and people with \'white-collar\' and
professional jobs.  Most of them don\'t seem to play anything much these
days, or else they\'ve moved on to more general wargaming, rather than
RPGing.

Yeah, I like this aspect.  It\'s almost a scientific approach.  It\'s not
quite, of course, since we\'re dealing with something which is imaginary to
begin with.  It tends to appeal to my philosophical leanings, for what
that\'s worth.

Well, the Hero System (Champions, Justice Inc, Fantasy Hero, Space Hero,
etc) is a generic system that was around before GURPS.  It hasn\'t been
developed as much, but you can do silly things with it if you want.  There
are other generic systems.

The GT material is very good source material, particularly for CT.  There
is stuff I don\'t like, but I\'m highly skilled at ignoring things like that.
 I\'m having a lot of fun with \'aging\' old characters, turning them from the
\'bright young things\' they were into the old fogeys saying "I remember,
back in \'05, or was it \'06, ....."

Someone in an earlier digest mentioned that they thought that the GT
setting lacked conflict.  I don\'t really agree with that.  There\'s no full
scale war, but there\'s lots of nasty little things happening with the
Aslan, Sword Worlds, and Vargr that could very well end up bleeding the
Imperium white.  I suspect it will be a dangerous enough setting to
convince a lot of free traders to head to Deneb, where it\'s safe.  That\'s
NPC traders, of course....

The official Traveller universe(s) is actually a little conservative in
some ways, BTW.  It has to be, to a large extent.  First, it is bound, to
some extent, by the cliches of space opera - there\'s an empire, and nobles,
and megacorporations, and so on, so it\'s oligarchic, and has some
(superficial) similarities to 18th, 19th and early 20th century societies. 


It also has to be easily understood by people living in the societies that
exist now, particularly in the developed world, and so can\'t go too far off
into speculation about what future societies might look like, and how their
economies will function.  So it tends to make the assumption that the
societies of the far future are essentially just like those that exist
today, or that existed in the past, which is obviously untrue.

Of course individual referees are free to explore beyond those assumptions,
but I\'ve personally found it quite difficult, at least once it comes to
designing scenarios.  If you look at the \'Culture\' books of Iain M Banks,
you might notice that he sets his stories where the Culture ends and other
societies begin, with the conflicts driving the plots.  That can be pretty
hard to work with, and in any case there are other kinds of plot possible
in Traveller.  As a result I\'ve tended to abandon the various non-OTUs I\'ve
worked on, and fallen back on what\'s already there.

A bit of a ramble, but at least it\'s mostly about Traveller....

I wasn\'t referring to that mechanism, I was referring to something
like:

	you can either use those 3xp to improve Vacc Suit from 2 to 3,
	or you can use them to stop Pilot 6 becomming Pilot 5.
	With a limit that no skill ever falls below half its peak value.

One question:

How can we find out the progress of bidding on various items?

I tried a few times to download these archives but no dice.  I\'m on a Cable
modem and I keep getting no more than a 300-400 pytes per second rate.  What
the heck are you using for a server, a Vic-20 and a 300 baud modem?  :)

If you are on ICQ, I think it would be MUCH faster if you sent me the files
direct.

Thanks!

Another DBZ fan?  I\'ve gotten hooked on the series watching
it with my daughter on the Cartoon Network.  That and "Reboot"...
(She\'s also a Sailor Moon addict, but there\'s only so much of
that ditzy blonde I can stomach.  However, got to admit S.M is
a refreshing change from all those angst-ridden Marvel comics I 
used to read years ago...).

BTW, one can get pointers from both Reboot and DBZ on how to
design memorable NPC villains.  Who can forget that cocky
little sociopath Vegeta, or chaotic Hexadecimal, or the ruthless,
scheming Megabyte?

It\'s a freebie webserver, dood.  I have *zero* control over the speeds it 
puts out.  Sorry, it\'s the *best* I can do at this time.

I had the files put up on the server so that I don\'t spend *all* my time in ICQ or IRC passing these puppies around.

DBZ?

It sounds to me as if the TML was invented by the Shadows,
which must mean their is a Vorlon planet killer on the way.

That which does not destroy us makes us stronger.

Well, the Honor H setting is traveller like in that ships are the
fastest means of communication. They are decidely *non*-Traveller in
that the ships can be attacked between stars. Also, the "shields"
provided by the impeller wedges makes things very different. As does
the *high* accelerations of ships and missiles.

BTW, I don\'t believe that fusion reactors will go "boom" the way Weber
has them doing.

Possibly, but what would happen to the ship if its fusion reactor lost its
containment field suddenly while still fusing?

But they *do* distribute wind loads "evenly". And they have been moved
in moderate winds. Thus showing that a "slow" landing may be possible,
if tricky.

Not a peep for months now. I truly don\'t know what\'s going on; he\'s
always been helpful and speedy to ship items I\'ve bought in the past.

Although I don\'t know him personally, I\'ve been willing to cut him
some slack because he\'s taking university classes but I admit I\'m
deeply disappointed in the lack of product or at least monthly updates
from him. $100.00 isn\'t pocket change to me nor is it, I suspect, for
most of the TMLers who have paid him.

Interesting idea, but my goal with the experience system was to mirror
character generation.  It\'s nice, in Traveller, to know the character\'s whole
life by knowing where he\'s been (especially in advanced, year by year,
character gen) and where he\'s going (actual role playing).

Since there is not a way to loose skill in character gen, I don\'t see
complicating the system and bugging the players about their skill levels going
down.

Besides, at 34+, they\'ve got to roll on their stats every 4 years or loose a
point for age.

I recall from a previous discussion:

Perhaps Weber\'s idea of a hyper-advanced fusion reactor is a fusion
explosion - like one would get from an exploding fusion bomb - kept
under extreme pressure by the gravitics technology available in Weber\'s
Harrington universe. 

I have no idea if the above makes sense from a physics point of view.
It may depend on how much power it takes for gravitics to operate,
compared to what you can tap from the explosion.

I can\'t argue with any of that.

I certainly wouldn\'t feel up to introducing such a scheme to the group
that I game with.

Are they showing Third Season Reboot, from Canada?  It\'s excellent. Really
deep stories and character development.

Unfortunately, the English translation of Sailor Moon is abysmal.  I speak
Japanese, rather badly I must admit... but enough so that having watched
the originals, the American version is enough to make me cry.  It really
was an excellent show (although the monster of the week bits got silly at
times... the manga is FANTASTIC).  But it\'s more fantasy than SF, fair
warning.  There is a fairly decent manga translation from Mixx
Publications if you can stomach the fact that they use hiphop slang all
thru it.  I think this is sad, because the story is classic and shouldn\'t
be dated.  The ditzy blonde is ditzy cause she\'s only 14 and has just been
informed that she has to fight demons...  She gets better in the later
seasons, but you\'ll never see them in the US because Uranus and Neptune
are openly lesbian.

It depends somewhat on the design philosophy behind the vehicle (for TL 9 vs
TL 11, I have no idea offhand).  No WWII tank has a noticeable chance of
killing an Abrams (or any modern MBT) from the front.  Any of them can kill an
abrams from the side or rear.

never posted updates...  which is why I made a web site... and then

The \'latest\' update is at the web site -
www.primenet.com/~timmon/supplements.html

Which has NOT had anything new added to it in a little over a month because
there was nothing new to add until a few days ago which is when I sent all
manuscripts off to a friend to proof \'em for me - I\'ve stared at \'em so
long I\'m sure I\'ve missed many typos, so hopefully he will catch most of
\'em before I start the final printing in slightly over a week. 

Come hell or high water they are shipping this month. The quality may
suffer, but just as you folks are understandably weary (sick?) of waiting
on \'em, I am weary (sick!) of working on \'em. Again, I apologize for delay
upon delay folks. This has been a learning experience, and in a way I am
thankful that neither Andrew or Bill have any further manuscripts laying
around, because I know I certainly will never get involved in such a
project ever again.

And for the few folks who have written asking for refunds - no can do. The
money is already spent - either on paying Marc and Andrew or on material.
You\'ll get your copies and what you do with \'em is up to you. Before I get
flamed off-line again from persons who will remain nameless renewed with
threats of lawsuits to shut down \'Cargonaut Press\' and take all its assets
(this seems to happen every time someone asks the status of the books on
the TML), let me just state that there is no \'Cargonaut Press\' - I\'m just a
TML-old one working out of his home-office...and the landlady would likely
take exception to your taking the room its located in (but your welcome to
go for the 486 computer as you\'d likely be doing me a favor). 

Seriously though - I have been on the TML since its inception. I\'ve sold
hundreds of dollars of used Traveller items to folks on the TML over the
years and have never ripped anyone off, and I am not about to start now.
Contrary to the repeated emails I\'ve received, the manuscripts do exist -
Bryan Borich has copies of all of \'em except SCAM and can attest to their
existence. The books ship this month - period. They won\'t be up to BITS
quality (although I\'ve tried), but they will be considerably better than
the initial LOM release of a year ago.

To hopefully make up for the delay (in a very minor way), Andrew and I have
came up with a manila-envelope that contains several props that tie-in to
the supplements and I think most folks will enjoy them. It\'s not much to
compensate for the repeated delays, but it\'s something, and hopefully will
have made the wait a little more bearable once you do have the package in
your hands.

Cordially,
Paul Sanders

Jump drive components:

  FWIW, we know that under CT (HG2, naturally) the formula for a Jump
drive installation is: % = Jn+1. We also know that the capacitor
establishment is (HG2, p. 42) 0.5%MJn, or % = Jn/2.

  We can assume that the basic 1% (above) is the fixed hull components
("hull grid" for MT revisionists, something else*, internal, for CT); a
note needs to be made that we have to assume that all of these systems
cost around the same per unit volume (otherwise MCr/Dt/drive would vary
as do M-drives per p. 23).

  * I assume lanthanum coils per CT text and charts.

  We could assume that much of the remaining undiscovered 0.5% per Jn is 
pumps for the L-Hyd, which after all must be shovelled somewhere during
a relatively inflexible timeframe. Luckily, this too costs ~MCr 4.0/Dt :>

  As the capacitor banks hit Cr 800/kg even if only 5m^3 of each Dt is
counted (at 1kg/liter), and unfinished zuchai crystals run Cr 1000/kg, 
then we could avoid the entire morass of the uber-capacitors by assuming 
that the integral jump drive capacitors are actually fairly low energy
density, but that some other characteristic (see SOM?; DGP wrote prose
hand-waving so much better than they did rules) is what matters. Heck,
at least that would explain why they don\'t get smaller with TL increases.

  We still have to ignore what the 500 MW/turns per 100 Dt(Jn) are in aid
of, but we can\'t really solve it. Maybe you need to warm up the L-Hyd as 
it is dumped into Jumpspace? :>

  The problem with bolting a 5 or 10 KT J-6 drive module (e.g. S:9\'s Jump
Ship) onto a large cargo module is that allowing such automatically violates
the ship construction rules for lower J# ships, i.e., a J-1 10 KT ship has
200 D-t of J-drive at MCr 800, while a 2500 Dt J4 drive module permanently
mated to a 7500 Dt payload section (net total 10 KT displacement) could claim
to be a J-1 performance combination but requiring only 125 D-t of J-drive at
a cost of MCr 500. If allowed, such a technique would shortly be standard.

I\'m not gay but I am sure getting tired of the xenophobic attitude in the
U.S. to things that aren\'t supported by the \'main\' portion of the
population.  Are they afraid that seeing two CARTOON girls together will
make everyone in the U.S. gay?  Oh come on now..

Short answer: the armor values and penetration values (or equivalent in
your combat system of choice) are intended to account for this.  Depending
on the system, it is generally not impossible for a TL9 weapon to penetrate
TL11 armor, only very difficult.

Now for the long answer;

There are several questions here.  One is what is the situation in reality
vs. Traveller (the presumed context).  On the one hand, reality is the
resource we all turn to whne attempting to answer the question of
capability in the game\'s context.  On the other hand, reality does not
always match with the game\'s premises.

Your own question provides an example:  A TL9 MBT gun will be a discarding
sabot propelled chemically (perhaps Electrotherochemically) of about 120mm
diameter with a finned dart travelling Very Fast to use Kinetic Energy to
penetrate a target armor.  The TL11 armored vehicle wil probably have some
form of active defense system that is designed to break the penetrator
longitudinally to prevent it\'s greatest strength from coming to bear; the
focus of a heavy projectile travelling at speed on a small cross sectional
area.

In the Traveller context, however, a TL9 planet which can reasonably be
expected to encounter ground forces of TL11 will find a way to manufacture
a weapon at TL9 which is capable of, under the right circumstances,
defeating the TL11 armor (that they know of) under the right circumstances
(from ambush, with numerical superiority, etc.)

The problem of the AFV vs. AFV-defeating gun will continue to be relevant
beyond a simple TL comparison.  The training and specific equipment must be
taken into consideration.  If the U.S. Armored Cavalry units in Desert
Storm were the ones equipped with T-72s and the Iraqis had M1A1 and -A2
Abrams I think the outcome may have been similar (not the casualty ratios,
mind you, just the final result).  Training is one of the major keys to
success ina  military conflict - especially knowing your equipment\'s (and
you enemy\'s) strengths and weaknesses.

Incidentially, the Jagdpanzer ("Hunting Tiger") VI with its 12.8 cm main
gun could, in tests, penetrate 148mm of 30 degree sloped hard steel at 2000
meters according to one source.  Definitely enough to penetrate the average
Bradley CFV, but the Abrams?  I did not quickly find armor comparisons
among different AFVs on the Web, maybe someone else can say.  It would make
a good comparison of production vehicles from TL5(?) and TL8 (M1A1 = 1980).

Did someone read Tom Townsend\'s _Panzer Spirit_?

It opens when a US Army tank commander on maneuver in Germany 
finds a Jagdpanther, left over from WW2, lying abandoned and overgrown.
He approaches it on foot, and its cannon goes off - wrecking his
M60 and killing his crew. Some old booby-trap?

A brother of mine in the US Army heard the first bit and said, "NO WAY
a Jagdpanther\'s cannon could do that!!" I grinned at him and agreed.

He read the book after I did and loved it. A good modern monster story
with some fantasy elements.

this project to fruition, and am very happy to hear that the
supplements will be on their way this month.  I know that it hasn\'t

relatively good spirits throughout the ordeal, to judge by your post.
I hope that once this is done, you\'ll be able to return your focus to
school and work, and relax a bit.  I\'m sure this had been a burden
and inconvenience in your life, much more so that you originally
thought it would be, and imagine that you\'ll be very glad when it\'s
over.  Thanks for giving us the update.

Getting actual armor thickness figures for modern vehicles is challenging.  Figures I\'ve heard for frontal armor on an M1 are in the range of 550mm hard steel equivalent (though this is after accounting for slope).

There\'s a number of ways of accomplishing that effect, and some debate over what the best way of doing LASH operations (which is what this is, and is discussed in GT:FT).  That sounds like a fairly small ship, which probably isn\'t the best way to implement LASH operations.

Wasn\'t that the one with the experimental Jagdpanzer made with mithril,
that went on a one-AFV rampage after its Nazi-implanted spirit "woke
up"?  Amusing read, especially out in the field.  (How\'d you like to

Possibly not, but it\'s probably more gameable than a 20,000-ton ship with
20+ 800-ton lighters.  I\'m working on a fast (J-4+) freighter design that
has provision for an internal cargo pod in the 30-50 ton range (convertible
from express cargo ship to VIP transport with a module swap) and drop
tanks.*  In lieu of drop tanks, it can also carry oversized cargo pods for
low-Jump freight hauling.  

(This is not an invitation to restart the drop tank debate I\'m ruling that
drop tanks get dropped in Jump space, so you need a little extra fuel to
carry them partway through jump before you drop them.  Dropping tanks isn\'t
a trivial affair because it involves overstressing the drive, but when
speed really matters, this ship can do J-5 ... once.)

I pulled these stats from GDW\'s Desert Shield Fact Book. The armor

is in mm of hard steel at an effective range of 1000 to 2000 meters.

Maybe it\'s just a personal experience thing.  Every time I\'ve been in a
gaming stores or at a cons and started talking with people about effective
uses of Black Globe sheilds as campaign threads and ended up hearing tales
of strange bars in distant lands where they were stationed, or the
disposition of Napolionic rations.  I don\'t have an explanation.
I do also know that my players (or former players I should say) were some of
the most character-oriented people I\'ve ever gamed with (they\'re all
LARPers, what can you expect?).  A game session would be half an hour of
getting somewhere, and hour of plot, and four hours of interparty relations
along with (in character, mind you, which left it really odd) ethical
discourse about the moral, social and metaphysical implactions of their past
or intended actions.  They would still get giddy thinking about how many
rounds could be fired out of a gauss pistol.  Somebody played an explosives
expert just so he could get to use the one gaming rule that had a square
root in it.  At the same time these folks spent more time considering
philosophy than they ever did in real life, they also loved to run around
and blow stuff up.  And no, this was not how they normally gamed.  There\'s
something there, I just can\'t put my finger on it.

Brother, we speak the same language.  But I will argue that this is the
gearhead approach.  Other people see the tables and think, "how ever am I
supposed to run this?", I see it as a whole chunk of stuff I don\'t have to
deal with, if I don\'t want to \'cause I can always just toss some dice.  Or
that I know that the people up top have done their research and aren\'t just
making arbitrary, game-balance decsions, ergo we are duty-bound to wrestle
the details.

I said that I would make some outlandish generlizations.  And what with the
buy out of Hero by R Tas, and then the part-timing of R. Tas, we can\'t
expect much new.  (won\'t touch Amazing Engine with a ten foot pole) The
thing is, that campaign I mentioned was closer to serious than not.  GURPS
is a haven for the people with expansive ideas, real wild ideas, and that is
not terrilbly congruious with stogy Traveller folk who can talk about an
OTU, which, as you said, is the best of all.  So perhaps I\'m argueing that
you\'ll never manage to coerce the GURPS rulebooks into the nuts and bolts
kind of thing that we all know and love.  But you could do something vastly
different, and I don\'t mean alowing FTL coms just because they\'re in a book,
or spening hours considering the socio-political effects of the new material
rules, but learning a new style of playing a very old game.
But then, I suppose, we wouldn\'t have anything to argue over.

Hey Cher will be making a special guest appearance in the musical flash back
episode as Duilnor\'s mother Delilah.

I\'m seeing lots of sparkles, lights and sequins.  Probably four or five
costume changes and at least three major set changes.

Well, it\'s JG, and I thought JG was still canon... even if it was often

Gee, sounds like my old AD&D group, and they never were LARPers. I still
remember the player of the Dwarven Mage yelling (in Character) at the brash
fighter, saying "If you cut off the prisoners hands, I\'ll conjure up every
elemental in range to smash your little armored head in!", in the middle of
the supermarket parking lot. Conversation at Denny\'s always turned a head.

This probably happens a lot, given the longevity of ships, the distances
involved, and the volatility of highly developed capitalist culture. 
Higher tech level mech/elec/etc. shops should be able to figure out how
to fix or to work around a lower tech component.

According to the old TNS column in JTAS, the TNS is a service provided by
the TAS.

I\'m not aware of any dates if they\'re not in Milieu 0.

If the TAS was around in the early days of the Imperium, I guess we could
say the TNS was around then too, although that doesn\'t necessarily follow.

IIRC

TAS was formed in about Y400 - I\'m sure it is not available in the M0 period.

OTH

Marc\'s T4.1 draft gives TAS membership as a possible benefit (and does not
mention other organisations). I think that T4.1 is set around Y200.

Because Baen has not added one yet.
That is their decision, don\'t blame me.

This chapter has only been up for 2-3 days
AFAIK.  Baen\'s website is not updated as
often as we might like.  I am just glad to

really suck?  I got one of the videos, and decided to wait for
the rest to come out on Cartoon Network, as I was so offended by
the changes I refuse to pay for anymore videos.

I am willing to make a "refund" for someone who got in on the full meal
deal.  If you are no longer interested in waiting for your order, let me
know and we\'ll make arrangements to swap my name for yours on the waiting
list.  I\'ll reimburse full price ($100) for one set.  Let me know ;-)

According to one source I remember reading (can\'t recall where, possibly 
one of the GT books, or maybe M0) TNS originally started out as a forum for 
members of TAS to write about their experiences while traveling errr... 
Travelling.  Since the Travellers were often the first to get back with the 
news (and often made the news to begin with), the service became popular 
with non-TAS readers.  Eventually it evolved into a dedicated news service, 
although it still occasionally takes amateur articles from TAS members.

Alright, no talk of our sexuality on this Traveller list. You know it\'s one
of the seven deadly Traveller sins (among near-c rocks, piracy, jump
physics, etc.).

Although I think I\'m going to open every letter I write from now on with
"I\'m not gay but ..." (Sorry Jory, I\'m not picking on you, it just struck
me as a funny thing to write ;-)).

ObTrav: Uhm. What if I write "Traveller" again? Will that work?

Well, you could make some comment on the overall view of accepted 
practices in the Imperium. Say, what would the overall view of 
interspecies relationships? A guy and his Vargr ... well, we won\'t 
use what I suspect might be the approriate noun. <g> And if there 
are these relationships, does it make a better target for the 
objecting and thus same sex relations become more acceptable?

If this is truely on the don\'t discuss list, please ignore.

From the depths of my memory I seem to recall that the TAS started in 
either -38 or 38.  But it was within Cleon\'s lifetime, or 
thereabouts, so it was possible as a fringe benefit upon retirement, 
etc.  I think I got that tidbit from the Milieu 0 rulebook in T4.  
Can someone who has it handy check it out for us?

Thanks,
Jason

I found this:

Milieu 0, page 39, The Traveller\'s Aid Society (TAS).

<snip>
A few words from Ve Nu Lant, TAS Chief Executive Officer, 145-0008
"In those early years of expansion, many people just packed a bag and
headed off into space, hitching rides on scouts, traders and even warships.
 It didn\'t take long for an informal self-help network on the \'net to start
up, passing Traveller\'s tips, places to go, places to avoid, what to eat,
and what not to.  So one summer, I collected the stories coming back, and
put together the first Crowded Space guides.  They were instant hits, but
many people needed more practical help.  So with a few friends, I set up
the Travellers\' Aid Society.  We started off with \'net lectures, devised a
simple color code for planet safety, and in Year -16, we opened up our
first planetary office.  It was a great hit, helping people to get
oriented, providing a meeting place and information exchange, and even a
few beds for the night.  The rest, as they say, is history."
</snip>



I think this pretty much answers my question.  Thanks for the responses!

What \'hoping\'??? My character is on the front page of all the newspapers

They also lost no time in making your account non-existent. I got
several bounces, one the day after a message *from* you.

And then comes the fun of digging around in the local junkyard
equivalent hoping to find a usable component, or an assembly that can
be substituted for the one containing the bad component.

I can think of three basic types of "junkyard". All contain ships or
portions of ships that were considered not worth fixing, or that people
couldn\'t afford to fix, and weren\'t considered worth buying as "fixer
uppers by "optimists" wanting to get into business as traders.

1. On a planet with an atmosphere, near the downport. These ships will
   suffer from damage from weathering. And depending on how well
   maintained the junkyard is, there may be danger of ships or portions
   thereof collapsing or falling over.

2. On an airless planet, near the downport. These won\'t be weathered,
   though vaccuum damage (especially vacuum welding) is likely. In any
   case crawling around in airless hulks that have been partially
   stripped by folks in a hurry isn\'t exactly safe.

3. At a highport or in an asteroid belt. The ships will be parked in an
   orbital slot some distance from the station. They\'ll be in condition
   similar to the yard on an airless planet. Less danger of things
   falling on you, but zero-g has its own hazards.

Besides the scenario where the players are trying to repair their ship,
you can also have players without a ship trying to find one. Maybe
they\'ve lost their ship. Maybe this is a new campaign and a devious GM
has "graciously" allowed them to try to cobble something together. Of
course maintenance costs will be higher for a patch work of stuff
that\'s several TLs old. 

On the bright side, most pirates aren\'t going to *want* a ship like that.

*Don\'t* trust Weber on ship masses!

I once sat down with the figures for one of the larger ships, where
he\'d given the length, mass, and beam. Assuming an average density near
that of water, the ship came out to be only 5 meters thick. 

Weber has a the same problem that the producer (JMS) of Babylon 5 had.
A simple calculation shows that the *air* in Babylon 5 weighs more than
the mass given for the station. 

In both cases, "million" should be *billion*. 

If trying to estimate masses based on a smaller object, remember that
mass goes up as the *cube* of the linear dimensions. So an object 10
times bigger weighs 1000 times as much.

IIRC one of the early systems for vehicle combat (presented in White
Dwarf many moons ago) gave a DM based on the TL difference of the two
vehicles.

Indeed, late TL9 active defence systems (Russian Kontact-5 ERA, for

Let\'s see that Hunting Tiger shoot a moving target while moving itself -
something that a modern MBT can do without excess bother.

Well, let\'s take the 88mm as the standard At gun for 1945. This weapon
won\'t even scare a modern MBT - even at fairly close range. However,
it\'ll go clean through the armour of lesser modern fighting vehicles
(like a Bradley or Warrior). but 1945-1999 is more than one TL jump -
IIRC it\'s TL5 guns versus TL8 vehicles.

Looking at a 1970s tank (TL7) versus a 1990s tank (TL8) - well, you can
kill the more modern tank with the older one - but something special
would need to be happening before you got the chance. It\'s the
difference between an M60 and M1A1 tank, for example.

Dates may be wrong, as this is done from memory.

The Travellers Aid Society was formed around 800. Before that , there was
the Octigon Society , which collapsed due to financial mismanagement.Millue
0 actually had TAS as an concern, which broke previous cannon.

(I Think this is in the library data from MT, or from PBH but cant be
sure).

One of the things I like about Far Trader is a good explanantion of the
TAS, sort of NRMA (australian auto club) in space, where insurance pays the
bills and allows for service like free roadcare, accomidation data and
discouts for members. It also (IMHO) explains the Free TAS memberships
(advertising...Today TAS awards membership to that great hero BLAH)

I think the worst Denny\'s situation was when Rich Starnes was declaiming
to me (this was Arduin, where paladins could be any alignment so long as
they matched their god and did everything to serve their god) as to
exactly how good a paladin of Lucifer he was going to be and all the
wonderful things he was going to do for his master.

The little old ladies a table or two away did NOT understand that this was
a game.  (It was my campaign, where the Luciferian Gnostics were a potent
political force to be reckoned with...)

OT: can "weather contol" actually be a possibility?  Or. perhaps more
accurately, is "weather control" more of a long term "terra-forming" type
thing?  In other words, more like "increase rain and reduce drought" rather
than "make day 245 clear and sunny with a temperature in the mid 70\'s in a
particular city"?

Oh, definitely.... There were several "Phils" at the time, even. But the
others made certain to include last names (Like Phil McGreggor of Space
Opera and Starplay). No, Mr, K., you are NOTHIN\' like the phil of whom I
typed.

        Well, if what was "required" was The Cosmic Reset Switch,  its
either going to have to be a genocide war, a biological virus/microbe or,
well, Virus.

        Back when TNE first came out, someone posted a really interesting
alternate time-line piece that involved two stars in the capital sector
going collapsar at the same time...  which in turn deformed Jumpspace
enought that planets no longer "were" where people thought they were for
jump calculations... so, everything jumping anywhere instantly wound up
splattered over the sector at the time it happened, and then everything else
that tried to jump afterwards was pretty much automatically misjumping as
everyone re-learned everything they knew about Jumpspace theory....
        End of Navy.
        End of Trade.
        End of Imperium.

        It was a really nice narrative...  I can\'t remember the author, but
I am sure it must be in the archives.

No GT tech modification rules from GT107 apply:

TL\'s early. Contragravity appears four TL\'s early-- thus TL12 CG units are
available at TL8, while TL13 CG units are available at TL9...Artificial

Methinks Legate has confused "Authorized for use with" and "Canon"...

GDW would answer questions about DGP MT materials... but seldom would about
any of the other "Authorized materials"... all the authorized meant was
that GDW had given permission to them to use the Traveller Trademark, and
might have been getting their cut.

OTOH, I *Love* the 4 sector block JG did (Ley, Maranatha Alkahest,
Glimmerdrift Reaches, and Cruicis Margin)... they were more informative
than the GDW CT sector books (Rolomani RIm and Spinward Marches)...

OTGH,  GDW "Decanonized" them (specifically the JG sectors) in _Atlas of the Imperium_
At least the SM and SR sectors have had a lot of follow on developments...

I could be wrong (I still don\'t have my books back), but wasn\'t the
Traveller\'s Aid Society based on the defunked, Octagon Society?  Anyone with
Twilight\'s Peak care to look that up?  It\'s the only place I could think of
it being written, and if my memory *was* correct about that, then it may
mention some dates?

I doubt that most people would feel that such content is appropriate for
children, who seem to be the primary audience that TV executives aim
animation at.  Such material is fully appropriate for adult audiences.
Hopefully Scifi channel will agree with ME and air the later SM seasons at
an appropriate time for the adult audience.

You don\'t want to see this translated into English by DiC... trust me.

Anyhow... the later seasons of SM were considered appropriate for children
in Japan.  There\'s no sex nor even really any kissing, except for a few
chaste-ish kisses between Sailor Moon and Tux.  It\'s just very clear that
these two women are always together, and one of them always dressed very
mannishly (how she must hate the Sailor outfit) and sometimes pretending to
be a boy-- the other very feminine, and they live in a house together.  We
do in one episode see that Sailor Uranus\'s previous girlfriend was kind of a
lech (she hits on the girls) and see how Uranus and Neptune meet, but even
that episode is very, very tame.

I also don\'t know if this is truly a "non-discussion" topic either, but...
In the past, we have the ubiquitous AD&D game where --all the ones I\'ve
played in-- have your usual human races (caucasion, Negro, Asian, etc.) that
the PC\'s are free to mingle and "relate" to.  I\'ve had white character\'s
marry in such AD&D games, Asian and Negro human NPC\'s amongst other
caucasion races.

Now it\'s also acceptable to "relate" to elves (a *NON-human* race -- alien?)
and it was also acceptable to "relate" to halflings, dwarves, and gnomes
(although, in most such games, it is not possible to cross fertilise with
the non-elves, or even non-orcs!!), non-human, but these normally
vanilla-straight folk I know would not think twice about roleplaying a
romance with such races.

Then they watch shows such as StarTrek and see those buxom Klingon sisters
and say things like, "I wouldn\'t mind getting off with either (or both) of
those!" and we all have a laugh.  But in serious conversation, they will say
they weren\'t joking.

Yet, if they talk of Traveller, the thought would never occur to them to
have a romance with a Vargr (or a droyne, Aslan, or centaur for that
matter).  Where should such lines be drawn?  Should such a choice be based
upon sophontolgy prerequisites?  Simple looks/image?  I think I\'ve seen the
odd image of cat-like creatures with human shapes that look quite "sexy" in
their own right (witnessed by Japanese cartoons and Sorayama\'s "Hyper
Illustrations") that could inspire the "I wouldn\'t mind getting off with
those Klingons..." type of reactions.

I would assume that some cultures would take a dim view of, say an Aslan in
an Aslan culture, marrying a human.  But are the majority of worlds/cultures
across the Traveller galaxy close minded to such "mixed" marriages?  They
have had a long time to adapt although, even now, I understand there are
still those in Australia and the US (and other places) that frown on a
"white/black" or "white/yellow" marriage as "un-godly" and/or "wrong."  Mind
you, our culture is a lot younger than the Imperium and it\'s surrounds.  I
wonder?

that someone (at least recently) was myself.  I agree you can make/find
conflict anywhere... Except Paradise. (Paradise for me includes the lack of
conflict).

HOWEVER, I also like having the big overall conflicts to explore the
morality plays of "Us vs Them" mixed with the shades of gray morality, and
for me, the stories that work the best use the features of an overriding
conflict in the backdrop vs local conflicts in a morality play
methodology...  The 5FW sets a "Good vs Evil" paradigm sector (or domain)
wide that is a wonderful tool. The rebelion creates lots of "Us vs Them"

But the intro say "2 million tons of steel", and doesn\'t explicitly state
anything about the 20 billion tons of plastic, 10 billion tons of air, 5
billion tons of water... Perhaps it is a displacement rating (say, of
Liquid Hydrogen)???

I seem to recal a proposal somewhere to use mastery of chaos math and
robotic butterflys.  Otherwise, all I understand (from dating a geologist
and sci fi fan for several years) tends towards the former, but with a
little more accuracy and flexibility, IOW setting up tendancies towards some
desired weather for limited periods of time.  It also depends on what you
are trying to acheve; seeding clouds is one thing, but keeping them away.
There are two major problems, though, you\'re dealing with gelogical
processes (okay, metorologic, but cut from the same cloth) over geologic
time.  You can affect one on a limited basis, but that limited basis is
still running on a geologic time frame, and might take a bit longer or last
a bit longer than you would like.  It\'s also damnably hard to alter a part
of such a massive system without causing alterations in the rest of that
system, which can be overcome by doing something else, which cause more
problems, ad infinitum.  But if you a) don\'t care about the rest of the
world or b) have advanced nano-tech up the wazoo, sure, why not?
ObTrav(TNE): Some planet with good tech that went bonkers on this stuff (not
nano, but otherwise) which is now in the hands of the big V.  Gives a new
meaning to eco-terrorisim.

The folk I normally chat with, it\'s a "Wicked Evil Grin," or at least "Wide

Weather Control is not something that Traveller actually deals with. IMTU I would treat Weather control as water allocations done in the Murry-Darling Basic (badly run, full of allocation wars, and the possbaility of ecological damage). 

Weather would be a political bomb, as different sectors want different conditions (cotton farmers want rain, grrain growers want rain, the polititions want a hot day so they can leave their galoshes at home)

It can be done, quite easily in a Tech 14-15, and with a lot of efort in TL10-12. 

BTW this is my new adhoc email , because the domain is cool :-). mailto dadams@parracity.nsw.gov.au will still get digests though.

Ah, I\'m just giving you guys a chance to "customize" the ship. Let\'s see...the mainframe is slagged, the jump drive has a hole blown through it, the maneuver drive has chunks blown away, the life support system is dead, there are holes in fuel tanks, hull and hatches...oh, and somebody cracked the ship\'s safe and made off with a bit of your ready cash. Nothing that a little spit and baling wire won\'t fix. <eg>

Oh, and has anyone mentioned to you yet that the jump drive is an import from the Xtce system and there aren\'t any compatable parts for a half dozen parsecs? Muhahahaha!

Once in Nebraska, I and a partner of mine were sitting holding hands and
speaking in Japanese while I had a manga book lying on the table in a cafe.

As I said above, I can pass for white very well.  My partner was not
actually Japanese, but he looked close enough.

Shortly after we entered the place three burly men came up to us and an
older man who accompanied them informed us in a deadly tone of voice that he
was a WWII veteran.

We left in a big hurry.

In the parking lot, my partner said to me "For fifty cents I would have told
him that I\'m actually Chinese and we were on their side, but no one offered
me fifty cents."

I thought to myself:  "And if I had a black globe I\'d have said \'My name is
Miss Harbor, just call me Pearl.\'"

Plus (or, for the scut-work, mostly), of course, those fortunate
non-rates who have the joy of _reporting_ to the Boatswain\'s Mate....

Poor bastards....  ;-)

Makes me glad I joined the Army.  Of course, since I ended up
volunteering to fling my precious, one-to-a-customer body out of
reasonably-serviceable aircraft on a regular basis, my point of view may
be suspect.  *shrug*

Hmm.  I\'ll have to ask my Annapolis-grad cousin about the prevalence of
RPGs on his ship (I DMed AD&D for him many years ago...).

Don\'t ignore the value of seeding clouds.

I recall a TV interview a couple of years ago the the man resposible
for stopping (or at least minimising) the rain during Mayday parades
in Moscow.

Imagine, if you will, a train. In one corner of a carriage sits an innocent 
bystander. His journey will be several hours but he has a good book to read
and a table to put his lunch on.

Elsewhere in the carriage, three friends recognise each other and decide to
join up - choosing the table of our innocent bystander.

One of them suggests a game to while away the journey. The unfortunate in
the corner tries desperately to read his book whilst the three friends play 
through a game of "Nuclear War". (All expansions and a full population deck.)

Well, you could make some comment on the overall view of accepted
practices in the Imperium. Say, what would the overall view of
interspecies relationships? A guy and his Vargr ... well, we won\'t
use what I suspect might be the approriate noun. <g> And if there
are these relationships, does it make a better target for the
objecting and thus same sex relations become more acceptable?

If this is truely on the don\'t discuss list, please ignore.

Thing is, the Rebellion was already a genocidal war.  Virus really wasn\'t 
needed, except to slamdunk *all* the Major Races in one swell foop.

I can remember being very erudite and considered in my
original review of the competing designs. Unfortunately,
I can\'t remember what I wrote.

Oh bother! You didn\'t add a late entry to the original list.

I love the seeing THUDDD revived. Just one minor point.
Since GURPS is now a valid design system, might it not
be an idea to give the TLs on the website in both Traveller
and GURPS terms?

highly essential part, say, the size of a baseball, on an small, airless,
low-g planetoid. After picking around for a few hours, one player spots the
part. It\'s sitting on top of a big pile of other stuff near the edge of the
whole sprawling junk pile. He rushes over, picks it up...

and the whole damn pile comes up along with it, as every single piece of metal
on the whole damn crater is vacc welded together. The average 1-g resident may
not even initally notice that he\'s lifted half the damn junkyard.

Heh. It\'s just kind if an amusing image.

From the sources I have to hand (CT:Book 2 and T4), it says that the risk
of dying when travelling low passage is 4- or 11+ (assuming the presence of
a Medic-2 and a healthy passenger). That\'s either 1 in 6 (16.7%, Russian
Roulette anyone?) or 1 in 12 (8.3%), depending upon which source you are
using. I think this is an unreasonably high level of risk for something
that appears to be an "everyday" technology (i.e. used on many passenger
ships and used by the military for backup crews).

I suspect the public perception of risks is something like the following:

Chance of death  perception
1 in        12   Suicidal/almost certain death
1 in       100   Very dangerous (?getting struck by lightning?)
1 in     1,000   dangerous (?Chernobyl residents?)
1 in    10,000   Risky
1 in   100,000   Acceptable (level of risk for private air
travel/automobile travel)
1 in 1,000,000   Safe (levels risk of current commercial air travel)

The level of risk that I\'ve given for the final two levels is based on
sitting through a number of presentations on risk perception, and are
probably in the right ballpark.

From this, 1 in 12 would be a reasonable level of risk for someone who, at
today\'s level of technology, gets "cryogenically suspended" with the hope
of later curing their (currently incurable and life-threatening) ailments.
It wouldn\'t be a reasonable level of risk for any form of transport.

Now, I\'m no military historian, but I suspect a military force which took
losses at 17% or 8% would be considered to have taken "heavy damage". If
that\'s the case, it\'s hard to imagine how a naval commander could make the
case for a frozen watch. It\'s also hard imagine anyone choosing to travel
low passage, except _possibly_ refugees, for whom the alternative is
certain death. I don\'t believe that there are enough refugees to make a
reasonable economic argument for putting low berths on most passenger ships.

So, my questions to the list are:
1) Is the risk of travelling low passage too high?
2) If so, what is a more acceptable risk?
3) If not, how do you justify the high levels of loss in the frozen watch
(how do you recruit for the frozen watch), and how many passengers are
likely to take the risks of low passage travel (and why)?

	Bear in mind that fantasy settings do not necessarily 
	recognize the "species" concept, and that elves, dwarves,
	etc. are really humans with certain physical and 
	psychological traits exagerated.

	It takes more than bumps on the head or funny ears to
	hide the "humanness" of these "aliens."

	Vargr are more alien than Klingons, but even they are pretty
	human.  Still, I expect that only a minority of humans would
	be interested in sex with Vargr.

	humans.

	Given the Imperiums penchant for manipulating public opinion
	(c.f. attitudes towards psionics), it would not surprise me
	if Vargr were generally looked down on, and mixed marriages
	regarded with distaste.  In any event, I would expect that

Actually, I thought "Sailor Moon" was written for adults?  Kiri, am I right?
So with that premise, I can agree about the later time slot.  But if we\'re
getting into what is inappropriate for younger audiences, "Sailor Moon" is
tame in comparison to many such things out there today.

Ever seen those commecials that use sex as a persuasive tool?  Kids are
growing up programmed by Television these days.  All those stupid adds that
suggest things like "if you chew gum you\'ll get a hot, sexy babe"...etc...

as well.

The launcher\'s GT stats:

1 Space, 15.41 tons, MCr.02. Note that this launcher does not have
anti-blast ammo bin (for the 42 missiles carried) becuase the

	1) Yes, given the way they are presented as being used.

	2) IMTU, I use the same roll for survival (5+ on 2D), and
	the same bonus/penalty for End, but I allow adding the full
	Medical skill level of the attending medic to the roll.
	Independant merchant captains can rarely afford to hire a 
	doctor, but typically Medic 4 is available at a class A 
	starport, Medic 3 at class B, Medic 2 is the usual for 
	good freetraders and class C starports, and Medic 1 may be
	all that you\'ll get on some tramp ships and class D 
	starports.  Large Imperial Navy ships probably have Medic 3+,
	but reviving large numbers of personel quickly may mean
	pressing other medical personel into service with Medic 2-.
	Possibly anyone failing their survival roll with a Medic 2
	will get a second chance when the CMO is called in to assist.

	3) There is still a risk IMTU, but it is variable and may
	be underestimated by societies that have become so
	dependant and confident in technology.  Still, it is only a
	small number of people that risk it.

Good history of the varous JPL programs (Ranger, Voyager, etc.) and 
descriptions of the various moons of our solar system. These would make good 
models for worlds found in a Traveller campaign (for example, what would be 
the difficulties you\'d have to overcome to establish a colony on a world like 
Io that is constantly re-making itself?!?!)

The only downside is that the planetary mission details (missions to Mercury, 
Venus, Mars, plus details of the Jupiter/Saturn, etc. encounters...other than 
the moons of these planets...) is given short shrift. I\'d like to see a 
book--sometime after Cassini gets to Saturn--outlining the current knowledge

Rishathra was found on the Ringworld, which was populated by numerous
humanoid species that were closely related.  This allowed the process.  I

I like.  Especially the guy in his swim trunks considering a plunge...

(BTW: I did stats for at least two of the ship pics you sent me these many,

Here in San Francico, it\'s "if you don\'t like the weather, drive five

        Hi, Andy.
        1)  Stupidly too much so at TL 15.  At TL9, that\'s a different story.
        2)  See pontification below
        3)  You cannot.  At this loss rate, frozen watch is a death sentence.

        IMTU, here\'s what I do.  First issue is that my TNEC millieu is TL11
tech max, average being ~9.  IE:  Cold sleep is basically brand new tech.  I
believe that in High Guard it mentions that the tech was originally
developed as a method of transporting *herd animals* for colonies.  So, tell
me that loosing 8 - 20% of your investment is acceptable.
        I throw 4D.  DM\'s are (Vessel TL - 15), (Attending Medical skill /
2), -1 x (Number Months Ship Past Annual Maint).
        Death results on 4-.  2d injuries and "Cold Sleep Sickness" result
on a 5, and 1d injuries result on a 6.

        Bell curve for bottom bit of 4D looks like:
        Roll            %    
        4            .13        }
        5            .29        }          Total Injuries less than 1.3%,
total fatalaties less than 0.15%
        6            .79        }
        ----
        7            1.42
        8            2.96
        9            4.47

        So,  median roll is 14.  Given a medic 1, a properly maintained ship
and TNEC TL 9:
        14 + ( 9 - 15 = -6) + (1/2 = 0.5 round 1) - 0 = 9.

        So,  median roll is 14.  Given a medic 1, a properly maintained ship
and 3i TL 15:
         14 + ( 15 - 15 = 0) + (1/2 = 0.5 round 1) - 0 = 15.

        It works well and allows me to build Marine transports that don\'t
cost giga-creds in life support to move a platoon around.   It also means
that any smart Traveller asks to see the maintainence records for the ship
before closing the lid on the hibernaculum.  =)

Given that the designs are generally FF&S (or systems based on it) and that there are no conversion rules between GT and FF&S, I somewhat fail to see the point....

No.  The comic magazine "Nakayoshi" is aimed at girls age 10-14, late
elementary-junior high school age.  I started reading Sailor Moon as a
comic because it was at my reading level, but most of the stuff at my
reading level reeked, and Sailor Moon doesn\'t.

In the magazine, there were tons of ads for Barbie-type Sailor Moon
fashion dolls, digital diaries (I need to get new batteries for mine, I
used it for a long time), and other role-playing toys that generally
aren\'t marketed to adults, although I bought them.  (I also collect Barbie
and Jenny dolls-- Jenny is Japan\'s answer to Barbie, and much cuter
IMNSHO-- and that reminds me, I need to do a doll of my favorite TRAV
character, it\'s much more fun than painting minis was.)

The TV show had fight scenes in it that were designed to appeal to boys
and to kids even younger (they were really stupid, sometimes, and imnsho
detracted from the very elaborate and wonderful plot of the comic).  This
is one of the problems with Sailor Moon and why a lot of hard core anime
fans don\'t like the show.  The manga was perfect-- there was a lot of
stuff in the anime that Bandai insisted on that didn\'t fit, but if you
could ignore it, and I did, it was still a thrill to see this wonderful
story on screen.

> 
Absolutely.  And if you were to animate the MANGA, a later time slot would
also work... instead of the colorful, cute "theme demons" of the anime,
the MANGA had vaguely cthulhoid horrors show up when the badguys did their
summonings.

Don\'t go there.

The thing about the lesbianism in Sailor Moon is that it\'s done the
Japanese way.  There is nothing overt, but the implication is very strong.
You never see Haruka and Michiru kissing, though you do see Michiru
painting beautiful portraits of Haruka dancing in filmy draperies, Haruka
swearing to give her life for Michiru, etc.

In other words, if you are age 16+, it stares you in the face; if you are
age 10-, you will probably never notice.  And if you are age 11-15 and a
lesbian or bisexual girl, it might actually make you feel GOOD about
yourself-- the show could save lives.

You know those old 1930\'s cartoons that kids love and adults love more,
because of all the stuff you didn\'t "get" when you were 6 and the
slapstick was everything?

Sailor Moon is like that, which is why it\'s a good show even though it\'s
flawed.  There\'s something in it for everyone.  The manga didn\'t appeal to
the same wide audience.  The show has fights for the boys and the smaller
kids, cutesy stuff for the young girls, secret romances for the grownups,
all kinds of good stuff.

Why do you say that?  I only bring it up because I find it insulting and
annoying.  Our own picture of what is beauty in a physical form is
constantly bashed into our heads thru the media.  Take Baywatch for example.
I really hate that show.  And the women on it aren\'t beautiful to me, they
are pathetic 2-dimensional plaster-board people who I should probably pity.
Unfortunately, the masses (especially men) see that type of woman as the
"thing to strive for".  They can have\'em far as I am concerned.  And when
these "women" have bled their bank acounts dry, screwed all their friends
behind their back, and finally became old and ugly and bitter because of it,
they won\'t get an ounce of sympathy from me.

TLs taken from the examples in the MT rulebook. Early TL8 for today
seems to fit ok (Superconductors but not fusion power or anti-grav). I
admit that 1945 is borderline TL5/6. Call it 2 TLs, then.

Sounds reasonable.

They\'re not "lost", they\'ve simply moved ahead in the line from "on the

I think 8% to 20% loss rate for herd animals is acceptable, considering 
that the cost of the animals at the homeworld will be negligible compared
to the cost of the ship to move them and their value at the colony world.
The loss rate isn\'t as important as the number of live animals per dton
of colony ship you can deliver. Keeping the animals awake will remove
cold sleep losses, but now instead of moving one animal per dton
(a double size low berth?) it will now take you what, 2dtn to 8dtn (plus
the life support costs of 2-8 humans each)?

I say that because I mostly agree with you, and since there is little I
can do about it (I already refuse to watch those shows, but since I don\'t
I wouldn\'t have the first idea what products to boycott-- but my dollar
isn\'t worth much to advertisers anyway, given how little American products
I actually purchase...) I don\'t want to get into the head space that
thinking about it puts me into.

Jory, you and I had discussions about this in private mail... one of the
secrets to not getting into a serious depression, if your mind is wired
like that, is not to sit around bumming and thinking over and over again
about stuff that pisses you off that you can\'t change.

What I do, is to work against these ideas in my daily life when I find
them (such as telling my friend\'s 13 yo daughter exactly why she doesn\'t
need a diet and what it would REALLY do to her bod) and not support
products that are advertised this way.  And the rest of the time I try not
to get my blood pressure up over other people\'s insanity, because I want
to be the one who lives a long and happy life instead of joining them in
their early grave because of the stress I let them give me. =)

But if you can find a way to relate it to Traveller...

Hm, what are standards of beauty in the 3rd imperium?  I mean, our current
standard of beauty is nothing like what it was 400 years ago (when I\'d
have been considered one of the world\'s hottest babes, more\'s the pity..)

How are standards of beauty influenced by interplay between cultures?  I
mean, were we influenced by Vilani standards of beauty???  Which are???

What do Vargr think is beautiful?  (I had a great Vargr chara with
red-brown fur & black guard hairs, she was very vain about it...)

think about it...

Love, Kiri

	I see Vargr as being very smell-oriented.  As such, they still
	have a bias when it comes to looks, but certain smells are
	what make a potential mate really attractive.  I also have
	Vargr females only sexually receptive at certain times (they
	go into "heat").  Vargr males can easily smell this, and have
	no interest in sex with unreceptive females.  I figure that
	humans don\'t smell even remotely attractive to Vargr.  Sure,
	humans are sensitive to some smells, but we might as well be
	"blind" compared to Vargr.

I was not specificly thinking of only sexual relationships. I could 
envision say a like minded human and Vargr having a relationship 
like marriage even without any sex. People make alliances, even 
personal ones, for many more reasons than sex.

Actually, not to stray too far from topic, the reason is purely and
obviously economic. Bandai is a toy-making powehouse. The cartoons the
company pushes are advertisements for their toys, plain and simple. They
were hoping to steal some of the Barbie market with the same level of
success as Saiban\'s Power Rangers. Saiban created a whole new, and very
profitable market for Bandai with the many different Power Rangers shows.

However, Saiban did it right: they knew who they were pitching it to and
translated it to an American audience. Bandai, making the same mistakes
they\'ve made already (remember the Luv-Bots? Don\'t worry, no one else does
either) didn\'t translate it for an American audience.

The toys flopped in the U.S. The other merchandise flopped in the U.S. The
show was popular with only a few audiences: the largely male teen /
twenty-something anime fans and older teen goth-type girls.

The reason Bandai has little interest in continuing to export the show in
the U.S. is simple: they don\'t want to continue marketing their toys here.
It\'s a losing proposition for them. I pay careful attention to the toy and
cartoon biz, and have heard only the slightest rumors that the show was
dropped because of questionable subject matter. Unfortunately, the truth of
the matter is considerably more mundane.

Barbie rules the American girl toy market, and it\'s going to take a heck of
a lot more than a poorly animated and dubbed TV show "fad of the month" to
unseat her as queen.

ObTrav: There\'s so much difficulty in marketing products to different
cultures in late 20th century Terra. This ranges from the more or less
simple translations from U.S. and Canada to Britain, to the extremely
difficult, like India\'s movie industry.

It\'s easy to imagine that the situation in the Third Imperium would be far
worse. It can be far more insidious for traders. Imagine the following
situation, which closely parallels the Sailor Moon incident:

The players are traders. A new toy marketing strategy is started by a
corporation on World A. The players are hired to carry a cargo of toys to
world B. The early release hype on World B is immense, which makes the route
very profitable for the PC traders. Larger and larger shipments are sent.
Finally, when the PCs have sunk a massive amount of their profits into
transporting the toys, the market on Planet B falls out from under them.
They\'re stuck with a hold full of toys nobody wants and very little money.

Snicker, snicker. ;)

Somewhere I have seen an article about the Julian Protectorate. I
_believe_ that it is a HWIG document, but cannot vouch for it\'s
\'canonicity\'. In it the author described a relationship like that
between vargr and humans. I\'ll see if I can dig it up.

Actually, you\'ve got your facts wrong-- it wasn\'t Saban at all, it was
DiC.  Saban bid to do a live action version of the show.  It\'s truly
horrid-- I\'ve seen their demo.

No, Bandai\'s toys never were marketed here.  Irwin/Bandai America reworked
them all.  The US Sailor Moon dolls didn\'t sell because they were FUGGLY.
I\'ve seen them, and I own the Japanese dolls, which are beautiful and
well-made- but they also cost 3800 yen apiece, close to $35 ($40 at the
exchange rate at the time) and Americans won\'t pay for that level quality
in a non-collector doll.

US Barbie collectors became anime fans in droves after seeing these dolls.

I disagree.  If they had marketed the original toys and had any sort of
policy in doing so, the show would have ruled as it has in every other
country.  But Disney and Hanna-Barbera dominate the appropriate timeslots.
In 90% of the areas where it screened, Sailor Moon was running before
dawn, or when its primary audience was in school (2:00 pm or so-- it\'s not
a preschool audience show).

SM is hugely popular everywhere in Asia, Europe... the Italian dolls,
which I also own, were beautiful too.  Ours were noseless and had elephant
feet.

Kiri, a SM fan since 1994 when no one in the US had ever heard of it.

The Xtce system is out there...somewhere...you\'ll have to see if you

Update on the game...

In my AKUS MOBY game, the PC\'s have finally gotten the ship they
inherited. 
Unfortunately, they arrived at the asteroid where it was hidden just
as pirates/hijackers were attempting to fly it away. A brief firefight
ensued. The PC\'s in two ship\'s boats were decidedly outgunned and the
ship escaped after damaging both boats. While the hijacked ship tried
to reach a jump point, it ran into a squadron of Space Patrol boats.  

These Patrol boats appeared "out of nowhere." They had obviously been
lying cold near the jump point...it was almost as if they had been
lying in ambush.  The squadron attacked the fleeing ship, and nother,
very brief, battle followed. The /Mae Lee/ was stopped, but in the
process she was turned into something resembling swiss cheese.  

The Patrol towed the ship back to the mainworld "for an investigation"
and told the PC\'s to follow.  After briefly exploring the asteroid,
the PC\'s complied and returned to the mainworld. During their
debriefing at a top-secret military base the PC\'s learned that the
"pirates" had all committed suicide rather than surrender...yeah
right! 

The press picked up on *part* of the story and splashed headlines and
passport photos of our heroes all over the vids and newspapers. It was
all about the "Stalwart Patrol and the Brave /Mae Lee\'s/ crew battling
bloodthirsty Pirates!"  Right now, the "dashing and romantic" Captain
Ricardo O\'Brien is having an uncomfortable 15 minutes of fame.  

The Navy finally turned the ship over to our heroes at the world\'s
UpPort, and they flew their boat to the parking orbit where the Navy
had left the /Mae Lee/.  A brief external inspection turned up several
holes, and after looking around inside it became clear she\'d taken a
good deal of damage. 

Most of the PC\'s are currently aboard trying to "access the damage."
There has been much moaning and gnashing of teeth during the past
week. There will be more as the full extent of the damage becomes
clear. 

A few of the others are off on a sub-plot having lunch with Lady
Ryobi, court appointed administrator of Akus\' will, and meeting her
nephew JaCarter. JaCarter is a new PC who will be "accompanying the
others on their travels." His stated mission is to report back to his
Aunt on the PC\'s progress, but I can already see the seeds of distrust
sprouting. You see, the PC\'s have discovered that Aunt Mazie, the Lady
Ryobi, also happens to be a Director of a local intelligence agency.
She doesn\'t know that they know, and would skin her agent if she found
out about his loose tongue. The other PC\'s *don\'t* know if JaCarter is
a "comrade chekist", as Kuzov would say, but I think it\'s fair to say
they are suspicious. At this point, I can neither confirm or deny
anything at all...

The group is going to have to make extensive repairs to the /Mae Lee/
before she can be productively used...that\'s clear. They are also in
serious need of cash! Several ideas have been tossed around. 

There is a courier job on the table from Sir Milo Gunt, and they could
combine that with a trading run out to the Montrose Collective raising
a good bit of capital. The rest would stay on Mark and do as much of
the repair work on the ship as they can.  

Some of them have the idea that they can "sue the lawyers" for not
"protecting the /Mae Lee/" from the pirates. Anybody want to bet on
them getting anywhere with *that* idea? 

There is also a salvage claim on a ship\'s boat they found abandoned.
That should raise them some money, but I\'m afraid it won\'t be enough.

Other than raising money and repairing the ship, there is still the
unsolved murder of their grandfather Akus, possible involvement by
Zeristu spies, Space Guild thugs, and several intelligence agencies
for them to deal with. 

None of the PC\'s are currently certified to fly a Mark registered
ship. They are going to have to see about taking the tests and paying
the fees (?bribes?) soon.

There is a drought on Sequi that is seriously hurting Wolfgang\'s
family\'s farming and herding concerns. He doesn\'t know how bad yet,
but he soon will. There should be an opportunity to make some money
off of the Segui problems, but I suspect conflicts between unbridled
profit vs compassion and crew loyalty vs family loyalty are going to
appear soon.

Oh, and this doesn\'t include the discovery that bookworm Arvitis made
about a "lost Imperial Library." The other PC\'s don\'t know about that,
and if Arvitis doesn\'t tell them before he shuffles off the scene they
may *never* find out about...well at least it will be later rather
than sooner.

Yeah, it\'s a pain, isn\'t it? maybe we should both move to Tonga. :) Or
build our own time machine (although I think I\'d miss some of the the
advantages of the current TL - like Traveller :) ).

Anyway, back to Traveller. In a sufficiently high TL where you\'ve got
the medical capabilities to do routine body-sculpting then standards of
beauty, like fashions, can become extrememly variable.

I\'d imagine that at first contact with another humanoid race there would
be an immediate reaction by the rich and fashion-conscious of both races
to take onboard facets of the other culture. You could start getting
some really weird fashions and standards.

IMTU, Vargr are also quite scent oriented. Females have "seasons" that
relate to when they can become pregnant, but that is above and beyond
intimate relationships that continue throughout the year. Scent plays
an important part in these relationships too, but there are subtle
differences that distinguish a receptive female from a female in heat.

During heat, "the pink" is the colloquialism, Vargr females, their
mates and packs, have to be very careful because their pheronems are
quite overpowering to Vargr males. There can be dire consequences,
especially in closed quarters like a ship, from the effects of
uncontrolled pink.

All Vargr societies have developed some kind of scent control for pink
females. Strategies range from surgery, to isolation, to various
artificial scents to "hide the pink." Obviously, some methods are more
effective than others.

On the other hand, several artificial scents that produce a scent very
close to "the pink" have been developed. This is very dangerous in the
already volatile Vargr culture, and many Vargr societies have made
artificially creating the pink scent taboo. That doesn\'t mean such
methods can\'t be found.

And artificial scents *can* be applied to species other than Vargr,
like humans, with effects ranging from funny to disastrous.

Example from the AKUS MOBY game....

Jaren Kuzov visited a Vargr Fight Bar on Segui with a couple of young
Vargr newlyweds he had met on the shuttle flight. A waitvargr started
insulting Jaren and his friends with taunts about the "skin momkey"
and veiled hints that he was servicing the "pink" Vargr in the couple.
(That part went over Jaren\'s head. <g>) The expected (by everyone
except Kuzov) fight broke out.

During the fight, the Vargr females in the bar quite literally formed
a cluster around the young Vargr female isolating her from the males
and would have killed any Vargr male attempting to get to her. This
was even though her scent was *very* well hidden. The males, and
Kuzov, and a nice friendly knock-down fight swirllying around the
female cluster. When the males were pretty much exhausted, the females
joined in and "finished them off"...figuratively...much fun was had by
all.  No one was seriously hurt and things didn\'t get out of hand,
that\'s the Segui way.

I remember that too. The relationship had nothing to do with any mates
the vargr or human might have, it was separate.

So do you have Vargr scent tech?

I would imagine Vargr scent markers for some things, similar to carving your
name on a possession.  Or because there color vision is not as acute scent
coding of documents similar to color coding.

A scent based alarm could be interesting too.

I would imagine a Vargr that was forced to wear a vacsuit or filtermask
would feel allot more cut off from the world than a Human.

ObTrav: There\'s so much difficulty in marketing products to different

It\'s easy to imagine that the situation in the Third Imperium would be far
worse. It can be far more insidious for traders. Imagine the following
situation, which closely parallels the Sailor Moon incident:

The players are traders. A new toy marketing strategy is started by a
corporation on World A. The players are hired to carry a cargo of toys to
world B. The early release hype on World B is immense, which makes the route
very profitable for the PC traders. Larger and larger shipments are sent.
Finally, when the PCs have sunk a massive amount of their profits into
transporting the toys, the market on Planet B falls out from under them.
They\'re stuck with a hold full of toys nobody wants and very little money.

I wish Far Trader modeled this sort of thing better.  I wanted to include speculative trade goods whose value was temporary but I was hugely busting my page limit as it was.

The speculative trade goods in Far Trader are all assumed to be things of some steady objective value that could be sold profitably on another world but where no one has noticed the opportunity yet.  The gradual decline in value free traders get for the goods comes from competition from other traders and export-import companies.

What is needed is rules that cover things like temporary commodity price fluctuations, fads, and "one-offs" (clearance sales, etc.)

I\'ve been thinking that if SJGames lets me I\'d like to make my part of the Far Trader Designer\'s Notes article a kind of v1.1 of the Speculative Trade Rules (Ian Whitchurch has pointed out other things that could be improved) and "fad" goods are certainly something I\'d like to include.  I\'ll send a draft of those rules here for comments.

Only replying in kind. Such a statement, in and of itself, is utterly
obnoxious. Far be it from me to stand up for the beautiful people of the
world, but I\'ve met many people who are conventionally attractive and who
have none of the qualities you describe.

Nowhere did I say that was my philosophy. I\'ve had this argument one too
many times in my life. To put it simply, if you step away from your
statement and look at it for just a minute, you\'ll see where I\'m coming from
here. To attribute such nasty qualities to people based solely on their
looks is absurd.

Which is why you\'ve now made it to my killfile. Have a nice life.

Either you\'re misunderstanding me, or you\'re the one with the wrong facts.
Saban (no, I didn\'t spell it right initially) did the various Power Rangers
shows. I was stating that they did it right by marketing the product to an
American audience. Bandai, on the other hand, was pulling the strings on the
Sailor Moon television show, and they got it wrong for an American audience.

Disney and Hanna-Barbera dominating the after school timeslots? What decade
are you living in? Hanna-Barbera has cut back on its syndication after the
launch of their cable channel, The Cartoon Network, and the closest Disney
ever was to dominating the after school market was in the late 80s. Nowadays
you might see Duck Tales in syndication, and Hercules, and maybe one or two
other shows here and there, but Disney hasn\'t been too interested in daytime
syndicated TV for at least a decade.

It\'s a moot point anyway, because Hanna-Barbera\'s Cartoon Network got the
rights to air the show nationally in a reasonable timeslot after fans
campaigned. It tanked.

That may be so, in that case Bandai screwed up in more ways than one.

Ben Bova, the science fiction author/editor, wrote a novel on weather
control in the early seventies. In it a physicists/meteorologist uses his
theories of the behavior of fluid systems to change the weather. He has a
friend at an orbital anti-missile platform use a high powered laser in an
unauthorized experiment to steer a hurricane away from Florida (I think it
was), by creating a high pressure front. Unfortunately there\'s all kinds of
other unexpected side effects to the weather in other areas. I can\'t

like a good idea.  I can live without a few things.  :)

As far as the Traveller reference goes, who is to say what standard of
beauty may be used in the 3rd Imperium?  Or that it is even human?

I do see where you are coming from.  But I do think you are pushing this
WAAAY out of shape here and getting defensive as if I am attacking you
personally, which doesn\'t make ANY sense.

If I\'ve made your killfile so easy, then all I can say is "C\'est Le Vie".
If you are so easily put off then I doubt I\'ll be wounded if you don\'t read

Not to disagree, but--Sailor Moon plays in the very sought after late
afternoon time slot on the East Coast.  Among my 14 year old\'s friends, male
and female it is very popular. Most know the whole plotline (from having
visited the Sailor Moon sites on the web).

OTOH, when she was 16 my great-aunt was sent to Ravensbruk, where she
survived several _years_ as an experimental medical subject.  She didn\'t
end up embittered, and was well able to distinguish between the Nazis who
tortured her and ordinary Germans. My grandfather survived WWI, the
Troubles in Ireland, and the Blitz in WWII, losing friends and over 2/3 of
his family along the way, and yet if he hated anyone I never learned of it.

I used to think of them as exceptional people, but I keep encountering
folks like them. I also encounter bigots, but the \'good folks\' outnumber
them. The only problem is that the bigots are noisier (and more violent),
and thus tend to command greater notice.

I\'m sorry, but my experience with continuing conversations like these

Yes, but in all the other markets (I have a huge collection of Sailor Moon
toys, and I have seen nearly all of them) the same toys were marketed,
with different packaging.  America and Canada got redesigned toys. Who
knows why?

::shrug::  You\'ve obviously confused me with someone that actually cares
about the DiC dub.  I don\'t.  I wasn\'t part of the campaign. It tanked
because the translation was awful, and because the toys reeked, and
because it got lousy timeslots.  I don\'t really care...

But I do know it\'s still on in syndication.

That *may* be so?  Come to my house, I\'ll SHOW you the toys.  I have
shelves of SM dolls and toys from Japan, Italy, Hong Kong, and even a few
US toys, but mostly the US/Canada toys reeked.

The dolls sold in Hong Kong, Europe, and the rest of Asia differed from
the Japanese dolls only in facepaint (not quite as detailed) and body
(better, more articulated). The US dolls were noseless, with huge feet--
they were ugly, they had no clothing line, and they couldn\'t wear Barbie
and Ken clothes.

It is death to market an 11.5" doll for girls that cannot wear Barbie\'s
clothes, ESPECIALLY if she doesn\'t have her own clothing line.

I don\'t want to discuss this in private mail, because I haven\'t time, but
it is OT and I don\'t think more needs to be said.

You may do this by sending an email to

the majordomo and can contain whatever you want

From my records, there has been no traffic on the

G-d, this sounds fantastic.  Send me a copy, and let me know if
you find a contact point for the artist - it sounds ideal for
Freelance Traveller\'s Multimedia Gallery.

In fact, as a favor to me, please do the same for all of your
Travelleresque favorites in your collection.

And that goes for the rest of you on this list, too.

Phil still exists, and at the same email address - he\'s a regular

If you can use JimV\'s GALACTIC, check out Amdukan sector\'s notes,
specifically the section on the "Panet relationship" in the
Julian Protectorate.  Originally from a Challenge magazine, but I
don\'t recall the number (I believe it\'s properly credited in
GAL).

Canonical, and not HIWG (Challenge Magazine).  Summarized in GAL,
Amdukan Sector notes.  I believe it\'s properly referenced and
credited.

It almost reminds me of that old Cheech & Chong routine with the dogs.  "Just

Dude, you ROCK!  :)  (heheheh)

I\'ve been lurking on and off the list for years, but only had a vague idea
what your celebrated campaign was like.  Despite missing out on the \'story
so far\', however, I have to say: bravo!

The whole \'ship as an inheritance\' plot element strongly reminded me of (the
late, lamented) Brian Daley\'s Hobart Floyt & Alacrity Fitzhugh novels.
Hadn\'t thought of those books in quite a while..., lots of good material for
idea mining there.  Hmm...  :P

Anyway, thanks for posting the story update.  Although I usually find
gamer\'s enthusiastic tale-telling of their own games is often like showing
strangers your home movies, I have to admit I\'m impressed.  Quite the
ripping yarn, indeed!

I will mercilessly rip you off, of course.  ;)

        Please do, Bruce...  the Vargr are probably my favorite canon race.
It would be interesting to get some more information on them.

    The micronuke looks about right. Personally I prefer M.A. Lloyds
alternative
nuke rules (Check the GurpsNet Archives). 
    The 1 ton micronuke does 12d x 2,000 concussion. *But*, the armor
counts as the square of the DR, meaning the DR100 scout/merchant
effectively has DR10,000 against this toy. If this is is what you
intended, great, otherwise you may need to increase the yield, a lot. 
    Second, keep in mind the Imperium restricts the uses of nukes (even
micronukes), and any players who start using (or selling) this item will
find themselves in a great deal of trouble.

    I also like using full rechargeable E cells rather than building my 
own (randomly sized) power cells (20 pounds, 0.4cf each)

    Lastly, I would recommend trying to build this into the 6cf/300lbs 
for the standard missile launcher. Just my thoughts.

No.  Nuclear war is an amusing (if cheesy) little cardgame where you try to kill off the other players with a combination of propaganda (which steals people, but doesn\'t work during war), nuclear weapons (which kill people), and a wide variety of special event cards.  Due to the mechanics of fighting, it is possible for everyone to lose.

Bog.  Nuclear war doesn\'t have a map, and isn\'t tactical.  I know I saw that line about lighter fluid, but I think it was another game (ogre?  Dunno).

Yeah, but that\'s the point.  They wanted *everybody* brought down
several pegs.  If the Solomani had retained their power, for
example, they would have rolled over the former Imperial area.  If
the Solomani, Aslan, Vargr, etc had survived intact they would have
just split up the old Imperium territory.  To keep a level playing
field everybody had to be affected.  

The Zhodani didn\'t get the Virus, they got the Empress Wave.

IMTU, that would happen naturally.  Jump plots wander over time, so
once a few years passed without updates every route would have to be

Why, thank you!  I\'m glad you enjoyed it.  I know I certainly have.

Most of the fun has been created by the crew of excellent players in
the game. Mostly I\'ve just given them situations and let them lead
where we go.  

Of course, the McGuffin for the story so far has been "Get the Ship"
and their focus has been on getting to where the ship was supposed o
be and then finding it.  My part was providing a cast of NPC\'s and
situations to delay, distract and entertain them along the way. 

Now that they *have* the ship the McGuffin will have to change.  I\'m
not giving away any secrets when I say it is going to be "Keep the
Ship", and if Keven is right "find Xtce!"  <g>

No, I haven\'t read those books.  More material to find and read!  <g> 

I set the connection up as "heirs to a ship" because I wanted the
PC\'s to have a common connection and goal, but not know each other
when the game begins.  A big part of the game has been the
characters learning about each other while they travelled.  It\'s
been an interesting trip so far and it has hardly begun.

Thanks again.  I don\'t post game updates here often.  I know some
people don\'t like them too much so I try to keep my updates short
and very occasional.  Personally, I enjoy reading about other
people\'s games...on occasion and in small doses...so I try to do the
same.

As for my yarn, I kept it as neutral as I could.  I suspect the
story told from the viewpoints of Ricardo, Arvitis, Woof, Shawn,
Jaren, Cory, Kelly, Martan or Mira would all be different and
equally interesting.

>I will mercilessly rip you off, of course.  ;)

Please do!

No, it\'s Nuclear War, but I think it\'s a version that predates the "card game" incarnation of the game. IOW it might be a *different* Nuclear War game.

IIRC, it was NATO, a late \'70s wargame from SPI.  I\'m _pretty_ sure that
Greg Costikyan was involved in the game\'s design and/or development. 
(Readers of "Murphy\'s Rules" may recall Greg Costikyan\'s game "Nuclear
Winter.")

Hum, you might be right, I vaguely remember SPI\'s NATO game.  But I
really think there was a game called Nuclear War from the 70\'s that
had a "rule" that if the game reached a certain point you were
supposed to fricassee the map and all the cardboard pieces.  <g>
Maybe I\'m just remembering wrong...the ravages of time do that to
you, you know.

If the position were at all worthy of lengthy discussion, I\'d be the first
to do it. As it stands, I lump it with racism, sexism, or just about any
nastiness that\'s along those lines: judging people not by their actions, but
by what they look like.

I\'ll gladly judge people by their actions, like the comment that Mr. Earl

The card game Nuclear War has been around for at least twenty years, and
has never had a map.  It\'s always s been a strategic game.

The game with the amusing rules for Global Thermonuclear Armageddon was the
SPI mega game _Central Command_, which covered a theoretical WW3 in the
V/VIIth Corps areas.

Hello to all.  This is my first post for this group so I will keep it
brief.
Adventure 3 Twilight\'s Peak page 46, a little below the middle of the
page
mentions the following:

Octagon Society established in 342.
It was the first major distressed spacefarer assistance operation for
Spinward Marches.
Thrived in public contributions and some tax revenues for 150 years.
It collapsed in the late 400\'s over scandals re shelter quality and
disposition of funds.
Society disolved in 499 and assets sold at auction.

I hope that this helps.

Well, maybe it\'s my memory playing tricks on me, but what I\'m
thinking about is well over 20 years ago...1999-20 = 1979...yeah,
*well* over 20 years.  Somehow, I\'m connecting it with something
from Flying Buffalo, that I saw in the old Koby\'s Hobbies when it
was on South Palafox...that had to be early to mid seventies, but I
admit it might be a false memory.

Ah, well! My brain is probably just playing tricks on me.

Actually we are getting to the same point.  I am by no means dismissing the
power of seeing clouds.  I was trying to point out how there are simple
weather control procedures, and then ones not so simple: i.e. you can make
it rain, and you can make it rain somewhere else so that it doesn\'t rain
where you are, or earlier so it doesn\'t rain later or whatever, but just get
rid of the rain altogehter?  A little more insidious.

Okay, so I think that some of this has to do with the perspective I come
from, namely that I only *cowering in shame in a darkened corner* started
playing Traveller with TNE (and after GDW went belly up, to boot), so I
never saw it as the aforementioned "cosmic reset switch" that everybody in
their right mind did, but rather as one of the most creative and frigtening
enemies that has been brought forward in a long time.  Just an issue of POV,
I suppose.
And as an odd side note, after a hiatus in our session when I brought
forward the proposal of playing GT to my group the outcry was amazing.  They
thought that playing without an empire to rebulid, an implacable foe to
conquor, and the intense moral complexities of just what the RC was doing
would be (quote) "boring as hell."
Oh well, still trying to convince them otherwise.

Well, circa 1980 (I don\'t know the exact release date), there was a
board wargame from Yaquinto, called "Ultimatum", which was designed to
simulate nuclear saber-rattling.  Of course, wargamers being what we are
(yes, I am a card-carrying grognard), most games ended with nuclear
strikes being exchanged.  While Ultimatum didn\'t have the "lighter fluid
and match" rule, it usually ended up with a similar result.

BTW, if any TMLers have a spare copy of Ultimatum, I\'d happily part with
some of my accumulated currency to purchase it....

ObTrav:  While the 3I has pretty well prevented the use of Weapons of
Mass Destruction against civilian targets in interstellar conflicts (at
least within the 3I), what about WMD use between nation-states on
balkanized worlds?

I believe allied bombing raids over Germany during WWII had higher
acceptable losses (especially the US daylight missions)?  I\'m also lead to
understand that all of the beach landings undertook during WWII had
acceptable losses marked higher than 20%, and again, considering all the
pacific landings the US made, this is an horrendous figure.

Mind you, this is from memory and I may be off a "%" or three, but I\'m not
normally to far off.  Maybe someone on the list may have access to actual
figures?

I also heard that US forces in Vietnam had a high ratio of acceptable
losses?  Although this to me is just hearsay and not read personally by
myself.  But I believe that in peacetime, there isn\'t much call for
"acceptable losses?"

Well, IIRC it\'s generally accepted that a unit that takes over 33% 
losses is pretty much had it until the losses can be made good 
and the unit given some R&R, re-training, etc. Of course there are 
a number of famous exceptions to the rule.

        My biggest problem with TNE isn\'t Virus.  Its that I don\'t use the
3i, and therefore the whole product was Just Another Different Rules Set For
Traveller.  I\'m currently playing in a TNE-set PBEM (Hi, Derek!) and rather
enjoying it.  My only on-going concern is that I see no way to win...  Virus
is like Anthrax;  once an area is contaminated, there seems to be no way to
sterlize it...  even a hand-calculator could be the Agent of Doom if you
aren\'t careful while scavenging.  <shrug>  You can quarentine and take
precautions, but its there forever.

        Its funny, actually.  My players don\'t like gaming in the 3i for the
same reason.  It is so well developed and so well organized, there is
nowhere for them to make an impact...  Between the 3i Navy and the MiB
(grin) hanging over every world like a Sword of Damocles nothing is every
going to get big enough to be an epic. (For all you 3i junkies out there,
please don\'t bother writing me volumes as to why I am wrong.  Thanks.)
        That\'s the reason we\'ve never run a 3i-based game.  <shrug>  First
game was a one-sector empire wedged between three other 1 - 2 sector
empires;  very "Pirates of the Caribean" feel to it.  Current game is low
tech with less than a sector and the Galaxy wide open for the taking;
players are investing the money they\'ve made into an exploration ship to
head out into the unknown in search of some place they are already calling
"New Eden"...  
        Anyhoo, my point (and I do have one ;-) is that not everyone has a
problem with TNE because of Virus.  And someone else agrees with you that
the 3i is boring.  =)

Ah, thank-you.  My memory wasn\'t far wrong, however, that phrase "It was the
first major distressed spacefarer assistance operation for Spinward Marches"
does not preclude the TAS from starting somewhere else, well before the
Marches were colonised and/or annexed/etc.  But thank-you for that on my
behalf, it does still answer "a question" for me.

It depends on the nation.  The Soviet army had plans to keep units on the
line well past the 40% casualty level, whereas the US threshold was much
lower.  It also depends on the mission.  If you are storming a hostile,
fortified beach, you are going to have to accept that some units will be
wiped out to the last man; something you would accept on a movement to
contact situation.

The Soviets allowed for the occasional training death as part of the
mission.  When I was at Ft. Benning in 1985, we had a kid run in front of a
firing M-60.  That shut down or training for a week while everybody from
the Battalion commander to the Criminal Investigation Division investigated
what had happened. (He zigged when he should have zagged.)

It\'s a sad commentary that our leaders now have to plan on the public
relations aspect of any military campaign.  With everyone pussy-footing
around trying to avoid any casualties, since the Five-sided Funny Farm
knows that the grieving families will be on the six-o\'clock news, readiness
and skill have to suffer.

OTOH, it does mean that gross blunders such as Bradley\'s at Omaha
Beach are less likely.

ObTrav: Just how much did Norris have to worry about this during the
FFW? Just what was the effect on public opinion of the Battle of Terra
in the Solomani Rim War? Given that any assault on a defended high
population world is going to be a meat grinder like nothing else, just
how does the Imperium deal with the PR issues?

There was no connection between the two. There\'s an obscure, and propably
non-canonical article in an issue of _Different Worlds_ where the founding
date for the TAS is given, but it\'s a long time since I saw it and I can\'t
remember when it was. I do remember that it was some time after Year 0.
However, T4 mentions the TAS as existing in Milieu Zero (mostly because
it reprinted old CT texts verbatim). (I was not impressed with the editing
of T4. \'Exit Visa\', one of the sample adventures, was taken from a CT book
and was actually set on Alell, a planet that hadn\'t been settled yet...)

Considering the distances involved, most people won\'t even care that the
Rim war happened.  I sincerely doubt that more than one in ten could tell
you what Sector Earth is in.  It\'s just not relevant.

For example, my late father was from Stafford, in Devon.  I have no idea of
where that is in England.  None.  It was never important to me.  Change
that scale from one generation on one planet to hundreds of light-years
across millennia, and most people won\'t care.

Also, the Imperium controls the news feeds through the X-boat system.  They
can massage and spin the news to their liking, and give the "official
story" time to grow before independent witnesses make it home.  Another
example, we are 130 years "away" from the US Civil War.  The story we were
all feed as children was that it was about slavery.  The truth was far more
complex, but the "distance" and relevance to our daily lives made that
simple story acceptable.

Why should the Imperium report casualties?  Unless there\'s a specific
propaganda purpose (remember the Arizona!), tell the mob that the enemy is
being whipped.  Deaths are reported to the families, as single tragic
incidents.  You don\'t tell them that their son/daughter/spore was killed
along with 6000 of his buddies when a Solomani tac nuke went off over the

That was the line from the rules for the war game "Nato". It was based
around a conventional war in Europe during the 80\'s.  The one drawback to
the whole game was that the designers refused to believe that battlefield
nukes would do anything other than start a world wide exchange (probably
true) and it was frustrating to be the nato commander and get hammered by
the warsaw pact repeatedly.  If you went for your nukes, the game was pretty
much over.

        Anyhow, my point (and I do have one ;-) is that not everyone has a
problem with TNE because of Virus.  And someone else agrees with you that
the 3i is boring.  =)

        Have to put my voice in here. I loved the 3I for a long time, but my
players hated it. In fact it pretty much was the main factor in the demise
of CT in our gaming group hundreds of years ago.  I finally picked up TNE a
couple of months ago and strangely enough my group ( a lot older and with
much less hair) tends to like the background.
I am still not convinced that the Virus is the greatest thing, but I do
understand what it is supposed to do.

I still think that a campaign at the end of the long night would be  a good
one. It would provide an up and coming 3I and provide for plenty of
exploration, rediscovery of lost worlds etc and still be traveller.

Oh, and just to offend the "biology is not destiny" crowd, there are a few
beauty standards that are likely to remain constant among humans.  For
instance, across history and culture women have always preferred tall men
with high social status.  Likewise a waist-to-hip ratio of .7 in women has
been preferred by men across culture and time.  Some studies also suggest
that symmetry is an important and fairly universal factor in
attractiveness in humans.  These are of course generalizations across
large populations, and of course there are women who like short men and
men who like non-curvy women.

A) I would stick with nukes, other WMDs don\'t have the same resonance to
draw from.  Or rather, to use other WMDs takes a whole other set of
considerations.
1) Obivous plot thread - Players arrive at world to find it in the gripps of
a plagirized Cuban Missle Crisis.  Their objective on planet is put deeply
at risk, allong with the populations of whatever country.  Do they do
something about it?  If they don\'t it makes for a good envionmental piece,
as well as the whole "outrun the shockwave" stuff.
2) Plot thread w/screws - Players are hired to ship/smuggle something to
somewhere, and as they leave eveything goes boom.  Ooops, we just became war
crimials.
3) Bizzaro plot thread - What happens to a planet /after/ a massive nuclear
war, or one that has gone on for some time (I mean, other than it getting
Red Zoned).  The players have to interact with a cuture where tossing ICBMs
is par for the course.  Break out Genisis of the Daleks, 50s propoganda, and
good ol\' West End\'s Paranoia, and have at it.

but you have to love a game that they tried to ban in the UK as a "violent

Illuminati is the other...)

Also I vaguely remember that "lighter fluid" quote from one of the SPI Soviet 
invasion of Western Europe games printed in the 70\'s (Nato Division 
Commander, Mech War, Red Star/White Star?...). These games are just before my 
time (I started in 1981 with Ogre/GEV and of course Traveller...), but I 
vaguely remember one of those games using that quote to simulate the 
escalation of convention war into nuclear war....

I suspect, based on our own history, that the main factor in the society\'s
standard of beauty is going to be whatever phenotype is most expensive to
achieve.  The rich are *always* beautiful.  (Thus we have the current
reversal of the situation in the Middle Ages, where being round and pasty
meant you didn\'t have to work and could eat as much as you wanted, unlike
those grubby peasants with their muscles and tans from working in the
fields all day...)

The next biggest influence, in any society with media as prevalent as it is
today (or even in the last few centuries), will be what the Fashion
Industry(tm) declares, based on what appears to outsiders to be little more
than whim, what is Hot now.  This applies to looks as well as clothing and
accessories.

Beyond these blanket generalizations, my muse fails me.  Anyone else?

I have Ley and Glimmerdrift (or was it Crucis Margin?) and I 
have to agree with you--they wrote the sector books with an eye
toward making them interesting and useful for GMs and adventures.
The GDW sector books tended to be dry lists of stats.

OTOH, the Paranoia Press products (Beyond & Vanguard) tended to
pack a little too much "interesting" into one subsector...

IIRC, it was during the MT era that GDW specifically said that
the JG products were "not canon".  Why, I don\'t know. Most of them
were better and more imaginative than the corresponding DGP stuff from
the same area.

And did anyone ever figure out where the Dynchia went?  In the
MT-era write-up of Hinterworlds, they didn\'t leave a spot for their
"12-world" (or whatever it was) empire.

Alas, the *mass* of all the metal remains unchanged. So you\'ll casually
grab at the part, and get quite a jolt when it doesn\'t move. Jerk
harder and you may get a large chunk of vacuum welded parts coming at
you. 

The most common fatal mistake for folks on low g worlds is giving a
mighty *heave* to get a large, heavy object off the ground. This brings
it up to carrying height quickly. And then you get to watch as it keeps
on going up. The fatal part is if you are dumb enough to try to get
under it. 

At 1/6th g it takes the same amount of effort to get a 600lb pound
object moving upwards as it does to get a 100 lb object moving at 1g.
But the 600 lb object still has six times the *inertia*. Oops.

The "plug & socket" model seems sufficiently widespread in *very*
divergent species on Earth that I\'d expect it to be fairly common among
aliens as well. 

But that still leaves a *lot* of room for differences in size & shape. 

Is that a penis or an ovipositor? 

Are the various bodily secretions involved "compatible"? (Example: if
the natural lubrication of one species has a pH far enough from that of
another, I\'d expect chemical burns, not sexual pleasure!)

Well, either another game used that line, or some\'s actually played Fire 
Team.  And here I thought I was the only one...  Fire Team is a tactical 
squad-level game set in a late 80\'s war in Europe, sort of a late cold war 
ASL.  The use of tactical nukes was presented in the above manner.

It was Bradley\'s rejection of Hobart\'s specialised armour as "products of

Omaha.

Yes, but the bulk of the Imperial forces for any planetry assault is going
to be locally recruited provincial forces. And casualties on the scale of
likely in a planetry assault are going to be noticable on the local scale.

However, if your son/daughter/brother/sister/father/mother etc was killed
assaulting Stafford, Devon you might think differently. I imagine that
normally most US citizens would have no idea where the sleeply little
French village of Ste Marie-du-Mont is, but now it has taken on a special
relevance.

Because over a certain limit, it is impossible to hide them. If millions are
lost assaulting Terra, it will be impossible to hide even in the masses of the
Third Imperium.

Why is any assault on a defended high population world a meat grinder?

Any defended high population world just has weaknesses. If you were foolish
enough to throw your main battlefleet into the  teeth of fresh planetary
defenses, the assault would be a meat grinder.

The weakness of a high population is huge infrastructure needs. Food, water,
power, and sewage treatment make life possible on a high population world.
Destroy those items, and the population will eventually implode on itself. A
simple application of Manslow\'s hierarchy of needs.

A naval blockade coupled with targeted small unit commando assaults would
grind down the ability for the population to sustain itself. Ideal targets
are the highly distributed targets such as agriculture, power distribution,
hydro facilities, food storage, and sewage. Even a coordinated defense would
have problems getting enough firepower to defend a location before the
damage was done.

Planetary assault is relatively easy, once you study it\'s applications.

OTOH, it does mean that gross blunders such as Bradley\'s at Omaha
Beach are less likely.

ObTrav: Just how much did Norris have to worry about this during the
FFW? Just what was the effect on public opinion of the Battle of Terra
in the Solomani Rim War? Given that any assault on a defended high
population world is going to be a meat grinder like nothing else, just
how does the Imperium deal with the PR issues?

How many people from your home town died in WWII?  I don\'t know either.
The Imperial forces involved in the Invasion of Terra were drawn from the
entire Imperial force fighting the Solomani.  That\'s 3+ sectors of people.

Where?  Remember, this is America, where an informal poll taken of
teenagers found that many couldn\'t name the country we won our independence
from, or when that war happened.  I doubt that any ten people would
recognize the name "Bataan" or "Wake Island".  They might recognize Pearl
Harbor, but would be hard pressed to tell you what happened there.

How many troops drowned rehearsing the D-Day invasion?  How many Americans
died in El Salvador in the 1980s?

It\'s also a matter of spin control.  The division wasn\'t wiped out, it died
heroically defending the line.  With a little massage, a defeat can look
like victory, and vice versa.  For example, the Tet-68 offensive by the
Viet Cong/NVA was a total failure.  Not a single objective taken and the VC
losses were so high that they ceased being an effective part of the war.
Yet because Walter Cronkite reported that he thought we had done badly,
popular support for the war plummeted.

So the Imperium loses a million troops taking Terra.  That\'s the last
paragraph in the press release, after three and a half pages of flag-waving
jingoism, body counts, and pictures of the Imperial flag flying over New
York.  Remember, nobody cares how many Russian soldiers died taking Berlin,
they just remember that picture of the Hammer and Sickle being raised over
the Reichstag.  Same thing with Iwo Jima.  The horrendous casualties were
overshadowed by the picture of Old Glory being raised on Mt. Subiachi.

        I disagree with your analysis, given an envrionment of the 3i.
Perhaps in my TNEC millieu (TL 9 - 11), but not the 3i.
        Firstly, in pure TCS terms, a "hi-pop" world generates enough
defense budget each year to have the sort of defenses that will trash your
blockade if it gets close enough to the 100d limit to be effective.
SDB\'s, BattleSats, Asteroid Monitors, etc.
        Secondly, commando assaults suffer the same essential problem as
your blockade does...  3i technology allows you to detect and track a
*fighter* at 450,000km.  Deep meson sites and surface-based laser batteries
and missile silos with access to global defense networks are simply going to
have a shooting gallery as you try and sneak your commando team in.  When I
posted my "Andrew Young" design, I allowed for a *brigade* of Meteoric
Assault Troops to be deployed at once, noting that using TL15 capsules, 30%
losses in the air were *expected*.
        Blockades don\'t work in the 3i;  not against HiPop worlds.  In fact,
I would venture forward the suggestion that it is the *attacker* who is
going to be having logistics problems, not the defender.  One 20dkton TL15
SDB that gets in amongst your support ships or troop carriers is a wolf
amongst sheep.
        Thirdly, *if* you can get your commando team down you certainly
won\'t get them back out.  The same defense grid that somehow failed to
notice them coming down will be *searching* for them going back out.  And
they will die.  How many suicide missions can you send Special Forces teams
on before some or all of the rest of your teams mutiny?
        Fourthly, that HiPop world has the capacity to ignore your blockade,
should it somehow be sucessful, for months.  Perhaps years.  Eventually,
thier allies will notice your blockade and the next thing coming out of
jumpspace will be a Very Cranky relief fleet, not a merchant convoy.

        Which means that if you want to take a planet, you have to either
own every other refueling point within JP6, or you have to do it *FAST* when
you come out of jump.  Steam-roller the ships in your path, take your licks
and attrocious casualties getting into orbit, counter-battery the deep-meson
sites and surface batteries, drop your MAT wave and get the attack shuttles
with the G-Carriers and Trepidas out the doors as fast as you can.  If you
don\'t take 60% casualties before having a beach head, then I would consider
you a genius.
        Oh, and hope the sots who own the planet are above meson-gunning
your beach head regardless of what "friendly" casualties and destruction
that might cause.  If they aren\'t, you cannot win.

ISTR that the forecasts for D-Day were in the region of 20-25% casualties,
and that Omaha is only remembered for it\'s \'horrific\' cost as it was 2-3
times as costly as any of the other beaches.  But the losses were still
lower than the pre-invasion predictions.

This is in no way meant to detract from the terrible loss of life, or from
the courage of those that fought there (on both sides for that matter), but
only to point out that *all* the beaches were *expected* to be much worse
than Omaha *actually was*, yet it was still considered *acceptable* by the
high command. Or perhaps more accurately, unavoidable but necessary, rather
than acceptable.

I thought I remembered a reference to the casualty expectations in
Eisenhower\'s \'Crusade in Europe\', but on skimming though it just now I can\'t
find one... maybe I read it elsewhere.

I was watching a documentary on paratroopers, they were interviewing
a strapping young American Airborne trooper, I think of the famous
US 82nd Airborne.

The paratrooper was talking about a get-together where he met some
retired members of the unit. He proudly told some old-timers that he\'d
been in thirty airdrops. He asked a veteran how many airdrops he had
been in.

"Oh, only four. Salerno, Sicily, Normandy and Holland."

The young troopie was suitably awed.

ObTrav: We need some details like this from the 4th and 5th Frontier
Wars. Did jump troop veterans take part in the Relief of Jewell, or the
ill-fated Efatian Mountains drop? I think 5FW TAS reports are deliberately
sketchy, to allow players of GDW\'s Fifth Frontier War game to use
their game details easily in their own OTU campaigns - does anyone
have any "Famous Surface Battles of the Fifth Frontier War" (or Fourth
Frontier War) data available?

While I generally agree with your idea about storming a high-pop planet
in the face of horrendous casualties, there is one thing I\'m thinking of:

What if one or two of those assault lander shuttles aren\'t carrying any
troops, but are instead carrying capital-ship grade Meson screens?

I\'m not even sure this is possible, but I\'ve heard of city-sized screens
before (nuclear dampener only?) - if a portable Meson screen would 
allow a beachhead that could only be dislodged by direct armor/infantry
assault, things may get a little better for the attacker.

Of course, these custom shield-shuttles will be the first targets of any
counterattack.

        Hi, Walt....

        I tried it...  the "shuttle" winds up HUGE because of power
consumption.  Further, throw enough USP 9 laser cannon at it, and then you
have to start piling on ARMOR, and then they use the USP 9 nuclear missle
sites on you, and you have to start packing N-Damps on the shuttle, cranking
up its size again...
        Shortly, its just easier to land a star-ship proper and be done with
it.  And that is a Mighty Tempting Target.  =)

Thanks for the table.  I haven\'t seen that breakdown before (and further
reinforces Rainman\'s craziness:  while he wouldn\'t ride any airline
except Qantas, which has never had a fatal accident, he happily got into
a car made by a company that has surely experienced many fatal
accidents).

I\'ve always thought the risk of death in low berth was way too high, and
usually rolled 1% on percentile dice -- which is actually still a very
risky proposition.  Maybe people in the Imperium are more fatalistic
about death, and just accept high risks -- but nothing else in canon of
which I\'m aware supports that idea.

We sometimes discuss clothing fashion in the Imperium on the list, and
this is a related topic.  I think that there will be different, and
sometimes competing, standards of beauty in the Imperium.  Some
standards will be derived from local cultures and some from holovid
programming.

Local cultural standards will vary widely, just as they do on our one
planet today.   Different species have sufficiently different issues
about this subject that it may not make sense to talk about, e.g., what
beauty means to a Newt or a Virushi or Jgd-il-Jagd (spelling?).  These
standards will be spread around individual worlds by telecommunications
and other media, according to technological level.  Interstellar regions
will be influenced by media disseminated from influential worlds.

Entertainment, advertising, and propaganda holovids (what\'s the
difference?) will be made in various centers in the Imperium for wide
distribution, and they will have some effect on local standards. 
Because of the nature of interstellar communications, fashion and
standards of physical beauty will be different in different parts of the
Imperium at the same time, as the waves of holovids fan out from
whereever they are produced.

I think Mickey Spillane, an American author of hard-boiled detective
novels, said it best:  "Beauty is only skin deep, but ugliness goes
right to the bone."  (I can\'t remember the title of the novel with that
quotation; I think it\'s the one with Dogeron Kelly.)

What difference does it make if Imperial member states are nation-states
on a balkanized world or if they are world governments of different
planets?  The Imperial Rules of War prohibit all Imperial member states
from using weapons of mass destruction against each other.

The news generally takes a lot longer to get from the front to the
public in the Far Future (tm).  The Imperium also censors war news very
carefully.

I would expect this to be much less of a problem.  The family of Support
Troops from another sector would not hear casualty reports until weeks or
months after the fact. Capital won\'t get the news for 2 years. The citizens
who matter, the Imperial Nobles and Megacorp executives won\'t get the word
on casualties until the battle\'s over.  If the commander looses he\'s out. If
he wins and doesn\'t loose too many men or spend too much money he\'s a hero.
(Bringing a war in under budget was a big thing for British generals in the
1800\'s.)

The sectors were thrown out in \'84 with atlas. "Ley Sector and Glimmerdrift
Reaches were originally sectors published by Judges Guild. The sectors in
this atlas retain the names, but are entirely newly generated. They
effectively supercede the Judges Guild products." [GDW, _Atlas of the
Imperium_, 1984, p. 2.] During MT, IIRC, they tossed the rest (in fact,
only seeker and DGP seem to have made that transition).

In fact, the only 3rd party materials (Non-GDW) that survived the atlas
were Old Expanses and Reaver\'s Deep (both originally chronicled in High
Passage or Far Traveller magazines). OE was by Jim Cunningham and Gordon
Sherridan. RD was by J Andrew Kieth. "Additional data and adventures set in
Reaver\'s Depp sector is published by Gamelords, Ltd." [ibid.]

Interesting to note is that Leroy Guatney also recieves a credit for
atlas... [ibid.]

Tactically, it\'s besieging a castle. The only real difference is that the
attackers hold the high ground.

They can sit outside the range of the non mobile planetary defenses. The
attackers can maintain mobility and grind slowly grind down the mobile
defenses. While chewing up the mobile defenses, they can spend the entire
time throwing asteroids, comets, and other space junk at the defenders until
they overwhelm the planetary defenses.  This would also be perfect cover for
landing various teams of commandos to take out the important infrastructure
and communication points.

Which brings up an important point, what stops ships from coming out of jump
closer to the world? I forget why.

Oh, every gamer in the whole world knows that feeling.  Imagine being a
"Gamma World" player.  Or, even worse, the hot potato of the gaming
industry, "Ars Magica."  And AD&D third editon.  Why, why, why?  Does anyone
but some confounded WOTC exec think this is a good idea?  Wait a minitue,
don\'t answer that, I already know the answer.

Oh, I gots some ways around this one.  Slightly left of Cannon perhaps, but
since there really isn\'t a Cannon so to speak, (and since what I\'ve heard
rumored was going to be Cannon both appals and amazes me, I don\'t mind)
ain\'t got nobody that can GP me.  But only if you want to hear them.

Here\'s the irony, *I* don\'t think that 3I is boring.  Its the old
Twilight/Merc 2000 division: there are people who like the yawning expanses
that post-apoc. can bring, and there are people that like to know that their
charaters can kill people without having to worry about gathering vegtable
matter to fuel their pick-up.  It\'s a playstyle issue, different sorts of
motivators and themes.  I would like to getting around to playing a 3I game:
its a whole new of moral morass for the players to conquer (no, you\'re not
noble yet tarnished heroes working for a better tomorrow.  Your a buch of
people with a ship, no money and big bank payments.  What do you do now?)

  IIRC it was felt that losses approaching 10% per strike were going to

I find your point generally valid.  OTOH, if you said "Earth" people would
say "home of the Solmani," and point in a general (and metaphorical)
diretion as to where it is.  Likewise, if you said "My Lai" they would say
"massacre" and odds on they would have a better chance pointing out Vietnam
on a map then say Sudan.  It is memory, not geography that is at stake here,
and nothing breeds memory like atrocity.  So, if the facts got out, they
might have something to say about it.  But continuing...

You know, it\'s funny you should bring up the Civil War issue, because it
fits in rather well.  IMHO, it was about many things, slavery included,
until A. Lincoln said with the Emancipation Proclimation, "hey everybody,
this war is about slavery!" which stood to simultainously mobilize the
moralists and African-Americans to the Union cause and turn the Confederacy
into an international paraiah.  Also in the Civil War you have incedents
like when pictures of the fields post-battle sent everybody into shock until
they were sort of unoffically banned.
So what\'s the Imperal Propoganda Machine like?  And what is the role of free
media?  So there\'s the X-boats distriubteing the offical views of
everything, and to think that the Empire is out there enforcing a standard
line to avoid potential political fallout both makes me feel good to be a
TNE player and disturbs me to think that the U.S. might be doing the same
thing.
And I accept your assertation about the value of distance in causing people
to not care about things.  But that brings up the question of the media.
Because, as you wrote earlier, the media can turn something otherwise that
the public will overlook into a topic.  Is the X-B the entirety of the
media?  Certainly they have certain...advantages so to speak, but is there
not some \'zine out there with a deceant distrubution?  Where are the
Mulders?  There are so many right and left wingers that believe in
government conspiracy in our world, and if the Imperium was intentional
holding back the truth it wouldn\'t be much of a theory.  What role for
muckrackers?  Or does the Imperium keep them down?  If they do, how do they
deal with it when the underground networks start distrubteing what they
don\'t what you to see?
I think I\'m going to log off now, and work on the "All that news is fit to
print, IN YOUR FACE!!!" campaign now.

Actually, that was one I had forgotten.  In some campaigns (gosh the memory
is going since I stopped researching this stuff through interest), the
soviets put the marker right up.  Thanks for reminding me of those Barry,
they slipped my mind all together, but for some reason, I never seem to
recall Soviet data like this as they worked on the "every man and woman is
expendable if there is a slight chance we will pull through" doctrine and
they went to extremes.  I once read that every major soviet action had
acceptable losses at over 60% if they could bring more troops up to hold the
terrain those losses we made on?

The Australian Military understands that accidents do happen, but do not
have "acceptable losses" during peace time per se (we had a Blackhawk full
of Australian SAS and the pilots die during training a couple of years ago
which was not acceptable to anyone, but the tribunal found that accidents
under these circumstances, simply do happen).

Statistically, the most dangerous posting in the British Army is to the
training area in Canada.

        Um, no.  I attack castles as a hobby, and trust me when I tell you

        Sorry.  BDK\'s (Baby Dinosaur Killers) are nukes by any other name.
Further, they are *soooo* predictable in thier trajectory that killing them
with silo-launched h-bombs is child\'s play.  If you can find one too big for
the defender to incinerate with an H-Bomb, it\'s going to take you forever to
get its course changed (looooots of inertia).  If you can dedicate the
resources to redirect it and protect it from counter-fire, its going to have
been so fracking huge it\'ll do geologic damage to the world.
        So, if you are willing to go that far, why are you bothering to
attack the place at all.  Bio/Chemo war the joint with terrorists and call
it a Red Zoned Plague World.  <shrug>

        Actually, I don\'t know.  I believe the 100d limit works both ways,
although I do not know if that is TML convention or actually canon.  In my
TNEC milieu, I use 10/100 for jumping out and 5/50 for the limits coming

Also, if the Imperium tends to put recruits from an area into the same unit
(which would make logistical sense*), then that field hospital might
contain most of the recruits from Podunk\'s Class of 998. This would tend to
emphasize the tragedy.

*I\'m using "unit" here in a broad sense. I see the Imperium attaching
recruits to Army units in the region, rather than shipping single soldiers
across the Imperium.

I\'ll grant you American ignorance, but I\'m not convinced that it translates
to Imperial ignorance.

For one thing, a great many American maps (ie. virtually all of the ones
I\'ve seen) tend to show America alone, with Canada and Mexico blank. (Heck,
most of those maps don\'t even have the Canadian coastline, so it looks like
there\'s this long straight shoreline...) And all the American atlases that
I\'ve seen devote more space to the USA than to the rest of the world.
Couple that with the Amero-centric coverage by US media (including CNN) and
I\'m surprised that so many Americans know _anything_ about the rest of us.

I can see Solomani maps ending at the border, with vaguely marked "alien
hordes" and "barbarian states" beyond. Ditto for K\'kree.

I use the canonical 100 diameter \'curb\', with the addition of the 100 
diameter \'solar curb\'.  And no, I *don\'t* use \'armored beachballs from Hell\' 
for defenses, or the \'DSR\'.  IMNSFHBO, Traveller space combat is lethal 
enough without having instant death dealt out by the first shooter to win the 
combat at ridiculous distances.

Only fair. After all, during WWI the most dangerous posting in the Canadian
Army was under a British general :-(

(British generals of the period regarded colonials as cheap replacements,
and a way of cutting casualty reports to England.)

My idea on this was something seriously ambulatory.  Fast moving, and land
based (although there could be a sea based species of it).  I was thinking
that it would move at least as fast as an Earth slug, or snail maybe faster.

If this is a part of Vland biology (or mutated Terran transplant?), where
could it fit in the food chain/grand scheme?

Just some thoughts.

Minor nit...most of the US civilian reaction to Tet was because the Pentagon
spin-docs had been telling us for about two years that the enemy _couldn\'t_ do
anything like that. They had been beaten back and mostly destroyed, and
victory was right around the corner. 

While Tet, in a twisted way, put the truth to that lie, it wasn\'t so much that
Walter thought we were were doing badly, it was that we were so obviously lied
to in the past. The Pentagon lost the confidence of the majority of Americans
at that point, whereas, despite the vocalness of the anti-war protestors, they
had until then, been a minority.

It all depends on how completely the 3I contols the news services. The
Solomani Rim War wasn\'t some anti-communist police action in some backwater,
but an invasion of the 3I by a major outside power.

I doubt even given the horrific casualties, the population of the 3I would be
all that opposed to the war. The places where the troops would be recruited
from would be closest to the action; they had a clear stake in stopping the
Solomani advances. During the Vietnam war, the US\' stake in the war was never
very clear, \'Stopping Commies\' was about as clearly as it was ever elucidated.

\'The Solomai Commie Fleet has invaded and occupied x subsectors, and must be
stopped!\' is a much clearer and palatable goal for the civilian masses.

Besides, since when did the 3I care about what the civilian masses thought,
ever? So long as the nobles control the fleet, the masses don\'t get much say.

Well, that pretty much followed \'conventional wisdom\' of the day, when every
Soviet soldier was this superhuman killing machine riding on invincible tanks
that apparently used no fuel or parts whatsoever...

Too bad that we can\'t bill the CIA spooks for part of the US national debt,
arising from them telling Ronnie what he wanted to hear instead of the truth,
which was that the Warsaw pact countries could mount a scary-assed advance
into Europe for about 100 miles, then they\'d have to stop and wait a day or
two for their fuel supplies...stored back under lock and guard in Russia so
the field commanders wouldn\'t sell the stuff on the black market to supplement
their incomes...

obTrav: Lucan is the obvious one, but how many _other_ emperors have been told
what they wanted to hear by their intel resources? Perhaps things like the
Psionic Supressions and the Solomani Rim War arose from such blunders.

At the height of their losses, the US bombing runs were running 10%+ losses
per _mission_. Given that the bomber crews had had their mission load raised
to 32 missions at that point, 10% per mission meant you were buying it sooner
or later, period. But soon after that, the P51\'s arrived in theatre to provide
round trip fighter escort, and the losses went way down (on the US side, that
is). The first Ploesti raid had something like 40-50% losses (IIRC), but
again, that was a particularly unusual mission; many of the casualties occured
not because the enemy shot them down, but that the pilots were too exhausted
to land the planes by the time they got back, or that the planes ran out of fuel.

100% in the case of some units, but that was truly special circumstances, as
most of the US planes got _lost_, and the only ones to find the Japanes
carriers arrived sans fighter escort and low on fuel, which made them
lunchmeat for the Japanese Zeroes.

10% per strike is really demoralizing on a routine basis. The USAAF bomber
crews were _really_ close to mutiny before the Mustangs arrived.

"Zhodani Philosophies" and "Religion in the Two Thousand Worlds"
appeared in JTAS (#23 and #24, maybe; in that range).  There is an
article about Aslan religion somewhere, too, maybe in JTAS.  We\'re
discussing Vland and Vilani culture on the Traveller Culture mailing

You\'re right; Traveller just doesn\'t address this issue (so far as I
know), not even with a handwave.  I did read an article in I think
Challenge Magazine dealing with quarantine and decontamination
procedures experienced by interstellar travellers in the 2300 AD
universe.  I\'d expect that the procedures would be less invasive and
delaying at Imperial tech levels.  On the other hand, many worlds are at
very low tech levels and have only rudimentary starports.  Those worlds
are at great risk of all sorts of disease and ecological problems if
they don\'t institute appropriate procedures.

This makes me think of one of my favorite science fiction novels, To Die
in Italbar, by Roger Zelazny.  It\'s about a man with great healing
powers who becomes a vector for plagues.

I just finished "Virus" the movie last night. Glad I didn\'t waste cash on it

But all I could think about was deckplans/blueprints of the research vessel.
Anyone know if they are on the web somewhere? Pictures? I will start looking

The loss comparison between Eighth Air Force strikes on Germany and the
US Navy/USMC aviators at Midway is not a valid standard, for the
following reasons:

1.  No single non-nuclear strike against a strategic (land-based) enemy
target could have an immediate effect comparable to the effect of
knocking out three of the six Japanese fleet carriers in one blow
(HIRYU, the fourth Japanese fleet carrier lost at Midway, fell victim to
subsequent strikes).  Depriving the Imperial Japanese Navy of its
primary offensive arm was worth nearly any losses among naval aviators,
especially since the US Navy had a robust pilot training program to
replace lost aviators.  The primary tragedy of Midway (for the US Navy)
was that the battle occurred just prior to the replacement of the
thoroughly-obsolete TBD "Devastator" torpedo bomber by the TBF/TBM
"Avenger."  Had the battle occurred a couple of months later, USS
HORNET\'s Torpedo Squadron Eight would likely have had more than one
survivor out of 30 aircrew.

2.  No US carrier-based aircraft in the Battle of Midway carried more
than 2 personnel.  In contrast, B-17s in the Eighth Air Force carried a
crew of about 10 personnel (based on crew photo, B-17G "Screwball
Express").  Further, aircraft losses in (victorious) naval battles did
not convert directly to crew losses.  For instance, at Midway, out of
163 American aviators (pilots and crew) shot down, at least 27 were
recued by PBY Catalina flying boats [Keegan, _The Price of Admiralty_,
page 249].  Keegan mentions also [ibid, page 249] that other air crew
were rescued by other means (since he doesn\'t specify numbers, I
won\'t).  B-17 crews, OTOH, were less likely to be recovered, and more
likely to become PWs (that\'s what happens when you overfly enemy
territory...).

3.  Total personnel losses by the winning side at Midway (fewer than
1000 [Keegan, _The Price of Admiralty_, page 249]) were far fewer than
those suffered by the Germans (the tactical victors) at Jutland (just
over 2500 [ibid, page 177]).  With far fewer fatalities, the US Navy
achieved a far more decisive victory at Midway than the German High Seas
Fleet achieved at Jutland.

ObTrav:  I would expect that the perceptions of "acceptable" losses
would vary wildly in the 3I\'s armed forces, depending on the branch in
question.  For instance, the Imperial Navy would likely _expect_ to lose
25% or more of its warships committed to attacking a heavily-defended
system.  Imperial Marines and Imperial Army jump troops probably expect
to lose 20% or so of their forces just getting dirtside from orbit. 
Regular Imperial Army forces, OTOH, would be _appalled_ to see 20%
losses in a unit through an entire campaign.

It doesn\'t sound like anything I\'ve seen, and that is a nice size. Go ahead
and send me a copy please. If I recognize it, I\'ll get back to you.

I was wondering; it seems that some folks are concerned with size on Web

	I dunno. I\'ve got a 16.something" ... I don\'t mind large images WHEN
I choose to download them. What bugs me is sites that take forever to
view any of the pages because they\'re full of images, and especially
sites that use images extensively or even exclusively for navigation.
Those sites are really slow to view, can\'t be viewed with
imageloading turned off, and can\'t be properly indexed or searched.

than 1024x800: my desktop is 1152x864 ...

I wouldn\'t worry about their dental plan, I\'d worry more about your major

I\'ve just got back (well, I got back a few hours ago ;-) ) from GenCon UK
99 - it went well; the tournaments were run, along with GT and T4 demos,
plus a FT playtest... Met quite a few TMLrs (photos soon) and we launched
SpaceDogs and Khiidkar Incident on a receptive public.

Jesse\'s SpaceDogs cover was really popular, and caught peoples attention.
That isn\'t really a surprise though...

Anyway - two of the UK retailers (Leisure Games and Best Books & Games)
have limited numbers of the two adventures now (what we didn\'t sell) and
the rest will be in the retail chain just as soon as we get the print run
back...

But it\'s late, I\'m tired, and I\'ll tell more some other time,

Before I forget though...

Rush out and buy MAG-BLAST! by Fantasy Flight Games. It\'s a small non-CCG
(ie a complete card game) for 2-6 players which is set in the Twilight
Imperium game universe. Each player takes a race and protects their
flagship with a selection of scouts, destroyers, cruisers, dreadnoughts and
carriers, then fights out a battle to destroy the enemy flagships and win
the game. It\'s fast, self contained and great fun (reminds me of Nuclear
War for some reason). The BITS crew spent a lot of down time playing this
(included several too-late nights). It retails for 13.95 GBP and the guy
from FFG told me that it\'s had disappointing sales :-( but thats nothing to
do with the game itself! It looks a bit like a twin deck starter CCG and I
reckon that has put people off it. Buy this game now and have a fun time
with your friends.

The other one you may want to try is the Puppetland RPG by John Tynes. It
has a bonus meta-game on the top, called PowerKill, designed to run with
any RPG. In it you get to analyse your player character\'s recent actions,
pretending they are a delusional person being treated by a counsellor.
Their characters actions are then translated into equivalent real crimes,
and you look at the differences in their responses..... quite fun with the
right group...

Hmm...Here\'s a bizzare one...I have a pet prediction on the trend of "Western 
standards of attractiveness as I see the trend (in the states anyway) 
underway already. The new standard for the rich is physical perfection. The 
rich can afford the gyms and health spas, the expensive health foods and the 
expensive activewear clothing- they will all look like olympic athletes. The 
poor look like fat slobs because they eat cheap fattening food (I always 
notice when I go on a diet how my food bill skyrockets because pasta, rice, 
bread, canned starches, etc. are much cheaper than fresh fruits and 
vegetables, and packaged low fat and low carbohydrate health foods); they 
wear ugly poor fitting off the rack clothing, and don\'t have the time and 
money to excersize. The middle classes will tend to copy the rich to a lesser 
degree (chain gyms instead of health spas, supermarket health food instead of 
personal health chefs, high end mass market clothing, instead of tailor made, 
etc...).

I can see this continuing in the 3I as having either the super muscle look, 
or perhaps the super lean endurence runner-gymnast look, be considered the 
ideal. The recruiters would no doubt love having all of their recruits 
already have completed the physical conditioning end of basic training...:-).

Of course I could be 180 degrees wrong and having the "rich and famous" in 
the 3I going back to a fat look, as this shows they have the wealth to not 
EVER have to exert themselves (I get a quick mental image of the movie DUNE\'s 
Baron Harkonen minus the horrible skin disease...)

At one point the British were running even higher at night, and they 
were also forced to do something _really_ quickly. Nightfighter 
versions of the Mosquito was one major countermeasure. IIRC on of 
their 1000 bomber raids lost about 130 planes to flak, nightfighters, 
etc.

I think there\'s a big difference between the size of a page you-re 
loading up for its content, and a picture you\'re knowingly downloading 
because it looks cool. I\'m quite happy to wait for a really neat picture 
to load up if I\'ve selected it from a thumbnail, but I hate pages that 
have massive background graphics, or java scripts that have to run 
before I can see anything.

As for the second part of your post I have a P133 with a 33.6K 
modem and the screen is set at 1024x768 with 16 bit colour (mainly 
so I can have Jesse\'s Sulieman-2 picture as a desktop).

Well I don\'t suppose they really count as emperors, but by my

OTOH you could well end up with all these people with wonderful 
muscle defination and tone, but no real strength or endurance. You 
already see this in a fair number of women who want good tone, but 
a paranoid about ending up with \'masculine\' muscle bulk on the arms 
and upper body.

So do I. From what I\'ve seen in local rpg stores (or rather what hasn\'t 
been there) DnD has been steadily fading in the last few years, and 
with it the rest of the hobby. IMO it\'s about time for a new edition of 
DnD - 10 years after ADnD2, and I\'m really pleased they\'ve bitten the 
bullet and done a proper job of revising it. Now if only they get rid of 
exceptional strength.

Not answering your question (sorry) but just a comment... I am beginning
to suspect a trend of historical revisionism, intent on giving credit to
Cleon I for having invented everything good in the Imperium. Time was, 
it was generally held that the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service was
formed somewhere in the 600s when the Imperium started to expand after
the civil wars, and a need was seen for a specialized service whose job
was exploration and mapping beyond the frontier. Now in the latest works
(GT) we read about how the IISS actually developed out of an equivalent
Sylean service.

The Imperial Ministry of Propaganda is certainly working overtime these
days. :)

Hey, don\'t peg this on G:T.  The origins of the IISS in the Sylean
Federation are attested as far back as Classic Traveller Book 6, and
confirmed in the T4 Milieu 0 sourcebook.

After the Civil War, the Scout Service took on some new functions -- the
X-boat service, for instance.  But that was because its original functions of
exploration and contact were becoming less important.  The Imperium did
most of its expanding *before* the Civil War, not after.

If you\'re gonna complain about G:T revising canon, at least double-
check to make sure what canon *was* before G:T came along :-).

Gazelle Close Escorts were designed at a time when the Imperial Navy was
worried about mutinies, which is why the officers are separated from the
men. (This seemed relevant trivia.)

Why would you think that?

(Serious question, not sarcasm.)

Traveller is, at heart, a paper-and-pencil game. In fact, other than
Jesse\'s artwork there\'s little out for Traveller that would require a
high-end computer.

FWIW, I\'m running on a 5-year-old Macintosh with 14" monitor, and about the
only thing I can\'t do (that I want to) is use Poser to create minis. (OK,
and I can\'t emulate the latest version of Windows, which would be useful to
run a few Traveller programs, but I\'m reasonably content with my own
Traveller software.)

Sorry to push your limits :)  Anyway, the future will see versions of the
pics at approx 800x600, 1024x768, and 1152x864.  Don\'t see much call for
beyond that.  I say "approx" \'cause some of the pics may / have been cropped
in interesting ways for higher visual appeal or drama.  If this is a
problem, I\'d suggest the excellent shareware program ThumbsPlus
(www.cerious.com).  I do all my graphics wrangling, conversion, thumnailing,
and wallpapering with this program.

Standards can change in as little as a couple of generations. I remember
comments being made about Kate Winslet and how she looked in the film
"Titanic", comments to the effect that she looked a little on the heavy
side... never mind the fact that in 1912, her build would have been
considered very attractive, while someone with the physique of a 1990\'s
supermodel back then would have been quarantined on the suspicion of having
come down with consumption (ie, tuberculosis)...

Anyway, back to ObTrav/on-topic:
I can imagine quite a variation on desireability from one end of the
Imperium to the other. Given that the speed of communication is only
as fast as the jump drive, and given that most people never leave their
home subsector (or even their homeworld), society in the Spinward Marches
is likely to be quite different than society in the Solomani Rim. There
may well be regional differences between the two. Solimani women like
the Kirk Douglas look, while the Spinward Marches women prefer someone
more like Pierce Brosnan, that sort of thing.

>How are standards of beauty influenced by interplay between cultures?  I
>mean, were we influenced by Vilani standards of beauty???  Which are???

Given the bureaucracy mindset of the Vilani, along with the everything-
in-its-place mentality, I would imagine that the Vilani ideal would be
something akin to the hypothetical average or mean values...

>What do Vargr think is beautiful?  (I had a great Vargr chara with

Vargr would probably place more value on how someone *smells* than how
someone *looks*... 

Meanwhile, the Aslan view is one of how much land one appears to own...

*adventure*...  not the panic of making a bank payment on time.  <shrug>
Rather much like trying to get fired up about making this month\'s mortgage

Well......I had an opinion on this once (which side it was on isn\'t really
relevant.)

I made the mistake of mentioning it on the Trav Tech list. It spawned a
three week shouting match as either side presented the proof that the other
side\'s plans would never work. I decided I was looking at it from the wrong
angle.

Normally, you plan for what you expect, and you sink a lot of money into
defending against the expected attack. For example, I cite the Maginot Line.
If you have a bigger economy than the attacker and he attacks like you
expected him to, he will not win. (You may not win either, but war has a way
of being nasty like that.)

Most of the decisive victories in war happen either because the winner had a
sizeably bigger economy, or because the winner attacked the loser in ways
that had not been anticipated.

I think you hit the nail right on the head there -- Anime is very much a
niche market in North America, and niche markets don\'t do very well when
it comes to merchandising.

The popularity of Pokemon probably has more to do with the game itself
than anything else... and I can see that one eventually going the way of
the Tamogotchi. :)

        100d from the star makes sense.   It makes for a serious problem
trying to hike in as a blocade runner, and exposes outgoing vessels to
privateers, et al as they try and get to the 100d.  However, it increases

It depends.

Are you trying to win their hearts and minds, or crushing them and their
little dog Toto too?

If you hope to have some popular support, you make it very clear that you
will only attack military targets.  This is a two-edged sword, because
while it severely limits your options, it might help swing popular opinion
your way, and you might get a ground-based resistance operation started.

Going for the knock out punch, you make unrestricted war.  Look at the
civilian deaths in Japan and Germany.  You attack with everything to
totally destroy not just the military might, but the underlying support for
that military.

I took an interesting course in the Vietnam War a few years ago, and the
professor traced the growing mainstream opposition in part to the
appearance of the soldiers the public saw on their TV screens.  Many of
these people were WWII or Korea vets just far enough removed from their
service to have forgotten the reality, and the visual impact of your common
Grunt circa 1968, coupled with the growing agitation in youth culture all
over the country, lead to a strong belief that we couldn\'t win.

When people saw the US embassy being overrun, it just cemented the idea
that we were helpless.

By controlling the X-boat system, and more importantly the naval couriers,
the Imperium has an excellent way to trump the newsies.  Say that the 15th
Freedonian Infantry has been destroyed.  The news first comes to the
Freedonian government by courier, and they have anywhere from weeks to
months to prepare.

Perhaps Klingons shed teeth like sharks?  Makes sense for a predator, since

There is nothing wrong with Klingon dental plans. Klingon teeth are
*supposed* to look that way. Lt. Torres on Voyager is half-human, and
obviously takes after her human parent when it comes to how her teeth
turned out. And Worf\'s teeth look a little more human than what is 
otherwise normal for a Klingon because he was raised by humans who
didn\'t know any better and took Worf to a good orthodontist to get his
teeth in line... :)

(Somehow, though, I can\'t imagine an adolescent Worf with braces on...
maybe in the 24th century, Earth dental care has evolved past them?)

And what is dental care like in the 3I and environs? Do Vargr chew on
specially-made substances to clean their teeth (akin to Milk-Bone here
on Earth)?

Sorry, that was not my intention, to pin it on GT. My reference to
GT was intended as a passing comment, an example. There are others,
such as that in the TNE book (The section "Down in front, Cleon", for
example), and what I hear second-hand about Milieu 0 (which I never
heard of before starting to read the list regularly.)

In fact, it was the release of GT that rekindled my interest in
Traveller, having been both a fan of the original game in various
incarnations (CT, MT, TNE) and a long-time GURPS player (10 years or
so).

Wasn\'t most of the expansion through Corridor and Deneb into the Spinward
Marches and its environs post-Civil War? My mid-Imperial history is a little
fuzzy. I\'m still trying to unravel the different timelines that diverge in
1116 -- I keep having these images Dulinor finding Strephon in his shower.

(A little gag from the GT main book, for those who haven\'t read it yet.)

Which pre-GT canon are we discussing: CT, MT, TNE, T4, Milieu 0? There
are so many, each having made its own revisions to the canon along the
way. I used GT as an offhand example, not as an intent to place the blame
there entirely. My apologies for being unclear. (Yes, I do recognize
your name. I\'m now waiting for the lightning to strike...)  :-D

(BTW, I am currently running a GT campaign myself... it even has its own
web site.)

Actually, no, the Spinward Marches were pretty thoroughly settled and
integrated into the Imperium well before the Civil War.  Recall that both
the admiral who set off the Civil War and the one who finally won it both
came to it fresh from having fought off the Zhodani. . .

Yes, that is a problem.  Canon has definitely been a moving target even
in the official GDW material. . .to say nothing of all the "approved for
Traveller" releases, fan material and whatnot, some of which has been
very good but a lot of which contradicts itself.  I can attest that when
doing new material for G:T, reconciling all the different sources is not
trivial.

Who says that 3I characters aren\'t a bunch of "noble yet tarnished heroes
working for a better tomorrow"?

Sure, they\'ve got to work for a living, but that doesn\'t mean what they do
is any less noble than what anyone else does.  After all, if the 3I
characters had \'succeeded\', you wouldn\'t have had the Hard Times, or the
Collapse.  That, after all, is part of what the 3I setting is (or can be)
about - to stave off the forces of darkness, and to prevent the \'next Long
Night\'.  The Flandry thing is part of the 3I setting.

The other \'great noble task\' of the 3I setting is to change the Imperium
itself.  Let\'s face it - it\'s a \'not quite Good Empire\', even if it\'s not
an \'Evil Empire\'.  There are abuses and injustices in the 3I that it\'s
perfectly sane to oppose, whether it\'s world by world, or on a larger
scale.  The \'Liberation\' of worlds is just as possible in the 3I setting as
it is in any other.  You don\'t have to play an Ine Givar campaign to do
this, either.  There\'s at least a tacit assumption in the Mercenary style
games that what the players are fighting for is better than what currently
exists, even though it may seem that the players are just \'thugs for hire\'.

Yes, 3I games can be about selling comfortable shoes to the Aslan, but
those games aren\'t really very interesting.  Usually, I suspect, such
activities are the side issues to the real game - nobbling the Kforuzeng,
or saving Raschev from the Chamax.  One thing I\'m seriously considering is
a scenario/mini-campaign set on Tarsus in the GT setting, opposing an Aslan
invasion.

Different settings tend to support different types of games.  To a great
degree, the setting you choose will depend on the kind of feel you want for
your game.  There is no real point to an argument about which is best, so I
will stop here.

Of course, in the end, home-brew settings are probably the best, since they
most precisely match what the individual referee wants...

Well, apart from the commando assaults, a lot of this is true.  The trouble
is, if you want to actually keep the world, the amount of damage you do is
the amount you have to repair afterwards.  If 10 billion of your newly-won
citizens are starving, you\'ve got a bit of a problem.  Using terror is
militarily legitimate, but it tends to rebound on you.

The other problem is that your targets will hate you.  One of the
\'advantages\' of the oligarchic structure of most of the TU\'s interstellar
states is that the loyalty of the common citizens of the worlds of any
state is likely to be relatively shallow at any level above the world
itself.  In other words, once you take out the government and military,
many of the citizens probably don\'t care all that much if the Emperor is
Dulinor or Lucan, or if they\'re members of the Imperium or the Solomani
Confederation (at least until SolSec gets to work).  They might prefer to
keep the planetary government they chose, but in many cases these
governments would be fairly expendable juntas or noble cliques.

If you start nuking them, however, you are likely to spark popular
opposition.  Think about Northern Ireland, or East Timor, spread over a
world with billions of inhabitants.  You may be able to prevent the
rebellion from succeeding, but you would never be able to crush it.  For
evidence of this, look at what happened on Terra when the Solomani rolled
over the border during the Rebellion.  Terra *had* been pacified after the
Solomani Rim War over a century before, but erupted into revolt at the
first opportunity.

You will often get better results in the long run if you pick your targets
more carefully in the short term, and take the resulting losses.  Even so,
I wouldn\'t like to be around during one of the assaults....

Of course I have made some pretty sweeping generalisations in the above
stuff, but the whole discussion tends to be a bit generalised, so I will
forgive myself.

This would be true in general, but there are limits.

I suspect that the Rebellion could have been one of these limiting cases. 
After 10-15 years of apparently pointless and unsuccessful warfare, at
least some factions might have had problems recruiting.  That is,
volunteers would be getting thin on the ground, and conscripts would be
getting less willing.  Result:  your armed forces deteriorate in morale,
and possibly in numbers.  Eventually you end up in a situation where you
can\'t mount worthwhile offensives, and Hard Times result.

This can be used as one of the reasons why the Solomani switched to a proxy
war strategy in areas like Diaspora, and can continue into the early 1130s
if you want to extend the Hard Times.

Since I\'m on this tangent, if you allow Dulinor\'s ship to misjump for
non-Virus reasons, and his death to occur at the \'official\' time, you can
neutralise his victory, by splitting his faction between Admiral Hutara,
controlling the fleet, and eventually Capital, and Isis, who controls Dlan,
but sees going to Capital for her coronation as a suicidal risk, putting
her entirely in the power of the next in line to the Throne.  Lucan, of
course, would become a lame duck once Capital falls, and probably would get
his throat cut, leaving Tranian free to declare for Margaret.

You can easily continue the Hard Times up to 1135 or so by doing this.

Just name the ship class whatever name I assign it, and mention that

I would amend this to "military-owned" targets.  After all, power
generation and distribution facilities, transportation nexi (bridges,
rail junctions, airports, etc.), and communications nodes (radio and TV
stations, telephone exchanges, etc.) are all vital military targets. 
However, the destruction of these facilities will have far more direct
impact on the civilian population than, say, bombing the living tar out
of Pearl Harbor.

Exactly.  One thing that people sometimes forget is that the military
does not exist in isolation.  In order efficiently to cripple a military
force, one must attack any vulnerable support structures for that
military.  As I noted above, that includes everything from power plants
to water treatment facilities.  Further, in the absence of precision
munitions to destroy war materiel factories, one way to reduce enemy war
materiel production is to kill or maim the civilian factory workers. 
Another way to do so is to prevent raw materials from reaching the
centers of enemy industry.  All of these methods have direct impact on
the civilian population.

This is part of what Clausewitz meant when he described war as a
continuation of politics.  One must first decide on the desired goal,
and then must tailor the use (if any) of armed force in such a way as to
achieve that goal.  

One problem in Vietnam is that the Johnson Administration failed to set
a specific goal, with a plan on how to achieve that goal; thus, with the
Tet Offensive, the public decided that the cost of getting nowhere was
too high.  Had there been a clearly-defined goal and strategy, the Tet
Offensive quite possibly would have been seen as a positive thing for
the US.

To everyone except native Southerners.  We either have to grapple
with the more complex issues or with the immorality of our
great-great grandparents...or both.  Turns out, mine didn\'t own
slaves, but would have if they could have afforded them...talk about
moral ambiguity.

Your basic point is correct, though.  It\'s unlikely that events on
one end of the 3I would be more than simple propaganda points on the
other ends, separated as they are in space and time.

 I ran that set of numbers using Book 6 (for the Stellar Radii table) and 
found *in general* that K and M stars\' jump horizon is beyond the habitable 
orbit, G stars are a tossup, and the younger stars (O,B,A & F) rarely if ever 
reach the habitable orbit. This generalization applies best to Type V stars, 
but can be used for nearly any of them in a pinch...

Potentially there is no other Imperium wide communication system. I can
conceive of a local system of couriers that might serve a subsector.
MegaCorps almost certainly use a message transport system of their own to
carry vital company traffic. Only the X-Boats go to every Sector in the
Imperium. Any magazine, news vid, or editorials not sent by this method will
be of local distribution only and not likely to effect Imperium policy.

Every rule has an exception (including this one). Capital and Core subsector
specifically, will be more susceptible to muckraker / yellow journalism /
rumor
tabloids. But be careful what you say. The Emperor is above reproach, and
slandering certain members of the Moot might be unwise. Of course a
judiciously placed editorial might convince a highly placed official in MOC
or MOD to change that policy in your favor, or even declare that handy
little war you\'d like to see happen.

Local media at the Domain capitals might exercise similar influence.

Guess what?  I play it too.  Or did rather, as I don\'t get the chance to
game really anymore (for some reason the Chicago-city proper seems to be
rather desert-like that way, or they\'ve all been hiding from me.)  In fact,
I consider myself a coinsure of dead games: TNE, Gamma World, and
Cybergeneration.  And you have to agree that four editions of something
tends to put people throught the ringer.

I believe that this is one of the problems that the 3I is still facing
(circa 1115) on Earth. A population ready to revolt. I would expect that
should they successfully throw off the 3I and be absorbed into the Solomani
Confederation, then a series of actions against that government would result
(both from Imperium loyalists and from Terra First self-rulists.)

It\'s not a matter of computer power or monitor size. It\'s a bandwidth issue.
Someone who is paying for download time by the minute (as many of our fellow
TML members outside the US do) and/or downloading through a 14k 0r 32k pipe
are much more sensitive to file size and number of images than someone who
is lucky enough to connect to the net through a cable modem or T-1 line.

**Designer\'s Notes**

This is a quick-and-dirty HG2 design, based on one I had on file.  I
haven\'t crunched the economic numbers for it; however, I suspect that
this ship would require subsidy.  The D\'ANCONIA-class, at just under
twice the price of a standard CT Type M Subsidized Merchant, carries
just under twice the cargo.  Passenger capacity is less (12 high/medium
passengers, as opposed to 21 in the Type M), and low passenger capacity
is far lower (10, as compared with 80 in the Type M).  However, note
that the D\'ANCONIA-class has greater maneuverability than the Type M. 
Further, the design cost includes armament required for most subsidy
routes.  Third, the D\'ANCONIA-class is fully streamlined, and includes a
fuel purification plant (both of these features should make the
D\'ANCONIAs less costly to operate than the Type M).  Finally, the
addition of .3 extra power plant (simulating the specification for
backup power) added nearly MCr 22 to the ship\'s price, and absorbed
nearly 10 dtons of additional cargo space.

One interesting feature of this design under HG2 is that a 2-G maneuver
drive was actually cheaper (by MCr 4) than a 1-G drive.

(memo to self - just because you think a question is rhetorical doesn\'t mean
it is)I\'ve avoided closing the window of judgment just yet, and it only will
fall when I have actual paper in my hands.  I\'ve heard both good and bad
things.  My hesitiaions lie to a general priniciple of fear when WOTC gets
involved in something.  IMHO they were doing a fine job with the "re-second
edition" books and adventures they were putting out, largely.
It\'s interesting to see it in the light of the differences between AD&D and
T, where as one made an instution out of a setting and the other out of a
rules base.

I\'m breaking one of my own rules (Don\'t cite material when you can\'t get to
it to verify). But it\'s late (almost midnight here) and my G:FT is in my
sleeping son\'s room. (I just can\'t seem to keep my 14 year old away from my
RPG source books. :^) )

I believe that G:FT covers these subjects in passing, with a reference to a
more detailed description of the subject promised in GT:Starports.

OTOH, I never ran Traveller without a calculator handy. *grin*

So, to answer your question, if you propse that Traveller is a game that is
predisposed to some degree of mathmatical talent, and correlate that with
the fact that there are a lot of Gearheads out there who throw themselves
throughougly into the mathmatics, and then refrence that with the sterotype
that the kind of people who have good at and with computers are the kind
that are also good at math, and the kind of people that are good at and with
computers will strive to have good ones.  Traveller players have good
computers.  Q.E.D.
Or at least one way of looking at it.  I cannot attest to its truth as I am
neither good at math nor terribly proficent at computers, and only own a
deceant one (notebook, 366 Pent Cele, 64 ram, 800X600) because it had been a
good seven years and the last one had gone "solid-state" (the disk and cd
rom drives no longer worked) and you had to hit it on occassion when the
hard drive slipped (no, I don\'t know why this worked.  Computer
professionals had no idea why it worked, and were vaguly aghast.)

It works even better if you don\'t deal with a planetary limit at all, but *always* use the stellar 100 dia.  IMO, of course.

SPI\'s "Strategy II". It\'s a "generic" game the has scenarios from
ancients thru modern. The best part of the line about nuclear war is
that it continues "and the next game should start with <earliest
ancients scenario>".

More to the point, changes *propogate*. And we can\'t predict how far or
how fast. 

I remember dealing with the issue of "weather control" *spells* in D&D.
I used the weather rules from Chivalry and sorcery simply because they
where the *only* rules that were avialable at the time that had you
rolling "deltas" rather than "absolutes". 

That is, you rolled to determine how the weather would *change*, not to
determine what it *was*. For example a roll for temperature would be
"up", "unchanged" , or "down". There were biases built in to keep
things from getting really out of hand for the season. Or more
accurately, to make it *unlikely* to get too far from normal. 

So when you control the weather, you forcibly *drag* the system into a
given state. Which becomes the "previous state" of the next set of
rolls. Which meant that the weather could wind up "different" for a
week or more. 

"Merely" seeding the clouds wilkl at the very least mean that you are
depriving areas downwind of you of the rain they\'d have otherwise
gotten. There *will* be lawsuits from farmers. And possibly from other
folks who depend on the water from the rain. 

Check out the sort of fights that occur over water usage along a river,
such as the Colorado. Figure that weather control will start even
*worse* fights. And likely have even worse effects ecologically.

Well, you *can* eliminate Virus. You just have to have tech that\'s too
*dumb* to infect, and use that to examine every single bit of "higher"
tech that is found in an infected area. Anything other than information
storage is considered raw materials, and recycled via smelting or worse.

Info storage media can generally be read bit by bit be some *very*
crude hardware. Too crude to infect. Transcribe it all onto read only
media, and then have some slightly brighter gear look for tell-tale
patterns that indicate encoded virus. 

Most of the info can be thrown away anyway. Any reference works you
already have are junked. Later editions are carefully compared
("mechanically") with earlier editions and lists of changes made. Those
can be edited in to *new* copies, but can\'t transfer the virus. 

Stuff like statistical data and financial records just plain isn\'t
worth the risk of recovering, so it gets slagged too. Fiction and art
and going to be a matter of priorities, but I expect that they may get
the axe as well.

That\'s OK :) I also went to 1024x768 because on moving from Win95 
to NT4 I found that the NT drivers will run my video card/screen

An interesting solution.  Now here\'s the KCr 64 question:

Given _really_ good air conditioning, quite a bit of room, and enough
time (both for construction, and for down-time while changing burned-out
tubes), could one build vacuum-tube/mechanical relay computers
sophisticated enough to:

1.  Detect Virus?

2.  Provide the data-processing needed to run a high-tech society?

If so, would vacuum-tubes and mechanical relays be sufficiently
resistant to Virus to make the effort worthwhile, at least for dirtside
needs?

Hmm, I hadn\'t thought of that. Are humans the only species that is sexually
active regardless of metabolic cycle? What is up with benoboes(sp?)? Are
they just always in heat? Do the Aslan go into heat? I know Hiver
sexuallity, as it is tied into their culture deeply, but I had never thought
about the other races. What is the difference between "heat" and "estrus"?
ISTR heat is just the common term, estrus the clinical, but I\'m not sure.
Why don\'t humans go into heat? Sorry if these are basic questions, but I
always get such well worded answers on this list.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to produce a localized and persistant high pressure ridge? Idea being to eventually change the course of a jet stream, creating an El Nino type effect in some part of a world.

I think the teeth thing is a Klingon fashion statement, very hot to other

Lets face it, here and now, there are cultural groups in Europe and the US

This may have been in "Third World War" or "The Next War" by the greatly
missed SPI. Ah..."The Next War", the Europa of the Cold War. Some
friends and I back in the mid-eighties (when GDW\'s Assault and TWW came
out) played SPI\'s monster Warsaw Pact/Nato theatre war simulation. As I
recall it took us seven weeks to complete the game, playing about two
times a week for three+hours a session. NATO won. Russia\'s Warsaw Pact
nations rebelled when the Soviet Attack bogged down in Fulda. Poland
went neutral and the logistics train of the Russians dried up and the
government is the USSR collapsed. This fortunately happened at the same
time the first NATO tac-nukes were deployed. At the time, we heard from
other idiots trying this game that it went nuke in about three turns
just about every time they played it. Ours went longer because the
people I was playing with at Old Dominion University were mostly US and
foreign military officers at NATO\'s staff college in Norfolk, VA. They
as a group whether playing Next "never finish" War or GDW\'s cold war
stuff showed a restraint in using NBC that I hardly ever saw in
civilians, even those who were particularly well versed in defense
policy. It\'s ironic that the most bloodthirsty have never trained or
fought for war. None of the guys I knew were that crazy and were very
Sun Tzu is their thinking. Only the \'geeks\' nuked \'em til they glowed.

OBTraveller: How ingrained is the willingness to use NBC bred into 3I
and its belligerents? Gas use in WWI put a bitter taste in planners
mouths on all sides in WWII (although there is plenty of evidence the
Japanese were ready to use it to defend Manchuria and the Home Islands
in the end.) Perhaps use of Nukes on earth in the future or in the Nth
interstellar wars gave everybody the willies. The Vlani as we understand
it were more than willing to use nukes on an enemy that couldn\'t
adequately retaliate.I feel the Terrans could and would play a dirtier
game than the Vlanis. We\'re good at it, especially on enemies we define
as \'non-human\' and uncivilized.(Visions of George C. Scott and Curtis
LeMay..shivver) Did the Zhodani and the Impies dose each other in their
five little "police actions"? Nobody wants to play a game were the only
smart thing to do is not play at all {Wargames}.

Point well taken.  As a side note, I\'ve had people refuse to play in my

that it isn\'t handed out as part and parcel with the proposed campaign

being challenged by a "means-ends" struggle, there is the potential for a
focus struggle: not a direct ethical challenge to their actions, but instead

I liked Derek Stanley\'s use of Canery devices.  The canery is a
small self-contained unit with enough processing power to mimic an
air/raft or ship computer.  Attach a canery to a suspected piece of
equipment and watch to see if a Virus develops...and the canery
dies.

Sure.  A substantial part of the computer tech IMTU is based on
micro-tube technology.  You get big power hungry computers...just
like CT.  <g> My rational has nothing to do with Virus, though.
It\'s the negative effects from the interaction between quantum state

Well, humans _do_ go into "heat", every 28 days or so.  However, this
obviously isn\'t the only time human females are sexually receptive.

There\'s a reason for this.  It has been an evolutionary advantage for
human females to be sexually receptive on a more-or-less continual
basis.  This is because continual sexual availability has helped keep
human males on-hand to help provide food, shelter, and protection for
the mother and child(ren).

Other sentient species may or may not follow this pattern.  It would
depend on whether evolutionary pressures made continuous female sexual
availability advantageous.  Different environments may yield different
results.  In fact, under other circumstances, the possibility of
continuous female sexual availability may not even arise as an
evolutionary possibility.  As long as the pattern of periodic female
sexual availability is adequate to the species\' survival, there may be
no need for change.

In other words, go ahead and postulate either situation for your
non-human sophonts.  YTUMV.  QED.  SOCKS ;-)

Okay, so it is a fact that under an empire the local populace doesn\'t care
who is in charge, or what they do because it has little relavance on their
lives.  Second, in TU, the Imperium controls the only means of mass
communication, and even so, it\'s not all too effectivly mass.  All true.
But try this one.  (*Warning* The sociology light is now lit.  But I
promise, it\'s worth it.) There is a difference between a pre and post
industrial empire, or perhaps a sci-fi and the ones we are accoustemed to.
See, you have all these convienent pockets of people, and good, offical
communication links between the important ones, and then ferry links
outwards to the other planets off the lines.  And on these important worlds
you have well developed media systems for the distubution of the Imperial
News, as well as all the local coverage.  Now, Joe farmer back when didn\'t
care about Joe farmer three provinces over because of their utter lack of
connection.  There would be no means of connection because neither were
litterate, and neither spoke the same language.  Janet systems analyst is
better connected to Janet systems analyst three sectors over for a coulple
reasons.  They speak something akin to the same language, and moreover
understand the connection between the two if only because they know all
about the aliens and other maco-political entities out there, and know that
we are us.  Furthermore, they know more about what an empire means, and know
that they are both, at some level, politically binded to a similar source.
Janet 1 might have a thing or two to say about Janet 2s kids being
slaughtered wholesale, if only because the same might happen to her own, but
there\'s no way she\'ll find out about it, because the Imperium will be
working damage control and just not tell Janet 1, right?
What I am proposing is the existance of the Y-Boat network, say two trader
types who came together at one point or another and discovered that the
Imperium was doing this, and they thought it wholly wrong that some Intel
guy was manipulating the truth.  And each got another trader-type
interested, and so on, and sooner or later there was a group of people
distributeing the "real facts" to people who wanted to hear them.  Sure,
it\'s slower than X-Boat, but it gets the job done as various indiviuals
trade the latest reports and pass them down the line.  And if you got some
real investigative journalist-types on it the stuff could be pretty classy.
It works because once you actually get to a world, or at least a signifigant
one, you have this massive media infrastructure for distributing it, even
better if it\'s salacious pictures of unspeakable acts.  It would be an
alternative press, and rather underground for it with not many followers
essecially, but if the reports were ever wild enough you might see some
public attention.  What form pubic action is another tale.
It\'s a theory.  Too off Cannon, or is there something else wrong with it?
What I am specifically looking for is how the Imperium would react to these
people if it existed, or if it was getting started.

>> UpPort,

>Now there\'s a new one to me, what is an UpPort?

Big commercial space station.

IMTU, many advanced worlds have a DownPort on the surface and an
UpPort in orbit (GEO is common).  The UpPort is for ships that
can\'t, or don\'t wish to, land on the surface.  Let\'s not restart the
streamlined vs unstreamlined ship debate again, okay?  <G>

The /Mae Lee/ was a little shot up, so the Navy towed her back to
Mark from the belt,trying to put her down on the surface would have
been rather risky, and they weren\'t authorized to put her into a
Work Dock.  So, they put her into an orbital slot, attached a
"collar" to her, and turned the keys (electronic keys) over to the
UpPort\'s Captain.

Orbital Slot = a "stationary orbit" relative to some point or object
         (usually the UpPort).  Slots are much less expensive than
         "Hanging on the Tree", or "Hogging a Dock" on the station
         proper.

Collar = an unmanned maneuvering pack, transponder, and running
         lights that can be attached to ships to keep them in an
         Orbital Slot.  The Collar\'s transponder is in constant
         communication with the UpPort and its thrusters keep the
         ship inside the Slot.  You need keys supplied by the
         UpPort\'s Traffic Control Office to remove the collar, thus
         making it less likely that someone will come along and run
         off with a ship, or will try to Skipboot (leave without
         paying the fees).
         
Hanging on the Tree = docking a small ship or boat to a long tree
         and branch structure attached to an UpPort.  The Tree
         allows many ships and boats to share one of the very
         expensive docking points.  Access to and from the station
         is along the inside of the tubes that make up the Tree.
         This is how most boats and ships dock to an UpPort to save
         money, but is a very inefficent way to move cargo in or out
         of the UpPort.
         
Hogging a Dock = Occupying one of the very expensive docks on the
         UpPort with a single ship.  Due to the expense, most ships
         will do this only long enough to load or unload cargo and
         passengers.  At busy UpPorts there is often a queue of
         ships waiting their turn at a dock, so a ship that remains
         on dock for an excessive time is said to be hogging the
         dock. 

Work Dock = a frame with integrated power, light, gravitic controls
        and access to various repair equipment sited near an UpPort
        and attached to a special Tree used to hold ships during
        major repairs and refits.  Ships are maneuvered into a
        frame, locked down, optionally an airtight fabric is used to
        enclose the ship, and repairs can commence often in a
        pressurized environment.  This is fairly expensive, but the
        most effective way of doing major external repairs in space.
        A cheaper, but less effective, alternative is the portable
        Work Blister that attach to a hull enclosing a portion of
        the ship allowing repairs on small sections of a ship at a
        time.

Recently I got a card reader from an old gentleman that actually had a home
computer in the 50\'s!  He said that the service tech usually had to show up
at least once a day to fix it.  Apparently he had the computer because he
was developing control systems and the company he was developing them for
was footing the bill.  I found that pretty amazing, I\'d never considered
anyone having a \'home computer\' that far back!

Several things about a computer of that vintage would prevent the Virus
from being able to do anything with it.  Remember that a computer that took
up an entire building would be less powerful than something like a
Commodore 64.  Programs were often hardwired, and you had to rewire the
computer to run another program.  Even through the early 70\'s things such
as magnetic drum memory, core memory, punch cards, paper tape, and such
were common.  Some of these are still in every day use in specialized
applications, it\'s even rumoured that Russia still has Tube based computers
in their Military, though I gather they\'re far more dependable than the
early tube systems.

On the other hand if the Virus could effect something like Core memory that
could be really nasty.  The computer could be powered off for decades with
no storage media, and assuming you could get it turned back on, it would
still be infected.  Same thing with Drum Memory.

On the other hand the speed and storage capacity of all this kind of gear
is so limited I personally don\'t see it being infected.  If a systems
memory is measured in Kb, and it\'s storage medium is punch cards/tape, or
mag tape I think the virus would find it to small.

Don\'t worry, I always say IMTU.  I don\'t suggest my version of
things is "the one true" Traveller.  In fact, my heresy isn\'t my
different rules, technology or settings, it\'s that I don\'t recognize
any "one true way" of Traveller...none.  My only rule is that the GM
is the ghod of the game.

Muhahahaha!  See, that\'s the thing, GDW went belly-up before they
told us  So, only Dave knows, if he *really* knows, and he ain\'t
telling.  <g>

We\'ve had *lots* of debates about what the Empress Wave is and what
effects it has on Zhodani space, and will have on Imperial space.

<rant> In the final analysis on this subject all ideas are heresy
because we don\'t have the High Priests to tell us what we are
supposed to believe. </rant>

Okay, here\'s what I know about the Empress Wave...

Something is causing a lot of problems in Zhodani space.  Somehow it
is connected with a psionic vision of a woman standing in front of a
burning city (see cover of TNE book).  It appears that whatever is
happening is propgating from the direction of the galactic core
through Zhodani and Vargr space at the speed of light.  It might or
might not be connected with Zhodani core expeditions.  It might or
might not be a psionic disturbance.  It might or might not have
effects in the former 3I area by the 1200\'s.  It might be a wave
followed by something after it.

The most accepted opinion appears to be that the wave does something
to human (and maybe non-human) psionic abilities.  Perhaps awakening
latent psionic abilities and strengthing the abilities of current
psions.  Perhaps, it burns psions out and leaves lots of new psions
with powers but no control. 

My opinion, strictly my opinion, is that this was to be GDW\'s "final
solution" to CT/MT, not Virus.  This would crunch *all* that
remained and then a "New Traveller" set thousands of years after the
Empress Wave where "psionic knights" wandered the starways would
have been born.

    the game\'s the thing!

I do. I do. I certainly found this one useful, as one thing I\'m really bad 
at (in SF, anywya), is this sort of background and colour.

At the moment it\'s also about as close to a Trav game as I\'m likely to 
get, too.

Much of the "historical revisonism" came with T4, when people were able
to watch the building of orgainsations that by CT were familiar entities
that had been created during the history of the Imperium.

My take is that a lot of things that were in place in M0, changed
a lot over the next 1100 years. Some things have changed so much
that they look just like they did 1100 years ago, but nothing like
400 years ago!

In the UK, we have lots of things whose history can be traced across
2,000 years yet whose "ancient traditions" are less than 100 years old.

The Grand Order of Druids at Stonehenge comes to mind. Also the
British legal system which in some respects has been going for
over a thousand years and in others only a few hundred.

It all depends on what emphasis you want to have when you write the
history.

That sounds about right. And the habitable zone for a red giant is several

Hm. An interesting hypothesis, but I can cite some counterexamples.

When George MacLure and I designed the Sydkai patrol cruiser George did the
design work on the bus to work, by hand (not even a calculator, AFAIK). Yet
that it a ruthlessly optimized design, tweaked through several dozen
iterations.

I myself use a five year old computer, yet I am (a) a specialist math
teacher, (b) an engineer, (c) a computer instructor, and (d) a gearhead. I
just spend my money on something else.

My Ottawa gaming group consisted of four engineers, a biologist, a
physicist, and an artist, yet my four year old MacPlus was the best
computer we owned between us. (In fact, for a while it was the only
computer we owned between us.)

Not to mention the Church of England.

OK. So make that "whose \'ancient traditions\' are less than 200 years old"
for the CoE. It always amazes/scares me how many churchgoers fit Archbishop
Spong\'s "naive Christian" label: firmly believing that what they learned in
Sunday School is the whole truth. All the clergy I\'ve known (except for two
fundamentalist Baptist preachers) have been able to draw a firm distinction
between faith and tradition, yet very few laypeople seem aware of the
distinction.

As an example, look at the Chaosium game "Credo" (worth buying, it\'s loads
of fun). My friends in the clergy consider it a fun card game, with
possible teaching applications, while my friends in the congregation
consider it close to blasphemy!  The difference is that the clergy already
knew the dirty parts of Christian history, while the laypeople had this
idealized picture of the church.

ObTrav: What are the differences in Imperial history as learned by nobles
and commoners?

Which begs the question "Why does a star of a given mass have a different
jump radius depending on it being a gas cloud, main sequence, red giant
or black hole?"

Of course, if you use the rate of change of gravity (1/mass^3) rule
you can end up exiting jumpspace in the outer atmosphere of some red giants.

However, that seems more reasonable than being able to jump successfully
from 300km from a black hole.

While going into jump from there might by OK, I don\'t think you\'d

	Actually, I very distinctly recall an article in the JTAS (the
original, not the IG abomination) which explicitly stated that the
IISS evolved out of the Sylean Federation\'s scout service. If it is
historical revisionism, it dates back to the days of the all-hallowed
Little Books.

	Unfortunately, then you have to deal with:

	- Saddam Hussein placing a civilian bomb shelter right above a
command & control bunker
	- Slobodan Milosevic placing AAA in schoolyards
	- The US placing the Pentagon in the midst of a dense metropolitan
area

Publicly putting restrictions on yourself only exposes you to having
those restrictions manipulated. I wouldn\'t worry about popular
support among the target population. Better the tactics espoused by
Dickson in one of his novels ... a massively-overwhelming lightning
strike that replaces the entire leadership in one swell foop.
Everything from the chief of state all the way down to the local
police precinct house.

I had a good look at this recently. ;-)

Whether the Trokh words in S&A remain canon is not mine to judge, although
words which don\'t appear in any source prior to S&A are copyright DGP and
have
not AFAIK reverted to Marc Miller. So, they are unlikely to appear in future
Traveller products.

IIRC the primary sources for Trokh are, in order of publication...
1. CT Alien Module 1.
2. Article in JTAS 20-something, don\'t have it with me right now.
3. MT Ref\'s Companion
4. MT Rebellion Sourcebook
5. DGP S&A supplement [not owned by MM, and AFAIK not officially canon
   any more].
6. GT Alien Races 2

Vacuum tubes could be make significantly smaller with advanced manufacturing
techniques. Supposedly, quite sophisticated Soviet technology relied on
miniaturized vacuum tubes computers.

Vacuum tubes on a chip, very interesting gaming concept. We could power them

Work: PII450, 19" monitor, 128mb, 7gb drive (but I didn\'t pay for it ;-) Best
thing? 10mb pipe to the internet 8-)

Home: Mac 7600/132 (for now), 16", 17" monitors, 128 mb, 5 gb drive. Only a
28.8 monitor. Luckily I have a couple of old Syquest drives, one at work, one
at home that gives me a 128 mb sneakernet. 

What I want? Been in _serious_ lust after a G4 with a 22" LCD monitor since
Apple showed them off last week ;-) And our cable company here is rumored to
be starting cable modem service soon.

The main problem I had with T4 was that it DIDN\'T allow for that effect.
Instead they just took the CT descriptions of various Year 1100 institutions
and pasted them verbatim into the Milieu Zero setting. A fledgeling TAS
might have worked fine, the carbon copy was, IMO, a total mistake.

I just sold a Near Mint copy on ebay for $13 this past week so its not that 
bad. :). There are a couple Traveller items left if anybody is interested, 
follow this link:

I have missed quite a few digests this summer and was wondering what the 
general concensus has been on the GURPS Traveller  Alien modules?

        Hi, Leonard.
        You missed my point.  One "Ethically Challenged Merchant" who makes
planetfall on a Boneyard World and fails to take proper precautions while
scavenging re-starts the whole thing all over again.
        Now, admittedly, the changes in protocols in the TNE era will help
contain the speed of re-infection, but if that ship gets to a starport where
there is a global data net...  BOOM.  <shrug>  That\'s the problem I see..
not that a "flare up" will re-trash everything that has been rebuilt, but
rather that every once in a while a flare up is going to kill a few million
people.  For generations to come.
        Ick.

        OF COURSE these posts are useful!  It is always interesting to see
how other ref\'s are handling "gargon" and "tech" issues that are so much of
the day-to-day stuff of being a Traveller.  In some cases, your posts
illuminate things I hadn\'t even *thought* of having a description for!

Couldn\'t a small "static" field be generated to keep dust away?

To be honest, the difference between a squadron of TBDs and TBFs with no
escort against the Japanese CAP is pretty moot - it\'s a bad day for the
torpedo aircraft.

B-17 = 10 crew (pilot, co-pilot, navigator, bombardier, 2x waist
gunners, tail gunner, ball turret gunner, engineer, and the one I
forget).

What this does buy you is some degree of ability to fight off attacks. A
TBD isn\'t going to fend off enemy fighters for long with it\'s paltry
defensive armament. OTOH, a Shorts Sunderland flying boat (with a
defensive armament of around 8 .303 calibre mgs) held off five Ju-88s.
Attacking a late-model B-17 with 13 .50 calibre mgs wasn\'t an easy
proposition.

The Germans were tactical victors at Jutland? Being chased from the
field; losing one battleship outright and having a modern BC flood so
badly that it couldn\'t make harbour is wining? The Grand Fleet reported
that it was at 24 hours notice for sea after Jutland. The High Seas
Fleet couldn\'t sortie for months. Your point would probably be better
made by looking at RN losses - higher than the Germans, in terms of both
ships and men. But which fleet then stayed in port until 1918 and then
mutinied rather than sortie again?

I could see the first wave of a planetary assault being very much like
the `forlorn hope\' of Napoleonic assaults on fortresses - expected
casualty rates above 80%, instant promotions for those who live.

What Nick fails to mention is that when staying up playing the game to two
in the morning in the Bar at GenCon UK, he demonstrated the amazing ability
to parry a beam blast - direct hit - catastrophic damage attack on his
flagship with another card, parrying in the style of a flourished rapier!
This after he brutally destroyed my quiet and peaceful forces...

The T-Shirt they were giving away at GCUK 99 said \'Strength 48\' was in. The

Radio Operator. He also had a canopy in his compartment (just aft
of the bomb bay, just forward of the waist compartment) that could
open, allowing him to use a single machine gun in a pintle mount [1]. This
gun was often omitted, as it proved pretty much ineffective.

I think this is the B17E, B17F and B17G (the one with the chin-mount 
turret), I believe the Radio Operator gun position was common to all
models, but some earlier models had fewer crew...I think models prior to
the B17E lacked the belly ball turret gun, for example, and some very
early models even lacked the tail-gunner seat.

Then there was the "Formation Escort" B-17...it had twin .50 machine
guns in powered gun mounts every place a gunner sat, including the
Radio Operator\'s spot. Extra armor, too - thing looked like a cartoon.
It was only used once or twice, as it was too slow to keep up with the
regular bombers once they\'d dropped their bomb loads.

ObTrav: Gotta love the variations on the standard types of starship.
_Broadsword_ mentioned how a Mercenary Cruiser could give up cutter 
module space for armor (redistributing fuel into the module hangars), for 
example. Or the Subsidized Merchant with four hardpoints instead of two.

Yes, but...

The idea here is that the pictures in question should "feel

Fleets require supplies to function, and more supplies to fight. While 
fleets generally obtain these supplies from Supply Ships, Naval Bases
and Naval Depots, the original source of these supplies will always be
the industries of inhabited planets. The supply ships, bases and depots
simply store, manage and transfer these supplies as needed.

During peacetime, supplies will be stockpiled at Naval Depots and Navy
Bases. Depots will have very large quantities and varieties of supplies,
as well as native industries dedicated to producing more supplies.
Navy Bases, on the other hand, will have more limited stockpiles, 
probably dependent on what fleets are based out of them, their strategic
position, and the ability of local industry to directly resupply them.

So, just to generalize my model for where supplies come from and
where they go:

(These ideas are presented with High Guard/TCS in mind, but the 
theory should be portable to Fifth Frontier War and Imperial Squadrons).

</begin rules variant>

Supply Points:
- ----
Each world will have a "Support Capability" for navy fleets, based on
tech level, population and government type - a variation on the Trillion
Credit Squadron rules for intial fleet builds and maintenance costs is 
intended.

This Support Capability is modified by the presence of support 
facilities, such as Depots, Bases, and Starport Rating. A negative
modifier is applied to newly captured enemy systems, this negative
modifier decreases towards zero with time. Modifiers are totalled 
into a final modifier.

This final modifier, multiplied by the Support Capability, will provide
the number of Supply Points the planet produces every year. Usually,
a fraction of these Supply Points will be available every turn - as an
optional rule, "future" supply points can be used immediately, at a
loss. (This would represent Emergency Appropriations, or even
Pillaging).

Furthermore, certain facilities - Depots and Bases - would have a 
minimum number of supply points they could generate per year.
If the calculation above provided a lower amount, the minimum would
be used. This would, of course, represent the stockpiles and included
production facilities of these bases.

These Supply Points can be used on site, or transported to another
location to be used. As an optional rule, unused Supply Points can
be stockpiled at Depots and Bases (only), perhaps with some loss.

Optional rule: a departing fleet, or certain types of attacking fleets
may be able to reduce Supply Point output, either by reducing 
the modifier (blowing up starports and bases) or by reducing
the base Support Capacity (strikes on industrial complexes,
nuking cities from orbit, other scorched-earth tactics).

Transporting Supply Points:
- ----
Depots, Bases and class A Starports can be considered to have
an inherent logistical transport capability. This can be abstracted by
allowing Supply Points to be spent at a distance from the Supply Source.
It will cost extra Supply Points to maintain ships at a distance from the
Supply Source, with the surcharge based on distance - these extra 
Supply Points are considered used up to supply the transport ships,
as well as to cover the losses, misdirections and inefficiencies in
supply at a distance compared to supply at the source.
This transport capability will not function if there are uncontested
enemy ships in the Supply Source\'s system.
Optional rule: there may be an additional transport surcharge if the
ships being maintained are in a contested system. 

Supply Squadrons (SupRons? LogRons?) can be created to move
Supply Points independently of Supply Sources\' inherent transport 
capability, or to move Supply Points more efficiently than this
inherent transport capability. Supply Points transported by a SupRon
can be used at the SupRon\'s location only.

Warships may themselves have an ability to carry Supply Points, 
especially those specifically designed for long range cruising.
These Supply Points may be spent by the carrying warship at any 
time, by the warship itself or by any ships in the same fleet/task force.
(Note: see my detailed logistics rules[1] for an idea of how many supply
points a ship can carry.)

Spending Supply Points:
- ----
Every ship must spend a number of Supply Points (depending on
it\'s class/tonnage/weapons) every week to remain fully functional. 

A ship must also spend an equal number of Supply Points for every turn
in which it attempts Damage Control rolls.

A ship must also spend an equal number of Supply Points for every ten
turns[2] (or one tenth this number per turn) it takes part in a space battle 
and uses expendable ordinance (missiles, sandcasters). 

A ship with insufficient Supply Points on board (or no Supply Points
on board) is considered to have sufficient supplies for ten turns of
combat (ready rack loads) and one turn of Damage Control rolls.
To reload and perform Damage Control, it must be provided with
Supply Points equal to its needs for one month\'s cruising.

Therefore, a ship carrying enough Supply Points for one month\'s
cruising will be able to fight for twenty turns of combat (ten with
ready-rack loads, ten with carried Supply Points).

Transferring Supply Points During Combat:
- ----
To give or receive Supply Points during combat, a ship must be in
the reserve. Note that a friendly Supply Source (Depot, Base, Starport) 
is automatically considered to be in the Reserve, and may be used as
a source of Supply Points by a defender during combat.

A ship may give or receive one tenth (rounded down) the maximum
Supply Points it can carrry per turn. It may give or receive Supply Points
to or from any number of ships in a turn as long as the total Supply
Points transferred do not exceed one tenth of this maximum.

A Supply Source (Depot, Base or Starport) may give any amount of
Supply Points, up to total Supply Points on hand, to any friendly ship
in the Reserve. No new Supply Points are considered to be created 
during the course of the battle.

Lack of Supplies:
- ----
See [1] for ideas on effects of lack of Supply Points. Of course, a ship
that uses up combat stores (missiles in ready racks, especially) cannot
use missiles or sandcasters in combat.

Fifth Frontier War Notes:
- ----
The level of abstraction will simply need to be adjusted. Each system
is considered to be able to support their own SDB squadrons, plus
provide a number of Supply Points. Some systems can give those
Supply Points at a distance (Depots, Bases, class A Starports), other
Supply Points must be transported. Determine a Supply Point cost for
each type of Squadron, have some cost more (the Imperial BC\'s with 
the Black Globes, for example) while some cost less or are exempted
(Mercenary squadrons, Scout squadrons, certain kinds of deep 
penetration raiders like the Azhanti High Lightnings). Give each side
a number of SupRons equal to their number of TankRons. Curtail
combat abilities of Squadrons based on whether they are in supply
or out of supply. Adjust Supply Point production so neither side can
support their entire navy from one or two worlds, so the "stack your
navy in one hex and stomp the enemy" plan won\'t be feasible.

Notes:
[1] See essay at http://users.hartwick.edu/smithw/fleetlogistics.htm
[2] The rule of thumb here: 1 week of cruising equals 100 minutes of
combat, at least for missile-armed ships. Laser/Fusion/Particle/Meson
armed ships should find that 1 week of cruising equals about 300 minutes
of combat, depending on damage taken. These numbers require some
serious discussion.

- ----</end rules variant/>


If this model seems appropriate, numbers need to be generated - how
many Supply Points ships need, how many each planet generates,
what effect bases have on this generation, how many Supply Points
fit in a Fleet Tender\'s 3000dtn cargo bay, etc. I\'ll use the basic
logistics rules I mentioned before, with input from Trillion Credit
Squadron\'s rules on paying for fleet maintenance.

(In best Joel (or Mike) voice): What do you think, sirs?

GURPS Lensman comes to mind -- the worldbook / sourcebook for roleplaying
in the universe of the Lensman series by E.E. "Doc" Smith. In keeping with
the fact that the stories themselves were written in the 1930s, and that
Smith himself never foresaw the transistor or the silicon chip (and I am
NOT faulting him for that), the tech in the GURPS book had machines using
vacuum tubes. These futuristic vacuum tubes were about the size of a small
indoor Christmas light, about an inch long and the thickness of a pencil
(if that). 

I\'m not sure if these tubes were used to run computers, though. But I don\'t
see why not. (How big would a room have to be using these tubes to equal 
the function of a standard desktop PC? Say, my 200MMX with 32 megs of RAM?)

 The Germans were tactical victors at Jutland? Being chased from the
 field; losing one battleship outright and having a modern BC flood so
 badly that it couldn\'t make harbour is wining? The Grand Fleet reported
 that it was at 24 hours notice for sea after Jutland. The High Seas
 Fleet couldn\'t sortie for months. Your point would probably be better
 made by looking at RN losses - higher than the Germans, in terms of both
 ships and men. But which fleet then stayed in port until 1918 and then
 mutinied rather than sortie again?
  >>

Ever heard about the difference between strategy and tactics?

As king Pyrrhus found out ( and America in Vietnam and btw Britain in Kenya 
against the Mau-Mau and Russia in Chechnya): It is possible to win battles 
and lose the war.

To get back to Traveller: The Solomani or Zhodani or Aslan may have had the 
better soldiers at the Imperium´s heyday, but that would not ever have been 
able to give them more than tactical victories due to the tech/size advantage 
of the Imperium. Only when the Imperium butchered itself were strategical 
victories possible ... until an imperial strategic project ( Virus) became 
the great equalizer.

Reminds me of an E.E. "Doc" Cummings story. it was a one-fer (Not part of
one of his well known series.) In it one of the Heroes, A brilliant
Physicist/Engineer/Jack of All Trades types is on a liner which is attacked
by pirates. (That sound familiar?) He and the girl crash their lifepod on an
airless ball of rock. The Hero commences to build a forge so that he can
smelt metals and so construct a high powered FTL communicator. Since the
story was probably written circa 1930\'s-40\'s his main electronic devices are
tubes, or more correctly cathodes, anodes, grids, etc. He doesn\'t bother
with sealing said components, just stick them out in vacuum.

Nevertheless, it saw service as a nightfighter and shot down a lot of
bombers. It doesn\'t take a great deal of agility to outmanoevre a B-17 or a
Lancaster.

I believe some Ju88s were even equipped with cannon in the dorsal fuselage
pointing directly upward so they could fly under the belly of a bomber and
deliver a devestating zero-deflection blast at short range.

(Do you think you might be thinking of the Ju87 "Stuka". The Ju87 was a
single-engined dive short-range dive bomber, the Ju88 was a medium ranged
medium bomber with two engines. I\'m pretty certain the Ju87 was never used
in an anti-aircraft role.)

I think that was rather his point. In terms of casualties, the British came
off a lot worse. However, the Germans lost their fleet as an effective
fighting unit, so suffered a strategic defeat.

There is prelim work being done several places on sub-micro (and
nano) devices where components are actually moved into different
configurations depending on function.  This would effectively allow
software to reconfigure hardware from the inside out.  Tnis isn\'t
*quite* the same as Virus etching it\'s code onto the existing
silicon, but it is similar.  Of course, Virus is still a *very*
large leap.

Which means you pass through Red Giant systems, but hardly ever have traffic
going to a world in the habitable zone.  This makes any such world a good
candidate for a *serious* backwater or unexplored world even in a fairly well
settled region.

If you knew the Short Sunderland Flying Boat, you know that a cargo
plane had enough agility to attack it. ;-)

The Ju-88 was a light-medium bomber that was adapted (due to
its ruggedness, availability and reasonable range) for a variety of
roles - maritime patrol, night fighter, pathfinder, even low-level ground
attack (with underslung cannon pods). Some were even equipped
with air-to-air rocket pods and air-to-air bombs for use against allied
mass bomber squadrons - a flight of Ju-88\'s would fly above and
ahead of a B-17 squadron dropping bombs, or fire rockets at them
from beyond the range of defensive machine guns.

Since so many flying boats operated at night, an encounter between
one and a flight of Ju-88 night fighters is pretty likely. Or a flying boat
might run into some Ju-88\'s far from the coast, outside the relatively
short ranges of British fighter planes.

If you\'re thinking of a dive bomber, are you thinking of the Ju-87 Stuka?
Even so, the memoirs of a stuka pilot (_Stuka Pilot_ was the title) tell
me that a Stuka could "out-turn everything in the air". Perhaps we should
discount that, though, because the pilot who shared that opinion with
the author (also a pilot) was last seen trying to dodge some 
russian fighter planes over Stalingrad. :)

The JU-87 was used as a dive bomber and as a cannon-armed tankbuster
(to **nasty** effect on the russian steppes, late in the war), but I\'ve never 
heard of it being used in a fighter role.

Obtrav: Again, the many roles a widely available design (or even a
well-produced hull) can fall into.

Notes: 
Fleet Carriers can maintain Sustained Operations unsupported
for 7 Days.
Nuclear Powered Ships can go for 14 days
Conventional Submarines can go 40 days, Nuclear for 60 days
as a general rule each ship will require 1 ton of supplies per 100
crewmen every 4 days.

my other source for information is the Adjutant set #7
Orbital Assault and Landing Craft.
Each soldier typically requires 45kg of consumables a day
call it 38 tons a day for a typical regiment.
Mechanized Units average 90kg per day per man
so call it 75 tons a day
an Aircraft Squadron requires 454 kg of materials per man per day
and a naval ship typically requires 35kg per day.
This suggests 100kg of supplies taking up 1 cubic meter
so it would take roughly 750 tons to supply a regiment for a month

Thats what I have found so far. suggestions etc?

No, humans are not the only species with concealed estrus. Banoboes also
have concealed estrus, and a proclivity to sex that puts humans to shame
(IIRC, ~20 copulations per day, often with as many as a different partner
each time).

Octopi and Squids often have copulation outside of estrus, but they store
the sperm, for fertilization during their fertile period.

> Are
>they just always in heat?

no. Their receptivity outside of the estrus/heat cycle is what is called
"concealed estrus"; in short, they don\'t reject copulation because they are
not in heat, and don\'t advertise when they are.

very little official, other than vargr are still terran mammals.

heat, at least in common usage locally, refers to an estrus induced period
of receptivity. Estrus is the actual fertile timeframe. I have yet to hear
the terms "heat" or "estrus"  in reference to a non-mammal, but that may
just eb lack of exposure (or over-exposure to mushers).

A modern (last 10 years or so) study found that human females do go into a
"heat" cycle... it is just concealed. During estrus, human females have a
tendancy to dress more revealingly, and most human females who do cheat on
their partners tend to cheat during estrus. (Saw this on Desmond Morris\'
"The Human Sexes")

Michel, it\'s the "eggs" that are the big problem with re-infection,
right?  The actual Virus infected devices are more obvious and
*every* will be careful with them.  It\'s the eggs left in all the
devices with too little processing power that cause a lot of the
continuing trouble.

So, how about we modify Virus just slightly and say it can\'t produce
these eggs in anything that it can\'t actually "live" in?  Bigger
computerized devices will have to be carefully handled, and if small
devices are networked to a Virus infected device it can still
control them.  However, non-networked small devices wouldn\'t
continue to be dangerous and neither would networked ones that are
disconnected from their controller. 

Would that be dangerous enough, short term, but a little more benign
long term?

Thanks and you are welcome to use any of my ideas. <g>

Microelectronics still work, but have a very short MTBF around
working CG/AG devices.  Transistors and IC\'s are used in *heavily*
shielded devices, but micro tube tech is preferred when possible.

Oh, and cultures that developed microelectronics before CG, often
*don\'t* develop gravity control.  Imagine what the effect is when a
Scout ship with CG flies over the city of a one of these
cultures...like a moving power surge. <g>

The effect I went for IMTU was that big mainframe systems on a
planet (or ship) could still do fast processing and store truly
massive amounts of data, but PC systems weren\'t much faster than
current models and were a little larger and much heavier because of
the equipment\'s bulk and need for a lot of additional shielding.
For example, cellphones exist but never get down to commdot size.

  No comparison was intended; rather, I was contrasting the two rates of
aircraft loss while bringing up the issue of what achievements the loss
rates in question had to be assessed against. It is of course absurd to
discuss "acceptable" loss rates without reference to the damage inflicted.

Though, in truth, a habitable world around a red giant would be 
exceptionally rare.  A red giant spends so little time in that stage (some 
millions of years), that a planet in the giant\'s  habitable zone would not 
have enough time to develop life and convert it\'s atmosphere.

A star with a deep 100d limit might make a useful depot/naval 
base.  Attackers are precipitated out of jump far enough out that surprise 
is near impossible, nor can you effectively blockade the system.

Modify all you want. You operate the same rules I do - GM is the boss in his

Actually it was quite agile. The nightfighter version was a 
modifecation of a heavy fighter variant. Like the Bf110 the fighter Ju88 
was too clumsy for day work where the single engined fighters cut 
them up, but for night work they were just fine. They were the main 
german nightfighter for most of the war.

Actually they were angled about 30 degrees forward. This mount was 
called \'Jazz Music\' for reasons I forget, and its big abvantage was 
that it was a lot safer and faster than coming up from behind the 
bomber, as the british bombers had no underbelly guns.

Not only that the British arrived at Jutland having planned a battle, 
whereas the Germans were out training, and yet the Germans not 
only managed to escape a confrontation they didn\'t want, but as you 
said, inflicted heavy losses on the British. However they certainly lost 
in the strategic sense.

I don\'t think it would be a problem.... the micro-tube architechtures are
supposedly hard to distinguish from 1970\'s solid state save by bulk,
voltage and spike resistance...

There was also an article somewhere about using the same process as
semiconductor building to do micro-vaccum tube work. It is being done in
the US with phosphor-tubes (Arrays of individualt Cathode Ray Tubes, each
doing only one pixel, in a wafer thin board. Build the "tubes" as open
topped pits in the appropriate media, then take it into a vaccum chamber
and seal on the phosphor/pixel plate.)

        Yes, I know, sorry if I was not clear in my example above.  That was
also my reference to a hand calculator/ Palmtop unit potentially being the
Agent of Doom...  Virus can\'t run on it, but it is networkable and can hold
the eggs to allow it to reinfect something else.  Like the  "Ethically
Challenged Merchant"\'s starship...

        That makes perfect sense to me as a limitation.  Otherwise, how did
the "eggs" get there?

        Yes.  That is a foe you can beat.  The "flare up" problem still has

Right. <g>

Right! <bg>  

Therefore, in this version, Virus doesn\'t produce eggs. It attempts
to infect everything, but only develops in complex systems.  Still
makes it deadly, because lots of TL15 comsumer products probably
have electronics complex enough for mini strain of Virus.

What it would do is make exploring boneyards a *little* less
dangerous.

I think I like it better too.  I\'m interested in having a nice open
universe to explore, Virus can give me that.  I don\'t mind there
being occasional monsters out there either, but I\'d prefer that
almost all the monsters walk on two legs and breath oxygen.  Diablo
ex Machina should be exceedingly rare. <g>

Okay!  Okay!  Thank you, everyone that posted to me, and thanks for
cheering me up too.  

I was feeling down yesterday when I posted.  One of my excellent
players had just withdrawn from the AKUS PBEM, I\'m just about
certain another who is currently AWOL won\'t be back, and to top it
all off two others are on vacation! <grrr>

If you ever need a PBEM newbie let me know! \'Course I realise that the
waitng list for  a Heretic(tm) game must be a mile long but keep me in
mind. 

I haven\'t played since we did one on a BBS (What we used before the web
for you youngsters;>) but it looks like my game may have to go that
route. Of the four players I have left 2 are moving out of state in the
next couple of weeks, and one is going back to school shortly. 

That said I\'d really like to catch up on how the PBEMs are run. It looks
like the only alternative right now.

Hmmmm...  Ever play a CRPG by the name of "Fallout," and the sequel,
"Fallout2"?  In fallout, you have to seek out the Water Purifier computer
chip.  It looks just like and PC expansion card with several vacc-tubes in
place.  Reminiscent of this thread :^)

"Fallout2" has the same technology with some cards found having the same
"expansion card + tubes" look to it.  The idea was that, after the big ones
came (and the did come!), the country --USA-- would be alive and functional.
If you haven\'t played, I\'ll say no more.

     Not necessarily.  Trade routes and shipping lines span the Imperium, and there\'s no reason a private news organization (like TNS) can\'t ship news where ever they choose aboard them.  There isn\'t a ton of canonical information about regular shipping routes in the OTU, but in researching Far Trader we found in the Traveller Adventure maps of Aramis subsector that showed that every non-Amber Zoned world in the subsector was served by a shipping line and that Naasirka maintained regular shipping to and from Aramis to Vland.  Given that Aramis is a pretty lightly inhabited subsector way out on the edge of the Imperium, I think it\'s safe to say that their is private, regularly scheduled shipping service available just about anywhere in the Imperium.

The Short Sunderland flying boat was reputed to be a rather robust machine
and heavily armed.  It was called the "Flying Porcupine" do to it\'s
capability to see off most attacking aircraft it encountered, mainly I
believe, Ju-88\'s on daytime Maritime Patrols (a common use for Ju-88\'s in

Hee! Any ideas for something less obvious?  Something that could be hidden

Well on one of the worlds in MTU the cooling fins for an antimatter reactor
were buried beneath the surface, they were quite large and operated below
red heat, but the heating of the ground produced a persistant updraft above
them hence a high pressure area.

Well, not many cargos are live animals/plants, so the quarantine is
easily "handwaved" as being handled at the destination. 

For most human diseases, the week in jump is a nice quarantine period,
as it gives enough time that many diseases will start to show. 

BTW, if you want to scare the *hell* out of your players, have a
passenger get *spectacularly* ill just after they enter jump. Say,
bleeding from all over the place (look up the symptoms of ebola Zaire).
And have the most likely diagnosis be something that goes from exposure
to death in less than 7 days. With it being a virtual certainty that
everyone on board has been exposed.

Maybe it\'s something else with similar symptoms. Maybe some of the PCs
have acquired an immunity due to something *else* they\'ve had in the
past (which, btw would be *valuable* information!). Or maybe the GM is
going to let them all die. 

Highports and isolated downports are best for quarantine purposes.
Though I\'d expect that anybody shipping live animals or plants, or
"unprocessed" animal or plant materials (stuff that could act as a
vector for diseases) will need special permits, and/or be required to
dock at a quarantine station rather than the regular port. 

A good location would be on an airless world with decent gravity,
though with CG and the like, gravity isn\'t a likely problem. Asteroids
are another good location, with seperate orbital facilities around the
mainworld being an ok, though not as good choice. Lower tech worlds may
have an isolated island, or a facility in a "wasteland" as the
quarantine facility. 

I\'d think that having the facility in a different orbit than the
mainworld would be a plus. Why? Because it\'d take yet another week for
anything to get to the mainworld from there. And it\'d mean that you\'d
have to jump in to a point where yyou *couldn\'t* "accidentally" skip
quarantine. 

Any cargo requiring quarantine is a real *pain*. Which is why they
aren\'t seen often, but can command *high* rates when they are seen. 

For passengers, and more normal cargos, the exit controls at the
extrality boundary of the port are *usually* adequate. Though sometimes
there will be a bit of a panic when a newly arrived ship bears the news
that the previous ship from its port of origin may have carried people
getting out one step ahead of a declaraction of an epidemic. 

If an epidemic/pandemic is sweeping a planet, the port will usually
seal the boundary until it can be determined if anyone in the port is
infected. Also, ships that have departed, but haven\'t jumped yet will
be called back as part of the quarantine measure. Failing to heed the
recall is illegal, but many a ship has claimed to have not heard the
recall if they were close to jump. 

Ships will be kept in orbit until either the incubation period of the
disease has passed, or everyone on board has been tested (assuming a
test exists). The highport and other space facilities will be isolated
as well. So will the downport. Though if disease breaks out anywhere,
that facility *can* contact or\\ther infected facilities. But doing so
extends the quarantine, until there have been no cases for (incubation
period + X) days in *any* of the facilities that have been in contact. 

There *are* methods for transferring food and other supplies without
breaking quarantine. But even so, due to nasty incidents in the past,
they count as "contact" for the vessel/facility *receiving* the
supplies. So they are restricted to emergencies. Basicly, you "drop
off" a load (in orbit) or use some sort of rentry kit like method (for
orbit to ground). So the senders can\'t get anything from *you*, but you
are still at risk from *them*.

BTW, this is a good use for the variation in jump duration. Have the
players\' ship leave just before quarantine is declared, and take a
longer than usual time for jump (say 8 days), and have a ship carrying
news of the quarantine make a "fast" passage (say, 6 days). So the
players\' ship arrives top a rather "warm" reception. :-)

*much* simpler. Just hit the upper atmosophere with a *lot* of the
right kind of "dirty snowball". Instant "nuclear winter". K\'kree don\'t
do so well if *all* the vegetation on the planet is dead/dying. Even
they can\'t afford to raise enough in greenhouses.

You see, herbivores, especially *grazing* ones like the K\'kree have a
*major* disadvantage. Their digestive systems *have* to have lots of
"bulk". "food concentrates" aren\'t *possible* for them. 

Omnivores and carnivores can exist for extended periods on "low bulk"
diets. We still need a certain amount of "fiber" to keep things in
order, but it\'s easily supplied. A K\'kree will suffer major digestive
disorders without *kilos* of bulk every day.

Keep in mind that *resolution* (width & height) depend on the

tend to be far more expensive. 

Anyway, these are pretty much the "standard" sizes (as taken from the

 640 x  480
 800 x  600

And colors run pretty much like this:

4	2 bit/pixel
16	4 bit/pixel (RGBI)
256	8 bit/pixel 		 (1 byte/pixel)
32k	15 bits/pixel (5R/5G/5B) (2 bytes/pixel, one wasted bit)
64k	16 bits/pixel (5R/6G/5B) (2 bytes/pixel)
16m	24 bits/pixel (8R/8G/8B) (3 bytes/pixel)

It\'s unlikely that we are going to go beyond 16 million colors, as
*nobody* can perceive the differences between many of the colors, and
the monitors can\'t reproduce them accurately enough anyway.

But when HDTV becomes relatively common, expect monitors to shift from
the current 4:3 or 5:4 aspect ratio to HDTV\'s 16:9. Some likely
resolutions:

 640 x  360
 800 x  450
 960 x  540
1024 x  576
1120 x  630
1280 x  720
1440 x  810
1600 x  900
1760 x  990
1920 x 1080
2000 x 1125
2080 x 1170
2400 x 1350
2560 x 1440
3200 x 1800

Please do 1280x1024. It\'s my "preferred" resolution. Partly because
when I get back to writing software, I\'ll have a 1kx1k graphics window,

Please note that it\'s been possible to build tubes that *never* burn
out for over 30 years. You just eliminate the filament (aka "heater"). 

Likewise, it\'s possible to build *functional* tubes smaller than a
dime. 

These and other techologies were exploited for a while in the late 50s
early 60s to build computers and other electronic units that were
immune to EMP. Look up "TIMMs" (Thermally Integrated Micro Modules?) in
a *good* reference. Basicly a large block of high temp ceramic, with
tubes, capacitors, inductors and resistors all built into the block.
You heat the block to dull red heat in a well insulated oven. It\'s not
as small as IC based gear, but it\'s at least as small as discrete
component TTL and RTL logic cards. 

> could one build vacuum-tube/mechanical relay computers
> sophisticated enough to:

Vacuum tube/transistor/IC/whatever isn\'t the question. It\'s whether or
not the hardware is capable of running anything as complex as the
virus, and whether or not it is *possible* for the virus to infect it. 

For example, unless active virus can get close enough to use its
limited "TK" on the equipment, there\'s no way Virus can "corrupt" a
*dedicated* piece of equipment. That is, somehing that is *not*
programmable, but rather hardwired to only carry out certain limited
processes. 

> 1.  Detect Virus?

Depends on what it takes to "detect" Virus.

> 2.  Provide the data-processing needed to run a high-tech society?

Data processing, buy it\'s nature is going to be somewhat vulnerable to
Virus. Basicly, if it is both *programmable*, and capable of running
"sufficiently complex" programs, then by the "official" rules, Virus
can infect it. Personally, I think a *real "virus" type entity would be
quite a bit more limited.

But a lot of searching and sorting type stuff requires *very* limited
programmability.

Again, given the characteristics that TNE gave the Virus, the *type* of
computer is irrelevant. Merely the "capacity" (in terms of complexity
and size of programs that it can handle) matters.

The "decontamination" stuff I partially described is very carefully
designed to *not* be "computers". It isn\'t programmable to any
useful-to-virus extent. Mostly it consists of the equivalent of "hard
wired" pattern recognition gear set up to identify certain types of
data.

Well, I have to confess that we haven\'t gotten a laser rifle yet. We
are using stuff like SKS rifles on them. Though we\'ve discussed trying
to build a rifle sized "rail gun".

Just keep in mind that there are no *naturally* habitable worlds in the
habitable zone of a red giants, simply because the zone only exists for
a few thousand years. What, 50k years tops? 

Prior to the red giant stage, the world would have been frozen solid in
the outer reaches of the system.

*Much* harder. But being near a ship or habitat means that you quickly
wind up with a "softer" vacuum due to leaks, outgassing, steering jets,
etc.

It would have its place. I recall a couple of 50s SF stories where ham
radio operators on Luna built tubes outdoors in a shed open to vacuum
(the shed was for protection from micrometeorites and sunlight). 

Since tubes are *still* used (and likely will be for a *long* time) for
the final amp and output stages of powerful (more than, say, 500 watt)
radio transmitters, it\'s very likely that on airless worlds and in
orbital habs, the "tubes" would be built into large chambers that can
be entered for repairs. They\'d normally be sealed after pumping out any
new contaminants from the repairman\'s space suit. And to avoid failures
due to leaks in the station of ships nearby. 

In essence, a lot of tubes might be big cylinders with a gasketed lid.
Since in space you no longer need a "roughing" pump (the pump used to
get the pressures down to a fraction of an atmosphere), you can have
just the last couple of stages of pump. Or even just us "getter" charges.

Got a problem with the tube? Disconnect the leads, attach a spare, drag
it off to a work area and open it up. Fix it, reseal it, and flush it. 

Opening it up would consist of loosening the fasteners and lifting off
the "can" leaving the grids and filament easily accessible. Once fixed,
you check the gasket, remount the "can" and hook it up to the "pump"
(to get it from .0001 atm to .0000001 atm, or less).

So you can\'t just leave them exposed, but it *is* still easier than a
lot of the alternatives.

Nope. "Static" fields are *how* tubes work. And the dust is as apt to
be attracted as repelled. Also, anyplace with people around is going to
aquire an "atmosphere" that may be really, really thin, but is still
too thick for tubes. So you\'d need to seal them. But it\'s still much
better than on Earth.

Actually, *real* super-miniaturizing tubes tend to be much *shorter*
than they are wide. Almost 2-dimensional. The smallest ones know were
about the size and shape of a dime. 

You see, you need a certain amount of space between the grids and
plates. But you don\'t need a lot of *area* unless they are handling
large amounts of power. 

So you wind up with a tube where the cathode is a dot of metal sticking
up from a ceramic substrate. The grid(s) are a series of posts around
the cathode:

            * *
          *  *  *
            * *

And the anode is a solid ring farther out. None of this needs to be
very *tall*. Thus the "dime sized" tube. No filament, you heat the
entire package.

You build layer after layer of this sort of thing, using high temp
metals like tantalum for resistors, inductors and capacitors. And you
wind up with a solid block of metal and ceramics where the only voids
are the *tiny* bits of vacuum or gas in the "tubes". 

These TIMM circuits are *incredibly* rugged. Nothing to burn out.
Lightning strikes just arc across the gaps and the circuits resume
normal operations. They *do* need to be heated to a dull red heat, but
they dissipate just about enough power to maintain that temp if in a
well insulated box. 

Figure that they pack stuff *tighter* than things such as an IBM 360.
Which means that a 360 equivalent would fit in a box about half a meter
on a side. Extra memory, i/o devices, etc will take up more space. 

These will likely be found in high temp environments like some areas of
the engineering section of a ship, and on high temp planets.

Actually, there\'s nothing at all odd about this. The X-boat netywork is
the fastest way to move news arouns. But *anything* that is "public"
knowledge on World A *will* get to World B, and do so a lot faster than
you might think, simply in the normal course of things.

Short of an active (and painfully obvious!) information suppression
campaign, this will always happen. News takes the fastest *avialable*
route. If the X-boats don\'t carry the info, people travelling between
systems on business *will*. So it\'ll get there, just a bit later, and a
bit distorted.

Real world example. In the US in the 50s, Disney aired a "Davey
Crockett" (or was it Daniel Boone?) series on TV. Kids quickly came up
with a parody of the theme song.

That song was common mong kids in *Australia* within weeks. Even though
the *program* wasn\'t shown there until *years* latter. 

How? Sociologists investigated, because it was obviously a once ion
lifetime opportunity to trace cultural spread. Turns out that *one*
kid moved to Australia when his father\'s company tranferred the father
to an office there. He spread the song to his new friends and it took
mere *days* to spread across the country from there.

The Imperium would have to do a lot of tracking just to find out that
the spread was *deliberate* rather than natural. 

Short of censoring all mail (very obvious) and taking steps to prevent
people from talking about what they\'d seen/heard on the last planet
they were on, you *can\'t* stop info from spreading. 

Heck, consider the fact that the Nazi Concentarttion camps were well
known long before they were discovered. It was just that nobody
*believed* that they could *really* be that bad. 

There\'s no *need* for a "Y-boat" network when *gossip* can spread info
just as fast, if a trifle less reliably.

Calling what passes for "sexual intercourse" among octopi and squids

Look up "computer" in a pre-WWII dictionary. A "computer" was a person
who computed things. Smith was using *normal* usage of the term. It
wasn\'t anything he invented.  

These "computers" did *not* do things in real time the way you are
thinking. Most of the time they had lots and lots of folks with adding
machines to do the "simple arithmetic" parts of the job. But they had
to do all the fun stuff like figure derivatives and integrals. 

The guy in Spacehounds of IPC, for example, was *not* doing the course
stuff in his head. He was using tables and a slide rule. Which quickly
gave high answers good to 4, maybe 5 decimal places (given that he had
a *good* slide rule).

It just *seems* like he\'s doing it in his head to folks not familiar
with the way things were done back when mechanical computers were only
good for producing some types of math tables, and electronic computers
didn\'t exist. 

He knew all the shortcuts, probably either had the relevant
integrals/differentials precalculated, or at least the constants. So he
just had to do some relatively *simple* calculations to determine the
difference bettwen the "ideal" course and the "real" course.

Ever use an *electric* calculator? (not electronic!) I have. My Big
Brother was an accountant, and when his office got rid of the old ones
to replace them with the first generation of desktop electronic
calculators (late 60s/early 70s) he got one of the old electrics cheap.

It looked like a cross between a typewriter and an adding machine. 10
rows of buttons numbered 0 to 9. You punched in numbers (up to 10
digits, obviously) on these buttons and hit a key (the equivalent of
enter). This transferered the number to a set of numbered wheels (like
in a car\'s odometer).

You then selected an operation (add, subtract, multiply or divide).
And entered the other operand. Then the machine would proceed to
perform the calculation. wheels would spin as the the operand was
applied to the other operand with the result slowy appearing on the
answer section. Which was *20* digits worth of those numbered wheels.

Addition and subtraction were straight forward. Each digit was added or
subtracted in turn, with borrows or carries being applie to tthe
appropriate digits to the left of the current place. 

Multiplication was done as multiple addition. That is, 5 times 4 would
add 5 to the result register 4 times. With big numbers, you could
*watch* as the operand decremented and the result incremented.

And division was (naturally) multiple subtraction. When working with
large numbers, you had to take care to position the divisor at the
*left* end of the number being divided into. Otherwise it would start
at the *right* end, and burn out the machine by making to perform
*thousands (or even millions) of subtractions. 

And this miracle of modern science only weighed about 50 pounds. 

Also, it\'s *not* that hard to do things like multiply 10 digit numbers
in your head It just takes *practice*. I used to do that sort of
calculation in junior high when I couldn\'t sleep (I was calculating
sizes of things for what amount to "ship designs" :-).

The hard part is retainining all the intermediate results. But our
distant ancestors had no trouble memorizing sagas that fill *volumes*.
We\'ve just gotten lazy.

Actually, that would be a Low. Rising air is found in low pressure areas
(leading to cloud formation as the air rises and subsequent precipitation).

and there\'s no reason a private news organization (like TNS) can\'t ship news
where ever they choose aboard them.  There isn\'t a ton of canonical
information about regular shipping routes in the OTU, but in researching Far
Trader we found in the Traveller Adventure maps of Aramis subsector that
showed that every non-Amber Zoned world in the subsector was served by a
shipping line and that Naasirka maintained regular shipping to and from
Aramis to Vland.  Given that Aramis is a pretty lightly inhabited subsector
way out on the edge of the Imperium, I think it\'s safe to say that their is
private, regularly scheduled shipping service available just about anywhere
in the Imperium.

You should have read the rest of the posting more carefully, for I agree
with you.  It only seems logical that there should be a way to eventually
connect anywhere from anywhere.  My question is, in reference to the
"private news orginizations" that you make refrence to, how many are they
out there that have a sector+ audience, of what caliber are they and how
strongly do they flout or suppliement the imperal line?  All that other
stuff in there was just an attempt to work my way through other means to the
point you were able to provide rather nicely.

JTAS #6 it was, so it goes way back. I don\'t really think that can

Actually they were angled about 30 degrees forward. This mount was 
called \'Jazz Music\' for reasons I forget, and its big abvantage was 
that it was a lot safer and faster than coming up from behind the

There was a popular late 1930\'s/early 1940\'s  jazz musician,  John Birks

Actually, it should be true for all stars; the life zone is at a constant radiant energy density.  That density is (constant for temperature) * (surface area of star) / (surface area of sphere at orbital radius).  If you have a 10x larger star with the same surface temperature, the life zone will be 10x further out.

According to FFS1, densities for the above are 10, 15 and 15 tonnes per
cubic metre, respectively.

I can\'t remember how many inches in a metre to more than one sig fig, so I
won\'t screw the numbers by posting a rough conversion.

I\'m not quite sure what this has to do with Traveller, but:

Home: Intel Celeron 500, 128 Mb SDRAM, 19" monitor, Win\'98 2nd
      AMD K-6 233, 128 Mb EDO RAM, no monitor, Win\'98
      Intel Pentium 133, 32 Mb RAM, 15" monitor (given to papa), Win\'95
Work: Power Macintosh G3 300, 128 Mb RAM, 20" and 15" monitor, Mac OS 8.1
      Power Computing 604e, 64 Mb RAM, 20" monitor, Mac OS 8.1

I suppose if you put them all together, you\'d get a Model 1 or 2 Traveller
computer.

I wouldn\'t trust any of them to operate equipment where lives might be at
stake, however. Applications that crash on the Mac OS tend to take down the
whole system, and now -- in a marketing and technology triumph -- the same
seems to be the case with Windows 98 2nd edition (woo hoo!). This could be
a bad thing in, say, a combat situation, a docking situation, a landing
situation, etc.

OTOH, I have very little trouble with cross-platform compatability issues
anymore, especially in the major applications that I use (QuarkXpress, the
Adobe graphics suite, and MS Office).

In a Traveller sense (and I know this has been debated endlessly before) I
would want a easy-to-use, self-programmable system that could be customized
on-the-fly by non-computer-savvy crewmembers for specific tasks. It would
be helpful if system components would be clearly labled, so that the ones
that are vital to life-support operations could be identified and avoided
(in addition to simply be hiding or locking the components in memory).

I suppose there is a Imperial Buerau of Computing Standards (IBCS)
somewhere. I also suppose that by the era of Traveller, the programming
language used by Imperial computers would be ubiquitous and virtually
failsafe, which hundred to thousands of years of testing and
error-correction to it\'s credit. Even if there are several languages, each
specialized to take care of certain tasks, any cross-platform problems
would have been ironed out long ago (at least by the era of the CT setting).

 Depend on how you count these things. The versions of TSRs supermutants 
games are as follows:

  -Metamorphosis Alpha. Book from MANY years ago. very like D&D mechanically. 
No modules ever published.
  -Gamma World 1st Ed. Cheesy box art, blue cover rulebook; also very like 
D&D. Modules include Legion of Gold and Famine At Far-Go.
  -Gamma World 2nd Ed. Red box, better layout, still like D&D. Half-dozen 
modules whose names I can\'t remember.
  -Gamma World 3rd Ed. Red box again. Mechanics based on Marvel SuperHeroes 
RPG. Little support, died quickly.
  -Gamma World 4th Ed. Perfectbound paperback. Bad class-based system. Combat 
similar to what we hear about 3rd Ed. D&D. Deadliest radiation rules yet. 
Several modules and supplements.
  -Metamorphosis Alpha to Omega. Perfectbound paperback. Metamorphosis Alpha 
revisited, using the Amazing Engine rules. No support, as Amazing Engine (and 
TSR) died very shortly thereafter.

 I\'ve heard no plans for a (counts on fingers) 7th try as yet, but TSR/WotC 
have surprised me before...

IIRC, Jim Butler has written on one of the Gamma World lists that WoC is

fifth edition.

I made some crude plans for that once but didn\'t know if I was making a gun
or a large potential atomic bomb.
I had figured a cycling chamber like a cyclotron with an alternate pathway
leading out a barrel when threshold velocity was reached, all controlled by
onboard microprocessor.  So you drop some ferric mass in a small ammo-chute
and the cyclotron accelerates it to near-c velocity and expels the mass of
highly charged \'particles\' out the barrel.

Would my idea work or blow up?  :)

I would like to photograph these miniatures and others and put them on

shoot Olympus 105 zoom 35mm camera which gave me several out of focus,
poorly framed shots. I can likely borrow a old manual Pentax 35mm

Has anybody out there done this before? It seems the new autofocus
cameras don\'t do a very good job at closeups.

        Hi, Glenn!
        While hardly a professional \'trog, I did this sometime with a
Battletech tourneyfield.  If your P&S Olympus does not have a "macro" mode,
then go and get the Pentax.  Also vital is a *tripod*...  you can get some
3" tall ones that are *ideal* for this application.
        If the camera has a "macro" mode, then switch to it and that should
fix the out of focus issue.  Otherwise, you\'ll have to play with the Pentax
and get used to its settings.  With a camera like the Pentax, you will need
to experiment with what lenses you have available to you  for what gives you
the best up-close focus.

The starships where photographed indoors under halogen lights with the

black background made it hard for the autofocus to work correctly.

[From IN Press Release 0035-072-0906, Capital/Core]
A representative of the Imperial Safety Bureau (ISB), told 
this reporter that the Emperor has expressed concern 
about the safety of those who serve on Imperial vessels. 
This prompted the ISB to announce plans to establish a 
new Imperial Standard for lifeboats. The new standard 
will apply only to Imperial vessels; however, once adopted, 
these standards will strongly influence other ship owners 
as well. The ISB representative waxed eloquent in 
discussing the requirements for a proper lifeboat design. 
However, the gist of what he said is: A lifeboat is 
something that no one ever plans to use, so, it must be 
economical (with regard to space, mass and cost). 

There was also talk of retrofitting certain classes of 
vessels with lifeboats, so the wise design will include 
retrofitting cost estimates (if retro-fitting would be 
needed) as well as costs for incorporation in new 
vessels.

	I am no expert, but I have tried to take photos of miniatures
	before.  Poor framing is a symptom of taking close-up shots
	with any camera which is not a SLR (single lens reflex), 
	because the view-finder does not see exactly what the film 
	will "see."  This makes little difference at longer distances,
	but can be significant close up.  With a SLR (I have an old
	Pentax K1000: great camera), you look through the lens and see
	just what the film will be exposed to.  As for the focus, any
	lens will have a limit to how close it can focus, and "Macro" 
	lens\' are built to focus very close.  I actually found that
	some of my best shots were slightly out of focus: it was less
	obvious that the miniature was just a miniature.

It is a great price compared to buying the lot 2nd hand. UK prices are
between £15 and £25 pounds EACH, typically.

I got all eight + realms for £115 when I bought the encylopedia...

One of our BITS demonstrators at GenCon had a nightmare encounter - an RPGA
GURPS GM ruleslawyer . The demo was GT using GURPS lite and the ruleslawyer
decided to take apart his reffing and try and use rules from the Advanced
etc sections in GURPS BASIC. Personally, I\'d have told him to shut up or go
and play his own game, but our man was much more diplomatic...

Anyway, this put me to thinking about gamers. People who play games with
established backgrounds (Traveller, Glorantha, etc) seem to worry less
about rules than the style of the game. People who play games in generic
systems (D&D to an extent, GURPS) sometimes seem to care more about the
rules. This is only natural, as in such systems the rules are the game,
whereas in Traveller etc. the setting is the game. All IMHO of course...

Don\'t stop, I find many of your posts interesting and thought provoking.
Whilst I don\'t use some of your ideas I do find many of them (and many
others posts) useful for spinning ideas off. As an example I have added your
comments about UpPorts to my players notes about Starports in general.  My
players are not Science Fiction fans generally and Traveller TNE is the only
Sci-Fi campaign any of them have ever played.

What\'s up?

If he holds all three sets of copyrights, why are only the first off-limits

FASA?

Sorry for asking, but I\'ve found no source to answer my question.

Ever try http://www.lysator.liu.se/~johol/fwmg/fwmg.html ? Very nice world

"The Server is either unavailable or too busy. Please try again later.", as

Then I suggest you keep doing what your intuition tells you..I\'m not
entirely sure, but I think running refresh rates high enough to cause image
distortion/flicker in your monitor for long periods of time may ruin it.  I
am not a monitor tech though so I do not know for sure.

   These results are IMTU with routes strictly limited to Jump-2
at most, and without the effects of neigboring sectors. Since the
mains are frequently interrupted by unpopulated worlds or deserts
without gas giants, and the best markets for a given world in
this region are most often off the main, most freighters are Jump
2.
    For an especially glaring contrast, two of Sylea\'s immediate
neighbors are Shaaak, the other high population world in the
subsector, and Kain, population about 800 and TL 4. The Sylea-
Shaaak route has a pair of 100+ kdton superfreighters; one or the
other is in port almost weekly, and there are several smaller but
still large freighters as well. Kain sees one free trader in two
months more often than two of them in one month. 
     Of the 42 worlds in the subsector, only a 17 have regularly
scheduled service at all. The remainder are places that few
starships visit because there are no facilities to speak of, and
there are no facilities to speak of because so few people ever go
there. It doesn\'t need a gas giant to create a backwater: just
having a low TL and population and being a parsec away from the main routes
can isolate you quite nicely.
     With changes in population, starport class, and tech level,
there will certainly be changes in this pattern, but these will
usually require on the order of decades to take effect.

I wasn\'t so much thinking about the artwork, other than as an indication of
the /size/ folks were viewing the Web at. And the size of their desktop. And
I thought since the texture of Traveller, even though it is paper & pencil,
is tech oriented enough I would expect most players to be technophiles. And
thus likely to buy computer stuff, and to keep it somewhat updated. Yeah,
your computer is a 5 year old model, but it is a Mac. Lower turn-over rate.
More like a pet than an appliance to some. Like the way I felt about my
dirt-bike and my older Mac. The desktop size also relates to whether one can
use "frames" in html, and still give plenty of room on the pages, even if
your menu and pages are all basic text and tables, minus any graphics. I
also would like to strip out the pics and diagrams from my pages and have
them linked with a target to a dedicated picture frame, but this takes
deskspace. So I am wondering more about desktop size than speed of CPU,
platform, OS, etc. Well, and if most folks can use frames. Otherwise, should
I have explanatory pics and diagrams popup in pre-sized windows? I hate
going to a 100x200 pixel map and back while reading a history or something.

Roger\'s ownership of the DGP material is widely known (and is largely my
own fault - I assisted in putting him in contact with Joe Fugate before I
knew him well - but who could have foreseen the results? I know I certainly
didn\'t). His ownership of the Seeker and FASA material was - last I knew -
speculative. I can confirm he was attempting to buy the rights to their
Traveller material, but don\'t know if he was ultimately successful or not.
After the DGP fiasco, I refused to assist him further when he contacted me
about the later two companies and have not heard from him since (besides
Seeker and FASA, he was also interested  in buying the Keith manuscripts,
which strongly influenced my to purchase of them to avoid their falling
into the Sanger Black-Hole).

As for the reasons for his reputation, that is based, for the most part, on
rumor, and seems to revolve around his unrealistic sense of what the DGP
material is worth in his negotiations with Marc.

Ever ready to further muddy the waters.... :)

Maybe IMSTU, now at least. OSTU? I doubt they are that creative, and it is a
rather drastic characteristic. Maybe if it is less frequent. I question
whether it makes sense for them to grow that way at all, though. the surface
is not smooth or evenly rough. They look like yelow/white shale.
BTW: Thanks for the idea!

I\'m not entirely sure what copyrights Roger actually holds, I\'ve also been told
he holds 2300AD, acquired via a different route (since it was a chadwick rather
than mwm property). So alot of this is rumor.

If he does hold FASA then there is a bunch of canon associated with that,
mainly for the Far Frontiers sector - I\'m not aware of Far Frontiers ever
having been decanonised in the same way that the JG and Paranoia Press stuff
was (for that matter I don\'t think G1\'s Theta Borealis was decanonised either
but it\'s surely not canon). Also FASA took over High Passage, which generated
much of the Old Expanses canon, and published two issues of Far Traveller,
which contained Reavers Deep data.

As for Seeker - I dunno. The Deck Plans haven\'t anything new in them, unless
we\'re concerned at maintaining the seating arrangements. The bibliography at
downport.com implies that they reprinted the Marischal folios, which include
some stuff on the Deep, but not much.

And as for the vilification, well. On one hand he is the legitimate copyright
holder and as such that has to be respected. On the other, all negotiations
between MWM (and SJG) and Roger have (reportedly, and I emphasise that word)
broken down due to his excessive demands. Nobody\'s ever actually
publicly detailed those demands to my knowledge. However given the importance
and quality of the DGP contribution to Traveller there is some degree of
bitterness about this, since the net result is that it is very difficult to
take forward the DGP material as part of published canon without triggering the
opportunity for litigation.

Plus the stuff that DGP owned cannot be reprinted, since their license has
expired, and any partworks which Roger claimed to have acquired as part of the
deal will not see the light of day.

The other thing you\'ll regularly hear is that DGP still owes alot of
contributors money, although whether these debts were inherited from the Fugate
regime or generated after the licenses changed hands is not clear to me.

Not that I know of, but the Pathfinders had Lanc\'s with the forward 
and mid-upper turrets taken off for extra speed and altitude. Given 
that these guns were effectively useless at night it\'s odd that the 
British didn\'t make this standard, as the Ju88\'s and  Bf110\'s 
(especially) were not much faster once all the radars and passive 
receivers, etc were installed.

As an experiment I ran mine up at 1280x1024 and it\'s not worth it - I 
can\'t get better than a 60Hz refresh rate at over 1024x768, and my 
video card doesn\'t have enough ram for more than 256 colours, 
anyway. I suppose that\'s what you get with 3 year old hardware.

Right now my dream machine would be just about anything with a 
nice big monitor, with a decent scanner and a good laser printer 
attached.

	- DGP work remains canon (mostly?)
	- DGP\'s license from GDW explicitly granted GDW the right to use the
ideas and concepts expressed in DGP\'s products, but not the exact
wording. All the information is fair game, but cannot be copied
verbatim.
	- Roger Sanger purchased DGP when they went under, and is apparently
quite unreasonable (demanding ludicrous amounts of money) for the
reuse of the DGP material. Note that this is just the actual material
itself, not the ideas which GDW (and hence Marc Miller) have the
right to reuse.
	- However, that right to reuse the contents apparently does NOT
allow GDW/now MWM to transfer that right to another party ... hence
all DGP material is verboten for GURPS Traveller and SJG, possibly
because of the afore-mentioned ludicrous demands for license fees.

	The disgust is because RS is perceived as sitting troll-like on a
hoard of generally high-grade Traveller material, unwilling to share
with anybody.

My experience is, if anything, the opposite.  Those who use generic systems
tend to be flexible in how they are applied while having a rules set folded
in give the impression they need to be applied _exactly_ as written.

[Note, I most certainly don\'t consider D&D to be a generic system]

 A fair amount of the rancor comes from (mostly forgotten) claims made by Mr. 
Sanger around the time of his acquisition of DGP that:

 -he would be reviving the material "any time now," 
 -he planned to sweep Traveller aside with something of his own,
 -he planned to complete and release A.I. (the non-Trav project DGP was 
planning when it went under),

 and several other sweeping announcements promising great things, none of 
which ever materialized. A couple of these happened early enough that his 
announcing acquisition of DGP was an immediate cause for dread on the TML, 
never mind his later dealings...

 The sad truth is that the DGP material gets less valuable the longer he sits 
on it...

 As for FASAs stuff, I know that Far Frontiers was written by a group of 
people scattered across time and space. Several subsectors appeared in FASA 
adventures, but the rimward half of the sector appeared in article form in 
Ares magazine, written by Dale Kemper. This was later reprinted in The 
Traveller Chronicle (#2 and later). Then I did the rest of the sector (the 
coreward half) for The Traveller Chronicle. Not my best work, but it\'ll do.
 The upshot is that the lockout of FASA material would not harm Far Frontiers 
particularly. Old Expanses and Reaver\'s Deep material was backed up by 
subsequent references and partial reprints in various places, and frankly 
amounts to little enough material stuffed into (by GDW,  MWM and SJG 
standards) remote corners of the universe that being de-canonized isn\'t an 
issue.
 Loosing the once-official write-ups of Deneb, Reft, and Trojan Reach (all 
DGP material) is a much greater blow, since these border on the all-important 
Spinward Marches and are therefor more likely to be overwritten by subsequent 
works. Their starmaps will stand, since they were printed in a GDW product 
(Atlas of the Imperium). Everything else is subject to change...

Great! As a GURPS Traveller heretic I always figured GURPS Ultratech Virtual
Reality systems were among the forbidden technologies. Nice to see I can add
it to my list of "not quite authorized non-cannon".

OTOH, if you put them all together, but have them run in parallel (IIRC,
the Space Shuttle has several computers, running in parallel), the ones
that don\'t crash can pick up the slack for the one that does, until you
can reboot.

Besides, I already established a few months ago (I don\'t have the
original post, since it was from my old, moribund machine) that one CPU
slot on a Traveller computer was equal to at least 250 Pentacle-IIs
running at (IIRC) 333 MHz (based on required volume for "slim-line" PCs,
compared to the volume of CT computers).  (That was during the brief,
humorous side-discussion about using PDF as an acronym for Point Defense
Fire, leading to comments that one should run Adobe Acrobat to shoot
down missiles.)  >;-)

Given the convoluted history of publishing rules for the GW setting,
shouldn\'t that be the "Nth edition", as in the Nth Interstellar War(s)?

So, I\'m going to try and tie this back to where it all started.  As I seem
to recal it was over the issue casulaties in the Rim War and how much
spin/propoganda the Imperium could put, in specific or general, over a
topic.  The prevailing answer seems to be that they couldn\'t, or rather that
there is enough of a non-offical media/gossip circut going around that they
couldn\'t engage in mass deception, unless it was a "too fantastic to be
belived" scenario, as opposed to the distance school of uncaring.
Unfortunatly at this point the conversation slid into real world examples,
and I can\'t pull anything back together again.  No matter, no mind.  I think
that the point was that the Imperium is also bound by popular perception and
opinion, at least as much as a massive star-empire can be.

Personally, I\'d be with you.  My strongest sympathies out to the guy who had

exposure reading (for setting shutter speed),
remove the lens from the mount and hold it 
in place backwards against the camera

f-stop (with the button on the rim).  With
strong lighting this gives you some leeway
with focus.  With a litle practice you can
move in quite close and get some
pleasing results.

  FWIW, 2300 AD fandom reviles him as a vapourware merchant; reasonable
or no (he does own the rights after all), it irks many that a damned good

If we can get enough people involved, as contrasted with lurking,
this is a good idea, and one that I wholeheartedly endorse.

Without necessarily suggesting a specific direction to go in, I
will note that we probably have the most flexibility with respect
to the Vargr.

Well I\'ve being doing some work recently on the Aslan language, mainly
because I am detailing the Banners sector which had two Aslan states within
it which were apparently not imperial client states - or had not been since
the Solomani Confederation arose, and not Hierate clients either.

Actually, that would be a Low. Rising air is found in low pressure areas
(leading to cloud formation as the air rises and subsequent precipitation).

Thankyou for that, I knew it had to be one or the other.

But the stars *don\'t* have the same surface temperature.

Indeed, the OBAFGKM scale is a scale of decreasing surface temperature.

I remember the old Daniel Boone television series (with Fess Parker

of the theme song. Or at least, *a* parody of the theme song. In fact,
the parody lyrics are the only ones I know.

I\'m not sure I would agree. Attracting such undesirables as rules lawyers is
simply a factor of how popular the game is. They\'re a type of roleplayer and
they *thrive* off of being able to lord their "vast knowledge" of a game
over other players and GMs. There\'s a much greater chance that they will be
attracted, like like flies to... um... you know, to the more popular
systems.

If Traveller had a fanbase the size of GURPS or AD&D, I\'m sure there\'d be
rules lawyers among us. Just IMHO... ;)

My take is that individual mercs tend to come unequipped.
Possibly just personal gear and a sidearm.

It\'s so much easier for them to move around the Imperium like this.

If you want support weapons or a tank, you\'d have to hire
a merc company. These either have their own transport or contacts with
traders who don\'t mind them coming on board with enough weaponry to
attack a planet.

Of course, the patron could supply their own equipment, but to quote
Chris[1] "men are cheaper than guns".

They can both be right. The original IISS could have been formed from the
Sylean service and was reformed or replaced by a new IISS after the civil
war. In fact, it is possible that many imperial agencies were reformed
several times during the 3I\'s history.

Most likely the original Sylean scout service, and the early IISS, were
completely different from the service in the later Imperium. The Sylean
Federation never dealt with more than about 20 of its nearby neighbors.
There have also been complaints about the poor quality of astrographic data
in Milieu 0. How could this happen in an empire that had interstellar
travel for over 600 years?

IMTU the Sylean Federation was extremely isolationist, and the scout
service mostly administrative. The Sylean scouts collect astrographic data
from historical records and cross-check it against stationary sensor
arrays, naval intelligence, and sensor logs from traders and explorers.
They do not actually explore space themselves. Exploration and adventuring
is done by military intelligence, non-profit societies, academic
researchers, corporate expeditions, far traders, and unsanctioned treasure
hunters. When Cleon I formed the early IISS he recruited a lot of the
corporate and private explorers, which explains its distinctly non-military
command structure.

I think the most effective way to run a merc outfit would be as close to a
regular military unit as possible.  This means the merc company pays for all
the equipment and gives the troops their share of the left-over money.

1) This prevents incentive incompatibilities between doing what is in the
unit\'s best interest and in doing what is in an individual trooper\'s financial
best interest.  For instance, if you\'re pinned down and need help, you don\'t
want the artillery boys skimping on fire support because they\'re trying to save
money on ammo.

2) If everyone has their own gear, logistics become more difficult because
nothing is the same and you have to bring many types of spares, ammo, etc.

3) I\'d think it would be bad for unit discipline and planning if individual
troops decided what sort of equipment to buy and then the commanding officers
had to figure out how to fight with the resulting hodge-podge.

IMTU, only merc *units* can afford the heavy ticket items like MRLs and such. 
 Usually, \'new recruits\' generated under Mercenary or the core rules (CT of 
course) tend to show up with a duffel full of fatigues with the unit patches 
& rank insignias removed, and personal weapons.  And the Imperium (and most 
interstellar governments, with a few exceptions) only allow them to use 
\'civilianised\' versions of these weapons.  I.e., yeah, a beginning character 
*can* get an ACR as part of their initial gearload, but before anybody lets 
it out of their weapon inventory, it\'s been converted to semiauto, and the 
really advanced electronic battlesight has been removed.  They can be 
converted back, if you have the money, and the right contacts, but then 
moving them across interstellar borders gets hairier.  You\'d need the various 
End User permits, your Imperial Mercenary License, ad nauseum.  Of course, 
the merc unit you\'re with would cover those issues with their own 
paperwork,,,  <grin>

But first and early second ed (A)D&D provides a pretty okay generic fantasy
RPG. It\'s not, for example, like RQ/Elric where the rules are flavoured to
emphasis a setting. Admittedly the magic is Vancian.

NEWS ANNOUNCEMENT
Dateline: Sunday 5th September 1999, Loughborough University, UK.

Before starting this announcement, I should point out that this is
based on a public announcement at UK GC 99 by John Brown, the Chairman
of RPGA(UK), conversations with members of the steering committee of
RPGA UK, and a brief private conversation with Peter Atkinson, the CEO
of WotC, all of whom were at UK GC 99. My opinions are my own, and
provided that I am informed by personal (private) e-mail to
(roger@isgwds.enterprise-plc.com), corrections will be made, if I am
at fault.

RPGA(UK) HANDED OVER TO DCI COLLECTIBLE CARD GAMES ORGANISATION.

It appears that the Role Playing Games Association (UK) (RPGA UK) has
been handed over to the DCI organisation.

Background: Wizards of the Coast (WotC) bought TSR when they went
belly up. In doing so, they bought the rights to the RPGA
organisation, world-wide, including all membership lists, and
membership database entries belonging to the RPGA(UK).

RPGA(UK) had been in decline for a few years prior to this, and WotC
put one of their own employees (John Brown) in the chairman spot, in
order to bring RPGA(UK) back as a credible organisation for the UK
Role Playing scene to rally around, which it did, by organising the UK
Gen Con events. At the same time, the internal organisation of WotC
created/extended it\'s marketing "Organised Gaming" sub-division into
two sub-trees, one for RPGA(UK) and one for their mainly CCG
(Collectable Card games) section, called DCI (don\'t ask, I don\'t know
what it stands for). DCI is WotC\'s own creation, as I understand this.

DCI is obviously aimed at supporting the core actions of WotC -
selling M:tg CCG packs and games. RPGA is aimed at the RPG hobby as a
whole, but with emphasis on selling TSR line products. It\'s all a
marketing exercise, when you come down to it, but one which aids (or
did until Sunday) all of us.

Sunday, immediately following the UK Gen Con 1999 prize-giving
ceremony, John Brown, RPGA(UK) Chairman, announced that the entire
RPGA(UK) committee, including himself, were stepping down from their
posts, as the RPGA(UK) had been handed in its entirety to DCI, in an
internal WotC restructuring operation. Paraphrased, Mr Brown explained
was bad news for us as RP Gamers, as the man in charge from now on was
exclusively a CCG player, and had little or no interest in RP gaming.

The effect on the audience was immediate, and visible: From a
mirth-filled crowd enjoying the last few hours of the premiere Games
Convention in the UK, the mood changed to that of a wake following a
funeral.

After this, I managed to grab a few minutes of Peter Atkinson\'s time
(He\'s CEO of WotC in the US, and runs the entire organisation). He was
rather surprised at this announcement, and had no knowledge of what
had been in the offing, stating that "Something\'s gotten f***ed up",
and that he was really "pissed" about the entire situation.

I am NOT condemning WotC\'s position at all. They are in business to
make money, and have, after all, the right to run their show in the
way they see fit. I would mention to them in passing that in my view
it\'s impossible to make a UK Convention make a profit - you mighyt
just break even, but it\'s more a marketting exercise, it helps sell
your wares, and gives a good PR spin for your company.

I AM, however, calling into question the sense in placing a
Collectible Card Game player, with apparently no interest in RP games,
in charge of a primarily Role-Playing Organisation such as RPGA(UK).

This action by WotC can only harm our hobby, in my view.

It may even sound the death-knell to Cen Con in the UK.

Hi All.

This is a heads up on the current status of the RPGA UK as it was left
at 12:00PM today 6th September 1999

The Steering committee and most of the Regional Directors have
resigned. Discussions have taken place with
Peter Adkinson (CEO of Wizards of the Coast Inc.)

The results of these discussions now have to be debated and a decision
made which will hopefully happen in a meeting of the
RPGA UK Steering Committee (as was) which is currently pencilled in
for Sunday 19th September.

Until then the RPGA UK is in a dormant state but we hope that cool heads
will prevail and some people make the right decisions for the benefit of
all Gamers everywhere.

My best wishes go to all of you.

Karim C Kronfli

Please remove NOSPAM from E-mail address. You know what to do!

Firstly we would both like to thank you for your support in this matter.

As Regional Directors (now ex-Regional Directors) of the RPGA, we thought
some background may be in order.

The various RDs up and down the country have worked hard in the last year or
so to make things a lot better.  I hope that those people who did attend Gen
Con this year had a good time and noticed this.

Things have taken a turn for the worse.  The RPGA UK as it stands is still
in existence but at the moment what form it will take is in debate by WotC.
Their original idea was to internally move control of the RPGA UK to DCI
under the control of Carl Crook.  This is what has sparked the current
moves.  John Brown, the Steering Committee and most of  the Regional
Directors did not feel they would be able to provide an Organisation to the
members that would give no where near the same standard they are currently
receiving let alone their continuing efforts to make it even better under
the constraints placed on them from Carl Crook who has already made it clear
that his loyalty is with M:TG and nothing else and especially not RPG.

From our own experience Carl Crook has actively discouraged any
demo/tournament play in anything but M:TG organised by himself.  An example
of this would be a message he left on our answer machine  following a
request made for a sanctioned tournament at UK Games Fest 99 in Battletech
and Netrunner (both produced by WotC).  The message went along the lines
that they were \'crap, no one played them and weren\'t worth bothering with\'.
Remember this is his attitude to games produced by the Company he works for.
What has to be thought about is what his attitude would be to RPG (which he
doesn\'t like) produced by WotC and then those not even produced by them.
The RPGA UK has always supported any game system by any publisher be they
large or small.

One of the strong points of the RPGA UK is their own fanzine Polyhedron.
This is produced for gamers by gamers in the UK (and South Africa).  Anyone
who will have seen it in its current form would, I hope, agree that it looks
and is fantastic containing articles on varied RPG (both live and tabletop)
not just WotC products.  Under the restructuring, the editorial control of
Polyhedron would fall to DCI with approximately 75% of the work being done
\'in house\' which would ultimately lead to a drastic decline in the amount of
articles on RPG.  Earlier in Gen Con it was disclosed that plans were
already in place for Dragon, Dungeon and Duellist magazines to cease being
in paper format and only be available to anyone with web access.  Now more
than ever gamers need a magazine to act as a forum for the hobby.

There is one very important legal point to be considered.  All members
details are currently held on a database which is regulated by the Data
Protection Act.  A lot of work has been put in by Ratty and others to create
this accurate database which falls within the remit of the DPA.  According
to the Act no members\' details can be passed on without that members\'
consent and also cannot be sent to another Country if that Country does not
have adequate laws to cover such data - As at 1 January 1999 America has
been deemed to be an insecure Country.  On several occasions WotC (America)
have attempted to obtain the database (both directly and indirectly via a
\'backdoor\').

Under the new leadership of the RPGA, the Steering Committee did not feel
that any guarantee could be given that the data would not be handed over.
We would suggest that members contact WotC as soon as possible and confirm
in writing that under no circumstances should their details be handed or
sold to a third party.  If this does happen we suggest you seek legal
advice.

Regarding the resignation of John Brown

You must understand that John has fought tooth and nail to get the RPGA what
is currently has.  RPGA America have been actively against what he has been
trying to do in providing gamers this side of the Atlantic with information
and a magazine which is more in tune with our needs, for example Gen Con UK
99 did not even get a mention/advert in Dragon magazine.

John did not make this decision lightly and it is with deep regret that it
had to come to this.  John has always had the European gamers interests in
the forefront of his mind.  The decisions made are regrettable but were
necessary to prove to Peter Atkinson that enough is enough and we were not
prepared to be treated this way or allow this to happen to the members.

On a more positive note, all is not lost.  There are various options open at
the present time which are being considered.  All that is asked is that
members and gamers keep in touch with their previous Regional Directors and
visit the web site regularly (which cannot be touched by WotC) for updates.

http://rpga.ukonline.co.uk/index.html

Updates will also be posted on the UK Games Fest web site.

My one addition to the Roger S. gristmill. I purchased from him a large

Roger led me to believe that I was getting a lot more than I got...I paid him 
for what I thought I was getting...and finally gave up the fight (due to lack 
of energy--I was taking courses and working full time) over it all.

From then, I\'ve also cursed the holder to the copyright of all that good 
stuff. Given my experience, I\'d agree with the theories about him asking too 
much from Marc M. and Co. on using the material. 

So what do we have as a result? All that stuff in sitting in his garage (or 
wherever), essentially rotting away. It can\'t be officially used. It\'s losing 
him money (cost xxxx to begin with...revenues since then...0...equals a loss 
in my book!). He\'s rapidly losing ground as SJG keeps inventing new canon to 
work around the old canon...

Of course, you and I (those that have copies) can use it. It would be nice if 
there was some way of getting it into the hands of the rest of the fans as 
well!

That always works.  <grin>  What worked for one of my old groups was, after 
everybody got tired of this one dood was, everybody jumped him at the 
beginning of the session and flat out told him they *refused* to game with 
him anymore.  After about 2 minutes of screaming at the top of his lungs at 
us, he finally stomped out in a rampage when everybody else ignored him to 
death.  His character was written out of the group\'s history, and the one or 
2 *right* things he did were later attributed to somebody else.  <grin>

Here\'s a clarification.  One member is a competetive pain in

Seems to me the guy is fired.  In that case there should be a world of
experience out there.

If you don\'t want to work with the guy then say "we don\'t want to work with
you."  If you are concerned that this might hurt his feelings then don\'t get
rid of him.

	Only if everyone has different kinds of gear.  It would be

	sell them to the mercs (possibly at a discount).

	See above.  I could see some merc units run by pencil-
	pushers insisting on the mercs buying their own stuff,
	but I\'m beginning to see that the better units would 
	provide all necessary equipment (only charging mercs
	who, say, get drunk and trash the unit\'s air raft).

Urk. IME this kind of player has to be told point-blank "We don\'t want
to play with you anymore. It\'s not fun, and everyone feels this way."
and _everyone_ has to say that. Sort of an intervention, though more of
an _out_ervention

Unfortunately this leads to other problems if you have to deal with the
person IRL, because if they\'re that immature at game playing, they\'re
usually as immature IRL.

DGP still owes me money. I had a deal with Joe that I would accept payment
in product (as I was buying everything anyway). When AI was delayed I
decided that I trusted Joe enough to wait - and I still think that Joe
would have paid me in the end.

Roger was willing to deal, as long as that involved me writing more
material for DGP (once he bought it). When I mentioned the earlier amounts
owing he stopped answering my letters.

Seeing as I was never paid, however, I figure that the only material of
mine that DGP now owns is the bit of Starship Operators manual they paid
for. The Sydkai, and all those equipment sheets (such as grashfalt - I
think I coined the term) are mine again.

I suspect that the same situation may apply with other parts of Travellers
Digest and MegaTraveller Journal, too.

Seeker and FASA have been non-canonical for a while; the quality
of both was IMO significantly inferior to what DGP put out, and
there is little if any present interest in it.  The DGP material
- - the absolute best non-GDW stuff from the GDW era - is not
available, essentially because R***r S****r <spit> won\'t
re-release it (and if he said he was going to, nobody would
believe him; he\'s failed to follow through on similar projects
before), and the implication of statements made here was that he
expected anyone that wanted to take on the job of re-releasing it
to make him independently wealthy for the privilege.  Thus, the
DGP material sits unused, and unusable (_I_ wouldn\'t want to get
into a copyright micturition competition over it), doing _nobody_
any good.

The Ju-88 was also used as a night fighter, and as a long-range fighter
(hence the meeting between them and a flying boat - IIRC the encounter
was well out of range for a Bf109).

Jutland - tactical victory for the RN - the enemy fleet fled the area,
returning to a friendly port.

Jutland -strategic victory for the RN - the enemy fleet was no longer
disposed for further combat operations.

Ever hear about the difference between tactics and logistics?

Probably because the delta in capability between the units wasn\'t great
enough to offset the delta in numbers. To link this to an earlier
thread, see NATO, Warsaw Pact, and first use of tactical nuclear
weapons.

But it would mean if you forced rain here it might cause other places

What, you don\'t think they *are* amongst us?

Nooo!

Better! <g>

There are ruleslawyers lurking around for every game system.  In my
experience they *do* seem to be more common in some systems...AD&D,
Champions, and GURPS come to mind, but that could just be my personal
experience.  

<joke> I have more trouble with the Traveller
settinglawyers..canonists...that rules lawyers. </joke>

Scientists Make Molecular Motor

By BBC News Online Science Editor Dr David Whitehouse

It has just 78 atoms, took four years to build and it has a
spindle that takes hours to rotate but it could be the
forerunner of a revolution. 

Attempts by scientists to produce molecule-sized
machines have produced a toolbox of parts, gears,
rotors, switches, turnstiles but no one has produced a
molecular motor, until now.

<snip>

The diminutive motor consists of 78 atoms arranged in
two molecules, a three sided spindle composed of
star-shaped molecules and a base plate molecule on
which it rests.

I would expect this to be a direct result of the quality of the merc.
Soldier of fortune types will almost certainly provide their own equipment.
I would expect that they would be employed as bodyguards, thieves or
enforcers.
An organized mercenary force will almost always supply their contract
soldiers with equipment. This is absolutely necessary for reasons of
logistics.  The larger the force the more necessary this is. Officers will
probably have more leeway as to side arms. Personal gear, like knives and
survival gear might be supplied, or might be up to the individual to
procure.

The best way is to upfront and honest.  Explain cleary why you and the
group now longer wish to play with this person.  Be firm.  Odds are, he\'ll
claim that he\'ll change.  Trust me, he won\'t.

I\'ve had to deal with a couple of players who just didn\'t get the campaign

For MTU, there are a general set of assumptions that I run with to try and
deal with it.  First, most merc groups are either attached or incorporated
with merchant groups, partially to have a potentially loyal force for the
merchants, as well as an "investment" to turn some money on the side.  They
provide most of the fiscal support for the mercs, in terms of having an
expert group of people to  run the numbers for the people who know how to
kill things.  All the other mercs are doomed by this to be somewhat small
time.  Which doesn\'t mean there isn\'t anything for them to do, alone try and
get hired by one of the corps.  Second, while it can be overestimated, there
is also the aspect of pilliaging or scrounging rights after a successful
battle.  It is possible to end up with a piece of equ. far better than you
ever anticipated, as long as you have sharp eyes and a good tech.  You can\'t
take this too far, but there is some validity in it, especally for a plot
thread (go easy on the grav tank everybody, I want it)

Never an enviable position.  Just as a question, why?  The main reason that
I have had to is because of "inter-player" conflict, which had the bad
tendancy to boil over.  (can you say, plasma rifle in enclosed air raft?)
One other time it was a matter of someone who turned unreliable after he
started dating someone who didn\'t understand the life (ironically enough his
last SO had been the one that the above quote refered to).  What I try to do
is give them a graceful out.  Wait \'till there\'s a hiatus in storyline
coming up, break \'em the news that the group can\'t take what they\'re doing,
and then try to devise a meaningful sort of good-by for them to engage in,
something which fits with their character and the plot.  It\'s a best of all
possible worlds scenario, but it\'s worked for me in the past and managed to
kick people out of my group without too much hard feelings.  On the other
hand, you could do this without telling them, but that\'d be mean.  But
sometimes necessary.  Alot of it, IMHO, really depends on why you want them
out and what your out-of-game relationship is: there\'s stuff that requires
immedate action, and there\'s stuff that you can take the "pretend we quit"
routine.

They used setting assumptions, that mages wouldn\'t wear armor, that
Clerics wouldn\'t use edge weapons, the only theives stable people in
the back, etc. to balance the rules.  You basically had redo the combat
numbers from the to-hit tables on up if you wanted to play a character type
from a new  type of setting, etc.  The only think "generic" is that it
didn\'t come with a game world, but many of the world assumptions were
all there and not optional.  Not, in my book, even close to even "generic
fantasy".

I\'ve a problem with the Rim War - the Imperium is bigger, but has an
average TL lower than the Solomani (unless someone has crunched the
information down and proved otherwise). The Confederation is pretty uniform
in TL and has a lot of TL14 worlds. Although smaller, surely this gives
them an advantage longer term?

I see your point... but that was back in the old days when gamers spent all
night up crafting their system to fit the background that their furtive
imaginations had spawned (or stolen from Tolkien/Howard/Moorcock etc). Back
in the days when we had paper chits from the back of the D&D box set to use
as D20s (*) and were proud of the fact ;-)

        Hi, Doug!
        I agree.  I also suggest that you inform the *other* players first,
and make sure they are willing to say the same thing.  That way you can
honestly tell him it is a group decision and *everyone* is in agreement with
your reasons for canning him.

I\'ve been thinking \'bout something portable, how do you like your Palm V? Is
there plenty of Traveller software for it? It comes with a basic data base
and word processor, doesn\'t it? Although those new iBooks sound pretty nice
too. A Powerbook is tempting, but expensive, and probably way overkill. I
just need to take notes, sketch diagrams, etc.

As far as the thread is concerned, I think all you folks are set up just
fine. I am relieved, after seeing the primative POS\'s some acquaintances

Having been on the receiving end of the boot once, (I was increadibly
obnoxious in my teen years.) I would say the honest approach is the way to
go. Something like, "Look I\'m sorry you\'re just not fitting in..." or

I\'ve only ejected a couple players, and it is a tough job. Nobody likes
being the bad guy, so I advise you do as another poster mentioned: Share the
responsibilty with your other players. And be blunt, or the player may play
the "pity me" game, and that makes it harder. The only other idea I can
think of would be to play a series of games where all the players (in
collaberation) relentlessly pick on the offending player until the
individual quits of his own accord. If he has been annoying enough, you may
enjoy yourself. ;)

    I have always run it that the unit pays for your equipment, otherwise
you would have a resupply nightmare, as on merc may have a 5.56mm Assault
Rifle, one has a 7mm, one has a 7.62mm, one has a 7.65, one has a 9mm, & one
has a 10mm.  If the unit uses a standard weapon like the 5.56 or 7.62mm
Assault Rifle, then logistics is simplified.
    And, as a Merc Unit is a freelance military unit, they tend to want to
look military for prospective employers.  And, you cannot look military if
everyone has different equipment, nor can you plan for a long campaign, or
let alone a long battle.

OTOH, according to Keegan [_The Price of Admiralty_, page 136], Admiral
Scheer\'s objective was to inflict losses on the Grand Fleet.  He
succeeded in sinking more enemy "Dreadnought-type" capital ships
(INVINCIBLE, INDEFATIGABLE, and QUEEN MARY) than he lost (LUTZOW).  In
other words, the High Seas Fleet\'s mission was to sortie, kill enemy
capital ships, and return home.  Which they did.  It was in that sense
(plus, of course, the fact that Germany lost far fewer sailors than did
Britain) that I referred to Jutland as a German tactical victory.

No argument here.

Your other points were well made, and you\'re right that my original
point would have been clearer had I phrased as you did.

Anyway, it could be worse; I could be arguing that the Spanish sould and
should retake Gibraltar!  (For the uninitiated:  This discussion went on
for quite some time, generating much more heat than light, on
sci.military.naval.)

ObTrav:  Over a century after the end of the Solomani Rim War, I expect
that military theorists still debate, with much vigor, the wisdom of
invading Terra.

There was a reorganisation of the regular fleets following the 5th Frontier
War, so the location of a fleet in 1116 does not say much about where it
was in 1107.

>Sub-Sector: G: Lanth

>Reserve Fleet: 1018th

Because the regular fleets gets shuffled around once in a while while the
subsector fleets stays put, it is quite unlikely that any subsector fleet
should have a number that corresponds to the regular fleet stationed in its
subsector. It\'s not impossible, of course, just quite a coincidence. What
evidence do you have that the Lanth subsector fleet is #1018?

Propably because the 18th was stationed somewhere else at the time.

Well, I\'m not gonna get into a p***ing contest here, but I have a lot of the 
old FASA stuff (the FCI Consumer\'s Guide, all 3 parts of the Sky Raiders 
Trilogy, the Uryagen of the 7 Pillars, and Rescue on Galatea), and I consider 
them to be among the *BEST* CT supplements around.  But then, YMMV.

One of our \'Lost Geese\' stuck his head up, so things are looking up a bit.

OTOT, things have been kinda screwed up for me here lately.  Damned back\'s been acting up a LOT lately.  I can spend only maybe 10 minutes at a time every couple hours at the computer before I almost pass out from the pain.  This is *not good*.

IIRC individual Royal Navy vessels during the 18th-19th Cent. would "sell"
captured enemy ships and split the prize money among the officers and crew.
The amount of each "share" depended on rank and position within the crew
with the Captain receiving the largest amount.  For the time, even a lowly
apprentice seaman could do well with his share of several captured ships.
Is this the kind of thing you had in mind?

ObTrav:  Would the officer\'s and crews of Patrol Cruisers and SDB\'s get
"prize money" for captured pirate vessels?

Oh, heck, no. "Wanker" isn\'t an ethnic-based term -- at least, not
in this part of the world. But I\'m curious, if "wanker" appears in
the version you know, then it\'s a completely different version than
the one I know...

And there was also a Davy Crockett series, which may also have had
some parody lyrics associated with it...

Which brings to mind the idea of Traveller filk songs... like Home
On LaGrange... :)

I have to concur with Doug.  Better to be honest with them, 
especially when you have to deal face to face with them on a daily 
basis.

The irony of it is if you search the person out, a lot of times you will 
discover they weren\'t having that much fun anyways.  At least, 
that\'s been the case the couple of times I\'ve had to deal with it.

I\'ve had the misfortune to have both played and GMed in this sort of 
environment several times. One game broke up because the GM 
couldn\'t (for out of game reasons) do anything about it. In another I 
solved the problem by ending the campaign early and strating 
another with a system that he didn\'t like, but everyone else did (or at 
least said they did). This encouraged him to go elsewhere.

Yep. I an AD&D game I was in we had a player who had a Mage-
Thief who used to just lurk at the back, saving all his spells \'just in 
case\' and shooting into melee, etc. The whole group wanted to get 
rid of him, even those who were his friends, but the GM wouldn\'t do it 
himself, or let us do anything because he was in business with the 
guy and he was (justifably) afraid of the repercussions.

I\'ve had to lie once or twice to someone who wanted to invite himself
into a game I was starting, someone I definitely did not want to have
present, by telling him that I had no room for any other players...
This same person, several years ago I got to leave a superhero RPG
game I was running by putting it on hiatus for several weeks -- then,
when restarting, switching rule systems to a system that he absolutely
despised, so he would exclude himself. It worked.

There was another time where we wound up with one of the worst types of
Munchkin players in the group, who we all got to despise. He didn\'t take
the hint that he wasn\'t liked by the others, so the GM told him point 
blank that he was no longer welcome. The following week, he showed up for
the game anyway.

So we plotted a course of action for the next week: we would start an hour
later, and not tell him. The game was at my place (though I was not the
game\'s GM). He showed up at the usual time and found me alone at home
watching TV. I told him there was no game anymore. He stood there confused
for a moment, then left. We never saw him again...

As far as advice goes, though -- sometimes you have to take the bull
by the horns and be direct. If you and the others find his presence
annoying and don\'t want him in the game anymore, just tell him that.

Hope this helps. (Let us know how it turns out.)

The only time I tried Rifts involved just such a conflict.  All of us
generated our characters without reference to each others\' characters. 
Well, my character was the odd man out:  everyone but me was pretty
amoral.  I felt as if I was Luke Skywalker, with Han, Chewbacca, and
Leia all saying, "C\'mon, Luke!  Let\'s try this Dark Side stuff!  It\'ll
be _fun_!"

I walked during the first session, after explaining that I couldn\'t stay
in character and play in this kind of game.  Luckily, my fellow gamers
had played other games with me, and respected my decision.

Actually, I was thinking about this discussion in the shower before I headed
off to class, and now many, many hours later I can get back to it (after my
classes were done, I indulged myself with a trip to see "Run, Lola, Run!"
which I enjoyed immensely, see it!).

We Travellers don\'t have rules lawyers, but we do have an archetype that can
rival them: background lawyers. I remember when I first got on and mentioned
that I use the concept of artificial intelligence in my Traveller campaigns
I received responses from the polite, but condescending (Everyone knows that
the introduction of artificial intelligence will create a society where
humans are nothing more than slaves to machines, scoff scoff scoff) to the
downright hostile (one angry email I got told me colorfully that I wasn\'t
playing Traveller).

I\'m not trying to tear open old wounds again. Although we\'re lacking rules
lawyers, we do have our own version. I mean no offense to anyone in
particular here, as the list seems to have quieted down a bit in the years
since I\'ve started.

I\'m sorry to hear that. So far I haven\'t had anything run me off the computer, can\'t run..can\'t take the long walks I use to..., can\'t make a fist to punch the wall, and I can\'t see worth a darn, but bashing around the computer I can still do.

...and it was only until "Masters of the Vortex" that a computer became
fast enough to work out the correct weight and trajectory of a bomb to shut
down a vortex. Otherwise:
     - your name had to be Thorndyke  ;-)  OR

According to the book, it\'s just an example plan.  Just something they put

Because it knows the power is about to be cut?

I\'d say that an "egg" can\'t be smaller than (say) 1/10th the size of
the minimum size required for Virus to *run*. 1/100th if you feel
nasty. 

That leaves out "pocket calculators". But higher TL pocket computers
can be a danger. So can lots and lots of data storage devices. 

And allow virus to create smaller versions, but at the cost of being
dumber and less powerful. This allows for relatively "dumb" devices
(like envoronmental contrllers) to be infected with a "mini-virus" that
can attack players. But it won\'t be able to jump to other types of cpu.
Nor will it "outsmart" players who get crafty enough. 

In short, the "mini-virus" acts as a sort of "dedicated sup-processor"
for the real virus. And many (most!) people won\'t distinguish between
them, because either can kill you. But in actuality, the "mini-virus"
isn\'t all that dangerous. It doesn\'t spread well, and isn\'t any more
malicious than your typical law level 0 "anti-hujack" or "security"
program. 

This would make the situation a lot more believable for many of us. Yet
it won\'t look that different to players unless they really pay
attention. 

It reduces smaller electronic items to "programmable booby traps". Yet
*paranoia* will ensure that it\'ll be a long time before this is
realized.

Downloaded via the network. With a really *tiny* code stub (probably
several of them) buried someplace harmless. The Stub will do a "load
and execute" on the "egg", but unless carefully examined, it\'ll just
look like the system loading a code module in response to some need
("What\'s that?" "Nothing, it just needed to load a different protocol
to talk to the framistat." )

Actually, as I point out in my other post, there\'s no reason the virus
wouldn\'t have even fairly *stupid* devices loaded with software that
could prove decidedly hostile to intruders. If they don\'t get their
"Everything\'s ok" packet from the Virus every so often, they quit
operating normally and start misbehaving. Things like environmental
controllers dumping the air from sections of a ship. 

So even low class gear could be dangerous, but if you took precautions,
you can easily deactivate it, simply because it\'s not *bright* even to
do more than a few fixed "sabotage" or "anti-personnel" functions. 

To simulate this properly, the GM should consider what sort of
equipment might contain a computer that *controls* something. And what
sort of "sensors" (if any) it may have. 

The sensors determine what sort of "inputs" it will have available as
"triggers" for behavior. What it controls determines what sort of
"attack" it can commit. 

So, for example a *really* dumb unit (say the equivalent of a room
thermostat) would have a temp sensor, and maybe a clock. On shipboard,
it might also have pressure and humidity inputs. And maybe an input
from the drive or a sensor to let it know whay sort of acceleration the
ship is undergoing. 

For controls, it controls temp, pressure, humidity, and possibly
gravity. 

So, given these, you draw up a set of "if you are in attack mode do
*this* if *that* occurs" where "that" is a sensor input or inputs, and
"this" is doing something with the controlled items. 

For example:

1. if accel > 3g set room gravity to max *inline* with accel (ie add
   the room field and the accel)
2. if time=0400 lower oxygen content to zero until 0500

Thus, the room will be normal and safe, *unless* the ship goes above
3g, or someone spends the night in the room. Wonder how long it\'ll take
them to find this "mini-virus". And if they\'ll find it before it kills?

A more advanced unit of the same type might contain sensors that will
let it determine if there are people in the room and how many (to
adjust lights and heat). So it can get even nastier. 

Anyway, draw up a bunch of these "programs", possibily by drawing slips
of paper with possible attacks and possible "triggers" from a hat. 

With a little effort you can turn a ship, apartment, or installation
into a maze of seemingly intelligent booby traps, all of which operate
without any attention by Virus. 

Just picture the hazards in a mess hall kitchen, or a repair workshop!
And using an "autochef" is playing Russian roulette. :-)

The final "nasty" is that this may well make the players think that
they failed to kill the Virus. They may not realize that they are
dealing with a bunch of boobytraps that it left behind. 

"I tell you there\'s *no* unaccounted for network traffic!"
"But the Virus *has* to be controlling all this somehow!"

While the average TL of the Solomani may have been higher than 
that of the 3I, the 3I had enough TL14 units (due to its great size) 
that this didn\'t matter for long enough to defeat the Solomani and 
push them back past Terra. This is why the 3I stopped there - they 
lacked the high tech reserves to keep moving forward. All IMO, and 
IMTU, of course.

The point is not to "choke" the news, but to slow the news. Since canon
has j6 naval couriers [Suplement 9] and alternate J6 news and shipping
[TTA], the X-Boat system runs about J3.5 (Mostly J3, with significant j4
legs) [Maps, Sups 3,7,10,11, TTA, Bk 6], and most merchants are J2 [Ibid],
the trick is that full info is slowed. The Navy and Nobles (and MegaCorps)
get info (as much as is available) as soon as possible, via J6. The
official releases go out about J3-4, via the XBoat net, and J2 off the
routes via merchants. Plus, civilian and rumor data spreads primarily with
the J1-2 merchants.... So the Nobles get time to "make policy" before the
commoners get anything other than the "Official Statements" (and sometimes
before those, too), and then the third party bits, at best go with the
official statements, and fringe materials spread by rumor, often at J1-2.

Question: Do Vargyr females have hypertrophied breasts like Human

These aren\'t terribly likely. *Very* few animals on earth have
collorations derived from what they eat. Pink Flamingoes are the only
example I can think of. That\'s due to a pink compound in the shrimp
they eat in the wild. 

It *is* known that with sufficiently high dosages of carotene a human
can become *quite* orange, with few or no ill effects. But this
required really *dedicated* munching on carrots :-)

But your "constant for temperature" *varies* according to the spectral
class of a star. Type O stars are blue-white due to the incredible
temperature at the surface. Type B is "Blue" and somewhat cooler. Type
A is cooler yet, F is getting into the yellow-white range. G is
"yellow" like Sol. K is orangeish. M is *red* (as in "red hot").

The energy per unit of surface area of the star decreases *rapidly* as
you drop thru the classes. So the "habitable zone" is *not* a constant
distance.

Nope. "Main sequence" stars occur in *all* spectral classes. Thus the
habitable zone is *not* at a constant number of diameters. The number
of diameters depends on the spectral class, *not* on whether the star
is in the main sequence. 

Red dwarfs are main sequence, and small. Red giants are not main
sequence, but are huge. The habitable zone for *both* is the same
number of stellar diameters out, because the are the same spectral
class. 

But the *masses* are quite different.

I am not a lawyer. But from what I recall lawyers saying, I daresay
that getting DGPs authors together might be worthwhile. Any of you that
had any sort of contract and who weren\'t paid, can reclaim the
copyright fairly easily as I understand it. 

It *would* cost money. But I bet that once his "valuable properties
start *costing* money, Roger will be *glad* to dump them.

If there isn\'t a contract things are gonna get a lot messier. 

For what it\'s worth, *I* would spend the $20-50 for s hort consult with
a lawyer regarding retrieving the copyright on your material.

You\'d have to heat a large patch of ground or water. That\'s gonna be

Several times... One player in my group is being punted when we switch
systems (in a few weeks; my group tends to play one system only for 3-6
months before I want to do something else) for numerous complaints by other
players. Mostly, complaints about him fudging dice (I\'ve been watching how
he hides his dice from EVERYONE...), being adversarial in player-to-player
interactions (not in-character actions, tho), and failing to pick up after
himself. Sadly, we\'ll p[rolly lose his wife as well, who is finally
learnign to Role-Play, not just "Roll dice on cue". Funny, it is the same
player, who, after his Hiver lost 1 point off of Int and Edu (major failure
of the gland, requiring massive invasive surgury to restart, with
complications) dropping them both to 10\'s under TNE, threw a tantrum, threw
his character sheet at me, and stormed out.

Roger has also repeatedly started development on new ideas, only to
(apparently) forget to pay his internet bills, and change emails, and let
the lists expire... He\'s had 4 really good projects, none of which have
gone much furhter than getting a good setting material hashed out... One of
them, however, was remarkably close to something T$R/WotC just released for
Alternity.

Also, Roger has discussed the negotiations with MWM... in vague terms... on
one of the "development" lists he\'s becomeing infamous for... something to
the effect of "Marc is slightly unreasonable about the liscencing issue,
and IG is totally unreasonable. Eventually Marc will come around and either
buy the rights or liscence me to reprint and finish off the old materials."

He does have a wildly creative streak... unfortunately, he is a creator,
not a buisinessman. And he\'s got a "Must Do Project" that he does owe to
"prebuyers" from the tail end of DGP under JDF era... AI. And he\'s still
claiming that debt, and that it will be fullfilled... Eventually.

I still have one in storage, but it needs a new keyboard (or rather, I need
to wire a different connection from the keyboard to the jack... since the
mylar cable broke cleanly just past the end of the exposed connector
surface). It does, in fact, run just fine, last I checked, with 16K.

Also in storage, I have a Kaypro II (old 2) CPM Luggable-box... 80 column
text-only, dual SSSD Floppies (IIRC). And that runs just fine... but I can
run an emulator on a Perf. 640 that makes it look terribly slow.

And, not to restart the commensurate flame-war, but to resurect the topic:

Ob Trav: PC\'s get a "great New ____ install package", and find out (too
late) that it only runs under an emulator... at least for any of the
machines they have.... and once they get it running on that TL 15 machine,
can they figure out how to slow it down enough to use?

How good is emulation in YTU. (IMTU, the "Official Imperial Virtual
Machine" is a purely emulated standard, required for imperial liscence of a
given computer for starship use... On TL5-7 machines, it is hardware
compatable with the IVM, on TL 8-9, it is usually firmware based emulation,
an TL 10-15, it is usually dynamic recompiling.

IMTU, depends on who your polity is.  The most common faction of the Shattered Imperium as far as my players is concerned (the Federation of Daibei) does, the Principality of Caledon does, the Carrillian Assembly *doesn\'t*.  And my players know *nothing* of the practices of the Solomani Confederation (does), the Grand Khanate (doesn\'t), the Confederacy of Duncinae (does), the Carter Technum (does), the Lanyard Colonies (does), the Grand Duchy of Marlheim (doesn\'t), or any of the clans of the Aslan Hierate (some do, some don\'t).

YM, of course, MV.

That\'s what Anthony was saying when I accepted his clarification:

Red giants and red dwarfs have a habitability zone at the same
number of stellar diameters as each other.

Yellow giants and yellow dwarfs also have a habitability zone at the same
number of stellar diameters as each other, but at a greater number of
diameters than the red stars.

Blue giants and blue dwarfs also have a habitability zone at the same
number of stellar diameters as each other, but at a greater number of
diameters than the yellow stars.

From the Sol example, habitable systems around yellow stars are all at
about 100 stellar diameters. The stellar diameter only affects jump masking.

Those around red stars are all inside 100 stellar diameters (so you have
to fly much further from the planet to jump - especially for red giants).

Those around blue stars will be so far away from the star that jump masking
probably isn\'t a problem.

>But the *masses* are quite different. 

Canon says 100 diameters (but doesn\'t mention stars in CT, IIRC).

"Logic" says "that\'s silly" because of the red giant/black hole/
100 diameters of the galaxy problem - it should be based on gravity
or tidal values (mass/r^2 or mass/r^3).

Canon presumably repsonds by asking "what planets around red giants/
black holes do you expect to find?".

I worked on the production of this book, and IIRC Keven\'s right - we just

I spent some money from an inheritance to get a system that was close
to state of the art (but *not* "bleeding edge"). It\'s paying off as I
learn the ins and outs of faster gear. 

But I\'m also "custodian" of various gear going back to 1978 (a
"Diskwriter", a rather strange 8080 system intended for data entry).

There is zero, nada, none, traveller software available for it.  I am working to

	I like to run games in which the players decide on goals,
	where to go, what to do, etc., but some limits must be
	set (IMHO).  The main limit that I have always tried to 
	enforce is on group integrity: since the PCs are 
	automatically hired into the group, it is not fair (and it 
	is often no fun) for one or more to work against the 
	others.  There are exceptions to this rule, such as plots
	that are enhanced by having a spy in the group, but I
	generally try to keep the party compatable.  This does not
	mean that there is no conflict in the group, only that the
	characters can realistically work together and stay in 
	character.

Yes, very, thank you. Keep em coming.

After my recent experiences at posting I would consider a null response a good
sign :)

In my limited experience of posting most are never responded to. Of the rest the
thread is usually very narrow with only one or two other people involved. The
only ones that are taken up with gusto are when you get flamed for your temerity
in breaking someones canon.

I got 50lbs, 1cf, .10kW, 1,000,000mi range.

GT uses the 25lbs version too.

You could add compact, dedicated & dumb options to get it down to 0.375 lbs,

In keeping with the GT version. 
I am not sure if it needs any at all for very short term space use (one laser

I give mine one point of cheap ablative armor. Opinions?

I got Cr4500. Quarter cost at TL10. See 2nd para after table.

Me neither. My original intent when exploring different armor types was in
making more economical traders. Standard Armor made a slight difference to
Return on Investment but Advanced armor was useless. For completeness I plugged
it into a fast military craft (a 400DT SDB) and thought hey, that is quite good,
but not amazing.

I was quite surprised that the suggestion was considered canon breaking. From
posts I had seen on the TML my impression was that GT starship armor was less
capable than CT starship armor in general - in terms of its stopping power. 

I would be interested to see the armor comparison table and the example ships
that were the basis of this conclusion.

My point, obviously very badly made, was that I was not happy at being told that
I shouldn\'t be posting to the TML if I don\'t know CT.  The implication of your
comment, at least to me, was that "this is the CTML, other systems are allowed
here under tolerance and then only if you also know CT".

Many other posters said pretty much the same thing in follow up posts. 

As a significant proportion of the TML are probably GT only, I felt this CT
elitism could not go unchallenged, on a list that is supposed to be open to all
versions of traveller. Not just to those people who know CT.

Well that was part of the problem for me. I knew you had embraced GT, and if you
could be guilty of inadvertent CT elitism then I thought the gulf was probably
too wide too bridge.

It does make them _much_ more expensive. I found that for the same performance I
got around 50% increase in armour rating and a 25% increase in price (for the
GTL10 SDB).

>I can see three choices here:

>1) Errata the GT sidebar that allows advanced materials (ie. prohibit them).

Note also that both the GTL10 & GTL12 space interceptor missiles use advanced
armour (p158/p159).

If they are in the reprinted errata\'d version of GT, all flames are off, right
;-)

>2) Handwave a reason why they aren\'t used for starships.

Well Standard Armour makes a small difference to slow traders of around 1G or
less. Enough to make a small difference to FT economics, but nothing major. 

As I posted previously using low tech standard fuel tanks rather than ultra
light self sealing fuel tanks does make a mahor difference to economics. From
posts I have seen I understand fuel tanks are essentially free under CT so this
is definitely not canon breaking.

Advanced armour makes a difference to fast military ships in GT, but are we sure
this is a canon breaking thing? I have not seen one jot of evidence posted to
support the claim that it is possible to build starships in GT that have more
armour stopping power than ships in CT. Lots of flames but no firewood. Perhaps
someone who knows both systems well would care to post an impartial comparison.
I wouldn\'t be at all surprised if GT advanced armour is inferior to CT standard
armour in terms of what ships can carry and stopping power.

Take the GTL10/CTL12 SDB in GT with an armour rating of DR 1000. Say we used
advanced armour and increased this to DR 1500. The average armour penetration
damage of a GTL10 laser is DR 2100 (6d*50[2]). So even an average hit would
still get through the armour. What is the equivalent for CT?

Hey it\'s not as if existing GT ships are optimal using even the default
materials. The supposedly scary happy fun ball in GT has the minimum possible GT
armour rating of DR100. I assume all versions of traveller have this kind of
problem.

I wouldn\'t bother or expect existing ships in print to be redesigned. They are
fine for roleplaying which is what really counts.  I would expect newer designs
to use whatever options are available/sanctioned to the full. Whether that
included advanced armour or not.

We moved ... or specifically, I moved -- I was in the process of going from

my old phone number ...

It is one of the least proud moments in my life, but it was very effective.


>Here\'s a clarification.  One member is a competetive pain in

Is he a friend, or an associate. If he\'s a friend, that\'s when things
become difficult.

With associates you just say "No offense, but it\'s not very fun for the
rest of us to play with you, so I\'m going to ask you to leave." and be done
with him.

With friends you say "No offense, but it\'s not very fun for the rest of us
to play with you, so I\'m going to ask you to leave." and then have to deal
with his injured feelings and all of that.

There\'s no easy out -- well, except for lying and/or moving. But if he\'s a
friend, he deserves more than a lie, and if he\'s not, then why feel the
need to lie?

Yikes!  I have always found relative screen sizes to be very much a matter
of personal taste, and for my taste, that is way too many pixels per inch.
:)  Similarly, my new 21" (19.8" viewable) will easily run 1600 x 1200, but
the icons and text just become too small for my comfort.  By using a more
conservative 1280 x 1024, I can actually read the code I\'m writing.  OTH, I
have encounted users who insisted on running 640 x 480 on 17" monitors,
because that is what they are used to.  To them, my recomendation of 1024 x
768 was \'too small\'.  I\'d been getting by for years with inexpensive
monitors, but I got a major job upgrade this spring, so I splurged on the
Trinitron.  I\'m happy with the money I spent, I work at home now quite a
bit, so I spend many \'quality\' hours a day looking at this CRT.

Shouldn\'t this modify the char gen rules a tad?  Here\'s why I think so.
IIRC the Royal Navy of the 18th-19th cent. the best class of ship to get a
posting to was a frigate.  Frigates were usually sent about on independent
duties and were more likely to find and capture enemy merchants, smugglers
and/or blockade runners.  This was in part due the fact that the average
merchant Captain knew to avoid the large fleets where most if not all the
larger ships were concentrated.

ObTrav:  With the higher probability of prize money associated with
anti-piracy/picket duty, shouldn\'t the officers and crews of these ships
receive a credit bonus?  What about the possibility of privately owned ships
being hired out as Privateers/Mercenaries against pirates?  This could prove
financially worthwhile to courageous characters in a well-armed ship.

Just a thought...

Oops. You mean 10, 15, and 15 g per cm^3, right?

Leonard, this is a really great post!  I had never thought about
the Virus\' ability to boobytrap every "Java-enabled" (tm) system
on a starship.

Going a step farther, even today microcontrollers tend to be computers
in their own right, and are embedded into every appliance because
they\'re so cheap... has you coffee maker ever tried to kill you yet?
Kind of like your house being haunted...

IMTU, I handle this via the \'cash\' rolls in chargen.  Course, I use CT, but...

Hmmmmmmmmm...  An idea just crossed my limited lil mind.  Ex-Marines who were 
posted to Ship\'s Troops have an option to take *one* cash roll on the Navy 
table?

INVINCIBLE, INDEFATIGABLE and QUEEN MARY were all battlecruisers, not
dreadnought battleships.

Also, the UK was outproducing Germany in Battlecruisers and Battleships.
It also had a large advantage of numbers, so it could afford these
losses. (You also neglect the fact that Seydlitz was out of action for
months). Finally, the Grand Fleet was ready for another battle 24 hours
after Jutland. The High Seas Fleet wasn\'t able to put to sea for months.

Just like the debates over the failure to win WWI by defeating the
Germans and pushing them back to Germany, rather than by the Armistice,
being one cause of WWII; or the debates over the failure in 1991 to push
on to Baghdad and oust Saddam.

IMHO, the best time to negotiate victory terms is with your foot on your
enemy\'s neck.

Depends if the Imperium can bring it\'s mass to bear. It\'s no use having
scads and scads of units if you can\'t bring them to bear on the enemy in
a reasonable timescale. Otherwise, you are feeding meat into a mincing
machine.

Exactly. I\'m the current GM for Rob\'s group and I really enjoy
running a highly-detailed campaign that runs itself (i.e. I
provide opportunities for the players only when they run out
of ideas). I am more than happy to explain any ruling I make
if a player asks for one and even back out of it if the player
makes a half-way decent case for his point of view, especially
when I\'m learning a new rules set (i.e. GURPS).

I have little patience with a player who gets bent out of shape
because he makes a stupid tactical error and finds out his
handy dandy battledress suit *isn\'t* invunerable to high TL
military weaponry.

Rule #1 in my campaigns: Use the rules to get out of situations
they get you into.

Rule #2: There is _always_ a way out if you think hard enough.
(I try to make sure of it)

Palm OS isn\'t bad - it\'s a nice *organiser* verging on a Palm top. If you
feel more computer orientated get a Psion 5 / 5Mx which is the best (IMO)
thing between a laptop and an organiser. Don\'t worry about B&W over colour
as B&W is less poor demanding (usually). The Palm V requires you to
recharge in a cradle - the Palm III uses AAA size batteries and is more
practical from my perspective. The V is sexier though. I\'ve yet to see any
Traveller software for PalmOS.

As a female, I am amazed by the things other women tell me about their
men.  I don\'t like it and have been known to say "If he\'s THAT bad why are
you still with him?"  We are trained to make endless excuses.

She may be one of the sort who says "oh well, at least he has a job... at
least he doesn\'t beat me..."

Traveller license, but the amount of money that Marc required made the

was I don\'t think any money was going to be made during the first couple of

One key point about armor on ships in CT (and MT) vs GT:
	CT/MT armours (in gurps terms) would be primarily PD, with very
		little DR (if any). Especially since a HG/MT space combat
		round represents hundreds of shots.
	GT Armors are extremely DR intensive.

SO the "Effectiveness" issue cannot be objectively qualified; the armor
methodology is far to mechanics-specific, and quite different. More
importantly, what materials are used can be qualitatively compared...
G:Veh lists specific types of materials by TL; these can be compared with
the materials lists from traveller (specifically Striker, MT, and FF&S,
which all use the same base breakpoints for materials tech).

Traditionally, most designs with a sufficient detail level indicate that
Crystaliron, then Superdense, then finally bonded superdense are the hull
metals of choice with increaseing TL.

As for canon-breaking? No. Uninformed twiddleing, maybe... Under the non-CT
versions, you can tweak hull materials. So there is no reason you shouldn\'t
be able to in GT. However, the guidleines are still being
hashed/flamed/argued by some on the list... as they were not in the copy of
GT *I* purchased...

That\'s a good one Keven.  I hadn\'t considered the Marines.

I was thinking of maybe a +1 on *one* cash roll for the Officers of a
successful Anti-Piracy tour, cumulative with any other DM\'s.  With the crew
given a 5,000 CR for serving a full tour aboard an SDB or Patrol Cruiser in
a high piracy area.  Of course, the survival roll might have to be modified
to reflect the greater danger incurred.

I could see a +1 modifier for every 3 Ship\'s Troops posting for that cash roll on the navy table.  The troopies would *definitely* be involved in boarding any ships taken, but not all actions would be profitable.  Thanxx for the idea.  <grin>

A large, highly public American toy corporation now owns Magic the
Gathering and D&D. 

Expect these games to vanish once the fundies start in on Hasbro.
They\'re a lot more vulnerable to loud calls for boycotts than either
WOTC or TSR ever were.

The company that makes GI Joe and Monopoly now sells satanic demon
raising instruction kits that cause children to go insane, wear black
trenchcoats and kill innocent classmates en masse.

At least that\'s how the fundie spin will be.

My prediction?

Hasbro will strip out Pokemon, and toss the rest quietly on the
dungheap. Pokemon will be a fading fad, gone in 6 months anyway, but
I\'ll bet Hasbro more than gets their $325 million out of it. They were
willing to bet that.

It\'s telling that the founders of WOTC were willing to sell now...in a
take the money and run sort of way.

	Used to get into this discussion with a female friend; after
listening to some of her stories, I\'d usually commiserate by
admitting "Yep, men are pigs" ... to which she\'d reply "and women are
stupid, so the species survives ..." <G>

I dunno, that design is a "coil gun" (mass driver) not a rail gun.

Rail guns have a pair of conductive rails, runninng from "breech" to
"end of barrel". There\'s a strong, constant, *vertical* magnetic field.
When a conductive (no need for "ferrous") projectile is placed across
the rails, a high current flows from left to right (or is it right to
left?). 

The JxB forces as the current flow reacts against the magnetic field
accelerates the projectile down the rails. 

We figured we\'d use alnico magnets (like those "100 lb pull" pocket
sized magnets you see in the catalogs). Just line them pu and drill the
"barrel" thru the ceramic seperator. Run some *heavy* wire (8 guage?)
the length of the barrel as "rails". Use BBs as projectiles. 

We\'d be happy if we got regular rifle velocities out of the
contraption. :-)

Frankly, I *liked* having MA & GW using "D&D"-like rules. It meant you
could do crossovers. Of course, given the way hit points were assigned
in GW/MA the D&D characters are in a *world* of trouble unless they
average 7th level or higher.

I\'m not a photographer, but I recall a jewler friend mentioning that
you need special closeup lenses to take the sort of picture you want.
Normal cameras just plain *won\'t* focus that close. And forget
"autofocus". 

Ask at your local camera shop.

	In my last office we made a much simpler "railgun" ... took an 8\'
section of 1/4" thick angle iron, swiped all the rubberbands in
sight, hooked them to one end, and then pulled a pen back to the
other.  Not quite rifle velocity, but it made an impressive dent in
the sound reduction panel 50\' across the bay ...

Hmm. Interestingly, Hasbro have just made the Atari Jaguar an open system
after their aquisition of Atari over two (?) years ago - this means anyone
can make software for it. There may be hope yet...

My prediction - that $325 Million will be used in part to take over at
least one other company eg White Wolf.

Hell, if I was offered $325 million for the rights to Traveller (if I owned
them!) I\'d sell. I could always play Faded Suns.... ;-)

Yes, but not for the reason you think. I seem to recall that most
"autofocus" cameras use *ultrasonic* ranging. Given the small size of
the minauture, it never even registered, the camera probably focused on
the *maps*.

It\'s fun to watch a rules lawyer come up against a GM who *knows* the
rules. Or, in one case I was involved with a GM who has another player
who *knows* the rules. So for every "goodie" the rules lawyer points
out on page 17, the knowledgable one can point out the disadvantages
that go with it from page 75. 

I\'ve run into *very* few "rules lawyer" types that *weren\'t* running
that sort of scam. That is, using advantages, and hoping the GM didn\'t
know about the (seperately listed elsewhere) *disadvantages*.

I think this is likely to put the whole industry in the Sh*t. If D&D gets 
binned, there\'ll be practically no recruitment of new gamers, and if 
here (NZ) is anything to go by, a lot of stores will close or stop 
carrying rpgs. D&D is just too much of the rpg turnover.

For one, the industry is pretty dead already, with a few important
exceptions.  Think about how many companies have gone down in the last two
years.  But I think we\'ll still get new players, but they\'re all going to be
goths *grin \'n shrug*.  I\'m telling you, the only way out of this morass
we\'re getting into is LARPing, something the Man can\'t get at.  Well, that\'s

anything about the Traveller LARP that went on at GenCon in Aug went?

Like I pointed out to a guy I know, it\'s a plot. They are going to buy out
the entire RPG and CCG industries and kill them to rise the sell of board
games. :(

That\'s probably what it means, unless some one has gotten permission from FASA

AFAIK, FASA still controls those copyrights, that is they weren\'t sold to

Bruce, the Assembly of God down the road already holds periodic toy
burnings during their revivals staring GI Joe and Barbie.  They
don\'t *need* to the D&D/MtG connection, they already think the
toymakers are agents of the Devil.

Who knows.  Hasbro bought AH mainly for the titles and ideas they
could mine for their computer game division.  I suspect they have
the same idea with WOTC/TSR. 

The problem, really, is that Hasbro has no motive to pursue low
volume, small profit, ventures like either MtG cards or TSR RPGs.
Although, they may be high volume/profit in our *little* niche, it\'s
small potatos in the mainstream toy and game markets.

It\'s very hard to design a general-purpose lens that will focus from 2 inches
in front of the lens all the way to infinity. What you want is a "macro" lens,
specialized for closeup photography;
you can buy one for most SLR ("interchangeable lens") type cameras.
Even used such a lens might be fairly expensive, so what you might want
to do is rent one from a good camera shop. (I can suggest one for the
SF Bay area, if anyone wants to email me.)

Hey, Dave!

A better question is, has you *mother* ever been in Conroe, Texas? <g>

But seriously, I knew a Dave Golden in high school in Milton, Florida, but having seen your picture on your website I\'m sure that wasn\'t you either...unless you lost 100 pounds and changed hair color.  Nah, it still couldn\'t be you! <g>

Well, I wouldn\'t shed a tear about CCG\'s disappearing, but I\'d miss the

Yep, and the shots of the starships from further away actually came out
better. The focus to the starship was 95% the focus to the background.
The focusing on the background may be the problem, together with the
vertical line issue swordworlder mentioned. I think this weekend I\'ll
take the hex background outside (to eliminate any lighting issues) and
shoot a roll at carefully documented ranges and zooms.


Thanks to all on the TML for their recommendations. With any luck I\'ll
be posting my url soon!

I needed it to avoid trashing the graphics I was viewing. And I don\'t
know about Win 95/98, but under OS/2 I can select "large fonts". That
gets rid of just about all of the "too small" problems.

Which is *silly*. There are lots of ordinance uses for "use once"
cells. Though, frankly, there won\'t be a lot of cost/size/weight
difference between "use once" and "rechargeable". The main *real world*
difference I can think of is in making the "plates" heavier duty so
they can handle multiple charge/discharge cycles.

Well, I\'ll admit, I\'ll be glad to see the end of Magic; The Addiction.  When 
I was looting^H^H^H^H^H^Hshopping at my FLGS the other day, a couple kids 
came in asking about \'demonic cards\' and such.  The owner didn\'t exactly 
freek, but he put it in no uncertain terms that it\'s a *GAME* dammit, not a 
religion.

Kinda makes you wonder bout the kids coming up today...

Even the non-Keith stuff was good.  Look at \'Rescue on Galatea\' some
time.  IMNSFBHO, it\'s one of the *BEST* non-GDW adventure booklets
printed.  The whole concept was great, and I\'m still trying to figger out how
to swipe^H^H^H^H^Hmine this puppy for adventure nuggets for my PBEM.  Haven\'t
found a geologically active world like Galatea in Reavers\' Deep yet that fits
the profile.  But I\'m still looking...

  They were built using the same principles as their battleship stablemates
and cost roughly the same; I\'ve also seen them referred to as dreadnoughts.

  FWIW, I class any KM tactical victory at Jutland as attritional at best
(i.e., somewhat dubious overall).

In the sense that they were all-big-gun turbine-driven ships, they were
dreadnoughts.  However, the fleets of the day had already differentiated
between the two main types of dreadnoughts (battleships and
battlecruisers), so it\'s unfair to call the battleships.

ObTrav: the comparable distinction between ship types seems to be between
heavy cruisers (J-4, heavy armor) and fleet intruders/frontier cruisers
(J-5, less armor)  There doesn\'t seem to be any interest in a J-5 ship the
size of a Tigress.  Interestingly, the one canonical Fleet intruder I know
of is also a good deal slower (fewer gs) than her cruiser counterparts.

It\'s possible, but doubtful. TSR is actually running in the black nowadays.
Unlike Hasbro\'s purchase of Avalon Hill, which was the purchase of a company
that was playing to a vanishED market (note the past tense), TSR is now
economically viable. Avalon Hill was purchased not that long ago with the
intent to turn out computer games based on the properties, as far as I
recall, give them a chance to do it. Computer games don\'t get made
overnight, and the type of retooling that Hasbro will require to be a player
in the computer game market is immense.

D&D, and roleplaying in general, have both managed to avoid any real
negative press recently. In fact, the only people who really strongly object
to AD&D are the type of loonies who have been attacking Disney and the
Teletubbies... and neither has really bowed to the pressure yet.

>The company that makes GI Joe and Monopoly now sells satanic demon

Yes, and you do understand how much flack Hasbro took in the 80s for making
the G.I. Joe line, a line of "war toys." They *never bowed,* and to this day
still support the collectors of G.I. Joe with special editions that get red
tagged. In other words, they\'re supporting the collectors while losing
money. Note: I\'m talking about the small action figures here, not the 12
inch dolls, which they continue to release at a loss as well.

>At least that\'s how the fundie spin will be.


Perhaps, but time will tell if it will actually have any real effect. Hasbro
didn\'t let the anti-violent toy crowd, which was a strong lobby, even in the
80s, take down G.I. Joe, so don\'t be surprised if they stick by Wizards of
the Coast.

Hasbro is an established company that\'s "been there and done that." Of all
the companies out there, very few large American companies have had the guts
to stand by fans of their line (specifically in this case, G.I. Joe). They
have continued to support the niche market of Joe collectors, at
considerable cost to themselves. Hasbro doesn\'t have a record of backing
down to complaints. G.I. Joe and The Transformers both came under fire at
different points, and Hasbro stuck with them.

Sure, they\'re sitting on Avalon Hill properties. I hope you didn\'t expect to
see Panzer Blitz sitting next to Monopoly at your local toy store! It was
never fated to happen. The tabletop wargaming market is dead. There is no
market for them.

On the other hand, TSR is the industry leader in roleplaying games. It\'s not
a dead market. In fact, as of recently, the roleplaying market has begun
growing again, due in large part to excellent leadership of the WoTC\'s new
management on the AD&D line.

That\'s right! It\'s a reversal of the trend we\'ve been seeing for so long.
New roleplayers are being lured in.

Love it or hate it, the Dungeons and Dragons line is what lures new gamers,
and that\'s good for the whole industry.

Pokemon will be a fading fad? What a surprise! ;)

Of course it will be. There is no evidence that Hasbro bows to the whims of
special interest groups *like a smaller company must*. Let me repeat that,
*like a smaller company must.*

>It\'s telling that the founders of WOTC were willing to sell now...in a
>take the money and run sort of way.


Really? Any evidence to back that up? Wizards of the Coast turned a bankrupt
gaming company on the skids into a money making proposition.

Yeah, sure, Magic: The Gathering gets a bum rap... a long time ago when I
was a wee roleplayer the grognards at the local hobby shop often gathered
around, talking models and Napoleonics, about how roleplaying games were
destroying their hobby. It is humorous that 15-20 years later, old grognard
roleplayers would complain that CCGs would kill their hobby.

The truth? WotC were canny enough to realize that CCGs were a flash in the
pan, more or less, and they rode the gravy train for as long as they could.
They knew they had to break into the roleplaying game market, one with an
older and more established pedigree. Their first attempt was abortive, at
best, and they screwed alot of people over. That sucks, there is no denying
that. Then, they took the opportunity to buy TSR, expand its line, and pull
it out of an economic hole. Not a slump, a hole. They made very good
decisions with TSR and now there will be more people who will get turned on
to roleplaying games.

Okay, let\'s take a look at some other possible scenarios:

1.) Wizards of the Coast Never Forms: WotC never forms. The jump from
trading cards to trading card games never happens. Comic purchases hit a
slump (which they did, the market has been declining). With less free money
floating around, they stick with what works. Comics. Some expand to carry
roleplaying games. TSR finally slides into bankruptcy, only nobody\'s
interested in buying. The most popular roleplaying game, by a decent margin,
disappears from chain bookstores and hobby shops. Without 13 year old hack
and slashers there are no 16 year old angsty goth gamers. White Wolf
collapses in on itself. Without 13 year old hack and slashers there are no
16 year old power gamers. Palladium collapses in on itself. West End games
collapses shortly thereafter, the lucrative Star Wars line not enough to
save it. Four major roleplaying game companies disappear from the face of
the earth. It\'s up to Steve Jackson now to singlehandedly save roleplaying
games with a tiny share in the market. GURPS has never been good at luring
new players anyway and its got absolutely no recognition among
non-roleplayers. They might pull through for a few years and then eventually
go the way of GDW, just not enough interest in the product.

2.) Wizards of the Coast Sticks with the Unpopular RPG Properties They
Planned: They introduce Magic: The Gathering to comic book stores. Comics
have entered into a slump, and comic book stores are looking for something
new. Magic: The Gathering fits the bill nicely. WotC makes alot of money.
The comic book stores literally rake in the cash. The comic book stores pump
lots of this money into CCGs, but they siphon off some to roleplaying games.
Comic book stores begin to carry increased amounts of RPGs, which is
essential to the growth of the industry. The introduce Everway and some
other RPG properties, and they sell alright. WotC sticks with them, however.
It\'s something of a financial drain, so they don\'t have any free capital
floating around when TSR goes belly up, the industry dies as explained
above.

3.) Wizards of the Coast Buys TSR: Everything goes as #2, above, except they
fire lots of people in their roleplaying development area. It sucks, and
these people gt screwed, but WotC feels it expanded too fast. They still
want to break into the RPG market. TSR goes belly up. WoTC buys the company.
They focus on the aspects of AD&D that make it sell, and begin to try to woo
back old school AD&D fans. For the most part it works, and within a few
years TSR goes from bankrupt to running in the black. This is good for the
whole industry, as AD&D is the introductory game for the *vast majority* of
roleplayers. If AD&D\'s customer base grows, it\'s safe to assume that the
customer base of roleplaying games will grow. It\'s simple math. The more
AD&D players there are, the more who will experiment with other games they
never heard of. WotC makes a lucrative deal with Interplay to put out
Baldur\'s Gate, a smash hit computer game that lures many new players who got
their first taste of the concepts involved with Interplay\'s popular Fallout
CRPG (GURPS had their chance, but they passed it up).

Um... yeah, you\'ve already guessed it. #3 is what happened. I think that the
near future will be very telling for the hobby we all love.

Last fall I tried to track down who had the rights to the Adventure Class 
Ships and the other ship plans they did way back when.  The rather terse 
and rude reply I received from FASA after waiting a week and a half stated 
that they had sold them "some time ago" and the person answering the e-mail 
had other things to do than track down who it was.

"Electronically Exploring the Traveller universe" with a sub title of "A

Miller.  The portion of the article that I want to refer to regards the
usefullness of standardizing data formats.  What I want to find out
about is the state of progress with this.

     The ability to access a public file format for characters,
subsectors and ships would make writing a ships maintainence program
much more straightforward.  This is a way for gamers to share their
creations (the characters, ships, maps, etc.) without worrying about
stepping on toes.

     If this has already been done then I would simply like a lead.  If
not, then what are your thoughts on such a project.  With FFE starting
to publish the T5 in November This data might be popular.

There have been several sonic AF cameras, the most successful being the
Polaroid SX-70 Sonar.  It could focus down to 1 foot, but the next step
after 12 feet was infinity.  Almost all point & shoot AF systems are IR at
this point.

It is the Collector Edition of classic Traveller that is being published
beginning this November, not T5.  The next version of real Traveller is in a
state of flux AFAIK.  I\'ve heard both M0 and M200 as being the initial
milieu, and I\'ve heard that the rules will be a fixed T4, but then I heard
that a totally new, generic system is in development.  Sounds like we need
an update from the horses mouth.  Trouble is that the horses hearing aid is
turned off :-p

Yes, but this was no wolf in sheep\'s clothing. Anybody who expected Hasbro\'s
acquisition of Avalon Hill to mean that Avalon Hill would be on the comeback
trail was deluded. Hasbro made its intentions very clear: computer games.

Actually, the amount of attacks on Barbie, G.I. Joe and so many other things
have little or no impact on the market. Why?

It\'s simple. How do you find out about these attacks? The media. How does
the media make money? Advertising. What\'s one of the largest advertising
markets in the United States? The toy market. Sure you hear people complain
every once in awhile, and the big toymakers usually stick to their guns.
When they don\'t, it\'s usually not a big deal. When G.I. Joe was attacked,
vocally, during the 80s, Hasbro didn\'t back down. It took decades for
Barbie\'s body shape to approach normalcy. The big companies shrug off bad
press because they run the press.

It sucks, but this could be *good* for WotC, AD&D, not bad.

>Who knows.  Hasbro bought AH mainly for the titles and ideas they

>the same idea with WOTC/TSR.


Doubtful. I\'m not sure about TSR\'s deal with Interplay, but I know that
Interplay is scheduled to do at least one or two more roleplaying games
based on TSR\'s properties. Hasbro *could* leave well enough alone and focus
on the tabletop aspects. It really could go either way. While big companies
frequently appear stupid, they don\'t get to be big by actually being stupid.

Here are the facts as they stand:

1.) Baldur\'s Gate was a breakaway hit, and it created a whole new market of
young roleplayers.

2.) As of the last report I\'ve seen, a relatively large budget Hollywood
movie based on the AD&D property is currently in filming on location in the
Czech Republic. Whatever studio has it may kill it at some point before it
hits theaters, but even an idiot marketing director knows that the words
"Dungeons & Dragons" together are known by the vast majority of people in
the United States. Don\'t expect Armageddon or Independence day, but do
expect that it will help to create a new market for RPGs. Personally,
there\'s one scene I really, really want to see, but I don\'t want to be a
spoiler.

3.) TSR is operating in the black. It\'s making money and Dungeons & Dragons
is still a household word. Those folks who were introduced to Dungeons &
Dragons between 73 & 84 (and there were alot of them) are now parents, and
in some cases, they\'re going to have children who hit the right age bracket
for the marketing of the game. In other words, there are parents out there
who know that AD&D doesn\'t turn kids into bloodthirsty killers and are
spending money on their own children.

Add up 1, 2 & 3 and you get the potential for big money. This took me maybe
5 minutes to think up. A company like Hasbro doesn\'t spend $300+ dollars in
just 5 minutes. I\'m sure they thought about this purchase for a long time
beforehand, and I\'m sure these facts were factored into their decision to
buy.

I\'ll cut the huge essay I wrote down to size, and simple say this: AD&D,
regardless of my personal beliefs, was always destined to be a household
name. TSR screwed up so many times, for so many reasons, I could write for
hours... and I would never even mention their problems with the growing
internet in the early-to-mid 90s. That was the last and least of their
problems. TSR hit the skids in the early-to-mid 80s, the sheer power of the
game they created was powerful enough to keep the company afloat... and
that\'s precisely the reason that it\'s still a marketable commodity.

The truth of the matter is that AD&D was always available in more markets
than any other roleplaying game. You could walk into a chain bookstore, a
hobby shop, or a comic book store and find it. When TSR was in "feast"
phase, the roleplaying industry ate well. When TSR was in "famine" phase,
the roleplaying industry starved.

I know somebody\'s going to point out that both Palladium and White Wolf were
able to feast during TSR\'s famine phase and increase their share in the
market. At what expense though? GDW and a host of other RPG companies were
forced to close their doors or cut down their lines.

>>It\'s telling that the founders of WOTC were willing to sell now...in

>
>Shoot, would *you* sneeze at 325 million bucks?


Besides, there\'s very little detail on the sale. There\'s no evidence that
the controlling factions of WotC are taking the money and running. I think
that people should give it time before assuming the worst.

If the worst does indeed happen, it\'s frankly highly unlikely that even a
quarter of us (the members of the TML) will be here talking about Traveller.
If AD&D collapses, the roleplaying market *will* go with it. Traveller is
not a household name. GURPS is not a household name. Hell, for all of its
popularity in our own gaming ghetto, Vampire is not a household name (at
least not in the roleplaying sense).

Dungeons & Dragons is, and that\'s precisely what makes it such a valuable
commodity, and that\'s precisely why it\'s important to our hobby. Now, there
are going to be those of you out there who are going to pretend to not be
phased by this and say, "Hey, even if roleplaying games disappear, I\'ll
still play Traveller." That\'s great. As for me, I like the possibility that
people like Wiseman, Miller, Thrash, Zeigler, et. al. can actually make a
little money doing what they enjoy as a hobby. I\'m happy that they turn out
things so that I don\'t have to and it is available for me to get my hands
on. I\'ll gladly buy their stuff and keep buying it, and I\'d like to have the
opportunity to keep on doing it.

Thank you for pointing out my error. I was thinking of classic
Traveller.
Any comment on the idea of open formats for Traveller data?

When doing deckplans for MT, how do you work out how many freshers, lounges,
rec areas are on a ship? Is it a case of half the space of staterooms are
allocated to actual quarters, and the other half consist of access
corridors, lounges, freshers, galleys and the like? What happens when you
have more people in a ship than you have \'paid for\' in terms of quarters. I
mean, if life support is based on hull volume, how can it be applicable to
how many quarters you have. 

Also, what\'s the deal with life support? Is it assumed that one floor decks
have all the relevant life-support crammed into .7 of a metre, leaving the
other 2.3 metres of space as actual walking about space (like how in a
modern office block we have false ceilings covering air conditioning and the
like).

And when allocating drives, what percentage is the actual equipment and what
is access space? 50/50? If you had less space devoted to access space (I
guess with a task DM for maintenance), could you use that reclaimed area for
other things such as crew lounges?
And finally, how do you allocate space for Bridges? I know HiGuard had 2% of
mass (min of 20 tons) which MT sort of replaced with numbers of controls,
but it seems they only take up a couple of kliters in entirty (- computers).

I am in your hands. Help me MT Tmlers, you\'re my only hope <FIZZ>

I don\'t own one. Matter of fact, for some strange reason, I don\'t *own*
any appliances with built-in controllers. On the other hand I have lots
of them hooked up to units my computer can control (X-10 interfaces).

Sort of. BTW, the only way a *current* coffe maker can try to kill you

No, the "0" at the start of "018th" is just a place holder that I use to

True, but there is no information on the reorganization that I am aware

What

The 1018th is the reserve fleet for Lanth.

All of the information for the fleet locations come from the two
following
locations, but both locations have the exact same information.

IRL, military ships don\'t bother with cosmetic things like false
ceilings/floors/bulkheads to cover up the wiring, piping, and duct work.
The exceptions to the lack of "finished" spaces are the
Captain\'s/XO\'s/Admiral\'s/VIP\'s cabins.

IMTU, most military ships conform to this model.  The cost saved could be
substantial for large ships.  I haven\'t worked the numbers out.  Maybe
someone on this list has?

Hope that helps...

I have a copy of the book, and I know the diagram you are referring to. It
is just there "for the purposes of illustration" - that is, it is a dummy
deckplan, just there to show you what the various symbols represent.

My favourite ship in the book, BTW, is the Vargr tradeboat. A hodgepodge
any true Vargr would be proud to own!

>When doing deckplans for MT, how do you work out how many freshers, lounges,
>rec areas are on a ship?

This is a "to taste" part of deckplan work. I tend toward shared freshers in 
some situations, but most of my ships assume that a 1x1m (or less) fresher is 
part of most rooms, and always part of a full-sized stateroom. Rec areas and 
lounges are a metter of what you can squeeze out between rooms.

>Is it a case of half the space of staterooms are

>corridors, lounges, freshers, galleys and the like?

 This is the easiest way to do it. Don\'t let corridors worry you too much, 
but galley space, lounges, and rec areas will often come out of stateroom 
space.

>What happens when you
>have more people in a ship than you have \'paid for\' in terms of quarters. I
>mean, if life support is based on hull volume, how can it be applicable to
>how many quarters you have. 

There are several costs involved with "Life Support." The per trip cost of 
ship operations is based on the designed occupancy of the ship, and is based 
on the number of installed staterooms. There have been many, bloody arguments 
on this topic here (though most of the current TMLers may not remember them), 
but the upshot is that this a people-based cost.
  Then there are the design costs of installed long-term life-support. These 
are the number you deal with during design of a starship, and are based on 
the volume of the ship. (An old Rob Dean MT trick is to NOT buy life support 
for the fuel tankage; it received semi-conscious approval from DGP and GDW, 
but I consider it cheating...)  These costs don\'t care about crew size; they 
are all about heating/cooling, recharging atmospheric oxygen, lights, etc.
  If you have a sudden, and hopefully temporary, overflow of people onboard 
you have two choices as Captain: pay the per-trip costs for each actual 
person, allowing them to exist  somewhat above abject misery; or pay the 
usual per-stateroom cost and pray these people aren\'t onboard for more than 
one jump, since hunger and sanitation will become issues very quickly...


>Also, what\'s the deal with life support? Is it assumed that one floor decks

Yup. Assuming that Life Support hardware exists between decks is the easy way 
to get everything else to fit inside the hullspace you\'ve designed. If you\'re 
the sort who likes a visible sign then put in a closet marked life support...

>And when allocating drives, what percentage is the actual equipment and what

 You can pack the Gunner\'s Mates, Bosuns, and Middies in like sardines, but 
if you crowd the engineers, that ship ain\'t comin back.
 I\'ve assumed that a drive takes the requisite listed volume, but that it 
isn\'t necessarily all solid hardware. You can pack the engines together or 
space them out depending on how the rest of the ship looks for space (yes. It 
IS that simple).

MT used the control panel model, but don\'t forget that MT also introduced 
sensors and communications, life support, and a handfull of other 
complications. You will find that old 20 tons of handwave does get accounted 
for, just not in one easy spot...
 TNE (and T4) finished the thought by actually defining workstations for 
crew, but you sound like you are sticking with HG...

  AFAIK, a Pentax 100mm macro runs something like $300 US; a Tamron 90mm

you can probably find used lenses that say "macro" on them for awfully low

According to MM Fusion+ should have been exactly that (simply a reduction
of min size by a factor of 10). However due to Greg Porter\'s interpretation in
CSC it got changed to the abomination in FFS2. I\'d say make the min size
at TL12 1m3, or use fusion+ as written.

  If you re-do the AHL type at TL F you can pick up the performance nicely.
More interestingly, a 5G FI could probably be built relying on missile bays
and sub-units rather than a spinal mount - you lose mission duration to
fungible usage, but at least you\'re more likely to come back successful :)

  Right off, I\'m not sure that I buy the theory that the lack of AD&D means
that all other RPG\'s will run out of players (now, the stores themselves &
distributors having serious problems I can see, however).

  Perhaps more importantly, you don\'t mention the real possibility that 
the collapse of AD&D/TSR might see the return of the anti-christ^h^h, urm,
that is GW*, to the RPG field. And _they_ have lots of everything that it 
seems to take, and what little else they can probably rent or fake.

I hit the reply button on Eudora - I got your name, not the list.

=============================

Could goldinc be persuaded to add the [ISBA] bit?
Alternatively could ISBA posters do this, please?

=============================

I have looked at http://thuddd.homepage.com/format.html

A few thoughts:

Firstly I *hate* that triple column data block format!

I know it comes from T4 standards but:

(a) I find it very untidy and cluttered - I do like things in neat columns,
(b) I find formatting the columns a pain - all those spaces over to the
    second and third columm labels, then someone tries tabs or proportional
    fonts and it all falls apart.
    IMO, it works in a spreadsheet. It could would on a website if
    you use a table (but that would probably ruin your hopes for automation)
    It doesn\'t work in email.
(c) As soon as someone does something "different" it falls apart.
    eg I want to know that the Jump drive has a backup on the jump line,
       not at the bottom of the page.
    eg what if I have lots of dirrerent sensors.
    eg what if my "Maneuver" is 1G of contra grav, 3G of thrusters
       and a 6G HEPlaR booster?
=============================

Speaking of sensors: the format you have used looks like TNE (FF&S1).
T4 sensors are itemised, not just a suite, so you need more space.
Actually, the whole thing looks FF&S, not FF&S2.

=============================

	Fusion Power Plant (2x750 Mw)

shouldn\'t this be:

	Power Plant (2x750 Mw Fusion)

=============================

I don\'t like having lots of zeroes and spaces. In M0, my ships
won\'t have a black globe, most won\'t have a meson screen, I don\'t
recall *any* spaceships beinmg designed with electrostatic armour.
I like being able to remove those rows from the format - which you can\'t
do with a table.

=============================

	Sandcaster(s):

Lose the parenthesis! I can accept "Sandcaster" when there are several,
"Sandcatsers" when there is only one or even letting the designer add
the "s" as required, but not this.

=============================

	Passengers: 1,000/2,000/4,000 (1,000)

What is this?

Especially that bit in parenthesis.

I personally dislike the Traveller "meaningless strings of numbers"
style (eg USP) As it makes it hard for people who don\'t totally buy
into the current version to see what is going on.

What is wrong with:

Passengers: High   1,000 (1,000 large staterooms)
            Medium 2,000 (1,000 small staterooms, 500 large staterooms)
            Low    4,000 (3,000 low berths, 1,000 bunks)
or:

	<h4>Passengers</h4>
	<pre>
	High   1,000 (1,000 large staterooms)
	Medium 2,000 (1,000 small staterooms, 500 large staterooms)
	Low    4,000 (3,000 low berths, 1,000 bunks)
	</pre>

=============================

	Crew Detail: Command/400 Maneuver...

At first I thought you had 400 Maneuver crew.
Perhaps:
	Crew Detail: Command 400, Maneuver...
or even:
	<h4>Crew Detail</h4>
	<pre>
	Command   400
	Maneuver  200
	...
	</pre>
:-)

Presumably he does not, but this is a rather limited set of criteria.

anyone else still writing]  In her second most recent book,

Sometimes the players hate the solution, e.g. captured by a TED (sorry I
play TNE)

Like most refs I have modified the rules IMTU, this combined with the fact
that any mention of a rule mechanism that isn\'t absolutely necessary makes
the difficulty 1 step harder, helps keep any tendency to debate my decisions
to a minimum.  However I tend to emphasise ROLEplaying.

The mechanism I use is that the players tell me what they want to do (with
no mention of rules) and I tell them what skills/attributes to roll against,
unless they have tried to work out in advance how difficult the task was
they only learn the result of their attempt, not the die roll necessary.

This can be fun!! especially in combat in 1 session the players spent about
half an hour pinned down by an unconscious sniper who had been knocked out
by an incredibly lucky ricochet mid way through the combat.

The writers of the (superb) BBC sitcom "Porridge" invented the word naff for
this purpose, with a range of variations (eg naffing hell!) and it subsequently
entered the language as an adjective, basically as an alternative to crap.
Though Princess Anne once got into trouble for telling a bunch of reporters to
naff off, assuming it was reported correctly.

Chris, I would be _very_ interested in any Traveller software for Palm.

I am a long-time Psion user who has just gone over to the Dark Side
(as my Psion-using friends put it) and I\'m currently running the portable
version of my Trav campaign off a Palm IIIx, with charsheets held as memos,
campaign files held in RichReader [text] or ImageViewer [maps and
deckplans], and
the RollEm dice roller for, errm, well, you know.

This works fine, and I ran several whole games this summer with just the
Palm
and the character sheets [until my players get with the program I can\'t beam
them
their charsheets, have to print paper ones].

Fast forward into the future!

Also, Acquire at least is being reprinted, since there\'s a picture of it

They also bought Microprose. I think a similar strategy informs the purchase of
WOTC. The best thing to come out of this is if there is an update to the MTG
computer game, in my opinion.

LARPing doesn\'t work for the gamers out there like myself, who are

I was going by what I\'d noticed on cheap cameras a few years back. I\'ve
got an ultrasonic tape measure, and it\'s good to at least 30 feet. It
uses a multi-frequency "chirp" as a ranging pulse, so it can compensate
for temp & humdity within reasonable ranges.

It is reported that Hasbro intends to keep the existing WotC management in
place. If WotC produces a satisfactory bottom line for Hasbro, they probably
won\'t mess with it too much.

For the first time in many years, New Stuff is being released regarding
the Orion Project (Nuclear Pulse propulsion). And strangely, there are
multiple projects... all began separately, but have, of course, had some
cross talk between them.

1) A book about Orion, very heavily researched, is in the works. Being
written by George Dyson (name sound familiar? Try thinking of his
father, Freeman), it is to be released in 2001 or so. Focusses on the
people and story.

2) A one-hour documentary is scheduled to be aired on the History
Channel on October 31. Expect to see previously unseen testing footage
(I\'ve seen some... quite impressive, even in slo-mo!)

3) And, of course, Aerospace projects Review is doing an extensive
series of articles on Orion. The first major article, describing the
10-meter NASA design in considerable technical detail is NOW AVAILABLE.
This has 20 pages and many illustrations (far better than any I\'ve seen
published elsewhere). This can be found at:
http://www.webcreations.com/ptm/apr/apr.htm

All of these projects are worthwhile for those interested in Orion (I
should know, I\'m responsible for #3). Considerable efforts have been
made on the parts of all involved to obtain and declassifiy previously
classified data/drawings/films. So, finally, everyone with an interest
in Orion or advanced space propulsion can finally get good data with
which to debate and argue over, rather than arguing using the extremely
vague data that has been available previously.

Said movie is being directed by none other than Toronto-born "Corey Solomon".
From the August 2nd Toronto Star... Yes boiys and girls, the man who single
handedly cut off one of Traveller\'s legs (it\'s only a flesh wound!)as the man
behind Imperium Games is actually directing the D&D movie. And apparently it
really is staring Jeremy Irons and some other semi-famous B-list type people.

The closest to a standard format is the de-facto Genie sector data format,
since that\'s what the available online sectors have been in. Even that\'s not
in universal use, though Galactic and (IIRC, World Builder Deluxe) can import
them. I had to kludge a program together to massage the Genie sectors into
usable format for the ancient subsector mapper I have. 

IMO, there\'s too much variation in what people do and want to do with this
kind of data for a uniform data descriptor. Even completely OOP\'sed, you still
end up with a Player object overridden for each of seventeen different
formats. We just had a similar discussion regarding sectore and subsector data
formats a while back.

There are basic ones like the UWP and UPP, but even those vary with the
addition of Gurps...

Of course, if someone wnats to go define a bunch of XML tags for Traveller
data, _when_ we get usable XML browsers and such toys, things could be
different, but you still end up with with a player character definition being
50k long to cover all the variants...

There\'s very little information, but there is some. It comes from _Spinward

Fleet		Location in 1107

1st		Lanth.
23rd		Vilis.
100th		Inactive.
125th		Jewell.

Not according to any canonical information that I know of. AFAIK there is
no canonical information about the numbers of specific subsector fleets.
And unless the Imperium changes the number of a subsector fleet when the
subsector gets a new regular fleet assigned, the odds that the two fleet
numbers would correspond are not good.

John Banagan is not a recognized canonical source. (Though he seems to
have done a fairly good job of extrapolation). I must admit that the other
site looks awe-inspiringly official. But is it? Is it Marc Miller\'s own
official website? If so, I must bow to his greater authority (while still
maintaining that he may have failed to think all the implications fully
through).

No, because the 18th was stationed elsewhere at the time, since the 1st was
stationed in Lanth.

That\'s also available under Win95/98/NT. That, imo, is the best possible
monitor tweak available: crank up the resolution, and make the fonts larger.
For instance, at 800x600 Large Fonts you have about the same amount of screen
real estate as 640x480 when using it, because windows and suchlike increase in
size with the increased font size, but every letters made up of more pixels.
More Pixels = better legibility.

I have a 19" monitor at work (nya nya!) running at 1600x1200 (or whatever it
is) with large fonts enabled at 85 hz refresh, millions of colors. Very sharp!
I can (and do) stare at theat puppy all day long, never a headache. Takes a
good video card though (I have an ATI Rage somethingorother) with a pile of
memory on it.

Also, for some reason, even with \'optimal refresh rate\' selected, Windows
tends to run monitors at 60 hz. Most modern monitors and graphics cards can
support 75,85, or even 95 hz refresh rates. The higher the refresh rate the
steadier the image. This is happens in particular when Win95 decided your
monitor is a \'Plug and Play\' one. I\'ve always gotten better results by getting
the actual .inf files from the manufacturers to tell Windows exactly what kind
of monitor it is.

Finally, as I tell all the people who come into our office with "What kind of
computer should I buy?", spend more on your monitor than you think you should;
I even tell them to scrimp on hard drive space or processor speed to get the
best monitor they can afford. Best = lowest dot pitch, highest refresh rates,
flattest screen, highest resolutions supported. A $700 19" monitor is almost
always better than a $400 one. Most of the cheap monitors I\'ve seen are nice
and sharp in the middle but horrible around the edges when run at anything
higher than about 800x600.

If the dealer offers two prices for a monitor of a given size buy the more
expensive one. That is, after all, the thing you stare at the whole time you
use the computer.

But people vary widely in their ability to deal with insane resolution on tiny
monitors. There\'s someone like Leonard in our office, only worse, he\'ll run
1280x1024 _small_ fonts on a 17" monitor. I can work for about 5 seconds on
his system before running away screaming and tearing my eyes out. I think
he\'ll be blind before he\'s 35. ;-)

Here is a redesign of my GT space missle, mainly from comments from others (thank you 
very much). This missile is intended to be a autonomous weapon system, requiring little 
or no input (other than long range sensor data) from its parent.

One person mentioned that the Imperial Rules of War forbid nukes, and that these 
missiles don\'t fit into standard tubes. What I had negleted to mention is that these 
weapons (including the laser I designed earlier) are not from the Imperium - but 
another interstellar government in my campaign called the Taneis Covenant - which lies 
in the Leonidae sector between the Imperium and the Two Thousand Worlds. Thus, the 
Rules of War are irrelevant (unles the Covenant sends military vessels into the 
Imperium, which normally would not happen) and the missile size is largely irrelevant. 
For the record, in the Covenant missiles are military-only weapons - civilian ships 
cannot mount any missile (nuclear or otherwise).

Also, it should be noted that the Covenant is nominally TL 10 in its military sectors, 
except for technologies dealing with robotics, which are at TL 12. Robotic technologies 
include robot brains, power cells (but not power plants), manipulators, and sensors for 
robots. The only systems affected here are the brain and the power cells.

Your comments, as always, are encouraged...


NTW-17 Space Missile (TL 10 except for Brain and Power, which is TL 12 )

Propulsion: 11,300lbs vectored thruster (847lbs, 16.95cf, 
  Cr16,950, 565kW).
Armament: 30mm .1 kiloton micronuke (0.108lbs, .0022cf, Cr15,003).
Communications: Laser communicator, very long range, recieve-only
  (50lbs, 1cf, Cr625, .1kW, 1,000,000mi range).
Sensors and navigation: 1200 mile PESA ( 120lbs, 2.4cf, Cr480,000),
  Navigation sensors ( 20lbs, 0.4cf, Cr1,000).
Computer: TL 12 Hardened genius robot brain small computer (1.5 lbs, 
  .03cf, Cr25,000, complexity 7).
Power: TL 12 Rechargable power cell stores 10,753,046kWS (301.08lbs, 3.0cf, 
  Cr30,109),  good for four hours of operation.
Body: 24cf (including .20cf empty space). Area 50cf. Medium frame,
  very expensive materials, robotic (50lbs, Cr50,000, 75 Hit Points).
Armor: PD 4, DR 40 advanced metal (120lbs, Cr2,400).
Surface Features: Radical Stealth and Radical Emission Cloaking (100lbs, 
  Cr75,000).
Statistics: Volume 24cf, Weight 1,610.19lbs. Mass: 0.8 tons. Price:
  Cr696,087. HT: 12 (75 Hit Points). Size Modifier: +0. Space 
  Acceleration: 7 G (for four hours).

Differences between this missile and the standard imperial weapon
include speed (7G), endurance (4hrs), sensors (PESA and navigation),
smarter brain, streamlining (none) and warhead (micronuke). It is, 
obviously, larger as well.

The launcher\'s GT stats:

1 Space, 15.42 tons, MCr.03. Note that this launcher does not have
anti-blast ammo bin (for the 17 missiles carried) becuase the
warheads are not explosive (being laser triggered).

GT Ammo space:

1 Space, 16.1 tons, holds 20 missiles.

Isn\'t their RPG currently being published by Hogshead Games?  They would be
a logical candidate for anything new, but their quality has been steadily
going down hill since at least \'92.

I\'m no longer that up on the RPG market, what major players are left besides
Steve Jackson Games?  I assume White Wolf is still around, and I know Dream
Pod 9 is (though they\'re pretty small).  What about R.Talsorian, or whoever
owns Champions?  For all that goes, which games are still in print?  Here
are the ones I\'m aware of:

	GURPS
	AD&D
	Heavy Gear
	Empire of the Petal Throne (yes, it really is)
	Call of Cthulu

I\'m sure there are others, but around here it\'s pretty slim pickings, and
I\'ve got to arrange with my FLGS to order anything I want.

For that matter, how many of the "Grognard" companies are left?

    'body' => 'Fellow Travellers,

Shortly after entering the Spinward Marches, I came across a
great deal of money, related to a sale of a certain ship whose
technology cannot easily be assessed.  So I spent the cash, of
course!

I ordered a custom frontier cruiser built on Mire, in the Darrian
Group.  It is outfit to run sizeable cargo jobs and can carry luxury
passengers.  It is also equipped to hold dozens of people in low
berths, and so can function as a troop transport.  It also has a
number of tiny labs, supporting a number of research disciplines,
and has adequate defenses to be a charter vessel for study in
non-safe subsectors.  And, of course, it comes with two 10-ton
launches and a 20-ton launch.  I\'ll probably christen it the "Jack of
all Trades" since that is sort of what it is.  We have GURPS
deckplans and stats if anyone\'s interested.

Anyway, we\'ve got this ship, but there\'s no power plant.  That is,
each component is priced and sized to take power generation into
account; however, we\'ve reasoned that all these considerations
still add up to one power plant somewhere in the ship.  Well, how
big is it?  Does it matter how large it is?  And where would you
place your power plant?

Thanks all,

    'body' => 'How I get rid of bad players is very simple:  I frustrate them.  If they
are making everyone else miserable, they suddenly have an incredible run
of bad luck.  Often in the areas of their character\'s life which are
causing the problem.  

We once had a player whose character liked to rape the NPCs (the player
was female, go figure!) and so this character ran into a succubus in a
French maid outfit (he raped her and lost Con points and levels), then the
apprentice of a very powerful High Priest (who quested him).  This second
rape was done in concert with my then partner\'s character, who wiped the
girl\'s memory of himself and left her with memories of this PC.  She
blubbered "But we\'re evil, we\'re supposed to stick together, how could you
pin it on me???"

He just looked at her in disbelief and said "Evil means not trustworthy.
And anyhow, I\'m lawful and you\'re chaotic."

Finally her chara found a c*ck ring that when tested for magick increased
one\'s Con for sex purposes, he put it on and then it wouldn\'t come off and
later he found out that he should have let the techno check it because his
c*ck turned black and fell off due to the radiation in it.

Finally the player came to me and said "you are picking on me, aren\'t
you?"

And I nodded and said:  "We have other players in this game who may have
been raped themselves or whose girlfriends were raped, and they\'re not
amused by your shenanigans."

She said "But I\'m Chaotic Evil!"

I said "You appear to be \'chaotic stupid\'.  I am all for roleplaying your
character appropriately but you must consider that I have allowed
alignment mixes with the understanding that we are all here to have fun.
A little bit of harmless backbiting and backstabbing is OK and people of
all moral levels get together to do jobs in real life, but that\'s when you
should be working on subversion rather than outright attacking the group
and its potential allies."

She sniffled a bit and said "But rape is chaotic evil!"

I said, "yes, it can be, but there are other ways to be chaotic evil and I
run this game for everyone to have fun, including me.  It\'s not fun for me
or anyone else to be forced to witness or create your sex fantasy."

She quit the game and said I wouldn\'t let her have any fun.  It was all
the same to me whether she quit or behaved-- she got the point that I
don\'t like rape scenarios and resent being forced to run them.

We managed to remain friends.  She found a chaotic evil campaign that
would let her do as she pleased and the rest of us went back to having our
own kind of fun.

Well there\'s all kinds of success...   I\'ve found three husbands so far

Building on the Hall, Bar, Conference module, I have reduced the 
number of people supported to 40 and added a Transparent 
Aluminum bubble over the volume (500 sf) and a Vehicle Bay 
Hangar Door (supporting 10 dTons).  I used Medium frame strength 
and Advanced Materials for the bubble.  If you have transparent 
aluminum, then I bet that would be considered Advanced :)  (Please 
don\'t lecture me about Advanced Materials being a "bad" thing in 
GT.  I don\'t want to get into that argument)

I picture this module as sitting on some superstructure and the 
hangar door opens like a clamshell with the sealed HBCRoom 
located in it.

Open Air Hall, Bar, Conference Room Description:
Retractable hangar door with transparent aluminum shell allowing up 
to 40 occupants to view the outside while engaged in activities 
identical to those found in the standard module.  If the ship is 
sealed then consider the bubble sealed, also.  There is 750 cf of 
additional access space set aside for walkways around the edge 
allowing occupants an unobstructred view.  A ship so equipped 
could reasonably hover in atmosphere (during calm conditions) and 
open the hangar door and remove the bubble allowing a truly open 
air experience.

Breakdown:

Vehicle Bay "Door" 1000 lbs, $3000, 250 cf
Bubble 375 lbs, $250000, 0 cf
Rx Slice 0.08 lbs, $4, 0.0048 cf, 0.4 kW
HBCRoom 320 lbs, $2000, 4000 cf, 0.4 kW

Totals:

Mass 0.85 sTons
Volume 10 dTons (10 spaces)
Cost 0.255 MCr.

Up to 6 Roomy Passenger Seats may be added for an additional 40 
lbs, 120 cf (give them Bridge Access Space to allow movement) 
and $100 each.

The bubble is not armored, so during combat situations the hangar 
door should be closed.

I have a vague recollection of an article in White Dwarf about photographing
miniatures in extreme closeup. The article recommended making a simple
pinhole camera and gave instructions on how to make one. Seemed like
there was some tips on lighting and backgrounds, enough to get one started
as a mini photographer.

This would have been in a WD issue in the double digits, from the late 80s.
I may still have it, I\'ll have a look this weekend.

That\'s <spit> _Courtney_ Solomon <spit>, and the whole reason they
bought the rights to Traveller in the first place was to make a movie
out of it; they\'ve owned the movie rights to D&D for a long time.

    'body' => 'Hi all

Among my many exciting (hah) real-life characters, I am an avid GI Joe
collector, a Hasbro stockholder, and a sometimes toy business news writer.
The WotC purchase is an interesting move for Hasbro, but not terribly
surprising for them.  Having seen toy sales overall lose some strength in
the face of video and computer games, Hasbro is working very hard to
diversify and have a major role in what they see as a new major growth
market.  One of their first steps was to buy Microprose Software, and then
later Avalon Hill, with the idea of leveraging Avalon Hill ideas and the
Microprose name to break into software (the earlier Hasbro Interactive
titles had been less than successful).

Hasbro also decided to corner the Star Wars market and bought up almost
every company that had a Star Wars license.  Most of these were retained as
wholly-owned brand names, like Galoob (the Micro Machines folks).

Hasbro has licensed out Avalon Hill\'s best selling game, the Squad Leader
series, to a company headed by a major league pitcher whose name suddenly
escapes me.  They have also announced their intention to re-introduce about
a dozen of the best Avalon Hill wargame titles, probably in the year 2000,
and these will possibly be distributed through their normal game channels.
That means we might see Panzer Blitz at TRU once again.

As for WotC, the initial Hasbro announcement said that WotC would continue
as a wholly-owned subsidiary, managed by most of the same people currently
managing WotC.  This might change, especially since some of this management
are now ridiculously wealthy and may not be all that interested in being
employees of Hasbro.  But I would suspect that Hasbro will either leave
WotC alone and reap the profits, or it will license out the RPG properties
to a new company (possibly headed by the aforementioned WotC management).

Effects on the gaming world in general?  It is possible that Hasbro will
open their distribution channels to WotC, which menas you might see an
increased presence of RPGs in mainstream toy stores and large retail
chains.  This can only be a good thing for the rest of the RPG world, since
AD&D has always been the enabler game that brings new blood into the RPG
world.  I doubt that Hasbro will \'soften\' D&D if WotC is maintained as a
subsidiary, but I imagine it is possible.

Perhaps in Christmas 2000 we will see a Paladin, Orc and Ranger GI Joe!

Think of how many Traveller books one could buy, even overpaying for out of
print books! And a shelf to keep \'em, with a built in ladder! Shucks, a
Gaming Hall fully computerized, for that matter.

This is good news, then, better than my cynical and pessimistic

Well, I\'m 44. And I suspect that the fact the screen is 20 inches from

I wonder if they\'ll update the computer version? I\'ve got both the
TRS-80 version and the IBM PC version. Both have the nasty habit of
requiring you to reboot to get out of the game. Of course with OS/2, I
can just set the PC version up as a VDM and close the window. :-)

They were notable for being able to do *some "computer vs user" play. I
used them in a PBM Diplomacy game just to make sure I didn\'t overlook
any "obvious" moves. I\'d enter the current positions and year/season.
Then I\'d enter my move and tell the computer it was playing everyone
else. A couple of times that kept me from making *incredibly* silly
mistakes (Oh hell, I forget he could do *that*).

While the article in the Wall Street Journal and the various research notes

I wonder if they\'ll update the computer version? I\'ve got both the

requiring you to reboot to get out of the game. Of course with OS/2, I
can just set the PC version up as a VDM and close the window. :-)

They were notable for being able to do *some "computer vs user" play. I
used them in a PBM Diplomacy game just to make sure I didn\'t overlook
any "obvious" moves. I\'d enter the current positions and year/season.
Then I\'d enter my move and tell the computer it was playing everyone
else. A couple of times that kept me from making *incredibly* silly
mistakes (Oh hell, I forget he could do *that*).

Actually, aboard submarines (probably the best rl model for starships) the
situation is almost but not quite like this.  Pipes and conduits do wind
around overhead, under the ceiling but above head level, but the walls
tend to be mostly smooth metal access plates, covering electrical gear and
other stuff underneath.  All such plates are prominently and colorfully
labeled as to the function of what they cover.

The idea is that exposed equipment invites accidental damage, ranging from
just snagging on your sleeve while sprinting down a passageway up to
spilling your coffee into a power bus.  But all the equipment needs to be
very easily found and accessed for emergency repairs during battle or
other extreme conditions, so the equipment isn\'t hard to reach or
disguised like in an office building.

So my mental picture of a passageway aboard a military ship -- or off
passenger decks aboard many civilian ships -- is a somewhat narrow tunnel,
brightly lit, with pipes and cable ducts snaking around up in the shadows
behind the lights, lots of neutral-gray boxes and cabinets making up the
walls, most with ventillation ducts, and all bearing large, bright,
colorful labels.  A few would have simple display panels on the front of
the access plate, usually just a few green/yellow/red status telltales or
a single numeric readout.  Hanging from the wall at one end or another one
would probably find a maintenance log, either a clipboard with lots of
dog-eared paper or a computer slate tied into the ship\'s computer.  You
might also find a basic tool kit, first aid kit, and flashlight clipped to
the wall.

I don\'t think the cost differential is all that great, it\'s more of a
maintenance issue.  It would be interesting to introduce a design tradeoff
between \'prettiness\' of internal spaces and maintenance cost/difficulty; 
for example, you have to declare during design that a ship will be
suitable for carrying high passengers, and this increases the difficulty
and time for maintenance tasks one level.

In 1986 there was a publication by the name of Security Leak Newsletter and
/ or Security Leak Magazine in 1987.  I am unsure how many issues were
published because my records end in January 1988 with magazine issue #3.
The address of the publisher was:

Gregg Giles
4200 Park Place #217
Tyler, TX  75703

BTW, for those of you who remember this stuff, my reference is the Traveller
Data Base Project (TDB) of Ed Edwards, et al.  Do any of you have any of the
parts and pieces from this project?  I have a good chunk and am working on
updates and revisions, but there are several hefty chunks missing.  I\'ll
post some notes on Downport.com about my progress in the near future.

He doesn\'t have a job, has been a perpetual student the whole of the 9
years I\'ve known him, and even back then held a MS in ClinPsych (He\'s
working on a BA in CompSci now). He doesn\'t beat her, but the emotional
bludgeons are there... bad enough that we have to keep them apart while
gaming so she can play her character, rather than he telling her what to do.

I simply told him "Mike, due to numerous complaints from those who don\'t
live with you, when we switch systems, I\'m dropping you from the group." He
didn\'t argue. Also, by giving him a few weeks, he can finish out the story.
Since of the group, there are only three households of 7 players...
House 1: Me, My Wife, our Roomate Ben
House 2: Mike, his wife, their roomate*
House 3: Peter Newman

* Who is how I met Mike anyway... and how mike wound up back in my
group.... as a personal favor. A year an a half later, the stress levels
got too high... as did mikes die rolls.

Nope, in the article in the Star, it\'s _Corey_. Strange but true.
There\'s no mention of Imperium Games, but how many Corey/Courtney
Solomons can their be in the world (who own the rights to the D&D 
movie to boot).

Sorry there, didn\'t mean to offend.  I /would/ argue that it depends on what
kind of LARPing you do, the physical hoopla versus the more intelectual
political backstabbing kind of thing.  But it\'s more a suspicion of a trend
I\'m making comment on.  Like lots of RPGers now revile CCGers, I think that
we may be one of the last generations of table-top roleplayers.  I think
that things are going to split up between the playing and the mechanics,
LARPs and CCGs, with what we consider RPGs having only the online variant
surving.  Big buyouts and fallouts like these only fuel the fires as we seem
to be having more and more eggs in one basket.  There\'ll aways be holdouts,
and it\'s only a suspicion, and I\'m sorry Douglas.

I think there\'s a very strong argument for it. The vast majority of
roleplayers that I\'ve run into first get into roleplaying via AD&D. It is
the only roleplaying game that is a household name, and it is the one that
seems to generate the most new players.

Will Traveller run out of players? Frankly, who care? I suspect Keven,
Leonard, Eris and the rest will continue to play for a long time. However,
if AD&D is gone, the whole ship goes down.

Because it\'s not a real possibility, at least not in the U.S. at this time.
The high cost and immense time requirements involved in GW\'s miniatures
games turns alot of people off. The punk-orc / elf sensibility doesn\'t seem
to have a real appeal with an audience the size of AD&D.

I\'m not going to rule it out completely, but for what it\'s worth, GW\'s bid
to be a major player in the American retail outlet wasn\'t really a success.

The major players are:

TSR - AD&D, excellent showing with Alternity both are available in chain
bookstores. The AD&D worlds are enjoying a good deal of popularity,
Planescape is going quite strong, the Forgotten Realms is solid, and the
revamped Greyhawk line has shown to be surprisingly popular, especially
among older players. Hell, the ad campaign for the new Greyhawk line
specifically mentioned that demons and devils would be called... demons and
devils.

White Wolf - The Storyteller System, Vampire at the lead, then Werewolf,
then Mage... Trinity has had a decent showing thus far. With the waning
popularity of the hip angsty goth styles, their position is somewhat
precarious these days, though the sheer inertia of current players should
keep them high on the list. Both are available in chain bookstores. Vampire
and Trinity most available in chain bookstores, Werewolf frequently
available as well.

Palladium - Rifts is surprisingly popular, for how little it\'s talked about.
You can actually buy some Palladium stuff in mall chain bookstores around
here, although in my daily life I have yet to run into somebody who actually
plays it.

Steve Jackson Games - GURPS, a relatively popular system, but it still comes
in fifth. I\'m not sure of the exact order of games that come in before it. I
know AD&D is at the top, and Vampire is second.

Dream Pod 9 - Heavy Gear and others, these guys have made a name for
themselves and have really made great leaps and bounds toward stealing the
mecha crown (and crowd) from FASA.

Last Unicorn Games - Star Trek series, excellent distribution deal and
existing fan base have made this one something of a winner so far. Available
in chain bookstores, usually right near the Star Trek novels. So far they
seem to be working closely with Paramount in all phases of production,
producing a slick, playable and easy to learn game.

Deadlands has had a surprising amount of popularity, but it seems like alot
of the hype is dying down, although the bizarre and engrossing setting and
innovative rules may earn it a solid fan base.

Chaosium - Call of Cthulhu, as long as there are RPGs, there\'s always going
to be a niche for this game, and the recent X-Files inspired Delta Green
crossover (not actually done by Chaosium, if I remember correctly) has made
some waves.

>I\'m sure there are others, but around here it\'s pretty slim pickings, and

The funny thing is, it\'s not really all that bad a time for RPGs. For the
most part, RPGs are slicker and more professional looking than ever, which
helps to get them into markets that would be unreceptive otherwise. There
are more RPGs in chain bookstores now than there ever were before, which is
a pretty good sign.

>For that matter, how many of the "Grognard" companies are left?


Not too many, or at least not too many that are major players anymore.

there is canonical assignment of imperial fleet numbers by subsector. At

yes, along with a few bits and pieces of their own, HHP is doing a nice
job. As nice as GW-UK will let them.

Cool, a toy business news writer? I\'d kill for that one! ;)

A friend of mine is an avid Joe collector, which is why I spoke so highly of
them. They\'re very loyal to their fans.

Which part of the story?

There\'s a company called Sweetpea Entertainment, and they were slated to
film a movie based on the Dungeons and Dragons property. A subsidiary
company (if that\'s the right term), Imperium Games, was licensed to do T4.
They really seemed to have little interest in the line, frequently rushing
books to print and letting some amazingly bad errors through.

Sweetpea Entertainment is a movie company. They work in celluloid for
mass-market audiences, not paper and ink for niche markets, as a result of
their lack of experience, ability and heart, the project flopped.

Heh! Heh! Heh! Welcome to the Dark Side... Well, actually, welcome to the

Chivalry & Sorcery is still around. It\'s coming up for edition 3.1 after 
problems with the publisher of 3rd edition. The original authors don\'t 
have full control of the copyrights, and the old publisher went belly 
up, etc, etc (sound familiar?). However they\'ve found a new publisher 
and a new, improved version is being written, and new stuff is being 
published, so it\'s atill alive.

I think the various Palladium rogs are still alive, too.

No _formal_ standard (a la NBS/ISO) has, to my knowledge, ever
been promulgated - but, at least for stellar data, there are two
_de_facto_ standards that seem to be established - and from what
I can recall of one of them, they\'re very close to being
compatible with each other from off the mark.  Look at the data
files that come with Jim Vassilakos\'s GALACTIC program, and also
at the old Sunbane sector archives.  There\'s a link to GALACTIC
in the Freelance Traveller (http://come.to/FreelanceTraveller or
http://www.downport.com/freelancetraveller/Default.htm) Computer
Connection in the Information Center - look for programs for
MS-DOS systems.  I can\'t help you with the Sunbane data; I\'m not
sure of where it is, myself.

I like the idea of a standard data format for each type of data,
for the reasons you give - but I question whether one can
successfully promulgate one by fiat. I suspect that what needs to
happen is that some program - or program suite - that is widely
available becomes popular for manipulating the necessary data,
thus establishing _its_ data file format as the de facto
standard. If, however, people want to get into a \'standards
committee\' type of mode, I\'ll gladly participate and give my
input.

I can remember a guy that always tossed the dice 1 or 2 feet up with a
backwards spin. 9 times out of 10 it landed in his lap, in the potato chips,
or forever lost in the cushions of the couch...

Y\'know, I first read the line about pop-o-hedrals, and chuckled.
Then, I thought about it for a second. It\'s actually an
interesting idea. The only problem, conceptually, is that you\'d
need to pop quite a few times if there\'s only one die in a popper
- - or, if they came with varying numbers of dice in them, you\'d
need to have a lot of poppers. (With the multiple-poppers route,
I\'d probably go with 1, 2, 4, and maybe 8d poppers, for each
shape. Those 4 and 8d poppers are gonna be big suckers, though.)

    Couple of things might keep D&D afloat, at least for  awhile:
    1) Wizards has actually made their RPG deivison run a profit.
    2) It seems that hasbro is keeping WOTC intact as a division with current 
management, since it is profitable and no use tinkering with profit.
    3) D&D3 is in the works, timed to come out at the same time as the Lord

It would seem silly to drop the game with those fortuititous promotional

I thought it interesting that FASA didn\'t make your list, but I guess that
just depends on the \'major\' criteria.  Still, FASA\'s Shadowrun is still in
production and widely available.

I would also like to offer up Holistic\'s Fading Suns for at least an

Under Canadian civil law the copyright is still mine, as DGP never

There was a contract, but it was verbal. Legal, but tough to prove.

Role-playing gaming has its roots in the tabletop wargaming hobby,
and eventually supplanted it. More recently, collectable card games
grew out of the role-playing market. A few years ago, when Magic The 
Gathering was at its peak and there were new CCGs coming out left 
right and centre, an acquaintance of mine made the bold prediction 
that CCGing would eventually do to roleplaying what roleplaying did
to tabletop wargaming. This, despite the fact that at the time she
worked for WotC in its roleplaying game division! I told her that I
could in no way agree with her prediction... It\'s been a handful of
years since we\'ve been in touch* -- I wonder how she feels about
RPGs and CCGs now that her prediction has turned out to be wrong?

(* She aggressively tried to recruit me into CARPGA, a gamers\' 
activist organization, possibly because of my academic background
in library science and my (now) 20 years (then 15 years) experience
in gaming. She didn\'t take it too well when I told her what I thought
of her organization, and stopped speaking to me entirely when I told
her what I thought of her prediction about CCGs taking over RPGs...
perhaps I was a little harsh?) :)

Amazing how made-up words get into the general vocabulary, isn\'t it?

My comment, though, was that in response to the above question, I thought
of *two* general-pupose 4-letter words that I first heard on British
television, neither of which are "naff":

"Zark" -- from Hitchhiker\'s Guide To The Galaxy (as in, "Zark off!")
"Smeg" -- from Red Dwarf (several permutations)

The latter has the advantage (?) of being derived from a real word...
:)

(And both are better than the one from Battlestar Galactica: "Frak")

I sure hope not. I was thinking of that murder of the Marquis that happened
just two hours into jumpspace. The next stop is a sector capital, and the
Duke, who happens to be the Marquis\'s brother will insist on holding the
ship, unless the PC\'s can find the murderer before the ship falls out of the
hole.

Let\'s not forget the little Countess Vandi, travelling with her Regent, only
14 and somehow she\'s managed to get herself lost in the middle passage
decks. Her cousin, hoping to procure an Imperial appointment for the
Countess (her being a member of the local nobility), is beside himself. The
PC\'s must prevent this from becoming a scandal.

And of course there\'s the Ine Givar. The Deneb faction would just love the
attention from blowing up a Tukera Liner full of Nobles.  The Spinward
Marches faction has no great wish to be hunted down for such an act by
proxy.  Can the PC\'s stop it? Is the Zhodani agent trying to help the Ine
Givar, or stop them?

There\'s probably a few thousand more leads in there....

RL example. When stationed on a US Frigate during the Haiti boat lift we had
several hundred refugees picked up from unseaworthy craft on a ship designed
for ~140 officers & crew.  They stayed on deck and crew members were not
allowed above decks (due to possible disease infection).  Salt water showers
were rigged up.  The smell was so bad that for weeks after there was no
where on board that didn\'t stink of human waste, sweat and unwashed bodies.

I can\'t even imagine how much worse it would have been in a sealed
environment.

You\'re absolutely right. I had it in mind when I was typing up my list, but
I just forgot to put it on by the end. I\'m going to chalk it up to my

Yep, I thought about that one, but I still really haven\'t seen a real broad

but I think it\'s still finding its audience.

  FWIW, it appears that GW\'s recent expansion of their mail-order parts
service to Canada entailed something similar. I can order bits & pieces
from GW and pay S&H on top of everything, or I can order it direct from
a local non-GW hobby store. GW doesn\'t offer a mail-order discount (and
they are in fact the most expensive place for me to buy their regular
merchandise over the counter), and at least by going through the hobby
store I save the S&H charge.

  _But_ - it certainly appears that GW doesn\'t want to make it easy for
the retailers to use the service, including suspiciously long delays in
getting the orders. FWIW, the retailer I use has a great advantage - he
has a $US GW mail-order price list - which GW would/could not supply him
(_I_ got one from them easily, but their competitors^h^h business
associates couldn\'t?).

  At this point, I don\'t buy directly from GW for less than a 50% discount,
and where an alternative product comes close to filling a role then I buy
that to avoid helping the rat-bastards...

  Hmm, IIRC, there\'s a web-site that includes a "GW Auto-Basher" applet...

since the early eighties, how those little swear words from \'Battlestar
Galactica\' have permanently incorporated themselves into our everyday
language. My wife and I have used \'Poogies, Frak, Felgercarb\' et al so
much that our eight year old daughter (who btw loves my Traveller and
GURPS books) uses them as a semi-acceptable substitute for the
seven-dirty(+) words that will get suspended from school. We\'ve warned
her about \'frak\', it sounds too much like another word entirely. She\'s
has been watching over the summer our tape collection of B-5 and
Battlestar Galactica so this\'s only reinforcing things (in addition
turning her into a geekette at an early age).

And she still looks like Dittsie Spoofulam with the corresponding temper
to boot. Her favourite bedtime toy? A three-foot tall stuffed Totoro and
a little Spawn of Cthulu (courtesy of Chaosium). Cthulu recently ate her
stuffed Teletubbies (and she doesn\'t know about COC or the Mythos, at
least not yet). The tooth-fairy obviously is a MiGo.

My 70 year old scottish father-in-law has been using \'naff\' as a cuss
word for the last 15 years I\'ve known him, and I\'m quite sure he\'s never
seen the program that spawned it. He told me that it was a derogatory
reference to the \'naavies\' during World War II (ask Capt. Peacock on
\'Are You Being Served\' about them). It seems they were in a permanent
state of S.N.A.F.U. and were soldier/sailor wannabees.


ObTraveller: Like Star Trek IV, what obscenities and colourful idioms
have survived into the Far Future of the 3I in Traveller? Or have they
incorporated foreign c-words and morphed Anglic into something we cannot
recognize. Shakespeare\'s dirty words are either no longer obscene or
extinct from modern english. Remember at one time F*CK was not as
obscene as it is now (although Chris Rock uses it as his prime
adjective/verb!) Quite seriously, how about we invent new idiomatics for
Traveller? This\'ll be more fun than \'Relativistic Rocks\'!

  AFAIK Hogshead Publishing has the license, and they\'re making a serious
effort to put out a quality (and value-priced!) product. PW itself has
put out less and less material of serious quality over the years; legend
has it that once upon a time they really did publish innovative rules that
required only small amounts of errata or tweaking...

  If you feel an urge to get someone into an F-RPG then take a look at the 
WFRP book first - it\'s all in that one rulebook for ~$30 US, and there\'s a
steady stream of generally high-quality adventures and sourcebooks being 
either re-printed or commisioned as original works.

Good point, I did not take that into account. I do hope that the GT:

Sorry, I always had the impression that the Missouri Archive was all

Ok, I have to ask. I used to own an original GI Joe "Mercury Capsule".
The Capsule, Spacesuit, tether & backpack. Alas, thanks to my kid
brother it disappeared years ago. :-(

What would it be worth? (or what would it cost to replace it?)

It isn\'t surprising.

The US *distribution* system for RPGs is absolutely lousy at the moment and
is probably doing more damage to the market in a long term basis than CCGs
did in the short term.

They do not return calls, and are disorganised and poor at handling
products in. This is from experience - BITS tried to just *talk* to the
distrubutors in the US to establish what they wanted from us.

WoTC are making a rational decision if they establish their own
distribution chain. Much like SJG having warehouse23.

It\'s a shame that the FLGS are being hammered, but WoTC (as an OEM) wants
to shift units of their product. A secure chain helps this. :-/

C&S Lite is out already, and reintroduces some of the material missed out
in the 3rd ed. ISTR that once existing stocks of 3rd expire the 3.1 release
will come out. The Knight\'s companion is out (a collection of background
material on knights through the ages). A caveat to this - I do not lay or
own C&S - BITS just shared a stand with Britannia Game Designs at GenCon.
Steve & Sue Turner have done some excellent work in clearing up the look of
the game, and making a clear path through the rules... if I could overcome
the fear of the rules I\'d probably get a copy...

My images have been based on the factory I used to work in. The main
corridor had wall panels that were *screwed* into place. They weren\'t
removed often, but they were designed so they could be if it proved
necessary. 

Most of the "stuff" ran overhead. Layer after layer of piping and
electrical conduit. All labelled, often with arrows indicating flow
direction. Packed tightly in some ways, but kind of loose in others.

Basicly, they\'d do stuff like have six related pipes/conduits on the
same "hanger", then a gap on one side and space above so that you could
get at them to work on them. 

One other thing this got across to me. The corridor was *huge*, about
20" wide and 10" to the lower pipes. Why? Because they needed to be
able to move just about *any* piecew of equipment in the factory (or at
least the largest parts of them) along that corridor!

This makes sense on medium to large ships. Any ship where there\'s more
than one bulkhead between majot chunks of equipment and the outside is
going *need* internal passages big enough to move sub-assemblies of the
various weapons, drives, power plants, etc through. It beats the heck
out of cutting thru multiple presure bulkheads and then patching them
later. 

It also means it\'s possible to have *big* battles inside larger ships.
I rather expect that you could drive *tanks* down the main passages in
a battleship. 

Naturally, there\'d have to be pressure doors along the length of these.
But I think it\'d make damage control easier, because you can just yank
a car sized subassembly from something and have a spare dragged down to
you. You can worry about digging out the 50 cent component that failed
*after* the battle.

Well, in a spacecraft you have a *hard* limit in the form of air regen.
You can skimp on food for a long time. Heck, a healthy person can
survive a jump with *no* food. You can skimp on water. Healthy folks
*may* manage to make a jump on no water, but I wouldn\'t advise it. 

But you can\'t cut down air usage by much more than 50% (sedate all
non-essential personnel, and cut the O2 in that part of the ship to
only 1.5 to 2 psi. You don\'t *dare* drop it below 2 psi for the folks
who have to do physical work, or whose judgement has to remain
unimpaired. 

Likewise, you can\'t allow CO2 to build past a few percent.

It\'s possible to rig a setup that\'ll freeze the CO2 out of the air. So
that\'s not too bad. But I\'d have to look up the amount of O2 humans use
per day. That\'s your limit for refugees. 

I seriously doubt that the "air limit" can be stretched much. Just
about any *practical* kludge will have already been built into the air
system. 

This may make a good way to present PCs with a dilemma. There are 200
refugees or disaster survivors or whatever. And their ship *can\'t* take
more than 50 and still have a chance of anybody being alive at the end
of the jump.

Definition of a Dreadnought battleship: A ship with an `all big gun\'
armament (i.e. a primary battery of a single calibre, with a possible
secondary battery of a smaller calibre); and armoured against those guns
(i.e. a 15" Dreadnought should be armoured against 15" shells).

Battlecruisers are defined as carrying the same or similar size primary
battery as contemporary battleships, but sacrificing armour for speed.

Actually, Seeker controls at least some of those copyrights, at least
according to a conversation I had with the owner of Seeker in 1991.

FASA had given me permission to distribute copies of the deckplans free,
which I was doing. Seeker asked me to stop, as they had acquired the rights.

The stocklist ran out? Looks like I won\'t be posting my 20+ packs of
unpainted Traveller ships on eBay, then!

Actually, Rafm will do custom runs of stuff, if you order enough
miniarures. I think their current requirements are 250+ copies of the same
figure, with half payment required before they start the work. You could
write and ask. (Of course, their license may also have expired.)

Many of the Traveller ships live on as Silent Death miniatures (or some
other game starships, anyway).

I had a nice Tokina telephoto zoom that had macro capability on it. Cost me
$300 Cdn in 1985. Nice sharp images and the macro could enlarge up to three
times. Unfortunately some ^&% nicked it a few years ago.

	IMTU, Granfather change as few of of the physical characteristics of
the Canis species as possible. Vargr females only go into heat once or
twice a year. and in groups of females, only the strongest does (like
wolves, only the alpha female goes into heat). And no, female vargr do
not have the exaggerated breasts of humans. This make telling (for
ignorant people any ways) male and female apart difficult. And makes for
some interesting encounters. 
	Vargr are much less interested in sex than dominance, because only the
dominate males & females have sex. For everyone else it\'s a non-issue.

	Exactly. I know there are some other chemicals that have an equal
effect, usually not stuff you would want to eat. Given alien chemistry
and compounds there may be a few of these in the alternate diets
required on another world.

The answer is not so simple trig. We figure the parallax. That is, we
figure the apparent change in position over the course of a year. At
one parsec, the position change is one second of arc. 

E1

S                                                              star

E2

E1 and E2 are earth\'s position at opposite sides of it\'s orbit, S is
Sol, and star us the position of the star. The distance from E1 to S is
one AU. The distance from S to Star is one parsec if the angle between
the lines connecting E1 & star and E2 & star is one second of arc. 

This gives a right triangle with E1-S being 1 AU, and the angle
E1-star-S being .5 seconds of arc. So a parsec is arctan(.5") AU or around
204,000 AU. 

The farther out, the smaller the angle.

So it basicly depends on two factors. First, how well can you determine
the length of your "baseline" (E1-S-E2). Second, how accurately can you
determine the angles. A tiny change in angle can be a *large*
difference in distance.

*However*, the situation in Traveller is a bit different. For explored
space, and quite a ways outside it, stellar positions will have been
determined by observations from systems *parsecs* apart. Which makes
the angles much larger, and thus the inaccuracies smaller. 

If you can match several bright stars with your charts (probably by
taking spectra), you\'ll have your position nailed to a matter of a
small fraction of a parsec.

Try it on paper. If you measure an angle of, say, 40.5 degrees between
two stars that are 10 parsecs apart, you\'ve placed yourself at one of
two points. Add a third star that isn\'t on the line joinu\\ing the first
two and you know which of the two points you are at. And the
uncertainty in your angular measurements defines the area that has to
contain your ship. 

You could *literally* plot this on a table sized starmap given the "2D"
nature of Traveller. And doing so will do for an example of just how
easy this is. For 3D you need a computer. Or a good 3d model of the
stars. 

But let\'s examine that 2d map version. I said that the stars were 40.5
degrees apart. Let\'s say you\'ve got a .5 degree uncertainty (which is a
*huge* error, bigger than the width of the full moon). 

You can determine coreward fairly well in most places. If you can\'t you
use Andromeda or one of the Magellinic clouds to establish coreward &
spinward (and galactic north in a 3D universe.

So, you place a straightedge running through one star, and move it
until it\'s at the right angle to coreward or spinward. Now draw a
*long* line going thru the star. Repeat for the other star(s). The
lines *won\'t* all intersect at the same point. But the area containing
their intersections should be fairly small. Much less that a parsec. 

Of course, it gets even easier since your "charts" also tell you how
*bright* the stars are. Measure how bright they *appear* to be and you
can tell how far away they are (+/- the accuracy of your measurements).

So you draw a pair of circles centered on each of your three "guide
stars". One at the minimum distance your measurement allows, one at the
maximum. There will be a small volume where the areas thus degined
overlap. That\'s where you are. 

If there *isn\'t* an overlap, you\'ve misidentified a star or your
equyipment is badly broken. 

But seriously, both the angular measurements and distance measurements
are likely going to pin down your position to within an AU or so even
after a 36 parsec misjump.

All because the charts will be so much more accurate thanks to
astronomers having been able to measure things from places parsecs
apart.

Andy,

Sounds like you\'re doing it correctly.  MT ships tend to need large power 
plants and huge fuel reserves for a decent cruise duration.  Try to make use 
of lower power weapons (missles, etc.).  You might have to drop the cruise 
duration down to 20 days or so to make most designs profitable.

While this is a good survival trait for small packs of carnivores needing huge
hunting territories to support their populations, in an environement that can
support higher densities, this will break down rather rapidly.

Either less dominate individuals will start breeding in a pack, battles for
dominance become constant, and escalate, or the pack breaks up rapidly into
couples (another common canid strategy, as in coyotes). If only the \'leaders
of the pack\' breed, in Vargr society, they will have real problems achieving
the population densities required for building a high tech society.

The other thing to remember is that Gramps didn\'t play with humans and wolves
because he wanted to see what would happen, he did it to have a steady supply
of slaves. Being able to ramp up reproduction as needed is a definite
advantage if you\'re breeding slaves.

[This message is from my personal point of view and does not
necessarily reflect the views and opinions of my employers.]

I order games for a small us distributor, Mad Als, in
Alaska.  Let me describe it to you from a distributors point
of view.  Every single day we get more cold call from new
retailers looking for Pokemon than we received of customer
calls, of all sorts, in any given _month_ last year.

When retailers call WOTC looking for Pokemon, WOTc refers
them to their distributor list despite the fact that they
will not sell distributors even
5% of what they need to meet existing accounts.  WOTC will
tell you they do not have enough Pokemon for everyone (they
do not), what they will not tell you is that each of their
WOTC stores in Seattle was receiving more Pokemon to sell
each day then they sent to some distributors each month. 
WOTC says distributors are not serving the market and
ignores the fact that we are not getting enough Pokemon to _try_.

The reason I don\'t return phone calls much this year is that
usually everyone in
sales is busy all day on the phone and I have to answer it
as well.  Then I have to talk to people who only want to buy
one product from us.  I often end up selling them other
Pokemon products (plush, posters, PVC, etc) but every minute
I spend talking to them is a minute I am not spending
ordering games.  

If your name is not WOTC, TSR, Palladium, FASA, or SJG I may
not return your calls. [I prefer to work via fax, with a fax
you do not have to waste time on the phone or on the web,
with a fax it is all right there for me.]
We could hire additional people to handle the work load but
since calls have gone up several _thousand_ percent we would
end up loosing money on this since we do not have the
Pokemon cards (although we do have other great Pokemon
merchandise) to sell them.

We are still filling (a few percent at a time) Pokemon
backorders from March and April.

I love Traveller and I considered selling BITS products.
Last year I asked them to fax me their terms and policies. 
When I discovered that their minimum orders were more than I
thought I could sell, I told them no thanks (albeit not as
rapidly as I should have). Remember that distributors sell
to stores at good discounts.  When SJG sells BITS over the
web they charge full retail, that is part of what enables
them to sell BITS products profitably (I am assuming it is
profitable for them). 

If a new company tried to sell me a product this year I
would tell them to send me a fax with the information I
needed.  If I did not get this fax, if it did not have the
information I need [Not just retail price, but wholesale
discount, case quantity, minimum order size, freight
policies, reliable contact numbers, etc.], or if I did not
think we could make a profit with their products I would
probably never get back to them.

Because of Pokemon related problems caused by the way WOTC
is distributing Pokemon (WOTC & GameKeeper stores get first
crack, ToysRUS second crack and their current distributors
are about 27th in line).  We (and lots of other US
distributors) are much more time stressed then we used to
be.  That is why we may seem disorganized.

We are in business to _make_a_profit_ (It is called
capitalism, boys and girls) not to carry games we do not
think we will loose money on.   If handling Pokemon related
products means we have less time to sell and solicit other
product then we will not be able to sell as many copies of
those products.
This means we are less likely to order them. If Pokemon
changes the market then everything else _will_ suffer.

the astronaut performing a personal data assistant function.  Check it
out, its at
http://space.com/spaceimagined/psa_ball.html

This got me to thinking.

I wonder what would happen in a game if this was mentioned..... fade
in..

GM comments on this article while munching on WOW! Doritos.

GM: Okay.. Lets start..  You were all at the starport last time getting
your
butt\'s...

Player 1: But (whine) I wannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnt one.

Player 2: yeah, my character already has \'em.  Ten of them.  All armed
with
plasma guns.  And they obey my every command.  Matter of fact, they are
programmed to constantly monitor the situation all the time.  At any
sign of
a threat, they blast it.

GM: What????

Player 2: Oh yeah, they have advanced AI capabilities, really smart.

GM: (leaning on arm)... How about fuel and ammo....

Player 2: Fuel? Ammo?  Goddamit GM!  You don\'t expect me to have worry
about
stuff like that?  Is this a game for accountants?  You are just trying
to
cheez me out of some way cool stuff.

Player 1: Yeah, and they protect the whole party.

Player 2: No they don\'t.  They don\'t like the whole party. They protect
and
OBEY only me.

Player 1: (looks mad)

Player 2: (smirks)

Player 3: Where did you get them?

GM: That\'s right.  This is obviously a tech 15 item.  You have to buy
them,
and they cost a lot of money... 100,000 Cr a piece.  You are only on
Tech 14
world, and you can\'t find stuff like that.

Player 2: WHAT!!!!  Tech 15?  You just saw it on the Internet.. and we
are
Tech 7.

Player 1: Tech 9...

Player 2: Fine, whatever.. Tech 8 for all I care.  The point is that if
we
can have them now, its only a matter of extrapolation.  Add a few guns..

better computer.. no prob.

GM: Look.  I do think they are a good idea.  (players smile)  But, in my

game, these little ones don\'t have guns.  (Players frown)

Player 1: That\'s crap.  Why wouldn\'t people have guns on them?

Player 3: (laughs) Cause your average person is not a psychotic paranoid

killer. I can just see it now. Everyone walking around with a floating
gun
platform.  People would be a lot more polite. No more bar fights.

Player 2: Look, I am just prepared.  Besides.. 100,000 Cr? No prob. We
pay
for them.

Player 1: WHAT!?  No way, not out of ship funds.

Player 2: (growls.. in character??)... You are gonna argue with me?  I
am in
charge. I am responsible for the safety of this ship.

Player 1: Yourself..

Player 2: and the crew

Player 3: Yourself..

Player 2: and if we don\'t have them the GM will surely put the against
us.

(all look at GM, who shrugs)

GM: Well, now that you gave me the idea...

Player 3: Oh damnit!  (turning to player 2).. you had to bring that
up....

GM: That\'s IT!  First, no-one has these things in the party.  Why? You
just
don\'t. I\'ll allow you to get one, but they are not floating gun
platforms.
Those do exist.. the Zho got them, but they are much bigger.

Player 2: Fine, we get one of those.

GM: No you don\'t.

Player 2: too late, we already got one.

GM: What? When?

Player 2: Just now.. I said we get one of those.  What.. they cost about

1 megacredit.  Fine.. We just buy one.

GM: (pause...longer pause..even longer pause)

Player 3: I think the GM is upset.

GM: What did you do? Call Dominoes and order a large pepperonni, "and by
the
way, with the drinks, send over one Zhodani warbot!"

Player 2: Oh, now you are making fun of me?  of course not.  We just
call up
a weapons dealer and get one.

GM: And I suppose every weapons dealer has one.

Player 2: You want me to waste my time trying to get one?  Look, I am
not
here to play around and waste my time trying to get weapons.  That\'s so
boring.  We just get them.  Don\'t waste our time.

Player 3: and what would you do with it?

Player 2: Take over the space station and rule everyone.

GM: How?

Player 2: HOW?  GODDAMMIT! I JUST DO!  I don\'t believe you!!!  I just do
it.
You want us to deal with such petty shit.  Constantly wasting our time.
This is roleplaying a character!  ITS NOT REAL LIFE.  Its why I have
stats.
Do you really think I know how to work gravitics? No! But my character
does!
Does that mean I have to explain how I fix a grav car?  NO! I JUST DO!
Therefore I just get a warbot and take over the space station.  Dammnit,
I
am not unreasonable.

Player 3: Yeah, you could have said you wanted to rule the galaxy.

Player 2: Get real.  Thats after I take over the space fleet here.

GM: (rolls the dice)  Your character explodes in frustration.

Player 1: YEAH BABY!  I get his armor.

Player 3: It wouldn\'t fit you. It fits me.

Player 2: SHUT THE F*** UP!  (calming down to a mild fury)  Look, what
do
you want, you want me to go fiiinnd this thing?

GM: First, you aren\'t going to find a warbot.  Okay, maybe you will
eventually, but not now.  These little things are personal assistants...

like secretaries.

Player 2: My secretary would carry a plasma gun.

Player 3: And grenades.. Don\'t forget about grenades.

Player 1: Don\'t EVER forget about grenades.

Player 2: DAMNIT. OKAY! grenades too.

GM: They are a combination computer, data assistant, secretary, and
communicator.  That is ALL!  No weapons.

Player 1: Not even a small one?

GM: NONE.

Player 1: How about if they fly real fast and bump into someone?

GM: They can\'t. Their programming prohibits them from hitting someone.

Player 3: We can fix that, I got computer ops 9.

GM: No you can\'t.  Its hard-wired into the chip.

Player 3: Those bastards!

GM: Player 2, you are real quiet.

Player 2: You take the fun out of all this.  I don\'t know why I keep
playing.

GM: (a pause)  Well, great.  Okay, where were we.. Last time, you were
just
arriving in the starport, and you needed to find the nobleman to get
your
cargo.  You just learned he has been kidnapped, and the kidnappers want
to
get the cargo for themselves.  Right now, though, you are being
confronted
by a gang of young kids..local toughs, who obviously don\'t like you or
more
obviously, like your stuff and money better than you.  They have pipes
and
knives..

Player 2: I pull out my gun and hose them. They die.

Player 3: I call up the local web directory and do a search for a store
that
sells those data assistants.

Player 1: Get me one too, okay?  I still don\'t have any money.

    I don\'t know if there\'s a consensus, exactly, but there are some
things I would suggest you do.  The First In sequence basically assumes
that all planets are in their "natural" state, which isn\'t really all that 
good
an assumption in the 3I universe.

    First off, there are a couple of things that First In takes into account
that earlier versions of Traveller didn\'t.  One of them is stellar age.  If 
you
want to just assume that all stars are about 4-5 billion years old you\'ll
get more habitable planets.

    Another thing you could do is assume that any planet in the life
zone or the middle zone that has a substantial atmosphere has a
oxynitrogen atmosphere even if there isn\'t any native life.  Assume
that life has been imported, or that an O-N atmosphere was set up
at some time in the past and hasn\'t had time to degrade yet.

    It would be reasonable, in a setting where a lot of terraforming has
taken place, to "fudge" rolls for hydrographic percentage and atmospheric
density.  Given enough time and effort, those things can be adjusted
within broad limits.

	Sorry, maybe I wasn\'t clear--I\'m familiar with the mathematical
underpinning. I\'m trying to figure out how accurately, right now
(1999), a spacecraft with star trackers could determine its position
at any given time within our solar system, strictly based on star
mapping. In other words, all I\'m looking for is how well we know the
position of various stars? I can find out the accuracies of the star
trackers themselves. Together, the two will tell me how big the error
volume is.

I was the programmer that posted the initial statement - and I discovered
that part of the problem was a bug in my program. Heh. I am much more
satisfied with the generated output now - although the percentage of
"garden" worlds is still very low compared to CT.

I don\'t think any hard an fast rules for First In modification have come

They didn\'t.  Unisys owns the patent on the LZW (I think thats the one) compression
method that CIS used in creating GIF.  Therefore any software implementing GIF owes
Unisys a royalty.  Sad, GIF made the web a reality and Unisys is being despirate.

As a side issue to this, once I\'ve got my copy of \'Terraforming\' back
from a friend, I will calculate the lifespans of the atmospheres of
terraformed planets without technological upkeep for planets of size 1-A
to see if this will throw any further light on the matter.

The best answer is not to use a computer program, but spend some time doing
the grunt work yourself.  Sometimes, you have to fiddle with the results
and fudge the dice rolls to get a world in the habitable zone.

If you look at the editorial for JTAS 5, it implies that CT assumes all systems
to be in population 1 anyway (or at least that such a decision was under
consideration).

Maybe this could be incorporated within Jumpspace theory such that the Jump
network only connects pop1 stars.
