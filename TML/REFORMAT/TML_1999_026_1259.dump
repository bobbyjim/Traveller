You mean the Macarena isn\'t a dark summoning ritual? Frack. Another theory

By using the motion of a S2 in relationship to S1, you define a plane (s2
\'s apparent orbital motion circumscribes a plane; for reference I use
down/"below the plane" to mean that looking toward the plane at s1, s2 will
appear to move counter clockwise.  This reduces the solution from infinite
vectors to 1 vector.

note also that if, from the direction you\'re looking at the pair from:
If A orbits B clockwise, and you are in the regime of B, a appears to move;
if you are in the regime of A, however, B appears to move clockwise around
A.

also note: I used rays, not lines. A ray has an origin point, but no end
point; the second point establishes a diretion. By applying a vector ray
perpendicular to the ray, at the end of the co-named segment, you define a
three dimensional reference; it is possible to define a bearing and azimuth
accurately now; thus a three dimensional course.

As for doing the math, I\'ve done the math, and we\'ve had this argument
before. 4 years ago. I\'ve not changed my mind, and I don\'t care to. It
means I don\'t have to worry about relative speeds. It meets the letter of
the rules in TNE, and allows for quick calculations, and enables the "Bingo
Jump" phenomena from TNE. (I may hate the rules and the setting, but TNE is
chock full of neat ideas. Often hidden.) Jump Space alone violates
conservation in some ways, by allowing a ship to move to different
potential energy states. IMTU, the universe compensates for the changes in
other ways.

Also, in no case will someone be exactly at the halfway point and not have
a vector and  yet still have to worry about relative vector at exit. If
they are at the halfway point, I generally throw the S1 to the one they are
moving towards. I use acceleration due to gravity to determine signifcance.
I realize the sun is often (but not always) more significant than luna;
luna is however, big enough that it\'s effects (and 100 D limit) make using
it far more interesting than, say, phobos and deimos. It makes for choice
of outgo vector especially critical, and often dependant upon target
system. It creates a readily measureable resting point. In most cases (but
not all) it means the world itself will be the S1.

It confirmed what I felt (and told you via extensive discussion off list oh
those years ago)... It was too complex for my player group; It meant that
the PC\'s who were elevated for service were not, in fact, imperial nobles,
and thus didn\'t count (or so was the players\' contention); it added nothing
positive to the feel of nobility, but did detract from the experience. It
also made the players (One of whom was soc 15) very reluctant to even stop
in to the local imperial baron on a Social call, let alone seek him out as
a potential patron, source of info, or even social contact.

If one has imperial nobility so far separated, the ability of PC\'s to FEEL
connected to the imperium is reduced.

I use the following base-lines... The local ruler is also an Imperial
Baron, count or viscount. All Local nobility are knights or barons on the
imperial scale. A Major World with subordinate governments (such as a local
multi-system polity which joined as a polity, rather than individual
worlds) would have their leader an Imperial Marquis. IMTU, All barons and
higher have voice in the moot, regaurdless of type; only those in service
to the imperium have a vote, and most send proxies to trusted associates
on/near capital.

In GURPS terms, make local ranks cheaper (ala courtesy ranks). If Imperial
Social rank is 5 pts/level, A Major world should be 3 pts a level, and a
minor one 2. Reduce each by 1 point if honor title.

The rules of any roleplaying game should be a basis for resolving those
bits which are NOT "Role Played". By by that standard, the rest of the

JC is a wonderfully written game. It has a decent set of rules; a simple
and consistant mechanic. The mechanics are a hybrid of tactical wargame and
roleplaying skill systems. The vehicle design system is more a rating
system, which also tells you how big it MUST be (as a range), based upon
the basic tech level of the system. Not to mention it is compatable with
Heavy Gear and Tribe 8. But, the system overall, while well written and
simple, looks to lend it self more to dice-rolling than role-playing. (I
have not yet run any of the DP9 stuff except as solo-combat bits). Best
non-FTL RPG setting I\'ve read. Much better than Terradyne. Setting with
details as rich and mineable for ideas as S1889.

I do agree, however, that it should eb looked at, especially the books on
ships. Great feel for TL9, extended duration, in-system ships. Note: Trav
TL 9 is pregravitic, and late TL 9 is jump capable.

I will certainly use handouts, assuming my terrible case of laziness
doesn\'t prevent me...

The other ideas are interesting, and I will consider them further, though
my brain is a bit zapped tonight, after a hard day of fighting off the Red
Army.  (We were demonstrating and playtesting a set of WWII miniatures
rules some guys up north designed, and admiring the miniatures they
designed.  The game quite literally went all day, with new forces being
sent in to replace units that got chewed up.  Eventually I was swamped by
sheer weight of numbers.  Eventually my brain started hurting, too.)  

My opponents were two of the munchkins I will be playing Traveller with. 
It would have been _really_ cool if we had been playing Striker (either
version).

I discovered that the munchkin who had picked up a second-hand copy of TNE
has got a copy of T4 too, now.  Unfortunately, the only T4 supplement he
can find in Brisbane is the mouse mat called Starships.  I gave him the
appropriate advice, and I will get the errata to him when I see him next
(next year!).

What was _really_ scary, though, was that someone I played Traveller with
in _1982_ was there, and he threatened to start a **CT** game.  The horror!
 The horror!

Particularly once you factor in the means of transmission. If you are able
to capture their couriers or otherwise get them to divulge the messages
they are carrying then you are probably in a vastly superior position
strategically anyway. Just another example of Traveller not working like
the twentieth century. Once the shooting starts Sigint at the Fleet level
is probably irrelevant.

Before the shooting starts is a different matter. I wonder what it would be
worth to any of the 3I\'s adversaries to infiltrate the X-boat network? Even
if you can\'t decode the messages the mere volume of trafic will tell you
alot about fleet dispositions. (as was pointed out on another thread.)
{Unless of course the IN folks deliberately inflate traffic to backwater
posts to throw spys off the scent.}
And if you are able to compromise the code keys then that\'s lots of
gravy.

Zane,

I bought a copy yesterday from my FLGS and have a Mac so I have to

the SR pdfs on the Vol 1 disk in the folder Mags.

(obviously TD, TC, MTJ and SGK would be nice additions too but I 
doubt that will happen).

Interesting - I feel like a NASA Mars probe as until the last two

	I try to forestall that with the following section from my "Player\'s
Introduction" document (plagiarized from many places ... wait, if
it\'s many places it\'s "research" ...)

My basic philosophy for this game is to set the stage ("You\'re next
to a swamp") and the goal ("You need a bridge across the swamp"). You
decide who goes into the swamp to build the bridge, and I just make
sure the alligators in the swamp get equal air time. In order to have
a common framework, and throw in an element of "realism" and
fairness, I\'ll use the mechanics of GDW\'s rules, with my own
modifications. My goal is to be fair and consistent and while I
welcome your observations and help, I am the final arbitrator of the
rules. If, during the game, you have a question or complaint about my
interpretation of the rules, I\'ll try to answer it briefly, but I\'d
rather make a slight consistent error and continue with the plot for
everyone to enjoy rather than spends hours arguing. I may ask you to
wait until after the session to keep things from bogging down. If you
disagree about the rules themselves, please save it for between
sessions. We all want to keep the action flowing.

From the Games Machine entry in the Facts on File book "Aliens, Robots and
Spaceships" by Jeff Rovin:

"The term "null-A" was coined by Count Alfred Korzybski in his "General

In my own experience with the Facts on File books by Rovin, he\'s usually

	I started putting together a player\'s background document, with a
variety of things in it ... the background of the universe, an
overview of how I run things, quick summaries of the major rules,
skills and characteristics, etc. I very liberally plagiarized from
(among other things) the draft TNE documents GDW posted on GEnie, as
well as mailing list comments from various people. I usually hand it
to new players and walk them through the major points. Next, I follow
up with a quick one-shot adventure; my all-time favorites are "Divine
Intervention" or "Chamax Plague." Why can\'t we get more of that kind
of gaming supplement ...?

Personally, I don\'t care whether it\'s F or C, if it\'s a negative
number it\'s too cold for me.  I\'m one of those people Cynthia was
talking about...sweaters at 60F, thick coats at 50F, mittens,
earmuffs and layered clothes at 40F, huddle around the stove at 30F,
and if it gets colder than that it\'s time to migrate further south!

OTOH, we *do* need a couple of days below freezing to hold down the
mosquitos.  Oh, let\'s say, a Wednesday and Thursday in the middle of
January.  <g>

Snow?  Oh, that white stuff that we see on televison sometimes!
It\'s similar to that stuff that grows in our freezers...yes?

And as for convertibles..while they are a nice idea, they tend to
turn into big bath tubs with little warning.  Besides picking bugs
out of my teeth isn\'t something I\'m fond of.

I think we\'re in "violent agreement" here, Leonard. I don\'t
believe that living in Canada is by any means immunity. It just
makes things slightly more irritating.

And to really talk out of my ass, I don\'t think NAFTA deals 
with that sort of thing. I\'m sure it\'s covered by some other
multi-lateral agreement though.

Lotus has lawyers like trees have leaves. Roger Sanger has unpaid
bills like bird cages have shit. 

I am not talking about where the thin blue line of the law is drawn
around DGP\'s works & rights. I\'m talking about the practical
matter of whether or not you can reasonably be expected to be charged
for doing something. Right or wrong, I\'m pretty sure you can get
away with anything less than plagarism.

Eh. Sure, I can understand that. But what, the editors all sit around
checking everything? Right. They tell you not to, you ignore them, everyone
is happy. Does saying this make me sound cynical?

You miss my point. Who cares what the license says? If you won\'t
get charged, then it\'s not against the law. That\'s how common law
works.

I can\'t remember if the Union call them Azi, but they do rely on vat

Nor I. Mind you I haven\'t actually run a Traveller camapiagn that ran 
for more than a single session for about five years now, and the last I 
played in only went about five session (and was two years ago). I\'m not 
sure why it is, but I find it very hard to get a SF game that\'s not 
really science-fantasy to run. Part of it recently is that my current 
group don\'t have any eral interest in SF, but it\'s always been hard.

What exactly do you mean by basic load? In NZ we have no such beast.

OTOH with battlefield support weapon\'s effectiveness and reach 
continuing to improve, along with ELINT probably improving pretty much 
in step with communications the actual seperation of each nam from his 
fellows will probably contiue to increase. This means that while the CO 
may have better contact with his troops they will be spread over more 
and more territory, so in actual fact he could well have less and less 
real grasp of what each man is doing.

IMO in a well trained army the requirement for each man to be able to 
think and excercise initiative will become greater, not less in the 
future, better communications notwithstanding. In my (admittedly 
limited) experience over control by higher echelons, even when they 
_actually_ have real-time data, does not generally improve performance -
 in fact just the opposite.

Consider this: a merchant ship of J2 can, on a misjump, wind up up to 18
jumps away. A J2 ship can cross the rift, if she\'s got enough demountable
tankage.

In either case, it is likely that the ship could be sold well before any
news of it being stolen is possible. Likewise, a legitimate trader can be
over 4 months each way commo time from it\'s homeworld of Registry, as still
be legit. Especially if paid off. Realistic limits have to be set so that
insurures don\'t justify "Waiting for a response from every planet in the
imperium"; 16 imperial months is sufficient for X-mail from one end to the
other and back, assuming J-4 x-mail [1]. Realistically, a 3 month probate
period allows for any normal operations to have a chance to hear and
respond. it gives 5 X-mail jumps (40 days) out, plus 40 days back, plus 4
days time on target. (3 Imp Months is 84 days, BTW). So every world within
4J4 gets the message, essentially, plus the main line gets it. That\'s
within reasonable range. Requiring recovery within a year increases trade:
If the ship isn\'t recovered, the insurance must write it off 3 months later
as non-recoverable, and replace it. The bank can either write it off or
replace it. Mind you, any ship wich can get far enough away that 5 Xmail
hops won\'t get there has been striving hard to get out of dodge, since it\'s
made some. Additionally, if a ship gets stolen, and you notify everyone
within 16 months x-mail hops, you\'ve probably out run it. By the time they
have replied, you\'ve got a basic assumption going it\'s not coming back.

Anything longer than one year (Round trip x-mail from captial to the
marches and back, BTW), and you start looking at insurers and banks being
able to hold significant ammounts of trade off by failure to declare a ship
lost, and allow for replacement. Money changing hands is the lifesblood of
the imperium. The easiest way to pay a claim is to recover the ship, yes,
but reasonable times must also be linked to other factors. Note also, I
don\'t limit skip tracing to a year IMTU. Skipping is not the same as theft
of ship; it\'s criminal breach of contract.

Any system is going to allow for scamming. Heck, the existing systems for
earth don\'t actually define "abandoned" all that well. The most common
definition I\'ve seen is "All crew left either on the captain\'s orders or
voluntarily, while at sea, without arranging for the ship to be under tow
or otherwise defended or recovered". SO if you abandon ship, and haven\'t
already called for a recovery, it\'s fair game. Different nations have
differing standards for abandoned. The US salvaged a sunk russian sub
(well, part of it) at one point. The russians couldn\'t do much about it,
either. It had become a derelict, within a year of going down. Note also
the sub had gone down without encoutering direct enemy action.

Union call them \'Azi\'. They\'re covered in depth in \'Cyteen\' and 
\'40,000 in Gehenna\'.

Overall I\'d disagree with Leonard\'s view on Union - reading the 
books, Union increasingly becomes more human (\'than human\') whilst 
Alliance and Earth move towards totalitarianism. Union\'s reliance on 
Azi stems from the fact they are initially relying on their Vat grown 
people to combat the shear numbers available to the Earth Company, 
dominating as it does the mother well.

I\'d agree that Union is \'alien\' during the Company War, particularly 
because of the similarities between Azi as a result of Deep tape 
learning.

Well, you can.

The shipment of the new LWB adventures from BITS has departed from 
the UK, containing \'SpaceDogs\' and \'The Khiidkar Incident\'. They 
should retail at the same cost as the 101 Series ($8 USD IIRC) if 
they follow the same pricing as the UK and BITS. Both have full stats 
for npcs, ships etc and could be used to launch a campaign if 
necessary. \'SpaceDogs\' is even more suitable for a one off as it was 
originally used in cut down form as a tournament adventure (3-4 hours 
worth). (And it has a gorgeous cover by Jesse).

Whether these are available before Christmas depends on SJ Games mail 
order side - they may hold to the New Year - over which we have no 
influence. I think that they have a lot on their plate already.

It is planned that a number of other adventures compatible with GT 
and T4 (and other editions with the conversion notes) will be 
released next year, but \'The Traveller Bibliography\', \'At Close 
Quarters\' and \'101 Patrons\' will precede them. Andy is currently 
laying out and final editing these in Quark Express - I expect 
they\'ll be available in the US Q1 \'00. Europe will have about a 
months\' edge as usual (shipping time etc).

Up here we can see doctors and lawyers coming a mile off.  They are the ones
wear three pages out of the LL Bean catalog and driving a Saab with a full

There\'s a company that makes paintballs filled with pepper spray for

Leonard Erickson (aka Shadow):

Personally, I\'d be more inclined to bet that the difference is that the
kids *knew* they were shooting at people who were unarmed. They didn\'t
have to worry about them *shooting back*.

Me2:

All very good points. However, I wouldn\'t be surprised if computer
simulations are a factor in increased to hit ratios as the targets are
\'human\' and can move (though they don\'t factor in stuff like recoil). And
DOD\'s across the world are investing in this stuff so it must be doing some
good. BTW the COL is question was the infamous Grosseman (what a coincidence
!) 

How does MILES factor in things like recoil and other real life gun stuff? 

Oh, merry x-mas to TMLers far and wide. I hope Y2K leaves with nothing but
an unpleasant rash (I better check my creams when I get home for
compliance).

Apologies if you guys got this twice. Stoopid mailer.

Union does indeed call them Azi. The Serpent\'s Reach region of space was
colonized by the Union, then quarantined, hence its social system is a
(much more extreme) version of that prevailing in the Union.
Actually, I think it\'s Kontrin and Majat. The entire area of human space
has "rejuve" technology that provides limited life extension; the ruling
families in the \'Reach combined human technology with Majat (alien caste
species with high bio-tech) to give the ruling caste vastly expanded
lifespans (tweaking the DNA, etc.).

ObTrav, my favorite Cherryh moment was in one of the latter Chanur books
where it is made obvious that the Pride of Chanur uses the same turret
systems as in Traveller, and they mention having upgraded the empty
hardpoints to actual turrets after the recent unpleasantness in the earlier
series episodes.

Leonard\'s quite right. Around 1935 the British Royal
Society did a study into the issues that\'d need to eb
addressed for a flight to the moon. The plan they came
up with was for a four-man capsule that\'d be both
spacecraft and moon lander (as opposed to the eventual
USA approach of having them separate). It even looked
at issues like whether or not the men could smoke
(answer: nope, it\'d be a waste of oxygen). They even
pondered whether or not to take a gun. I think they
said yes, just in case...

There was an article in Popular Mechanics about it a
while back, I think.

Flamebait Note: just like the A-bomb, the British may
not have got there first, but they thought of it
before the Americans did. The Americans may have the
resources, but the Commonwealth has the brains!

Oy, what a load of baloney. How would you inhibit free
discussion? I would think the major problem would be
for you, not us: every roleplayer and his dog saying,
"I don\'t understand why on page 32 of this book it

oh boy, I am glad I live in nice, peaceful, naive
Australia. I had to got o Afirca to hear AK-47s, I
most certainly would NOT like to hear them Down Under.
Not even used as fireworks: after all, what goes up,
must come down (and with much the same velocity as
wiith which it went up). Every year when the Arabs
celebrate in Bahgdad, or the Afghanis in their hills,
several people are killed by falling bullets.

I think I also would fire back, Eric: and then the
next day pack my bags and move somewhere quiet, dull,
with no postal workers.

I\'d like to recommend here looking at the cd section
of your local library, or the cheap rack at your music
store: you\'ll often find cds of sound effects,
everything from karate kicks to explosions to - well,
farts.
This sort of thing can really help set the mood.
Though what mood you\'d be going for with the last
sound, I\'m not sure...

This is almost turning into a roll call with either "Yes I am in a campaign"
or "No I am not in a campaign" as the two possible answers...

My own response is a Yes, as I am currently running a GURPS Traveller 
campaign. The PCs are members of an ultra-secret, ultra-covert intelligence
unit affiliated with the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, circa 1116,
in the Dagudashaag Sector. So far they have helped topple two planetary
governments and totally destroyed the economy of a farm planet. (They
have also fought terrorists, criminal druglords, bug-eyed monsters, psionic
criminals, and IRIS agents.)

The campaign has its own web site:
	http://plaza.powersurfr.com/glenn/traveller/index.html

We are on hiatus until January, as December our schedules tend to go out
of whack (extended Xmas shopping hours, office Xmas parties, visiting
relatives, etc.). At the end of the last "episode", they had misjumped
after jumping inside the 100-diameter limit while being fired upon by
an Imperial Navy ship...

(Yes, my PCs *are* the good guys...)

56K??? I think the person using such a system would be 
easy enough to track from the gigantic piece of wire they\'ll
be lugging around.

The average digital cell phone transmits at between 8 and 13
kbps - it takes a _lot_ of bandwidth to transmit high bit-rates
over the air. Remember that any piece of copper has as much
bandwidth as the rest of the universe combined and there\'s
a hell of a lot more competition for wireless bandwidth.
(Assuming you\'re the sole user of the piece of wire).

At any rate, your suggestion is a good one, which
is why modern CDMA cell phone technology (used by Sprint
in the US and Bell & Clearnet in Canada, among others) is
derived from military technology, spread spectrum (and a
bunch of other things, but there\'s a lot of similarity
between spread spectum and code division multiplexing).

Better yet, you can record voice as low as 4k per second 
(and still understand it) and transmit at higher rates,
making the burst pretty short.

The best part about CDMA transmission is that they look
just like noise - *mathematically*. An observer without
a connection into the transmission system (ie. either the
base or handset) can\'t tell whether it\'s a cell phone
or a leaky microwave. (Well, they probably could, but it
would be a lot easier to trick than the typical analog
AMPS-type cell phone, which can be monitored with a $20
piece of hardware from Radio Shack).

Hm, well, again, you could cut the transmission time to
one half or one third of the original, but you\'d need to
suck up a few gigahertz of bandwidth to do it in a tenth
of a second. That would probably stand out pretty obviously.

The best part is that this is all derived from Shannon\'s
law which limits information transfer rates - something
that the Third Imperium is unlikely to circumvent. (Although
finding a way around Shannon\'s law would be pretty cool...
compressing the sum of human knowledge into two bytes :)

Basic load: The basic field issue load-out for combat.

Typical (based upon my limited experience with infantry, and the Soldier\'s
Manual of Common Tasks, aka Smart Book):

1 kg load bearing equipment (Belt, suspenders, and pouches)
2 kg field pack
2-4 kg battle rifle or assault rifle (empty)
1 kg bayonet
1 kg Entrenching tool
1 kg medical supplies
2 kg change of uniform
4 kg MOPP gear, not including L4 suit (Includes boots, gloves, and mask)
2 kg MOPP Coverall (The L4 suit)
1-5 kg Basic load of ammunition: (US ARMY: 4-7 clips of ammo, plus 2-8
grenades)
0.5 kg Flashlight
0.5 kg Poncho
1 kg Shelter half
0.5 kg underwear (Socks, shorts, shirts) for 3-7 changes)
2-4 kg Rations, MRE
4.2 kg water (4 L in two canteens)
- ----
25-35 kg total, for moving out on foot.

Patrol BL (based off of SMART book and what I\'ve seen of the US Army in
Bosnia, Somalia, Iraq, and Germany from news footage):
1 kg load bearing equipment (Belt, suspenders, and pouches)
2-4 kg battle rifle or assault rifle (empty)
1 kg bayonet
1 kg Entrenching tool
1 kg medical supplies
2 kg MOPP mask
1-5 kg Basic load of ammunition: (US ARMY: 4-7 clips of ammo, plus 2-8
grenades)
0.5 kg Flashlight
0.5 kg Poncho
4.2 kg water (4 L in two canteens)
- ----
14-20 kg total daily carry.

Almost every soldier in the field carrys the basic load. (Some officers
don\'t, but they also tend to be REMFs.)

E-tools, if clean, also make decent skillets. They serve as a (poor)
shovel, axe, and single-leg camp-stool; they fold to 10cm x 20cm x 5 cm.

Commo, medic, and Squad Support Weapon people carry more. Most infantry
also carry ammo for the SSW trooper. Light Foot Arty (Mortars) also have
much higher basic loads. The NZA might not call it a basic load, but I
guarantee the regulars have a basic load under some identity. It\'s contents
may differ. Specific weights may vary. But there is in almost every modern
army a basic soldier\'s rerquired carry for the field, and that is the basic
load.

Oddly enough, Jesse deGraf and I have just returned from visiting Mark Cook
in Oregon, where we had the pleasure of attending a full-auto shoot at his
gun club.  Coming from California with a fairly strict level of gun
control, going 450 miles to find privately owned .50 calibre machine guns a
shock.  A *pleasant* shock, but a shock.  

ObTrav: Different law levels can mean wide differences in cultures, and
attitudes about other cultures.  Those who live in low law level
environments might find higher law levels distasteful or even threatening.

Well, in my case, that depends on what you call "Traveller".

I have rarely used Traveler rules for roleplaying , as I don\'t like using
rules for roleplaying even with goood rules, and in general Traveler rules
are not good for actual playing (though they\'re great as a basis for
character creation, ship design and wargaming )

But I\'ve used the Traveller universe conntinually, right now we\'re doing a
hybrid of Jovian Chronicles*  and T2300, as the Pluto research station
finally finish building the first stuterwarp craft, and take the untested
ship out into instellar space to avoid it being captured by an Earther
strike force...

While at any time I  may not have played in the Traveller universe for last
two or three months, expand that to six months and I almost certainly have
donme something, if only a single convention scenario someone has asked me
to run.

*something all Traveller players should read, if only for great looking
ships. Jesse, if you ever get the chance consider doing one of the Jovian
Chronicles ships, I suspect it would be damn dificult, they aren\'t
smooth-hulled like Traveller ships, more like Bab5 EarthForce ships.

Not surprising, since both scales record -40 at the same temperature.

Thats BNFL staff for you. Famous for talking bollocks (and other strange 
mutations).

Actually carbon is radioactive, this property is used when carbon dating an 
item. You measure the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 the more carbon 14 you 
have the newer it is. Carbon has a long half life (it decays slowly) but 
would still set the sensors off at Sellafield. And you wouldn\'t want to be 
there if it did!

Um, Carbon-14 has a 5700 year half life. Since the coal deposits are over
100 million years old (460 million comes to mind) there is no problem
from that cause.

IIRC, carbon 14 dating assumes that the living matter is continually
absorbing carbon 14 from the environment. A process that stops as soon as
the thing dies.

The above does not imply that I know what the source of carbon 14 in the
environment is.

Well, if Magic works in your Traveller universe, might I suggest the

"Summon Demon" is a 1st level spell. "Control Demon" should be *much*

Yeah, but aside from exporting Kryptonian merc units, can you imagine

players. 

I have this image of some PC ship equipped with a long range Phantom

I recall several times celebrating New Years at my late friend\'s place.
He was a gunsmith, and a few years he\'d comment on some of the more
distinctivesounding hardware being used in the neighborhood. At one
time he lived within hearing distance of someone who apparently owned
a BAR.

We did use guns as noisemakers at his celebrations. Aimed at the nice
*soft* ground under the lawn. I recall a few years where I dug up some
of the spent rounds later. 

But heck, a .75 cal muzzle loading rifle makes quite a bang, and you
don\'t bee more than powder and wadding. Just be careful where you point
it.

I already covered "explosives". 

But it just occured to me that some PC out the *has* to be carrying a
paintball gun with "napalm" ammo. Though I admit it\'d be more likely in
a White Wolf type game.

Not *that* gigantic. *Digital* phone lines (with their "high quality"
8kHz sampling rate) use a 64kbps bandwidth. That\'s *why* ISDN sends
data at 64k.

Record a WAV file with mono, 8 bit samples and different sampling
rates. Then try compressing the files with various archivers. The %
compression you get, times the sample rate times 8 (for the 8 bit
samples) is the bit rate you\'d need to send that quality sound. 

8k sample rates are typical phone quality, which gives the 64k data
rate.

So, let\'s say we can get 4:1 compression. 4k * 4 give 16k for the
original signal. Divide by 8 for the 8-bits gives a sample rate of *2*
kHz. That\'s kinda lousy quality.

There *is* a way around Shannon. But it\'s of *very* limited utility.
You use a code. A code symbol can stand for an arbitary amount of info.
For example, as I recall the "launch codes" for the US nuclear arsenal
are essentially several characters of "confirmation code" and 2-4
characters of "mission code". That last tells the people *which* set of
targets to go after, by telling them which notebook to pull off the
(large) shelf. So in essence, those characters "convey" a meg or so of
info. :-)

But they can only convey a few hundred different sets of info. 

You gain "density" at the cost of limiting the possible messages. If
you need to send a message not in the code, you are SOL.

There\'s at least one other story that is *very* instructive. It has a
bored "real human" gambling with an Azi. And at some point the Azi
starts sneaking sessions with tapes intended for his "mistress". And
finally, he is "freed". But it takes a *long* look at an issue that the
typical "human" in the Union didn\'t want to. What *is* the difference
between "humans" and Azi. *Are* azi "real people" (even if Union law
and customs says they aren\'t). 

Also, I think "40,000 in Gehenna" shows a glimpse of a *truly* alien
culture. Nobody who has read that book is going to claim that a
Gehennan is "human" in any sense except genetically. 

Having a few minor human races (ok, *cultures*) around that are *more*
alien than any of Traveller\'s aliens is a good way to shake people up,
but it won\'t be easy. 

Several of Cherryh\'s books are good sources for such "alien humans". So
is Donald Kingsbury\'s "Courtship Rite". I know there are others, but I
can\'t think of titles at the moment.

I missed that. If so, it\'s a wonder B-Ko got as far as she did with
A-ko. And it *definitely* explains why A-ko *isn\'t* a spoiled brat. (As
a babysitter, I\'ve often wished for something along the lines of Wonder
Woman\'s lasso!)

BTW, I remember that A-ko is actually "Aiko", and "C-ko" is actually
"Seiko", but I don\'t recall what "B-ko" really is.

The British Interplanetary Society has a *long* record of this sort of
thing. Back in the 60s or 70s they designed a *interstellar* probe
mission. One that was doable with then current tech. 

Look up "Daedulus".

Carbon 14 dating can be inaccurate see:
http://www.parentcompany.com/creation_explanation/cx8j.htm
In one case a sample of coal was dated as 1,680 years old and was really 
about 100,000,000 years old.

It\'s probably not the Carbon that\'s causing the problem. Coal in it\'s 
natural form contains a small amount of both Uranium and Thorium. When the 
coal is burnt this is released as both a gas and a solid.

Even if the uranium and thorium have decayed two of their products are 
Radium and Radon.

It\'s these elements that prevent Sellafield from having a coal power 
station.

>The above does not imply that I know what the source of carbon 14 in the
>environment is.

Carbon 14 is created in the upper atmosphere by the action of cosmic rays on 
carbon 12 atoms (usually in the form of carbon dioxide). Plants take in the 
Carbon dioxide during photosythesis and so carbon 14 gets into the food 
chain.

Speaking of photosynthesis:
The photosynthesis process requires chlorofil to be present for the 
convertion from carbon dioxide to oxygen. Does this mean that all plants on 
all Traveller planets with oxygen/carbon dioxide atmospheres are green. Or 
is it possible to substitute chlorofil for another substance and end up with 
blue/red/any colour plants that perform the same function?

SJ Games News: The Munchkin\'s Guide to Power Gaming

    [IMAGE]Coming in January:


   MUNCHKINS!

   There are those who want to play, and those who want to WIN. The whiners
   who don\'t understand "power gaming" call these people "munchkins." But
   what do we care?

   In this outrageous satire, an experienced munchkin gleefully reveals
   the tricks of the trade: everything from re-rolling an unfavorable result
   to bribing the GM. Learn how to get the most out of character design,
   and why it doesn\'t really matter what your character\'s personality is
   as long as you get to FWACKOOM! the NPCs and grab their stuff. Munchkin
   GMs get their own chapter, of course: how to control the players, bend
   the rules, and up that body count!

   Remember: If it\'s only a game, why do we keep score?

Trying to introduce single players into an existing game is difficult 
enough. With Traveller the chances are you\'ll be starting with all/nearly 
all the players being new to the background and game system.

I think a good way to start is to run the first session based in a single 
system. Pick a simple pre-published adventure, create a set of characters 
from one service and read out an introduction to the adventure that leads 
them up to the start of the action.

Run several one-off\'s along these lines and introduce each service one at a 
time introducing new concepts in each adventure. After about three of these 
you should be in a possition for people to choose their own characters and 
to start the campaign proper.

For Example:
First session run Shadows with a group of scouts sent to survey the planet. 
Read a paragraph or two describing their arrival at the system landing and 
refueling at the starport and then dump them in the action.

Second session run a Murder Mystery aboard a Subsidised Liner the players 
should be the crew (allow one to play a noble or other passenger). Have the 
captain as an NPC and order the PC crew to do the tasks aboard the ship. 
This adventure should introduce the concepts behind running a starship and 
travelling from system to system.

Third session introduce some combat with a navy patrol ship and some marines 
in a space combat/boarding action.......

After these three games the players should have a reasonable idea of 
possible characters and have an overview of the way the traveller universe 
works. You can then introduce details like alien races, etc as the game 
progresses.

I\'ve had an unexpected bit of luck in my photographing of miniatures. I have
scanned the pictures and placed them on my web page. Check them out.

http://www.icubed.com/~gemyers/sfminiatures/sfminiatures.htm

A bit of background. I wasted a roll of film using my point and shoot
Olympus before I realized that it just could not focus closely enough.

I asked my dad for the old SLR I had used as a teenager. He was didn\'t think
it was worth anything. I borrowed a +4 diopter from a coworker camera buff
to pull the images in a little closer. When I decided to start shooting I
found there was 10 year old film in the camera and used it.

So, my total cost for these shots was the price of development. Not too bad!
Especially considering that I can\'t buy a digital camera capable of taking
these shots.

Anyway, I plan to add more pictures in the coming weeks. I\'ve already shot
1/3 of the next roll. 

I need to complete some painting of some more miniatures as well. I\'ve got a
lots of TNE miniatures that will be quite challenging, including a complete
Clipper.

Let me know if you have any problems viewing the site as this is my first
foray into web page layout and PhotoShop image manipulation.

In the U.S. Army, the equipment load varies by unit (entrenching tool, 
sleeping bag, tent half w/ stakes; those are almost always there) but the 
\'basic combat load\' is pretty consistent; helmet, webgear, canteen, flak 
vest, protective mask and chem gear, primary weapon, basic ammo load for

grenadier, so I carried an M-203 - an M-16 with an underslung 40mm grenade 
launcher- and 22 freakin\' 40mm grenades. That extra 10 lbs. is a big 
difference. And it is hard to dive prone when you are carrying HE, AP, and 
thermite grenades on your chest!)

Yes, they\'re gorgeous.  I agree - the happy fun ball lifting off is really
nice.

A bit of background. I wasted a roll of film using my point and shoot
Olympus before I realized that it just could not focus closely enough.

Having just added Steve Hudson\'s notes on 25mm miniatures to the Traveller
bibliography [which I\'ve just received in the post today - it looks great
BTW though I\'m a tad biased I admit] I\'d really love to see these and see
what they look like.  I\'m sure others would be keen to see them looking as
good as they do with your painting and photography too!

Do you have any idea what RAM stands for though?

	Somebody mentioned handouts, and I am a big fan of those.
	I like to start new players slowly, possibly as hirelings
	who don\'t make any big decisions.  It might even be possible
	to role-play some missions from the PCs character generation.
	Naturally, giving the players hints at appropriate moments
	can help to get things going, perhaps through a helpful NPC.

	Easy, no.  Thoroughly discussed on the TML, yes.  Opinions
	vary, but some of the issues raised: Stars are moving relative
	to each other, should this velocity be included?  Planets are
	moving around stars, should this movement be included?  Can
	freetraders accelerate all the way to 100 diameters, then jump
	so that they will arrive headed into their destination planet?
	(this would make intercepting ships at 100D very difficult)
	If velocity is lost in jump, where does the energy go?

	My own take is that velocity is conserved if you jump into
	deep space (no substantial masses present), but the closer
	that you are to a mass when you come out of jump, the closer
	you are to conserving velocity /relative to that mass/.
	This has the practical effect that if you leave Regina at
	25 km/sec (relative to Regina), you arrive at Ruie moving at
	25 km/sec (relative to Ruie).  Of course, if the PCs want
	more detail, the velocity at Ruie might be 25.02 km/sec if
	the arrival distance from Ruie is different from the departure
	distance from Regina (I include a large random element to
	arrival location).

Canonically, Kryptonian leaders shunned the concept of space flight,
refusing to allow Jor-El to build more than the prototype that took Kal-el
to Earth.  So the munchkin colonists show up, and all their ships get
zotted into the Phantom Zone.

TSR went through a phase of producing "flip books" for their Dark Sun
adventures. The adventure came with a book of pictures to show the players 
at specified points during the adventure. Unfortunately TSR made a few 
mistakes (Jungle pictures in a desert scene, giving the plot away at the 
start of the adventure etc.) and the idea was dropped.

One of the best systems for handouts was Warhammer FRP particularly the 
Enemy Within Campaign. These adventures contained lots of letters, maps and 
clues that the PC\'s collect during the adventures. Some of the handouts 
contained obscure clues that would only make sense further along in the 
campaign, the players have to reference back to older handouts to follow the 
entire plot (it was entirely possible to play the adventures and suceed and 
never work out what was really going on).

The use of pictures and handouts can remove alot of the descriptive work 
required by the GM and help prevent misunderstandings. The only problem is 
the time taken to produce them can be a bit too much for a GM. I think many 
of the published adventures for lots of game systems would benefit from more 
handouts.

Nope.  I did a background on Norris for a campaign in progress, as one of
the characters crossed paths with him in Naval Intelligence School.  He 
becomes Duke of Regina in 1098.  In 1082, he was 18 years old; IMTU, he
did not attend the Naval Academy, but was a "90-day wonder" and served as
a junior officer in the Imperial Navy during the 4FW.  It just seemed to
fit the character better.  :)

His older brother, Willam, died in 1097.  IMTU, I invented a younger sister
as the mother of his nephew, Count Audine Garhik (Marquis Vincennes).

Ok, running through them in semi-random order:
*An Phar: minor race, no special comments.
*Aurora: traditional plot device aliens.  This role tends to be filled by
 Ancient artifacts, but no reason not to toss an Aurora into the mix.  They 
 should be _much_ less well-known than is suggested by their description, 
 though.
*Banduch: the role of \'mysterious psionic aliens\' is mostly already filled by
 the Droyne, but they could show up on a redzoned world well enough.
*Cidi: I personally do not like \'sentient tribbles\', but YMMV.
*Crystal Computers: redzone bait, but no mods needed in that role.
*Engai: having a mysterious alien race where old members of the race recall the
 Ancients (personally) is likely to do some violence to the history of the OTU.
 However, they could make for a fairly neat plot device.
*Fasanni: with their advantages, the Fasanni, once they show up in space, are
 likely to spread widely and fairly rapidly.  As such, once they show up in the
 campaign they should gradually become more and more common, sort of without
 being noticed...
*Gerodians: basically a minor human race.  Super-intelligent alien races are
 almost always a bad thing, though. 
*Gloworms: more redzone bait.
*Gormelites: does your traveller universe _really_ need wookies?  Their world
 is likely to be red or amber zoned, they\'re kind of dangerous to interact
 with.
*Irari: with a group of super-intelligent compulsive researchers around, one
 would expect TLs to rise a bit faster than they do.
*Jaril: perfectly fine minor race
*Kaa: the Kaa personality is not suited to a minor race.  To really use them as
 they are written up in G:Aliens they should be a major race with territory
 comparable to other major races.  With minor adjustments they could be a minor
 hostile state on the boarders of the Imperium.
*Kronin: basically a minor human race with a weird society.  Could be placed by
 themselves on a redzoned world.
*Liook Sujan: red-zone bait.  Of course, they\'re sufficiently inobvious that
 they could turn out to be present on just about any lightly populated world,
 and are thus Plot Devices.
*Markann: Having a TL 14 hostile alien race moving about in the Imperium would
 be fairly destructive to the stability of the Imperium, though there\'s nothing
 really wrong with using them anyway (nothing says the Imperium needs to be
 stable).  Not suitable to PCs, and their introduction would not be a minor
 plot point.
*Mmm: instant red-zone.  The ability of Mmm drones to communicate at unlimited
 distances would be very destructive to the Traveller setting.
*Memer and Saret: reasonable minor alien race.
*Pachekki: fine minor race.
*Purulu: likely to be confined to a single world; hard to use as written, the
 Imperium is sufficiently racist that the Purulu wouldn\'t be able to get away
 with their truly annoying personality traits.
*Riders: Plot device.  If they are known, they could create major paranoia in
 the Imperium.  Of course, Imperial biotech is unimpressive.  Probably a bad
 idea for PCs, though.
*Sparrials: tolerable minor race.
*Tamile: \'primitive\' is unclear in the Traveller setting.  Tamile would be an
 interesting encounter in a Far Trader campaign, otherwise probably not useful.
*Traders: the sort of thing which would be likely to be a huge issue once it
 showed up.  If I were using them I\'d probably have them appear _only_ in
 J-space (and replace their vulnerability to metal with a dependency on
 J-space).  Having giant trading ships suddenly enter your jump envelope and
 start trading would be amusing...
*Treefolk: not a race I\'m particularly fond of, but an ok minor race.
*Verms: possible red zone bait.  Verms really aren\'t powerful enough to be a
 threat to most people, though; if you want to use them I\'d up their abilities
 dramatically.
*Xenomorphs: see Riders.

Nope:  The names are written in the credits with the English letters A, B,
and C with the kanji for "ko".  The way they\'re pronounced, they would be
written as follows in kana:  Eiko, Biko, and Shiko.

Aiko is pronounced like the Grateful Dead song and Seiko is pronounced
like the watch brand.  They are real female names.  If those names had
been used they\'d have been written and prounounced that way...

The sequence takes place in SERPENT\'S REACH (an excellent novel). Another
good novel for Cherryh\'s take on Azi-Human relations is the somewhat
obscure PORT ETERNITY, which is narrated entirely from an azi\'s perspective.

No, it is A-ko, B-ko and C-ko. It\'s sort of like saying "Jane Doe".  In
addition, the title is a parody of (I think) a Jackie Chan movie.

As I recall the junk man was a retired Air Force officer. His assistants
were a washed out ex-astronaut and a first class rocket fuel chemist.  It
was a great show. He was obviously an engineer and his "junk yard" included
surplus military vehicles and such. It wasn\'t like he was using old Chevies.

And with your partners E-tool firmly placed on the opposite side of the cat
hole from yours you have all the comfort of home for depositing stools. This

IIf you look back through history youll find that about 40-50lbs has been
the lot of infantry men. The items keep changing and as one thing gets
lighter our technologies allow us to add just one more item to the list. My
suspicion for the future would be the same will hold true. For example with
in the last few years the USMC has changed sleeping bags. The new one weighs
around a kg where as the old one was several kgs. To offset this small
reduction NVGs and 4 extra magazines are now carried. Yes I know some NVGs
were carried before but the USMC didnt have near as many then as they do
now.

Im just hoping to be retired before the tents, boots, and gas mask get
lighter. I dont want to carry ladders and winches on my back so we can
always be ready in an urban environment. Though today it might be more
likely the addition to the combat load would come in the form of a book on
how the enemy are really just misunderstood good guys.

BTW add more socks to your list of equipment.

several questions.  Please answer offline, so not to take up TML space unless
you feel this a viable TML Topic.  I have seen several PBEM Traveller

give some tips.

1)  Is this an easy task?  

2)  How much more time will this require compared to other session preparation?

3)  How easy are "chat" systems to use during gaming sessions?

4)  How often do you "meet" to play?

5)  I don\'t have a web site, do I need one?

6)  If a web site is recommended, where should I go to get the space?

7)  What is the minimum space I can get away with?

If there are any readers in the ABQ area that are interested in face-to-face,
feel free to drop me a line.  I\'ve got one bite right now, but schedules
don\'t match.
There may be another, but his phone has been changed.  I really feel the need

	Chlorophyll is the most important photosynthetic pigment
	found here on Terra, but there are other pigments involved
	in many species.  The various colours that leaves take on
	in the fall, in temperate climes, are caused by these
	pigments.  I would expect to see photosynthetic structures

That\'s putting it mildly.

Carbon-14 dating is a rigorously validated means of measuring the age of
organic materials within the age ranges it handles well (this is
dependent on the size of the sample, as the larger the sample, the
larger detectable amount of C-14 is present, the older the sample can be
dated.)

HOWEVER, the technique does not differentiate between carbon deposited
while the organic material was alive and carbon deposits laid down on or
in the sample later (colonization by fungi and bacteria, foex), and
since the typical samples come from rather complexly contaminated sites
(aka \'dug up out of the ground\'), proper sample handling is paramount
for an accurate result.

Those \'inaccurate\' dating citations on that creationist website are all

Oh, yes we have an equivilent, I was just wondering what "basic load" 
meant, as Doug\'s Imp Army\'s 40lbs seemed much lighter than I would have 
expected. Looking at your list (which is about what we\'d have called 
FSMO, less the NBC gear, plus more wet/cold weather stuff) it still 
seems light, high TLs notwithstanding.

    In cyberpunk 2020 you can get piantball rounds that contain flouro
marking dye, acid, gas or drugs. The acid round is historically used in
automatic mode on Munchkins who adamantly refuse to let thei PCs go to the
shops without their MetalGear clamshell armour.

    Call of Cthulhu must be the undiputed kings of the handout world, which
is just great if you lose one of 26 handouts and you want to run the
scenario in another 10 years. I recommend zip-lok bags stapled to the book.
One of the things that PCs seem to really like is a nice map, NASA has some
fantastic pics that can easily be altered to fit the game and printed. A bit
of Technish print layed over the top and it really adds to the game and the
pics quite often suggest little ideas that spice the world up.

I am sooo envious. There are a few full-auto collectors clubs here, but 
they actually get to fire their guns very seldom (you need to be on an 
Army range, with special permission from the police, etc, etc), and the 
meets are very poorly publicised.

worlds just to use/purchase weapons they normally aren\'t allowed?

The idea is a bit older than that. TSR did it with Tomb of Horrors and
Expedition to the Barrier peaks, and probably some others. I\'m not sure that
it would be the same without the divine works of some of the earlier TSR
artists, specifically Erol "Ool" Otus.

It was a fantastic idea, and it worked really well with those two modules in
particular. Then again, Tomb of Horrors is my favorite adventure of all
time, although the sheer coolness of Expedition to the Barrier Peaks should
not be underestimated.

 Nope.  I did a background on Norris for a campaign in progress, as one of
 the characters crossed paths with him in Naval Intelligence School.  He 
 becomes Duke of Regina in 1098.  In 1082, he was 18 years old; IMTU, he
 did not attend the Naval Academy, but was a "90-day wonder" and served as
 a junior officer in the Imperial Navy during the 4FW.  It just seemed to
 fit the character better.  :)
 
 His older brother, Willam, died in 1097.  IMTU, I invented a younger sister
 as the mother of his nephew, Count Audine Garhik (Marquis Vincennes).

As long as we\'re telling weather habituation stories,
let\'s not forget my college classmates who came from
Ghana and Nigeria and were suddenly confronted with
their first Pennsylvania autumn -- "how can you stand
this horrible cold?" they asked, as the temperature
hovered around 60F.  They were wearing down jackets in
September.  I don\'t know how they survived December
and January.

These guys would need some adjusting without changing the terrain of

I\'ve thought about using them IMTU as part of the group of powers that
fight the 3I
in the \'general war\'. Figure they have 1-2 dozen systems packed with
high population.
My problem has been where to put them....I want them reasonably close to
the SP

think of is
towards the core either in the Vargr extents or on the other side of
them. Having them

side of the
3I. Suggestions?

Definitely not a problem south of the boarder.  Here in the States (at least
in my state) a pager or cell phone in school is an instant suspension, just
like a weapon. They\'ve carried it to major extremes of ridiculousness, (as
is always done by bureaucracies.). Which means you can\'t even leave your
pager in your car on school property, or have a car installed cell phone
without getting into trouble. (I won\'t even go into the two honor students
that were expelled for weapons and drugs, one had a pair of scissors in her
purse, the other an aspirin.)

carries in her vest become major liabilities. Especially when it\'s explained
to them that all of the signs, clearly  posted and written in the local
lingo - variant Tagalog, say that such devices are prohibited. Of course
anyone can tell you that it would be fair to try to fine or imprison the
PC\'s since they couldn\'t read the signs. After all everyone knows
bureaucracies are fair. :)

Not in California-- I see kids walking in and out of schools with
cellphones and pagers all the time.

But I myself was not permitted entry into an amusement park (Great
America) until I walked all the way back to my then-husband\'s car with our
keychains, removed the mini-knockoff Swiss Army knives, the longest blades
upon which were 1.5" long, and locked them in the car.  A folding knife
with a 1.5" blade was considered a weapon, despite the fact that it\'s
really no good for anything other than cutting tape on boxes and slitting
open envelopes, etc.

The nice thing about living in places where it doesn\'t snow is that if you
really want to see snow, you can go where the snow is, look at it, enjoy
it, and leave.

I personally do not want to see snow at any time other than the morning of
December 25th.  I certainly do not want to see it on the nights of 12/24
or worse yet, 12/31, when people are enough of a danger to themselves on
the roads.

Is there a little shop where they could "deposit" their Solomani Pocket
Tools (HEY! I LOVE that designation) prior to entering the local government
building? The task to find one better be difficult, unless one of the PC\'s
knows something about Tagalog, in which case it\'d be routine. ;) :)

There has been a few discussions of Nobility on this list, and the subject of
how you organise noble titles with a vast population of nobles has arisen
before. There seem to be two main options proposed:
     1. Increase the number of noble ranks past "F";
     2. Distinguish between local nobility and Imperial nobility.

I\'d call the first option the the quick and dirty approach. It may work, but has
drawbacks - mainly due to its simplicity. The second option, I think is the
better - and more canonical - one.

Note that the term "local nobility" can be confusing. Here\'s the canon (boom!):
"Local nobility represents the Imperium in systems not administered by high
nobility. These nobles make up the majority of the Imperial nobility, and
although they are only equivalent to barons and knights in precedence, they are
hereditary members of the peerage."

This allows the second option to be drawn out a number of interesting ways.
First, the local nobility can have local titles that sound more impressive (ie.
higher in precedence) than their Imperial title. Heaven forbid if you address
them by the "lower" Imperial title in the context of their own local
jurisdiction - and conversely, you would never find them officially addressed as
anything other than their Imperial title when off-world (or at least out of
their local context).

If you are worried that this makes the Imperial bureaucracy look too telescoped
together, think of it like this: Cleon _imposed_ this system on the Sylean
Federation. He is portrayed as being a canny politician, so you could suppose
that he made up a system that is simple enough to keep track of (ie. has only a
few levels), but has complicated-enough qualification rules that keep the new
(and intendent) nobility quarrelling about their comparative status rather than
seriously vying for the Throne itself.

What you can also suppose is that extra-Imperial worlds used to have local
nobility or rulers with fanciful titles ("tzar", "emir", "king", "potentate",
etc etc). When these worlds were integrated into the Imperium, the local ruler
was either given a place in the high nobility with an imperial title (such as
Marquis, the ruler of a single world), or simply retain their local title but
are only considered - in Imperial precedence - as equal to an Imperial Baron.
The only local title that the Imperium would frown upon keeping is that of
"emperor" (a bit like the army captain being brevetted to "Major" aboard a naval
vessel - you can only have _one_ of those aboard ship, y\'know... ;-)

This enables you to have a universe which, like reality, is not cut-and-dried.
Entire campaigns could revolve around proving that one local noble line should
be granted Imperial stature, or hunting down the correct lineage of a noble
family, or performing such tasks for a noble patron that are designed at raising
their Imperial precedence.

There you go, Loren! Three adventure seeds for the new book! ;-)

Well, I figured I could make them into a client race of the Markaan, and give them a jump gate into some world in a convenient location, with their true homeworld way beyond the Imperium.  This allows them to have military forces completely out of proportion to their apparent size.

Urrr, not really.  Technically the Solomani Rim War was a civil war.

According to _Behind the Claw_, he was invested as Duke in 1098.

Hey, the last time I was at one of those, I very nearly had to strip
down before they finally conceded that it was the button on my pants
tripping the alarms.

To be fair, they\'d had an incident the week before where some banger
stabbed another banger, so they cranked up the sensitivity on the metal
detectors to \'Absurd\'...I wasn\'t the only one getting caught by the
things. 

Besides <assume meanacing psycho voice> I know 250 ways to kill you with
a tiny knife blade like that...

Of course, most of them involve things like: "I slit the tape holding
the box with the loaded mac-10 together", "I use it to strip the wires
on the detonator for the C4", "I \'accidentally\' drop it from LEO on
you"... so they\'re not likely to be applicable in all situations...

Dunno about that, when the Brits decided to drop our joint spaceflight program
at Woomera, P.M. Menzies agreed on the grounds that we should only produce wool
and wheat...

Man - that annoys me! We were testing salvaged V2\'s and had advanced to
producing "Blue Streak", then they came and broke them and the gantry\'s etc up
for scrap. Oz could have been making a fortune on satellites by now.

I said *old style*. Before that atrocity of a movie, and before Brunner
and company re-wrote the entire history. 

Krypton *had* space flight. At least as far as one of their (several)
moons. And they didn\'t wear togas. Instead they wore colorful outfits
and the men wore these neat headbands.

The problem was that there weren\'t any other planets in their solar
system. Hence Jor-el had to go straight from "local" spaceflight to
interstellar flight in one leap.

Actually the "toy" "computer microscope" from Intel/Mattel, the QX-3
should be able to do miniatures shots quite well given the shots they
show it making. Looks to be capable of "macro lens" type shots on down
to (low power) microscopic. 

I\'ll be checking the toy stores *after* Christmas.

I don\'t know if I\'d give it to the PCs right away;
after all, they might all just be killed as soon as
they opened it, like in the movie.  Maybe it should be
a race between the Solomani, who want to use it in the
next Solomani Rim War, and the Imperium, who send the
PCs to steal it back?

Which is why one of the "Biblical literalist" arguments against carbon
dating is such a bad joke. They gleefully point out that a sample from
a plastic comb reads as half a million years old. 

Well, actually, it readfs out as "older than we can measure". Which is
reasonable enough given that the carbon in plastics comes from coal or
oil and has thus been dead for milions of years. <sigh>

Cosmic rays converted N-14 to C-14 at a fairly steady rate. Tree ring
matching has let them calibrate the scale back to around 10,000 BC.
There aren\'t any trees that old, but they can match growth patterns in
the inner rings of old trees with patterns in the outer rings of
stumps. Then you match the pattens in the inner parts of those with
older stumps. 

From this, they\'ve determined that the cosmic ray flux *does vary
measurably on thousand year timescales.

There are organisms on *earth* that use something other than
chlorphyll. But they tend to be "primitive algae, as chlorophyll is
*very* efficient, even though it reflects light near the peak of Sol\'s
light output curve. 

But with different stars and different environments, other chemicals
*are* possible.

Those pigments are always there, but they *don\'t* take part in
photosynthesis.

Wavelength isn\'t as important as you\'d think. Remember, chlorophyll is
green because it *reflects* green light. And that\'s practically at the
peak of Sol\'s emmission spectrm (ie the strongest single wavelngth in
the mix).

If momentum is conserved by jump, then your velocity upon entering jump
*relative to a given object* will be the same as your velocity upon
exiting jump relative to the *same* object. Thus the question about "do
planetary orbital velocities count" is irrelevant. 

If you measured relative to the planet you left, then on exit you\'d
measure relative to the position and velocity the planet had when you
jumped, not it\'s current velocity and position (both of which have
changed in the intervening week).

Don\'t forget that the time you spend in jump *varies*. That means that
if you aimed for a spot at the 100 diameter limit of the destination,
but emerged a day early (or a day late) the planet will be a *long*
ways away. For example, earth orbit\'s the sun at 30 km/sec. So in 24
hours it moves 2.6 *million* km. That\'s several hours away in normal
space.

Which doesn\'t help, because conservation of momentum requires that the
before and after values be measured in the *same* reference frame. If
you teleport from earth (at rest with respect to Earth) and arrive at
rest with respect to Mars, you have to explain what happened to the
difference between the orbital velocities of Earth and Mars. You also
have to explain what happened to the difference in potential energy
(Earth is a lot deeper in the sun\'s gravity well and the surface of
Mars has a potential in it\'s *own* gravity well that\'s equvalent to
being one hell of a long ways above the surface of the Earth. And then
there\'s the differences in angular momentum.

Alas, since the two planets are almost certainly moving at different
velocities relative to each other, this *doesn\'t* solve the problem.
You still have to account for *that* velocity difference. 

In other words. you pick a reference point at the *start* of a
calculation and you have to keep measuring relative to that *point*
during the entire calculation. Since planets are moving in *curved*
paths, you can\'t use them as the reference point for any calculation
covering a period during which the change in the planet\'s velocity
vector is significant. It\'s *definitely* significant over a week!

On the other hand, while stars are orbiting the galaxy, their orbits
are so long that *stellar* motion (in non-binary systems) can be
considered to be "striaght line" over periods of *years*. In binary
systems you use the center of mass of the system as the reference
point. 

So you can measure the ship\'s before and after velocity using one of
the star\'s as a reference point (or even a third star). This means you
need to know how fast and in what direction the stars are moving
relative to each other, and how fast the ship was moving relative to
the reference star. 

If it comes out of jump with the same velocity, then you get to convert
that into velocity relative to the target star. And then into velocity
relative to the target planet. 

Simplest dodge is to assume the stars are stationary with respect to
each other. In actuality, they might be moving at 50 km/sec relative to
each other. Give or take 10 or 20 km/sec. :-)

Then you have to worry about motion of the planets. Since Traveller
uses "flat" maps so much, we might as well assume that the orbital
planes of the planets are aligned. It makes for easier calculations,
that\'s for sure!

So now you need to worry about *where* in it\'s orbit the planet is.
After all, in midsummer it\'s moving with the same speed as in
midwinter(well, usually), but in the *opposite* direction.

And the same goes for the destination planet. And it\'s unlikely to have
the same length year. 

It\'s actually fairly *easy* to add up all these velocity vectors.  Just
take a sheet of paper and *draw* the first vector. Make a starting
point and draw an arrow in the proper direction, with a length equal to
the speeds (say 1 mm for every km/sec of speed). So if the planet is
moving 30 km/sec at a 45 degree angle to rimward, draw a 30 mm line at
a 45 degree angle to which ever direction on the paper you\'ve decided
rimward is. Now, let\'s say the second planet is moving at 23 km/sec at
75 degrees to rimward. You place the ruler at the *point* of the first
arrow, and lay it at 75 degrees to the rimward direction, then draw an
arrow 23 mm long. Finally, lay the ruler between the *start* of the
first arrow and the *end* of the second one. The speed is the distance
between those points. And the direction is the direction of the line
between them. 

If there are more vectors (say you have the stars moving relative to
each other) just add them in as more arrows. Just be sure that each new
arrow has its start (tail) at the *head* of the previous arrow, and
that you measure angles relative to the *same* side of the paper for
all the arrows. Then just draw a line from the tail of the first arrow
to the head of the last, and that\'s the sum of all those vectors. 

Believe me, it\'s one *hell* of a lot simpler than trying to *calculate*
all of the vectors!

I am sooo envious. There are a few full-auto collectors clubs here, but
they actually get to fire their guns very seldom (you need to be on an
Army range, with special permission from the police, etc, etc), and the
meets are very poorly publicised.

I just watched "Raiders of the Lost Ark" again last night. Anybody got
it on tape? If so, what\'s the serial number stenciled on the crate with
the Ark in that last scene? The *exact* text of the labeling would be
nice too. A GIF, or PNG (or even a JPG if all else fails) of *just* the
crate with the stencilling showing would be a nice bonus.

Why? Well, I flashed on the salvage thread.

The PCs have found an *old* Solomani ship, say from the period of the
original wars with the Ziru Sirka. It\'s obviously intended as a *fast*
secure courier. The crew is dead (some accident). And there\'s this old
(at least a century older than the ship) wooden crate in the hold. 

It\'s got something stenciled on it in what may be an old version of
Galanglic. It\'s rather cryptic.

Yes. *That* crate. :-)

Not necessarily.  Space, after all, is not flat.  If the ship
failed to make the turnover, then perhaps it got
redirected by one or more of the dips (gravity wells) in
the road.

Coincidence is the stuff that legends are made of.
Maybe it even made a great circle and the ship made the
turn-over it missed the first time around!

Reminds me of a time back in my college days, where one
of the local public library branches had a library
assistant from Australia visit on a six-month exchange,
from mid-June to mid-December. She came to talk to our
class one time, Library Science being my field of study.
Later that fall we had class sweatshirts made for ourselves,
and had a few extras made. One, we gave to the visiting
Australian. This was in early November. She remarked that
this was a very appropriate gift, what with how cold it
was getting -- temperatures down around -5 C (about 25 F).
The branch head librarian, who was with us when we gave
her the shirt, remarked "This is nothing -- wait until it
gets down to minus 40!" The Australian library assistant
almost choked on her coffee on that one...

(It didn\'t get down to -40 until about six weeks after she
returned to Australia...)

Doug asked:
>Was Norris Duke during the Fourth War?

No, his father was.

I think it was suggested somewhere that nobles are not allowed to use
anagathics, but I think this is just a cop-out. Better - for flavour, if not for
stability of succession - to have the kids growing impatient and trying to bump
off the old man, or having abdication as a common method of succession.

I think it\'s my F*&^^ing Proxy. It seems that I can use my browser to get 
there and download files one at a time. However, I wanted to download 
several files, and the proxy is bouncing REAL ftp traffic from clients such 
as ftpvoyager. Oh well, point and click, point and clickkk, point and (say 
this is really tiring)

You can save that half a byte till later.

    These abdicated Dukes would make interesting patrons, powerful in a
behind-the-scenes-way. The sort of Patron that PCs could devote working full
time for as they may have very interesting (and lucrative) agendas of their
own that may diverge from the official Ducal agenda considerably.

E2TBP was the first AD&D adventure I was ever in, which meant that things were
*really* confusing!! First, this was the first time I had *ever* done this
strange thing called "roleplaying", and second, it was in a metal dungeon!! The
Daleks were nasty... (yes our GM was a ratbag and threw them in, just after we
had watched whatever the latest Who/Dalek episode was).

Later in life, we played E2TBP as a _Traveller_ adventure... set on Utoland,
while Heinrich Volkstrangler (SEE my Library Data entry) invaded the planet.
Tell you what though, having a battle computer makes it easy to bypass those
bloody door passcards!

Actually, from memory, someone at Menelvagor LIC still _has_ some of that
shielded power armour... just don\'t hit it with a laser, the (afore-mentioned)

Well, consider the cost.. Assume that the world you want to purchase
weapons on is J-1 away.  That\'s Cr. 16,000 at least to have a fairly good
chance of living through the journey.  After that, there\'s the problem of
residency.  I can\'t just cross the border into Oregon or Nevada and go
shopping, the dealer will want to see my ID.  It\'s a violation of federal
to knowing sell an illegal firearm, and since whatever toy I\'ve come all
the way to another state to buy is probably banned in California (which is
the safest state in the country, just take a night-time stroll through East
LA!) they can\'t sell it to me.

In Traveller, I think customs would be very curious about people making
short trips to lower law level worlds.  Baggage searches would be common.

Suddenly remembered one of the funniest moments of my military life.

We were doing MOUT exercises.  The Company CO had promised a day off on the
next Friday for the squad with the fastest time in getting into a second
story window.  This normally entails throwing a grappling hook through the
window and climbing up.  As we went along, the average time was hovering
around six or seven minutes.  The First Sergeant called for one of 2nd
Platoon\'s squads, who had vanished into the tree line about 20 meters away.

They appeared at a dead run, carrying a 12 foot long tree trunk that they
had trimmed the branches off of, leaving short stumps.  Two men took cover
positions while the rest of the squad swarmed up this improvised ladder
into the room.  Total time, about 45 seconds.

Needless to say, they got the day off.

Well, consider the cost.. Assume that the world you want to purchase
weapons on is J-1 away.  That\'s Cr. 16,000 at least to have a fairly good
chance of living through the journey.  After that, there\'s the problem of
residency.  I can\'t just cross the border into Oregon or Nevada and go
shopping, the dealer will want to see my ID.  It\'s a violation of federal
to knowing sell an illegal firearm, and since whatever toy I\'ve come all
the way to another state to buy is probably banned in California (which is
the safest state in the country, just take a night-time stroll through East
LA!) they can\'t sell it to me.

In Traveller, I think customs would be very curious about people making
short trips to lower law level worlds.  Baggage searches would be common.

In the closing credits of the edition i\'ve seen, they had both A-[kana
glyph Ko] and Aiko. It was a subtitled version, released in the US.

I\'ve seen another version, english dubbed, but with all the credits in
Nihonjin. That version also had the A-[Kana Glyph Ko]

I\'ve seen shelves with at least two other releases for the English speaking
consumer; thus a total of 4 different  releases... I wish I owned (rather
than borrowed) to be able to cite more properly.

IMTU, most nobles will. The Holy Grail fo my traveller munchkins is an
industrialized TL16 LL0 world with lots of wide open spaces.

On the other hand, I once let a player design a custom weaapon suite for
his BD Mercs (Don\'t ask... Please... Suffice it to say Xen and Hamford DO
know the Guy in question.)... The result, a TL15 2mm (2x20mm DU Slug) HVSB
Carbine and Pistol system, done under 3G3... a DU 2x20mm slug, propelled by
near max safe caseless load (TL15 powder, calc\'ed by 3G3 methods as
3G3TL17), stepping out at Mach-8 at 1atm.... Pen was ridiculous, Damage
(MT) was 3 if soft armor or no armor and 8 otherwise. As a ballance factor,
I had the pistol throw 2m of flame, plus a sonic boom from hell. The
Carbine was only marginally better, having still almost as much wase
energy, but more accuracy. After reversion to MT stats, the differences
were concealability and atten differing. Sig was (by GM Fiat) VHigh...
hardened ear protection required (MT Dmg 1 if not, per shot). The Carbine
was equipped with a Full Auto selectable reciever; the pistol was semi
only. Prices were set unrealistically high due to VERY low demand, but it
could effectively negate TL15 BD... if you could hit it. Also, the
extremely compact ammo meant high volumes of ammo in the basic load.

Yeah, sorry, I said that badly, what I meant is that as soon as you have to
start using the rule system for combat, especially space combat,  and such
it tends to bog down.

No argument there.

The thing I liked about it was that just using the system as written (i.e;
without having to fudge it ) we managed to run a space battle between two
squadrons of mechs and fighters in about forty minutes.

I\'ve tried similar things in Traveller, and we had to basically ignore the
starship combat rules to get anything useful done in a reasonable time. Not
that this is unusual, I suspect most people don\'t use the starship combat
rules unless they\'re specifically looking for a wargame, but the thing is
that in JC you don\'t have to avoid the rules.

And they work to a level of detail that made the roleplaying part fun. The
guy who blew up the enemy mech only to have his own thrusters and most of
the torso of his mech destroyed in the ensuing ammunition explosion. The
enemy mech who lost all thruster control, who we captured and brought home
by tossing him between us like a large football.

Yes, there were quite a few die rolls, but they were simple ones, and so did
not get in the way of the roleplaying part of the combat.

Part of this may have been was the whole idea of fighting in humanoid mechs,
you can\'t give the finger to an enemy while flying a fighter and expect him
to see you, but when you do it in a 30m mech, he\'s likely to get the idea.

There is also a good set of choices in combat for players, making the combat
as much part of the roleplay as everything else, you can characterize by
your combat choices.

However, the JC scenarios do tend to emphasize combat, and don\'t provide a
lot of scope for roleplaying except when "off-duty", or in special
situations, pretty much like the old FASA Star Trek rules and scenarios
didn\'t lend themselves to roleplaying, unless you weren\'t a part of Star
Fleet.

Yeah, which is exactly why I went for this period with this JC/T2300 mix, as
T2300 can give me all the near star info and planetary descriptions, the
Kafers, etc, and T2300 actually does have mechs, though not quite as big and
versatile as the JC ones.

The big differences will be the political set-up, as JC doesn\'t have the
same political background. But as I\'m running around the "First interstellar
flight" time, that won\'t matter much.

	Apparently you had much fun. I noticed that there is one major
	difference between the weapons used in Oregon and those we use
	in Finland. Because of local regulations are encouraged (not
	required yet) to use suppressors (because guns cause "noise
	pollution"). Currently all my guns (except a Benelli M3 shotgun)
	are suppressed.

	An image of my favorite "toy" can be found at:

	http://personal.inet.fi/business/reflex.suppressors/jati.jpg

	Another nice gun can be seen at the last image of page:

	http://personal.inet.fi/business/reflex.suppressors/50cal.html

	There might be much variation within a given Traveller Law Level.
	In some countries suppressors, bayonet lugs, folding stocks or
	other accessories might be completely banned, while in other
	counties they might be compulsory.

Actually it\'s kinda neat - we have a nice christmas in the summer with 
the barbie and all, and then in the winter we have a "Mid-winter 
christmas party" to celebrate at the "right" season. We still don\'t get 
snow, though - just lots of wind and rain (just like the rest of the 
year).

We have this strange effect here: A perfectly legal hunting weapon can 
be turned into a Military Style Semi-Automatic (MSSA) just by someone 
bringing a large magazine (by itself perfectly legal) into your house. 
What\'s more you (in the event the police find out), the unlicenced 
owner of a now MSSA must prove that you had no knowledge of its status 
as an MSSA or you\'ll get to lose the "right" to own _any_ firearm, or 
to even handle one under supervision. It\'s amazing how the accessiories 
make the gun.

I\'d love to see how they\'d handle one "gentleman" I once met. He had a
rather unusual piercing. With a ring that must have weighed several
pounds. *NOT* something easily removable, and definitely "below the
belt. 

I have this image of him in the line and them "localizing" the signal. :-)

It\'s long enough to cut the jugular. What move do you need?

Of course, I bet they allow little old ladies with 18 inch steall
knitting needles in. *Those* things are dangerous!

Well, if they\'ve got brains (I know, *big* assumption) they\'ll check
for any documentation accompanying the crate *first*. Or if one of them
has anything *approaching* archeological skill/experience he won\'t let
them *think* about touching it outsie of a lab for free of damaging
whatever\'s in the crate or contaminating the artifacts. 

Or maybe one of the characters is a Levite? :-)

The universe doesn\'t *have* a great circle as a possibility unless it
is *closed*. Currently that looks kinda unlikely. 

Even if it *is* closed, the length is *billions* of parsecs. In fact,
there\'s no good reason that it\'d even be *close* to the diameter of the
*visible* universe. Thanks to inflation, the universe could anything
from ten times that to a trillion or more times that.

You need to read some of Nick Pollota\'s "Bureau 13" books (Based on the
"Stalking the Night Fantastic" game)

Try a "scenario load" alternating:

Holy water
napalm
hydrofluoric acid
DMSO mixed with garlic, MSG, silver nitrate and some nasty toxins
	(garlic for vampires, MSG because in high doses it gives almost
        *anyone* crippling migraines, silver nitrate for weres, toxins
        for the obvious reasons and DMSO so it\'ll all spread thru the
        body *fast*)

At the start of one of the books, a character is lamenting the fact
that he *didn\'t* have a LAW with him *merely* some grenades. He\'d been
on the way to the corner deli to pick up lunch. 

Bureau 13 is a lot like the Men in Black, except with a far more
liberal hiring policy. You survive an encounter with the "paranormal"
(which includes extraterrestrial encounters) and you are eligible.

It might be fun porting them to the Imperium. Their teams are as crazy
as most PC teams. And probably both sneakier and better armed. :-)

But given the way Traveller has worked for all these years, there won\'t
*be* residency requirements for off worlders. And any searches will be
as you try to leave the port\'s extrality zone at your destination. 

Well, if the world is really high tech, and low law level, then the
port might search folks coming back in. Maybe.

So, somebody had the brains (or historical knowledge) to re-invent the
scaling ladder. That\'s how they did it during medieval sieges. And
frankly, if you know in advance you\'ll need to climb a wall or into a
window and there are tress around, it\'s the *smart* way to do it!

Unless, of course, you aren\'t supposed to leave traces behind. :-)

You just reminded me of an *old* TV show that could easily be
translated into Traveller, especially in the Spinward Marches during
one of the Frontier Wars, or maybe in the Solomani Rim.

Better yet, make it in a sector that gets occasional Vargr or Aslan
incursions. Nothing *really* serious, but enough to require *some* sort
of military presence. Only occasional danger to get in the way of
gambling, black marketing and other profitable undertakings.

The show? "McHale\'s Navy". 

Have the players need to get something and McHale is their contact for
the black market. Or he\'s going to smuggle them across the lines. Maybe
they got caught by Bighampton or his aide, and need to convince McHale
to spring them. Or maybe Mchale got caught and the players have to
convince the admiral that he\'s innocent.

McHale and crew would liven up any system or subsector. And just about
*any* of the shows can be turned into a quickie subplot or encounter. 

Heck after a few encounters, just noticing that McHale or one of his
patrol boats is in the same port ought to raise the paranoia level
considerably. Sure, whatever he\'s up (if he\'s even up to anything)
*probably* won\'t affect that players. But leaving port quickly will
seem like a *really* good idea. :-)

I *wondered* why I never heard of Woomera being used for anything. That

Check out formulas for calculating loans at differing interest rates.
Plug in the principal (cost of ship minus the down payment), the term
(40 years), the payment interval (monthly) and solve for the interest
rate. I expect that you\'ll be surprised how *low* it is. The more
payments you make (actually the longer the period you make them over)
the more that interest eats up. Your early payments can be 90% or more
interests with only the remainder actually reducing the principal.

I think that holy water would be considered impure (and no longer holy)
if mixed with fuel, not to mention poison.

The very few and small organisations that want to kill vampires are
often themselves influenced by vampires, and used as tools for
destroying other vampires. Teaching them the ultimate tricks would be a
Bad Thing (TM), since they just might tell others. Giving them a honkin\'
big gun and pointing them in the direction of an enemy might destroy
that enemy anyway.

What do you find annoying about the system? The rules or the setting? If
you feel the need to write a long reply, please send it by private mail
instead of to the TML.

> shouldnt that be "Dead Action Vampire"?

Actually, there is a bigger one in another of WW\'s products... Live
Action Wraith...  ;-)

They even discovered that one themselves... it is noted on the book in
question... on the cover.

All this talk about vampire hunting has me thinking:  Has  anyone
tried doing a conversion of the TV series Ultraviolet?  I\'ve been
considering adding that to my Traveller campaign.

For those who haven\'t seen it yet it includes ...

- - charcoal-like carbon dum-dum bullets  fired  from  conventional
  autopistols and MP5s

- - Alycin (sp?) gas grenades  (Alycin  is  supposedly  the  active
  ingredient in garlic that vampires dislike)

- - the idea that  vampires  have  no  reflection  is  extended  to
  include all recording/transmission mediums ("surveilance  is  a
  bitch")

- - this last point means that the hunters have little  TV  cameras
  with LCD screens mounted on the  side  of  their  handguns  ...
  anyone they see with their eyes who  dosen\'t  show  up  on  the
  screen is a vampire.

Trivia:  Apparently a US-remake is  being  considered  but  early
indications are that the parties involved have confused the noir-
style for \'romantic\' ... standby for  a  repeat  of  the  US  Red
Dwarf.

Yes, indeed.  Only one of many Kids in the Hall sketches & characters

Any Traveller game or campaign I ever try to run is going to prove to be

If you do, make sure you include an encounter with missionaries from the

Sure.  After all, we started out fighting for our rights as Englishmen.

	From Life, the science of biology (Purves et al, 1992):
	"Here we discuss pigments that play roles in
	photosynthesis... Of these, the most important are the
	chlorophylls." "...all photosynthetic organisms possess
	accessory pigments that absorb photons intermediate in
	energy between the red and blue and then transfer a
	portion of the energy to chlorophyll..."  Interestingly
	enough, while all known Terran photosynthetic organisms
	have accessory pigments (such as carotenoids and
	phycobilins), not all of them have chlorophyll.
	Photosynthetic halobacteria use a derivative of retinol,
	called bacteriorhodopsin, rather than chlorophyll.

	Peak wavelength of absorption for chlorophyll a is about
	430 nm (blue-violet) with a lesser peak at 670 nm (red),
	for chlorophyll b the peaks are at 455 nm (blue-green)
	and 640 nm (red-orange) respectively.  The overall 
	perception of light that is not absorbed (including 
	primarily violet, green, yellow, orange, and red light)
	is green.  Accessory pigments absorb light effectively
	at other wavelengths, but green light is absorbed less
	than most other visible wavelengths.  The net result is
	that photosynthetic machinery is better at using some
	wavelengths than others: this varies by species, but in
	a water plant (/Anacharis/) efficiency is highest for about
	430 nm (deep blue) and 680 nm (red-orange), with a low
	around 550 nm (yellow-green), and it almost ceases at
	about 725 nm (near infra-red).  Since the photosynthetic
	machinery depends so much on the wavelength of available
	light, it is fair to say that wavelength is important.

	If velocity is conserved relative to the star, then the

	That depends entirely on how you want to bend the physics.

	This argument only works if "jumpspace" works in a certain
	way.  IMTU, masses such as planets warp jumpspace and
	influence reentry into normal space.  Thus, there is a
	tendency to come out close to the planet.  Even so, it is
	not unknown for ships to arrive much further than 2.6 million
	km from their destination (depending on pilot and nav skills,
	various DMs, etc.) IMTU.  This is not a problem for me.

        Hi, Leonard!
        
        Given a random sampling of loan values and tweaking appropriately,
for example:

        480	number of payments
        100	loan value  (MCr)
        0.42	payement  (MCr)

        I get a result of ~0.33% Interest Rate.  If you work on a 1%
interest rate, you wind up with payments of MCr1.01 for the above loan.  For
7% (a good house mortgage) you get MCr7 per payment.

        Looks like the Imperium is *VERY* in favor of trade between planets,
to the point of subsidizing interest rates.

the loan amount is 80MCr, you forgot the 20% down
according to Excel, RATE(40,-5,80) (40 years, 5MCr/year, initial value 80MCr)
gives an interest rate of 5.5%

        Odd.  I just ran what you posted and got a "no solution" condition

        However, that is a very attactive rate, nonetheless.  The economy

One other thing, your rates are per month.

I wouldn\'t call a mortgage of 7% per month "good"

Just sharpness and skill.  Actually the carotid is a
better target (it\'s an artery, so more blood will be
lost more quickly leading to quicker unconsciousness
and death, as opposed to the jugular, which is a
vein).  Both are protected by slippery and thick
sheaths (I\'ve forgotten what they call the stuff that
surrounds blood vessels -- myolin or something), so a
very sharp blade is essential.  You also have to know
where to cut.

From what I remember of the cinema version the very last scene, prehaps
after the credits, shows the crate with the US stencil being burnt off from
the inside as if to say "You are not even the goods guys." (no offence).
This doesn\'t appear on the video versions I\'ve seen and the TV versions want
to get on with the next programme too much.

  I believe that the figure in question is one of the Grenadier products
for CT. Nice figs, and 25mm is easier to find other SF figures in these
days, but there seems to be no compelling reason for the current owner
of the Grenadier catalog (Stratelibri?) to re-license for a production
run, even if they still have the masters.

Yes, but not *that* good. <g>  0.33% is a periodic interest and you
are using monthly payments. The *yearly* rate (12 months) is 0.33*12,
or ~4%.  And if you reduce the balance by a 20% downpayment up front
the rate jumps to ~5%.

IMTU banks offer other rates for loans covering other periods. Shorter
loans generally have higher rates. The rates also vary, as do rates in
the real world.

IIRC Pachekki are supposed to be into raw live food; maybe like Jabba\'s

Pachekki

I\'d say the Solomani Rim War was a pyrrhic victory. The operation was a
success but the patient died. Yeah, they formed their own state, but Terra
fell under Imperial control!
At least the Solomani got Earth back in 1120!

This in general implies several things:
1)  inflation is very low in the Imperium.  Canonical suggestion is that it is somehow magically zero due to definition of money.
2)  starships are considered \'low risk\' loans; the rate the bank makes on its loan is roughly equal to the interest rate (5%) - the failure rate.  Thus, if ships fail at more than 5% per year banks lose money by making loans.  For commercial banks, it\'s unlikely they want less than 3% return on investment, which suggests that the loss rates for ships (including pirates, incidental damage, theft, etc) is less than 2% per year.  It also implies that merchants either don\'t go bankrupt very often, or that ships have a very low rate of depreciation.

Jim, this is a very good thought!  Not only that, these retired
nobles (wouldn\'t necessarily all be dukes, either) would have
both the time and the wherewithal to actually go out on the
adventures that seem to be fairly typical for a campaign - the
\'active patron\' kind of thing.

Californians (Granolans <g>) are definitely \'and so on\'.
Besides, there\'s a _slim_ chance that you\'ll get snow in December
in California; it is, after all, winter there.  However, snow in
summer (as it would be in all of the [southern hemisphere]
countries I named) is entirely unlikely.  Even in Tierra del
Fuego.

The appropriate references for Poul Anderson elves are the novels THE
BROKEN SWORD and THREE HEARTS AND THREE LIONS (both from Anderson\'s early
period, written in the 50s and 60s).  They were described memorably in
Alarums and Excursions once as "Bastards, but competant bastards."
Generally speaking, they were immortal, souless, good fighters and wizards,
lecherous and invisible to humans, hated trolls, enslaved dwarves, but
could not abide cold iron.  

obTrav, the GURPS Trav espionage and nobles books should probably present a
feel similar to Anderson\'s Flandry novels.

Excellent stuff, Glenn! Permission to swipe these pics
and manipulate them a bit? My own photoshop skills are
not up to much, but I daresay I could cut out the
backgrounds and replace them with a
starfield/planet... Great for my campaign!
Failing that, we could just say they\'re pics of landed
craft, taken from a space satellite...

Kyle asked some friends in bilogy and they told him:
Well, we expect alien worlds to have alien
biochemistries, so make up what you like. In terms of
what already exists on earth, though, the human body,
for example, processes a small amount of sunlight, and
these compounds have no real colour. You could also
postulate a world with higher than earth levels of UV
radiation, so that plants must get a "tan", ie have a
protective coloured coating to stop the chlorophyll
being degraded. Additionally, photosynthesis may be
dominant here, but not on other worlds. Here on earth
in deep ocean trenches there are plants that survive
on heat (since no light can get there), called,
believe it or not, "thermosynthesis". Surely similar
plants could exist on the surface of a world? And
there\'s no colour restrictions.
For an interesting story of an alien ecology and some
earth colonists\' interaction with it, see, Larry Niven
and Jerry Pournelle\'s, "The Legacy of Heorot." I
highly recommend it.

Well, this is what we call "Control rating 5" in the
GURPS worlds: "_Repressive_: There are many laws and
regulations, strictly enforced. Taxation is heavy and
often unfair. What civilian weapons are allowed are
strictly controlled and licenced and may not be
carried in public. There is strict regualtion of home
computers, photocopiers, broadcasters and other means
of information distribution and access."
Oh woops, I\'ve been reading the proposed Internet
Regulation Act, and new Weapons Act... 
1.5" of steel can kill, though. Two inches penetration
anywhere on the torso or neck will kill the person if
left untreated. For that matter, you can kill a perosn
with your thumb, just stick it in their eye and kind
of slush it around inside. However I doubt too many
people would have the stomach for that! 
"Guns don\'t kill people, people kill people." But
there\'s much less sweat involved with guns!

Yeah, well, Menzies was a Control Rating 6 politician
in a Control Rating 2 country, he was a twerp. Guys
like him like to keep the nation dumb and illiterate.

Anyway, it just proves my point: the Commonwealth has
always had the brains (I _didn\'t_ say, "brainy
politicians"!) the USA the resources.

Anyone else seen advertised "Babes With Guns"? It\'s a
video of bikini-clad lovelies firing at full-auto
somewhere in the California desert... funny thing to
get excited over, I would think, but an essential
handout for anyone GMing the magnificent rp game,
"macho women with guns".

ObTrav: What constitutes porno in the 3I? Is there a
"Interstellar Enquirer"? If so, what kind of stories
does it have? I mean, today\'s story of "Woman gives
birth to alien carnivorous goat!" would make the
average traveller say, "yeah, so what?" 
Is there a place for tabloid journalism in the 3I?
Loren, those nobles, do they get bothered by
paparazzi?

Porno will always exist, I\'m sure. IMTU, on a trading
station (rather like Babylon 5) there\'s a brothel
called "Exotica Erotica" where you can, um, "spend
time" with all sorts of alien types. We don\'t go into
details, but hey, "it was an experience", as they say.

"Tell me you never touched the Bug, man," says one PC

Finland, what a glorious nations, where the most
repressive gun laws are noise pollution laws! Wow! And
yet their murder rate is lower than California\'s? I
wonder why?
Come to think of it, hot nations tend to be more
violent than cold nations (Germany invaded Russia
during the _summer_, for example, not to mention the
Middle East)
Any theories on why? Maybe too much sun on their heads
makes peopel crazy? Or maybe in Finalnd and
Sqitzerland it\'s just too smegging cold to go out
murdering people....

For the record, I always thought that "Babes With Guns" video was pretty

be wearing high heeled shoes.  As for the bikinis, well, if it\'s hot out
they can wear whatever they want ;)  Seriously, as I said it was pretty
silly.  No woman shooter I ever met, and I\'ve met a few, would ever do such
a thing.

The two girls that really enjoyed themselves were NOT paid for shooting, and
actually had to pay to shoot like everyone else.  I always enjoy seeing
someone new to shooting sports, MALE OR FEMALE, enjoy themselves and get

Anyone else seen advertised "Babes With Guns"? It\'s a
video of bikini-clad lovelies firing at full-auto
somewhere in the California desert... funny thing to
get excited over, I would think, but an essential
handout for anyone GMing the magnificent rp game,
"macho women with guns".

ObTrav: What constitutes porno in the 3I? Is there a
"Interstellar Enquirer"? If so, what kind of stories
does it have? I mean, today\'s story of "Woman gives
birth to alien carnivorous goat!" would make the
average traveller say, "yeah, so what?"
Is there a place for tabloid journalism in the 3I?
Loren, those nobles, do they get bothered by
paparazzi?

Porno will always exist, I\'m sure. IMTU, on a trading
station (rather like Babylon 5) there\'s a brothel
called "Exotica Erotica" where you can, um, "spend
time" with all sorts of alien types. We don\'t go into
details, but hey, "it was an experience", as they say.

"Tell me you never touched the Bug, man," says one PC

Hey, it gives flavour to the universe, don\'t flame me

Surely you\'re getting some compensation in stock and stock options.
That should lead to a windfall and escape potential fairly soon.  As
much as I like you, Jesse, I always encourage anyone who wants to to
leave the Bay Area, because that\'s one fewer person competing with me
for local resources.  By the way, what\'s your housing situation like? Is
it something I might be interested in when you go?

Ob Traveller:
The original character generation systems (at least) mentioned feelings
about one\'s prior service, depending on how the generation system had
gone, as a part of character development.  If the prior service did not
involve a lot of travel, feelings about a particular place would also be
an important part of role-playing a character.  ("Chirpers!  why did it
have to be chirpers? I hate chirpers.  I thought I\'d never see a chirper
after I left Vanejen."  "Man, I hate being out here in the boondocks.

Hehe, who said "gun toting maniac" was an insult? I
was in the army, myself, always enjoyed carrying the
M-60. A fellow gunner said, "they say the average life
of a machine-gunnere in combat is - what? 40 seconds?

Never saw it, myself, just saw the adverts. But as I

what will be porno and tabloid in the 3I? What will
turn them on, make them laugh, shock them into saying,
"they shouldn\'t show that on holovision"?

That\'s the whole democracy-type thing of the internet:
a chance for any Joe Shmoe to soap-box!:)

Always wondered, though, if Jefferson would\'ve written
the 2nd Amendment if there\'d been around AK-47s
instead of just muskets that took a minute or two to
load and were lucky to hit a man at a hundred yards!
Anywya, are you sure that "the right to bear amrs, the
right to form state militias, shall not be infringed",
doesn\'t mean, "the right to bear arms, _that is_, the
right to form state militias, shall not be infringed"?

There must be heaps. All those colony worlds. In
GURPS: Space, a resource rich planet will have its
population increase by a factor of 10 every ten years.
If there\'s no extra immigration after the first lot,
there\'s going to be an awful lot of kissin\' cousins...
In a Harry Harrison book there was mentioned a fellow
that was so egotistical, he wanted a whole planet of
his own children, so he spent years collecting nubile
young women, some voluntary, some not, and taking them
to his own planet, impregnating them along the way...

Based upon what I was taught while a history major:

A Civil War is when one government temporarily becomes two or more, and
they war with each other.

A Revolution is when one government becomes two or more, and go to war,
with at least two of the governments surviving at the close of hostilities.

A Rebellion is when subjects of one government try to replace it by force.

A Coup is when a Government is replaced by another government. Sometimes
the result of a Civil War, sometimes politics alone.

Ob Trav: The Solomani Rim War is definitely not a civil war. It resulted
from two extant governments having their ties severed with force. The
Confed was  (pre SRW) the Solomani Autonomous Region. It was a subject
government... and it was, in a sense, a rebellion, but not really a civil
war.

Ob US: The US War of independance was a revolution... The two governments
that resulted have remained independant.... but it was a rebellion as well.

Ahh, the joys of the innaccuracies of the English language, and the prolems
of Jargon...

Ah, so _that\'s_ where the game "Liftoff" (Task Force

I would expect that the IN is not the only recipient of Academy graduates. I
would expect many, if not most, to become officers in the Colonial and
System Navies. Except for the Academy at Capital, which would primarily be
limited to members of the aristocracy (In Traveller this means Nobles and
Rich Kids from the Megacorps.) I would also expect that certain Academies
have reputations for excellence beyond their own sector, perhaps even being
good enough to lure students from other Domains. This would depend on their
ability to attract well known and admired ex-IN and Colonial Navy Officers
and Chief Petty Officers as instructors. The best will even have their own
ships for training purposes.

The full mantra as I was told is

"If it moves, salute it.
If it doesn\'t move, fix it.
If it can not be fixed, paint it.
If it can not be painted, polish it.
If it can not be polished, through it overboard, it\'s no good."

This keeps the promotions going in the ranks becouse of all the Chiefs and
Petty Officers going over the side.

I suspect it\'s more of a homogenous society issue than a temperature issue.
It\'s easier to kill those who are not like us than those who are like us.
When Main Street was WASP, violence was low, gun violence ***on Main
Street*** was low. We won\'t go into gun and other violence in the dock or
other districts. Columbine (sp?): the preps were outsiders and killed member
of groups from which they were either excluded or feared, the popular
athletes and the born again Christians.
To ramble on I saw an interview of a Mafia informer, Basco I think it was.
The interviewer asked him if he was sorry about the men he killed, because
they had families, wives, children. His answer? "Why should I care? I don\'t
know them."  When we know our neighbors, when they\'re our friends, we don\'t
shoot them. When we don\'t know anyone who lives on our block, in our
building, on our cul-de-sac, then it\'s easy to see how someone already prone
to violence might find it even easier to "take out" some one "He doesn\'t
know." Plus it\'s harder to hell who the little bastards are who would have
no trouble doing it.
Of course none of this matters to people who don\'t think anyone\'s life has
value anyway.
How to fix the problem? Short of doing it the Zhodani way, I don\'t know.

Yep, and it has been touted that in theory, Australia could have been a
leader in space technology as some of the equipment designed and made
Downunder for Woomera, was more state of the art than ANYONE else in the
world had.  But the Pom\'s wanted it broken up and it was sold to the U.S.
and France mainly... However, not knowing to much more on the subject, said
state of the art equipment could have been a portable radar consol with a
built-in esky to keep the beer cold, or a missile launcher/BBQ array?  ;^)

My character was an Imperial Naval Officer and some of his interests
involved ancient Terran music. When he approached a group of Elvis
neophytes, they bopped him upside the head and took him away. The next thing
he knew he was exposed to constant Elvis music videos, gyrating men and
women, and he couldn\'t get away. Three weeks later an Imperial commando team
rescued my character and the Navy sent him to a deprogramming camp. This all
happened during character generation! As a result, he lost the skill
opportunities for one year!

Smegging right it\'s flamebait! Excuse me, but
similarity with small differences causes more violence
than _great_ differences. Just look at the
prtoestant-christian bollocks in Northern Ireland, the
Sunni-Shiite conflicts, the various Sino-Soviet wars,
China\'s invasion of Vietnam, Vietnam\'s invasion of
Cambodia, etc etc etc. 
It may be psychologically and socially _easier_ to
kill those who are very very different, but the
differences can often cause puzzlement rather than
aggression. Aggression comes from offence at their
_slight_ differences. If someone is _completely_
different, we\'ll just concludethey\'re too weird to
understand, or bonkers, and won\'t get angry. But if
they\'re _almost_ the same, but not quite, we\'ll be
offended at the difference, eg "those buggers over
there in East Belfast believe in Jesus, but don\'t like
the Pope, how dare they?!!!" as opposed to, "those
weirdoes in Beijing neverheard of Jesus."

Similarity, and understanding one another, can cause
hideous conflict.I quote Douglas Adams, "and thus the
poor Babel Fish, by enabling every species in the
universe to communicate with one another, went on to
be responsible formore wars and genocide than any
other thing in history."

From Kyle,
who thinks a little confusion can be a good thing.

Did he also get drunk, and wake up married to a hooker

ObTrav: what are the marriage laws in the Imperium?
Are they all local, planet based? As well as helping
chase you for your ship mortgage payments (yeah,
right) will the IN hunt down those skipping out on
alimony payments? How many wives/husbands can you
have? One in every port?;)

Of course. Aussies wouldnever go anywhere without cold
beer (southern hemisphere strength, please!).
The yanks took golf clubs, but the Aussies would leave
behind crushed cans of VB/XXXX/Cooper\'s....

I wonder if the HMASS Melbourne would be better
piloted than the HMAS Melbourne was (which Aussie
ship, for ten points, sank three ships in its career,
two Aussie and one USA?)

That *really* sucks. Shit, it wouldn\'t have hurt to just mothball the
Launch sites. Even "Abandoned in Place" would have been better.

ME:

They found a rocket last year just poking out of the ground near Woomera -
almost completely vertical. 

Funny.

BTW; I dunno about other RPGing Aussies, but I always got a thrill when we
got a mention in games thanks to places like Woomera - I think Ringworld by
Chaosium had us Australians as space fightin\' heroes thanks to the facility.


We\'re legends.

Do any AUST\'s remember crazy Joh from QLD with his plans for the world\'s
biggest spaceport at Cape York?

Oh yeah. RE the Southpark Episode with Starvin\' Marvin and the spaceship.
Didn\'t you love how the CIA  said \'We hope that no backward country gets a
hold of that vessel\' then it cut to Australia. 

Bastards. 

I\'m still living down the Simpson\'s episode; "Coff-ee" "Be Er" etc.

The missing Mars probe was one of the possible causes discussed on TV over
here when it happened.

A few months back we also had what was assumed to be a meteor re-enter and
blow up in plain sight.of much of the notthern part of country  At least two
people took videos of it.

Current tech is straining it a little; Daedalus had a
laser fusion drive; we can\'t even build a laser fusion setup
that gets out more energy when its on the ground filling
several entire buildings.

And Daedalus was automated in spite of a hundred-year

that can manage to land on Mars...

It kept going after crazy Joh, from what I remember,
but got bogged down in land rights issues, ie the
local aborignes didn\'t like the idea of bloody great
rocket stages crashing on their ancient burial
grounds, or something. Officially it\'s still going as
a project, though.
Anyhow, essentially it\'s been decided that sea
launches from old oil rigs (thanks to Boeing) are a
much better idea.

Any aussies here remember the "Multi-Function Polis"

state wondering where to put it...) Any wild idea went
(raspberry sound)

If I had my way, when the Chinese arrive on the moon
in about ten years, they\'d find an aussie in a bright
blue spacesuit waiting for them, with cold beers and
hot snags for them.

We got the technology, why not? It\'s no crazier or
more expensive than hosting the Olympics!

40 seconds is also about the time needed to blow through a single 100-round

Not to put a damper on this, but you also have to make some comparisons.

                Finland           California
Pop Density   40.6 sq/mi          190.8sq/mi
Ethnic Mix    Finn 93% Swede 6%   White 69%, Black 7%, Asian 10%, Latino 25%

So you have a much more homogenous population spread far more thinly.

A friend of mine recently put it to me that gossip was
the source of language, and came before it. After all,
it doesn\'t take more than a chimp\'s brain to be able
to see a mating couple, nudge your buddy on the
shoulder and point with a grin. Gossip, he said, was
the source of language and the mortar of society,
since it allows you to improve your social position,
be aware of changes in political structures, etc etc.
Nowadays, he said, "gossip is the herpes of language.
Almost everybody has it, and you can\'t get rid of it."

That was such a cool little phrase, I\'ve been dying to
have a chance to use it since. The relevance is that
journalists are a scourge of humanity, and deal only
in gossip, but irrelevant gossip. Since it\'s
irrelevant, they have to make interesting, and so,
well, make it up.

And a couple racist psychos they think is more
interesting than a couple psychos.

So, I repeat my ObTrav: what will tabloid journalism
look like in the 3I? Will paparazzi chase the
Emperor\'s family, photographing them wandering about
naked on their space yachts, speculating if they\'re
gay, etc? What will be too shocking to print or show
on holovision?

Well, I must be different from the average, then, I
never sent off for one. But then, I never sent off for
a copy of Das Kapital from the back of International
Socialist Weekly, either (I like to read the stuff

I\'d go with the low rate of depreciation. You *don\'t* give 40 year
loans on equipment that depreciates noticably over that period. 

This goes with my contention that there ought to be 100 and even 200
year old ships in service. If the TL goes up, they get shipped of to
areas that are still at the lower TL.

Kenji, 

Be nice. Or Mistress Olga will quit letting you visit the R&D section
of the dungeon. :-)

Ok, that tells me something I didn\'t know. *But*, it also says that
they *transfer* the energy to Chlorophyll. My guess would be that they
act like the phosphors in fluorescent tubes and absorb certain
wavelengths and re-emit them at others more suitable.

So they *aid* photosynthesis, but don\'t do it. The bacteriorhodopsin is
a different matter.

What I meant was that it\'s more important that there be enough energy
at wavelengths the pigment can use, than what the overal frequency
composition is, and it\'s *especially* not that important where the
emission peak is. 

*Efficiency* at converting available light into sugar is more important
than sensitivity to specific wavelengths.

I think you forgot the 20% down payment mentioned above.

A=p*(1+(r/n)^nt   compound interest formula (I found it on one of my
		  math "cheat sheets")
A=total amount paid
p=principal (80% of price in our case)
r=rate of interest (%/yr)
t=time (number of years)
n=number of periods per year

A=(80 MCr/240)*480=160 MCr
p=80 MCr
r=???
t=40
n=12

160=80*(1+(r/12))^480

Obviously, (1+(r/12))^480 must equal 2.
2=(1+(r/12))^480
take the 480th root
root480(2)=1+(r/12)
root480(2)-1=r/12
12*(root480(2)-1)=r
r is approximately 1.7%

Alas, this *doesn\'t* jibe with the idea that each 10 years of payments
gets an additional 20% of the ship paid for. So it looks like the
Imperium uses *simple* interest on ship purchase.

Ok, let\'s try *that*.

(I\'ll skip the calculation)

r=2.5%

That\'s a *bit* better. 

So for simple interest, here are the relevant formulas:

I=interest paid (total)
P=principal (amount borrowed)
S=total amount paid (I+P)
r=interest rate (5% = 0.05)
t=time expressed in years
p=monthly payment

I=Prt

S=P+Prt

p=(P+Prt)/(t*12)

So if you pay extra at some point *and the mortage allows it* then you
can recalculate payments from the above.

While I despise the television news for a variety of reasons, and while the
did saturate the airwaves with a hell of a lot of misinformation and things
they made up in the newsroom during Columbine[1], I don\'t think that the
blame can be placed entirely on the media for getting the facts wrong. They
were relying on first-hand accounts from the students and there were a hell
of a lot of things that the students said which apparently didn\'t happen.

[1] MSNBC had the most absurd coverage. When the term "goth" began to get
bandied around by the students at Columbine, the MSNBC reporters ran...
right to their dictionary. There was a hysterical piece up on MSNBC\'s
website about how goth was a movement influenced strongly by the brutal
Gothic barbarian tribes of the dark ages, and how the goths hold Gothic
architecture in high regard.

It looks like a web-based emailer.  The Date header on the messages are

It should look more like

Check out "The Broken Sword", and "Three Hearts and Three Lions". The
former gives you a good idea of why Elves were *feared* in the Dark
Ages. The latter gives you a nice "scientific" look at elves.

For example, iron is incredibly toxic to elves[1], so they use various
exotic alloys, where they\'ve used magic to extract the metals. They
don\'t like sunlight because they are highly sensitive to UV. 

This leads to things like an Elflord carrying an odd dagger with a soft
blade and *wide* bell guard. The blade is *magnesium* (which gives off
*lots* of UV while burning). The guard would protect his hand from the
light. He\'d likely protect the rest of his body by throwing his cloak
over his head.

[1]Gee. Elves find iron to be very toxic. And UV is bad for them. They
are supposed to be an incredibly ancient civilization. 

So, we can deduce a planet around a much redder star, and with few
heavy metals. That means a *second* generation star, which makes their
culture *billions* of years old. No wonder they have "magic" tech.

I suppose so. If you must.

But as I noted in another message, stop and consider a major *drawback*
to your setup. 

If my vector is pointed at the planet I\'m leaving, then when I exit
jump, it\'d be pointed at the destination planet, right? 

This makes it almost *trivial* to play nasty games with near c rocks.
Accelerate in one system, where there\'s nobody who cares, then jump to
the target system and cut loose the payload.

I was just trying to make sure that folks understood that conserving
velocity relative to *different* objects *was* "bending physics".

I can accept people bending or breaking the laws of physics in games or
stories. But only if they *know* they are breaking them, and have
thought things thru. Otherwise, the law of unintended consequences
tends to jump out and bite you. :-)

Well, I\'m making the (reasonable, in my opinion) assumption that you
"aim" your jump for a specific *location*. That is, you in effect tell
the computer, we want to go *this* distance, in *that* direction. And
if you don\'t misjump, you exit jump at the target point plus/minus a
bit for uncontrollable "random" factors.

This fits in fairly well with Mark Miller\'s statements that if your
jump "line" intersects the 100 diameter limit of anything between your
entry to jump and your planned exit, you pop out of jump there. 

He hasn\'t answered my question about *when* you pop out of jump. You
see, if you work it out, there could be a planet in the way for only a
few hours. So it matters if those few hours occur when the ship is in
that part of the jump. 

For example, assume that you move along the line at a steady rate. That
means that if the planet is half way, and "hits" the jump line 3.5 days
after you start the jump, you\'d get precipitated out of jump. Except
that means your jump only took 3.5 days.

If you assume "instant" jump, with your ship sitting at the far end
until the "jump buble decays, then the planet crossing the jump line
shouldn\'t affect you unless it crosses the line at the moment you jump.
And if you sit there until 7 days later, you may need a while to find
what it was that dumped you there!

There are a *lot* of unanswered questions, and every answer breeds new
questions. 

Whatever way folks decide to handle things, it needs to be *logical*.
Not merely arbritary decision stacked on top of arbtrary decision. That
leads you into situations where you have to make more and more
arbitrary decisions because *previous* decision have logical
consequences that contradict each other. 

Even non-scientific players start gettung upset when they come up with
clever things that are consistent with what they\'ve been told the rules
are, and get told that it doesn\'t work that way.

BTW, my best reason for going with "real" conservation of momentum,
rather than having it conserved relative to the star/planet at each end
of the jump is that the latter makes it *possible* to run a ship up to
near c velocities then jump it into another system and have a good
chance of being aimed at the target planet. All they have to do is be
aimed at the planet they are jumping from. They\'d come out aimed at the
planet they are jumping to.

If you *don\'t* want that to be possible, then you need the vectors to
work differently, and the easiest way is to use "real" physics.

Nope, state militias and even the "unorganized militia" are *no* the
intent of that amendment. 

You see, it\'s a matter of record that there was a motion to insert the
phrase "in the common defence" after "to keep and bear arms". The
motion was voted *down*. 

That makes claiming that the right was intended to be limited to
bearing arms in the common defence rather difficult. 

You also have to remember that Jefferson and others are on record as
having stated (essentially) that if the government got out of hand, the
people were *supposed* to overthrow it by force of arms!

The Second amendment says no such thing. it reads:
"A well regulated milita, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
Ammendment 2 to the US constitution, as presented in "A History of the
United States Since 1856", R. N. Current & G. J. Goodwin, 1980.

It does not specifically enable state militias, nor require that one be in
the "well regulated militia" to keep and bear Arms. note the capitalization
of State. In general, the capitalized singular form refers to a
Nation-State, not to a member of the union, in most interpretations. In a
strictly libertarian view, it becomes enabling for any person to own any
Arms; More realistically, it means that citizens shall be allowed to own
Arms. Interestingly enough, I\'m not aware of any arguments in federal
courts challenging the 2nd ammendment on the basis that Arms (Capitalized)
means Patents of Arms or Achievements of Arms, thus heraldric devisings....
which was still the common terminology at the time written. However, any
who doubt that the framers intended all citizens to bear arms should read
"The Federalist Papers" by Publius. Publius is a pseudonym for Ben Franklin
and Two Other Framers....

Quite right, William, like getting nine "others" to
interpret it. Do you think a group of nine would all
interpret it the same way? Or might they argue amongst
themselves? And then if you changed the people in the
group, they might go the other way in interpretation,
going on a majority view? I\'m referring, of course, to
your own Supreme Court (gentle tease, just pointing
out that a differing opinion from the common one is
not necessarily caused by my being a foreigner)

Very cool, more than a little rough, with some missing links, but very
cool!  I don\'t think I\'d ever considered "War of the Worlds" as a RPG
setting, but it would make a killer setting.

It\'s been decades (feels wierd being able to say that) since I read the
book, and I don\'t really remember much of anything about it.  However,
looks like a great start at a setting there.  Of course there are other
possible settings also...

There is the Orsen Welles setting of the 30\'s, the Movie Setting of the
50\'s, and the TV setting of the late 80\'s/future.  The TV show sort of
combined the Orsen Wells/Movie and the TV show into a timeline, that would
let you construct a pretty detailed background as long as you could hack
the wierd Movie/TV tie-to-gether.  The 50\'s Movie setting or the Future TV
setting would both be good settings in this timeline.

Actually an entire HG Wells sourcebook would be a cool undertaking!  Or
even a sourcebook based on the movies based on his works :^)

	There are two sides in each coin.

	We have to apply for a license for each gun separately, and it 	
	always includes a background check (it takes one week). The 
	recent changes in Finnish gun laws made it more clear what is 
	required for gun license application.

	Basically, if a person can provide a "legally acceptable 
	reason" why he needs a certain type of weapon, the license will 
	be granted (you can\'t apply a machine pistol for "duck 
	hunting").

	If the applied weapon is very unusual, the local police will 
	refuse the application ("wash their hands"), and the application 
	must be re-send to the district headquarters. As far as I know, 
	the district headquarters has not refused any reasonable 
	applications.

	Because of EU legal homogenization, we now need a separate 
	license for purchasing "dangerous" ammunition. Various types of 
	expanding and fragmenting bullets are considered dangerous (this 
	comes from German gun laws), but the ERVA license can be 
	obtained very easily (it took me ~3 minutes of talking).

	The net effect of tightened gun laws was that we need one more 
	license, and can buy just about any weapon if we can provide 
	reason for buying it.

	(Err... sorry about this rambling. Legal/political/social
	issues are largely beyond my understanding. Back to Traveller)


	In Traveller I have assumed that starship crew and passengers 
	need either local or "general" gun license (depending on local 
	Law Level) if they want to carry personal weapons when they 
	leave the ship.

	In Imperium the imperial nobles might be considered as being 
	"above" the local laws, but in Solomani Confederation I have 
	assumed that there is a kind "Confederate gun license" which 
	allows the holder to carry personal small-arms within the 
	confederation (SolSec personnel would have this kind of 
	license which supersedes the local restrictions).

I think I can disagree - but can I bring this on topic?

Tricky...

Firstly, I would offer that the main reason that people
have wars with those who are similar but with small
differences is that they are fundamentally...

	...closer!


England has a much longer history of wars with Scotland
and France than it has with China for this reason.

Similarly, the Thirty Years War in Europe in the Seventeenth
century involved much larger armies than the conquest
of the "New World" in the Fifteenth because they didn\'t
have to move those armies across a few thousand miles
of ocean.

However, I think you\'d agree that man for man, the
armies in the "New World" affected far more people.

ObTrav...

Did the attitude of the forces involved in the Fifth
Frontier War change once the Corridor Fleet arrived and
we no longer had a border skirmish between the Marchers
and the Zondani "the enemy we knew and loved" but
instead had the revenging hordes liberating the Marches
from those mind rapists?

That\'s because Congress keeps cutting NASA\'s budget, just like they did 20
years ago with the space shuttle. If NASA were given its just due, it would
certainly be capable of properly designing spacecraft to do the job RIGHT.

The URL is:

However, you\'ll have to hit "Reload" repeatedly until you get page to
display more than the ad banner.  I don\'t know why this is, I just tried
it until it worked.

Yeah Mick, I remember him... never liked him, but he WAS a clever bastard
(Invented the most successful peanut harvester! True!).  His Spaceport has
lived on with consecutive Queensland governments other than his own.  The
thing that really stopped it was Aboriginal land-rights issues on the cape!

And I have to admit, I like a laugh, and takin\' tha mickey out of ourselves
gives me a chuckle too... I laughed so hard last night when that episode of

I\'ve also visited the page. For background music, may I suggest none other
than the 1978 soundtrack to "The War of the Worlds" by Jeff Wayne! Includes
Justin Hayward\'s "Forever Autumn", probably one of the most beautiful modern
love ballads ever produced.....

I suppose it\'s a good thing I never mentioned the 8" skinning knife
I used to carry in my purse regularly.. including to amusement parks,
etc.  I like to have a good sturdy work knife for opening boxes, cutting
string and gutting fish.  (That\'s how I pick a knife: will it be handy
for cleaning a few dozen fish. Cleaning fish was the one task I did with
in knife in my childhood that was exhaustive enough to really show up 
deficiencies in grip design, blade style, etc.)

Either that, or they got ahold of some of Count von Sexbat\'s more
whimisical alt.gothic FAQ entries on handy ancient Gothic phrases 
("Help, there\'s an axe in my head!").  I seem to recall that the
same FAQ disavows any connection between modern Goths and gothic 
architecture, which means the newsies must have read it--they frequently 
get sources backwards.

(To avoid confusion, this is a late eighties, UK based tale.)

A story told by a co-worker about her problems with amateur dramatics.

The play called for the use of some fake weapons. Not wanting to leave
them at the theatre in case they were stolen (IIRC the press at the time
were running lots of stories about crimes committed with fake weapons)
each of the cast took one of the weapons home.

So she had a pistol in her bag.

The next day she had a meeting in the QE2 building in London,
which has/had scanners at the entrance. She explained everything to the
security people before going in and they were happy that it was a fake.

Unfortunately, the next time she had a mmting in that building,
she forgot that she was carrying a fake hand grenade in her bag.

For some reason, the security people wouldn\'t let her prove that the
grenade was a fake the easy way.

Likewise the first time.

Did you check that the payment is -5 (*minus five*) instead of just 5? 

That confused me for a bit.

Little known detail. The Supreme court hasn\'t ruled on a second
amendment case since the 30s. And that one doesn\'t really count because
the defendant had died by the time the case got to the court, and his
defense didn\'t submit *any* arguments to the Court.

And in that one the ruling (regarding a law about sawed off shotguns)
was that since it wasn\'t a MILITARILY USEFUL WEAPON it could be
outlawed. A first year law student could have shown that shotguns *are*
"militarily useful", but as I said, the defense lawyers just wanted to
get the case over with.

Since then the court has *refused* to hear any appeals involving the
second amendment. And it\'s part of the law that just because the SC
doesn\'t hear an appeal does *not* indicate that they favor the
arguments of *either* side. 

The only way to *force* them to rule is if two *different* federal
districts make rulings about the same federal law that contradict each
other. So far, in spite of lots of efforts, nobody has managed to pull
it off. 

So all we can determine from the record is that the court hasn\'t ruled
on the matter. Though it seems a *strong* possibility that the court
wants no part of this mess.

Rather like "obscenity". The current standard is showing more and more
holes, mostly because the "community standards" bit is resulting in
communities in one part of the country convicting people in *other*
part of the country for "violating local community standards", for
things like BBSes and web sites. Convicting a couple running a BBS in
California for violating the standards in *Tennessee* (they didn\'t do
*anything* in Tennessee, the folks in Tennesssee had to call *them*,
long distance!) is just one example.

The court wants no part of this either. 

In both cases, ruling *either* way will severely upset *huge* numbers
of people. And forever change a fundamental aspect of American society.

In the former, they will either have to rule that the 2nd says "no law"
and *means* "no law", throwing out thousands of laws across the
country and enraging the anti-gun forces. Or they\'ll have to rule in
some manner that agrees with the really quite severe restrictions many
places place on weapons. And convince all the fringie militia types
that it reaaly *is* time for a revolution, since the Constitution is
being ignored.

Likewise, in the latter cases, it\'s pretty unlikely that they *can*
rule in favor of the current laws. And the current standard pretty much
used up the "wiggle room. If they rule on free speech versus
"obscenity" they have exactly two "viable" options:

1. make a *national* standard and set it to the tastes of the most
   liberal places in the country. 
2. finally discard the whole concept and state that it\'s nobody\'s
   business what an adult reads or watches.

They *can\'t* rule that we are all stuck with the standards of the
*strictest* places in the country. The rest of the country would simply
pass a law stating otherwise. And frankly, the fact that they\'d *had*
to go from a "national standard" to a "local" one way back when shows
that a *strict* national standard won\'t fly. 

But going with 1 or 2 will convince the "moralists" that "Satan has
taken over". And again we\'ll have major sections of the population
ready to revolt.

OBTrav: Does the Imperial government ever run into this sort of
problem. Cases where no matter *how* you interpret the law, large
population segments on a planet will be upset to the point of riot or
revolt?

Not wanting to get into gun control (OT flamebait). However, historically,
the US was not a gun owning society to any great degree from the end of the
18th century through the first half of the 19th century. Through this
period, private gun ownership was relatively rare, guns in private hands
were generally poorly maintained, the militias were, with minor exception,
a joke, and their was no culture, even in rural areas, that especially
valued guns, with the exception of a handful of hunters and trappers. The
evidence for this includes
two gun ownership surveys performed at the state level and tens of
thousands of wills that either do not list guns (which at the time were
_very_ expensive
relative to income) or list them in damaged condition.

Gun ownership in America took off after the Civil War, when a combination
of industrialization made guns much cheaper, wartime taught millions of
Americans how to shoot, and units permitted firearms to remain in private
hands after the war.  The result was a post-war mainstreaming of rifle and
shotgun ownership.

obTrav:  Any war with a massive civilian call-up in an era where firearms
are both issued and retained by soldiers post-enlistment is likely to have
a huge effect on law levels in the region unless strenous steps are taken
by the government to control arms afterward.  This is especially so for
civil wars.

In Traveller, we have an interesting situation where free traders and other
civilian starships are heavily militarized, with private ownership of very
heavy ordinance.  I suspect that this is a tradition that dates back
directly from militirzation of shipping following the Long Night.

Let\'s not give NASA too much credit here. NASA is a great example of now
NOT to run a space program -- it\'s so over-laden with bureaucracy that 
anything it does is inefficient and costs way too much. The typical space
shuttle launch has a ground crew in the neighbourhood of 20,000 people.

If transatlantic plane service were run like the shuttle program, there 
would be one flight per month, there would be delays of several days if
there was so much as one little thing wrong at startup, and a ticket would
cost a million dollars.

I say it\'s time for private enterprise to get into the game.

Mind you, the spectacle of China sending someone to the moon may give
the US space program the wake-up call it needs...

I like having 100-200 year old ships IMTU, but most of them by that
point look little like they did when new. I was influenced by the Han

a different jury-rigged repair - sometimes with very different technology

I believe when you say "Framers of the Constitution" you can count right
in the 56 signers of the declaration of independence who quite rightly
said:
<and to think I stayed out of the biblical arguments!>

[We hold these truths to be self evident...]
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it 
is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new 
Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its 
powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their 
Safety and Happiness. [... do not do this lightly, but when a]long train of 
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a 
design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is 
their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for 
their future security

They appear to be saying in the beginning that it is the "Right" of the
people to throw off a government destructive of "Life, Liberty, and the
Pursuit of happiness", but when after a long train of abuses it is not only
their right, it is their duty, and furthermore their duty to create further
guards against future abuse of such governments, such as the Bill of Rights.

	As someone pointed out, similar cultures tend to be
	physically close, which makes direct conflict much easier.
	I would also suggest that a culture that is very similar
	to yours can be more threatening: a Budist in a Christian
	parish is probably less likely to convert people away from
	the local church than a rival Christian denomination.  That
	being said, we Terrans have a long, sad, history of picking
	out the most different among us for "special" treatment.

	One of my favorite quotes from that series.  So, how does all
	this bear on relations between Humaniti and Vargr, Aslan, etc.?
	I could see a tendency to treat other species as less than
	human (pests, vermin, cute wildlife, curiosities), but treat
	humans with rival philosophies with real aggression.

BOLLOCKS!

If it were so easy, private enterprise would be doing it _now_. There\'s a
huge backlog of satellite launch needs, and no one is filling them.
There\'s a bucketload of money to be made there it\'s just that, well, it
_really_ is rocket science.

NASA does things the way they do because they\'re primarily a R&D
organization, something that modern MBA\'s have been trained to believe is
somehow an uneccesary expense, and a definite hindrance to tomorrows PL
statements. In a business environment where \'long-term planning\' means
scheduling a meeting next Monday, we\'re gonna be stuck on this dirtball
forever.

	Good guess, but incorrect.  They transfer electrons to the

	You are arguing semantics.  By some definitions, one might

	produce chemical reduction (only ATP), but I have no problem
	with including bacteriorhodopsin and carotenoids as pigments

out that explanations of differences in violence levels between countries
based on differences in cultural mixes don\'t really wash.  Canada is one
of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world and we have fairly
low levels of violence.  This despite cultural differences both overt
(Toronto has large numbers of both black and white people, Vancouver a
similar situation with asian immigrants) and subtle (Montreal has French
and English populations who also differ denominationally).  None of these
groups goes about shooting one another, however. 

One might argue that population density or weather has something to do
with differences in levels of violence, but comparing Toronto to Detroit
puts the lie to this. Both cities have about the same climate (being just
across a straight from one another) and both have roughly the same
population.  Yet Detroit has roughly 10 times the murder rate. 

Something I\'d be interested in knowing, if anyone has the stats, is what
the "gun density" of different countries/cities is, and how this relates
to levels of violence.  I\'m not talking about restrictiveness of gun laws
here, but number of guns per person.  The more common guns are, the more
difficult it becomes for laws to keep them out of the hands of criminals.
Consider for argument\'s sake the case where guns are as common as blades
of grass: no laws could prevent anyone who wanted one from obtaining one. 
I have a feeling this is the problem in the US, though admittedly it\'s
just and intuition...

jump causes one\'s vector direction to be randomized.  This is a
side-effect of the energy put into the jump.  The length of the vector
stays the same relative to the point of jump entry, so it\'s generally in
one\'s best interest to slow down before jumping.  This minimizes the
variability of the time it will take to intercept the world one is headed
to.  The randomization of the vector also attenuates the "near-c" rock
problem, whereby ships which retain their vectors in any predictable way
could jump in on high-speed collision courses with enemy worlds.  

This is my favorite solution as it does little violence to physics and
helps nix near-c rocks.

That was an interesting campaign, with this one player\'s dealings pulling
the entire group into a conflict with a seedy criminal ring that was
squeezing "protection" money out of honest suppliers of bedroom
entertainment.

The Traveller trade rules (from CT and MT) weren\'t quite up to the task of
assessing values on such trade goods, but I faked it and it turned out
okay. [I now own Far Trader but haven\'t delved into it -- would the rules
in that book be up to the task?]

This was before I discovered Traveller was supposed to have a "PG-13"
rating or less from the Motion Picture Association of America. ;-)

	I agree, but if you\'re playing Traveller (at least CT), 
	you\'ve already been bit.  :)

	I have never seen this in CT (which does not mean that it
	isn\'t there), but I\'ve never worried too much about following
	every rule to the letter.  I don\'t know what rules Josh
	Spencer uses, so I tried to avoid making any assumptions.

	Well, I\'m making the (reasonable, in my opinion) assumption
	that you "aim" your jump along a specific jump-space
	trajectory.  That is, you calculate what "direction" you need
	to go in jump-space to get to a given location (given the
	current distribution of masses in real-space) and tell the
	computer (that\'s what the navigator does).  If you don\'t
	missjump, you exit at the target point plus/minus a lot for
	uncontrolled factors.

>This fits in fairly well with Mark Miller\'s statements that if

	I am glad that Mr. Miller didn\'t put this in CT (AFAIK), as
	I dislike it.  IMTU, there is nothing between jump entry
	and jump exit, regardless of what may be between the two
	points in real-space.

	Sticky problem, I have no useful ideas.  Good luck.

<snipped>

	IMHO, the arbitrary decisions have already been made: the
	Traveller rules.  I try to be as logical as I can while
	remaining consistent with my interpretation of those rules
	(and a buch of tweeks).  Fortunately, IMTU, jump physics is
	an area with few consequences for anything other that
	jumping ships (an exception is teleportation, which I regard
	as a form of jump).  This allows me some latitude in setting
	laws that will not mess up the universe much more than it
	already is.

	A lot of people have never heard of the carotid artery, so

	brain.

	I am not familiar with the sheaths that you describe, but

Also, remember, in the US a suppressor is regulated just like a
fully-automatic firearm or destructive device ($200 tax, 6 month background
check, local LEO permission, not valid in all states).  Yep, a metal pipe
with washers in it - all by itself - is deemed by law a weapon as dangerous
as a machine gun or a grenade.

With six Alaskan winters under my belt, I must say that the only people you
are tempted to murder are those snowed in with you.  Anyone else is a
welcome change. (Rule #47 - Never kill a guest.)

In one of my Traveller campaigns, the players would stage a fight their
first day on planet - just to work out the last weeks
get-your-elbow-out-of-my-eye aggressions.

ObTrav:  What is the \'violence tendencies\' of a group of Travellers?  Are
they more or less violent than normal dirt-dwellers?  Is this violence
directed at others, or at members of their own ships crew?

S\'Allright.  I\'m holding a class Friday night at my house.  I\'ve got three
friends I\'m taking to the range Sat morning to shoot my AR-15s.  It\'ll be
the first time for all of them.  Class first - then range time.

ObTrav:  Do people cooped up in starships tend to share hobbies and
interests, or do they go in opposite directions in order to get some \'mental
distance\' to offset the forced physical closeness?

TJ didn\'t write the 2nd - or the Constitution.  TJ wrote the DoI - Madison
wrote the Constitution.

Anyway - yep:

"The strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms
is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." 
	-Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C.J.Boyd, Ed., 1950)

"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." -
The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution

Either way, its a \'right of the people\'.

In 1995 I was still living in Ohio but was travelling to California for an
anime convention, Anime Expo 95.  That summer was the height of the
Unabomber situation.

I had a large box in my carry-on which had a picture of the contents:  a
Japanese electronic toy which is a plastic globe on a pink pedestal.
Inside the globe, sitting on a plastic throne, is a plastic figure of
Sailor Moon.  When you pass your hand over the top of the globe, Sailor
Moon tells your fortune in Japanese to the accompaniment of music and
flashing lights.  The directions for using the toy were on the outer part
of the box.  In Japanese, of course.

The security personnel were unconvinced that the contents of the box were
a toy even though it was in the original packaging (I was bringing it to a
panel discussion I was part of and the original packaging really is the
best possible protection for it-- it cost me a lot of money to get here in
the US as the shipping was almost as much as the toy) and so they made me
remove it, put in the batteries, and demonstrate it for them.

To the great amusement and irritation of others waiting in line.  Oh, and
Sailor Moon told the big burly security guard that his lucky color was
pink and he was about to meet the most wonderful boy!

Space launch vehicles are much more likely to go up in a ball of
vapour if something goes wrong than a 777. Most of the time if something
goes wrong on an airplane you can continue the flight or land at the
nearest airport whereas with a rocket something going wrong is
extremely likely to result in catastrophic failure (ie fireball in the sky.)

Anybody who believes that private companies are automatically
efficient hasn\'t been reading their Dilbert cartoons. (yes they are just
comics but they are only funny because they are so true.)

I know of no law - In the US at least - that restricts any private
individual
(or corporation for that matter) from engaging in space launch.
The reasons "private enterprise" hasn\'t gotten into the space game
on a free lance basis is that nobody can figure out how to do it
less expensively than the "ineficient government bueraucracy."

Mind you if Boeing or Lockmart or Ford or somebody does get pasenger
service going I\'d be willing to pay for a ticket. Even if they have a much
higher than NASA failure rate.

Actually, Doug, it *was* commercially manufactured.  However, the bonehead
dumped an entire magazine of .223 all at once when he toasted the thing.
The fireball was almost inevitable.  They\'re just not designed to take
that kind of thermal spike. :^/  I have to give the guy credit for
maintaining good range discipline.  After the explosion, he slowly lowered
the rifle to waist level, keeping the muzzle down range, and waited for
close to a minute before beginning to examine the failure.

Part one is the chlorophyll, which is activated by light to \'catch\'
electrons (simplified, I know). The electrons are then used by enzymes
to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars. It is possible to use
any source of electrons to run the enzymes - and that is done in
bioreactors. As yet, chlorophyll is the most efficient converter of
sunlight to reductive power (spare electrons) we know of.

Ok, that tells me something I didn\'t know. *But*, it also says that
they *transfer* the energy to Chlorophyll. My guess would be that they
act like the phosphors in fluorescent tubes and absorb certain
wavelengths and re-emit them at others more suitable.

So they *aid* photosynthesis, but don\'t do it. The bacteriorhodopsin
is
a different matter.

What I meant was that it\'s more important that there be enough energy
at wavelengths the pigment can use, than what the overal frequency
composition is, and it\'s *especially* not that important where the
emission peak is.

*Efficiency* at converting available light into sugar is more
important
than sensitivity to specific wavelengths.

  Yes, but the North American (business) media tells us that North American
business is always right. Have you also been having disloyal thoughts about
the Computer, Comrade?

  Of course, it may not be North American "free enterprise" that makes
the breakthroughs; if so, they\'d better hope that the license fees on
the technology aren\'t too brutal :(

Ah.  I had been talking with some of the folks at that table and they were
mentioning some home-mades they had brought along and I assumed that the
Hollywood Flash came from one of those.

It was interesting to see John blow past me at a dead run before anybody
else could even move.  He\'s *good*.  He also has a twin in Bay Area Fandom.

I would suggest that no matter what the law says refusing to hear an 
appeal is de facto support for the status quo, and in 2nd amendment 
cases this means the SC effectively supports gun control laws.

	This works for me.  I think of a jump "tunnel" that tends
	to be (loosely) anchored to any large mass.  If you have
	some v as you enter the tunnel at one end, the other end
	of the tunnel is moving as you exit.  The magnitude of v
	is conserved, but the tunnel could be whipping around in
	any direction.  It could also come out in just about any
	distance/direction from the target world.

Civil wars, insurrections, and rebellions, to relate
to another thread, are traditionally bloodier than
wars between different countries.  

Ob Traveller:  The Civil War period appears to be an
exception to this rule, but it was actually just a
series of naval coups with little public (or
governmental) support or involvement.  On the other
hand, in my Traveller Universe at least, the Fifth
Frontier War is characterized by radical differences
in warfare styles.  

The Imperium on the one hand and the Zhodani and Sword
Worlds on the other fight a relatively conventional
war by: attempting to avoid civilian casualties and
destruction of ecosystems and infrastructures;
treating prisoners with respect and care; and
maintaining communication with each other regarding
prisoners and especially ransom and exchange
negotiations for nobles.

The Vargr forces are primarily in it for the loot, and
everyone recognizes this.  Zhodani advisors try to
keep the Vargr in line with the conventions being used
by the other belligerents, but with limited success. 
The Vargr don\'t hesitate to destroy what they can\'t
take with them, and the Zhodani have to pay them to
leave intact and garrison things that the Zhodani want
(like starports).  

The Vargr don\'t engage in genocide or mass murder of
civilians or prisoners as a matter of general
practice, but they\'re not squeamish about shooting
first and asking questions later, or eliminating
everyone -- civilian or military -- in the way of an
objective.  

An Imperial common citizen would have a hard time
deciding whether it\'s worse to be a Zhodani or Vargr
prisoner.  While the Zhodani might engage in really
disgusting mental practices, the Vargr probably won\'t
provide any medical care and maybe not even food,
unless you convince them that you\'re ransomable.  

The really nasty conflicts involve the Ine Givar, who
will stop at nothing to achieve independence from the
Imperium -- even if it means that Jewell, Regina,
Vilis, and Lanth subsectors become a Zhodani
protectorate.  The Ine Givar\'s primary demands are
total freedom to practice psionics and a restructuring
of the economy to ownership by the state.

Absolutely untrue!  The Supreme Court itself, many, many times have stated
that denying cert means nothing at all - except that they didn\'t want to
deal with the issue.

But you do have to remember that the only people that
the Finns traditionally dislike more than the Russians
are the Swedes (and even among the Finns the
Savolainen are said to think that they\'re superior to
everyone else, while the Karelians are considered sort
of like people who live in Appalachia).  Still, those
frosty northern temperaments seem to lead to a lot
more snide jokes than drive-by shootings.  (My
relatives couldn\'t tell me enough Swedish jokes the
last time I was there.)

By a few hundred years after the psionics suppressions
(i.e., ca. 1100), psionics is likely to be a very
scandalous matter, and accusations might fly.  It will
be less important to security in regions farther from
the Zhodani, so more likely to be just scandal and
gossip, and not quite libel or of interest to law
enforcement.

There\'s a reason why you don\'t mix suppressors and full auto in the
real world, regardless of what you see in the movies. :-)

OBtrav: Let the players learn this the hard way. 

After all, the military doesn\'t use suppressors except in very special
situations and units. The average scout has little need for them unless
he\'s doing covert ops. And Mercants rarely get firearms skills anyway.

So unless one of the group has "appropriate" history, let them buy or
buuild thosde suppressors, and then try using them in a "quiet"
operation. :-)

That\'s because NASA designs and runs the damn things like *racecars*.
Right at the ragged edge of performance. Which is way they have to
completely disassemble things after each flight. 

We need something designed like a *truck*, or at least like an
airplane. Parts and vehicle designed so that the normal flight regime
is only 50-70 percent of design rating. And designed so they merely
need regular maintenance.

True enough there.

We signed a treaty that makes the US *government*, not the individual
or corporation doing it, *legally* responsible for *any* space
activities carried out by US citizens or companies. Which means that
going overseas won\'t help get you out from under, you\'d have to give up
your *citizenship*.

Currently the Commerce department is (mostly) in charge of drawing up
and enforcing the regulations (and they rely on NASA bureaucrats for
technical evaluations).

I\'m told that due to the influence of th government contractor types
and NASA the regulations aren\'t real friendly to "small start up"
companies.

Well, I hear that part of the reason for that is that you get required
to produce tons of paperwork to satisfy government types that you
aren\'t violating their rules.

Exactly why there is a traveller world that is fun to game in.
Detroit is a city that, at the same time that it\'s main employers moved out, 
also became ruled by an ethnic group that had been picked on in the past and 
decided to take the following actions [just after open warfare broke out, 
requiring tanks and machine guns to restore some level of peace]:
1) Kick the other [usual majority] racial group out
2) Intentionally dis-empower the police force by hiring unqualifed and/or 
criminal police
3) Rule the local court system with judges and jurys who would allow many of 
their ethnic group to go free, or serve little time
4) Fail to repair battle damage [the \'broken windows\' theory of the criminal 
justice set holds that bad looking areas breed more bad looking things, and 
bad actions]
5) Raise taxes on any person or business who still remained

That plus the crack sales of the 80s led to the Detroit we know today. 

Option one: We can claim the difference is that Detroit has guns and 
therefore is a place of badness [by the way, very few CCWs are approved 
there, most that are approved are for retired police or the politically 
connected]; whereas in Canada loud noise makers are less present, therefore 
it is a good place. 

Option two is what makes traveller such a good game. You can set up two port 
cities, and even reuse some street maps [we never do that, do we ;-]  same 
size, same infrastructure, same basic government and offical titles, even 
much the same laws, and still have them be totally different places. One 
place for the highbrow adventure demanding cool and nice roleplaying, one for 
the street battle among the burned out ruins of the buildings. And the cool 
part is that your players know it happens in real life, so your world rings 
true. Just select any or all of the Detroit saga for a back story, if the 
players even think to inquire. That is travelling at its finest, and I think 
is the basic spirt of the game. The real worlds stories and history are all 
the SciFi plots you need. See Star Trek for details.
[remind me sometime to explain how I used the Ford/Nazi interaction, along 
with a semi-german/jewish back story, properly recast to avoid direct 
resemblance, to speed the PCs into the most intense gaming thread we had. 
Yes, it did end up at a death camp, and the players did the best they could 
to disrupt it, with never a doubt that such a world was possible]

The problem is, if you have an engine with a specific impulse of 460 seconds, and it takes 730 seconds of thrust to get into orbit plus an additional 120 seconds of thrust to keep from hitting the ground, 14% of your weight can be non-fuel mass.  If you reduce your specific impulse by 10%, only 11% of your weight can be non-fuel mass -- which means your parts need to be 30% stronger, weight for weight, which means that by running one system at _less_ than design rating, other systems need to run at _more_ than design rating.  Getting into space is _hard_.

Maybe.  In practice a small startup is flatly incapable of getting into orbit.  The cheapest way of doing it is buying a missile booster from the USSR, and that\'s still quite expensive.

Well, truth is that there are a number of private groups which are doing work on commercial launchers; a number of groups think they _can_ make money at the private launch business, and most likely NASA would be happy to let them do so.

None of this relates to mars exploration, of course.  There\'s no commercial reason to go there.

Worth a read of Iain M Banks\' "Consider Phlebas" where an equivalent of HEAP 
rounds were exploding when they hit the shock wave from the round before, 
right back to the firer resulting in a "barrelcrash..."
A good deterrant for explosive rounds fired FA, I would have thought...

\'Scuse my de-lurkng for a moment, but has any discussion here covered
the concept of a "ballistic arc" journey through jump space.  This might
help explain the "7 days +/- 1 day" rule if the "up velocity" at start
of jump was constant - or if different jump numbers involved entering
different "jump spaces" each with different "gravity" and "entry/escape
velocity".  Gravity wells in real space warp the real space/jump space
interface in such a scheme so that the jump space side is *smaller*.  A
planet plus its gravity well becomes a very small target when "aiming"
your trajectory through jump space, so you are unlikely to exit jump in
a gravity well.  The dangers of entering jump space while in a gravity
well, OTOH, are pretty evident.  I realise this doesn\'t fit with Marc
Millers T4 pronouncement, but the effect is pretty much the same.

Cheers,

Andy

But if some company decided that space was a worthwhile
investment those rules would change. All it would take is a few well
chosen "campaign contributions" and congress would fall over itself
backwards to change those regulations.

I worked for a Textbook store that serves the local comunity college.
one of the courses taught at that institution is ENG 100 - Technical
Writing. Any largish corporation will be able to swamp "Los Federales"
with more than enough paperwork to convince anybody willing to be
convinced. (My impression of NASA funcionaries - they want to be
convinced.)

Why do you think the Imperium has a "hands-off" approach to planetary

This doesn\'t happen to the Imperial government,
because it governs so little and makes almost no laws
that deal directly with people\'s lives.  The notable
exceptions would be the Psionics Suppressions and the
decree against slavery, and these may have led to to
lose-lose situations in their time.  By the 1100s,
these are non-issues.

Member states can have lots of problems of this
nature, of course.

I thought we were getting along famously.  No one has
even called anyone else "wrong" let alone a rude name.
 To the extent that the subject is straying from
Traveller (lately by becoming an exegisis of United
States foundational texts), however, I support taking
the discussion off-list.  To the extent that we\'re
talking about Traveller issues, I don\'t object to
analogizing from history.

Maybe.  It depends what the trace mineral is.  In general I\'d consider it unlikely, however.  A biological agent which triggers on some trace material is probably easier.

New Heresy:

Grandfather and the Hivers are old enemies.

The war wasn\'t between Grandfather and his children, it was between
Grandfather and the Hivers. All of the Grandfather\'s children were
destroyed, Grandfather hid and the Hivers were blasted back into a pre
technological society.

And the trip switch to start the war was the Hiver\'s attempt to manipulate
one of the most adaptable of Grandfathers slave worker races, the Humans.

The funny thing is though, twenty years ago NASA could do it. You
youngsters might want to look up the history of a little project called
Viking. 

My question is: Is NASA\'s recent history just a string of bad luck, the
fruits of our "modern, improved" education system, or little gray dudes
from Zeta Reticuli getting in some target practice before the big invasion?

Ah, the annual "use of blade weapons in Traveller"
thrash arrives just as people were starting to tire of
(or really warm up to) the "gun control/U.S.
Constitution" thrash.  No, wait, that isn\'t Jim\'s
question; he accepts blade weapons in the Far Future,
and wants to know, why the cutlass?

>They never used them historically, Marines started 
>out using Muskets and Bayonets and even the officers 
>used a different sword.

Well, what does "historically" mean in our context? 
You are talking about the 1600s to 1800s.  To people
living in the Far Future, that\'s like you and me
discussing what weapons were used by which personnel
on the Pharoah\'s boats.  It has no bearing on
traditions that may only be several hundred years old.

So why the Cutlass, as opposed to the broadsword, dai
katana, kukri, or other blade weapon?  In my Traveller
Universe, the Instellarms LIC engineers who submitted
the winning bid wanted to base the design on an old
Solomani weapon (the Solomani faction being then
ascendant) and thought the cutlass looked the coolest.
 They won the bid (coolness being a factor considered
by Imperial Marine Procurement, but strength,
durability, cost, and other factors also having been
considered) and the rest is history.

>Enlisted Naval personnel were the main users of the

Axes are best for breaking through wooden doors and
walls, but there aren\'t many of these aboard
starships; breaching charges are used instead.

Pikes are (1) for grabbing the other ship\'s gunwales
and (2) holding off charging enemy sailor coming over
your gunwales.  There aren\'t any gunwales on
starships, so these don\'t get used in the Far Future.

This may be a good thing though: Many years now, rpg´s have become more and 
more expensive to get into. There has to be a cheap entry level RPG though, 
else there will be no newer players. To keep the community healthy, we need 
younger recruits, and they won´t be able to afford to spend more than 
70-100$ to even start playing. If D&D is going to cater to that market 
again, i´ll welcome it... More young recruits means more sales for more 
expensive games later on, so the industry will stay healthy in the years to 
come.

Actually, there are a *lot* of chemicals/drugs that in effect "increase
sensitivity" to various trace substances or the lack thereof. We may
not be able to *design* such, but browsing thru "failed drug" info at
drug development centers, and "interaction warnings" for successful
drugs would likely locate a suitable candidate from damn near anything!

I\'d love to. But the book is "too old" to be in stock at the local

Maybe so, but by not hearing cases dealing with a particular issue, the 
Supreme Court is allowing whatever it is that is being appealed against 
to continue.

In the case of gun control by refusing to hear 2nd amendment cases the 
Supreme Court is allowing state and federal gun control laws to exist 
and be enforced regardless of thier constitutional legality. 

It strikes me that this is a weakness in the US system - if the Supreme 
Court won\'t hear cases the constitution can be ignored. How are Supreme 
Court members selected?

Hah. There are some advantages to being part of the UK side of the 
paperback industry - they\'ve just reprinted them (again) and they\'re on 
the shelves here. OTOH getting new Weber novels can be a nightmare, as 
is getting anything, new or old, published by DAW. I suspect that DAW 
doesn\'t have an overseas publication deal with anyone in the UK.

    (startled gasp!)
    There\'s my problem, I\'m a sword fanatic. A Sabre and a Cutlass are as
different as a Hatchet and a Battle Axe (well, to me they are), I even
distinguish between the Cutlass and the Dusagge. (What\'s the definition of
"Anal Retentive"?)
    I was wrong in my earlier post, the US Marines used a Cutlass during
their operations around the Barbary Coast until 1859 when they adopted the
sword you mentioned. I actually own an early 20th century cutlass although
it is so light it\'s almost a different beastie entirely, so you have a good
point about the Cutlass/Sabre. By the time it is the Third Imperium the
weapon will probabl be unrecognisable, Mono-Molecular Blade etc. Still, by
far the most common user of the Cutlass were Naval Enlisted, is there a
CT/MT case for making them roll against "Naval Tradition"?

Actually, the carbonaceous chodrites are second only to the "ice"
bodies in value. For one thing, "ice" and "CHON" are the *only* sources
of critical life support chemicals like nitrogen in the belt. Ditto for
carbon (for plastics and life support), hydrogen (water and power),
etc. 

Also, in any belt you\'ll have ice *or* chondrites. Ice in the outer
system, where it is cold enough, chondrites in the inner system where
the volatiles got baked out of the ice at the same time UV was
converting surface compounds into complex organics.

So the three types of asteroids are:

1. nickel/iron
2. stony
3. icy *or* chondritic

Nickel/iron is useful for structrul materials, and the "impurities" out
to be fairly useful too (any metals that prefer to go into solution in
iron rather than become part of the "stony" part of a body when a body
differentiates in the early history of a system). Stuff like Iridium,
and other platinum group metals.

I\'ve already covered icy & chondritic bodies.

Which leaves stony bodies. Which are somewhat useful as a source of
oxygen, if you can\'t find anything better. And they\'ve got *lots* of
silicon, aluminum and magnesium. And fair amounts of titanium. So
glass, steel, aluminum, magnesium, and titanium are the major
construction materials in belt habitats. 

Just keep in mind that *all* asteroid "rock" is igneous. No sedimentary
or metamorphic. And it\'s *really* unlikely that there will be any
"hydrothermal" deposits. Thus, no mineral "veins". Just lots and lots
of basalts, granites and the like. (any geologist want to help out
here?) 

So all the stuff we prospect for "ores" of on Earth isn\'t like to
*have* "ores" in the belt. You\'ll just have to extract the silica, then
the alumina, magnesia, and titania (oxides of the relevant elements).
the rest of the stuff will be a mish mash of all *sorts* of stuff. And
seperating it will be a pain.

Again, you are talking about *large* companies. Which are mostly

Not really. It\'s a requirement for getting the last possible ounce of
payload for a given amount of fuel. But I\'ve read articles by folks
involved with several different "alternative launch systems" that say
much what I did. 

Several designs use deliberately "de-rated (ie operated at well below
the design range) engines specifically to reduce wear and allow longer
operation between *scheduled* maintenance. 

Rocket fuel is *not* the big expense. The fuel required to get you into
orbit might cost as much as a few hundred bucks. Probably a lot less. 

The costs are all expensive parts in the rocket, with their *short*
lifetimes, and the *millions* of man-hours involved in assembling and
maintaining things the NASA way.

This is why multi-stage rockets were invented. They are *not*
inherently "one use". 

Also, just because the parts have to be 30% stronger, that *doesn\'t*
mean that they are running at more than their design rating. 

Please note that the DC-X was designed using "aircraft" design
practices, not "spacecraft" ones.

You are making unfounded assumptions. A "small startup" won\'t get into
orbit *at first*, anymore than a small startup computer firm will
get picked to be the computer supplier for all the computers in a
Fortune 500 company. 

Startups start out by designing and testing launchers for small
payloads. And for your information, it is possible for "high power"
model rockets to orbit payloads. Nobody has done it yet because not
only is it expensive, but getting the flight plan approved would be a
nightmare. 

Several of the suppliers of the larger model rocket engines have lines
the go from the "model rocket engines" on up to sounding rocket engines
without any sort of a break. Just a steady progression of
impulse/thrust ratings thoroughout the line.

Anyway, a startup either builds around "off the shelf" engines, or they
design their own and buy off the shelf for other things. They do tests
to prove their designs, and as the tests go well they get more
investors and scale things up. Or they fail (either tests or to attract
investors) and they vanish. 

But expecyting them to do the sort of reporting that someone like
Boeing does (where they can afford the staff to file foot thick
reports with the government) is just a bit unreasonable.

Depends on who you ask. The rank and file at NASA, sure. Ask the admin
types, they may *say* yes, but their actions say something quite
different.

Actually, there are restrictions in place: Government agencies may ignore
the FARs, but private corporations may not; if it flys in the US, is not
owned by a federal government agency, and carries people, it falls under
the FAA. Anything with an enclosed cockpit needs a type certificate from
the FAA. The FAA doesn\'t issue type certs for rockets, at least according
to the last set of FAR\'s I have seen (\'92). Once it breaks 28 (IIRC) miles,
it isn\'t subject to the FAA anymore, but getting to 28 miles without
violating some FAR is going to be amusing...

And if it carries people for money, it falls under the air-carrier rules.
At least  US customs has declared that there is no tarif on goods from
space. ;)

Typically, IMTU, firearms posession is blanket legal on the Imperial books,
but is subject to local laws outside the extrality zones.

Imperial Nobles typically are allowed to wear a blade or foil openly, but
not heavier weapons unless locally legal. Active Duty Imp Marines may wear
a cutlass when on pass or liberty. On Duty Imperial Military may carry
their issue weapon(s), subject to local command restrictions. Huscarles are
considered Active Duty Imperial Forces IMTU. Also, many worlds IMTU have a
reduced law level for Imperial (and, if applicable, Local) Nobles;
typically I find this by LL+1-1d3 (0 to 2 below regular LL).

IMTU, the 3I requires certain weapons to be regulated, including Chem,
Nuke, Bio, and Fusion based weapons. To get such weapons, one must have a
valid Imperial Mercenary Liscence, part of the chartering procedure. It is
also required for purchase of Powered Armors (Battle Dress). PGMP\'s and
FGMP\'s are regulated by the Imperium, as are Battle Dress.

A Ship\'s master may purchase Det-Laser missiles... but if he uses one
inappropriately, it may be the end of him... Violations fo the Rules of

The US Marines did, in fact, use cutlases in their early days. The marine
NCO dres side-arm, accroding to the LPM, is still the cutlass. Officers use
a mamaluke hitled sword. Early US marines carried cutlasses in addition to
Muskets (NS1 and NS2 NROTC/NJROTC texts). Also remember, US Marines ARE
(Technically) "Naval Personell" (the USMC is part of the Department of the
Navy).

In the context of Traveller, the boarding pike, bayonette, and Boarding Axe
(A modified halberd, IIRC) are all two handed, and thus failry useless once
the gravity fails. A Cutlass, being one-handed, and having the half-basket,
allows one to use the other hand for a hold (On opponent or on wall). Being
a slashing and a mass weapon, and having a sharp point, it can rip/puncture
vacc suits, crush through soft armors, and cut exposed flesh; additionally,
a cutlass, being curved, requires less swing room than an equivalent
mass/pen straight bladed sword.

I think Peez is peezed because it only recently (Nov 1999) flared on the TML. My
fault, I think, because I asked about the "well-regulated militia" line.

Actually, "flared" is a little too strong. The responses I received, including
direct discussions with Mark Cook, were very polite explanations of the Second
Amendment:
     - "militia" = males between 17 and 45;
     - "well-regulated" = "well-trained/equipped", not "well-controlled"; and
     - the difference between "organised" (National Guard) and "unorganised"
(everyone else)
In other words, a whole lot of background detail I never knew before.

We even had an ObTravRef arise out of this:

<I stated> "I believe the key in both cases [sex ed and firearm safety - shows
how much we wandered OT!] is to teach consequences and therefore responsibility.
The big thing people seem to be into these days is "my rights!" - without
recognising that with rights, comes responsibility.

Funnily enough, you can almost get an ObTrav out of this - this goes to the
heart of the concept of "noblesse oblige". Sure, you are born into a privileged
class, with all the associated perks - you do realise that you are expected to
work for them, don\'t you?"

The US Supreme Court also allowed a limited exception to the Miranda
Laws... so long as the officer reads it to you, it doesn\'t matter that you
don\'t speak the language it is read in if you have not spoken to the
officer yet. I agree that not hearing is not the same as hearing and
upholding, but it definitely is much closer than to Hearing and Revoking.

Presidential Appointment, which must be confirmed by Congress. Serves for

Ob Trav: IMTU, the "Supreme Court" is the Moot. The Moot can not overturn
the edicts of the current emperor, but CAN oust him, and then "Reinterpret"
his statements.

There\'s a lot of competition for the bloodiest day,
week, month and year of war. And then of course it
depends what you call a "war". Some speak of "war
against the people", and in that case China has a
bloody history, with some 30 million killed during the
Cultural Revolution (about ten years), and Stalin came
close in the 30s, with about 25 million killed (at one
point, one in five of the adult male population was in
a labour camp!) However, for myself, I call that plain
old genocide, and "war" means when someone\'s shooting
and someone\'s shooting back (the April Rising in the

Most of the famous battles were bloody ones:
Chansolerville, Antietam, First and Second Bull Run,
Normandy, Monte Cassino, Stalingrad...

And I stick to my contention, the more similar the
nations, the more bloody the conflict. Of course it\'s
true that similar tend to be closer, and therefore
easier to fight with, but that\'s not _always_ the
case. Look at the Hindus and Moslems in
India/Pakistan, for example. Very different religions
and ideas of how to live, yet a long and frequently
bloody conflict.

I guess what I\'m really saying is that neither
difference nor similarity _cause_ conflict (though
similarity makes conflict bloodier, often), but that
something innate in humans causes conflict. We start
the fight, think of an excuse later, all too often.

We see this nowadays. No sooner does the Soviet Union
collapse than we find the West at war with Iraq, and
threatening other such nations like Sudan and North
Korea. Someone once said that once you base your
security on an absolute and ultimate weapon, like the
atom bomb, it becomes psychologically necessary to
believe in an absolute and ultimate enemy.

There are many contenders for Bloodiest Day, but let\'s
face it: armies over the years have killed far more
civilians than soldiers. We don\'t like to focus on it
because it\'s not particularly glorious (like the fact
that most soldiers never shoot at the enemy), and
doesn\'t make for great epic poems and movies. But it\'s
true.

There\'s a lot of competition for the bloodiest day,
week, month and year of war. And then of course it
depends what you call a "war". Some speak of "war
against the people", and in that case China has a
bloody history, with some 30 million killed during the
Cultural Revolution (about ten years), and Stalin came
close in the 30s, with about 25 million killed (at one
point, one in five of the adult male population was in
a labour camp!) However, for myself, I call that plain
old genocide, and "war" means when someone\'s shooting
and someone\'s shooting back (the April Rising in the
Warsaw Ghetto, as opposed to Babi Yar).

Most of the famous battles were bloody ones:
Chansolerville, Antietam, First and Second Bull Run,

That was me.  I wanted to get back to you sooner, but this has been

Mine is full, at the moment, but lurkers are welcome.  If you\'ve
never been involved with a roleplaying done by email it might be a
good idea to observe a couple for a while and see if "it\'s for you."

About somewhere to look...

www.pbem.com -- Lists *lots* and lots of games in various genre,
                has tools and "How to" articles.  Not much in the
                way of Traveller last time I looked, though.

www.phoenyx.net -- Hosts several games.  There use to be Traveller
                games here, but I think they have moved or died.
                
www.onelist.com -- Thousands and thousands of lists, including an
                unknown number of Traveller oriented PBEMS...mine
                included.
                
www.downport.com -- Has Traveller oriented classifieds.  Last I
                looked this included a few "Game wanted/players
                wanted" ads.
                
It would be nice if there were a good list of Traveller PBEMS on the
web somewhere. I can\'t get you the address of one, though.

Actually, it\'s "recruit _on two_ die six, 7- for success."

The Daedalus engine was not going to be a reactor,
which is a reaction that sustains itself without any
energy put in, but a series of explosions, like lots
of little bombs, or, indeed, like a conventional
rocket. We can make an explosion, but not a reactor,
just as the Chinese made fireworks 2000 years before
we were able to make a steam engine. It\'s one thing to
make it go "whoosh!" in a straight line, another to
make something you can turn around, make go faster, go
slower, turn off and start again, store the power
generated, etc...

The automation question is a fair one, the Mars probe
comments likewise. It\'s true  NASA\'s budget has been
cut, and as we\'ve seen in many areas (not least in
British Rail and their recent disaster), cutting
budget means cutting the less glorious parts, like
safety and reliability. But a personal opinion here:
twenty years ago probes were sent out for less money,
and were heaps simpler, and lasted longer than
expected. Voyager 2, Pioneer 11, they\'re still sending
back data, for God\'s sake! And they were only expected
to last until 1982! But the ones we send out now are
much much more complex. 
The moral of the story according to Kyle is: KISS!
(Keep It Simple, Stupid!) My father has an Apple IIc;
it\'s not compatible with today\'s software, but for him
it\'s just a word processor, so it works. He also has a
television he bought in 1978, and that still works
also. Me, I bought a IBM 286, and it self-destructed
before it even had a chance to get obsolete. Ditto
with a Digital television set.
The more complex the system, the more chance it\'ll go
kaput. 
So maybe the petrol tank and old concrete mixer for a
spaceship ain\'t such a bad idea after all...

Look at it this way.  Have you ever heard of criminals that
couldn\'t get pretty much whatever type of weapon they
wanted?  Criminals will always have weapons, usually
superior to those available to most public servants short
of SWAT teams.  So, if you removed the 2nd and
allowed the gun-control advocates to have thier way, the
only people who had guns would be the criminals.  Police
cannot protect us and never could.  The only way for
people to be safe is for them to protect themselves.

I remember a few years ago Florida struck all gun-control
laws from thier books and encouraged the people to arm
themselves.  Crime rates dropped like a rock.  About 6
months later, I got a letter from a friend living in Orlando,
he commented that the only people being molested by
criminals were tourists.  He figured that most criminals
decided that if the neighbor was "prob\'ly totin\' iron" that it
would be safer to go for the out-of-towners.  Even so, the
crime rates are way down from what they were before the
change.

Good.  The other alternative, discrediting and
marginalizing him, might not work in this forum. 
Besides, if he knows that much, he knows what\'s good
for him.  I hope he gets the secret handshake down
easily.

We thought this too. But we wanted to run a modern game, so we generated
modern characters (mine was based on military chopper pilot I once knew) and
started playing. The GM threw in a real interesting twist though.

We decided to start in London, to keep some of the feel of the original
WotW.

As the war started, imagine our surprise when the characters ran into a
burning _SHADO_ mobile in the main street !

Remember them ?

There is also the near future "Killraven : Warrior of the Worlds" comic
series by Don McGregor, originally published in "Amazing Adventures"  from
Marvel Comics.

It\'s set after a postulated succesful Martian invasion, the title character
being a survivor of the gladiatorial arena set up by the Martian overlords.
For the time the comic came out, it was quite progressive, and included some
very good stories and art.

A similar series was done later with Paul Gulacy for Eclipse, the "Sabre"
series.

> Actually an entire HG Wells sourcebook would be a cool undertaking!  Or

Or both. I think including Jules Verne and Conan Dyle would be a good idea
too.

Though one could say that the steam-punk books cover this reasonably well.

I did the calculation using RATE with the following:
New ship cost: 240 Mcr
Down payment:  48 Mcr
Loan financed:  192 Mcr
Monthly payments: 1 Mcr

So, translating that to MSeXcel:
Nper = 40*12
Pmt = -1000000
Pv = 192000000
Fv = 0
Type = 1
Guess = 4%/12
so the entry was = 12 * RATE(40*12,-1000000,192000000,0,1,4%/12)

I came up with ~ 5.610%, although; when I used the value
it generated to do a payment schedual, I came up with a
final balance of $8,381,385.56 after the 480th $1,000,000
payment.  Who wants a baloon payment of $9,381,385.56?

I used Goal Seek to adjust the interest value so that the
final balance was $0.00.  I finally came up with a value of
5.574271922413%, which I found a little surprising.

Frankly, I don\'t blame them. But it seems to me that
part of letting yourself be appointed to the Supreme
Court means being willing to get into a "mess". When I
joined the Army I didn\'t act surprised when they sent
me to combat. The SC is there to deal with messy
issues. If they were simple and clear-cut all the
time, you wouldn\'t need the SC.

Well, the fact that it\'ll lead to change is not
necessarily bad. Your Revolution was change, so was
your civil rights rulings of the 50s and 60s ending
southern apartheid. We\'ve seen in our recent
referendum in Australia that both sides (for and
against becoming a republic) emphasised how little
would change if you voted for them. It\'s a cowardly
society, a frightened youth especially, that is
terrified of social change.

If they\'re refusing to hear cases on aspects of it,
isn\'t that "ignoring" it? It\'s easy to imagine people
getting carried away and revolting, but would it
genuinely happen? I understand there were the same
objections to ending apartheid in the south in the
60s, that it\'d lead to violence. Some fringe types
started singing dixie. In the end, people died, but
there was no civil war no.2. How is this different?

> And again we\'ll have major sections of

> ready to revolt.
What exactly do you mean by "revolt"? Actual armed
uprising? Or just lots of whingeing and picketing?

For myself, I remember the words of one of your braver
souls, a writer of the last century, who said, "so
what if blood is shed? Is there not a kind of blood
shed when the conscience is wounded? I see this blood
flowing now."
I don\'t see a vaguely worded important law being
ignored forever. At some point, your Supreme Court
will have to rule on it. I don\'t say it\'s a bad thing,
bearing arms. But nor is it a good thing, your people
murdering one another, and armed groups threatening
insurrection (in Commonwealth countries, you couldn\'t
have private militias, they\'d be thrown in jail just
for assembling with arms and talking about the
possibility of revolution). If a law is bad, you can
change it. You\'ve done it before (think of alcohol
prohibition, think of emancipation, etc). Why not
again? 
I say that if your own Supreme Court is too scared to
face these issues, then they are obviously the issues
that most need facing. The most pressing issues are
always the most frightening in their consequences, the
most important decisions, the hardest.
And if a leader cannot make decisions, well then maybe
there really will be a revolution.

I\'d imagine not. As someone else put it, it\'s the
benefit of ruling by decree, being a dictator!:)
Democracy will _always_ be a mess. Someone said, I
think it was Rosseau, that the difference between a
dictatorship and democracy was this: a dictatorship is
like a merchant ship: large, sturdy, and you always
know where you\'re going. But if it hits a reef, you\'re
sunk and you\'re all in the drink. A democracy is like
a raft: your feet are always wet, you\'ve got no idea
where you\'re going, but you\'ll never sink!

    World War One was a true obscenity, at the Somme the British lost 60,000
men in the first day and the final butchers bill was 620,000 dead Allies and
450,000 dead Germans. This doesn\'t take into account the gassed, maimed or
insane. Those six months really proved that mankind is a disgusting
creature, the final toll on combatants for the entire war was 9 million and
no one is sure to this day what it was all over. More Russians died than any
other nationality but Serbs, Romanians, Bulgarians and Turks had the highest
proportional losses. No one was ever able to count the civilian deaths
    Here in Australia we don\'t commemorate the Battle of Long Tan, where one
company fought a brilliant victory against huge odds, but we still remember
the day when the ANZACs climbed out of their boats and were gunned down in
the shallows. Almost every nation has a day to remember the most useless
loss of life in history.

A piece of random information for you.

Reportedly, New Zealand has the highest gun ownership per head in the world.

However, this is caused by collectors with huge collections, and New
Zealand\'s small population.

The _rate_ of gun ownership is lower than the US.

I tend to agree with your last thought.  No major
power is able to destroy any other power completely,
so they don\'t try to.  Rather, they keep their
conventional forces ready to do conventional warfare. 


The only examples of world-destroying technology that
I can think of are whatever the Ancients had that
destroyed Shionthy and made something of a mess of
Victoria (it looks from the map like the oceans are
big asteroid craters) and the Darrians\' star trigger.
No one since has developed anything on a similar
scale, in large part for lack of effectiveness.  Even
if you start destroying someone\'s planets, you\'ll
never be able to destroy all or most of them.

Now outside the major powers, this theory doesn\'t hold
up.  States consisting of only a few worlds could well
be destroyed by planet-busters.  The proximity of the
major powers probably means that they don\'t bother. 
If they did, the local major power would find out,
decide that it was too dangerous for a minor power to
have whatever weapon it was, and would take whatever
steps were necessary to restore the status quo.  

Finally, remember that any fleet of ships probably has
enough nuclear missiles and spinal weapons to destroy
a star system\'s civilization nearly as completely as
destroying the planets themselves -- especially from
the perspective of the residents.  Dead is dead, after
all.

I would imagine it\'s like small military units (and,
I\'ve been told, Antarctic research stations): you
spend a lot of time scrapping with each-other, then as
soon as an outsider comes along, band together like
brothers. 

IMTU, my players also have played out that cabin-fever
aspect. Sometimes they jump into their freeze-tubes,
just so they don\'t have to watch the captain\'s
favourite movie (the ancient earth epic, "spaceballs")
for 223rd time... (as for the captain, he can\'t stand
the gunner\'s favourite, "Die Hard". We won\'t even
mention the medic\'s love of country and western!)

You just have to wait for your opportunity. In Sam
Gunn, the government put out to tender a contract to
clean up LEO, since it was so full of junk, old
satellites and all... the big comapny idea was the old
nerf ball, a big electrostatically charged balloon
that\'d drfit around and basically sweep the lot away.
Sam Gunn\'s idea was to stick a big magnetic bumper bar
on the space station (like the one we\'re slowly but
surely building), it\'d deflect all the little stuff,
and he in a kind of 2001-style pod would pick up the
big bits. The board was going for the big company, he
sat up and said, "small business set aside." The gvt
had foolishly passed a law saying that in any big govt
contract, they had to set aside a chance for the
smaller business. So he got a crack at it.
In the event (it is a story after all) the nerf ball
deflated and was about to crash into the station (even
a balloon a 7km/sec will make a big splodge), and
Sammy saved the day with his pod... He also got to
charge the big company for the salvage!

Is there a "small business set aside" in reality? If
not, petition your congressmen!

Well, in October we had the dreaded Four Flamewars of the Apocalypse:

Now is the time of the Gathering, when the stroke of a key will unleash
a spray of Pepsi on the keyboard.  In the end, there can be only one....

**end quote from October 1999**

As I\'m sure you guessed, the "near-c rocks" issue came up again shortly
thereafter.

More recently, we\'ve been working on the Annual TML 2d Amendment
Debate....

On a more positive note, C**f is still off the list....

Well, I\'d be inclined to hop on that ship, land on
that asteroid, start hauling it back to earth and say,
"sue me, Secretary General. Come and get me!" And moon
him from orbit.

As for local laws, I daresay that if some private
company managed to, say, put a shipload of idiots with
more money than sense into space, well, they\'d have
enough money from ticket sales to pay the government
fines fifty times over.

Having just rewatched TLC\'s Asteroid Impact, the following occured to me...

Options for a dino-killer type imminent impact:
Shatter
Divert

Shattering keeps getting trounced here based upon 100 impacts of 100m is no
better than 1 impact of 1500m of rock.

Diverting is energy intensive.

Would not shattering, especially at times from impact on the order of 5-10
weeks, if done with sufficient force, scatter most off a direct impact? And
if sufficient force is used, would one not be able, especially with
TTL10-12 capabilites, to deliver sufficient force repeatedly enough to
reduce the impacts below the atmosphereic deep penetration thresholds?

So, is not shattering in essence ALSO diversion AND reduction below threat
size?

>1)  Is this an easy task?  

No, it\'s not.  It\'s, at least, as hard a task to keep a PBEM going
as it is to keep a FTF game going.

>2)  How much more time will this require compared to other session
>preparation?

I spend about as much time on game prep for my PBEM as I do for FTF
sessions.  I spend a *lot* of time writing and responding to the
player\'s game posts.  What you do verbally in a 2 hour session can
take 3 or 4 hours in an IRC game and weeks in an email game. 

>3)  How easy are "chat" systems to use during gaming sessions?

I\'ve seen IRC, AOL Messenger, and ICQ all used in online gaming.  I
think, if you can find a small uncrowed ICR server, that\'s the best
method for chat type games.

>4)  How often do you "meet" to play?

For chat type games the norm seems to be once every one to two weeks
for a session.  It\'s best if you can setup a schedule so people can
plan ahead, but like FTF games you can\'t always count on everybody
making to the game.  Do what you\'d do in a FTF game, either ignore
the absent or NPC them.

Email games fall into two different types that I call turn based and
conversational roleplaying.  

Turn based games are where the GM posts the situation and the
players all respond to him with their proposed actions, the GM puts
all the player posts together and responds with what actually
happened, and that starts the cycle again.  One or two "turns" a
week is the best you can really hope for.

Conversational games are more like FTF games where everyone is
gathered around the table talking at once.  The GM posts situations
and NPC actions and words.  The players talk to each other and the
GM\'s NPC\'s, propose actions, and toss both IC (in character) and OOC
(out of character) comments back and forth.  The GM has to
constantly stay involved posting what actually happens as the game
progresses in "real time."  There\'s a lot of "noise" in this method,
but can be a heck of a lot of fun.  For conversational games
everyone posts every day, sometimes several times a day, and still
it can take a month to play out a day. 

>5)  I don\'t have a web site, do I need one?

It\'s not required, but it\'s a *very* good idea.

>6)  If a web site is recommended, where should I go to get the space?

There are lots of choices including, but not limited to, geocities,
xoom, crosswinds, your local isp, and the file space on egroups or
onelist.

>7)  What is the minimum space I can get away with?

If you\'re putting up mostly text, then a couple of meg will do.  If
you are putting up lots of graphics, then you\'ll need lots of space.
You\'ll have to decide what you want to use the site for your game.
 
I don\'t mind lurkers in my PBEM.  If you\'re interested ask me about
it.

However, for reasons that should be obvious to the astute reader, the

  Umm, yes? And I suspect that condition applies even more so for
the UK and most of Western Europe (?). Not that there isn\'t (well,
at least was) a thriving business in importing firearms from the US.

Remember them?  Shoot, just last weekend I was thinking it would be cool to
have them done up for GURPS :^)  Wish the Sci-Fi channel would show that
series again, of course I\'d probably never notice it was on.  Don\'t
remember the last time I bothered to watch anything they had on.

Probably an ornamental plum tree, they are popular for their dark burgundy

No. The *true* obscenity was thinking you could have a war in Europe with
modern weapons and armies of several million each and not have days like
the 1st July 1916.

Its also a damned hell to get those russian ladas started

It ain\'t no better on the other side of Sweden. Here in
Norway we have the same jokes about the Swedes as the Finnish.

I think that most of the difference is that the Scandinavian
countries are very wealthy by world standards, with their
wealth fairly even diveded by the population. Violent crimes done
with guns are most likely to be performed by poor, low-educated 
males and fourtunatly it ain\'t to many of those here, allthough
you se a rise in problems with refugees from Yugoslavia, who
have litterly taken over the underworld buisness in Oslo,
the capital of Norway.

Thanks for that.  I love this album.  Just rereading the above and having
the tune kickstart in my memory has brought me out in goosebumps.  Of
course, given that the girl in WoW is called \'Carrie\' I\'ve often thought
that Cliff Richard\'s "Carrie Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore" would be kind of
appropriate - but not in the same league as the above.

Kai!  I get shivers down my spine when I hear that "and slowly, but surely,
they drew their plans against us".  Surely the catchphrase of every referee
with half decent NPCs black hats.

Hey!  My old group did this too!  Did we have a laugh when the Ship\'s
Captain PC bought the goods without the rest of the party\'s knowledge, but
it was inadvertantly laid upon one of the other players (the party 2IC) to
describe the products to a potential NPC buyer (the Ship\'s Captain player
was called away at that moment for over an hour)... unfortunately, said
player was one of the shyest (in r/l) people you could ever meet!  He
handled it well though and we wondered how he knew so much about such
stuff...??

Well, it can have any rating, but all RPG\'s I have ever been involved in
have "censor rating" adjusted by the players involved.  I\'ve mastered and/or
played in various games, teen games where adult situations were mellowed
(thought there was one imaginative 14 yo lad that was quite descriptive of
interactions betwixt he and his in-game love interest!) for image purposes -
like the GM didn\'t want to be seen as being to heavy in content with minors
in case their parents didn\'t like it (which I suppose is every GM\'s call
and/or responsibility?), to very adult games where, in one, a female
player\'s PC was a "love slave" to the entire crew - and she was quite
descriptive - and another campaign where that particular woman, another
woman, and one of the male players were (in their terms), "Whores in Space!"

Well, the last two were extremes and not the norm I suppose, but it points
out the fact that it\'s pointless to "Rate" an RPG in such ways (although it
may be required), as the nature of the beast (RPG\'s) is it\'s adaptability.
In fact, I wasn\'t even aware that CT was PG13 myself, and I\'ve always run
games with an adult bent...

In zero g, a chainsaw is too dangerous to anybody around the weilder.
Who will be spinning wildly due to the action/reaction laws. :-)

Axes are *only* useful for chopping, and if you get close to an
axe-weilder, he can\'t hit you with it.

A sword, especially a cutlass, can be used both to stab *and* to slice
(draw cut). Both make closing with the weilder inadvisable. 

And while they won\'t be much use against armored personnel, against
folks in regular vacuum suits a cutlass is a real terror weapon. 

A stab wound can be patched, though peraps with some difficulty. What
do you do with someone who has taken a *slash* across the front of his
suit, resulting in a 1-2 foot *gash* spewing air?

Also, if blows glance off controls panels, a sword is more likely to
leave them intact. An axe tends to ruin the panel.

homebuilts are registered as "experimental"? The rules are a *lot* looser.

And according to the laws Congress passed (enabling legislation)
because of the Space Treaty, the *commerce* department makes the rules
for spacecraft, not the FAA. 

The biggest difference between the "Space Treaty" and the various
international agreements about aviation is one thing. But it makes a
*huge* difference. It was almost certainly included (by the USSR) with
the express intent of making *private* space ventures as hard as
possible.

Under the aviation treaties, while the governments do things like
license and certify operators and vehicles, the liability for anything
that goes wrong rests with the people who did it.

Under the space treaty, the liability rests with the *goverment* of the
people who did it. 

That makes the "proper" laws a bureaucrats dream, and an entrepreneur\'s
nightmare. Because it give the government an *unassailable* reason for
holding veto power over everything you do.

Now THAT brings back memories for ME! Back in 1989 I ran a Star Trek (FASA)
RPG game at a con where three Starship captains -- one Fed, one Klingon and
one Romulan -- were stolen from their ships by a mysteriously powerful being
and sent them on a quest to find the most mystical object for their race and
to bring them back to the being.

For the Fed (human): The Holy Grail
For the Klingon:     The Sword of Kahless
For the Romulan:     The Cloak of Greatness (wearer could turn invisible
                     at will)

Early in the quest, the three captains encountered a small village where
they were captured by the locals and taken before their leader, the
"Mistress of Tabu" (sic).  Ah...you can see where this is going can\'t you?
She answered their most pressing questions, but then demanded payment. Since
they didn\'t have money, she pointed to the Romulan and said "You! Romulan!
In here...NOW"!

Never thought I\'d see a player\'s face turn GREEN! :) :)

Yes, I\'m pretty sure there is. The trick is that many contracts avoid
it by being set up such that there\'s no place *for* a small business to
do anything.

It\'s rather like the way they avoid "competetive bidding" by writing to
specs for the item to be purchased in such a way that only the desired
vendor *can* meet them.

Ok. In the future, keep in mind that "great circle" *does* refer to a

I remember the controversy. I also seem to remember that it was loud
enough that we *didn\'t* sign *that* treaty.

Heck, dig up a copy of Arthur C. Clarke\'s short "I Remember Babylon".
It has a deal that\'d go over *great* these days. In essence, a DBS
setup (direct broadcast satellite) that, being outside US territory can
ignore US censorship laws. And Saudi laws, and Iranian laws, and...

They don\'t charge for it (after all, scrambling the signal defeats the
purpose). They make their money off of advertising. 

AAnd also, they didn\'t really *care* about making money, since in this
case it was a plot by the KGB to corrupt the US. As they pointed out in
the story, can you just *picture* the US trying to argue *in favor* of
censoring "international broadcasts because the country they are aimed
at doesn\'t approve of the content? Not while Voice of America and Radio
Free Europe still exist! We\'d get laughesd out of whichever forum we
tried the argument in!

And jamming a signal from space isn\'t terribly practical. 

There was a similar story in Analog 10 or 15 years back about "Radio
Free Luna". There were moonbases belonging to various governments, and
some enterprising souls managed to buy, trade for, or salvage enough
gear to build their own habitat. At first they survived by doing "odd
jobs" for the other bases. They they hit on the idea of doing radio
broadcasts to Earth. Stuff like news *without* the spin various
governments give, uncensored records, stuff like that. 

They survived by being scrupulously *neutral, and not *quite* being
annoying enough for the folks on earth to go after them (or the bank
accounts they use to buy supplies with advertising money). The other
folks on the moon *officially* have little to do with them.

Unofficially, nobody on the moon can be bother about that sort of
thing. Kepping things running ok is more important than following the
rules earth sent up about who you can get parts from or who you can
allow to supply labor on jobs. 

I don\'t recall if the story mentions it, but a setup like that on the
moon would have some marked advantages. The antenna is best laid out as
a set of radials, not a tall tower. So that saves on materials *and* is
easier to build. 

The high power stages of the transmitter will (of course) use tubes,
since semiconductors just don\'t handle those power levels. Being in a
fairly decent vacuum, you can just step out side in a suit to build the
power tubes. Build a shack around them, seal it, and pump it out to
required quality of vacuum. It can be pretty flimsy since the
difference between the .001 atm "dirty vacuum" around a base and the
.000001 atm "high quality vacuum" the tubes want isn\'t going to exert
measurable force on the walls. :-)

Only one small problem with that. It\'s called the Outer Space Treaty. It and
the LTBT (and probably the CTBT) would have to be modified to specifically
allow the deployment of nukes in cislunar space for asteroid defensive
purposes.

Does anyone remember METEOR?

Well, you have to keep in mind that they *can\'t* hear everything that
gets appealed to them. It\'s simply not possible.

Well, it\'s possible for Congress to write laws with a clause that says
that if there\'s a challenge to the law, it gets "fast tracked" to the
Supreme Court. They did that with the ill-fated Communications Decency
Act a few years back. And the SC basicly told them that they weren\'t
*allowed* to regulate speech that way. So Congress hasn\'t put that
clause in the recent attempt to replace the CDA (which has the exact
same flaws the SC threw out the first one over!). Which means it\'ll
take years of court battles before *it* fets thrown out. 

And then there\'s the case where appeals of different cases involving
the same law lead to different rulings in two different Federal
Circuits (or is it Districts?). Anyway, then the SC has to get
involved. 

Another factor is that if you *win* your case in a lower court, you
can\'t appeal. And the State and Federal prosecutors aren\'t about to
appeal cases that might get laws they want to keep thrown out. 

So just about every time someone can afford the time and legal talent
to challenge many of the gun laws, they win in a lower court, and the
government declines to appeal. Usually, this happens at a low enough
level that it doesn\'t affect the standing of the law outside some very
limited geographical area.

Here\'s an example of the kind of nonsense that\'s gone on. The BATF
(Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) has to process applications
for the "tax stamp" that is needed to own certain types of weapons. 

At one time, they got the cute idea of stopping all transfers and
purchases of such weapons by declining to accept the forms (or maybe it
was by declining to *print* any). 

This got challenged in court, and made it up pretty far before the
court ruled that if they weren\'t going to allow people to apply for the
stamps, then they couldn\'t then turn around and prosecute people for
not having the stamps!

As I understand it, the feds declined to appeal that to the Supreme
Court (good thing for them, since the SC would have been able to hand
them their heads on a platter *without* having to rule on whether or
not requiring the stamps is a violation of the 2nd amendment). 

The BATF just started processing the paperwork again, rather than risk
what could happen if someone *else* appealed.

We actually have groups (most calling themselves "militias") that are
already organizing and planning for armed revolt. Whether or not they
can carry it off is another matter. Most stay (barely) within the laws.
Every so often, one will slip up (or get tricked) and violate some
federal law and get shut down.

Well, part of the problem is that the law *isn\'t* vaguely worded. At
least in my opinion, the folks claiming it is are really straining both
common sense and the rules of English.

Oh, I agree. And there\'s still the hope of creating the type of
situation where they *have* to rule.

That\'s the one I was looking for.  Cheers.  Couldn\'t remember which one it
was.  Anyhow, someone pointed out that the most violent acts (in terms of
casualties and visciousness) are perpetrated (in war) against those most
similar to us.  The scale of casualties by Americans against Americans in
the ACW would tend to support that argument, methinks.

The way it works is that under that treaty, the asteriod is "common
property of all humanity" or some such. So you could drag it to earth,
refine out the metals, and when you tried to sell them, they\'d just
confiscate them. And thank you for so graciously contributing to the
betterment of humanity.

Not if the government sets the fines at more than they made. Which they
can AND WOULD do. And they\'d throw everyone involved in jail as well. 

Remember, since it is the *government*, not the company, that would
have to pay the damages if that ship knocks out some important
satellites, or crashes and wipes out a good chunk of a city, they are
*not* going to settle for a mere "slap on the wrist" for ignoring their
rules.

Also, due to the way the treaty works, the government could (and likely
*would*) fine the *passengers* as well. Because *they* are guilty of
"conducting space activities" without permission too. 

So the passengers would turn around and sue the company. More likely,
they\'d have been told in advance that they\'d be arrested upon landing
if they took the trip. Which would severely reduce the passenger pool.

You have to keep in mind the fact that the gravity well of the planet
acts like a "funnel, and will "focus" the spread out stuff so as to
result in more of it hitting the target than you\'d otherwise think.

Also, depending on the size of the rock, 5-10 weeks out is kinda hard
to pull off. For an object moving at 30 km/sec (earth\'s orbital
velocity) 5 weeks is 90 million km (.6 AU). 10 weeks is 180 million km
(1.2 AU).

That\'s a *long* ways off to detect a body only a few km across. And
since it\'d take weeks (or at least *a* week, if you use jump) to get to
where you can *try* to break it up, you have to detect it even
*farther* away.

Now add in the fact that it\'ll take *weeks* of observation to pin down
the body\'s orbit well enough to determine if it\'ll hit or miss.

This is why Spacewatch *desperately* needs more telescopes and
observing time. So they can locate potential hazards far enough in
advance that something can be done.

I thought the UN had a rule against soverign nations
exploiting space (presumably to stop the USA and Soviet Union
having a war over who owned the Moon whilst the rest of the
planet had no access to space at all)

The implication was that private individuals could do what they want.

Yep. One of the first things I programmed when I was learning BASIC on
an HP-3000 timesharing system, accessed via 110 bps *teletype*
terminals was to recreate the teleprinter output they had at the start
of each episode of UFO.

It was actually better than most US SF on the tube at the time!

And for that matter, SHADO and the rest would make a nice campaign all
by themselves! I daresay you could even turn it into the basis for an
alternate history of the Traveller universe!

Hmmm, I\'m not sure about that.  IIRC the character in the Bible who touched
the Ark of the Covenant was \'merely\' trying to stop it falling when the
carriers stumbled wasn\'t he?  Presumably he\'d have not had any evil designs
on the thing itself and was genuinely trying to help.

Oh no!  I\'ve just realized that this is Leonard I\'m arguing with!  My
apologies, I should be struck down myself for even thinking about
disagreeing...

That\'s because you\'re tripping over the "interest on the interest"
problem.

With your calculation (finding the monthly rate), to convert into an
annual calculation, try this

= ((1+ RATE(40*12 , -1, 192)) ^ 12) - 1

which gives 5.719%

However, if your repayment schedule assumes that at the beginning of
each year, the interest is added to your current debt which is then paid
off at a fixed amount per month, then the rate of 5.522% is correct.

I can\'t remember which is the official definition of APR.

The mercenary cruiser in _A Dagger at Efate_ was under computer

A piece of paper would stop them for all of about ten seconds, long
enough to turn on the shredder and feed it through.

Who would stop the people with the nukes from using them?

Remember, the only ecosystem we have, is hanging in the balance.

Now, if you were referring to permanent deployment \'just in case\' then
yes, the treaty would have to be modified. But Niven\'s Law says people
don\'t do giant projects until they have no other choice, so I don\'t see a
permanent deployment of asteroid hunter nukes until _after_ the first
dino-killer comes our way.

Then, if we get it, the treaty\'s toast anyway. If we don\'t get it, the
treaty doesn\'t matter, as we\'ll have to be brushing up on our
flint-knapping skills.

Absolutely. It would be some sort of engineered protein with an exotic
metal complex necessary for enzymatic activity. The thing is harmless
unless they\'ve got an elevated level of the metals in their system.

XTML was a short-lived schism of the main TML when a bunch of CT grognards
decided they didn\'t want to play with us TNE heathens anymore and formed
their own list, which soon consisted of about 80% crossposts from the main
list; traffic soon dwindled to pretty much nothing. It died along with the
unfortunate demise of GDW,  and was folded back into this list at the
time of the Ramshackle Edition (T4).

Really? Huh. I\'ve never seen that happen in Canada. Honestly.
Taking a extremely unscientific sample (me reading the Toronto
Sun over lunch once in a while) relatively few crimes around
here are committed with guns. The last crime involving a gun
(earlier this week) involved a _replica_ handgun.

Other notable crimes of late:

 - a six (? I forget the age) year old girl was discovered 
   dismembered, in several bags, near a local lake shore
 - Paul Bernardo (not so recent), another sex-related killing
 - A teenanger was swarmed by a group of teens and killed over a
   dispute about cigarettes
 - A man who worked as a household cleaner/personal servant was
   arrested for taking picture of his female employeers nude and 
   stealing their belongings

Now, one may conclude that either I or the Toronto Sun are obsessed with sex
but the Sun loves gun violence just as much, believe me. I have little to
worry about with regard to guns in Toronto (or so I perceive anyway). I 
live near one of the worse parts of town (Parkdale) and the biggest threat
there? Stepping on a used needle or being accosted by someone leaving the
mental health center. "Packin\' heat" may work in Florida, but I don\'t see
it helping house, feed or cure anyone\'s sexual deviancies around here.

Oh, yay. Great fix. In a state that takes in a large part of

not seem a little counter-productive to you?

Anyway, the "criminals will have guns anyway" argument doesn\'t
hold with me. Maybe it\'s a Canadian thing.

Get RealPC or Virtual PC, install DOS and then you can run Galactic...It

As far as Mac Trav utilities, aside from Rob\'s stuff, there\'s not much.

But there\'s a lot of non-trav related stuff that\'ll maske your life
easier.

First, go get FinderPop. The Mac has much more customizable context menus
(like right clicking in Windows), but you have to press the control key
when you click. FinderPop (pintware, send enough to the author to cover
the cost of a pint ;-) has a setting that lets you click and hold, and
then the menu pops up. Still only need one button!

If you get something like a trackball, you can assign the right key the
context menu key combo. But I like FinderPop a LOT, so much so that I find
myself holding the left mouse button down at work, vainly waiting for the
context menu to pop up on my PC.

There\'s a new book out from O\'Reilley, a cross platform Windows <-> Mac

You\'re going to _hate_ that stupid hockey-puck mouse (I know, I\'m a

Get a MacWarehouse catalog, there\'s a company, I believe it\'s MacAlly,
that makes replacement plastic sides for the puck mouse that turn it into
a more normal mouse shape, for about $9. The part just pop off and on, so
no warrantee problems. Otherwise, so far as I\'ve seen just about any USB
mouse or trackball works, (even if they have PeeCee only drivers, plug \'em
in...the Mac driver generally works), ditto for keyboards.

Final bit of general advice: if in doubt, try dragging the file onto the
application, drag\'n\'drop is a LOT more pervasive in the MacOS than it is
in Windows.

And a European one, AFAIK. Although sometimes they don\'t need them.
Don\'t tell anybody <grin>, but banks here in Vienna are robbed the 
following way (speaking from personal experience and extensive 
questioning of natives afterwards).

An individual just stands in the cue with the customers, waiting 
patiently. When it is his turn, he *quietly* says "Ueberfall," that 
is, "Robbery." The cashier has strict instructions never to risk 
anything in such a case, so he simply gives the criminal the cash he 
has available. Then the criminal *walks* away from the bank and 
disappears. Sometimes, customers do not even notice that the bank has 
been robbed, and I am pretty sure that none of those criminals has a 
gun.

Now drop your usual trigger-easy PCs on a planet where things go like 
this, and have them wonder if they should rob a bank themselves... 
<grin>.

Btw, this is somewhat nasty, and I apologize for it,  but I asked 
precisely that to a native austrian, i.e. if it wouldn\'t be a 
temptation for some foreigners, let\'s say americans (or even 
spaniards like me), to rob a bank if they knew this is the style 
here. The answer was that that would never happen, because an 
american could never correctly pronounce "Ueberfall," and hence the 
cashier would never understand him...

Sometimes I feel like I haven\'t changed countries, but planets.

Damn! Forgot the ObTrav.

ObTrav: The characters, as they are about to lift from the ground
(in their ship) are approached by a man (could be any person) 
seeking passage off-world. He doesn\'t seem too interested in where 
they\'re going (or may seem very interested in the destination,
regardless of where it is). He has cash in hand to pay for the passage
and no great cargo to speak of - just some hand luggage (unusual for
an interstellar trip).

Possibilities:

1. All is as it seems. The man is a business entrepreneur looking
for markets for his new series of media productions. His luggage
contains a few changes of clothes and a couple of media disks containing
samples of his shows/recordings/etc.

2. The man is a paranoid schizophrenic who believes that he looks
identical to a man who the police are searching for in relation to 
a rather recent gruesome killing. He has a faint resemblance to 
the pictures of the alleged killer, but is unlike to be arrested on those
(or any) grounds. If they players start asking too many questions or 
seem like they may suspect him of something he has a handgun and will 
try to kill the PCs and take over the ship (perhaps in jump).

3. The man has heard that there is a booming market in \'illicit activities\'
(Hm, does that break the no-sex rule Kenji?) on the destination world. While
this may or may not be true, he is slightly edgy and will avoid question 
about the purpose of his trip. He does have a handgun packed, but will not
use it under normal circumstances. About a week after arriving the local
authorities will be looking for him in conjunction with a criminal
investigation and he will try to make a hasty escape - perhaps with the PCs.

4. The man is a wanted criminal for several sex-related killings. He is 
dangerously insane. he will "hold off" for a few days, but towards the 
end of jump will break down and try to attack and kill one of the PCs.
If successful, he will attempt to hide his crime in some grizzly way
(I don\'t have to spell it out, just pick something gruesome). He doesn\'t
have a gun, but has a large selection of extremely sharp knives in his
luggage.

5. The man is a wanted criminal and the orbital naval authorities 
will attempt to make an arrest. The man has a big gun and will try to 
take the bridge and force the PCs to outrun/fight the naval ships
and jump to (temporary) saftey.

No idea regarding how many or how fast. But "How big a boom" and the
effects of a boom are fairly simple. 

You see, what goes wrong is that things heat up. As they do, they
*expand*. The proper functioning of a suppressor requires that the
bullet pass thru a bunch of washers that seperate a series of chambers.
There has to be a fairly close fit (ie not too much of a gap between
the bullet and the washers) or the suppressor doesn\'t suppress the
noise.

Now, heat this assemblage up *and* subjection to all the vibration
inherent in full auto fire. How long before a bullet clips the edge of
a washer? 

When it does, it\'ll get deflected and almost certainly *jam* in the
next washer. Now the next round fires and you\'ve got what is
effectively a *blocked barrel*!

Luckily suppressers operate at lower pressure than the barrel. The
whole idea is for the expanding gases to expand into those chambers, so
that when the bullet clears the suppressor, the pressure is to low to
make a "bang", but instead makes a more subdued "pop". 

But you are still dealing with metal being ripped apart by pressure.

I\'ve already been offered a copy of "Consider Phlebas". If I like it, I

Got a chapter and verse for that? Or at least a chapter? 

I grabbed a copy of the King James Bible off the net the other day, so
I can look stuff like that up. There are several "better" versions, but
I\'d have had to grab them a chapter at a time, and that\'s take

Oh you will....CP is so incedibly "Traveller" I was convinced Iain was a 
gamer until I asked him.  He said he\'d always wanted to try but was a little 
intimidated by not knowing how.  If only I lived nearer to Scotland I\'d have

I think it\'s \'migo\' to answer. That one should be either classified 
\'Delta Green\' or handled by NRO Section DELTA for Majestic 12. ;-)

ObRPG: if looking at this kind of scenario consider Pagan 
Publishing\'s \'Delta Green\' for a scary take.

Now is the time of the Gathering, when the stroke of a key will unleash
a spray of Pepsi on the keyboard.  In the end, there can be only one....

**end quote from October 1999**

As I\'m sure you guessed, the "near-c rocks" issue came up again shortly
thereafter.

More recently, we\'ve been working on the Annual TML 2d Amendment

On a more positive note, C**f is still off the list....

Well, the Court is also limited in that the issues it can rule on can
only be brought up in the specific form that come to it though the
appeals court. They often wait for just the right case, so as to settle
issues in the broadest fashion possible, to clear up the mess once and
for all. So iften they will not immediately choose relvant cases.

Also, most, if not all gun laws are _state_ laws not federal ones; the
various state supreme courts have to rule on those, before the federal
court sytem even gets a crack at it.

And finally, thanks to the partisan %%#$@%#\'s in Congress, the US
Federal court system is woefully understaffed, as they have consistently
refused to even hold hearings on judicial appointments in the main.

I don\'t care what your opinon of Clinton and his administration is,
blocking juducial appointments on the basis of partisan politics is not
governance, but political games.  The R\'s seem to have the idea of \'We
don\'t like your politics, so we just won\'t approve any judges until we
get someone in the presidency that we like...until then the American
people can go hang...\'

This is exactly the kind of thing that caused Cleon I to become Emperor
Cleon....

Well, as someone who hadsn\'t "migrated" but has "expanded my horizons"
by picking up old Macs (I\'m now up to an SE) I can tell you the things
that I found usefull. 

First, Z-Term. It\'s a decent terminal program, supports PC characters
and ANSI fairly well, and let\'s you use Zmodem to move stuff around. 

You\'ll also want copies of the Mac archivers Stuffit (produces SIT
files) and Compact Pro (CPT files). And a copy of BinHex 4. These will
make getting software from BBSes or via email *much* easier.

Well, a 10% reduction in efficiency corresponds to around a 40% reduction in payload for a typical design.  Most \'alternative launch systems\' have one thing in common: they\'re experimental and not yet ready for production.  It doesn\'t take any special assumptions to have a design which will be ready for use in 2005 to outperform a design which was finalized in 1982.

Nothing in what I said is contradicted by multi-stage rockets.

Calling it a \'model rocket\' at that point is pushing it, but I can believe its possible.  I doubt the payload percentage is very high, though.

Leonard (very fairly) asked:

Drat!  I knew you\'d ask that.  Fortunately, I work in a Library and after a
bit of a hunt...

2 Samuel 6   (and the same story in 1 Chronicles 13)

the relevant bit is this for those who can\'t be bothered to look it up:

"Once more David called together the best soldiers in Israel, a total of
thirty thousand men, and led them to Baalah in Judah, in order to bring
there God\'s Covenant Box, bearing the name of the Lord Almighty, whose
throne is above the winged creatures.  They took it from Abinadab\'s home on
the hill and placed it on a new cart.  Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab,
were guiding the cart, with Ahio walking in front.  David and all the
Israelits were dancing and singing with all their might to honour the Lord.
They were playing harps, lyres, drums, rattles, and cymbals.

As they came to the threshing-place of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah
reached out and took hold of the Covenant Box.  At once the Lord God became
angry with Uzzah and killed him because of his irrevrance.  Uzzah died
there beside the Covenant Box, and so that place has been called Perez
Uzzah (Punishment of Uzzah) ever since.  David was furious because the Lord
had punished Uzzah in anger."  (Today\'s English Version - something of a
paraphrase - i.e. \'liberal modern language\' translation).

(It then goes on about David being too scared to move it, it blessing the
home of the guy who stored it for 3 months, and then David - having heard
about the blessing - moving it to Jerusalem.  He dances in front of it
wearing very little and has his wife object to the embarrassment.  The
chapter bluntly finishes: "she never had any children".)

A commentary I found says this:
"The punishment of Uzzah has often been objected to as excessive,
especially as his intention was good.  Addording to the law the ark had to
be treated with very great reverence as a symbol of God\'s presence, e.g.,
not to be touched but carried on staves (Exodus 25:14,15. cf Numbers
4:15,20).  The majesty of the holy One was symbolized by the ark.  It was
necessary to teach the Israelites the infinite holiness of God even if by
\'terrible acts\'.  The ark had been in the house of Abinadab for between 70
and 80 years.  His son Eleazar had been consecrated to care for it (1
Samuel 7:1).  Uzzah and Ahio must have been sons of Abinadab in the wide
sense of \'descendants\' - in this case \'grandsons\'.  Having had the ark so
long in their home they might have been expected to have learned the sacred
regulations concerning it.  The narrative shows, however, that neither
they, nor David, nor his advisers, did so, although the priests and Levites
were concerned in the arrangements (1 Chronicles 13:1-8).  The Levitical
laws laid down that the ark must be carried by the Levites, but they could
not come near it till it was covered by the priests, and they must not
touch it except by staves on pain of death (cf. Numbers 4:5, 15, 19, 20.
See also 1 Chronicles 15:2)."


For further adventures of the Ark (called the Covenant Box in the version I
have to hand) try 1 Samuel 4, 5, 6 and the beginning of 7.  Here you get
all sorts of stuff about the disasters that the Philistines experienced
when they captured the Ark in a battle.

Urh, an hour and a quarter with two of us dividing the work and a fast
University connection... <cough>.  I *didn\'t* say that.


Anyway, to find an obligatory Traveller bit I\'m sure you\'ve all been
thinking up ways that an odd religion might have a sacred object with just
such characteristics even if it\'s not the actual Ark as has been discussed.
Elvis\' guitar anyone?  But how about if there was some perfectly valid
(scientfic) reason why it does kill anyone who touches it?  I\'m sure
Leonard will have a few up his sleeve.

There are fully enabled versions of Rob\'s other Traveller material at 
my website:

http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/


Otherwise:

Commercial:
MacLink Plus 11 - Conversion software for dealing with PCs
Toast 4 - CD Authoring
Stuffit Deluxe - Mac Standard Compression software

Other:
Palm Desktop - organiser software free from Palm.com which works 
great as a stand alone package.
Fetch - FTP software
Eudora Lite (or full)
Escape Velocity (shareware game)
Marathon collection (3D shooter)

That\'s all I can think of off the top of my head.

Tip: If you\'re playing a CD and launch another app (eg Eudora and 
check the mail) and the sound disappears, click on the little 
microphone & CD symbol on the control strip (the little tab on the 
side of your screen if enabled, which allows you to change the sound 
source). When MacOS went to version 8.1+ any app can change the sound 
sources - ocassionally, you may want to reselect the original 
settings.

Tip2: If you click and a half (ie click then hold down) the mouse 
pointer turns to a magnifying glass and you can open folders with it 
by placing it over them and waiting. You can navigate down a number 
of layers like that and when you release only the last window (and 
the first) remains open. This also works if you drag a file over a 
folder and hold it with the button depressed.

And I am jealous of your G4, but welcome to the lands beyond the 
Wintel Hegemony ;-)

Given that the major powers are reverting to the time honored tradition of blowing off (or blowing away) minor powers that get in their way, it appears that the real barrier to the exploitation of these resources is likely political opposition by!
  e!
nvironmental/humanitarian/anti-tech factions in the developing nations and the chilling effect that nebulous property rights will have upon both potential developers and the financial community.  Still, the potential is so huge that SOMEBODY, somewhere is likely to start in a couple of decades once costs to orbit are brought down by the coming SSTO\'s.

Back in WWII, the M-1 Garand annoucned it was empty by ejecting the
stripper clip with a very loud pinging noise.  Germany troops would hear
this sound and try to move in the few seconds in would take the Ami to reload.

Then the Americans for a spring that made the exact same noise...

The same reason that the US Army has a Cavalry Division.  Tradition!

The Imperial Marines trace their lineage to the Sylean Navy\'s Landing
Force.  That service traces back to a Rule of Man Marine unit that was
stranded on Sylea during Twilight.  The RoM Marines trace back to the
Terran Confederation, which drew shock troops from units like the USMC, the
Royal Marines, various elite airborne units.

So the concept of the Cutlass is an important link to the Marines\' long
history.  In practise, the Marines teach swordplay as a conditioning
exercise, as a method of improving body control (important when you are
fighting in battle dress), and as an easy shipboard recreational activity.

I think Tommy makes an important point about violence.
Well educated and materially comfortable people are
less likely to be violent than uneducated and poor
people.  I won\'t speculate as to causes, but I think
that the correlation is real.  (It\'s also pretty well
recognized that the only factor related to declines in
the birth rate across cultures is increased
education.)  
Traveller doesn\'t have UPP codes for general education
level and standard of living, although these are
obviously very important factors in trying to
understand what a place will be like.  How might we
arrive at numbers for these factors, using the
information that we have? 

Conceivably all of the other UPP codes and trade
classifications relate to them.  

A slightly more subtle factor to add to an expanded
UPP might be wealth disparity.  The average per capita
income might be Cr10,000, but 1% of the population
might be getting MCr1 while 95% are getting only
Cr1,000.  This is a very different planet than one
with the same average per capita income but 85% of the
population is getting it.  How could we come up with a
code for this?

That is an enjoyable but very dated story.  The KGB,
as I recall, were sending pornographic images --
mostly off Indian temple walls -- set to music.  They
thought people would simply become transfixed to their
televisions and first world productivity would dry up.
 
What must Clarke think if he sees TV today?  You can
see things on prime time that are more explicit than
many Indian temple sculptures, cable channels
broadcast totally hard core pornography, you can find
anything
on the Internet -- and first world productivity is as
high as ever, the economy is booming, military
readiness is high, etc. (and people are transfixed to
their tvs and computers).

(Well, I think Clarke told the story a little
tongue-in-cheek, so he probably doesn\'t think much
about it today.)

Ob Traveller:  This could be a problem on individual
worlds, I suppose, and even between worlds.  "Damn
those Efati, buying our lesser moon and setting up a
transmitter on it, to bombard us with decadent, impure
images.  They are seeking to subvert our culture.  We

I\'m told that my German pronunciation is really very
good, but I have heard the Austrian dialect and think
that perhaps your friends have a point.  

Maybe the tourist robbers could borrow an American
custom, and write (or better yet, type) "Ueberfall" on
a piece of paper to hand it to the teller.  We do that
here because there are so many immigrants, both
robbers and tellers, who might not speak mutually
understandable versions of English.  

This should not be too big a problem for PCs wanting
to rob a bank.  A computer\'s translation program
should be able to generate a note in a known local
language.

Elvis\'s guitar won\'t kill you in my Traveller

sex.  

There is no scientific explanation, but everyone I\'ve

The exact effect of the D&D3\'s pricing on the market is pretty much 
speculation at this point.  There is the distinct possibility that the only 
thing that happens is that WotC cuts their profit margin and sales don\'t 
spike as they hope.

 From my POV, I don\'t think that D&D3 will be a bad thing for the 
industry.  I think it will shake things up a bit, but anything that gets 
people into the hobby is good for the entire hobby.  Hence, products like 
GURPS Lite and "entry level" games (like the $10 D&D and Alternity boxed 
sets) are great tools for bringing people into the industry.

    Hopefully they don\'t use the dreaded Poke-\'n-Hope electronic scoring
method, a good ref is a thousand times better than just charging in and
hoping your button hit\'s in the 1/25th of a second before your opponents.
    Okay! Okay! The marines used the Cutlass, that\'s a given. My point was
that the Navy used it for about five time longer but they don\'t seem
interested in it.

	IIRC, the cutlass is the "standard shipboard weapon."  It
	is perhaps the best all-around blade weapon available, and
	as someone pointed out it requires only one hand.  In close
	quarters it can be quite effective, but any PC that I have
	ever seen with a choice will grab a snub pistol or a laser
	instead.  I think that it was probably included in Traveller
	initially for colour.  As a rationalization, tradition and

    Reading this I just realised that in the last few boarding actions I\'ve

who\'se no good at vacc suit and the others don\'t want him just spinning in

	I while ago, something like this was bounced around.  I
	think of jump-space as acting (in some ways) like a sphere
	with real-space the surface.  Deeper arcs down into the
	sphere "move" faster and spend about the same time in
	transit.  Normal jumps are restricted by the size of the
	sphere, while missjumps involve hops to other spheres.

        Well, I use the CT rules as the foundation for the game.  I have
several "house-rules" governing situations to add detail or flavor.  My
entire millieu (TNEC) is non-canon.
        Classify me as a confirmed heretic.

Same here, basically.  I haven\'t run a game in almost ten years, except
for TFOS... but as I am writing a series of space opera novels and
stories, it\'s easier for me to make up adventures that are set therein.

Actually I\'m a REAL heretic.  One of the culture clashes between the
interstellar powers in my universe was that some of the aliens used a warp
propulsion for FTL (that the players could never figure out) and others
(the ones that the players were from, natch) used Jump.  Made navigation
rather harrowing near the borders.  Then there were the Taschiin, a word
which means "gods" or "cosmic string-spinning bugs" depending upon whether
it is spoken with reverence or contempt...  they don\'t NEED ships.

I ran CT once in the CT universe but I have found that running games in
universes I am NOT writing only leads me to create characters that I then
have to spend a long time figuring out how to import back into my own
universe, which is very frustrating.  Since I also believe that magick and
technology are both applied sciences we don\'t always understand, this
makes life interesting.  I used psionics rather a lot and invented whole
bunches of powers.

HERETIC!!!  HERETIC!!!  HERETIC!!!

I know.  Just please don\'t burn me at the stake.

Hmmm carried on wooden staves, touching it is death....

why does my mind jump to conclusions like \'highly charged power cell\'
and \'functioning fusion plant\' when I read this. Particularly when it
bears the name of someone whose \'Throne is above the winged creatures\'.

I can hear the Vilani manager now...

Must have been a GURPS fusion plant, too, had fuel enogh for

Well, it had to happen.  Doug finally can put a Nasal Spray silhouette

it\'s not my keyboard, but John Harvard\'s.  Way to go!).

Gun ownership in th UK is almost non-existent, even amongst criminals.  Many
people have probably never even seen a gun (other than museums/TV etc).  The
problem the US has is that guns are already in circulation and it\'s
difficult to see how they could ever be removed.

Look at the different ways the American media portrayed Germans and
Japanese during WWII, for example. There was a greater cultural distance
between American and Japan than America and Germany -- and yet it was the
Japanese who were more demonized.

Violence has a _lot_ of roots. For a decent overview of many of the
biological factors, dig out "Dark Nature" by Lyall Watson.

Naaah, we\'ll just steal your ideas...."cosmic string-spinning bugs..."
wow, cool concept...mind if I nip off with that one? <snip snip>

There\'s a _bunch_ of us heretics about.

One question...why did the different drives mess with navigation? The
warp drives dump you out of jump or something?

I held off making an obscure point during this thread, but since it continued
(and Timothy kindly provided the reference), you make like to note that it
wasn\'t the _inside_ of the Ark that was taboo, but the "mercy seat" (throne) on
top. Inside the box were the 10 Commandments, the rules forming the Israelite
side of the covenant (the contract between God and Israel). On top of the box,
between the two golden angels (cherubim?), was built the "mercy seat". When they
sacrificed animals to cover their sin, the Israelites splashed blood around the
place as purification (church services were a lot messier in those days ;-) and
poured some on the "mercy seat". This was where God\'s presence "rested" when he
came down to talk to Moses. That is why the _outside_ of the box was taboo -
"Raiders" got it wrong in that sense.

However, having Nazis touch the thing at all is probably good enough cause for
the events at the end of the film, anyway.  ;-) ;-)

>The majesty of the holy One was symbolized by the ark.  It was
>necessary to teach the Israelites the infinite holiness of God even if by
>\'terrible acts\'.

One suggestion I have heard is that it is like paper and flame - if the paper
gets too close to the flame, it will burn up. The flame doesn\'t (necessarily)
have to be angry with the paper, that\'s just the nature of the difference
between the two: paper/flame, man/God.

>But how about if there was some perfectly valid
>(scientfic) reason why it does kill anyone who touches it?

Another suggestion I have read is that the way the box is built, with the
different metals interacting, somehow makes it an electrical capacitor. Touching
it "earths" the box, and zap! one crisped Israelite (this was a "scientific"
handwave by someone who doesn\'t like miracles, ISTR). So maybe you\'re right,
Bruce.

Anyway, this is swerving violently OT (...um, I mean Off Topic, not Old
Testament, you realise ;-), and I do have an ObTrav, so:

I\'ve mentioned this before - quite recently, sorry for the repeat - but there is
a JTAS Amber Zone that deals with a vase belonging to a cult. If  non-cult
member sees the vase, the cult has to kill them. If the PC\'s don\'t open the box
containing the vase, but just hand it over, the cult goes away happy.

I liked the "box in a derelict starship" idea, BTW - and endorse the
recommendation to browse SJG\'s "Warehouse 23" for more "toys". All of these are
nasty "treasures" to hand out, if you have overly curious PC\'s!!

And still are.  I am mixed enough to pass for white and have, when outside
California with someone I\'m dating, frequently been bothered by ignorami
who just have to make some numbnut comment about Pearl Harbor or "J--
lovers".  In Nebraska my ex-husband and I were actually THREATENED in a

"I\'m Chinese, we were on your side asshole" but nobody offered him fifty
cents...

We\'re just going with the flow. This way we get *two* parties for the 
end of the Millennium. And as the AD  start date is out we could 
stretch this to the whole decade?

So long as I don\'t see it in a novel before I publish mine, feel free to
use it in your game.  I\'m flattered.  I got the idea from reading a bunch
of late 80\'s Thelemic/Voudoun writings about the Haitian Spider Gods that
can go anywhere in space and time by traversing a giant web.  It crossed
my mind that this could be true if the web was made of cosmic string.

The problem was that like the Zariguin I had based them on, a very few
weird Taschiin thought humaniti were interesting.  One thought so enough
to shapeshift itself into a male Talassani form and become the leader of a
cult.  The members of this cult wanted to have his babies, so it
manipulated itself and created something similar enough to human germ
cells that actual pregnancies resulted... and one of the most annoying and
most loved NPC\'s in the storyline was one of the resulting offspring.

"Don\'t get angry with him, Marcus-- he\'s as human as one of your
rosebushes."

"My rosebushes don\'t wander around on their own accord spreading chaos and
meddling in interstellar politics!"

Tisselen had his Lovecraftian moments, but he genuinely meant no harm.  He
just forgot that humans were more fragile than he was and couldn\'t
manipulate atomic forces and things.  He also got attached to several
rather important people, which was a mixed blessing if you were one of
them.

People using different FTL propulsion systems couldn\'t see each other
coming; when they were not in normal space, they were in different
non-normal spaces.  They might come out in the same place.  And they
couldn\'t always communicate even if their governments were getting along.

Which they often were not.

You could, if you were VERY unlucky, jump into a patch of warped space in
someone else\'s wake.  Or have a starship come out of jump right in front
of your starship.  Not cool.  Led to Philadelphia experiment moments if
you were lucky, which PC ships always were.

This happened very infrequently whether I used CT rules or ST RPG rules
(depending on which side was playing).

"Damn Talassani!"

IMTU, the Ine Givar are heavily factionalised, so there are groups that
disagree with all their demands.  

That said, other common demands are respect for the rights of non-humans
(especially Vargr, and Dandies), and various permutations of democracy and
independence.  Pro-Sword Worlds factions tend to water down the
pansophontist demands (being a bunch of Solomani-chauvinist backsliding
scum), while some of the pro-Zhodani/pro-psionics oriented groups still
favour Zhodani-style psionic oligarchy, despite being in a distinct
minority in the IG.

The pansophontism gives rise to some interesting conflicts, where the Ine
Givar end up supporting Vargr communities threatened by human supremacist
groups, like Rule of Terra and Superioriti.  Of course the Vargr themselves
are often quite capable of defending themselves, and on occasion will
remind human mobs what the word "Corsair" means.

Going OT:  the above is actually influenced by some posts I got on another
list, on the topic of gun control!  Apparently, the civil rights movement
in the US, one of the classic "nonviolent" movements, was defended by a
very large proportion of its members possessing guns.  This resulting in
the white hood brigade suffering some very embarrassing setbacks....

The last scences, in the US theater & on my video version were of a large
warehouse in which a crate was being pushed. The crate was slowly smoking,
fading out the U.S. Army stencil.  Very X-files feel.

No, you were supposed to think "drugs".  At either Woodstock or Altamont,
can\'t remember which (I was very very small at the time) there were
announcements:  "DO NOT TAKE THE BROWN ACID!!!"  I always wondered what it
did.  Hiroshi (my rather significant and definitely other -- a friend once
said "men are from Mars, women are from Venus, and Hiroshi is from Omicron
Zeta VIII, but we love him" -- probably knows, even though it was before
his time too...)

It was there in the US release.  I remember it.  However, I had a
different interpretation.  It looked to me like the serial number
(not specifically the US stencil) was being obliterated, and without
a proper label would be as effectively buried within "the system" as
it ever was in an Egyptian tomb.  There\'s *no* telling what might be
in that unlabeled crate down in the depths of Warehouse 23.

It is also said in some quarters that certain TL 8 handheld computers can be

That\'s cos racist are cheapskates, too.

I\'m always confused by caucasians\' inability to tell
one asian race from another: usually, I get it about
right (though some chinese look korean). What\'s more,
they think it makes no difference. I went out with a
woman who sat there watching tv, and when a city
councillman came on talking about crime, she said,
"friggin bastard, you lot are all in it yourselves!"
I said, "hey, not _all_ politicians are corrupt..."
"Not because he\'s a politician, because he\'s a chink!
They\'re all in the Triads!"
"Um, Triads is a Hong Kong, southern Chinese criminal
organisation..."
"So?"
"This guy was not Chinese..."
"How do you know?"
"Well, his face for one thing, but if nothing else,
his name: Phu Ngoc Nguyen,, that\'s Vietnamese."
"So what? They\'re all the same, they\'re all in it
together."
Needless to say, I stopped seeing this girl soon
thereafter... scary thing was, she\'s a cop, in
multicultural Sydney... I would have thought that a
cop would know that you\'re not going to find a
Vietnamese in the Triads...

That\'s cause they have forgotten that there is a diff between Irish and
English and French and German and such... at least in America, you are
white, or you are "ethnic" meaning black or Asian or Hispanic (which
floors me, because Hispanics can be white, black or Asian).

And they think I am Hispanic, LOL.

Japanese political cartoons during the war portrayed the Americans as demons. 
US political cartoons tended to show the Japanese as apes or monkeys (there 
is a whole book on the subject, but I forget the title something to the 
effect of _Race and Racism . . . during the Pacific War_).

Franklin Roosevelt. It was typical of some of his generation . . .

Sorry, just visiting. My Mac is (going to be) networked to my Netware
server, along with some PCs running DR-DOS, OS/2, and Win 95 (only
because I had to get it to run some stuff). And eventually a Linux box
will join the collection.

I\'d *like* to add my old TRS-80 systems and the Franklin Ace 1200
(Apple II+ clone), but even if I track down the network cards (yes,
such actually exist!), I\'d have to write my own software, both drivers
for the cards, and NLMs on the Netware side.

I guess I\'m more like the Borg. I assimilate any useful technology and
add the diversity to my own. :-)

Actually, a very *common* speculation notes that something built
according to the description given in the Bible would be a sort of
Leyden jar. In short a *big* capacitor, capable of storing quite a bit
of energy at rather high voltage. 

Anybody who has ever forgotten to discharge a capacitor before working
on a piece of hardware can certainly understand the problem.

In theory only. The famous Miranda decision went on for more than fifty
pages before even mentioning the facts of the four cases they were suppost
to be ruling on.

Well, it doesn\'t need *different* metals. Just that the ark be built
(as it was) of an insulator (wood?) covered inside and out with metal
*and no connection between the inside and outside metal coverings.*

And trust me a capacitor that size would pack enough wallop to stun a
horse. 

It\'s also possible to build a more than adequate charging mechanism
using nothing more than water dripping from a pair of metal spouts,
thru two pairs of metal cylinders properly cross connected.

There\'s an *old*(late 60s/early 70s) Popular Science (or maybe
Scientific American) with plans for building one at home.

You get enough voltage for it to arc over a quarter inch gap.

Oh, I don\'t undersetimate human stupidity, but I
assumed that the cops would have taught them at the
Academy basic stuff like:
"The Mafia has ITALIANS in it."
"The Triads has CHINESE in it."
"The Yakuza has JAPANESE in it."
etc etc
That way, you don\'t have the embarassing thing of Don
Corleone dying of a heart attack from laughter in yur
interrogation room when you accuse him of being in the
Yakuza.
So, I though they\'d tell \'em stuff like that, but I
guess it just proves my own stupidity:(

God only knows how we manage not to be awash in crime,
with brilliant cops like these running around.

The Torah (Old Testament) has a least one MAJOR change in it during the

When it comes to canon, I\'m a heretic, by way of Classic Traveller
fundamentalism. There were a hell of a lot more options open back in those
days, and many of those options have been shut off by later developments in
the universe.

Rules? Hmmm... I\'m not sure. I might run GURPS, or I might run CT for my
next campaign. I haven\'t decided.

There was a  Harry Harrison novel (The Stainless Steel Rat....)  where
the locals took everything you brought with you and issued you a
bumblebee suit for your visit.  At what law level would a prudent planet
follow suit?  After all, they _know_ the planet next door has a higher

Once a friend of mine at school, a Korean, was asked if she was Chinese by
another friend of mine at school (who incidentally isn\'t caucasian, but
that\'s beside the point). On the way to class, she complained about the
inability of people to differentiate Koreans from Chinese.

After she was finished, I asked her what ethnic group I was from, and she
was stumped, and she got the point. Personally, I get people who have
confused me for Irish, German, English, and a host of others.

Ha ha!  That\'s really good.

On the other hand Hilton has started plans for an orbital hotel and an
aerospace firm (whose name I forget) has started making plans for
tourist cruises to the moon (orbital only no moon landing).  So,
tourism...

I used that as the epitaph for a character who died in my Mage game.

Personally I think that "Thunder Child" is the most stiurring song, as well
as having some great assonance

"Lashing ropes and smashing timbers
Flashing heat-rays pierced the deck
Dashing hopes for our deliveance
As we watched the sinking wreck"

I\'ve always had  a "Thunder Child" with a similar history of stolidly facing
superior firepower inmy Traveller games for the Solomani. For Solomani Navy
IMTU "Remember the Thunder Child" has the same status as "Remember the
Alamo" for Texans.

It\'s Sir Richard Burton\'s wonderfully resonant voice, the subsonics in that

"No-one would have believed....." are great.

Only James Earl Jones seems to approach that quality, and he\'s just not the

Ahh, that\'s nothing!  My ethnogenetic background is a mix of
Scotch-Irish, German, and Filipino, giving me olive skin, light brown
eyes, and curly brown hair.  I\'ve had people assume that I speak
Spanish, and other people ask me what my plans were for Passover.  I
have that generic Mediterranean look, I guess, yet none of my known
ancestors are from the Mediterranean region.

Even more amusing was my time in Saudi Arabia during DESERT
SHIELD/DESERT STORM.  As an Arabic linguist, I learned both Syrian and
Egyptian dialects, as well as "Modern Standard" Arabic (MSA).  Nobody in
the Arab world actually _converses_ in MSA, nor do I.  When I arrived in
Saudi Arabia, I consciously avoided speaking in Egyptian dialect, since
Egyptian dialect is largely different from MSA, while Gulf dialect is
much closer to MSA.  As a result, I tended to use Syrian dialect
pronunciations and phrasings.  Bottom line is, most Saudis with whom I
spoke asked me if I was Lebanese.  Between my Syrian/Lebanese accent,
and my Mediterranean appearance, they assumed that, while I was
obviously not a native speaker (in the sense that I do not have
native-level fluency in Arabic), I must have been a second or third
generation Lebanese.

Rather than explain all of the above, I simply told them that, while _I_
was not Lebanese, my teacher was (mostly true, BTW [I had quite a few
teachers at the military language school, some of whom were Lebanese]).

ObTrav:  I\'m given to understand that Solomani are the most physically
diverse race of humaniti.  If this is the case, then I can see cases in
which either ethnic Solomani are mistaken for one of the other races of
humaniti, or members of another race of humaniti are mistaken for
Solomani, based on the combination of appearance and accent when
speaking a given language.

Of course, many Solomani (even Imperial citizens of Solomani ancestry),
if mistaken for a "lesser" branch of humaniti, would likely take
offense.  Much comedy ensues....

Curious question then...if the Solomani are the most physically diverse,
then what parts of Earth did the Vilani and Zhodani come from?

Good question.

Does anyone else have any good questions?  ;-)

Those TMLers who own any of the supplements dealing with the Vilani and
Zhodani can probably give more information on this subject.  Sadly, I am
not among their numbers.  C\'est la vie.

Well, the ultimate explanation is simply that Canada
remains - despite the regrettable presence of
Frenchmen in the eastern regions - a Commonwealth
country, with Her Gracious Majesty as its head of
state. Whereas the more southern Americas severed
their ties with their noble monarchs some ten score
years ago, and decided to instead have a system
whereby they would have as leaders those elected on
the basis of wealth and popularity, thus ensuring that
only those of mean and low character, and shifty
demeanour, could become leaders; these people then
arise and decry indignantly the same leaders for their
lack of integrity, and claim to be genuinely surprised
at their behaviour. 

They choose to be led by peanut farmers, actors in
b-grade movies, and avoiders of military service, then
express puzzlement at the low character and poor
behaviour of the common folk. 

Therein lies the difference between the Dominion of
Canada and the Rebellious North American Colonies. But
fear not, Brittania shall rise again, and liberate the
oppressed masses of your continent, and Canada shall
be plagued no longer by the odiferous presence of the
whining masses who found their nation on the words,
"all men are created equal," written by a slave-owner.

(slightly tongue in cheek):)

It doesn\'t matter-- they were taken long before recorded history and hence
before the various ethnic groups acquired their current appearances.  The
basic differentiation between black, white and Asian looking people may have
already occurred, but maybe not.  On the Trav Cult list we sort of are
assuming that individuals were taken from most of the different groups that
existed at whatever time it was and dumped on Vland and that the Vilani are
light brown sort of Polynesian looking people with curly hair and fairly
"mixed" looking features, IIRC.

In the supplements I used to have, the Zhodani were always drawn as though
their ancestors had come from Mongo.  That sort of look can come from
Semitic, East Indian, and Asian ancestry although it really has its roots in
the demonization of the Japanese and Chinese earlier in this century and
late in the previous one.

Kyle\'s response: I would think it all depends on the
nature of the first colonists. When the future Zhodani
and Vilani got picked up, _which_ ones got picked up,
what did they look like? How old are distinct-looking
races on earth? My (guess) take on it is that the last
300,000 years have been enough to have several
distinct-looking races emerge from the original
ape-types of the African veldt, just from the
different climates and lifestyles of earth, so what
might the same period of time on different worlds do?
Were the Zho/Villy guys seeded to just two planets, or
hundreds?

When colonists left earth, if they left in distinct
ethnic groups on large (100,000 people+) ships, it\'s
easy to imagine the worlds they go to ending up
looking the same, but go to another world, and...

It also depends on how easy and common interstellar
travel is IYTU. I mean, it\'s only with the advent of
cheap intercontinental travel that we\'re getting lots
of interbreeding on earth, before that it was pretty
rare... Kiri was saying the average European can\'t
tell a frenchman from a german, and that\'s no surprise
since they\'ve been mixing for centuries, being close together...

A large part of the reason it is important to know is that the various Asian

That\'s funny.  I think that Koreans look a lot more like the Japanese than

But Chris, generally, if a white person is fairly ethnically unmixed, I

look, I guess, yet none of my known ancestors are from the Mediterranean
region.
>
LOL, same here.

I was not raised by my biological parents, and my adoptive parents were
fairly white bread types-- I don\'t look a thing like them.  What we know of
my biological parents is this:  my mother was Irish, and I do mean IRISH,
first or second generation, whereas my father was at least half Asian,
though he may have had some other type of ancestry.  It is not certain if he
was actually Japanese, but that\'s what people believed.  This is all gleaned
from various rumors and things that my adoptive mother says when she is
snockered; she knew and detested my biological mother, though she denies
this when sober.

I have VERY white skin and black-brown eyes; when you cover the lower half
of my face people instantly think I am at least half Asian, but cover the
top half of my face and they invariably guess Irish.  (My hair has been lots
of colors.  It is currently black with deep brown highlights; it was black
when I was born, lightened to brown in middle childhood, turned dark red
very briefly in my late teens, and started to go grey on my 21st birthday.
It is, however, unrelievably straight, laughs at curling irons, and has to
be permed to hold a curl longer than 20 minutes unless there is a lot of
humidity or I spray it with this Japanese "hair styling water" that is the
only thing on earth that will hold it in place.  Aqua Net also works, but
Hiroshi smokes so that\'s a bad idea...)

Asians frequently recognize that I am part Asian, and when I was in Japan,
where I felt very much at home, I could sometimes pass for a half-Japanese
or even for a Japanese if I didn\'t look people straight in the eyes.  I look
very much like the children of a white friend in Saitama who is married to a
Japanese man-- so much so that she has often been annoyed by being asked if
she is my mother, because I do not look my age and I treat her girls like
little sisters.  (I don\'t have kids of my own, and wouldn\'t know how to be a
mom if I had to.)

The funniest reaction I\'ve ever gotten was from the editor of Giant Robot,
when I was still married to His Satanic Majesty.  Eric saw me sign my name
and said:  "Kiri Ho-- Japanese first name, Chinese last name, which one of
your parents was white?"

But here, living in California, I have had little old ladies walk past three
or four legitimate Latina girls to earnestly and insistently question me in
Spanish and refuse adamantly to believe that I can\'t understand them.

I\'ve learned that the only way to get rid of them is to say, insistently,
"Supeingo ga wakarimasen yo, obaasan!" over and over and over.


My stepsister\'s Arab boyfriends used to chase me and when I was in Greece,
people assumed I was a native, as well.

Most funny of all were the restaurant experiences I routinely had with my
Chinese ex-husband.  We would frequently eat Italian food because he had
lived in Italy, and the Italian waiters would walk up to us and expect me to
order.  They would blink and stare when he would order in fluent Italian and
then they would ask me, in Italian, which I don\'t understand, if I taught
him.  He would tell them no.  This amused me.

When we went to Japanese restaurants, the reverse always happened.  This
pissed him off.  He did have kind of a Japanese look to the set of his eyes,
but he was from Hong Kong and he really hated the Japanese.  He would get
very annoyed when people reminded him that *I* was most likely part
Japanese, the same kind of annoyance that Hiroshi sometimes gets when
Koreans say that I look part Korean, only much more pronounced because Vince
was serious about his racism.

That\'s simple: you\'re a honky!  :)

Funny how many asians might call your non-caucasian friend a racist because
of their incorrect assessment.  Turn the tables on them (like you did) and
suddenly it isn\'t a racial issue anymore.

I can usually tell the difference between Chinese and other asians, and can
sometimes even get lucky picking a Korean person out of a crowd of asians.
I have a problem with Vietnamese or some of the other south-east asian
countries, however.  Don\'t know why.  Then again, I can\'t possibly tell the
difference between people of Russian, British, or French origin.  Don\'t
know why...

Now _that_ was a cool show! I guess when you roll up a
character and he gets just "admin-6" and "board
games-6", and just a blade as retirement pay, that was
where you were posted!

ObTrav: are there interstellar garbage scows? How much
would one cost? Now one of those would make an
excellent tramp trader, so long as you could persuade
one of the PCs to wash it out... I think I\'ll have to
add that to the freight tables: "garbage, destination,
nearest sun." 
Or maybe the garbage gets dumped on that prison
planet? Gives them something to play with.

  I\'m not sure about that - the one statistic that is striking is that
our murder rate is about a tenth of theirs, or an annual body count in
the US of about 90-100x ours (for a population about 8-9x larger - go
figure?). FWIW, break-ins and muggings are pretty much a barrel of laughs
compared to being shot and/or killed (I\'m guessing about that last, but
I hope that I\'ll be forgiven the liberty), so I\'ll take things as they
are. And I intend never to spend more than a weekend at a time in the US
(well, except maybe another cruise to Alaska - way cool stuff).

  As much fun as the gun nuts can be, there doesn\'t seem to be a direct
correlation between gun possession and murders - witness comparing Calgary 
& Vancouver; Alberta has the highest possession rate of the provinces
(IIRC), while Vancouver is mostly empty of firearms (regardless of the
efforts of those heroic entrepreneurs in organized crime). And yet the
murder rates are comparable at best (Vancouver is the third-largest city
in the country, but Calgary is close enough for comparison) - at worst
Vancouver is rather worse (pick your years carefully, and have fun adding
suspected murders allocated from missing persons tallies).

  I wonder how Vancouver & Seattle stack up historically, though - they
should be tolerably similar.

Just repeating what she said. Here in Philly, the dominant Asian grouping

The point isn\'t of the story wasn\'t whether or not *you* can tell, nor was
it that it\'s impossible to tell. The point is that *she* couldn\'t; it\'s
usually extremely difficult to tell various ethnicities apart if you\'re
neither exposed to them, nor given any compelling reason to tell them apart
in the first place. She never had a reason to tell various European
ethnicities apart, so it never became an issue for her.

Well, Kyle had said that he was confused by the inability of caucasians to
tell the difference between different asian ethnic groups. It\'s not like
there are flash cards, or classes which drill the differences between
varying ethnicities into people\'s heads.

The only real gaff I ever made was when I called a friend of mine Russian
after knowing him for several years. He was taken aback and he told me he
was of Welsh and French descent...

Of course, he looked (and still looks) like slightly less mad Rasputin, he
speaks fluent Russian, and his father is a Russian-Orthodox priest (and an
honorary cossack).

So, I feel that I was justified. :)

Nah, why burn you? I simply want to restart the XTML... I\'d rather isolate
myself from those "Damned GURPSies" and "T4 Weenies"... Not to mention the
"TNE Geeks, Freaks, and Gearheads".
<biting Sarcasm Off>

Seriously, tho, I\'d like to see the XTML back.... And restricted solely to
CT/MT. (No GT, TNE, T4, T5, etc.)

XTML, more properly X-boat, was killed despite protests of the most active
posters, because MWM promised us a "Revised CT", and said the only place
for info was this list, and NOT the XBML; what we got was not anything like
CT, MT, nor TNE.

I do MT, with certain tweaks. I "adjusted" the task system to att/3, and
icnreased difficulties by 1. I use the Personal/Vehicular rules for ship
combat, based upon the tables in the PM. I use Mayday\'s movement for space
combat, but tied into the large scale combat rules in Ref\'s Companion. I
use the materials in DGP MT modules. (I need to acquire all the rules
materials prior to issue 15... someone stole issues 12-14 from me...)

As far as canon goes IMTU, I stop with 1115... from there, all bets are
off. Also, nothing in canon from the start date of a campaign is "fixed",
ie, PC\'s may (and often do) make a difference.

Nothing yet, They thought  they had the gun, but it was the wrong

Why not? It is quite a stretch, but since it only need to go back along one
line (mothers) you could have a variety of other races represented on the
other side.

I don\'t care what hand-waving is done to disperse a homogenous humaniti in
the TU (O or Y), but racial variation IMNSHO would be *greater* in a far
future intersteller society. And I like variety. OK, so I\'m not objective on

The geneologies are long lost.  However; Aaron\'s bones
are not.  The distinction is genetic, not genealogical.

The folks in charge of such things have been stamping
birth certificates with a Levitical "seal" for some time
now.  The "Jewish priest" hand book is available to
whoever would read it (it has even been translated into
hundreds of different languages).

They are.  However; mission critical in food service, IT or

Well, the first traslation you list is THE kicker; at least a few sections
are written without jots and tiddles (the vowels), thus the interpretations
are "traditional" but not supported by the copus of the hebraic
originals... The most noteable "question" of this kind is whether a certain
prophet was fed by Ravens or Arabs... since the two terms are identical
except for vowels. Also, when lloking at the new testament, some was
originally in Hebrew, some in the related Aramaic, some in Greek. The Greek
and Latin Vulgates were codifications to allow Then-Mainstream-Christianity
(which is not to say it was the mainstream religion, merely the mainstream
of christianity) catholic (Soon to become Catholic and Orthodox not long
after) to codify a formal (and less interpretive) written corpus of canon
so as to better be able to fight it\'s internal wars with heresy.

Ob Trav 1: The Traveller Settings have yet to truly undergo the kind of
unification that christianity has... we have 5 official settings, all of
which differ. What is valid in the canon of one may be contradictory to the
canon of another. Additionally, the DGP materials are much like the
"Apochryphal Gospels"... those whose sect uses them admits they aren\'t part
of the mainstream anymore, but are likely to continue using them; they can
also be compared to the hebraic "Book of Lillith", which seems (from the
translation I\'ve read) to be covering a period from just after creation,
through the exile of Cain to Nod. Note also that Adam was the first jew to
get a divorce, if you accept the book of lillith....

Ob Trav 2: It is likely, that, by the time of the 3I, that the
descendant/derivative religions of Christianity will be as different as
christianity is from the common ancestor religion of Judaism,
Zorastrianism, and Islam. And, most likely, there will be at least 2 more
jewish prophets, and 1 or more miracles with celebrations; Catholocism, if
it survives, will likely have 10s of thousands of saints cannonized
(assuming the current rates of 1-4 per year...); I\'m not conversant enough
with Islam to make educated guesses there, besides that whatever grows from
it will probably not recognize most of the other islam derivatives, let
alone the other peoples of the book.

Looking at the descriptions of the Zhodani, they are obviously russified
poles.... just look at the slavic-style consonant clusters in their
language!

Seriously, though, assuming we work from the timelines, the ethnic
groupings of the time would largely be irrelevant, as they were grabbing
not Homo Sapiens Sapiens, but at best, Early Modern Humans (H. Sapiens).
Moder humanity, according to the genetic markers (Time, last spring, jan or
feb 99 I think) is only some 40,000 years old. The Anchients were snagging
Humanity some 300,000 years ago. Definitely Homo ___. Which flavor (Except
Sapiens) is not readily memorable nor determinable.

Thus. the Second Millenium of Mankind is soime 36,000 BC, the Second
Millenium of the Common Era (AKA Anno Domini Jesu Christe) is comming to a
close in days, and the second millenium according to the jewish calender is
long gone.... the chinese calendar is into (IIRC) it\'s sixth millenium.

I\'m way too young to remember this first hand, but it probably wasn\'t making
anybody sick. The physical effects of LSD, even when it\'s "bad" aren\'t
terribly impressive.

However, if I recall my Woodstock lore, and it\'s been about a decade since
last I read up on it, the brown acid was thought to be causing bad trips. It
probably wasn\'t the "fault" of the acid though, it\'s much more likely it was
simply the environment that was freaking people out.

One of the members of Jefferson Airplane (can\'t remember his name) was

was killed by them.

Some hate-group was attempting to distribute "Racial Identification
Fieldbooks" near the High School I graduated from during my senior year.
They quickly vanished... The Eskimoes, Aleuts (pronounced Al- yootz),
Tlingtit (Clink-it), Tsimshian (Sim-Shee-ahn), and Haida (Hide-uh) mixed
well, and present a terrifying force to hate groups... just don\'t call an
eskimo or aleut an "indian"....

I doubt that most imperials would know for sure their ethinic mix without
genetics for specific markers unique to specific phenotypes. Keep in mind
also, they are probably different (but faily close) species, akin to the
differences between Horses, Asses, and Zebras.

	"Consider Phlebas" has many nice ideas, though the Tech Level of 
	Culture is Very High. However, about the "barrelcrash"...

	Roughly similar events has also happened in real life. Currently 
	most warheads (at least those used in man-portable weapons) have 
	a "camo-net safety" which prevents the detonator from working 
	before the warhead has flown several meters from the launcher.

	Before camo-net safety was introduced, mortar crews were 
	sometimes killed when their grenades hit overhanging foliage or 
	camo nets.

	Probably the best-known camo safety is the one used in 40 mm 
	grenade launcher warheads. The old 40 mm HE warhead had 
	spherical pre-fragmented grenade and large spin-armed detonator. 
	When launched, the warhead had to rotate a few times (the 
	launcher has rifled barrel) before the detonator was armed.

However NZ has a higher gun ownership rate than Canada and less strict 
controls (though whether this will remain the case is questionable) has 
a voilent crime rate that is certainly no higher. Compared with 
Australia this is even more marked.

I\'ve always favoured "The Spirit of Man":

"There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man"

Hmm, my flatmates, who\'ve banned for from playing it are away right 
now...

Just confuse things within the Anglican church the prayer book says

Income distribution curves as I have usually seen them drawn (income on x axis,
%with that income or less on Y) are usually quite smooth curves, so it should be
possible to classify with a small number of parameters, or to divide into the
usual 16 fuzzy catagories,

Another parameter worth generating/calculating might be the demographic curve --
at least pre industrial (high infant mortality) vs industrial (most children
grow up) with some transition classes.

Excuse me, but CT allowed you to be killed during one
of your terms, why not at mustering out? Anyhow, I
said you took the long jump, not that you died. Since
you can survive twenty or so seconds (longer with the
GURPS breath control skill!), it could be like a
really crazy initiation issue... those who\'ve been in
the military and gone to boarding schools will
recognise this as not too far-fetched an initiation thing!

I understand there is a frummy (devout) group trying

never touching a dead person, all that kind of stuff,

So what would be the 7 Wonders of Charted Space? Any ideas? Apart from the
unfinished ringworld in the Vargr Extents I can\'t think of any canonical
feature that merits inclusion on a list of the seven most spectacular
sights of the known universe.

Also, given that with jump-6 as the top speed, a grand tour of the 7 Wonders
of Charted Space would propably take most of a decade, how about a somewhat
smaller list, like the 7 Wonders of the Spinward Marches, or possibly the 7
Wonders of the Domain of Deneb?

That was my first thought

Then I thought a slice of Terran tree with a universal airlock coupling.

...

When rolling for survival, if the survival roll is made exactly, roll 1d3[1]:

 1. lose leg 

 2. lose hand

 3. lose eye

[1] non-T4 players can roll 1d6 on the following table:

 1-2. lose leg 

 3-4. lose hand

 5-6. lose eye

He\'s currently on holidays in Europe with his family, so it could be a
while before he can answer.  I had hoped to be able to see him at Gatwick
but work commitments prevented that sadly.  :-(


To the best of my knowledge he had posted some of the Cargonaut material
but not all of it before he left.  (I think he said he was going in
chronological order of orders - as it were.)


Hope that helps.

Unless, of course, that title is attached to a scholarship letter or check, 
in which case they [just like everyone] are more than willing \'to go along to

I am going to weigh in. In my travels [one year in Europe, two in Asia] I 
have found that America cries the most about racism and not respecting 
people\'s whatever, but in Asia they all know each other\'s ethnic background 
[while after two years I could make a good guess on sight], and they mostly 
connect that first look to their entire feelings about that person, usually 
disdain or hate, and they have no problem sharing those feelings, no matter 
how rude.
In Germany the police are pretty chilled, but there was some old kaserns 
converted into refugee [Turks in one, Black Africans in the other] housing 
near some US housing areas, and there was sometimes some trouble with theft 
or desire for mating with a blonde family member wife via a form of group 
stalking. The nice guy German police would quickly whip out 3 or 4 cell 
Maglites to do some slapping with, based only on race. 
I much prefer the American attitude towards race, even with the regular TV 
breast beatings and rallies [unless, of course, they preempt Scooby-Doo]. 
"Hey, you are an Asian, are you in one of those gangs? No? Okay." is much 
prefered to "You invaded my nation X ^x years ago, I hate you, you are sub 
human" in my book.

Yes, but since they\'re so small, the gravity effects are still hard to
notice, unless you\'re _looking_ for it. They could interpenetrate you and
you wouldn\'t notice a thing, because at most they\'d snack off a few atoms
into their gravity well. Several orders of magnitude greater numbers of
atoms spontaneously fission in your body during the same time frame.

Especially when that is\'nt true. In point of fact, the \'girl who
died for her faith\'; the one who stared them down, _lived_. What she said
was attributed to another girl who died, in the mass media feeding frenzy
during the event.

But of course, it\'s makes for a much more profitable story.

Nominations:

Earth is on the list, of course.  The rosettes in Gateway Quadrant (canon or
not).  The royal palace.  Is there a black hole in known space?   A
spectacular quasar?  The Empress Wave, distance dependent on milieu,
naturally.  And a little trinket shop on a side street on Regina... but that
won\'t be on most lists, I guess ;-)

I should hope it would take the better part of a lifetime to see them all.
If any rich brat could see them all in a year or two they would not be

Well, if you look at the human face, the difference 
from person to person in really, really small. Frankly, it\'s
amazing that we can diffeentiate faces at all - but it\'s
obviously such a useful trait that our eyes and brains have
evolved very specific mechanisms to differentiate them.
That partly why people tend to see faces in all sorts of 
things, like potatoes and scrambled eggs - the brain is 
hard-wired to look for "face-shaped" things.

To add to this, people learn to tell faces apart through 
conditioning. If all you see most of your life are
"white" faces, then the first time you see a pair of,
say, Chinese people, they\'ll look very similar to each 
other because you\'re used to faces that fall within a totally
different (though still very narrow) set of parameters.

White people all look alike to asian people who have never
seen one. To quote a co-worker of my father, "all you 
white people look alike to me!". 

Also, most north americans have a very small sample size of
non-white faces to learn from with regard to differentiating
the faces of different races. I spent 2 weeks in Taiwan once
and I could tell Taiwanese people apart a _lot_ better after
that. There are a fair number of Vietnamese people in univerity
and aside from learnng that most male Vietnamese people are named
"Tran" as I met more of them I could tell them apart more easily.
(I grew up in a pretty white-bread town for what it\'s worth).

(And I\'m not trying to racist - I swear that almost every Vietnamese 
guy had "Tran" in his name somewhere. It was wierd).

Of course, to add to the mix, you have people of one ethnic racial
category who might live (for generations) in a different geographic
region - I heard there were a lot of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia
during the recent violence there who were discriminated against by the 
Indonesians for being "outsider", somehow ignoring the fact that they
had been there for a few generations. Taiwan is a mix of ethnic Chinese
and ethnic Taiwanese (and probably some more). There are ethnic Chinese
living in Japan and Koran, speaking and living the native culture, but
who, to the locals, don\'t look Japanese (or Korean).

And finally, as someone else noted, you get the mutts. While you might
be able to tell "pure-blood" Irish from "pure-blood" Scottish, most
of the people of British descent you\'ll meet in Canada have probably
a dozen of each in their family tree. And English and in my case, Hungarian.
Distinctive group facial features get blurred or lost.

So, anyway, go easy on the rednecks who couldn\'t tell some from
Korea from someone from Pakistan. They just don\'t know any better. ;)

ObTrav: Most people in the 3I would identify people based on
minor human race characteristics. Tall people would get asked
of they were a member of such-and-such race, hairy people would
be some other, people with wide noses something else, etc.

Of course, this drives the Solomani nuts because they have more
visual diversity on their one planet than the rest of the 3I
combined probably. There\'s probably a minor human races that looks
like a sterotypical "black person" (I refuse to use African-American
and such because not everyone in Africa is black, geez), the existance
of whom drives every black person on Terra to their wit\'s end.

Terran Tourist: Did you immigrate here recently?
Michael Jordan\'s Great^n-Grandson: Huh?
Tourist: From Planet Q? Where your race is from?
Grandson: I\'m from Chicago! Get the hell off my planet!

Hm, well, that was then. Anyway, yes, there\'s like different rates of

Hm. Maybe the US should stop incarcerating so many people.

There are those of us (I\'ll probably be labelled a liberal by some)
who don\'t think that crime is not caused by gun ownership or the lack
thereof but by poverty and excessive social disparity. Correlation
is not causation, etc.

I should probably stop this whole thread for my part right about now
before it degrades into a bigger off-topic flame fest than it already 
is. I understand what you\'re saying Leonard, but I don\'t interpret the
stats the same way you seem do.

owned virtually everything (more than 97.5%).  10 would mean that 50% of
the people controlled 50% of the wealth, a very egalitarian society in
socio-ecomonic terms.  Present day earth is about a 4, IIRC. The letter
designations could be reserved for special things such as "no personal
ownership" or "continuous flux in wealth distribution (gift economy?)". 

The basic idea is that you line everybody up in order of wealth and put
down a marker at each increase of 10% in wealth, then determine where the
point of equilibrium is (ie. where percent of people equals 100 minus
percent of wealth).  If I\'m thiking straight (and it\'s early, so no
guarantee) this should give you a basic measure of the non-linearity of 
your wealth distribution curve...

That differs from my take on the fate of the _Thunder Child_.

If I remember Wells\' book correctly, _Thunder Child_ sank with all hands
while ramming (and destroying) a martian war machine that was moments
away from slaughtering boatloads of English civilians who were attempting
to flee across the channel. A moment of heroic defiance to the end,
lives nobly sacrificed for the (successful) protection of the innocent.

I saw it as more inspirational, than "dashing hopes".

A black hole, maybe. Do they still think the Cygnus X-ray source is one? 

A quasar? Not bloody likely! (thankfully) Last I saw quasars are energy
sources on the order of entire galaxies going supernova. At once.

They are also a LOT older than most stuff and are probably confined to
the early universe, since they\'re some of the most distant things we\'ve
ever seen. They probably predate our galaxy, much less the vanishingly
insignificant eyeblink of time that the Third Imperium represents....

Municipalities where concealed carry is on a shall-issue basis have lower
average crime rates, while neighboring states and municipalities with more
draconian restrictions have higher crime rates.  More guns = less crime.
Proven fact.

Now if only Clinton could get this through his sex-drenched brain...

  I\'m not sure about that - the one statistic that is striking is that
our murder rate is about a tenth of theirs, or an annual body count in
the US of about 90-100x ours (for a population about 8-9x larger - go
figure?). FWIW, break-ins and muggings are pretty much a barrel of laughs
compared to being shot and/or killed (I\'m guessing about that last, but
I hope that I\'ll be forgiven the liberty), so I\'ll take things as they
are. And I intend never to spend more than a weekend at a time in the US
(well, except maybe another cruise to Alaska - way cool stuff).

  As much fun as the gun nuts can be, there doesn\'t seem to be a direct
correlation between gun possession and murders - witness comparing Calgary
& Vancouver; Alberta has the highest possession rate of the provinces
(IIRC), while Vancouver is mostly empty of firearms (regardless of the
efforts of those heroic entrepreneurs in organized crime). And yet the
murder rates are comparable at best (Vancouver is the third-largest city
in the country, but Calgary is close enough for comparison) - at worst
Vancouver is rather worse (pick your years carefully, and have fun adding
suspected murders allocated from missing persons tallies).

  I wonder how Vancouver & Seattle stack up historically, though - they
should be tolerably similar.

I was subscibed to both the TML and x-boat, and it was close to 80% cross

There\'s nothing stopping anyone from going out to Onelist and starting

   It should also be pointed out that the initial battle of the American
Revolutionary War (Lexington) occurred because the British Army decided to
seize private citizens\' weapons that were being held in community arsenals
outside of Boston.

   Harold\'s Thoughts On Gun Control (send replies to hdhale@mindspring.com)

   1) While there are similarities between the U.S., Canada, Finland, New
Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and France, the U.S. is
culturally different enough from Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, and France that gun control debates that resort to
comparing this and that country\'s statistics (especially those that imply
that the U.S. should give up private ownership of guns like a child gives
up its "blankee" or favorite stuffed animal) are nothing more than a
philosophical exercise with little practical value.  If you are lucky
enough to live in the country with a relatively homogenous population that
has a tradition of resolving serious differences over several alcoholic
beverages and a couple of fists or one really serious opium binge, good for
you.  The rest of us will find our own path.

   2) It can be accurately pointed out that governments and peoples have
from time to time in the course of history deemed it appropriate to
concentrate the ability to use force in the form of projectile weapons in
the hands of the state.  When this has happened, the resulting changes in
society have been mixed at best.  Hitler made sure that guns were rounded
up when he took power in the 1930s.  On the other hand the UK rounded up
most all firearms in the 1920s when fear spread of a Communist insurgency.
The former resulted in one of the most repressive regimes in history.  The
latter has been a stable democracy ever since (even if you may disagree
with the policies of the current Labour Government).

   3) A firearm is a weapon capable of killing people with greater
efficiency than with knives, swords, arrows, cars, clubs, ropes, bare
hands, etc.  That\'s *all* a firearm really is--a more efficient machine.
Not as efficient as poison gas, nuclear power, or a 747 perhaps, but on the
scale of things, effective for what it is design to do.  It is incapable of
killing in and of itself unless it is seriously mechanically defective, and
then it does so, it does it completely without malice or forethought, just
like a car with bad brakes on a long hill.  In fact there is nothing
inherently evil in any human-built machine, regardless of its purpose or
how "cold" or "military" it looks.  A firearm is a piece of reasonably well
manufactured metal, plastic, and/or wood or ivory and nothing more than
that until *someone* puts it to use.  Then, it can make save a life or even
countless lives by killing or wounding someone(s) intent on doing harm.  It
can also be used to kill babies, elderly women, pregnant mothers, and
Presidents.  *Why* it is used is what is important, not whether or not it
can hold 10 rounds or 20, whether or not it has a flash supresser, or if it
has a detachable magazine.

   4) Banning firearms will not prevent murder or even mass murder.  The
Oklahoma City bombing was carried out and killed hundreds of people without
a single shot being fired.  The IRA killed and wounded far more people with
bombs in their campaign to drive the British out of Northern Ireland than
they ever did with guns.  The gas attacks on the Tokyo subway system a few
years ago were also conducted without firearms.  Tribesmen in Africa have
conducted killing sprees with machetes that killed and wounded dozens even
hundreds at a time.  The History texts are filled with people who had no
trouble butchering, mutilating, raping, and oppressing their fellow men and
women without so much as a whiff of gunpowder in the air.  Is it possible
that some of those people could have killed many more if they had a
firearm?  Perhaps--then again, maybe some of those who chose to use
firearms to do their deeds would have instead resorted to even more
efficient means of killing such as explosives (mixed in a bath tub out of
common chemicals) or worse if a firearm hadn\'t been there.

   5) The Constitution of the U.S. is quite clear--private citizens are
allowed to own firearms and the central government cannot prevent them from
doing so as long as they abide by the laws of the land.  The U.S.
Constitution also states, quite unambiguously, that the Congress should
provide funding to provide private citizens in the proper military
training, and shall appoint officers as necessary so that the private
citizens have a chain of command to report to while they are training or
when and if they ever get called on to protect the country.  So far as I
know, the Congress hasn\'t appointed a single officer for such a purpose
since the 1800s, and they stopped providing funding for firearms training
(let alone training in proper military drill) years ago.  Technically
speaking, this means that Congress has not lived up to its Constitutional
obligations, and corrective actions should be taken immediately by the
President of the U.S. and/or the people.  But wait, not even President
Ronald Reagan, known 2nd Amendment advocate, believed that Congress should
provide funding for training private citizens for military duty outside the
confines of the U.S. military, and I never heard one peep from him during
the 1980s about appointing officers for that chain of command the
aforementioned private citizens are suppose to have.  If the primary reason
stated for private gun ownership is suppose to be about having a "well
regulated militia" (as the U.S. Constitution states), and the militia is
suppose to consist of eligible members of the aforementioned private
citizenry (excluding the National Guard, which, sorry folks, is a part of
the U.S. Army/Air Force) then the militia has been allowed to fall into
disrepair and needs to be immediately funded, or the Second Amendment
repealed.

   6) On the other hand, the Supreme Court of the U.S. has seen fit to give
the citizens of the U.S. the right to an abortion (Roe vs. Wade) through
intepreting the U.S. Constitution to say that a woman\'s choice to terminate
a pregnancy is protected, even though it is not explicitly stated as such;
that burning an American flag in protect is a form of free speech, though
it is not explicitedly stated; that religious displays can be banned in
certain public areas even though the First Amendment does not explicitly
state this; that separate but equal facilities for minorities are
unconstitutional, even though it is not explicitedly stated.  The point is,
many things have been judged by the Supreme Court as constitutional or
unconstitutional based on far less supporting evidence in the U.S.
Constitution than exists currently for private gun ownership.  One would
think that those who support abortion rights, flag burning, exclusion of
religious symbols, and integration would also support private gun
ownership, but as I have noted on more than one occasion, many Americans
have a rather sad tendency to be total and complete flaming hypocrites when
it comes to their personal behavior and to their supposed beliefs on what
constitutes "inalienable rights".

   One more point: given the large volume of gun laws currently on the
books regarding private firearms ownership in the U.S., it could be argued
that the "militia" (eligible private citizens) are already "well
regulated", and that the provisions for funding the appointment of officers
and training the militia were intended for the purposes of preparing for
repelling a foreign invasion only--the threat of which the U.S. has been
free of since 1815.  Also, if the U.S. Supreme Court has been reluctant in
the past to hear 2nd Amendment cases, it has been because they wished to
give local authorities the maximum flexibility possible in how they wished
to deal with gun laws, not because they were necessarily pro or anti-gun.
Any significant ruling by the Supreme Court would have altered that ability.

   7) People who live in mansions and "gated communities" surrounded by
high walls, steel gates, costly high tech security systems, 24 hours
guards, and access to police who will respond in under 7 minutes to a phone
call (Rosie O\'Donnell, Jane Fonda, Sharon Stone, insert the name of your
favorite rich elitist celebrity here) have no business lecturing *anyone*,
particularly people living in cities where illegal drugs and illegal
weapons follow in and out of neighborhoods like sewage through a sewage
line, about whatever less expensive security measures they may take,
including the ownership of a legally obtained firearm.  Further, they have
no business lecturing people on why further weapons bans should be put in
place, since whatever additional bans in the U.S. they propose will
disproportionately disarm honest citizens, while leaving criminals with the
same steady flow of illegal firearms they had before.

   I think I\'ve covered all the bases now regarding people\'s comments on
gun control during the latest "outbreak".  I will post nothing further here
on this topic unless in the above lecture I have made some sort of factual
error that needs correcting.  Those who wish to discuss this further, the
address is listed above.

Rules:  MT-lite  ...  usually  no  task  time  rules  or   combat
inturrupts, only "advanced" character generation, plus "Spice  Of
Life" add-on rules from Challenge magazine and cultural mods from
World Builder\'s Handbook.

Canon: CT universe in Spinward Marches around 5FW ... as canon as
possible for the most part but the Ancients are Cthulhu-esq.

Rules: MT-variant & light... plus anything I like from any game 
system. 

Canon: It might be canon... I set it beyond charted space, but the 
universe the players left behind is supposed to be the MT one... only 
they still don\'t know how much time they were hibernated, so it might 
be the TNE one... or a different one. Maybe one day they\'ll find out.

Just to let you know: Our couriers inform us that the shipment of 
\'The Khiidkar Incident\' and \'SpaceDogs\' was delivered to Steve 
Jackson Games on Monday 13th December 1999. Included in the shipment 
were a limited number of copies of the 2nd Edition of Timothy 
Collinson\'s "The Traveller Bibliography".

So keep an eye on SJG\'s elves at Warehouse 23 and hopefully you\'ll be 
able to have two new adventures and a copy of the best guide to 
Traveller ever produced for the festive season!

BITS would like to wish you a Happy Christmas and a Great 2000!

Back when I did nothing but read UFO books (Chariots of the Gods?) they
discussed a number of biblical passages. I think the behavior of the ark
was blamed on radioactivity.

The reason for that line is because, as in the book, the Thunder Child first
successfully destroys a Martian war machine by gun fire. This raises
everybody\'s hopes that the British Navy can once again save the day, and
deal once and for all with the Martian threat.  Or at least allow another
boatload to leave England.

But then more war machines arrive and the Thunder Child is forced into
sacrificing itself to save the packed steamer. While I agree that it was a
moment of heroic defiance, and it\'s why I used the incident IMTU, it also
"dashed the hopes" of those left on shore of getting out of England and
surviving , and showed that even the great British Navy could only go down
fighting in th face of the Martian war machines.

It _is_ inspirational,  but it also emphasizes the power of the invaders,
and puts the nail in the coffin of military resistance to the invaders,
leaving England "under the heel" of the Martians.

That song would be OK taken out of context.

Unfortunately, in context, the character singing it doesn\'t really believe
it anymore, and it\'s more a desperate cry for someone to provide evidence or
justification for the words he\'s singing, than a belivable affirmation of
the concept.

( Jeez,  I just reread that sentence, and while it says what I want it to
say, I\'m using far too many big words these days )

The Hivers were here before the Droyne and
Grandfather. The war that ensued could have
been about the Droyne trying to overthrow
their masters. Think "Caesar" from "Conquest
of the Planet of the Apes." I contemplate this
because:
1. Droyne do everything in 6\'s
2. Hivers have 6 limbs.
Of course these points could prove the other
theory as well. This I put forward only as a
possibility.

Personnally, I like the bit about the Hivers
fighting Grandfather over the humans. Maybe
they were fearfull of the humans expanding
into the rest of the galaxy. Maybe the Hivers
came to the same conclusion thousands of
years later and came up with Virus to deal
with the humans. Or they could have found
some of their own ancient writings that warned
them about the humans (ala the Shadows of B5).
Hmm... Virus could have been an attempt to
destroy the bulk of humaniti so that we would not
be able to serve the \'Empress\'(wave). I don\'t have

this.

   Please do.  This is an issue where you see a lot of emotionalism, but
little in the way of constructive dialog.  Given that so many people have
such strong opinions on the issue however, no one should be surprised.

   Where I stand on the issue should be clear from the text, but I would
add that it should ultimately be up to the *people*, not politicians, not
cultural elitists or social activists, not some judge with a political ax
to grind, or money hungry prosecutor looking for a big settlement check,
whether or not any particular firearm or broad classes of firearms with
certain features are or are not available on the legal gun market (if the
people of a given country decide one should exist).  Note I say \'legal gun
market\'.  Because illegal gun markets operate in every country in the world
save Vatican City, and I can probably walk down the street to Italy from
there and find what I want in short order if I have the right connections.

  OK, I\'ve said too much already.

Sheesh!  We at SayBOOM took a while to figure out you meant "massage" as a

This one has come up for me every Christmas for the last few years. Be wary,
however, no folklorist has been able to antedate the story before 1993, and
the location, year and size of the display varies in each telling.

I have to agree.  This sounds like BS.

However, when I lived in Tokyo, I do remember the local supermarket using
giant cardboard Santas to advertise the arrival of fresh strawberries, in
May.  Presumably it was the bright red color?  Nah, I\'m not going to make
excuses for advertisers.

Sigh. It\'s a ridiculous argument.  All it proves is that gun laws don\'t
work with an open border system, in which case, yes-sir-ree, it\'s better to
mug someone you  know is less likely to be carrying.

I can drive from Vermont to New York without being stopped by customs
officials.  I can have a friend with a Vermont address buy a gun in
Vermont, have him hand it to me outside the store (after any waiting period)
and then drive to New York. If I keep a few km over the speed limit, I\'m
not going to be stopped.  That\'s gun control?

obTrav, it\'s like saying that you have two planets next to each other. One
is Law Level 0 and the other Law Level 10.  But there\'s no border control
and no customs patrol.  Guess what happens?  Right. Anyone willing to break
the law can.

You want gun control, enforce a country-wide set of restrictions, eliminate
all "grandfather clauses" allowing resale of existing weapons et al (use
buy-backs if necessary), enforce drug law level penalties for
non-complience (mandatory sentencing, like there is for crack cocaine) and
offer $5,000 buy-back on any firearm not covered by the licensing. Cost you
a few billion dollars, but if you\'ve the stones for it...

Otherwise, all you can say is "the half-hearted, castrated gun laws that
the United States can pass are ineffective in reducing crime."  Thought
experiment: try it with drugs as well. Ban \'em in one state, allow
relatively free sales in another, and see what happens. Answer: more crime.
 Why?  Smuggling, ease of access, etc.

What the US needs is _one_ system. Either the same lack of gun laws
everywhere, or the same gun control everywhere. Only then can you have a
fair trial of whether "more guns = less crime" is a proven fact or not.

Fair enough. Gun ownership in the US, though, is not a legacy of the
American Revolution.
It\'s primarily a legacy of the American Civil War, which taught millions
how to shoot and left
them with (previously not affordable) weapons following demobilization.

3) "a gun is just a tool"

Do gun supporters believe that gun control arguments should all the way
along? If you argue that guns should not be outlawed because, after all,
people can massacre their opponents with blades, and, gee, they might get
worse stuff as well, does this apply further to other weaponry?

I trust pro-gun supporters also believe that the world will be a safer
place if every state had ICBMs with nuclear warheads.  After all, why
oppose the things?  Only about 100,000 people have been killed by nukes,
and anyway, they can always get biological weapons if we ban nukes.  Heck,
imagine if Haiti had nukes. No need to worry about committing US troops
there, right? Remove the stigma from nuclear weapons! End armed
intervention in foreign countries!  No more war!  It\'s actually not that
dumb a position; the only worry is the same felt about automatic weapons.
One crazy with a nuke can do a lot more damage before he\'s put down than
one crazy with conventional weapons.  Just like one crazy with an assault
rifle can killl 10-15 people in two seconds (ifiring into a tighltly packed
crowd), whereas a guy with a knife would be lucky to manage one.  It really
depends what you\'re worried about, of course. The same argument is a pro
gun argument: one individual with a gun and good tactics can take out a
number of oppressive/crazed individuals without, wheras he\'d be overun if
he had a knife and they did as well.  Depends on who you see as your
enemies, i suppose...

The logic goes, I believe, that it wasn\'t just the smaller gene pool,
but the overall small number of inhabitants living in a small geographical
area for the other human races that caused their relative homogenity.

While there were probably a number of languages on early Vland, by the
time they achieved space flight I imagine that they really and truly had
whittled it down to one language. Even then, they were starting with a
smaller set of languages to start with.

I imagine the situation would be like dialects of Chinese more than
wholly different languages - they\'re different, but not as different
as they could be.

That\'s for the Vilani and Zhodani at least - they\'re described that way
in "source". Minor human races may be different.

Well, this Canadian has no problem with that. But I don\'t know how all

    'body' => 'Moving Gun Control Flamebait away from Trav (like it was on topic), I
thought I\'d mention the reason I was interested -- I\'ve just finished
co-authoring HOT RODS AND GUN BUNNIES for Guardians of Order.  It\'s our Big
Eyes, Small Mouth anime-style guns-and-cars book.  There\'s lots of simple
rules for guns, but also a lengthy appendix detailing U.S., Canadian and
Japanese gun laws, and so on.  After having spent a few weeks reading
the mish-mash of laws in the United States and the sheer illogic of many of
them (the way AP handgun rounds have been extended to rifle ammo by BATF,
etc.) I must say I am sympathetic with some of the complaints of gun
owners... Of course, the Japanese gun laws are rather interesting in
themselves. "In ALL OF JAPAN only 50 pistol holders licenses will be issued
at any one time. To get one, shoot expert in an air pistol tournment. Then
we\'ll do a background check on you _and_ your family. Carry the pistol only
in a locked box.  And when your pistol isn\'t in use for target practice,
keep it as the police station." That\'s gun control ):  Of course, a few
thousand illegal handguns still leak into Japan each year...

Re-reading some parts of Invasion Earth, I wonder if the SDB wings on some
worlds might carry traditions from those world\'s submarine services (which
are quite lengthy for those derived from RN/USN, etc.) and be controlled by
the wet navies (Nautical Force Command, whatever) rather than COACC or
space naval tradition.  The tactics do seem more submarine like (lie in
wait, silent running at times, tight bunk conditions) and, of course, some
SDBs may operate as subs for extended periods.  Do you get Dolphins serving
as SDB crew (and some ships configured that way) in those areas of space
that have them?

Double sigh.  It is not ridiculous - not at all.

Read John Lott\'s More Guns, Less Crime.  Part of the study is available
online at

http://papers.ssrn.com/paper.taf?abstract_id=161637

Results:  Guns in the hands of law abiding citizens reduce crime.

It\'s also a felony, unless you and your friend are residents of Vermont.

And trash every right that the country was founded on?  Short of doing that,
it won\'t work.  Remember Prohibition?  How about the current \'war on drugs?\'

What is a \'buy-back\'?  How can the gov\'t \'buy-back\' something it never
owned?  If  you don\'t choose to \'sell\' it to the government, you are put in
jail.  This is also known as confiscation.

Besides, it was something about confiscating illegal weaponry that set off
the American Revolution back in 1776.

Gosh - most of these illicit drugs are banned in most countries.  Doesn\'t

The US does *not* need one system, for anything below the federal level.  We
are, supposedly,  a union of states - not one overbearing federal state.

Ah, the \'Nuke\' strawman.  I was wondering when it would show up.
1. No one is arguing for personal nuke ownership.  When someone argues for
it, then we can talk about it.

However - it does seem that MAD did more or less keep the peace for 50
years.  It wasn\'t nice - but do you think that it would have been different
if only one superpower had had \'em?

That\'s true.  I usually worry about people telling me how to live my life
especially when I am not hurting anyone.

Around Sacramento (the meth capitol of the world), LSD is usually cut with

There\'s another unfinished ringworld in the Hinterworlds. However the 
locals don\'t like visitors, so I doubt it\'d be high on the tourist 
attractions of known space.

Relevance to the Ark uncertain in context, but...

"Thou shalt not steal" should have been translated as "Thou shalt
not kidnap", and "Thou shalt not covet..." should have been "Thou
shalt not steal..."

Also, elsewhere in the TNK, "Suffer not a witch to live" should
have read "poisoner" for "witch".

I wouldn\'t object.  These days, I do most of my work south of the border or
for companies that sell most of their material to the US,  while most of my
Canadian friends haveleft the country to get work elsewhere or Americans I
communicate with on line. Customs barriers, et al are more of an annoyance

Either about the so-called drawbacks of that, or Sacramento\'s ridiculous,

Yes, I said that in the very next paragraph. People break laws that are
difficult to enforce. Like copying CDs, for example.

That\'s what I said, actually.  It should be a bit easier to ban guns,
though. Even in Japan, which has among the strictess gun control, a
blackmarket pistol (1 kg or so) is worth only about $1,000 US.  A kg of
cocaine is worth a heck of a lot more and much easier to hide!  Also, while
most of the alcohol using or drug using population must buy more
drinks/hits/smokes every week or so, the vast majority of the gun using
population does not buy a new gun or a new case of ammo every week. (Some
might, but...)

Yep. Exactly.  This is supported by the US constitution, which recognizes
the right of the citizens to change a government they feel is inadequate,
by force if necessary.  That does not just mean a government that tries to
take away guns. It can mean a government that does not take away guns...
One way is to rise up in revolt. Another way is to convince the law makers
to change the constitution, through a constitutional amendment.  Sure, it
won\'t happen... unless enough people want it to.

>Besides, it was something about confiscating illegal weaponry that set off
>the American Revolution back in 1776.

One of the triggers, sure. But historical data (wills, etc.) shows that US
citizens did not care much about guns after the revolution -- circa 1800,
militias were in a sorry state, most citizens did not own a working gun,
etc.  They cared about the confiscation of weaponry because they were
preparing for armed insurrection.

True. White powder is easier to smuggle than guns.  It\'s also addictive.

Well, watch what will happen if one of your states makes drugs legal, and
another one doesn\'t...

You must be confusing me with someone else. I did not say "if we allow
semi-auto rifles with big magazines, where will it end? Will you want nukes
in your basement next?"  I said "by analogy, an argument for gun ownership
keeping the peace between individuals is similar to an argument for
profileration of nuclear weapons
keeping the peace between states. If you should favor one, you should
philosophically favor the other."

Depends on the superpower. If only the USSR did, yes.  Otherwise, it\'s  a
case by case basis.  Nukes don\'t necessarily deter conventional agression,
but we have yet to see a situation where a nuclear power was pushed to the
wall in a multi-polar situation and had the choice between firing or
national destruction.  If Kuwait had them, would they have pushed the
button?  What would that have meant for the middle east?  Etc.

a) You\'re not the first, and probably won\'t be the last. GZG\'s Full Thrust
has a merged US, Canada and UK, IIRC.
b) If any two nations of diverse peoples are similar, it is the US and
Canada; both have localized concentrations of ethnic populations, and a
wide variety therof. Both have Socialized and Regulated Semi-capitalist
non-command economies. Both are severed colonies of HRM George III, albiet
not severed form colonial oppression at the same time. Both are republics,
and merging Canada into the US would simply result in (IIRC) 13 new states,
and fewer reps in congress for new york, texas, california, etc... smaller
states would really not suffer in congress. Realistically, they already
have semi-integrated militaries (I see Canook Flyboys ALL THE BLOODY
TIME...), with yanks serving at canadian bases and canooks serving at us
bases.
c) the common language is closer than with any other pair of purportedly
english speaking nations, with the exception of the quebeçois "french"; the
US has at least 5 major dialects, and canada at least 3, of english;
Detroiters sound more like canadians than yanks....

The problems would be the loss of socialized medicine in Canada,
differences in legal basises and biases, and the sheer distances involved.

An NAU has always sounded good to me.

Ob Trav: Even with the 3I and the Solomani Confed, the differences are much
larger than the US and Canada. the 3I is a blend of Sylean, Vilani, and
Solomani traditions, with over 1000 years of multi-lineal divergence under
a common union; the SC severs to an autonomous (and internally more
homogenous) regionin IIRC 600 IC.The war ca. 950-1000 IC simply completes
the divergence. So, in the 5Fw-rebellion era, that\'s 500 years of
divergence and separate identity. Not the mere 200 of US  vs Canada, and
even there the divergence period is OVER culturally for entertainments; the
3I and SC do not have the cultural sharing which the US and Canada have....

I\'d kind of like to play a map-and-counters game of
U.S.A. versus Canada.  I\'m sure we\'d quickly take out
their air force and capture the major cities, but
rooting the rebels out of the mountains and forests
could take a really long time.  

At least we\'ll have taken over their tv and movie
industry and been freed from the pornographic
socialist propaganda they constantly beam down here.  

In answer to your questions, the Canadians will
probably feel like any conquered and occupied country,
and the United States will feel like its usual
ambivalent self.

IMTU I also allowed a weapons dispensation in certain circumstances based on
being a member of the imperial nobility.   It was very limited and applied
to a limited number of types of "hand weapons".    Given sufficient social
standing it might be extended to one or two similarly armed "body servants".
The noble was held strictly responsible for the actions of his/her vassals.
I generally ran it as a direct modifier of the world\'s law level with regard
to weapons allowed to be personally carried by the noble and with an even
smaller modifier by his/her "body servants".  The noble and his/her "body
servants" had to have sufficient skill levels with the weapons carried.  The
servants had to be "bonded".

    Are these paid on the same world as the bank which funded the loan is?
If your Free Trader is away speculating from the ships/banks homeworld and

A) been there... Alaska decriminalized Marijuanna in the 70\'s. Net effect?
lots of people smoked lots of local dope.

B) Drugs are federally regulated, and so anyone who smoked dope could still
be popped by the FBI or BATF or DEA, but not local cops nor Alaska State
Troopers.

Net result? A lot of kids who got hold of dope either from their folks, or
after 18, found out that they had major problems if they tried to deal with
the feds as prospective employees. Lots of dope-heads on public assistance.
Cheap Marijuanna ($20 an Oz!)

Note: Alaska\'s decriminalization measure legalized up to 4 oz in the home,
and 1 oz on the person, and no more than 1 plant, no more than 1 bag per
oz. It was not leagal to buy, sell, or publically smoke, nor to operate a
vehicle while under the influence of, marijuanna. If you got caught with
more by a local cop, the usual procedure was to be polite and cooperative,
and you usually walked away with half your stash, or the legal limit, which
ever was less. But, if the feds found it, you went to jail. A few cases
were prosecuted because Social Security persons doing an inspection found
marijuanna, called in the DEA, and federal charges resulted. The 15+ years
of "Non-criminal" marijuanna ended the same way they began: with a public
referendum. And, now, it runs $20 an eighth.

nb: oz refers to Ounce, rather than to the city of Oz or to Australia.

On the other hand, because the "effective dose" of LSD is *so* small,
most of the folks producing it "got away with" simply *appalling* lab
technique. Most acid contained impurities that would have been *fatal*
if the required dose was anywhere *near* that of most other drugs. 

So it\'s quite possible that the "brown acid" had so *really* nasty
contaminants, or had *gotten* contaminated by something nasty.

Since they are all descended from a more limited gene pool, the odds
*do* favor loss of any number of genes purely thru genetic drift.

As I noted, a *complete* inventory will almost certainly take place
when the facility gets turned over to another entity. Not necessarily
*every* time responsibility changes hands, as even some bureaucrats are
too trusting for their own good. But sooner or later...

One possibility is when the UN becomes the *real* world government. Or
rather, at whatever point after that they start consolidating intel
agencies.

Unless sometime in the 21st century, the Parti Quebecois actually succeeds
in their separation referendum. The Maritimes, cut off from the rest of
Canada and with a terrible economic situation, petition to join the USA, as
do the western provinces....

And the rest could be history.

I for one sure hope the PQ NEVER succeeds. They\'d be cutting their nose off
despite their face.

        To be frank, I\'ve never worried about it.  <gasp>  Yeah, I know.
Since I drive the internal workings of the TNEC millieu on the gold/
platinum exchange system, really what the ship owner is doing is "buying" an
electronic purchase marker for the equivalent value of bullion, with
instructions to transfer same to the bank extending the loan.

>If your Free Trader is away speculating from the ships/banks homeworld and
>there isn\'t enough money in the bank are you automatically assumed to have
>skipped? 

        Like most modern banks, a simple communique of intentions will keep
the hounds in the kennel.  For instance, my own personal bank will defer one
*month* of payments on all my loans with them once a year, with no penalty
to me (except the accumulation of interest).  Why?  Simple...  its better
for them than having to sell the loan at $0.50/ $1.00 to a collections
company.  All I need to do is call and give them a reasonable reason.
        This is the interesting bit...  IMTU, collections firms exist.  You
skip a couple of payments, and in an area the size of the TNEC millieu, it
doesn\'t take long for that information to get out.  A Collections/
Privateering firm buys the loan from the bank and comes looking for you...
information propogation via couriered data-net means that eventually,
someone will want to collect the KCr100 reward on "information leading to
the aprehension"...  say, the tech who was plugging the fuel lines into your
ship at the starport...
        So, the C&P firm pays MCr18 for the rights to the loan on the
Type-A, MCr1 in rewards to various sources who let them know where to find
the runaways, MCr5 in crew and ship costs for its own personell to find the
skip and pockets the balance of MCr12.5.
        Twelve and a half million in cash is a pretty strong motivator to
find a skipping ship.  It also means that the skipping crew *knows* that
everywhere they go, *someone* will talk, making for an arrow pointing at
them.  They eventually *will* get caught...  unless they flee Known Space
for whatever is beyond the Fringe...

>Can the original loan be used to finance another ship if you want
>to trade up? I\'m glad I always play scouts.

        Again, I use a RealWorld(tm) equity model....  how many payments
have you made, divided by three is the amount of equity in the loan that can
be use to setup the downpayment on the next ship and then you can sell your
existing vessel to pay off the current loan.  As well, tech upgrades,
mid-life refits, and that sort of thing can be paid for by cashing out
whatever equity is in the loan.
        The 100-year-old tramp with a perpetual loan and the finest weapons
and electonics suite in the Terran Sphere isn\'t far-fetched this way...

And if anyone needs further evidence of the sorry state of the US

They also would\'ve been helped by the fact that LSD\'s LD50 is 
enormously higher than its ED50, so dangerous derivatives (not that I 
can think of any off-hand) would also be created in very minute 
quantities.

ITYM "Organization of North American Nations", or ONAN. See David

I\'m surprised nobody\'s mentioned strychnine yet.

Anyway, there are a few different reasons to cut drugs. It\'s most common
with heroin and cocaine because the purity and quality of those drugs vary
immensely. Some will cut cocaine and heroin to keep the dosages low, and
this can actually be beneficial[1]. In addition, since these drugs are sold
in volume, cutting a drug with another substance can make a supply last
longer. Cocaine is usually much more expensive than methampthetamines, for
example, so cocaine is frequently cut with speed.

On the other hand, some drugs are laced with other drugs on purpose.
Marijuana is frequently laced with PCP, and sometimes crack cocaine. Heroin
and speed are sometimes mixed together as well.

None of these reasons apply to LSD, however. The average dosage of LSD today
is about 90 - 120 *micrograms*. A crystal of concentrated LSD the size of
the tip of a thumb is enough to manufacture many,  many doses. It goes
without saying that acid is not a "volume" drug, and as such there\'s no real
reason to cut acid with anything for economic gain, nor to keep the dosage
low. LSD takes a while to take effect, if you want to rip somebody off, it\'s
cheaper and easier to just sell "blank" pieces of blotter paper. Doses of
LSD are usually eye-dropped onto blotter paper. You would feel nothing if
the same amount of speed, or just about any other drug, was dropped onto the
same blotter paper. Other methods of taking LSD are also physically small.
"Microdots" are just a little bit bigger than the enamel head on an
old-fashioned pin and "geltabs" are a little smaller than a pencil eraser,
and both forms are made up of substances which are far cheaper than anything
anybody would want to cut LSD with.

In the mid-60s, it was common for LSD to be sold in the form of larger
tablets, so it *was* possible, and common, for LSD to be cut and laced with
other drugs for different reasons.

This might be part of the reason why people go on to say that LSD is cut
with other substances. I don\'t think so. Being interested in folklore, which
is why I have the amount of knowledge on the subject that I do, I believe
that there\'s a much simpler explanation:

The onset of an LSD trip, especially when the hit ingested was "dirty"
(either degraded by heat or poorly manufactured) is marked by a tightening
of the muscles (especially in the jaws, back and neck) as well as mild
stomach discomfort. In addition, LSD heightens sensory impressions, so most
people feel a pronounced, but not overly unpleasant soreness or at the base
of their back. The length of time
that it takes for a hit to take effect is between about a half hour and an
hour or so, so people who have taken acid are usually very anxious for any
number of reasons.

The effects of speed are somewhat similar, but considerably more pronounced,
so many people somewhat naturally assume that LSD is cut with speed.
Strychnine is thought to cause similar symptoms, so that substance is
commonly thought to be a culprit as well.

Anyone who has even a little knowledge of the drug and the dosages involved
(and such people are vanishingly rare among acid users) will quickly realize
that cutting LSD with anything makes no sense, and even if it was cut, the
dosage of the other drug would not be nearly that pronounced. In response,
in the acid renaissance of the late 80s and early 90s, there arose the
notion that acid must be cut with a small amount of speed or strychnine to
make it "stick" to the blotter paper. That\'s bunk, though, since blotter
paper will absorb LSD when it is mixed with none other than common, everyday
water.

Ach, my apologies for the long post.

ObTrav: I remember when I first got on the list there was fast drug, slow
drug and "drug drug". Whatever happened to "drug drug"? How about psi-drugs,
do they merely boost psionic abilities, or are there other side effects? In
my Traveller Universe (in this respect strongly
influenced by the comic book version of Akira), some psi-drugs are also
powerful hallucinogens, and some others have various other effects. I\'ve
always been fond of putting drugs of different sorts into my Traveller
campaigns, but maybe it\'s the cyberpunk in me.

[1] Here in Philly a few years back there were a rash of deaths as a very
powerful and uncut heroin made it onto the market. Quite a few people died
over the course of a week or so. Even old, long term junkies died, which is
usually pretty rare since their tolerance is usually extremely high.

Unlikely. It\'d have to be *really* old. Otherwise it\'d be notable for
the sector it was in being mostly "dead" or damaged worlds due to the
supernova that created the black hole. As I recall, being within a
dozen parsecs of a supernova would be *really* bad news for your planet.

There\'d also be this rather noticeable nebula (the expanding gases from
the supernova) filling most of the sector.

Quasars are found in the *early* universe and are basicly galaxies with
cores so active that nothing could live in the galaxy.

Ah. Well, then my comments about black holes apply. It\'d have to be

I could have sworn that they distorted spacetime so badly that having
one "pass through" an object would tend to be *really bad* for the
object.

Naturally. After all, they are nothing but a "line defect" in
spacetime. *Zero* thickness. Just enough "missing" spacetime that a
circle with a string running thru it has a circumference noticeably
*less* than 2*pi*r.

The Oxford Text Archive. I don\'t have the URL handy, but any decent

I grabbed the ASCII version, but they supposedly also have SGML, HTML

As tech levels go up "garbage" increasinly becomes a *resource*. It\'s
frequently richer in raw materials than the remaining ores. 

And on planets with "unusable" atmospheres (too little, toxic, etc) and
thus a need for "closed cycle" ecologies, it may be a criminal offense
to *not* recycle organics, or to "contaminate" recyclable organics.

Yep, but the dosages are so tiny that this is rather unlikely. Even so, I\'m
reasonably sure that the brown acid was thought to be causing bad trips. The
famous Woodstock announcement sort of supports me on this, as I can\'t recall
any ill physical effects being mentioned, and the announcement closed with
something along the lines of, "...it\'s your trip, so be careful."

I would think that if people were becoming physically ill they would have
mentioned this fact.

I\'m inclined to lean in this direction, myself.

1. an "assualt rifle" is a *fully automatic* weapon. As such it is
   covered by the laws regarding "machine guns". And only *one* such
   weapon is on record as having been both legally possessed *and* used
   in a crime.
2. The so-called "assualt weapon" (an invention of the media) is a
   *semi-automatic* weapon (one trigger pull, one shot fired). And it
   is *functionally* no different than the majority of hunting rifles.
   The term is applied to weapons that "look military" but are
   otherwise unremarkable. They most certainly are no more dangerous
   than "normal" rifles. Unless you know of someone adding a bayonet
   and *stabbing* people with it?
3. You *cannot* shoot "10-15 people in two seconds" with a semi-auto
   rifle. The mechanism won\'t *operate* that fast. Hell, you can\'t do
   that with most *full* auto weapons. You are describing a "cyclic
   rate" of 300-450 rounds per minute. 
   Next, we come to the *fact* that you can\'t *aim* that fast. If you
   just "spray and pray" you aren\'t likely to *hit* with even half of
   your shots, crowd or no. And you *certainly* won\'t be *killing*
   everyone you hit. That takes either extreme luck or a *properly
   placed* shot. And you aren\'t going to be able to "properly place"
   shots at the rate you claim.
   Please note that the spress with high *death* rates are the ones
   where the perpetrator(s) wandered around *taking their time* aiming
   and shooting. Not the cases where bullets were fired wildly. 
4. *10* shots is standard magazine capacity. 5, if you are using the
    magazines required by many states hunting laws. Yes, if you haver
    an extended magazine, you can have 30 rounds. Which if your rate of
    fire was correct would result in emptying the magazine in *four
    seconds*. As I noted, it reality it\'d take longer. Please note that
    in several of these "shooting sprees" people have tackled the
    gunman when he changed magazines (actually, in the "local" one,
    they tackled him while he still had ammo). *Unlike* a knife, you
    are *safe* once you get close to a man with a rifle. You have to be
    out *beyond* the end of the barrel for him to shoot you. With a
    knife you have to be able to immobilize his hand.

In short, you overestimate both the deadliness and the rate of fire of
weapons. And you grossly *underestimate both the *ease* of tackling
someone with a gun (the folks that have tried mostly didn\'t even get
wounded!) and the *difficulty* of doing so to a man with a knife (or a
machete). I mention the machete because such have been used in recent
years in a couple of killing sprees.

Most such "incidents" were purely local. Things like the local KKK boys
getting drunk and deciding to "scare the niggers" by burning a cross on
someone\'s lawn, or at the local black church (or even burning the
church). Some sympathetic white would anonymously call the target(s)
and warn them. So the white hood brigade shows up and run into some
blacks, armed with shotguns (hard to take away when they use them to
hunt for food!). 

In one case I heard of, the blacks waited until the KKK goons got out
of the cars and then (from cover) blew the hell out of the *cars*.
After all, they didn\'t want to get in trouble for shooting a white man.

The cars that were still drivable got packed full of KKK members in
full (panicked) retreat. And the ones that weren\'t drivable got towed
away later as abandoned. And by mutual, unspoken agreement, the blacks
didn\'t ask any questions about who owned the cars, and the law didn\'t
ask any questions about how they came to be shot up. 

You have to keep in mind that while *most* Southerners thought that
blacks were "inferior" they *didn\'t* approve of KKK tactics such as
shootings, burnings, hangings and mutilations. So when the KKK got
whupped in one of these confrontations, most of the locals would think
"serves \'em right" as long as the blacks didn\'t get "uppity" because of
it.

That last came about because politicians just can\'t seem to grasp the
concept that Kevlar vests are *not* "bullet-proof". They are *only*
intended to protect against *typical* PISTOL rounds, which tend to be
low-power, low-velocity. They were *never* intended to protect against
rifle rounds, which, with the exception of the various .22 rounds, are
*high* velocity, *high* power. 

So, not understanding this, they decided to try defining "Armor
Piercing" rounds as those which pentrate a typical "bullet-proof" vest,
rather than as rounds which can penetrate *real* armor.

It doesn\'t help that the cheapest ammo for several types of rifles is
surplus Russian and Soviet military ammo, a lot of which *is* "armor
piercing" in that it contains a steel "penetrator" inside the lead
bullet. Which is moderately irrelevant, since even without the
penetrator, a round would go thru a vest *or* the door of a vehicle.
With the penetrator, it may damage a car engine. 

But the point is that there\'s a difference between "armor piercing" and
"dangerous to cops". Basicly, any round useful for hunting is
"dangerous to cops".

And then there\'s those *ultra*-realistic reproduction guns that I hear
are so popular in Japan. Which *used* to be able to interchange parts
with the real thing until there were some unfortunate incidents where
people swapped in a *real* barrel and receiver and shot someone. :-(

    I\'m a gun addict but this is getting to me. No further away than 20km
from my house a guy called Martin Bryant calmly walked around killing people
with a semi-auto rifle. He killed thirty four people and wounded eighteen,
most were trapped in a restaurant as he stood in the doorway. He delivered
coup de gras to children while adults were in the room trying to get out. If
he had a knife he would not of made it, they would have swarmed him and he
would have been caught. He had time to reload several times because too many
of his victims were too terrified to try and knock him over.
    Our government responded to this by banning semi-autos and cutting back
on mental health spending, no one was surprised.
    Before he walked up and pulled the trigger, Bryant was a desperately
sick young man who was being neglected by his society. Bryant would carry
his SKS around and regularly threaten people with it. He wasn\'t evil or
wearing a black hat. All he needed was the community (?!) to recognise his
illness and attempt a cure. As his choices narrowed due to his illness he
became more frantic which resulted in Australia\'s worst killing spree. Its
the lonely people who stew over their guns that need help before they hurt
others and themselves.

I can understand the Maritimes petitioning to join the USA, beign cut off

Our provinces have powers the individual states used to have??? Like

federal crimes). So we have one Criminal Code for the entire country.

We don\'t have "socialized medicine" -- we have a publicly-funded universal
health care insurance plan. Think of it as a "single-payer" system like
I keep reading about that some people down your way propose.

(In a true "socialized medicine" system, doctors are employees of the 
state and are paid a flat salary; private practice is virtually unknown.
I have relatives in Europe in countries that have socialized medicine --
when they need a doctor, the only thing they can do is go to the local
clinic and wait for the next availble doctor, whoever it might be.)

In the days when lynching was most popular, you\'d have, quite literally,
whole towns coming out to join in the festivities. By the 50s and 60s, it
was no longer something that whole towns would participate in, but the worst
crimes still went unpunished because, by and large, there was a degree of
agreement with what was going on. There were also many killings which
weren\'t directly Klan related, so I\'m always leery of interpretations which
put the focus solely on them and their actions.

Well I dont know the answer to that question, or what was the third ship

That\'s funny, I didn\'t think that Canada had socialized medicine. On the

that "capitalized medicine" is all that much better.

I don\'t think that it was a U.S. Army stencil, I think that it was just the
serial number. I personally thought that the most haunting thing was that
there was a whole *warehouse* of anonymous boxes, each probably containing
something equally bizarre...

...which was a big part of the reason that I was such a sucker for the
Warehouse 23 sourcebook from Steve Jackson Games. The other part of the
reason is that I was a big Burroughs fan, and I was going through my 23

Actually IIRC they weren\'t trapped, as there was an unlocked fire-exit 
that nobody thought to try and use. What\'s more if the adults had tried 
to get out through the door he was in he wouldn\'t have been able to 
give anyone a coup de gras, as he\'d have been overrun. I can\'t help but 
think that if concealed carry of firearm was permitted Bryant wouldn\'t 
have had the opportunity to kill so many, as someone would\'ve nailed 
him.

Here in NZ we had someone (Anderson?) go after his family while they 
were holding a reunion. He killed six people, and one of them was shot 
after he\'d got his shotgun and was going for the ammo (which was stored 
separately from the gun, as required by law). If that victim had 
disobeyed the law there\'s a good chance he\'d be alive today, as well as 
those shot after him. BTW the weapon Anderson used was a single 
barrelled, single shot 12 gauge shotgun. The next day our Prime 
Minister got on the Telly and told the nation how MSSAs were evil and 
should be banned. Ain\'t gun control wonderful?

I\'d say that\'s just what any decent ship would do. Would you want to 
have a go at those who\'re towing you to your doom? IIRC HMS Warspite 
also slipped her tow on the way to the wreckers.

Those soviet or chinese "AP" rounds actually aren\'t really armour 
piercing, and IMO were never meant to be. There "penetrator" is made of 
soft steel and isn\'t really shaped right. Beside given the low 
(relatively speaking) power of the 7.62x39 round they don\'t penetrate 
very well anyway. A friend and I once set up a 1/4" steel plate at 15 
yards from us and shot it up with every weapon we had available. 30-06, 
7.62 NATO, .303 and 7.62x39 ball all penetrated, but the 7.62x39 was 
marginal (obften only partially penetrating). 5.56 NATO would only 
penetrate when it hit an already weakend point (so much for T2K\'s 
penetration ratings). .270 Winchester, 30-06, 7.62 NATO, .303 and .243 
Winchester using soft nosed hunting bullets all penetrated (though the 
.243 was marginal). 12 gauge 1oz shotgun slugs made big dents 1/2 - 
3/4" deep, but didn\'t penetrate, as did 0.58 Minie bullets from a 
Zouave replica (using standard amounts of powder for the original - not 
very hot by today\'s standards). .45 lead ball from my black powder 
rifle made dents with light loads, and would nearly penetrate at 
maximum loading.

We also had some fun shooting at a sloped 1.5" plate that my father 
uses as a backstop on his 100 yards range with various rifles. Judging 
by the size of the craters by 100 yds the 7.62x39 was starting to loose 
some energy, as were the black powder rifles, but the others were still 
blasting along quite nicely. From what I saw you\'d have to be a fair 
way away or wearing a lot of armour before the difference between the 
penetration of ball and a hunting bullet would be significant. What\'s 
more unless your armour was rigid the lack of penetration by shotgun 
slugs and large black powder weapons might not matter very much - I\'d 
say that broken ribs would be the least serious result.

BTW if anyone wants to repeat this experiment mear heavy clothing and 
good saftey glasses. The shotgun slugs, in particular, tend to splash 
and the steel core from 7.62x39 rounds sometimes bouce back if they 
don\'t penetrate.

However LSD requires a lot more care and skill to make than meth. Here 
in NZ, from what I\'ve been told, most of the acid is laced with speed. 
Bear in mind that just because there\'s only a few micrograms of acid 
there\'s no reason that 20 - 40 odd milligrams of speed can\'t be added.

USS ST. LOUIS (CL-49), after serving many years as the Brazilian cruiser
TAMANDARE, sank herself while being towed to the wreckers.  Far better,
IMHO, that ST. LOUIS went that way, rather than being turned into razor
blades.

If you have access to _Imperial Squadrons_ for T4, you can use those
rules to build squadrons.  Then, based on the budget required for a
given squadron, you can reverse-engineer the 4-8 ships in the squadron.

Personally, I wouldn\'t rate _any_ number of 400 dton patrol cruisers as
equivalent to a cruiser squadron.  I\'d probably rate them as equivalent
to SDBs, at a ratio of two patrol cruisers equals one standard 400-dton
SDB (to account for the reduced war load mandated by jump capability). 
Of course, they would be jump-capable, which makes them more
strategically deployable than SDBs of equivalent size.

_Imperial Squadrons_ (which, BTW, is based on FFW) has a table on page
28 for SDB squadrons, based on population of a world, cross-referenced
with TL.

    No, Solomani\'s want the lefties to get hit in the face with hot brass.
    You can change the handedness of the weapon. Even though it is caseless
you need a method of getting duds out of the chamber so you need a port, it
just isn\'t open often.

Yes, actually there is a really good reason that 20 - 40 odd milligrams of
speed can\'t be added. LSD is most frequently (and I mean most frequently)
sold on "tabs" of blotter paper, the average size of each individual hit is
maybe 4mm x 4mm or 5mm x 5mm and probably weighs in at about 2 milligrams.
That much speed just doesn\'t fit, and to borrow a phrase from an
over-publicized trial: "If it doesn\'t fit, you must acquit!"

Of course, if LSD is sold in some other form, perhaps it\'s possible.

It doesn\'t surprise me that you\'ve been told that it is laced with speed,
though. Anywhere you go in the U.S. you will be told that LSD is laced with
either speed or strychnine. In the U.S. there are now and have been various
organizations which test street drugs, usually affiliated with hospitals and
the like. Even in the early 70s, before LSD made the leap to blotter paper,
strychnine and methamphetamine adulteration were both extremely low,
generally under five percent. I can\'t site a physical source at the moment,
as it\'s been nearly a decade since I did the research. The company PharmChem
used to test street drugs routinely, Dr. Alexander Shulgin, was (or is) the
toxicologist over at the University of California in Berkeley and, IIRC, his
work may be useful if you\'re interested in researching as he\'s done a lot of
work concerning LSD, impurities and adulterants.

[Incidentally, I just checked the DEA\'s website to see if I could get a
quick reference, and there was no mention of the practice of LSD being cut
with other drugs. Make of that what you will, but if the practice was
common, I think that they might mention it, even in passing. They *did*
mention the practice of applying LSD to other substances and pawning them
off as something else which has a higher street value, but that\'s simply a
case of misrepresentation, not a case of LSD being cut with another
substance.]

Well, if the weapon _has_ an ejection port (for misfires, I guess, if
the weapon uses caseless ammo), then I would think that one could design
the stock with ejection ports on both sides.  Provide a couple of parts
to deflect the brass (if non-caseless) and/or non-firing rounds to the
side away from the firer\'s face, through the port in the appropriate
side of the stock, and you\'re in business.

ISTR that the Steyr AUG bullpup rifle (fires 5.56mm NATO ammunition,
IIRC) is easily converted from right-handed to left-handed firing.

Having been trained on the M16A1, I simply taught myself to fire
right-handed.  After all, while the US Army provided plastic brass
deflectors that clip onto the M16A1, I figured that, in combat, I might
not have a brass deflector handy.

Probably the former; it\'s quite possible that left-hand dominance is a
trait linked to some desirable trait, and that eliminating left-hand
dominance would also eliminate the desirable trait.  Besides, I would
think it unwise to remove _any_ trait from the gene pool, unless it can
be shown that the trait is both uniformly harmful, and has no
counterbalancing benefits.  F\'r instance, while sickle-cell anemia
(having two recessive sickle-cell genes) is harmful, sickle-cell _trait_
(having only one sickle-cell gene) provides resistance to malaria.  The
most likely course would be to discourage two recessive gene carriers
from having children that would inherit the harmful recessive gene from
both parents.  How this would be achieved would depend on the
technological prowess and cultural values of the society in question. 
(In other words, with one OT flamewar already raging on the list, I
choose not to kindle another one.)

Not counting later additions (see the Book of Mormon) or heavy edits (like 
the Melchizedek Bible) the \'core books\' would almost certainly survive, 
probably very accurate and with a number of Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic 
scholars as a result. The idea of promoting education as a means to the end 
of better religious knowledge has been an impetus to education for the 
entire world. The Jewish dedication to education, the rise of the Mullah 
groups in Arabic lands, the European college system, the examination process 
of dynastic China, the oral histories of Celtic, African, Native American, 
and Central Asian groups were primarily for the retention and transmission 
of religious/philosophical information.

ObTrav: Would the graduates of various Vilani \'cooking schools\' have heated 
arguments over \'dogma\'? What would Muslims do if they could never perform 
the Hajj? Do various Christian sects argue about if you must be on Terra to 
experience the Rapture?

In large parts of Asia racism is perfectly acceptable, I say this as one who

fact that I\'m Japanese, or the fact that I\'m Irish (which they often confuse
with British despite the fact that we were forcibly colonized too)!  And I

It\'s funny, but I never had a problem with the M16A1s. I don\'t know 
whether our ammo was different, or whether the weapon were just so worn 
they didn\'t kick the cases hard enough, but the only time I ever had 
anything happen was when a plastic blank melted on ejection and 
splattered across my right cheek (and the inside of the receiver,

The Styer AUG and the French FA-MAS(?) both use a bolt that can have 
the ejector switched to the other side, thus throwing the cases to the 
left as opposed to the right. They also have an ejection port on each 
side, and you just cover the one you\'re not using. However this is not 
something you can do in the heat of the moment, so I strongly recommend 
that you make sure that your buddy has the same handedness as yourself -
 those cases are bloody hot! Oh, yeah - even with the right handedness 
weapon watch hip-fire, too. The cases tend to get caught on your hip, 
and can burn (or worse, jam the weapon).

Actually, if I get the story line correct, the Ancients distributed Homo
around 3-400,000 years ago? If so then it would have been Homo erectus,
not Homo habilis or Homo sapiens. The first known populations Homo
sapiens, at least by the majority of scholars, were probably around
100,000 to 150,000 years ago (archaic Homo sapiens), probably in South
Africa. This would collate with the African Eve theory based on
mitochondrial DNA. Indeed, there is more diversity amoung the
populations in Africa than between Africa and the rest of the world.

However, there is a minority competeing theory called regional evolution
put forth that claims that all the regional variation in the human
species was due to parallel evolution in diverse, semi-isolated
population of Homo Erectus with just enough admixture to keep us all one
species.

So if one takes the fist theory and grabs a population of at least 1000
(the number necessary for sucessful propogation with minimal effects of
Founders Syndrome), then they would have of all likely hood come from
Africa since this is the only possible viable source of sucessful sub
species of Home erectus. However, the second theory would allow for the
small phenotypical differences aoung the Human race by because of the
regional viablility of Homo erectus, thus they could have been snatched
from anywhere H. erectus was found.

All of this would, of course, be moot if the Ancients just said to heck
with it and introduced their own solutions....

OUCH!

Seriously, the first day I saw my M16A1 in basic training, long before
we actually sent rounds downrange, I decided to shoot right-handed (even
though I had learned to shoot civilian rifles left-handed).  When I saw
that ejector port, I figured, "Why take the risk?"

Nearly 16 years later, I\'ve managed to qualify on the M16A1/M16A2 every
training year, so shooting with my "off-hand" (and weak eye) for rifles
hasn\'t hurt me much.  (I have some sort of weird task-related hand
dominance: I play pool, open jars, and shoot civilian rifles
left-handed; and I write, throw, and shoot the M16 right-handed.)

1.  Given the speculation about Vilani canniblaism, I doubt that the
Vilani would be squeamish about cooking "dog"mas.  Naturally, dogmas
such as chihuahuas, with their high metabolisms, would be less efficient
sources of protein than dogmas such as St. Bernards....  >;-)

2.  For a discussion of this very issue, check the TML archives
beginning in early November 1999 for the topic "Islamic Observances in
Interstellar Space."  (Yes, Rick, I started the thread in question, in
response to a previous thread on "Cultural Differences.")

3.  I strongly suspect that, if the Rapture hasn\'t occurred by M:1100
(approximately AD 5700), the entire concept of the Rapture would be
somewhat discredited.

No accounting for the behavior of SIGINT weenies.... ;-)

Of course, as a soul-twisted (and soul-twisting) HUMINTer, there\'s only
one way to respond to _my_ likely behavior:  Keep Your Distance.  (I
recently received an Army Achievement Medal for scripting an exercise
for my National Guard unit.  The last sentence of the citation read: 
"When SFC Groth dies, he will go to Hell as a black-hatted cadre
member."  \'Nuff said.)

If the "Single Payer System" isn\'t a form of socialized medicine, nothing
except the US PHS and similar would be. Looking at the socialized medicine
in the US, it is often payments set at specified rate, and the doctor may
as well be on government wage... and, at least in Alaska\'s Mental Health
Care System, the payment rate is low enough that most private practitioners
won\'t take the cases... Fromm what I\'ve read, canada\'s system is somewhat
better... but, like other forms of limited socialization of a field, prices
tend to be at or near the "approved rates".

I know that my office\'s rates for clients are set to the State Subsidy
levels... basically, since we can\'t charge more than Medicaid and Medicare
will pay, and we aren\'t allowed to have different pricing for non-medicare,
except on a case by case, income-based sliding scale, most private carriers
set payment rates for Mental Health to the Medicaid/Medicare levels... so
all our client time is billed at the subsidy rate, OR LESS...

Ob Trav: I can think of only a few fields that would have subsidies in the
3I: Shipping, Ships, and System Forces. Maybe commo and starports... IMTU,
the "standard Rates" are the 3I\'s voucher redemption rates for 3I personell
and equipment travelling.

The one (and only) caseless weapon I\'ve ever seen didn\'t have an ejector
port at all... The primer goes down the barrel. (I don\'t know the model,

If the primer goes down the barrel, then the only factor is the human
interface... I\'d rather have a hand-specific grip (more comfortable) than
an ambidexterous grip. (I\'ve done a *LITTLE* competitive shooting, with
both handed and ambi weapons). Cutlases with half baskets are NOT likely to
be fully ambi, nor are the "Blade" 3/4 basket short-sword/long dagger;
ironically, most full baskets are ambi.

IMTU, I once let a PC have a trained semi-uplifted bobcat. It was trained
to use the fresher. It later became a PC. The phrase "Dingle, Dingle,
Dingle" is enough to get groans from any of the players who were in the
group at that time. Name of the Cat was Damncat!. When it was discovered he
really was sentient, he became a citizen, following his assignment to the
Huscarles of a Duchess.

As one of those lefties myself, this question has particular relevance to me.
Another problem you missed is the safety/selector switch and the magazine
release (these are generally designed for right handers too). Most modern
military rifles either can be changed for either left or right handed firing (such
as the Steyr AUG) or come in left and right handed versions (such as the
Enfield L64). But it really is a problem. Back when I was trained I used either
a FN-FAL or a Sterling SMG, neither of which is leftie friendly. It was a real
pain, I even resorted to firing the Sterling upsidedown on occasion!

Yes. In DGP\'s old Traveller\'s Digest 19, there was an interview with Desmond
Trinoch, Chairman of the Solomani Confederation High Council. In it he
specifically refers to the "Holy Bible of old Terra" and tells a quick
snippet of the story of King Solomon, the baby and the two mothers. He uses
the analogy to compare the factions\' greed (except the Solomani of course)
in allowing their child, the Imperium, "...to be murdered. No man or woman
who would commit such a crime is worthy to lead any other."

Great article, but then again this is the Solomani Movement that\'s being
highlighted here. They too have their heroes and villains.

And Canada\'s single-payer system is what all the media wants us to look
toward for a "better health care system, just like Bill and Hillary. BAD
EXAMPLE for Americans! Other countries, such as the Federal Republic of
Germany, have a health care system which is a partnership between the
government, the providers and the insurers. I have a nephew who will be 9 in
January, and he was born in a German hospital (and for now he has dual
citizenship), there were some complications in his delivery. He eventually
came through OK, but at least his mother (my sister) didn\'t have to worry
about the bills.

Which brings up an interesting conjecture. Not sure if this is off-topic.
For anyone who watches Sliders, do the Kromaggs represent an evolved homo
erectus or something else?  Could it also mean that at least one of the
human minor races could have evolved into something similar?

This is, of course, assuming that not all forty or so human minor races have
been catalogued in the OTU. If they have, well, IMO it wouldn\'t be too hard
for a ref to come up with some stats.

300,000. The whole Ancient period only spans 20,000 years, from ca.
- -310,000 to -290,000. Some MT publications erroneously introduced the
figure -400,000, but that is a mistake.

Unfortunately the history of the Traveller universe must have been written
before this theory achieved currency (or maybe the authors used outdated
sources). In the TU many descendents of H. antiquitus [my term for whatever
human subspecies the Ancients collected] are able to interbreed with Homo 
sapiens sapiens. As I understand it, this means that their oldest common
ancestor, H. antiquitus must have been H. sapiens too. Not necessesarily H. 
sapiens neanderthalensis and certainly not H. sapiens sapiens, but definitely
H.  sapiens _something_. This may not accord with the current knowledge of
the Real world, but then, the Traveller universe is not the Real World.

Well, the \'just enough admixture\' didn\'t happen between human populations
stuck on different planets. In the case of Darrian it didn\'t even happen
between the five population groups they were divided into.
 
If you insist that the Traveller universe must be just like the Real World,
I suggest that current scientific theories about the evolution of man are
wrong.

Well Russell I\'ve read it. I can\'t say that I can wholeheartedly sugest
it to anybody else though.

It\'s 1400 pages long including aproximately 200 pages of endnotes.
(which you do have to read because a large number of them are page
long sections of plot and charecter.) The book also goes into a lot of
detail regarding the philosophy of alchoholics annonymous. Reasonably
well writen and it has a few good laughs but large portions of it are
about as pleseant as an AA meeting. YMMV.

And had your sister\'s experience happened to a Canadian, there\'d be no
difference -- we don\'t have to worry about the bills either. The biggest
difference between the health care system here and the one in Germany is
that here, the patient still has some choice regarding which doctor to 
see. This being the case, I find myself perplexed as to why you\'d think
Canada\'s system would be a "BAD EXAMPLE" for Americans, then turn around
and point at Germany as being a good one. Unless for some reason you think
that we, as patients, shouldn\'t have the element of choice when it comes
to our medical care.

Wait, I forgot -- the HMO system in the US also removes the element of
choice from the patient, so I guess you\'re used to that already.  :-D

I seen to remember reading that there was an incident back in the 50\'s in
the North Carolina Mountains, Klan vs. Cherokee. Supposedly the Cherokee,
being far better shots and better armed, won.   Of course it helped that the
incident reportedly happened on a moon lit night, all their oponents were
wearing white sheets, excellent targets, and they had the home court
advantage.   Does anyone have a citation regarding the truth of this?   I
seem to remember reading it about it in a Time Magazine article many years
ago.

As an occasional photographer I often travel with an old medium format twin
lens reflex camera or two.  If you\'ve never seen one they are a rather large
rectangular box type camera with two lenses on the front.   You focus by
looking down into a screen on the top.  If they are loaded I always have
them hand checked.   Airport security invariably checks such cameras by
looking through the view screen at the top ignoring the fact that they have
second large film chamber at the bottom... remember it\'s a "twin lens"
camera not a single lens reflex.  Such people look but they don\'t see.  If I
have the time, an empty camera and there is no line I occasionally educate
them by removing the lens board and showing them how to check one properly.
I figure the life I save may be my own.

On the flip side on one occasion I had an officious old biddy open every one
of the 35 mm plastic film cans I had in the bag, my guess is that she was
looking for dope.  On a second occasion I had to stop security from opening
a factory sealed box of unexposed 8 by 10 inch sheet film for one of my
large format cameras.   I told him he was welcome to break the seal and open
it if he wanted to but if he did so he bought it and I wanted the twenty
five bucks up front.

I\'m thinking you want to be real careful about using old wills to decide what 
the common man cared about. 
1. Intestacy laws were common and well understood, will laws were very formal 
and hard to comply with, it took a lawyer in many cases [heck, it still does, 
no matter what those do-it-yourself books say]
2. Inter vivos gifts of possessions were common, land was the main thing that 
came under the statute of frauds and had to be written out if a different 
outcome from the intestacy laws was desired [of course, gifts to children 
during life back then would count off their share under probate, so they may 
be some value records from court, but not in the wills themselves]
3. Many other anti-gunners quote British authors commenting about the 
mid-1800s American south, and how violent all the people were, how they would 
fight at the drop of a hat for honor, and how common guns and the use of guns 
was in formal or informal honor duels, and how everyone was armed...which is 
it?

Ummn...commerce was the _major_ reason for going. Columbus was trying to
find a short route to the Spice Islands, remember, and all the gold that
Marco Polo had written about in far off Cathay.

When the Spanish started bringing gold and silver back to Europe,
England, the Netherlands, Denmark, and France all decided to get in on
the goodies.

We\'ll be in space for good when somebody can make a profit, other than
selling launch vehicles or comsats.

 Most such "incidents" were purely local. Things like the local KKK boys
 getting drunk and deciding to "scare the niggers" by burning a cross on
 someone\'s lawn, or at the local black church (or even burning the
 church). Some sympathetic white would anonymously call the target(s)
 and warn them. So the white hood brigade shows up and run into some
 blacks, armed with shotguns (hard to take away when they use them to
 hunt for food!). 
 
 In one case I heard of, the blacks waited until the KKK goons got out
 of the cars and then (from cover) blew the hell out of the *cars*.
 After all, they didn\'t want to get in trouble for shooting a white man.
 
 The cars that were still drivable got packed full of KKK members in
 full (panicked) retreat. And the ones that weren\'t drivable got towed
 away later as abandoned. And by mutual, unspoken agreement, the blacks
 didn\'t ask any questions about who owned the cars, and the law didn\'t
 ask any questions about how they came to be shot up. 
 
 You have to keep in mind that while *most* Southerners thought that
 blacks were "inferior" they *didn\'t* approve of KKK tactics such as
 shootings, burnings, hangings and mutilations. So when the KKK got
 whupped in one of these confrontations, most of the locals would think
 "serves \'em right" as long as the blacks didn\'t get "uppity" because of
 it.

The book was "Negros with Guns", a paperback written by the leader of a 
localised  black defense force. I found a copy in the university library 
during undergrad and did a short report [now lost]. I cannot recall his name, 
and the book was old, the U had put those cardboard covers on it to keep it 
going.
The gist was that he was a former Marine who rose to the local NAACP 
leadership, he also led the local black gun club. The NRA provided training 
and M1s [WWII 30-06 semi auto 8 shot rifles], and he purchsed old nazi stuff 
to fill out the ranks. The book has some cool tales of using rifles to drive 
off white forces drive-by attacks, he trained his defense troops to judge 
their fire by watching for the flashes when the rounds hit the cars. They 
also used rifle fire to drive off a small plane which they had been warned 
was on a bombing mission against their headquarters house. They later held a 
white couple for either racial dislike of whites or to save their lives, and 
the Feds got involved, decided that the nazi rifles meant they were bad 
people, and the leader was forced to flee to Cuba. Along the way the national 
NAACP decided that guns and defending yourself was bad and booted him out, 
the locals voted him back in. The usual thing that happens to a disarmed 
people after a conflict happened after the black forces were broken up. Try 
to find a copy if you want to learn about how to defend an oppressed people, 
if you can read past his pro-commie anti-US political views

	Interesting ... never heard this one. Any reason it hasn\'t been
corrected in any of the umpteen updated and redone translations since
KJ? My copy of the NRSV still has it steal/covet ...

ObTrav ... what if the first translation of the Warrant of
Restoration into planet A\'s native language was mistranslated ... and
the Imperium liked the mistranslation better, so they never corrected
it. How would planet A react when they discover they\'re getting
screwed (more than other worlds)?

Doesn\'t current research (which I only read patchily, I admit) suggest
that the "founding population" that contributed to the contemporary human
population was also quite small, not more 10,000 or so?  This is in the
same range as the "canonical" numbers of transplaned proto-Zhodani, for
example.

	Yeah, and having seen some of these inventories, there\'s going to be
at least 20% of the items on the paperwork missing, and 10% of the
items on hand won\'t be listed at all ... you go through a paper
exercise (Report of Survey) on the items you can\'t quickly find and
wind up just adjusting the paperwork ...

	I actually heard a rumor that, the first time this referendum came
up, some of the Canadian provinces quietly inquired of the US State
Department what the procedure would be ... just in case.

There are designs for bullpup weapons that eject the spent cases straight
down.

The French FAMAS http://www.remtek.com/arms/famas/index.htm can be switched
from right to left handed firing with a few adjustments.  I can see an
advanced version doing this with as little as the flip of a lever.

With a caseless round, you wont have to worry about it.

Yep - gets rid of all those people who keep their mouse of the left side of

Actually, it is not to laugh, it is to wait...and wait...and wait...

Besides, I forgot....The SE does have a 68000 chip, running at a whopping
16 mhz! (My old Plus runs at 8)

A while back, the MB died on my PPC, and while I was waiting for a
replacment to arrive, I drug out the ol\' Mac Plus to at least dial in for
e-mail...

Whew! \'Twas an...interesting experience, to say the least. I went from a
75 mhz 32bit processor, 96 mb RAM,  2 17" monitors at 24 bit color to a 9\'
B&W screen on a machine with a 40 megabyte HD and 4 Mb of RAM.

It felt like I was working in a shoebox.

But once I swung back into it a while, it wasn\'t nearly as sluggish as I
would have thought. Pretty amazing for an antique...

And the speed difference wasn\'t as apparent as when I went to my (now) 233
mhz 604 from the 75 mhz 601.

Then again, At work I have a 350 mhz PIII that I can\'t really tell a lot
of difference from the 266 PII it used to be. We refresh the technology at
work a _little_ faster than I do at home ;-)

obTrav...what would it be like for someone used to working on TL-14 ships
to sit down at a TL9 console? I mean, the equivalent leap to us is the
difference between a 777 cockpit and a steam locomotive...

IIRC, as I finally gave up on Sliders after they started that whole Kromagg
silliness, the Kromaggs are supposed to be from a line where baboons
achieved sentience.

Since baboons are extraordinarily vicious little pricks, they do make for a
good enemy.

Yes, they have, to rather grim efficiency. The estimates were that 1-2
million were killed, with hundreds of thousands \'merely\' maimed, by having
their arms, hands or feet hacked off.

CF: Rwanda...the vast majority of the genocide was carried out with
machetes. They ran out of ammunition very early.

Feh.  You can\'t get rid of us sinister folks that easily.

Oddly enough, even though I\'m left handed, I was taught to fire a sniper
rifle right handed.  So when I use a scope-sighted weapon, I fire right,
otherwise, I fire left.  Another reason I want a MP-5, they make a left
handed model (whimper).

And we keep the trackball on the right side of the keyboard.

Well, the flip side of this is that had he been arrested for threatening
people with a firearm, the whole thing would have been stopped as well,
before anyone was hurt, and without the vast political consequences.

Unless laws are very different in Australia, what he did is assault with a
deadly weapon, or as a lesser crime, brandishing a weapon, certainly a
prosecutable offense.

I sat on a jury and helped convict a couple of young idiots who did
just that, pointing a gun at someone, because it would \'scare\' them. 

They could have gotten up to five years for that one, as they were
convicted on two counts each.

The question mainly is why was his illegal and threatening behavior for so
long?

Arizona has quite liberal gun laws; concealed carry with permits, open
carry just about anywhere (and many people do), but you\'ll get pounced
upon by the cops for waving it around like that.

My wife has a slight problem when firing my 1911 Officers Model.  The brass
describes a perfect arc from the ejection port straight back towards her -
landing right between her breasts.

Needless to say, she never wears anything low-cut to the range anymore.

Sweeet!  I am having to force myself to learn left-handed firing.  In the
class I took last night, we worked on loading, racking the slide, and firing
with the off hand only.  Ouch!  I\'m really a big supporter of ambidextrous
controls on *everything* now.

Still,  it would be easier if everyone was right handed - like the rest of
the universe.

I think you mean it would lead to less control of the congress by the above
mentioned states. Reps are based on population and unless all of our
citizens moved to the new Canadian states, our representation in Congress
would not decrease at all. We would still have the raw numbers, but a
smaller percentage of the overall representation.

Then again I firmly believe that once Canadians lost that "I\'m not an
American Bias" anyway, they would all move to Texas or California like the
other Northerners have :)
Then we would get even more Reps  :)

Supporting your argument was a recent article purporting that true natural
blondes will someday become extinct.  It has to do with dominant genes.
The only blondes you will see a few hundred years from now will be a select
few "purebreds" or those whose DNA has been altered at birth.

To the best of my understanding, I think that\'s more or less accurate.

That kind of thing would take a long time, if I understand correctly, and
further it only works if modern life doesn\'t override evolution in some way
or another.

Well, not exactly, it merely invalidates "racism" as entrenched in
biological "fact" to the extent that it was thought to be during the 19th
and early 20th centuries. Racism serves as a placeholder for the belief that
differences in gross morphology also indicate differences in mental, moral
and aesthetic capabilities, and that these differences can be ranked in a
hierarchical fashion.

Well, if we thought we could get away with it, the Pacific Northwest
(WA, OR, ID, MT) And Alaska might try to get together with those
western provinces (or at least some of them) and form a nation on our
own. To the best of my knowledge, *none* of the above
states/territoriries has a lot of use for their current central
government, and they have a lot in common with each other.

Some of us would *welcome*. It gets *really* old having a "choice"
between two parties both of whom have platforms you can\'t support.
Usually because half of each is *against things you are for, and the

Heck, *ships* are allowed that in most versions of the rules. They tend
not to go above the g-comp limits because for anything much bigger than
a fighter, running at more than the g-comp limit is going to make
operating the ship a *real* pain.

Urban legend. Much as members of the Wiccan community would like that
to be true, it isn\'t. However, the type of "magic practioner"
translated as "witch" wasn\'t much like we\'d consider a "witch".

The Koran will almost certainly be recognizable, and in fact,
unchanged. Mohammed had seen the strife that differing interpretations
and translations caused in the Christian world. So the Koran isn\'t
"supposed" to be translated.

In actuality, it does get translated to allow for more converts. But
the translations are not considered the "real" Koran. Instead, if
there\'s a question about what a passage means, you have to examine the
original Arabic text (which is unchanged and likely to remain so). This
also keeps Arabic alive as a language. 

The Torah is unlikely to change, for similar reasons. The
*commentaries* are likely to be more extensive, but it\'s doubtful that
the actual Torah would change. 

The KJV Bible *can\'t* change, because "KJV" refers to a *specific*
edition/translation. But there are *lots* of translations of the Bible.
And they are rather more likely to *converge than diverge, barring new
archeological discoveries. 

On the other hand:

The interpretations of the Bible will continue to diverge. Islam may
acquire a few more branches. Judaism probably won\'t. And both
Christianity and Islam will generate *more* "daughter religions". 

Examples of "daughter" religions:

Judaism -> Christianity, Islam
Christianity -> Islam, "Mormons"
Islam -> Ba\'hai(sp?)

Yes and no. Some "racial characteristics" are just plain "random
changes" that spread through a population because they didn\'t *hurt*
anything.

It\'ll take more than a "few millenia". Remember, what matters is the
number of *generations*. 4000 years is *only* 160 generations. Since we
are *not* deliberately breeding for characteristics, it\'ll take
*thousands* of generations to see noticable changes. Say 25k years
*minimum*.

Then consider that since we developed technology, we tend to adapt
environments to us, instead of the other way around. That *greatly*
reduces selection pressure.

One species yes. Possibly multiple races.

One interesting possibility is that some of the races of humaniti in
the imperium have "drifted" far enough that they are incapable of
producing fertile offspring with some other races. 

So, say for example, Solomani and Vilani can produce viable offspring,
and Zhodani and Vilani can also, but Solomani and Zhodani *can\'t*. 

That would be *definite* proff that we are dealing with one species,
but different races (sub-species), and also that we are approaching the
point of speciation, if the populations remain (essentially) isolated
for some more generations (lots more).

Assuming you "borrow" a few famous planets from well known SF:

Mesklin: Since personal computers got powerful enough, Hal Clement was
         able to simulate it himself, and found that the planet is
         *not* an oblate spheriod. It\'s closer to a discus shape(!).
         And while the equatorial gravity remain 3g, polar gravity
         drops to a "mere" 250g.  And the rotational period ("day")
         remains at 17.8 minutes.

I advise caution in adding this planet to your universe. While the
natives are low TL when first contacted, they learn well. And do you
*really* want whatever power "owns" Mesklin to be able to field fighter
pilots who think 250g is "a bit heavy".  

The one bright spot is that Mesklinite reaction times are *not*
superhuman. Just their g-tolerance.

Rocheworld: The most spectacular known "double planet". Two earth-sized
            worlds of almost equal size/mass revolving about a common
            center, just barely outside each other\'s Roche limit. They
            are so close that they shar a common atmosphere. And once a
            year, there is a "waterfall" from one to the other.

Anybody else have some planets that are interesting as *planets*?

Note: don\'t bother trying to use Alan Dean Foster\'s "Moth". Planetary
ring systems can do a lot of neat things, but not *that*!

IIRC he was grabbed, but as he was mentally disturbed he was put into 
the mental health system, that then released him (proably from lack of 
money). It seems to be a trend to do this, and then blame the results 
on the guns, not the lack of mental health funding. Certainly here in 
NZ we\'ve been having an upsurge of disturbed people being shot by the 
police (though the police have also been taking a more aggresive 
attitude) because they\'ve been thrown out of the system.

Most modern pistols have safetys that are ambidextrous, by having the 
lever on both sides. I found the M16A1 to be quite leftie friendly, in 
fact some of the layout seems to make more sense for a left handed 
shooter than for a right.

Personally I doubt this because you\'d get blonde children from non-
blonde parents that are carrying the recessive blond gene. If this 
extinction of blondes was true we should have lost blue eyes everywhere 
that there are brown eyed people, like England and France.

Want me to start pointing out the potential arguments in favbor of it
being due in AD 6000?

Oh yeah, expect a *big* Christian "millenialist" movement around AD
4000, the logic being that Adam was 4000 years before Christ, so the
second coming should "logically" be 4000 years *after* Christ. (This is
by analogy to a currently popular thread of "logic" that goes something
like: Adam to Abraham = 2000 years, Abraham to Christ = 2000 years,
therefor Christ to End = 2000 years, along with some logic that says
Creation to End = 6000 years)

The "Kromaggs" represent an evolved "Cro-Magnon" as conceived by a
typical TV "idiot staffer" who wasn\'t aware that *we* are "Cro Magnon"
or near enough as makes no difference. The perpetrator was *probably*
thinking of Neanderthals. Of course, that\'s no good either, since once

There is a real life parallel to this concept which you can use as a
resource for such a background.

In New Zealand, we have a document known as the "Waitangi Treaty", in which
the signatories, who were the "chiefs" of the various Maori tribes
relinquished their sovereignity to the British Crown in exchange for certain
guarantees.

This has two versions, the Maori version and the English version.

To be charitable, it is "unclear" if the differences in meaning were
intentional or just mistranslation, but it has been a bone of contention
ever since.

There are other discrepancies, such as people signing for tribes who may not
have had the right to sign for that tribe, and some tribes who are not
represented at all in the document , and therefore, theoretically have never
relinquished soveriegnity.

When you take into account the abuses of the treaty over the years (on both
sides) there are far more interesting events than I have time to recount
here.

The one thintg I would say is that the Treaty was pushed through by the then
Governor (actually he nmay not have had the title "Governor" at that time)
in an attempt to put in place a legal framework that would give him an
excuse to control the abuses of the _settlers_ (such as the two brothers who
had just "purchased" almost a quarter of the country from a representative
of one of the tribes.) not as the result of a military campaign on either
side.

One of the problems was that there were settlers from many different races
in New Zealand, not all of whom recognzed the right of the British to govern
here, but once the Treaty had been signed, there was "evidence" of the
British Crown controlling the country, allowing the governor to act against
foreign nationals using British law.

In fact, the "Maori Wars", occurred after the treaty.

But we won\'t go into that, I have a major disagreement with the country\'s
"top" historian on that subject, one James Belich, largely because he
obviously knows nothing of military history, claiming the Maori invented
"trench warfare" and similar stupidities.

The last time I heard this idea, it involved a combination of all of the
states and provinces that boarder the Pacific Ocean, with Alberta thrown in
as well-- once suggested as being possibly the wealthiest non-existant
"country" of the 20/21 century.

Think of the resources available:  forestry, fishing, mining, oil & natural
gas, aerospace, tourism, Silicon Valley, Microsoft, Hollywood (North *and*
South), Doug Berry, etc.

Good point, though I suspect that was because it was unneccessary, Wells
only showed one artillery unit and a calvary unit being destroyed as well,
not the whole military, one assumes any large scale battle was won by the
Martians.

Of course, the majority of British military might would have been out of
England at the time, and any fleet units in the area would have been
involved in a similar battles with tripods at other ports.

That is, assuming they could be crewed and put to sea on time. The whole
idea of 24-hour readiness for military units not in hostile terrain didn\'t
catch on until much later.

It is my belief that it is not poverty or social disparity that

David, I have tried to be patient with you, because this is
a very emotional issue for some; however, you have
attacked the opposition in this thread, rather than offering
reasoned answers to thier arguements.  You have diverted
and redirected and made arguements to counter that have
nothing to do with thier points.  The above is a good
example.  Harold was not talking about ownership, but
rather about rights.  The right to bear arms (including
guns) was one of the things that the American War of
Independance was fought over.

If you would care to clarify the first question, I might be
willing to comment.  As to the second, I have never heard
such an arguement made; therefore, I must assume that
it is rhetorical and need not be answered. The matterial I
snipped from your post was much the same.  You make
statements that you project to be the thinking of the "gun
supporters."  And then attack them for make such
statements (which they never made).

Speaking of making a profit in space.  Is there anything
about asteroid mining in Traveller?  I seem to remember
a flow-chart kind of thing in one of the TAS issues.  I
believe that it even made it into one of the Best Of TAS
issues.  Has there ever been anything official in the way
of Asteroid Mining in any of the Traveller incarnations?

We have manuscripts of the Torah that are 3000 years
old, that are almost exactly the same as the ones being
printed today.  I don\'t believe that another 3700 years will
make much difference.  After all, we are talking about the

The Word of God, those who follow said teaching DO

The G-11 being one of them-- not for ejecting spent cases (since the G-11
was caseless), but to clear misfires as someone else mentioned.

Most of the survival rifles like you describe that I\'ve seen have been
single-shot guns that break open. (Over-under config. with the .22 on top
and either a .410, 20 gauge, or 12 gauge on the bottom. After you shoot a
barrrel, you have to break open the gun to reload the barrel.)

	I don\'t know if this is true or not, certainly there

	I think that it is safe to say that Canada is

	Nor in the same fashion, but we certainly do share
	many British traditions.

	Canada is a republic?  When did that happen?  ;)
	Yes, we are effectively a republic, even though our
	official head of state is still a monarch (Queen
	Elizabeth).

>and merging Canada into the US would simply result in (IIRC)

	That depends on how you make the states.  Canada has
	10 provinces, 2 territories, and Nunavut (a new
	political unit that used to be much of the Northwest
	Territories), so 13 could work.

	Our armed services certainly do work together, but I\'m

	being considered "semi-integrated."  :)

	That\'s probably true, though you\'ve probably never gone

	Quebec seperatists get a lot of press, but a lot of our

Brings to mind an old Mad magazine strip in their Star Wars spoofs. Luke is

no, the house of reps has been fixed at 435 members; the number of reps is
indeed based upon population, but said basis is splitting the 435 available
seats so each state gets 1, and any state gets shares proportionate to
their population. This change occured in 1929 [Current & Goodwin, _A
History of the United States Since 1865_, New York: Alfred P. Knopf, 1980,
p. iv]

Oh, and it would mean a larger senate, whose size is not fixed.

	The distinction between "race" and "species" should be
	defined.  Biologists tend to define species of mammals
	(like us) by whether or not members can successfully
	interbreed.  Thus, horses and donkeys are different
	species because their hybrid (mule) is sterile, and all
	humans are members of same species.  There are problems
	with this definition, but it works well for most mammals.
	A race is somewhat less well defined, but is is similar
	to what biologists call a subspecies (though I would
	avoid that term in PC circles).  A race may be defined
	as a population within a species that are more likely to
	share certain traits with each other than they are with
	members of other races within the same species.  By
	these definitions, we can say that there are different
	races of humans.  The differences between these races are
	though to be, as you suggest, largely due to adaptation
	to local environments.

	If you go back far enough, your ancestors were born in
	Africa, as far as we know.  :)

	Only if black people in northern climes are less likely
	to reproduce.  Currently, this does not seem to be the
	case, so I wouldn\'t expect the dark skin pigment in these
	families to disappear.

	You are correct, I am only fine-tuning the terminology
	and throwing some light on the evolutionary process.
	There is absolutely no support for racism in evolutionary
	biology, although some have tried to twist the science to
	their own ends.

Interesting, do you mean they produce sterile offspring or none at all? What

My own bet is that it\'s not a *complete* mistranslation, probably more along
the lines that the words in the original text are such that an ambiguity in
translation is possible. I remember reading that one of the terms for God in
the Old Testament can be translated as singular or plural, for example,
which has caused some people to say that a single God is a mistranslation.

I don\'t know enough beyond that to chime in.

Actually I was not insisting that the Traveller universe MUST be like
the real world (whatever that may be). I was just trying to shed some
light on some of the previous posts by outlining the current state of
affairs in Human evolution.


However, from a long past experience playing in the RPG universe I have
learned that anything goes, so it would not have been impossible that
the Ancients did some manipulation of their own. If they can take a
canine breed to sentience then what is a little tweeking on the Homo
line?? Who knows, maybe they tweaked 300,000 years ago and produced the
first Homo sapiens for both this world and export!

Funny, I originally heard this translational problem from Rev Donald
Bramble, OP, and confirmed by Rev. John Fearon, OP: "Thou Shalt not suffer
a poisoner of wells to live" is more accurate than "witch". I\'ve also
encountered this since from many jews, and had one show me in a
translation/dual language edition of the Torah this particular turn of
phrase. I\'ve never heard a wiccan quote this particular error at me; most
of them seem to like being in an "Outlawed" religion. Especially my wife.

Ob Trav: Will anybody still speak the language of the Warrant of
Restoration and Cleon Zhunastu by IY 1100? Not IMTU, except for lawyers.

The idea that the Ancients tweaked the stock left on Terra is open to
debate, and makes for some great X-File type stuff, but I thought it was a
given some of the transplanted stock got tweaked (to fit a new environment
if nothing else).  I assume such moderations could be extreme enough to
preclude interbreeding. IMTU Terran type worlds are rare and this would
require some genegineering to colonize even the more habitable planets.

Can the Jonkereen(sp?) Breed with standard human stock?

There was the process in Best of JTAS vol 1. There was a similar (but more
detailed) process in Beltstrike. I\'ve not seen any other systems for belter
action.

We know that Solomani and Vilani can interbreed, assuming you accept DGP
materials; The vilani purity table was a dead giveaway. We know that there
are individuals of Mixed solomani ancestry (AM Solomani, GDW). We know that
you can tell zhodani purebreed and solomani purebreed apart by counting
teeth. Since we never saw an AM Vilani from GDW, their details are a little
fuzzier.

Darrians are a human minor race, too. Even if they do show some 40-50
thousand years adaptations (or more). We know that they can interbreed, but
we are not shown (in AM 8, nor elsewhere I have seen) 2nd generation
hybrids.

We are not shown in GDW materials any other specific human minors of note
in detail; The hlasani are not humaniti. We are told there are others, but
not shown details of any of them.

We are shown a human minor race whose differences are the matter of having
been adapted to by a symbiote, the result is a "shaggy", whose fur is the
xenofungi symbiote; it protects the human host from the local atmospheric
taint, and draws sustinence through the human. It also suppresses the human
intellect.

If one accepts the DGP materials, then we see several more human minors.
The Jonkereen are the only ones I know to have been fully detailed,
however.

Unfortunately, we have seen references to several distinct groups of human
minors races, but not had them detailed by DGP.

Peter Newman\'s work in my campaign (and after) on one human minor show the
difficulties; he\'s still trying to add to them. Their canon reference is a
one-liner. (I have temporarily blanked on the race\'s name.) Likewise, the
Geonee, in canon, have many references, but no details.

Several third party supplements have referenced human minors; Judges guild
had at least 3 human minors with only slightly more detail than the canon
references to the Geonee... but at least JG specified their homeworlds....

I\'ve never been able to find such a statement.  FWIW, I\'ve got something
in the draft Solomani Rim book that says that all known human races
can interbreed -- although sometimes it\'s with difficulty or it requires
medical intervention.

(Of course, the canonical material on the Zhodani *does* use a different
taxonomy for them than for, say, Solomani. . .)

Actually, you\'re both right... sort of. The Hebrew word is, if I remember
correctly, "kashaph" (I\'m spelling it from memory here, I\'ll take
responsibility for any errors), which does mean poisoner, as well as
magician or sorceror. One thing about languages, which people who point out
mistranslations usually forget, is that words can have several different
meanings and connotations in a given language.

The "poisoner of wells" bit stems back to one particular 16th or 17th
century book ("The Discovery of Witches", maybe) in which there is a bit of
speculation about the meaning of the word. I\'m going from memory here.
Perhaps Kiri, our resident expert on this subject, might be able to shed
some light on the subject.

        Hi, Jason!
        There are two answers:  1)  The RealWorld(tm) answer, and 2) the
"yeah, that can be role-played" answer.  Leonard and I hashed this out
sometime ago.  If you opt for "1" the short version is that its *really*
dull  to play out and probably not worth doing...  if you opt for "2", I
have a set of proposed rules on my website (see URL below) that seems to
work out in favor of an experienced belter being able to stay ahead of the
bank on a year-to-year basis.

If anything I said can be construed as an "attack" that offended you, I
apologize.  Some things that seem to be reasoned answers to people who hold

my father and my friends.

I had a perfect opportunity to do so here a few days ago.
However, this is the Traveller Mailing List, and gun control in
the United States of America is not the topic of the list
(although gun control on Ruie, Muan Gwi, Sylea, or Dlan might
very well be).  I therefore chose to send my response to the
poster privately.  We have since had an enlightening discussion
via private mail, in greater depth than would be convenient or
comfortable here.  I urge the members of this list who are
interested in pursuing this non-Traveller discussion to follow
suit.

Naturally, if a discussion on gun control or other government
stupidities in a Traveller environment were to start here, I
would, with great enthusiasm, contribute appropriate amounts of
gasoline, napalm, and other similarly appropriate substances,
with the intent of encouraging such discussion.  But only in a
Traveller context, please.

I trust I have made my point clearly and inoffensively.

    'body' => '	I\'ve seen this notion of the US and Canada pop up in a number of
SF futures.  Shadowrun for one had some of the central eastern states and
provinces join together.  Personally I seriously doubt that Canada would
voluntarily choose to join with the US.  Despite issues about "national
identity crises" and so on, we\'re generally quite proud of our vast
wasteland (and hey, we\'ve been #1 on the UN\'s list of "countries that are
good to live in" for what, four years in a row now? :-). 

	As for military take-over, I sometimes wonder why it hasn\'t
happened yet.  No offence to our army men (both of you) but it would be
something of a cake-walk for the U.S. to take over Canada.  Apparently
plans have been drawn up on both sides of the border for just such an
eventuality.  The Canadian side would be trying a retreating defense and
guerilla tactics until (hopefully) someone else came to help us.  At the
moment, there is no political or economic incentive for the US to do this,
of course, but at times in the past there has been sufficient tension. 
Luckily Britain was a bigger power at the time and was protecting us.  Do
I remeber correctly that there is an American founding document (I don\'t
think the constitution itself, but soemthing related) that specifically
allows for Canadian provinces to becomes states? 

	Another possibility which has been mentioned is the seperation of
Quebec leading the maritimes to joine the US.  I really don\'t see why this
would be the case.  Alaska is physically seperate from the 48 continental
states, but it doesn\'t get any sudden urges to join Canada or Russia.
Presumably post-seperation relations between Canada and Quebec would be
reasonably peaceful (though tense), allowing Canadian cargoes through and
so on. Given that Quebec would seek to join NAFTA (it would have to, to
avoid even worse economic consequences than would already arise from
seperation)  flow of goods and political power to the maritimes should be
pretty smooth.

	The most likely scenario I see, given the present trend towards
everyone wanting their own individual state ("The Republic of Bob", "The
Republic of Tracy"...), is a fragmentation of Canada and perhaps the US as
well into a number of independent states within a free-trade zone.  I
could see a seperate Quebec, perhaps a seperate B.C/Alberta and maybe a
seperate Texas (Not sure about the modern realism of the last, but it has
been the case before, correct?).  Not that I want any of this, I think
Quebec would be economically shooting itself in the foot (or maybe the
head) by seperating.

It still hasn\'t caught on everywhere. I shudder to think how long it\'d 
take some of our units to be combat ready.

This brings to mind some questions about the 3I and guidelines for worlds
that join.

Texas was indeed an independent Republic at one time. We managed to make a
go of it for nearly 10 years, then due to the political beliefs of our
leadership and the economic bungling of other leaders, we joined the US.
Despite claims by fringe groups  here in Texas, it was  all nice and legal.

Now, Texas does have a unique deal with the US. We gave up a slice of
territory (parts of New Mexico and Colorado) in exchange for our debts being
paid off. Texas also maintains the rights to its offshore mineral reserves
and other nice little goodies thrown in to make our side of the bargain
fairly sweet.

Now, will the 3I make special deals with worlds that are of strategic
importance?

If you are a border world/state with the Zho\'s or someone else and the 3I
would love to have you join, will they cut your world a good deal?

Any canon references to such a situation?

You\'re pretty close - Hebrew and Aramaic were generally not (and
still generally are not) written with vowels indicated.  Instead,
words were indicated with a series of consonants carrying a
specified general meaning, and context was supposed to establish
which vowels - and therefore which specific meaning - actually
occurred.  For example, KTB is the root pertaining to writing;
specifics are KaTaB, the verb "to write", KoTa~B, "writer",
K\'TyBaH, "writing" (as in "thing written"), and so on.  Now,
"witch" is MK.S., which is also the root for "magician",
"tool/instrument", and "stumbling block" in my bad bilingual
Hebrew dictionary - and I don\'t know what else would turn up in a
good one, though I would not find it surprising for "poison" to
be among them. ("Suffer not a stumbling block to live"?  Sounds
good to me; it gives me an excuse to go postal on some of the
turds that work at MISD...)

Incidentally, the specific example you gave, about the word for
G-d being either singular or plural, is also correct; the word
"Elohim" is grammatically male-plural - but I believe that the
singular form, "Elohay" is female.  So add _that_ to the
"confusion"!

(Jeff notes that he should absolutely _not_ be posting this kind
of thing where Kenji can read it, because Kenji is far more
warped than Jeff could ever be, and will find _some_ way to use
it to murder yet _another_ innocent keyboard...)

The game "Brilliant Lances" also includes a number of ship descriptions
and stats.  The largest ship provided is the _Midu Agashaam_-class
destroyer (3000 dtons).

According to what I have read of Druse "doctrine" they say the line runs
Judaism->Christianity->Islam->Druse

They claim that each religion begot the next as a refinement and the process
culminated in the Druse religion.  I suspect to be really accurate you would
need to slip the Nestorians into the line between Christianity and Islam.

Left out of our analysis is the Hindu->Buddhist->Taoist etc. line with the
Sikhs presumedly slipped in parallel with the Buddhists, sorry but I\'m
really not that up on Eastern religions.  Just to be more inclusive wouldn\'t
it be appropriate to include Shinto as a line by itself?

Sorry, Keven, but WRONG-O! FF&S is comparable to striker and High Guard NOT
to supps 7/9. FF&S has a mere 3 vehicular designs in it.

Supps 7 & 9 were compilations of predesigned (and in the case of 7, mapped
out) ship designs ready for play. No new rules material in either of them.

True, IIRC the Greman Luftwaffe during WWII had an excellent survival
combo over/under. The top barrel was the standard 8mm Mauser and the
bottom a 12 gauge shotgun, the piece manufactured by the Drilling (sp)
Co. Really a fine piece and excellent for just about any terran survival
needs. One thing you probably do not need is an auto weapon. Too
cumbersom and to easy to expend (waste) what would be a limited ammo
supply.

Ok here is my first foray into this topic....

For those old series scouts that required upgrade.

1. the compactor malfunctions, backing up the system
so as the entire pipe bursts.

2. it fails just as a customs inspection team comes aboard.
Causing the ship to be held in impound until investigators
clear as just a malfunction.

3. as above but the investigators find some thing.


Ok there is my 3.

Quite true.

The main TNE book had several designs of ships and boats in the back, BL
and BR had several ships too, but there really wasn\'t anything like Supp 7
for TNE.  I\'m sure there would have been, eventually, but alas...

We *think* the comment came from a letter to Ben Bova from either Asimov of

Okay, I have to ask this after hearing that.  I am a typical white
anglosaxon Aussie male.  I am one of those people you mention that cannot
distinguish a Japanese from a Korean from a Chinese.  I know ALL my friends
have the same problem, but I must say, my family and I have hosted 18
Japanese students between the ages of 10 (one boy only), and 15 to 22 years
of age, both male and female over the last 6 years, with stays from 1-week
to 5-weeks.

Of ALL 18 of these Japanese students, not one could tell the difference
between the Chinese and Japanese that worked in the local Sushi Train
restaurant.  Add to this their friends hosted by other families that we
often had outings with and that makes 36+ students that couldn\'t tell, and
add to this the adult teacher Escorts that couldn\'t tell (in fact, one TE I
have become close to and correspond with regularly, told me flatly that he
couldn\'t tell a Korean, Chinese, or Japanese from each other when I once
asked that question) and you are starting to get a higher demographic still.

So, what I\'m asking is, are you extremely aware of such racial differences
in appearance to those Asian races, to be able to tell such things, and are
all those Japanese we dealt with ordinary, or are all those Japanese just
ignorant of something common and you are normal?

I know for myself, that I have Irish, Scottish, and English friends, blond
haired and blue eyed, that if you didn\'t listen to their last names (Meehan,
Gilmour, etc.), don\'t look particularly Irish, Scottish, or English over a
blond hairer, blue eyed German friend (Kurtt) that I also know well?  In
fact, put two of them together and the German bloke and they look like
brothers!!  How do you tell?  What\'s the secret?

I was referring to some incidents in the late \'50s - the "classic" Martin
Luther King period.  It was also the period that gave rise to people like
Malcolm X, and, a little later, the Black Panthers.  Native Americans got
in on the game, too, I gather.

You are right, of course, in that the terror usually goes the other way.

OBTRAV:  Like I mentioned, don\'t mess with Vargr living in the Imperium. 
At least one of the Kforuzeng\'s rival corsair bands ended up there.

Oh, a question:

The boxed set "Beltstrike" deals with"riches and danger in the Bowman Belt"
(located in District 268 of the Spinward marches) and contains a booklet
entitled "Belter\'s Handbook"  Chapter titles include:  Belter characters,
Mining the Asteroids, Zero Gravity, Low Gravity, Ships, and Equipment.  It
is copyright 1984 so I suppose this makes it a late CT product.

The module \'Beltstrike\' from CT is all about Asteroid mining. My FLGS 
has  a copy....

I have a friend who went on a scientific expedition to the arctic with some
British Schools organisation who told me that they were advised to carry at
least a pump-action shotgun, because it would likely take more than two

Take a look at the first third of Richard Rohmer\'s novel "Exxoneration"
for the enactment of such a scenario. While I tend to find Rohmer\'s
political viewpoint a little extreme, and the second two-thirds of this
book (the follow-up to another book, "Ultimatum") to be hilariously
unrealistic (PetroCan buys Exxon while Canada joins OPEC? Yeah, right...),
the first third is a fun read.

Alaska also has an important resource that allows a certain amount of
self-sufficienty: oil reserves. The Maritime provinces, on the other hand,
are a financial drain on the rest of the country.

The minute Quebec does anything to disrupt the flow of traffic on the
Seaway (which, by treaty, is an international waterway), the US military
will step in to put a stop to it.

Still, once Quebec is gone, the government can\'t use the "national unity
crisis" as an excuse to put more important issues (high taxes, the economy)
on the back burner.

Ever read Neal Stephenson\'s novel Snow Crash? The ultimate in a balkanized

Depends on what you\'re talking about. We have socialized medicine, they
don\'t.  OTOH, their farmers get far more in subsidies than our\'s do, and
they actually have more government-owned corporations than we do (we call
them crown corporations, they have a variety of names) -- at least, they
did in 1991.

Personal:  Steve Noe, married over 25 years, 2 daughters, one entering
college next year.  Currently teaching human anatomy and physiology to
allied-health wannabes at Ivy Tech State College in Indianapolis.  I\'ve
run general merchandise stores (anyone old enough to remember WT
Grant?), done research in diagnostic imaging, and done FDA compliance
for medical device and bulk pharmaceutical firms.

Other hobbies:  historical re-enactor of the French & Indian War; 
Compagnie franche de Muy, de la Marine, du Detroit.  Member of the
MidWest Tool Collector\'s Association, and Neandertal WoodDorker. 
Just Say(tm from another list), all my saws and planes are Y1K compliant.


Traveller background:  Did my graduate work at Illinois State University
in mid-late 1970\'s, when GDW was upstairs, over the Just-Rite ice-cream
shop.  I didn\'t participate in any play-testing, as pleasing Prof\'s
Mockford, Weber, and Liberta was really important, but I still have
intact copies of Raphia and of Triplanetary. %^)

Played and refereed Traveller, and some En Garde, with the CSGCI from
1980, \'til about 1990.  A gaming buddy tripped across my office, a few
months ago, and hooked me into the list.

I don\'t have the time (see other hobbies, above) to game face-to-face,
but would like to get into a PBEM game, emphasizing CT.  I always liked
Traveller, \'cause the object of the game was _to have an adventure_, not
gain points, or total up body counts.  Ask Ken Roney about one Munchkin
[aka The Incorrigible Bulk] who insisted on wearing (legal) CmbtAr while
passenger inboard a free trader - the AntiHijack kept locking him in his
stateroom, and it always took most of the ship\'s day to calm things
down. ;^>

Even with slugs a shotgun, IMO, would be a poor choice for defense 
against Polar Bear. A .338 magnum would be more like it (more range, 
more energy, more penetration). IIRC Browning BLRs come in .338 
Winchester Magnum for those who think a bolt action too slow.

Sterile "mules" are more likely, but if the drift has been large
enough, you won\'t get any live births, and if it\'s much greater than
*that*, you won\'t get fertilization.

No idea if the topic has ever been mentioned in canon.

You aren\'t thinking on the right timescale. Recessive *do* get lost
from populations, unless they provide an advantage of some sort. But
it\'s a *slow* process.

Sorry, but if the Pacific Northwest is going to split from the US, part
of the reason will be to get *away* from California! At an absolute
*minimum* southern CA has to be excluded.

Some of Dr. Robert Forward\'s books:

"Rocheworld"
"Return to Rocheworld"
"Ocean under the Ice"
"Marooned on Eden"
"Rescued from Paradise"

They detail the exploration of a hypothetical planetary system around
Barnard\'s Star.

Ohm, hertz that you watt to drop the current discussion, amp watt grounds

But you canuk for yourself, this is moore interesting than the alternating

Keven, I need to update your entry in the TML Roster I\'m keeping on my
website.  <g>

Just to remind everyone, and let those who are new here, I have a list of
over 100 "Fellow Travellers", with location information on my site. I\'m
always looking to add more.

Go to http://www.crosswinds.net/~erisr/ and take the link to either the
comma delimited or text rosters.

And if someone isn\'t doing it already, I\'d be happy to host a list of
active Internet games, PBEM/ICQ/IRC/etc.  If someone *is* keeping such a
list, tell me where you are and, with your permission, I\'ll link to you.

Well, we have two follow ups, but there\'s no current plan to release 
those. They\'re called:

a) \'Star Worn\' which kind of follows the adventures of some 
characters which bear a faint resemblance to something from George 
Lucas\' twisted imagination.

b) Starship Marines in Battledress - the bugs are bombing Sylea with 
significantly less than C-Rocks, the Men in Tux-Dress aren\'t sure 
what\'s happening, and what are the dear old Famille Spofulam up to?

I can\'t influence releasing these but I\'m sure someone at BITS could.

<snigger> The killer in the six table tournament was when we 
systematically took the same three players out of each game and moved 
them to a different table to simulate a time and dimensional slip.... 
:-)

Fun fun fun for everyone!

PS I must stress that this is only up for a short time for legal

We can\'t sell it :-/ I suspect that when the year strikes "00" it\'ll

I can drive from Vermont to New York without being stopped by customs
officials.  I can have a friend with a Vermont address buy a gun in
Vermont, have him hand it to me outside the store (after any waiting period)
and then drive to New York. If I keep a few km over the speed limit, I\'m
not going to be stopped.  That\'s gun control?

No, that\'s called a straw purchase, and is highly illegal.  You\'d also be
illegally transporting firearms, and depending on where you live in NY, be
guilty of possessing illegal weapons types as well as the illegally
purchased weapons to begin with.
****

obTrav, it\'s like saying that you have two planets next to each other. One
is Law Level 0 and the other Law Level 10.  But there\'s no border control
and no customs patrol.  Guess what happens?  Right. Anyone willing to break
the law can.

You want gun control, enforce a country-wide set of restrictions, eliminate
all "grandfather clauses" allowing resale of existing weapons et al (use
buy-backs if necessary), enforce drug law level penalties for
non-complience (mandatory sentencing, like there is for crack cocaine) and
offer $5,000 buy-back on any firearm not covered by the licensing. Cost you
a few billion dollars, but if you\'ve the stones for it...

****
So far, Australia & Canada have proven that gun buy backs are not very
effective, and cost alot of money even with the ridiculously low rates they
pay out, not to mention how much it would cost at the rates you suggest.  I
bet even HCI would be unwilling to suggest spending several BILLION dollars
on such a program.  They\'d get crucified.
****

Otherwise, all you can say is "the half-hearted, castrated gun laws that
the United States can pass are ineffective in reducing crime."  Thought
experiment: try it with drugs as well. Ban \'em in one state, allow
relatively free sales in another, and see what happens. Answer: more crime.
 Why?  Smuggling, ease of access, etc.

What the US needs is _one_ system. Either the same lack of gun laws
everywhere, or the same gun control everywhere. Only then can you have a
fair trial of whether "more guns = less crime" is a proven fact or not.

****
Good points you\'ve made, but unrealistic in implementing I\'m afraid, unless
the laws were changed in the reverse of their current trends.

Yes, that\'s just how I handle it.  Everything designed

Could be, I really don\'t know.  I do know there was a "Deluxe TNE" that
contained TNE and FFS, both mk0 mod0, because I bought it.  I also
remembering my FLGS clerk telling me that BL was scheduled to arrive in a
couple of months.  RL intervened and I didn\'t look for BL for several
months after that, and never could find it locally.

Absolutely.  That\'s sort of why I thought it would have been after FFS,
improved from the experience and all.

On that sort of timescale non-advantageous dominants would go, too. In

I think, in the end, they went with a 7-round 12-guage loaded with heavy

The shotgun was only supposed to be used when the thing was charging them

I think it was mainly because BL was only concerned with ships, so they
worked it though step by step. Because FFS allows you to design ships,
ground, lift and air vehicles they have four design paths which you have to
keep stepping out of to get to the shared reference tables. It could have
been done better, but it would probably have been a bigger book.

Yes, that\'s true too. It does make it easier to follow.

It should *be* done better...if you know what I mean.

    Doesn\'t look like anyones going to design that gun  : )
    "Marooned" is one of those scenario\'s where you can really end up with a
great game or a totall flop, depending on how hard you want to work on it.
When I first ran it I really didin\'t do it any justice, I wish I had sat
down with the book and fleshed it out to the point where it was something
like 2300\'s "Aurore Sourcebook." If I had I\'d probably still have PCs on
Paglliachi. It\'d make a great PbEM when I think of it, but running one\'s
enough.

Subject: Gun Control - KNOCK IT OFF!


I have never had any problem discussing gun control or other
government stupidities.  I am very opinionated on the matter of
the Constitution of the United States, and I can argue my views
cogently and intelligently, without resorting to ad hominems.  I
do so regularly, both in my workplace and in conversations with
my father and my friends.

I had a perfect opportunity to do so here a few days ago.
However, this is the Traveller Mailing List, and gun control in
the United States of America is not the topic of the list
(although gun control on Ruie, Muan Gwi, Sylea, or Dlan might
very well be).  I therefore chose to send my response to the
poster privately.  We have since had an enlightening discussion
via private mail, in greater depth than would be convenient or
comfortable here.  I urge the members of this list who are
interested in pursuing this non-Traveller discussion to follow
suit.

Naturally, if a discussion on gun control or other government
stupidities in a Traveller environment were to start here, I
would, with great enthusiasm, contribute appropriate amounts of
gasoline, napalm, and other similarly appropriate substances,
with the intent of encouraging such discussion.  But only in a
Traveller context, please.

I trust I have made my point clearly and inoffensively.

I have just finished watching the movie \'Wild Geese", a mercenary 
movie set in late 60 early 70\'s Africa.  Has anyone done or heard of 
a Traveller adventure based on this movie.  I think it would make for 
a great  mercenary ticket adventure.  Any thoughts?

I think another good mercenary story is a book called the Crystal 
Mountain, does anybody know if this is the right name, because I 
would like to read it again.

December 22, 1999 and the Moon

Everyone should mark their calendars. It will be the Last Lunar Harrah
of the Millennium.

This year will be the first full moon to occur on the winter solstice,
December 22, commonly called the First Day of Winter, in 133 years.
Since the full moon on the winter solstice will occur in conjunction
with a lunar perigee, the point in the moon\'s orbit that is closest to
Earth, the moon will appear about 14 per cent larger than it does at
apogee, the point in its elliptical orbit that is farthest from the
Earth. The Earth is also several million miles closer to the sun than in
the summer, and sunlight striking the moon will be about 7 per cent
stronger making it brighter. Also, this will be the closest perigee of
the Moon of the year, since the moon\'s orbit is constantly deforming.

In layman\'s terms, it will be a super bright full moon, much more than
the usual AND it hasn\'t happened this way for 133 years. If the weather
is clear and there isn\'t a snow cover where you live, it is believed
that even car headlights will be superfluous.

Our ancestors 133 years ago saw this. Our descendants 100 or so years
from now will see this again.

Remember, this will happen December 22, 1999

Exactly, the radical cutback in mental health beds in Australia is the
real issue that the Human Rights guys are avoiding. No one in Australia is
as disadvantaged as the mentally ill, all they want is to be able to
function in the community not be thrown into it untreated.

<<<

The mental health cutbacks was a sensible idea gone mad.

About 10 years ago, the Richmond Report stated that many people in psycaratric
care could have been better treated in a community enviroment instead of being
withheld from the community (take 3 of the older Psyc hospitals in Sydney,
Gladesville, Parramatta (Cumberland) and Peat Island could have been used as
prisons, walls included).

Politicians took this as a godsend, and thus cut hevily into the mental health
budgets, forcing many people who should have been in institurtion care place
onto the streets with little support. It was sad to see people who had been
institutions for most of their adult life try to do things that we take for
granted, like telling the bus driver where they where going.

My father, a vetren of all aspects of NSW Health, considers the Richmand Reforms
needed, but went too far. It will proberbly swing back to mass institution care,
except no government in Australia wants to spend the money , especially NSW (not
with a black hole...um olympics comming)

ObTrav: The Psionic suppression is a classic example of a good idea going off
the rails.

Just a thought. http://members.aol.com/Traveller/T401-00.html
You could then buy robots no matter where you were, for $28 / 8, or about
$3.50 USD.

But then you would be playing CT and the world would begin to look more
colorful. People would smile more often. Strangers would come up to you and
offer bagels. (Bagel? What\'s a bagel?). You would quickly become late night

    The first step is to convince enough people that it\'s stupid
to throw away millions of dollars worth of hardware every time
you want to put someone or something into orbit.
    Nobody except comsat companies can make a profit because
existing expendable launch vehicles are too expensive. The
companies that build the expendables are large, slow-moving,
conservative corporate giants that depend on the military and
government space agencies for roughly half their business.    
Nobody will invest in the dozen or so small companies that are
developing reusable launch vehicles because the companies can\'t
guarantee a profit by next quarter.  The companies can\'t
guarantee a quick profit to investors or services to customers
because they don\'t have proven hardware.  They don\'t have proven
hardware because they can\'t raise money to build and test their
designs.

    Vilani conservatism is supposed to be even worse.

BTW, Danny, the way I read David Pulver\'s posting seems a little different from
how you read it. To me, he just said that the only way to have effective
gun-control is to follow the course he outlined.

He didn\'t say he believed this was a good idea.

The main point I believe he was saying is this: if someone advocates gun-control
without wanting to implement the far-reaching consequences, ignore them - they
are not really serious, just trying to pull in some votes!

Then again, that\'s politicians for you ("You can always tell when they\'re lying

Just took a look at the mailing list addresses on your site, and my
expectations were fulfilled - there\'s no-one on it within a couple of
thousand miles of me. At the moment I\'m working in the Arabian Gulf,
which tends to be a bit dry of  both Gamers and Science Fiction fans
(or at least, they keep quiet about it - remember what Heinlein said
about writing?)

Anyway, I\'ll step up to the bat and see if it prompts anyone else in
the area to do so. I\'m posting this bio to the TML as well.

Andy Long
Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates
andrewlong@hotmail.com

My name is Andrew, but from childhood (so many years ago), I\'ve been
called Andy. I\'m trying to change that, but in a fairly half-hearted
way. It doesn\'t seem to have much effect on people who\'ve known you
for half of your life.

I\'m forty(mumble), single, born British and was naturalised
Australian in 1989, when I was working in Brisbane. I\'ve worked in
Abu Dhabi for 14 of the past twenty years (four of the missing five
were spent in Oz), and I\'ve just left Sydney to come back here to
find work.

Systems I\'ve played (besides Traveller, that is):- Call of Cthulhu,
AD&D (1st edition), Runequest (2nd edition? not the AH version,
anyway), Twilight 2000, Paranoia, Pendragon. Systems that I\'ve owned
even if I haven\'t played them:- 2300AD, FASA  Star Trek, Chivalry and
Sorcery, Rolemaster, James Bond - the list goes on, and I\'ve dumped
some of them in packing my stuff to ship it to the UK.

I\'ve been a very intermittent gamer, having spent those 14 years
working here in Abu Dhabi, but I\'ve always been a Traveller player at
heart. These days all I get to do is roll up players and worlds, and
design ships and stuff, although there\'s nothing in my portfolio as
inspirational as some of the stuff I\'ve been seeing on the list. I\'m
more of a collector than a gamer, I suppose.

My favourite system is MT (yes, I know why it\'s called Megatypo),
although I\'ve always mixed in bits from other systems as I felt they
fitted. At one point I was using bits of the old SPI \'Universe\'
system to add detail to world generation, and my most recent project
was trying to merge the World Builders handbook, the World Tamers
handbook and the 2300AD world generation system. However, that came
to a grinding halt when I uprooted myself from Australia 7 weeks ago
and returned to the middle east. All my stuff is in transit to the
UK, and all I brought with me was the players & referees books and
the WBH.

I thought the rebellion setting was... interesting, and I liked the
\'everything is a task\' approach that it brought in. I thought that
TNE might be a better version of that system, but haven\'t really had
a chance to find out - and the setting turned me off at first.
Looking back at the last episodes of it, there was a chance to bring
virus-pcs into the game, which would have been interesting, if a bit
overpowering, but the early dungeon-crawls for loot just turned me
right off. Unfortunately, I had even less chance to play T4, although
I managed to collect most of the books.

I await the T5 system, although at this point my expectations are
low. At this point my preferred option is to use the MT system and
the GT setting. With the capture of Dulinor (you do all know that he
isn\'t REALLY dead, don\'t you?),  there\'s still a chance of large
scale conflict breaking out, but not on the
end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scale of the Rebellion. AI\'s are just
about ready to enter canon (that research station where the
transponder research is being carried out seems like a pretty good
candidate for an Amnesty Interstellar investigation, to me), which
will really shake things up, and we\'ve got Varian out there ready to
stir up trouble in the Marches

Well, that\'s me.

I now return you to your scheduled flame war.

regards, Andy^hrew

Great flick.  This was run as a Merc:2000 adventure years ago at the
Total Confusion con in Worcester, MA  (I got to play Richard Burton\'s
character).

Since I was the only one who had seen the movie, besides the GM,
I had to act surprised at certain plot points.

It was a lot of fun.

Of course, you would _have_ to use "Roland, the Headless Thompson
Gunner" as background music at some point in the scenario.

(On the subject of Warren Zevon and mercenary activities, there\'s also
"Lawyers, Guns, and Money", and ISTR that the title of "Werewolves of
London" is derived from the name of a bar/mercenary hiring hall.)

Well, so much for
"a country-wide set of restrictions, eliminate
all "grandfather clauses" allowing resale of existing weapons et al (use
buy-backs if necessary), enforce drug law level penalties for
non-complience (mandatory sentencing, like there is for crack cocaine)"

Which is pretty much the case in Japan.

And please leave the absurd handguns=nukes argument alone, or take to t.p.g 
to hear a few dozen reasons why it\'s absurd.

This is why Traveller PC\'s need that streetwise skill.  Even on high law 
level planets, dangerous weapons are smuggled in or made for those who care 
little about the law and are willing to pay.

Has anyone put their players in a "Enter the Dragon" type situation?  i.e. 
No firearms, no lasers.
Strict hand-to-hand and limited melee weapons?

hmmm...I guess most bar fights count.

I may be cynical here (my reason for looking at Christmas as a stolen
festival now days and not a Christian one), but I think that Tokyo store may
have it right.  Santa, not some supposed saviour being the symbol of
Christmas, being nailed to the religious icon of the cross, all to generate
HUGE profits from the rich and the poor equally, into the coffers of the
manufacturers and/or retailers (Currently in Australia, the price of a
common $10 toy varies in stores from $20 to $120 depending upon it\'s
popularity... I offer you the spirit of Christmas, it\'s not the thought that
counts, it\'s the cost).

Sorry folks, just a father of 4 venting on something that is vastly
different in my youth than it is now.

Except that in many cases, in the words of a copper friend of mine, "...when
we discover someone in possession of a nug (a M*A*S*H term for "gun" adopted
by my friends) that shouldn\'t have a nug , we know he\'s a scumbag
(criminal)..."  Many more successful prosecutions have resulted by finding a
rifle in the boot of a car for example, of someone that doesn\'t need one,
and further investigation had shown shady goings on.  It can make the black
and white of it seem less grey.

Also, in my old campaign, I had for colour, old Solomani novels by Wilber
Smith are believed to be military history while James Bond was obviously a
real man!  I also created 5 non-Solomani early history novelist as writing
fiction, but taken as fact.  Is this not a similar thing?  Names and dates
gel so the PC\'s were sometimes stumped by "history" that couldn\'t possibly
have happened... could it?

Yeah, we call it "mainstreaming" in a slightly different context. People
with special problems shouldn\'t be isolated from the community, and it is
more cost effective to place them with the rest of the public providing
care only as needed.  The concept is sound, but the implementation is
often less so.

destruction of the Imperium.  Things didn\'t move as fast as he wanted.  He
was sure that *he* could do better, and so the rest is history...in one

AFAIK, Mr. Seamans is a Yank, and was referring to the US system
in his paragraph excerpted above. In the Canadian system you can
still pay out serious bucks for non-insured services, extra or
non-conventional therapies, and many drugs, but the basic system
covers most of what you\'ll run into. Oh, and "serious bucks" in
this context likely isn\'t a fraction of what those in the US are
used to thinking of regarding uninsured medical costs...

Oh you have indeed.  Oddly enough, I didn\'t see many posts I\'d call a flame,
and therefore, feel that the actual discussion has helped me put in place
the various aspects of in-game Traveller world governments.  So as off-topic
it is, it was still informative on outlooks, and to me, relevant to the game
in some ways.

    Actually, it may have been the same in our youth but we didn\'t have to
pay for it. Good old "Father Christmas" (Eg. Parents) magically fulfilled
our little hopes that were instilled into our little heads in the ads

Well, they would, wouldn\'t they ?

Seeing as the US instigated the war, invaded Canada, got thrown out again,
and a Brit force then ravaged up and down the east coast unchecked, sacking
Washington twice, before finally being stopped at New Orleans after peace
had been declared, I\'d call it a loss for the US.

The only bright points for the US is that some of their ships did better
than anyone could have expected against the Royal Navy,  and the New York
Militia went home, citing that using militia to invade another country was a
gross abuse of the founding documents of the country, which it was.

Of course, they only did this after it became obvious they weren\'t going to
get much loot & pillage, but still...

What was that about a "well-regulated militia" ? <grin>

I\'m sure I read somewhere (can\'t for the life of me, think where?), that it
is current belief that sinister handedness is heading in the other
direction... that is that there is a natural flow towards left hand
dominance which (in theory) will see the majority of people in the future
left handed until us "righties" are the odd-ones-out!  Mind you, it was a
"waiting-in-the-doctor\'s-office-out-of-date-either-medical-or-woman\'s-magazi

I see what you are getting at Jim, I meant youth as opposed to childhood,
and I have vivid memories of gift shopping that is in no-way related to what
I see now... in fact, over the last 20 years it has gotten worse!  My eldest
is 20, so I guess I have really observed it in those years like never
before.

For example, in a local school (this is done every year on some current
affairs show somewhere), the question is asked of children what the meaning
of Christmas is... when I was a child, I knew the "Jesus and wise men shit,"
but now the answers are, "When Santa gives me what I want" or "It\'s the time
I get new toys" and the one that stuck out most to me, "It\'s when Dad said
he would buy me a box (as opposed to just a packet) of Pokomon cards."

I never recalled shopping for a gift and finding (even recently in the
scheme of things), TMNT\'s varying from one store to the next by as much as
$100!!!  It\'s a profit thing mate... it really IS different, and not just
the "inflation" difference or "it (an item) was much larger when I was
little" thing.

ObTrav:  Is there anything like Christmas in the whole of the Imperium?  I
assume there are world customs that may be close if not the same...

 Hmmm.. The Inupiaq have been successfully hunting Polar Bears with
30-06 for many years, and spears or bows before that.... It is not the
caliber but the ability to hit the bear at the right place. Another
native, a Brother in Law of mine, frequently hunts bears with a .357 mag
revolver. A friend who once went hunting Kodiak brown bears with a .458
Win Mag failed to stop one charging after placing 5 rounds in it. His
hunting partner literally dropped the beast at his feet with several
additional rounds from a .375 H&H. This guy was an experienced hunter,
of both wildlife and people (3 term Vietnam vet with 101st, tunnel rat,
etc...), but the first shot did not score the right hit. Makes you
wonder....  

But seriously, we are talking survival. IMHO if you crash land in a
polar region , I would rather expect that cold would the the most
pressing of your worries with shelter a close second. Carnivorous
beasties rank third or fourth with food and water. BTW, Polar bears are
notorious for hunting anything that moves on the ice, including man,
almost always from ambush.

    Don\'t quote me on this, but I have heard that the average male who is
out christmas shopping suffers stress equal in intensity to a fighter pilot

    Unfortunately, I suffer from a case of "Student" and the cash anaemia
that is a side effect of that dread disease. I\'m looking at five years of
poverty and a $29,000 bill at the end [curls into foetal ball]. Thats why I

    I have oodles of CT, I prefer MT. I like the Rebellion, you can ignore
it or participate as you wish. A friend bought T4 and the erratta almost
made me homesick for MT (Thanks Micheal!) The only one I don\'t like is TNE
but thats only because of the combat rules, I think a Cyberpunk 2020
conversion for the combat would be great but I\'m not buying more than two
editions of any game, it only encourages \'em.

    The survival kit sets you up well for Polar survival, if your playing
Marooned Alone your wearing a Vacc Suit to start with. My idea for the gun
was what a government department may supply for a survival weapon that the
scouts promptly use for their own purposes, eg. shooting boarders with 18mm
HE "Lockpicking" rounds. I assume it\'s easier to hide illegal ammo than an
illegal weapon on an x-boat!
    Question: The scenario lists the Survival kit as "the Imperial
Standard." Does this mean it\'s canon? Are you allowed to post it\'s contents
on your website?

Y\'see, for a while there,  our native peoples were agitating for their
rights to ancestral lands, the pink triangle activists were out in force,
and Greenpeace was trying to save the whales.

So the more reactionary of us went out got some tee-shirts printed saying
"Land Rights for Gay Whales" with an appropriate picture of very camp
beached whale.

It\'s amazing how many people thought we were serious....

Hah !

That remins me of a "special mission" I got sent on when in the RNZAF.

Remember when "Colonel" Rambuka took over Fiji ?

Well, there was a possibility our RRF (Ready Reaction Force) based at Linton
would be activated to retore the legal government of Fiji. But the RRF
didn\'t have enough rifles because they were being used by a Territorial
excercies near the Marlborough sounds, so we scrambled an Iroquois to fly
from Christchurch and bring back some rifles to Linton, so they couild be
ready to go.

Of course, because it was needed in a hurry, they had to use the SAR chopper
so the South Island didn\'t have SAR coverage while we went and got the
rifles.

Please, children (a term I use advisedly, as I remeber seeing Woodstiock on
the evening news), this is a PG13 list and while I\'d dearly like to discuss
the use of grav plates in suspension techniques, doing so might cause moral
umbrage. Or something.

Given the context of the rest of this thread, the use of the word "tab"
might not be the best.

Apparently this book was based on his experiences in Biafra. I\'m 
currently reading a book called _The New Mercenaries_ by Anthony 
Mockler. It\'s about the modern mercenaries in the Congo, etc, and there 
are a number of situations in it that would make for interesting Trav 
scenarios.

IIRC until this war the US Federal government had no army, nor the 
right to raise one. They relied on state militas, and the eastern 
seaboard states (who had good militas) weren\'t interested in what was 
basically just the (north) western states trying a land grab.

The 1812 war is a wonderful example of why amateurs shouldn\'t be 
allowed to command armies, and why military appointments shouldn\'t be 
made for political reasons.

I would suggest that the fact that you\'re searching the boot of 
someone\'s car means that there\'s a good chance he\'s a scumbag, gun or 
no gun. Assuming that a copper has to show due cause to search a car 
where you are, that is.

I got hold of BL before FFS and found it (BL) to be quite hard to 
follow. When I finally got FFS I was very pleased to find it much 
easier to use. I found having each component in its own chapter very 
useful, as I could do things in any order I liked. However the page 
flipping is a little annoying.

I dunno. The US Federal Government came out alright - they gained the 
power to raise troops. Otherwise it was a draw, in that the peace 
treaty set everything back to pre-war borders, etc. However the indians 
lost fairly heavily (nothing new there).

That\'s why I was advocating a .338 (at least) - it was for defense, not 
hunting. When arming yourself for defense you\'re generally going to 
want somthing a bit bigger than you\'d use to hunt the same thing with. 
When hunting you get to choose the shot, when being hunted they do.

All too well. I was in basic training at the time, and if Lange had 
actually lost his mind we\'d have been in right after the RRF. Given the 
relative size of our RRF (plus the rest) and the Fijian army we were 
rather happy when nothing eventuated.

I\'ve had the PCs making a run for it from a hotel near a starport,
having members of a local gang chasing them. The laws of the area
stopped them from bringing their weapons to the hotel, so they had no
guns with them. Very entertaining action scene, since the players had to
think in order to succeed.

        The Battle of Montreal pretty much under-lines that the US forces
were poorly trained and led by inexperienced officers.

Here in Norway a popular t-shirt reads "Intelligent people, need intelligent
food. Kill the whales\'. It is accompanied by a viking standing atop a dead
whale. My cousine wore this t-shirt while attending UCSB and got into trouble
more than once.

As you may or may not know, Norway is still hunting whales.

        Hi, Jens!

        I count the odds of persecution for killing someone (legality of
action to be debated in court) as (Law Level + 1) x2 on 2d.  It takes Law
Level dice in weeks to get a trial, with a chance equivalent to law level on
2d that you\'ll be in house arrest or worse until the trial.

        My players would generally *rather* use brawling and a set of
nuchaku or a tonfa to put someone down rather than a handgun....  You can
stop damaging them far more easily and are less likely to kill someone on "a
really good roll" with one hit.  Fewer things screw up the odds of making
the bank payments faster than getting placed in jail for 54 weeks while
awaiting trial so that you don\'t skip the planet.

Thank you Ken, www.permanent.com is an excellent web
site for Real Life(tm) asteroid mining information.  Would
whoever else posted in response to my query please
repost that URL with the more RPGable stuff?  I seem to

        Hi, Jason!
        I think that might have been me.  URL is in my .SIG....  Pick the
[House Rules] button, and its at the bottom of the page.  Let me know what
you think.  I have done a couple of play-tests with it and it seems to  work
fairly well from both "pay the bills" and actually role-playing
opportunities perspectives.  Let me know what you think.

True we didn\'t suceed at the land grab. And we lost all
of the battles except the last one (the battle of New
Orleans - fought 2 weeks after the peace treaty was
signed.) But we got two very important concessions
from the Brits: 1) The british agreed to stop press ganging
american sailors into the royal navy, and 2) The British
stopped supporting the Indian tribes to the west of the
US ( a significant concession in terms of US expansion.)

I supose you could say, in modern terms, the US lost the
war but won the peace.

Ob Trav - What are the different interpretations of the
Frontier wars in history texts from the various polities
involved? Do historians in the Spinward Marches hold
different opinons of the causes and results than
historians from Core? Same Questions for the Solomani
Rim war and the Pacification Campaigns.

It happens occasionally. On Zila, in the Traveller Adventure, for example.
We were so intimidated by the Law level that we didn\'t even try to get a
body pistol through. Other high-law worlds and the occasional no-guns
Highport.

And of course (plug alert!) the action in The Khiidkar Incident takes place
almost entirely in the absence of firearms.

It\'s fun sometimes when the gun-nut realises that he doesn\'t have Brawling
and is finally in a fight where HE\'s the wimpoid. Or when someone pulls a
body pistol and everyone drools enviously.....

Dunno about the Canadian side, but I would be surprised if there wasn\'t a

taken over by some hideously hostile enemy. And, of course, there is "Plan

Not that I know of -- beyond the provisions for territories becoming states, 
but that\'s in the constitution.

I suspect that there are some folks who notice such
differences more easily than others.  Until recently, I have
not been around many asians, yet with my limited
experience (TV mostly), I can usually distinguish between
Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Viet Namese, and Other
Orientals.  I can also distinguish between many different
"Native" American groups.  I get most of them right (or
very close - tribal afinity wise).  I can even usually tell the
difference in an Englishman, a Scott, an Irishman and a
German.

I suspect that this ability is part of the general pattern
recognition ability that some folks have and others don\'t.
I see patterns in almost everything.

America was a half-hearted battle between two forces that weren\'t really
all that interested.  The British had to pull some of their forces out to
fight Napoleon, some Americans saw the chance to grab some under-defended
English territory, there were some nasty skirmishes and then the British
came back and retaliated.  The initial American thrust was never really
pushed through or they could have done a lot more damage.  Once again it
was a lack of political will that was the determinant.  Likewise, the
British counter-attack wasn\'t exactly carried through to the fullest or
they could have really hurt the states.  

The part I can\'t understand was that with the British closing on
Washington, the minister of war just kept saying to the president of the
time that "they\'ll never go for the Capital".  He had no reason for this
assertion, and the president didn\'t push him on it.  When the British got
there, no one tried to stop them.  IIRC, they went up to another American
city, there met some serious resistance, and therefore decided to call it
off. (All from memory, feel free to correct)

Having said that, I think the Canadian/British side clearly won, having
sacked the capital and all.  I just don\'t see it as a particularly
glorious moment in our military history (assuming there can be glory in
war at all), as we were basically allowed to walk in.  Mind you, folks in
Halifax see it differently.  They seem quite proud that the local
university was founded with money looted from the US in that war, and that
the local government house is the longest standing leader\'s residence in
NA because "the White House would have been, but we burned it down in
1812." (nearly direct quote from Halifax tourist web-site). Silliness,
IMHO.

Okay, enough of this OT stuff.  Here\'s an ObTrav:  Are there any small
border states of the Imperium that have a similar history with them?  Is
there a moderately long-lasting Vargr band that once sacked Regina long
ago and still hails itself as the only ones to "successfully invade the
Marches"?  Or better yet, in the early history of the Imperium, did anyone
take what is now Capital, and holds that as a proud moment in their
military history?

If that were true, then we here in the US would be part of Canada now.  This 
is one of real life\'s examples of how real war is not like "Axis & Allies".  
Sacking the capitol does not mean you won the war.  Both sides were not 
disinterested as you suggest, it was more like both were unprepared.  America 
was a fledgling nation, not ready physically or financially to fight another 
war and it had incompetant people sprinkled through the government.  The 
british wanted a real war but had over strung themselves.  

Lack of political will had nothing to do with it, nor was it an american 
chance to grab british territory.  The brits started with the invasion and 
then realized that Napoleon was going to be a tougher enemy than anticipated. 
 They could not fight two major wars and so they chose to take on the closer 
enemy.  The yanks saw the brit drawel and said fine, we\'ll follow up to 
prevent future invasions.

This is off topic so I\'ll have to add, the brits used Vargr units during 
their sacking of Washington.  The yanks responded by forming a treaty with 
the Yrggyyyagsytelo Aslan clan.  ;-)

As has been stated before, the US definitely lost the 1812 war.  

The British burned the White House and the Capitol.  

We, unfortunately, rebuilt them.

After two wars, the score is tied at:
US: 1
UK: 1

This scenario brings back memories.

One of the scenarios we designed and ran during T4\'s day for 
GenCon \'97 was an updated version of Marooned.  I came up with a 
bit of a new spin on the scenario that made it a lot more fun.  

During the opening minutes of the scenario, after the ship has been 
fatally damaged, but before the characters make good their 
escape, we had several random rolls on a set of "Scrounged 
Equipment Tables".  These would be things that maybe people 
hurriedly grabbed out of their cabins, looted from other cabins or 
elsewhere on the ship, etc.  As a natural extension of this, we put 
a whole lot less survival gear on the lifeboat itself...

Because of the random nature of this, players would often wind up 
with unusual equipment (a shotgun, but no ammo...lots of water, 
no food, etc.).  Incidentally, we recorded the roll results secretly 
with the individual players, so none of the PCs knew what the 
others had...and since this was a convention setting, not too many 
of the players knew each other either...it was a great way to break 
the ice as the PCs spent the first few minutes trying to figure out 
what they had as a group...

Are you implying Britain invaded the US first during the war of 1812?
Do they even *teach* Americans history these days?

A quick outline would be
(0) Britain is conscripting british (and occasional American) soliders out
of British ships. America doesn\'t like this. Also, Britain is blocking
American trade with France (more legitimately). And there are all these
nice Canadian colonies sitting there apparently undefended...
Negotiations on the shipping stuff actual reached a compromise, but
too late, so
(1) Therefore, the US starts the war, invading Canada, expecting an
easy victory
(2) To the US\' surprise, they get their tails kicked
(3) The US wins some surpring victories in one-on-one engagements
at sea, although
(4) Britain decisively blockades US ports
(5) Once the penninsular war is over, Britain takes a bunch of veteran
troops and invades and burns Washington, but doesn\'t attempt to hold
it (which they probably couldn\'t have done)
(6) Instead, Britain invades in the south, heading for New Orleans
(7) Peace is negotiated
(8) Since the commanders haven\'t heard about the peace, British and
US soliders fight at New Orleans; the US wins the battle.

"Draw" is a good description. America got its maratime rights respected
and a lot of prestige from some otherwise-unimportant naval actions;
Britain got to burn washington and didn\'t lose Canada, but did lose the last
major land battle of the war.

It is actually somewhat Traveller relevant in that it was a war dominated by
communication delays - if news of negotiations had reached Washington
in time war might not have been declared, and of course the last
battle was fought after the war was technically over.

Well, I suppose it gets down to what you consider "victory".  Germany
didn\'t become part of any other nation after WW2.  You could define
victory as who caused the most damage to the enemy, in which case Canada
comes out on top in this one. If you define it as "who took over who",
then it\'s a draw.

Well, different accounts are bound to have different biases, but in the
ones that I\'ve seen the US side asked for and was refused additional
troops.  This may have been for financial reasons as you suggest, but
financial considerations are always balanced with political ones. If a
take-over of Canada had been sufficiently "popular" or politically
advantageous, more resources would have been put into the effort.

Back to Traveller, one should remember that not all scenarios have mutually
exclusive winners and losers.
Perhaps better stated as not all scenarios are zero sum.

well, to put a _bit_ of a damper on it...while the moon _will_ be
brighter (approx 25%), it would have to practically double in brightness
ot be really noticeable to most people (especially in bright urban
environments), and the astronomer who wrote the article in the paper
today was really asking pretty please not to believe that bit about

(OTOH, in the boonies, with cool dry air, even a normal full moon is
enough to drive on, particularly if you let your eyes adapt for a
while.)

Shelter is generally easy. At least for a temporary shelter that\'ll cut
the wind and help you retain a lot of body heat. Build a snow cave.
Later, work on an igloo if you\'ve got the right sort of snow handy.

What would be *really* bad is landing in one of Antarctica\'s "dry
valleys". There\'s nothing but bare ground. And fairly hard packed since
over the centuries, wind has blown away anything loose. So it\'s basicly
bare rock and hardpan. Building a shelter is going to be tough. So is
finding water since it hasn\'t rained or snowed in these areas for
hundreds or *thousands* of years. Polar desert... *not* a fun terrain
type. 


> Carnivorous beasties rank third or fourth with food and water.

Water is fairly simple, again outside of those %%^^$# valleys. You just
melt snow.But be careful *how* you melt it. 

Food is the real problem. There\'s damn little living up there in the
winter. And if you aren\'t near the ocean, make that *nothing*.

At least they aren\'t a problem in Antartica. :-)

I have to disagree that the US *started* the war. I lay the blame for
*that* squarely at the feet of the Briish Royal Navy and its treatment
of US vessels. Given the way they were acting, we didn\'t have a lot of
choice if we wished to remain independent and be considered anything
other than an odd sort of British colony.

You forgot the "Pig War" in the San Juan Islands about 30 years later.
But that one wasn\'t very big and can be called a draw. 

It also has a lesson. When garrisoning a disputed group of islands, the
disputants should *not* put their garrisons at opposite ends of the
*same* island!

There may be a region with that name, but it won\'t be *significant*.
1100 Imperial is something like AD 4700, right? That\'s 2700 years in
the future. For comparison, compare the nations that existed in 700 BC
with the ones that occupy the same territory now. That\'s what\'s going
to happen.

The states *used* to be more important than the federal government.
Practically nations in their own right (which is why they were called
"states"). That changed in only 100 years. 

After nearly 3000, things are going to be a lot different.

***TAS PRESS RELEASE***
Capital/Core, 15-1113.  Lord Judge A. von Ambulator
today granted class certification in Roughkrugzhi v.
Ling Standard Products, allowing the case to move
forward on behalf of all persons injured by defects in
the design of the Ling Standard Products LSP-1000z
air/rafts.  

Roughkrugzhi v. Ling Standard Products is an
Imperium-wide class action brought in the Imperial
Judicial Court at Capital.  Plaintiffs allege that
defects in the design on the LSP-1000z, the civilian
version of the military gravsled manufactured by Ling,
are unreasonably dangerous and have caused "an
uncounted number of deaths, dismemberments, and
disfigurements."  Plaintiffs seek an unspecified
amount of damages, recall of all LSP-1000z air/rafts
for repair, an injunction against further sale of the
LSP-1000z until the alleged defects are, and an award
of attorneys\' fees.

The alleged defects include a grav governor that can
easily be overriden by acceleration such that the
vehicle can go into a dive beyond the ability of the
gravitics to recover, which has led to a number of
crashes.  In addition, the open-topped air/raft
allegedly tends to roll over easily at high speeds,
which has caused many passengers to fall out.  

The plaintiff, Pragra Roughkrugzhi, a vargr from
Jesedipere/Spinward Marches, is not related to Col. Ve
Roughkrugzhi, the celebrated former Kforuzeng corsair
who joined Imperial forces during the Fifth Frontier
War and used her personal knowledge of Kforuzeng
defenses to lead a series of daring commando raids on
vargr bases in advance of Admiral Elphinstone\'s
counterattack late in the war.  

(Col. Roughkrugzhi was officially reported killed in
the crash of an LSP-1000z air/raft in 1112 while on
leave on Regina/Regina, but her body was not been
recovered.)

The first step to humanity being permanently in space is convincing enough people that its worth spending the money to be permanently in space.  There\'s no shortage of people who think a fully-reusable lifter wouldn\'t be very useful, the problem is that the number of working prototypes is currently zero, and based on the history of the industry, the odds of any one of various reusable booster schemes currently being proposed actually working as advertised is quite low.  Spending several years and hundreds of millions of dollars on something which has maybe a 20% chance of working is not the sort of thing that excites corporate sponsors....

Actually, the problem is that they can\'t guarantee a profit _ever_, and certainly aren\'t going to generate a profit in the next five years.

Pagan is such a crude word and in this context it lumps the Persian Mithras
cult and European folk traditions in together, when they really have nothing
to do with each other. There is no real correct pagan version, and the
Christian version, for what it\'s worth is equally correct.

Even so, in my own Traveller Universe, at least among the "jump set" (yeah,
that\'s like jet set) and others who have been integrated into the Imperial
calender Holiday is very much a gift-giving holiday not too far off of
Christmas.

Although I may integrate some ideas from the Christmas episode of Futurama
into my Traveller Universe! ;)

Oh, I\'d love to see a source for that. It would
support my decision to opt out of the holiday scene
very well.  (Last year I went to Thailand; maybe next
year I\'ll go to Iran.)

Nope. Not up here. :) Oh, wait - I thought you said

Huh. I never knew that the War of 1812 was the inspiration for 
the plot in \'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace".

I don\'t think I\'ll be able to join you, but I may stop
by after a dinner meeting and see if you\'re still
there.  I\'ll be wearing a blue overcoat, yellow/brown
sport jacket, black jeans -- and, if I have it with
me, a black beret with a bronze garuda insignia. 
(Otherwise, look for a male caucasian, 6\', 175#, blue
eyes, hair and beard dark brown with a lot of gray.)  

Anyway, further to my off-list email to Evan, I\'m
generally available for one session a month, and
location is not too much of an issue.

D\'oh!

I completely forgot that I am not going to be checking my @home.com email 
account while I am away for the next week.  If for some reason anyone needs 
to contact me, please send it to reverendkeith@hotmail.com.

I guess my New Years resolution will be to catch up with the TML digest

well. :(

I\'m female, but I hate it too.  Last year I went to Japan.  I wish I were
there right now.  (H-chama and I are having a very difficult time and I
have NO holiday feeling whatsoever... and I really dislike many aspects of
Christmas-- which I think I\'d hate more if I WERE Christian.)

:(  Does it have to be so late?  I work at UCSF and I really don\'t want to
go all the way home on Muni and then come back out in the same direction.
If I join you will someone drop me off home in the Mission? 

I would love to meet you guys and I will try to be there but I can\'t
promise...  What have they got to drink other than Guinness?  (I am half
Irish but don\'t seem to have gotten the beer genes from that side of my
ancestry.)

I\'m developing Terra (era 1120 in the G:T timeline) for SJG.  Right now I\'m
thinking that virtually *none* of the nation-states of the late 20th Century
still exist in any significant form in the Third Imperium era.

I mean, think about it. . .how many nation-states of about 1650 BC still
exist today?  Ignoring the question of whether there *were* any nation-
states in the modern sense that far back, you get maybe two: Egypt and
China.

Sorry, guys; I have been replying off-list so far, but this is too much.
Yes, the initial thrust into Canada by militia and jumped-up colonels who 
were shopkeepers the day before were pushed back. HOWEVER, America also 
captured and destroyed the British base in York (Canada, not England), 
captured Ft. George, and won the lake battles on Erie (making Erie, in many 
ways, an \'American\' lake for many years) and Champlain. Also, *regular* 
American forces drove General Proctor into Canada, where they pursued his 
forces, caught them, and destroyed them. And, unlike an earlier post, the 
British were stopped at Ft. Meig, Ft. Stephenson, Sackett\'s Harbor and 
Baltimore (where my great-etc. grandfather was a captain in the regular 
army). So the statements that \'America only won a single battle\' and \'the 
British army marauded up and down the East Coast unopposed\' are simply 
wrong. There was a great deal of traded land, bad decisions, and weird 
coincidences on all sides.
And, again unlike an earlier post, the American navy did not have a limited 
impact. The new American frigates inflicted so much damage that the British 
navy was under orders to flee unless the American ships were outnumbered. 
there were three occasions when American ships destroyed three british ships 
in one day and a single American ship captured 10 British ships in one 
month. That\'s pretty impressive.
So, while the U.S. lost Buffalo, Detroit and Niagara, they also captured a 
fair amount of territory around Erie; more importantly, they proved that 
American regulars could meet and beat the British regulars and that American 
ships and crews could beat British ships and crews. While the U.S. had 
suffered some early losses and embarrassing defeats, they certainly had the 
initiative, especially at sea. This may explain why the British were willing 
to return their strategic gains - if they were winning, why do that?

Doubtfull, as in canon, we have several intervening steps. By IY 1050,
Terra is a captured and occupied world, under the thumb of the Imperial
Marines. (See Supp 10.

The IM are quite likely to create geographic regions for cantonment that
are NOT congruent with priot political boundaries; this allows you to blame
internal violence upon purges by the "Locals from across the old border".
Also, said cantonments are likely also to be set up for the convinience of
the IMC, not the redidents.

Likewise, the Solomani confederation arises (Like the phoenix) out of the
ashes of the Terran Confederation. The 3I had recaptured the terran sphere,
including earth, following the long night. More than likely, the "States of
Terra" are NorAm, SoAm, NorAf, SoAf, Euro, Slavia, Orient, Oz, and Arabia,
at least by the time the Vilani occupation resolves into imperial
membership; in the 600\'s, IIRC, the Solomani Sphere gains internal Autonomy.

As far as ethnicity goes, I think it likely that Terrans will still be
predominantly ethnic in the orient, slavia, africa and arabia.... (Slavia
refers to Russia, the baltics, Eastern Poland, the Ukraine, the Balkans,
and their cultural dependancies. Western Europe, asuming the EU evolves
into a super-gov\'t, will result in its members becoming more alike, along
with making cultural enclaves more common throughout.

Well, there _was_ the minor problem that the British Navy was also
stopping and searching US-flagged merchants, and pretty much impressing
anyone they felt like.

Your classified secton looks great, but you\'re right it\'s a little dated. 
Something like what you have there is a great service to folks looking for

	Kiri, you don\'t drive? Neither does my wife. Make some decisions about
where to go and how to get there very easy.

	ObTrav: how common are the public transport networks, and how costly to
use?

Well, if I get the (smallish) apartment I\'m looking at (near Market on

I take it this means you are anti-Fed?

(sorry, that was tongue-in-cheek after reading your views on the gun thread!)

This is a perfect example of Imperial attitudes prior to the Rebellion. Each
little portion of the Imperium had an undercurrent of dislike for the central
government, even though - in the Imperium\'s case - it kept the peace and kept
out of local politics.

When a serious challenge arose to the legitimacy of the Throne, each little
"state" found reasons to go their own way. After all, what has the central
government ever done for us? I mean, it only gave us a focus, gave us unity,
protected us from our surrounding enemies by presenting a unified fighting
force, gee, is that all, what else?

I actually have an electronic singing Purin (Jigglypuff in America) that
plays the song.  It plays for a specified number of minutes so that you
can go to sleep hearing it and I use it for a timer.

	I *believe* you\'re thinking of "The Dogs of War," by Frederick
Forsythe, which IIRC features a mountain called Crystal Mountain as
the "pull" of the story. Either way, it\'s a good mercenary book (in
both meanings).

I agree, but I think that it\'s for different reasons.

That\'s a really tough question to ignore. There are fundamental differences
between the nation-states of 1650 BC and the nation-states of today.

I personally think that the current trend of increasingly fractured
nation-states and the rise of "borderless" identification groups will
continue. In addition, I think that economic polities will be the route of
the future, or at least the near future.

I must add the disclaimer that I don\'t think that those trends are a good
thing, it just happens to look like the way things are going.

troops, Ben Franklin came and attempted to convince the population to join
in the rebellion against the King.  It was felt on the US side that the
fact that the population was french and catholic would be easier to
convince to rebel against the english king.  THe Church was extremely
powerful in lower Canada (now Quebec) and the Catholic Church had a very
good relationship with the English government.  There was very little trust
of the americans.  THe Church convinced the local canadians to refuse to
support the americans.

Later, the americans were defeated before Quebec City (I think they were
led by that great Patriot: Benedict Arnold ;-)).

It is also interesting to note that there was a lot of moral support for
the rebellion in Nova Scotia.  It is only a later landing of troops by the
British that stopped the province from becoming one of the rebel colonies
(14 stars anyone?).  Nova Scotia, after Canada was created, was the
location of the first separatist movement in Canada.  It has since died,
but it existed at some point.

One question to my US friends, it has to do with Benedict Arnold.  I seem
to recall reading somewhere that when the US government issued a stamp
using a famous painting on it, they "brushed out" Benedict Arnold, who was
in the original painting.

That was the *height* of the Assyrian Empire IIRC.

The Minoan Empire is a possibilty, but I think the eruption of Thera
wiped them out centuries earlier.

The Phoenicians might be around. 

Other "countries" to consider are things like the Anasazi in the
Southwest, the folks who built Ankor Wat in Cambodia, etc.

"Imperial Forces made another stride towards victory today with the capture
of the San Francisco Valley region.  The picturesque area, famous for its
mountainous original settlement called "the old 47" by locals, was taken in
a determined series of attacks by the rebuilt 85th Grav Tank Army.

Troops of the 3412th Lift Infantry Brigade have set up defensive screens to
the east of the Oaktown Highlands.  Local reaction is muted, except in the
eastern parts of the area where troops have been trouble by raiders.

Solomani troops are dug in around the base of Mt. Farallon, but are

The previous is probably meaningless to the non-SFers, but it is a nice
lead in for an article in today\'s Chronicle.  Evidently, the Bay is a
transitory feature.  In fact, it\'s an aberration!

Makes you wonder what else will have changed by the time of Traveller...

Wilbur and Orville had similar problems a century ago. Even
supposing you did invent a machine that could fly, what use would
it possibly be? The number of working prototypes was zero, the
history of the industry was even more dismal than the aerospace
industry is now, and ISTR they got the same kind of reactions

What existing reusables? The four shuttle orbiters? The main fuel
tank is still a multimillion dollar throwaway, the boosters have
to be recovered from somewhere downrange and rebuilt, and the
engines have to be stripped and rebuilt after every flight. It\'s
little wonder current expendables are cheaper.  Then, too, nearly
the whole US space program and not just a comsat is riding on
each flight, so this kludge has to be made as safe to fly as
human effort can make it. By the time you count that expense in,
cheaper expendables are no wonder at all.

Guaranteeing any profit, let alone a quick one, is more than they
ought to do, and both companies and investors should know it.
Pioneering new technology is inherently risky. Investors
overestimating the risks and underestimating the potential return
appears to be the real problem.

Nope.  I don\'t think you can equate the Harappan culture with modern
India or any other nation-state of today.  Of course, the continuity between
Middle Kingdom Egypt and present-day Egypt, or between Shang Dynasty
China and present-day China, is pretty tenuous too.  Which is my point
anyway :-).

However, the startup costs were dramatically lower (which _does_ matter).  Note that I never said that commercialized space travel was impossible, just that it isn\'t particularly surprising that no company has decided to throw money at the problem.

Hm...actually, that\'s unclear.  The problem may be inventors underestimating the risks (I don\'t think they\'re overestimating the return; I just suspect they\'re being rather optimistic in their estimates of the capability of whatever technology they\'re hawking).  This problem is endemic in the space industry; the shuttle was _supposed_ to be exactly what you describe, it just turned out that the technology of the time was not up to the task of building a fully reusable SSTO.

My basic argument here is that you seem to believe that cheap space travel is easy, with just a little bit of research, and that if corporations/nasa/ whatever would just recognize this, the problem would be solved.  I claim that cheap space travel is a fundamentally hard problem, which will require application of large amounts of time, money, and research.  In addition, while I am not awed by NASAs performance, I haven\'t exactly been impressed by most of its competition either.

Point is, *none* of those cultures have lasted with any degree of continuity
to the present day.  Nor will today\'s nation-states last 3,500 years into
any reasonably-imaginable future.

Of course, almost everything in Traveller is unreasonably stable (the Zhodani culture has been stable for how long?  A hundred thousand years or so?) so it isn\'t entirely unreasonable within the Traveller context to have recognizeable remnants.

OTOH, M:1100 regimes might enhance their legitimacy by tracing their
lineage back to the "glory days" of whatever ancient peoples ruled the
area.  A current example of this is Maddas Hinsein in Iraq, claiming to
be the rightful successor regime to the ancient Babylonians.

Of course, "there will _always_ be an England."  ;-)

IMHO, Japan and England (though not necessarily the UK) would be among
the more likely current nation-states to maintain some sort of national
identity, even in M:1100.  This is because they are both island nations,
with relatively long senses of national identity.  Japan traces its
identity back 2649 years (October, AD 1940 was the 2600th year of the
Japanese Empire, according to Dan van der Vat\'s book _The Pacific
Campaign: The U.S.-Japanese Naval War 1941-1945_.)  England, meanwhile,
has not been invaded and conquered since AD 1066, nearly 1000 years ago.

definition of victory as "making the enemy do your
will," a sensible government will have a set of goals,
presumably some more important than others. Since the
USA invaded Canada, Canada\'s goal was simple: survive
as a nation. That is a greater victory than avoiding
having your citizens press-ganged into someone else\'s
navy, isn\'t it? So both sides achieved their
objectives, both sides won; but Canada\'s victory was
the greater, since it was a more important issue,
surely.

A similar example is Vietnam; the North\'s goal was to
unite Vietnam under a communist government, the USA\'s
goal was to keep the south non-communist. In that
sense, the commies won... but twenty years later
Vietnam turned around and wanted trade with the
western world, blocked by the USA, and was forced to
introduce market reforms... so now the USA has won.

I\'ll leave the ObTravs to those more knowledgeable
about Trav history! I\'m usre not all victories there
are clear cut and decisive...

That\'s correct and was what I meant, even if I didn\'t express it properly.
The point was that finding said weapon added greatly to the chance of a
successful prosecution because the police knew the scumbag had an illegal
weapon, and the jury had an inkling that the "defendant" couldn\'t be all
that honest if he had an illegal weapon.

In light of the above if you are in that situation and you slay the polar
bear rather than the converse be advised not to eat its liver.   That is the
one, albeit practically useless tidbit, I gleaned many years ago from the US

CATN Rules: CT with some MT grafted onto it.  Mebbe in the process of 
converting it to TNE (the more I study those rules the better I like \'em, 
*EXCEPT* for combat!!!).  Some house rules.

CATN Canonocity: Variable.  Setting is Reavers\' Deep, outside of the 
Imperium, during the Rebellion.  Soem things happened differently...  <grin>

Thinking about things like this gives one a little
perspective on the Zhodani Consulate being constantly
in being for 8,000 or so years, or the Ziru Sirka
maintaining one civilization and government for
10,000+ years.  No wonder they called it the
Ramshackle Empire.

I\'ve got a character who\'s a lapsed member of the Solomani Catholic Church whose patron saint is St Elvis.  Still has his medal, still wears it.  But he hasn\'t sang \'Blue Swede Shoes\' in over 20 years.  His name?  Romli Issak Elvis Hamlin.

Well, they say that at least in some neighborhoods of
Glisten, the most likely reason a cop is searching the
boot of a grav speeder is the combination of (1) the
driver is a vargr, (2) the grav speeder is too new or
expensive or both, and/or (3) it\'s not a vargr
neighborhood.  I\'m not saying it happens, or that it
happens here, but I\'ve heard it could happen on
Glisten.  Or Jesedipere.  Or Mora.  Or Regina.  Or
Jewell.  Or even Efate.

It depends on the standards for prosecution and
conviction.  Can one be convicted of being a bad
person, or should one only be subject to conviction
for violating a specific law?  It depends on where you
are.

Just consider that given the faults all thru California, and the 3000+
year timescale, expect that anything west of the main fault lines could
be as much as a few *miles* north of where it is now.

It *was* up to it. It\'s just that Congress declined to fund it *and*
forced NASA to build a much bigger orbiter than they wanted to. The
huge size is because they has to commit to being able to boost things
like the KH series satellites to keep the funding. Then the military
turned around and dropped their interest in using the shuttle for most
missions anyway. 

If it hadn\'t been for the military satellite launch requirements, the
Shuttle cargo by would be anywhere from 2/3rd to 1/2 the size it
currently is, and the rest of the shuttle would be smaller too.

No, we claim that it\'s nowhere near as hard as NASA makes it look. And
that designing more robust launchers will lower costs *drastricly* even
if they have lower payload fractions. What makes Shuttle flights so
expensive *isn\'t* the cost of the fuel! And it isn\'t even the cost of
the vehicle or the parts that need replacing after every flight. It\'s
the salaries of the *huge* number of people involved in the process.

Which is what was said about space flight *in general* years back.

Keep in mind that many design that deserved to at least get tested has
been shot down when would be investors asked NASA about it. Naturally
they were told the idea was worthless. This isn\'t even necessarily
deliberate bias, just the *natural* tendency to think "if it was a good
idea, we\'d be using it".

That *was* my point. The post I was responding to read as if Egypt,
China, and India were the *only* "countries" around back then. 

And besides *listing* all these *dead* "nations" helps get the idea
across.

Except that Canada was 50 or so years away from being a nation.  Canada,
as such, had _no_ victory, since there was no nation-state of Canada to
win or lose a war.

Napoleonic Wars in reverse (the "coalition" in the FFW was forced to
settle for the status quo ante bellum, while the various coalitions
finally defeated Napoleon).

Of course, the Outworld Coalition has not yet conceded final defeat....

I\'ll have to check that one out (since I work at a med school, I\'m sure I
can get my hands on a copy).  I wonder if I am technically nuts?  Does ADD
count as nuts?  Because I definitely have that.

Even so, since the original post was referring to things that I might do to

is still not playing sane.  =)

Well at least this is more fun than filling out nengajo (New Year\'s cards...
one Japanese tradition that makes so much sense... no one is EVER offended
by being wished a Happy New Year... not even the staunchest atheist, nor the
most orthodox Jew, nor the most fanatical fundamentalist Christian or
Muslim, nor the most incredibly out there Wiccan!  Although my Chinese
friends so often remind me that we have jumped the gun by about 2 months.
Phbbft.)

The British could *afford* to only fight at odds of three to one. (And I\'d
like to
see a source for that claim, by the way. When HMS Shannon engaged and
destroyed USS Chesapeake it certainly didn\'t have any friends along...in fact,
it deliberately sent off all other ships in the squadron so it could engage
the
equivalently-sized Chesapeake one-on-one.

(For those Americans who don\'t recall the historical details, Shannon wom-
America didn\'t win *every* engagement...) (I\'ve just finished re-reading
Patrick O\'Brian\'s marvellous "The Fortune of War", which includes very
historical retellings of USS Constitution taking HMS Java and HMS Shannon
beating USS Chesapeake.)

In any event, the frigate actions - though psychologically impressive - were
nearly irrelevant strategically. British merchant shipping was
inconvienienced;
US merchant shipping was completely shut down at every port on the US.
The Royal Navy still had effectively complete sea control. The British could
land troops anywhere they wanted and there wasn\'t a damn thing the US Navy
could do about it, which is what sea control is really about.

A good analogy is WWII and the Bismark - the wonderfully advanced, very
impressive US frigates could indeed beat any single opponent, but were just
too few and far between to influence the war other than psychologically.
Not completely off topic, as "commerce raider in individually superior
cruiser"
is a good roll for Traveller PCs to play in a war...

>they certainly had the initiative, especially at sea.
>This may explain why the British were willing
>to return their strategic gains - if they were winning, why do that?
"Initiative" is a complicated thing to define. Who took the initiative in
actually
landing troops? And, in the end, landing troops and protecting merchant
shipping
is what naval power is really about.

Britain had agreed to US terms before the war even started, and had no hope
of actually holding retaken colonies, so it\'s not surprisng Britain agreed to
end the
war...Definitely a draw.

Oops. I meant to write "out of US ships" - apologies. Impressing british and
american sailors out of US ships was definitely a no-no.

Searching merchants for goods destined for France was more legitimate, one
would have
to say (Britain was at war, after all...) but impressing was a no-no.

Not quite true... I\'ve met a few hard-line Jehova\'s Witnesses who object to
it, usually with the line "There is no joy except in worship." And let us
not forget that the Jewish and Islamic calendars also have differing points
where the new year starts, as do those who use the Celtic Calendar for
religious purposes (Mostly, now, Wiccans and Psuedo-Druids).

Ob Trav: I envision worlds like Psaydi useing the sidereal year rather than
the imperial year for record keeping. Religios dictatorships would most
likely keep time in local units except where such units are either too long
or too short for useful calculations in manageable numbers (Such as years
under, say, 60 ImpStdDays). Or days under 6 hours, or over about 40...
(Days in the 10-15 hour range will probably be useable as "Doubled Days.").

Sidereal Years over about 500 ISD\'s will probably also not be in favor,
simply due to the problems of individuals not processing years that long.
At least not humans....

  ISTR that the fledgling USN\'s victories were all against smaller RN units;
they knew perfectly well that they couldn\'t risk combat with the battleships
that they couldn\'t match. Describing the US as possessing the initiative at 
sea seems perverse to say the least (the Great Lakes, eventually, OTOH...)

Assuming that you\'re referring to Cromwell\'s revolution:

Citizen Cromwell didn\'t _invade_ England, he rebelled against the
rightful King of England.  In the end, the insurrectionists failed to
displace the institution of the English monarchy.

Admittedly, the monarchy was restored by a claimant from overseas, but
this was not a conquest in the same sense as, say, Germany\'s conquest of
France in AD 1940.

Actually, as Bruce has pointed out, the United States had resolved it\'s
issues before the war began.

The real reason for the US launching the war was that they thought the
Canadian colonies would be an easy mark with Britain busy on the continent.

The thing about impressing sailors was just something for the plebs to lap
up. Britain, and every other navy, ( including the US Navy),  had been
pressing  _everybody\'s_ merchant sailors for centuries, it was standard
practice.

What makes you think it didn\'t demonstrate "Staying power"

The British got what they wanted, an end to the war without any further
concessions, but the US definitely did not get what it wanted, which was
possession of the Canadian colonies

By your own standards, therefore, the US lost.

I\'ve got North and Central America with a population of about 3.5 billion
(working from the CT population figures, rather than the 40-billion figure
for overall Terran population that appeared in the _Solomani_ supplement
or _Rats & Cats_).  Over half of that is in the mega-cities of Central
America and the Caribbean, although there\'s a fair amount along the
East and West Coasts of North America.  Of course, there\'s Phoenix
Starport in old Arizona.

My take on the overall Terran population is that there\'s been a lot
of ethnic intermixing and loss of local cultural distinctiveness.  In short,
almost everyone is light brown in color and speaks the Terran dialect
of Galanglic (possibly with a local dialect as a second language).

You say the british started by conscripting (funny, we yanks called it 
kidnapping...hhhmmm) people and blocking US shipping (By lethal force force 
at times I might add) but the US starts the war...interesting logic.  

The "occasional" conscription (as you describe it) was a little more than 
occasional.  You said they took american soldiers from british ships?  Was it 
policy then for british ships to have american troops on them?  The british 
would capture foriegn ships, often American, and press the ENTIRE crew (those 
who survived the initial attack) into british service.  The American were the 
first to move into Canada, but the british opened the hostilities, at sea.

As to your second point, the military loss actually wasn\'t much of a 
surprise, as I said, several of the military leaders of the time for the US 
were shall we say...not working with sharpened swords.

Anyway, yes history is still mentioned now and then in school here, but as 
should be obvious it wont be "explained" the same in every 
location...geography tends to put it\'s own twist on the teaching of it.  You 
should see a professor from Pennsylvania and one from Virginia talk about the 
American Civil War, it would be two different stories.  Oh well, this is off

Ahh, the great "Who won the War of 1812" debate (seems to come up about

Well, yes and no. The naval portion of the War of 1812 is a text book case
of a minor navy (the US) following a guerre de corse against a major naval
power (the UK). The UK had world wide committents and consequently
forced to protect those interests in the most cost effective manner. Hence
the standard RN frigate as a 32 or 36 gun 5th rate. The US had no such
committments to protect and could therefore build ships that were
individually superior to the RNs, hence the USNs monster 50 gun 4th rates.
It really is no suprise that these ships defeated their RN counterparts.
However, despite their sucesses the US frigates really could do no more
than inflict a string of embarrassing pin pricks on the UKs overall maritime
position. There simply were not enough US frigates to do any real damage.
The British on the otherhand, had more than sufficent resources to totally
shut down US trade with a blockade, it may not have been spectacular
but it was certainly effective. Also once the RN commissioned their own
50 gunners, the US frigates were forced to act far more cautiously (as an
aside, the RNs 50 gunners were not built in response to the US frigates
as is often claimed, their drafts date from 1810).

ObTrav: The lessons of the War of 1812 are perfectly valid in Traveller and
very illuminating.

IIRC, BayCon is held in San Jose (at least it was in 1985, when I
attended).

If there will be a significant TML presence there, I\'ll have to try to
come up with the funding to attend myself.

Of course, for those of us in the Gulf South, there\'s always CoastCon,
in March 2000....

No. The US negotiated terms with the brittish AFTER the war began, but well
before it\'s end. One of the concessions was that HM RN would cease
impressing persons from US vessels. Pressing from ships underway was NOT
common; pressing sailors in port was common. Prior to the War of 1812, His
Majesty\'s Government did not recognize American Independance De Jure; that
they had accepted it De Facto didn\'t mean normalized relations. BTW, the
war was 4 years from first battle to last; 1812 was in the middle.

>The real reason for the US launching the war was that they thought the
>Canadian colonies would be an easy mark with Britain busy on the continent.

A goal that had been abortively attempted prior; not mentioned at all in
the declaration of war. The US goal, if any were set, was recognition AS A
GOVERNMENT; cessation of pressing US sailors AT SEA was recognition that
they were under the flag of a nation, not a brittish colony. Brittain had
been defending their actions by claiming that the US was, in fact, not a
state, but 13 rebellious colonies.

>What makes you think it didn\'t demonstrate "Staying power"

Item: The Brittish formally recognized the US.
Item: The brittish raided, but did not attempt to take, US Cities.
Item: The Brittish did not mobilize their army in any great force.
Item: The proof that HMRN was, in fact, not the be-all and end-all of seapower

Quite literally, it was a PR coup for the US; while merchant shipping to
and from the US may have been slowed to a trickle (some blockade running
did occur), it did not prevent the US from projecting force on the seas,
all the way to Tripoli. This last is memorialized by the new branch of the
US military which was raised due to the war in their hymn: "From the Halls
of Montezuma,/ to the Shores of Tripoli / We will fight our country\'s
battles / On the land as on the sea." Yes, Uncle Sam\'s Musket and Cutlas,
Uncle Sam\'s Misguided Children, the US Marine Corps. The war also served to
unify the colonies at a time where framentation seemed immanent. If nothing
else, the internal changes brought about by the War of 1812 were as
important as the recognition by HMG.

That the US forces fought as well as they did started a breakdown of the
Status Quo in Europe, as well.

Fundamentally a war is fought for some form of gain. For brittain, there
was not enough force to be brought to bear IN TIME, at LOW ENOUGH COST, for
them to conttinue the fighting. For the US, until they could establish that
they were, in fact, not just a rebelious colony, but a nation-state of
their own, they were not taken seriously (France being notable in the
exception, but france had other reasons, specifically, keeping Brittain off
their own back, for encouraging the US vs UK interactions). By getting the
concessions from brittain (by far a cheaper solution than retaking the 13
colonies or indefinite blockade, especially since cotton and tobacco were
major Brittish imports), the US enforced enough political will to gain
recognition.

Ob Trav: The Frontier Wars are, quite obviously, NOT about territorial
needs for the Zhodani; The 3I doesn\'t really NEED expansion room for the
first one. On the interstellar scale, basics of resources don\'t make for
enough of a prize to justify the war. Next comes Politcal Will and
Ideology; here we find a fit to the canon. The only reason for the war
would be to establish and maintain a firm border, so as to prevent
"Imperialization" of the border areas.

Likewise, the Interstellar wars, in the days of the Vilani Imperium, are
not so much about resources as "Manifest Destiny". The VI seems to have a
desire to rull all of mankind. The Terran Confed cannot threaten the VI as
a whole. At least, they could not do so in any meaningful military way
during any single war. The whole issue is one of gaining enough to
consolidate, and gain some more after the consolidation. The Plague of
Duskir changed the ballance immensely; The TC, which had NO CHANCE of
peaceful long-term co-existance, was able to defeat the decimated VI Navy.
From the perspective of the VI, the "Upstarts" were just a threat, one that
kepttaking more and more, and needed to be stopped, and then, as was their
standing manifest destiny, erradicated as an interstellar-nation-state,
integrated, and culturally subsumed.

Hmmm... I think I see a pattern here...

Interesting point, and I suppose the same holds true along other fault lines
(at least the sideways sliding types), and other geological activity would
have changed the terrain as well. Like the chain Hawaii. Aren\'t the
Himmalayas still rising?  Has anyone considered or actually mapped such a
"far future Terra," and what all should be taken into consideration? Are
there canonical (or non-canonical) refs to metroplexes or superstructures on
Earth, or lasting war damage? Has the ecology changed at all, have
extraterrestrial life forms entered our biosphere? Oh my, what a can of

24-26 March 2000, in Biloxi, Mississippi, at the Coliseum (within sight
of the Gulf Coast).  See the followin URL for details (still a bit
sketchy at this point):

http://www.coastcon.org/

Note that a traditional event at CoastCon is the Porno Patrol\'s BLT
Dance. ("BLT" stands for Black tie, Lingerie, and Toga.  You must be
attired in one of those three fashions to be admitted to the dance.) 
(BTW, the Porno Patrol is a subgroup of New Orleans fandom, admission to
which is by invitation only.  [No, I\'m not yet a member.])

Hello my friend,

try to check out the Solomani & Aslan - Guide, it will answer a lot

	Hmm. A self-loading bullpup version of Crossfire MK-1?

	A bullpup version would be tight design, but it could be done

	Bullpup weapons may have reversible ejection port (FA-MAS, Steyr

  The Restoration in 1660 was of the legitimate King; the "Revolution" in
1688 was the collapse of the then-current regime to a foreign prince. A
foreign prince who brought a substantial army with him; the fact that the
challenge was not taken up doesn\'t change the dubious nature of the claim
that no invasion took place, but that\'s more something for the Brits to
whine about :>

I had a good time hanging out with Ross tonight, and many beers were drank 
for the cause. ;)

Ross and I were talking about the possibility of a once a month game in the 
Bay Area, however nothing was really decided.  We had a good time talking 
about favorite games, and styles of play.  If people are serious about 
getting together and playing a once a month game in the SF area, then I 
would recommend getting ahold of me at reverendkeith@hotmail.com and 
sorting all this out.

Obviously, I am curious as to what people would like to play (G:T, CT, MT, 
something else?), but I am more curious if there is actually a desire by 
fellow SF TML\'ers to start up and sustain a game. . .

    That\'s the exact thing I was thinking of! Except maybe having the .223
barrel on top for a better accuracy. Unfortunately MegaTraveller doesn\'t
give values for HE and HEAP shotgun loads and I\'m leery of extrapolating
from the Assault Rocket Launcher in case I make a super weapon and blow out
the campaign balance. Shotguns are the most tolerated firearms by law level
and if I make a wonder bullet for them everyone will want one, it\'ll make a
mockery of banning the other guns. Still, if the ARL is 10mm and the
standard 12 guage is 18mm, what would the ratio of explosive power be?

I too have kept quiet because this really has no place on the TML, but the
subject is one that interests me and I just can\'t let this go.

Actually, one of the reasons why the American frigates were so succesful was
that British frigate captains couldn\'t flee from them. The Admiralty expected
any British ship to be able to outfight anything in its own class. A frigate
could flee from a ship-of-the-line, but if it fled from another frigate the
captain risked being hung for cowardice. At the very least he could expect
to be beached. It made no difference that the \'frigate\' was larger and had
scantlings like a ship-of-the-line. It may be that Admiralty orders eventually
allowed small British frigates to avoid action against American 44s, although
I have not heard of that. Do you have a source for this allegation?

In any case, the British eventually got their act together and proceeded to
sweep the seas clear of American shipping. I refer you to C.S. Forester\'s
_The Age of Fighting Sail_ for a thorough exploration of the seaborne side
of the war.

>there were three occasions when American ships destroyed three british ships

>month. That\'s pretty impressive.

Unless you\'re talking about American privateers capturing British merchantmen,
then you are misinformed. The American Navy didn\'t capture or destroy 19
British naval vessels in the whole war. I doubt they even _fought_ 19 naval
engagements in the whole war.

>While the U.S. had suffered some early losses and embarrassing defeats, they
>certainly had the initiative, especially at sea. 

That just isn\'t true. At the time peace was signed very few American Navy
ships were at liberty. Most had been captured, destroyed (some of them by 
their own crew to prevent the British from capturing them) or blockaded.
I\'m not sure a single frigate was at liberty, though I may be wrong about
that; a few sloops is all, IIRC.

>This may explain why the British were willing to return their strategic 
>gains - if they were winning, why do that?

The British public was tired after two decades of war, income tax was 4
shillings in the pound, and Wellington had expressed doubts that America
could ever be completely defeated in a land war (certainly not without an
effort similar in scope to the one that had defeated Napoleon), and the RN
no longer felt the need to impress American sailors or blockade European
ports.

If America won the War of 1812 then it was by default; the other side quit
and went home...
