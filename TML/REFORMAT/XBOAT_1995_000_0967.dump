Consider that one of the reasons that an Imperial Family member has been
willing to place the Interdict on a world, has been in order to make
certain worlds owned by certain powerful noble families entirely private.
Lewis/Aramis is an example of this.  Minor Tukera family interests hold
a fief there (the Barony of Inselberg?) and once owned the rest of the
planet outright; they still own most of it.  For various reasons, the 
Tukeras wanted to shut off all interstellar traffic to the world but 
their own, and through the sponsorship of the Marquis Leonard 
Bolden-Tukera of Aramis, and also "various interests at Court" (do you 
see a pattern here?) arranged to have the Interdict placed on the entire 
world of Lewis.  Tukera ships can come and go at will, under a special 
access dispensation.  Everyone else is prohibited from the world.  

The Tukera family owned something like 30% of the Tukera Lines megacorp
outright.  Tukera had a virtual monopoly on long-distance interstellar
travel in some core subsectors.  By the figures I came up with this fall,
the assets they controlled just in bulk shipping could have been worth
several quadrillion credits.  The family helped Cleon found the Third
Imperium itself.  Do they have a say at Court?  Sure looks like it.

The fact that there are Imperial citizens on Lewis who are now totally
cut off from interstellar contact unless they are willing to leave and
never return, well, that seems to be "an internal matter of the world
government of Lewis", which is the Tukera family.  

The Tukeras aren\'t the only large family that has this kind of power 
and influence.  The Hortalez family, for instance, is even wealthier
than the Tukeras.  A Shiishuginsa daughter married an Alkhalikoi
emperor.  The Imperium is big enough to give rare individuals and
groups of individuals incomprehensible amounts of personal power.

First, Michael Llaneza in Digest 133 said that "The interesting thing 
about fashions in the Imperium, as well as music and other cultural 
traits is the time lag in communications."  Not only this, but the high 
population density of certain systems, but each system seperated by a 
week at least.

In effect, you have about 900 \'cities\' with, say, 90 \'mega-cities\' at Pop 
A.  Each city is largely alone in time: communication in the (Tl A+) city is 
instantaneous between each member of that society, but to communiate 
off-world massive gaps of at least a week appear.

The difference between \'in-system\' and \'out-system\' becomes quite large, 
with \'in-system\' pratically meaning face-to-face, and \'out-system\' 
meaning way-out-there-somewhere.  Such a strong dichonomy would be very 
interesting to explore.

Llaneza\'s \'context and mutation\' points are also quite good.  And what 
woould be the consequences of the loss of sociological casuality; could 
you explore this concept a bit more for me?  Thanks for your post!

(And don\'t forget the \'base cultures\' of the Vilani, Solomani, and plain 
vanilla Imperial, too!)

----

Back to my first love, interstellar strategy.

First, a brief review.  Im my original post, I postuated a war in ten 
years between \'Gov1\' and \'Gov2\'.  I said (editing somewhat) -

Gov1 has about 150% of the pop of Gov2 
Gov1 is about a sector in size, Gov2 is about a sector and a half
Gov1 is evenly spread out compared to Gov2, which has two \'high-pop\' 
     areas, with the rest of the area near-empty.
Gov1 is primarily TL C, with high-pop systems ranging from TL A to F.  
     Gov2 is primarily TL E, with high-pop systems ranging fromn TL D to F. 
There is a large buffer state between them, about 2 subsectors in size, 
     at TL D-F.  An ally of Gov1, but more like U.S./Japan rather than 
     U.S./Britain.  It has no love for Gov2, but does not wish to commit 
     it\'s limited forces unles certain of victory.  Moreover, it does not 
     fully trust Gov1.

* * * * *

OK.  Now Steven H. recommends that Gov1 surrender gracefully, as it can\'t 
seriously fight against Gov2.  I\'ll assume that that\'s true (sorry: no 
experience at playing TCS!).  *But* he also says that "a single hogh-pop 
TL 15 world pretty much makes that polity a TL 15 polity, NOT a TL14 (or 
TL 12) polity."

I\'m assuming that the implication is that military of that polity would just 
funnel all military expendeture through that TL F high-pop world. Humm.  
Excluding the \'space patrol\', \'colonial squadrons\' and suchlike, he 
would be correct - for Gov1, which is a unitary state.   Gov2 has a host 
of different navies, as well as a "Grand Fleet" which is farly largish, 
but kept too small to dominate Gov2 [in effect, a crack naval task 
force].      

You know, I think that the ground just shifted under my feet.

Well, let\'s follow thru on this.  Assume that Gov1 (the big \'TL C\' govt) 
has only recently begun to funnel military funds into the TL F systems.  
Let\'s also postuate that Gov2, resting on their laurals (remember, they 
have been \'winners\' for the last 400 years) is more tied up into \'inner 
politics\' rather than the \'primitive foreginers\'.  They are comparatively 
uninterested in the faint rumblings coming from Gov1.

Now *this* is interesting!

Going on with Steve H.\'s comment\'s

"There is no numerical superiority." (Regarding Gov1\'s navy vis-a-vis 
Gov2\'s navy.  Gov1 has 150% of Gov2\'s population)

Why not? <quizzical look>

"Yes." ...on does anyone here read Dragon.

Well then. 
I asked the question (semi-jokingly) because Dragon would seem to be the 
total antithesis of Traveller\'s attitude towards technology and reality. 
I sometimes look through it, but usually nothing strikes me as interesting.
Still, I wanted to see if nyone here is quote "Broadminded" unquote to 
read something totally at odds with the Traveller universe.
So there.

Last word from Steve H. "NOTE: I am ignoring the possibility of genocidal 
war..."

Yea, so am I.
Actually, im my private universe the attitudes between the citizens of 
Gov1 and Gov2 were initally genocidal: sterilization capagins using Big 
Rocks and genetic warfare were common in the earlier centuries.

Later, tact agreements to let the loser\'s leave the system in return for 
an end to the fighting arose.  These have been formalized rituals by the 
time this war starts.

What I\'m hoping to do is to let Gov1 capture a major portion of Gov2\'s 
population (the smaller High-Pop cluster), but be forced to keep the 
population in place rather than move or kill them.  The question I want 
to explore with this senario [after a glorious round of wargaming ;] is 
"What happens when two ancient foes, with a long history of hatred and 
henious acts against each other, are rammed in the same room and forced 
to live with rach other?"

I know, I know; this question has been dealt with to death in literature, 
history and situation comedies.  The new factors I\'m bringing up are  A) 
_actual_ physical differences, rather than simple racism (ie. the 
consequenses of widespread genetic engineering), B) the actual 
sociological effects of a long, long race war -- between technological near-
equals -- the ideologies that power it, and the forces needed to end it, 
without a decisive defeat of one or the other.

As a side bar: The buffer state was originally a part of Gov1.  However, 
because of it\'s close proximity to Gov2 - and the constant incursions - 
it quickly developed into a high-tech region of Gov1, and eventually 
became independent ablut 300 years ago. (Imagine if the Northern States 
choose to seceede from the Union in 1861, and you have an idea of what I 
want.)  I do plan to have Gov1 conquer them, and see what happens when 
they are reunited with their unloved brethern.  Will they find a way to 
re-seceede?  How would Gov1 appease their pride, tempt them to identify 
with Gov1, and put down any political unrest without alienating the 
general population?  

And Seven H. also noted that you can\'t tell Pyrrhic Wars until after 
their end.  Well, I agree that fighting, ONCE STARTED, tends to go on and 
on beyond all reason.  But a careful and pessimistic look at the facts 
can often prevent a war before it starts. 

 * * * * * * *

Now, on to J Roberson\'s "The Warring States":

"Train hard".  OK, Gov1 does so.

[Thanks to Steve H.\'s comment\'s Gov1 will now be a largely TL F navy.  
However, out of curiousity, how much can good, tough training make up for 
a deficency of technology?  I know that the excellent Zulu warrious still 
ws simply slaughtered by the British Maxims: I also know that the Mongol 
Hordes brought down empires far more advanced then they were (partially 
by using the tech of conquered nations, partially by specializing in a 
form of technology (horseback warfare) that the Chinese, say, did poorly in.

The equivelant would be, perhaps, Gov1 specializing in throwing rocks 
(ie. massive, low-tech mass drivers; asteroids leaving jump 100 km above 
the target world) while Gov2 retaliates with biowar.  This can stand more 
thought.]

"How many of Gov2\'s low/no-popworlds are still uses? [umm, \'usable\']  
Thai is, do any of them have vital resources?"  Well, not in the 
dollars-and-cents way you mean.  After TL B+, say, a typical system 
doesn\'t _need_ anything outsystem that it can\'t make on it\'s own. 
(Excluding radioactives: but their importance is drastically diminished 
when fusion power plants arise).

No: most of those worlds act as a psychological \'comfort/growth zone\'.  
Only a few worlds are key transportation bottlenecks (the kind of worlds 
you want).  All those worlds work more like Russia\'s massive area, to 
disperse and slow the enemy\'s advance, and for pride - and internal 
politics.

I said "There is a large buffer state between them, about 2 subsectors in 
size..."
Roberson says "Annex them."

I like his style!

To leverage my numerical superiority, he says "Blitz.  Pick some 
poor-defended but important world and throw everything you can at it.  
Repeat as often as needed."  Yumm!  It\'s too bad that I can\'t email my 
maps to you, so we can get down to the nit-and-gritty of it.  Careful 
planning would be needed.

----

Finally: 

I bought a book at university years ago, Fred Charles Ikle\'s _Every War 
Must End_.  An excellent book, emphasising the planning of a war and the 
necessity of drawing out _all_ the implications of a war, right to it\'s 
end. (You\'d be surprised how many leaders only planned the attack, but 
did not consider the results of their actions, or the likely denouncement 
of the war.  Gov1, take note!)  

The highlight, in a nutshell...

A) Far too much energy is spent planning the tools, compared to linking 
tools to their results.  I.e. Pearl Harbour was a nearly-perfectly 
excecuted, well-though-out plan for a single battle, but noone took even 
a look at the likely consequences of this action.  No one planned out the 
most likely results of this action, or took them to their likely conclusion.

And other things to remember...
   As fighting continues it\'s purposes change.
   ie. trying to position itself for the _next_ war, reconciliation may 
become a wiser choice than outright victory (see the Franco-Prussian 
War), today\'s enemy becomes tomorrow\'s friend

   Means becomes ends.
   ie. the military strives to conquer territory because it benefits from 
conquering.  Whether this benefits the nation is something else again.
Also, personal considerations and clique goals affect wars, although the 
national interest is usually considered, sort-of.  

   What resources would be used?  Is this a war with bounds?
   I bet that Strephon didn\'t think that Black War tactics would be used 
against him!

   What outside help?  How much?
   Will the cost coerce the enemy?
   The problem of the Final War - why it was so destructive - is that for 
Lucan and Dulinor, there was no such thing as "too high a price" (As 
Steven H. pointed out)  This also comes to play in religious/racial/
ideological wars. [Can you imagine that at one time the entire Earth 
could have been gutted because of a set of bloody economic theories?  
Ridiculous!]

   What is the enemy up to?  What is he thinking?
   Which estimates to believe?

I know the Brits had Gatlings (first used at Nyezane)... I had simply assumed
they were made by Gatling (later to become a generic term).  Were these
weapons (10 barrels, chambered in .577/.450, nasty critter) made by Maxim?

Not to second-guess Steve\'s own words, here, but initially I agreed with
him - A sector with a high-tech capital is effectively a high-tech sector -
the technology is a little more diffused. It\'s like how Starbucks Coffee
took over Seattle years ago and has only recently (this is an unconfirmed
rumor) made it to Tulsa, OK. I hope that the specifics don\'t confuse the
point - yes the tech is there, but without a decent proportion of high-tech
worlds to populated space, the technology gets diffused and even though the
polity *can* build a B2 bomber, they\'lll probably rely on cheaper bombers
that can be manufactured easily on more worlds.

Besides which, as was pointed out by the original poster, the high-tech
sector is a more diverse coalition, rather than a singular unifed state. To
me it is akin to NATO vs the Soviet Union - Yes NATO had superior tech, but
each army was its own force and limited to its own natonal resources (for
the most part). I do not think that graceful capitulation is even close to
an agreeable option, especially given the avowed nature of the lower-tech
state.

>>"There is no numerical superiority." (Regarding Gov1\'s navy vis-a-vis
>>Gov2\'s navy.  Gov1 has 150% of Gov2\'s population)
>Why not? <quizzical look>

I think he meant that the technological advantage would far outweigh the
numerical superiority, and that the higher-tech society would make better
use of their resources - it would take less to beuild a match for the
enemy. That strategy only works to a given point.

>Later, tact agreements to let the loser\'s leave the system in return for
>an end to the fighting arose.  These have been formalized rituals by the
>time this war starts.

How quaint ;) I have always been of the opinion - and I am no hawk,
precisely because I feel this way - that anything worth fighting for is
worth by any means. If war is to be the last means of resolution, then
putting little rules on it that lessen its effects will only make it more
attractive. THis is precisely what happened in Europe time and again.
People were upset about German U-Boats because (among other things) they
fired from below the surface of the ocean. Can you imagine that?! <:0=

If I estimate the aggressor state correctly, they will not let any
"articles of war" prevent them from gaining an advantage. They won\'t break
the rules too often, lest the opposition follow suit - but they will break
the rules when the prize outweighs the risk.

>What I\'m hoping to do is to let Gov1 capture a major portion of Gov2\'s
>population (the smaller High-Pop cluster), but be forced to keep the
>population in place rather than move or kill them.

I like the role-playing questions you intend a a result of this enforced
closeness. There are many reasons not to move or kill the population.

THe systematic and efficient elimination of a people can be accomplished -
witness the Holocaust - but it isn\'t always easy. In fact, at that tech
level it may be more efficeient to use high techology to brainwash key
people and pacify the population that way, freeing up your resources for
the war effort. Moving them poses just as much of a problem. It can be
difficult to balance a war budget using slave labor - the Germans did it
for a while - It\'s easier to take key points of power and turn high-ranking
people to your cause than to systematically kill them all, especially with
a war on.

>I know, I know; this question has been dealt with to death in literature,

Don\'t sweat it. Nobody\'s been original since the end of the Ancietn Age. ;)

>[Thanks to Steve H.\'s comment\'s Gov1 will now be a largely TL F navy.
>However, out of curiousity, how much can good, tough training make up for

Quite a bit, IMHO.Unfortunately, I have no figures off hand to back this
up. . . *shrug* but I\'m good trainging is always an advantage. If you are
really curious, look into figures comparing the Stormtroopers against
frontline French, Belgian, and English troops. A great deal of the German
Army\'s success in WW2 was shock tactics - tactics that only worked because
the soldiers had trained hard. In short, practice makes perfect.

Need, no. Want, yes. And while they can suffice, they may effectively drop
a TL or two. Look at War Bonds and recycling in WW2. People stopped driving
cars, wearing pantyhose, and planted their own gardens to help the war
effort. Some have postulated that if money had been spent on NASA instead
of Vietnam, we\'d have an orbital station or even a moon base by now. A
planet under siege will still be the provider of resources - including
governmental authority - that other planets will need.

This last bit is one reason why capitals are so important. You;d think that
capturing the capital would be no big deal - the government will just meet
someplace else,right? But where? And how many will make it to this new
place? How can you govern effectively when city small has just been reduced
to so many anti-particles? Capturing low-pop worlds demoralizes the rest of
the nation. Capturing hihg-pop worlds merely exacerbates this effect.

>(Excluding radioactives: but their importance is drastically diminished

Not when your friends are there, your relatives are there, and your
business interests are there. Even boring worlds can become rally points.
Witness the Alamo.

Remember my comments on the rules of warfare. They only hold so long as all
sides think war is meant to be fair.

Gosh. . .didn\'t mean to be this long-winded. . .

Maxims like that.

    Actually, I meant that it was unlikely that there would be a numerical
advantage to the higher (but low tech) population.  Again, based largely
upon HG and MT, since I am not familiar enough with FF&S ship designs
yet, I note that TL13-14 ships cost an average of only 75% (or less, for
a well designed ship) of the cost of a similar ship built at TL12-.  A
TL15 ship will cost less than 60% of the cost of a TL12- ship.
    This assumes that the two ships are of very similar overall
capability.  In point of fact, it is very difficult to build a TL13+ ship
that is of similar overall performance to a TL12- ship, unless the 
TL13+ ship is VERY poorly designed.
    However, it is possible to get reasonably close.  And if you DO, then
the TL13+ ship is cheaper.  The hull is cheaper.  The power plant is
REALLY cheaper.  The guns aren\'t really any cheaper ( a small amount, if
you\'re using the local currency exchanges in TCS), but they ARE more
effective.  Ditto the computers.  Ditto pretty much everything else that
really runs up the price of a warship...but overall, the TL13 ship is
significantly cheaper...

    My experience in TCS tends to support the opinion that, credit for
credit, a TL13 culture will be able to afford 25% - 50% more ships than
a TL12 culture.   And each ship will be better.  Of course, the TL13
culture won\'t usually bother to match the TL12 culture in numbers.
Instead, they will concentrate on their qualitative superiority, which
STILL means that the TL13 ships will be cheaper than similar sized
ships from the TL12 culture.  And the TL13 ships will be considerably
more effective than the similiarly-sized TL12 ships...

    It is NEVER easy.  Note that the Germans (a remarkably efficient

Gypsies, Slavs in general)...

    But all the practice in the universe won\'t let a Panzer IV take out
an M1A2.  Or an FW-190 take out an F-15...Keep in mind that two TL\'s of
difference is at least as large as the difference now and WW2.

    As to Gov1 having a TL15 navy - Unless there are a LOT of TL15 people
(to support TL15 industries and such), Gov1 will NOT have a TL15 Navy.
And if Gov1 DOES have a TL15 Navy, then it is best described as a TL15
civilization, NOT a TL12 civilization.  TL is generally assumed to
correspond to "High Common TL", which represents the best technology
generally available for mass production.  If they can build an entire
TL15 Fleet, then they have a High COmmon TL of 15, not 12...

    I disagree that capturing the capital is a trivial exercise.  It
certainly hasn\'t been trivial in any TCS game *I* have ever played.
    I also disagree with the notion that capturing low-pop worlds is
demoralizing.  90%+ of the population is on the high-pop worlds.  So
ALL the low-pop worlds together add up to only 10% of the population.
I note that historically, loss of peripheral real-estate had little,
if any effect on popular morale.  Loss of a significant fraction of
the Army or Navy (whichever is the dominant arm) will severely
demoralize most civilians, however.
    Capturing high-pop worlds IS demoralizing, but is also next to
impossible, given the technologies allowed in Trav.  Destroying it
is not too terribly difficult, but taking it is pretty hard.  UNLESS
you have a significant technological advantage.  Which means you\'ll
need a TL15 army to go with your TL15 navy.

    Another point about the TL\'s of your two polities - if both sides
include a significant number of TL15 industries, then BOTH will be
predominantly TL15 militarily.

    I also believe that "Rules of War" will go out the window as soon
as one side looks to be losing in a big way.  SO cast my vote against
a "Gentlemen\'s War"...

    I point out that Once upon a time, in a TCS game now way in the
past, Sansterre (TL12, pop 2 billion) attacked New Home (TL13, pop
700 million).  While the interference of both Neubayern and Amondiage
obscured some details, it was clear that the battles between Sansterre
and New Home were all won by New Home.  There were two battles fought
exclusively between New Home and Sansterre.  Plus one part of a third
battle.  In all three, the Sansterran Fleet suffered major losses, as
opposed to the trivial losses by New Home (in those battles).  If
neither Neubayern nor Amondiage had gotten involved (and changed the
Old Islands War from a war between New Home and Sansterre to one 
between Neubayern and Amondiage, it is virtually certain that New
Home would have won the war handily.  Even with only one third the
population of Sansterre...

    My, a long-winded way of saying, "It\'s true"...:-)

    It\'s about to shift again.  A TL15 warship costs MUCH less than a
TL12 warship.  It is virtually certain that the lads in the TL12-14
worlds will buy TL15 warships instead of building their own, UNLESS
the ENTIRE capacity of the TL15 yards are used to support the 
national Navy.  Note also that TL15 free traders (and similar merchants)
are also much cheaper than TL12 free traders.  so MOST (up to the
total capacity of the yards) merchants will ALSO be TL15.

    Note that in the Third Imperium, it would be cheaper to go from
Regina to Terra to buy a ship, than it would be to build one locally.
Even if you have to factor in the loss of revenue (which is problematic)
required by the three year trip back to the Regina subsector.

Even cheaper to go to Rhylanor, of course, but the point is that
higher TL == cheaper.  Enough so that the highest TL yards will be
working at 100% capacity before ANY of the lower TL yards see any 
measurable business.

    Which implies that their Fleet is largely TL14, right?  Or did they

    Of course, if the military budget is very limited, there is even
more incentive to buy TL15 ships - your money will go farther.  Much
farther...

    It is that.  This is similar to the situation in the Islands

    See other notes, plus above.  TL13-15 ships cost enough less than
TL12 ships as to negate the population advantage...

    How?  Capture the high-pop worlds, I mean?  Do yourself a favour, 
and figure out how much spacelift would be required to move somewhere
around 500,000 men from one sector to another.  Plus equipment.  Then
tell yourself - "Well, these guys are outnumbered by the local army
of any high-pop world.  By about 50:1."  Then look at the process of
conquering the world again.  Twice.
    It is almost certainly possible to conquer a high-pop world.
Especially with a TL advantage.  But it will not be easy to capture
even ONE high-pop world, much less a "cluster"...

    This should be interesting.  IMHO, after conquest of the buffer
state, Gov1 will be incapable for many years of taking on Gov2.  First
they\'ll have to absorb the buffer state.  And incorporate its TL15
yards into their Naval building plan.  And rebuild all the ships that
were ruined by the war (most of them, in all likelihood)...
    And the Army has to be increased in size (to provide massive numbers
of Occupation Troops for the buffer state, plus more to attack worlds
in Gov2).  And a fairly major economic upheaval (see what you can find
out about the effect on the German economy of the conquests of most
of Europe during WW2.  Or the effect on the Soviet economy of conquering
Eastern Europe.)

    Looked at like that ALL wars are Pyrrhic.  "A rational Army _would_
run away."
    But, on the other hand "the aggressor is always peaceful.  He would
love to win without a fight."  It only takes one to make a war, and the
one who starts it is probably unbalanced.  But unless you are willing to
fight him to the last breath, he\'ll win out...

    I\'m not sure that Trav recognizes a TL difference between the
Mongols and the Chinese of the period.  I also point out that the
Mongols were pretty solidly absorbed by the Chinese.

    No, it can\'t.  You can\'t come out of jump that close to a world.
Kinetic kill weapons ARE a remarkably effective way to reduce a
world to ruins, though.

    They don\'t do this, though.  Taking a low-pop world is meaningless
to the polity as a whole (no benefit for you, no loss to him).  Bypassing
it is quite easy.  So a competent admiral will ignore the little worlds
and gun for the high-pop worlds that are worth grabbing...

    Sure would.  Try it against _me_, and I\'ll ruin you while you 
concentrate on "Stalingrad"...:-)
    If you go to the trouble of checking, you find that ALL the force-
multipliers relevant to Trav favour Gov2, NOT Gov1.  Which further
weakens a (highly unlikely) numerical advantage by Gov1.
    Note also that you need troop transports to invade me, but that 
I have no similar need for them in defending against your invasion.
Which further degrades the "numerical advantage" of Gov1.

    Incorrect.  Yamamoto knew quite well the long-term results of the
attack.  He told the government his opinions before the attack was
ordered.  His opinions were regarded as "defeatist".  Note that he
was correct in his analysis, almost to the day...
    Note also that Heinz Guderian analysed the probable results of
a European War.  If his thesis had included the Americans (America
was included as a data point, but a war with America was NOT included
in his analysis), then he could have predicted the results pretty
exactly (he assumed that one of the keys to victory in a future war
was ability to build mechanical transport.  He correctly recognized
that Germany needed to increase its own capacity further before the
war got going (it did), and he also recognized that America had 80%
of the world\'s industrial capacity in that regard...)

    An intriguing idea, but the Franco-Prussian War is a lousy example.
Note that the Treaty of Versailles has been described as French revenge
for their defeat in that war.  And the Treaty of Versailles has also
been described as one of the root causes of WW2...

    Your last point is reasonable.  The first I am skeptical of.
Conquering territory has almost no benefit for a military.  It actually
makes the military\'s job harder...

    Note that the Cold War (which might have become entirely too hot
several times) was NOT about economic theories.  The Soviet Union was
not built around an economic theory.  It was an old-fashioned 
dictatorship.  Pretty much the same as Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany.
Communism in the Soviet Union stopped being relevant with the take-
over by Stalin (who was, quite possibly, the greatest mass-murderer
in history.  Unless Hitler edged him out...)

J Roberson has a thing about my \'formalized rituals\'.  Well, let me say 
why I instituted them in the first place, then go on from there.

These rituals - call them "highly complex methods of communication", if 
you like - I created for the same reason why certain animals \'fight\', 
but rarely or never to the death.  These rituals exist more to limit 
the damage and extent that the (early) genocidal wars would cause: it has 
very little to do with \'fairness\' or \'understanding\', and a lot more to 
do with survival.

One of the most basic reasons I put them in is that I can\'t imagine truly 
unlimited warfare - between relative equals - that wouldn\'t soon (ie. 
within 150 years) either kill off both combatants or result in a *very* 
decisive victory for one side.  It certainly wouldn\'t have resulted in a 
900-year stalemate, which is what I want.

Thus, I decided that both Gov1 and Gov2 saw (after a serious amount of 
deaths and devestation, and several wars) that the profound hatred that 
they feel toward each other was threatening their own survival, and 
backed off, using these diplomatic rituals (and the use of expulsion 
rather than extermination) to cool down the situation and limit the lust 
for vengeance (well, compared to what it was previously).

Moreover, these rituals create a \'buffer\' of (strictly psychological!) 
safety, permitting both to turn inwards for a few centuries.  Moreover, 
Gov2 (you know, the TL D-F federation) obtained a decisive technological 
lead over Gov1, enough to be able to \'afford\' internal dissension. 

---- Long Aside ----

[Question: Why didn\'t Gov2 use this lead to finish Gov1?
 Answer: A) The Tech lead, although large enough to insure safety, was 
            not so large as to *guarantee* victory in an offensive war.
         B) The *threat* of war is often much more effective than the actual
            implimentation of that threat.  Prime example: The Third 
            Reich has a large technological lead over Russia, better  
            training, better leadership.  Hitler\'s correct choice should 
            have been to continue to intimidate the Soviet Union, but NOT to 
            actually go ahead with an attack.  He decided - to head off a 
            possible two-front war, which he feared -  to attack Russia 
            while she was weak.  Oops.
         C) Gov2 doesn\'t have total, accurate information on Gov1\'s total 
            tech situation, and suspected that they couldn\'t conquer 
            enough of Gov1 before Gov1 starts catching up - quickly - in 
            TL\'s.  Moreover, both societies are \'closed\' to each other, 
            leaving too many \'blank spaces\' in the information picture.  
            Better to remain as they were, with their superior strategic 
            situation.                                                  ]

---- End Aside ----

Now we can deal with the heard to J Roberson\'s argument: any war that is 
to be fought is to be fought with all the resources at hand.

Well, this is nice to say, but quite a lot of the time the internal 
political situation won\'t permit this (ie. all those body bags and ugly 
pictures).  The external political situation may not permit this (what if 
the U.S. (or China, later) nuked Vietnam?).  And exhellation (you know 
the word I\'m trying to spell) may be counter-productive (what if Iraq 
used poison gas?).

On the other hand, war isn\'t a parlour game.

Moreover, oftentimes the use of ritual in war requires a shared 
religion/ideology between combatents (ie. no warfare on Sundays in 
Christian medieaval Europe, the creation of the Art of War in  
China to encourage careful planning, espionage, and misinformation rather
than
open and unconsidered conflict.)  

It\'s quite true that Gov1 will attempt to \'flex\' the rules as far as 
it thinks it can get away with.  Still, since the consequences for being 
caught is so severe, and because it\'s rather difficult to hide the use of 
biowar agents, massive rock showers, and genocidal (non-military) nuclear 
strikes, it\'s unlikely that cheating will occur much.  Moreover, it\'s the 
losing side that\'s tempted to cheat the most: and Gov2 would be in a poor 
position to bring the war to the enemy, a nessessary precondition to 
dropping rocks on cities.  (NOT so neccessary when it comes to biowar: 
but both governments have long experienxe in dealing with _THAT_ kind of 
conflict.  Moreover, it\'s breaking the ritual... something that will be 
certainly be avoided, since much (or all!) of the war wiuld be fought in 
*their* systems.) 

To summarise: In this situation, diplomatic/military ritual is, I feel, 
defendable as a important factor in the relationship of Gov1/Gov2.  


 -- Long aside --

It seems that fighting genocidal wars is rather more easier than fighting 
conventional wars, when space war is concerned.  It\'s easier, cheaper and 
quicker to drop rock or viruses (or Viruses:) on a world than it is to 
land, occupy and hold a system, especially a High-pop system.

This makes warfare rather dreary from my point of view.  One of the 
reasons I\'m setting up this conflict between Gov1 and Gov2 is to 
determine the implications and limits of this style of war. Any comments 
would be appreciated.

My distant goal is to find some logical, physical mechanism that would 
make that style of warfare non-viable.  NOT "culturally forbidden".  NOT 
"short-sighted".  I want "Military stupid/impossible".

I want my armies & navies to slug it out, not just commit some 
comfortable, easy variation of mass murder.

Of course, my goal may be technologically impossible, or physically 
ridiculous.  If so, then I\'m open to any suggestions from the floor.

The Maxim Gun is not really one weapon.  Maxims started out as a less-bulky
version of the Gatling (in some cases water-cooled).  Later models of Maxim 
were much more like the standard machinegun of today; single barrel, fed by 
belt or large magazine.  Unlike the Gatling, Maxims were generally much 
more portable, but lacked the man-killing (or ship-killing) effectiveness of a 
1" Gatling.  I think most of the British equipment was made by Maxim, but 
the I think the early Maxims were basically lighter copies of Gatlings.

Of course, my favorite one was the Nordenfelt.  The thing looks like something 
DaVinci might have invented; a rack of barrels like a pipe organ, fired by the 
gunner pumping a crank up and down, which fired each barrel on the downswing 
and reloaded the barrels on the upswing.  Probably not the most effective 
machinegun, but it looked neat.

    'body' => '	I\'ve had a few thoughts about attacking a populated, high-tech
planet. I\'ll assume a Hi Pop, Hi Stellar world for the sake of discussion.
And Black War and genocide will be ruled out; the objective will be to
gain control of the target planet.

	First of all, the attacker must keep and maintain control of
local space. The volume around the target planet must be under firm
control for an extended period of time.
	Space superiority is the province of the Navy, and is very
straightforward and consists of preventing the defender from operating
any spacecraft within the 100 diameter limit.

	Secondly, orbit must be cleared of defenses. Anything capable of
relaying targetting data to meson guns must be eliminated. The defender
must be deprived of the ability to detect ships in orbit. Weapons of
course must also go. The defender will be stocked with small, remote
weapons stations designed to hide in orbit, deloy passive sensors and
launch weapons. Something as small as a missile would work. Thousnads
would be needed since many will be found and destroyed. The attacker will
be forced to maintain constant minesweeping operations to minimize losses
from that source.


	Thirdly, ground based sensors must be eliminated. Fixed sensor
arrays, active and passive, are large enough to be visible to optical and
IR sensors. They will be camoflauged, so the attacker must rely on image
analysis and operator skill to locate hidden sensors. A higher tech level
will help, so will peacetime spying; always do your homework. Lack of fire
control will effectively silence the planetary defense guns. The defender
may counter the loss of fixed sensors by using synthetic array sensors
with the individual elements mounted on grav vehicles. These will have to
be eliminated.

	Fourth, ground-based defenses capable of hiting a ship in orbit
must be analyzed to determine their extent, capabilities, and location.
This is accomplished during the campaign to clear orbit and the sensor
arrays. This is done as much to allow them to be avoided as to
immediately destroy them.

	Of course, high value targets in all categories must be destroyed
as soon as they are detected.

	The final stage is blockade. The orbital blockade against
defending warships will double as an economic blocade. More importantly,
ships in orbit must interdict ground-based transport, particularly food
transport to cities. I very seriosly doubt that every person on a Hi Pop
planet can be fed with food produced within easy reach. There are
situations where food will have to be produced in the cities, self
contained cities in on inhospitable planets for one. In these cases food
production facilities will have to be destroyed, captured, or sabotaged.

	The population of the planet will have to be starved into
submission. Nothing ele will work. Terror bombing has never decided a
campaign, and industry will keep producing even under heavy bombardment.
Besides, the economy is what you want. It may prove possible or
desireable to land troops to capture cities or factories. In any event,
anything that moves on the planet surface must be destroyed. No vehicles
may move, mass transportation lines have to be cut.

	When paralysis sets in, nothing moves, and the food doesn\'t get
to the cities, the citizens are trapped in their homes. Fear sets in and
surrender becomes possible. I suggest that one city be captured to prove
to the population that it can be. It also gives psychological and
symbolic benefits.  After that, wait for people to get hungry.

	Final note, never commit atrocities in territory you want to
keep. Retribution killings for guerilla attacks are worthless. Don\'t get
the population mad at you, any more than you have to anyway. The
objective is to control planet, not a graveyard.

	Any comments people?  Working out the details is going to be a
lot of work, but building a wargame scenario for BR and Striker out of
this would be worthwhile, and worth publishing.

	Alvin, I want to see your scenario. UWP\'s to the mailing list
perhaps? Can you share notes yet?

I haven\'t read it for years, but it wasn\'t always antithetical to
Traveller.  In the early eighties, Marc Miller used to write the
occasional official Traveller article for the magazine.  Two come
to mind off-hand.  The first was a tongue-in-cheek but useable
half-page article on adding the milk bottle to the standard
equipment list, in the special Traveller section (!) of Dragon #51.
More useful, the official write-up on the Province of Luna, Terra/Sol,
for 1110 was a multi-page article in Dragon #87 that was later used
as basis for some of the information in DGP\'s write-up of the
Terran solar system in _Solomani & Aslan_.  Dragon was doing a
series on the Moon in different RPGs back then, as I recall.

But that was back when Dragon actually published a lot of useful
stuff that wasn\'t for TSR games, and before they decided that SF
was best represented by "the Marvel-phile".

Yesterday, I exploded due to my frustration with dealing with these
megadeath weapons (actually, the ease that they can be created and used).

Well, today I\'d like to recieve any suggestions on how an interstellar
culture would have dealt with this fact.  What kind of defenses can be
set up to prevent airdrops of lethal viruses (the Snow Plague from the
"Renegade Legion" game still spooks me: a flu virus that kills...).

I think that many systems would have asteroid mining or use mass
drivers.  What are the safeguards to prevent millions from being held
hostage by a group of angry miners?

And I\'m sure that nasty computer viruses have been used before Virus as a
tool of war.  What are the viable defenses? (You *may* choose to ignore
this question: GDW has already published some good stuff about this
threat vector).

Hi!

Could anyone tell me the powers that a typical high-tech (TL B+) police
officer had in the Imperium?  I\'m thinking not so much about police
powers (which of course varies) but about the tools available to him: ie.
what new tools does new technology give the police officer?  And how
would PC\'s -- which are currently suffering a \'small legal
misunderstanding\' in the local system -- find a way to foil this?  Can
they? (I have heard of a TL F robot that can *perfectly* tell if a lie is
being used)

A micro-review of police duties: finding and apprehending criminals
                                 a reliance of non-lethal use of force
                                 crowd control
                                 detective equipment
                                 patrolling the streets/cyberspace/near space
                                      /ocean/roads/air-raft lanes
                                 aid and assisstance

Also: which worlds (and governments) would be most likely to equip their
   police forces with starships?  How would police from Imperial worlds
behave
   outside of their juristicion?  What about extradition treaties?

How would the less ethical police forces operate?  The best police?
   Religious police?  TL 2 police?  And how would they all interact?
   What about if a TL 6 bobby meets a TL C space pirate, but doesn\'t
   feel the need to die right now - what could he do?  How does officers
   on vacuum worlds differ from officers on waterworlds?  What are the
   differences between a cop on a pop6, TL A world w/ tainted atmosphere
   and a cop who has spent her entire time pursuing TL G credit fraud?

Could a low-tech cop even hope to deal with high-tech fraud?
   Disguises?  Violence?  Pirates?  What about the differences between a
   Vargr cop, an Aslan cop, a Zhodani cop, a Droyne cop, a Hiver cop, a
   K\'ree cop, a Solomani cop, a Vilani cop, and a Imperial cop?  Who\'s
   the better officer, a TL8 Aslan cop on a pop 8 world, or a TL F Imperial
   cop on a pop 5 world?

And, just for fun, how would all these cops deal with a speeder?

Any worlds from local law enforcement authorities are appreciated.

While I do believe that good training can overcome a technological
disadvantage (Peter the Great turned the easily defeated Russian army

force defeating a TL15 force is highly unlikely.

The trick about technology is that while the top-of-the-line ships

My reference wasn\'t to systematic destruction. German economists

made by-products of skin & hair)

I\'m sorry, I don\'t recall saying it was trivial. I certainly don\'t
believe capitals are easy to capture.

I think it would depend on the values of the civilization. If all life
is valued, then even the smallest world being taken will affect the
populace. If the society is used to war it may take the capture in
stride. It\'s like with people: Punch someone who has never fought in
their life; they\'ll take it a lot harder than a similar punch to
an experienced barroom brawler.

I think that the cultural forces are different. Assuming we are using
Continental Europe as our main historical source, I\'d like to point
out that the states were almost always in a state of war with somebody.
People were used to war. Furthermore, people tended to settle in the same
area - your relatives usually didn\'t live on the other side of the country.
People simply didn\'t get about as much as they do now.

Contrast this with the modern U.S. We have not been invaded for a long
time (that strip of rocks the Japanese took from Alaska doesn\'t count!;)
and a lot people - at least people I know - have friends and relatives all
across the country. If one part gets invaded (say, Maine or Hawaii) a
good portion of the general population will have friends, relatives, or
even just business interests there. If the same is tru of GOV2, then
there will be hue and outcry about a small world being taken.

Shipbuilding:

This gets back to Steve\'s question of TL. If the average TL of the
sector is only about 12, then those TL15 shipyards can charge an
arm and a leg for their advanced services. Compare the costs of typing
your resume on a typewriter vs getting it professionally set by
a resume service. It depends on how coherent Gov1 is as a polity.


> "There is no numerical superiority." (Regarding Gov1\'s navy vis-a-vis

The only flaw here is that no matter how good the ships are, Gov2 will
have fewer people to pull for crewing them. Of course, those high-tech
ships will need fewer people, but still. . .Gov1 has a higher potential
body count.

That depends largely on how they do it. If Gov1 is smart, they\'ll sow
dissent so that when they invade, they are "liberating" the buffer state.
Much like Hitler "invaded" an all-too friendly Austria.

Unless you want to cover your rear, hoping that the enemy won\'t use it

    And evading machinegun fire is very straightforward.  It consists
of not getting hit by all the little bullets.  But it\'s a lot easier

    Also true.  And easier to bandy about over a cold one than to
actually DO.  And note that "thousands" isn\'t even in the time-zone
of the capability of a high-pop, high-stellar world.  Assuming MCr10
per unit (which is WAY too expensive - if you designed units like that,
fire your designer and try again), and a population of 20 billion
(average over all high-pop worlds), then you can support 1000,000 units
with only 10% of your total Naval budget (given TCS figures for
available money - using Striker, it\'ll take only 5% of the budget,
assuming a military budget comparable to the US\'s).
    Minesweeping will certainly be necessary, but keeping your mine-
sweepers alive to complete their sweeps may be harder than you
think...

    Again, easier said than done.  Consider the possibility, once
suggested on the TML (by Wildstar?  Hans?) of putting a small
sensor array on top of EVERY building on the planet.  If the arrays
are small and cheap, the cost would not be prohibitive, but they
would prevent the close approach of a fleet until the entire
civilization is trashed...
    Also, my own suggestion at the time - an agent with a telephone
could, after you "silence" the planetary defenses, call in with
the coordinates of one of your ships (presumably landed), and the
deep meson guns could then destroy it.

    ALso true.  And easier said than done.  Avoiding them is, of
course, impossible if they are meson guns, without staying far
enough from the planet as to make your attack impossible.
    Note that AT LEAST thousands of such sites should exist on any
properly defended high-tech, high-pop world.

    Wonderful!  And after you have succeeded in this, what will you
have captured?  You\'ve destroyed the infrastructure required to
support the population (and industry) that you want/need.  So you
avoided wrecking the whole planet, and just settled for wrecking
the civilization...that\'s very helpful, all right...

    If you destroy "anything that moves on the planet", you destroy
the industry/economy/populace you hoped to capture...
    Or had you plaaned on bringing along a couple billion grav cars/
trucks with your invasion force, to replace what was destroyed as
soon as they surrender?

    How do you capture one city?  Without knocking the army out
first?  Sort of like the way the Germans captured Stalingrad?  Or
perhaps the way they captured Leningrad?
    As to surrender, consider that the population doesn\'t do the
surrendering.  The GOVERNMENT does.  And they may be a long way
from giving up just because the people are hungry.  After all,
they KNOW you won\'t destroy them - you want their industry/economy.
That means you can\'t be too rough on them.
    Also, read "Footfall" (Niven/Pournelle) for an example of
just that kind of war (against the USA).  Note that surrender
was not seriously considered by the USA in "Footfall" just
because the transport nets were wrecked, and people were
getting hungry.  Note that in WW2, Germany\'s infrastructure
was demolished without forcing surrender.  The Germans surrendered
after pretty much all their military was destroyed and most of
their country captured...

    Why?  Your plan of campaign will leave you a graveyard anyway.
And letting terrorists/guerrillas operate without reprisals is
likely to cost you both the war and the industry/economy you want.

    Tell you what.  If you want to do this, I\'ll dig up one of
my old TCS players (Sansterre or New Home, hopefully), and I\'ll
referee your assault on a world defended by him.  We\'ll try this
several ways:

    1) exactly even resources.
    2) you get five times the resources he does.
    3) you have ten times the resources he does.
    4) you get same resources, plus one TL.
    5) you get five times the resources plus one TL.
    6) you get ten times the resources plus one TL.
    7) you get the same resources plus TWO TLs.
    8) you get five times the resources plus TWO TLs.
    9+) we keep on with the same pattern till you successfully extract
resources equivalent to two years production from him.

    I\'ve been considering such a game for some time now, and this
looks like a chance to learn something interesting about the Trav
universe...

    Alvin, I\'d like to see the map too.  Can you E-mail me the complete
UWPs/positions of all worlds in the area?  If I can find eight guys
(two supreme commanders/three fleet commanders each), then I\'ll try
to referee that too...

    This sounds like a Star Trek episode.  It is a frankly stupid idea
to ritualize war to the point where it becomes a permanent fixture.
Admittedly, people do really stupid things now and then :-), but the

small...

    Well, no.  Technologically, the Russians were pretty much the equal
of the Germans.  They were doctrinally behind the Germans in their
military (no correspondent to the Panzer Division), but technically
ahead in many ways (their AFVs were generally superior to the German
designs, the Russian service rifle was better, etc.).  Their only real
technical weakness was their poor electronics (their radios were TERRIBLE),
and a poor supply infrastructure which mandatred short, bloody offensives
followed by rebuilding of the force and starting the offensive over -
a wonderful way to ensure that you have to make the "break-out" over
and over and over again, thus increasing casualties to a high degree...
    Hitler was NOT "intimidating" Russia before the attack.  All he was
accomplishing was to give Russia time to modernize their doctrine to
deal with the Blitzkrieg.  Note that Hitler MIGHT have been able to beat
the Russians IFF he had launched Barbarossa on the original schedule,
as opposed to bailing the Italians out in Greece and Yugoslavia first.
    Probably not, but that was his big window of opportunity.

    As to the "threat of war".  Consider the effectiveness of threats
against the Bosnian Serbs.  As opposed to the effectiveness of actual
war against, say, Imperial Japan...

    Well, no. Unless Gov1 is a dictatorship like unto the Soviet Union or
Nazi Germany, it is extremely unlikely that they could have kept their
technological capabilities secret (any more than we can today).  In any
case, living with huge blank spots in their information picture makes a
war MORE likely, not less.  When was the last time that a military
assumed that they were incapable of defeating an unknown enemy.  Especially
one they have defeated regularly for centuries?

    OK.

    This won\'t be a problem if all the body bags are full of guys on the
other side.  After all, you assume that these people HATE each other.
    And a genocidal war will result in massive casualties on the side
being hit, with minimal casualties on the other side.  Unless BOTH sides
get genocidal, in which case PEACE will break out REAL FAST!  Then the
next war will no longer be inevitable...


> The external political situation may not permit this (what if
> the U.S. (or China, later) nuked Vietnam?).

    Bad example.  Vietnam had the Soviets to protect them from American
or Chinese nukes.  Gov2 has no protector to threaten certain destruction
of Gov1 if Gov1 begins a genocidal war on Gov2.


> And exhellation (you know the word I\'m trying to spell) may be
> counter-productive (what if Iraq used poison gas?).

    Again, bad example.  Iraq could have used poison gas, which would
have annoyed the US no end.  And resulted in Iraq getting hit even
harder.  This consideration may not have applied if the war were
between equals.  Note that Soviet war plans assumed the use of gas in
any attack on Nato.  THEY weren\'t really afraid of any meaningful
change in the course of the war as a result of the use of chemical
agents (since they assumed the war would go to the finish no matter
what weapons were used...)

    Damn straight.  And if you play it that way, sooner or later,
someone will hand you your head while you are crying "but they

    Wars were, in fact, fought on Sundays in medieval Europe.  The Pope
tried several times to convince people not to fight under certain
conditions (Sundays, Lent, one whole year one time).  It never worked
out, though...
    And the Chinese so-called "Art of War" was developed to make wars
MORE effective, not LESS.  The elements of the "Art of War" were just
guidelines for commanders to use to do the job well - just like in
Europe, where the "Art of War" was used to describe EFFECTIVE
principles of war-making...

    You seem to have a poor understanding of the power of _Hate_ to
motivate people.
    Also, I should point out that the Trav technology is such as to
allow a Time-On-Target attack against ALL the worlds of the enemy at
once.  Use of a TOT rock shower on every enemy world would reduce the
enemy to non-existance with no real possibility of a counter-strike
being mounted.
    And why would you WANT to hide it?  Making it public is more likely
to convince enemy worlds to surrender without a fight.  A world may be
willing to have a go at resistance IF they THINK you don\'t intend to
destroy them.  They are much less likely to fight back if they KNOW
you are quite willing to sterilize the planet rather than be
inconvenienced...

    Why?  Do they have a hard time bringing the war to the enemy, I mean.
Certainly they have had centuries to prepare by deploying deep-space
refueling sites throughout the enemy territories.  Plus speeding rocks
up to effective speed and stashing them in deep space with J-drives
installed doesn\'t take long - and the rocks can wait there forever if need
be.  They\'ll move, but they can jump back to the baseline position every
century or so to keep them near their targets...

    Sounds like a load of horse-!@#$ to me...
    But then, I\'ve always believed in "Win at any cost".  Perhaps my
time in the military affected me more than most...

    Which style of war?  The basic limit on a "gentlemen\'s war" is that
you stop being a "gentleman" as soon as you start to HATE your 
opponent.  As long as the war is regarded as a game, "gentlemanly"
behaviour can be accepted.  But as soon as you reach the point of
hating, you start the "Kill them all.  God will know his own." phase.
Which ends when you are no longer capable of fighting, or he is...

    I\'ve been playing TCS for YEARS trying to find such a thing.  I
haven\'t found one yet.  The best solution I have seen to the problem
is the one used in the Star Wars RPG - planetary defense shields that
are strong enough to keep ANY conceivable fleet from wrecking the 
world.  Then conquering a world is reduced to putting troops on the
ground to destroy/capture the shield generator, making the worlds
vulnerable to attack - and making surrender the only option.
    Note that "Mote in God\'s Eye" (Niven and Pournelle) used a
similar idea.  Important points on planets were protected by large
Langston Fields, thus making them more or less immune to attack from
space.  Again, conquest became a matter of capturing/destroying the
field generators...


> I want my armies & navies to slug it out, not just commit some 
> comfortable, easy variation of mass murder.

    Well, let\'s look at what worked (sometimes) to keep people from
doing mass-murder in the Islands.  New Home, Sansterre, and Amondiage
all devoted a considerable part of their budget to building LARGE,
fixed planetary defenses.  You might be able to beat their fleets,
but you couldn\'t get through the planetary defenses to hurt the 
worlds without sacrificing the fleet to do it.  It didn\'t work
100%, but it worked a damn sight better than anything else I have
seen...


> Of course, my goal may be technologically impossible, or physically 
> ridiculous.  If so, then I\'m open to any suggestions from the floor.

    Basically, a planetary defense against genocidal attack requires
the following things:

    1)  one of:
        a)  TL-incredibly high (say, 18 or so).
        b)  a change in the "Laws of Physics" of Trav.  Specifically,
the "Jump limit" must be raised from 100 diameters to 1000 diameters.
This will pretty much require that you abandon HePLaR and go back to 
"thruster plates" to make space travel economically viable (the 1000
diameter limit of our solar system is out near Saturn...)  This allows
one to detect incoming attacks a while before they arrive.  Like 
several days, as opposed to the two hours warning you might get if
your opponent goes about wrecking you clumsily (like Amondiage amd
Serendip Belt did against Neubayern, and Serendip Belt did NOT against
the abos on wherever-it-was...
    2)  Then, your planetary defenses must still use up MOST of your
budget.  That way the defenses are good enough to fend off any force
that DOES arrive.  Also, that way the available offensive force is
small compared to the defenses.

    Unfortunately, that also means that conquest of a high-pop, high-tech
world is impossible.
    I have never seen a way to allow conquest of high-tech, high-pop
worlds WITHOUT allowing destruction of them to be even easier...

        Well, yes, if you are incapable of holding a system, and the
resources present are not needed (now or ever), and there are no political
repercussions, then it may well be desirable to neutralize the opposition
by what ever means are expedient. This is not (necessarily) genocide.

        This position is disturbing- not that I\'m accusing you of
(intentionally) a deplorable position, but far too many people seen to
think warfare is a militry activity. It isn\'t- it\'s a political one,
military activities (and considerations) are one of many elements of war
the State must cogitate. Genocide is not a military activity, or, more
specifically, objective- it\'s a political one. The military perspective is
ultimately irrelevant.  That isn\'t to say military personal may not engage
in such activities, but the distinction is important.

        Also, are you confusing mass destruction with genocide? Odd as it
may sound, global nuclear war is not genocide (despite possibly billions
dead), the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans is. I think what you\'re trying
to find is a truism which states that such activities (genocide or mass
destruction) defeat the entire purpose of a conflict, after all, "war is an
act of force to compel our enemy to do our will" (K. Von Clausewitz, On
War).

        Your answer, then, is in that statement- if such activities
interfere with this objective, then it is politically (thus militarily)
stupid. If you\'re worried about mass destruction, then I think the position
"mutually assured destruction" would work (it does, right?). It\'s quite
possible for belligerents to engage in conflict with out "crossing a line".


        If you\'re worried about the military getting out of control and
using such weapons without orders to do so, then don;t let them have it.
Many people in the United States were surprised that Nuclear Weapons are
under civilian control (DOE), not military. The Soviets had a similar
system. Such policies are not fail-safe, but they could help.

        In Traveller,  look at the Droyne (who also use ritualized
conflict, which almost answeres your question), and the Darrians- The
Darrians may well have a star trigger, but just becuase they\'re in a
conflict with the Sword Worlds doesn\'t mean they\'ll use it. The SW\'s know

won\'t wliminate them.

        If you are worried about genocide, then I\'m sorry to say there is
no way to stop this. If one (or all) of the parties to the conflict hate
each other so much that they want to kill them off, then the point of the
conflict will be to do just that. As we are now seeing with Serbia, even
when the political entity want\'s to end hostilities, the hatred is so
prevalent that individuals (Serb units) will continue to kill with whatever
means they have. If your players are so involved in a campaign that they
feel this way, I\'d suggest they get some help ;-)

        Read _On War_, by Karl Von Clausewitz, edited and translated by
Peter Paret and Michael Howard (earlier translations have a fatal flaw).
There are several other texts (hell, there is an entire field) devoted to
similar topics. It\'s helped my campaigns, and prevents players who are
concerened only with tactics and operation strategy in line.

I have some general points I would like to make here, based mostly on 
my formal education in history/philosophy, I know I am making a few 
sweeping generalisations so if anyone can refute what I\'m saying here 
I would be most interested.

Rituals in Warfare:

Ritualised warfare seems to develop between states which are roughly 
equal (equal at least in the sense that no one state has a clear 
ascendancy over the others).  An example of this would be the Spring & 
Autumn period (about 800-400 BC from memory) in Chinese history.  
China. At that stage China had over 300 sovereign polities, by about 
250 BC only a dozen were left.

The "rituals" develop as a "safety measure" which acts to minimise 
your potential loss from any one conflict.  Warfare tends to be 
limited rather than "total", eg rules for prisoner exchanges at the 
conclusion of hostilities.  This is something that I think will hold 
true in the future.

While rituals such as formal mechanisms for declarations of war and 
peace negotiations may be ineffective in brute force equations, in a 
multi-state system the other states not involved in a conflict will 
collectively act to punish the state breaking the rules (eg mass 
slaughter of the rulers of a state tends to upset other aristocrats 
deeply).

Break down of rituals happens when a clear hegemon appears.  Being 
powerful enough to ignore other states "moral-political" force they can 
write their own rules in any given conflict.  This happened with the 
Ch\'in state towards the end of the Warring States period (400-221 BC).
The development of the Legalist school of Philosophy at the time 
encouraged very harsh penalties on those defeated in war.  Both the 
Ch\'in and the Legalists were wiped out by a popular rebellion in the 
reign of the Second Ch\'in Emperor.

Anyway, I think that limited war between Gov1 and Gov2 would be much 
more likely if there were other Gov#s out there.  "Look Gov1 used 
Dino-Killers on Gov2s capital, get him before he gets us!".  If Gov1 
and Gov2 are the main powers then total war is more likely.


Ethics of Warfare:

Modern western war ethics seems to be based on the backlash from the 
extremes of the 30 Years War in Europe (which was an extremely 
unpleasant religious conflict).  The idea of not targeting civilians 
in wars worked for as long as the range of battlefield weapon systems 
was restricted largely to line of sight.  It was not unreasonable for 
civilians to take a picnic lunch to a battle.

Once you get longer range weapons you can no longer determine if their 
are civilians in your target zones.  So you get "collateral damage" no 
matter how hard you try and do it.  Currently this causes a big media 
story and public revulsion.  I would not like to bet a Cr on how views 
on civilian deaths will be like in the future but it seems unlikely 
that mega-deaths will ever be considered acceptable except in rare 
cases (such as ideologically motiviated wars).


Terror Bombing:

I see Terror Bombing of civilians as a weak form of strategic bombing 
(ie when you want to blow up industry but lack the strength, skill or 
technology to do so eg Zeppelin Raids in England in The Great War).

There is a definite moral effect from terror bombing (eg workers 
hiding in subway stations rather than doing a night shift).  Its not a 
decisive weapon by any means but it does affect home front moral and 
production.  

It also causes Governments to do two things.  They will invest a lot 
of resources into protecting the home front (which is the main reason 
why the Germans continued with the Zeppelin raids long after they 
realised Zepps were going out on suicide missions) and they will also 
pour resources into retaliation against the enemy (civilians are more 
likely to stand up to terror bombing if they know that they enemy is 
also suffering).

This is all part of the "jigsaw" by which you can try and overstretch 
your opponents resources.  Strategic bombing didn\'t destroy Germany in 
WWII but it helped (80,000 88mm flak guns defending Cities rather than 
front line Divisions).

So, when you are beseiging a world it is worthwhile to carry out some 
form of bombardment on civilian populations.  If the defender does not 
commit resources to civilian defense then there should be political 
consequences (something which is difficult to implement in an abstract 
game)

I think you can draw a distinction between "terror weapons" and 
"ahniliation weapons".  I have played in a TCS campaign which ended 
with very few survivors because the GM allowed players to deploy bio- 
weapons and dino-killers.  In hindsight some kind of political effect 
in the players state might have reduced the speed with which we 
resorted to rocks and plagues.

Well, let me think of a few things.  The first assumption I will make
is that the attitude of the society towards law enforcement is
something like that of the modern US.  Obviously a police state can
have additional measures in place that are not available to the police
in a society that wouldn\'t approve of, say, small robots that patroll
inside peoples homes listening in on conversations and taking
photographs.

First off, the TL B+ police officer is going to be able to detect much
smaller amounts of foreign substances easily.  For example by TL 15
kilers may be convicted based on the evidence of a single strand of
their DNA found in the (washed) fingernail of their victim.

Collection of physical evidence would be easier.  One advance I\'d
expect to see is a robot that makes extremely high resolution
holograms of the crime scene.  Something with enough resolution to
pick up a human hair and even have some data about it, (i.e. color,
length, basic cross-sectional shape).  This device could probably also
pick up fingerprints.  Obviously this wouldn\'t be
simple, but would be no more difficult than the efforts of todays FBI
crime lab.  This could be done on a lesser scale for less important
cases.  Some imagination would be required to guess at how difficult
this would be at a given TL and what resources the police are willing
to put into it.  Very rarely is a full FBI crime lab style
investigation carried out for a simple purse-snatching.

Data processing should be sufficiently advanced that a computer could
take this hologram and perform the more mechanical aspects of
searching for clues, i.e. matching fingerprints, hairs, etc to each
other and to known databases.  

Probably "chemical" techniques could pick up the residues left in the
air, or that settled on surfaces around the crime scene (dead skin
cells, body oils, etc).  Perhaps by remote spectroscopic techniques.
The hologram robot might be able to do this too.

Vacc suits when committing a crime?  A good cover story as to why (as
the physical evidence so clearly shows) they had contact with the
victim/crime scene?  A good lawer to get them off on legal tricks?
Forged evidence, "But the court will see that defense exhibit #3 shows
that clearly the defendant was on Aramis when the crime occured."
Obviously a sucessful crime will require even more forethought and
planning.

I\'m sure there will be hundreds of developments along these lines.  

eg, from the news of the wierd mailing list:
* At a June open house, officials at the Sandia National
Laboratories demonstrated its latest law enforcement technology,
including strobe lights that make criminals disoriented and
nauseous (but Sandia has not yet perfected eye shields to immunize
police officers from the light), a receiver inside an officer\'s
gun so he can disable it if a criminal steals it, and a gun that
shoots out a goo so sticky (actually developed by a guy named Tom
Goolsby) that it completely immobilizes the target. [Albuquerque
Journal, 6-3-94]

Sadly I can\'t seem to do better than the real world...

Asteroid worlds, vaccum worlds, worlds with signifigant populations on

Depends on the nature of the police, and the planets they are
operating from/on.  The imperium is likely to consider the debate
between two planets over whether planet A "arrested" or "kidnapped" the
citizen of planet B.  

I would imagine extradition treaties were pretty common.

Truth drugs of unbelievable usefulness.  Use of high technology to
produce falsified evidence.

>The best police?  

I view the qualifier "best" in police work to mean honest, hard
working, dedicated.  These qualities will be largely independant of
TL, but obviously the higher TL police will, all other things equal,
catch more criminals.

Set a trap for the pirate (Harry Turtledove did a nice story about
some roman vigiles catching some time travelling bad guys).  Or, just
fill out the paperwork to have him extradited from the TL 15 planet
next door next time he stops in to refuel :-)

Well, obvioulsy their patrols are gonna be somewhat different as are
the problems they encounter.  But most of the crimes they encounter
will occur in the places where people live, which are likely to be
pretty similar.

About the same as those between a mexico city patrollman, and a IRS
auditor.  Their jobs will have very little in common, aside from the
occasional trip to court.

>Could a low-tech cop even hope to deal with high-tech fraud?  

Certainly, if the people committing the fraud screw up.  i.e. forget
to alter the tax returns, or one of their accomplices fesses up to his
role in the scam.

        In principle, the DOE has control over production and storage of
all nuclear materials, including weapons. They are sort of like an official
watch-dog group. This was set up under Truman (with a Republican Congress
;-), partly in reaction to Gen. MacAurthurs\' deplorable behavior. In
practice, power is spread throughout the Department of State, DOE, and DOD,
with the DOE more-or-less ont eh short end. I should have been more clear
on this. There was a fair bit of debate on this topic in Washington
recently, and the transfer of weapon control to the DOD from DOE was one
possibility to reduce executive costs (if they had trasferred control, it
was probable that the DOE would have been eliminated entirely).

> The President is the only civilian who controls the USE of nukes.

        Absolutely not true, at least in peace time, anyway. The president
may authorize the use of (strategic) nuclear weapons in an emergency only,
otherwise the consent of Congress is needed. Also note that the presidents
cabinet could - in principle - belay the order, declare the president unfit
for ofiice, and have the VP (now P) cancel the order.

        Also, if, say during the Gulf conflict, Congress got a bug up it\'s
ass and decided to nuke Iraq, and passsed legislating dictating the use of
such force. Assume enough votes were present to override a veto, the pres
would be forced to use the weaons. Congress is a civilian power, last I
checked.

        To be fair, the chances of another MacAurthur - or a president -
using such weapons without congressional approval (and getting away with
it) are much higher than a congressional - or cabinet - override.

        You\'d be surprised how military looking some civies get for some
occupations. Ofcourse exceptions were made for the use of nuclear weapons-
absolute adherence to what I detailed above would have crippled two legs
(subs and land launched ICBM\'s) of the nuclear triad, and hampered the
third, making the "Mutualy Assured Destruction" strategy the "Possibly
Mutualy Assured Destruction" strategy.

        Thank God they did! One only needs to look at Chechen and how the
military is ignoring Yeltson to see the wisdom of that system.

        The prez may be the CiC, but Congress had curtailed such power
considerably (eg, the War Powers Act).

    C\'mon!  A lethal flu virus?  Big deal!  Remember the influenza
epidemic of 1919?  It killed MILLIONS worldwide...

    As to setting up defenses.  There is no practical solution.  Unless 
TOTAL control of local space is maintained (no merchant traffic, etc),
then someone can get in.  Even if total control is maintained, someone
can probably deliver such a virus...
    One problem you have is that any solution that protects a planet from
large kinteic kill weapons (thrown rocks) will also serve as a protection
against pretty much any Fleet that wants to try attacking the world.  Which
makes conquest of the neighbors pretty much impossible. 
     My own opinion is that the most likely solution is the MAD solution we
used with the Soviets - our citizens are held hostage by them for our
government\'s good behaviour.  And vice versa.  Not an appetizing picture.

     And Colchis, of course.  The relatively low TL of your systems
would have weakened your defenses, but the only real reason I
didn\'t include Colchis in the Siege of the Islands was that you had
been out of touch for a long time when that point came along...:-)

     Quite.  The tactics were good because *I* could work those out (in 
my position as "arbiter of vague orders").  The strategic followthrough
was lacking due to an unfortunate tendency of the player to believe that
you all in the Alliance believed everything said by him/her...WRONG! ;-)

    Meaningless.  BOTH sides have BILLIONS.  Probably hundreds
of billions.  No conceivable force by either side could be built which
required more than a VERY small fraction of their total population
to operate.   I note from TCS (again!) that typical fleets (the 
Amondian one is easiest to calculate, since they used only two
types of ship) required total personnel on the order of 0.025%
of the population.  Sansterre and Neubayern had more troop
carriers (which are intensive of crew), but even they didn\'t get
above 0.1% of total population...

    Which will only work if you can convert billions to your POV.
Which would be a lot easier to understand if it wasn\'t for the 
detail that these guys LEFT Gov1 because they didn\'t like Gov1\'s
policies much...Not that it is impossible, but improbable.  Note
that if *I* were in charge of Gov2, then absorption of the buffer
state would start the alarm bells ringing in my mind, and 
strategic surprise by Gov1 would then be impossible.

    Why bother?  You can pass through and refuel at the gas
giant if you want to (and are clumsy enough not to have deep
space bases to refuel at), but taking/retaking the dirtball is
meaningless strategically.  Remember, I will NEVER have to
pass though that system (or, indeed, ANY system outside my
home system) unless I choose.  And making the choice to
do so is mostly pretty stupid...Sort of like cpaturing Grand Isle
before beginning an airborne attack on New Orleans...;-)

    If a "great Admiral" did that, he wouldn\'t be great, he\'d be an
idiot!  A Great Admiral knows that the war isn\'t going to be won
by taking real estate, but by beating the other guy\'s fleet/army.
    Note that in WW2, we took little islands back from the Japanese
ONLY if they were useful to us at the time.  We bypassed any
islands that had no specific strategic value.  Note that "strategic
value" was defined in terms of our capabilites at the time (if the 
B36 had been available then, it is likely that NONE of those islands
would have been taken except those with LARGE Jap fleet bases.
It is possible that even those would have been ignored...

       Storage and production I can believe.  Not use.  Note that the DOE has
no REAL control of deployment of weapons on the SSBNs...


>> The President is the only civilian who controls the USE of nukes.

>        Absolutely not true, at least in peace time, anyway. The president
>may authorize the use of (strategic) nuclear weapons in an emergency only,
>otherwise the consent of Congress is needed.

     Incorrect.  Congress has only two powers as regards use of the military
:
       1)  they control the budget.  Without congressional approval, it don\'t get
bought or paid for.
        2)  they may declare war.  Note that declare war is NOT synonymous with
"fight war".  Witness Vietnam, Korea, the Gulf War...

     The President is the ONLY civilian in the Chain of Command of the military,
and therefore the ONLY civilian who may give orders to the military.  The President
MAY, at HIS descretion, delegate some of his authority to others.  The "Two Man Rule"
is a good example.  Nukes will not be launched in ordinary circumstances without 
confirmation of a Presidential order by another government official (who may be
a member of Congress, but need not be.  As far as I know, the only requirement  is
that the guy be subject to Senate Confirmation for his post - there may be
others.)
    Note that in an emergency (the USA is under nuclear attack is the only valid one 
O know of), the President may order the use of nukes on his own authority without
confirmation of the order.


> Also note that the presidents
>cabinet could - in principle - belay the order, declare the president unfit
>for ofiice, and have the VP (now P) cancel the order.

      Check your Constitution.  The Cabinet may only declare the President unfit if
the Vice-President agrees.  The Congress may do so also (it\'s called "Impeachment").
Note also that Cabinet approval (or even knowledge) of the order (to use nukes) is 
NOT required.
     Note that if the President is declared incompetent by the VP and Cabinet, then
he may declare himself competent (thus throwing the issue to the Congress).  His
declaration of competence theoretically means that he resumes the powers of
the Presidency immediately, though there are ambiguities in the 25th (?)
Amendment that MAY require that the issue be settled by the Supreme Court
should the Amendment ever be invoked.
     Note also that when the VP becomes the P, he may then give the order in his
own right, again, without the approval of either the Cabinet or the Congress.
     Note also that once a VP has taken over in that fashion, he may only be 
removed by either Act of Congress, or restoration of the President.  He may 
NOT be removed by the Cabinet, since they no longer have a VP to front for
them (and the VP is required for declaration of incompetence).

     Congress has no legal authority to specify the force used by our military in
any conflict.  They may exert control only through their power to limit the military
budget (which does not apply in use of existing weapons - only in building new
ones).  Again, read your Constitution...

>        To be fair, the chances of another MacAurthur - or a president -
>using such weapons without congressional approval (and getting away with
>it) are much higher than a congressional - or cabinet - override.

     Actually, the internal military safeguards against misuse of nukes is such
as to prevent "another MacArthur" from doing so.  At least, not without the 
cooperation of several dozen to several hundred other officers NOT under
his direct command.  As to Presidential misuse, the ONLY real safeguard 
currently in place is the "Two Man Rule", and the remote possibility of a 
military man so ordered refusing to obey the order (which IS legal, in 
certain circumstances, and expected/required in those circumstances 
(guessing whether the circumstances apply is one of the things that can
give an officer grey hair))

    We do NOT know that the military is ignoring Yeltsin.  Only that Yeltsin
is getting some of the heat diverted from himself by SAYING they are
ignoring him.  They may be.  They may not be.  It is unlikely we will 
EVER know for sure...

    Check your Constitution again.  Congress has NO Constitutional authority
to curtail the President\'s power in that way.  Note that NO President has EVER
acknowledged the Constitutionality of the War Powers Act, nor has any 
President ever obeyed it.  Note specifically that Bush asked Congress for
permission to beat up on Iraq, but that he said at the time that he was going
to go ahead and do it even if Congress refused permission.

I think that was probably just mentioned as an example: take the good old
filo-virus (probably spelt wrong) found in certain monkeys. Anyone in the UK
might have seen Network First a coupl\'a weeks back which said of the 3
outbreaks which have occured in humans (from contact with monkeys being
shipped for lab use, etc.) the first had a 30% kill rate, the second a 90%
kill rate and the third was not lethal. But, the first two spread by any
body fluid contact and the third was AIRBORNE. Combine numbers 2 & 3 and you
probably get annihilation better than the Virus could do. NASTY!
Interestingly, the African tribes people who caught it contained it by
isolating the ill and shutting off their villages from outsiders. It was
pointed out that that just wouldn\'t happen in a modern city [good plot here?
- who dares enter the Plague Zones of the city?]. When the US outbreak
occurred in a science lab holding huge numbers of the monkeys in pens, the
US military moved in in their space suits only to find some lab staff still
wandering around the corridors unaware of the potential airborne death
around them! The lab was eventually gassed (to kill everyone of the hundreds
of monkeys) but none of the staff were confined in any way. If they had
contracted a slower acting but lethal version of the virus, then millions
could have died. It\'s comparable with the idiotic manner in which the first
astronauts were brought back from the moon: no proper quarantine or
anything! They were stuck in a little chamber to gaze out at the
over-grateful pres. Nixon but had walked there, taken off their suits,
talked to other unprotected staff... what if there had been a lethal
contaminant/virus/etc. sitting quietly on the moon? Back to Earth - now
filo-virii (ha, bet that\'s got at least 5 spelling mistakes in it) - that\'s
just old Mother Nature, so God alone knows what the biological warfare
people could do. Then there\'s simple nerve gas, etc.

First: Steve H., you are absolutely correct.  Ritual\'s _may_ work if 
both sides agree, and the stakes arn\'t too high, thus making fairness an 
attainable goal.  It *won\'t* work between civilizations that loath each 
other to the extent that I have postuated. 

(Hang\'s head in shame for valuing theory over reality, a FATAL mistake 
for any admiral wannabe...)

Second, and more interesting: I have already said that I\'m upgrading my 
Gov1 navy fron TL C to TL F.  One reason is that Gov1 can\'t really fight 
a war with anything less; another reason is that if they had anything 
less, Gov2 would have sterilized them centuries ago.

New Assumption: The navy of Gov1 is about the same size and "weight" as 
the navy of Gov2.  The larger amount of people that Gov1 has is offset by 
their lower tech level (and thus, the smaller per capita amount of TL F 
Dollars sent to the navy). 

Since you don\'t have the UWP codes, I only want to know if the above 
assumption *can* be a valid, reasonable one.

Question: what are the benefits and problems of a TL F navy in a TL C-F 
civilization?  One thing that immediately comes to mind is those low-tech 
ports: the Gov1 navy will be quite dependent on their naval basis, 
compaired to Gov2.

----

Associated question: It seems absolutely necessary for Gov1 to siege the 
buffer state first for the sake of all those yummy, high-tech ports.  
What I want to know is how long it would take to annex the buffer state 
assuming warfare, and how long to repair the annexed civilization to it\'s 
previous state: a guesstimate will do, since you all still lack the UWP 
codes.  Assume genocidal warfare is possible, but the idea is conquest, 
not extermination.  

----

By the way...

If I had kept Gov1\'s navy at TL C, how long would it take for them to 
conquer the TL F buffer state?  Or would the state win (which would occur 
if they destroyed 1/4 of Gov1\'s navy, at a cost of 1/8 or less of the 
buffer state\'s navy.)

----

It seems that all major interstellar wars are at least partially 
genocidal, not necessarily because of the hatred involved, but simply 
because of the kind of defenses and weaponry involved.  Well, as Steve H. 
would say, this isn\'t a parlour game.

----

This would make an interstellar war a very high-risk venture, with 
uncertain rewards - up to a point.  Warfare between large and small 
states of equal tech would be rare: the small state will quickly look 
for decent surrender conditions.  Warfare between states of large tech level 
differences (ie TL C, TL E) would also be rare: the lower-tech state is 
well advised to get along with it\'s high-tech neighbour, or face a 
disasterous war.

The "uncertain rewards" actually comes in only when states of equal size 
and tech face each other, or if a large low-tech state attacks a small 
high-tech state.  A question: how much can tech compensate for size?  Any 
ratio\'s, anyone?

And thank you all for your comments.  I\'ve heard a lot, and expect to 
hear even more as I make more mistakes.  I only hope that I don\'t repeat any.

    You suppose correctly.  You also overlook the possibility

    Yes, it is a valid, reasonable assumption.  Certainly well within the
range of possibility...

    Benefits:  your Navy might be able to win battles.  It\'ll be
generally faster, more powerful, and more mobile than the "civilian"
traffic.  This includes pirates/privateers/commerce raiders.
    Problems:  relatively few yards building ships for your Navy makes
you more vulnerable than you might otherwise be.  On the other hand,
taking that into account when putting together your fleets/forces 
can make you LESS vulnerable, thus moving this into the "benefits"
column.

    From what I have seen in TNE and FF&S, dependency on bases/yards
is not nearly so restrictive as it was in earlier forms of the game.
Maintenance may be done "in the field" if parts are provided, and
highly skilled engineering crew are available (all "blue-water"
Navies should have this as a matter of course)

    Note also that, as a matter of course, the generic TLF yard does
NOT keep around parts for the Lewiston Mk17 115.6T NPAWS.  So any
significant battle damage will be dealt with in the small number of
yards used by the Navy regularly, or the Navy bases...

    It is NOT absolutely necessary, given a couple decades of
preparation.  BUT, given that you want to do it:

    The Key to the question is just how many high-pop, TLF yards are
you after?  And how many such worlds do you have to take them away with?
    Given that you can muster TWO TLF yards (high-pop), OR one TLF
yard PLUS two TLE yards (all high-pop), it will take around five years
per TLF yard (world) you want to take away.  Note that you will
probably have to take ALL of them, since the buffer state will probably
not give up just because you took one of their worlds.
    Add ten to twenty years after that to rebuild those worlds.  Note
that if you only need one yard, then you may be able to rebuild MUCH
faster - say two to five years...
    Of course, fifth columns could significantly change this.  One way 
or another.  And the tactical/strategic objectives of the buffer
state will have an overwhelming effect on the process.
    But that\'s my best guess, given some TCS experience, plus the
information provided in CT, MT, TNE...

    They could NEVER conquer the buffer state with a TL12 Navy of ANY
size.  It is likely that a TL15 Navy (well-designed) will be able to
destroy 1/4 of the TL12 Navy with losses of no major warships, and
no more than a few dozen minor ships.  NO matter how big the TL12 
Fleet is.
    I note, fyi, that in the battles between TL13 New Home and TL12
Sansterre, New Home lost around ten 500T "warships" (actually built 
to expend the last few credits of the starting funds).  Sansterre lost
several thousand fighters, plus one 900,000T Assault ship.  Plus heavy
damage to every other unit in their Fleet.

    Right!  But *I* actually don\'t believe that most interstellar 
wars are genocidal, even slightly.  I believe in the notion that
"war is an extension of politics by other means".  Which means we
need to decide what the strategic objective of the war is as the
first step.
    Once we know the strategic objective, we can decide whether
war is a useful method to achieve this goal.  It probably isn\'t in
space war.  If it is, then specific methods can then be worked out
to achieve the goal...
    These methods may or may not require genocidal techniques.  I
tend to think not, myself.

    The problem you are seeing is the difficulty of DECISIVE WAR
occurring without genocidal conflict.  I agree that the probability
of a decisive war (like the one we fought in 1941 thru 1945) is
pretty slim given the capabilities in Trav.  However, note that
we were unable to execute any decisive wars during the entire life-
time of the "Evil Empire".  The Gulf War (as decisive as any I\'ve 
read of) only happened because the collapse of the Soviet Union had
passed the point of no return by that time.
    For that matter, note that no wars in history which WERE decisive
were NOT genocidal.  To one degree or another.  There have been few
wars in history that left both sides substantially intact (with only
changes in allegiance affecting the civilian populace) that were also
decisive...
    Note also that wars between equals are seldom decisive.

    Depends on specific technologies, actually.  Meson weapons, for
instance, upset the balance badly.  If a TL13 civilization developed
meson weapons, and fought a TL15 civilization without meson weapons,
the TL13 civilization will probably win.  In High Guard rules.  In MT
rules, the TL15 civilization will win in spite of the meson weapons.
I don\'t know about TNE.
    But, for generic high tech civilizations, using HG rules, I think
the following equations are pretty good:


    TL      15  14  13  12  11  10   9

        15   1
        14   2   1
        13  10   2   1
        12  1C  50   5   1
        11  1K  5C  20   3   1
        10   *  1K  5C  25   2   1
         9   *   *   *  5C  10   2   1

where (*) = don\'t bother, the lower TL people lose.  Every time.

    A lot depends on the exact ship mix involved.  A well-designed
fighter of a given TL can fight anything short of a battleship two
TLs lower to a draw, AT LEAST!  But those numbers do NOT assume 
fighters...because:

    This does try to take into account jump-capability, which has
nothing to do with combat ability per se.  But Jump affects strategic
mobility in big ways, and is a big force multiplier when looking at
large-scale actions spread across many solar systems...

        SHHH!!! How dare you say such heresy! We all know HIV is the worst

a fair amount of deaths in the third world.

        As for viruses- screw viruses that require the target population as
a host. Make one that uses their food source. My current (real-world)
research is one such virus (Geminivirus), and I\'m seeing endless
possibilities for this type of warfare (I\'m NOT doing biological warfare,
just letting my mind draw possibilities from my research to control this
"pest"). This method, in addition to bringing a population to it\'s knees,
has the advantage that once they surrender, you can "rescue" them - and
have a viable industrial base to work with, which is the point, right? No
glory in ruling rubble.

        If an opponent accomplished this, I\'d just develop a mass
accelerator that could accelerate a smallish package (possibly even a nuke)
to very high G\'s, the package containing the virus. While the majority of
such packages would de destroyed during atmospheric entry, eventualy one
would make it (if it was made correctly). Also, just infect the crew of one
of the defending vessels during an attack. Tricky, but possible.

        If you\'re still find the idea appealing, why not create societies
which hate each other, and want to go on hating each other. They may clash
regularly, but they wont go too far, since it\'s quite possible for a vastly
inferior (in technology and population) society to hold it\'s own. Witness
the various revolutions this century. Ireland is a great example.

        Fatal mistake for anything... but better to hang head in shame that
to have it hanging of the end of a bayonet, but...

        ... both your Gov\'s and "reality" (i.e. Traveller) are theoretical
constructs... since there is no way to experimentaly verify these (at least
for another 36 centuries :-) - and if the idea isn\'t too goofy - it\'s OK.

        Continuing from my postulate above, it\'s one thing to neutralize an
opponet. It quite another to have a submissive population. Also, suppose
Gov2 (tech F, right?) takes Gov1. In a few months (years) what to stop the
Gov1LO from randomly nuking Gov2 cities (i.e terrorism). Hell, a tech7
world could do this. Nothing like a spoilsport :-)

        I think it\'d be better for Gov2 to dominate Gov1 politically, this
means diplomacy, commerce, and, occationaly, a little war or two. For
conflicts I\'m thinking of something like the Franco-Prussian war, or,
perhaps, how The Great Frog handled the Hapsburg Monarchy before FUBARed
his Russian canpaign.

        Yes (more or less).

        Assuming Gov1\'s "low-tech" populations are productive (i.e. not
like the Soviet Union or China), then it may well have an advantage.
Remember, tomorrows wars are fought with the weapons of yesterdays. Gov1
will have a core of top-of-the-line vessels, with plenty of lower tech
vessels providing "bulk" could hold on for quite some time, possibly enough
to take Gov2, or at the very least force a stalemate. I just hope you don\'t
have only one or two Agricultural worlds feeding your high-population
industrial worlds. That could get ugly (for Gov1).

        Gunboat diplomacy may be your best solution here- or even better,
make the buffer state a belligerent neutral, in Gov1\'s favor. If there is a
war, now Gov2 needs to take the buffer state to get to you- and you get an
ally, to boot.

        I don\'t know, but even if Gov1 did win, they\'d probably be weakened
enough that they\'d but an easy target for Gov2.

        Pretty much the same risk we are now entering- any potential
conflict could result in several of our cities destroyed. If you are saying
the (mythical) gentleman\'s conflict is gone, you\'re right.

        The first possibily is a game of Russian Roulette- except the state
with more vessles has more bullets chambered (but again, don\'t forget
spoilsports). The second example was covered above.

        The former scenario would likely result in a stalemate, since their
economies would collapse. The latter scenario could vary widely, depending
on the tech discrepency- but when the possibility of one of the states
falling becomes real, it becomes a game of brinksmanship, now and forever.

suggest that worrying over the exact TLs, etc. is perhaps a little too
specific...
If these two really loath each other that Gov1 is happy to walk through a
buffer state and try to maintain a war with his supply route running through
said buffer subsectors (fat chance - cut-off from the homeworlds is a
certainty), and given that Gov1 knows its TL is lower than Gov2... then only
a mad man actually tries to Blitzkrieg across such a large area of space.
If you get there fast, you\'ll surprise the enemy but your back-up fleets
will be miles behind and probably get wiped by the buffer state or Gov2
counterattack.
If you move the entire fleet at normal speed, by the time you reach Gov2,
it\'ll be waiting with every possible ship and probably have agreed a
multi-state strike with the buffer state that\'ll wipe you out.
As per usual, it\'s a case of slowing things down and biding your time. If
this stalemate has been going on for years then Gov1 ought to have done a
helluva lot of undercover stuff before it even thinks about attacking, e.g.
1. infiltrate the buffer govt to sow dissension and try to win back support
for Gov1 vs. Gov2.
2. infiltrate Gov2 governemnt to create splits, particularly between the
centre and outlying worlds (strikes, riots, racial hatred, anything they can
think of).
3. steal every known secret (military, economic, etc.) from gov2.
4. steal every known secret from the buffer gov but using even better agents
than in 3. because you can\'t afford to upset the buffer govt.
5. Incite some border clashes between the buffer worlds and gov2.
6. Find something that the buffer worlds REALLY need, e.g. a supply of super
jump drives or Sega megadrives - get their population really hooked on you

7. Embrace any odd religions in the buffer state or gov2. In gov2, prepare
anyu oddball group you can find as potential revolutionaries when the time
comes to attack gov2.
8. Well, you get the idea, I hope.
By the time gov1 comes to attack gov2, it ought to have made the buffer
state happy to accept the fleet passing through (add a huge bribe to govt
officials and throw in a free TL15 battleship or something). Blitzkrieg
across to gov2, simultaneously inciting every possible rioter or rebel
across the gov2 worlds. In such circumstances, attacking with a modicum of
surprise, gov1 might win without being wiped out.

BUT... that\'s all assuming gov2 isn\'t already planning the same thing which,
given they already have the buffer govt on their side, would be a lot easier
to do.

And at extremely high velocity too!  Assuming (as we must) that 
conservation of mass-energy holds, a rock could be accelerated
to an incredible speed before being put into jumpspace.  It appears
100 diameters out from your world, moving so fast that you have
but minutes to do something about it.  Muuuuaaaaaaahhhhhhh!

On the other hand, I can see where being part of a group that in none too
few places it\'s socially acceptable to beat them half to death (or maybe all 
the way) or where peoples\' reaction to news of their fatal disease is "GOOD"
might lead to a certain seige mentality...

Of course, if they had nukes, that mentality might make them good spoilsports

Sorry if I sound, um, "PC" myself.  I\'ve seen the phrase used for everything
clique-y student groups (where it approaches its original meaning) to
supporting claptrap like Holocaust revisionism or "The Bell Curve" as
anti-PC.  At least to my ears, it\'s become a epithet meaning "something-I-
don\'t-like-that\'s-kinda-sorta-lefty-like", which is a bit of an odd thing to
call someone who is considered to place doctrine and name-calling over
reality and reasoned argument.

Just grates a bit to let it pass by without comment. Political discourse
is vapid enough without throwing more mud into the swamp.

It gets even worse at TL F+, when the "Rock" activates a Black
Globe as soon as it emerges from Jumpspace and becomes *invisible*
until it\'s way too close to do anything about it.

in xboat digest 148, erwin@fritz.cuug.ab.ca wrote about accelerating 
rocks to high velocities....

Sending it through jump is all very well but accelerating it up to high 
speeds before entry into jump is a bit pointless - the problem is that 
when you exit from jump you will more than likely miss the planet - you 
will be going in excess of the escape velocity of the planet, especially 
if Earth is larger than average (2d6-2, roll of a ten resulting in 8000 
mi diameter).  Most worlds will have a lower escape velocity than Earth.

Result - one new large meteor in an elliptic orbit, and one close call.

The only way around this is to EXTENSIVELY survey the target system prior 
to attack, which an associate of mine did back a few years in a very 
large and somewhat unbalanced campaign set in the Old Expanses sector 
(well thought of Aaron).  Only then can the rock be brought out of jump 
space at the correct place, after some hideous computer calculations and 
last second updates.

I don\'t know why anyone would think it\'s hard to target a world with a
high speed rock dropped when you emerge from jump.  Normal navigation
requires you to know where the planet is and where it\'s going so
you can rendezvous and land.  Rock-bombinb is at worst
equally difficult, you just have to arrive at 100 diam with a vector pointed
through the world.

At best, you jump to further out and spend a few days (or more or less)
correcting the vector when you arrive.

I\'ve been reading the thread Alvin started, and it has us very interested at
the office.  The whole "throwing rocks" question (the bio weapons aren\'t even
in the same league) is facinating as it relates to our known traveller
universe.

One idea posted was to figure out why this *doesn\'t* happen.  Since as I recall
the original scenario talked about was to be CT with the TNE system, at least
small, jump capable rocks won\'t be able to get to relativistic velocities (but
in CT, the common scout ship could be a planet killer (I\'ll have to do the math
one of these nights).

The fact that you can wreak a planet with KE weapons means that even a little
despot could threaten nasty retaiation... maybe that explains the looseness of
Imperial control.  Larger political groupings would fear retaliation in kind,
and the result would be much like the superpower supported conventional wars
we all know about from this time period.  (the notion of a TOT attack against
any large (Imp or Zho) enemy is unlikely)

I guess this also explains the constant "little" wars being fought over the span
of Imperial history.  

As an aside, someone talked about meson sites attacking the rocks tossed at them
It is interesting to note that you could attack a planetary deep meson site by
having the attaking ships close on the planet on a collision course. Shooting
them with the meson gun would be worse for the planet\'s population than letting
them attack (any crippled ship would be *nasty* dead-fall bombardment at 100+
km/sec)

    Yeah.  And using HE missiles to break up a rock the size of
Rhode Island...give me a break!

    As to how fast, pick a number you like.  I\'m fond of 1500Km/s
myself.  Typical time to impact is nine minutes from time of
appearance that way.  Impact energy of on the order of 100
gigatons of TNT for a 10,000 displacement ton rock...
     And, of course, if we use CT/MT, then a velocity/impact
energy of 25,000Km/s / 1 Teraton is not too unreasonable...

    I see your deep meson sites are kept on Red Alert at all 
times.  Otherwise, the two second time is not too practical.
    Note that four months can get you  a rock moving at 1/3c.
That give you 8 or 9 seconds to react, including 2 to 3 seconds 
for the detector net to even DETECT the rock.  Six seconds to
go to Red Alert and get a fire-control solution.   Good luck.

    Given the 1500Km/s rock I mentioned in a previous missive,
you\'d need a meson gun that can output at something like
100,000 TERAWATTS to get a clean miss.  At LEAST!
    So the mountain is radioactive when it hits...:-)

I beg to differ - to HIT the target planet won\'t be that difficult. The 
information needed is available in any astrogation data program. The 
planets in the target system won\'t shift, so any reasonably accurate data 
set (like those that merchants use for general astrogation) will do just 
fine.

If you are concerned, a small computer, a large radar set (low power) and 
a set of nukes placed about the back surface of the rock will do:

1. Rock comes through, turns of radar.

2. Rock determines location and direction of planet, compares to rocks 
   current vector.

3. If not on target (should be awful close), fire nukes required for 
   appropriate thrust.


BTW, those deep meson sites need to power up, not to mention that a 
series of humans need to (in order):
1. recognize a threat
2. verify that it is a threat.
3. Pass info up command chain

Just how accurate are jumps supposed to be?  If a jump is off by just a hair,
it\'ll miss the target.  Also, if it is given a high velocity before jump, its
ability to change that velocity vector in a short time period would be small.

BTW, if we\'re talking CT, then the \'rock\' doesn\'t have to be big, just
relativistic...  maybe it would reach the threshold where its own gravity
would
need to be accounted for (it\'d have to be 100 diameters from itself ;)

If we\'re using either TNE, or house TNE-like space combat (we\'ve had fusion
maneuver drives improve above TL9) you still have limited delta-V so at least
the rocks have to be big :)

PS-I\'d need to pull out some of my astrophysics texts, but anyone know what
it\'d
take to shatter a small planet?

    'body' => 'I\'ve been following the discussions on thrown rocks, tech level 
differences, so here\'s my two-peneth.

Tech Level differences:
Tech level differences of a few points won\'t make that much difference.  
What has far more effect is the quality, motivation, and iginuity of the 
troops.

In Vietnam the US far outclassed the Vietcong technologically, but were 
effectively beeten in the field.  The Vietcong were very motivated, and 
very, very ingenious booby trap makers.  They even came up with a homemade
anti-helicopter mine!

There\'s an old quote (I think from an American general), that goes...
	"If the British were as well equipped as the US, their troops 
	 wouldn\'t be anything like as good as they are now"
The British military doesn\'t have as much access to high tech kit in any 
quantity.  So the emphsis has to be on the skills of the troops.  If the 
US Marines were to take on the Royal Marines, I know where I\'d put my 
money.

In any event taking hostile teritory, is very difficult (if you want 
anything left at the end).  Look at the Russian forces in Chetchenyar, 
though it looks as though they may take the city, it will be rubble, and 
then they have years of fighting guerilla forces in the surrounding 
countryside.

I Played a Striker campagn some years ago.
My opponent had a large Millitia, mainly mechanised infantry, and 
supporting units.

My force was Elite, a tenth of the size.  Mainly on foot or horse (at 
tech-8 !).

Although outnumbered and outgunned, I took the field.

Incidently the horse borne troops were very useful.  They could go 
anywhere that a man on foot can, ie. where vehicles cannot go, at a 
faster speed.  So using hit-and-run tactics, I was able to make several 
attacks, and then evade the opposing troops, who had to go on foot, and 
make a second attack behind the infantry before they could return

Rocks:
I agree that the astrogation data needed to hit a planet is trivial, but 
performing the navigation accuratly enougth is a bit harder, though not 
imposible, military ships will routinely navigate to the standards 
required.

Why do rocks need to go that fast, even at moderate speeds (someone 
quoted 9min warning), by the time the threat has been confirmed, 
permission to fire given, and the firing solution locked, the rock will 
be so close that you wouldn\'t be able to do much.

Nuclear explosions, and meason weapons won\'t shift a rock sideways that 
much.  A warhead detonating on the surface will have most of its force 
expended outward in a hemisphere, the actual component perpendicular to 
the line of flight will be small.  Ditto meason weapons.

The best use of meson weapons is to fragment the rock, then use nuclear 
warheads to vapourise what you can.  The task being to break the rock up 
into small enougth portions to burn up on re-entry, and/or cause minimal 
damage.

Using mesons to cause _interior_ explosions could provide enougth of a 
sideways component to cause fragments to pass _either_side_ of your 
planet.  Very steady nerves needed.

> but anyone know what it\'d take to shatter a small planet?
Probably quite large.
One of Jupiters moons (I forget the name) shows a 
huge fracture, it was split at one point be held together under its own 
gravity.

Why bother spitting a planet anyway?  A good rock will cause large scale 
damage at the impact point.  May introduce enough siesmic energy to 
unlock major faults (san-andreas like ones).  And the lensing effect of 
the planets core, may refocus the siesmic waves from the impact, to a 
point antipodal to it, causing a Major explosion, earthquake etc at this 
point as well.

If you badly hurt a planet, but leave a good portion alive.  Think of all 
the rersources, ships, manpower, supplies,  that have to be diverted to 
it for relief operations.

I think it was more a matter of the U.S. fighting a contemporary offensive
war in terrain which heavily favored defensive guerilla tactics.  The U.S.
goal was to defeat the VC.  The VC goal was to hang on until the U.S. got
tired and left.

The British ran into the same problem during the U.S. Revolutionary war.
Marching on roads in perfect formation isn\'t very conductive to survival
when your enemy shoots at you from inside forests.

Note that in terrain which favors contemporary offensive war-making (or
disfavors guerilla tactics depending on how you think of it), i.e. the
Gulf war, the U.S. did spectacularly.

The energy transferred by a hemispherical explosion is a bear to calculate,
but the answer and concept turns out to be pretty simple.  Just project the
hemisphere onto a plane (i.e. a circle) and use that as the surface area
the energy flux goes through (all of it perpendicular).  So for a
hemispherical explosion the ratio of useful energy transferred to total
energy generated is the ratio between area of a circle to the area of a
hemisphere is the ratio between pi*r^2 to 2pi*r^2 or 50%.  Obviously you
want this offset 90 degrees from the rock\'s velocity vector to have the
largest perpendicular component.

Has anyone bothered to calculate how much energy is needed to change a
rock\'s direction?  Find the angle you need to displace the velocity for a
miss, find how much energy you need to cause that change.  In fact...

My back of the envelope calculation says the energy E you\'ll need to divert
by angle theta a mass M moving at you at velocity V is:

  E = 1/2 * M * ( V * tan(theta) )^2

This ignores the gravity of your planet, but should be good enough for an
order of magnitude calculation.  I didn\'t save any of the previous messages
on this topic.  What were some of the masses and velocities being *ahem*
thrown around? :-)  And while we\'re at it, what was the conversion between
Joules and Megatons of TNT?

I think it was Minerva around Saturn.  It\'s got a huge impact crater that
makes it look like a large round spaceship.

\'...this sort of planetary (velocity/location) data is available in

well Im just remembering the quote from CT and I think MT that reads 
loosly \'...ships usually jump at low relative velocities...as when they 
exit from jump they cannot determine what their _vector_ will be with 
respect to the target planet...\'

however if you want to get too picky just realise that every star system 
is moving relative to every other and you find that exiting from jump 
into a (for example) transient system (one moving through the galaxy at 
high speed) would result in a high velocity with respect to the target 
system.  So...may solve problem of rock velocity!!

Also - using mid flight guidance of the rock is dubious if going at 
\'high\' velocities...somthing to do with E(k)=1/2*m*v^2.  I know nukes 
have a high energy output, but v^2 is a large number when talking in 
km/sec.  Tak the quoted (elsewhere) number of 1500km/sec...1500,000^2 is 
2.25 * 10^6, multiplied by the mass in kilos.  If your rock is going in the 
wrong direction then you need quite a few megatons worth of \'thrust\', 
most of which are wasted blowing large holes in the rock.  Another 
drawback...if you need multiple corrections, then you may destroy your 
second or further charges with the first if it is in the order of 5 
megatons, and if you need a hybrid direction change that requires 
charges to go off in different locations then unless your rock has been 
prestressed; the collection of charges will shatter it.

Also....if you are sending it through jump, remember the fuel 
requirement!!  You may not find a suitably sized rock that can withstand 
multiple 10-megaton charges going off on it within 1 jump of the 
target...

Several jumps later, fuel shuttles to ferry fuel to either the 
rock or it\'s tug, the time involved for the operation, and the 
magnitude of the operation.  All the enemy needs is a few stealth ships with 
gravity/densitometer sensors patrolling all nearby systems for enemy 
activity.  They can\'t help but notice the one LARGE, previously uncharted, 
\'high\' gravity object moving around a gas giant or in system.  

Hey presto a single (very) large object..no sizeable escorts..enemy sends in 
strike force (albeit suicide or so they think - a \'ship\' of that size 
must be well armed...).  When they find an unarmed rock with a tug 
dedicated to jump, powerplant and manoevre engines they proceed to 
destroy all sensors and signs of electronics on rock and tug.  (Also no 
shipyard activity to represent a ship of that magnitude being built by 
enemy...)

If you put a battle escort with it then you might as well write \'HERE WE 
ARE\' all over your naval communiques...because the first thing I would do 
is riddle my (potentially) hostile neighbours spy service and navy with 
agents - read what The Marches did to \'the enemy\' in the closing stages

Normal astrogation also gives you a sizable variation in the time it takes

Those few days make a lot of difference to Steve\'s 8-9 seconds to acquire

The nukes weren\'t supposed to break up the asteroid. It was a long way off
and the nukes were supposed to impart a new vector to it in time to make
it miss the planet.

So why not impose a limit to how fast things can move in jump space? It\'s
simple, dosen\'t change anything for the average PC (few merchants wants
to go ballistic anyway), and dosen\'t mess up any previous Imperial
history. That will solve that little problem, anyway. I admit that it
dosen\'t do a thing against the big manned fleet that jumps in at 100
diameters and paste you with missiles. For that you\'ll need something
else like planetary force screens (with a lower limit to size that won\'t
let you shield your ships). Or... (I just had this idea. Haven\'t had time
to ponder the full implications)  what about a weapon (gravitonic thruster
guns, fx ;-) that have twice the range of a meson gun, but only works
properly in a sizable gravitic field.

Hans correctly points out that there\'s a (up to days) variance in arrival
time with a Jump.  This is true, but it\'s also an inconsistency in the
game rules.  Space combat operations are described as having simultaneous
arrival of attacking forces.  The planets movements over several days will
change time of travel to surface when arriving by a whole lot... like
days, also.

I always GMed with shorter variance in the jump time.  Your mileage may
vary.  8-)

Surely this whole problem boils down to the fact that the DM should employ
his/her powers to ensure that the universe remains consistent. S/he should
come
up with a reason why everyone doesn\'t do this all the time.

This is a similar problem to one from my early days of DM-ing traveller. The
players devised a tactic to jump into a system to a known point at exactly
the
right velocity that they would slow down just in time for planetfall. This
was
to save in travel time to planet from jump point. Also useful for the fastest
speed strike attacks. Soooo.....

In with two solutions:

1) The \'Elite\' solution. Each jump will not put you in the same place. It is
impossible to place yourself in a specific position in space at the
destination. I decided that a good explanation of this would be that jump
space
is a link between points of equal gravitational potential. Thus, if a ship
jumps at the normal 100 diameters out from the planet, it will arrive 100
diameters out from the destination BUT not at a specific point on the sphere
that that point would describe. This then makes jumping dangerous at very
high
speeds because you may end up heading towards the planet unable to stop. I
would allow players to roll to get roughly the right orientation to the
planet
on arrival, given that the jump route is likely to be a straight line in
normal
space, and the ship will fall out of jump space at the first intersection
with
the 100 diameter sphere it is aiming for. Just disallow the accuracy needed
to
drop high speed rocks on a collision course.

This also has the interesting side effect that jumps cannot be made into
empty
sectors with no gravitational potential (thus explaining why there are no
artificial refuelling points in place across the rift).

2) The uncertainty principle error. Simply rule that the faster a ship is
travelling as it enters warp, the more inaccurate will be its exit at the
other
end. (perhaps an extension of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle - it is
impossible to define both velocity and position accurately at the same time).
Thus, if a ship enters jump at 0 velocity relative to the gravitational
source,
it can accurately place itself where it likes at the destination at 0
relative
velicity. However a fast moving ship has a large positional error. Given that
entering warp takes some time (I tend to use about one minute), a good rule
of
thumb would be the positional error could be the amount of distance it could
move in that time. e.g. a ship at 1/10th speed of light (3000 km s-1) could
be
out by 60*3000= 180,000 km. Easily enough to miss a planet....

Adjust this formula to enable your planet to have a chance. I would rule that
it would be impossible to use a planetoid as a weapon without at least a
couple
of hours sensor warning.

An Amber Zone I remember well was _A Dagger at Efate_.  Somebody
(ok, probably the Zhodani) sends an empty Broadsword merc cruiser
on a collision course with Efate, and the primary Imperial troop
concentration there, during the Siege of Efate in the 5FW.  The
players have to stop the Imperial Vice-Marshal\'s troops from 
getting their supply depot smushed by a multi-megaton impact.

(Blowing it out of the sky wasn\'t an early option for the space
defenses; they were a bit tied up, and it wasn\'t clear that the
ship wasn\'t still an Imperial paramilitary vessel coming in on
a normal approach with its\' com system fried.)

The players got eight hours to stop it, which for Efate\'s 3.2
light-second 100 diameter limit meant the _Dagger_ had a vector
of 2; that\'s 120,000 km/h!

One problem with the high-speed rock idea depends on how accurate
in time jump exit is.  The less accuracy you have, the harder it
is to hit a target directly.  Something moving slower can home in
on the target and jink around while using less fuel.

  DGP explained away this by positing that if all ships jump on command
using the same jumpspace solution transmitted over commo of some sort they
will appear in roughly the same spot and time.

  That would also mean btw that that funny hit&run PAW cruiser would be
impossible...

In MT Starship Operator\'s manual, I believe it say that fleet\'s use 
\'co-ordinated\' jumps [all linked to the same jump computer?], which is 
how a naval fleet comes out at the same time.

And thank you Ralph Ferneyhough, on reasons why asteroid jumps arn\'t

I know I\'m asking the wrong list, but can someone here kindly design

Actually, that\'s on the order of Earth\'s orbital velocity around the sun.
All velocities in space tend to be rather large, which isn\'t a problem
until you run into something moving in a different direction.  The space
shuttle had a minor collision with what NASA thinks was a speck of paint
from a prior mission.  It was also traveling at orbital velocity, but with
a different vector.  The energy in the velocity differential was enough to
make a quarter inch deep crater in one of the windows.

DGP had this inconsistency pointed out to them.  If I remember 
correctly they consulted with Marc Miller and came up with
the idea that by taking more time with calculations before
jump, a group of ships (convoy, battle fleet) could reduce
their relative spread to about plus or minus a half hour,
rather than a day.
  Calculation time was doubled or trebled, but was a minimal
inconvenience unless they were really pressed for time (like
under attack).

I\'ve never found that "simply forbidding" works very well.

Anyway, what do you consider a really dense object.

How about an armor factor 15 buffered planetoid starship?

I think you\'d eliminate star travel altogether if you enacted this.

>Another consideration is the relativistic mass of the object, it

It doesn\'t work that way.  The object\'s mass, *relative to the jump
drive* hasn\'t increased at all due to the object\'s speed.  The speed
of the object is only relativistic RELATIVE to the planet it\'s
aimed at.  Yes, I know I just ended two sentences prepositions with.
The point is the mass of the object remains constant regardless of
velocity as far as the jump drive itself is concerned.

This was noticed in MT.  DGP claimed that ships could spend longer 
periods of time prior to jump computing their jump co-ordinates, and
synchronize their data in order to make a more accurate jump.  
So then fleets would spend a fair amount of time right before jump
synchronizing their jump exit co-ordinates, but single ships jumping
with less accuracy could jump faster.

This would be a great place for some use of Navigation skill.  A
good navigator might be able to get you a better solution faster,
say with a vector pointed at the world or a shorter period of
time in jumpspace.  Great for drama, too: the crack navigators
of the Imperial fleet compute a near-perfect jump exit; tens of
ships step out of jump over a period of fifteen minutes, catching
the beseiging Zhodani fleet off their guard.  :)

Not true in MT also, I believe.  However, it took a good navigator to
properly compute a jump breakout that would have the vector pointing
in a useful direction.  I suppose the Ref\'s supplement (with all
the TL charts) would be the place to look for those rules.

I don\'t know where or if it explicitly says this in the rules, but
I think Marc Miller said in his jumpspace JTAS article that ships
are automatically forced out of jumpspace at the 100 diameter limit
if they attempt to jump into a gravity well.  (Jump exit might be a
bit rough, however, so you still might want a safety factor.)

In fact, now that I think about it, I vaguely recall something about
a 30000 km positional uncertainty in jump exit from Marc Miller\'s
article.  That may be enough to discourage the fast-big-rock type
of attack but not the slow-maneuverable-rock-or-ship attack, and
wouldn\'t affect space combat much, at least for MegaTraveller and
Battle Rider (which is a good fleet combat system, and might even
be useable with High Guard ships with some slight modifications.)

recall
the original scenario talked about was to be CT with the TNE system, at least
small, jump capable rocks won\'t be able to get to relativistic velocities
(but
in CT, the common scout ship could be a planet killer (I\'ll have to do the
math
one of these nights).

As an aside, someone talked about meson sites attacking the rocks tossed at them
It is interesting to note that you could attack a planetary deep meson site by
having the attaking ships close on the planet on a collision course. Shooting
them with the meson gun would be worse for the planet\'s population than letting
them attack (any crippled ship would be *nasty* dead-fall bombardment at 100+
km/sec)

	battleship is unlikely as intelligent races are assumed to want to

       	a planet is likely to have massive interceptors available to absorb 
        deadfalls that start way out, or sufficiet explosives to deflect them.

If you have a war with such hatred that people are willing to kill off whole
planets you will have at least some willing to die doing so.  Put some
defenses on the rock (including some nice ECM, decoy drones, etc.) and dive
down the infidels\' throats.

As to how fast, pick a number you like.  I\'m fond of 1500Km/s
myself.  Typical time to impact is nine minutes from time of
appearance that way.  Impact energy of on the order of 100
gigatons of TNT for a 10,000 displacement ton rock...

And, of course, if we use CT/MT, then a velocity/impact
energy of 25,000Km/s / 1 Teraton is not too unreasonable...

    I see your deep meson sites are kept on Red Alert at all 
times.  Otherwise, the two second time is not too practical.

>>>>>	It would be just like UASF missile silo crews, only better.

    Note that four months can get you  a rock moving at 1/3c.
That give you 8 or 9 seconds to react, including 2 to 3 seconds 
for the detector net to even DETECT the rock.  Six seconds to
go to Red Alert and get a fire-control solution.   Good luck.

    Given the 1500Km/s rock I mentioned in a previous missive,
you\'d need a meson gun that can output at something like
100,000 TERAWATTS to get a clean miss.  At LEAST!

I beg to differ - to HIT the target planet won\'t be that difficult. The 
information needed is available in any astrogation data program. The 
planets in the target system won\'t shift, so any reasonably accurate data 
set (like those that merchants use for general astrogation) will do just 
fine.

I think the assumption was that the rock jump with a relatively high
velocity.
In that case, changing its course after it arrives in the target system may
not be possible (assuming the idea is to have minimum coast to target to
avoid
deflection)

If the rock is "dumb" (or at least incapable of major velocity changes) then
it
*must* pop out of jumpspace with its velocity vector through the target if it
is
to hit.  But if it is carried by a starship, it would have no more problems
than
a ship would.

In TNE this wouldn\'t happen, they\'d never get a lock  :)

True enough if it is under control.  If we\'re talking CT, then what about
small
chunks of BSD (say a lifeboat :) at a decent fraction of c? (a couple of
months
at 6g from out in the oort cloud)  All you\'d need is a small military ship
with
2-3 month\'s stores in place of weapons/cargo... scary idea, though SDBs out
there would nail the ship if they saw it (too bad they\'d never get to the
oort
cloud in TNE *sigh*)

Basically, KE bombardment weapons range from useful little/slow ones, to
things
that make nukes look like toys----the latter would have the same problems of 
actually using them that nukes do now, so for the most part the won\'t matter.

What is the detection range of the sensor?  What if it is cooled to background
temp and/or somewhat stealthy?  It is basically a very low albedo rock (it could
be a stealth rock, as well).  Detecting it would be non-trivial at long range,
and impossible in the CT/TNE blend suggested.

True, but only once you have some idea that it\'s there.

Granted.  This would apply to natural dangers, as well, BTW.

Firing on it, even by a energy weapon would be at very short range, and I really
don\'t know what a Mgun would do to a rock...

As to conserving velocity, remember that every star is moving at a different
vector as it orbits the galactic core.  I can\'t recall exact speeds, but
remember from some quick research a few years ago that the different vectors
between systems was enough that ships would need a long time (and a lot of
fuel) to match vectors with each world.  Allowinf a Jump to change your
vector at least gets around this problem.  (In fact, it may have been the

Ah, but that is for ordinary ship travel. If you try to move too fast you
run into the Gaamagugii Barrier. Merchants don\'t like to spend more fuel

Velocity.

Reasonable explanation? What\'s the explanation for the lightspeed barrier?
That\'s just the way things work in jump space.

You know, I\'d much rather explain why that sort of attack dosen\'t work
(as the known history of Charted Space indicates is the case) by imposing 
some arbitrary limit to a natural law that dosen\'t exist anyway than to
say that "well, people just don\'t do that sort of thing" (Mind you, I\'ll
use that if I have to, I\'d just prefer something else).

1)  Yes they would.  This whole thread is based upon the interpretation
that aiming the things is possible.  One can interpret the jump and
navigation rules that way.  You choose not to.  That\'s your 
prerogative, but it invalidates NOT ONE WORD of what the rest of us
have been talking about.  Choosing the interpretation that you choose
simply makes it impossible and then there\'s no point in your joining
in this conversation.

2)  Read!  TL F+ can BUILD black globe generators.  They
are NOT irreplaceable artifacts.  Expensive?  Sure, but so
what.  Presumably the existence of the enemy on the target
planet is MORE EXPENSIVE or one wouldn\'t be bothering.

3)  Knocking out the Sensors etc. on a relativistic object?

We don\'t think so.  You\'d be lucky if your shots got within
100 asteroid diameters of the thing.  Relativistic speeds FUCK
fire control solutions.  Besides, by the time you got to that
point, it probably wouldn\'t need those sensors anymore anyway.

4)  Making course corrections?

We don\'t think so.  You do it once.  And only once.  You already
know not only exactly where the planet is, but EXACTLY where it\'s
going to be when you get there.  All that is PUBLIC INFORMATION.
Orbital data DOES get recorded, you know.  By the time they see
it coming, and get into firing range, it needs no course corrections.
Unless the defenders get *lucky*, or have their whole fleet protecting
one planet.

So, you have to physically deflect or destroy it.  What would you
do that with?

Big Meson Guns?  Steve is right.  Given a decent sized asteroid, it
simply CANNOT be done with spinal mounts.  When you start talking about
TERAWATTS of discharge energy for a spinal mount you\'re talking about:
 1) something nobody can afford to build and POWER.
 2) something nobody can afford to build a ship around.
 3) something so big that as a deep site, aiming it would be a
 major project.  Torque and flexure, you know...

So what else could you use?

Throw your SDBs at it if you want to.  Scoff, scoff...  I have yet
to see a flea deflect an elephant.  Even an armed flea.

Nukes?  Well, if you think you can hit a moving target travelling 
at relativistic speeds, which target happens to be *invisible*,
you can feel free to try.  But even if the thing doesn\'t have
a black globe, if you can hit it with nukes, then the automated
anti missile defenses on the incoming asteroid can shoot down your
nukes.  This isn\'t Mickey Mouse.  The attacker has made a huge
investment in this attack, for a reason that seems uniquely important
to it.  This thing is going to have defenses of it\'s own.

Now, let\'s say you do deflect it.  What have you done?  Saved the
population physically, but not emotionally.  They have just had the
living s**t scared out of them.  Some portion will be galvanized,
the rest will get scared and depressed.

Then another asteroid emerges the following week.

If I play this right, I could eliminate your government\'s stomach for
war by cleverly allowing you to deflect my asteroids...

Off the top of my head, the peculiar motion of the sun is something like 16.5
km/s relative to the local standard of rest.  This value would obviously change
from star to star, but is somewhat typical.  It is also only about 1 BL hex per
turn.

If you wanted to add relative motion (just for kicks) in a simple way, just
make one up, or roll 1d6 for direction of motion (fixed to some imperial
standard) on the subsector map, then 1d6-2 for its magnitude in BL hexes/turn.
Write the value in the hex on the subsector map (ie: V32  would be direction 3
mag. 2, then add them together for a given jump (it\'ll at least tell you how
much delta v you need to zero your relative velocity (we\'ll disregard the
motion of nearby (jump range) stars around the galactic center since this value
would be similar for any near stars (around 250km/s if I remember right).

BTW, a rogue star that is moving at right angles to the plane, or is
travelling through the galaxy faster than its neighbors might explain otherwise interesting
systems that don\'t have xboat routes, or whatever (velocity matching the poopoo

    'body' => 'Even more on stopping falling rocks:

I looked at the old JTAS #24 "Jumpspace" article by Marc Miller 
last night, and this is what I got out of it:

 * Spatial jump exit is accurate to about one in ten billion; 
   but the accuracy can fall by a factor of ten if the drive is
   badly tuned or the computer solution is inaccurate.  (Don\'t
   use a parallelized Pentium Model/1 bis!)  This means that for 
   a one parsec  jump, the jump exit should occur within a 
   sphere with a 3000 km radius,  30000 km if the drive\'s a bit
   off.  Longer jumps have less accurate exits.

 * Ships retain the relative vector they possessed before jump.
   Commercial ships usually jump at zero vector to try to reduce
   to risk of high speed collision with something on jump exit.
   Military ships and couriers tend to jump at high vector, and
   decelerate all the way to the destination planet.

 * If a ship attempts to jump into a gravity field, it will fall
   out of jump at the "edge of the gravity field"; he probably
   means the point at which the field starts to seriously cause
   problems with the jump solution, since there isn\'t an "edge"
   to the gravity field.

 * Ships take 168 +/- 16.8 hours to complete a jump.  (This, we
   knew.)  The time is not readily controllable by the navigator.
   Exit time is usually predictable by the computer.  (This is
   modified/clarified slightly by the later decision that the 
   jump exit can be synchronized to make fleet movement 
   possible.) 
   
 * The 100 diameter limit is a rule of thumb; it includes a
   safety limit; the real safe jump point is based on the grav
   field of nearby objects. 

We also know that co-ordinates can be pre-recorded, based on some
comments in CT and the K\'kree module about self-erasing one use
jump navigation tapes for lunatic, cheap ships with no navigator.
Would you trust one? 

The 100 diameter line for a size one world is just over half a
light-second; for a size ten world it is almost five and a half
light-seconds.

Now, about stopping a rock.  Are you using CT or MT rules?  CT
combat ranges tend to be shorter than MT (or TNE).  CT merchants
can detect only to half a light-second, and CT warships can
detect to about two light-seconds.  In the CT Amber Zone 
_A Dagger at Efate_, the ground station somehow can see to the
3.2 light-second jump exit point, but this could have been made
possible by a "constellation" of detector satellites orbiting
Efate, or good ground-based detectors.

If you\'re using MT combat rules, you can probably see the ship
or rock coming, but if it\'s at nine-tenths of a light-second or
further out from you, it\'s at Extreme range for defensive fire.

Actually, you could do something with this.  Not, of course, as absolute
velocities, but perhaps as some sort of absolute potential energy difference
in comparison to the amount of potential energy the object has in comparison
to whatever is generating the "100-diameter limit" gravitational field....

What is the detection range of the sensor?  What if it is cooled to
background
temp and/or somewhat stealthy?  It is basically a very low albedo rock (it
could
be a stealth rock, as well).  Detecting it would be non-trivial at long

Actually, he can\'t get too upset with out toppling the discworld
off his back (apocalypse), or causing one of the elephants to stumble
(major earthquakes, tidal waves, etc.).

He does indeed get quite pissed off but must show extraordinary

Sure, if it was *suitably* advanced.  8^)  They would also have to
be *suitably* insane.  \'Course, no one has figured out WHY Great
A\'Tuin mucks about the galaxy with four huge elephants and a flat
planet on his back.  Perhaps he is a hamburger short of a happy meal
himself.  8^)

Also note that the *suitably* wacko, uh, I mean advanced, society
would have to be able to genetically engineer giant space turtles
and giant shell-riding space elephants that don\'t need to breathe
or eat, for thousands of years, and which don\'t bore easily.

"There was no doubt that there was something magical in the soil
of that hilly, broken area which - because of the strange tint 
that it gave to the local flora - was known as that octarine 
grass country.  For example, it was one of the few places on the
Disc where plants produced reannual varieties.

Reannuals are plants that grow backwards in time.  You sow the 
seed this year and they grow last year.

Mort\'s family specialised in distilling the wine from reannual 
grapes.  These were very powerful and much sought after by
fortune-tellers, since of course they enabled them to see the 
future.  

The only snag was that you got the hangover the morning _before_,
and had to drink a lot to get over it.

Sorry to disturb your good night\'s rest Alvin, but those miners are probably
"throwing" their cargoes into Earth orbit via some kind of catapult (buried
in Ceres?) or perhaps from our own moon (ala Heinlein\'s "Moon is a Harsh
Mistress" which several of this thread have probably read).

It makes sense, why use an expensive ship and crew to go all the way to, say,
Titan Base for the weekly Methane shipment when it can be encapsulated and
catapulted on a long trajectory carefully designed to be caught in earth
orbit 18-24 months later.  The Methane would probably even remain in solid
state for he trip (assuming you can shield it properly from sunlight).  An
Earth-orbit shuttle would then "catch" the capsule and haul it down.  Or
perhaps, per Heinlein again, the capsule is sent right into the atmosphere
to splash, after reentry, into the Indian Ocean.

So much for Tokyo!  All it takes is for the AI managing the catapult to go
rebel and the home of Godzilla is smeared.

On The Other Hand (tm) The capsules would tend to be less massive than the
"rocks" being discussed (perhaps 1000 tons or so) and could be more easily 
intercepted since they\'re not under constant acceleration, and since
diverting
or destroying a less massive object is easier.  The miners on the Moon might
be ruling the earth though!

Hmmm.  Tricky.  Probably by putting active sensors on it, for it\'s
own defensive systems, and using them.  That\'s reasonable enough.
Sure, the ROCK is big enough to hit easily, but a 1m^2 AEMS sensor
antenna is NOT.  So this rock has several of them, to direct it\'s
antimissile defenses (lasers and nuclear dampers).

Once this are lit, the ROCK is obvious.

Then I make sure that something just happens to get through.  Since
this is a reasonably BIG ROCK, the target world is probably using
BFN\'s (Big Fucking Nukes), like 500 Megatons, say, concealed in clouds
of detonation laser missiles (hoping to take out the AEMS sensors,
but mostly to act as decoys so the big mothers can score direct hits.)
Maybe, with the LAST ROCK, I have to let couple 500 MT nukes get 
through just a little too late.  You know, so some big chunks actually
fall on the planet.  Not enough to trash the world, but maybe a city 
or two.  Then morale is shot, but the BULK of everything valuable on
the world is relatively intact.

Now, I believe that you can put up an adequate defense against these
things - in some places.  But I can bring my rocks to some other
place.  It\'s like a shell game.  I try to find the places where the
defenses are [barely] inadequate, you try to find the places where
I\'m building my planetbusters, while attempting to defeat my fleets
at the same time.  At the places where the defences are more than
adequate, I throw rocks two (or more) at a time, from different
directions.  Your public recalls your fleet.  ("Get back here and
protect the civilians!").  Etc, etc.

BTW, this is also a decent way to deal with pesky SDB\'s hiding in
the atmosphere of a Gas Giant.  

Just drop some big rocks into it, fast.  The resulting storms ought
to do the trick.  Of course, with THOSE rocks, I don\'t light up the
active sensors.  I WANT these things to come raining down 
unannounced.  Of course, *I* won\'t be able to refuel my own ships
there for awhile, but hey, you can\'t have everything.

Good question.  Probably because they *want* what\'s on the world
reasonably intact.  It generally doesn\'t work to destroy what you\'re
looking to capture.  Look at Gorozny.  When/If the Russians finally
capture it, what good will it be to them?  It won\'t even provide
shelter for their own troops against the Winter weather.

Actually trashing an entire world with thrown rocks would probably
be limited to cases of necessity, genocidal hatred, desperation,
or my plan of letting the enemy seem to be just lucky enough
(this time) to avert disaster (but who knows about next time).

1)  There\'s no value to that world.  Nobody lives there, it has
S**t for soil and Piss for oceans, you can\'t breathe the air.  But
there\'s a BFMB (Big F**king Military Base (tm)) there, for whatever
reason.  <Necessity>

Drop a rock on it.

2)  You are good.  They are evil.  They mean to destroy you utterly,
you must do it to them first.  <Genocidal Hatred>

Drop rocks on them.

3)  They are winning.  They have captured some of our most important
(most resource rich, high pop, high tech) worlds.  We\'ve got to
bring this war to an immediate halt *and* get our worlds given back
to us.  <Desperation>

Drop rocks on them.

4)  My own case, as described above.  I won\'t retype it here.

Drop rocks ALMOST on them.

Now, why isn\'t case 4 being done all the time.  Well, it may actually
be too difficult or too expensive.  Building BIG throwaway jump, and
thrust engines, not to mention powerplants and disposable defensive
systems...  Big Buckaroos.  And it would take *TIME*.  Maybe too much
time.  So, maybe it would be something, as Alvin suggests, that 
really is *Alien*.  I dunno.


Enough for now, my claws are tired.

Howdy,
	I just dusted off my old FFW and we decided we\'d start a game up to
be played over the next few weeks.  I was reading the rules again, when I
remembered that all the BatRons for the Imperium (Zhos, too) were unstream-
lined.  But the old CT fighting ships shows all the BBs as having fuel
scoops,
so what\'s the deal?

Has there ever been a net.fix of FFW to make it consistant with the rest of

Maybe it is. I studied physics at high school level 20 years ago and have
forgotten most of it.. I don\'t really care if it\'s silly. I just didn\'t 
want to get into the question of mass and energy, not wanting to limit the 
size of ships. Relative to whatever reference frame GDW uses when they
say that a ship usually jumps with a zero vector. That\'s equally silly,
isn\'t it? No, wait. How\'s this. I wanted to make it impossible to come
out of jump space with a high velocity directly towards a planet. OK.
So that 100 diameter limit is just a rule of thumb. I mean, there\'s no
sharp break in the planet\'s gravity field at 100 diameters, is there? So 
say that the larger your velocity is relative to any gravity source you\'re 
pointing at, the farther out you get dumped into realspace. If your vector 
is zero you can get in around 100 diameters. If it\'s x% of the speed of 
light (whatever fits) you get dumped at 200 or 300 or 1000 diameters 
from the gravity source. 

Works for me.

My own quick thoughts:
BIG ROCKS
One-off splat-them philosophy is required here with, as Derek says, no
desire to have anything worthwhile left on the world afterward. Such rocks
are hugley expensive and take a long time to \'construct\' and can only be
used for their one purpose, i.e. planet destruction.
SMALL ROCKS
Unless you\'re talking about a few tons in mass drivers, small rocks (with
drives, defences, scanners and/or black globes) just don\'t make sense
because they\'re using up huge amounts of budget for a \'wipe em out\'
philosophy which few planets have. It is far more useful to use the money on
a standard space navy which gives you the ability to handle any space
incident anywhere (anti-piracy, siege, counter-insurgency, covert
operations, starship battles, etc.) while providing lots of shiny ships for
fly-bys, etc. and for IMPRESSING the enemy. This last point is very
important - if the opponent sees you have a big shiny navy, he\'ll be less
likely to hassle you (i.e gunboat diplomacy). If you\'ve got a small navy but
you\'re working on a top secret huge rock somewhere, the enemy will probably
think you\'re weak and attack you before you launch the rock anyway. Rocks of
ANY size just can\'t do what a Navy does, so they will only be used in
one-off ventures between planets that really really REALLY hate each other\'s
guts AND that have a mad government (it doesn\'t matter how much the populace
hate each other due to real events or govt. propaganda, it\'s the govts. in
the end which have to decide they\'re going to obliterate the enemy\'s planet,
while being aware that the enemy might have a similar rock just waiting to
be auto-launched if their planet is attacked... back to Mutually Assured
Destruction again...).

Later, Derek asks:
Hostes alienigeni me abduxerunt.  Qui annus est?

To which I reply:
Don\'t worry, you have merely experienced a mild dream trauma causing
paranoia and the sensation of being abducted by strange creatures. In a few
minutes your brain will reboot and come back on line (after memory parity
check) and you will realise that you are in the year 5538AD. Some of your
peripherals may need resetting.

(2)
Just to repeat things I\'ve said before, I allow players in my game to jump
anywhere they like. Jumping in to within 100 diameters (of any high gravity
body - sun, gas giant or planet) in my game is likely to PREVENT exit from
jump - the ship effectively get\'s bounced because it can\'t form a full jump
field to break through into normal space. This is what causes misjumps - the
ship \'bounces\' off on a random vector for a random time. Now that\'s far more
scary than knowing that if you jump too close to the gravity well you\'ll
always appear at 100 diameters! When jumping out, again the players can
activate the jump drive on the planet surface if they so wish. However, the
jump field will be so distorted that it may take bits of planet with it (and
leave bits of ship behind), and the launch into jump space will be so
violent that the ship is very unlikely to assume the desired vector but more
likely to head off in a random direction.
Using this system, players can always resort to desperate measures, but
knowing that there\'s a REAL risk!

Now, now children, play nicely :-)
Seriously though, can we not get into rules interpretation/lawering.
I only have CT rules, all these references to MT and TNE, are (to me 
anyway) completely irrelavent.

Use the High Guard idea of Partial streamlining.  Enougth streamlining to 
be able to use fuel scoops in Gas Giants, but not enougth for 
atmosphereic work proper.

Jumping, Vectors, and Mass limits.
The way I work things, is that your KE vector is preserved through jumps, 
(relative to whatever referance frame you like).  To obtain a useful 
vector at your destination, manoeuvre in the starting system so that 
your vector relative to your jump exit point is correct, then jump.  If 
all goes well you arrive rougthly where you want to be, when you want to 
be, with the in-system vector you want.
(see the JoTAS #24 notes on jump errors).

As for 
>>>Unless you want to create a set of rules varying the 
>>>ability to get into jump space based on (what? size, weight? speed? 
total 
>>>energy?) 

Since My jumpdrives are rated for the _volume_ of material they project 
over the jump distance, theres no scope there.  (but as we probably all 
have a slightly different interpretation of how jump works).

But the 10-diameter/100-diameter limits, are levels of gravitational 
potential energy, or curvature of space time if you like.  Can you say 
that an object with a high kienetic energy similarly curves space time, 
(based on ideas of high-energy density producing curvature).

Mark Miller is the JoTAS article suggests that _Energy_ is the variable 
is making jumps (time is constant).  So energy density effects could be 
invoked.

But, this is _science_fiction_ after all.  Pick a behaviour, and as long 
as you are consistant, and not unbalencing the game to far, why worry too 
much about the details of the physics.  
After all, if I did know how jump space worked, I\'d be building the damm 
drives!!!
----

One Idea I\'m thinking of trying,
Mix methods of FTL travel in the Traveller universe.  Is jump the only 
way to go from star-to-star.
How about Warp drive.  Wormholes etc...

Would different activities find different drives more advantagous?

Would Scouts use Warp, because you can still see the real-space,
	spoting any interesting uncharted phenomina.

Navy use jump, you can\'t track a starship through jump.

etc...

Play balance.

Specifically, if either side were allowed large numbers of partially

The quarantine was for the safety of the astronauts, not those of us stuck on

the ground.  The lunar dust contained an element feared to weaken the human 
immune system, and the astronauts had just spent three days breathing the
dust 
(which they brought on board on their suits).  Later Apollo crews spent much 
less time in quarantine.

Then the game wasn\'t designed right, or the Zhos win.  All the big High Guard
ships could refuel, and they knew this when they wrote FFW.  Just once I\'d
like
to see something that really scales up properly, from player charactors to
stategic level stuff  *sigh*

Maybe the Zho ships aren\'t streamlined since we only know for sure that the
Impyones are...

    Well, no.  The target planet MAY be within 100 diameters of the sun.
Not terribly likely if the planet is habitable, but possible.  Note that
our sun\'s 100 diameter limit is only 139,200,000 Km from the center of
the system - which places us about 10,000,000 Km outside the limit.
    As to gas giants - if the gas giant is REALLY huge (twice Jupiter\'s
diameter), and is in orbit 0 or 1, then a planet in orbit 1 or 0 MIGHT
be within the 100 diamter limit of the GG.  Or the planet could orbit
a gas giant (as Amondiage did in my last TCS game), which would protect
the planet somewhat.  At least, it would stretch transit time from the
100 diameter limit by a factor of ten or thereabouts...

    As to the sensibility of emerging at low velocity:

    Well, no.  If you can\'t calculate well enough to make sure you are
pointing at the target (unlikely IMHO, but you can interpret the rules
that way if you like), then send more than one rock...;-)

    But, the real reason I dropped back into this discussion was your next
comment:

>	Any system defence is going to be in depth, so detection and 
>	classification with immediate action won\'t be a problem.  If 
>	neighboring hostiles are fielding KE weapons, then immediate action
>	plans can be assumed.

    Well, no.  This is an idiotic idea given Trav technology.  In FF&S
you can get sensors that can detect things at 8 light seconds.  In the
earlier forms of the game, you will be lucky to detect things at 2
light seconds.  Note that 100 diameters from Terra is about 4 light
seconds.
    This limit in detection capability is crucial to the nature of
"system defenses".  That is, a ship in orbit around Jupiter would not
be capable of detecting the emergence of a ship near Mars.  It wouldn\'t
even be able to detect the emergence of a ship at Jupiter\'s 100 diameter
limit, frankly.
    A ship in orbit around Jupiter would take about 60 hours to reach
Terra at 6-Gs.
    These, coupled with the ability of a ship to jump in at the 100
diameter limit of any body in the system (plus or minus a few thousand 
(NOT million) Km) that is not itself within the 100 diameter limit of
another body, imply strongly that "defense in depth" is a ludicrous
concept in Trav.
    Any ship stationed at a gas giant is going to be irrelevant to a 
battle occurring at or near the main world for several days.  Ditto any
ship stationed at a rock that might be used as a weapon.  Gas giant
refueling is a stupid idea fostered by GDW many years ago - it made
little sense then, less now.  A Fleet intent on attacking your main
world will appear, not at a gas giant, but at the 100 diameter limit
of the main world.  And all the GG squadrons you have scattered around
the system will have front row seats to watch your main world be
smashed (if that is the attacker\'s intent), since they certainly won\'t
be in position to interfere.
    As to "immediate action" against KE weapons:
    What might those be?  If the rock is heading straight toward your
planet, it\'ll be in range of planetary defenses only the last 300,000
Km (for older versions of Trav, about 2,400,000 Km for TNE).  If the 
rock is moving in at 1500 Km/s (slow for older versions, fast for TNE),
then you only get three minutes to respond.  Since it is heading for
your planet, nothing less than destruction or redirection will 
suffice.
    And destruction is only going to be possible with LARGE nukes.
REALLY LARGE NUKES.  Which you may well have.  But you won\'t be
launching them till you detect the target, which won\'t be till about
five minutes before impact.  At 12G\'s, assuming ZERO reaction time
for local defense forces (not too likely), you get your first chance
to hit the rock at about 5000Km above atmosphere.  If the first misses,
you have no second shot.  If it hits, then, in addition to any pieces
of the rock still coming down, your entire civilization gets a lesson
in EMP generated by a large nuke popped off near the planet.

    And, of course, all my comments only apply to slow moving rocks.
Push the rock to 0.9c (any good battleship can do it in older versions
of Trav), and all bets are off.  You get first detection 0.2 seconds
before impact.  Which was about the amount of time required for you
to read the phrase "before impact" back there.  Bye, bye...

    WHy would they be there?  *I* certainly won\'t be there attacking 
them.  I\'ll attack your main world where they are helpless to 
intervene (being days away at max accel).  And your spinal mounts
on major worlds are NOT mutually supporting, and CANNOT be brought
to bear (not "bare") immediately.  Consider the speed of traverse
of the main turrets of the New Jersey if you doubt me.  Sure, we\'ll
be able to do better in the future.  But guns big enough to matter
will be vastly larger than the New Jersey\'s piddly little guns...

    I could only pray that my opponents be that stupid...
    If you scatter your fleet all over your system, then several
things occur:

        1)  your fleets can be defeated in detail by a small part of
MY fleet.
        2)  your fleets will prove no threat at all to my worlds, 
thus freeing up more of my fleet to beat on YOUR worlds.
        3)  And your fleets will not actually help defend your worlds
at all...

    Nonsense.  If it is aimed at your world, then damaging the
propulsion system GUARANTEES a hit.  Serendip Belt tried this against
Neubayern just before the end of the game - aim at their world, then
if they shoot you, you hit their world, doing far more damage than
would have been done if you allowed them to bombard your world...
    This only works if you detect the rock BEFORE it is aimed at you.
And you won\'t, since Trav sensors aren\'t good enough for that...

    Do you have any idea how big the Oort cloud is?  Trust me, it\'s big
enough that you would need BILLIONS of SDBs out there to have solid
enough coverage to catch everything incoming from out there in the 
Deep Darks...

    How do you figure that?  The outer planets are billions of Km from the
main world, and the sensors only detect out to a few million Km last
time I checked.  Or are you posting sentry ships out around Pluto\'s 
orbit?  That means you should be able to get by with around 10,000,000
sentry ships.  And one of them will be in weapons\' range of the
relativistic target for about 1 second after detection...good luck on 
getting a hit.  Especially since your missiles will NEVER catch the
target - you\'ll have to vaporize the target with your lasers/PAs/meson
guns.  One shot each...;-)
    Or, to put it another way, by the time you read this sentence, the
target is out of range...

    I agree that ships will probably be required to avoid vectors
straight at a planet most of the time.  But if you want to hit the planet,
then you will.
    As to "massive interceptors", show me how.  Design a ship that
can stop a deadfall that is fighting back.  Use BR to test it out.  Or
High Guard, or MT.  Your choice.  Then assume a suicidal Tigress.  See
how well your interceptor works.  Then repeat until you get one that
will work nine times out of ten.  Note that in all three systems you
get basically one turn of firing before the impact occurs.  Good luck...
you\'ll need it.

    I must have missed that part of the rules.  Can you tell me which 
page they are on?
    Not that it matters much, since your sensors aren\'t good enough to
detect me more than 50 diameters out or so...

    So try it.  Design the defenses.  Try them out.  See what REALLY

Too long...  
    Here\'s an experiment for you.  Sit down near your stereo.  Every time
you hear a car\'s horn go off, hit the \'play" button.  See if you can
do this within two seconds EVERY time it happens during the next six

you can aim your meson gun that fast.  I\'m not even willing to bet that
a meson gun can be powered up that fast.  Nor would I care to guess
whether a meson gun could stay powered up for six months at a time...

    The really lovely thing is that planets have predictable motions.
    And you will have the planet\'s relative motions down cold LOOOOONG 
before you plan this....or you won\'t plan it.

    Or maybe 600x10^6 meters away.  6 seconds to impact.
        Note that you lose several seconds due to lightspeed limits
here - the rock will only be 16 (or 4) seconds away when the light
from your sensors gets back to you to let you know its coming...

    Why do that?  It won\'t help win the war, so it is pointless to 
protect one lousy carrier.  Besides, black globes are not artifacts
at TL15.  They can be built then...
        And, if it were an irreplacable artifact, and did miss, then 
go out and recover the artifact.  After all, YOU know where the rock
is/will be...

    Why not?  Let\'s assume that it takes 10 megabytes to store the
applicable info on any inhabited planet.  That\'s only 110 gigabytes
of data for the whole Imperium.  At our present rate of progress, 
you\'ll be able to put hard disks that size in your PC in less than 50
years.
    The point, however, was that the data was readily available, and could
EASILY be loaded into the weapon in question...

    Yes, they do.  Reaction time is around five minutes in a 
missile silo.  Absolute best case would still be a minute or two,
since the missile\'s gyros are not spun up till a launch order is
given...

    If you are a fast typist, then you took around five seconds to type

>>>>>>	On the way !!

    No.  You still have to AIM that monster meson gun.  Unless the 
enemy is unlucky enough to drop it insystem right in the line with
the "rest" position for the weapon...

        The really interesting thing here is that you disbelieve that
the rock can actually be accurate enough to hit the planet without 
terminal corrections, but you believe that your meson gun can hit a
target one one-millionth the size of a planet moving 10,000 times
faster than the planet with only five or six seconds of preparation.
        Bizarre!

This is completely incorrect.
The _only_ reason for quarantine was fear of contamination by
unfriendly extraterrestrial organisms.  There\'s nothing at all
hazardous in lunar soil.

Unless you\'re talking about a few tons in mass drivers, small rocks (with

a standard space navy which gives you the ability to handle any space

In a conversation several years ago with the official historian of the
Apollo research programs, it was pointed out to me that few scientists
took the possibility of contaminating organisms existing on the Moon
seriously.  After all, the Moon\'s surface is an environment similar to
what one would use if one wanted to kill microorganisms - alternating 
cycles of extreme heat and cold, intense hard radiation (from the Sun),

In fact, for my Ultimate Campaign (primordial time to far-flung future) I
was tweaking the stats of Warp, Jump, and Hyperspace drives in GURPS. I
added in converted Stutterwarp stats from FF&S. Haven\'t added in
Wormholes/gates yet, though.

You see, I think they\'re all related, and could be developed at different
times.
For instance, a civilization could develop Jump Drive. Refinements allow
for Stutterwarp (which is really just making lots of small jumps).
Hyperdrive, as I define it, is entering jumpspace and being able to stay
there (as oppsed to jumps, which just throw you). Anyway. . .

My biggest mental obstacle right now is Stutterwarp in combat. With
stutterwarp, you can have FTL gun battles. It\'s hard to imagine - you have
to predict where your target will be. . .say, this steps into quantum
physics. You don\'t care where he\'ll be, only where he will be. . .very Zen.

There were a few problems with the travel tables for those old
infinite delta-vee maneuver drives.  They forgot relativity.  For
example, the distance to the Oort Cloud was 50000 AU, which is the
same as 288.5 light-days.  However, according to the travel tables,
a 6G ship could get there in 258.8 days -- outpacing light itself.
Fast ships. :)  A MegaT SDB couldn\'t get there without jump shuttles
anyway, since I doubt they had more than a month or so of power.

To give folks a comparison between CT and TNE, in CT a 6G SDB could
cover the 900 million km from Earth to Saturn in 2.8 days.  A TNE
112 G-turn SDB, if it planned to stop at Saturn, could manage about
a quarter of that speed.  It would then need to refuel on arrival.
A ship micro-jumping from Earth to Saturn could beat the TNE SDB
there.

I think the CT ship hits a few percent of light-speed at the turnover
point.  So the CT quick-figure equations probably start to break down
due to relativistic effects beyond a billion kilometers of travel or
so.

 Over on the Cherryhlist we were discussing what sort of weapons her ships 
would use. They often cruise around the place at sort of relativistic 
velocities. Anyway an interesting thought that came up was along these
lines...
 The main advantage of something traveling at relativistic velocities is the 
relative speed with respect to its target. However this is also the biggest 
weakness. You just have to get something in the way. It needent be moving
very 
vast, the incoming bogey has enough speed.
 So, first you have your lag-time between when you detect the bogey and how 
much it has traveled since the wavefront you are receiving. This is extended
by 
the time to intercept of your munitions. The bogey\'s maneuverability
determines 
the maximum tangental change to its course it can make over that course of 
time. This produces a circle (or sphere if you assume it can 
accelerate/decelerate) of all the possible locations the bogey can be at time

of intercept.
 Given this information you direct your missile spread to evenly cover this 
area. (A shotgun sort of effect.) The amound of matter density you can put in

that area directly determines the amount of damage inflicted. It *must* go 
through that region. Human or tactical logic can narrow the constraints of 
maneuverability (e.g. an asteroid probably won\'t maneuver much and if a
planet 
is the likely target then that limits it further) and reduce the size of the 
sphere.
 Taking this to the logical extreme one person suggested that you could use 
*water* isntead of pellets. Thus achieving a perfectly even spread. It is
also 
more "merchant-friendly" as once past the designated target it becomes thin 
enough to be of no further damage.
 I must admit I never sat down and did the maths on this one. I don\'t know
what 
rate of fire you would have to achieve to get a meaningfull amount of mass
into 
the area. Perhaps you might think of doing it for this particular situation, 
i.e. knocking out the sensors on an inbound relativistic object.

Makes for an interesting idea for a new class of planetary bombardment
weapon.

If you come out of jump with a very high velocity relative to your
target world, and your ship is equipped with, say, a spinal or
parallel mounted MASS DRIVER, rapid-firing 1 to 10 tonne shells...

Maybe they\'re made of stealth material.  Hmmm...  At higher techs
you could keep the mass the same but make them smaller by using
better materials technology...  That might just hurt a whole lot.

And it would be a whole lot cheaper than moving asteroids around.

Well, since in CT/MT the BIG Meson guns are mounted SPINALLY on ships,
and you have to point your ship\'s spine as at the target, I\'d say
they are "tunnelly acceleratorish sorta thingies" in CT/MT.  In
fact, I think they were first described as "Meson *Accelerators*"
but I\'m not sure about that.  (That is, however, what they *DO*
to achieve their effect.)

In TNE, using the FF&S design sequence for Meson Guns (spinal, parallel
bay, or deep mounted), you actually design a Meson TUNNEL (the length
of which the meson stream must travel, and through which the mesons
are accelerated).

So in either system, you do have to rotate your MG to aim it, and
the bigger it is, the bigger a project that is.  Ask any astronomer
who\'s dealt with a _BIG_ _REFRACTING_ telescope about flexure and
you can see that you end up with BIG deep site meson guns taking quite
some time to aim if you don\'t want to tie them into pretzels.

Throwing asteroids at planets with civilian populations is almost
certainly a war crime.  The Imperium doesn\'t use chemical or biological
weapons, by Imperial edict as I recall.  It does stockpile them, I 
think originally because of a scare that the Zhodani were going to
start using them that never materialized.  I don\'t think that cities
are attacked with nuclear weapons either, even those with nuclear

On pages 22-23 of Supplement 9 (Fighting Ships) you\'ll find a cargo ship
very similar to what you describe.  It could carry a 5,000 ton rock and 
costs only MCr3,337.4.  How\'s that?

In regard to this problem, the Citizens of the Imperium sleep little better
than you do. (None of the nations of earth could do much about this, short
of low-tech version of the next set of ideas). The basic choices are:

(I\'m assuming we\'re discussing several multi-klick chunks of rock, and no one
will argue exactly what the level of effect would be - whether it would crack
the planet or simply whether it would effectively bomb the populace & the 
civilized infrastructure into oblivion.

o Evacuate if ships or a place on planet away from the effects the 
  bombardment. 

o Meet the beasties out in space with something to impart a force to 
  punch into another vector (that is one designed NOT to intercept the 
  planet). Options include nuke demolitions, various self contained engines,
  spacecraft moving at high Delta-V, meson gun fire (though remember, you
  want to MOVE the target, not break it up, although breaking it up into 
  small chunks (less than 5m long) allows the planet\'s natural defenses (ie 
  the atmosphere) to handle the problem.

o Prayer meetings.

Yup, I sure do.  If you read my post better you\'d see that I agree with you.
The couple months from the oort cloud is for the *attacker* not the defence.

My point was that an attacking fleet in CT could jump into the target
system\'s
oort cloud (something on the order of 50,000 AU out) and accelerate up to a 
large enough froction of c that the "rock" could be mearly be a lifeboat or
an
old fighter accerating on its own since it won\'t need to be massive at rest
when
it is at .99c.

The reason is to go to the oort cloud is that the attacker could hide thousands
of preprogrammed drones out there, and they\'d *never* be found.  Then they could
refuel and jump out.  This would also work if it was decided (reasonably) that
the one part in a billion jump CEP would be enough that a relativistic bomb
wouldn\'t have enough time/delta v to correct and hit.

	Err...How do you misjump into enemy territory?
	I thought that misjumps were random in nature, so you couldn\'t 
predict your exit point.  (And a variation that I occasionally use, is 
that misjumps cause damage to the J-Drive).

Sensor ranges:
I\'d missed the point about the small sensor ranges of the CT ships (1-2 
light seconds).  What do people suggest as a more useful set of values?  
I usually assume that a Type-S has some sort of passive astronomical set 
of sensors, for when it is employed on exploration duties; it has to be 
able to determine whether a Gas Giant is in its target system 2pc away, 
so it can plan its refulling stratergy.

BTW:
I use a table of fuel use for Book 2 ship designs, so my modified Type-S 
carries fuel for 2 jump-2\'s, useful for exploration/courier work, and has 
6 tons cargo (mail is 5 tons).

    The first thing that must be understood about fighters in CT/MT
combat is that what is labelled "fighter" has nothing in common with
what is labelled "fighter" in 20th century usage.  The "fighter" of
CT/MT has more in common with the PT boat than with a modern
"fighter".
    At relatively low TLs (say, 9-12), the Trav "fighter" corresponds
quite well with a modern PHM.  It has weaponry which is quite lethal
(nuclear missiles), and is (expendably) cheap.  It is also virtually
immune to fire from similar vessels (other "fighters").  Coupled with
the relative inability of large ships to harm these "fighters" (at
TL12, where the factor-9 missile bay appears, said bay weapon hits a
well-designed TL-12 fighter on 10+.  MT produces similar results),
it is easily seen that a large number of "fighters" (but a similar
VALUE of fighters) can overwhelm any large warship.
    To wit:
        500,000T warship, costing around MCr400,000 vs. 4000 fighters,
costing around MCr400,000.
    Warship has 500 missile-9 bays.  Spinal mount is ignored, since
only one can be fitted.  Hit number for the warship is 10+ (2D6).
    One hit by the warship will destroy one fighter.  Actually, given
the CT/MT rules as written, one hit will disable a fighter MOST of the
time.  But, for our purposes, we assume that a hit kills a fighter.
    "Fighters" are armed with missile-2 batteries.  Hit number for
the "fighters" is also 10+.
    One hit by a fighter will destroy one weapon, or 1% of the warship\'s
fuel supply.  
    The warship\'s armour stops about 1/12th the fighters\' hits.

    Round 1:  Warship gets 83 hits, destroys 83 fighters.
              Fighters get 611 hits, knocking out all fuel tanks on
              warship, and disabling all weapons.
    Round 2:  Warship surrenders.  Fighter pilots go home to get drunk.
              Warship crew goes to p.o.w. camp for the duration.

    Admittedly, this ignores the question of the carriers\' cost.  But
the fighters may be (should be) operating as system defense forces,
which need no carrier.  If carriers are included, the number of fighters
in the above example goes down to about 2000.  The fight then lasts two
rounds (or even three!), and costs a few more casualties...

     At higher TLs, the "fighter" corresponds better to a WW2 PT boat -
it can\'t really fight a first line warship ALONE (or even in herds), but
can assist in the destruction of warships previously damaged by your
major warships.
    In addition, "fighters" are quite capable of dealing out enormous
damage to battle-tenders and support ships (the ones without
agility-6) at ANY TL.

    As to expensive personnel - this is not usually a problem.  Any
Empire of decent size has an essentially unlimited supply of qualified
people.  Training costs money, but so does replacing 500,000T
battleships and THEIR personnel....

    A terameter trip results in a turnover speed of less than 7500Km/s,
which is 0.025c.  Relativistic effects ar not significant at speeds 
less than about 0.3c, so this is a non-problem inside a solar system.

    Why?  300 billion to sterilize a planet?  A bargain,
if you ask me ;-)
    Keep in mind that the same money invested in a war-
ship gets you most of a big battleship, which investment
won\'t be anywhere NEAR what is needed to defeat that
world...

    0.01c is none too random really.  Certainly WE have never
detected anything natural moving that fast around here.
    But if it DOES show up, then everyone dies...

    It never happened because 0.01c is too fast for "natural"
rocks.  Real solar system rocks are moving anywhere from a
few Km/s to about 80Km/s relative to Earth.  With that kind of
speed, you have AT LEAST several hours from detection to
respond.  Don\'t bother with meson guns.  Just blow off a few 
HUGE nukes on one side of the rock - it\'ll miss...or break up 
into fragments which must be dealt with separately (with smaller,
but still huge nukes)...

    The TNE rules are better, but they should be extended for really
big sensor arrays.  In my TCS game, I allowed planetary sensor webs
to locate large objects within 1AU...

In a current _Time_ article, (or was it Newsweek?), it was argued that 
the era of mass warfare (from the French revolutionary war to Korea) was 
fading away, increasing the power of "Warrior societies" like the current 
fighters in Chesnya (sp!), where 2 million Chasnyans can hope to defend 
their land from 200 million Russian\'s.

Assuming this hold\'s true to the 57th century (a large assumption, but 
possible, given Traveller technology), what would be the place of warrior 
societies be in the Third Imperium?  I *know* that they exist, for in 
Challange 55 we have a good description of a TL F Imperial Warrior 
caste, the Answerin. (who, incidentally, have been Imperial Soldiers 
since the time of the First Imperium!)  Can anyone out there 
generate/recall other Imperial warrior castes?  

And if the Imperial Marines have warrior castes, the Imperial Navy should 
be stuffed with societies which exist only for the sake of the navy! 
(...and may well be the ruling caste: how many Noble lines have links to the 
Navy?)  

---- Aside ----

Incidentally, the Third Imperium seem\'s to treat their warriors much 
better than we do: in both Canada and the U.S., the military is looked 
down upon, and is dominated by folks of working/lower-middle class orgins.
In the Answerin article, the Answerin live on a pretty good world with 
high technology (Vland: 0431 B584A85-F).  

Another aside: the Answerin tend not to favour nobility: relatively few 
characters of B+ social standing are nobles.  

---- Back to the subject ----

What *is* the purpose of mass warfare in Imperial policy: that is, 
outside of inter-Imperial wars between member states/worlds/systems?
And does mass warfare in serious wars ever actually mean "every an a 
soldier?"  I doubt it: a serious, 57th century war seems to demand the 
funneling of massive resources into the military, but only a limited 
increase of the actual number of battlefield soldiers: the existance of 
"citizen-soldiers" would be a petty nuciance on the battlefield, esp. if 
they arn\'t very motivated boys who have no passion for the fighting, 
fear getting killed (I mean, less tolerant of the lethal risks 
usually needed to get anything done on the battlefield), and haven\'t been 
raised as warriors since birth. (and, incidentally, lack a massive tech 
edge over their opponents.)

In FF&S you can get sensors that can detect things at 8 light seconds.  In 
the earlier forms of the game, you will be lucky to detect things at 2
light seconds.  Note that 100 diameters from Terra is about 4 light
seconds.
   
>>>>>	MT Refs. Guide pg.70  lists the following;
	EMS active 1.7 light seconds, EMS passive 1.029x10^8 light seconds.
	The nutrino sensors and densiometers do not have listed ranges but
	can be assumed to be similar to EMS passive except that they
	can\'t be jammed or shielded out.

 This limit in detection capability is crucial to the nature of
"system defenses".  That is, a ship in orbit around Jupiter would not
be capable of detecting the emergence of a ship near Mars.  It wouldn\'t
even be able to detect the emergence of a ship at Jupiter\'s 100 diameter
limit, frankly.

>>>>>>	So planetary sized nutrino sensors and densiometers couldn\'t give
	early warning?  (not to mention SDB and scout ship packages)

    These, coupled with the ability of a ship to jump in at the 100
diameter limit of any body in the system (plus or minus a few thousand 
(NOT million) Km) that is not itself within the 100 diameter limit of
another body, imply strongly that "defense in depth" is a ludicrous
concept in Trav.

>>>>>>	I can\'t seem to locate specific weapon ranges in MT.  It seems the
	limiting factor isn\'t the weapon but lock on ranges.  The combat
	rules seem to limit them by assigning a -1 DM for every block of
	25,000km that they are in range.  The sensor task roll for initial
	detection however seems to be "Routine, Sensor ops, Edu, 10s" from
	the players manual pg.38.  This would only be limited by the absolute
	range allowed by the sensor package, yes?

    Any ship stationed at a gas giant is going to be irrelevant to a 
battle occurring at or near the main world for several days.  Ditto any
ship stationed at a rock that might be used as a weapon.  Gas giant
refueling is a stupid idea fostered by GDW many years ago - it made
little sense then, less now.  A Fleet intent on attacking your main
world will appear, not at a gas giant, but at the 100 diameter limit
of the main world.  And all the GG squadrons you have scattered around
the system will have front row seats to watch your main world be
smashed (if that is the attacker\'s intent), since they certainly won\'t
be in position to interfere.

>>>>>	Perhaps the reason MT seems to assume GG squadrons is that a emerging 
	fleet would rather emerge farther out to give it time to accelerate to
	attack speed.  In all the examples in MT that I can find the ships
	are assumed to emerge with Vo close to zero.  This seems to be 
	because of error in jump emergence time.(pg.12 MT starship op mnl)	

As to "immediate action" against KE weapons:
What might those be?  If the rock is heading straight toward your
planet, it\'ll be in range of planetary defenses only the last 300,000
Km (for older versions of Trav, about 2,400,000 Km for TNE).  If the 
rock is moving in at 1500 Km/s (slow for older versions, fast for TNE),
then you only get three minutes to respond.  Since it is heading for
your planet, nothing less than destruction or redirection will 
suffice.

>>>>>	How about motoring another planetoid in the way?

    And destruction is only going to be possible with LARGE nukes.
REALLY LARGE NUKES.  Which you may well have.  But you won\'t be
launching them till you detect the target, which won\'t be till about
five minutes before impact.  At 12G\'s, assuming ZERO reaction time
for local defense forces (not too likely), you get your first chance
to hit the rock at about 5000Km above atmosphere.  If the first misses,
you have no second shot.  If it hits, then, in addition to any pieces
of the rock still coming down, your entire civilization gets a lesson
in EMP generated by a large nuke popped off near the planet.

>>>>>	I\'d settle for for putting something in your way.  How about some
	pre-positioned planetoids with some of those "big" nukes aboard
	out along the predicted axis of attack?  If 6g isn\'t enough to get
	in the way, the nukes are that much closer.

    And, of course, all my comments only apply to slow moving rocks.
Push the rock to 0.9c (any good battleship can do it in older versions
of Trav), and all bets are off.  You get first detection 0.2 seconds
before impact.  Which was about the amount of time required for you
to read the phrase "before impact" back there.  Bye, bye...

>>>>>	There is perhaps an argument against emergence at anything near a
	zero Vo without correction.  In all the time calculations in MT I can
	find they *always* reference an initial velocity near zero.  Perhaps
	the faster you go into jump, the more emergence error is likely to
	crop up and the more serious it gets.

MS>	SDBs with atomic and possibly anti-matter weapons would be at the
MS>	outer reaches of the system.  Spinal mounts burried on major worlds
MS>	could be brought to bare immediatly.

    WHy would they be there?  *I* certainly won\'t be there attacking 
them.  I\'ll attack your main world where they are helpless to 
intervene (being days away at max accel).  And your spinal mounts
on major worlds are NOT mutually supporting, and CANNOT be brought
to bear immediately.

>>>>>	MT seems to make the assumption that fleets would first emerge
	deeper in the system than the 100 diameter limit.  Why would they
	do this?  Perhaps jump emergency isn\'t as cut and dried as you seem
	to think that it is.  ("Making the jump into hyper-space ain\'t like
	dustin\' crops boy....-H.Solo)  Fleets wouldn\'t want to emerge at a 
	low Vo incase they need to immediatly evade fire, but a high Vo
	might introduce a significant emergence error and scatter the neet
	formation of the fleet.  So they need the time dress their lines and
	move to a even higer Vo than is possible before jump is made.

MS>	Add to that the possibility of capital ships being in system, and
MS>	defending chunks of rock that could be used to collide with the 
MS>	inbound ship give the system an almost certain chance of foiling
MS>	such attacks.

    I could only pray that my opponents be that stupid...
    If you scatter your fleet all over your system, then several
    things occur: 1)  your fleets can be defeated in detail by a small part
of
    MY fleet. 2)  your fleets will prove no threat at all to my worlds, 
    thus freeing up more of my fleet to beat on YOUR worlds.
    3)  And your fleets will not actually help defend your worlds
    at all...

>>>>>	Large capital ships would be near the mainworld.  SDBs would be
	just outside of the planets main sensor range along threat axii.
	Secondary passive bouys would be out system, with pluto like planets
	with BIG sensor arrays providing distant early warning. 

If it is aimed at your world, then damaging the
propulsion system GUARANTEES a hit.  Serendip Belt tried this against
Neubayern just before the end of the game - aim at their world, then
if they shoot you, you hit their world, doing far more damage than
would have been done if you allowed them to bombard your world...

>>>>>	Get to the rock far out and KO the sensors and engineering so it
	can\'t recorrect.  Then use planetiods in system to collide or use
	their big nukes to knock it into a miss vector.

This only works if you detect the rock BEFORE it is aimed at you.
And you won\'t, since Trav sensors aren\'t good enough for that...

>>>>>	The combat rules of traveller seem to reinforce this.  The player
	rules and common sense seem to go the otherway.  Passive EMS, nutrino, 
	and densiometers can have "interseteller range" yet accru a -1 DM for
	each hex (25,000km) in combat?  In addition the super high tec long
	range sensors are no better than the short range sensors because 
	beyond 16 hexes detection is impossible because of accumulated 
	negitive range modifications.  This seems like an illogical state
	of affairs.  

	MT isn\'t realy a wargame and *I* think they have neglected certain
	points simply they haven\'t thought them through in print.  It hasn\'t
	been necessary.

The outer planets are billions of Km from the
main world, and the sensors only detect out to a few million Km last
time I checked.  Or are you posting sentry ships out around Pluto\'s 
orbit?

>>>>>	Passive bouys out there with a manned station to monitor them
	at Charon would work.  I\'d build a BIG array on Phobos with
	power and megacomputer as well.  Bigger than any ship could 
	realy have.  Have a few weapos bouys too with nuke missiles.

  That means you should be able to get by with around 10,000,000
sentry ships.  And one of them will be in weapons\' range of the
relativistic target for about 1 second after detection...good luck on 
getting a hit.  Especially since your missiles will NEVER catch the
target - you\'ll have to vaporize the target with your lasers/PAs/meson
guns.  One shot each...;-)

>>>>>	Try passive bouys with much longer range, and use triangulation
	to get a fix and track.  Vector insystem SDBs from that.  Active
	bouys could be hidden to snap on if a ship gets too close and
	provide targeting data.  12g missiles with sensor packages could
	be vectored down a line of bearing to get a fix for deep site
	meson guns with "interplanetary" range.

    As to "massive interceptors", show me how.  Design a ship that
can stop a deadfall that is fighting back.  Use BR to test it out.  Or
High Guard, or MT.  Your choice.  Then assume a suicidal Tigress.  See
how well your interceptor works.

>>>>>	How about a 2Mton buffered planetoid with maneuver drives that
	interposes itself.  Now assume that Ms. Tigress is diving in against
	Sol with a Solomani fleet present.  With Luna in Earthling hands.
	Hmm, how many harpoints can the moon hold? Earth?

Then repeat until you get one that
will work nine times out of ten.  Note that in all three systems you
get basically one turn of firing before the impact occurs.  Good luck...
you\'ll need it.

>>>>>	Weapon range for laser weapons, missiles, and meson guns is seemingly
	only limited by sensor range.  Passive sensors in the players rules
	seem to be capable of MUCH more than the combat rules allow.  How
	a GM interprets this gaff is a matter of speculation.  There is
	no mention of actual fleet tatics and the existance of bouys, 
	planetary size sensors, or even the acceleration capability of 
	missiles.


    Okay, I\'ll bite.  How do you locate the weapon?  *MINE* is in deep
space about two light years from any star.  Good luck...you\'ll need it.

>>>>>	Densiometer with an intersellar range?  

(inaccuracy in emergenc orientation)
I must have missed that part of the rules.  Can you tell me which 
page they are on?
    Not that it matters much, since your sensors aren\'t good enough to
detect me more than 50 diameters out or so...

>>>>>	The Starship Operators Manual eludes to temporal jump error
	which makes a -/+ 10% in the time.  All the emergence examples
	have a zero Vo, but the Starship Ops. Mln. says that pre-jump

	is a lack of consistancy in the rules.

So try it.  Design the defenses.  Try them out.  See what REALLY 
works.  Don\'t offer ignorant guesses when you don\'t have to...

>>>>>	Ahem, the MT battle rules are not to the quality of HARPOON or
	any other similar naval or space oriented wargame.  If I have
	made assumption based on good sense wargaming forgive me.

    USAF missile silo crews have a response time of about ten minutes.
Too long...  
    Here\'s an experiment for you.  Sit down near your stereo.  Every time
you hear a car\'s horn go off, hit the \'play" button.  See if you can
do this within two seconds EVERY time it happens during the next six
months.  Get a friend to help...

>>>>	Fine.  Set up my computer to listen and trip the button for me.
	If a question comes up have it beep me.  In the meantime the
	computer will "fire" for me as long as SOP is met.  Everytime.

    That should get you the general timezone of the problem.  Not that
you can aim your meson gun that fast.  I\'m not even willing to bet that
a meson gun can be powered up that fast.  Nor would I care to guess
whether a meson gun could stay powered up for six months at a time...

>>>>>	Nice big fusion plant nearyby, two or more redundant capacitor
	banks for rapid fire.  Another beef I have with the "rules."
	A planet(oid) can affort the displacement for multiple shot
	capacitors and can have vastly larger powergenerators.

S>    Note that four months can get you  a rock moving at 1/3c.
S> That give you 8 or 9 seconds to react, including 2 to 3 seconds 
S> for the detector net to even DETECT the rock.  Six seconds to
S> go to Red Alert and get a fire-control solution.   Good luck.

>>>>>	Assuming that large Vo jump speeds arn\'t a problem.  If the rock
	is off it\'s jump vector by even a small fraction of a degree it
	will fail to collide with the planet, and at that speed no amount
	of "G" will allow it to correct if its within the 100 diameter limit.

	If you come out far enough out to correct up to a say 5degree error
	it gives the defender time to put a buffered planetoid in the way
	and get missiles out.

And you won\'t detect it till it is 2400x10^6 meters away...which 
is about 24 seconds before impact...
Or maybe 600x10^6 meters away.  6 seconds to impact.
Note that you lose several seconds due to lightspeed limits
here - the rock will only be 16 (or 4) seconds away when the light
from your sensors gets back to you to let you know its coming...

>>>>>	Passive sensors seem to be able to do better than this.  Even
	MT combat relies on a "flat" universe.  Use a bouy line to pick up
	an attacker at range.

MS >>>>> .33c rock bound insystem.  I\'d call that a pretty obvious threat.

If you are a fast typist, then you took around five seconds to type
that line.  The rock just hit.  Bye, bye...

>>>>>	My computer is quite a bit faster than that.  It let it fire.

You still have to AIM that monster meson gun.  Unless the 
enemy is unlucky enough to drop it insystem right in the line with
the "rest" position for the weapon...

>>>>>	MT seems to assume that jump emergence is in the same general region
	from the same point.  Just point your gun along the threat axis where
	your enemy fleets are.  Intersellar sensors and scouts should allow
	a clue as to where the enemy fleets are located.

The really interesting thing here is that you disbelieve that
the rock can actually be accurate enough to hit the planet without 
terminal corrections, but you believe that your meson gun can hit a
target one one-millionth the size of a planet moving 10,000 times
faster than the planet with only five or six seconds of preparation.

>>>>>>	I argue this way because the plausibility of fleets is ruined if

	to be replaced by jump behemoths with 1 g accelerations.  I rally

following excerpt one character discusses why:

\'Yes\', Stefan said, \'but there\'s a difference how they react to
fictional contact and how they might react to the reality. At least
that\'s the opinion o mnay scientists, especially the soft
sciences like sociology and psychology. And anthropologists 
tell us that when an advanced culture interacts with one less 
advanced, the less advanced culture suffers a loss of confidence
in -- and often a complete colapse of -- its traditions, institutions.
The primitive culture loses respect for its religeons and systems
of government. Its sexual practices, social values, and family
structures deteriorate. Look at what happened to the Eskimos
following their encounter with Western civilization: soaring
alchoholism, family-destroying generational conflict, a high
rate of suicide... It\'s not that Western civilization is dangerous
or evil. It isn\'t. But out culture was far more sophisticated and
richly textured than the Eskimo culture, and contact led to a
serious loss of self esteem among the Eskimos that they\'ve 
never regainwed and never will.\'

             [Dean Koontz, \'Strangers\', Headling 1986]

I must say that I agree with this. I can\'t vouch for Western civilizations
influence on Eskimo culture, but it has effected Australian Aboriginal
culture this way: alchoholism, suicide, loss of esteem, the whole bit.

Has any of this been discussed in the Traveller context? Imperial contact
through surveys, wars and other such things would surely have a profound
and long lasting, if not permanent, effect on intergalactic culture, be
they humaniti (how did the Zhodani and Vilani affect the Solomani?)

I just read a hilarious tale on Gopher Jewels, where a conventional sub 
commander in 1970 had a problem with a bent propeller.  When trying to 
get a replacement, he asked for a four-bladed propeller, but headquarters 
insisted on giving him a five-bladed propeller. He demanded a diver to 
count the blades, and he said that there were *five* blades on his sub, 
not four!  In the end, he managed to convince the base to drydock his 
boat, where everyone could count the blades: and lo and behold! it was four!

Can anyone here convert this bizzare tale to Imperial Navy terms?

  IMPERIAL DOOMSDAY PROJECT 005
  EYES ONLY
  DATA STORAGE ON CRYSTAL SN CL2001893 ONLY

     What is the most inaccessible location in the Imperium, 
containing possibly the most effective weapon?  IDP005, originally 
Imperial Relativistic Project A930J1 from year 528, is moving at 
.87c, or 87% the speed of light, and cannot easily be reached by any 
Imperial or known alien craft.  

     Consisting of 9 ice/rock asteroids, 11 jump capable tugs, and a 
lifetime crew, these projectiles are stored in deep space at speed, 
and strategically shuffled to be available against hostile activity.  
Each unit is designed to be delivered, at speed, to hostile activity 
on a planetary scale.  The unit\'s tug, with personnel, separate upon 
delivery and rendevous with asteroid/tug IDP005-13, for refueling, 
decelleration, and acquistion of a new asteroid payload.  

     All resupply and project crew replacements are made during the 
acquistion phase, if necessary.  When in formation, shuttle transfer
is possible between units, such as personnel transfer or replacement. 
To date, three personel from five availabilities have been replaced 
by frozen watch stored aboard IDP005-13.  Two attempts out of three at 
psionic teleportation for crew transfer have failed.

     Tugs IDP005-2 and IDP005-7 are no longer available.  Tug
IDP005-4 is parked on IDP005-13 awaiting either repair parts for
decelleration or cannibalization as the situation warrants.  And
tug IDP005-1 is 60% through a decelleration phase.

     Routine information transfer occurs on a monthly basis. 
Standard Operating Procedure for contact is to send an intelligence 
ship on a precise schedule to the Crystal-Level secure co-ordinates, 
power down ALL ship systems, secure crew, activate pre-set automated 
comms transfer, and then return for comprehensive debrief.

     Use of IDP005 results in planetary destruction of any body
smaller than a proto-star.  Only heavy-ore salvagable material
remain.  Considerable navigable hazards will exist in immediate
vicinity.

     All positional data is Crystal-Level secure (no human access).  
All strategic information is Eyes-Only secure.  

End Of File.

While thinking about the nobility, I remembered that they have their own 
court system and code of law.  I immediately wondered exactly how would 
Imperial intellectual\'s justify a two-tier code of justice to the masses.

One of the things that come to mind is the fact that every noble - up to 
a point - represent\'s the Emperor himself.  Since the laws exist at the 
pleasure of the Emperor + nobility, it cannot be expected that the 
Nobility can be judged in the same courts as the masses.

A different approach is the assumption that local law bound\'s locals, not 
Nobility, who represent an interstellar community.  The laws that do 
bound the nobles tend to be much fewer and less culturaly influenced (ie. 
local social + religious mores) than the law for the masses, but (I 
expect) would have much more strigent penalities if broken.

Yet another approach is to assume that Noble law is indeed a law 
influenced by social + religious mores, but these mores are specific to 
Noble society.  In effect, the nobles have their own local law, but this 
law is tied up to people, not systems. 

To the extent that noble law is praticed, it seems that nobles are ruled 
by a mix of Noble law, Imperial law ("the law of space"), and local 
conditions on the local Noblity.  For example, Archduke Dulinor wore 
black as Dlan\'s religion insisted that he should as a unbeliever.  A 
marque somewhere (I lack the reference, but it does exist) must be 
blinded when he assends the throne.  Without a doubt, there are other 
situations where the noble must be of Solomani decent (true for the 
Irridium Throne itself for over 600 years), do a yearly religious ritual, 
mate for life, or somesuch.

However, some laws seem to apply to all nobles: ie. the restriction on 
anagathics (a law or a custom?), a preference for natural-born families 
(Norris refered to his female clone with a euphimism, implying that he 
was breaking the norm), a specific style of succession ("Noble-style 
succession"), etc.

Finally, while some nobles may rule with brutality on their own fiefs, 
they seem to avoid this outside of their territory, implying that 
Imperial law -- a no-frills legal code, similar to the Ten Commandments 
(with piracy thrown in!) -- applies to the nobility also.  This also 
included Cleon\'s order that no living sentient may be murdered, by 
nobility or by anyone else.

---- Aside ----

I wouldn\'t be surprised if a massive section of the Noble Code revolves 
around protocol, diplomatic + trade powers, etc.  I tend to envision the 
nobility as "the great interface layer" between the Imperial government + 
megacorps and the local subjects. 

Does anyone here care to guess of the Noble Code is different for High, 
Honour and Administrative nobles?  I tend to doubt it: even barons are 
permitted into the Imperial Moot, after all.

---- And on a related subject ----

Exactly what kind of judging powers does a noble have?  Certainly, they 
are the judicary regarding interstellar matters, or any matters outside 
of a formally recognized member-world (ie uninhabited worlds).

example, was very destructive when it first became widely available in the
18th century.  Humans were used to mild intoxicating beverages like beer

the society or were subject to social controls.  The introduction of gin
and other hard liquor caused massive social problems, as folks drank
themselves to death and such.  The result - temperance movements and
social controls on drinking to limit the damage caused by this new threat
to the society.  In the same way, we are currently trying to learn to deal
with crack and other drugs. 

The point is, we have had a long time to adapt to these changes.  
Isolated cultures coming into contact with mainstream civilization go

society is under great preasure, and often collapses.  This situation is 
agravated by disease exposure, as we discussed earlier in this group.

What does this mean for Traveller?  Well, I would expect that over the

biomoney, virtual religion, you name it.  This might explain some of the

Hi there,

One of the lurkers here.

I am currently in a Pseudo-Traveller with the characters done in GURPS
campaign called UN SPACE.  It started as a CT game, and is now a ad-hoc
mix of CT/MT/GURPS the planets are mostly CT with some upgraded to MT
Extended System generation.

The GM is currently working on new colonies for the annual updates,
which involves rolling up an extended system for each.  I would like
to make this a bit easier for him, so I can get to updateing the 
starcharts/subsector listings I keep on my computer. (His stuff is
all hand written.  My maps are the mainworld in dbase with a prg
that outputs a Ventura Table Formatted text file, with the subsector
/sector maps in Designer 3.0.  It has been a lot easier to replace 
maps sence I set my system up.)

I was thinking about just writing a program for his PC to generate 
systems for him, and he could just assign them to the new systems
when it occured to me that the program I want is probably already
existant in one of the archives somewhere.  Could someone point me
to such a program?

I do not have FTP access myself, and last time I tried the ftpmail
servers it took about a week to get a reply, so I don\'t really feel
like searching for randome files that MIGHTT be what I want.  I do
however have friends that I can impose upon if I know the filename
and where it is.

Thanks for any help.

I think there are a number of responses that can be made to such an
assertion. First of all, I do not believe the military of today is looked
upon with as much disdain today as it was twenty years ago. A good deal of
the difference is that there is greater selectivity and quality in
personnel today. While there are a few factions in society who scorn the
military, I have not observed anything close to universal disdain or
contmpt for the military. As for the many personnel having lower/working
class origins. . .the militry has traditionally been a place where men (and
now women) can further themselves in society. The military provides a good
amount of training, basic needs (food, clothing, shelter) and discipline
that can help someone who is properly motivated to rise above their
station.

This ignores, of course, the implicit assumption that an organization made
up of the lower class is inherently disdained. . . :)

>Another aside: the Answerin tend not to favour nobility: relatively few
>characters of B+ social standing are nobles.

There\'s little need for it. While not familiar with the warrior caste you
speak of, I would offer that in a military culture such as theirs, noble
rank would be superfluous. Military rank handles any need for hierarchical
social divisions.

WAR IN THE EMPIRE
>What *is* the purpose of mass warfare in Imperial policy: that is,
>outside of inter-Imperial wars between member states/worlds/systems?

Umm, do you mean "intra-Imperial wars between member states"? Your original
statement refers to wars between the member states of different Empires,
but I take it you mean to serious warfare between member states within the
Imperium.

In the latter case, I rather imagine that "serious warfare" occurs when
there is a significant contest that the Imperium is unwilling to resolve -
which would be rare. While the Imperium seems to allow combat, I doubt it
would allow major conflicts to last too long, lest they interfere with the
functioning of the Imperium itself. See Dune for an example - two Houses
duke it out over personal matters, but when interstellar trade is
threatened, the Empire comes in (and gets its ass kicked anyway :)

>"citizen-soldiers" would be a petty nuciance on the battlefield, esp. if
>they arn\'t very motivated boys who have no passion for the fighting,

Yeah, but in "serious warfare" as I read it, those citizens *would* be very
motivated - as motivated as the French were in WW2, or possibly the
Israelis in the various wars they\'ve fought in the past half-century.

CULTURAL INFLUENCES
>I must say that I agree with this. I can\'t vouch for Western civilizations
>influence on Eskimo culture, but it has effected Australian Aboriginal
>culture this way: alchoholism, suicide, loss of esteem, the whole bit.

Ahem.

I also cannot relate much about the Eskimo encounters with western
civilation. Before going further, I will say that I have never found
aboriginal cultures to have any moral superiority over the Great White
Invaders, as some would call the Euopean explorers. However, I think that
the above asserion cannot go unchallenged, given my experience with Native
Americans. It is very difficult to maintain your self-esteem when your
people are forcefully moved across a time zone or two, told that they must
stay in one place rather than roam freely (as they have done before) and
have your children taken into schools of the foreigner and disciplined for
daring to speak their native tongue. When you grow up on a reservation and
see nothing but drunken indians living in tin shacks in the middle of the
desert, suicide becomes quite an attractive option. The reasons they have
poor self-esteem are the same as poor people all through time.

If you ask me, many of the ills that plague such societies come from
restrictions placed upon them by the more advanced culture, not
overwhelming awe at their power. A more responsible approach is to teach
the less developed culture and work with them; historically this has rarely
been done.

THE NOBILITY
>While thinking about the nobility, I remembered that they have their own
>court system and code of law.  I immediately wondered exactly how would
>Imperial intellectual\'s justify a two-tier code of justice to the masses.

I would begin by looking at historical examples. Of course, in Europe a
great deal of the support came from the Church, and there doesn\'t seem to
be a vast Imperial Church. . .though there could be. At any rate, the
general thought was that there was a divene pyramid, starting with God and
going down throught the layers of liege lords all the way down to the
peasants.

>pleasure of the Emperor + nobility, it cannot be expected that the
>Nobility can be judged in the same courts as the masses.

Ah. . .sort of like Congress :)

>A different approach is the assumption that local law bound\'s locals, not
>Nobility, who represent an interstellar community.  The laws that do

Ah. . .I would like to assume that some nobles are culturally tied to the
worlds they rule. In fact, I would argue that the ruler\'s beliefs will
influence the culture\'s.

>Yet another approach is to assume that Noble law is indeed a law
>influenced by social + religious mores, but these mores are specific to
>Noble society.  In effect, the nobles have their own local law, but this
>law is tied up to people, not systems.

Here you get into grey territory. While there may not be an Imperial
Church, there must be some Imperium-wide social system for ruling these
matters.

>To the extent that noble law is praticed, it seems that nobles are ruled
>by a mix of Noble law, Imperial law ("the law of space"), and local

"Noble Law"? I\'m not that familiar with Traveller; is there such a thing?
Of course they are rules by Imperial law. As for local law. . .don\'t they
make the local laws?

>conditions on the local Noblity.  For example, Archduke Dulinor wore
>black as Dlan\'s religion insisted that he should as a unbeliever.  A

That is absolutely silly. Someone who doesn\'t believe in the faith
following one of the faith\'s rules? That\'s like a pagan feeling bad for
being excommunicated. The only reason for it would be if Dlan was a
powerful or troublesome state that Dulinor needed to pacify - and even then
he\'d probably throw on the tie-dye when the trouble was over.

>However, some laws seem to apply to all nobles: ie. the restriction on
>anagathics (a law or a custom?), a preference for natural-born families

Again, what you need is a system that enforces the same traditions across
all space. Historically this was the Church. In the Imperium, it\'s
something else, something not defined.Laws won\'t do it. It has to be
something deep, something that\'s harder to break than a law.

Okay, so we didn\'t get as far as conscription, but had (for example) the
Gulf war dragged on a while, it might have happened.

>...what would be the place of warrior societies be in the Third Imperium?

I don\'t know about whole societies but my games certainly involve a goodly
number of mercenary groups. I feel GDW must have felt this way too - you
only have to look at the amount of Mercenary-orientated data presented in
the original CT books and supplements.

>And does mass warfare in serious wars ever actually mean "every [m]an a

I don\'t think raw recruits would ever reach a high tech battlefield - as
pointed out, they just wouldn\'t have the experience to handle the
battledress and fusion guns! However, a large number could be conscripted
into the other (50%+) of the army, i.e. support services, medical
facilities, drivers, military police, etc. and those that did get into
uniform and were given guns would be posted to garrisons (to free the
trained troops needed at the front line), etc. So there is a place for the
conscript which doesn\'t involve the words "cannon fodder".
:-)

Brian Hoover then mentions the sychological/social effects of a low tech
society meeting a higher tech one.

Hmmm... can\'t see that being an easy one to make into a game. Could be a
very important factor for TNE though, given all the re-discovery of planets
going on with the RCES [apologies for mentioning TNE on this list!] :-)

Alvin Plummer then went on to discuss:

Imperial intellectuals don\'t have to justify a danged thing. Just as the UK
judicial system doesn\'t have to justify the fact that innocent passersby can
be (effectively) tortured into giving confessions and be locked away for
life for alleged terrorist activities whereas the excessively rich can

Congratulations on putting some adventure into the Rocks discussion. 

Given the restricted nature of these rock throwing thingies as discussed in
many previous mailings...

WOULD ANYONE CARE TO SUGGEST which *individual* planets (not just \'the
Zhodani\', etc.) are likely users or targets? i.e. which have mad
dictatorships AND a close-by planet whom they abhore? i.e. which could you
put into a campaign without upsetting the Imperial balance - clearly if
rock-throwing was commonplace, GDW would have mentioned it at some point?

referring to the "dominated by folks of

Now the Imperium has lots of people to fight and feel good

    Same book, I forget the page:

    To locate a target with sensors:  difficulty, Off: Computer number,
Def: Range, confrontation.

    Range is further defined as number of 25,000Km squares between
sensor and target.  difficulty is defined for sensor ranges (simple 
for the 2parsec sensors you speak of).
    Which means that at 1.029x10^8 light seconds, you have to roll
3+ on 2D6 - 1,234,800,000.  Good luck...

    Not in those games.  The real world should allow planets to have
significantly better sensors than a ship can carry, but the game does
not support that notion.  Note that in another note, I said that I
allowed planets to detect things at 1AU-plus in my games...
    As to scout ships, they are stuck with the same sensors that bigger
ships have.  Best case in MT allows detection at 450,000Km.  Which means
a minimum of 4500 scouts to provide coverage at 30,000,000Km.  100 times
that number can provide coverage at 300,000,000Km...

    No.  If that were so, then a ship could be detected at a range of
2 parsecs by any scout ship (all the ones I designed had the best
sensors allowed).  I believe that the Referee\'s Book supersedes any-
thing in the Players Book as regards task difficulties.  Note that it
is ultimately up to the Referee to assign task difficulties, and so
the Ref may choose to make detection of incoming rocks automatic at
ranges of 2 parsecs if that\'s what he wants...

    MT assumes GG squadrons because the people at GDW never bothered
to push the numbers through a calculator.  Neither have you, it seems.
    Travel time from Jupiter at 6Gs (average distance): 63.34 hours.
    This is how long your GG squadron will be out of the battle.
    If I jump to your home planet\'s 100 diameter limit at zero relative
velocity, I am within weapon\'s range of your planet in 1.44 hours,
assuming an "average" sized planet.  Your GG squadron will be 61.9
hours late to save anything.
    Note that the notion of GG refueling is intwined in all versions of
Trav.  It makes very little sense in ANY version of Trav.
    Economically, a merchant will lose large amounts of money by using
GG refueling.
    Militarily, using drop tanks to arrive with full tanks makes much
more sense than giving the enemy three days\' warning of your coming...
    So why go to gas giants?

    Fascinating!  Really!  You conjecture that actually hitting a 
planet is next to impossible with a fast rock because it cannot 
change course quickly enough to hit the planet.  On the other hand,
you CAN hit a much smaller target, moving much faster (the rock)
with EXACTLY THE SAME WEAPON THAT COULDN\'T POSSIBLY HIT THE PLANET...
    Think, man!!!

    You _are_ aware that planetoids move, right?  It\'sa usually called
"orbit".  So they won\'t stay in the positions you put them in.
    And what are the "predicted axis of attack"?  IMHO, any competent
genocidal maniac will pick his axis of attack to be AWAY from any
rocks you preposition.  *I* certainly would.  And if your sensors are
good enough to detect the incoming rock at vast distances, then my
spy ships can detect YOUR rocks at vast distances.  SO your rocks 
can\'t hide or anything, and I WILL know where to aim away from...

    There is perhaps such an argument.  Not likely, or it would have
been mentioned SOMEWHERE in SOME iteration of the rules.  I personally
believe that GDW never considered that possibility, mostly because
they never actually calculated how long these trips actually take...

    Well, no.  Jump is accurate to within a few thousand Km, according 
to articles on the subject published by GDW.  I have never seen any 
reason for ships to be within that range of each other anyway, so the
minor error so introduced can be ignored.
    Why wouldn\'t fleets want to emerge with a low velocity?  As I 
pointed out above, it will only take an hour and a half to reach
bombardment range of your planet starting from zero velocity...
    Also, you missed my point somewhat.  Given that I choose to
emerge from jump-space somewhere within 1000 (not 100) diameters of
yuour planet, then it is likely (unless I am stupid, which I am not)
that I will avoid popping out near your GG\'s.  In which case, I will
be far enough away that the squadrons there will never get involved 
in the battle.
    Consider.  If I *REALLY* want your gas giant (for whatever insane
reason), I jump in with a fleet to attack your homeworld.  Starting 
from 1000 diameters out ot give you a good detection chance, my decoys
(destroyers without EMM, and suchlike) race toward your homeworld.
Your gas giant squadron gives chase.  About two hours before our
forces meet, my fleet jumps away.  Your gas giant squadron is no
longer protecting your gas giant, so my second fleet assumes control
by default.
    If your GG squadron was NOT lured away, then the decoys proceed 
to bombard your homeworld (even a scout can carry a lot of nuclear
weapons, and these things would be DESIGNED to carry a lot of
weapons.
    Either way, your gas giant squadron has done nothing useful.
    Consider also that even in the conventional Trav picture, your
GG squadron has to be comparable to the attacking force to do any-
thing worthwhile.  This solar system has four gas giants to defend.
If you leave one open, then I use that one.  If you don\'t, then you
have to spread your fleet into at least five unsupporting elements
to defend them all (plus your world).  Getting five:one odds is
pretty easy if your fleet is broken up into five pieces, and mine
isn\'t...;-)

    What are the threat axii?
    And, I trust you are not stupid enough to think that Pluto is 
"closer" to the edge of the system than Terra is?  Pluto is closer 
to ONE SIDE than Terra is.  Terra is closer to the other sides.
    Note that emergence at 10,000,000,000 Km from the sun may mean
that Pluto is only 4.1 billion away.  It may mean that Pluto is
15.9 billion away...probably closer to the latter than the former
if your attacker has any brains...
    So sensor platforms out there are a waste of time.

    You\'re still insisting that the rock can\'t hit the planet without
extensive corrections, but that your rocks can hit my rock without
extensive corrections.
    You should also look sometime at the timescale in CT and MT.  Note
that one combat turn is longer than a fast rock is in weapons range...

    Certainly does.  Note however, that changes to the rules to 
protect your fantasies are not my prerogative.  If you want to
allow sensors to detect rocks at 100,000AU, that\'s your privilege.
    I point out, however, that it works BOTH ways.  If you can 
detect him at 100,000AUs, he can detect you at the same ranges.
Consider carefully what this means before you implement it.  For
instance, it means that ships cannot hide ANYWHERE in a system.  As
soon after emergence as your sensors are functional, they are 
tracking EVERY warship/merchantship/ships\'s boat in the system.  So
much for smuggling by your PCs.  SO much for going ANYWHERE without 
virtually EVERYONE knowing where they are at all times.  SO much
for piracy...

    WHich leaves them only 12,000,000,000 Km from my entry point

    My, you\'re adding a lot to MT to make this work.  Why not stick 
within the "Rules"?  Or if not, then can I posit things outside the
"Rules" for my rock?  Or is going outside the "rules" strictly
YOUR prerogative?

    Once again, the assumption that I can\'t hit your planet, but you 
can hit my rock? 
    As to your moon, doesn\'t matter, really.  I\'ll come in on the far
side at 0.95c.  I\'ll be in weapons range of the moon for less than
one-half second.  I\'ll be in weapons range of the planet for only 
a second and a half.  As I recall from MT, all weapons tasks are 
"Absolute", meaning that they take one turn (neither more, neither
less) to execute.  Since one turn is on the order of 20 minutes, I\'ll
have wrecked your planet LOOONG before they get a shot.

    Keep in mind that a fleet can wreck your planet with his meson

    You are making an even more assinine assumption now.  YOu assume
that if it works that way now, it\'ll still be that way in the future
after technology changes/improves.  This is falaacious, as all the 
guys who assumed that a tank was just an armoured horse (and could
be used the same way) assumed.  Note that modern wargames work
considerably differently than ancients wargames.  There is a reason
for this:  the technology is different...

    Are you talking TNE now?  Caps have no place in MT.  ALso, 
presence or absence of power does not necessarily imply ability
to power up quickly.  Above a certain point, you are just
wasting power.  And if a meson gun can power up in two seconds, 
why can\'t it fire every two seconds, instead of every half hour?

    SO how to explain fleets when any planet mounts weapons that can 
destroy any ship anywhere in the solar system?  You are assuming that
the universe will work the way you want it to.  Which it will, by
decree, if you are the referee.  SOunds like a dull universe to me.
Anything really DANGEROUS has been declared arbitrarily impossible...
    COnsider carefully though that your players may not cooperate
with you by NOT looking for the loopholes in your rules changes.
In much the same fashion as the TML has been probing for holes in the
Trav assumptions for years.  Declaring all holes to be filled mostly
just makes other tears in the fabric of reality for your players to
jump through.

    Which, I guess, are my last words on the subject this time.  You
will not concede that there is a danger from falling rocks (your
privilege).  I will not concede that anything that will make you
safe from relativistic rocks will not also make you safe from ANY
fleet.  So what\'s the point of discussing the issue?

    As to scout ships, they are stuck with the same sensors that bigger
ships have.  Best case in MT allows detection at 450,000Km.  Which means
a minimum of 4500 scouts to provide coverage at 30,000,000Km.  100 times
that number can provide coverage at 300,000,000Km...

>>>>>	Sure, it\'s just that ton for ton scouts tend to have better sensors.
	Manned ships wouldn\'t be necessary for a system.  Just put out bouys.

(lock on ranges limit range)
If that were so, then a ship could be detected at a range of
2 parsecs by any scout ship (all the ones I designed had the best
sensors allowed).  I believe that the Referee\'s Book supersedes any-
thing in the Players Book as regards task difficulties.  Note that it
is ultimately up to the Referee to assign task difficulties, and so
the Ref may choose to make detection of incoming rocks automatic at
ranges of 2 parsecs if that\'s what he wants...

	rules.  Using a passive sensor to get a lock on (fix) is difficult
	so is limited by the combat -1 DM per 25,000Km.  This seems a bit
	short, but that\'s the rules (Ugh!).  It seems that a penalty per
	range band would be more appropriate, not this strait linear 
	progression which squelches any long range fire/detection.

	Detection and tracking should be possible from much further out IMO.

MT assumes GG squadrons because the people at GDW never bothered

	you or I haven\'t looked at yet.  Oh, I have looked at the calculations

Note that the notion of GG refueling is intwined in all versions of
Trav.  It makes very little sense in ANY version of Trav.
Economically, a merchant will lose large amounts of money by using
GG refueling. Militarily, using drop tanks to arrive with full tanks makes
much
more sense than giving the enemy three days\' warning of your coming...
So why go to gas giants?

>>>>>	I see your point.  The only thing I can think of is if the mainworld

    Fascinating!  Really!  You conjecture that actually hitting a 
planet is next to impossible with a fast rock because it cannot 
change course quickly enough to hit the planet.  On the other hand,
you CAN hit a much smaller target, moving much faster (the rock)
with EXACTLY THE SAME WEAPON THAT COULDN\'T POSSIBLY HIT THE PLANET...

	to get an interposition if your rock is at (1/3)c, then again if you
	are going that fast at the 100 diameter limit your maximum error in
	asmith is .005 degrees.  Given only 12.8 seconds to correct your

   And what are the "predicted axis of attack"?  IMHO, any competent
genocidal maniac will pick his axis of attack to be AWAY from any
rocks you preposition.  *I* certainly would.  And if your sensors are
good enough to detect the incoming rock at vast distances, then my
spy ships can detect YOUR rocks at vast distances.  SO your rocks 
can\'t hide or anything, and I WILL know where to aim away from...

>>>>>>	MT seems to imply that a jump from one system emerges in the next

Jump is accurate to within a few thousand Km, according 
to articles on the subject published by GDW.  I have never seen any 
reason for ships to be within that range of each other anyway, so the
minor error so introduced can be ignored.

Note that emergence at 10,000,000,000 Km from the sun may mean
that Pluto is only 4.1 billion away.  It may mean that Pluto is
15.9 billion away...probably closer to the latter than the former
if your attacker has any brains...

     I point out, however, that it works BOTH ways.  If you can 
detect him at 100,000AUs, he can detect you at the same ranges.
Consider carefully what this means before you implement it.  For
instance, it means that ships cannot hide ANYWHERE in a system.  As
soon after emergence as your sensors are functional, they are 
tracking EVERY warship/merchantship/ships\'s boat in the system.  So
much for smuggling by your PCs.  SO much for going ANYWHERE without 
virtually EVERYONE knowing where they are at all times.  SO much
for piracy...

180 degrees away from pluto in it\'s orbit.  Or 8,500,000,000 Km 
away from my entry point above the solar north pole at the same
distance from your sun as Pluto is from ours.  Or...
    In other words, this is a complete waste of time...

    As to your moon, doesn\'t matter, really.  I\'ll come in on the far
side at 0.95c.  I\'ll be in weapons range of the moon for less than
one-half second.  I\'ll be in weapons range of the planet for only 
a second and a half.  As I recall from MT, all weapons tasks are 
"Absolute", meaning that they take one turn (neither more, neither
less) to execute.  Since one turn is on the order of 20 minutes, I\'ll
have wrecked your planet LOOONG before they get a shot.

	window will by very limited.  Given that most fleets redeploy during

    Keep in mind that a fleet can wreck your planet with his meson

it.

You are making an even more assinine assumption now.  YOu assume
that if it works that way now, it\'ll still be that way in the future
after technology changes/improves.  This is falaacious, as all the

    0.005 degrees is 18 seconds of arc.  SInce an ICBM is about

    Why?  If I want to kill your world, why waste time wrecking a 
fleet?
    I spent five minutes figuring out how to kill a world (or a fleet)
in your "ideal" (REALLY LONG RANGE WEAPONS AND SENSORS world:
    Jump in at five light hours.  Begin gathering data about ship locations.
 Begin firing.  Note that any of your ships are detectable instantly by me.
 Note that it will be five hours before the main
body of your fleet can detect me.  And five more hours before
they can react to that detection (by getting a beam out to where
I am).  Note that I jump outsystem nine hours after arrival, which
is one hour before any response from your main body reaches
me.   Repeat as necessary.

   Good quote.  But you aren\'t trying to know your opponent.  You 
are just decreeing that your opponent do what you expect as 
stupidly as possible.
    Just think of me as your opponent, and try to figure out what *I*
would do to your defenses (which I will know all about by the time
I launch a rock (clue: or more than one rock).
    Btw, note something significant:  *I* never proposed a flying
mountain as the weapon.  *My* rock was smaller than most 
light cruisers.  And therefore MUCH cheaper than you think.  A
Tigress could deploy a dozen of mine without degrading it\'s jump
capability below J-3.  An SEH light cruiser could deploy them one
at a time at J-4.

    Also, why do you assume that rock can\'t maneuver?  And why assume it is
alone?  Assinine assumption, that.  You are assuming
your opponents are fools, and that is never safe...

    And as to insults to your intelligence:  if you don\'t say stupid
things, I won\'t call what you say stupid.  Please note that movement

    'body' => 'Just read an interesting article in Soldier of Fortune about a 
sound-based system for locating snipers.  The system uses four sound 
sensors in a array linked to a computer.  The sensors detect the sound of 
a shot, transmit the info to the computer, which uses the differential in 
times to generate a vector to the target.  One version of the system also 
links a camera on a fast response pointer to the computer, so a picture 
of the sniper can be automatically taken.  Plans are to eventually link a 
weapons system to the sensor for anti-sniper use.  These sytems are being 
field tested by both the American and British armies.  At present, the 
system is limited to locating supersonic projectiles (used by most sniper 
rifles) - work is continueing to adapt the system to trnassonic and 
subsonic rounds.

The application of this technology and the reason for military interest 
is obvious - with the rise in the use of military units as peacekeepers, 
the need to deal with lone gunmen increases.

Anyway, this sounds like just the sort of system troops would like to 
have - sort of like counter-battery radar on a small scale.  I think it 
would be standard equipment for tech 9+ units, especially those involved 
in dirty little wars.

The other thing that struck me about this is how it generates a role for 
laser rifles (which have no sound signature) - interesting how they 
appear at tech level 8 and 9.

Read it, as well as a rebuttal (which I don\'t think was in the same forum)
that called it so much bunkum, for several reasons:
     a) selective use of terminology. One could argue that modern military
         organizations -- which rely on high levels of individual training, 
         initiative, and specialized equipement -- represent a
         "warrior society/caste" far more so than do forces composed
         largely of civilian militias, such as in Chechinya, or Chiapas, or
         (raising flame-sheilds) the Viet Cong.

     b) such sweeping generalizations have a history of being self-
         congratulatory and premature.  Witness Francis Futuyama\'s
         "end of history." This self-servingness brings up:

     c) it sounds suspiciously like a trial-balloon rationale for raising
         and not cutting the military budget.  How do we counter these
          countless small warrior societies? By throwing more money at the 
          Pentagon and defense contractors!

How \'bout the whole mercenary subculture.  Traveller mercs are
respected professional fighters, not a scum-of-the-earth collection
that was either drummed out of or couldn\'t hack it in real
respectable militaries.

Or are you talking about a "from birth" Spartan-type military
culture, which act as a prime recruiting ground for the Imperial
military?  That, I can\'t recall any specific examples.

I can envision a tapped-out belt which had a lot of belters and their
families who had to go into new lines of work.  Being top-notch 
fighting crews might be one of them.

This is a can-o-worms statement, and I can even think of some things
to support it (and not the usual ones either), but by and large I think
this is off-base, at least in most of the US.

I take it this referrs to the Rebellion?  Otherwise, there is no
intra-Imperial
warfare between member systems/quasi-states -- that\'s the whole point
of the Imperium and Imperial forces will quash this pronto.

Depends on the situation. They don\'t neccessarily have to join a stand-up
fight with the top-notch troops.  There\'s always garrison duty, mopping up,
assorted grunge jobs to do to free the elite troopers for where they are 
needed most.

Locals can also resist occupation by acting as snipers, saboteurs, intel 
sources, thinking bad thoughts to give the Zho mindrippers headaches,
etc.

Think about this...

A CA jumps insystem 50,000 AUs out, and launches 200 "fighters" that have been
automated to fly into your home world.  They accelerate at 6g for a couple of
months at which point they mass as much as an asteroid (special relativity)
because of their high (.999c) velocity.  They are tiny, and stealthy, you\'ll
never see them until they\'re far in system and it\'s too late.  If they come from
several directions you\'re really strained.  

They would be easy to kill, just spread sand, or whatever in their paths, at .9c
a dust mote would be deadly, but you would have to *see* them.

Maybe to defeat relativistic KE attacks, a system would spread a uniform cloud
of particles in a sphere at some radius from the mainworld, at least this would
afford some protection.  Friendly ships would know where gaps in the shell were.

Attacking fleets would have to come in at low velocity relative to the shell.

I agree.  If you can have a perfect defense again these rocks (and perfect is
what you need, one .9999c 20 ton boat whacks you, and you loose) then fleets
are *easy* pickin\'s.

Hi all,

I just finished a novel which I thought other Traveller fans
may find enjoyable.

The book is 

The War Machine, Crisis of Empire III by
Roger MacBride Allen and David Drake

Now normally I\'m not a big fan of David Drake (apart from
the first Hammer\'s Slammers, I\'ve never thought he was very 
original or insightful. I bought this one used and didn\'t 
hae high expectations. I was impressed with it and read it 
quickly over two nights. 

The book covers several topics of interest to the TML. Discussions
of jump mechanics, insystem jumps, fleet combat, and ancient 
virus-like aliens are included in a standard space opera setting. 

I don\'t know if it is still in print. I read volume III without 
reading I or II and it wasn\'t diminished. 

The novel reminded me of The Mote in God\'s Eye (one of my all-time
favorites) but with more of a traveller feel. This was TNE at its
best. Several plot devices have long been staples in my campaign
(which I won\'t discuss here to prevent spoilers).

TTFN,

Glenn

	On the other hand, hitting a relativistic target with a meson
gun (which must be aimed at least as precisely as a jump) is
easy, right?  Spare me...

	You should learn how the universe works in Trav sometime.
I can load a Tigress up with 200,000T of drop tanks (in CT, only
125,000T in MT), jump four parsecs to a deep space point, then
jump two more parsecs on internal fuel, and still have two
parsecs of fuel left (in CT, only one parsec in MT).
	Not that this is relevant.  *I* wasn\'t planning on jumping
six parsecs to get behind you.  This distance from my world to
yours plus about 1000 light hours is more than sufficient.
	Ignoring deep-space refueling sites, which the prudent
commander has deployed all through space.
	And tankers, which I have more than enough of, being a
thoughtful sort of guy...
	You obviously think that you can prevent an enemy fleet from
infiltrating behind your "lines".  This once again shows that you
are not thinking Traveller.  There ARE NO LINES!  None!  Not
one!  Your Fleets can protect only the solar system they are in. 
If they can do that much.  They cannot protect/interdict the
space between starsystems, even if they want to.  They cannot
stop (or even slow) the passage through deep space of ANY force I
choose to take through it.

	Once again, you do not think.
	I just dragged out FF&S, and spent ten minutes designing an
X-laser weapon with a SHORT range of 27,000 light seconds.  It\'s
small enough to be carried on any warship worth building (say,
5000T plus).  So, it\'s not a big deal to come up with lasers
that\'ll do the job.
	FF&S rather arbitrarily limits meson weapon range so that
this is not possible.  But there is no theoretical reason why
a meson weapon cannot push the mesons up to any fraction of
c needed, including one high enough to produce decay at ranges
of 27,000 light seconds...
	Using missiles, of course, is a complete waste of time.  It 
voids the whole point of the attack I described, which you would
know if you actually understood what kind of attack I was 
hypothesizing...
	The point was that speed of light lag allows me to hammer you
with ZERO possibility of response for some finite amount of time,
determined by a combination of my weapon range, the distance
between my ships and yours, and acquisition time.  In order for
you to stop me, you must have ships deployed within ten light-
minutes of every point within several light DAYS of your main
world.  And each such group of ships must be larger than my
entire fleet...
	Good luck...;-)

>   or power projection with airpower over a foreign shore in

	Actually, no.  That is part of the problem that you don\'t
understand.  The neutrinos/light/gravity waves from my ships
won\'t even get to your ships until about the time the laser
beams arrive.  This is NOT possible in the real world.  In 
modern terms, detection is ALWAYS possible (at least
theoretically) before the attack actually begins.  In
the scenario I described, it is NEVER possible.  Even if you
have a picket line out near me, the message warning your guys
back home will only arrive with the laser beams that will 
wreck the guys back home...


>>>>>>	Now you have them deploying battle rider style.  That

	Well, no.  Remember the figures I proposed for deflecting an
incoming rock (multi terawatt weapons)?  That was for my LITTLE
rocks!  Not for a real flying mountain.

	Let me clue you in.  Your biggest weapon in CT draws about
250 gigawatts.  The drives pushing the battleship carrying that
weapon draw about 15,000 gigawatts.  In TNE, the energy 
produced by your drives is on the general order of 10,000,000
Terawatts.  MUCH easier to push something around that to blow
holes in it.
	And that weapon is STILL so massive that your weapons (short
of large nukes) will not deflect it.  Because the weapons in 
Trav are very low powered on a cosmic scale...

	Be sure that when you propose a poor idea that turns out to
be otherwise on closer examination, I will mention it.  I haven\'t
seen such an idea from you yet (though I am hopeful).
	As to tolerance and diplomacy (note the spelling, btw) being
marks of refinement - I guess I\'m not very refined then.  And
you have shown very little sense.  Does that make us even? ;-)
	Your original quote is irrelevant to the issue, though. 
Unless you use the assumption that when you choose to do
something stupid, I should quietly allow you to do so without
speaking up.  If that is what you want, then try this on for

	Exactly!  He understood for once!

	Basic concepts in Space War (Trav variation):

	1)  Strategic movement cannot be restricted in any way.

		a)  A ship travelling interstellar distances exists in
this universe only at the beginning and end of the voyage.  It
does not occupy the intervening points.
		b)  detectors (such as they are) operate at light-speed,
which is considerably slower than "the speed of Jump" (around
650 times c for a typical warship).
		c)  deep space points may be used as jump terminii.  See
Traveller Adventure, if you doubt me.

	This means that if I choose to go from Chronor to Regina,
then a picket line running through the Jewell subsector will
be as irrelevant as one running through the Solomani Rim.
	The "distance" involved is 16 parsecs, and using J-4 warships
plus prepositioned tankers (positioned in excess of 1 light year
from any star, and therefore indetectable for a minimum of one
year after their arrival). the trip can be made in four weeks
without once coming within 1 light year of any star.

	Thus, the "lines" aren\'t there, and the "front" is wherever I
happen to have ships.  Sort of like the dark ages, when the
ratio of space to force was so low that armies could only fight
each other by chance or mutual agreement.

	2)  Early warning is more or less irrelevant, depending on
geometry and TL.

		a)  The best scout ship that can be built has a Jump
capability defined by TL.
		b)  The warships I build are likewise jump-limited
by TL.
		c)  time spent in jump is more or less constant, 
irrelevant of technology.

	If you are the same TL I am, then my "fastest" warships are
every bit as fast as your "fastest" scouts.  This means that if I
send my Fleet out, your scouts will not arrive at your home
ahead of my fleets.
	BUT, if you are using J-6 scouts, and I am using J-4
warships, then your scouts will arrive first IF AND ONLY IF the
distance from my start to my target is NOT seven or eight
parsecs.  If it IS seven or eight parsecs, then my J-4 ships
will take two weeks to arrive, as will your J-6 couriers.
	Other numbers apply depending on the exact jump capabilities
of my fleet and yours, of course.
	Consider the implications of this.  It\'s important.

	3)  A fleet cannot defend any world of a system it is not in.

		a)  First warning of an attack on a system other than the
one your fleet is in will come no less than one week AFTER an
attack begins.
		b)  Minimum response time for fleet movements is one
week.

	Therefore, there is a minimum two week time period between
an attack and the arrival of reinforcements from another star
system.
	Given that attack is the stronger form of battle (as per
old Soviet Doctrine) because I can concentrate any force I
deem necessary at the point of attack, and you must defend
ALL points (since you won\'t know I am even moving until too
late (see #2 above), much less where I am moving to), I can
overwhelm any system that is not also a major fleet base (with
fleet present).  The presence of your fleet only one parsec away
is as irrelevant as if it were five parsecs away.  Or
non-existant.


	4)  Scouting will only serve to tell you where an enemy is, 
or where he is not, at any given moment.  It will not allow
you to tell where he is going when you see him.  Unlike the
modern world, where a sighting of an enemy force frequently
includes his direction of motion, direction is indeterminate
in a Jump-dominated movement system.  The only restrictions
on where I will jump are determined by the presence of
deep gravity wells near me (for instance, jumping from Earth\'s
100 diameter limit places almost half the sky off-limits due
to the Sun\'s 100 diameter limit (I\'d like to run a TCS game
including this, if I could figure out how to do it without
bogging things down too much).  But all the rest of the sky
is available to me.
	In fact, given my (personal) predilection toward deep-
space points, even that limit is pretty meaningless, unless
I am in a hurry to get somewhere and so am not willing to
take the extra week to decieve you...


	These (and other) considerations shape the very nature of 
combat in Trav.  In much the same way, radar\'s ability to "see"
things below the visual horizon shapes modern naval warfare.

	BTW, noticing as I did your Harpoon analogies, may I 
suggest something that might give you a vague feel for Trav
space combat (using Harpoon, with modifications)?
	Try this sometime:

		1)  Allow ALL units (ships, planes, missiles) to move as
if they were F-15s.  This simulates the big difference between
space ships and surface ships/planes/etc - that size is largely
irrelevant to maneuverability - a 6G Tigress is as fast as a 
6G fighter...
		2)  Allow the aggressor to place his units on the board
at any point he chooses, as long as the distance from your 
nearest unit is no less than 1 nm.
		Allow him to place any or all of his units on the map
in any turn(s) of his choice.
		3)  In the turn of placement, allow the aggressor first
shot with any guns (not missiles).
	
	This is not exactly Trav, but will give you a fair feel for
the DIFFERENCES between Trav and "modern" warfare....

positions of where they were five hours ago. Any shots fired will hit five

Message-ID: <950127155917_1209099@aol.com>

In xboat 164, Steve, replying to MSAMUELS@VAXC.STEVENS-TECH.EDU about ROCKS,
made a few points to which I\'d like to add my 2 penni\'th (ancient coinage
used by Solomani): (NB: I won\'t even approach comments from xboat 165 since
people seem to be getting quite unnecessarily hot under the collar - reminds
me of a certain "technocracy" debate not that long back).

Hmmm... not even my weighted dice could do this one. Sounds like the rules
need fixing rather than regarding them as \'law\'.

etc.

Most analyses of the SDB/GG situation seem to assume a GG at Jupiter and the
defended planet at Earth. Personally, having used both Scouts (CT Book 6)
and the World Builder\'s Handbook, a substantial number of my mainworlds
orbit GG, rather than being millions of miles from each other. In such
cases, SDBs in the GG make perfect sense... not that this precludes my
worlds from having substantial fleets elsewhere in the system, particularly
at orbital naval bases, etc. Although CT, etc. only mark Imperial Naval
bases (in the world UWP), most high tech worlds will have their own
facilities - possibly on a nearby moon, etc.
Such proximity (GG to planet) makes GG refuelling far more common as well -
I know my players physically recoil from the idea of *paying* for their
fuel! Given that on-world refuelling is severely limited due to Imperial
ecological considerations (in my game, at least, they don\'t want hundreds of
ships fusion-driving (or whatever) their way down to any old planetary sea
or lake just to pick up some cheap fuel, meanwhile burning up a few
near-extinct life-forms, etc.)

>You _are_ aware that planetoids move, right?  It\'sa usually called
>"orbit".  So they won\'t stay in the positions you put them in.
etc.

Well, there are certain points (can\'t recall, is it Trojan?) at which things
won\'t move much relative to your planet. Alternatively, if you\'ve put the
planetoid in space with a manouevre drive (as required to move it into the
way of the incoming projectile) then surely it can use said drive to
maintain position relative to the planet. Given a sufficient size spherical
distribution of these planetoids (either immobile or rotating like, say GPS
satellites), then you could take the warning time and the distance between
planetoids, calculate the maximum spacing for which a planetoid can be
propelled into the projectile\'s path, and hence how many planetoids you need
up there. They\'d be obvious to everyone because you\'d have to have them
beaconed etc to warn off commercial traffic, but such a protective sphere
*might* solve the problem (assuming the sphere starts far enough out from
the planet that impacting the projectile would cause both it and the
planetoid to bounce away from the planet (pool-ball-physics).

>they never actually calculated how long these trips actually take...

Let\'s face it, no rules system is ever perfect (except perhaps fantasy rules
where the gamesmaster can say "Because I say so, and because the Gods here
want it to work that way."

>Either way, your gas giant squadron has done nothing useful.

I guess it depends what you put in your GG squadron? CT seemed to be
exclusively few-hundred ton ships (hence SDBs were a formidable craft) until
Tril Cred Squad, et al. and MT\'s Fighting Ships. Perhaps it would be more
reasonable to picture a dreadnought using the GG as cover? Perhaps (as in my
worlds) the majority of ship battles are piracy, etc. involving smaller
commercial ships where a SDB (perhaps upgraded or upsized) can still act as
a good threat. My players are never going to own dreadnoughts so I don\'t
worry too greatly about such factors.

>You\'re still insisting that the rock can\'t hit the planet without
>extensive corrections, but that your rocks can hit my rock without
>extensive corrections.

That might be true if the projectile is at a fraction of c and coming in
from jump at several mill\' km out, whereas the spherical defence system I
mentioned earlier just has to .
Anyway, why worry about jumping and then readjusting? Why not stutterwarp
the projectile rock then you *can* make adjustments as you near the target
system, without dropping out of jump?

>WHich leaves them only 12,000,000,000 Km from my entry point
>180 degrees away from pluto in it\'s orbit.  Or 8,500,000,000 Km
etc.

Sensors would need to be closer than Pluto, etc. but if sensibly placed,
might have a goodly chance of detecting a huge body (such as the rock)
coming out of jump (assuming that exit from jump causes quite an energy
burst) - even if the rock has EMM, etc. to keep it \'invisible\' until it\'s
close to its target?

>As to your moon, doesn\'t matter, really.  I\'ll come in on the far
>side at 0.95c.  I\'ll be in weapons range of the moon for less than
>etc.

Just a personal preference but nothing in my games will ever get up to high
fractions of c (unless it\'s desperately needed by one of my game plots)
simply because of the problems of relativity. I don\'t want to have my
players start asking me about time dilation, etc.! If you want high c vels,
might I suggest stutterwarp again?

>    Okay, I\'ll bite.  How do you locate the weapon?  *MINE* is in deep
> space about two light years from any star.  Good luck...you\'ll need it.
etc.

Well, personally I\'d go for the \'crack the security\' approach, i.e. inside
man in intelligence or tracking supply ships out to whoever\'s servicing the
damned thing, etc. An asteroid among millions might be hard to find but you
might be able to detect jump exit points nearby, send in recon teams and
refine the position of the asteroid? Better still, infiltrate an engineer
into the team working on the rock\'s navigation computer - after all, it is
quite fine tuning needed to hit the target, so you make sure you include a
Pentium floating point processor unit in there somewhere [subtle \'softie\'
joke].

>Sounds like you trust your computers a lot.  I program them for

I have to agree (see Pentium joke above).

TO CONCLUDE
Some people want to have rocks.
Others think they\'re too dangerous.
Given my previous post on the relative monetary waste of a rock compared to
buying multi-purpose warships, etc. I would say if you want to use a rock,
so be it, but in my universe the Imperium (having not yet been through the
Rebellion) will stomp pretty heavily on anyone zapping an entire planet
(with a rock, nukes or a conventional invasion)... unless of course it was
an Imperial plan in the first place. :-) That doesn\'t mean that it *can\'t*
be done, just that if it *can* be then certain worlds will die within hours.
Advert: "Come to the tourist world of Baxili VII"
Onlooker: "Not bloody likely. I\'ve only just rolled up this character and
I\'m not going to loose him in five seconds flat just because the Fungerians
hate the Baxili and have got a rock ready out there somewhere."

Anyway, rocks are small fry in comparison to some of the Ancients weapons
I\'ve experienced! Anyone fancy a small section of the local sun being
\'jumped\' out INSTANTANEOUSLY (i.e. no week in hyperspace) and arriving in
the middle of your battle fleet?

Hope these ideas were thought provoking. If not, send a complaints postcard
to John-boy, c/o 10 Downing Street, England. :-)

Do they even need to know the holes? Most ships would have such a

unscathed.

FYI, the Chanur books by C.J.Cherryh detail near-c combat using
projectile-throwers, etc. and (although I believe I was told the books
weren\'t 99.99997% scientifically accurate - spot the Pentium bug) they could
give a good feel for such combat.

Ouch. Please guys!
Anyone ever been on a brain-storming course? i.e. throw in the ideas, no
matter how stupid they sound, don\'t worry about hacking them down until
later? People on this list really ought to allow that some people take this
brain-storming) approach while others expect 100% scientific fact. Make some
allowances, eh?
No one can possibly imagine the advances (technical, social, metaphysical,
etc.) possible by 5700AD, so I think it a little unfair for anyone to quote
*anything* as fact. We don\'t *really* know for *certain* that any of our
laws with regard to high-c velocities, etc. are accurate. Look at the
variety on our single planet then multiply that up to the size of the
Imperium. You\'ll get every possible version of every possible oddity anyone
could ever think of. So, rocks are possible but QUITE CLEARLY RARE otherwise
the omniscient GDW would have included them in the rules. <Cryten: exit lie
mode>.

e.g. it was mentioned that you can\'t put up a defensive barrier against
people in jump. WRONG! If you know their approximate route (in relation to
real space), just put a huge gravity field (say a high-v rock :-)) en route.
That should (according to standard Trav rules) force the ship out of jump
space. Okay, now that\'s a brain-storm, cos I\'m assuming you can map J to R
space and that you can put a sufficiently heavy body in the way and that you
don\'t disrupt every innocent merchant ship, etc. etc.

Yawn (exhaustion setting in). Enough for today.

    'body' => 'I\'m a bit tired of reading about big rocks, so I thought I\'d start a new 
thread about favorite memories of playing Traveller (if that includes 
hitting a planet with a big rock, well, so be it).

My own favorite memories have to do with the very first campaign of 
Traveller I played in, back in 1979.  I was a freshman in college, and 
I\'d been wargaming for about six or seven years.  I\'d done some 
roleplaying in high school with other wargamers (a rather common way to 
get into the hobby back then), but it was all D&D.  There were other 
rather primitive RPGs out there, but I didn\'t know about them until much 
later.  Anyway, my idea of what roleplaying was all about was shaped by 
D&D - distinct character classes (much more rigid than what AD&D has evolved
into today), rigid alignments (Good/Evil, Lawful/Chaotic), and characters 
who got harder to kill the more experienced they got.

That first Traveller campaign was based on Adventure 1: The Kinunir, and 
had a GM and two players (I was one of the players.  While it may not have 
been very roleplaying oriented by todays standards (all three of us were 
wargamers), I remember just how _different_ Traveller was.  While there 
were careers, just because you were in, say, the Scouts, didn\'t mean you 
had the same skills as another Scout, due to the random generation.  This 
was completely unlike D&D, where one fighter was pretty much like any 
other fighter.  We had great fun just sitting around rolling up 
characters.  It was almost a mini-game in itself, especially since you 
could _die_ during character generation (is that wacky or what?).  

Anyway, after spending an hour or two rolling up a character 
(unfortunatly, I can\'t for the life of me remember the character\'s name 
or career, though he was probably an Other - my favorite character class, 
the Traveller thief class), we went out looking for a job.  We were on 
Regina, so we got offered tthe two jobs in the book: check out the fuel 
tanks of Kinunir ships, which we turned down, and a hunting expedition to 
Kinorb to hunt Tree Krakens, which we accepted.  The book refers to the 
noble who set up the expedition as a fop, so he never got a name - he was 
just "the Fop," our very first patron.  We went to the planet, and since 
it turned out we were hunting illegally, Imperial Marines in Battle Dress 
arrested us.  Never saw the Fop again, but we never forgot him.  We got 
put in prison (an orbital Kinunir class stripped hull), and after a few 
weeks decided to break out.

That when we learned our second lesson about Traveller - combat was
_deadly_.  The original rules pretty much meant that if you fired first
and hit, the battle was over.  My buddy and I stabbed some guards with 
plastic knives, got their guns, and went on a rampage, killing until we 
got to a ship\'s boat and escaped to the planet.

There we learned the third great thing about Traveller - Situational Ethics!
Uninhibited by the alignment structure of D&D, we killed Farmer Brown, 
raped his wife, and stole his "ground car" (thats how we knew it was 
science fiction - he owned a ground car, not an automobile).  I remember 
that we did it not out of some evil motive, but just because we could.  
Freedom from Alignment felt so good!

Anyway, the campaign went on for some time.  We went back to the prison 
to measure the fuel tanks and rescue to the Noble Senator, we eventually 
found the Kinunir in the Shionthy asteroid belt, and then went on to play 
many of the early Adventures.  Still, it is those first few aventures I 
remeber with great fondness, for opening my eyes up to a whole new kind 
of roleplaying.  I\'ve played a lot of systems since then, but a still 
have a real affection for both D&D and Traveller, because of that early 
sense of wonder and possibility.

Anyway, hope some other folks have stories they\'d like to tell.  If there\'s 
enough interest, I\'ll tell you about my favorite adventure I ran as a 
Traveller tournament session.  All I\'ll say is that it invloved some 
short, furry creatures from a well-known science fiction movie, sandwich 
spread, and scotch tape.

    Quite so.  You can\'t predict the positions of ships that 
are trying to avoid being targetted that far ahead.  You can
only hit the ones that are hiding in static positions (trying
to use an asteroid as cover, for instance), or the ones who
are in (reasonably) predictable paths.
    What you CAN do is hit the orbital naval bases, including
ships docked/orbitting there.  Plus satellites, merchant
traffic, aircraft, surface ships, cities, etc.  Depends on the
weapons and the desires of the attacker and defender.
    Please note that that attack is impossible in "standard"
Trav - weapons and sensors will not reach that far.  It is
only possible if one changes rules to allow sensors/weapons
to reach out and touch someone far, far away...
    I was trying to point out that changing the rules to fix
one problem will probably introduce other problems, quite
possibly much worse ones.

    Several people have pointed out that you can\'t possibly
predict every implication of a game technology.  They\'re
right - you can\'t.  But if you don\'t give it a shot, then
sooner or later your players will present you with something
that you weren\'t prepared to deal with (like a rock).  Then
you can either roll with it (wrecking your carefully laid
adventure/campaign), or declare it impossible (which puts
you into that Fantasy game someone mentioned).
    Knowing at least some of the implications of a
"technology" will go a long way toward helping to predict
your players\' options.  Ignoring the question just means
surprise after surprise (or a Fantasy game - which is 
your privilege, if that\'s what you want to play...)



    And someone pointed out that this debate was of no
interest to him, and should therefore be stopped 
because it took away from issues of interest to him.

        I should like to point out that anything I say
on this list has NO BEARING whatsoever on what you
say.  You want to discuss merchant traffic patterns
while we discuss this?  Go ahead!  Noone will stop
you.  This discussion does not in any way limit
your ability to bring up another subject.  The TML
isn\'t going to discard your messages because too
much bandwidth is being used to talk about rocks.
So if you have something you want to talk about, 
then START TALKING!  Maybe it\'ll be interesting
enough for all of us to drop the rocks (no pun
intended) and digress away from your topic
awhile.

    But, frankly, if there is nothing on the TML
(XBoat, whatever) but talk of rocks, then perhaps
that is because noone else has anything they want
to say right now...

    Frankly, if no one gets excited enough to be "hot under
the collar", then the debate isn\'t worth doing.  Why bother
talking about it if we all agree?  Why bother making points
if you care so little for your points that you won\'t defend

vigorously defend bad ideas than to be apathetic, I always

poetic license...).  Better still to defend good ideas, of
course...;-)


> Most analyses of the SDB/GG situation seem to assume a GG
> at Jupiter and the defended planet at Earth.

    Quite so.  And I agree that a substantial number of main
worlds orbit GGs in Trav.  However, in that case, there is
no substantial difference between hiding in the GG or hiding
in the oceans (or underground bases, etc).
    The case I was concerned with was actually the question
of denying refueling to an enemy (the oft-stated reason for
GG squadrons).  In that particular problem, the main world
can only orbit ONE gas giant.  So if two GGs are in the
system, then one must be at some distance from the main
world.

    In order to "defend" that extra fuel source (note that
our solar system has four gas giants, plus Pluto as an
extra fuel source), one must deploy fleet units there.  If
one DOES deploy fleet units there, they are of no use in
helping to defend any body other than the GG they orbit.
    Thus, the question, "is there any point to defending
your gas giants?"  Keep in mind that the defending force
must be at least a significant fraction of the size of
the attacking force.  EACH (of the five in this solar system)
must be at least a significant fraction of the size of
the attacking force.  That translates to a horrendous
force multiplier for the attacker (unlike the traditional
case where the defense has the force multipliers on its
side)...

    If you are orbiting a gas giant, skimming for fuel almost
makes sense.  All the merchant characters I have ever seen (after
the first two months of playing Trav) try to avoid hazard to
their ships.  Like diving into a gas giant\'s atmosphere.
    If you are NOT orbiting a gas giant, then the transit time
from GG to wherever you WANT to go insystem makes GG refueling
one of the most cost-inneffective ways of running a merchant
ship/line ("penny-wise, pound foolish" comes to mind whenever I
think of GG refueling).

    On the other grasping member, the possibility comes to mind
that other entities may be aware of this, and may take advantage:

    If I put in a large space station in orbit around a gas giant,
and establish it as a duty-free port or some such, the merchants
can all bring their goods to my base, for transhipment down to
the main world or whatever.  They can then get free fuel, and I
can make a tidy commission transhipping your goods to wherever,
with much less risk than by buying my own ships...
    Intersting possibility.  I\'ll have to consider the costs
further somewhere down the line.

    Movement relative to the planet is not the issue - movement
relative to the incoming rock\'s path is the issue.

    Amazingly useful to my Dirty-tricks Dept, that.  That way,
if the M-drive is sabotaged (perhaps by setting off a small nuke
inside the M-drive?), then the rock begins a long fall down to
your planet.  Embarrassing. Especially since it distracts you
from other attacks that can conveniently be scheduled for that
same time...

    Good point.  Check the cost.  If the shield costs more than the
Fleet budget, you aren\'t going to have one.
    I don\'t know whether it would be cheap enough for the Fleet to
afford, but I do know that it\'ll be more expensive than the
incoming rock is.
    Note also that if these things were clearly marked (as they must
be), then the hypothetical enemy knows their number and position.
Knowing that allows him to design an attack that will saturate your
defenses (throw five rocks instead of one down the line.  Or ten.
Or more, if need be)

    But this ignores the question of why they are at the gas giant.
Sure, build your SDBs so they are the tonnage of the Tigress.  Make
them 1,000,000 times that big.  It won\'t matter how big and tough
they are if the battle is taking place 63 hours at max G away.
Because they won\'t be there till the battle is over.
    If you deploy them in your gas giants, then they take no part
in defending your main world.  If you deploy them near your main
world, they cannot stop someone from refueling at your gas giant
and going on to another world (to devastate it).
    Sure, your strategic aims may be achieved by convincing an
enemy to go nuke someone else (which means no GG squadrons), but
that won\'t endear you to your neighbors, and makes no sense at
all to the Imperium...

    The question has never been "what\'s in the squadron?", the
question has always been "where is the squadron?"  Some places
are helpless to assist in a defense (in orbit around Pluto
comes to mind as a perfect example of a useless place to put a
fleet intended to assist the defense of Terra).  A squadron
around Jupiter is another such place...

    Wonderful example of a "fantasy" game - you can\'t go that fast
because the GM is too lazy to figure out the implications, and so
he declares it impossible.  What if your players decide to go that
fast?  Do you tell them that their ship can\'t do that?  Or just
avoid the issue by using TNE?

    Which does what for you?  You can attack the rock, if you want
(starting a war).  Or you can ignore it.  If you ignore it, and
it jumps, what then?
    What about the second rock?  Or the suicidal Tigress?  Or even
the fighters on board the suicidal Tigress (which can only reach
50-odd% of c, but what the hey!)?
    Or the third through three hundredth rocks?



> TO CONCLUDE
> Some people want to have rocks.
> Others think they\'re too dangerous.
<plus your opinions>

IMHO,

    On the strategic value of big rocks:

    A rock is a wonderful device, in much the same fashion as an ICBM
is a wonderful device.  It is NOT a weapon, except in the loosest
possible sense of the word.  It will be used only by a homicidal
lunatic (or a species that REALLY, REALLY wants you all to be DEAD!
Not conquered, not subjects of THEIR Empire, but DEAD.  D-E-A-D, DEAD.
    Is their anyone out their like that?  Checking through my old
Trav stuff, I find the Brin.  TL10 primitives, kept in check by the
Imperial Navy occupation of their system.  But they want all of 
humanity to be corpses.  They would be a classic example of the kind
of guys who would throw rocks at literally everything within reach
as soon as the Impies leave.  Which they did in the first few days of
the Rebellion, if you believe in the Rebellion.
    Frankly, the Imperium should have dropped a rock on THEIR world
"accidently" quite some time back.:-)

    A thrown rock (or bunches of them) has one other use - to prevent
the conquest of my empire/world.  You start beating me badly, you lose
a world or ten.  Maybe you take the hint, maybe not.  I have more
rocks than you have nearby worlds.  Or, to use a French parallel, I
can kill more of your people than there ARE of my people, so I win a
moral victory anyway (this is the basis for size of the French nuclear
deterent, btw)...
    Which means that wars between empires/worlds can have only limited
objectives.  Sort of like the Frontier Wars, which should have involved
much larger border shifts than they actually did.  Note that Darrian
has never dismantled the Sword Worlds, though they could quite
easily, having TL13-16 equipment against the SW TL11-12...



> That doesn\'t mean that it *can\'t* be done, just that if it *can* be
> then certain worlds will die within hours.

    All too true.  And an admirable summation of "the problem".  Sure,
YOU won\'t use rocks.  Neither will I.  I promise.  Trust me.  But what
about him <looking significantly over at Sir James Bathory, Director
of Amondiage>?  Hmmm?  Maybe we should drop a rock on him before he
gets around to dropping one on us?  Maybe we should build a few
rock weapons, JUST IN CASE he does.  And as long as they\'re around,
there\'s the Brin.  And those mind-warping Zhos.  I never liked them
much.  And certainly wouldn\'t let my daughter marry one.  Or the
Darrians.  That Star-trigger is nasty.  Maybe a little "accident"
could remove that particular threat to my existance...:-);-)

    Exactly so.  Not that my Fleet would be deployed close enough
together for this to do much more than your conventional fleet 
could do in the same time.
    But the question is still there - how to protect worlds from
the excesses allowed by Trav technology?  Balance of Terror?  It
works only if everyone is sane (by the same definition of sanity
- I suspect that the Brin would not consider it insane to want 
to wipe out humanity.  On the contrary, I think they would consider
it insane to want to allow humans to live).

I can load a Tigress up with 200,000T of drop tanks (in CT, only

jump two more parsecs on internal fuel, and still have two

	You obviously think that you can prevent an enemy fleet from
infiltrating behind your "lines".  This once again shows that you
are not thinking Traveller.  There ARE NO LINES!  None!  Not
one!  Your Fleets can protect only the solar system they are in. 
If they can do that much.  They cannot protect/interdict the
space between starsystems, even if they want to.  They cannot
stop (or even slow) the passage through deep space of ANY force I
choose to take through it.

Once again, you do not think.
I just dragged out FF&S, and spent ten minutes designing an
X-laser weapon with a SHORT range of 27,000 light seconds.  It\'s
small enough to be carried on any warship worth building (say,
5000T plus).  So, it\'s not a big deal to come up with lasers
that\'ll do the job.

>>>>>	I don\'t own FF&S.  You assume I do.

	FF&S rather arbitrarily limits meson weapon range so that
this is not possible.  But there is no theoretical reason why
a meson weapon cannot push the mesons up to any fraction of
c needed, including one high enough to produce decay at ranges
of 27,000 light seconds...

>>>>>	That would be a function of tec level and could be worked into
	the game.  Just on "gut" MT instinct a 54AU meson shot would

	The point was that speed of light lag allows me to hammer you
with ZERO possibility of response for some finite amount of time,
determined by a combination of my weapon range, the distance
between my ships and yours, and acquisition time.  In order for
you to stop me, you must have ships deployed within ten light-
minutes of every point within several light DAYS of your main
world.  And each such group of ships must be larger than my
entire fleet...

>>>>>>	A fleet wouldn\'t try to block every entry point.  All weapons

	a crapy fuel status.

	Actually, no.  That is part of the problem that you don\'t
understand.  The neutrinos/light/gravity waves from my ships
won\'t even get to your ships until about the time the laser
beams arrive.  This is NOT possible in the real world.  In 
modern terms, detection is ALWAYS possible (at least
theoretically) before the attack actually begins.  In
the scenario I described, it is NEVER possible.  Even if you
have a picket line out near me, the message warning your guys
back home will only arrive with the laser beams that will 
wreck the guys back home...

	The proximity of mass distorts space (even jumpspace).

The "distance" involved is 16 parsecs, and using J-4 warships
plus prepositioned tankers (positioned in excess of 1 light year
from any star, and therefore indetectable for a minimum of one
year after their arrival). the trip can be made in four weeks

	Does you fleet wait out at 1ly waiting for tankers to leapfrog up

Thus, the "lines" aren\'t there, and the "front" is wherever I

	Any way you slice it, operations across interior lines is an advantage.
	Even in the travelleresque dark ages.

	If you are the same TL I am, then my "fastest" warships are

What about the time it takes to refuel from a "mainworld"?  If your Tigress
uses an ocean to refuel, it\'ll take a lot of fighter loads of fuel to fill \'er
up!  :)  GGs make sense assuming really large ships that can\'t land on a earth-
like planet.  Merchant ships are landing anyway, so it doesn\'t matter to them.

My concern (just so you all know :) is to make the universe "work", having
said that, I have the following comment:

Maybe battles are different in character than we had thought.  Since many 
factors were ignored (or not even thought of) by GDW, things like "rocks" can
really screw up the game universe. (though they are a reality, so we\'ll have
to learn to live with them :)    Perhaps battles are longer affairs than
represented by High Guard, TCS, or even BR.  These systems show us what happens
when two or more groups of ships get into weapons (or at least sensor) range.

What happens on the grander scale is for us to come up with.  An attacking fleet
jumps in-system, and looks around.  Their linked (why not?) passive sensors have
decent enough resolution to at least identify large vessels and planets with a 
couple hours observation.  They deploy to attack over a wide area, perhaps 
launching some KE weapons at stationary targets (planets, bases, etc).  Over the
course of hours and even days, the battle dances around----if you\'ve tried BR 
with no fuel limits, then this will be familiar (dodging missile spreads). From
time to time concentrations of ships engage and a HG/TCS/BR session would show
the outcome.  At least this kind of grand scale maneuvering makes the canon SDBs
and GG squadrons possible combatants due to longer engagements.

It would be interesting to know what the jump emergence signature looked like.
How bright?  What sensors would see it, and from how far?  (tangential, but I\'ve
been wondering :)

Just a thought...

I thought the British army already had such a system on their armoured
vehicles in Northern Ireland, to determine the direction of sniper fire?

Correct - the article was about a new system that was much more portable 
and reliable.  The British Army also used a radar-based system to do the 
same thing.  The British system I discussed in my post was in fact 
originally developed for use in Northern Ireland - with the peace there 
it\'s being tested in Bosnia by the British peacekeepers.

One disadvantage of the above system is that the bullet has to pass 
within 25 yards of the sensor - might make the troops a bit nervous.

By the way, I forgot to mention an American lab is developing a system 
based on a new technology (unspecified but the magazine speculates 
infrared sensors) to do the same thing.  This has the advantage that it 
deals with subsonic rounds, but the disad is that it covers only a 120 
degree arc (the British system covers 360), so you need more sensors.

Hmmmm, now I just need to design a gun that shoots air-conditioned rounds...

FAVOURITE MEMORIES
Mark Clark started us with his Kinunir adventure...

Yep, Kinunir was one of the first I played but the very first ones were with
the kids from the next year up back at secondary (US: high?) school. I was
about 11 and as naive as you can get. We played a group of mostly aliens and
discovered that there was this nasty group of people called RABID or
somesuch who followed a basic "Terrans are Best, Kill the Aliens" (this is
now resurrected as the "Terran League" in my games).
First fatal mistake I make is to have insufficient money left to buy a
watch. Two seconds after approaching a man offering to sell me a watch, I\'m
staring down the wrong end of a blaster (ala White Dwarf version). Now I
know these babies do 5d6 damage and I\'ve got nothing but air molecules
between its muzzle and my face, so I lose everything I started with... just
the first example of what a b*****d my first gamesmaster was - Nick Dahn, if
you\'re out there, I\'ve never forgiven you. We found an underground base next
- with robots in it. Robots with battledress armour and laser rifles. Back
then, that was an awesome combination, given that most of us had cloth and
few had afforded reflec (I didn\'t even know what it was!). Thank goodness we
had instant stim\' shots and med drugs, cos otherwise the casualties would
have been horrendous. So, we\'re in the main control room of this place now
and someone notices a label on a panel - words to the effect of "Property of
RABID". Funnily enough, despite having fought our way past 2-3 of these
killer robots, reading that sign sparked off more fear and panic in the
party (who were, admittedly, mostly aliens), than at any point in the
earlier game. We managed to swim out through some torpedo/submarine tubes
prior to the main RABID force catching up with us.

I\'ve been hooked ever since (although I\'m much, much nicer to my players...)

Yes, this occurs on quite a number of my worlds where for safety or
ecological reasons, the planet does not allow anything other than the
smallest shuttles or ships to land. If an orbital port is set up above the
planet and fuel from the GG (assuming the planet orbits one) is transported
to the port, it\'ll still cost the user. Alternatively, as you mentioned, a
port is set up closer to the GG and fuel is cheaper or ships can scoop it
for free (although even then there may be fees). The positioning of the
orbital port can have a lot to do with how xenophobic, etc. the locals are -
if they don\'t like/trust foreign contact then having the port as far away as
possible (e.g. close in to the GG) is a good possibility.

Probably more useful as a character-level (as opposed to intergovernmental
strife level) plot than the original rock-throwing idea?

Steve continues, down to:

I would never bother to deploy SDBs (or their equivalents) in any GG other
than the one used by major traffic attending the main system world. Other GG
don\'t need SDB to stop the enemy refuelling - simply put mines or homing
killer nuke missiles in there - they hide until war is declared (so
commercial ships can still refuel there if they so wish), then a remote
command activates the devices and they disperse into the upper atmosphere
(of the GG). Small mines could be very difficult to detect for a scooping
ship, while being sucked into the ship (even if it\'s only the outskirts)
means they can do a lot of damage. As Steve points out, there\'s no point in
wasting actual fighting ships at such GG. One SDB performing covert
surveillance (again more likely against pirates, etc.) is all I might have
out there.

"Lazy" is an assumption on your part. The truth is that I know I am not an
expert in such matters. If the situation arose, I have a number of text
books to which I can refer. However, such problems rarely occur in my games
because I have experienced (as a player) too many games where the referee
has come up with a \'clever\' plot device (e.g. high-vel rock-throwing) but
after a while other players start shooting down his ideas, at which point
the referee has to apply the same fudge factors and "because I say so" rules
that I so desperately try to avoid in my games. The same is true of the AD&D
games I run each week - I have to work damned hard with a mere 13 Gods in my
pantheon, just to make sure everything to do with religion, etc. is
consistent for the players!

Steve then comments about covert operations against his rock:
>    Which does what for you?  You can attack the rock, if you want
>(starting a war).  Or you can ignore it.  If you ignore it, and
>it jumps, what then?
Given what you commented previously about diverting defensive rocks into the
home planet, obviously I\'d plug my Pentium into your rock and tell it to aim
for the homeworld of whoever built the rock. I can\'t think of a more
appropriate/ironic solution.

Likewise your classic "But what about \'him\'?" example. Yes, I can well
imagine there *are* rocks out there, it\'s just no one\'s been pushed far
enough to use them. As an Imperial noble (due to my excessive dedication to
Scout Intelligence operations) I have played interplanetary politics and
there are an awful lot of threats, blackmail weapons, etc. that are created
but never get used. With regard to our \'Sir James\', we went for the \'kill
his economy\' approach rather than direct conflict. My Imperial bosses would
have cut off parts of my anatomy if I had openly used a rock or somesuch!

This probably applies to many terrorists today, but they don\'t (quite) rule
the world - I guess it\'s a combination of lack of time, money, equipment,
opportunity, and guts? Plus the determination of the law enforcement
agencies.

ANYONE WANT TO WRITE UP A SHORT GAME FOR AN IMPERIAL ENFORCEMENT BUREAU

I believe I said something about this before, but to sum up:

1)  The bigger the rock-
    a)  The more dangerous it is, but
    b)  The more EXPENSIVE it is both in RESOURCES and TIME to prepare.

    Throw away Power Plants, Jump Drives, (possibly) Maneuver Drives,
    Computers, Defenses for the incoming Rock itself (like Anti
    Missile systems), etc.  *Most* of these will be expensive and take
    time to produce in proportion to either the MASS or the VOLUME of
    the rock.  (Computers, obviously, are the exception).  And it
    depends on the system, too.  TNE uses Mass for some things and
    Volume for others, whereas CT seems to use Volume for everything.

2)  When you WANT something, you don\'t DESTROY it.  (Unless you\'re OJ
    Simpson.)  If I want to capture your HIGH TECH, HIGH POP,
    INDUSTRIAL planet, I\'m not going to drop rocks on it and turn it
    into a LOW TECH, LOW POP, NON-INDUSTRIAL planet that becomes
    nothing more than a further economic burden on my empire.

PLAYER INFORMATION

While refueling at a gas giant in a remote system, sensors indicate a very
faint incoming transmission.  At first it seems to be a random series of
numbers, but computer analysis indicates it is a data stream, compressed
using a method long out of date (from the Last Imperium if adventure is
set in the New Era universe).  Triangulation indicates the transmission is
just above the pressure horizon (max depth into the atmosphere) for the
ship and spacesuits the party is using.  The source also appears to be
slowly sinking - if the party decides to go down they will only have a
limited time to do so.  The exact time is up to the GM, but should be
short enough to prevent the players from going for help. 

If the players investigate, skill rolls for piloting and sensor ops are
appropriate.  The object will turn out to be a large (1000 ton
displacement) sphere with rather obvious dents and other damage, which
reveal that the sphere is very heavily armored.  Sensors indicate low
power.  If the players have a neural activity scanner, they will get no
readings.  There are no obvious markings.

REFEREE INFORMATION

-Classic Traveller or Megatraveller Version-
The object is a scientific probe used to explore the interior of gas 
giants, collecting data and taking samples.  It is designed to descend 
and ascend on a regular basis - apparently the scientific team that was 
collecting the data is no longer here for some reason (see below).  The 
probe will open for maintnence and sample retrieval if a code is 
transmitted - the players should be given some way of figuring this out 
(a small panel on the hull, an entry in a databank on their own ship, 
decoding the data transmission, etc.) 

1) The scientific team left because it thought the probe was destroyed - 
it was only damaged and took much longer to come to the surface.  If the 
players go on board, they may be able to fix the probe and download the 
data collected.  This will be a race against time, as the probe slowly 
sinks into the atmosphere.  If the players find the scientific 
organisation that placed the probe, they will be rewarded in some 
suitable way.

2) As 1 above, but the probe is damaged beyond repair.  The players may 
be able to salvage some of the sensor equipment.

3) As 1 above, but pirates are using the probe as bait - they will attack 
the players during the salvage operation.

4) As 1 above, but the probe has brought with it some Blobs (tm) from down 
below.  The blobs are unintelligent, fearless, and in pain - they attack the 
players, of course.  Adjust number and strength of Blobs (tm) to 
challenge players.

5) As 4 above, but these are Smart Blobs (tm).  In fact, it\'s a team of
Smart Blob (tm) scientists and explorers (Smart Blob (tm) player
characters, of course), and they and their friends down below captured the
probe and are now using it to explore the upper atmosphere.  They are
excited to meet these strange carbon-based life forms, and would like to
set up trade relations.  If they play their cards right, the players could
wind up rich and famous. 

6) As 5 above, but these are Evil Super-Smart Blobs (tm).  They want to 
take the players with them as samples, and will stop at nothing.  Good 
luck surviving high pressure.

-New Era Additions-

The above scenarios can be complicated by the presence of a Virus in 
the probe\'s computer.  The exact type is up to the GM, but a "Hobbyist" 
strain is most appropriate.  The hobbyist virus, if contacted, will be 
happy to talk about the gas giant and how fun it is going up and down 
in the atmosphere, and will even cooperate with the players if they help 
fix its broken systems.


Note: Blobs (tm) appear courtesy of GDW\'s Azhanti High Lightning game; Smart
Blobs (tm) and Evil Super-Smart Blobs (tm) appear courtesy of several twisted
campaigns run by yours truely.

Yes! I remember! I\'ve been trying to get that "sense of 
wonder" back ever since... Those days when we would throw a 
die and then wonder what it meant ! We used to run a 
semi-tournament Traveller Gumball Rally, with cars shooting 
off motorways into housing estates at 150+ mph. We\'d then 
climb out and go steal someone\'s Porsche at gun point; 
battledress among the milk bottles. Character mortality 
_was_ high; my first ever character died in mid-air, 
riddled with autocannon bullets after jumping the 
embankment, just before his car completely failed to 
penetrate a tree..

Both systems are derided as clunky now, but they have so 
many memories.

No.  No black hole.  The diamond/rock at 0.9c relative to the
planet has NO VELOCITY RELATIVE TO ITSELF.  Therefore, from it\'s own
point of reference, it has no additional mass.  It just strikes the
target planet AS IF IT DID, because it DOES from the point of
reference of the PLANET.

    'topic' => 'Jump drive variant',
    'body' => '
        Here\'s a thought or two ...

        1)  The jump drive \'100 diameter\' limit is supposed to  be  due
            to the gravity from large masses effecting the  ability  of
            the jump drive to form a jump field correctly.  But gravity
            will vary with planetary density.  And according  to  "From
            Port to Jump-point" (JTAS 22) this number  is  a  thumbnail
            rule anyway so what\'s the real rule?

        2)  In MT the  jump  task  is  \'Routine\'  outside  this  limit,
            \'Difficult\' between 10 and 100 diameters, and  \'Formidable\'
            within 10 diameters.  Each of these are a gap of 4  on  the
            dice roll, but apparently the effect is gradual  ("Starship
            Operator\'s Manual  Vol  1")  ...  so  does  that  mean  its
            \'Difficult+2\' at 50 diameters?

        I propose that the phrase \'100 diameter limit\' is merely a rule
        of thumb provided by ship\'s pursurs  to  their  passengers  and
        that seasoned space travellers have a more accurate value.

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        First some boring math  so  you  can  follow  my  reasoning  if
        interested (else skip to the next broken line):

        Using  the  formula  L = 64 * (M/G)^0.5  and  R = 8D  from  the
        original rule books I get L (in miles) = 4000 * (M/G)^0.5

        Not wanting to be  too  terra-centric  I  picked  Vland  as  my
        reference example.  (As an aside the specified mass  for  Vland
        given in "Aliens Vol 1: Vilani & Vargr" is incorrect - given  a
        diameter of 14,850km and a density of 1.02 the mass  should  be
        1.5661792.)

        So G at 100 diameters is 2.94185e-5 gees.  Remember  from  your
        high school physics that 1 gee is 9.80665 m/s/s and you get G =
        2.99985e-6 m/s/s.

        Now because the the chance of a world being exact like that  is
        small lets use some pseudo-science to pull a little  slight-of-
        hand.  The universally constant speed of light c = 2.99792458e8
        m/s and so G/c is 1.00064e-14 ... thats so close to 1e-14  that
        maybe it should be!  Now say that space stress is  measured  in
        units of S or in this case fS (f = \'femto\' = e-15).

        So the 10 fS (\'ten femto ess\')  limit  is  the  \'100  diameter\'
        limit for Vland.  Recalculating back gives 100.03215 diameters.
        Perfect!

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        So what was the point of all that (apart from  wearing  out  my
        calculator)?  Calculate the 10 fS boundary for  Terra  and  you
        get 93.155492 diameters ... 93 earth diameters not  100.  Okay,
        so now we\'ve dealt with the first point and added  some  colour
        to individual systems.

        Repeat this process for the \'10 diameter\' limit and we find its
        actually the 1000 fS boundary.  Hey, the numbers go up with the
        difficulty!  A geometric progression gives a step of  3.1622777
        or ...

        Stress Factor          Difficulty     Comment
        ----   ----   ----
              < 10 fS          Routine        The \'100 diameter\' limit
            10fS -      32fS   Routine +1
            32fS -     100fS   Routine +2
           100fS -     316fS   Routine +3
           316fS -   1,000fS   Difficult      The \'10 diameter\' limit
         1,000fS -   3,162fS   Difficult +1
         3,162fS -  10,000fS   Difficult +2
        10,000fS -  31,623fS   Difficult +3
        31,623fS - 100,000fS   Formidable     Real close!
        (and so on as required ...)


        You should be able to set this up in a spreadsheet  remembering
        that 1 fS = 2.93995e-6 gees and L (in miles) = 4000 * (M/G)^0.5

        And if your players are running for  the  \'100  diameter\'  jump
        point while being persued but for feel the need  to  go  early,
        just use G = M / (L/4000)^2, convert G to fS and look up on the
        above table to determine the actual difficulty at that point!

If you\'re curious why this difference comes up, here\'s why:  Start with a
rock and planet with zero velocity relative to each other.  Start to
accelerate the rock by feeding it energy (rocket, reactionless thruster,
impulse drive, whatever).  Using Newtonian physics, you\'ll eventually pump
enough energy into it to exceed the speed of light ( KE=1/2*mv^2 ).
Relativity says exceeding the speed of light is not possible, but the rock
still has to store all that extra energy - from its point of view it could
have just started moving.  So from the reference point of the planet, the
rock gains mass.  That lets the rock stay below the speed of light (from
the planet\'s point of view), while absorbing enough energy to exceed it.

Relativity really warps your view of the universe.  Who\'d\'ve thought mass,
length, and time aren\'t constant.  :-)

Just one thing, Newtonian physics doesn\'t work at higher velocities!
The formula given above is a good approximation of the correct formula
when we are talking about something that are moving very slowly,
lets say a car or a \'plane. As a matter of fact, if you take ALL the
available matter in the universe as energy to accelarate a tiny grain
of sand you would still need more energy to reach the speed of light!
(Even though 0.99999... C is pretty close.) Nothing can ever be
accelerated to the speed of light, that is impossible according to
the physicists today.

 We had a Swedish visitor over a few months ago and he described a system 
similar to this but on a different scale. All Swedes have to do time in the 
Army. The unit he trained with had a totally passive system for taking out 
mortars. The idea was similar. Spread out a number of microphones. When the 
mortor fires the time delay between when each receive the sound allow them to

triangulate on the source and take it out with their own fire (but it is a
real 
bitch to roll all that wire back up through the snow :-).
 [I tried pursuading him he should convince them to develop ballista for 
defence as well. They are (relatively) silent, leave no head signature, ...]
 So here is two examples of the same concept. How might it apply to Traveller

technology? Do mesons guns send out any sort of "shock wave" when they fire? 
When the blast of mesons tear through the planetary crust do they send off a 
wave a neutrios or something? If they did you could have a wide array of 
passive receivers (WIDE, since they travel at light speed) to time the burst,

triangulate and return fire (with Mesons, of course).
 Any other ideas?

Thank you, it was just a brainstorm one evening.  Your analogy to the 
boomers is true, I didn\'t think it up in those terms, but it is similar.
One difference is that the information on the rock\'s location must be really
well-kept, since any 57th century Greenpeacer has the capability with a 
jump capable jalopy of a ship to put a dent in this project, so to speak.

Brings up an interesting moral dilemma for the PC\'s if they do intercept
some time-critical information on this project - do they make a suicide 
jump into the path of what is clearly an illegal and immoral weapon; give 
the info to the Zho\'s or radicals or what?  

The plot lines I was thinking along were the intelligence and intrigue 
of leaking the existence of this to enemies of Imperium, so that they 
respect the so-called rules of war.  It\'s not something citizens of the
Imperium should find out about, so things would get hot really fast for 
the PC\'s.

I\'m usually not this evil-minded :)

  IMHO, Balance of Terror/Mutual Assured Destruction, etc, are always
lurking in technological warfare.  Putting on my IDP005 (Doomsday Rocks 
post) \'hat\' I\'d recommend giving the Brin or anyone else who got out of 
hand a little demonstration.  Note that it wouldn\'t have to be accurate, 
as a near-miss will clearly get the point across, if you\'re clever in 
it\'s presentation.

  In fact, the IDP005 project as I described it, might be very 
inaccurate, requiring many passes.  That\'s why there\'s more than one 
rock, so that they can either be delivered in a spread, or delivered 
alternating between rocks on a different approach vector (so that 
defenses aren\'t ready exactly one week after a \'swing & a miss\').

  IDP005 could be just as laborious as the Darrians StarTrigger, and 
just as prone to failure - but noone knows for sure...

-Classic Traveller-
The player group is hired by an ex-Imperial Navy Captain for an 
expedition.  He will tell the players that his father was an itinerant 
asteroid miner who was lost in a misjump when the Captain was young.  His 
father\'s ship was recently discovered, and the Captain has the records 
from the last jump.  His father and the crew came out in empty space, 
only to find a large asteroid-like body.  His father and several of the 
crew went to explore the asteroid, but never came back.  The one 
remaining crew member set the ship on course for the nearest system, but 
his low berth failed before the ship was found.  The Captain wants to 
travel to the asteroid and find out what happened to his father.

-MegaTraveller-
Set up will be much the same, but the father\'s ship was attacked when it 
returned to the system in the middle of a battle of the Rebellion, which 
killed the remaining crewmember (not the failure of the low berth).

-New Era_
The Classic Traveller set-up can be used in the Regency.  For the RC or a 
Pocket Empire, the Captain is looking for his grandfather rather than his 
father.

1) The situation is exactly as it seems.  The asteroid is plain rock.  
The Captain\'s father and his fellow crew were killed by faulty equipment.

2) As 1, but the asteroid has rich deposits of ore that can be worked.

3) As 1, but the Captain\'s father was abandoned on the asteroid on 
purpose by the crewmember.  The father left a message explaining what 
happened.

4) As 3, but the "Captain" is actually the crewmember who left the father 
for dead, and has returned out of guilt.  The players should be given a 
series of clues to this respect.  The asteroid contains nothing valuable.

5) As 4, but the crewmember has returned for valuables hidden on the 
asteroid.

6) The introduction is all a cover story.  The Captain is an active member
of a secret service appropriate to the setting and time of the campaign. 
The asteroid is a secret cache of fuel, parts and weapons maintained by an
enemy of the local political entity that the Captain learned about during
his service.  He plans to use the players to discover this and use the 
cover story to prevent the enemy from learning their codes have been 
compromised.

7) As 6, but the Captain has gone rogue and plans to kill the players and 
steal as much as he can from the facility for sale on the black market.

8) The Asteroid is a generation ship and the father is alive aboard.  He 
was abandoned by the crew member on the ship, who panicked when the father 
didn\'t return promptly.  The people on the asteroid are friendly and 
interrested in getting to civilization and in trade.

9) As 8, but the asteroid\'s inhabitants just want to be left alone.  They 
are not interested in trade, but they will return the Captain\'s father.

10) As 8, but the asteroid\'s inhabitants are violently xenophobic, and 
will fight to destroy the player\'s group.  They are technologically less 
sophisticated than players, however, so the Captain\'s father can be 
rescued if things are done right.

I\'ve always figured that using diameter for the limit rather than
graviational field gradient was like using volume rather than mass in
starship design: an approximation for playability.  My bafflegab explanation
for using volume for stars was that stellar fusion mucks up the "jumpspace
continuum".

There\'s nothing wrong with having a discontinuity in the difficulty scale,
though.  Think of the speed of sound.  Or possibly the discontinuity could be
in the consequences of misjump (much greater chance of being destroyed when
closer in)?

First of all, Derek didn\'t write that, I did.  Be careful with your
attributions.

Second, I used that formula to show why it *doesn\'t* work at relativistic
velocities (because it says you can reach the speed of light).  I didn\'t go
into the gory details of Lorentz transforms because that\'s irrelevent
within the scope of this dicussion.

Light goes at the speed of light.  No mass, but has energy.  No mass so
adding the tinest bit of energy to it accelerates it to the speed of light.
Weird stuff.

Oh, some of you may be interested to know that this is where tachyons
(no, Star Trek didn\'t make them up) come from.  While the formulae for
relativity prohibits a mass from equaling the speed of light (divide by
zero error), it doesn\'t prohibit things from going *faster* than the speed
of light.  So theoretical particles that go faster than light are called
tachyons.  Whether they exist or not is unknown, since going from STL
(slower than light) to FTL involves reaching the speed of light.

    Sure make a good plot for an adventure.  But only with a back-

will not be built - it is safer to put them in orbit, rather than
hovering above a planet (even high above it).  And the problem

    How much will this cost?  One of my players in my TCS game once
considered something like this, but decided that the cost would be
much higher than it was worth, especially since noone in the game
had used gas giant refueling to that point...

    If you wanted to, you could learn enough to get by in a few hours.
"Lazy" may not be the right word, but you obviously would rather not
make the effort.  Which is your privilege, of course.  But it\'s
still fantasy if you ignore the issue, just like it\'s fantasy when
I introduce a Deus ex machina to allow the PCs to solve a problem

    Which was my point in the first place.  However, you still seem to
disregard the possibility that your players may do something like
this without your input - what happens when THEY decide that they
want to move at relativistic speeds (as a group of my players once
did in order to completely bypass an adventure I had planned (I did
the rather stupid "your jump-drive broke down" hook, they did the
"make a transit to the nearest star at relativistic speeds on M-drive"
rather than trying to get the drive repaired locally))?

    Cute.  Of course my control system is not built especially for the
rock.  I just have whatever warship is convenient dock to the rock,
plug into the drive system on the rock, and jump using the ship\'s
computers...

    Quite so.  Of course, I used Sir James as my example because in
my game, he ordered the sterilization of an Imperial world (Cyril)
in response to a perceived Impy attack on the Islands.  Worked,
too...;-)
    He also had no economy that the Impies could attack (relatively
minute external trade, none at all with the Impies or anyone that
the Impies had any influence with)...

    Probably true.  But none of those terrorists have countries of their
own (and nukes/rocks/etc).  The Brin don\'t have any of these things,
either, but once the Impies are gone (early in 1117, I believe), they
will get them, unless they are sterilized first...

    Good idea.  Not that someone like the Brin would ever be
investigated by the Impy LEOs.  They are a problem for Imperial
Naval Intelligence...
    If you want the LEO types involved, then the "bad guys" should
be a semi-terrorist organization, like Sacnoth\'s Order of the Red
Eagle (which never did approve of the Impy conquest of Sacnoth
and dismemberment of the Sword Worlds (not to imply that they liked
Gram that much either...)).

    Sure.  It doesn\'t happen in Trav Land much for the same reasons
that nukes aren\'t used much in wars today - it\'s much too unstable
a situation to allow use of weapons that make things still more
unstable.
    Presumably, it has happened in the past, but a few examples
were enough to convince most everyone that it was a bad idea.

    The problem arises when you consider situations like the 
Zhos vs the Impies - neither side wants to destroy the other
("we\'re not _monsters_!"), but neither side wants to be conquered
("because they _are_ monsters!"), so if one of these wars gets
out of hand, expect it to be stopped by a rain of rocks...

    Cynthia and I nattered about this last night, and came to a
couple of surprising conclusions (one of which was that the 
Rebellion/Hard Times actually made far more sense than we first
thought).  It seemed to us that the Zhos must work real hard at
NOT winning the Frontier Wars too handily.  In order to keep the
Impies from using "extreme measures", they must plan their wars
to include at least one disastrously stupid idea to use if they
start winning big.  That way, they come out a little ahead (or
at least not behind) with minimal risk of losing half their
population to Impy retaliation.  If you have a multi-thousand
year strategy (which is not unreasonable, considering the age of
the Consulate), then you can plan on nickle-and-diming the Impies
to death over the next three thousand years.  Or maybe you can
just keep the Impies at bay until they implode...

    Too bad you couldn\'t get a convenient result that ran less than
"100 diameters", since thumbrules should err on the side of caution.
But since most worlds in Trav should work out less than Vland (it
being rather extreme as Trav worlds go), this should work out

    'body' => 'Alvin Plummer asked some interesting questions about the nobility and the
law.  I haven\'t looked up any answers in the canon, but here\'s what I\'ve
done.

When I was in law school, I tried to chart the total Imperial legal system,
including local courts, manorial courts, administrative bodies, legislative
bodies, Imperial courts, admiralty courts, etc.  The etc., I saw, was really
an ad infinitum, or even and ad nauseum.  I decided that I would deal with
the exact effects of the legal system on an ad hoc basis whenever they arose
in my games.  Even players who are rules lawyers have never, in my
experience, wanted to play lawyers (but I do have some NPC lawyers who can
greatly help or horribly bedevil the players) (sometimes the same one does
both).

In broad outline, I saw the overall judicial system being divided more or
less as follows:
"Local courts" These courts hear all actions subject to the laws of the
system in which they\'re located.  There is enormous variation in what these
courts are called and how they function, just as government type and style
vary widely throughout our cosmopolitan Imperium.

"Manorial courts"  These courts hear all actions on land directly under the
control of a noble -- for example, on a fief.  They are generally an adjunct
to the noble\'s household court (where court is used in its more than solely
judicial sense).

"Imperial courts"  These courts hear all actions arising under Imperial, as
opposed to local or feudal, law.  An action for failure to assist the holder
of an Imperial warrant, e.g., would be brought here.  These courts probably
also hear appeals from decisions of Imperial administrative bodies acting in
quasi-judicial capacities.  The judges are generally appointed by the
Emperor with the advise and consent of the local Imperial ability -- in
fact, it is unlikely that the Emperor does more than rubber-stamp the sector
duke\'s recommendations, because he has too many other things to occupy his
mind.  There are not many Imperial courts in my universe--one to sixteen
trial courts per sector, and one appellate court per sector (perhaps divided
into two divisions in more populous sectors).  Much Imperial law is handled
at the administrative level (starport safety, commercial matters,
health/quarantine regulation, etc.).  Imperial judges are rank nobles.

The nobility is subject to all law that attaches to any Imperial citizen,
according to the dictates of that law.  Thus, local law may specify that it
(ignore the "it") nobles are not subject to it.  This need not be expressed
in a statute, but can be a matter of custom.  Imperial law doesn\'t exempt
anybody, except of course for the Emperor and anyone he exempts (for
example, by Imperial warrant).  Manorial law governs everyone in the fief.

Jurisdictional questions I leave for another day (I have pages of charts
that I drew then, much of which I\'ll probably reject today).

So Imperial intelligentsia in my universe don\'t generally have to justify a
two-tiered legal system.  The legal system is only two-tiered to the extent
that (1) local law exempts nobles and (2) nobles can hire more and better
lawyers and/or pay more and better bribes.

    'body' => 'The first Traveller campaign that I ever ran was set in a subsector that I
rolled up myself.  The first adventure involved a psionic talisman, but, in
order to maintain suspense and not let the game devolve into technicalities,
it was always "the artifact."  The players -- a large and unruly group of
young men and women (ranging in age from about 17 to 21; I was 22 I think)
fascinated by this concept of "no alignment!" -- ran a bunch of middle-aged
ex-soldiers, scouts, merchants, and naval officers.  They were attending a
magic show at which real magic appeared to be occurring.  The magician
invited all ten of them backstage, and asked them to deliver a box to an
associate of his on a planet on the other side of the subsector.  

I had prepared a box, about 4cm on a side.  I had wrapped the box in brown
paper, which I had covered in small script that resembled Sanskrit, and tied
the box up in a waxy twine.  It was a big hit with the players, who got into
all sorts of altercations about which character should carry the box, ahow
it should be hidden, whether it contained anything illegal or dangerous,
etc.

The players wanted to buy stuff, but all that was available was a TL7
sporting goods store.  They bought everything -- faster than I could think
up prices:  camouflage hunting clothes.  Hunting rifles.  Pellet rifles.
Shotguns.  Knives.  Ammunition.  Backpacks.  Butterfly nets.  It was as if
they really were at Herman\'s or Copeland\'s with someone else\'s credit card.
Anyway, the store owner closed shop early and went to bed happy -- there was
no Terminator scene there.

At the Travellers\' Aid Society hostel, the true owner of the artifact tried
to take it back.  The owner was a pathetic, if extremely skilled and deadly,
reptile from the world to which they were to deliver it.  It slipped in
through the ventilation system at about the same time as two of the PCs were
trying to kill a third who had not told them where she was going and to whom
she was going to be speaking.  It moved about twice as fast as a human, and
was armed with very small shuriken edged with a soporific.  Someone fired a
laser at it and set a futon on fire, and it panicked and jumped through the
15th story window.  Everyone looked out to see what had happened to it, but
they didn\'t see any flat lizard on the ground because it had grabbed the
14th floor windowsill on the way down and vaulted into that room (it had
taken the precaution of renting the room below for just this contingency).
This scenario was inspired by the fight scene in the skyscraper between the
protagonist and his evil cousin in Lustbader\'s novel The Ninja.

What happened next?  Some of the players blamed others for letting them be
followed, and I think there was a firefight right in the big hostel room.
The police were afraid to break it up, and called in the local military.  It
got ugly, but it was fun.

There was definately a sense among the players and me that this system
allowed anything that we could imagine.  Our wills conflicted about what we
were imagining, but that was ok.  I would\'ve preferred that the players
pretend to be a team and not kill each other off, but then they preferred
not to go to jail or be attacked by paratroops armed with better weapons
than hunting rifles and shotguns (the laser was a mustering-out item, which
I took to mean that the character was stick-fingered in the military).

In the interest of diverting attention from the thoroughly
discussed "big rock" issue, I will contribute my write-up of
the Gileden system (Rhylanor subsector).  I have dropped a lot
of the minor details to honor the Gods of Bandwidth - they are left as an
"exersize for the student". :)

      Gileden  C-483103-7  (Gas giants, no belts)

Gileden is a quiet, backwater world, consisting of a small
village around the starport, and a scattering of migratory
prospectors.

The world orbits a gas giant, which in turn occupies the
innermost orbit of a small red star.  (Please insert exact
astronmical details to taste.)

Gileden is a very cold world.  It rarely gets above freezing
during the day, and the depth of night often result in "air
freezes", when the carbon dioxide precipitates out of the
atmosphere.

History

Gileden was uninhabited until just before the Third Frontier
War.  A group of settlers from Deneb sector started a colony
even as Zhodani fleets were crossing the frontier.

The settlers received little attention until the Navy decided
to establish a small resupply base in the system.  Naval
vessels found the colonists and their ship gone, and their base
camp deserted.  A brief inquiry ended in a "probable enemy
action" verdict, but this was later disproved by Zhodani
records.

The base was closed soon after the war, but was quickly
occupied by settlers.  The current inhabitants eke a small
living from the traffic along the Spinward Main, and some small
scale mining.

Starport

The starport and "capital" occupy the deserted naval
facilities.  These are prefab domes and modules connected
together.  Snow and ice are piled around and over them as
insulation.  There are also exterior parking and storgae areas
surrounded by ice walls.

The starport is well-equipped, with a shuttle and
some techs, but has very small capacity (100 tons).  Parts can
be backordered for months.  The Imperium maintains a small
office run by whichever Starport Authority official got the
short straw that year - Gileden is a prime punishment post in
the SPA. The overall feel is probably close to a small airfield
deep in the Yukon.

The town is obviously quite small. (According to the extended
UPP, there are fewer than 20 people on-planet - I chose to
interpret this as applying to the capital only)  There is a
bar & grill. (Called the Gileden\'s Island, to the disgust of
my players. ;) )  There is one combined general store/assay
office/broker/etc, plus a fusion heating plant & facilities,
and some residences.

Prospectors

What little industry there is on Gileden consists of
independent prospectors.  They roam the glaciers and hills in
tracked ATV\'s.  Their equipment is usually decrepit, and they
are often deeply in debt to the General Store.

The Rift

West of the starport is an enormous canyon known as the rift.
It is very deep (2-5km), with sheer walls and treacherous
edges.  It runs due Southwest in a more-or-less straight line
for some 500km.

The bottom is choked with snow, ice, and fallen rock.  The
walls are notable for the extensive deposits of a brittle,
glassy mineral.  To date, the "rift quartz" has found no useful
application.

The Ruins

The remains of the first colony are some distance to the west
of the starport, north of the rift.  They sit at the opening of
a canyon leading deeper into the mountains.  They consist of
some weathered prefab huts on crumbling concrete foundations.
A vehicle park, landing pad, and the stub of a comm/sensor
tower are also visible.  All are drifted with snow and debris.

***************************************************************
SPOILER WARNING: Referee Information

Ancients

Although the world is very dense for its size, it still has an
anomalously dense atmosphere.  This is beacuse it was the sight
of a minor base of the Ancients, who did some terraforming.  The
air is slowly leaking away, but will not be an issue in game
terms.  The base was destroyed by an orbital beam weapon, which
incidentally created the Rift.

First Colony

The demise of the First Colony is left to the referee.  I
decided that they had been engaged in a clandestine
terraforming project, using illegal nukes to raise the CO2
level and boost greenhouse effects.  Terrorists found out,
swiped the nukes, and disposed of the colonists.  Solving the
mystery of the disappearence made a tidy little adventure

***************************************************************
Anecdotes from my Campaign

My players arrived at the starport pumped full of legends about
the Lost Colony of Gileden, the Abyss Rift articles (from
Challenge) retrieved from Library Data, and too many episodes
of the _X-Files_.  They arrived late in the evening local time,
so of course all the port facilities were locked, and the
residents were in the bar drinking. The bar is in a separate
dome from the port itself.

The party immediately assumed that these colonists had been
taken by whoever got the Lost Colony.  They were preparing to
break down the door to the SPA offices when I dropped some
hints about the next dome. :)

They wound up riding with some hired prospectors out to the
ruins of the first colony.  It was a spooky ride, thanks to the
100 hour nights on tide-locked Gileden and the usual rumors (in
this case true) about the ruins being haunted.

I managed to scare their pants off (one player reported
nightmares the next day), and they managed to solve the mystery
of the ruins.

Seriously, the K\'kree probably wouldn\'t use rocks, or nukes, on an
unconvertible carnivore either, since they might get some use out of
the soon-to-be vacant planet, and it would really mess up the place\'s
ecosystem and the local politically-correct, if non-sentient,
vegetarians and autotrophs.  

Rocks before nukes, though.  If the locals were too tough, I 
doubt they\'d have any compunctions about using the things.  But
they\'d still need to land troops and search the place at some 
point, "just to be sure".  The K\'kree don\'t exactly have a great
reputation for good management of planetary ecosystems, either,
even though they don\'t let outsiders get too close a look at 
some of the worse blunders. 

I wonder what the tension level is like near the K\'kree trans-Rift
colonies...there\'re Vargr governments out there....

Yes, I know, but even with one, I disagree (especially if it\'s relativistic).
You won\'t know it\'s coming \'til it\'s too late to do anything about it (IMO).

Deadfall KE weapons *are* planetary bombardment weapons.  Even from orbit, a KE
weapon will have more energy than if it were an HE bomb (even a nuke if you give
it any velocity at all).  The only question is about their use to wreak worlds
completely.  BTW, there is an article in JTAS#22 regarding nukes in striker, and
it talks about antimatter bombs at TL15 (you get uncontrolled use a few TL 
before powerplants, I guess (makes sense)).  It is non-canon window-dressing, I
think, but it talks about a Mark x Contraterrene Bomb being able to turn a 
size x world to asteroids (so they have Marks 1-whatever).  It also talks about
the Impys blowing up GGs if they have to to slow an enemy advance... if this was
canon (is it?) then "fixing" the orck problem doesn\'t matter since the solution
is what several people have already suggested----massive retaliation (terrorists
are a different matter, but that\'s a good plot device, so who cares :)
 
But if the goal is to trash the target, the fleet is a waste of time :)

You most certainly may.  Could you send me the address of the page (if

        I know what you  mean,  but  seasoned  space  travellers  would
        _never_ rely on thumbrules anyway (there\'s too much at  stake).
        However, this small amount works out at another 297 miles which
        should be alright.  As you pointed out  most  worlds  (assuming
        density=1) will look something like this:

        Two reasons for removing the discontinuity  in  the  difficulty
        scale: Firstly the \'Starship Operator\'s Manual Vol 1 p.13\' says
        "Between 10 and 100 diameters, the effect gradually drops off."
        and where possible I don\'t want to  contradict  previous  work.
        Secondly, it makes it easier to tempt  players  into  taking  a
        risk.  ;->

        There are some other implications which  need  to  be  explored
        first, such as whether LaGrange points can be used  as  \'pirate
        jump points\'!  I am still researching this  and  hope  to  post
        something in the next few days.

  {
    'body' => 'This is further to my rambling about the place of nobles in the Imperial 
legal system.

Nobles are subject, in addition to Imperial law and such local and 
manorial laws as may apply, to a code of honor.  This is not strictly a 
code, as it is not written down.  More important, however, one cannot 
comport oneself as a noble merely by following some minimum standards of 
ethical conduct.  Nobles are obliged to act nobly.  

The code of honor is enforced probably in two ways.  Nobles who consider 
another noble to be without honor will stop treating that noble as such.  
For example, they may refuse to provide assistance to a peer or vassal, 
or they may refuse to abide by such protocols as would apply to relations 
between them.  For example, snubbing a ring that should normally be 
kissed sends a strong signal that the snubber considers the snubbee 
honorless.

The other enforcement is legal.  A noble may be formally stripped of his 
patents, privileges, and fiefs by an appropriate court, presided over by 
a higher ranking noble.  This would happen after conviction of certain 
serious felonies, of course (like treason, or even lese majeste), but it 
could also happen to a noble who had stopped acting noble, then stopped 
being treated like a noble, and who then demanded formal recognition of 
his nobility.  It\'s sort of like a declaratory judgment action:  
Plaintiff asks the court to decide his or her rights as against the rest 
of the nobility.  The court here wouldn\'t necessarily be a regular law 
court, but would probably be the household court of the noble\'s liege 
lord, or perhaps the next level up.  If the noble couldn\'t get a fair 
hearing there, however, he might be able to take his case to the regular 
Imperial courts.

The code of honor -- my comments to the contrary nothwithstanding -- 
probably can be summarized.  I see the following areas where nobles have 
obligations beyong those imposed by law:

Integrity:  E.g., a noble keeps his or her word, even to an enemy.
Compassion:  E.g., a noble takes care of his subjects and vassals.  
Another example would be that a noble treats prisoners properly.
Loyalty:  E.g., a noble comes to the aid of his or her liege lord when 
needed or summoned.  As a practical matter, this is governed by contract 
-- the oaths of fealty taken when the noble is created.  Loyalty to the 
Emperor supercedes all other allegiance.

No doubt this can be filled out further.

First of all, breaking an incoming rock into *smaller* pieces is the
*last* thing you want to do.

First of all, when I say "big rock" I\'m talking about the sort of
dinosuar-killer to planet-wrecker that has been discussed. And "big" is
in terms of impact energy, *not* size alone. So a big rock can be an
asteroid a few miles across at "normal" system speeds (10 or so km/sec)
or it can be a basball at a large fraction of c.

When a big rock hits, it blasts out a big crater, probably clear down to
the magama. And it throws stuff all over, creating some secondary
impacts, and throwing some stuff clear of the planet. There\'ll also be
quite a bit of quake activity, and an airborne shockwave.  And a firebal
bigger than the depth of most atmospheres, so it\'ll just sit there,
radiating all over the place (it can\'t rise!) "Thermal" radiation will go
clear into the *gamma* range.

The above holds true no matter where the rock hits on the planet. If it
hits on land, the fireball dissipates, the magma starts filling the
crater, and the scar radiates 90% of the enery back into space.

If it hits in an ocean, you get a huge tidal wave (it\'ll probably still
be of significant size even after going clear around an earth-like
world!).  Worse, when the water tries to return to the spot it was
*blasted* out of, it will hit the hot rock and turn into superheated
steam which will carry particulate matter (stirred up sediment, rock
flour from the crater bottom, sea salt) clear up into the stratosphere
and beyond. It\'ll take some time, but the ocean *will* recliam the
crater, unless it\'s all boiled away first.

So an ocean strke conveys just about 100% of the strike energy into the
ocean and atmosphere. This is going to do things to the weather that are
best not described. And all that dust in the upper atmosphere will do fun
things too. Like make it harder for the planet to radiate away the excess
energy.

BTW, this gives a way to have the "near miss" scenario one poster
mentioned. Aim the rock to look like it was intended to be an ocean
strike, but hit land instead. :-)

Now, let\'s look at the rock that got blasted to bits. All these pieces
are still aimed at the planet. The faster it is going the less chance
there is that they\'ll spread enough to miss the planet. Though low speed
cases can turn into an extended bombardment as the pieces that pass close
get their paths bent by the planet\'s gravity.

All these pieces have the same *total* impact energy as the original
rock. But in the "ideal" case where they are all small enough to burn up
before reaching the ground, you\'ve just transferred all that energy
*directly* to the atmosphere. The water vapor will show up quickly
enough as the increased temperatures increase the evaporation from the
oceans. And you get the mass of all that rock distibuted as fine dust in
the atmosphere. So the results will be almost as bad as a sea strike.

Oh yeah, with the near c rocks, unless they hit something massing a
sizable fraction of their own mass, the fact that they have vaporized
merely means that you\'ve changed the situation from getting hit by a
rock, to being exposed to the grand-daddy of all particle beams (all that
plasma will *still* be moving in much the same direction (subject to
corrections for the mass and velocity of whatever they hit). So the
plamsa cloud is going to *act* like a poorly focused particle beam! If it
hits the planet, the best  situation is a low velocity hit, which will
act much like the worst solar flare you can imagine. Average will be
almost as bad as the Maghizz(sp). Worst will be a cosmic ray shower that
will sterilize the planet.

So, breaking it up is not a viable solution. You have to nudge it into a
new orbit. *Without* breaking it up. I can just about guarantee that
even for a lowspeed rock there won\'t be time unless it is coming from
*way* out there. In which case the simplest fix is to attach your own
jump tug to it and jump it to a safe location.

This is probably cheaper too. I\'d not be surprised to find that  shortly
after jump drive was invented, someone realized that the easiest way to
deal with asteroids that were wandering too close was to have a robot
ship dock with them and then jump them elsewhere. The daring sorts might
just use a smaller drive and "misjump" the rock. (which gives us a
possible defense against an incoming rock if you can dock fast enough!)

Any spacefaring planet will have a "watch" for natural bodies that might
come too close, along for plans for dealing with the ones at "reasonable"
sizes and velocities. Luckily, telescopes *can* pick up natural bodies
*way* out in the system. So can active EM sensors (picture the Arecibo
dish being used as one of the *smaller* radar sites).  This won\'t help
much against deliberate missiles, as they can be stealthed.

It is possible to use passive sensors at interstellar ranges. But the
*time* required makes this useless for military purposes. But a scout can
merely take a few weeks to perform a star survey  from several *widely*
seperated points in a system (say by jumping to 4 or more equally spaced
points  5-10 light hours out). You sit there long enough to establish
your position to the desired degree of accuracy, then jump to the next
observation point. After you get the second set of plates, you can spend
the time during jump comparing plates to determine the parallax of the
nearer stars. You\'ll also find most of the bodies down to a mile or so
across *in* the system. (I ought to write this up in more detail as an
article on how Interstellar Surveying is done).

BTW, a ship coming out of jump is almost certainly detectable with
*current* technology. Depending on the size and range, it\'ll trip every
gravity wave detector on the planet! I\'m going to try seeing if someone
can give some reasonable estimates of how detectable at what range.

Someone was worried about trying to answer player questions about
relativistic velocities. First of all, there\'s a *simple* calculator
shortcut for calculating the tau factor.

If v is given in terms of c, (ie half the speed of light is .5) then:

    tau=arcsin(cos(v))

Or, on my TI calculator:
    type in V
    press 2nd
    press sin
    press cos
    read answer

Now, you are probably wondering what the tau factor *is*. It\'s the number
you need for figuring time dilation etc.

At a constant velocity, the timerate aboard ship is tau. That is, while
one week passed on the ground, tau weeks pass onboard the ship.

The *apparent* length of the ship in the direction of travel will be tau
times the actual length. The *apparent* mass of the ship will be the
actual mass *divided by tau.

I say "apparent" because these are what an outside observer will see,
while onboard the ship, they will see no change. And sorry, but the
apparent mass increase does *not* affect gravity according to the physics
types I\'ve talked to.

There are formulas for calculating elapsed time while at a constant
acceleration, but that book is in storage. :-(

For those planning to hide out in the Oort cloud/cometary halo and shoot
at folks, I\'d like to point out a few things. First of all, unless they
can accelerate all the way in, projectile weapons will take a *long* time
to make it to target. This could be embarassing if your bombardment
arrives after the cease-fire or the surrender!

Near c projectiles are workable, if a bit on the overkill side.

Oh yeah, there are *lots* of rocks, iceballs, even the occasional
*planet* floating around in interstellar space. Sure, the average density
is low. But the amount of space involved is *huge*.

As I understand the concept.

Measons are generated by matter/anti-matter anihalation.  The meason gun 
generates two particle beams (say electrons and positrons), collides them 
in such a way as to generate a meason beam with the correct relativistic 
velocity so as to delay meason decay, until the measons are inside the 
target.

That being the case there are two ways (that I can think of) you could 
detect a meason weapon
	1. As well as measons there would be a burst of gamma-rays and other 
	radiation/particles in addition to the measons.  These would be 
	easier to detect than the meason beam.

	2. In generating/accellerating the electron/positron streams, you 
	would generate a magnetic spike (cf. mass drivers).  This would also 
	be detectable.

	In fact, with good sensors, and data processing, it could be 
	possible to detect and identify the weapon in operation _before_ it 
	fires.  (After all meason spinal mounts are huge energy sinks.)

Howdy,
        I just dusted off my old FFW and we decided we\'d start a game up to
be played over the next few weeks.  I was reading the rules again, when I
remembered that all the BatRons for the Imperium (Zhos, too) were unstream-
lined.  But the old CT fighting ships shows all the BBs as having fuel 
scoops,
so what\'s the deal?

Has there ever been a net.fix of FFW to make it consistant with the rest of 
CT?
 ----

The reason that the majority of the Batrons in the Imperial and Zhodani 
service are unstreamlined is that they represent Battlerider Squadrons!
This is stated in either the FFW rulebook or one of JTAS 9-11.
The reason Battlerider Squadrons are unstreamlined is that the Battle 
carrier ( Fleet tender) has a dispersed structure configuration. ( check out 
the picture in either Library data A-M or N-Z ).

It is also stated somewhere ( I don\'t remember where) that after the losses 
suffered by Battlerider Squadrons unable to retreat from battle during the 
early stages of the 3rd and 4th Frontier wars the policy of the IN was to 
have Battleship Squadrons in border areas (such as the Spinward marches) and 
Battlerider Squadrons in reserve. Thus colonial units near the border tended 
to be allocated Battleships rather than Battleriders.
As CT fighting ships does not include any Battleriders the BB\'s that are 
included are in the partially streamlined Batrons in FFW.

Setting: Planet with Pop 8+, Gov 3+, Tech 9+

Player Information: Arriving on planet, the players find the local
government has instituted a unique form of currency: biomoney.  In order
to encourage spending and increase the velocity of money (the number of
times a unit of currency changes hands per unit of time), all currency is
alive.  To keep it alive, it must be kept next to the skin .  However, the
money gradually becomes allergic to the person who is carrying it, so it
must be spent within 7 days or it dies and is no longer legal tender. 

All transactions of 1000 credits or less must be paid for in biomoney, and
the first 1000 credits of all salaries and compensation is paid in
biomoney.  This means the players will have no choice about using biomoney
if they visit the planet (as a good GM will insure happens). 

What the currency looks and feels like is up to the GM, though it is
suggested that it should be rather disgusting (that encourages people
to spend it as quickly as possible). 

Complications: 
1) One of the characters turns out to be allergic to the
biomoney and becomes deathly ill with a nasty rash.  However, money kept
next to his skin does not die, even after seven days.  Complications 
include cruel fellow players, criminals who want to exploit the player to 
hide their money, the planet\'s currency police, etc. 

2) A local underground group contacts the players and asks them to take a
sample of the biomoney off-world for analysis.  They are convinced the
money is poisoning people, but the government is covering it up.  The
truth of the matter is up to the GM.


Note: This is really more of an encounter than a true adventure seed.  It 
was inspired by a description of a Traveller gaming session I read years 
ago, where one of the things the players encountered was, I swear, an 
alien animal that looked like an "inside-out rat."  My immediate thought 
was, "What if the players were forced to handle inside-out rats on a 
regular basis?"  I know, I\'m sick, but then again, most GMs are...

Asteroid bombardment is mentioned in at least one Traveller
adventure, _Secret of the Ancients_, as one of the many and
legion ways in which Yaskoydray killed his offspring and
their factions in the Ancient Final War.  (Among the others
were CBW, massive nuclear assault, nova-triggers (maybe a
big version of the Star Trigger), and planet-busters (one
mentioned in the text is the Niven planetbuster, basically
a three-portal circumvention teleport system with a grav 
plate, a mass to accelerate, and the system\'s velocity
regulator disabled.))

Admittedly, the asteroid bombardment could be several rocks,
but "what was attacked, was hit; what was hit, destroyed."
I get the impression that the Ancients didn\'t miss often.

The Niven planetbuster could be used in a way that would 
look a lot like the high fraction of light-speed rocks
mentioned, if the final teleport reciever couldn\'t be put
on the planet\'s surface.

Oh, and the TNE rulebook has a 300,000 year old impact 
crater with central spike on Kaggushus, which could also
be a meteor attack crater from the Ancients\' Final War,
judging by the dating.

I\'ve always had hot-shot navigators use the null space in a n-body 
solution for jump entry.  Took lots additional computer time, tho.  But 
it\'s a lot harder to arrive at a moving target like that when you don\'t 
know your exit time.  As for \'passing through\' the gravity wells, I 
treated J space as independent of the N space route -- only the entry 
and exit points mattered.

and generally make the ship look and smell like a pigpen.  Ship\'s with 
sub-standard life support systems, such as the standard type S Imperial 
scout, are even more prone to problems of bad smells and mold growth.

As an aside, one of the biggest problems is the ship\'s crew and passenger
complement.  Humans sweat, cough, and most notably, slowly shed their hair
and skin.  In a starship, as in dirtside dwellings, as much as 90% of dust
and grime is human hair and exfoliated human skin, which is a lovely food
source for microbes. 

The schloobie, a genetically engineered animal first produced in the 
Solomani sphere but now generally available in Imperial space, is one 
solution to this problem.  Looking rather like a furry rug, the schloobie 
has no bones - it moves by a rythmic motion of its hair.  It can flow 
into the smallest spaces, and eats a wide range of organic materials, 
including dead human skin, mold, and other organics.  It keeps ductwork 
and crew quarters clean, eliminating the need to dust most surfaces.

Schloobies mass roughly 2 kilos, and come in a wide variety of colors so 
that one can match them to a ship\'s decor.  They live from three to five 
years.  They do not reproduce - they are in effect manufactured by 
biotech companies.

A typical ship will carry one schloobie for every 10 persons on board - 
luxury liners often carry more to insure higher standards of cleanliness.

Shloobies can also be used as a substitute for showers or baths.  When 
rubbed over the body, they remove dead skin and dirt, though care must be 
taken to avoid removing hair, since a schloobie left on too long will 
digest it.  As a result, schloobies are common on desert worlds and other 
places where water is scarce.

Schloobies work best with Human or Vargr waste, since they are designed 
to digest organics based on Terran biology.  Vargr do not care for 
schloobies, however, since they often will eat a vargr\'s fur while he sleeps.

moles of diatomic atmosphere). Accelerating a rock to this energy would
take a one-million ton, TL15 power plant (250,000,000 megawatts) about
one year. So it should be doable with a little fore-thought.

Or you could find a rock that is moving with this energy already. At
typical interstellar velocities (30 km/s), a billion-ton rock would be
needed to reach this energy range. That would require a rather expensive
jump-drive to move.

The smaller, relativistic rock seems more probable.

I don\'t think this is right. The GAMMA factor is gamma^2 = 1 / (1-v^2) .
At a constant velocity, the time dialation is gamma. That is, while one
week passed on the ship, gamma weeks pass on the ground.

The gravitational binding energy of the Earth is over 10^32 J. It would
take the power plant I mentioned above about the age of the universe to
generate enough anti-matter to blow the Earth into asteroids. (That\'s
over a trillion tons of anti-matter, incidently.) Blowing up a gas giant
would be about a thousand times harder.

Seems unlikely (at least at TL15).

True.  Also, since the mesons won\'t *all* decay in the target (even assuming
that it hits) there will be gammas radiating from the path of the mesons in
all directions (preferencially in the direction of the beam).

Ships might also have sensor drones that simply have a meson communicator on
board...  it would prematurely decay mesons that went through it.  For dealing
with planetary defense MGs, you\'d spread these drones between the planet and
the obvious targets (the capital ships).  Assuming the detector could get an
energy spectrum on the pions, you\'d also get the depth of the site, assuming
you know what the target was (draw a line between drone and limb of world to
get a cone of space the target is in, then see what target is really there, 
then work backwards)

     Hmmm....this could be a problem.  Even adjusting for actual stellar
density, this leaves a stellar 
jump-point close to 200 diameters out.  Which, for this solar system, is well
beyond Mars.
     Not an overwhelming problem to be sure, but certainly not canonical.
 Not that under TNE
rules, this really slows down travel (perhaps a week worth of insystem
maneuvering at both ends
(NOT each end) instead of the six to twelve hours normal rules result in....

    'body' => '    This is a proposal for a TCS game, which I will referee given
that enough interest is shown.

    My purpose is twofold:
        1)  to learn something about the formation of interstellar
governments in a power vacuum,
        2)  to learn something about what works using FF&S technology.

    Hopefully, the players will have a chance to
        1)  learn something about what works using FF&S technology
        2)  have a good time pounding each other with advanced
technological weaponry...


    The game will require four or more players, each running an
"empire", plus any others that are interested in playing the parts
of admirals/generals/governors subordinate to the main players.
    Note that this game is primarily strategic and operational, NOT
tactical, despite what "TCS" may imply...

SETUP:

    The Imperial Era ended about 700 years before the present, with
the complete collapse of the human-dominated Third Imperium and 
surrounding interstellar states.
    You (the players) have just recovered Jump technology, placing
you in the forefront of the return to space.  You have no contact 
with anyone else at this point.  You have no clue whether there IS
anyone else left, in fact.  Think of yourselves as like the RC, but 
not as stupid...:-)

    There will be two types of initial position to choose from:

        1)  You start with one planet, population between one and
two billion, TL-10 with TL-11 J-drives.
                            or
        2)  You start with one country on a balkanized world,
population between 200 million and 300 million, TL-11 across the
board.

    I am willing to listen to other setup ideas anyone is
interested in playing, though handicaps will be put in place to
prevent any player from having an overwhelmingly superior start
position (assuming I can spot the advantage, anyway).  Note that
_absolute_maximum_starting_TL_ is 12.  Don\'t even bother asking
for higher...
    Those of you who choose to be on a balkanized world are the 
leading technological power on your world.  Note that secondary
powers on your world may begin space exploration/exploitation as
soon as you lead the way by launching a ship (that is, they start
building a ship on "turn 2").

    A little free information for the players, that your personas
in the game will not have:

        1)  there are three or more other players, which means 
three or more other interstellar states.
        2)  IMPORTANT:  There are also two spacefaring "NPC"
races - both unpleasant.
    One will do its best to conquer you if you contact them.  The
other will do its best to obliterate you.
    The first of the above will not have Jump until/unless they
can take it away from one of you (or another spacefaring NPC).
The second will have Jump, but will be restricted from leaving its
"home space" till they discover your presence...
        3)  all other NPCs will have minimal spacefaring capability
at the beginning of the game.  They will begin working on Jump at
the moment of contact by an interstellar power.


TECHNICAL DETAILS:

    This game will use FF&S design rules for equipment, with
modifications.  Interested parties will be informed of the mods
being used.  Economic rules will be based closely on WTH, ditto
the ground combat rules.
    Build rates will be straight out of TCS to start.

    Each player will be issued a listing of all stars within ten
parsecs of your homeworld.  Note that you will all be using a 
coordinate system based on your homeworld, so hex numbers will
not give any clues about the "big map".
    The "big map" will be used by me to track players and NPCs.
It will be a 30 parsec radius circle (well, hexagon, actually),
which covers pretty close to two sectors worth of space.  Note
that the "big map" will be centered either in the Spinward 
Marches or the Solomani Rim, for those who  like to amuse them-
selves by finding out where they are, and what lies beyond the
edge of the map...
    In addition, each player will be expected to either:
        1)  be a minor human race,
                            or
        2)  generate his/her/its own homesystem.

    Note that in the latter case, there will be no insystem 
development allowed until the game begins.
    Note that in EITHER case, you will be allowed to choose your
own government types and law levels.  The referee (me) will then
use your choices to harass you endlessly, no matter what they
are...;-)

    "Victory conditions" will be up to each player.  You tell me
what "victory conditions" you wish to work toward.  I will
determine final "victory" based on the extent to which each of
you achieved your "victory conditions", and the difficulty of
achieving those conditions.
    This way, you will not be locked into achieving any specific
conditions, whcih specific conditions may not fit with either
your personality or your strategy...

    In any case, starting fleets will consist of one (1) ship of
400T or less per player.  This will represent the first starship 
built by each player since the end of the Imperial Era.  Note that
cost of this ship is irrelevant, except for maintenance purposes.
    Starting armies will be based on Striker II guidelines, with
any player starting on a balkanized world considered "warlike",
and any other player considered "peaceful".  Starting armies will
be pretty generic, but you may tailor them to your tastes once 
the game begins...

    During the initial period of the game, each player will be
operating asynchronously.  That is, I will process each (one year)
turn as fast as it is sent to me.  As soon as you make contact
with another player (or an NPC), you will become synchronous with
that player/NPC and anyone HE/SHE/IT is in contact with.  This will
continue until all players are in contact.
    Any new players that are added will also operate asynchronously
until he/she/it is in contact with someone.  This includes players
who are knocked out of the game and who wish to return to the game
under a new guise.

    R&D will operate similarly to that in my previous game - you
describe to me the desired result of the program, and throw money
at it till I tell you that you have something.  Note that ANYTHING
described in FF&S can be researched in this game.  Further note
that everything that doesn\'t fit the "standard Trav" picture will
be MUCH harder to achieve (things like Stutterwarp, for instance).



    The game will begin as soon as four people have chosen to become
players.  I already have one (she won\'t be Sir Reginald this time,
though ;-) ).  At that point, I will begin accepting turns just as
fast as you can send them in....

Tukera Lines\' common stock fell 20 points (-16%) upon confirmation that its
newest luxury liners were to employ schloobies in all sectors.  The
schloobie, a 2-kg genetically engineered living dustmop designed
specifically to clean human waste materials from starship interiors, has
been standard equipment on Imperial Interstellar Scout Service vessels since
its invention in 1065.  It has never caught on in the private sector,
however, nor in the Navy, because most humans react to them with disgust.
As frequent traveller Enli Iddukagan noted in a recent column in this
periodical, "I don\'t know why, but they make me think of inside-out rats."

Admiral Frederick Santanocheev, interviewed for this article, harrumphed,
"We don\'t use shoobies or shlobbies or whatever the hell they are because we
have something much better -- deck swabs!  Young men and women who are
filled up with pride and patriotism and enlist in the Navy to serve the
Emperor and defend the realm, but who need some discipline!  So we teach
them to be able to do anything, anywhere, any time!  Then if it comes to a
fight, they\'re ready.  And you know what?  Our adversaries out here in the
Marches, the Zhodani, they don\'t use shoobboos either!  And that makes me
respect them, even though they disgust me!"

Tukera Lines spokesperson Daiqing Cziller defended her company\'s actions,
however, noting that significant savings would be realized "in the near
term.  After all, the semi-autonomous hair-mobile onboard biocleanser, or
shob, for short, is pre-trained, and replaces not only assistant Stewards
but many trainers.  We believe that the market will come to accept the Shob
within a short time, and that this action will prove beneficial to
stockholders and passengers alike."

Bookings on Tukera Lines and its subsidiaries from Credo Down Starport were
off 37% as of this date.

The Traveller News Service is an Imperium wide benefit of membership in the
Travellers\' Aid Society, which does not employ schloobies in any of its
accomodations.

        Ah ha, you spoted my deliberate mistake ... I got the  exponent
        wrong when converting from gees to m/s/s.  If G  is  2.94185e-5
        gees then this is  2.99985e-4  m/s/s.  Following  through  this
        means G/c = 1.00064e-12 or 1e-12 or 1 pS (p = \'pico\' = 1e-12).

        So the 1 pS (\'one pico ess\') limit is the \'100 diameter\'  limit
        for Vland.  And the 100 pS (\'one hundred pico ess\') limit is
        the \'10 diameter\' limit.  Thus ...

        More accurately the 1 pS boundary for our Sun is 492.148  solar
        diameters = 4.5775 AU.  To traval from the Earth at 1 AU to the

Great post, Glenn - ROTFL, though you have to feel sorry for the poor 
biomoney.  

"We are highly offended that anyone would compare our currency 
to a shloobie - the new Cundarian Thaler does not smell anywhere near as 
badly as a shloobie, and rumors that it removes hair are greatly 
exagerated," Minister Friedman said this morning.  When asked why he was 
wearing a hat indoors, the Minister\'s only words were "No comment" before 
he abruptly ended the press conference.

In other news, after years of study, the Kree - known colloquially as the 
Centaurs and known until recently as the K\'Kree - have conquered their 
stuttering problem.  Rumors that this is just another Hiver manpulation 
intended to put the surly Centaurs off their feed have been quashed by 
declassified government documents.  Apparently the trick is simply to 
take a moment to chew your cud and relax before you start speaking.

The bombardment actually cracked the crust, and created high tablelands out
of magma pushed up by the asteroid hits.  (p.18) (sorry, the earlier

The map on pp. 16-17 shows big round seas that were probably the result of
asteroid impacts.

Some better Bible scholars than I can provide chapter and verse, but I
recall plagues of stones and stars falling from the sky in the book of
Revelations.  Was this a warning about the dangers of asteroid missiles?

\'Memories of Traveller\' - now all we need is a President\'s Choice
product to go with it. (TNE would be line a certain margerine product
 - \'I can\'t believe it\'s not T:2000!\')

Anyways, I played Traveller on and off for a while after I got it,
but it wasn\'t until I was playing \'Expedition to Zhodane\' that I noticed
something odd. One guy kept saying how altruistic the plot structure of the 
adventure is - pcs, shanghied to an asteroid belt to mine, find a drifiting
ship and what do they do? Run with it? Nope, they help the helpless little
girl they find inside. Sniff, sniff. He wanted to take off with it to the
nearest pleasure planet. The adventure synopsis didn\'t cover that though.

Then I read a quote on this list (I think) from Marc Miller or someone
else instrumental to the development of Traveller. They said that Traveller
and Star Wars were always intertwined in their mind. I thought \'but 
Traveller is nothing like Star Wars\'. BUT - I was only looking at the
surface.

Although it is never stated outright, Traveller has a specific moral
tone to most of its adventures. (CT that is). Research Station Gamma,
Signal GK, Expedition to Zhodane, I could name more I\'m sure. They all
rely on the fact that the characters have to be curious, unfazed by
danger and bucking the system and altruistic. How odd. Although there
isn\'t an alignment system, characters are expected to have a certain 
moral outlook.

Anyways, Traveller rocks and shocks because it has a cool universe 
overflowing with possibilities and some very creative people put a lot
of work into it.

Hmmm...perceptions differ.  From my point of view, it always seemed that the
Traveller adventures required players to be amoral thugs who were open to
any proposition.  Look at the 76 Patrons supplement sometime, and count
how many of the adventure seeds require the players to sign up to something
which is obviously shady, if not outright illegal.  (About half--it\'s
been a while since I counted them.)  And then there\'s always Adventure 8:
Prison Planet, for when the characters eventually get their just desserts...

 I\'ve always assumed that calculating jumpspace parameters is *fiendishly* 
difficult. That\'s why we haven\'t discovereed it yet :-). The Einstein who 
discovered this had no life and couldn\'t make her own tea. Jump theory allows

from jumps between almost any two points taking almost any amount of time. 
However if you go for extremes it requires extremes. E.g. if you want to jump

from Vland to Terra in 3 minutes you need a ship the size of a point, an 
infinate amount of tensile strength and half the lifetime of the universe to 
calculate it.
 So, instead, what is commonly used is a set of approximation equations 
(devised by some laid back Scout how was upset about flunking Jump Physics). 
They are easier to solve, more forgiving of errors but the payoff is in
certain 
restrictions (100 diameter limit) and randomness (6-8 days). Although
inexact, 
they seldom lead to mis-jumps and are good enough to support comerce.
 The 100 diameter is, so, a "rule of thumb". You can jump in less but the 
possibility of a "misjump" is greater. Note: a "misjump" is just a jump where

the factors from the n-millionth iteration of the real JumpSpace equations
take 
precedence. If you haven\'t calculated them it appears random.

 I find this interpretation conveinent as it allows the referee to
occasionally 
bend the rules. Once the players were shanghied by the military to run a
smoke 
cover mission. Once they got their scout-ship (of which the parameters were 
generally well known) the military linked the computers of three cruisers 
together for about 7 days (3 before they jumped in, 4 more to refine once the

*exact* parameters were known) to calc a course for them.
 This sent them on a hard-wired course through three systems. The first jump 
was from a normal distance, this brought them in at 47 diameters. A quick 
slingshot around a gas-giant and out again at *11* diameters, and finally
into 
the target system at 27 diameters heading, at high velocity, for the enemy
base 
(abandon ship!).
 What fun!

Look in MT Referee\'s Handbook, in the design sequence section right after
the space weapons, and it will give you the numbers for missile storage.
Off the top of my head, I think that it was 100 liters and 50 kgs per 
missile.

First of all, in the MT Referee\'s Manual, there is a table for missile 
magazines which indicates that a volume of 0.1 kl is needed to store a 
missile.  

Secondly, in Special Supplement 3 "Missiles in Traveller" published in 
JTAS #21, "standard" missiles must be able to fit into a "standardised 
shipping/launching container".  The interior dimensions of this containor 
as given as 1 metre long and 15 cm in diameter, and the mass of the 
missile is given as 50 kg (which I think is born out by the MT magazine 
table).  The dimensions give a volume of 0.017 kl, and I suppose that the 
remaining space in the magazine is due to the exterior dimensions of the 
container, and compartmentalisation for safety.  SS3 also states that a 
standard missile turret include storage for 4 missiles per launcher.

There is an illustration of a missile which I take to be a "standard" 
type in an advert for a DGP "Behind the Claw" source book which never saw 
the light of day.  It had extendable attitude jets and an antenna.

In my game, I\'ve bumped up the volume of the missile a bit.  The 
container is 1 m long, and has a square cross-section with 30 cm sides.  
The missile itself fits inside this, and has a total volume of 0.05 kl (a 
cylinder 95 cm long and 26 cm in radius)  The missile mass is 50 kg, and 
the whole assembly masses 52 kg; nuclear missiles are a bit heavier.  
These volumes and masses come from attempting to reconcile SS3, MT 
magazine volumes, and the MT/COACC design sequences as adapted to a TL 13 
fusion rocket missile.

Of course, in t\'tne, I seem to remember missiles are "7 tons", either 
mass, or displacement (94.5 kl)!

The special suplement in Journal TAS #21, gives the internal dimentions 
of the standard missile container as,
	15cm diameter
	1m  long
It contains any missile of 50kg or less.

Larger missiles (which do exist) have to be handled by missile bay 
weapons mounts.

Tau=1/gamma.  So we are both right. Tau is more useful for some things,
and is much easier to use with the caluculator dodge.

    tau^2 = 1-v^2
or
    tau^2+v^2=1

The later formula explains *why* the trig function shortcut works.

 In my game a ship can make arangements ahead of time. If one
is planning a long trip and can send messages ahead (XBoats travel
at jump-4) various fuel agencies will meet you at the 100 diameter mark
with enough fuel to top you up. Thus you can have an immediate
turnaround. Some charge outrageously, other don\'t charge any more,
just bank on the extra business.
 Some "express" liners do the same, meeting a fuel shuttle and
a passenger shuttle. Local travel agents book the passages. You 
have to be keeping a regular route, though.

standard CT capabilities, but SS3 in JTAS #21 gave the standard missile 
as 6G6, that is it could maintain upto 6 G acceleration, and do so for 
one turn (or 3 G for 2 turns, etc.) There were rules for designing 
missiles with different ratings, eg 6G18, 2G40, etc.

When I designed my Fusion rocket missile, the rating turned out to be 
10G100, ie. upto 10 G of acceleration for up to 10,000 seconds.  This 
allows my missiles to attack anything within 50,000 km in one turn, and 
have a total range (accelerating throughout) of 5,000,000 km (I think), 
although maintaining contact over that range is nigh-on impossible.  The 
Tl 7-12 missiles had the same acceleration, but were typically 10G3 to 
10G5, giving a range of 4,500 km to 12,500 km.  Of course, there is 
nothing to stop a character sending a missile out at a lower 
acceleration; even 4 G is plenty against any non-military target.

which is making the rounds at some of the arty theaters
around the US.

Very briefly, it is a full-length animated film about a Tech-6
planet\'s first manned spaceflight, centering on the
astronaut-to-be.  A short description fails to do it justice,
but suffice to say it comes _HIGHLY_ recommended!

        GDW\'s _behavior_ to date, with respect to this list, has
        said nothing, even with the number of postings of ships,
        weapons, casual encounters, alternate histories, pocket
        empire scenaria, RICE Papers, et alia, that have passed
        through these lists and their predecessors at engrg.uwo.ca.
        One could be led into thinking that GDW follows the FASA
        philosophy on this issue - but it could be a disappointing
        error to do so.

        We readers of the list are not the only ones who must be
        careful.  Rob Miracle, MPGN\'s administrator (or one of
        them) has refrained from copying over the Sunbane archives,
        or from creating a new archive at MPGN because of
        uncertainty with regards to GDW\'s policy.  I have written
        (and collected from other posters) material which would
        certainly belong in such an archive, and as I recall, some
        samples are in GDW\'s hands.  We are still awaiting a
        statement from GDW as to whether this material can be
        placed in a publically-available archive.

        I am therefore asking publically, as I said above, for some
        sort of policy/attitude statement from GDW on this
        important issue.  I eagerly await such a reply.

Yes, the wording is dense, and yes, some of the provisions are
one-sided.  But in my estimation, it is a license that most
creators can live with (I am not a lawyer, by the way).  FWIW, I
understand that this was worked out _before_ the TSR brouhaha, but
I could be wrong on it.  Certainly, I requested it before FASA and
Chaosium published their policies.

GDW will no doubt remember the flap caused by Kevin Siembada/
Palladium a while back, which ended up with almost nobody writing
_anything_ about any Palladium product since, and which almost
killed Wizards of the Coast.  I fear that TSR is going to go down
that path, in the name of trying to maintain total control over
that which is by its nature is not amenable to such control.

Obviously, I would prefer that GDW follow the route of FASA and
Chaosium, rather than that of Palladium and TSR.  I would consider
the Steve Jackson Games route to be more acceptable than the TSR
route, but less desirable than the FASA route.

Therefore, I am asking publically:

        What are GDW\'s intentions on this issue?  The previous
        "policy statement" does not make it clear, and the
        situation has changed somewhat since its formulation.

        I am not asking GDW to consult with high-priced lawyers to
        come up with a bulletproof cast-in-stone policy; I am
        asking for a statement of general attitude on the part of
        GDW, so that those of us who _do_ create can know just how
        far we can go, and how far we cannot go.

As most of the participants on this list know, several months ago,
TSR, Inc., started an effort to restrict the availability of
material for their product lines that was not created and/or
authorized by them.  Several FTP sites have been intimidated into
shutting down, or removing all TSR product line-related materials.
They (TSR) _have_ authorized a single site (ftp.mpgn.com) to carry
such material, but they have required a disclaimer to be attached,
the wording of which appears to require that the authors waive some
(most) control of distribution of the material.

Jim Vassilakos, a participant on the original Traveller Mailing
List (from the engrg.uwo.ca days, and before the XTML inception)
recently wrote to some other companies to find out their policies
on this issue.  He posted to the net the most recent dialog from
that effort.  It is reproduced (minus Usenet headers) below, quoted
with ">> " prepended.  Text without such prepended indicators is
mine:

>> Hello, everybody. For those of you who have followed the discussions
>> concerning TSR\'s policy toward the net, here\'s another tidbit for
>> your archives. I recently wrote Chaosium asking them what their
>> policy was. Here\'s my letter and their reply:
>>    jimv@cs.ucr.edu
>>
>> ======================================================================
>>
>> From: james vassilakos <jimv>
>> Subject: policy on fan-authored, internet-distributed material
>> To: Chaosium@aol.com
>> Date: Sat, 28 Jan 1995 12:14:40 -0800 (PST)
>>
>> I\'m writing with respect to the TSR/Copyright debate which has been
>> brewing on the Internet over the past several months. Basically,
>> TSR issued a statement saying that all fan-authored material which
>> relates to AD&D (i.e. fan-written modules, monsters, rules, spells,
>> etc) may not be archived on any ftp site other than MPG-Net, and that
>> futhermore the following statement must be attached by the author to
>> the document in question:
>>
>> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
>> This item incorporates or is based on or derived from copyrighted
>> material of TSR, Inc. and may contain trademarks of TSR.  The item is
>> made available by MPG-Net under license from TSR, but is not authorized
>> or endorsed by TSR.  The item is for personal use only and may not be
>> published or distributed except through MPG-Net or TSR.
>> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
>>
>> People on the net are primarily concerned about the last line, where
>> we waive distribution rights to our own work. Since this situation has
>> persisted for several months despite some research netters have done
>> suggesting that TSR\'s position is not legally defensible, some people
>> have been dropping AD&D and moving over to other game systems. I\'m
>> currently compiling a summary of the internet articles pertaining
>> to this situation, and I\'d like to include your company\'s position
>> for the record. As an example, FASA responded with their own statement
>> which they asked to be attached to Shadowrun-related, fan-authored
>> material (notice that they make no reference to distribution rights,
>> much to the relief on many netters):
>>
>> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
>> Shadowrun is a Registered Trademark of FASA Corporation. Original
>> Shadowrun material Copyright 1994 by FASA Corporation. All Rights
>> Reserved. Used without permission. Any use of FASA Corporation\'s
>> copyrighted material or trademarks in this file should not be viewed
>> as a challenge to those copyrights or trademarks.
>> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
>>
>> In short, it looks like different companies have different positions
>> on fan-authored materials for use with their gaming systems. What
>> position does your company take on this issue?
>>
>> ======================================================================
>>
>> From: Chaosium@aol.com
>> Date: Mon, 30 Jan 1995 13:52:01 -0500
>> To: jimv@cs.ucr.edu
>> Subject: net distribution policy
>>
>> Jim,
>>
>> Generally, we are happy to see people write material for our games, and
don\'
>> have a problem with gamers sharing their original work and making it
>> available to others in a not-for-profit manner. As we are loath to
approach

material
>> on the internet. We generally rely on people\'s good intentions to enable
us

sinc

	the capabilities of passive sensors?

	I\'d personaly like passive shipborne sensors to be able to detect and 
	track ships in the clear at much larger ranges.

	Instead of using a -1 DM per 25,000km hex I propose a -1 DM  for
	distant range with a further -1 DM per range band past that.  Maximum
	limit would be the range of the sensor as listed on the tables.

	Planetary based sensors should get an appropriate bonus because
	of their (possibly) large size.

	Ships wishing to avoid detection would be forced to move close to 
	massive bodies that are nutrino sources to mask themselves.  This
	would make GGs more attractive.

	This would also push out many weaponry ranges.  Missiles could be
	coasted out to engage enemy targets.  Fighters now become important
	anti-cruise missile defence for a fleet.  Hunting down passive sensor
	bouys/mines would become an important fleet task.

	Doing this could also force fleets to deploy outsystem, and GG masking
	and refueling becomes a distinct possibility.  Jumping insystem would
	be good for supprise, but would also immediatly expose the entirety
	of the fleet to planetary defences/sensors.

	Lots \'o comments wanted....

	It has been pointed out that the Traveller idea of defending gas 
	giants, of fleets refueling there before assaulting the main world,
	of SDBs hiding there to ambush fleets, of merchants refueling there,
	are all bogus ideas when confronted with a "reality" check.

	Fleets intent on pounding a mainworld would enter around the 200radius
	limit of that world, several tens of AU away from any gas giant.  SDBs
	stationed there would not be able to reach attack range of home for
	many hours, too long to prevent the reduction of their world.  
	Merchants waste too much valuable time moving to a GG first to refuel.
	Better to buy fuel and save on the man-days of salry/overhead, and
	move cargoes faster.

	So why station SDBs at GGs?  Why would an attacking fleet jump in
	system at a GG first?  Why would a merchant choose to go the a GG 
	first?

	The first thing that comes to mind is that a GG has a huge magnetic 
	and gravitic field that can mask the presence of ships upon emergence
	from jump.  SDBs would probably prowl around there to catch such 
	interlopers and provide early warning/defence if that happens to be
	a fleet.  Enemy scouts could use GGs to mask their presence in an
	enemy system, while aiming their sensors insystem to check for the
	presence of a fleet, ground defences, early warning picketts/bouys 
	ect.  They may be able to slip in, get target information, and get
	out undetected.  

	An invadeing fleet unsure of what awaits them at a target world could
	jump in near a GG to be partialy/fully masked.  It could then scan the
	system, refuel, and jump away if the system is too well defended.  If
	not it could refuel, dress their lines, and make a methodical attack.

	Because deadfall weaponry is so nasty, and any foreign ship has the
	potential to be an enemy/terrorist it may be that many worlds would
	forbid foreign shipping insystem.  A GG station would provide a way
	point for foreign traffic, with shuttles provideing passage to the
	main world.  It seems to make good military sense to me.  With the
	state of weaponry being as it is in MT I can\'t see any ship being 
	allowed anywhere near the 200radius limit of a mainworld without a
	thorough Mk1 EYEBALL search first.

	Smugglers make out on the deal as well.  They could easily hide 
	contriband at the GG, hire a local shuttle to pick it up, and thus
	circumvent local authority.

	(This all assumes that sensor ranges in MT are much greater than those 
	allowed in the combat rules.)

The Original traveller ranges of detection at 1 light second and tracking 
to 2 light seconds, seem very short.

If these are assumed to be the ranges of the Fire Controll sensors, this 
makes a little more sense.  Hitting a Type-S at 3ls, needs a minimun 
accuracy of 0.009arc-seconds! (0.02 @ 1 light-second)


A passive sensor has effectivly an unlimited range, (and to some extent 
so does an active one).

What limits the range is how sensitive the detector is to very small 
signals.

The size of a sensor (at least say an optical one) limits the angular 
resolution of the sensor.  A 30cm mirror gives enougth resolution to 
image most stars (1arc-second). But the lvel of light is so faint you 
need 8 or 10meter mirrors to collect enought light.

But I digress...

Most ships should have suitable sensors to be able to navigate in-system, 
military and scout ships will have sensors suitable to get information 
(star-type, GG presence etc.) about a star system from say 4pc away, so 
that they can make plans, (refulling stratergy).  In any event using 
synthetic aperture techniques would greatly improve sensor performance, 
as would TL15 image processing computers!


GG Refulling (military)
On arriving in system the fleet will have fuel for power and manoeuvering 
for approx 3 weeks at best.  They will be unable to jump out of system.

It could be argued that the first priority is to refuel the fleet, so that it
can escape by jump if things get to hot, or jump in persuit of a fleeing foe.

(To deny yourself that flexibility seems IMHO great folly) A fleet cannot
carry the fuel it needs, the tankers would be huge, and have no room for any
weapons (i.e be _very_ vulnerable), then you would have to consider the
tankers disposable (@jump4).  Drop tanks would ease this, but degrade fleet
performace. 

Intelligence on enemy vessels insystem will at best be two weeks old, so 
effectivly you are jumping blind into a system.  When you arrive you\'ll 
want to assess the new situation and alter plans accordingly.

imagine
	The Zhos jump a moderate sized task force into a backwater world.  
	They emerge at 100 diameters to commence pre-landing bombardment.  
	Sitting round the world is the 8th Spinward Marches Fleet, A BatRon of 
	Tigeresses, and associted craft (engaged in a flanking manoeuver), which 
	promply smashes the Zhos, then has breakfast!

To first order the angular resolution is simply:

A.min = (1.22*wavelength)/diameter

Where A.min is in radians, wavelength is in meters, and diameter is the 
diameter of the detector (or in the case of synthetic aperture arrays, the 
distance between the far detectors (though sampling becomes an issue in this
case)).

So, if any of you missed it on rgf.marketplace, someone is
auctioning off the following:

:Limited edition Traveller Aid Society Alien Encyclopedia
:A reprint of all of the original Aliens modules produced between
:1981 and 1987 by GDW, as well as some never before seen material.
:
:There are 200 copies worldwide.  This is #130.  All are signed by Mark 
:Miller.  The book is hard bound with a cloth weave and is extremely 
:durable.  The book is in excellent condition.  
:
:Included are the original modules for:  Aslan, K\'kree, Vargr, Zhodani,
:Droyne, Solomani, Hivers, Darrians and the Alien Realms modules, as 
:well as original draft material for the design of Aliens in general 
:produced by GDW in 1981. 

Has anyone every actually seen one of these things? I\'m too poor to even
think about buying it, not to mention I already have all the alien 
modules already, but it sounds like a nice collectors item.

I\'m just curious if anyone has actually seen one of these things mostly.

(If anyone wants the original article for price and how to contact the 
bidder, whom I have no affiliation with, email me.)

Also - I recently managed to get my hands on a whole set of MegaTraveller
books (call me behind the times :) ) and someone mentioned that MT had
\'an errata the size of a phone book\'. Anyone know if there\'s a comprehensive
errata somewhere in eletronic form, or that I can get my hands on hardcopy?

    'body' => 'Being that I have spent the last five (fruitless) years in the internatonal 
transportation business, the commerce systems in traveller have struck me 
as particularly shallow.  Basically, traveller (and mega-) commerce have 
been of the 18th century merchanteer variety: i buy cargo from a seller at 
point a, ship it to point b, and hope the selling price is > than cost of 
goods + transport costs.  really, that\'s it.  
here are some of the issues i bring to the table - i have solutions to 
them, but i am more interested in seeing if anyone except me REALLY cares 
enough to put them into practice (i am not currently in any running game)
1) shipping companies - using earth 1995 as an example - the merchanteer 
method of shipping just does NOT make sense economically.  just as the 
craftsman-style operations have gone by the wayside in favor of 
mass-production, economies of scale are also applicable to the shipping 
business.  because a large company, shipping a variety of products over a 
number of ports is relatively more insulated from the business price 
cycles , they can trim their profit margins to just above cost and still 
make a hefty profit - always undercutting the single-merchant who must take 
high margins to insure against the next shipment being a loser.  and 
shipping companies move to fill EVERY needed void.  sure, a major frieght 
line may not stop weekly at every world in the regina subsector, but 
certainly, if there is cargo to move for profit, they will have "feeder" 
service to those points, albeit with smaller vessels and irregularly or at 
long intervals.  simply, the merchanteer system cannot work.
2) standardization: in the 1960s, the steamship lines of the world realized 
the huge time savings involved in standardization.  rather than having 
every shipper send their cargo in boxes, pallets, etc to the pier where it 
would be loaded on the vessels, now 90% of the steamhsip lines use 
CONTAINERS.  8\' high and wide, and either 20 or 40\' long, they are 
optimized for road/rail/ocean transport.  sure, the management of empty 
container pools is complex, but the methods of making sure enough empty 
containers are available at any given point is now simply statistics: if 
there is a yearly surge in the need for containers in a given area, reduce 
rates for freight TO that area in the months preceeding - soon, the market 
will make sure you have enough containers.  why hasn\'t traveller figured 
this out?
3) Customs - the BIG bugaboo of traveller.  customs and import/export 
regulations - even in a relatively lassez-faire country as our own - are 
not a benign thing.  on the export side, the us government has a 10" thick 
manual listing controlled commodities (things you cannot export without a 
license, like nuclear switches), banned exporters (persons who are not 
allowed to export anything because of past violations) and export 
regulations.  the regulations manual for hazardous shipping - showing 
packaging, stowage, handling, and transport rules - are bigger, at about 
16-20" thick. on the import side it\'s even worse.  and this is one state, 
one one planet, all at roughly the same tech level. now image what regs 
would be like if you had to potentially deal with exports to 10,000 
worlds with different biospheres, religions, governments, languages, etc.
it\'s mind boggling.
4) and this is somewhat off-track: tech levels.  in a sector or subsector 
where there are tech 14 planets, why are there any that are tech 8 or9 or 
10? or any other number, for that matter?  i mean, i can understand that in 
some cases aboriginal populations would need protection (?) from high-tech 
infiltrating their development, but is it really logical to say that a 
planet would stay at tech 8 a one-week-jump from a tech 12 or higher?  not 
for years and years.  that\'s like saying that while europeans use 
telephones, we\'re still stuck with morse code in the usa.  i would say 
(conservatively) you would have a general diffusion of the average tech in 
less than 100 years.  i\'m sure someone will disagree, so i would like to 
hear it.

    'body' => 'I\'m glad you brought this up, because this has also been a peeve of mine 
as well.  Along with religion, trade is one of the least developed areas 
of Traveller.  I suppose this is due to the orientation of most gamers 
and the wargamer heritage of Traveller itself - ever notice just how many 
pages are devoted to weapons and weapons systems in published Traveller 
materials?  Granted, most RPGs have the same orientation, but frankly I 
feel that too often Traveller is just "today with better guns."  

Anyway, here is how I have tried to deal with some of the issues Steve 
raised:

CONTAINERS: I have long assumed that essentially all trade travels in 
standard containers, and that all starship bays are designed to hold 
them.  In civilized areas, the ships in my campaign are nothing but 
drives, crew quarters, and fuel - all cargo is pre-placed in modules, 
delived to the 100D limit by tugs.  The model that Traveller presents is 
what I assume is in frontier areas like the Spinward Marches - trade is 
still developing, and networks are changing.  Since the rules make clear 
that starships hulls are in service for decades, even centuries, flexible 
designs that can handle a variety of tasks as the years roll by are a 
good investment.

SMALL TRADERS: Why do things like Free and Far Traders exist?  Why do 
mercantile styles of trading exist?  I model my universe on current world 
conditions yet again.  While large countries like the USA, France, or 
Japan have big container ships going back and forth between them, 
backwaters like the Ascension Islands or other isolated populations are 
serviced by small, antiquated ships that carry a wide variety of cargo.  
In the Spinward Marches, there are worlds only a few parsecs from Rhylanor 
that are essentially backwaters, tiny places with tiny needs.  That\'s 
where Free Trders go, not the highly populated systems.

CUSTOMS:  This is the most interesting point you raise.  I\'ve always used 
customs as a way to hassle players, driving the plot along.  Beyond that, 
I haven\'t given it much thought.  I always assumed that this was one of 
the few thing the Imperium did - regulating interstellar trade, that is 
(along with bopping the odd Zho or Solomani on the head).  I\'d be 
interested in what other folks have done along these lines.  


TECH LEVELS:  I alays treat tech levels as what the system is capable of 
"Manufacturing," not what is "For Sale."  When one buys a television in 
Haiti, it probably comes from Japan.  Of course, a television bought in 
the USA also probably comes from Japan.  However, if you really wanted 
one, an American company could build you a TV.  Thus, I\'ve always treated 
low tech worlds in Traveller as being those that have decided to import, 
rather than manufacture for themselves.  You can buy a Grav Belt on 
Knorbes, a tech two world in the Regina subsector - it\'s just 
manufactured somewhere else. 
	As to why some worlds have low tech levels, one might as well ask 
why some ares of our own world are still low tech, centuries after the 
industrial revolution.  Isolation, lack of natural resources, cultural 
barriers, all play a part.  I\'m not saying the Traveller univers is 
likely, but given the assumptions it\'s at least possible.  Remember, 
humans have lived in Africa longer than any other continent, and many 
parts of Africa are still poor and undeveloped, centuries after the 
cotton gin and the spinning jenny.

The "tech difference" problem is one of the biggest gripes of the 
people I roleplay with.  I think when Traveller was originally 
designed the ease with which technology could proliferate was 
underestimated.  The rationalisations which I plan to use for running 
a campaign in the Spinward Marches are:

The region has been very recently colonised (within the last 100 
years).  As such many of the colonies are still struggling to make
themselves self-sufficient...but I assume in the long run they will
all be capable of producing the higher tech.

The Imperium has a ban on technology/information exports to the 
"native" governments in the Marches, this creates a black market in 
Imperial high tech equipment...but I assume in the long run that at 
least some of the independent systems will begin to match the Imperial 
technology (industrial espionage, research & development, copyright 
violations, etc).

I am also toying with the idea of the MegaCorporations holding 
Imperial Monopolies for such things as jump drive components, military 
armaments, etc...this reduces the number of worlds in the Imperium 
which are allowed to produce the high tech equipment.

On another tact, why does the Spinward Marches seem to be relatively 
free of Vargr?  Why did the Vargr not extensively colonise the area 
sometime before the Third Imperium began expanding into it?  I tend to 
assume large Vargr minority populations in the Coreward subsectors of 
the Marches.

1) The merchanteer model possibly can\'t be economically justified, but it
makes for a dandy game.  I\'ve run (and played in) a game where the players
set up a shipping line.  It ceased to be fun once it became a matter of
statistics.  (That\'s probably why my character engineered a resistance
movement to the Imperium during the FFW - boredom.)  Player interactions are
kept at the personal level, while bookkeeping is kept to a minimum.

2) Containerization exists in Traveller.  Check out the MegaTraveller Journal
(issue 3) for an equipment sheet for a standard container (one of mine). 
Other sizes exist.  My own detailed trade system assumes that freight is
usually in containers (except for lo-tech worlds), while cargo requires
players to have (or buy) their own (unless they\'re really lucky, or good
bargainers).

3) Customs exists, at least in my game.  Assume expert systems plus
Admin/Legal skill, unless you really like inventing regulations and red tape.
 Why else is exporting to hi-law worlds so exciting?  ("Captain Smith, under
the authority of the Refurbished Furniture Safety Act we are impounding this
cargo of grapple grommets until you file a T24/c with the requisite 24.2 and
65.3 attachments.")  

4) Tech level differences exist on Earth right now.  The key thing to do is
draw a distinction between knowledge-based technology and industry-based
technology.  For example, even a tech 1 world can have better medicine by
boiling water and keeping wounds clean.  Look at the UNICEF village in Kenya
(information available from UNICEF and many other NGOs) for examples of "high
science/low technology" devices.

Agreed, but big shipping companies don\'t provide the same room for
adventure as struggling independent merchanteers (all the
possibilities provided by a large shipping company can be included by
placing such companies alongside merchanteers in the same setting).
On a smaller scale, independent road hauliers still operate alongside
the major firms -- but they struggle.

>3) Customs - the BIG bugaboo of traveller.  customs and import/export 

I\'ve always assumed that freight has a consigner and a consignee, who
have already cleared their freight with customs at both ends, or are
responsible if anything goes wrong.  Of course, if things really go
wrong, the carriers are stuck with the problems -- but that is in the
realms of adventure!  As to speculative cargo, if something is
restricted, I always allow PCs a chance to discover this before they
buy, providing they think to check.  So many things are likely to be
banned or subject to customs tariffs on a given world that a random
roll involving the trade law level and some modifiers should be
sufficient.

Not disagreeing, just putting an alternative :-).  Italy has a \'phone
system, but if you cross the Med. to N. African countries, the system
is considerably nore primitive, as are general levels of technology;
go even further south, and telecommunications are virtually
non-existent.  Italy to Tunis is considerably less than a week\'s
travel time, and virtually instantaneous communication.  Add to this
cultural and governmental resistance to technological change
(eg. Aramanx in the Aramis subsector), and you can justify the TLs of
most worlds (should you wish to).  I seem to remember this topic coming 
up on TML/XTML in the past, and there were two schools of thought:  TL 
uniformity, or wide variations over short distances.

Any rules fixes are always more than appreciated on this (and the traveller,
i.e. TNE list). 

>1)...the merchanteer method of shipping just does NOT make sense
economically.

I quite agree. There seems little recognition among Traveller referees (or
even GDW themselves) of the huge multi-million ton bulk transports "bulkers"
that would perform most of the shipping in the year 5000-whatever A.D. when
Traveller is set.
However, there is always a market for the transport of small lots of
specialist goods, and this is (IMHO) where most Traveller trade comes from.
i.e. the trade tables given in the rules ONLY cover these sort of shipments
and don\'t (in my games) represent the bulk goods hauled (certainly not when
rolling up the few tons of your average cargo lot). Reasons for small lots
are:
(1) High value - too expensive to insure with a bulker.
(2) High value - insufficient security on a bulker.
(3) High risk - bulker won\'t or can\'t handle such cargo.
(4) Illegal - can\'t be smuggled through usual channels on a bulker.
(5) Special destination - bulkers just don\'t go there (low pop world, D-E
starport).
(6) Special destination - has to be landed in the middle of jungle, etc.
(7) Special timing - must be there by given date and time (bulker can\'t make
it quick enough).
(8) Personal value - owner wants to travel \'close\' to his possessions, not
have them stored at the bottom of a million-ton hold.
(9) Care - cargo requires constant care/maintenance/feeding that is too
troublesome/expensive for a bulker.
(10) Commercial secrecy - owner doesn\'t want competitors finding out where
or what he\'s transporting (bulker cargo lists would be fairly easy to come
by).

Major cases are those of destination and timing - yes, bulkers will go to
many worlds but (in the interests of economy) they may detour via higher pop
worlds before heading for lower pop ones (to ensure an otherwise loss-making
trip has some profit margin). Given these detours, the time factor for
loading and unloading a bulker, the inflexibility of bulker timetables, and
the fact that for a reasonable profit margin the bulkers are probably Jump 1
or 2 at most, any small trader able to pick up a small cargo at a moment\'s
notice and do Jump 2 at max speed for the given destination star system
might well seem like a better proposition for someone in a hurry to get his
cargo somewhere.

Naturally, some small traders might provide the \'feeder\' service you mention:
>certainly, if there is cargo to move for profit, they will have "feeder" 
>service to those points, albeit with smaller vessels and irregularly or at 
>long intervals.

PASSENGERS
In case (9) we\'re crossing an important boundary - that between bulkers and
passenger liners. My bulkers are pretty much like modern cargo ships, i.e
they are only equipped to carry a few passengers, and then not in any
comfort. Small traders can exist for passenger trade for the same reasons as
given for cargo, i.e. flexibility, speed, access, peculiar carriage
conditions, peculiar destination, etc. all the things that would make the
ticket office of a commercial line simply stare at you for asking. "Sorry? I
thought I just heard you ask PanStellar to fly you to the island of Banairos
in the middle of the Amarian jungle on Phlemos... Oh, you did... Sir, if I
might suggest that you try Honest Harry\'s Bucket-shop Tramp Traders...
Ticket desk? Ha ha - sorry, sorry. No, there\'s no ticket desk, just try the
crew bars on level 23. Harry\'s the one lying at the back, drunk, with
obvious signs of alcohol-induced incontinence... oh, and have a nice day."
(beaming smile from ticket clerk).

>2) standardization:

Traveller cargo does come in standard containers but because of the oddities
of ship sizes, some containers are pretty small. If I remember Traders and
Gunboats (CT Supp 7), the diagrams for the Subsidised Merchant (400 tons)
showed some containers - I think (total guess here) they were about 3x3x6
metres but it might have been smaller.

>3) Customs - the BIG bugaboo of traveller.

bugaboo. Referee heaven is what I call it! :-)

>...10" thick manual...16-20" thick...

Frank admission (or Peter, Tom, Harry, etc.): I don\'t know much about this
except what I\'ve read or watched on TV documentaries, but it seems that a
lot of freight (certainly EEC stuff) just flies by customs - in most cases
they just don\'t have the man-power to stop and check every shipment. As long
as the paperwork\'s okay, then you\'re through, no matter how many long pipes
you\'re carrying for someone\'s super gun.
Extrapolate using Steve\'s comments:

>...now image what regs 
>would be like if you had to potentially deal with exports to 10,000 
>worlds with different biospheres, religions, governments, languages, etc.
>it\'s mind boggling.

Yep. But what\'s interesting is whether it would slow down customs or speed
things up?

Customs post, checking vehicles coming off the inter-system drive on, drive
off ferry:

Officer 1: "Why\'d you just wave that truck through?"

Officer 2: "Driver\'s only bloody Vargr isn\'t he. You ever tried talking to
one? Try asking him what\'s in the back? I mean, this illegible scribble on
the documents means you can\'t tell what he\'s *supposed* to be carrying, let
alone what\'s actually in there. And there\'s no point holding him, cos he\'s a
contractor to some line or other so it\'s them you have to hassle, and the
boss spent four days last time trying to sort out the legalities with their
embassy and... well, basically I just don\'t want the hassle. Next time he
comes through I\'ll wave him into your queue and you can take his truck
apart, eh?"

Officer 1: "Are you kidding? The length of my queue\'s doubled in the time
it\'s taken for you to tell me that! All these bloody day-trippers coming
over from Regina just for the duty frees. Oh yes, officer, of course this
entire BUS full of beer is just for my own personal consumption - for the
next 50 years, eh?"

Officer 2: "Ah yes, I know the guy with the bus - comes through about once a
week, doesn\'t he?"

TECH LEVELS

Ah, Steve\'s brought up an old and much-discussed point here, about why
aren\'t all worlds about the same tech level.
To summarise:
Tech level means average world ability to manufacture.
Some worlds don\'t have the expertise/raw materials/base population/etc. (no
on-world metals -> no steel mill)
Some worlds just find it\'s cheaper to buy in high tech goods. (on-world
metals are only found 2 miles under surface - too expensive to mine)
Some worlds aren\'t allowed higher tech for political/technical/etc. reasons.
(here Mr. Iraq, please have our latest jamming suite and we\'ll throw in
these nice radar systems too).
Some worlds have been exploited (a starting low tech world can\'t pay for
high tech so the corporations don\'t regard it as much of a market and prefer
to exploit it instead).
Some worlds don\'t want their populace high tech (low tech peoples with less
ability to communicate with each other and the outside world are far easier
to control in a dictatorship, religious system, etc.)
etc.
etc.

>...that\'s like saying that while europeans use 
>telephones, we\'re still stuck with morse code in the usa...

I think comparing the US and Europe with any \'third world\' country (or is it
\'developing nation\' now?) would quickly show that in the latter, the rich
may well have mobile phones, but the poor often don\'t have wired telephones
and certainly couldn\'t make them, nor know how to repair them.

Given the wide-ranging politics and boom-bust nature of economics, etc. I
can well see how tech levels would (deliberately or otherwise) vary widely
from world to world. The Imperium doesn\'t (TNE: didn\'t) have the will or
power to try to even things out - average techs are much more likely to be
equal and stable in the "rediscovered" worlds of TNE.

Just some thoughts, remember none of this has passed through my brain on the
way to the keyboard so my body (excepting two or three fingers) disclaims
all responsibility for anything said herein.

	Straight Off, you have to understand that over the immense inter-
stellar distances involved in traveller, trade and commerce start to once 
again resemble the kind of commerce that took place back in the 1700\'s.  
Primarily this is because of the large amount of time it can take to get 
from point A to point B.  To be totally honest todays shipping just does 
not take as long, most shippments are in less that a couple days and there 
are even some that happen over night.  In traveller it can take up to a 
bloody month to just jump four times(Depending on the ship.)  This in and 
of itself makes it so that  a merchant has to risk a lot on his jumps, he 
absolutely has to make a profit, not just hope he gets one.  Further this 
is a mater of Trader captains and Merchant princes, these people own thier 
entire business and some even take pride in thier ability to trade, a lot 
like a frontiersman of the 1700\'s.  So befor you completely rewrite the 
commerce issues in traveller think these things thru.  True I would agree 
if I could get  from Vland to Solomani space in a couple of days, but this 
jus will not happen in the traveller system.

Stay Frosty,

If you have solutions, I\'m interested to hear them!

  First, about craftsman-style, economies of scale operations: 
  Right now, the ability to do one-time, unique "crafted" manufacturing 
at a sane price is growing quite rapidly.  I wouldn\'t be surprised if the 
ability to do one-time, single-merchantman operations at a high profit 
level ALL THE TIME (well, high enough to get his own niche) also expands. 
Ever heard of niche marketing?
  And the single merchantman can react to changes in the business climate 
far more quickly than any megacorp can.

  Second, on standardization: in both MT and TNE the Displacement ton is 
the basic unit of shipping.

  Third, on customs: the vast complexity of customs only helps to provide 
more marketing niches for the single merchantman, who can exploit new 
reg\'s and erratic law changes much more quickly than ye olde megacorp.  
Moreover, he is simply too small a target for most bureaucrats to waste 
time attacking.
  The only problem he may face is reading all the red tape: but by TL B, 
it\'s almost certain that you can buy programs which can interpret a 
particular form of legal language, thus saving on time.  Or he can simply 
hire a lawyer\'s services: consider this part of his operating costs.

  Fourth, on Tech Levels: While the Solomani (like you and me) like to 
get as much tech as possible, the Vilani (and possibly other cultures) 
have a much greater desire for stability than tech.  After all, the folks 
in China deliberately chose to stay at a lower tech level than was 
neccessary for centuries after the Mongol Hordes were vanquished.
  Moreover, remember that the Vilani have existed for 11,000 years, and 
have serious influence on the Imperium.  Such people may, quite 
rationally, decide to stay at a particular Tech Level to obtain certain 
cultural goals, to remain compatable with nature, etc.
  People _can_ live quite comfortable at low TL\'s, and if they can get 
their hand\'s on off-world medical technology, why shouldn\'t they?
  Finally, remember that the real NEED for Tech Level growth remains 
military.  And the Imperial Military in Traveller is uniformaly TL F.  
What Tech Level `the little people\' choose to live at is irrevelant.

[about the Traveller interstellar economic system, deleted]

Yeah, the handling of interstellar economics may be a bit off in the game,
but that\'s probably because some allowances were made to keep the players
involved -- paperwork adventures just don\'t seem to go over well.  Still....

Freight shipping companies do exist (like Tukera Lines) that dominate the
jump-3 and jump-4 long-range shipping along the xboat routes.  However, 
the Imperial Ministry of Transportation has fixed the rates that commercial
ships can charge for freight at kCr 1 per ton per jump, the same way that
passenger rates are fixed.  So the money you make depends on how efficient
your ship is and whether you can fit the freight in your hold, as long as 
you\'re operating as a shipping and not a trading concern, which works a
bit differently.

Containers have existed in Traveller for a long time, but are only referred
to in the type "R" Subsidized Merchant information.  They\'re three meters
by three meters by six meters, and displace 54 kL.  The "Fat Trader" could
carry fifty in its\' 200 displacement-ton hold (in Classic Traveller), but
a couple would probably be used to store the baggage of the passengers.  I
suppose the bulk traders that we haven\'t seen much of (like MT\'s "Common
Imperial Transport" of 20000 d-tons) would mainly be containerized, and 
many would operate on the trade routes that follow the xboat routes. 

Container pools could easily exist, and we wouldn\'t have to worry about 
them.  An article in _Traveller\'s Digest_ had pools of portable low berths
that would be mounted on the low berth racks in the ship so that long
distance travel, say from Mora to Vland, could be done by freezing the
passenger once and moving the berth from ship to ship.  You\'d probably
have to travel on a line like Tukera or make some sort of arrangements
with a travel agency on scheduled shipping for this to work real well, 
and you\'d probably have to stick to xboat routes, but it\'s safer than 
reviving at each stop every week.  The portable berth pool was managed by 
IMoT\'s Imperial Starport Authority (the body that runs almost all Imperial 
ports), and captains bought into the pool of portable low berths in 
proportion to the number of spaces they carried to support them; the
folks at DGP said that it would cost the same as permanent low berth
fixtures for simplicity.  A similar system to handle empty cargo
containers can easily be imagined, paid for by the freight owners.

As for customs troubles, it\'s probably best to assume that the players
understand and follow the regs unless there\'s some good reason not to.
If I remember right, expanded character generation for merchants requires
all characters to have Legal skill before they can take the test for
promotion to Captain.  No reason to sweat this stuff too much, it\'s
just a game.

Hi all,

In my never-ending quest to find out stuff I don\'t know
(which is a lot), I was wondering...

Loren was kind enough to send me a list of the CT/MT products
that GDW still carries, and under the MT section is

MegaTraveller
      Item:                         Price Each:
 205  Imperium                      $24.00

What is this? I don\'t think it\'s the boxed set (is it?).

The first person to answer this question gets the right
to hurl an asteroid into my house from orbit, if they
can figure out how to do it.

Imperium is the board game that started the whole Traveller thing.  It\'s 
the series of wars between Earth and the Vilani Empire that led to the 
Rule of Man.  Ever wonder why Remulak is in the Solomani Rim?  It\'s in 
Imperium.  The one listed for sale looks like the second edition in

commerce rules.  I think that many of us care about them, and

there are probably a number of "fixes" in use.  I\'d like to see

Steve\'s approaches, especially because he has experience in the

field.  Here are my comments about the issues raised in Steve\'s

post:



1) (these numbers don\'t necessarily correspond to Steve\'s)  Earth in

1995 may not be a good analogy to all of the Imperium in 5600. 

The designers express (in the three original black books) their

intention that the Imperium be somewhat analogous to Earth\'s
mercantile age.  One reason is probably their belief that players
would enjoy the flexibility of owning their own ships more than
the constraints of being employees of megacorporations (I myself
did so when I started playing some 14 or 15 years ago, but now I
don\'t mind having my players work for someone else, fit their
adventures into their schedules, and hide them from their bosses).



2) There are major shipping companies in Traveller.  See Book 7:
Merchant Prince for a discussion of megacorporations like Tukera
Lines and Makhidkarun, which cover the entire Imperium (Book 7
also discusses shipping companies in the other major polities).  See
The Spinward Marches Campaign for a discussion of Al Morai, a
shipping company that serves the Spinward Marches.  Al Morai
has standard ships, standard bases, and (if memory serves) uses
containers.  



3) Are there freighters, tankers, and passenger ships owned by
individuals or small companies on Earth in 1995?


This is a long post for my wretched email system.  I\'ll try to upload

exercise considerable autonomy -- even to the point of going to

Anyway, I thank you all for your comments.  I think I now have a much 
better feel for the tech differences in the Traveller universe.

Anyway, now that I have you all thinking a bit about commerce in Traveller, 
here\'s a couple (real-life) situations guaranteed to make players pull 
their hair out, without neccessarily turning your game into "Bankers & 
Bookkeepers" (pardon the earthly idiom; I leave it to you all to translate 
these into terms compatible with your needs):
1) many countries (mainly 3rd world) rely on a couple of different means to 
raise funds...first is called legalization.  BEFORE goods can be shipped, 
they have to be stamped at the local consulate.  Of course, this takes 
about 2 minutes, but costs $200 or sometimes a percentage (2-5%) of the 
invoice value.  Note, this MUST be done or the customs officials at 
destination will seize the goods, netting more $$ for the govt & 
themselves.  THe second way of making money is similar, but involves a 
thorough pre-shipment inspection of the goods by a certified examiner, who 
then seals the goods and clears them for shipment.  In this case, the docs 
must be stamped AND the seals unbroken...or else.
2) Customs officials carry grudges...a long time.  Piss one off, and 
curiously, your shipments seem always to hit that "random inspection".
3) How about certain far eastern countries where you can provide a service, 
but then are advised that you cannot legally accept money from a local 
resident.  You must have them pay a state agency, who then pays 
you...usually taking about 10-50% (yes, 50%) as "Handling Fee". Surprise.
4) The law of the sea states that a captain may jettison ANY cargo deemed 
unsafe for his vessel.  No questions asked. hehehe.
5) Finally, a neat insurance trick: if a vessel sinks or is severely 
damaged, a "General Average" is declared.  The trick is that the owners of 
the cargo carried ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPENSATING THE STEAMSHIP LINE FOR 
ITS LOSS!  Hee hee.  Say the ship sunk is worth 10 million, and the total 
value of goods carried is 800,000.   If you have a cargo worth 40,000 on 
the vessel, you owe the steamship line 40/800 or 1/20 the value of the 
vessel, or $500,000!!! (plus you still have to legally pay the freight 
charges).

I have a zillion of \'em.  All true, too.
Again, thanks for all your comments.
PS: Not to start a wor that\'s probably already been heavily hashed, but 
does anyone else think GDW shot themselves in the head by effectively 
discarding the most complete and magnificent game universe in the biz? 
(TNE)  Just wondering.

It\'s the boardgame simulation of the war (wars) between the old and decadent
first vilani imperium and the \'just arrived to understand the jump drive\'

small traders still exist, particularly on the main trade routes) is the
speed factor.
Given a bulk trader (B) and a small trader (S) with equivalent jump and
manouevre drives, S will beat B to a given market 99 times out of 100.
For B: Wait at port 1 for given departure time - all cargo should be booked
in several days in advance and should be loaded many hours in advance (for
customs, containerisation, etc.), get clearance for shuttle, shuttle up to
B, docking with B or orbital port, transfer (in space or through a bustling
orbital port) from shuttle to B, sealing up and checking of B, e.g. are the
bow doors locked closed, etc. - subtle European jibe - check all passengers
on board, power up engines, move out to jump distance, and jump). At the
other end, reverse this process but include making sure cargo for the next
planet isn\'t blocking the unloading of cargo for the current destination,
add in safety factors for handling bulk containers in such a huge ship
(probably in vacuum), check the correct packages are being taken down, wait
for the next shuttle if there are insufficient to take the entire
consignment (possible hundreds of thousands of tons for a hi pop planet),
etc.
For S: Leave port as soon as the cargo is loaded and cleared (no need to
book or load in advance), get clearance once only - for leaving planet, head
straight for jump distance, and jump. At the other end, reverse this process
but DON\'T add any extras: assuming S can land on-planet again, there\'s no
shuttling; there\'s only a few crates in the back so keeping track of which
to unload and getting access to same is far easier than for B.

That might also explain why a lot of smaller traders are given mail runs -
they\'re almost certain to get there faster.

 Learning how to handle a real sword after many years
of Fantasy RPG experience taught me that you can *never* have
a realistic RPG system for any profession. It makes sense:
if it is professionally realistic then you need a professional
to be able to work it! The best you should aim for is a
model that feels right to a someone with a little knowledge.

>1) the merchanteer method of shipping just does NOT make sense
>economically.
 I\'ve always assumed there existed the large shipping
combines that accounted for 98% of shipping. This, however,
is boring to role-play. Thus the action usually centres on
the small feeder operators or contract haulers.

>2) standardization
 I agree 100%. I put an article on the TML a couple of
years ago detailing standardised 1, 2, 4, and 8 ton containers.
The rules don\'t explicitly mention this, but they don\'t
overrule it either (thanks for giving the actual measurements
for modern contains. I wanted those when I was doing my own
system.)

>3) Customs
 Heh. Try living in the European Community! I normally
roll -vs- the Law Level with a +/- depending on the type
of cargo. Ever think of wraping some rules around your
experience? This is XBOAT, not TRAVELLER. Mega/Traveller
don\'t belong to GDW here. We can do what we want.
 Of course there are plot ideas from this. Different
companies producing competing AI software to fill out
your custom\'s forms :-).

>4) and this is somewhat off-track: tech levels.
 You have made a common mistake. That is, to assume that
the Tech Level is the level of goods available on a planet. What
the Tech Level is is the level of goods that can be *produced*
on that planet.
 Take Ireland as a modern example. Breaking down to
WBH levels you might say we are up to tech 8 on Computers (the
Shannon Silicon Valley) but we can\'t be beyond 4 or 5 in
personal or military weapons systems!
 Similarly 3rd world planets or planets that primarily
produce Natural Resources don\'t need to be able to produce
things that are that high tech. They need them to work but
they don\'t need to produce them locally.
 This is what makes commerce work. Ireland would shrivel
up and die in a remarkably short time if it had to rely only
on what it could produce itself!

azazel@dudael.equinox.gen.nz mentioned something about Vargr in the

I dunno azazel??  Maybe they got exterminated by the Vilani as Zhodani 
agents!!!  But seriously...

I agree with you about the Vargr being well spread throughout the sector, 
and in fact in all of the coreward sectors of the Imperium they _must_ make 
up a significant proportion of the minority (non-Vilani/Solomani) 
populations.  In fact isn\'t there a Vargr Archduke out there somewhere 
(Brzk) and he got elected some how.  

However many of the Vargr would have been driven back to the Extents by 
the arrival of the Imperium with all it\'s restrictions on trade, 
commerce, war, cannibalism {Vargr:do you serve K\'Kree waiter?;  Waiter:of 
course sir, we serve all major races at this restaurant; V:no, I don\'t 
think you understood my question, do you _serve_ K\'Kree? - I\'ll have 
mine \'bleu\' thankyou. W:-*-}, etcetera.

In the Extents there is much more emphasis on charisma than in the 
Imperium, and most of the Vargr in the Imperium will either live in 
Kennel-Town (similar to Tiger Town out of Niven\'s works), or be hiding 
out somewhere from the authorities.  Few would have made the adjustment 
to \'human\' life (at least not permanently).

I flew out of a \'two gate\' airport last week, and instead of getting your 
basic wide-body jet, I watched an 18 seat twin prop pull up, painted with 
Northwest\'s colors.  It was clearly labelled as some unknown airline, 
probably a contractor to maintain Northwest\'s flight schedule when 
there\'s not enough tickets sold to justify a DC-9 (like when I arrived on 
Sunday evening!).  

Nothing like the feeling of having your carry-on bag unexpectedly removed 
from your hands and tossed into the nose-cone compartment before 
stepping aboard:  you understand why when you hunch down the five-foot 
tall aisle and try to turn into your seat. 

Getting off the beaten path, away from major travel & trade routes, is what 
makes Traveller so colorful!

I think there are plenty of reasons that shipping and commerce are very 
different in the Imperium then they are today...

Time lag in communications.

I think this alone describes why a lot of the Imperium is the way it is.

Picture a situation: A new product is developed on Planet X, 6 parsecs away
from Planet Y. 2 inhabitants of Y are on X the day the product is unveiled.
They both know people on Y will love it. But how to get it to Planet Y from
X???

One is a representitive of a big shipping company. If he was to follow
standard operating procedure like on modern Earth, he\'d have to contact his
bosses on Planet Y, get approval, arrange customs clearances, etc. This
would take a lot of time, at least 1, probably 2 weeks for each jump
back and forth. And he\'d have to stay on Planet X the entire time to 
make sure the supply of this miracle product doesn\'t dry up. Of course,
once purchased and shipping, the product would probably have a marketing
strategy all the way to the final consumer.

The other person is a free trader captain. She just digs into his pocket,
buys a cargo bay full of the stuff and takes off. Upon arrival at Planet X,
she finds someone who will retail the stuff and tries to geta good price for
it.
Oh, she might have to bribe a few customs officials too.

One is low risk, but very slow, the other is much higher risk, but much 
quicker. Oh, and the second one has much higher potential profit.

So, which do you think PCs would rather be involved in?

As for standardized containers, sure, the big lines probably use them, 
but what happens when you want to bring back a herd of elephants for
your personal zoo? What about that shipment of highly radioactive artifacts
that have to be kept in a pure oxygen atmosphere or they\'ll be ruined?
There are a lot of things that don\'t fit in 2-ton standard containers
or that big companies can\'t or won\'t touch. In a real Imperium, the kind
of trade the players deal in would probably constitute less than 1% of
total interplanetary trade. That\'s still a lot of money...

Depending on how much time PC\'s spend planet bound, most PCs are going
to live out a lot of their life in space. A subsidised merchant that makes
20-odd jumps a year is going to require its crew to live between 40 and 60
percent of their lives in space. People onboard a navy ship will probably 
spend entire tours of duty on the ship.

Out of the entire Imperium, is this common? How many people would be doing
this sort of thing?  Do PCs have to have certain physical characteristics
that make them especially good space dwellers (eg. they don\'t vomit when
ever they end up in zero-g)? Is living on a navy ship with a crew on the
order of 30,000 people anywhere near the experience of living on 200-ton
free trader?

Basically, while the PCs aren\'t necessarily the Buzz Aldrins and Neil 
Armstrongs of the Imperium, they aren\'t the average office workers either.
Where do they fit in? What sort of attitudes do planet-bound people have
about space and "travellers"?

After a thousand years of it, I think a lot of the problems associated
with prolonged shipboard life would be solved, especially since the ships
have artifical gravity, but what problems might not be solved?

Do you think there would be the equivalent of cruise ships?
Just big ol\' ships that people take trips on, not so much to get anywhere,
but to just to hang out and relax for a while. I have these visions of
Capt. Stuebing on the Tukera Princess... how exciting and new.

Just wondering,

The ship may need to re-enter atmosphere, and the freight containers,
while tough, might also find the extra micro-meteoroid protection useful.
Traveller ships can get to quite fast speeds.  Otherwise, yeah, it
doesn\'t need to be inside if the containers can withstand vaccuum
for a week.

Incidentally, this brings up another freight quirk in Traveller that
people might be interested in.  According to the rules, usually
freight taken on in orbit is delivered when it reaches orbit of the
destination world, and freight taken on on-planet is delivered when
it reaches the surface of the destination world.  For most shipping
to class A/B/C starports, this works great, since those ports have
high-ports and shuttle service.

But here\'s an old trader trick to get some extra cash.  Take on a
shipment bound for a class D/E/X starport in orbit.  Fly it to the
destination under the standard shipping contract, where the freight
is legally delivered when it reaches orbit, and charge the shipper
shuttle fees to land the freight.  If the ship is an unstreamlined
old sub liner shuttling the passengers and cargo down with its\'
small craft, doing this becomes understandable.

Another comment, on container scale -- the 54 cubic meter containers 
from the fat trader are roughly the size of a trailer for a twenty
foot trailer truck that you might see on the road.

Book 8, Robots, was part of "Black Book Traveller" or CT, 
and was indeed published by the excellent DGP (moment of 
silent respect). There was also a "101 Robots" a book of 
designs. So far, neither MT or TNE has bothered to come up 
with decent robot design systems. I think the air of decay, 
futility, despair and TL 12- (robots start at 12) that is 
now the Official Policy (tm) of Traveller doesn\'t fit with 
the basically Asimov-like approach of the CT robot. The 
only robots which seem to appear in the TNE canon are 
virus-logged-killer-nutcase-generic-monster robots (can 
anyone say "D&D monster" or "Twilight in spaaaaccceee!")

Which is a damn shame cos they were quite good.

Two reasons, leaving aside combat for a moment: 
micro-meteorites, and the lanthanum jump net which must 
enclose anything going into jump with the ship. You would 
look a bit of agoon turning up without fuel, cargo or sub 
craft! And yes I _know_ the web isn\'t canonical in TNE. I

The robot rules in book 8 would probably work acceptably under MegaTraveller
and could even be blended with the vehicle design rules if you wanted 
something a bit bigger - like a robo-grav tank or some such.

And is it just me, or did MegaTraveller seem to somehow forget the concept
of computer programs? Computers are listed, but there\'s no mention of
all those good ol\' programs like in CT.

For an interesting take on this, read Norman Spinrad\'s _The Void
Captain\'s Tale_, which details some of the doings of the captain of
what in some respects is a "cruise ship", and of the "floating
kultura" of people who take the cruises. (One might also look at his
_Child of Fortune_ for a look at a particular type of "traveller".)

I too was wondering just what it is people _do_ on these one-week jump
periods. Maintenance? Keeping the books? Studying? Excercise?  There
has to be some way of keeping travellers from dying of boredom.
That\'s what stewards are for, I guess.

I think a lot of SF fans, when they think of "the romance of space"
and "the adventure of planetary colonization", are assuming it\'s like
the experience of people crossing the Atlantic on sailing ships and
starting colonies in the New World, where in all actuality it would be
like travelling in a submerged nuclear submarine to set up a camp in
Antarctica during the winter. In space, you can\'t go up on deck; on
many colony planets, you can\'t go outside without a pressure suit, and
going off into the wilderness is an invitation to a messy death.

Well, in the 18-19th centuries, most passengers passed the time on ship
with on board games: it seem\'s probable that a culture based on jump 
would have a mind-boggling amount and variety of activities to do on 
board, ranging from prayer sessions (you\'d be surprised how many people 
think that jump space is somehow supernatural) to Virutal Reality 
seminars.  I suspect that many people will just watch their favourate TV 
shows, or gather around a coffee table and just chat their way through 
the week in jspace.

All spacer are extremely wary of children onboard, while in jspace.  
Bored out of their skull\'s, they are certain to devise some form of 
`diversion\' that could spell TROUBLE... especially if the kids are 
from a space station, and know how to `hot wire\' the saftey\'s...

Well, few spacers suffer from jump sickness.  They are likely to 
have a feel for their ship.  Anything else?

It\'s very, very different in almost every way imaginable.  It\'s the 
difference between living in a small, steel city and a small, steel 
apartment.

Moreover, since so many Imperials are used to living in artifical 
enviroment\'s, I suspect that many would feel quite comfortable living on a 
Imperial capital ship.  Social character\'s, especially.

Free Traders are likely to be viewed as "tailess/furless Vargr" by the 
general Imperial public, and "lowlife criminal scum" by the Navy.  These 
people are just too deeply involved in too many shady deals to have a good 
reputation.

The above is the viewpoint of officaldom and mainline Vilani and 
near-Vilani systems (mainly, systems within the borders of the First 
Imperium).  In Solomani-dominant areas (conquered regions of the Solomani 
Sphere, and the Domain of Deneb) the image tend\'s to be strongly 
romantizied... after all, Solomani Sphere folk have little love for the 
Imperium, and Domain people - the frontier folk of the Imperium - like to 
root for the `little guy\', and have a high tolerance for irregular 
activity.  They tend to view Free Traders as the Han Solo\'s of space, 
(usually) good people at heart but too free to follow megacorp routine.

I suspect that there are two kind\'s of ship\'s are to be found.  One kind,
found largely in Core Sector (where shipping companies race each other
to put out the latest and the greatest), is simply the latest in luxury.  
Gold-plated hull\'s, marble computer terminals, ex-Admirals as Captains, 
these are the kind of ship an up-and-coming Noble just *has* to be seen on.

The other kind of cruise ship is found in the equally rich - but 
politically unstable - Solomani Rim Sector.  "Pure Power" is the 
watchword here, with nothing but cutting-edge technology and performance 
levels that wouldn\'t shame a warship.  Usually MUCH smaller than their 
massive Core brother\'s (about 10-20,000 Disp tons, compared to the 
100,000 - 500,000 Disp level\'s), these are the ship of choice for yachts 
for sector-level Dukes to the more important Count\'s.

Both ship\'s can be found on regular routes in Gushemege, Dagudashaag, 
Zarushagar and Massilia sectors.  Core-style ship\'s dominate Core and 
Vland sectors; Solomani-style ships dominate, well, the Solomani 
Rim.  True cruisers (in contrast to expensive liners, which isn\'t into
sightseeing) are rarely seen elsewhere in the Imperium, and are almost 
always Solomani-style.

the development of instantaneous communications, the financial markets 
weren\'t very well developed.  The development of the limited liability 
company didn\'t occur until -- what -- the 17th Century, and easy 
incorporation and public trading of stock weren\'t common until the 
mid-19th C.  By that time, the newspapers could get information by 
telegraph, and it was only a few short steps (with a big stumble in 1929) 
to Quotrons, world-wide cross-border equity and currency flows, and 
programmed trading.  That situation then lasts -- becoming more refined 
-- for some three hundred years, until the explosion of the Terrans into 
Vilani space.

How did the Vilani finance empire-spanning companies like Makhidkarun, 
Naasirka, and others?

How did the Solomani finance their explorations and conquests?

More to the point, after three thousand years of a steadily shrinking (in 
terms of time to get information) area of known space, how do the 
megacorporations raise funds?  We know that they are corporations, with 
some stock held by the public (see the Library Data article on 
megacorporations).  Where are the markets at which the public can buy 
stock (and, presumably, debt instruments)?  How do individual investors 
gauge the financial condition and future prospects of the company?  The 
major lenders and institutional investors are in an easier position, 
because they typically aren\'t going to speculate on the LICs\' short-term 
performance, but can do reasonable due diligence.

I suppose that there is a strain of Virus that perverts Quotron machines, 
too.  After the collapse, there will be a need to finance new ventures.  
Some capital will come from taxes, but some will come from investors 
("Buy Regency Bonds and help Norris help us get out of the sticks!").  
How will they assess risk, given communication time lags?  (Time lags 
become shorter after the collapse, because the markets are smaller.)

I solicit any comments about how the financial markets will work in and 
after the Third Imperium, whether directly related to these issues or not.

1) If the starport is a D/E/X type usually a shuttle who can carry one/two
container is sufficient, if it is a A/B/C type it has a shuttle service for
bigger exchange, so, if are not filthy rich, you get a non streamlined,
maybe patchworked, ship.

2) I may be wrong but I\'ll fail to see an armor, of any thickness, as a
protection vs any meteoroid of any size unless you are very lucky with the
relative speed.

3) So what you see more science fantasy between force fields and
organic-autosealing hulls?

4) Something I see the Traveller space people too much \'by the book\' type.
In the real world, when a technology become of widespread use you\'ll find
all the misuse, rulebending, creativity and stupidity possible.
In the Traveller iconography I rarely had see more than a few fancy
decoration and the extra tanks of fuel to attain jump-2 with a jump-1 drive.

I think than we can use several changes of paradigm in the space human
presence.

These were the simple guidelines I used:

I figured that there were major stock exchanges at the subsector capitals,
and maybe on planets well-connected to the rest of the Imperium or with
big populations.  Megacorps would be traded on all exchanges, but the
littler companies would only be traded in their primary area of operations.

Electronic "certificates" of shares of stock would be electronically 
recorded and either kept in a local datasystem or "printed" onto a
virtually unforgable portable card for interstellar transport, which
would be standardized by the "Ministry of Finance" (my local version
of a Treasury Dept/SEC for the Imperium, since I don\'t think anyone
ever made one).  

[Adventure possibilities with forgers, of course.  Most would fail,
and get nailed by the Ministry of Justice.]

Travelers could arrange to have their stock traded by a local broker,
and have the changes put on the card, which would indicate a certain
number of valid shares.  You could keep several cards and records, but
the only shares that you could actually trade are the ones you could
get at.  If you were on Aramis, and wanted to sell the 10,000 shares
of Tukera you had on Regina, you\'d have to send registered xmail to
Regina to have your broker issue the sell order.  If you wanted to
sell the 10,000 shares of Oberlindes that you had with on the ship,
you make arrangements with a local broker and can do it now.

Making projections are a pain, and it\'s virtually impossible to know
the current state of a large interstellar firm at any one time.
Sort of like Renaissance Italy -- you just have to wait for the
trade fleet to make it into port, and you can\'t know if a storm
delayed it three weeks out of home.  So it can be a bit risky,
but sector corps and megacorps are fairly safe bets.

The megacorps, especially banking and investment ones like Hortalez
and Zirunkariish probably keep their own courier service.  Even the
little Oberlindes interface-line kept a jump-5 courier net in its\'
main operating area in Regina and Aramis (in Traveller Adventure).
Jump-6 is expensive to maintain, but the megacorps are probably
rich enough to maintain it for limited internal use connecting a
fairly small number of vital hubs.

Well, according to the DGP sector file for Riftspan Reaches and the Trojan
Reach, there was a class-A starport Industrial world with Aslan populations
in the 90 billions on either end of the jump-5 route across the Great Rift.
Neither one was much of a prize as environments went, if I remember right.
The two of them could power a lot of the colonization effort all by their

    'body' => 'Some dark thoughts about psionics and religion:

1) The psionic corollary to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Suppose that the scientific laboratory environment itself is hostile to 
psionic activity.  Maybe all of those scientifically trained brains, 
whose brainwaves are influenced by their rational, cause-and-effect 
oriented training, just damp all the psionic activity.  We know already 
that psionic research in the Imperium only determined what the phenomena 
did, but did not explain the principles involved.  (MT Imperial 
Encyclopedia, p. 34)  

This suggests that the psionics institutes that were like regular labs 
would be the least effective.  Perhaps the most effective psi insts would 
be radically different, not even recognizable as "institutes."  Maybe 
they would be monasteries.

2) The Psionics Suppressions:  Was a Scapegoat Needed in 800?
Imperial intelligence found that the most spinward psi insts were funded 
by the Zhodani (Imp Encyclo p.50), and evidence of scandal was uncovered 
or fabricated (ibid.) in ways designed to turn the public against 
psionics.  The canon doesn\'t indicate any widespread economic dislocation 
or wartime losses that would indicate the need for a scapegoat to take 
the heat of public disapproval off the Emperor, as far as I know.  The 
Solomani Autonomous Region had been established in 704, at the opposite 
side of the Imperium from the most dangerous psi insts.  Were people 
blaming the Emperor for "losing the Solomani Rim"?

3) Suppressions:  Were the Institutes Too Independent?
Suppose that the psi insts were non-scientific, low-tech organizations 
that increased the power of individuals in ways that they could opt out 
of the corporatized Imperium.  The institutes would then be a threat to 
the hegemony of the non-psionic, scientific and technological elite that 
rules the Imperium, because the possibility that people could get off the 
treadmill, or have power beyond that provided by technology, would be 
seen as destabilizing.  So the psi insts were demonized as corrupt, 
retrogressive, subversive, Zhodani-controlled, secretive organizations, 
determined to make you do dirty things with your mind.  This has turned 
public opinion solidly against the institutes ever since (of course, the 
Vilani members of society already had a long standing prejudice against 
psionics (Vilani & Vargr, p. 37)).

4) The Psionic Suppressions as the Pogroms of the Imperium
So if the most effective institutes were the least like laboratories, and 
maybe were like places where psionic activity has traditionally taken 
place on earth (Tibetan monasteries come to mind, but so do Jewish 
Kabals), then the suppressions, which were impliedly quite violent, were 
organized and spontaneous attacks on a resident, probably religious, 
minority -- in plain Galinglis, a pogrom; in corporate/military speak, an 
ethnic cleansing.

I\'m not sure where I\'m going with this (my Imperium isn\'t particularly 
anti-religious, but it does try to keep disruptive religions from 
developing and becomimg problematic), but I thought I\'d share these 
thoughts, and solicit whatever comments you have.

 Ethan asked: Who lives in space?
 In my own campaign there are "races" of people
who primarily live in space. I put "race" in quotes
because it becomes hard to differentiate a race from
a culture. Some share a culture because they all do
common jobs in common conditions. Some share a gene
pool for similar reasons. Lets look at each.
 Traders. Known racially as "macarim". These are
the owners and operators of the various sall to middling
trade concerns and space ships. [Sort of a bastrardised
cross between Hobbits and Medieval Jews.] They tend to
be distinct both socailly and (consequently?) genetically.
The best merchant crew is one born and raised to it
so they perpetuate their place. They are quite clannish
as who you know is very important in their business.
They almost always have a "cousin" who can get what you
need.
 Many of them never set foot on a planet. Most
would never want to. Stations are stopovers and
sources of income. Compare them with the people who
run canal barges in the Low Countries of Europe.
 Belters. This just doesn\'t cover asertoid miners
but basically most of the space-based industrial
raw material culture. They are pretty much limited to
their own selves for socialisation and, again, thus
become self-perpetuating. Take modern oil-rig workers
and take it to the logical conclusion.
 Navy. This is a polyglot culture. Although Navy
brats tend to become Navy recruits their cultural values
tend to driver them more towards recruitment and adsorbtion
rather than self reproduction. Since a recruit may almost
never see their homeworld again (or, at best, infrequently)
they are embraced and absorbed within the Navy "culture"
as a point to focus on. Later it becomes their primary
cultural identity.
 Scouts. This is both like, and unlike, the Navy.
Although rather promiscuous and prolific, Scout children
don\'t often become Scouts. The Scouts rush to embrace and
support any cultural quirk that anyone has. This, in itself,
become their defining "culture". Their over-tolerance
of all cultures and their attempts to personally "get into"
each makes them what they are.

 In addition to their own "cultures" each of the
above also has their own language or dialect of standard.
This arises naturally from a need to adsorb people from
all different linguistic backgrounds and also from the
derivation of profession specific words, etc.

refueling.  I have a few preliminary ideas below,
							any comments?

The basic system has refined and unrefined fuel for sale at Starports, 
and of course fuel skimming.

The DMs given in Book 2 give a negative DM for jumps and malfunctions if
	"Using unrefined fuel and not equiped to do so"

(Missjumps - (on 13+) if navy vessel +1, if Scout +2)

Refinement
----
This is basically a very simple process,
	Break up the gas molecules (H20, CH4, NH3 etc) into ions, 
	than pass them through a basic mass-spectrometer to select 
	off the light elements you want.

	BTW. Using CH4 for each ton of H fuel you generate 6 tons
	of carbon.  Is there a market for this waste product!

Fuel constituents
----
I take refined fuel to be a suitable mix of hydrogen, deuterium, tritium.
AND helium-3.

Fussion of deuterium and tritium. produces a copious amount of high 
energy neutrons, quite a hazzard and shielding problem.  By including 
helium-3 in the fuel mix it reacts with deuterium, to give helium-4 and 
protons.

As long ago as the seventies the British Interplanetary Society proposed 
gas mining on Jupiter for helium-3 as a fussion fuel source.

	This is why Gas Giant refulling is so important.

Ship Drives
----
Basically I have two types of drive, those capable of using unrefined 
fuel, andthose that cannot.

Ships with refined fuel drives, may have fuel purification plants on 
board, but they still burn Refined fuel.

Ships like my Type-S have a form of multi-fuel drive.  They don\'t bother 
refining fuel, just shove the gas raw into the fussion chamber. 
(you\'d still get fussion reactions from the hydrogen, but also possibly 
from the heavier elements- O,C,N etc)

Malfunctions
----
Malfunctions due to unrefined fuel, could be from deposits of heavier 
elements clogging fuel injectors, or even fast-neutron dammage to the 
drive metal itself.

    'body' => 'Has anyone noticed the glaring fault in the book 2 designs?

If you put a type A power plant into a Type-S it uses 20tons of fuel,
in a Type-A Free Trader the same plant uses just 10tons!
(also compare these with High Guard useage)

I like using Book2 designs rather than the custom jobs of High Guard so I 
wanted to retain them, but a little more sensibly.  

The fuel use table below gives the fuel tankage required for each type of
drive.  In some cases this is more efficient than High Guard, in others
less so.  I will confess to a little bias, I like small ships so the jump
fuel table is very efficient at the lower end for the first few drives.

The actual consumption is as follows...
  Jumps use the fraction of the fuel as the fraction of the jump to
        the jump rating of the starship.

  Power Plants use fuel as follows, 0.007 tons per day,  
        (0.05 tons per week) for each drive letter.

        Book 2 power plants produce an actual output of 1ep per ton of
        fuel tankage required.
        (The power plant rating number reprisents the power density of
        the starship,  ep\'s per 100 tons) 
        (see High Guard for the ep-fuel conversion (1ep=250MW))

  Manoeuver fuel used in manoeuvering is used at the rate of 
        0.002tons/hour per G per 100tons.
        (0.05tons/day or 0.35tons/week)

This changes the basic starship designs;

The Type-S Scout has the following changes...

    1.  Fuel capacity is now 33 tons (two jumps plus 4 weeks) 
    2.  Cargo capacity is now 6 tons

  The effect of the changes means that the Scout has a little more cargo
capacity, but the main change is the range.  The Scout can now perform two
jumps at maximun range, this has two advantages

    1.  The Scout can now traverse the X-Boat route, albeit at half the
       speed of an X-Boat 
    2.  The Scout can make a return trip of jump-2 in range without
       refueling.

  These two effects are compatable with the Scouts role as part of the
X-Boat service and as an exploration craft.  In fact they make the
Scout more viable in these roles.

The Type-A Free Traider changes as follows...

    1.  Fuel capacity is now 18 tons
    2.  It now carries an Air-Raft
    3.  It now has a cargo capacity of 90 tons.
       The original 82 tons hold, and a`Special Cargo Area\' of 8 tons
       attached to the main hold.

  These changes make the Type-A compatable with that portrayed in the
`Starship Operators Manual\'.  The increse in cargo capacity (8 tons) is the
size of the "Special Cargo Area" on the upper cargo deck.  See the plans in
the `Starship Operators Manual\'.

(complete speculation) Two words: Hivers. Oh yes, you thought they were
cute little starfish who didn\'t know when you had bad B.O., but they\'re
actually quite smart.

The hivers created most of the evidence used by unwitting Imperial agents
in the supressions and dismantling of the psionic institutes in Imperial
space. While many institutes were partly funded by Zhodani agents, many
were run by independent Imperials. Evidence was fabricated and much of it
was distorted truth - one Zhodani visit becase heavy Zhodani funding, etc.

Why?

Increased acceptance of psionics by Imperial citizens would lead eventually
to a larger number of Zhodani/Imperial client states on the borders, leading
eventually to Imperial worlds voluntarily joining the Consulate and
embracing its philosophies.

Zhodani political and social culture has proved itself to be the most
successful model of human society ever and a large influx of willing
Imperials into it would mean increased human stability for centuries
to come.

On the other hand, if the Imperium were to remain intact, its social
structure would collapse under the pressure of its size, in the same
way that all previous Imperia (??) had already given way.

SO - if the Imperials could be made to reject the most basic tenent of
Zhodani culture, what would happen?

Warfare along the Zhodani/Imperial border, stressing the Imperium and
internal Imperial stresses exaggerated by increasing acceptance of Zhodani
culture, resulting in the eventual collapse of the Imperium.

Looks like they got it right.

Why would the Hivers want the Imperium to collapse?

Continued Imperial military activity along the Solmani border is dangerous
to the Hivers, as it comes very close to their border.

Continued Imperial expansion along all borders represents a danger to
the Hivers, as they cannot hope to prevent increased Imperial control
of worlds along their border, either through settlement, economic
means or warfare.

Not to mention the opportunities that would be created by a full-scale
interstellar war. The Hivers sell a lot of high-tech equipment which would
be hard to come by in those, pardon the expression, Hard Times.

That\'s my take on it. The Hivers were scared of the eventual Imperial/
Zhodani cultural merging, which would have signed the papers for human
domination of that part of the galaxy. I mean, can you blame them?

Easy - after over a thousand years of relatively slow, stable growth,
they have it all worked out. Just plug in a few numbers here and there,
look at the case studies, consult a thousand years of records et voila,
you have a risk assessment.

Remember - we are now doing things that no human in history has ever
done - some of thesew things have never even been dreamed of (eg.
spray cheese in a can). But over two thousand years from now, given
a very similar culture and business environment, many things would have 
been done a lot more, like setting up a company.

Oh, that, and it\'s all a hiver plot.

This didn\'t come out right. What I meant was:

a) Warfare along the Zho/Imp border, stressing the Imperium and
b) internal Imperial stresses that would have been soothed by gradual
    acceptance of Zhodani philosophies would now be exaggerated
c) resulting in the eventual collapse of the Imperium.

But I\'m sure you got my drift.

To elaborate my point let\'s look at Hiver border and Imperial borders
and where the Imperium and Hivers have a position for expansion - be it
by conqureing worlds, absorbing populated worlds or economic expansion
(increased trade).

Hivers:

Hiver/K\'kree - the Hivers dealt with this one a while ago. The K\'kree
now have a heavy dislike of any dealings with the Hivers. Neither side
wants to touch this border.

Hiver/Solomani - This is basically the same as the Imperium as far as
the Hivers are concerned. The solomani look at this border as a place for
expansion, as do the Hivers, to a lesser degree.
For the Hivers, this border needs to be dealt with somehow.
The best way is by being friendly and making the Solomani look elsewhere
for military targets and general expansion - preferably the Imperium.
The Hivers are content here to settle for economic expansion.

Imperials: (lots)

Imperial/Solomani - volatile border. Must keep patrolled with a heavy
military presence. Most planets in this region are already settled
and none would willingly join the Imperium. No chance for expansion
by either side without major war.

Imperial/Aslan - the main problem here is those damn Ihatei constantly
trucking across the voids and claiming land on Impy planets or claiming
whole planets. War would be unplesant for both sides. The void make it
difficult to expand in this region.

Imperial/Vargr - not a real border per se, but Vargr raiders are a 
pain in the ass along Corridor. A heavy military presence must be
kept to keep Corridor safe for Imperial traffic. The combination of the
void here and excessive Vargr corsairs make this region undesirable
for expansion.

Imperial/K\'kree - no real border here, as there is a large client state
buffer area. The K\'kree have good technology, but due to the massive size 
of their ships, pose a low military threat to the Imperium (by tonnage,
Imperial ships heavily outgun K\'kree ships.) Expansion in this area is 
difficult, due to mixed K\'kree and human influences.

Imperial/Zhodani - the Zhodani would just as well leave this alone, but
Imperial expansion along this border is a problem. The Imperials have a
dislike of Zhodani culture, as well as a general acceptance of killing other 
humans, so find this battle an easy one to justify.
If the psionic supressions had not happened, this border would be quite
the opposite - a place where the best parts of Zhodani and Imperial culture
might have mixed, creating a stable region of new Zhodani worlds, 
independent client states and Imperial worlds friendly to the Zhodani.
This would help relieve the military pressure in this area, allowing
more fleets to deal with the Vargr and Aslan borders.

Finally,

Imperial/Hiver - the Hivers have a history of disliking war. The Imperials
have a history of liking war and being damn good at it. The Imperials
also have a massive military that any minor technological advantage by
the Hivers can not offset. There are some client states in this area as
well, but absorbing them would give the Imperials even more border with
the Solomani, giving the Imperials a better tactical position. (This is
debatable I think, but, what the heck). Also, the Imperium would like to 
have many parts of Hiver technology without having to buy it.

SO:

If there was peace along the Imp/Zho border, making the Marches and Corridor
less of a headache, the Imperium would be looking long and hard at taking
control of a fair chunk of Hiver space.

If there was friction along the Imp/Zho border, intermittent wars would cause
enough trouble in the Imperium to eventually drag it down into the pits.
Ignoring the Hivers the entire time, of course, except for all the supplies
and technology the Hivers would sell to the them.

QED.

(I wasn\'t satisfied with having an entire xboat digest to myself - I had to
come
back for more. You may think this sounds like a wacky conspiracy theory,
but I have grainy 8mm film footage of Strephon being shot. Dulinor shot
everyone
EXCEPT Strephon and was going to force him to hand the throne over,
but on a grassy knoll just off to the side, the Hiver ambassador pulled out
a high powered rifle and shot Strephon, ruining Dulinor\'s plans. To quote
Dulinor - "I\'m just a patsy.")

    'body' => 'Yo Folkes,
      A question came up last night during Paranoia:
"How much would a grav-skateboard be?" After thinking
for a moment I decided that the MegaTraveller "vehicle"
generation should be able to handle this...
      We decied not to let price be a question and
first used TL12 grav. The minimum size for a grav
drive yielded 200 kg of thrust. This is *more* than
adequate for a grav-skateboard. (Unless it is for
a K\'Kree or something :-) Batteries were the best
option for power and the "hull" could be "open topped"
and armour-1 (fibreglass?). In the end our "vehicle"
came out as:
      Vol: 4ltr, Wt: 3.1kg, Thrust: 200kg,
      Duration: 1 hour, Cost: 30854Cr.
This was nice, but expensive. So next I tried using
the cheapest grav (TL 9). The minimum size here
resulted in 1000kg of thrust, a bit high, but
allowed for (K\'Kree users and) possible conversion
by a hobbiest into a grav-go-cart. It was also
a bit heavy and rather large. The result was
a quarter the price, though.
      The mid-range grav (TL10) was a bit slimmer,
a bit trimmer, and in the middle cost-wize. Here
is a summary table:

Grav Skateboard:
TL  Vol   Wt   Thrust Duration Price
9   40ltr 68kg 1000kg 7.6min    8,532Cr
10  30ltr 26kg  400kg 1 hour   15,280Cr
12   4ltr  3kg  200kg 1 hour   30,854Cr

 The way the pricing doubles every increment
makes for a good upgrade path for the hobbiest.
If you take 1Cr=1$ it is still reservedn for the
rather well off but if you take 10Cr=1Pound, as
I do, it become achievable to many more. (Just look
at how much one of those more advanced radio
controled planes or cars is!)
 At the lower exchange rate grav-skateboard
parks are supportable as well as clubs and
league events.

 Another alternative: I allow another type
of "thrust suspension" that doesn\'t work off
a grav drive, but rather reacts to an artificial
gravity field. Basically it distorts the field
to provide "thrust" or whatever. I assume
cargo palettes work this way as well as mobile
cargo winches (which you can anchor in thin air :-).
Of course all these are useless on a ship without
artifical gravity or a planet. (The characters had
an "anchor" built into the hilt of one of her
swords, "just in case".)
 I\'ve never thought about stats for how to
construct "vehicles" with these gizmos but if I
do, I can post it. (Unless someone else beats me
to it.

 Another idea I\'ve never had time to play
around with is something out of MERP. At the
begining of <something> Law there are tables
given for producing items that are smaller,
lighter, or stronger than normal. So if you
wanted something, say, 20% lighter you could
pay twice the cost for it. I think 100-95%
smaller was 1000x the cost.
 What effect would this have on vehicles
if this were applied to the MegaTraveller
design system? (I can find and post the table.)
 Rob Dean, you\'ve designed a lot of vehicles.
What sort of components would be worth making
smaller/lighters dispite a possible increase
in cost?
 Steve Higginbotham, you\'ve worked with
TCS a lot. How might this apply there and
what sort of effect do you predict?

 Lastly, the skateboard nonsense lead me
thinking. If a modern container is 8x8x20/40
that\'s just a 36.25/72.5 kl hull. I might play
with the design system and design some modern
containers.
 Strikes me if there is a standard container
size there will be all sorts of "extra modules"
you can plug into your cargo hold. E.g. a
"passenger module" that allows you to take on
an extra passenger, ...

    I allowed this kind of thing as a research item in the Islands game.
There were only two items researched - M-drives and computers.  And
smaller computers aren\'t really relevant to MT.
    There are really only two starship components in MT that are worth
paying for to get smaller items: power plants and M-drives.  Both are
a large part of any warship (usually the largest two pieces other than
the fuel supply), and they collectively provide a large part of the 
limiting factors for weaponry on warships.
    It is also possible that a smaller spinal mount weapon would be
desirable.  I tend to think not - most ships carrying spinal mounts
are large enough to have room to spare.

    What I would really expect to see is more and better fighters at
lower TLs.  By TL15, you don\'t really need the extra room, but the
lower TL fighters (TL12-14) would become a lot more competitive if
extra money could go toward fitting more hardware into a fighter-sized
hull.
    These "better" ships from TL12-14 would apply for all ship sizes
that could be imagined, but it isn\'t too likely that it would be worth 
the loss of tonnage implied by raising individual prices significantly.
Note that TL12-14 ships already cost more than a similarly sized TL15
ship.  Quite a lot more.  So a TL13 world will already have a smaller
Fleet than a comparable TL15 world.  Making that worse would not be a
terribly bright idea, given the relatively small gains to be made by
the trade-off.
    Note, btw, that allowing smaller components (in exchange for more
credits) will encourage higher ships with about one higher jump number
than "normal" for a given TL...

    A more militarily significant change would be to allow the manufacture
of better computers at lower TLs in exchange for extra tonnage and LOTS
of extra money.  That would be significant enough that everyone who wanted
to be competitive in the Great Game would buy into it to the extent that
the budget would allow...

Ok, betrayal of ignorance time.  I have to admit that I don\'t dig

Mush sounds like something my mother used to spoon-feed me when I was

What?  <sounds of someone waking up slowly>

What would be worth making smaller? Hmm...an interesting question.  Few of
the vehilces that I did were particularly limited by volume, although the
minimum grav unit sizes were also a problem in my grav bike designs.  I\'d
have to think about that one for a while.  By the way--I wouldn\'t design a
skateboard as an open topped vehicle--there is a little clause in the rules
about riding _on_ (rather than _in_) tiny vehicles.

Vehicle design rules should cover containers without straining, and I\'ve
generally assumed that the sort of modules you cite are readily available.
I haven\'t designed any, but certainly would/could if a player needed one
for something. Of course, I have no active campaign at the moment, which
has been reducing my interest.  It\'s been so long since I did a vehicle that
I was struggling a couple of weeks ago when I picked up the Ref\'s Manual
and _attempted_ one. )-:

**ACLU CYBER-LIBERTIES ALERT** 
 
FIGHT ONLINE CENSORSHIP! 
 
AXE THE EXON BILL! 
 
The American Civil Liberties Union urges you to contact the members of the
U.S. Senate Commerce Committee and your own Senators to ask them to oppose
the efforts to turn online communications into the most heavily censored
form of American media. 
 
In a clumsy effort to purge sexual expression from the Internet and other
online networks, the self-described "Communications Decency Act of 1995"
(S.314, introduced by Senator Exon on 2/2/95) would make ALL
telecommunications service providers liable for every message, file, or
other content carried on their networks.  Senator Exon is planning to
attach the bill to Senator Pressler\'s new telecommunications legislation,
which is targeted for action in early March. 
 
The Exon proposal would severely restrict the flow of online information by
requiring service providers to act as private censors of e-mail messages,
public forums, mailing lists, and archives to avoid criminal liability. 
The ACLU believes that online users should be the only censors of the
content of the information they receive. 
 
**The Exon proposal broadens existing law by subjecting service providers,
as well as the individuals who actually send messages, to criminal
liability for any "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" message
transmitted over their networks.** 
 
If enacted into law, this vague and overly broad legislation could have the
following draconian effects: 
 
 * The Exon proposal would prohibit communications with sexual content
through private e-mail between consenting adults, and would inhibit people
from making comments that might or might not be prohibited. 
 
 * Under the Exon proposal, service providers would pay up to $100,000 or
spend up to 2 years in jail for prohibited content produced by subscribers
on other networks, over which they had no control. 
 
 * The Exon proposal would expand current restrictions on telephone access
by minors to dial-a-porn services to include online access to indecent
material, requiring service providers to purge "indecent" material from
public bulletin boards and discussion groups to avoid accidental viewing by
a minor. 
 
In effect, online providers would be forced to offer to adults only that
content that is "suitable for minors." 
 
 
S. 314 is nearly identical to an amendment Senator Exon successfully
attached to last year\'s Senate version of the telecommunications law
overhaul.  Last year\'s bill died for unrelated reasons, but the Senate
Commerce Committee is determined to pass new telecommunications legislation
this year that could easily include the Exon proposal. 
 
The ACLU opposes the restrictions on speech imposed by this legislation
because they violate the First Amendment\'s guarantee of free expression. 
Forcing carriers to pre-screen content violates the Constitution and
threatens the free and robust expression that is the promise of the Net. 
The Constitution requires that any abridgement of speech use the least
restrictive means available -- the language of the Exon proposal is clearly
the most restrictive because it sweeps broadly against a wide array of
protected material involving sexual expression. 
 
Stop the information superhighway from becoming the most censored segment
of communications media! 
 
ACT NOW: 
 
Urge members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation: 
 
 *To oppose the Exon proposal, or any Senate or House variation. 
 
 *To drop the Exon proposal BEFORE it goes to the Senate floor.  
 
 *To hold full hearings on the Exon proposal and to review it thoroughly
before it goes to the Senate floor. 
 
 *To reject any effort to attach the Exon proposal to the Senate
telecommunications legislation.

SAMPLE LETTER 
 
Dear Senator _______: 
 
I am writing to urge you to oppose the restrictions on speech that would be
imposed by the legislation introduced by Senator Exon, known as the
Communications Decency Act of 1995,  S.314, introduced on 2/2/95.  The Exon
proposal would severely restrict the flow of online information by
requiring service providers to act as private censors of e-mail messages,
public forums, mailing lists, and archives to avoid criminal liability. I
believe that online users should be the only censors of the content of the
messages they receive. 
 
I urge you to: 
 
 *Oppose the Exon proposal, or any Senate or House variation. 
 
 *Drop the Exon proposal BEFORE it goes to the Senate floor.  
 
 *Hold full hearings on the Exon proposal and review it thoroughly before
it goes to the Senate floor. 
 
 *Reject any effort to attach the Exon proposal to the Senate
telecommunications legislation. 
 
Sincerely,

*** PROTECT THE INTERNET. READ THIS MESSAGE ***

This document is an electronic Petition Statement to the
U.S. Congress regarding pending legislation, the
"Communications Decency Act of 1995" (S. 314) which will
have, if passed, very serious negative ramifications for
freedom of expression on Usenet, the Internet, and all
electronic networks.  The proposed legislation would remove
guarantees of privacy and free speech on all electronic
networks, including the Internet, and may even effectively
close them down as a medium to exchange ideas and
information.

For an excellent analysis of this Bill by the Center for
Democracy and Technology (CDT), refer to the Appendix
attached at the end of this document.  The text to S. 314
is also included in this Appendix.

This document is somewhat long, but the length is necessary
to give you sufficient information to make an informed
decision.  Time is of the essence, we are going to turn
this petition and the signatures in on 3/16/95, so if you
are going to sign this please do so ASAP or at least before
midnight Wednesday, March 15, 1995.

Even if you read this petition after the due date, please
submit your signature anyway as we expect Congress to
continue debating these issues in the foreseeable future
and the more signatures we get, the more influence the
petition will have on discussion.  And even if Congress
rejects S. 314 while signatures are being gathered, do
submit your signature anyway for the same reason.

Please do upload this petition statement as soon as
possible to any BBS and on-line service in your area.
If you have access to one of the major national on-line
services such as CompuServe, Prodigy, AOL, etc., do try
to upload it there.  We are trying to get at least 5000
signatures.  Even more signatures are entirely possible
if we each put in a little effort to inform others, such
as friends and coworkers, about the importance of this
petition to electronic freedom of expression.

Here is a brief table of contents:

(Appendix) Analysis and text of S. 314 (LONG but excellent)


******(2) The Petition Statement

In united voice, we sign this petition against passage of S. 314 (the
"Communications Decency Act of 1995") for these reasons:

S. 314 would prohibit not only individual speech that is "obscene, lewd,
lascivious, filthy, or indecent", but would prohibit any provider of
telecommunications service from carrying such traffic, under threat of
stiff penalty.  Even aside from the implications for free speech, this
would cause an undue - and unjust - burden upon operators of the various
telecommunications services.  In a time when the citizenry and their
lawmakers alike are calling for and passing "no unfunded mandates" laws
to the benefit of the states, it is unfortunate that Congress might seek to
impose unfunded mandates upon businesses that provide the framework for
the information age.

An additional and important consideration is the technical feasibility of
requiring the sort of monitoring this bill would necessitate.  The
financial burden in and of itself - in either manpower or technology to
handle such monitoring (if even legal under the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act) - would likely cause many smaller providers to go out of
business, and most larger providers to seriously curtail their services.

The threat of such penalty alone would result in a chilling effect in the
telecommunications service community, not only restricting the types of
speech expressly forbidden by the bill, but creating an environment
contrary to the Constitutional principles of free speech, press, and
assembly - principles which entities such as the Internet embody as
nothing has before.

By comparison, placing the burden for content control upon each individual
user is surprisingly simple in the online and interactive world, and there
is no legitimate reason to shift that burden to providers who carry that
content.  Unlike traditional broadcast media, networked media is
comparatively easy to screen on the user end - giving the reader, viewer,
or participant unparalleled control over his or her own information
environment.  All without impacting or restricting what any other user
wishes to access.  This makes regulation such as that threatened by this
S. 314 simply unnecessary.

In addition, during a period of ever-increasing commercial interest in
arenas such as the Internet, restriction and regulation of content or the
flow of traffic across the various telecommunications services would have
serious negative economic effects.  The sort of regulation proposed by this
bill would slow the explosive growth the Internet has seen, giving the
business community reason to doubt the medium\'s commercial appeal.


We ask that the Senate halt any further progress of this bill.  We ask
that the Senate be an example to Congress as a whole, and to the nation
at large - to promote the general welfare as stated in the Preamble to
the Constitution by protecting the free flow of information and ideas
across all of our telecommunications services.

          ======================================
          Instructions for Signing This Petition
          ======================================

It must first be noted that this is a petition, not a
vote.  By "signing" it you agree with *all* the requests
made in the petition.  If you do not agree with everything
in this petition, then your only recourse is to not sign
it.

In addition, all e-mail signatures will be submitted to
Congress, the President of the United States, and the
news media.

Including your full name is optional, but *very highly
encouraged* as that would add to the effectiveness of the
petition.  Signing via an anonymous remailer is highly
discouraged, but not forbidden, as an attempt will be made
to separately tally signatures from anonymous remailers.

Because this is a Petition to the U.S. Congress, we ask
that you state, as instructed below, whether or not you
are a U.S. citizen.  We do encourage non-U.S. citizens to
sign, but their signatures will be tallied separately.

Signing this petition is not hard, but to make sure your
signature is not lost or miscounted, please follow these
directions EXACTLY:

1) Prepare an e-mail message.  In the main body (NOT the
Subject line) of your e-mail include the ONE-LINE statement:

SIGNED <Internet e-mail address> <Full name> <US Citizen>

You need not include the "<" and ">" characters. \'SIGNED\'
should be capitalized.  As stated above, your full name is
optional, but highly recommended.  If you do supply your
name, please don\'t use a pseudonym or nickname, or your
first name -- it\'s better to just leave it blank if it\'s
not your full and real name.  If you are a U.S. citizen,
please include at the end of the signature line a \'YES\',
and if you are not, a \'NO\'.  All signatures will be
tallied whether or not you are a U.S. Citizen

CDT POLICY POST 2/9/95

SENATOR EXON INTRODUCES ONLINE INDECENCY LEGISLATION

A.  OVERVIEW

Senators Exon (D-NE) and Senator Gorton (R-WA) have
introduced legislation to expand current FCC regulations
on obscene and indecent audiotext to cover *all* content
carried over all forms of electronic communications
networks.  If enacted, the "Communications Decency Act of
1995" (S. 314) would place substantial criminal liability
on telecommunications service providers (including
telephone networks, commercial online services, the
Internet, and independent BBS\'s) if their network is used
in the transmission of any indecent, lewd, threatening or
harassing messages.  The legislation is identical to a
proposal offered by Senator Exon last year which failed
along with the Senate Telecommunications reform bill (S.
1822, 103rd Congress, Sections 801 - 804). The text the
proposed statute, with proposed amendment, is appended at
the end of this document.

The bill would compel service providers to chose between
severely restricting the activities of their subscribers
or completely shutting down their email, Internet access,
and conferencing services under the threat of criminal
liability.  Moreover, service providers would be forced to
closely monitor every private communication, electronic
mail message, public forum, mailing list, and file archive
carried by or available on their network, a proposition
which poses a substantial threat to the freedom of speech
and privacy rights of all American citizens.

S. 314, if enacted, would represent a tremendous step
backwards on the path to a free and open National
Information Infrastructure.  The bill raises fundamental
questions about the ability of government to control
content on communications networks, as well as the locus
of liability for content carried in these new
communications media.

To address this threat to the First Amendment in digital
media, CDT is working to organize a broad coalition of
public interest organizations including the ACLU, People
For the American Way, and Media Access Project, along with
representatives from the telecommunications, online
services, and computer industries to oppose S. 314 and to
explore alternative policy solutions that preserve the
free flow of information and freedom of speech in the
online world.  CDT believes that technological
alternatives which allow individual subscribers to control
the content they receive represent a more appropriate
approach to this issue.

B.  SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF S. 314

S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and
harassment on telephone services to all telecommunications
providers and expand criminal liability to *all* content
carried by *all* forms of telecommunications networks.
The bill would amend Section 223 of the Communications Act
(47 U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take steps to
prevent minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext
and criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate
telephone lines.  This section, commonly known as the
Helms Amendment (having been championed by Senator Jesse
Helms), has been the subject of extended Constitutional
litigation in recent years.

* CARRIERS LIABLE FOR CONDUCT OF ALL USERS ON THEIR
  NETWORKS

S. 314 would make telecommunication carriers (including
telephone companies, commercial online services, the
Internet, and BBS\'s) liable for every message, file, or
other content carried on its network -- including the
private conversations or messages exchanged between two
consenting individuals.

Under S. 314, anyone who "makes, transmits, or otherwise
makes available any comment, request, suggestion,
proposal, image, or other communication" which is
"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" using a
"telecommunications device" would be subject to a fine of
$100,000 or two years in prison (Section (2)(a)).

In order to avoid liability under this provision, carriers
would be forced to pre-screen all messages, files, or
other content before transmitting it to the intended
recipient.  Carriers would also be forced to prevent or
severely restrict their subscribers from communicating
with individuals and accessing content available on other
networks.

Electronic communications networks do not contain discrete
boundaries.  Instead, users of one service can easily
communicate with and access content available on other
networks.  Placing the onus, and criminal liability, on
the carrier as opposed to the originator of the content,
would make the carrier legally responsible not only for
the conduct of its own subscribers, but also for content
generated by subscribers of other services.

This regulatory scheme clearly poses serious threats to
the free flow of information throughout the online world
and the free speech and privacy rights of individual
users.  Forcing carriers to pre-screen content would not
only be impossible due to the sheer volume of messages, it
would also violate current legal protections.

* CARRIERS REQUIRED TO ACT AS PRIVATE CENSOR OF ALL
  PUBLIC FORUMS AND ARCHIVES

S. 314 would also expand current restrictions on access to
indecent telephone audiotext services by minors under the
age of 18 to cover similar content carried by
telecommunications services (such as America Online and
the Internet).  (Sec (a)(4)).

As amended by this provision, anyone who, "by means of
telephone or telecommunications device, makes, transmits,
or otherwise makes available (directly or by recording
device) any indecent communication for commercial purposes
which is available to any person under the age of 18 years
of age or to any other person without that person\'s
consent, regardless of whether the maker of such
communication placed the call or initiated the
communication" would be subject of a fine of $100,000 or
two years in prison.

This would force carries to act as private censors of all
content available in public forums or file archives on
their networks.  Moreover, because there is no clear
definition of indecency, carriers would have to restrict
access to any content that could be possibly construed as
indecent or obscene under the broadest interpretation of
the term. Public forums, discussion lists, file archives,
and content available for commercial purposes would have
to be meticulously screened and censored in order to avoid
potential liability for the carrier.

Such a scenario would severely limit the diversity of
content available on online networks, and limit the
editorial freedom of independent forum operators.

ADDITIONAL NOTABLE PROVISIONS

* AMENDMENT TO ECPA

Section (6) of the bill would amend the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act (18 USC 2511) to prevent the
unauthorized interception and disclosure of "digital
communications" (Sec. 6).  However, because the term
"digital communication" is not defined and 18 USC 2511
currently prevents unauthorized interception and
disclosure of "electronic communications" (which includes
electronic mail and other forms of communications in
digital form), the effect of this provision has no clear
importance.

* CABLE OPERATORS MAY REFUSE INDECENT PUBLIC ACCESS
  PROGRAMMING

Finally, section (8) would amend sections 611 and 612 of
the Communications Act (47 USC 611 - 612) to allow any
cable operator to refuse to carry any public access or
leased access programming which contains "obscenity,
indecency, or nudity".

C.  ALTERNATIVES TO EXON: RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE USER
    CONTROL CAPABILITIES OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA

Government regulation of content in the mass media has
always been considered essential to protect children from
access to sexually-explicit material, and to prevent
unwitting listeners/views from being exposed to material
that might be considered extremely distasteful.  The
choice to protect children has historically been made at
the expense of the First Amendment ban on government
censorship.  As Congress moves to regulate new interactive
media, it is essential that it understand that interactive
media is different than mass media.  The power and
flexibility of interactive media offers a unique
opportunity to enable parents to control what content
their kids have access to, and leave the flow of
information free for those adults who want it.  Government
control regulation is simply not needed to achieve the
desired purpose.

Most interactive technology, such as Internet browsers and
the software used to access online services such as
America Online and Compuserve, already has the capability
to limit access to certain types of services and selected
information.  Moreover, the electronic program guides
being developed for interactive cable TV networks also
provide users the capability to screen out certain
channels or ever certain types of programming.  Moreover,
in the online world, most content (with the exception of
private communications initiated by consenting
individuals) is transmitted by request.  In other words,
users must seek out the content they receive, whether it
is by joining a discussion or accessing a file archive.
By its nature, this technology provides ample control at
the user level.  Carriers (such as commercial online
services, Internet service providers) in most cases act
only as "carriers" of electronic transmissions initiated
by individual subscribers.

CDT believes that the First Amendment will be better
served by giving parents and other users the tools to
select which information they (and their children) should
have access to.  In the case of criminal content the
originator of the content, not the carriers, should be
responsible for their crimes.  And, users (especially
parents) should be empowered to determine what information
they and their children have access to.  If all carriers
of electronic communications are forced restrict content
in order to avoid criminal liability proposed by S. 314,
the First Amendment would be threatened and the usefulness
of digital media for communications and information
dissemination would be drastically limited.

D.  NEXT STEPS

The bill has been introduced and will next move to the
Senate Commerce Committee, although no Committee action
has been scheduled.  Last year, a similar proposal by
Senator Exon was approved by the Senate Commerce committee
as an amendment to the Senate Telecommunications Bill (S.
1822, which died at the end of the 103rd Congress).  CDT
will be working with a wide range of other interest groups
to assure that Congress does not restrict the free flow of
information in interactive media.

Well, I\'m not sure that *none* would, but the member-states that direct
Confederate policy might not be too pleased with Imperial interference.

Theoretically, the ihatei would be violating the Peace of Ftahalr by
doing this, and this would hurt the honor of the Tlaukhu signatories
and the Imperium...not bright on the ihatei\'s parts.  The main reason
it happened during the Rebellion was because of legal questions about
whether the Peace was still in force.  (Is there an Imperium?)

Ok, but....

I disagree.  The First and Second Frontier Wars weren\'t about psionics,
but about the Imperial settlements in Foreven and in the Marches.  The
Zhodani wanted to reserve space to expand to rimward, and it was looking
like the Imperium was going to swarm into Foreven first, and much more
rapidly than the Zhodani would care to.  The suggestions in the Library
Data that the Zhodani were involved with the Institutes make a heck of
a lot of sense -- it\'s a natural pairing.  The suggestion that the 
Suppressions delayed the Third Frontier War from 799 to the 970s is
enough conspiracy for me.  Besides, the bobbled mass psychohistorical
manipulation of the Imperial population isn\'t *elegant* enough for a
Hiver.

Admittedly, the Zhodani and Imperials were co-colonizing worlds before
the 1FW, but the conflicts between the expansionistic Imperials and
the Zhos weren\'t being settled amicably.  That doesn\'t mean that this
might not change, say in TNE.

Why?  The Federation is probably the closest thing to a large, coherent,
interstellar ally that the Imperium has.  Neither one gets on too well
with the Solomani, who are the biggest problem for everyone in the area.
They apparently do some long-range trade with each other, too.  It would
make more sense to me that if the Imperium had that kind of strength, 
and the will to fight, that they\'d try to reintegrate the rest of the
Solomani Sphere long before attacking the Hiver Federation.  They\'re
the bigger threat in any case.

Hiver influence on the strongly anti-Solomani Party worlds of the RC
in TNE is fairly evident though; think in terms of the Hiver parental
instinct.  The RC are the yearlings back from the wilderness, which
should be adopted and raised by the community, the TEDs in the wilds
are minor pests, to be exterminated if necessary...just like Hiver 
young.  Wonder if they\'re taking Hiver philosophy as part of the tech
curriculum?

MUSH == Multi-User Shared Hallucination
MOO == MUD, Object-Oriented

Members of a family of online interactive games which includes MUDs,
MUCKs, and many more-or-less related things.  Basically, a way of doing
real-time roleplaying in an online, interactive and user-extensible
setting.  The experience can be _very_ good (equal or better than
\'classic\' tabletop roleplaying) under the right conditions.  In any event
they can absorb a frankly unbelievable amount of your free time.

MUD == Multi-User Dungeon
MUCK == Multi-User Carnal Knowledge     ;-) 

They\'re online, multi-user interactive role-playing environments.  If you\'ve
never played one, they\'re hard to describe, but vaguely similar in concept 
to the old Zork or adventure games, but with multiple players (who can
interact with each other and with the game) online at once.  Certain players
can extend the game database and/or programming logic, as well.

There are a large number of such games based on White Wolf\'s Storyteller
game; as I understand it, each player in these games maintains a character
sheet for their character, and uses this in conjunction with the programming
of the game.  Other games exist which revolve around science-fiction and
fantasy themes, ranging from Star Trek through Albedo-esque \'critters\' (the
[in?]famous FurryMUCK) to classic swords and sorcery.

A Traveller MUSH or MOO (or even MUD or MUCK) would require GDW\'s
permission (Traveller is a trademark, and you also would require their
permission to use portions of their copyrighted background material and game
rules).  At least in _theory_, such a game could be successful in generating
additional interest in Traveller for GDW (particularly if the online game is
written in such a way that a copy of the Traveller rules is very useful to
players).  Considering the sheer number of Storyteller-based online games,
White Wolf must be seeing some benefit from this form of marketing.

Without proper permission from GDW, such a game is flatly impossible, and
should not be attempted.  Even with permission, a considerable amout of
Traveller-specific set-up and programming would have to be done, in order
to support things like space travel, interstellar travel, and other game
aspects specific to Traveller.  This would be a good deal of work for a
talented database builder or programmer.

MUSH and MOO are both (somewhat contrived) acronyms, derived by example
  from MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).  MUDs in general are server programs
  that people connect to, using clients or plain Telnet; they resemble
  the old text-only adventure games, in which the players move around 
  in a virtual environment of rooms, objects, and sometimes monsters.

The MUD concept has gone in two directions.  One has refined the \'game\'
  programming; these are almost all based on the same \'kill-the-monster-
  get-the-treasure-go-up-levels\' D&D model, while the technical side
  becomes more and more sophisticated.  This type is referred to as
  "combat MUDs" or just "MUDs", as they tend to be literally multi-user
  dungeons.  The other type has turned away from the competitive 
  aspect, using the virtual environment for socializing and/or role-
  playing.  MUSHes and MOOs are currently the two most popular server
  programs of this type.

MOOs tend to be more social these days, while MUSH is the platform 
  used for roleplaying worlds.  In the early days of MUSH, games based
  on the Pern series by Anne MacCaffery (and run with her permission)
  were the dominant type; now the balance has shifted to the World of
  Darkness setting of White Wolf\'s supernatural games.  (Something
  about a dark, brooding, tragic, misunderstood character that can
  rip out the throat of anyone he doesn\'t like seems to appeal to 
  today\'s teenaged gamers.)  There are also several BattleTech MUSHes
  with code for mech combat, a ShadowRun MUSH, assorted Star Trek
  games set in various periods, and so on.  Some MUSHes have a more
  general theme without being based on any one fictional universe.

For more information, check out the newsgroups in the rec.games.mud.*
  section:  .announce, .misc, .tiny (most relevant to MUSH/MOO and
  the \'social\' type), and .lp or .diku (flavors of combat MUD).  The
  FAQ is posted frequently there.

Being in Canada, the actions of the petty Congress concern me not one whit.
Not that this has anything to do with Traveller, though.

Thankyou Hugh, I\'m glad to see that someone has finally spotted the 
difference.  MT was simply an inclusion of all the Traveller books, with 
extrapolation and some new bits (not many in total, quite a few in pages), 
most of the latter appear as if they were done in isolation to the rest of 
the universe as stated or created - hence the loopholes/conflicts (High 
Guard damage tables and Damage Points for weapons and ships!!!).

TNE is a totally new game, built from the ground up using T2000 (not 
Arnie), and Dark Conspiracy (all TM/c GDW).  Hence it is a distinct 
possibility that those who enjoyed CT and/or MT will not enjoy TNE.  If 
however you enjoyed T2000 2nd _AND_ CT/MT then you would very possibly 
love TNE!!  However I\'m one of the former.  I enjoyed CT and to a lesser 
degree MT, but not Tw2000 etc.  Hence I\'m disappointed to say that I 
think GDW and I have gone our separate ways to a significant degree.

Shame really, considering Frank Chadwick\'s excellent games such as the 
Third WW series (if somewhat fictional now in setting and scope) and 
Marc\'s superb vision of the future of science fiction RP genre by 
creating Traveller (TM/c GDW) along with all of those who had input.

I would like to take this opportunity to go on record to say a BIG (HUGE, 
Tigress sized) _THANKS_ to all those involved in the creation and 
development of the first edition of Traveller.

Thanks guys for giving me the best 12 years of my life and yet more to 
come (over 50% of my life has been dedicated to reffing Traveller - CT/MT).

Just my bit guys.

Well, first off, I wan\'t being that serious, but once I thought it
up, I figured I could come up with a lot of half-baked evidence
to support it. The biggest flaw is that there is no Imperial/Hiver
border to speak of - when I went home to check my maps I discovered that
the client state/buffer region is a lot bigger than I remembered it
being. I forgot about the Peace of Ftahalr too, well, I got confused
after having read the Rebellion Sourcebook at any rate.

HA! See! They have your brain washed too!

Seriously, it was meant only half as a serious explanation of the
Supressions and half as a paranoid conspiracy theory. Talk to a few
members of the moot though and I\'d bet that more than a few of them could
be convinced that this is the truth (if they didn\'t already believe it).
Look at all the conspiracy theories around today - there\'s _got_ to be
some floating around the Imperium. (Why would anyone be looking for a reason
to hate Hivers? I dunno, why do some white people hate some black people?
Weird people just happen sometimes.)

I\'m a long time lurker here, infrequent participator, but I hope to 
change that.

I have a couple of questions that are completely unrelated:
1) Did the Marches Campaign Book that GDW put out cover any new material 
or was it a rehash of older Traveller material?

2) Did DGP ever come out with The Black Duke? I don\'t remember seeing 
ANY adventures produced by DGP except in the Traveller\'s Digest.

3) What is the structure of the Julian Protectorate? I can\'t seem to 
find much info about them. How long have they been in existence? I 
remember seeing something about a Julian War. I was wondering if there 
was any official (or unofficial) source that has detailed the Julian 
Protectorate. What kind of Government do they have? What is their 
feeling toward the Imperium?

4) Are there Imperial Courts to handle Imperial Law? Where are they (or 
how often do they occur: 1 per sector?, 1 per subsector?).

5) Are the two Megatraveller computer games considered "canon"? Is the 
information provided in these games about the planets in the Spinward 
Marches the same as in Traveller?

6) Where is the Dark Nebula in Dark Nebula sector?

7) I remember seeing somewhere a mention of the Imperial Army. I didn\'t 
think the Imperial government had any armed forces besides the Navy and 
Marines. Who makes up the Imperial Army and what are it\'s duties? Is it 
the Army of Capital/Core?

8) Am I asking too many questions?

9) Terra is two parsecs from the nearest system (according to Library 
Data N-Z).  How did they skip jump-1 and go right to jump-2?

I\'ll post my other questions in the TML list, as they relate to TNE.

_The Black Duke_ never came out, but they did come out with _The

_Challenge_ #49 has an extensive article on the Protectorate,
including a map of Mendan sector. Humans and Vargr have lived in that
region since the Rule of Man, but the JP itself dates from the Julian
War (it\'s named after Julian Menderes, a charismatic head of the
Menderes megacorp, a powerful player in the region). The War was a
Pacification Campaign-style attempt to reincorporate the "coreward
Makhidkarun territories" that met very stiff resistance (eventually
leading to extensive penetration into Antares sector before peace was
declared - an embarassment the Imperium prefers to gloss over).

The government is somewhat like that of the Solomani Confederation,
but less centralized and without the odious totalitarian
aspects. Basically, the Protectorate provides a dispute resolution
structure, trade regulation mechanisms, and crisis military force for
a group of variously-sized member states (ranging from interstellar
polities to nations on balkanized worlds). Protectorate states are
characterized by generally close cooperation between humans and Vargr;
the headquarters world, Asimikigir, has a true dual-species culture.
This is in contrast to the second-rate organization of the region, the
Third Empire of Gashikan, which has a long history of Vargr-hatred
(originating with the Sack of Gashikan, when said world was looted by
Vargr and attacked with nuclear weapons). 

The JP has generally positive relations with the Imperium but
agressively maintains its own identity as a polity. With the
Rebellion, they tended to support Brzk; they have close ties with that
region of the Imperium, and the Antares region was briefly a JP member
state. 

>9) Terra is two parsecs from the nearest system (according to Library 
>Data N-Z).  How did they skip jump-1 and go right to jump-2?

They didn\'t - they just made two jump-1 jumps. The US Space Force
constructed (over an extended period) a refueling depot about one
parsec out from Terra, which was used as a stopping-off point for the
USSF mission to Barnard\'s Star (under UN Space Coordinating Agency
auspices). But as well all know, what was to be a triumphant
demonstration of American technology encountered something much
bigger...

I don\'t think that there is any canon on this point.  I\'m now writing an
article for submission to the Traveller Chronicle addressing law and
justice in the Imperium.  You can consider the following a work in
progress:

In my own games, there is a well developed and rather complex, but still
quite small, Imperial judiciary.  In general, the Imperial courts have
original jurisdiction over admiralty (any litigation involving spacecraft),
Imperial criminal law (like importing Hiver warbots), and other matters of
Imperial edict, as well as appellate jurisdiction over
regulatory adjudicative bodies (like the Ministry of Spacers\' Health and
Safety), the highest manorial courts (courts run by the landed nobility),
and any issues of violation of the rights of Imperial citizens.  

The sheer number of admiralty cases mandates a lot of Imperial courts. 
Usually, these are funded the local nobility, but the judges still owe fealty
directly to the Emperor, not the sector dukes.

I recently posted some other ideas to this list, in response to questions
posed by Alvin Plummer.  I don\'t remember in which digests, however.

>7) (text deleted) Who makes up the Imperial Army and what are it\'s [sic]
>duties? Is it the Army of Capital/Core?

I think that Steve Higginbotham described the Imperial Army as command
formations and cadre that were filled in by local reserves in wartime.  This
sounds reasonable to me.  In Fifth Frontier War, the Imperial Army starts
with a few brigades and regiments (the Marines are all regiments), but
after a while the Rimward Forces begin to arrive.  I think that the Rimward
Forces are local troops, perhaps up to army group level (like Porozlo\'s
XXXX unit), with regular Imperial army personnel in the higher
command and liaison functions.  Again, I refer you to earlier digests, but I
don\'t know exactly which ones.  Maybe Steve does.

>8) Am I asking too many questions?

I don\'t think it\'s possible to ask too many questions.

>9) Terra is two parsecs from the nearest system (according to Library 
>Data N-Z).  How did they skip jump-1 and go right to jump-2?

The first jumps were within the solar systems -- microjumps, in effect.

Ditto

Myself I wasn\'t too keen on MT.  Tech-15 equipment was just a little bit 
too easy for the players to get hold of, and a little too gadgety.  I 
often had to audit players lists and "confiscate" combat armour, battle 
dress & FGMP15s!

Call me a traditionalist, but I\'ll stick with the original (and best) 
Traveller.

Though I\'ve made a few additional changes and "house rules" here and 
there to tidy up a few things I thought  needed it.

As already mentioned, the Black Duke was never published, but DGP\'s other
produ
ct, the Flaming Eye, was. Also, GDW\'s Knightfall was written by Joe D.
Fugate,

Sr., and so in essense could be considered a DGP product (the quality of this
p
roduct is far superior to normal GDW standards, and closely resembles the
quali
ty one would expect from DGP)

>4) Are there Imperial Courts to handle Imperial Law? Where are they (or
>how often do they occur: 1 per sector?, 1 per subsector?).

As this issue has never been discussed much in official Traveller or
MegaTravel
ler material, it has been necessary to make up a thing or two. One must keep
in
 mind, that imperial law mostly (if not only) applies to the space between
worl
ds. Thus, in most cases, local law will apply.

In my games, imperial law is the jurisdiction of the landed nobility. Putting
t
he judiciary responsibilities in the hands of a (mainly) hereditary group of
pe
ople may not seem to ensure fairness, but on the other hand, it\'s not a
perfect
 world.

In practise I would say that the noble person in question presides as a judge
o
ver a court consisting of civil servants and/or military personnel, depending
o
n the issue involved. You can consider this as an Imperial Court. The way I
han
dle them, they do not exist as permanent institutions, but only on an ad hoc
ba
sis. Thus, the question of how many there are, can\'t meaningfully be
answered.

Now these are just my idiosyncratic views, but I agree in general with
sudet@we
ll.sf.ca.us concerning jurisdiction.

There\'s no real need to do that. Combat armour and especially battle dress is
not very available on the open market. The same goes for FGMP-15s. If these items
are quite difficult to get hold of, it might constitute an adventure in
itself finding some.

Also, FGMP-15s are illegal on most worlds, and in my games, so are battle dresses.
What reasons other than combat could there possibly be for wearing a battle
 dress in a downtown restaurant? So, if combat is illegal, so must battle
dress
es be!

These items also require special skills as Battle Dress or Energy Weapons,
whic
h are not that easy to get in character generation. If the PCs can\'t use the
ga
dgets, then what would they need them for?

The bottom line is this: It is far more satisfying for all involved, if you
mak
e up rationales for limitations, instead of just saying "you can\'t do that".
Th
is way, players will accept your decisions, and they have basis for hoping,
tha
t some day, they will get these cool items.

If you mean CT\'s _Solomani Rim_, you\'re right on the ball.  For those of 
you who don\'t have a copy (like me two weeks ago), the two government\'s 
had rather peaseful and non-provocative relations with each other, 
although they still weren\'t exactly the best of friends.  The Solomani 
had turned their attention to colonizing the rimward border, and would 
give only verbal support (and maybe weak verbal support, too!) to 
Solomani movement\'s in ex-Solomani, Imperial space.  Probably the only 
real sore point was Terra itself.

Alternate history #5 ! (Along with Emperor Varian, a quick Dulilour coup, 
the assassination of Lucan, and  - most realistic - a fractured, 
burned-out shell of human space, dominated by the Solomani and Lucan II.)

If Dulinor had pulled it off, he still would have had to contend with 
`Solomani racism\' and the Solomani loathing of big government.  I doubt 
if relations would have improved much, although he may have managed to 
make a deal over Terra.

There is sufficient evidence in MT to conclude that Solomani hostilities
towards the Imperium following Strephon\'s assasination was _NOT_ a planned
operation by the Solomani Confderation civillian government.

We have to assume that the Confederation\'s intelligence assets where
efficient enough to learn of the assasination, and escape the Imperial
capitol before that system was closed to traffic.  To do otherwise is to
assume complete incompetance on the part of their intelligence apparatus.

Now, consider the best possible transit time for the news of Strephon\'s
assination from the capital of the Imperium to the capital of the
Confederation.  Allow a reasonable (even if short) time for debate on the
proper response by the Confederation.  Now compute the transit time _back_
to the border systems of the Confederation from which the attack would have
to be launched, and you can arrive at the earliest possible date for the
attack to begin.

Compare your results against the published materials, and you will discover
that Solomani forces had _already_ attacked the Imperium, _before_ any
possible decision could have reached them from the central government!  

After having eliminated the impossible (a central, considered decision to go
to war), what remains must be the truth: Either the Solomani Confederation
had a general order of long standing that the war was to be resumed upon the
death of Emporer Strephon, OR one or more officers on the border recieved
the information concerning the Emporer\'s death and acted on his (or her) own
initiative to resume hostilities (!).

Either that, or it\'s all a hiver plot.  ;-)

I mean really - vector movement, detailed criticals, plenty of opportunity 
for character involvement without the "i rolled a 6, your character\'s dead" 
of standard traveller combat.  To paraphrase tony the tiger: "It\'s great!"

Also, in this same vein, i have a program i got off AOL about 2 years ago 
called GM.exe.  As a resource for a sci fi roleplaying game - no matter 
what system - this is really good.  I don\'t suppose anyone has an update to 
this?  (For those who are unfamiliar, one of the neater functions of ths 
program is the zooming feature.  You can go to levels of detail - NOT 
randomly generated as you zoom, but consistent through repeated tests - in 
this order, largest to smallest scale, all in VGA: Stellar map (shows stars 
& their systems), planet map (shows the surface map of the planet with 
rough elevations & water level & cities), planet map more detailed (about 4 
levels of this) city maps (showing the street plan and general function of 
each city block, educational, military, commercial, etc.) block maps 
(showing local streets, buildings and the number of floors in each 
building), and finally building maps for each building (you can go to each 
floor in a 210 story building, and the floor maps make sense; atriums 
match, elevators match, etc.))  it\'s great.

The problem with this is that a little number crunching and a little logic
thinking will show that the Awful Ihatei Threat is nothing of the kind. No
Aslan clan can afford to send out any ihatei fleet that could threaten an
Imperial _subsector_ fleet, let alone one backed by a few Fleet squadrons.
Only by total cooperation could they become a shadow of a menace  -  and
one of the main characteristics of the Aslans is that they can\'t cooperate
for any length of time.

Only if every Imperial Admiral since the Vargr Pacification War has been a
total moron. You stop Vargr raiding by making the Vargr border worlds
responsible for any raiding. Then destroy their spaceports every time a
vargr raid annoys you.* Pretty soon the Vargr worlds stop catering to the
Corsairs and start hunting them down. You could do that with a lot less
than the Corridor fleet.

*Historical note: That\'s the way (at least according to Dudley Pope) the
 Buccaneers handled Spanish raids.

[Btw: Yes, I know that I\'m doing exactly what I\'ve argued against in 
 connection with other subjects. I\'m saying: "This is impossible",
 instead of saying: "This is a historical fact. How can we explain it?"
 I\'m sorry. I\'ve tried to imagine how the Aslan and the Vargr could 
 become such menaces as they are described in Megatraveller, but given
 the information we have about them it just dosen\'t make sense. The
 closest I can come is a combination of treason and gross incompetense
 on the part of an incredible number of Imperial admirals and politicians.]

Ah but why make the armor illegal?  The government is then punishing the

Of course, the characters have yet to even SEE battle dress.

More interesting "Alternate questions"!  I suspect that, if the Confederation
was part of the Imperium during the Rebellion, it would depend vitally on 
who was the Archduke at the time.  If he was a strong, pro-Imperial 
Archduke (a la Norris) the area would either have provided muscle and a
centre for the `Moderate pro-Imperial\' fractions (Norris, Margaret, Craig, 
maybe Brks and that guy in charge of Gateway) to retake the Imperium.  If he 
was strong and pro-independent, the Solomani Confederation v.2 would have 
been born.  If he was weak, the area would have fractured into a billion 
fragments as local independent movements take off.

THIS is interesting, to see if the Aslan New Lords can retake their old 
clan holdings!  Does the infected portions of the Hierate even remember 
the old clans?  Have new clans formed to replace the old ones? (I would 
think yes!)  How has the Aslan Honor Code chaned in the Wilds?  It 
certainly isn\'t the universal code it used to be!

The Aslan\'s are so LAND... LAND... LAND hungry, I wouldn\'t be surprised 
if they have ALREADY started their reconquest!

   Interjection from another kibitzer:  Raise average Aslan and Vargr TL to 16,
increase number of Ihatei to around 3,000,000,000, and increase number
of Vargr attacking the Imperium to a similar level.
   Or ten times that number of TL15 Vargr and Aslan.
   Note that they will STILL lose if you do that, since Vincennes (somewhere in
Deneb) is 10,000,000,000 TL16 Impies, but it gives them almost a chance of
being a real (minor) nuisance.

   I hate this one too, but the only OTHER alternative is that the Vargr/Aslan
threats are a classic example of "crisis mongering" - not a significant factor,
really, but blown all out of proportion by the Impy Media, the Navy (bigger
appropriations, etc), etc...

 WHAT! You CAN\'T be serious! Jeez. I was given SpaceMaster
and TechLaw as a present some years ago and I *still* haven\'t been
about to work out their ship design or combat system. The
BlahMaster series was always good for lots and lots and lots and
lots of tables that added the preception of detail to a system
but really just made it a lot more work.
 There were some pretty cool ideas in it. Like stats for
personal shields, alternant replicants, and several other things
I used regularly in my Traveller. I tried running a Star Wars
variant using pure SpaceMaster and it took 3 hours to roll up
one character before we gave up and fudged it. My impression of
the space combat and ship design was that it was bizzare and
complex.
 Not a system I, personally, would reccomend to anyone
(except maybe actuaries :-).

The big problem with the Aslans is their lack of cohesion. (Well, the
biggest... as Steve says the fact that they are collectively weaker than
the Regency dosen\'t help ;-) Given any situation where the Regency is
significanly stronger than any single Aslan clan they have a better than
even chance of playing the clans off against each other. Say that you
have an Aslan coalition that is stronger than the Regency. Each clan 
Admiral will have to keep in mind that once the Regency is defeated he will
need his forces to defend his new worlds against the other clans. So if the
Regency can smash any one clan before being overwhelmed, what clan admiral
is going to let his ships get pulped just so that another clan can get new
lands?

Then you have to remember that the Aslans can only afford to to outfit 1,8%
of each new generation for ihatei-hood (This figure is based on the
assumption that a clan will use 10% of its naval budget on ihatei ships and
90% on defending their home  -  not an unreasonable assumption I think).
Furthermore, ihatei are equipped with obsolescent ships. That generally
means at least one tech level drop. Steve\'s suggestion about TL 16 is
sound, because even with that, the ihatei will be equipped with TL 15,
but as it is now, they are TL 13. And as Steve will tell you, each tech 
level makes ships much more effective AND cheaper. In other words, you get 
more AND better ships with higher tech level.

As for making the neighbours TL 16, you could do that, but it won\'t work for 
me. I\'ve always assumed that TL 16 was the cutting edge of the _discoveries_ 
made by anyone in Charted Space. In other words, that every TL 16 item in 
existence today (Aritfacts excepted) were proto-types (That, incidentally, 
very satisfactorily disposes of Vincennes and that Vargr world in my 
Traveller universe).


The Vargr Corsairs has the problem that pirating isn\'t profitable unless
there are a lot more merchant ships than pirates. And I\'ve always assumed
that there is a high correlation between the size of the merchant fleet 
and the potential size of the naval fleet (I say potential, because in
peaceful times the naval fleet will be much lower than it can be. But
if there are all these Corsairs mucking about then it isn\'t peaceful times,
is it?)

Corsairs thrive where the other side\'s navy isn\'t. And that most certainly
isn\'t at the home planets!

Ahh, but wait - note I didn\'t say replace the TRAVELLER game withthe 
TABLEMASTER game.  I said replace the spacecraft rules.  (ONLY).  On the 
whole, I agree with your analysis of the Rolemaster system - 90% bosh.  
But there CAN be wheat in the chaff...
Does anyone remember the MAYDAY ship to ship rules for traveller?  Anyone?  
I loved it - true vector movement, gravity, etc.  Clearly - if looked at 
with an open mind - I think most would agree that the space combat system 
in Spacemaster was lifted almost entirely from Mayday.
Here\'s the reasons that I like the Spacemaster design system:
1) The ships use mass in Metric tonnes and volume in cubic meters.  Not 
some 13.7 cubic meter thingy.
2) The Jump engine logic is, to me, more realistic.  Jump engines drive you 
a number of lightyears per day in hyperspace.  Not a "one week trip no 
matter where you go or how big of engines you have".
3) Ship manevuer drives can go over 6gs.  You tell me that in traveller, 
where they can design g-plates to support a 60t tank, but can\'t put 
together the pieces in a starship to give it 10g acceleration? Huh?
Anyway, I love traveller.  Don\'t get me wrong.  But I have ALWAYS been 
disappointed by the starship combat system, or lack thereof.  Seriously - 
read High Guard and tell me it makes ANY sense as a combat system for any 
but 17thC Man o\' Wars.

O.K.: how about the Zhodani?  How many people do they have, and what\'s 
their tech level (about 14, as far as I can make out)?  

They seem to be a real threat (at least in the offical universe), and 
some have said that the current Regency -- ooops, I mean the Domain of 
Deneb -- only exists at their mercy.

I don\'t see anything in the rules to indicate how many mail lots are

I think that\'s a bit drastic...

The Imperium isn\'t at _war_ with either the Vargr or Aslan, so, for the most
part, the Imperial Navy is required to respect Imperial borders. Vargr
raiders can\'t be chased back to their bases. Vargr corsairs jump out,
slap a few merchants around and head home. A little cunning, a few drop tanks
and those big old battleships can\'t do much to stop them. The Imperial 
Navy is designed to scare off major intruders and fight major battles,
not to chase penny-ante Vargr around.

As for Aslan, they\'re annoying in a long-term way. They drop several tens
of thousands of Aslan down in an uninhabitated part of an Imperial world,
which isn\'t _that_ big a deal. Until they do it to every world along the
Imperial/Aslan border. And they start taking more land. And pretty soon,
you have a lot of Aslan under Imperial rule - for now.

Vargr, maybe not. While they might not do a lot of damage in a military
sense, they can play real havoc with trade and shipping in the area.
The smaller the ship, the better. (Gee, don\'t _players_ usually have small
ships?) Not to mention that mercenaries fighting Vargr units have to worry
that the Vargr might not follow the Imperial rules of war. No more
surrender and activate the repatreation bond - you\'re going to die.
(A "bad war" as that bit of MT puts it)

As for the Aslan, yeah, it probably is crisis mongering, at least before
the Collapse. There are probably a lot of Aslan under Imperial rule and
they don\'t have any problem with it. Aren\'t there a fair number of Aslan
in the Darrian confederation that have served them in the past as
mercenaries?
Promise them a little land and those Aslan will probably fight like hell...

  I would be surprised if there were less than a trillion Zhos.  I wouldn\'t
be too
surprised to find out that there were as many as five trillion.
  As to TL, they are "currently" (as of 1111) TL14, in the process of
advancing
to TL15.  By 1200 they should be pretty solidly TL15.
  Note that the Zhos are, at least theoretically, more uniform
technologically
than the Impies.

    No, the Solomani are the real threat.  High tech (14-15+), high pop (they
seem to be pretty much higher pop than a corresponding number of Impy
worlds), aggressive.  It\'s just a matter of time till the big bad Terrans
come
calling again.
    But the Zhos are certainly more of a menace than the Vargr and Aslan
are.
    And the Regency exists at Zho mercy.  The Domain had the Corridor
Fleet to back it up.  Plus Trin,. Tobia, Glisten, Mora, Rhylanor, Vincennes,
and Efate. ;-)

   Zero or one lot of mail.  Howsomever, the Goverment pays you for one (1)
5T lot of mail per trip you make, whether there is any mail or not.  Assuming

Considering that strength overrides are possible with battle dress, you can 
punch someone with strength 30. Also, battle dresses come equipped with a laser
mounted on the lower arm and a heads up targeting display. This I would
definitely not consider to be for defensive purposes.

In my campaigns light discreet armor is normally legal, battle dresses and
such are not in civilized surroundings. Also, imperial battle dresse are
controlled by imperial forces.

One might well ask Congress.  Before the "Great Massacre" of November 1994,
there were at least two Gun Control bills before the US Congress that would
also ban private ownership of body armor and night vision equipment.  The
stated reason was that "honest folk don\'t need to worry about being shot at
or seeing things in the dark, so only dishonest folk would want these
things."

On most worlds, law level needs to be strongly tempered with local
cultural attitudes.  Just because a gun or armor is legal does not
make it socially acceptable in a public gathering.  Alternatively, some
societies with a higher law level might be so bad off that the locals
would think anyone without armor to be insane, and EVERYBODY
carries some sort of weapon (legal or otherwise).

If this holds true to the rebellion, then the Solomani are
going to have a hard time against their TL-15 opponents.
Mind you, I have a hard time convincing myself that the Solomani
lagged behind the Imperium, especially in military tech.

If there is one thing us Solomani have proven to be good 
at over the centuries, it\'s in devising new and ingenious
ways of killing each other....I\'d be tempted to put Solomani
military tech. at TL16, just on general principles...

Alternatative history #133:  Solomani TL 16 (even some 
experimental TL17?) warships sweep aside the Imperial 
opposition with almost embarassing ease.  By 1123, the 
squabbling Imperial factions are forced to unite (at least
for the moment) to stop the Solomani Confederation from 
completely wiping the floor with them.  By 1130, the Imperium
has been conquered, and the New Rule of Man becomes the 
new order.  Of course, by 1140 the victorious Solomani start
turning on each other...so it\'s the Rebellion all over again...

remember the following from, but I think it is correct.  To carry mail, 
you need a mail contract, which I take to mean a contract with the local 
Postal Union, an type ofinstitution vaguely mentioned in the Library Data 
(MT Imperial Encyclopedia).  To hold a contract, the vessel concerned 
must be armed (in order to protect the mail) and have sufficient gunners 
to operate the weaponry.  I also assume that ship captains & crews would 
be vetted for their reliability, so that for example ex-Navy crew would 
find it easier to get a contract.  Some reasonable ship-board security 
against hijacking would also be in order.  I seem to remember that 
Subsidised vessels were favoured, presumably because they could be relied 
upon to serve a given area regularly.

In my game, I restrict mail to 54 kilitre blocks, which is a standard 
transport crate.  I add the population of the source world to that of the 
destination world, and roll 2D10; DM -1 if travelling to or from an xboat 
route, but +2 if travelling between 2 worlds on an xboat route.  If the 
roll is less than the sum of the populations, then there is a mail crate 
waiting to go.  The mail is sealed in the crate, and may or may not 
actually be 54 klitres in volume; regardless, the payment is Cr. 20 000, 
and the volume is 54 klitres of hold space.

In Starship Operators Manual, one of the "Old Timer" anecdotes refers to 
a scam involving the mail.  As a crate did\'t get sent if there wasn\'t 
enough mail to fill it to a certain fraction.  Thus, a ship captain would 
find out how much mail was waiting, and if it was close but not quite 
close enough, he would post a load of bogus packages to his next 
destination.  As the postage on such a small fraction of the total mail 
load was small compared to the payment for shipping the entire crate, he 
could ensure a profit.  However, he was caught out when he realised that 
if he put dodgy addresses on, the packages would be returned, and he 
could get paid twice for only one set of postage.  As the return 
addresses were dodgy too, the post office ended up opening the parcels 
and realised what was happening.  An investigation ensued, and the gready 
ship captain was caught.  At least, that\'s how I remember it!

The Aslan aren\'t a major threat.  The only reason they swept through 
the Trojan Reach during the Rebellion was because the sector was thinly
populated, they overran an anti-Hierate Aslan splinter state (the
Glorious Empire) and then hit Imperial areas that had had their fleets
sent to coreward according to old Frontier War mobilization plans that
didn\'t apply.  The mobilization plan assumed that the Trojan Reach
border would be quiet, as in all the Frontier Wars, and that the ships
would be needed more near the Zhodani-Vargr border.  Remember, there 
was a fair amount of upheaval in the area as Norris fleshed out the
skeletal Domain government, and communications delay meant that by the
time people realized that Aslan fleets were on the move, they had
already reached their objectives in many cases.  The Domain, given
time, can probably organize enough to re-establish control over the
lost areas if this is the case.   

The Vargr are only a low level threat, and are only a problem when the
Imperial fleets are all busy doing something else important, like saving
worlds from the psionic hordes or destroying the core worlds of the 
Imperium for Lucan.  :)  But even a low level threat can cause a heck
of a lot of damage in hit-and-run attacks.

But there are plausible reasons why the Corridor can\'t be re-opened.
Deneb doesn\'t dare spare the naval strength that it would take to do the
job from the Zhodani border just seven years after a major regional war,
especially since the main source of reinforcements in Corridor is now
missing.  The RVE is more interested in the problems of the interior
than in using its\' precious strength to open the Corridor.  And the 
formation of the RVE is another reason why Imperial Deneb might be less
than interested in reopening the long Mora--Vland route.

The Domain exists at their mercy.  In the 1100s, Zhodani tech is solidly
14, with only Zhdant and maybe a world or two more at tech-15.  The
CT _Spinward Marches Campaign_ said that the Consulate has about 6000
worlds to the Imperium\'s 11000, which if the Imperium has 9000 systems
would be in about 5000 systems.  If Zhodani population densities are
similar to average Imperial (depends on how Zhodani world generation  
works) then the population of the Consulate is probably somewhere from
seven to nine trillion, as a "back of the envelope" guess.

You\'re missing the point. By \'menace\' I\'m not talking about the 400 T
Corsairs that snap up a merchant once in a while (The small pirates are
another painful subject. I want them to be possible, but the dynamics of
jump travel and the spacing of inhabited worlds are against them... but
let that lie. Even if they had a realistic basis for existence they 
wouldn\'t be a menace). I\'m talking about those mythical raiders who attack 
actual Imperial planets and defeat Imperial starships. They just can\'t
exist. Anything big enough to be a threat needs the facilities of a base
world, and any such world can be treated like the US Navy treated the
Barbary States. The Imperial subsector fleets alone are strong enough
to deal with anything the Vargr can come up with. (OK, they may need to
borrow a regular fleet to retaliate).

Again you\'re missing the point. Leaving aside the fact that the Imperial
Navy is perfectly capable of intercepting those Aslans before they drop,
such settlers are not a threat. In fact, Aslans are in many way just the
kind of subjects that a ruler dreams about. Loyal. So what you do if you
have missed a drop is to go visit the _ihatei_ lord and demand he swears
fealthy to Norris in exchange for letting him stay on the land (Because
the Navy IS strong enough to boot out any single settlement). Then you
charge him with the responsibility of defending those lands against other
_ihatei_. And Presto Chango you\'ve got a border guard instead of an
invader.

>Vargr, maybe not. While they might not do a lot of damage in a military

No they can\'t. The Imperial Navy is plenty big enough to make the life of
a pirate very hard. Place one 30.000 T Cruiser at the 100 diameter limit
of each world and the merchants have a safe spot to jump to and from. And
do you know how many cruisers the Imperial Navy budget runs to? (Btw. I 
don\'t mean to say that a single cruiser is the optimum way to protect a 
star system. I think some orbital forts with fighter bays would be more 
like it. But the cruisers will work.)

Yep. That\'s the painful part of it. The PCs can\'t get away with piracy
either.

What mercenaries? The Imperial Navy will make sure no Vargr ever reaches

According the Metlay, our Traveller Historian, "AECO" stands
for "African ECOsystem".  I\'ve also heard it parsed as "African

The basic game is extremely simple and it ramps up to extreme

I found it only really suitable for small engagements between the 
smaller classes of ships.  There are quite large ships involved but we 
only ever used fighters.  Fighters do have character in this - unlike 
High Guard, (IMHO of course).

With the ICE critical hit system it\'s got a lot more flavour for role 
playing a battle - and scope for fudging so that the players don\'t get 
creamed by a lucky hit.

I don\'t see how anyone can be comfortable with FF&S and not get the 
Star Strike construction rules.  They are more complex than High Guard 
granted, but they\'re not more complicated than MT, although they do 
offer more options.

Whatever about Space Master, which, like Role Master has it\'s flaws, 
Star Strike, and the ground combat Armored Assault, are very good.

 WHAT! You CAN\'T be serious! Jeez. I was given SpaceMaster
and TechLaw as a present some years ago and I *still* haven\'t been
about to work out their ship design or combat system. The
BlahMaster series was always good for lots and lots and lots and
lots of tables that added the preception of detail to a system
but really just made it a lot more work.
 There were some pretty cool ideas in it. Like stats for
personal shields, alternant replicants, and several other things
I used regularly in my Traveller. I tried running a Star Wars
variant using pure SpaceMaster and it took 3 hours to roll up
one character before we gave up and fudged it. My impression of
the space combat and ship design was that it was bizzare and
complex.
 Not a system I, personally, would reccomend to anyone
(except maybe actuaries :-).

A couple of years ago, a freighter carrying illegal Chinese immigrants sailed
into San Francisco Bay.  It passed by TWO Coast Guard stations, the Treasure
Island Navy Base, NAS Alameda, the Golden Gate Maritime Radar Station, and
any number of commercial ferrys and container ships.
The first person to realize that something was *wrong* was a military
policeman at The Presidio, who saw the freighter beach itself.  To assume
that every Vargr raider is going to announce itself from the moment of
breakout is silly.
A smart Vargr leader will hijack an Imperial-design ship, take it back to the

The most popular joke in the bomb shelters of Berlin in 1942 was "where is

was no way Allied bombers could reach the German heartland...unfortunately,
they had never heard of the B-17....

<Chuckle> Good point! However, I could return the offer and 
we could go for a stroll around Moss Side, Manchester, UK,

 The way the rules read it implies that you get
paid mail duty for *any* jump you make.
 The assumptions I have behind this are that there
is an Imperial "Small Parcel Post" system. Posting via this
3rd class will send it out (and onward) on the next Imperial
Mail ship to pass through (i.e. special purpose mail ship).
The schedule for these would vary depending on the pop and
starport of the planet.
 Sending something "2nd class" will schedule it for
the next mail ship *or* a ship with a mail contract as
specified in the rule you have mentioned.
 Sending it "1st class" will send it out as freight
on the next available ship.
 In interests of efficiency any ship with a mail
contract going through will be loaded with any outstanding
2nd or 3rd class mail, particularly if it is going towards
a "sorting office" (bascially any planet on an X-boat
route). They will get 1st class stuff too if they are
going *exactly" the right way.
 The way I play it not just anyone can sign up for
mail service. You usually have to have a proven track
record of going useful places and usually a Noble sponsor.
I also play a similar "Naval Mail" variant. It pays
the same but you only get it when jumping to or from
a world with a Naval base. It is easier to get, most
shipowners with a military background and a medal generally
have no problem. It is also a good step toward getting
a commercial mail.

Yep!  My point exactly.  You can find all sorts of really
odd things in the Congressional Record; it makes a
wonderful resource for making up future societies,
religions or governments.  Take some of the proposals
from the Congress and push them to their logical 
conclusions (whether you agree with them or not).  I 
have even had luck doing this with extremist political
viewpoints and extremist religious beliefs.

I\'ve been (sort of) following the debate on the legality of weapons & 
armour.  In my game, Battle Dress is more than just "armour which stops 
High Energy Weapons", it also provides a sealed environment, radiation 
and biochemical protection, servo assisted actions, food, water, 
sanitation, 360 degree vision, synthetic vision, multi-band 
communications, computer assist, weapon system interface, and damage 
control/diagnosis (for the suit, not the user).  The inspiration for my 
ideas is the power suit described by C. J. Cherryh, especially in 
Rimrunner.  If you look at Battle Dress this way, it is clearly an 
offensive as well as defensive system, so no problem with the illegality 
of the thing.  For lesser armour types, you might look at some 
interaction between the weapon law level and the personal freedom law 
level to decide if an armour type is legal.

Did it fire on anything on its way in? Did it fire on anything after it
got in? Did it capture any prizes? Most importantly, did it fight its way 
out (with its prize) past two Coast Guard stations and a Navy base? I think 
not.

What happened to the next ship that tried the same stunt? 

>To assume that every Vargr raider is going to announce itself from the 
>moment of breakout is silly. 

Certainly. But then, I don\'t assume so. And it is nowhere as silly as
believing that anyone can make a living (as in "surviving for any length 
of time") out of playing tag with a 30,000 T cruiser or the equivalent.
Remember, piracy is a career. You survive being a pirate by a) Capturing
valuable prizes more or less intact, b) Avoiding getting withing shooting 
range of a regular warship, and c) having a safe place to hide and dispose
of the loot. The Imperial Navy is big enough to make the first two 
incompatible and strong enough to treat any Vargr border nation like the
US treated the Barbary States if they try to provide the third (Though
I\'ll grant you that there are ways around that).

Recipe for roast moose: First you catch a moose...

But, leaving aside the first step (catching the first ship), what then?
You jump into the system. You bluff the Planetary Guard into thinking you
a harmless merchant ship. You get assigned a flight path that dosen\'t take 
you near any other merchant. You get inspected by the Customs Service...

Now what?

And my point is even simpler: Where do you find the will? Vargr may be more 
impetuous than humans, but they couldn\'t have survived 300,000 years if they 
were suicidal. Piracy is not a viable way of living except in rare conditions
where you find merchant ships in areas with few naval ships to protect them. 
In out of the way places. And thanks to the jump drive each stellar system 
is effectively ONE place. That means that the Domain worlds bordering on the 
Vargr Extents are, what?, 100, 200 places in all. And the Imperial Navy has 
a lot more than 200 ships. A LOT more. A humongous lot more. I mean, you may
think there\'s a lot of peanuts in a 50-kg sack, but that\'s just...

So you might have smart criminals capturing a merchant ship every once in
a while by relying on the kind of sloth you gave an example of above. A
once in a lifetime coup for each gang that sets them up for life, even. But
a whole corsair industry like the Carrebean Buccaneers or the Barbary
Pirates? I\'m afraid not.

Now, if the drive was a warp drive so that pirates could lurk between stars
and intercept merchants then things might be different.

The point, as I understand it, is that "honest people" won\'t be
hanging around in places where they can be shot, so they don\'t
need armor or other defensive arms. If you think you do, you must
be looking for trouble. It\'s the same reasoning that claims that
"honest people" don\'t have any need for e-mail encryption or secure
telephone lines, because "honest people have nothing to hide".

There are also bills in the US Congress to ban military-style camoflauge
clothing and equipment, as well as to ban or control the sale of
police uniforms and gear. Seems we\'re so conditioned to instantly
obey anyone in a police uniform, we\'ve now got "dishonest people" 
dressing up as police/security officers and doing all kinds of crimes.

 Let some of the non-American readers of the list
correct me if I am wrong, but I think America is one of
the few countries on this world where this sort of attitude
prevails. In Ireland the citizens don\'t have guns (other
than farmers with hunting rifles and shotguns), the police
don\'t have guns, and most (but not all) of the criminals
don\'t have guns. The citizens don\'t want guns, the police
don\'t want guns and the criminals can\'t get them.
 Not every European country is quite up to this standard
but I think the 2nd Amendment (?) "we have a right to blow
away tresspassers" attidute is uniquely American.
 Rather than assume future society is all going to look
like America (although unfortunately this attitude seems
to prevail books, literature, and games) perhaps a more global
view should be taken.
 What\'s it like in Canada, Sweden, Germany, and Finland?
I\'ve seen people post from these countries. Tell us what law
levels outside of the US are like.

Well, in Canada at least, there are some pretty heavy restrictions on the 
ownership of private firearms, especially handguns. Shotguns and hunting 
rifles used to be exempt from registration, but no longer. Handguns are 
restricted and controlled heavily. There are no CCW laws that I am 
currently aware of. In terms of self defence, there is room for 
justifiable homicide...however, incidents such as the Japanese exchange 
student in the US getting blown away by a homeowner for trespassing would 
be met with one gargantuan piece of prosecution.

In terms of citizen safety?

Canada has a murder rate of appx 2.5/100,000 compared to the rate of 
about 10.0/100,000 in the United States. Violent crime (as measured in 
the US, which uses four categories, as opposed to the seven utilized by 
Canada) is higher in the US as well.

Property crime, however, is slightly higher in Canada than it is in the 
United States.

What does this mean for future societies? It depends upon what kind of 
model the future goverment is founded on. The United States was born in a 
Revolution, and is found on principles and ideals of individualism, and 
their culture and society reflects this. Depending on how a government 
and society came into being, the Law Level and how the people perceive it 
will be different- In Canada, the attitudes towards gun control are much 
different than they are in the United States, simply due to historical 
and social factors.

Between this and your other post, I have a lot of issues to (try to) 
address, but it\'s going to take some time to make sure the assumptions
I make make sense (ie. I don\'t want to stick my foot in my mouth :).

But just in case anyone else has any input:

1) I don\'t think there will/can be one very secure jump-in point per system.
2) Many systems have a lot of intra-system travel, which could be easier
   to hit, although less lucrative.
3) I don\'t think the subsector/system navies have quite so many ships
   as you propose, although this varies over time.
4) Vargr raiding bases are secure, as Imperials won\'t chase them over the
   border.

While the Imperium is strong, I think it\'s not as overpowering as you
make it out to be - otherwise it would have conquered it\'s neighbours
a long time ago, wouldn\'t it have?
Also, both the Solomani and Zhodani who have overall/maximum tech levels
at least one lower than the Imperium have given them a run for their
money in the various border wars. While they\'d be less organized, who is
to say the Vargr couldn\'t do the same?

Anyways, I shall look further into it as time permits.

That may be true for Ireland, but what about your neighbor
to the immediate north?  There\'s a country that bears a
striking resemblance to the infant USA about 220 years ago.

Perhaps, but the Second Amendment, which, by the way, reads:

"A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of
 a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
 shall not be infringed."

was deemed to be as relevant in maintaining the nature of the
U.S.A. as it was in forming it.  They reasoned that if the people
needed to throw of the yoke of an oppressive government by force
once, they just might need to do it again.

It\'s already been done.  FGU marketed a game call Bushido several
years ago, based on feudal Japan.  It was pretty good as I recall.

Perhaps there\'s a reason that so many of the role-playing games
harbor USA-centric mindsets:

1. The games are developed in the U.S. by people saturated with
   with U.S. attitudes and ideals (whether they\'re all U.S. citizens
   or not is immaterial).
2. The U.S. is currently (and has been for decades) the leading
   producer of visual media entertainment (movies, TV series, et.al.).
   A significantly high proportion of these are adventure-theme
   stories, and contain high levels of violence and/or firearms.
3. The U.S. entertainment industry would not consistantly produce
   this type of entertainment if it didn\'t have a *VERY* large
   audience.
4. The U.S. does not necessarily have a more violent history than
   other (European) countries, but it\'s history is certainly more
   well publicized than most other countries.  As a sort of \'thought\'
   experiment, I offer the following: stop a random Japanese citizen
   on the street in Tokyo and ask him about the 19th century U.S.A.
   (you know, cowboys & indians, wagon trains, the railroads\'a comin\'
   through and all that other Hollywood tripe). Then ask him about
   19th century Argentina and see if it illicits as many images.

Besides being the hotbed of RPG development, the U.S. is a *natural*
breeding ground for adventure concepts, by virtual of American fiction
themes and the general lifestyle.  It also offers one of the largest
markets for RPGs as well, and, like Hollywood, it pays to cater to
your biggest audience.  

While taking a global view might be more "enlightened", I doubt it
would last long in the marketplace.  I ask the rest of the readers
of the XBoat Maillist, how likely are you to buy a games with titles
like:

  "Russets & Sodbusters: Roleplaying on an 18th century rural Irish farm"

  - or -

  "Eat your Neighbor: Roleplaying an Ethiopian Famine Victim"

  - or -

  "Swim for Your Life!: Monsoons among the Urban Poor of Bangladesh"

Or did you have something else in mind?  Commodities brokering in
London?  Perhaps roleplaying the owner of a vineyard in the south
of France?  Truck driver in Siberia?  Postal clerk in Milano?  Or
how about a police officer in South Africa? All pulse-pounding
opportunities in roleplaying, I grant you. :^)

BTW, lest you think that I\'m completely married to the requirement
of firearms in an RPG, I feel I should mention that TSR\'s Dungeons
& Dragons is the most widely sold roleplaying game in the world,
and *THEY* hack each other up with swords. :^)

Well, I\'m an American reader, but I hope you don\'t mind my correcting you
anyway. :-)

This isn\'t really an attitude at all, but a statement of fact. The only
people I\'ve ever met who _aren\'t_ worried about getting shot at by criminals
with guns are those from places with almost no criminals--like Japan, for
instance.

The relevant attitude which prevails among many Americans (including myself)
is that regular folks have less to worry about if they\'re allowed to shoot
back--or wear body armour, which is what this thread was originally about.
:-)

Right, they get bombs instead. I\'ll grant that I\'d be less worried about
being shot by a mugger in Ireland than in the U.S., but I\'d be _much_ more
worried about getting blown up by a terrorist bomb.

> but I think the 2nd Amendment (?) "we have a right to blow
> away tresspassers" attidute is uniquely American. 

Actually, the Second Amendment only mentions \'the security of a free State,\'
nothing about trespassers. The legality of shooting criminals in
self-defense is _not_ uniquely American, though--America got it from
England, where self defense was respected for centuries before America was
colonized. Things only changed in England in the 1920\'s when Parliament got
scared by the idea of a Communist takeover, and decided to disarm the people
as a preventive measure. 70 years later, most English subjects don\'t even
remember the way things used to be.

>  Rather than assume future society is all going to look

Agreed. On the subject of Traveller law level, though, America is
unfortunately _not_ that different from most other countries--our
"representatives" have been rushing ever faster to embrace just the sort of
oppresive laws found elsewhere. Laws do vary within the U.S., but within my
grandparents\' lifetime, the law level for the majority of Americans has gone
from 0 to around 4-5. Since most worlds in Traveller seem to have rather
high law levels, I\'d say this trend is already being reflected nicely.

Yoshi Hattori, the student in question, was shot for making threatening
moves _while_ trespassing. That aside, the man who shot him would have been
met with prosecution in any American city outside of Texas--where it\'s legal
to shoot someone just for trespassing at night.

> In terms of citizen safety?

Actually, no gun (or armour) control laws have ever reduced crime in any
place (inside the U.S. or outside) they have been tried. Indeed, there is
considerable reason to believe that they _increse_ crime. The crime rate in
any society will depend on the general passiveness of that society, and on
the lengths to which the government is willing (and able) to go. 

Of course, Traveller law levels aren\'t only about gun control--that\'s just
the part that is most immediately of interest to players. Higher law levels
are likely to have much more effective police and much less crime--as in
Japan, where the police are allowed to do anything they want, including
torturing suspects.

Of course, that doesn\'t mean that only high law level areas will have low
crime. Consider Switzerland, where crime is also negligible, but people are
armed to the teeth relative to most other countries (including much of the
U.S.).

> model the future goverment is founded on.

I would argue that _any_ government will inevitably become more oppresive
until its law level is high enough that the leaders feel secure in their
control of the populace--a point that will always be well above that where
it\'s legal to own guns and armour.

The length of time this will take should vary considerably, and is not
necessarily as dependent on the original nature of the government as you
might think. As I mentioned earlier, it took centuries for the British
government to stamp out the right to self-defense. Many areas of the U.S.
have accomplished as much in less than a lifetime--despite the American
belief in personal freedom being much greater than that of the English.

There are some things that can derail this trend, though. If the oppressive
government can be driven away, or is destroyed by some disaster, the law
level can rapidly decrease. This needn\'t be permanent, either. For instance,
during the LA Riots and in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, the
government\'s enforcers were unwilling or unable to act, so for the duration
of the crisis citizens effectively lowered the law level by several points.
When the government was able to resume control, things returned to the way
they had been.

Let\'s look at how this applies to a future society--that of Neubayern, about
which I have posted several articles before this.

For most of its history, Neubayern was a democratic society which combined
almost libertarian attitudes about victimless crimes and weapon ownership
(drugs, prostitution legal, no obscenity laws, no laws restricting
ownership of weapons) with socialist welfare and social service programs.
There had been no wars, and only rare instances of severe civil unrest.
Overall, a law level of 0.

About 150 years before the "present," Neubayern was attacked by another star
system. This traumatic experience resulted in a number of changes to
Neubayern\'s society. First, a new \'ruling class\' was created. Entry was
limited to military officers, law enforcement, and a variety of management
types--all of whom had combat training. Only this class was allowed to vote,
although the forms of the government remained as before (something like the
situation in the Zhodani Consulate).

The new leaders wanted to consolidate their power, so (among other things)
they needed to disarm the non-ruling class population--and since the rulers
wanted to maintain their status as a _charismatic_ oligarchy, they had to
make the people _want_ to be disarmed (and lose various other civil rights
at the same time). Searching the history books, they hit upon a scheme which
had worked very well on ancient Terra--they declared a \'War on Drugs.\'

Recreational drugs, which had previously been perfectly acceptable, where
suddenly found by government studies to be the root of all evil. Not only
were these certain drugs the ultimate evil, anyone even remotely associated
with them deserved to suffer any unpleasant fate the government cared to
inflict upon them. 

Over several decades the Neubayern government, with the cooperation of the
media, worked the populace into a state of hysteria over the evil drugs, so
that they were soon actually demanding that the government take away their
civil rights in order to \'make the streets safer.\' In addition, the vast
increase in drug profits caused by their illegality caused the rise of
criminal gangs that would cheerfully kill their rivals (and any bystanders
in the area) in order to expand their territory and profit. This dramatic
increase in crime, in turn, fed further hysteria, which led to tighter
government controls, and higher drug profits. The general public was soon
caught in an escalating upward spiral of hysteria, terror, and government
control.

Within 100 years, civil rights were only guaranteed to members of the ruling
class. The government still couldn\'t just arbitrarily oppress the other
citizens, though--Neubayern\'s long tradition of freedom was still
remembered, if no longer honored. Instead, the government would first
demonize citizens it wanted to oppress. The general public had been
conditioned to believe that the government was perfectly justified in any
action, even murder, as long as the victims were first villified in the
media as drug dealers, pedophiles, or whatever.

At this point, the state of affairs on Neubayern had become nearly identical
to that of certain major American cities today, notably New York and
Washington. The primary difference is in the status of the ruling class. In
those American cities, a very small number of people (U.S. Senators,
billionaires, etc.) can not have their rights ignored, and even they are
restricted--for instance, only the most powerful (such as Senator Kennedy)
were allowed to arm their private soldiers with automatic weapons, and
certainly nothing heavier.

On Neubayern, the ruling class was much larger--a full 10% of the
population. These people had kept their rights entirely intact (largely
because they represented a much wider variety of interests), and so it was
not uncommon for rich members of the ruling class to own military
equipment--some very large companies even owned small warships. At this
point, the law lever for most people was fairly high (9), but unchanged for
the rulers.

This state of affairs would have continued indefinitely, for it was
certainly to the ruling class\' liking, if not for the Imperial invasion. The
government had decided to surrender to the Imperial forces as part of a
strategem to eventually defeat them, but this angered the Neubayern Army,
which believed (with a good deal of justification) that it could have kept
the Imperial Army from conquering the planet for many years.

Following the Cluster Liberation War, the Army\'s high command (who were
around back when Neubayern was peaceful, isolated, and free), commisioned a
study on what whould have happened if the Imperium had invaded a Neubayern
in which the entire populace was still able to own weapons, and backed up by
the Neubayern Army. The study clearly showed that the Imperium could not
possibly have conquered Neubayern in ten years without resorting to nuclear
attacks (which was against Imperial doctrine at the time).

Although Neubayern had emerged from the Occupation in much better shape than
if it had fought, the reults of the study when released caused so much
outrage among the voters of the ruling class that they forgot their earlier
hysteria and desire for power, and restored civil rights to
everyone--lowering the law level to 0 for everyone.

As far as crime rates, Neubayern had very little crime for most of its
history. The War on Drugs caused crime to skyrocket to levels comparable
to modern citys in the American Southwest (the high number of armed
ruling-class kept things from getting as out of hand as they have in New
York and Washington.) --and the two nuclear attacks Neubayern sustained
sent crime totally out of control. During the Occupation, things settled
down to the pre-nuclear attack situation. Imperial forces restricted
ownership of heavy military hardware, but this never had an impact on street
crime anyway. Following the Occupation, when civil rights were restored,
the crime rate dropped away over the following decade to nearly its pre-War
on Drugs level.

Corsairs might take the chance to jump in closer than 100 diameters.
Dangerous, but then the rewards might be considerable.
Plus there is all the in-system traffic between the planets, moons, gas
giant refineries, in-system prisons, research stations, etc.
This might be spread over a considerable distance (in terms of starship
movement rates) and hence is difficult to police for exactly the same
reasons as have been quoted in the "I can jump in a big rock and blam your
planet before you know what\'s happening" and the "I can jump all my ships in
and not worry about going to any gas giants - stuff High Guard" debates.
In-system traffic would, IMHO provide a far greater chance for piracy,
especially since it won\'t tend to have a jump drive and hence the final
emergency option of jumping to safety.

Everyone gets lax. Corsairs can afford to take one-off risks like the
freighter above, because the rewards of capturing another ship are great
financially (especially in the rarer ship environment of TNE). Insider
knowledge (of valuable cargos, naval manouevres, etc.) would be especially
valuable to the corsairs and would help to minimise risks.

So what can the Vargr corsair do to avoid the cruisers, assuming he hasn\'t
caught some in-system traffic several hours travel time from the nearest
navy ship? Might I suggest:
(a) The covert "I\'m an honest merchant" approach, or
(b) The "I\'m using my stealth techniques, your cr*ppy merchant sensors can\'t
see me!", followed by:
(c) Lasing the target\'s commo antennas, or turning on the corsair\'s jammers
(to prevent the target calling for help, confusing its sensors, etc.)
(d) If the cargo is particularly valuable (and resistant to damage) and the
ship is not, just blast the ship until you\'re sure the crew is pulped.
(e) If the navy heads in your direction, turn on the stealth, turn on the
decoys, turn on the jammers, and run for it.

Oh, I forgot to add before (a), Send another corsair somewhere else to
hassle a ship (but keeping its jump drives warm and ready to go) to attract
the attention of the navy in the wrong direction while (a)-(e) above occurs.

THE ANSWER TO LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, AND WHY SDBs HANG OUT IN GAS GIANTS :-)
Naturally, the navy might use equivalent stealth, etc. but it can ill afford
to cover the vastness of space (even given a few limited trade routes
between in-system worlds) by leaving lots of very quite stealthy ships just
sitting there. Ah! Maybe I\'ve finally found a use for those \'tiny\' 400 ton
Systems Defence Boats at last! Additionally, corsairs might well want to
refuel out of the way of normal traffic - i.e. in gas giants - ah ha! So
that\'s why the SDBs hang out there too!

LEGALITIES OF ARMS AND ARMOUR

Jo Grant then talks about why guns and combat armour aren\'t a legal right...

Perhaps true in Ireland - certainly not true in England. The Hungerford
massacre a few years ago indicated just how a \'civilian\' with an interest in
weaponry can get hold of automatic weapons and go on a killing spree.
Licenses for guns are easy to get ("I just need to kill some vermin on a
friend\'s farm") as are licenses for explosives ("We\'re just going to remove
some tree stumps to ease ploughing in this field"). A lot of people are
fascinated by guns. Guns are relatively easy to acquire if you are a weapons
collector, mercenary (yes, they exist in the UK and some of them have locked
basements full of GENUINE machine guns, mortars, etc.), sports shooter,
hunter (big game or ala "Let\'s blow away some innocent little grouse") or A
CRIMINAL. I live near Harlow, Essex, England. I used to rent a room in
Harlow. My landlord had a scar right down one side of his face from where
someone used a knife on him. He knew people who walked up and down the
streets outside carrying loaded pistols - not for burglary specifically,
just for \'protection\' or whatever. This street was one block from the town
centre shops and only two blocks from the local police station. The
increased use of weapons - real and replica - by criminals has led to an
increased number of armed officers being regularly deployed on the streets
(not as foot patrols but to deal with specific incidents).
I\'ll let you conclude just how difficult it is to get weapons, legally or
illegally. And I haven\'t even mentioned the IRA yet... but then they\'re good
boys now, aren\'t they?

Ironically, of course, the whole discussion started about battledress and
combat armour which are totally different to the above discussion because
normally people with illegal weapons at least have the decency to conceal
them. Wearing b\'dress, etc. is a definite no-no in my games because it\'s
just so bleeding obvious! :-)

Over here (UK), if you harm a trespasser, he\'d better have been standing

(preferably having raped your wife, beaten up your children, etc.).
IF NOT, he\'s the one who will be suing you in court because you kicked him
in the groin and now he\'s suffering mental stress because he can\'t be the
full male father figure he\'s always wanted.
Better still, if you kill him, you\'ll be the one in court on a murder

I SHOULD KNOW - I\'m a black belt in karate and have spent a lot of time
resolving what I should do if I ever have to use my skills to defend myself
in a life or death situation. Let\'s just say that there\'s only one sure way
of ensuring my opponent doesn\'t turn up in court claiming that he was only
carrying the burglary tools for a friend, broke into my house because he
thought he heard someone calling for help, was grappling with my wife
because she seemed hysterical and that I then needlessly broke several of
his limbs without due cause. 

THIS SHOULD BE A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR PLAYERS thinking about owning
armour or weapons, especially if they\'re going to use them. Several years in
jail really kills a character\'s playability.

More importantly, JUSTICE SUCKS, especially now the UK lawyers have seen
just how much cr*p the judicial system will accept on compensation claims,
etc. ala US courts, OJ "it\'s a joke trial really" Simpson, etc.

What happens when the players are attacked by someone but don\'t kill them?
If the person has a good lawyer, contacts in the judicial system, etc. it
could the players who are being tracked by the police... no matter that the
guy was a drugs smuggler, etc. Justice ala Columbia, etc.

    'body' => 'Oh, and while we\'re on the subject of limiting weapons, etc. I would like to
paraphrase (to save space) a certain Mr. Metlay\'s comments from 1990 (TML
Message #964, Thu, 8 Feb 90 19:41 EST, From: METLAY@vms.cis.pitt.edu):

When "Stref was still kicking and lawnorder prevailed Throughout Our Fair
Kingdom", the Imperial government had a vested interest in maintaining peace
and quiet and therefore prohibited people from GETTING any of the really
balance-wrecking weapons. Those who broke the rules were hunted down and
summary justice applied by the authorities, who enjoy the concept of
citizens with high energy weapons and rigid armor about as much as the DEA
enjoys the concept of drug smugglers having easy access to shoulder-launched
missiles and heavy machine guns. The advantage the Imperium has over the
current US in this case is that the Imperium has no legal, moral or ethical
obligation not to go in shooting, with heavier guns than the bad guys have.
Arms suppliers are usually a hunted breed for similar reasons, unless they
"follow the rules" and keep good records and check licenses.

This generally restricted the average Traveller to TL10 weapons and armour -
no Gauss, high energy weapons or combat armour or battle dress.

Metlay notes that "The improvement in game quality was amazing: if all you
have is an ACR and a combat environment suit, you tend to think harder and
plan more carefully before you start shooting, despite the fact that you
know the people you\'ll be fighting are no better off than you are, normally.
Firefights were significantly fewer and further between, and carried an
element of real risk in them: the armor/weapon balance at TL 10 is such that
(at least under the old rules) you could take a hit, or even two, and hold
body and soul together for a few more rounds before passing out, adding to
the drama and excitement of the game. Since I was fortunate enough to be
dealing with sensible and mature gamers in most instances, parties were
quick to recognize the element of risk and fun this added to the game, and
followed policy with thankfully little whining from people who felt
emasculated without a giant, plasma-shooting phallic symbol on hand."
(Just couldn\'t resist quoting that verbatim)

In the Shattered Imperium, these regulations are more difficult to enforce
so weapons and armour MAY be available, but obviously the bad guys also have
anything they want.

He suggests alternative ways to keep this stuff out of the players\' hands:

(1) Cost. High-tech guns cost a lot, are difficult to find and at low TL are
over-sized and poorly built.
(2) Maintenance. A revolver can lie in a drawer unused and untouched for
literally years and yet come up firing at a moment\'s notice. One TL up from
that, though, we have the autopistol, which is much more inclined to be
finicky if it\'s dropped, not kept clean, not handled and oiled often, or
even fed the wrong sort of supposedly-fine ammo. Machine guns are for the
most part even more
complex, and so on up the ladder. Modernisation (TLs above the minimum for
the weapon) will increase reliability, etc. but only to a point.
Clearly Gauss and Hi-E weapons involve high precision mechanics,
micro-electronics, electrical factors (high power), computers (assisted
sights, control of fusion reaction, etc.). The military designs (at high TL)
must be fairly rugged or the Imperial forces wouldn\'t use them. But these
weapons must be maintained and serviced on a regular basis. According to the
rules in
Mercenary (CT Book 4), a HiE weapon must be completely disassembled and
serviced once every 24 hours. Even given "modernisation", the service time
will still be days or a week. Given these are basically small nuclear
reactors you can\'t just open them up on the workbench in the engine room of
your ship! Armouries at TL12+ are among the best-equipped and specialist
shops in history! Gauss weapons are an easier proposition but still require
considerable maintenance.
Note that the same problems hold for Battle Dress, whereas one can get away
with Combat Armour in a pinch since it doesn\'t have powerpack problems.
(3) The "ice factor." In a given campaign... "it might be considered common
for starfarers to wear pistols of some kind in their day-to-day activities.
However, the carrying of rifles is frowned upon, since a longarm isn\'t
usually something you\'re keeping handy for self-defence in an emergency. If
a party is transporting precious cargo, bodyguarding, or doing other
high-risk work, then passersby who recognize this tend to treat such parties
with respect. However, the average guy who goes out with rigid armor, a
Gauss or HiE rifle, or both, for no good reason other than to "be ready for
trouble," is going to attract scorn and derision from those around him, if
in fact he isn\'t arrested or simply shot from behind as a risk to pedestrian
traffic. He\'s obviously either a criminal, a sociopath, or a stupid showoff,
all of which make him too dangerous to leave at large. These items, with
their connotations of Imperial force and heedless crushing of resistance,
will inspire nobody. You won\'t get hired as a starmerc if you walk into your
interview armed that way; you\'ll be considered too stupid to be a safe
employee!

>Corsairs might take the chance to jump in closer than 100 diameters.

As far as I remember the principles of jumpspace, a ship is automatically thrown
out of jumpspace at a distance of more than 100 diameters of a solid body, if
 an attempt is made to emerge from jumpspace inside the 100-diameters limit.

I don\'t quite remember, where the rules says this, but a good guess would be
Starship Operators Manual.

While the corsairs thus can\'t jump in closer than 100 diameters, they could may
be sneak in using EMM and EMS-jammers, attack ships in this area, and make a
(risky) jump if threatened.

I hate to jump in (ha, ha), but I need to double check this.  Our solar =

pirates out of the system, we would need one of those cruisers for each =
planet, and a few spares so the ships and crews could rotate every six =
months or so.
Assuming the 200 or so worlds near the Vargr boarder, each with 10 or so =
planets, and some of these systems would have less people in them then =
the cruisers protecting them.
Now, examine the cost of maintaining this blockade against the cost of =
loosing a some 200 to 400 ton displacement vessels every year.  I hate to =
sound mercenary, but to a sector spaning government, loosing a few =
citizens every year to pirates would be cost effective.
Imagine how much crime would be cut down if every street corner in New =

In an old Amber Zone, they even had a shipping firm making profit by =
surrendering to Pirates in an insurance scam.  This can\'t be that rare an =
idea. 
Next, add jump mechanics.  Just making certain you are close to the =

On the psychology of wearing protection, a personal opinion:  

 I teach high school in Metro Toronto (population 2.5 million, plus another
1-1.5 million in surrounding suburbs), the city in Canada that most closely
resembles an American city.  We are beginning to get the same types of
problems that are common on the American news programs (drive-by shootings,
gangs/guns in schools, etc.)  

I have contemplated wearing kevlar, but have decided not to.  Why?  Because
is it looks like I\'m ready for trouble, some hormone-hopped adolescent kid
will give it to me.  This goes double for carrying an offensive weapon.  I am
much safer when I look like I\'m outside the threat-counterthreat dominance
game.  


Asbestos warning: I\'m not claiming (or even trying to imply) that all
American schools (and cities) look like they do on CNN.  Hey, when LA rioted
CNN interspersed shots of a few vandalized Toronto blocks with shots of
burning LA buildings - and it looked like Toronto was in flames.  (Actual
damage was very slight, less than that caused by partiers after the World
Series.)  However, I\'m assuming that the CNN view of America will be the one
most familiar to those living outside the States.

Some relevant, contemporaneous quotes.  The following are excerpts from
President George Washington\'s address to the Second Session of the First
Congress of the United States of America.

   "Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself.
 
   "They are the American People\'s liberty teeth and keystone under
    independence.   The church, the plow, the prairie wagon and 
    citizen\'s firearms are indelibly related.
 
   "From the hour the Pilgrims landed, to the present day, events, 
    occurrences, and tendencies prove that to insure peace, security,
    and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispensable.
 
   "Every corner of this land knows firearms, and more than 99 & 99/100
    percent of them, by their silence, indicate they are in safe and 
    sane hands.
 
   "The very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere restrains 
    evil interference--they deserve a place of honor with all that\'s good.
 
   "When firearms go, all goes--we need them every hour."

It is highly interesting to compare and contrast this with the rhetoric
being generated by our current President and Congressional leaders.

A highly interesting article in the Washington Post described an interesting
reason for this.  The Post\'s reporter was examining an increasing trend
toward violence, particularly in television.  Several sources in the
entertainment industry cited the increasing EXPORT (ie: non-US) market as
driving this trend. 

According to the story, non-US markets for US entertainment are now large
enough that the industry (and particularly the segments of it that produce
syndicated television shows) consider the overseas salability of a product
to be the key to profitability.  Assuming that US revenues cover production
costs and perhaps a bit more, overseas sales represent pure profit, for
little or no additional investment.

The keys to export-market salability are (you guessed it) sex and violence.
Unlike intricate plotting, witty dialog, or (usually topical or US-centric)
humor, these two concepts are fairly universally understood, and easy to
translate to differnt languages and even cultures.  Try an experiment
sometime - turn the sound way off (or way down) and see which shows you can
still follow without the dialog, and which you can\'t.

On the other hand, wouldn\'t MegaTraveller\'s Rebellion have been a _lot_ more
interesting if it had been plotted along the lines of the English Civil War?

Wouldn\'t the Collapse have been more interesting had its writers actually
studied the Sack of Rome, and used that as a model for the Vargr raiders?

However, to get back to the topic at hand, I have refereed a number of
Traveller games, with different styles of campaigns.  In at least one
campaign I could think of, the player-characters owned Battle Dress  Of
course, as members of a mercenary company, they _needed_ it for their
primary business (of course, they were usually smart enough to leave the
armor at \'work\' when they went on R&R - the time that they didn\'t culminated
in several arrests).

On the other hand, there were plenty of characters in other campaigns where
the only time they saw battledress was on the tridee screen in the news
reports from Efate.

I teach high school in an inner-city high school in Philadelphia.  No offense
taken.  :)  As you pointed out, the media tends to emphasize the bad but
never makes a good deal about the good things.  My school has its share of
problems, but we aren\'t the worst (although the media may make us think so at
times).

Personally I would never wear any kind of body armor or bring any kind of
weapon to school.  I think it would just put me into situations that just
ask for trouble.
   Applying this to Traveller :), if the characters don\'t have weapons or
armor to save their butts, they\'re going to do whatever they can to avoid
those situations that make them a neccessity.  Five characters with at best
a couple of pocketknives between them are going to give some heed to the
gentleman with the combat armor and ACR who says "Halt, show me your hall
pass" (Sorry, school-on-the-brain :).

Just my two cents...IMHO, YMMV, etc. :)

Actually, there need not be. I used the single 30,000 T Cruiser because we
have figures for how much they cost and how much the Imperial Naval budget
is, but I don\'t really think that would be the way a world was defended. As
I said in an earlier posting, orbital fortresses with fighter crafts is what
I would expect.

Ah, but that\'s one of the things that are fixed. Well, not the exact number
of ships, but the total budget. Using CT figures (which are the ones I can
remember off-hand), a planet with ten million citizens has a military 
budget of 5,000,000,000 Credit (5000 MCr). Of this 15% goes to the subsector
forces and 15% goes to the regular navy. 70% (3500 MCr) goes to the local
planetary defense forces. That gives them a fleet bought for ten times the
yearly budget, or 35,000 MCr. That\'s 350 SDBs or a light cruiser or several
orbital fortresses with several fighter squadrons. You can scale that up
for worlds with populations 8, 9 amd 10 yourself.

But what about those worlds with less people I hear you ask. Well, they
will have to rely on the subsector forces (since we can\'t be sure that
the regular fleet isn\'t off somewhere fighting Zhodani). But the subsector
forces are based on the revenue derived from all the worlds, most especially
the High-population worlds. On the average each subsector will have one
Population A and two Population 9 planets. They may not be the ones with the
highest tech level, so their tax credit may not be worth a whole Imperial
credit each. But unless the worlds are really low-tech their money will be
worth, say, 25% to put it low. So the budget will easily reach 375,000 MCr
for a subsector fleet worth 3,750,000 MCr. That\'s an awful lot of ships.

What makes you think they won\'t? My impression of governments, based on my
historical knowledge, is that they hardly ever takes any crap from anyone
weaker than themselves. I cite the case of the way the US dealt with the
Barbary States as an example, because I think that\'s exactly the way the
Imperium would deal with the Vargr. In fact, it\'s the lynchpin of my
argument. If the Corsairs can rely on secure port facilities at friendly
nearby planets, then they are indeed viable. But it would take, not one,
but multible generations of singularily incompetent Admirals to have let 
them get away with it for so long.

Lot\'s of historical examples of large nations that left their weaker
neighbours alone (as long as the neighbours didn\'t make a nuisance of
themselves). After all, just because you can do something dosen\'t mean
you are prepared to pay the price. Conquering and occupying a Vargr
state would take a lot more ressources than blowing their spaceport
apart every time you got raided by a Vargr Corsair. Pretty soon the
Vargr government begins to hunt down the Corsairs themselves to avoid
that.

That\'s like pointing out that the runner-up of the heavy-weight boxing
championships gave the winner a run for his money, so why couldn\'t a
bantam do the same? Have a look at the map in "Cogs&Dogs" and you\'ll see
that the Vargr border states are quite a lot smaller than the Solomani
Confederation and the Zhodani Consulate.

Can\'t do that according to the rules.

As I pointed out earlier I\'m not talking about the odd 400 T Corsair. They
have their own problems, notably the fact that while there may not be
enough 30,000 T cruisers to protect all the places where they can find
appropiate prey, they can be dealt with by much smaller ships. If you
think the Imperium can afford an awful lot of cruisers then you\'ll be
amazed at how many "Gazelle" Class Escorts they can afford. But what I\'ve
been tlking about is those 30,000 T Corsairs that appear in the
Megatraveller material. A pirate ship is a business. They need to make
a profit appropiate to the expenses incurred. 30,000 T ships are 
expensive to run. Furthermore, such a ship needs the support of a big 
shipyard. Such shipyards can be discouraged from supporting them. The 
Imperium has the wherewithal to do the discouraging.

But it\'s the military grade sensors you need to avoid. Btw. what stealth
techniques? AFAIK there are no stealth techniques in the Traveller rules.
That\'s one of the would-be pirates\' big problems. If there are I will 
certainly revise my stance. Sufficiently effective stealth techniques will 
indeed lift the pirate survival rate into the realm of the possible. It 
will also affect straight naval battles profoundly.

You can rule out Mercury and Venus. They are withing the Sun\'s 100 diameter
limit. The various moons are propably within their respective planets\' 100
diameter limits. Then you\'re assuming that there are people near every
planet. OK, if there are then we need 7 or 8 cruisers (or their equivalent
in orbital fortresses or whatever). That\'s still within the Imperial Navy 
budget.

To start with most of those planets wouldn\'t have anything worth protecting

I grant you that. But loosing what you need to support running a 30,000 T

I can see that I will have to work out exact figures for the cost of running 
a pirate ship. But remember that that cost is only one part of the whole 
problem.

BTW. Under the TNE rules most insystem craft will have jump drives. It\'s
faster and cheaper to jump most interplanetary distances.

OK, so now that the latest empire-crushing blow, the Virus,
has been dealt, how does it compare to the last such event,
the "Long Night".

Presumably the Long Night was a big deal, but what really happened?
(OK, I could go look this up, so don\'t quote source material back
at me. But \'everyone just stopped using starships\' seems rather
lame.) And can the effects of the Long Night still be felt in the
modern/post-modern Imperium?

For example,

The First Imperium had a high level of cultural homogenity. Vilani
culture was the rule. Minor human races had local influence, if any.

The Second Imperium was more turbulent, but still a mixture of
two distinct cultures, Vilani and Solomani. In the First and
Second Imperia, you could go between planets and not notice a huge
change in basic culture, I\'d assume. (Which is to say, you can go
between Toronto, Manchester and Taipei today and find the same 
basic culture. They don\'t eat their children, the same basic set
of laws exists, dress is largely the same, with regional differences
and influences of past local cultures. Maybe the Imperium would be 
even more uniform than this.)


BUT - during the Long Night preceding the Third Imperium, a lot of
worlds would have developed very distinct cultures, local dialects
and various unique attributes. They had a long time to do so and
a long time to let the new culture settle in. There was very little
to change them, especially considering the overall trend of 
technological stagnation, where technological change is (arguably)
the prime motivator for the pace of modern Terran change.

So - by the 1100\'s, can these regionalisms still be felt, seen, heard?

(I put this out because a lot of source material gives me the impression 
that worlds in the Imperium are quite diverse - yet some of the
discussion I\'ve seen on this list would point the Imperium in the opposite
direction - a rather homogenous place.)

    'body' => '
Tobia is a tech-15 industrial world of twenty billion, with a 
first-class starport and naval base, ten field armies equipped to
Imperial standards, and is seemingly the last world which might fall
to the massive wave of Aslan immigrants that occurred in the first two
years of the Rebellion.  So how\'d the Aslan end up in control of it 
and all the Imperial territory "behind the claw" rimward of Gazulin?

To start with, I\'m going to take the view that the "As" allegiances in
the Imperial Encyclopedia are wrong.  Why?  I think they make more sense
as indicating worlds that picked up an Aslan population but that stayed
under Domain control.  DGP\'s maps and UWPs for 1120 seem more plausible,
and they\'re repeated more.  By this view, the Domain only lost control 
of Sindal and Tobia subsectors, and Duchess Sharikkamur is able to draw 
the line at Gazulin.  

Can the Aslan even get these two subsectors?  I think so.  The regular
navy is gone, sent to spinward by Duke Alexander under the old Frontier
War emergency mobilization plan.  That leaves the colonials, probably
a sorry collection of tech-14 or worse hulks over a century old, maybe
augmented by some tech-10 or so local builds.  The subsectors both seem
to hinge on only two worlds.  The tech-14 naval base at Albe/Sindal 
probably supports the tiny 1203rd Fleet; the sector capital at Tobia
the 1204th Fleet.  These worlds are key industrial worlds with high
populations and first-class ports; nothing else nearby quite compares
to them.  I get the impression that the local colonial fleet wasn\'t very 
good, because Tobia is far to the "rear" of the expected fighting in a 
Frontier War.  In any case, as the only big tech-15 ship-building world 
this side of Trin, Tobia will need to use it\'s resources to support the 
regular navy, not the colonials.  The Imperial fleets will have only one 
tech-level on the ihatei, maybe less.

It turns out that the table in Rebellion Sourcebook about "Expected
Force Strength on World" gives results identical to the figures for
static defense forces in the old Fifth Frontier War board game.  Then 
both Albe and Tobia have ten field armies equipped to Imperial standards 
(TL-14/15) for local defense.  This is *very* impressive by 5FW standards.  

The Imperium could easily miss the significance of the Aslan raids on
the Glorious Empire, since they\'d been expecting the Tlaukhu or some
Aslan clan with initiative to move on the anti-Tlaukhu Aslan splinter
state for a long time.  But Tobia is just six parsecs from the Imperial
border.  A military invasion could be on them before they have time to
realize that some of the Aslan are up to something.

The Imperium may also be slow to recognize a threat from the Aslan,
both because there\'s been peace with them since long before the First 
Frontier War, and because they\'ve been good trading partners and some
have been immigrating for a long time; their first thoughts when there\'s
trouble will be to talk with the offending clans to figure out what\'s
the problem, not prepare for an onslaught.  And since the region is a
frontier, Aslan colonists may actually be welcome in controlled doses. 

Let\'s say that the Aslan factions that claim the Peace of Ftahalr is 
void can assemble a fairly large fleet, including an "AssaultRon" or
two worth of colony ships.  It shouldn\'t be hard, since one of those 
colony ships from Rebellion Sourcebook could carry a lift infantry
brigade.  They can get to Tobia from outside Imperial space from the
rift side in three jumps, and without running into serious resistance
from the low tech worlds en route -- those are bypassed, and the fleet
refuels at subsidiary gas giants.

In the battle at Tobia, I think that if they throw in everything that
they have, a handful of Aslan clans could gain control of Tobian local
space.  If this happens, the Aslan "ScoutRons" and "CruRons" (actually
Aslan hryo are mixed units, but anyway...) and anything else can now 
start to bombard the surface.  The Aslan may take serious damage in
this phase, but it\'s reasonable that they prevail.

Gazulin can be notified by fleet courier in two weeks, but there isn\'t
anything there that can help.  To get notice to Trin by fleet courier
and have a fleet respond at jump-4 would take ten weeks; four to get 
news there, and six for the fleet to get to Tobia.  That\'s with zero
time refueling on the way.

By 5FW, if the Aslan have "24 bombardment factors", about two CruRons
and four ScoutRons equipped for bombardment, there won\'t be anything
*left* of the ground forces after ten weeks of orbital bombardment.  
Admittedly, the Aslan really don\'t want to mess up Tobia this much, 
since they want to colonize.  So they offer the Tobians a chance to
surrender, which Duke Alexander takes, and the Aslan land a handful 
of occupying divisions.  Trouble is, this frees up the rest of the
fleet to go reinforce the attack on Albe, and it\'s likely that some
high tech Tobian equipment falls into Aslan hands....  Meanwhile, the 
Imperials are so distracted defending Tobia and Albe that all sorts of 
assorted Aslan colonists, many completely uninvolved, sweep into the 
area with only token resistance at best. 

The lack of a decent Imperial naval force in the area is then directly
responsible for the failure of the defense.  Tobia\'s field armies make
much more of a difference if the Aslan are forced to rush the landing. 

I\'m not saying that Tobia necessarily fell this way in the game, they
may just have been overwhelmed by the flood of peaceful settlers.  But
the point is that a military attack on part of the Trojan Reach by the
Aslan could work.

    So, anyway, imagine you are arming this ship.  30 beam lasers will
cost you MCr30.  30 Missile launchers will cost you MCr22.5.  Quite
a lot of cash to have on hand, eh?  And if you have the cash, you can 
arm the ship.
    Why you would want to, we\'re not sure.  If you have MCr30 laying 
around loose, RETIRE!  YOu\'re RICH ALREADY, you d@#$ fool mutt!  Hell,
SELL the Oberlindes liner to someone else for a quarter what it\'s worth.
That\'ll bring you another MCr100 or so.  Then you\'re REALLY RICH!
    But, let\'s assume you were stupid enough to really want to waste
MCr30 to "get rich quick" by being a pirate...
    So, you\'ve spent the money.  Now find some prey.  Note a few key
guidelines here:  Your typical merchant ship is worth maybe MCr50 or
so NEW.  After you put a hole or two in it, it is worth a lot less.
Most likely, it\'s cargo is not worth beans (less than a million, most
likely).  Note that an M-drive hit (the most likely severe hit in MT)
will cost you around MCr10 to repair.  A power plant or J-drive hit
(fairly likely in CT) will cost you three or four times as much.
    So, if you capture a ship, taking one good hit in the process, you
break even.  Assuming you don\'t damage the prize too much, anyway.;-)
    Keep in mind here that if you run into an Impy heavy fighter
(50T, 9fib computer, 3 missile launchers), it\'ll tear you to pieces.
Just one of them.

    So, you just traded MCr30 (in cash), and a ship worth MCr400+, for
the life of a pirate.  Where you MAY break even, if you are reasonably
lucky.  And where the very first time you find yourself within 300,000
Km of an Impy heavy fighter, you die...

    The B-17 was not the first bomber to bomb the German heartlands.  
Germany was bombed by the Brits for years before we even got involved
in that affair.  Wellingtons and/or Lancasters were used first.  From
what I have read of history, Goering stupidly thought that the Brits
would leave German civilians alone as long as the Germans left Brit
civilians alone.  His mistake.

    You\'re mistaken.  Impy pop is around 15 trillion.  Assuming TCS 
figures (with minimal mods), and assuming 5% of total naval budget in
the Imperium alocated to the Fleets, you can afford around 100,000 of
those 30,000T cruisers Hans is so fond of.
    Note also that a population of 250,000 can afford to maintain half
a dozen heavy fighters in their local system squadrons.

    Why assume this?  There is only one case I know of mentioned in 
"official" Impy history - Tarkine.  Which was an extra-Imperial planet
which acted as a base for local pirates operating in the nearby Impy
worlds.  The Impies got tired of that, and took over the planet, 
replaced the government, and shut the operation down.

    Overpowering is relative.  Overpowering relative to any band of
Vargr raiders can be achieved with one Tigress.  It takes a little more
than that to "overpower" the Solomani Confederation... ;-)

    I am.  "Less organized" does not begin to describe the Vargr.  The
largest Vargr government I remember is less than a sector in size
(excluding the Julian Protectorate).  Most are no more than a few dozen
worlds.  Sort of like the Sword Worlds fighting the Imperium.  A joke,
in other words.  Getting several HUNDRED Vargr governments to act in a
coordinated fashion is even more unlikely than getting humans to do it.

    I love this kind of thought!  Or lack of it.  "But it says so in the
book! <whimper>"


    NOTE:  I learned about piracy the hard way, WAY back when Trav first
came out.  The very first thing we did in our first Trav game was to steal
two
ships (plus an Impy Scout one of us got as a "going out of business" 
gift), and take them across the "border" (pretty nebulous border, since
none of us knew anything about the Imperium, including the GM).  We
sold them, bought ourselves a tough ship to raid with, spent a lot of
money setting up a base, then went out to hit on the "easy merchants"...
    Fat chance!  The very first ship we hit on got ONE (1) hit on us.
We took it.  We sold it (in ruins, because we couldn\'t afford to repair
it).  We sold our base.  Then we put a second mortgage on our ship to
pay to repair it.
    Then we tried again.  This next one was easy.  We made enough to
pay off that second mortgage.  Stupidly, we tried for three.  The third
one hit us four times, doing a total of MCr100 in damage.  Our first
effective hit knocked out its power plant, so we captured it almost
intact.  It STILL didn\'t pay to repair our ship.  So we fed the character
who thought of piracy (mine, btw :-) ) into a blender, and left the
planet (and the unrepaired pirateship) behind, never to be seen again.
    We never looked back (except for a lot of jokes about the "blender
murders", of course ;-) )...

    Hmmm...I\'m American, but it seems to me that the people of
Bosnia might disagree with you, Jo.  Likewise, Haiti, Croatia,
Somalia, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon...
    And if you want to go back a little farther in time, then
perhaps we might consider most of Europe under Nazi Germany,
or the Pacific under Imperial Japan.
    Still farther back, we have England (and Ireland) during
and after the English Civil War, Europe in general during the
30 Years War, most of Eurasia under the Mongols.
    Must I go on?  Wherever there are bad guys with weapons
(and governments can be "bad guys with weapons"), the good guys
better have them too.  And they\'d better be willing to use them.
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good
men to do nothing."

    Consider also:  a year or two back, a German tourist was
murdered in Florida.  When the young snothead that killed him
was caught, he was asked why he went after a tourist.  The
answer - "because tourists got a lot of cash, and don\'t got
no guns."
    It seems that the logic "if you have no gun, I won\'t kill
you" doesn\'t work unless I am awfully nice.  And if I\'m
that nice, why am I trying to rob/rape/assault people
all the time, eh?

    What about those lads shooting at the Brits in Northern
Ireland?  Where are they getting them from?
    And if the criminals _can\'t_ get them, why is it that
only "most (but not all) of the criminals don\'t have guns"?
My personal worst nightmare would be an environment where
only the criminals (even only SOME of them) have guns.

    Funny, I never saw that phrase when I read the Second
Amendment.  Is that like the Irish rule that says "Don\'t
shoot \'em, blow up their kids instead"?  A farcical state-
ment, but no more so than yours, Jo...

    Note also that I do not consider the disarmament of 
Ireland to be an example of their civilization.  It seems
to me that a civilized society should not fear to allow 
ANYONE to be armed.  I personally believe that there is
currently only one really civilized society on this planet,
and it ain\'t the USA (not anymore, it isn\'t), it\'s Switzer-
land.  In Switzerland, every adult male gets to (HAS to)
keep an assault rifle (a REAL one, not the silly things that
our Congress, in its infinite wisdom, decided to ban last
year) in his home.  The crime rate is as low as Ireland\'s,
I believe - one of you Swiss can check me on that, if there
are any Swiss on this list...

    And isn\'t it interesting how few terrorist acts have ever
happened in either the USA or Switzerland?  As opposed to 
England, Northern Ireland, Germany, Italy, other European
places with tight gun laws?

    Quite so.  Blowing up Vargr starports is one of the activities we
included under the heading "Raid" in the advanced Naval character design
sequence.  Things like that happen pretty frequently, based on the 
chances of doing at least one during your naval career (virtually
certain, really)....

    Well, no.  You could get by with one per world actually used.  I
can\'t think of a whole lot of uses for most of them, frankly.
    You don\'t have to worry too much about rotating ships, since if the
world is in use, it will have R&R facilities, and the crews can spend 
time groundside.  Two crews per ship work pretty well in our boomer
fleet, btw.  Note that one cruiser per planet works out to about
10,000 crewcritters per system.  Not really a very big Navy, actually.

    1)  Maybe 20 of those worlds are really important to the Imperium.
Maybe 80 if them are so worthless that noone will care whether the Vargr
hit them.  So let\'s assign 20 cruisers (3 CruRons) to each system, anyway.
That amounts to 4000 Cruisers.  15 gigapeople can pay for the cruisers,
and there are 20 worlds with more than a billion people.  PLENTY of people,
plenty of taxes.
    On the other hand, assume you use your plan - everyone is on their own
against the pirates.  Great plan, saves a lot on Navy budgets, I admit.
How are you going to cinvince the people on the unprotected worlds to
pay their taxes?  I sure as shooting (which I would be doing to tax-
collectors in that system) wouldn\'t be paying any taxes to any Impies
without some tangible benefits.  And the benefit being the privilege of
being Vargr-chow doesn\'t count for much with me.

    What a wonderful government you envision here!  Sort of modern, eh?
I prefer the Teddy Roosevelt version myself.
    Note, btw, that that particular attitude would have resulted in the
Nazis winning WW2.  After all, American interests were not really being

    We have very little crime in our neighborhood.  But then, in our

    Jump is defined as being accurate enough to land within 3000Km of the
target point.  Since the cruiser can obliterate anything within 300,000Km,
there\'s plenty of room for error....
    Note that it doesn\'t actually take a "highly trained navigator" to
make a jump accurately.  A pretty crappy navigator makes it 97 times out

    Okay, how?  Your sensors are only good for 8 light seconds.  IF they
are milspec sensors.  Out in deep space between worlds, the targets are
moving FAST!  Much faster than you are likely to be moving when you leave
a world.  Catching them means matching orbits, which means spending a lot
of time near them.  And face it, you notice a ship trying to match orbits
with you halfway to Jupiter, call Terra, ask them if its one of theirs,
and call on the cavalry if it isn\'t.  And evade like mad until help 
arrives.

This may not be the place to bring this up, but I can\'t think of anywhere
else I\'d be likely to get an answer.

I\'ve often wondered about this.  The history books say the Brits
"accidently" bombed a civilian area of a German city due to a navigational
error.  The Germans responded in kind and bombing civilians during a war
suddenly became the in vogue thing to do.

Is that how it really happened, or did the victors rewrite history in their
image?

The main thing I\'ve noticed in the whole gun debate in the U.S. is that
the gun-ban folks frequently break the #1 rule in statistics:  Correlation
does not imply causation.  Even the Seattle-Vancouver study which was
widely touted as a very well done study was wildly misquoted in papers and
by advocates.  All it found was that there was a correlation between
homicides and the number of guns.  That means the homicides could be due to
the proliferation of guns (A causes B), that the proliferation of guns was
due to high homicides (B causes A), that there was a third agent causing
the homicides and the proliferation of guns (C causes A and B), or that the
correlation was just a coincidence (A and B are not related).  Yet most of
the quotes I saw focused only on the first possibility, and some headlines
even said things like "Study Finds Guns Cause Homicides."

This is also a problem in the widely claimed statistic that owning a gun at
home makes you more likely to get shot.  Until recently all that studies
found was a correlation between gun ownership and deaths.  The overwhelming
conclusion in the media was that this meant you were more likely to die if
you bought a gun.  The far more likely conclusion in my opinion was that
this just meant people who lived in more dangerous areas were more likely
to buy guns.  The most recent study I\'ve seen accounted for this and found
that independent of the crime rate in your area, owning a gun made you more
likely to get killed by your own gun than a criminal\'s.  Something like
twice as likely, not the 5 times widely quoted (the remaining 3x I presume
would be due to my conclusion mentioned above, meaning my conclusion is
"more" right :-).  Unfortunately, it didn\'t break up those killed into
those who bothered to train and practice with a gun, and those who just
bought a gun without ever learning anything about safety.  I think that\'s
as careless as lumping unlicensed and drunk driver fatality statistics in
with those for licensed drivers.  Would you want your car insurance rates
determined that way?

BTW, I don\'t like guns.  I don\'t own one, I don\'t plan to buy one.  I\'ve
never fired anything more than a BB gun.  And I think the NRA is doing gun
owners a great disservice in many of its extremist positions (opposing
licensing of gun stores!?).  I just hate it when people abuse statistics
for their political gain.  And I think if they want to change the 2nd
Amendment, they should do it the correct way -- with another Constitutional
Amendment.  It\'s sad the double standard many organizations have when it
comes to protecting the 1st Amendment vs. the 2nd Amendment.  "Times
change, what the country\'s forefathers were thinking when they made the
2nd Amendment doesn\'t apply anymore."  With the Internet, desktop
publishing, and the huge effect the media has on society, you could say the
same thing about the 1st Amendment.

How does all this relate to Traveller?  Well, most of it doesn\'t.  :-)
Just be careful when you start using statistics to figure out the effect of
law level.  For the most part stay away from newspaper and news magazine
articles except to find references to research.  If you bother to dig up
the original research papers, you\'ll find most of them know the #1 rule and
state in their conclusion that all they found was a correlation.

For the US, I think that has more to do with it being a bigger country
requiring you to run futher if you want to get out.  It\'s also halfway
around the world from most of the world\'s political hot spots.  If you
were going to blow up a building, would you rather be a half hour plane
trip or an 8 hour plane trip from a country offering political assylum?

For Switzerland, it\'s probably because they\'ve been neutral in just about
everything.  And everyone likes their chocolate.  :-)

I know this is off the subject of the list.  However, I think its the 
other way around.  A German bomber accidently drop its bombs on London 
during the Blitz, and England responded by bombing Berlin.

Actually, since Darrian computers don\'t seem to use silicon chips at
all, I don\'t see how Virus would have any effect on them at all. Of course,
since Virus is apparently magic anyway, you never know. :-)

An interesting theory. Some problems with it:

1. If you\'re wearing armour heavy enough to be visible, you\'ll get trouble
from the police long before you get it from anyone else (unless cops in
Ontario are much nicer than the ones in California).

2. American police routinely wear armour. Criminals rarely got out of their
way to give _them_ trouble. :-)

3. There was a study of U.S. criminals (by Wright and Rossi, I believe)
which showed that criminals will avoid victims who they believe may be
armed, and in fact are more afraid of encountering an armed citizen than the
police.

And:

Unfortunately, this is probably a safe assumption. Non-US citizens should
keep in mind that the US media often does not accurately represent life in
America. In fact, when crime and firearms are concerned, the US media is
_never_ accurate.

Not at all. I carry a weapon fairly often, and I am not even remotely prone
to put myself into such situations. Anyone who would unnecessarily do so is
either crazy or stupid--an US media reports to the contrary, carrying a
weapon doesn\'t make people crazy or stupid.

Further, even people who _do_ carry weapons and armour and put themselves
into dangerous situations (i.e. soldiers and police) do so as little as
possible.

Well, you\'d be right there. Carrying a weapon on school ground is _very_
illegal. The government wants to ensure that if a madman decides to murder
children at a school, the faculty and staff is unable to prevent it.

Generally, in Traveller and other games, I often give players access to
large amounts of firepower. However, their ability to actually use it is
severely restrained by law, diplomacy, and common sense. If a player wants
to walk around in battledress with an FGMP, that\'s okay with me, but he\'d
better hope that the dozens of even-more-heavily-armed SWAT officers he\'ll
be meeting shortly don\'t have a \'shoot on sight\' policy. :-)

True. I\'m somewhat happy to see an arguement arise on a topic I know

Isn\'t this more due to the ease of controling entry/exit to the US rather 
than "gun control"?

What about all these incidents of "terrorist attacks" by the 
anti-abortion lobby?

When the Royal Mail was first set up by the Victorians, a study was done 
(famous chap, can\'t remember the name), that discovered that, due to the 
statistics of distance letter were sent, a single flat rate could be 
applied reguardless of distance.  You gained on short distance mail, but 
lost on the long distance stuff.

In Traveller Cargo is shifted at Cr1000/ton per Jump.  If fuel costs are 
ignored, then the overheads are the same if you do a jump-1 or a jump-6!

Mail
====			(has probably been covered by now)
As I understand (and play) the way mail cargos, and the X-Boat service.

Mail Cargo
==========
The ship must reserve 5tons of cargo space, and carry weapons and a 
Gunner full time.  For this space and salary, the ship is paid Cr25000.  
In addition the ship must follow a set route to a set timetable.
Because of this last condition, Subsidised Merchants are most likely to 
get the contract, because they are already on such a route, and 
owned/controlled by the Goverments in the Mail Collective.

X-Boat
======
The X-Boat service carries Fax, E-mail, etc... Anything that can be 
digitised for computer storage/transmission.  These are carried by the 
X-Boats along the main routes.  For the final trip off the Xboat route, 
Type-S ships with Commo gear carry the messages.  The grear goes into the 
large area (Aft/Portside) opposite the Air/Raft Bay.

For non-digital messages, parcels, documents where the content _cannot_ 
be digitised+transmitted this way.  Again Type-S ships are used.
(due to a modification of the fuel in Book 2, my Type-S carry fuel for 2 
jump-2s and have 6 tons cargo)
They carry the 5tons physical mail, and follow the X-Boat routes.  Though 
at half the speed of the X-boats.

Asside
======
All this communication via Fax/Email equivalents.
Is it encoded?
How, public key?
By whom, the sender, the Scouts?

Equip a small ship - say, a Scout/Courier - with an EMM package and a far

 Active EMS jammer. The EmLevel will go from faint to none (so, no

Yes, the Vargr government are not very big, neither are they very organized,
no
t even internally, much less when dealing with each other. But there could
stil
l be acting like they were very coordinated

The border between the Imperium and the Vargr Extents is very long, which
means
, that the Imperium has to use a lot of resources to defend against the
Vargr.

When Lucan pulled away Corridor and Lishun fleet, and with other fleets (Siru
S
irka, Domain of Deneb) also engaged on other fronts than the Vargr Extents,
the
 defense against the Vargr would be a lot weaker than before.

So all Vargr governments, raiders, corsair, you-name-it sees this, and starts
a
ttacking the imperial borderworlds. So while not being coordinated at all,
exte
rnal events "force" them to act in the same way.

This is, ofcause, a rather deterministic view on social science :-)

I\'m not swiss myself (but danish), but I have some swiss family. This winter,
o
ne swiss told me, that, yes, the men have assault rifles and ammunition. The
am
mo comes in a sealed package. The punishment for just ?breaking? the seal in
pe
acetime is ?years? of prison.

Also, the assault rifle is at home. How does that protect a swiss walking in
th
e streets from being mugged or murdered? I fail to see how this has anything
to
 do with the level of civilization or the crime rate.

In Denmark wearing a gun is optional for most policemen (ofcause not for
riot-control teams and the like), and not all wear one. For a civilian, a gun is
pretty hard to come by, but not impossible. But if you have one legally, it is
for

sporting only, and it is registered with the police. The crimanals don\'t
usually wear guns, because they don\'t need to defend themselves. The danish police
don\'t shoot first and ask questions later, because the criminals usually don\'t
have guns :-) Anyway, getting caught doing something illegal is bad enough, but
if you are carrying an illegal weapon at the same time, you\'ll be doing ?
a lot?
more time.

IMHO Denmark is a peaceful and civilized coutry, where I can walk in the
streets in the middle of the night without fear of being attacked. In fact, some
say it\'s a bit boring :-)

band.   In the Traveller Adventure, the whole campaign revolved around a =
Vargr band trying to aquire a Meson Gun for a ship.  That might seam to =

On the other hand, if a 30,000 Tn cruiser did cross the Imperial border, =
that would probably force the Imerial Navy to treat the threat as an act =

In x212, Hans Rancke-Madsen made some points about Vargr corsairs.

>>Corsairs might take the chance to jump in closer than 100 diameters.
>Can\'t do that according to the rules.

Sorry, thinking about my campaign there, where you can jump in/out of
anywhere, it just affects the chances of a misjump or ending up with only
half the ship managing to drag itself into hyperspace, etc.!

>As I pointed out earlier I\'m not talking about the odd 400 T Corsair...

Sorry, I wasn\'t really following things too closely (the amount of mail I
get to read I don\'t take everything in). I would like to agree that any
large corsair (Vargr or whoever) ain\'t going to survive long and, as you
pointed out, becomes economically unviable very quickly.
However, smaller ships (scouts up to say, Broadsword 800-tonners) might be
easy enough to steal, cheap enough to maintain/repair, require a small
enough crew and be small enough to evade the usual patrol ships, that they
might make a living out of piracy. Frankly, I\'d expect them to have at least
smuggling as a side line (for when the going is tough) or maybe they hire
out as mercenaries.

JSHiggin then mentions the cost of arming a stolen merchant to make it a
worthwhile pirate, and concludes:
>    So, you just traded MCr30 (in cash), and a ship worth MCr400+, for
>the life of a pirate.  Where you MAY break even, if you are reasonably
>lucky...

Again, large corsairs don\'t make sense UNLESS they are supported by a
suitable sponsor (a local Vargr world government), have proper fighting
ships (old sold-off Imperial models or newer stolen ones or even
custom-built ones if it\'s a government job) and work with inside
intelligence or as a pack (appropriate for the Vargr, eh?)
I would like to draw a vague analogy with Water Raleigh and his merry
\'pirates\' who preyed upon the Spanish merchants with the unofficial
\'blessing\' of Elizabeth I. (cor, 3 lines of history, I bet there\'s an error
there somewhere!)

If you use WBH or Scouts to generate systems, you get a large number of
in-system worlds (other than the mainworld) with colonies, labs, military
bases, etc. Quite often I\'ve found they come out with better ratings for
temperature, agriculture, etc. than the mainworld. In almost all cases
(especially for asteroid habitats, etc.) there is (in my games) an awful lot
of in-system traffic, carrying foodstuffs from the Ag worlds, water from wet
to desert worlds, ores from mines to In planets, hydrocarbons from gas
giants, etc. etc. etc.). The in-system traffic certainly exceeds the
inter-system traffic levels in most systems I\'ve examined - if you can mine
an outer world and use cheap in-system transport to get the ore back, what\'s
the point of bringing in ore in expensive jump-capable ships from other
systems?
A lot of CT\'s original trade relied upon the single world generation system
which meant if a planet had scarce resources (non-Ag, non-In, etc.) it had
to import from other _systems_. The more realistic WBH and Scouts systems
show how much more likely in-system traffic is.

See Q Eliz I analogy above. White Dwarf\'s infamous Sable Rose adventure is a
good example of searching out pirates who have the unofficial blessing of
their world government.

Steve continues about the problems of piracy and cost to repair ships:
>    We never looked back (except for a lot of jokes about the "blender
>murders", of course ;-) )...

A lot of players certainly don\'t seem too worried about putting their ship
in danger for other reasons - piracy is just a different risk to be taken.
Let\'s face it, RISK TAKING is a major way of gaining face among your equals,
which is presumably why some Vargr are so eager to be pirates?

WEAPONS AND ARMOUR

Steve continues:

A nice idea, except you do have to be careful about people who are not
intentionally criminal, e.g. fruitcakes, nazis, etc.

>...In Switzerland, every adult male gets to (HAS to)

Nice idea. If you limit the ammunition and, better still in Traveller, have
a unique identifier for every gun and its rounds (radioactive trace elements
in the bullet metal, etc.) then everyone can be defended while still being
able to catch those people who abuse the system. Anyone else got any clever
ideas for expanding on this? Except, "every adult male gets his own
battledress" is still out the window, as far as MY game\'s concerned ;-)

Oh, and congratulations to "John H. Kim" <jokim@mit.edu> on his marvellous
summary of how statistics can be used to prove anything, particularly if
you\'re a news reporter.

Ken Hagler then talks about guns and says:

It\'s strange though, when I play Traveller, none of the players really
contemplate the dangers of guns to their characters. I (ironically, as the
referee) am the only one who, when faced with having to shoot someone,
always try to make sure I\'m behind good solid cover with an aimed shot, etc.
The rest of them just stand in the middle of the street blazing away with
their autopistol, not worrying about the fact that I\'ve quite clearly stated
they have two opponents, one with an Ingrams, the other with an autoshotgun.
It\'s not heroism - they just plain don\'t understand the threat. Now, this
might not really translate to real life, but I wouldn\'t mind betting that it
does match quite closely. Maybe that\'s because I\'m in the UK so no one here
really has much experience of the use of genuine firearms. I\'m considered a
coward in combat - and that goes for my Wizards in AD&D too - all the 10th
level 100+ Hit Point fighters keep asking why I hang around in the middle of
the party, keep invisible most of the time and don\'t charge up the front and
stab the dragon with my dagger... :-) The only way I find of waking players
up to the dangers of guns is to keep showing them the gunfights out of Total
Recall, as an example of a sci-fi film using projectile weapons. (sigh)

Let me clarify that I am dealing with adolescents here, most of whom are on
the "hormone hop".  They have a certain amount of self-control, but still do
many things without thinking.  Sort of a stimulus-response kind of thing. 
One of the "games" that they play is dominance: they engage in a lot of
maneuvering to establish a pecking order.  (Hey, you remember high school.) 
With certain kids, violence and strength is part of this.  They swagger, pump
iron, do steroids, and carry weapons.  Give them a challenge and they
respond.  

If I looked liked Arnie then they could back down in front of their friends
without losing face, but I am 5\'8" and 130 pounds!  To back down in front of
me would be humiliating.  Even if I was armed, they would have to try
something.  Instead, I find other ways of controlling them when necessary
(and most of the time they need advice more than control).

My favourite example is of a student who was wandering the halls yipping
(rather like a small dog).  I politely asked him to stop (it was disturbing
my class) and he refused, profanely.  He was obviously seeking a
confrontation.  Instead of giving him one (which would have raised his peer
status by defying authority) I remarked to one of my female students that his
undershorts must be tight enough to hurt.  She dissolved into giggles and he
disappeared, fast.  

Relevance to Traveller?  This type of approach (non-confrontational,
psychological) will be necessary for the bulk of RCES missions (all the
non-SAG missions).  The trick is to find out what is going on while remaining
a neutral.  My personal bias is that this type of adventure is much more fun
than a combat-oriented one because it involved more role-playing and
interaction.  I\'ll admit it\'s a lot harder to run this type of adventure,
because you must role-play the NPCs to a greater depth than usual to allow
the players a chance to figure out the NPCs\' motivations and goals.

    Your feelings about guns are your privilege, and stay so as long as you

of such a license is wrong.

    Whether it has anything to do with "gun control" at all, I cannot
say.  I CAN say that "controlling entry/exit to the US" is NOT easy.
It is barely possible.  If it were so easy, then we would not have
better than 250,000 illegal immigrants coming in every year.
    Note, btw, that there is a bar in the USA/Canada with the
US-Canadian border running down the middle of the bar.  Getting into
Canada OR Mexico is a trivial exercise.  Ditto getting out.  The 
(limited) passport checks I underwent once upon a time entering 
Europe were MUCH more thorough than the "how long will you be in 
Canada?  Have a nice vacation." that accounted for border control
between Detroit and Windsor...

    All those?  I know of several, but not nearly so many as I

few terrorist acts"...

    Certainly the Soviets had a lot to do with that sort of thing
happening.  I was not really even speculating on why it happened 
there, but why it didn\'t happen other places...

    And certainly gun-control (or lack of same) is not a deciding
factor.  Israel has more terrorism than pretty much anyone else, but
is relatively free of gun-control (except among Palestinians), while
Switzerland has no terrorism, and is (so far) completely free of 
gun-control.
    Except that form of gun-control defined by "gun control means
hitting what you aim at", of course... ;-)

    Sure is!  Wow!  Two hundred governments, some of whom don\'t even know 
of the existance of some others acting more or less in unison.
    The kicker:  What is the "Pack of Fools" going to do when the Impies
obliterate the neighboring "Sons of Bitches"?
    And what are their neighbors going to do when the Impies come after
the PoF next?  The really lovely thing about a non-Alliance (a
volkwanderung, perhaps) such as you hypothesize here is that the big, bad
Impies can fend most of you off, while obliterating you one at a time.
Pretty soon, if you are a ways down the list, you might catch on that
it\'s time to find something else to do with your time.

    For that matter, what will happen when the first Vargr group makes a
move across the Impy border, and the Impies respond as aggressively as
ever by removing the problem and every starport/shipyard they own?  Is
a second group going to move now (knowing that it is the new "first")?
    Just remember, when your Vargr leaders make plans of this sort, that
your "allies" are NOT necessarily your friends.  Nor will loss of men
and ships by them hurt you especially.  Nor will loss of men/ships by
you hurt them.  So who goes first?  Knowing that the first few guys to
cross the border burn?

    IMHO, that means, "by all means, _you_ go first!  We\'ll be right
behind you!  Really! <sickly smile>"

    Are you aware that occupied houses are broken into more often in
Europe than in America?  Lots of street-crime in America, but relatively
little in the form of robberies of occupied dwellings.
    In any case, in the USA, it is generally true that the places in the 
USA with the most restrictive gun laws have the highest crime rates, even
though relatively few people carry weapons with them as a matter of course,
even in places where you are free to do so.

    And if, say, Nazi Germany were to take over Denmark, how long would
those registered firearms stay in the hands of anyone who might want to
fight the Nazis?  What?  Denmark could never be taken over by evil
foreign types?  My mistake...

    Of course they don\'t need to defend themselves!  Their VICTIMS need to
defend themselves!  The person who needs a gun for defense is not the
6\'3" 200# (that\'s 190cm, 90Kg) goon who wants to rob/rape/assault.  It\'s
the 5\'4" 110# (160cm, 50Kg) young lady that is being robbed/raped/assaulted
who needs a gun.  "God created men, but Colonel Colt made them equal".  I
am not in a great fear of being robbed/etc, being rather larger than the
goon I described above.  My wife, mother, and daughter, all being in the
general size range of the above-described "young lady" are much more in 
need of a weapon...

    Ours don\'t either, but ours do it that way because it\'s illegal for
them to shoot first and ask questions later.

    Could be.  It should be so here, but isn\'t usually.  Note that having
a gun when the guys chasing you don\'t have guns just invites you to turn
around and kill your pursuers, thus aiding your escape...

    I don\'t actually consider "peaceful" to be synonoymous with "civilized",
actually.  If I did, then any cemetary would be "civilized".  One of the
marks of a civilized country is that it have a civilized government.  One
of the premier requirements for a "civilized" government is that it not
fear its own citizens.  Another is that it interfere in nothing not
ABSOLUTELY essential to the security of the citizenry.  Frankly, my
possession of a gun (or a tank, or pretty much anything else) should 
matter not at all to the government UNLESS I use them to abuse my
neighbors.  In which case they should come down HARD on me.  But until
I do, "Don\'t tread on me" is still my motto...
    I wonder if I can get one of those rattlesnake flags made today?
Without being considered subversive, I mean...

    All of that is abstracted by the maintenance cost of the ships in TCS.
Note that TCS requires 10% of the base cost be spent every year for
maintenance, as opposed to the 0.1% required for actual maintenance (as
charged for your ship\'s annual maintenance).  So the cost of the Navy is
100 times the cost to keep the ships running.  Plenty for crews, bases,
etc...

    In our Navy ships are retired because of obsolescence, not at any
specific age.  Note that no Navies ever have enough money to throw away
a ship just because it is old.  Only when it can no longer do the job.

    Quite so.  On the other hand, I consider 1000T to be a pretty small
pirate ship.  Much too small to actually do the job, since they can\'t
afford the space for suitable prize crews in a hull that small that is
already packed with drives, weapons, etc.
    Note that if you drop down to 600T for your pirate, you  reduce all
my figures by about 40%.  Which still leaves some large numbers:  MCr18
invested, plus a ship worth MCr240....

    Quite so.  I tend to agree that there will be a large amount of insystem
traffic, actually.  You speak of bringing in ores and food, though.  How
much good does this do a pirate?  Keep in mind that jumping a non-starship
is not so easy as you might first suspect.  While beating it up and
taking it\'s treasure is pretty easy, what do you do with it?  Unless you
have the cargo hold to carry off the cargo, you\'re pretty much out of luck.
Remember that the SHIP is the valuable part of the prize, NOT the cargo.

    Remember the Armada?  The Spaniards did NOT allow the English to run
amok any more than limited Spanish resources required...
    Note also that if trying to parallel the Third Imperium/pirates with
Spanish Empire/pirates, using England is a really terrible example, since
the English were closely comparable to the Spanish in power (at least
1/10th as strong, say).  The only groups out there next to the Impies
that are that comparatively strong are the major powers (Aslan Hierate,
Zhodani Consulate, Solomani Confederation, Julian Protectorate).  No
"pirate" will be that strong.  If it is, then it will also be a major
power.  A better parallel to the 3I/pirates would be Spain/George the 
fisherman with his 10 foot dinghy...

    Risk-taking is a major way of gaining faced among young stupid males.
Of which I was one once, thank you.  An old bull doesn\'t gain face by 
"taking risks", he does it by stomping you into the mud WITHOUT taking
risks...
    My point was that you are ALREADY successful if you have the money to
be a pirate.  Why bother taking MORE risks?  For the fun?  Sure.  But that
doesn\'t apply to most of the universe, who, when they become successful,
are interested only in retaining what they have, rather than finding wildly
risky ways to lose it (C\'mon, CATTLE FUTURES are safer than piracy!).

    No, you missed the point!  This is the way it really is!  They don\'t 
have neat tracers on the bullets, and the only identifier on the gun is
the same one as on every gun (serial number and ballistics).  I am not
suggesting that this might work.  I am saying it DOES work in the one
country willing to try it.
    AS to "every adult male in BD", note that that is a sexist remark.  Why
not give the babes BD too?  Frankly, anyone who doesn\'t quibble at giving
the PCs a starship (which is a POWERFUL weapon, even unarmed, and carries
armament much stronger than the BD does) shouldn\'t be bothered by BD.  I
never was.  I also never saw it used much.  In ANY of the Trav games I 
either played in or refereed.  The only time I can think of off the top
of my head is when a player with more money than sense bought some on 
Efate.  Wonderful investment!  Really!  He never found a use for it, but
it made him feel MUCH better...;-)

    I have noticed this too.  A hint: if the games were as lethal as real
life, this would not happen more than once.  In MT, following ALL the rules
most carefully, a one-shot kill is not unusual.  In MT rules, I was always
EXTREMELY careful about cover and such when in a firefight.  In T2K2, where
a one-shot-kill is almost impossible, I seldom bother to take cover from
anything short of fully-automatic weapons.
    In much the same fashion, I used to be much more cautious about fights
in Runequest, where arms and legs were severed with distressing frequency,
than I was in AD&D, where the effects of being hit once were much less
severe...
    Note how rules affect player behaviour, Loren?

    Another way to wake them up is to let a few of them get blown away for 
their stupidity.  Let the bad guys use cover well, take aimed shots,, etc.
And kill some PCs.  Or do you use TNE, where that is next to impossible?
I found a long time ago that the best way to discourage unrealistic
behaviour is to punish it WITHIN CONTEXT!  GM fiat doesn\'t do much but
annoy the players.  But the old, "hmmm...nine more than I needed to hit.
That\'s eight times damage to a minimum of eight points.  Plus pinpoint
hit, so only half armour for you...hmmmm...take 24 dice of damage.  You\'re
DEAD?  Already?  But two more of them haven\'t even gotten around to rolling
to hit yet!  Let\'s go ahead and do them, just to see how bad the corpse
looks..."

    If you are using TNE, where guns do trivial damage for the most part,
you\'ll be in the GM\'s fiat gray area if you just declare them riddled
with bullets, and therefore a corpse.  Which is one of the reasons I 
dislike the transition to TNE so much.  Too easy to survive firefights...

    I point out, fyi, that FFW (which I owned once) included a smaller 
Navy for the Marches than the USA has today.  The USA has 250 megapeople.
The Marches can do better than that in GIGA-people.  More people equals
more taxes equal more ships.  Using the GWP guidelines from Striker (the
old one), Efate can muster enough income to maintain 4000 cruisers by
allocating 3% if their GWP to maintaining a Navy.  Note that the USA
spends about 1.5% of its GNP on the Navy, btw.  Note also that Efate is
less than 1% of the total population of the Marches.

    You make very clear here that the purpose of government is to force
you to obey it.  Keep in mind that if a 400T corsair can jump in freely,
then a 60,000T corsair could do so as well.  So if the Gov can\'t
protect you from the one, it can\'t protect you from the other.  It can
only get revenge for your murder.

    Now, I concede that I believe that that is all any government can do.
Governments are "official" protection rackets, after all, who claim the 
right to kill/imprison you if you refuse to obey them.
    I also concede that the environment you describe might be great fun
to roll-play in.  I\'d have a blast fighting against the Imperium if that\'s
how the Imperium thought/behaved.

    Nonsense!  Once you have reached the stage of venality where you count
the dollar cost of your citizens\' lives, then making the larger jump that
losing a minor world now and then is no big deal!  After all, there were
only a few tens of thousands of colonials there...how can we justify losing
BILLIONS here on the homeworld in a war just to protect a few thousand
colonials?!?  Makes no sense...
    A disgusting attitude, really.  But common to governments throughout
history...

    Incorrect.  The Japanese problem was pretty clear as a result of Pearl
Harbor!  NOT the German Problem!  Note, btw, that we were interfering in 
WW2 since 1940, when we began supplying arms to Britain, in violation of
Neutrality Laws (our own, and international ones).

    Note that the USA NEVER suffered any direct losses from the Germans
other than "a few citizens", and all of them were in a "war zone".  And
the overwhelming number of them were soldiers.  WIth the attitude you
describe here, it could even be argued that the ships sunk by U-boats
off the coast were "good for business", in that they gave a tremendous
employment boost to the American civil shipyards...


> Whay do =

    I don\'t.  I assume that the Impies are undiluted pond scum in every
game I\'ve played in the last ten years.  I assume they WOULD do this.
I assume that the Impies allow a thriving slave-trade, too.  But the
fact that I do this does not mean that MOST Trav players don\'t make the
Impies
the "good guys".  And the "good guys" aren\'t the ones who work as you
(and I) herein assume.  That\'s the slot for "the bad guys"...
    On the other hand, the USA has been pretty good about protecting its
citizens from pirates and Indians and such up till the last few decades.
We fought three wars early in our history to prevent outsiders from 
taking advantage of our citizens (The Barbary Pirates, the Naval War w/
France, and the War of 1812 all were at least partly to prevent them
from pushing around "a few citizens").  We also sent Pershing into 
Mexico to deal with Pancho Villa, who did little more than threaten
"a few citizens"...

    So, if the Impies are "good guys", they\'ll protect their people to 
the best of their ability (attempting to keep the implicit promise of
protection that every government makes in exchange for the tribute you
pay them), and if they\'re "the bad guys" (undiluted pond scum), then
they act like most governments, and only protect their citizens when
it is convenient to do so.  And where\'s Luke Skywalker when you need
him, anyway? ;-)

Steve is careful not to state a cause-effect relationship here, although
he might be implying it.  I just wanted to remind everyone to keep what I
said in mind when you try to analyze this.  Don\'t assume that the gun laws
cause the high crime rate or vice versa.  Of course for purposes of
Traveller, you could use our world as a model and on average make the
crime rate higher at starports with high law levels.  It\'s a really
strange world we live in...

It also has system defenses worth 70,000,000 MCr. That\'s meson guns and
System Defens Battleships equivalent to 70 trillion credit squadrons. 

(20 billion people @ Cr 500/year gives a yearly budget of MCr 10,000,000 or 
10 TCr gives a fleet worth 100 TCr, 70% of which goes to system defenses).

Good start. Otherwise you will have to explain how the Aslans conqured
Glisten, one of the four most important planets in the Spinward Marches,
with defenses four times as strong as Tobia and located 30 parsecs from
the Aslans\' supply bases.

Agreed.

Ahem. The local builds would be TL 15. Tobia is TL 15, remember. The _ihatei_
ships, now, will be obsolescent TL-13 ships (assuming for purposes of
argument that no _ihatei_ comes from Aslans worlds of less than TL 14).

I agree 100% percent with you.

Impression, eh? Well, the _facts_ are that subsector fleets are supposed to
be maintained at subsector level. That means that in, say, Five Sisters,
they would only be TL 12, but in Tobia the would actually be TL 15. However,
the rules does say that Subsector Fleets are composed of obsolescent ships,
so let\'s keep them at TL 14.

>In any case, as the only big tech-15 ship-building world this side of Trin, 
>Tobia will need to use it\'s resources to support the regular navy, not the 
>colonials.  

Tobia has the yard capacity to maintain its defense forces, the whole Sector
Fleet AND the Subsector Fleet. Why not? For all practical purposes it pays 
for them all. (Well, there will be a significant contribution from Hradus,
but I don\'t have the conversion tables for credits here, so I can\'t figure
out how much).

>The Imperial fleets will have only one tech-level on the ihatei, maybe less.

Uh-uh! They will have AT LEAST one tech level on the ihatei, propably more.

At this point it will be helpful to mention that Steve Higginbotham once
estimated that ton for ton (or was it credit for credit?) a TL 14 ship is
50% more effective than a TL 13 ship, 10 times more effective than a TL 12
ship, 12 times more effective than a TL 11 ship, 1000 times more effective
than a TL 10 ship and able dto defeat any number of TL 9 ships.

Since Tobias system defenses at least will be TL 15 (even if the Subsector
Fleet isn\'t) it will also be helpful to know that a TL 15 ship is 3 times
better than a TL 14, 5 times better than a TL 13, 20 times better than a
TL 12, 500 times better than a TL 11, and infinitely better tha any TL 10 or
9 ship.

So let\'s see how many Aslans we need to achieve parity with this force.
Let\'s ignore the Subsector Fleet, since it is propably out somewhere else
in the subsector kicking ihatei off lesser worlds. We have the defensive
forces worth the taxes of 14 billion people (70% of the true population).
They are 5 times as effective as their opponents (TL 15 vs. TL 13). A
typical _ihatei_ fleet is evenly divided between 10,000 T warships and
50,000 T transports which conveniently enough costs almost the same. So
half the money used to equip an _ihatei_ fleet goes into transports and
only half into warships. An Aslan clan can\'t afford to use its whole
naval budget on _ihatei_ ships; if it did it would soon be invaded by a
neighbouring clan. I assume they use 10% of their budget. (If you don\'t
agree, what percentage would you think proper?). That means the Aslan
fleet would consist of the _ihatei_ fleets of 14*5*2*10 billion Aslans.
That\'s 1400 _billion_ Aslans! I know Aslan worlds tend to run into the
billions, but 1400 billion? Note that this gives the _ihatei_ no more
than an even chance of winning. Less than that, actually, because we
haven\'t considered the fact that the Tobia defenses are non-jump ships
and ground installations while the Aslans\' are jump ships. Once they\'ve
won they will have 25 billion relatives to settle on their newly acquired
real estate. And then they will have to defend Tobia against the Domain
fleet that will arrive in six months time.

I wouldn\'t fire my Chief of Intelligence if he missed such a build-up,
I would hang him for treason.

Aslan colonists in controlled doses are not a problem, they are a
palliative (not that any is needed). "Do you swear allegiance to the
Arch-Duke of Deneb?" "Aye, verily!" "Right! Please patrol this system 
and defend it against any other _ihatei_." "Your word is our command,
Sire!"

1400 billion Aslans. Some handful!

Now the Aslans kills off the whole population of Tobia? Well, it makes
more room for them, I suppose. It also removes any restraints the
retaliatory fleet might have had on their actions. The Aslans would
propably just have time to decontaminate the planet and settle their
loved ones on it before the Imperial fleet arrived to wipe them out.
Good planning on the part of any insane Aslan admiral.

OK, 3 months instead of 6 for the retaliation to appear. Incidentally,
Lintl (Reft 0503) is a TL 15 world with 40 billion inhabitants. That 
gives, without looking at any other worlds in Reft, a subsector fleet of
30 trillion credit squadrons. Since Lintl strangely enough dosen\'t have
a naval base, most of the fleet is propably based on Peshtorno (Largest
population world of those with naval bases). That means Tobia can expect
help in 4 weeks. (Hey, 25 TL-14 TCr Squadrons is a little help, right?).  

And don\'t forget Tobia\'s own Subsector Fleet. That is propably only one
jump away, so they could be back to help in two weeks. That\'s another 15
TCr squadrons.

>The lack of a decent Imperial naval force in the area is then directly

50 TCr squadrons seems a pretty decent naval force to me. Even if they
are non-regular TL-14 pukes. (Though why Tobia and Lintl would support
TL-14 ships when they can support TL-15... Well, it\'s undoubtedly something
politically determined). But give me the subsector fleets of Trojan Reach
and Reft and I will guarantee you to kick the Aslans off any place they
manage to establish themselves. Give me a half-decent spy network and I
will guarantee to intercept most of them in advance.

>I\'m not saying that Tobia necessarily fell this way in the game, they

Enough peaceful settlers to outvote 20 billion Tobians? Keeping in mind
that peaceful settlers would be oathbound to Duke Alexander? You\'ve just
doubled the strength of the Imperial forces in Tobia Subsector, laddie!

I disagree.

Mark, an active EMS jammer is a _beacon_. It\'s the equivalent of a defensive
wall: easy to spot, but hopefully impossible to penetrate. (To which an
Imperial warship will say "Oh, yeah?" and lob off a few salvoes of missiles
backed by it\'s factor 9 computer).

There\'s no surprises in this matter. That\'s one of the fixed points in my
argument (I always like to have some basis in fact to lend versimilitude
to an otherwise bland and unconvincing argument). The only rules we have
on the subject states that you pay 10% of the purchase price of a ship in
yearly maintenance, and that this pays for all support. Since an annual
overhaul only costs 1% of the purchase price this dosen\'t seem unreasonable.

Note that in my own campaign I often come up against situations where the
rules state that this or that planet would have 70 TCr worth of defenses
where I only want them to have a lot less. One of the dodges I use is the
MISS Factor (Military Inefficiency Spending Syndrome  -  the widely held 
notion that military organisations tend to pay more for what they buy than
private businesses (note that for my purpose it is irrelevant wether this
is actually true or just an urban myth)). By varying the MISS factor of
different goverments I can make some interesting situations. But that is
in my campaign. The official rules have nothing like that (I also have
the high-population worlds spend less tax money on the navy, but that\'s
unofficial too). And when I argue on this list I use official rules unless
noted.

Yep. The rules also state that you can jump to a tolerance of 3000 miles
(Actually, here I\'m relying on Steve; I\'ve never calculated it myself).

Whatever they are they are in trouble if they ever venture into Imperial
space. I just noticed that they are TL 11. TL 15 ships are 500 times as
effective as TL 11 ships.

You\'re absolutely correct, but don\'t you think that it\'s a serious flaw
that you can\'t have pirates in the game without violating several of the
basic rules of said game? Not to mention historical facts based on the
same sort of violations?

And page 62 of _Rebellion Sourcebook_ states that the Imperium did use
punitive raids. The problem is that GDW assumes that it will take a huge
amount of ships to keep the Vargr in check whilst their rules show that
it wouldn\'t take nearly that much. The 16 regular fleets in Corridor is
a HUGE overkill.

So far, so good. You\'ve made a better start than many.

Go ahead and use your full powers. You\'re far enough away from anyplace
to be out of detector range. In fact, you will HAVE to use it, because if
you try to match courses with a CT or Megatraveller ship using no more
than their performance you will have to start in the same place. CT and
MT interplanetary travel is constant-acceleration. If you\'re using TNE
rules this isn\'t so, but then the merchant is most propably using a jump
drive. It\'s a lot faster and thus a lot more economic. Besides, I\'m not 
arguing against the possibility of pirates in a post-Collapse environment.

Gee, I wonder if there is anything a merchant can do to foil this brilliant
plan? Nothing, except taking his ship a few percent outside his direct
route. It\'s cheap, costs him only a few hours extra travel time, and it
makes him pass you a a distance beyond your detector range.

No you can\'t, because The Queens Gold will certainly jump from a safe point

It was loosely based on Twilight\'s Peak: a merchant ship trying to stay
afloat and me trying to keep the players on track.  

The most interesting character was Albert the Commando Accountant ("have
notebook, will travel").  The player is one of the most devious and cunning
chaps I\'ve met (he runs a terrific game of Runequest, too) who delighted in
finding psychological and legal leverage on the baddies.  Plots 3-4 levels
deep!  It was amazing.  "Please don\'t force me to audit you.  It\'s such a ...
messy ... death."

The group did eventually solve the adventure, although I received some forced
science lessons on the way.  ("Of course there\'s something going on.  That
ecosystem/orbit/atmosphere/etc. is obviously artificially maintained.  Here,
I\'ll prove it to you.")  Never run an exploration adventure with scientists
unless you want to spend a lot of time building your worlds.

You bet they are, Steve. They are going to move in on group one and take
over! (Then they\'re going to make all the treaties they can get away with

How long did it take you to find new players? ;-)

There are so many ways to kill anyone in a spaceship that the only way 
to hi-jack a spaceship is to take over the computer first. Or at least 
neutralize it, which is more fun because you get a (more or less) fair 
firefight out of it.

Btw. what should the players have done instead? Leading players into
no-win situations without warning them first is bad GMing. But perhaps
you did warn them?

    'body' => '    I\'ve been reading the revived discussion about the fall of Tobia with
some interest.  Cynthia and I even spent an evening trying to come up with
some combination of incompetence and treason that might do it.  Herein my
tuppence worth on the debate:

Steve Bonneville:

    Where are you and Hans getting that population for Tobia?  The only
info I have on it sets it at 6 gigapeople, not 20 gigapeople...
    Note that GDW assigns a combat value of 500 battalions to a "field
army", making it about 25 divisions equivalent.  That sets Tobian Army
strength at about two million men, which is rather large by modern
Terran standards (China might have one that big?  Russia did once upon
a time when it used the initials USSR), but in comparison to the pop-
ulation (6 Gp) is rather small, actually.  We can not too unreasonably
assume that a modern trend towards smaller professional armies may
continue into the distant future and allow that nothing unusual is
represented by an Army that size.
    Keep in mind, though, that TL15 "armies" have considerable "organic"
spacegoing capability.  After all, a TL15 grav-tank is different from
a fighter primarily in the way its crew are addressed ("driver", "gunner",
as opposed to "pilot", "gunner")...

    Good move.


> By this view, the Domain only lost control of Sindal and Tobia subsectors,
> and Duchess Sharikkamur is able to draw the line at Gazulin.  

    I think this view is indefensible.  A force sufficient to take Tobia
is sufficient to blast through all the way to Glisten and beyond.  Plus,
one must keep in mind that the guys who took Tobia are now arming them-
selves to Impy standards, and are at least ten times as effective as
they were _before_ they took Tobia.  So a force capable of taking Tobia
should be more than capable of pressing on as far as, say Rhylanor.
    Note, btw, that the Zhodani Consulate was incapable of capturing TL12
Jewell in spite of limited Naval assistance in the defense of Jewell, and
a three year siege.  It is being assumed that what the Zhodani Navy could
not do (take a high-pop, high-tech world) in three years was done by a
bunch of Aslan amateurs in archaic ships in only a few months (and a
higher tech target than the Zhos had, to boot.)...
    Spare me.

    This is silly!  It is cheaper to build and maintain new TL15 ships
than it is to maintain TL14 ships.

    And very stout hinges those two worlds are, too! ;-)

    Why is this fleet described as "tiny" here?  I wouldn\'t be terribly
surprised to learn that it was tiny, but I don\'t recall reading that 
anywhere....

    Well, not necessarily.  Going back as far as Leviathon, I recall
reading of Zho forays into the Trojan Reaches, closer to Tobia than the
actual main battles of the FFW were to Trin.

    What?!?  Have you any idea how much shippping Tobia is capable of
supporting in its yards?  Try 150,000,000 displacement tons.  Perhaps
as much as 50% more than that...
    Unless the "regular Navy" routinely operating in the backwater
Trojan Reaches is at least that large, you can pretty much count on
the colonial squadrons being pretty much exclusively TL15.

    Even if I bought the arguments for TL14 Impies (I don\'t), I would
agree with Hans here - one TL AT LEAST.

    Only if the Impies are stupid could they miss the significance of
this move.  After all, it involves a bigger war than the FFW, conquest
of more territory than has changed hands in the last 800 years along the
border with the Zhos, and LARGE naval/marine/army forces operating
literally years away from home.  It also implies a humongous effort for
the Tlaukhu in moving these guys over the J-5 route to get here, including
the securing of the near terminus of the J-5 route.  WIth ships that are
seldom more than J-3, remember?


> But Tobia is just six parsecs from the Imperial border.  A military

    Well, no.  An Aslan warfleet will be J-3.  Which means at least three
weeks to reach Tobia.  Impy spy-ships in Aslan space (if there aren\'t any,
then there is prima facie evidence of treason and gross incompetence on 
the part of both INI and <whatever the local intelligence operation is> -
I\'d start on the hangings right as soon as I found out that the spy ships
weren\'t there, if I were the man on the hotseat in Tobia) can reach
Tobia in a week.
    And _that_ is assuming that INI and co. are so incompetent that the
first clue they can get of major Aslan fleet movements are when the ships
leave orbit.

    You are using the civilian definition of "threat" here.  The Impy Navy
had better (unless charges of treason and inpcompetence are appropo here,
too) have detailed plans for dealing with invasions under several
scenarios, ranging from "an Aslan clan on the move" up through "full-scale
war with the Tlaukhu".  That\'s what they get paid for.
    The notion that the "correct" response to Aslan Fleets across the
border would be to talk to them to find out why they are here is ludicrous.
Try a real-world example - France invades Germany with eight divisions, say.
Now I admit that the French idea of a division is not much, but the Bundes-
wehr isn\'t all that big an Army either.  Would you reasonably expect that
the first response in Berlin would be to call for the French Ambassador
to ask what\' wrong?  Or would they do what has historically been done in
similar situations throughout history?  Start Mobilization, start fighting
to expel the enemy, call in the Ambassador to give him his passport back 
and expel him, THEN, MAYBE, wonder what went wrong...

    Now, keep in mind that I do not disagree with the notion that Aslan
colonists might not be welcome on many of these worlds.  If *I* were
governing one of those backwaters down near the Florian League, a few
million Aslan militiamen might look like a wonderful opportunity!
    On the other hand, it\'s illegal as Hell for them to come in.  A clear
violation of the Treaty of Ft<whatever>.  So in spite of the fact that
I (the governor of Podunk III) might welcome them, the Navy (which out-
votes me big time) willl send them packing back home as soon as they are
found.


<your discussion of an Aslan attack>

    Nice.  But you have no _idea_ just how hard it is to get together the
requisite force.  For Aslan Ihatei, who are using archaic ships even by
Aslan standards.
    And 5FW is a really lousy analysis tool for this job.  5FW makes the
standard wargame simplification of reducing the number of units on a side
to a "representative" level similar in overall structure to the actual
units present in the war.  If the Spinward Marches could afford only the
Naval Units shown in the 5FW game, then how could an Aslan clan afford the
THOUSANDS of cruisers and transports supposedly sent across the Rift into
the new lands?  And if there were not thousands of transports, then not
much in the way of Aslan colonists would be present, and they\'d be incapable
of colonizing half the Trojan Reaches.  Not to mention that they would
have no NEED to colonize more than a world or two...


> So they offer the Tobians a chance to surrender, which Duke Alexander
> takes, and the Aslan land a handful of occupying divisions.

    Why should he do something so stupid?  More treason?  Or just
incompetence?  The Aslan aren\'t going to nuke Tobia.  Several reasons:

        1)  nuke it, and you have gained nothing.  If you want the land
intact, you have to take it the old-fashioned way.
        2)  Tobia has TL15 Nuke dampers.  No meaningful bombardment will
reach the surface.
        3)  Tobia has TL15 point defenses.  No meaningful bombardment will
reach the surface.
        4)  Tobia has TL15 deep meson sites.  No meaningful bombardment
force will survive trying to bombard the surface.

    So Alexander is not seriously at risk of orbital bombardment, and he
is still sitting on his deep-meson sites and his Army.  Surrendering at
that point (when your enemy is far from his base of supply, and you have
a bigger Army sitting right on top of YOUR base of supply) would be
insanely idiotic.  Or treasonous.  Or both.  Note, btw, when figuring out
Alexander\'s actions, that he is in a stronger position under the Impies
than he ever would be as an Aslan puppet, and the Aslan offensive is
completely untenable.
    Especially if he picks a clan at random, and concentrates his forces
exclusively on THEIR assets.  Then the next clan.  And so on.
    How long will the individual clans stick around?


> Trouble is, this frees up the rest of the fleet to go reinforce the

    Quite so.  So why should he do it?
    Also, you now seem to have created a second fleet/army force to take on
ALbe?  Where did it come from?  Who is coordinating all these wonderful
fleet movements?

    I frankly can\'t see this sort of attack distracting me long.  You send
a few BatRons to Tobia to send the rabble there home.  Ditto Albe.  Then 
send a few BatRons into the former Glorious Empire to remind them why
the Treaty of Ft<whatever> was signed.  (Hint: it wasn\'t signed because
the Imperium was so weak that the Tlaukhu felt sorry for them).

    If this were to happen, then I would expect wholesale trials/executions
for Treason, plus a myriad of similar trials for gross incompetence,
followed by myriads of Impy officers being cashiered.  Then look for the
Aslan to be kicked right back out.  because if taking a world like
TObia is easy enough for the ragtag Ihatei to do, then the Impy Navy could
do it back quite easily.
    Note, however, that I consider this scenario as ludicrous as any I have
come up with to explain the loss of Tobia.  And I have come up with some
doozies!
    The best so far required that the Impies be fighting both the Solomani
Confederation and the Zhodani Consulate when Tobia falls.  Even then the
Aslan had to have help from the Islands Federation (which is about as
tough as the Impy Trojan Reaches, having similar TL, and a similar high-tech
populace).  And even then I don\'t really BELIEVE that Tobia would fall.


    Unfortunately, they all fall apart on the twin altars of Money and
Power.  The Impies have both in droves.  The Ihatei don\'t.


Hans:

    Ton for ton.  It\'s worse, credit for credit, since the higher TL ships
are generally cheaper than the lower TL ships, ton for ton.

    Your analysis of required Ihatei numbers to take on Tobia I agree with
mostly, but I think that any commander who attacks with less than three to
one superiority in measured strength is a fool.  He should have five to
one before he even seriously considers the problem, IMHO.

Huh? Controlling entry/exit to the US isn\'t \'easy,\' it\'s impossible! Now,

immigration limits and the War on Some Drugs, but all such attempts

That\'s one of those ideas that sounds good at first, but doesn\'t work in
practice. US citizens go through _billions_ of round of ammunition each
year, many of which they manufacture themselves at home. For years, the US
government tried to keep track of ammunition purchases (without individual
identifiers, even), but all this ever accomplished was the generation of
mountains of worthless paperwork. That law was actually repealed--and the
repeal of a gun-control law is _very rare_ here...

Now imagine what that would be like if there was a unique identifier to keep
track of, and this was being done across many systems. You\'d need whole
planets full of bureaucrats just to run the system!

Ah yes, this syndrome occurs in gamers with too much exposure to
television. It\'s not unique to the UK, either--it\'s pretty common here in
the US. The victims of this syndrome have seen so many gunfights on TV that
they gradually come to believe that the TV gunfights are representative of
reality--which they\'re not. Ever. This delusion overwhelms the common sense
of the victim--but happily, there is a cure. Just run the battle
realisically, and the players will behave rationally with their next
characters. :-)

Yes, I\'m familiar with that sort of behavior. Aside from being young enough

I didn\'t mean to suggest that you should go around threatening brain-dead

I agree. I prefer missions that stress investigation and/or diplomacy. I do
like to let players have massive firepower, but put them in situations where
actually using it inappropriately would have disasterous consequences.

Not EXACTLY true...ships get retired in the USN because their function 
isn\'t needed, mainly.  Not obsolescence (that they cannot perform their 
function). To illustrate this, I merely point to the the USN\'s major fleet 
of "mothballed" vessels.  All of these are capable of being recommissioned 
& used when needed, despite some being 40+ years old.  They are merely set 
aside as there is no current need for that vessel (modern navies mainly 
maintaining very specialized inventories of ships) - not obsolescence.

Well...they had the steward of the ship on THEIR side, and (although he was 
a new hire for this voyage) he told them: "Whatever you do, don\'t try to 
just storm the bridge and shoot your way into control.  I\'ve heard they 
have an experimental new anti hijack routine that\'s killer."
The first stage of their "takeover" plan was good - subtle and devious, 
using little direct confrontation.  Unfortunately, the proponents of this 
lost the argument to the \'cowboy\'style gamers.  I felt it only poetic 
justice that the \'cowboys\' were the ones that got the axe.  The ones that 
survived actually DID end up taking the ship...after a lot of fast talking, 
some patience, and some thought.

 I don\'t think you needed to go so far. Under the
(MegaTraveller) rules any fall of over 9m automatically
deals 8 damage (Destroyed x 2).

 In one of my adventures the players were landing
on a planet under a tense situation when one of the
passengers started making a nuisence of themselves
and tried to get to the bridge with two bodyguards.
They just flicked the intertial compensator (after
bybassing the overides) in that coridor.
 The ship had 2G maneuver drives and was decelerating
at that rate. The bloke only fell 3m but the rules say
[effectively] to multiply by the square of the local gravity
which put 3m at 2G to 12m. Destroyed x 2 time!
 The guards, being big beefy types, just about
survived, but the passenger, being a thin weedy type,
bought it. They were within the legal sphere of the
planet they were landing on, (tense situation already)
and well lets just say "the referee determined the flow
of subsequent events"... [Hi Alvin]
 If *any* of the characters survived a 70m drop I
would be *very* surprised (unless it was less than .35G).

The Imperial Pagans are a religious group common throughout Diaspora and 
Daibei sectors of the Imperium. The founders of the Imperial Pagans took 
elements of traditional \'planetary deity\' religions and combined them 
into an intricate pantheon of mythic level figures representing the 
populated planets and important stellar objects. This pantheon was in 
many ways a metaphor for known galactic civilization. The individual 
characters reflected in an archetypical sense the character and 
personality of each planet. The tensions, alliances, and enmities between 
the characters mirrored in the stories told of each \'god\' and the lessons 
which should be drawn from events.

The founders of the Imperial Pagans held an informal gathering of nature 
worshiping religions and shamanic traditions. These religions, with their 
emphasis on the earth that gave their civilizations life, often had 
trouble with interstellar civilization. The meeting was held to find a 
way to explain the vast diversity of worlds and life and to integrate all 
of the individual naturalist religions to combine into a single ethical 
community.

Since 652, when the number of worlds with active IP congregations reached 
16, the dispersed congregations of the IP have communicated with each 
other to discuss and debate the deeper meanings of current and historical 
figures and events. As the discussions mature over months and years 
(think of them as Internet collaborations with a 2 week minimum 
communications lag - if not months) the events are described in story 
format. Over time, the stories are edited and refined until with age and 
care, the event or person in question has become a mythological icon.

Certain characters, often Admirals or Emperors, or just as often common 
adventurers or ordinary folk, would begin to have cycles of stories 
attributed to them. Carefully recorded are the source materials from 
which the stories are based, but the myths are the important part.The 
myths are recorded and passed on in the form of a holographic projection 
of the teller speaking the words to the audience. Small groups listen to 
the recordings as part of their religious observance. Larger groups 
gather to listen to particularly significant myths, often in direct 
relation to current events. The average IP is well educated, if only 
through the religion, and all are active members of the discussion 
community. The IP\'s are consummate historians, anthropologists, and 
philosophers. They have little dogma, they keep open records of debate 
and source material.

In the New Era the IP are a significant civilizing influence. Their 
belief structure was able to accomodate the idea of a galactic armageddon 
and rebirth.On many worlds the IPs were lonely lights against the 
darkness. they preached regrowth of civilization and they remembered the 
old dreams.

I allow most systems to have increased effectiveness for higher cost/mass,
etc. as long as this doesn\'t overbalance TL dependency. EMM shielding (from
my limited memory) isn\'t TL-based so high TL EMM ought to be able to fool
lower TL sensors pretty well. It would have to cost a damned lot to prevent
unbalancing the game, but for lower TL worlds which can only support say a
TL12 navy, a TL15 super-EMM-masked ship ought to be pretty near invisible.
Clearly the analogy is between 1940s radar and modern stealth bombers. Come
to think of it, stealth bombers are pretty good against modern radars,
dropping the radar cross section (technical blather, I think I know
something about this) by a factor of 1000 or more, so your TL15 intruder
ship looks smaller than even say a missile, to the TL12 SDB.

>    Note also that neutrinos are not covered by EMM....

Sensors not commonly available in the modern world are difficult to judge,
but I would presume that if nuclear dampers, etc. can moderate nuclear
reactions, and repulsors can affect gravity particles/waves, then there
ought to be Counter-Measures to reduce your \'signature\' for neutrinos,
densitometers, etc.

VARGR (AND OTHER) CORSAIRS
Steve mentions that in-system traffic carrying ores and food (my previous
posting) wouldn\'t make a great pirate target.

I agree, unless you have:
(a) Slightly larger corsairs which can engulf small (few hundred ton) ships
and carry them off whole.
(b) Sufficient time (once ship has been shot up) to extract the valuable
parts (computer, power plant or jump spares, etc.).
(c) You use intelligence (as elaborated upon by myself and ????????) to pick
the worthwhile targets (carrying gems, weapons, etc.)

ARMOUR AND WEAPONS
I mentioned you shouldn\'t let nazis and fruitcakes have guns, Steve replied:
>    So the governmnent should be allowed take MY guns because YOU are a
>Nazi?  What a novel theory of government!
Sorry, I should have specified that there should be some test to determine
if you are fit to hold a gun, not that the fear of \'nazis\' should prevent
_anyone_ from owning a gun.

Later he continues...

Sorry, again I meant that in (say) Traveller, you\'d have to have the extra
security, because I know well that my players would immediately abuse the
system.

>    AS to "every adult male in BD", note that that is a sexist remark.  Why
>not give the babes BD too?
I was altering the previous quote about "every adult male" in Switzerland
being given an assault rifle. My quote was not intended to be sexist,
although it does indicate the sexism practiced in Switzerland - why aren\'t
the adult women given assault rifles as well? Perhaps they are?

ON THE PROBLEMS OF EDUCATING PLAYERS
Steve volunteers:
>    Another way to wake them up is to let a few of them get blown away for 
>their stupidity.

I do try not to kill PCs unless they really deserve it. I have found a good
way of running combat whereby good armour (CE suit or better) reduces damage
significantly, but quickly falls apart under sustained fire. So when the
player first takes a hit, they\'re knocked over with little damage. Then you
tell them how much less armour they\'ve got left and they start calculating
how much real damage will penetrate the next time... it\'s a bit like
ablative armour used to be played.

Oh, and a classic from Steve:

>    I don\'t actually consider "peaceful" to be synonoymous with "civilized",
>actually.  If I did, then any cemetary would be "civilized".

Rather ironic, eh? When trying to bring home the dangers of weapons.
Thug: "So wat yu gonna du wid dat gun then?"
Judge Dredd: "I\'m going to CIVILISE you, perp\'."

NASTY GRAV PLATES
Steve "Styopa" then mentions an anti-hijack trap:
>not ALL the grav plates in ships have to be 
>installed in the floor....they can be placed, for example, at the end of a 
>long, smooth hallway, which turns into a 70m vertical shaft with a sudden g 
>change.  hahaha.

Or fit grav plates which can be upped to 6g. Turn on plates, watch hijackers
crumple to the floor (unable to move or use weapons), flood area with tranq
gas (or have heavy ceiling plates with release catches - only a 2-3m drop,
but at 6gs... WHUUMPH splat).

Sorry, this was supposed to be a 10-line reply but I\'m waffling as usual...

strong 2nd Amendment discussion, and what happens?  My damned 
mail server goes down for a week.  Personally, I am a very strong
2nd Amendment supporter, but not all (or even most) of the 
worlds in my Traveller game reflect this.  

I do make a separation between planetary cultures and Imperial
culture.  I see Imperial culture as the overall set of values and
attitudes held by the Imperial citizens who spend most of their
lives travelling from world to world.  This group would tend to 
include most (but not all) PCs, as well as a fairly large portion of
the Imperial nobility and the members of the Imperial services 
(IISS, IN, IMC, IA).  I also tend to see another distinct cultural
group, the Corporate culture.  This group is similar to the Imperial
culture, but is based on loyalty to a megacorporate entity.

The Imperial culture I tend to see as being fairly individualistic, and
while I don\'t think it is violence-prone, I feel it does not shrink
away from violence, and sees violence as another legitimate
(though costly) way of solving problems. In terms of views about
weapons and armor, these items are tools used to stay alive and
to further the goals of the individual or group in question.  For
this reason, weapons are fairly available in the extrality zone
of most starports (I generally set starports at Law Level 2, but
when rolling for possible harrasment by Security I pretend the
Law Level is about a 6; the starport managers frown on
property damage).

The Corporate culture would have a similar outlook, but this outlook 
would be colored by a loyalty to the megacorp.  This loyalty might
be based on tradition or on greed, but it would still be loyalty.  In
this case, violence would also been seen as a legitimate means
of problem solving, but this judgement would be strongly
tempered by the possible economic or reputation effects on the
megacorp and on the person or group in question.

The Planetary culture would be a wildcard.  Each world has its
own unique culture, or at least a subset of an overall ethnic
culture like Solomani or Vilani or what have you.  Every kind
of viewpoint you can image (and plenty you cannot imagine)
would show up in some Planetary culture.

Now there\'s a neat idea for handling one world\'s law level.  In fact, you get
a 
couple of possible offshoots:
1 - As above; the government does not abuse this, and nearly all gun owners 
play along as well.  The main play effect here might be that the PCs, upon
visiting the planet, have a small adventure either getting local weapons
permits, or inadvertently violate local weapons laws.
2 - As above, but the local government takes a more oppressive bent and
begins
cutting back ammo quotas and keeping "hit lists" of known ammo buyers.  Lots 
more adventure possibilities here:  The PCs could be hired by pro-weapon
resistance forces as mercenaries, or if technically skilled could be hired as

illegal ammo makers.  Or they could become smugglers, running ammo to
the resistance.  Or the PCs might get hired as infiltrators or trouble
shooters by the local government.

Well, there\'s my .02Cr.  For those of you offended or annoyed at the
recent rash of gun rights discussions, I offer a minor apology, but in
general I think things like this deserve discussion.  As I have shown
above, there is a Traveller relevance to this topic, since it is
intimately involved with one of the eight Universal Planetary Profile
numbers.  I realize the others don\'t get discussed as much, but there
is little argument over world sizes or atmospheric types.  The only
other controversial one would be government, which also will
generate the occasional massive arguments (I hope we all remeber
the great Feudal Technocracy debate).

And for those of you not in the U.S.A., who feel disconnected from the
main points of the gun rights material:  Keep giving your input.  I am
keeping notes based on the info from our foreign friends, and your
views or the views of your governments will absolutely show up in 
some planetary culture somewhere in my universe.  I thank you all
for your ideas.

I\'m interested in developing the Type-S Scouts in my campagn, can someone 
tell me more about this EMM.  Bear in mind that I *only* have the 
original Traveller (& Striker), so I\'m not even familiar with the 
"MegaTraveller" rules and equipment.

> to think of it, stealth bombers are pretty good against modern radars,
Err, except the Long Wavelength-Over the Horizon-Early warning radars.  
The Wingspan of the Stealth aircraft, is of the order of magnitude of the 
wavelength used, you get a nice lot of resonance and a huge reflection 
(or so I heard claimed by an RAF radar expert recently)

Agreed also.  Even with the tremendous Aslan lift capability, I find it very
difficult to get enough Aslan force to the systems to make a difference.
Especially against Imperial-quality troops.

DGP-Trav Digest.  Incidentally, except for info verifiable with the old
"Atlas of the Imperium" the UWPs from the dgp-original folder from 
ftp.engrg.uwo.ca for Trojan Reach are messed up -- someone rerolled data
for the subsectors printed in Leviathan, for instance.  The file\'s still
useful to show things like pre-war world allegiance, though.

Sort of.  What I was trying to say that while the naval staff may have
been perfectly aware of the risk presented by a heavily armed Aslan
force near the border, the civilian government headed by the Duke, a
non-military man, might not immediately understand what the navy was 
telling them about their trading partners.  Of course, the government
should understand what you mean by the "military definition" of threat,
but I was trying to find a way for the scenario to work.

True.  And this is certainly one of the places where using 5FW falls down
hard.  But if this is all correct, then what about:

Which leads to another question.  What were the Zhodani planning to gain
by sending that tech-14 40th Fleet of theirs on an attack on the tech-15
defenses at Rhylanor?  If they can\'t get Jewell, they surely can\'t take
Rhylanor.  They certainly don\'t have three years to besiege it; not even
three weeks.  Is it supposed to be a suicidal strike raid of some sort?

First, Rhylanor is the only big tech-15 shipyard in the coreward half of the
Marches.  Is the Imperium going to leave this system undefended?  I think
not.  If they need to, they can pull forward the Sabine subsector regulars
to help out.  Second, if the Imperium is going to have jump-6 pickets in
the Reach, they will in a declared war zone.  When the Zhodani enter the
Ghandi/Lanth system, Regina finds out a week later, and Rhylanor the week
after that.  A jump-4 Zhodani fleet needs at least three weeks to get to
Rhylanor or Porozlo.  Third, the trouble with Fulacin as a forward base 
is that if the Imperials catch on, there\'s *no* gas giants in the system
to refuel at!  So they\'d either have to go attack Porozlo, or go back to
Tureded, which at least has gas giants, to refuel.  So the idea that the
Zhodani can possibly surprise the Imperials is shaky, and the subsector
navy and Rhylanor\'s defenses should be warned.  Finally, Rhylanor has 
all the defensive advantages of a tech-level on the invaders, a HiPop
shipyard and naval base, and probably reinforcements from the tech-15
shipyards of Deneb that are in the rear area.  Oh, and the fact that it\'s
very likely that between the fleets in Regina, Vilis, and Lanth subsectors, 
they can cut off the Zhodani retreat.  Even raiding Rhylanor seems to be
a really risky idea.

Any opinions?

    One must keep one thing in mind at all times - the Rules are the
Reality of the game.  This is why, for instance, Striker II produces
considerably different results than TNE in certain cases.  In Srtiker II,
a man with an ACR can kill a man wearing light battledress with little
difficulty.  In TNE, this is nearly impossible.  So a battle played out
under TNE produces the opposite results than a battle played out in 
Striker II.
    This applies also to 5FW vs HG/MT/TNE...
    However...

    My best guess for making sense of this attack is to assume that the
attack was intended to:

    1)  divert reinforcements from some more crucial theater of operations,
and
    2)  allow the Zhodani to attack the repair yards of the Imperium.  A
successful hit on the Impy repair yards could have disabled naval strength
all out of proportion to the attacking force.  It is even possible that
the commander of the Zho force intended to destroy the yard capacity of
Rhylanor in order to force the Impy forces to drop back another subsector
onto their own supply lines.
    3)  it was a bluff to achieve a political objective elsewhere.

    The difficulties are:

    1)  There is no hint that the Zhos HAD another "more crucial theater"
to play in.
    2)  If Rhylanor WERE defended as well as the leading-edge naval base/
repair center it was, then the Zhos would have had no chance of success, 
and knew that, too.

    The bluff angle is the best one, but it assumes that there was some
objective to the 5FW other than beating the Imperium.  Possible, certainly,
but not consistent with the supposed Zho policies that led to the entire
series of Frontier Wars.


> Third, the trouble with Fulacin as a forward base is that if the
> Imperials catch on, there\'s *no* gas giants in the system to refuel at!

    Also true.  The Fulacin base idea is abysmally stupid, really. ;-)
    I never found the "Secret Base" rule to help the Zho player in any
way in winning 5FW.  The notion that the Impies would not figure things
out is bizarre, to say the least.
    Most importantly, of course, is the detail that the presence of that
"A" starport on Fulacin was no secret!  So even if the Impies had not a
clue that the starport was a forward staging area for the Zhos, they 
knew it was there, and that therefore it could be captured by the Zhos
and used against the Imperium.  Therefore it would be disabled or defended
in the face of a Zho advance in the region, rendering it useless...
    Also, the subsidiary notion that the Impies could discover and
neutralize the secret base on Fulacin without the Zhos finding out before
the war began is a trifle bizarre.  Or are the Zhos stupid enough to not
bother checking these things at the last minute, the way real militaries
do...

    Quite.  Note that the Zhos lost the war in a big way as a result of 
that particular attack.
    Why did the Zhos try it?  Maybe they are in love with decapitating
strikes like the lads in the RCES?  Maybe (definitely, from what I
recall of the war) the Zho in charge of military operations against the
Impies was an imbecile?  Maybe they intended the attack to fail, thus
giving the Impies the "victory" necessary to push armistice talks to
completion before the Impies could take any territiry away from the
Consulate?

The problem is; a) The same companies aren\'t shipping short and long
distance, b) In shipping (which costs alot more than simple mail)
people who ship short distances are going to be ill inclined to
subsidize the long distance shippers.

First of all, you can\'t igore fuel costs (yes you can get if for free
at a gas giant, but you spend more in playing the crew to get out there
than you save, and that doesn\'t take into account costs of streamlining
and purification).  Second of all, the biggest cost in shipping is paying
off the cost of the ship and maintianing it (by a big margain) and these
are certainly not going to be the same.

The biggest problem I have with the way things are set up is , the rich
corporations are going to be the ones making the short jumps while
the ones making longer jumps are the ones just scrapping by.  This
is the opposite of how things are described.

	However, the Aslan do not see honor as relative.  It is a 
concrete item as real as a slap in the face for them.  In their own words:
-from Solomani&Aslani, pg 44-

	\'...the Trokh term translated as "honor" - means nothing
	but "spirit of strength", a disiplined life devoted to
	the *proper and balanced way of doing things.*  Honor is
	not what we strive for - it is what we are.
		When we seek balance...when we speak openly and act
	forthrightness, we act honorably...In contrast stand the
	deed called rukhta: nurder...ruining a good reputation...These
	acts are anathema to us..Aslan who commit such crimes 
	cease to be Aslan.\'

	Immediately, we see the Aslan who believes that some actions make 
one cease to be an Aslan -ie they become *barbarric*, out of balance, 
uncultured.

-from S&A, pg 57-
	\'Non-Aslan, particuarly the Solomoni and the Imperials, seem
	to take special delight in surprise attacks and ambushes.  To
	our way of thinking, these ploys...fall under the classification
	of crimes of honor.\'

	One who commits such an act -ceases to be Aslan.-  Imagine the 
acts you would have to commit for other pople to consider you *inhuman*.  
Not nice acts, huh?

>  
> When you compare to Klingons in the ST universe, they also have an extreme

	But thiers is an honor of doing,  a type of \'What does not kill 
me\' and all that.  An Aslan does not gain honor- he IS honor.  There is 
as much to gain from avoiding an unnecessary fight in Aslan eyes and not 
avoiding a necessary fight.  Imagine a Klingon gaining honor for avoiding 
a fight...

> I don\'t think that any army, whatever the level of honor of race or region

> or full victory.

	Perhaps true for any human army you may think about (but maybe 
not, there are Aslan who are biologically human).  But the Aslan are not 
human, and cannot be judged by human standards.

	As a final reason, consider this Aslan saying (translated loosely):
	-Lean honor is better than fat shame.-
	Yes, the Aslan could have used a sneak attack, but all they would 
be left with was their \'fat shame\' of their crimes against honor.

	No, Im not an Aslan, but I know one in an RPG.

 Hmmm. Starhawk in space?
 Anyway, the official religion of the Imperium in
my campaign is Babylonian. That\'s pretty pagan. Currently
Inanna is rising to the head of the Imperial pantheon
promoted by the current Royal Family over the older
head Erishkigal, Queen of the dead. This has sparked
various religious debates and conflict of numerous
worlds (like the Greens and the Blues in Byzantium).
The Devnaree Collective did a competition dungeon
based around one of these worlds.
 I have a bunch of Sumerian and Babylonian reworked
myths.on-line somewhere. Innanna goes of to visit the
underworld on her grav-bike, Dumuzi, because of his
lazy attitude, has taken on the additional role of being
the patron of the unemployed, etc, etc. If people are
interested I can post segments. You might be able to find
the whole scenario on-line. I did post a few to the
archives.
   Jo Grant

"Having a pilot who belives in reincarnation is not

d\'s oldest bank
singlehandedly.
 Picture this, Aslan lord says to his youngest: "Son,
it is time for you to go make your mark in the world. To
make it particularly challenging I am only going to give
you outdated equipment and send you off to fight the
might of the Imperium." Aslan son looks wonderstruck and
intensely greatful.
 In another room of the estate a collection of Aslan
wives and executives hold a committee meeting.
 W1: "Well, our lord and master has done it again."
 W2: "I have D1, D2, and D3 waiting outside. They
just finished their degress as Pretentious Buisness College
and are fluent in Human."
 W3: "How will that leave us for trainees?"
 W2: "There are another three daughters due to graduate
in the next 4 years. We should be fine."
 W1: "Send them in, we\'ll brief them."
 So the Aslan son prepares to go off and battle brainlessly
while his cousins obtain immigrant visas to the Imperium.
No problem being hired on, I would think. Given their rather
aggressive attitude to business, may leading business are
likely to compete for their skills. Rising highly therein
they can quickly reach the point of being able to inflict
amazing economic damage.
 If their backup team of Aslan female lawyers are on
the ball they will have things sewn up so that their clan
may *own* half of Tobia by the time his hopeful nibs
gets there.
  Makes sense to me...

Is it conceivable that the attack on Rhylanor had little or nothing to do
with the Impies at all?  It\'s counter-intuitive, but it IS possible that
whoever ordered the attack on Rhylanor did it for a reason wholly internal
/political to Zhodane.  I.e. to prove that "we must make peace" or "your
party\'s ideas for running this war suck!" or "that bastard admiral has been

is that the attack was PLANNED to fail, for some extenuating circumstance.
Just an idea.

The material I have (The Jumpspace Article by Marc Miller), and the way 
jump works in my campagn.

Jump-points, are simply the point in space-time that you jump from/to.  
Your real-space-time vector (relative to galactic coordinates) is 
preserved through jump-space.

Generally you can jump from any-point to any-other-point.  In practice 
your choice of jump-points is going to be constrained by the concervation 
of momentum, and the relative motion of star-systems.

You will want to emerge from jump-space with a position such that your 
vector in-system will take you in the direction of the planet you are aiming
at.
So you manoeuver in the first system, to set up a vector relative to your 
jump exit point that will do this.
If this involves a large vector in the first system, this may limit where 
you can jump from.

Interesting idea....
Yes it would work, but it would only tell you the size of the jump being 
made.

Though if you could see the jumping ship, and record the sequence of the 
jump-grid initialisation (via visual, neutrino scans..whatever), you 
might be able to (with enough computing power) reconstruct the 
jump-initialisation, and then work backwards to the jump-vector, and 
hence the destination!

>Aslan are honorable, not stupid!

Several (human) historical cultures have lived on the premise of Honor
being the most important part of life. Feudal Japan is one such expample.
To them, Honor was the single most important factor. However, this Honor
did not preclude them from performing some of the more ingenious military
campaigns of the time. Even as late as the 20th century, Japan was still
performing sneak attacks. However, a surprise attack is only (usually)
sneaky and dishonorable to the victim. To the victory, a surprise attack is
usually a military action pulled-off with unusual brilliance.

Given that the Aslans find just as Honorable to avoid an unnecessary fight,
I see no reason why they wouldn\'t use surprise to their advantage. After
all, which is more honorable: to lead a force into defeat only because you
gave up the advantage of surprise, or to strike an enemy who was so foolish
as to not even take adequate precautions against such an attack?

That is all I have to say.

When was the US at war with France?  One French ship was taken as a price 
by an American privater, but I wouldn\'t call that a war.  The war of 1812 
was less a war about impressing american sailors than it was about 
forcing the British to leave the North West territories.  (And in MHO it 
was ill fought, ill planned and did nothing to strengthen US standing in 
the world.  As for Pancho Villa, the Texas Rangers who fought him had to

The codes of Cn and Dn refer to Chirpper and Droyne populations present
on the planet (in addition to the regular population).  The number, 
multiplied by 10, is the percentage of the total population that is
Chirpper/Droyne.

Ownnership by one of the 7 (or is it 9?) major clans?  Not sure really,
and I don\'t remember where the info is.

Yes, starting with MTrav (especially once DGP did _Vilani and Vargr_), the
codes for Vargr world were revised.  Instead of just using a generic "Va",
a whole series of codes were developed for each of the different "political
entities" within the Vargr Extents.
   Va  Non-aligned Vargr world
   Vf  Dzarrgh Federate
   Vu  United Followers of Augurgh
   V2  Windhorn Pact of Two
   V6  Assemblage of 1116

Historical Notes:

1790s - The new US Navy takes on their former allies the Napoleonic french
over matters of freedom of the seas and freedom of trade - the economic 
lifeline of the United States.

There were a few clashes between regular naval vessels, including the first
victories for the USS Constitution.


1914 - The US Army, in response to raids by Pancho Villa, nationalize various
national guard and militia units and sends them to Texas.  After continued
raids, Pershing sends troops into Mexico in pursuit.
They don\'t catch him.

Yes, these codes represents Aslan Tlauku blocks. The information can
- as far as I remember - be found in Solomani & Aslan from DGP.
In a sector overview in the Travellers\' Digest #18 or 19 you can also
find this information (I don\'t remember which one excactly).

It was in MTJ # 1.

The Va code is for those worlds, whic are predominantly Vargr, but not
a member of any interstellar state. It is called Vargr Non-Aligned.
All the Vargr codes can be found in Vilani & Vargr from DGP.

This is true only for Chirpers and Droyne. So while D4 means 40%
Droyne on this world, A1 representsa Tlauku block (don\'t remember
which one, but I suppose it involves the Yerlyaruiwo clan).

The Great Traveller Capmaign Survey (Mk.IIbis)


I thought it would be very interesting to re-run a survey that was quite
successful last year.  Basically, I\'d like to find out who on the list is
playing Traveller, and (generally) what "flavor" of the game you are playing.

If you PLAY or REFEREE a Traveller game, please take a couple of minutes
to respond.  I\'ll post a summary and analysis of the results to the TML once
I feel like I\'ve recieved all the responses I\'m going to get.

If you know someone who\'s not on the TML, please forward this to them
(particularly the GEnie discussion groups!).  The reply address is:
wildstar@qrc.com, or by postal mail to Guy Garnett, 14007 Eagle Ct.,
Rockville, MD, 20853 *USA*


HOW MANY Traveller campaigns do you participate in:
	As a PLAYER? 
	AS A REFEREE?

HOW OFTEN do you play Traveller?


For EACH CAMPAIGN that you participate in, WHICH RULES set do you use:
	Classic Traveller (including Starter Traveller and The Traveller Book)
	Traveller 2300 or 2300AD
	MegaTraveller
	Traveller: The New Era
	Other (some have reported playing "GURPS Traveller" in the past)

For EACH CAMPAIGN that you participate in, DESCRIBE the SETTING of the game:
	Historical 3rd Imperium (Imperial or alien, set before circa 1000)
	Classic 3rd Imperium (Imperial or alien, since circa 1000)
	Traveller 2300 or 2300AD Universe
	Imperial Rebellion Era
	Hard Times or Collapse Era
	New Era (Reformation Colaition and surrounds)
	New Era (Regency and surrounds)
	New Era (other or Pocket Empire)
	Original Campaign (comments and description welcome!)

For EACH CAMPAIGN, HOW MANY people participate?

For EACH CAMPAIGN, HOW LONG have you been playing this campaign?


Thanks, and I\'ll post the results to XBOAT, and mail them to anyone
who asks me for a copy ...

You can\'t in CT; jump ships must have a displacement of at least 100 tons.

There\'s a loophole in MT, though.  Jump drives can be no smaller than 2
cubic meters, as I recall.  So a jump drive and it\'s fuel could fit in
twelve cubic meters.  If a jump-1 drive, it would move a 100 cubic meter
ship; if jump-6, a 28.5 cubic meter ship; about two displacement-tons.
It\'s not a vacc suit, though, and you\'d need to fit a computer, power
source, and life support into a displacement ton of volume.  Maybe 
something at tech-20 or so would be close to a "jump" suit in MT.  There\'s 
no rule that I know about in MT that would contradict this, which would
allow the construction of "jump-message torpedoes" that you could shove
out a cargo lock.  MT never mentiones a 100 ton limit, to my knowlege.

Looking at the numbers, my guess is that this "loophole" is actually an
error that was never caught in the ship design sequence, and that the
minimum size rule for jump drives should read:

  A jump drive may not be smaller than one + (jump number) displacement
  tons in volume; a jump-1 drive must be at least 2 tons in volume, a
  jump-6 drive at least seven tons in volume, and so on.

This brings back the old jump drive limits as seen in Classic Traveller.

This error may carry over to TNE, but I\'d have to check.

Cn/Dn:  one little twist is that while n is tenths of population, when n is
a zero it\'s read as ten; so "D0" is a near-wholly Droyne world.

The A(number) Aslan allegiance codes indicate that the world is controlled
by one or more Aslan clans in the same Tlaukhu voting bloc.  There are ten
voting blocs made up of various coalitions of the twenty-nine Aslan clans,
ranked in order of importance from "A0" (the Yerlyaruiwo-led voting bloc)
to "A9".  "A1" I know well -- it\'s the three-member voting bloc led by clan
Khaukeairl, which a character I once played was a member of.  "A2" is clan 
Syosuis, all by their lonesome (if you can call a clan of trillions of Aslan
*lonesome*).  I don\'t have the comprehensive Tlaukhu membership list handy.
"As" can indicate either a non-Tlaukhu clan or a mix of clans, with some
possibly Tlaukhu members.  Some odd allegiance codes for clans that are
outcast from the Hierate exist, but not in the Domain after the fall of the
Glorious Empire (post-1118).

Another one you may run into is O:(hex) on a captive world, which indicates
the world that owns it.

And there, of course, is the reason that *you* are a barbarrian and the 
Aslan are not.:)  *You* may see no reason why the Aslan would\'t use 
surprise, but *they* do.

Remember, the Aslan are *aliens*.  To attribute human characteristics to 
them is a wrong as to consider a rock intelligent.  Of course, you don\'t 
see the reasons, but they do.  The Japanese culture is/was no where near 
as honorable as the Aslan, since the concept translated from  the Aslan 
as \'honor\' bears *little if any* real resemblance to the Aslan concept of 
aokhaor or any of its many flavors.

This does not mean that the Aslan would *never* use suprise attacks, but 
that they would *never use it first*.  The Aslan would never pull a 
\'Pearl Harbor\' on an enemy, and to consider then \'Japanese Lions\' would 
be trivilaizing them

Wow! (Well for me anyway). What a thought! There are plenty of reasons why
not - in theory there are minimum sizes for jump drive, power plant, etc. in
CT, MT and (I think) FF&S, all of which would normally preclude such a small
jump-capability. However, you can get tiny powerpacks to provide energy for
laser and fusion weapons and to power battledress, etc. so maybe the rules
could be bent accordingly.

There are some other problems. The vacc suit would be an extremely confined
space for a week\'s jump (not so bad in my game where jumps only take about
24 hours). The person has to have food, water, heating and armour - the last
to protect against the strange effects of jump space which, due to the small
size of the vacc suit\'s grid is likely to be pretty much pressing against
the suit\'s visor (watch your astrojumper go nuts with jump sickness). Then
there\'s all the waste recycling (okay, standard vacc suits have it but this
is a week or two\'s worth), plus there\'s all the maneouvre drives (jet packs,
whatever) required to take you out to the 100 diameter jump distance, etc.
plus all the rigours of being such a tiny target in space with other traffic
around (fried by a passing fusion exhaust, etc.)

It sounds pretty damn dangerous, but it could be used in some hairy
adventures! Especially since I allow jumps to occur (at increased
probability of misjump) within 100 diameters - one could have stormtroopers
popping into existence in the sky only a few miles above the planet\'s
surface! Okay, so they wouldn\'t all pop out at once, and a fair few would
pop out around the wrong planet or in deep space (marines are expendable)...

I can\'t remember the issue number, but I recall "jump message-torpedoes" being 
referred to in TD or MTJ.
Surely the biggest problem for a Jump-Suit is the 2-weeks stuck inside a suit, 
in Jump-space! <staring out into the void with noweher to go to> (and closing
the visor for 2 weeks will give you claustrophobia if nothing else does!
If message-torpedoes are usable, the thing I\'d be afraid of is the Nuke-jump-
torpedo!  A bunch of those dropping out of Jumpspace, from who knows where, at 
100 diams and dropping straight down before exploding.....

Seriously, though, nuke-jump-torpedos have been discussed, with the
main problem being that they\'re just too damned expensive, and yet
still vulnerable to the same anti-missile systems to which other
missiles are vulnerable.

EVAs while in jump!).  A drop capsule might be able to provide the 
protection.

In any event the week and a halfs life support would need a lot of space!

I got it exactly backwards about the jump drive size limits.  MegaTraveller,
while vague on the subject, never suggests that jump drives can be smaller
than the limits that I suggested in my previous letter.  In fact, it never
mentions anything about how many "jump units" are needed for ships of 
volumes that aren\'t on the table on page 65 of the Ref\'s Manual, but the
progression is fairly clear.  If anything, MT implies that a starship may
not be smaller than 100 displacement tons.  Of course, if it isn\'t 
*explicitly* prohibited anywhere, you could take the view that it\'s 
possible. 

It\'s FF&S for TNE that has the two cubic meter minimum jump-drive size, and
if that is a bug, could be corrected as I mentioned in my previous letter.
However, if it isn\'t a bug, and fuel requirements for ultra-tech jump drives
shrink as in MT, then the "jump suit" is possible for technology beyond the
Imperial standard.  Drifting off the xboat charter slightly, the details 
for a TL-21 "jump suit" in TNE could be as follows: 

 * Two kiloliters for a jump-6 drive.  The field could contain 28.5 kL, so
    it could be ruled that the jumper is safe from jump sickness.
 * One kiloliter for LHyd fuel (at x0.5 as per MegaTraveller for TL-21).
 * You don\'t need a computer if the occupant has a computer implant and a
    neural jack; that computer would be equivalent to a TL-16 machine!  Do
    jump calculations in your head!  In fact, just implant the computer in 
    the suit.  Take two, they\'re small.  (If you insist on a *real* TL-21 
    computer from TNE, add a kiloliter.)  You might be able to use an
    advanced hand computer, too.  
 * Install a communicator and power source.  Even with a 1000 AU radio and
    small anti-matter plant, this won\'t go over 0.021 kL.  You could even
    throw in a radar corner-reflector to make the suit more obvious if the
    radio fails, as a freebie.
 * Life support?  Use a tiny 12-hour TL-14 PLSS A -- and also a fast drug
    injector.  Jump space is dull; using fast drug, a 168 hour jump transit
    seems like only 2.8 hours!  Bring antidote along for use during pickup.
    Virtually negligible space.
 * Oh, the suit\'s occupant.  Less than a workstation...say, 0.2 kL?  They
    just need to fit inside, don\'t need work space.

There\'s no maneuvering pack.  Let a ship drop you off, and come get you.
If you *insist* on landing, use a bigger PLSS and pick a vector that will
drop you into orbit around the planet, then use a re-entry kit to land. 

Hmmm.  Most of the weight is in the jump drive -- as much as 4000 kg.  The
volume comes out somewhere under 4 kL, without computers, and the price at
about a megacredit.  Throw in implant computers and price shoots up at 4.5
million each.  As a suit, it would be bigger and harder to move than a suit
of heavy battledress.  Maybe the jump-drive could be put in a "interstellar
maneuvering pack" that would attach and partly envelop a vacc suit, like a
re-entry kit.  Put a grav unit on the jump kit so it\'s easier to move.  May
want to consider switching the jump drive to use anti-matter.  This actually 
has some promise....

Welcome to the Club of the Attention-Deprived!

Speaking as a mediocre TML Personality (not as legendary as Cynthia or 
Wildstar, but more well-known than the average silent TML\'er), it seems 
that *you* want to start fresh and interesting new discussions, banter 
with the OldTimers, have your wrath feared across _both_ List\'s, and 
generally be Big Man on Campus.

O.K., so what does it take?  Well, perferably you should have been here 
at least a year before the List crashed back in about last September.  
The Collapse is the great divide between 

The OldTimers (ie. people who apparently have been playing the game 
  since Reagan\'s first term), who usually only post rarely (and who are 
  missed:  Glenn noted a while ago that the List suffer\'s for their absence)

and...

The YoungBloods (ie. people who have been posting to the List only since 
  after the Collapse),who are simply not as steeped in Traveller lore as 
  the OldTimers (Though some of us are pretty good in the sciences, and I 
  do what I can with politic\'s, personalities, adventures, and worlds)  

Now, the best way to be taken seriously in (X)TML is NOT to repost good 
articles, but instead to write up new ones.  Bring up new issues, or at 
least old issues in a new light.  Spend some time writing up adventures: 
refine the adventure, and post it: it doesn\'t have to be huge, just as long 
as it\'s good.  Design new worlds and societies, for the Classic, 
Rebellion, or (perferably) the New Era period.  Spend some time 
understanding where Traveller came from, and try to get as much of it\'s 
great history in your head as your wallet and clock will allow.

When you comment on a line of discussion, try to avoid "me-tooism".  
Strive to understand what\'s going on, and the core of the controversy.  
Then see if there\'s something everyone is missing, and point it out.  A 
very good example occured on XTML, where there was a raging fistfight 
over whether the Third Imperium is a Solomani/Vilani split or 99% 
Villani.  Before someone pointed out that the Solomani can (and did) use 
clones to beef up the population, the OldTimers were happly smashing each 
other\'s brains out over the mathamatically possible rate of population 
growth. ("Would the 200-year lifespan Vilani reproduce as quickly as the 
Solomani?" sticks in my head even today!)  

Note the two-sided sword that earns respect and get\'s one heard on 
(X)TML -- A: A good grasp of what is actually _possible_ (remember, a lot 
          of folk here have their B.S., Master\'s, and PhD\'s: they expect 
          consistency and logic in their game)  One of the major problems 
          of Virus is it\'s apparent lack of connection with reality, and 
          seemingly "deus ex machina" nature, a problem that - to GDW\'s 
          credit - has been partly dealt with.  We await "Vampire Ship\'s" 
          for the definitive explaination of what Virus is, and how it isn\'t 
          the same thing as pure magic.

           B: A good grasp of Traveller Lore.  The Shot that Ended the 
          Bloodbath used a quote from "Solomani and Aslan" to clinch his 
          argument.  To get the Good Stuff, you need to contact 
          Rodge@cyberspace.com (Rodge Sanger): he has nearly everything 
          for sale (Sorry: NOT the glorious "Vilani & Vargr" aka Cogs & 
          Dogs, or "Aslan & Solomani" aka Rats & Cats).  

It\'s possible to be heard strictly using A or B, but using both is best.

And what if you aren\'t a science major, and you don\'t have a personal 
library of Traveller Material (including the Kr\'ee supplement, the book 
that seperates The Boys From The Men)? 

Well, then, first of all you should focus your studies on the New Era: 
the Era is so young that anyone here can become a master of it, if they 
buy everything from GDW regarding it, subscribe to Sword of the Knight\'s 
"The Traveller Chronicle",_and_ "Challange".  You should also start 
boning up on science and good science fiction works, so you can fence 
with the best.  Also, you should obtain some of the MegaTraveller 
background material (I recommed either "The Rebellion" or 
"Imperial Encyclopedia": you may consider getting the MegaTraveller game.
All of which GDW still has back issues of.), if you want to get more 
background info of the war that led to the Collapse. (say, your 
adventurers are set in Antares Sector, and you need to know why Archduke 
Brzk decided to seccede from the Imperium and create the Antares League).

Finally, what if you are slightly short of financial resources?  Then, 
first, you need to stick with the New Era.  Then, you _need_ to have
   A: The Basic RuleBook
   B: Fire, Fusion & Steel
   C: The World\'s Builder\'s Guide
   D: Vampire Ship\'s (whenever it comes out)
   E: Fire, Fusion & Steel II (again, whenever it comes out) 
This will total to about $120, U.S.
 
With this, you can produce your own universe.  A good grasp of this 
material will aquaint you with the basic _technical_ issues of Traveller. 
(and technical issues is a major subject on (X)TML.)

But what if you are more interested in the softer issues, like politics and 
societies?  Then you want
   A: The Basic RuleBook
   B: Path of Tears
   C: The Alien Sourcebooks (Hiver + whatever has been recently released)
   D: The Regency Sourcebook (what *I\'m* waiting for)

And if you want to concentrate on military issues?
   A: The Basic Rulebook
   B: Striker II (Land combat)
   C: Fire, Fusion & Steel (to make all those gorgeous grav tanks)
   D: Smash & Grab
   E: Brilliant Lancers (starship combat boardgame)
   F: Battle Riders (as above, but for fleet combat)

and it would be good if you can get "Trillion Credit Squadron" and "High 
Guard", both from classic traveller.  Great stuff for Subsector-wide to 
Sector-size wargaming and Fleet Actions.

Yes, but Virus still stinks.  SOme hate it for technical reasons.  I hate 
it because it makes the Traveller universe much less complex and a lot 
more duller (and low-tech, too!).  Also, It just isn\'t as grand as 
the pre-Rebellion Imperium.

I hope that I\'ve been of some help.

Try David Johnson\'s Melbourne Times (something like djohnson@nasa.gov?)? The

nominally TNE but most of its stuff transfers fairly easily to CT/MT (and
it\'s a good mag).

In "Survival Margin" I think Strephon sent a message with Avery.
I believe the words were to the effect of:
get your self an heir, or better yet a daughter.

It looks like Strephon had the marraige(sp?) in mind. Along with the 
information package (does anybody know what was in it) it looks like he 
wanted the Regency to have as many chances for survival as possible.

Avery could have been the heir to the Iridium Throne. But with all the 
conflicting reports about Strephon\'s death, and him refusing to be tested 
I don\'t think he has a strong case. With a marraige(sp?) to Norris, he 
has a bit of legitamacy.

Hm, nope. TML and XBOAT arrive the their usual psudeo-clockwork fashion,
as always. Do you receive digests or individual articles?

Yes! Me too! Well, no, actually, but I sympathize that sometimes it does
seem that some threads just terminate on one\'s own articles, when you 
were actually looking for some feedback. And I think you rate above
"mediocre mailing list personality" Alvin - maybe "acknowledged gadfly".

Uh, is K\'kree that rare? I bought mine mere months ago. Though I am curious 
why it says "Aliens Module 1" on the back and "Alien Module 2" on the
front...
What is the rarest Traveller book I wonder? Roger Sanger says he\'s still
looking for a copy of Signal GK (I think), doesn\'t he have, well, everything?

As for building up a Traveller library, if you don\'t have a CT library now,
don\'t start. MT can still be had, with a little luck (I got a nearly
complete set of books locally for $40! Some people would rather be rid of
it. Wierd). I\'d say, if you\'re just starting, stick to TNE. Although
it lacks the CT ambiance of bazillions of tiny 30 page black books.

And for actual new thoughts...

I was looking through 101 Vehicles the other day and it mentions one
recon drone which has no pilot, but is instead controlled by a robot
brain. In the preface of the book they make a brief statement about
equating MT computer CPs with robot intelligence points. The ratio they
give is 250 CP (I think) == 1 point of intelligence, giving TL 17 (?)
computers (Model 11) an INT of 4. They described this by saying that
above TL 15 synaptic processors become so reliable that they can be used
in starship computers, which require a lot more reliability than experimental
robot brains. Anyways, by this logic, most starship computers have the 
same capacity for intelligence as a worm or bug - little, if not none.

So, my question is, how can the Virus come along and make your pokey
Model 2/bis into a super-duper highly intelligent Virus computer??
This seems akin to a disease that make earthworms into rocket scientists.
I this Traveller or Star Trek?

No problem here either. Everything seems to be coming in OK.

In my mind the Virus is software. A very large & complex piece of 
software. This software is obviously for an AI. Because it\'s a piece of 
software all it needs is ram and storage space. Some of the computers the 
virus will not be able take over due to limitations, but for starship 
operations I assume there is gobs of memory and storage.

As for the Model 2/bis (I can\'t remember the tech level so I may be 
wrong) it is the equivilent of a Cray super computer. This is not hard to 
believe when you consider a pentium (one that isn\'t glitched) operates 
about the same speed as a Cray 1.

As for the program recutting a chip.....maybe some of the higher ones 
with internal switching.

velocity vector\' of a ship that emerges from jump space.  The following is
strictly \'pseudo-science\' that I\'m adapting for my campaign.

A ship \'conserves velocity\' when it emerges from jump space, that is, it
will have whatever velocity vector it had when it entered j-space.  My
question is:  velocity vector _relative_ to what?  After all, there is no
absolute frame of reference from which one can calculate a velocity vector.

My solution:  the velocity vector is the sum off all the ships force vectors
relative to _every_ body in the universe.  I\'m only really thinking about
gravitational force, which is proportional to the mass of the body _and_ is
inversely proportional to the distance seperating the body from the ship.

In a jump, the only vectors that really make a difference are those produced
by ship-planet, ship-planet\'s sattelites and ship_system primary.  Other
vectors have an effect, but it\'s negligible in proportion to the \'major\'
vectors.  No computer could possibly calculate more than a small proportion
of these vectors...

Now, I introduce some black magic.  When these vectors fall below an
arbitrary value (say, Planck\'s constant multiplied by c^2), quantum
uncertainty can have some unpredictable effects on the \'resultant\' vector. 
The \'resultant\' vector will always be off by a random amount and direction,
possibly no more than a few ms^-1 and a couple of seconds of arc, but it can
sometimes be more (some sort of random distribution).  So, you can never be
_sure_ of your exact velocity when you emerge from j-space, and (at the risk
of awakening a sleeping monster), it makes it impossible to simply attach a
jump drive to a planetoid and send it to cause havoc - without some form of
course correction on emergence it will miss it\'s target.

Well...my physics isn\'t real good, and it\'s only a game after all, but it\'s
a working theory.  I\'ll brace myself for the flames ;-)

So - I suspect GDW will still make use of the hanging threads left

any ideas as to what we will see?  Or will this sort of disappear like 
the hints of a K\'Kree invasion did right before TNE came out?  My 
own guess is a rebellion by one of the non-human subject races in the 
Consulate.  Given the psionic nature of the Consulate, it would be pretty 
tough to have a prole rebellion.  Or, there could be some sort of a group 
of psionic overlords who have decided to spread their psionic rule 
regardless of the desires of the Consulate.  To do this, they must first 
sieze control of the Consulate.  When the Regency Sourcebook comes 
out, some of the more bloody-minded gamers may find it a dull place.  
Having an ongoing rebellion against a semi-friendly government could 
generate lots of potential adventures for those ex-Marine PCs running 
around the Regency.

with any useful response.  Or, if there is a response, somebody else beats
you to it.  Or, you inadvertently start up some major brouhaha over Imperial 
Army structure, Feudal Technocracies or gun laws.

I don\'t post anywhere near as often as I did before the Great Collapse (the 
TML hiatus).  This has little to do with the people and topics, and quite a lot 
to do with increasing work demands.  This grownup stuff sucks.  I would 
not put myself on a par with the "Great TML Luminaries," but I\'ve been 
around here long enough to have some clue.  In general, TML/XTML seems

I\'m pretty sure most of the folks on this list are going to buy it 
regardless of what I say in my review, but i thought I\'d say a few 
things, if only to see if we can get some discussion going.

First, the big question: is it worth the money?  As much as it pains this 
Traveller fan, the answer is "probably not."  There are a couple of 
reasons for my opinion, and I\'ll discuss the specifics in a minute, but 
the central objection I have has more to do with style than with 
substance.  What I mean by that is the presentation method selected is 
less than useful for gaming purposes, whatever the merits it has as a 
literary device.

(warning: excursion into literary theory follows - search for ***** to skip)

*******************************************************************

For the purposes of my arguement, I divide the presentation of 
roleplaying material into three catagories, associated with three ways of 
dealing with a text:

1) Classic - "There is one text, and the text is true"  
	In this view, the text is the source of truth and admits of only one 
interpretation.  In much the same way that a fundamentalist views the bible 
as the literal truth, the GM and players view the world description as 
literally true.
	This is the style of the earliest roleplaying games, like D&D,
Classic Traveller, etc.  There is one point of view, the game universe is
described from that point of view, and there is no abiguity.  Most
roleplaying games continue to follow this style of presentation.
	What this means for the consumer is that what is described is 
what is really going on.  In GoodOldDee\'nDee, Orcs are evil, they are 
always evil, and you should kill them because they are evil.  In Classic 
Traveller, the Zho are evil plotting mindstealers, they always steal your 
mind, and you should kill them because they are evil.

2) Modern: "There are multiple texts, each with its own truth"
	In this point of view, texts do not have independent truths, but 
only have authors, who infuse their points of view into the texts they 
create.  This attitude has its origins in the study of history in the 
19th century and the development of biblical criticism around the same 
time.  Biblical scholars, for example, began to use textual criticism to 
divide up the bible into parts written by those who knew Jesus, parts 
written later, parts added to support later changes in church teaching, 
and so on.
	Fewer roleplaying games use this technique, but it\'s out there.  
Some of the cyberpunk style games use marginal comments to point out the 
errors in official press accounts or library data, for example.  Done 
well, the technique conveys a sense of how different groups differ from 
one another and why they are at odds.
	In prctice, this can cause a shift in mindset in the course of 
play.  MegaTraveller, as described by DGP, was in a sense the 
transformation of Traveller from a "Classic" to a "Modern" point of 
view.  This is most clearly seen in the two alien modules DGP produced, 
where the racial descriptions are done both from the point of view of the 
race itself, in contrast of the alien modules from Classic Traveller, 
where the description is presented as being "objective."  Here, the Zho 
aren\'t evil, they\'re just misunderstood, because the Imperium made us 
think they were evil, but we can kill them anyway and blame it on the 
programming.

3) Post-Modern: "There are multiple texts, none of which are true"
	Perhaps eventually we\'ll get a better word than post-modern (talk 
about a weird term), but until we do I\'ll use it to signify the current 
literary attempt to reduce literature to an undiferentiated mass, where 
all texts have the same value, which, in short, is nothing.  In 
post-modern thought, there is no "truth," only the interaction of the 
reader and the text, the text acting on the mind of the reader to create 
some state in the readers mind.
	This is the most rare sort of roleplaying product approuch, 
though one could place many White Wolf products (Vampire, Werewolf, 
etc.), where the creation of atmosphere is of central importance - lots 
of illustrations, strange typefaces, etc.  Just compare the graphic style 
of White Wolf products with the typical GURPS sourcebook if you want to 
see what I mean.
	The Hivers and Ithklur sourcebook falls in this third catagory.  
The description of the Hiver is clearly intended to create a sense of 
paranoid confusion within the reader, as it presents multiple points of 
view, all of which are contradictory.  Moreover, in the segment on 
playing and refereeing the Hiver (pages 44 and 45), no attempt is made 
to confirm or deny the rumors presented in the text.  Essentially, the 
authors take the position that the reader should "take the various 
\'facts\' and think about them."  
	This may be fine for a work of fiction, where engaging and
chalenging readers is an appropriate goal, but when I buy a roleplaying
product I like my aliens defined and outlined, thank you very much.  H&I 
is written with a high degree of ambiguity and an intention that the 
reader play a large role in interpretation.  Frankly, I think this lets 
down most gamers, by failing to provide concrete details to plan a 
campaign around.

**************************************************************

Well, enough ranting.  What\'s actually in this thing?  Well, it\'s 92 
pages long, half devoted to Hiver, 40% to Ithklur, and the remaining 10% 
for designers notes, forms and charts, plus yet another advert for 
Vampire Fleets.

The sections on each race include history, current social structure, and 
career generation for Hiver and Ithklur PCs and NPCs.  The Hiver section 
contains no real surprises for those who have read the Classic Traveller 
module on Hiver - some sections seem to be almost verbatim transcriptions 
from the earlier material, though I didn\'t actually try to compare things 
line by line.  Those who have been following the Traveller News Service 
in Challenge will be happy to know that the "Corn Dog" mystery is finally 
solved - they\'re a copy of Terran corn dogs, made from sea slugs (yum!).

The only major new element introduced is the introduction of psionic 
Hivers.  They are rare (one in one million), and their psionic power is 
low grade.  It manifests itself through "Dreams," brought about by the 
cumulative thoughts of those around them.  These dreams have predictive 
power, and can be used as plot devices (imagine that!).  As a side note, 
this explains where that passage that begins "I had a dream.  A dream of

this was something from one of Professor Ililek Kuligaan\'s books, but it 
turns out to be a dream by one of these psionic Hivers.  Fancy that.

The Ithklur stuff is essentially all original, and very unsatisfying.  
The Ithklur seem like the Three Stooges doing Monty Python routines with 
guns.  Stupid, that\'s what I think.  There are a whole series of jokes 
based on bad Saturday Night Live comedy routines and obscure references 
to American history (yes, Dave, I know what "54-40 or fight!" means, and 
it\'s a stupid joke).  I\'ll say it again - the Ithklur design is Stupid!!!

Anyway, that\'s what I think.  I\'d be interested to hear what you guys 
think, once you read your copies of H&I.

Oh, one last thing - there\'s a reference on page 57 of H&I to a Ithklur 
prisoner who was tortured and then _EATEN_ by K\'Kree.  How did this get 
past the editors?  Or maybe the Ithklur will turn out to be Berliners, in 
the same way as President Kennedy (jelly doughnut, anyone?).

I think you are little off here.  The fact that there is not one absolute
reference frames doesn\'t mean that there isn\'t a frame than can\'t be
applied to every point in the universe (in fact there are an infinite
number).

The conserves velocity rule is acutally very clear.  Take _any_ reference
frame, after the ship jumps it has to have the same velocity vector
with respect to that reference frame.  This has the additional meaning
that every trip you have to make up the differences in planetary and
stellar motions.  I don\'t know how big the velocity differences are
between stars, but if you ever found a way to jump accross the galaxy
I think it\'s going to be non-trivial.

I don\'t think this would work (ihmo).  for 2 reasons

1. In the initial phase os such an attack, the attacking troops would be 
very close to the edge of the jump field.  (One note I have somewhere 
says that you need at least one meter between you and the jump field in 
order to survive)

2. Drilling in through the hull whilst in jump, means that you are 
destroying part of the Hulls jump grid.  Doing this while the jump field 
is active, and the ship in jump, will probably destroy the ship!

That\'s original?

Better yet, I encourage people to vote with their wallets.  Refrain from
buying the book sight unseen - peruse a copy at your local game store, and
decide for yourself if this is the sort of material you really want to see
in Traveller.  If, after looking for youself, you decide that this is what
Traveller is really about, by all means spend your money.

If, on the other hand, you think that a Science-Fiction game should pay more
attention to science and less to fantasy; that a good alien race should be
more than John Cleese in a rubber Godzilla suit, then tell GDW so in the
manner that\'s most likley to get their attention: Don\'t Buy the Product.

Repeat the procedure as necessary on future occasions until GDW\'s writers
get the message (or are eliminated from the genre by the magic of market
forces, for failing to get the message after frequent repetition by the
game-buying public).

Probably.  If GDW\'s past performance is any guide, they\'ll notice the
money to be made in the collectable card trading game business in another
year or so.   Just in time to spend their money developing a product
which reaches market the same month that the fad becomes passe.

What editors?

GDW\'s quality control has improved since the MegaTraveller days, but they\'re
still not up to what they should be.  Something about busy production
schedules and the need to ship a product on schedule, I\'m sure - reality
does interfere with getting a product up to best possible standard.

On the other hand, it might behoove GDW to take a careful look at their
competitors, such as Steve Jackson Games, who seems to be able to release
high-quality products regulary (and at least at the store where I shop,
garners considerably more shelf space than GDW).

On the other hand, perhaps the Ithklur ARE vegetables.

Thanks Mark, I enjoyed the laugh. GDW shoots itself in the foot (again).
Clearly they haven\'t decided various parts of the story re the Hivers, etc.,
hence the way it\'s been left with several options. Perhaps a more sensible
approach would have been the "Ref\'s" section with a detachable or
photocopiable few pages of "Player" info - this latter containing the
contradictory gobbldigook and the Ref bit telling you the truth.

One of the books (perhaps Starship Op\'s Manual?) does mention the
possibility of EVAing in jump space. I think it IS possible, you just can\'t
afford to \'stand up\' on the hull or your head \'disappears\'.

>2. Drilling in through the hull whilst in jump, means that you are

Ah non monsieur! The hull grid can take quite large amounts of damage
without necessarily destroying or throwing the ship out of jump - somewhere
(Starship Op\'s Manual?) is mentioned the fact that hull breaches might
sometimes cause the field to dip, perhaps even into the ship, but given that
the field is at least 1 metre from the hull, to get it dipping inside the
hull would require a hole at least 2 metres in diameter (to a first
approximation).

Jump-hijackers aren\'t impossible, just insane! I\'d do the old "I\'m an
innocent passenger, please ignore the huge bulge under my armpit" hijack
approach any day of the week... :-)

Late in the Carter Administration?  Traveller was released in the summer of
\'77, and Carter was inaugurated in January of that year.  I\'d say that _I\'ve_
been playing since _early_ in the Carter Administration. (-:

 Including the one that uses the jumping ship itself as a frame of 
 reference.  That makes my velocity vector zero, and I\'ll come out 
 of jump with a vector of zero.  Since my vector is zero, I\'m at 
 rest, and "compensation" is trivial - I point my ship the way I 
 want to go, and start going there.

 Hmmm...  There\'s obviously a flaw in the reasoning above...

 You\'re right, but that\'s because when you jump, _all_ vectors 
 relative to your chosen frame are preserved - including that of 
 the entire universe, if you choose yourself as the frame.

 The velocity differences can range from negligible (for a 
 microjump over a distance that would take more than a week to
 cover in realspace) to 600 m/s for a jump exactly 180 degrees
 across our galaxy to a point exactly as far from the center of 
 galactic rotation as Sol.  It can also go higher, as the orbital 
 velocity of any body is measured relative to its primary, and when 
 the body is in the portion of its orbit such that it is moving in 
 the same direction as the primary, relative to the galactic center 
 of rotation, the velocity vectors add.  For what it\'s worth, the 
 orbital velocity of Terra relative to Sol is 29.72 km/s.  For 
 Traveller (World Builder Handbook) purposes, that\'s a G3V primary 
 with a planet of size 8 and density 5.5 g/m^3 in orbit 3.  (Orbit 
 0 is vacant in the Sol system.)

 Now, the question that comes before the court is "What really 
 happens to a ship in jumpspace?"  If momentum is conserved (which
 is really what they\'re saying when they talk about conserving 
 vectors), then it must _always_ be conserved - which means that 
 either the matter and its associated momentum is somehow 
 "available" to realspace while a ship is in jump. or it is somehow 
 transferred to one or more bodies that remain in realspace, and 
 borrowed back from those same bodies, in exactly the same 
 quantities, when the ship exits realspace.  Of course, there\'s 
 also the problem of conservation of mass-energy as well; you can\'t 
 just have several hundred tonnes of matter just disappear for a
 week without some sort of compensation.

 I\'ve run up against this problem more than once, and never found a 
 satisfactory solution under CT or MT rules.  The TNE alternate
 rules from FF&S plus a little massaging of numbers _might_ (I 
 haven\'t yet sat down to work out the details) allow a solution 
 based on (but not identical to) 2300\'s stutterwarp - raise the
 cost, limit the "speed", and change the discharge requirement to a 
 time-in-operation based one rather than a distance-based one.  
 Stutterwarp never has the ship out of realspace; the change of 
 position is instantaneous (like electron tunnelling is) and 
 doesn\'t affect any vectors associated with the mass of the ship.  
 Where the Modified Stutterwarp (MSW) differs from the CT/MT/TNE
 Jump Drive (JD) is in the vector adjustment to compensate for 
 differing stellar/planetary orbital velocities relative to the 
 Arbitrary Frame of Reference (AFR).  Under the JD paradigm,
 compensation is made strictly at the ends of interstellar transits 
 - you match the target body\'s orbital velocity either before you 
 go into jump, or after you come out - not during that week in 
 transit.  With MSW (or even standard SW), you can spread that 
 modification over the entire week of transit, thus saving that 
 time at either end of the journey.  The other effect that 
 Stutterwarp has, which I can\'t reasonably "fix" (if it needs 
 fixing at all), is that a Factor-6 MSW drive (capable of 6 parsecs 
 per week) will be able to do a one-parsec transit in about one 
 day, whereas _any_ JD will take a full week to do the job.  This 
 will likely change the character of individual systems (in-system 
 travel will probably be faster) and local/regional interstellar 
 polities (over the short interstellar haul, travel and comm will 
 be faster), but the overall Imperium will probably not change too
 much (over the long haul, it still takes just as long).  I think.  
 I\'ll have to explore this...

        Put simply, yes. The only exception that may exist is if they
actually own all manuscrips which the combined rules-set is based upon,
too, since they could also claim they are using "their" materials.

        Actually, I think it is probably illegal for you you to be doing
the project at all, just as it would be for you to make backups of software
(w/o permission) let alone recombinations of software, or photocopy other
books for your own use. I\'m not sure the "fair-use" clause would or would
not come into play,  either.

        Usual disclaimer: I\'m not a lawyer (yet), just making informed
speculation.

        Also, I\'m not sure how Canada handles Intellectual Propery Right
internally, either, but I\'m assuming they would be similar to us because of
all of the IPR treaties we have with them (and others).

        If you\'re really that worried about it, just ask GDW. While many
people here seem to think they\'re hard-asses because of their past stances
on their IPR\'s, I\'ve always thought them (both GDW and their positions)
reasonable, all things considered.

    'from' => 'Ethan Henry',
    'body' => 'So, on the weekend I caught (lord knows why) a documentary about
Vancouver (B.C.)\'s port, the biggest and busiest port in Canada.

They had crews go and follow the in-port happenings of a Greek
tramp freighter crew, getting their cargo loaded and unloaded,
a big, BIG wood pulp freighterwith their very modern dual-built-in
loading gantrys, some of the local port staff who pilot ships in,
a business that supplies food and supplies to ships and an 
interview with the Harbourmaster.

It occured to me (of course) that this is probably a lot like what a
starport would be like - lots of ships coming and going, cargo getting
loaded and unloaded, etc. There were a lot of interesting things that
I think would apply in campaigns...

Local Pilots. In order not to screw up the rather tricky job of 
moving these big ships into the rather tight port, a local pilot
comes aboard to bring the ship in from the harbour. At big starports,
this would probably be the norm to prevent pilots unfamiliar
with the starport procedures from messing up. Only at really big
starports though.

Land-based ports. Given the amount of cargo that needs to be loaded
and unloaded, unless you have a REALLY big orbital spaceport,
you\'re going to have to do it dirt-side. Given the high costs of 
orbital ports vs relatively cheap ground-based ones, you\'d better
have a darn good reason for having a huge orbital port. Also,
for reasons I\'ll mention in a bit, most ships would find it impossible
to use cargo shuttles.

Handling agents. A ship in port has to pay for a lot of things - 
the local pilot, berthing fees, taxes, excises, duties, food and
supply costs, etc. For a ship that spends a few days in any given
port, it\'s rather unlikely that the ship\'s captain will have the 
time and inclination to do all this himself. Thus, the handling
agent. Familiar with local customs, laws and business, he does all
that stuff and the captain pays him for all the ship\'s costs while
in port.

Cargo crews. Apparently in Vancouver, there are so many ships, sometimes
your cargo crew won\'t show up either \'cause the weather\'s bad and they all
stayed at home or there just aren\'t enough people to unload all the ships
in at a give time. Also, some types of cargo need special handling 
equipment, like grain or coal and if there\'s 8 grain ships in at once,
it might be tough sharing the grain loading equipment. Some starports
would have robots, of course, but this probably invites other problems
and worries, not to mention TNE virus effects.

Sailors\' taverns. I forget what it was called, but apparently in almost
every major port there\'s a bar/hotel called the Sailor\'s somethingorother.
It makes it a little easier for foreign crews to find their way around -
there\'s one stop where they can get a drink, meet other crews and find out
about local attractions. Most real ship crews phone home too, which
starship crews won\'t do, but there\'d presumably be an xboat drop for
sending letters home instead, if the spacers had a permanant home to send
anything to.

General Crowding. Any successful port soon outgrows itself. Vancouver 
apparently has ten or twenty ships anchored in the bay at any given time,
waiting for a berth. For most big starports (any type A, I\'d think)
there would be several ships waiting in orbit for a landing spot. 
Presumably, most planets would have a small orbital station where captains
could go to arrange an agent, etc while waiting, even if orbital cargo
loading
is impossible.

Big, BIG ships. PCs, in their 200-ton Free Traders, need to take very
profit-dense cargo to make money. This, however, probably isn\'t
the backbone of interstellar trade. If planets are like countries today,
some will produce lots of agricultural goods (like Canada, grain and 
wood pulp) and some will focus on manufactured goods (like Japan, where
there are literally no natural resources). For things like grain and
wood pulp, you ship them in the biggest ship possible that doesn\'t
break under it\'s own weight. Grain freighters would be in the thousands of
tonnes range, if not the tens of thousands. The same would go for
petroleum, wood products, even water to desert/arid worlds. PCs\' ships 
would be dwarfed beside these ships. In some cases, these big ships
might not even unload at the starport - why unload a crude oil tanker at
the starport when you can fly it right to the refinery? On some worlds,
this may be prohibited though, making it difficult to transport that amount
of cargo unless prior arrangements have been made.

Anyways, that\'s enough rambling, but it gave me quite a few ideas on how 
big starports might work.

I dunno.  The reason they do it with cargo ships is because compared
to other means of transportation, they are incredibly unmaneuverable.
An oil tanker moving at 5 knots (5.5 mph) needs over a mile to come
to a complete stop.  Steering becomes impossible at slower speeds,
hence the need for tugs.  In Traveller, we\'re talking about ships with
1G maneuverability minimum.

Thanks for the very kind words.  You know, I was trying to come up with
something along the lines of "Sneaks and ...." and I just couldn\'t think
of the second term.  I\'d like something that ryhmes, like "Rats and Cats"

Perhaps all you folks out there can take a crack at it and we can vote on

Ahhh... one of my favorite subjects! :)

In campaigns that I have run before I likened a starport to be a combination
of the modern international airport and a seaport.  Also with a little of
the truck stop thrown in for good measure.

This used to be a requirement in my campaigns.  I had a "pool" of pilots
that I had pre-gen\'ed with personalities.  This not only added some realism
to the campaign but some color.  Had one pilot that was always under the
infleunce at one of my starports. 

Kinda scary when you figure the Exxon Valdez... but that was the ship\'s
captain and not a harbor pilot.

Well... one of the JTAS issues mentioned containerizing cargo.  I have Port
Newark local to me to point to as an example.  I could definitely envision
uloading cargo in orbit container at a time and having special shuttles that
brought them dirtside.

Of course, I concede that bulk cargo such as grain, fuels, petrochemicals,
etc. would still have to be unloaded dirtside, I could still concieve of a
terminal in space that this stuff would be offloaded in bulk and then
transfered to smaller vessels that would take the cargo to individual
customers dirtside.

Mileage is going to vary  a lot from starport to starport.  Not only along
tech level lines but along economic lines.  

If a planet\'s economy has  a lot of unemployment, there are going to be a
lot more people available for menial labor and robots will not be in favor.
However, if there is less unemployment then robots will be in more favor
providing the local tech level supports it.

.. not to mention the fact that towns and a whole seperate economy are
going to grow out of the presense of a port.  Sailors on liberty are known
to be very free with their money and the locals know it.  

Stuff is going to be priced differently depending on how many ships are in
port at the time. 

As an aside:  When I was in the Navy it was common knowlege that the madams
(mama-sans) would bus girls in from the surrounding country side to
reinforce their normal selection of (*ahem*) ENTERTAINERS in Alongapo and
Subic City when an Aircraft Carrier was in town.   Also, the rate of
infection from STD\'s would increase dramaticly during that time.

And when shipping slows down for whatever reason the surrounding towns start
to dry up REAL fast.

The compensation I was refering to is that, after you jump, you
may find your destination world travelling at an inconvienient
speed with respect to what was your velocity before and after
a jump.  (as you talk about below).

I really doen\'t matter.  What is of practical imporatance is
your relative velocity with respect to object you need to
interact with.  This will be the same regardless of reference
frame.

I would say the ships simply retain their momentum (the crew does,
you can still shoot people).  What are the properties of this momentum
in jump space?  Who can say.  Maybe in jump space all you _can_ play
tricks with reference frames and you always pick one where you momentum
vector is zero.  Maybe momentum transforms to new coordinate (maybe that
is a source of the time variation when you jump).

I\'m not sure it can be said how the law applies if multiple universes.
The matter isn\'t destroyed, it\'s just someplace else for a while.
This is the point of jump drive after all, it assume that relativity
has the clause "in our universe" attached to it (just as Newtonian
mechanics was found to have the clause "only at speeds not approaching
the speed of light).

In Canada, doing this for yourself is legal (even the backups, as long as you
only use one at once).  

Giving it to someone else is not, any more than you can \'give\' me a copy of a
new computer game that you\'ve bought.  Well, you could give the changes to
someone else, but not the original rules (no matter what format).  As for
deciding which version of a rule to use (CT or MT), you couldn\'t quote more
than the "fair use" amount without permission.  

Try asking GDW.  If the material is out-of-print, they _may_ give you
permission to distribute something free of charge.  For example, I have
permission to distribute large-format deckplans (for use with miniatures).  I
must include the GDW copyright notice and can only charge enough to cover
photocopying and postage.  Notice that this doesn\'t compete with any GDW
product, because I am only distributing the deckplans not the descriptions
and ship statistics.

1) If we are talking about "supertankers" they may not necessarily have 1-G 
maneuverabilty (of course if they land on planets they *must*). Super-tanker 
toddles at .001G to the jump-point. Pop! It appears at its destination. It now 
has to toddle in to port. If you have to maneuver this behemoth into port while 
PCs in 200t zip about at an amazing 1-G you might well want a special pilot. 
Some ports may require that you have a lisenced pilot for their port. There is 
the possibility that if there *is* an accident and your ship is being flown by 
a pilot you might be able to shift the brunt of the leagal problems onto them. 
Imagine if Exxon could have blamed a hired pilot on their little problems...

2) Back in the 16th Century there was a well known Irish pilot by the name of
Granuail (Grace O\'Malley). She would sail out in her galley and meet merchant
ships passing through Clew Bay in Northwest Ireland and offer to pilot them 
through for a fee. She would explain that although the bay appeared calm and 
placid that they were, in fact, dangerous waters and many another merchant
ship 
passing through without a O\'Malley pilot met bad ends.
This might be appropriate for ports in difficult belts, or in systems with a 
large corsair presence, or just place with low law levels.

So there you go.

There is a measure a velocity relative to the distant masses of the universe 
(distant galaxies etc) which is relatively invariant with position [certainly
over the distances we are talking about: 1-6 parsecs vs 1-6 mega-parsecs+)]  
When you compensate for the relative movement of star systems, measurements of 
the remaining velocity are essentially consistent.  ***Provided none of you are 
moving at relativistic velocities -- in which case you have to apply some math 
to your velocity (and time ans space) measurements, but physics still explains 
your differing measurements as consistent within Relativity.**

This is the nearest thing to an "absolute" frame of reference, and is the one
astronomers attempt to use when measuring factors like the microwave background 
temperature from the big bang... 
you can still reasonably assert that if you measure your velocity before and 
after Jump, relative to distant galaxies, that you\'ll get the same numbers - and 
that the local star system you jump from will have quite a high velocity 
relative to the target star; hence, although you had a low intrinsic velocity

when you started, you\'re positively zipping when you come out of jump!  Full 
thrust to slow down into the local system....

[for a good description of problems like this, read the EE Doc Smith "Lensman" 
books, or (probably) GURPS Lensman.  The cause is different (inertialess travel 
retaining previous inertia when you drop the inertialess-ness drive) but the 
effect is similar.


The velocity differences can range from negligible to quite high: try a 
micro-jump across the solar system!

>For what it\'s worth, the 
> orbital velocity of Terra relative to Sol is 29.72 km/s.

So if you were in solar orbit beforehand, but diametrically opposite Terra, and 
jump to near Terra, you have a velocity relative to Sol which is the same as 
before, but Terra is moving in the opposite direction at a further 29.72 km/s: 
59.44 km/s relative to you... Oops!

existing C20 theories of wormholes permit you to "step outside" spacetime, 
without breaking the conservation rules:  you haven\'t destroyed anything, you

took it with you!  The Trav jump scheme is really like a week-long wormhole, 
created to order, arrvining hopefully where you wanted but not properly under

control, so similar considerations probably hold.

This is kind of a chicken and egg problem (sort of) - which was first,
the city or the port? In the case of Vancouver, if all shipping stopped
tomorrow, things wouldn\'t be pretty, but the city wouldn\'t disappear.
The port area would, sure, but a lot of Vancouverites wouldn\'t notice for 
a while. While startown\'s fortunes would be directly related to
the volume of traffic, there\'s probably still a real city not too far away
which would keep startown from disappearing completely.

Oh, and Peter\'s comments about container shipping is a good one, but
their usefulness in orbital unloading depends if ships are allowed
to land anywhere, or just at the starport. If small shuttles could take 
the cargo right to the receipents, fine, but if the shuttles just go to 
the starport to drop it off, no big win. Well, except for unstreamlined
cargo ships. I think a whole sourcebook could be written on starports.
Hm. Maybe I should go buy a copy of TNE and write a challenge article...

Now, one other idea is: what about secondary planets in the system?
What if, for instance, the primary spaceport in the Sol system was Luna,
or Mars, instead of good ol\' Terra? There\'d be big, BIG bulk freighters
making the run between the port and the main world, but the main world would
be spared the effects of having anything really nasty unloaded right on their
doorstep.

But enough.

with a properly calculated jump route, such a ship doesn\'t need maneuver

this is dependent on
1) being able to place the ship in the destination system with a 
reasonable degree of accuracy
2) maintaining its original vector so that it coasts to where the tugs 
are waiting.
3) tugs, shuttles, and fuel tankers waiting in every system on the ships 
route.

In operation these supertankers-in-space would jump into a system near a 
starport, coast on residual velocity, and rendevous with freight handlers 
and fuel tankers before jumping to another system. Each jump would have 
to be calculated to make the most efficient use of the ships vector with 
respect to your frame of reference, and with respect to the vectors of 
the planets being visited.

In my opinion, such ships would exist in the Imperium, making slow 
leisurely trips. However, they would only appear in areas with large 
amounts of bulk cargo to be moved and a sufficient starport network to 
supply the huge ships.

Oh and I don\'t disagree with that analysis either.   I do take New Bedford,
MA as a for instance.  During the whaling days this was a real happening
place. Now there isn\'t much happening there...  Other towns can be used as
examples here.

Actually, what I envision here is somewhat similar to Intermodal Shipping as
it is done today.  Railroads move LOTS of trailers and containers between
intermodal yards.  The trailers and containers are then offloaded (swapped
actually) and tractors pull them to the end customer(s). 

I could envision intermodal terminals in orbit offloading containers and
both company and private handlers using non-starships ferrying one or more
of the containers to the end customer.  

Your right in that there may be planets that forbid ships of any description
just landing anywhere.  However, there is present day precident for that as
well. Aircraft are not allowed by the FAA to just land anywhere (except in
emergencies).  However, some private parties have heliports that range from
a circle on the front lawn to prepared sites, to landing pads on the roof. 

Container ships these days ply the oceans and the containers are
(interestingly enough) the same that is used by the intermodal trucking
system.  It is very conceivable (and I don\'t doubt for a minute it happens)
that a single container could be pulled by all three modes of
transportation...

 Possibly.  But, I figure that there will be multiple downports in
 an area to handle overflow, with Starport Authority-provided
 transport and communication between them.  So that if your agent 
 is based at Kennedy Down, and they route you into Newark Down to
 relieve a traffic buildup at Kennedy, you\'ll be able to let your
 agent know, and he\'ll switch the necessary personnel and material 
 over to Newark.

 Check the economics.  You\'ll probably find that most worlds will 
 be minimally self-sufficient under normal circumstances, which 
 means that most trade will be technically in the "luxury" class.  
 Is it cheaper to build a high-efficiency waste reclamation 
 facility on a desert planet, and import Lake Erie once every few 
 years, or to import Upper New York Bay at frequent intervals?

 Well, probably not.  I\'d envision something more like a current

 "taxiways", and so on.  All marked in variously appropriate ways.

 Presupposes that your cargo ships are at least streamlined.  Which 
 adds to the cost of the ship.  Cargo shuttles from an orbital port 
 are the only solution for unstreamlined ships.  There will be a
 mix, with the downport handling ships up to the size where
 streamlining isn\'t economically ruinous, and an orbital port for 
 the really large ones - not to mention that even streamlined ships 
 above a certain size might not be able to manage their own weight
 without deforming if set down.  As I recall, a large ocean-going 
 vessel is built "dry" until it\'s at the point where it\'s large 
 enough to keep the work area safely above the water line.  Then 
 the hull is floated, and the work continues.  Otherwise, it 
 couldn\'t support its own weight without deforming.  That\'s not to 
 say that it\'s taken out of the drydock - only that enough water is
 let in to support the vessel\'s weight.  I\'d expect a streamlined 
 starship to be built to the point where the cost of shipping the
 unassembled materials breaks even with the cost of lofting the
 partial hull, and then lofting the hull and finishing the job in 
 orbit.  With the largest ships, and with unstreamlined ships, it\'s 
 likely that the entire job will be done in space.  So, while your 
 downport may be larger, I\'d expect a significant skyside as well.
 Probably (in traffic terms) about a Buffalo to the downport\'s 
 La Guardia.

 Yup.  Except for the local pilot, as above.  Multiworld corps that

 probably a contract with an "authorized" HA on the others.

 Well, as I understand it, most interstellar cargo would be 
 containerized in standard sizes, even "bulk" like grain or "fluid" 
 like oil.  That would allow for automated handling to a very great 
 degree, and probably wouldn\'t require an AI intelligent enough to

ANother might be commercially locked ports - not every ship is free to come 
& go at every port in the world...for example CAST owns the port of 
Zeebrugge, Belgium.  Think about the complications this could cause 
characters when they land their valuable cargo onto a class B starport and 
it turns out that they don\'t belong to the right company?

If they also took advantage of the rules on drop-tanks and jump-capacitors, they 
could skip most of the internal displacement needed for fuel, becoming wholly
dependent on external support, but able to transport bulk cargos up to a 
substantial proportion of the hull displacement.

Of course, they have to make sure they never mis-jump...

There was an article written on planetfalls and starports.  It was by one of 
the Keith\'s and appeared in _Far & Away_ #1.  The two articles ran about 20 
pages all told, with lots of charts and tables.  Very interesting.

Some of the commerce ideas I have seen over the last week have been very 
interesting as well.  Especially the dirve-less cargo ships.  One could take 
it a step further and use an unmanned pod constsiting of a lanthanum grid, 
jump drive, capacitors and cargo space.  You could charge it up at a deep 
space station on shoot it out to the jump point either by tug or mass 
driver.  In addition to savings on life support, bridge, etc; it makes a 
misjump less of a loss.  Heck, with a little luck, the pod could be 
recovered in a few decades.

Probably doesn\'t make sense in general, as towing one tug with you is less 
expensive than maintaining several of them in multiple systems, but in 
highly urbanized high traffic areas, it could be a commercial advantage.

This is currently a significant fear in the shipping world - due to 
intermodal usage, international freight is becoming more & more centralized 
and squeezing out the mid to small ports entirely.  {SCENARIO HOOK} The 
competition for usage (between ports) -because of the tremendous effects on 
the local economy - might prove lethal...

For ships like this, I like his idea...They coast on residual velocity, and
keep it from one system to the next - why would they ever need to stop?
(Coasting is the same as stopped to starships...)

Conceivable?  hehehehe.  Sorry (no snideness intended), its my business, 
and for me the above is tantamount to saying "A spacebar an interesting 
device, and I suspect it\'s used very frequently."  Every day, a thousand 
times a day.  This is the norm for ANY freight that\'s more than 300-400 
miles from a pier.  The commonality isn\'t coincidental - it\'s the result of 
a worldwide standards agreement in 1964 (i think).  International standards 
are simple - 20 and 40 foot containers, with some oddball equipment (tall 
ctrs, 45\' containers, reefers).  US has additional \'standards\' accepting 
48\' and 54\' trailers and containers.  I suspect the Imperium would be sort 
of the same, with the Imperial standards, Aslan Standards, Solomani 
standards, with some common points between them.
I think the commerce system in an interstellar-aware system would be 
similar, just on a larger scale.  You would have the \'satellite economies\' 
of colonies etc on outsystem sites, which would feed raw materials and some 
mfg goods into the primary economy of the system, which would feed into a 
transit hub - a central site a good deal out from the system which would be 
the nexus of transit to/from the system.  Just as modern ports are strictly 
quarantined from their surroundings for various reasons, why would a future 
society be any different?  They would want to keep outside traffic very 
much at arms\' length until cleared for system entry/transit.  Placing the 
main upstation in orbit of the mainworld (as is 99%of the traveller 
universe) really doesn\'t make sense...talk about an invitation to 
smuggling, illegal entry, bilogical contamination, terrorism, etc etc.

I respectfully beg to differ - the whole trend in technological advancement 
has been for greater transport capacity to allow greater population 
concentrations for greater efficiencies in other respects.  I doubt very 
much that population A worlds are self sufficient, ever.  If their 
interstellar support lines are cut, it would be DEVASTATING.  Imagine that 
the US suddenly was cut off.  We would suffer the aftershocks for decades.  
And the US is inarguably in the top five countries in the world when it 
comes to self-sufficiency in the important areas, i.e. food, energy, and 
raw materials.

Petrochemicals and grains and lumber (raw or processed) already are subject 
to a great level of mechanization.  Containerization just clutters the 
efficiencies - which is more economical, to stuff grain into bags, onto 
pallets, into containers, and onto the carefully arranged racks on a ship, 
or to hose the grain like water into the empty hull bottom, and suck it out 
like a vacuum cleaner at the destination?

"Classic" Traveller, too.  They seem to get mentioned a lot in the
same breath as the Subsidized Merchant, which in the old rules could
carry fifty.  They\'re 54 kL in displacement.  That was six meters
long, making them about the size of a modern twenty-foot trailer for
a trailer truck.  I imagine you could find the same container being
transported by ground truck, wet freighter, rail, spacecraft, 
starship, and gravitic lighter to get from source to destination.
We\'ve never seen \'em, but a "forty-foot" (twelve meter) container
of 108 cubic meter displacement would make sense too.

    The question came up some time ago as to "Is having the same price
for passenger/cargo for any jump realy realistic?" I had researched this
some time ago and deduced different costs depending on the jump.
Unfortunately I lost the recorded results of that research. Being (once
again) on business I brought my rules book with me and set about to
recreate that work.
 So I currently have a 1-2-3 spread-sheet tailroed to cargo ship
production. If you feed it the number of cabins/berths/cargo, the jump
and tech level, it calcuates the ship needed for that, that ships
expenses and eventually reports the *actual* cost for what you have
asked.
 I then wrote a automation script to plug values in for 100, 1000,
and 10000 cabins, berths, and cargo (tons) for tech levels 12 to 15 and
jumps 1 to 6. I have the results consolidated in a Improv worksheet and
have appended a textual representation of them to this mail. If anyone
wants the originals, let me know. I can e-mail them or whatever.


 I started doing some analysis but I got busy. So here is just
the tables. They will probably wrap on most screens so you probably
should print them out. All do commentry in followup articles...

Here is an abbreviated table showing the cost in credits per

Yes! That *includes* cost of ship, life support, crew salaries,
and jump fuel. And this is for a streamlined 1-G maneuver drive
ship.
 So, contrary to my intuition, this would pretty much make
bulk carriers something that definately exists in a standard
traveller universe.
 Perviously I would have argued that most worlds would be
independantly supportable because of the cost of trade. However
if it gets this cheap then it makes sense to follow the modern
model of very interdependant nations.
 Anyone have any idea of how much volume is in a modern
super/tanker? How many containers on a modern container ship?
 This data supports the view that the bulk of shipping
is done by large shipping combines and that PC shipping only
realy comes into play picking up the tail ends and special
cases.
 Of course, you *must* have full holds to realise the
actual cost. However at that low a cost even low profit cargos
(like grain) still are worth shipping.

So when I draw warship deckplans, I subtract the fuel tonnage and

how much fuel to assign to each deck to keep an approximately

Large Starports would almost certainly have local pilots.  Note that 
the fact that starships have a large maneurerability does not 
necessarily mean they can get into a narrow dock more easily - it does 
mean they can go from a safe vector to a collision vector more quickly 
(and hit harder when they do).
Even indicating where a ship should go is a far bigger job than in the 
2D floating port.
Local pilots never need to physically board ships however, remote 
control of ships systems by either a living being or an AI/Computer 
would seem more likely.  (They\'ll have to change that in TNE though, 
won\'t they. ;>)

Back to Ethan\'s comments:

Except of course for the fact that large freighters may not have

The Big ships you mention later will be mostly operated by Mega Corps.  
They will have personell in all ports of consequence to handle all 
these matters.  Including the booking of unloading equipment and 
manpower.  (Does make it more difficult for the Free traders out there)

Bummer for the big ships all right.  Plenty of scope for palm greasing 
and other nefarious activities there (depending on the law level of 
course).  Small traders have the advantage in this situation - being 
able to put down almost anywhere.
There\'s no reason that Agents etc. couldn\'t be organised on an 
electronic bulletin board system.  Captains should never need to leave 
the ship for communications like this.


Starports are an inherent part of a CT/MT style game.  Plenty of scenes 
can and will take place in them.  They are often the first part (and 
frequently the only part) of a planet to be seen by the PCs.  Anything 
that makes them seem more real is a good thing.

I think the deckplans by DGP in the MT Alien Modules both surround the 
inhabited area with fuel, and the Sydkai cruiser outlined in MTJ3 is also 
described as having such a design feature.  The only probelm I can see is 
that if you decks are wrapped in a fuel tank, then there are far more 
points of contact between the hydrgogen tanks and the sealed environment 
everyone lives in.  This must increase the chance of fuel leakage into 
the interior.

An awful lot of designs I\'ve seen have the fuel lumped as a bland box
somewhere, usually as an afterthought. Since fuel is a major component of
jump-capable ships (and in the old CT rules you needed x % (was it 10?)
allocated to bridge and control systems, etc. as well) I tend to allocate it
fairly early and, like yourself, it tends to surround most areas of the
ship. I do not use this as a deliberate protective measure, it merely
reflects the way cabling, hydraulics, landing gear, sensor antennae, hull
grid, fuel and all the other components would be likely to be spread out
over a ship\'s hull. Of this general \'waste space\', the fuel areas do tend to
be concentrated toward the rear (i.e. where the drives are). But then I map
fairly accurately using a strict 2 1.5m squares per displacement ton of each
component, so everything from drives to computers to staterooms to fuel is
accurate.

I checked the encyclopedia.  I don\'t know about *volume*, but a
modern supertanker can carry five hundred thousand tons of oil,
and ships with million metric ton oil tanks are apparently in
the works.   

A figure of 1000 containers of freight was given for an "average"
container ship, but I don\'t know if this is for the common 20\'
containers, or the 40\' containers, which according to the article
are a newer design.  If they\'re standard Traveller "20\'" containers,
you could probably carry 1000 on a 8000 disp-ton jump-1 ship, or
on a 10000 disp-ton jump-4 ship.  For MT, the jump-3 and 20,000
disp-ton "Common Imperial Transport" could carry about 2500 of the
six-meter containers, or 1250 twelve-meter containers, so these
size guesses could go down a bit.  (Why is jump-4 important?  The
x-boat trade and communications lines, that\'s why, although you
could probably get by with jump-3 in many places.) 

Some more possible container sizes I\'ve calculated:
  All are three meters wide by three meters high. 
  Tonnage is calculated at MT\'s 13.5 kL/disp-ton.  Reduce the
    rated tonnage by 3.7% to get TNE\'s 14 kL/disp-ton, which
    might be more accurate -- I\'d have to check on the mass 
    per volume of liquid hydrogen.

Ten-ton.    15 meters; "49 feet"          135 kL; 10 d-tons

A 150 kL container of 11 and 1/9 d-tons and 16 and 2/3 meters
(about 55 feet) would also be possible, but fitting it or the
ten-ton containers would probably be a pain.  The ten-tonners 
would probably be easier to deal with, since they\'re a simple
multiple of the standard container size.

You could build specialized containers, too.  Built-in fusion
reactors powering a refrigeration system, or internal gravitic
compensators, perhaps.  Or use a modified triple-sized container 
to carry some *very* alien passengers, like Jgdi.

Traveller has tiny "Ro/Ro" ships too -- the Subsidized Merchant
can "kneel" and let ground vehicles drive right into the six
meter high cargo bay.  This probably isn\'t a real big deal on
advanced worlds with gravitic transporters, but it might be a
useful capability on the low-tech circuit.

Remember, the entire ship is sitting in vacuum.

If we assume there\'s not much difference between the fatality of exposure
to vacuum versus exposure to liquid hydrogen (death in minutes vs. death
in seconds), the question them becomes:  Which is easier to detect -- a
hydrogen leak or a leak to vacuum.

There are other concerns, but I don\'t think it\'s clear-cut that fuel
leaking into the interior is any worse than the alternatives.

Hi All,

Is anyone out there interested in discussing alternate 
player character definition?

I\'ve always felt that most RPGs tend to produce rather
2-D characters. It remains the responsibility of the
player to add variation beyond the six digits of attributes.
I\'m not saying that players shouldn\'t have to do this.
I am just looking for house rules which other gamers have 
developed to add diversity to their characters. Topics like
alternate attributes, different skill definitions, and 
additional personality rules spring to mind.

Hi All,

I just picked up a copy of Full Thrust, a spaceship combat system
by Jon Tuffley for Ground Zero Games. Their rules seem simple but 
I haven\'t had a chance to try them yet. Has anyone else experimented
using this rules system with traveller?

What really interested me were the miniatures listed in the back 
from Capricorn Space of Portland, Oregon. Have any TML members had 
any experience with these miniatures? Has anybody seen these in 
stores. The photo only gives an outline of the shape of the 
miniatures. Some of them look liked they would make excellent 
shuttles, fighters, traders and couriers. Some of the larger 
warships looked ridiculous, IMHO.

But air is easier to contain than hydrogen, and it doesn\'t go bang if it 
leaks into the surrounding vacuum, and streamlined vessels spend much of 
their time in atmospheres.  Still, given the high durability of Traveller 
spaceships, I think my point is only of minor concern.  I\'ve just 
remembered another published deckplan which wraps the decks in fuel:  The 
good old Scout/Courier!

Actually, for Americans, the game\'s name is a misspelling -- we are supposed
to use "traveler".  First known Traveller typo?  :)  (I bet it has more to
do with assorted trademarking rules, but that\'s a wild guess.)  I understand
that "traveller" is the *correct* spelling for the Brits among us.

I think there\'s a scene from some Eddie Murphy movie where he and some other
people are being chased by thugs, and he says something like, "Who do you 
think sent these guys, Traveler\'s Aid?"

   okay.  I\'ll bite.  How do they change the communications assumptions?
Jump torpedos are only as fast as ships, too.  Sure, they make the
X-boat system look like a pretty stupid idea (can you spell "pork"?  Sure
you can...), but they don\'t speed up communications in any way at all...

Well, for one thing, they mean that you don\'t have to wait for the
next ship to go to get your message out.  Also, they will be cheap
enough that jump 6 will be common.

You are on a backwater world with a Jump 2 scout and get into trouble...
-under the old rules.  The world has to wait for the next ship (going in
the right direction) to send a message (while you can leave right away).
When it gets to the next world (if it\'s similarly backwater), it again
waits for the next ship.

-With jump torpedoes it leaves right away and can make it\'s way accross
the imperium faster than you can.

I\'m quite a fan of Full Thrust, as it gives a fast-moving and 
exciting game. There was a short article about integrating it with 
Traveller by Mike Elliot in an issue of Ragnarok (Journal of the 
Society of Fantasy & Sci-Fi Wargamers) last summer (and he was 
talking classic Trav, X-boat subscribers should note approvingly).

One trouble though is that a  small ship in Full Thrust can get 
blown up with frightening rapidity, and if the PCs happen to be on 
board then they might be a little upset at this.

The weapons rules would need to be tinkered with, as capital ships 
in Full Thrust have many batteries of relatively small-sized 
weapons, a la Star Wars Imperial star destroyers, rather than 
being built around huge spinal mounts.

Yep. A J-6 ship has to have a whopping 60% set aside for jump fuel, assuming
it isn\'t using drop tanks. This brings up something I\'ve never seen mention-
ed here & that is that some of the BB designs in the old CT Supplement 9 -
Fighting Ships, don\'t have enough internal tankage to be able to power a
J-4 jump. Some examples are the Kokirrak (p42) & the Tigress (p38). On
the other hand the Plankwell *does* have enough internal tankage for J4
but it\'s wimpy factor-3 meson screen, compared to 8 & 7 for the
others, makes it *alot* more vulnerable to meson fire. (Which also makes
me wonder why *any* imperial BB has less than a factor-9 screen esp. a
ship as individually important as the 500,000t Tigresses.) As it turns out,
from what I remember, if you only allocate enough fuel for J3 (30%) than
you have ample room on the big BB\'s to load it up with *everything*. If
you want J4 internal tanks (40%) then you have to sacrifice something,
even with a million ton design. (btw, the CT stats for the J5 Azhanti\'s
sets aside 33,000t, out of 60,000t total, for fuel. This provides for
a single J5 plus 3,000 energy points to power all the other ships functions,
including the 2G maneuver drive with zero agility. Any way you look at it
a ship like this is basically an armored fuel tank. Although the tanks would
rarely be completely full, a fuel hit, esp. from meson fire would
be pretty common. No wonder battle riders became such a big hit.

allocated to bridge and control systems, etc. as well) I tend to allocate it
fairly early and, like yourself, it tends to surround most areas of the
ship. I do not use this as a deliberate protective measure, it merely
reflects the way cabling, hydraulics, landing gear, sensor antennae, hull
grid, fuel and all the other components would be likely to be spread out
over a ship\'s hull. Of this general \'waste space\', the fuel areas do tend to
be concentrated toward the rear (i.e. where the drives are). But then I map
fairly accurately using a strict 2 1.5m squares per displacement ton of each
component, so everything from drives to computers to staterooms to fuel is
accurate.

The Midu Agashaam class destroyer is a streamlined escort
vessel designed to  supplement fleet defences with
anti-fighter and anti-small craft ships. As  yet, the class
has acheived only limited production and is still
considered to  be experimental or developmental in status.
The Admiralty, in it evaluation  efforts, has thus far
deployed the ships in oversized squadrons of ten to  twenty
vessels, and has comitted them to actions only with the
Navy\'s major  battle fleets.

    It\'s not one of my old favorites...
    Seriously, I\'d prefer seeing NEW designs, not rehashes
of the same old designs.  Upgrading Book 9 designs to
MT doesn\'t count.  Any more than the TL10/11/12/13/14/15
versions of the Type-S Scout/Type A Free Trader/Type A2
Far Trader/etc, etc, etc...
    Note, btw, that the Midu Agashaam was done for MT in
the "Arrival Vengeance" module...

   Also, you might consider, in future warship designs, putting
redundant sensors and communicators in.  Say a few dozen
of each for a medium sized ship, up to a few hundred of each
for a LARGE ship...

    How about ORIGINAL designs?  Something NOT based on
GDW\'s ideas about the "right" way of doing things....

- the two Solomani commando regiments, the 1st and 2nd "Al" (or
  perhaps "AI"). 
- the other elite Solomani regiments, all parts of "SG" (I figured
  this stands for either "Secretarial Guards" or "Secretary-General")

I thought it was cute, though, that the two Solomani jump infantry
divisions were the 82nd and 101st. Plus I am still curious about the
"Ihatei" TL12 Solomani infantry corps - how did these landless ones

If I may be so bold, I like the seeing old designs in TNE format.  As 
inefficient as some of those old warhorses were, the Kinunir for example, 
they are the craft that tie TNE to CT.  People argue about what 
constitutes American heritage (sorry if that\'s irrelevant to 
non-Americans) but those ships, to me, are truly from a classic era...

In any case, I\'d be happy to receive CT ships in TNE format as well as 
new designs, privately if not here.  I am:  youngm@axe.humboldt.edu
  
I like \'em all and I save \'em all.

I\'m drawing a blank about the Ihatei but maybe the SG stands for 
"Solomani Guards" or as you suggest, "Secretarial Guards."   After all, 
those Terrans draw heavily from WWII as the airborne divisions and the 
practice of using wound badges (as per the old alien module\'s extended 
character generation.)  Hmmm...German medal names, Russian and American 
division names...what else?

Sorry, Steve.  But I\'m going to have to disagree  with  you  here.  My
current campaign uses the MT rules in the CT \'era\' and  thus  the  old
ships  feature  quite  heavily.  I  have  already  converted  all  the
Supplement 9 ships (and a few others besides), but ...

        a)  It was a rush job so I don\'t think many are not that good, and
        b)  There are  still  plenty  of  other  CT  ships  that  need
            converting.

If people disagree with this perhaps  we  need  a  CT-to-MT  \'upgarde\'
repository and/or this should continue privately.

Also, can anyone tell me what repositories exist?  I tried one  called
\'ghost\' but could get no response (and now I\'ve lost the address).

    Did it ever occur to you that there might be more different types
of ships in the 11000 worlds of the Imperium than the four or five
dozen designs from CT?  Never mind...

    Also, almost every CT ship was converted to MT WAAAY back
when MT first came out.  Seeing them done again does nothing
for my database of Trav ships (rather over a hundred designs just
from my last TCS game, much less the hundreds more (thousands?)
from the TML over the years)...

    Anyway, I offered my opinion of what I wanted to see in ship
designs, and if I don\'t get what I want, oh well....

      It just occured to me that most people probably
aren\'t aware of this great resource for vehicles. The
limited printout I have has over 100 pages of MegaTraveller
Vehicle designs ranging from a TL4 horse drawn Curicle
to 900000t Atlantis class Battleship.
      Want to ride the fastest grav-bike in existance?
At 43G it goes 0 to 60 in .12 seconds. Unfortunately its
sensors only give you about 5 seconds to swerve to avoid
that upcoming mountain range.
 There are Diesel Locomotives, Merchant ships, Mobile
Homes, Battle Cruisers, Urban Vehicles, and Interceptors.
Enough to give even jaded palettes like Steve Higginbotham
pause for five minutes or so.
 So, why haven\'t you seen this before? Well those of
us old-timers have. They may have already worked it out.
I am, of course, refering to the designs that R.S.Dean has
put out over the years. I collected them for a while and
put them out in a short and failed publishing attempt in
Dublin. They have, however, contributed greatly to my campaign.
Instead of just a few things in the back of the Imperial
Encyclopedia, my players have loads to choose from.
 Perhaps now that "R.S." has stopped producing (due
to fatal depression inflicted by The New Era) the definitive
collection can be produced? If other people can get the
immense use I have had from these it would be certainly
worth doing...

 Just kicked off my Traveller campaign again. (Player
just came back from the States. First thing he did was ring
and ask when we could play. :-)
 Anyway, they are working up to a long merchant haul
starting from a planet know for its VR facilities (Serabi).
Desiring to work up some skills, they sought to purchase
courses of instruction. They have done this before and each
time I\'ve had to work out again how much to charge them.
This time, however, I\'ve written it down and as it might be
of greater interest, I\'m posting it here.

 The (MegaTraveller) players manual covers Character
Improvement on p41-43. They indicate that a formal training
course lasts 200 hours and costs on average 10Cr per hour
for a total of 2000Cr for a course. My basic assumption is
that through mass-production, etc, this can be cheaper. The
basic cost is 1000Cr for a VR tape (or set of tapes, depending
on TL) of a course to teach you skill level 1.
 For higher skill levels, I said to double the cost
for each level higher. I.e. x2 for skill level 2, x4 for
skill level 3, etc. Obviously higher skill levels will
be increasingly hard to find, etc.
 You still have to roll to stay determined to maintain
concentration during a course. However, you can purchase
tapes by "expert instructors" (the higher-tech ones will
tailor themselves to the pupil) which improve the roll.
The price doubles for each plus. Obviously, again, higher
quality tapes will be increasingly rare, etc.
 Lastly I throw in a market adjustment roll (plus
currency conversion) of 2D+3 x10% for the final price.
In summary:
  1000Cr Base cost of course tape for skill-1
  x2  for each skill level above 1
  x2  for each +1 on determination roll
  x2D+3 x10% market adjustment

 So, for example, one character wanted to learn 
Broker-2. Serabi being known for this sort of thing I
tell them that any skill level up to 2 and +2 determination
is generally availible. The base cost is 1000, double for
skill level 2; 2000Cr. They want +2 on determination so
that goes up to 8000Cr. I roll an 8 for market adjustment
(110%) which makes it 8800Cr. Serabi is starport-A, TL-14
so converting to Imperial Credits puts the final price
at 8360Cr.
 I assume that a character on active duty (e.g. a
Cargo Chief while ship is docked) can only study for
about 4 hours a day. A character not on active duty
(e.g. a pilot while ship is in jump) can study for
8 hours a day. They may choose to study more but they
may get a penalty on their Determination roll.
 This assumes you have the hardware already. Some
course require supplementary hardware. E.g. a pair of
grav-sticks for a skiing course (did I mention these
in an earlier article?). My players had a full RealVision
system already on their ship for passenger entertainment
so I have no rules for working out prices for hardware.
 Anyone willing to have a go?

A starship design program written by me in DOS compiler 
basic, which unfortunately includes copyright data from an 
out-of-print game that can\'t make its\' makers any more 
money, which obviously is killing their business and so I 
can\'t distribute it... <g>

OK, rant mode on.

I\'m normally very even tempered, but the reaction to my 
ship design has disgusted me. I\'m seriously considering 
abandoning any attempt to be constructive and going back to 
posting rants about how crap Virus is.

_Mister_ Kundert, if you\'d _bothered_ to actually read the 
design properly, you would possibly have spotted that it is 
_not_ a TNE design. I don\'t use TNE. The design is (with 
house variants) Megatraveller. A high-handed and 
ill-informed assault of this nature is a splendid way to 
attract more epithets, though such is not my way.

There are already people on the list who don\'t have and 
can\'t get these, as MT is now defunct.  There are also 
probably a fair number of people who are as new to the list 
(ie 1 year or so) as I am, and haven\'t had the benefit of 
these designs. I\'ve seen about 20-25 all the time I\'ve been 
here. 

The major source of such conversions is FSSI. IMHO, the 
designs in there are terrible. If you look closely, some of 
the old CT designs can be seen, reduced from named classes 
with some personality to a stack of numbers. Plus, the 
designs don\'t work - and the armour values! Some (repeat: 
some!) of my designs are (seriously improved and annotated) 
versions of these, which I\'ve found quite useful in my own game. 

OK, so it does nothing for you; a lot of the stuff I\'ve 
seen on here did nothing for me (eg stuff on the TCS 
subsectors, etc), but I passed over it and went on, 
confident that there were folk happy to see it. I rather 
hoped there might be a) a few people out there who might 
like a few ships and b) a bit of tolerance from those who 
didn\'t need them. There was only 25 lines or so for 
Christ\'s sake! 

I started with a chestnut so\'s people could get the hang of 
my design style, fully intending to trot out some unusual 
stuff further on. To be honest I don\'t know if I can be 
bothered after this. Come on you lot, we\'re all gamers 
playing the same game for fun. We\'ve got enough enemies 
without pissing each other off.

Sorry in advance if this has irritated anybody. Such is 
genuinely not my intention.

Everybody can find parts for a two-year-old Ling Standard Products air 
raft (just go to the dealership), but where do you go for a compensating 
magnetostrictor for your classic Funilawari Dyno-speeder, out of 
production for over a century?  Well, you do just what collectors have 
been doing since the Rule of Man - go to a swap meet!

The planet Carlisle is centrally located, and supports a thriving salvage
industry.  It hosts an regular (once every five years) swap meet for
vehicle collectors, and thousands of vendors travel to the planet to set
up temporary booths, where they sell and trade parts and complete
vehicles.  Parts for almost any vehicle are avalible, either used or like
new. 

CLASSIC TRAVELLER

A Noble patron hires the players to provide transportation (if they 
have a starship) or security (if they do not) for his shipment of classic 
air-rafts to Carlisle.

1) All is as it seems - use this as a chance to pull out all those 
vehicle designs that have been hanging around.

2) All is as it seems, but unknown to the patron one of his air-rafts is 
stolen goods - conflict ensues when the original owner sees it at the 
swap meet.

3) The "Noble" is actually a smuggler (of what is up to the referee), and 
the air-rafts have the smuggled item(s) hidden inside them.

4) As 1, but the players discover one of the air-rafts has a sentient 
TL-16 robot brain installed.  The brain pleads with the players to free 
it from servitude, but the air-raft is very rare and expensive, and will 
lose most of its value if the brain is removed.

MEGATRAVELLER

1) The players are from the Wilds, looking for parts to repair an 
essential transport system on a Failing world.  A collector recognises 
the player\'s ship\'s vehicle as a rare model, and offers to buy it.

2) As 5, but the collector tries to steal the vehicle.

NEW ERA

1) Carlisle is now a boneyard.  The players are sent to explore, and find 
a version of Virus that is a collector of old vehicles.  It controls an 
army of vehicles and robots constructed out of scrap parts.  The Virus is 
potentially friendly, and will be happy to trade with the players.  It 
wants rare vehicles and trade literature, and will send the players on 
quests for what it wants (it knows where all the vehicle museums in this 
sector were). 


Note: This seed was inspired by my upcoming visit to an auto swap meet in 
Carlisle, PA.  Hope you like it!

Yes!  If you have access to ftp (or can get it through gopher, the World
Wide Web, or a ftp-mail-server) I think most of the Traveller ftp archives
have a large number of the MegaTraveller designs developed by members of
the TML.  They\'re usually stored in UNIX compress format (.Z) since there\'s
so many, as digested text files.  Format quality varies.  Design quality
also varies, so it can\'t hurt to review a design that you plan to use a
lot.  Some great ideas, though, and everything from buses to starships to
the "meson-gun submarine".

One site that I\'m sure has them is "ftp.engrg.uwo.ca", formerly known as
"sunbane", the central ftp site of the TML before the MPGN days.  It\'s
still running, and the designs are in the directory:
  /pub/traveller/vehicles

"ftp.engrg.uwo.ca" is a standard anonymous ftp site; to be brief, UNIX
Internet folks type "ftp ftp.engrg.uwo.ca" then log into the ftp site
as user anonymous, password guest.  You use "cd" to change directory,
"ls" to list directory, and "get" to get an individual file.  Oh yes,
before you get any compressed files, type "bin" so you\'re in binary
mode.  

Two files are indices for the digests, so that you can find out what 
designs are in which files.

After you get the files you will either have to run the UNIX program
"uncompress" on them (i.e., "uncompress TL07.Z" to uncompress file
TL07.Z) or use a program that can understand the format for a Mac or
PC (or Amiga, or whatever).  You end up with a text file.

For the most part, they\'re unique designs done as text only, so pictures
aren\'t available.  There are some conversions of old designs and some
attempts to recreate actual historical or modern vehicles, and many of 
the invented designs have descriptions written by the designer.

>>  I\'m curious as to what "ships II v 11.5" is...   :) <<

A starship design program written by me in DOS compiler 
basic, which unfortunately includes copyright data from an 
out-of-print game that can\'t make its\' makers any more 
money, which obviously is killing their business and so I 
can\'t distribute it... <g>

OK, rant mode on.

I\'m normally very even tempered, but the reaction to my 
ship design has disgusted me. I\'m seriously considering 
abandoning any attempt to be constructive and going back to 
posting rants about how crap Virus is. 

>>  Due to the origin and nature of this mailing list, TNE 
versions of CT, HG, or  MT ships should probably not be 
posted here. Feel free to put (SHORT) pointers  to their 
appearance on the TML here, though.  The Xboat List was 
formed due  to many folks on the TML considering TNE 
material to be merely "noise". So  much shouting went on 
then that I am still rather short-fused when it comes  to 
epithet-hurling on either list, and I suspect that someone 
would start  it up again if we started "littering" the 
Xboat list with TNE ship designs,  or TNE material of any 
other kind or length.   Please, post in context to this 
list... or take it to the TML.   <<

_Mister_ Kundert, if you\'d _bothered_ to actually read the 
design properly, you would possibly have spotted that it is 
_not_ a TNE design. I don\'t use TNE. The design is (with 
house variants) Megatraveller. A high-handed and 
ill-informed assault of this nature is a splendid way to 
attract more epithets, though such is not my way. 

>>  Also, almost every CT ship was converted to MT WAAAY 
back  when MT first came out.  Seeing them done again does 
nothing  for my database of Trav ships (rather over a 
hundred designs just  from my last TCS game, much less the 
hundreds more (thousands?)  from the TML over the years)... <<

There are already people on the list who don\'t have and 
can\'t get these, as MT is now defunct.  There are also 
probably a fair number of people who are as new to the list 
(ie 1 year or so) as I am, and haven\'t had the benefit of 
these designs. I\'ve seen about 20-25 all the time I\'ve been 
here. 

The major source of such conversions is FSSI. IMHO, the 
designs in there are terrible. If you look closely, some of 
the old CT designs can be seen, reduced from named classes 
with some personality to a stack of numbers. Plus, the 
designs don\'t work - and the armour values! Some (repeat: 
some!) of my designs are (seriously improved and annotated) 
versions of these, which I\'ve found quite useful in my own game. 

OK, so it does nothing for you; a lot of the stuff I\'ve 
seen on here did nothing for me (eg stuff on the TCS 
subsectors, etc), but I passed over it and went on, 
confident that there were folk happy to see it. I rather 
hoped there might be a) a few people out there who might 
like a few ships and b) a bit of tolerance from those who 
didn\'t need them. There was only 25 lines or so for 
Christ\'s sake! 

I started with a chestnut so\'s people could get the hang of 
my design style, fully intending to trot out some unusual 
stuff further on. To be honest I don\'t know if I can be 
bothered after this. Come on you lot, we\'re all gamers 
playing the same game for fun. We\'ve got enough enemies 
without pissing each other off.

Sorry in advance if this has irritated anybody. Such is 
genuinely not my intention.

You\'re right about the sensors; the values I used for this

"old" ships in this field. Others I have designed (ie 
myself) have lotsa. I\'m quite happy with constructive 
criticism like that. Honest. Please don\'t shut up. I was

To Hugh Foster:

Well, I for one would like to see more ship designs, and MT
conversions of old ships are fine by me.  I don\'t own TNE,
and don\'t intend to buy it in the foreseeable future. 
Actually, neither have I played MT for a while, but ship
designs are always interesting in my opinion.

Now, a question which some may find rather tedious (and some
possibly rather obvious), but there are three types of crew
positions in MT which confuse me.  What is the difference
between Command and Bridge crew, and what do Maintenance crew
do?  Any ideas?  I always assume that "Maintenance" includes
people like cooks, but it\'s rather an odd term.

This is by no means canonical - just my interpretation:

Command crew are the seniors officers who make the important decisions:
Captain, First officer - Kirk & Spock, Picard and Riker. Bridge crew would
be the other crewmates whose station is on the bridge - helm, sensor,
commo, and so on.

>always assume that "Maintenance" includes

I would classify them under "Steward".

The best site to send non-TNE stuff is still \'sunbane\', that is 
ftp.engrg.uwo.ca.  This is the old TML site before MPGN took on the role.

Please submit your subsector viewer - anything for the Amiga is greatly

Hear, hear!  Listen, the underlying premise of TNE is a civilization in shambles
that is having to cobble together pieces of old technology (the auction 
at Aubain, etc.).  This argues that ships are a very valuable and scarce resource
(particularly in the wilds) and I think would give support to a general line of thinking
that a planet would not expend the energy/resources to design new ships. Rather,
they would concentrate on keeping those they have in operation.  It does make
sense to convert the old ship designs to TNE format because that is what is
flying around nowadays.  Keep postin\' em.

    'body' => '
With the late 20th century increase in tourism to the Holy Land, esp. 
Jerusalem, there has been a marked increase in a form of mental illness 
called the "Jerusalem Complex."  Perfectly normal folks, average 
tourists, become convinced that they are a biblical figure (Christ, the 
Virgin Mary, etc.) as a result of the time they spend at holy sites.  
There is a mental hospital now outside the city that specialises in the 
treatment of the syndrome.

Here are some things to keep in mind about this syndrome.  First, those
who are victums normally are not those who are well-integrated in their
faith, but are folks who have doubts or who have sinned in the past and
seek redemption.  Second, they will be fully convinced that they are the
holy person, and will be very uncomfortable with any questions that refer 
to their real past.  Note, however, that this does not mean they will 
immediatly act like the historical figure they believe they are - a 
person convinced they are Christ might be very hesitant to speak out for 
fear of crucifiction, for example.  Finally, most individuals recover 
faster if they are removed from Jerusalem - the city itself seems to have 
an influence.

CLASSIC TRAVELLER

1) The players are hired to find a young man gone missing from his 
wealthy family.  He is on the planet where his religion originated,

MEGATRAVELLER

failings in his/her past.

>Adventure Seed 6: The Jerusalem Complex
I\'d just like to say thanks for these 76 patrons-style advenure seeds, I think that 
they\'re a great resource for lost and lonely (should that be looney?)  GMs.

As the list seems fairly quiet at the moment I\'ll try to stir some comment by 
asking others what they think of something that occured to me last night.

What would the Vargr think of humans keeping dogs as pets?

i mean it\'s probable that "man\'s best friend" will have followed him into space 
(after all he got there first here on Terra).  Perhaps dogs wouldn\'t be as 
common in the Villani-based Imperium but its possible that they exist as a 
hang-over from the Rule of Man isn\'t it?  At least in the GDW material I\'m aware 
of there seems to be an emphisis on cute mascot-type creatures carried abord 
starships, why not include dogs?

I know that Vargr are far removed from our household pets but imagine the sort 
of relations that any human goverment would have with a newly encountered 
alien race that kept chimpanzees for pets (making them do tricks etc)?  i\'m sur 
it would excite even stronger emotions in Vargr, as they\'re supposed to be  
impulsive, prone to racial pride and sensitive about their beginnings.

All of the above is just nonsense really but the possibilities are amusing...
"Quick hide bozo, Admiral Grvrrrghhh is about to inspect our ship!"

Let us not forget the large contribution by 2-G Scott Kellogg, and other 
designs by Bertil Jonell (including a Chrysanthemum conversion, if memory
serves--I certainly have a copy of his floor plans for same), and Marc
Volovic, plus a few miscellaneous members.

I suppose a definitive compilation of these could be provided at this point,
since it\'s been quite a while since I added anything new.  I\'m afraid that
having not played lately tends to reduce my overall interest level.  Notice
that it took me the better part of a week to get around to responding to this.

    Rob, you are the main reason I don\'t really want to see any more
conversions
of existing designs.  Thanks to you and Scott, I have every CT design done 
over into MT many times over.  So now it\'s time to go beyond that, and design
things that have never been seen before.  Even more of those gawdawful 
battleships like your Atlantis ( just joking, Rob ;-) ) would be a pleasant
change
from more Free Traders, Far Traders, Fat Traders, Patrol Cruisers, etc, etc,
etc...

>What would the Vargr think of humans keeping dogs as pets?

Well, as always with the Vargr, that would depend on the
individual Vargr. I think. Some may be offended, and some
probably doesn\'t care. It\'s not even certain that a Vargr
will recognize a dog as a "predecessor" (a german
shephard probably, but what about chinese dogs?).

As mentioned in the interview with Jeramii Boden in MTJ #3,
Boden formerly had a "Terran dog". Now he owns a "gena"
- a genetically altered animal - in this case a dog. As he
mentions, this sometimes brings him into trouble with the
Vargr.

I once ran a campaign where one of the PCs were a Vargr.
They were merchants and were transporting passengers, and
one passenger was a little girl with a toy dog. She looked
at the Vargr with big surprised eyes and I had some fun
with the Vargr PC, but she (the Vargr) didn\'t do anything.

What I can glean from the interview with Boden, dogs are
uncommon in the Domain of Deneb, but not more so that
the general public is aware of their existence and how they
look.

>All of the above is just nonsense really but the possibilities
>are amusing...

Yes, excactly. And that\'s what we are here for, after all.

I think that you should determine a Vargrs reaction to a pet
dog based on how you think that individual Vargr would
react (was this a tautology? :-)). In this way, you will also
get individual aliens, and not only stereotypes.

>Please don\'t take this too seriously,

I won\'t. After all, this is only a game.

Hello, all. I\'m a new reader of the list.
Regarding Vargr attitude towards dogs, I think the comments about reactions  
varying from one Vargr to the next are right on target. Maybe the best use of

this idea would be to cause a ruckus during a single encounter, then
illustrate  
Vargr individuality by not allowing other Vargr to ignore it.

Perhaps a splinter group of Vargr would make a religion out of worshipping  
their "ancestors" ?

Thanks, Robert, for a fun idea; this kind of thing adds depth to a campaign.

No need to joke about it.  The Atlantis is a terrible design from a fighting
perspective--I designed it in High Guard shortly after 2nd edition High Guard
came out, and I hadn\'t run enough High Guard combat at the time to know a
good design from a bad design.  Translating it into MT didn\'t make it any
better. (-:  Years later, I ran a little solo campaign using all the High
Guard stuff I had designed, and discovered that the early ships were all 
crappy.  Look on the bright side--the worst classes were totally destroyed
in the war, so I didn\'t convert them into MT. (-:

I suppose I could get the pencils and paper and calculators out and see
if I can still understand all my cryptic notes to myself regarding the
design process.  What might you like to see (if I were to finish it)?

Also, if anyone wants them, I think I have a few never-posted-on-TML 
designs kicking around.  Could someone do a quick check of the archives 
to tell me what the last dozen or so I posted were?

The (formerly TML) Traveller PBEM is still going strong (now in it\'s 7th
year) and has 23 participants (counting the 2 referees), most of whom have
been with the game since it\'s start.  Things are currently in semi-haitus,
as one of the Refs. (Mike Metlay) is about to become a first-time poppa
and hasn\'t been able to apply much energy to the game.

We are currently planning to add a few new players (which may not actually
happen until Fall or later, due to the current game slow-down).  If you\'re
interested in joining the game, you might want to consider the announcement
that was sent out to our game listeners (appended below).  It also would
be a good idea for you read the game archives (available by anonymous ftp
from ftp.engrg.uwo.ca; look in pub/traveller/pbem) to find out what\'s
been happening up until now.  (Warning: those archived turns are *large*;
the equivalent of several full-length novels).

After having read the archived turns and the announcement (below), if
you\'re still interested in joining the game, follow the instructions
in the announcement and we\'ll get back to you ASAP.

                 T M L   P B E M   L I S T E N E R S !

There is the possibility that we will be allowing the addition of a very
few new players/PCs in the 1995 TML PBEM.  It looks like we may have one
or two current players dropping out and we (the Refs.) plan to unload
a number of NPCs (how many and who TBD) in the very near future.  These
two events will combine to leave noticable gaps in the Elissa crew
complement and, further, will reduce the administrative overhead such
that we can now manage the game with new players.

Before we do actually add any new players, we have to decide how many
we are interested in adding, and then who we will actual allow into the
game.  This is where you all come in.

One of the single most important criteria we have always used when selecting
new players is their ability to write well and communicate effectively.
This, coupled with an active imagination and a mature attitude, are the
building blocks of our concept of the perfect PBEM member.  Solid knowledge
of Traveller rules rates a distant third to these elements.

Since we can\'t sit down, face to face, and interview each of you for the
game, we\'re going to do the next best thing.  We\'re going to make you
submit resumes.  While not resumes in the classical sense, they\'ll give
us a good grip on you\'re ability to game over the network, and how you\'ll
mesh with the current players in the present game scenario.

If you\'re interested in actually participating in the TML PBEM, here\'s what
we want from each of you:

  1) A fully fleshed-out player character, built using either Classic
     Traveller or MegaTraveller rules (please specify which you used.)
     Include:
       a) Character Name, age, & profession.
       b) Character UPP (stats).
       c) Complete list of character skills.
       d) Physical description, including height, weight, hair & eye color,
          typical mode of dress, & any distinguishing characteristics.
       e) Complete career path produced while creating the character.
  2) A complete history for the character, including homeworld (must be
     some documented location in the 3rd Imperium.)
  3) A short story.  This may be the most important of the three items,
     since it will give us an idea of how well you write, plus it should
     tell us a bit about the personality of your character.  This story
     really should be *short*, and the ideal length is between one and
     two pages (60-120 lines of text).  Write about anything: a chance
     encounter in a bar, a love scene, a shipboard situation, slogging
     through a swamp, you name it.  Just make sure your PC is deeply
     involved. (A piece of advice: if past PBEM turns tell you anything,
     it\'s that you\'re more likely to be involved in conversations than
     space battles, the last 2 turns not withstanding.  Bear this in mind
     when writing your story. Also, you\'ll be better off demonstrating to
     us that you can make a relatively run-of-the-mill character interesting
     then designing the ultimate genius/spy/ninja/starship pilot.  THIS
     IS VERY IMPORTANT.  WE WANT GOOD ROLE-PLAYERS, NOT MUNCHKIN-BUILT
     POWER-CHARACTERS.)

Those are the entrance requirements.  If you\'re interested in joining the

        <grin>  Is that why the Glisten Imperial Navy took such abuse during
the FFW?  Maybe they should have contracted with Vospor/Trin for some
of their designs...;-)
        Seriously, that is exactly the reason I love TCS campaigns so much -
nothing like actual combat between several different designers\' works to
find out what _really_ works.
        Which is one reason I collect warship designs.  You never can tell
when a really first-rate idea will pop out at you...

     Anything at all, except more conversions of GDW standard designs.
Warships from fighters on up to super-dreadnoughts.  Merchant ships
(preferably profitable ones), exploratory ships (and survey ships to go
with), anything.  Design for any species you like (though I have minimal
use in the K\'Kree except as targets for orbital bombardment), even
K\'Kree.
     In other words, surprise me. :-)

     I\'d tell you, but our databases are not time-stamped... ;-(

     And if you have looked into FF&S, I find that converting from HG to
FF&S (using THRUSTERS, NOT reaction drives) looks easier than from
HG to MT.  Except that you have to design the weapons yourself.  Any-
thing of that sort would be of interest...

I don\'t agree.  Many humans keep monkeys as pets.  I don\'t think they
would object to Vagr doing the same.  I think, more insulting, is the
idea that they should be offended (ie that a Vargr is so close to a dog
that he should consider how it is treated as a model for how he should
be treated).

I know that this isn\'t SFLovers maillist but I discovered an 
absolutely fantastic collection of science fiction. I have completed
my collections of Piper, Niven, Anderson, Cherryh, Heinlein, Norton,
Pournelle and others. 

In my glutted sated stupor I have thought of the TML and hereby 
offer to help anyone else looking for rare science fiction. 
This is the lifetime collection of a true fan. Nearly everything
is in mint condition. It appears to include complete collections
from several authors. It spans $0.40 Ace books from the early 60\'s
to recent 90\'s titles. I have yet to see another eight boxes of it.

Anyway, if anyone is seeking specific titles, email me with 
author, title, and price. I will check the collection again in a
week (when I have more cash.) The owner has been much more than 
fair on price so far.



TTFN,

Glenn, deliriously happy....a quest is at an end!

BTW, Whatever happened to SFLovers? I haven\'t heard from it in months.

Well I believe I\'ve heard of some religion that had "monkey gods". Can\'t
say for sure though but I don\'t think it\'s beyond reason.

I was just thinking. If the Vargr are really derived from dogs ala
Grandfather and all that, what genetic characteristics would they have
retained? Do they smell the same? Do they have the same pheromones, sexual
compatibility, etc. (not wishing to raise anyone\'s blood pressure, we\'ll
leave the last subject well alone).

Perhaps Vargr would hate dogs? After all, dogs are hardly renowned for their
intelligence. Their reaction on meeting a Vargr (assuming it has the same
type of smell as a dog) would surely be to go and check out the exact smell
of this new \'dog\'. We all know how dogs go about doing that...

Humans A and B return to their ship to meet Vargr V.

A: "Hi Grrrwk. Look at the beauty we managed to pick up in the pet market
today."
V: "A DOG! I\'ve told you before about..."
A: "But look at its cute eyes. It\'s a puddle, so I\'m told."
B: "No, that\'s poodle, dung-head!"
V: "I don\'t care. If it comes one step closer."
B: "He\'s just trying to tell you it likes you, Grrrwk!"
V: "I\'m warning you! What in Harak\'s name is it doing to my leg?"
A: "Aw look, it must like you"
BBBBBLLLLLAAAAMMMMMMM
A & B: (backing away) "Hey now Grrrwk, put the pistol down..."
V: (holding smoking snub pistol) "If you ever, ever, ever..."

I think I\'m going to have some fun with this one. :-)

  The HOSDOC is designed to form the central co-ordination 
centre  for the COAFC System Defence of a well-to-do world, 
usually of a  High Stellar tech level. It rides a high 
geostationary orbit  above the system\'s main world, and 
provides a docking port and  resupply base for an entire 
squadron of standard SDBs. 

  HOSDOC is equipped with the very latest sensors and 
electronics available at TL 14, allowing the detection of 
intruders at quite long ranges and giving sufficient 
warning to allow timely
interceptor launch.  
  
  The fighters and SDB are attached to the outside of HOSDOC,
allowing them all to be launched simultaneously; a good HOSDOC
crew can clear all craft in under half an hour.  Once the craft
have been launched, HOSDOC\'s massive array of communication
equipment allows it to remain in touch with and co-ordinate all
its\' brood at interplanetary distances.  

  A large number of the 113 command crew are naval tacticians,
and these specialists are positioned in the large holo-tank
buried deep in the heart of HOSDOC. Here, they can co-ordinate
the defence of the entire system.  In the unfortunate eventuality
of the SDB screen being dispersed and the main world being
attacked, HOSDOC is not without its own defences.  

  Armour as good as a cruiser\'s, reasonable nuclear dampers 
and a good sand screen can fend off all but capital ship 
attacks, while
the 100 missile bays and the laser turrets give it a pretty
reasonable attack capability - for a carrier. If, however, HOSDOC
is overwhelmed and the crew have to escape, all the external
docking jetties can be jettisoned (taking ten minutes) and the

An interesting question, actually. The answer is likely dependent on how
much the Terran human-canine relationship will have changed in ~3000 years.

I don\'t know how well know this is known to the average Traveller in the
Imperium, but it was my impression that canon dictated Ancients used Terran
dog DNA to create the Vargr - indicating that they are indeed quite
related, perhaps moreso than humans to chimps. Furthermore, I don\'t think
humans would react too strongly to other races using ape-like critters as
lab animals and dog-and-pony shows - after all, we ourselves use our
genetic co-descendents for such in this day and age.

IMHO a simple solution is to opt for the Vargr being somewhat dismayed at
humans keeping dogs for pets, but a more realistic (and ultimately more
interesting) on is to play it case by case, determining what factors into
an individual Vargr\'s reaction.

Morning Star Class Packet TL14

     The Morning Star class packet was designed by TrinTechnics to carry and 
defend a moderate quantity of passengers and cargo.  Several corporations 
bought them for use as executive transports, but sales to private operators 
were few, due to the difficulty of meeting payments with the low cargo capac-
ity.  Less than forty were built before upgrade of TrinTechnics\' facility to 
full TL15 capability.  Most of the vessels were eventually returned to TT as 
trade-ins, and were mothballed until the outbreak of the Rebellion.  Unset-
tled conditions in Corridor, and favorable prices from TT, caused a number of

independent merchants to purchase the remaining ships.

Berserker Class Fighter TL14

     The Berserker class fighter is designed for general space operations. 
Long duration patrols are possible, but uncomfortable due to the minimal crew
accommodations.  Like most fighters, the cost of the computer is responsible 
for the majority of the final craft cost.

Kontos class Fighter-Launch TL15

     The Kontos class is the result of a design project sponsored by the 
Planetary Navy of Mora in 1110.  The prototype was completed by the notorious

Moran branch of TrinTechnics in late 1112, on time and slightly under budget.

Flight testing was satisfactory, and the Moran Navy contracted with TrinTech-
nics for a full scale production run beginning in 1114.  Several hundred 
craft were completed when news of Emperor Strephon\'s assassination reached 
Mora.  The production line was expanded shortly thereafter, and sales were 
permitted to registered armed vessel operators (Starmercs).  By 1121, over 
two thousand had been produced.

     The Kontos is popular among small AVOs due to its clever multi-purpose 
design, which gives a great deal of operational flexibility without impairing

the craft\'s usefulness as a fighter.  For most operations the relatively 
short endurance is not a problem.  Bunks are installed to provide a minimum 
level of long-term accommodation for the regular two man crew if a multi-day 
patrol is necessary.  The asymmetrical computer installation allows easy 
operation in routine conditions and good combat responsiveness at a low cost,

with some loss of damage capacity. The Model 7 computer installation accounts

for nearly 50% of the cost of the base model.  Some production models have 
also been sold with a down-sized battle computer installation--a Model 5 set 
up at a total cost of MCr27.58, and a Model 3 set up at a total cost of 
MCr21.69.

Starflare class Close Escort TL15

     The Starflare was designed and produced by the Mora branch of TrinTech-
nics.  The first test model was completed in early 1114.  The Starflare 
exhibits a number of typical TrinTechnics design features: the asymmetrical 
computer installation, short endurance, and multi-task design in particular.

TrinTechnics designers attempted to wedge as many useful features as possible

into the Starflare, with the nuclear damper installation perhaps being the 
most unusual in a  vessel of this size.  This was prompted by a perceived 
need to defend against small Vargr vessels with easy access to nuclear weap-
ons.  A small troop contingent, a slight surplus capacity in accommodations, 
and provision of cold sleep chambers for prisoners allows a Starflare to 
engage in boarding and capture operations.  As of 1120, no navy in the Domain

of Deneb had ordered more than a few test examples of the Starflare, usually 
citing the low endurance as the cause of rejection.  However, 23 of the 
vessels have been produced for private purchasers.

Shriek class Missile Boat TL15

     The Shriek class missile boat was designed for the Imperial Navy by 
ConTech of Glisten in 1112, as part of a proposed test of an \'escort rider\' 
squadron.  The theory of course, is that what works well for larger combat-
ants should work well for smaller ones.  However, several delays in funding 
had pushed the projected test date into 1123 by the time that Glisten was 
overrun by the Aslan in 1121.  Only six Shrieks had been built, and they 
served with distinction racking up twenty three kills of smaller Aslan war-
ships at a loss of only one Shriek.  The five surviving boats were evacuated 
aboard a Lobachevsky class fleet tender during the Imperial Glisten Navy\'s 
final retreat from the system around 110-1121, and are currently (1122) de-
fending the now-strategic starport in the Grote system.

Yep, you\'re probably right.  However people are a strange lot and sometimes
what we do to our 
friends/relations/genetic relatives might be acceptable when we do it
ourselves but unforgivable if perpetrated 
by others.  This is true for different human societies  might it not be even
more true for ALIEN beings.. I mean 
they\'re all wrong, wrong,.... misshapen, unpredictable, probably even
downright evil (lets face it a certain 
paranoia seems a inherent in humanity).. but I\'m ranting.

lots of people said something like
>I think that it\'s up to the individual Vargr
 this is a valid point but IMHO it\'s good to come up with some
generalisations to describe the other Races, 
otherwise we have no baseline from which to create that individuality.  If
every question was answered this way 
we would be dealing with humans(dare I say in alien suits 8-) ) as we are all
indivduals too! (I think?).

Anyway i\'m happy with the thread as all I set out to do was start some
discussion :-).

I don\'t know that SDBs etc are such a silly idea if you consider that only
the major world and if possible any 
Gas giants have to be protected.  In this case they just hang around in these
areas until the agressors come 
to them. This eliminates the need to co-ordinate battles over an entire
system.  I think that the battles would 
be fought over these important objectives in the system.  Thus you have all
battles occuring at the 100 
diameter zone of a planet or Gas giant.  This of course makes Gas giants
easier to defend as your opponents 
must travel longer in normal space at negligable speeds where you can detect
him and vector in defenders 
against him.  Planetoid belts may be another matter.  Actually I think the
real reason that SDBs are a joking 
matter is that they have no real military strength (you need a Meson spinal
mount for that).  They are very 
effective at discouraging small pirate ships (again assuming that the SDBs
limit their activity to the 100 
diameter zone of the primary world).
Perhaps of course all of the above is because I don\'t really hold with ships
being able to predict their vectors 
through jump etc.

Oh yeah, nice design Hugh

Yeah, but those are primitive religions that have generally been abondoned
at our current level of development.  Such worship has never been proposed
for the Imperium, are the Vargr to be considered socially primitive?

Furthermore, these religions were based on general animist worship (which
worshiped a number of different animals) and not on a concept that the
monkeys were our "ancestors".  We don\'t worship monkeys because they are
our "brothers".

Actually, it my understanding that this isn\'t strictly true.  They are
genetically engineered (and then evolved) from the same canine stock
that later gave rise to wolves and dogs (and other canine species) on
earth.  I similar to how humans evolved from the same primate stock
that also gave rise to baboons, chimps, etc.

Not anymore than we hate baboons or monkeys.  But I do think that if
an alien thought we should consider baboons to be equivalent to us
and should be embarrassed by them, that would be insulting.

Ah, what that subject actually means is that I was wondering
what kind of computers all you TML/XBOATers run on.

More specifically, if I was to make some semi-useful piece of

similar) what platform would you like to see it on?

Like,

 - Unix/X - could use Tcl/Tk and some free db package...
 - Windows - I have an ooold copy of Visual Basic
 - Excel - Excel 5 has a lot of programming support
           and is available for mac and pc

 - etc, etc

Now, I\'m not promising to actually make anything, but I think it
might be useful to know what kind of software would get used the 
most (ignoring things like whether or not it sucks).

Hmm. I think some of these numbers are totally off, but I don\'t have my
rule books here, so I may misremember. Are you using CT, MT, ot TNE rules?

My own knowledge of naval rank structure derives mostly from Napoleonic
War stories, so I may be far off in my comments. Still, I\'ve always seen
the Imperial Navy as a counterpart of Nelson\'s. (I\'ve even made up my
own version of warrant officers). Steve may be able to come up with some 
comments based on present-day usage. Basically your organisation seems 
very top-heavy to me.

As I understand it ensigns are officers-in-training. You\'d have a few in
each department, but they would be superfluous to the running of the ship.
They\'re _learning_ how to do their job, not qualified yet.

Shouldn\'t you have enough pilots, navigators, etc. for three shifts? Or
at least two?

A Master CPO is an awfully high rank for someone in charge of a 4-man
team. I\'d suggest four spacehands, one of them able and the rest 
ordinary or less.

In a napoleonic Era a full captain for a ship with a crew this size would 
be quite reasonable (Indeed, it would be a job for a quite senior captain), 
but then, that would have been a 2nd rate Ship-of-the-Line. This is a navy 
whose capital ships runs into thousands of crew. If \'captain\' still is the
highest rank for the commander of a single ship then there would\'ve been
a shifting of the ranks that would make a HOSDOC a commander\'s ship (OTOH
\'Commodore\' may have become a "senior" captain in which case captain would
be right. An XO one rank lower than the captain is standard.

>    3  Chief Engineer                          Commander     

But your Chief Engineer is in charge of 6 people. That\'s a sub-lieutenant\'s
billing IMO.

Six identical departments rate a seperate OIC. Have a Flight Chief as
department head. He\'d be a Lt. Commander and the individual FTs would
be lieutenants.

The medicos are special, all right (I believe they are always officers),
but a full commander for a departmwent of four? OTOH I think you\'d need
more medical staff than 4 for 700+ men.

That\'s a new one to me. I thought the senior Marine officer did any
\'liasing\' necessary.

    You are making a silly assumption.  Specifically, you assume that
an attacker must attack all gas giants in a system.  Not true.  The
attacker may attack at any point in the system of his choice.  The 
defender, not knowing where the attacker will choose to attack, must
defend _every_ place the attacker is likely to attack.  So in our
solar system, four gas giants plus Pluto plus Terra must be defended.
Which divides your strength into six mutually unsuuported groups.  An
attacker of equal strength just has to pick one of your groups, jump in,
and attack it.  He has a six to one strength advantage, so he wins.  This
can be repeated almost endlessly, since when the attacker "jumps out",
he may "jump out" to another planet in the same system, appearing 
there one week later, and attacking THAT planet\'s defender.  It\'s called
"defeat in detail", and it\'s the worst nightmare of any commander in
charge of forces scattered widely from each other...
    There are other detail sorts of problems with your basic outline of
the course of a battle, but I won\'t bother going into them now, since
my comments have all been made before...

    As to the charge that SDB\'s don\'t have spinal meson guns, why not?
The SDB\'s *I* design all have spinal meson guns.  The only SDBs
around that I have ever seen that DIDN\'T have meson weaponry were
the "standard Trav" SDB, plus all the variations and derivatives designs
posted here over the years.  _Good_ SDB\'s are the size of a light
cruiser, not a 400T nothing...

I\'ve lately been running a campaign set in the Spinward Marches during 
the Fifth Frontier War.  I\'ve done a fairly extensive biography for every 
PC and every major NPC.  For each such character, I\'ve determined at 
least the homeworld, and fleshed out the character generation by 
determining specific missions on specific worlds (let\'s see, a raid 
during your fourth term in the Navy that would\'ve been in 1100 ... um you 
were involved in a raid on Pandrin, to put down Vargr pirate bases ((not 
a real example))).  

I\'ve also determined what the character\'s family was like, and at least 
sketched out what other family members are doing, how old they are, how 
they get along with the character, etc.

Now how do I do all this, you ask?  Well, I just make it up, based on my 
judgment, the character\'s statistics and progress through the character 
generation system, and my knowledge and vision of how my universe is.  
That\'s not fair, really, and it\'s not reproducible, but I\'ve had some 
success with it.  The keys, like in the rest of running a game, are 
consistency and plausibility.

Anyway, sorry, no house rules here, per se.

    This is not quite the way they do things in the USN, but pretty close.
Note that, among other things, the Navigator on a US warship is usually
the same rank as the Chief Engineer, one rank below the XO.
    Naval vessels in the real world don\'t have pilots or co-pilots, of
course,
they have watch officers, instead.  The senior watch officer should be
somewhere between LTjg and Cmdr...

    Note also that in USN usage, a seaman/fireman/airman is "in training".
Skilled crewcritters are petty officers, so the PO ranks tend to predominate
on our warships.

> Shouldn\'t you have enough pilots, navigators, etc. for three shifts? Or
> at least two?

    In US usage, the "Navigator" is the department head of the Navigation
Department, and so should not be duplicated.  Of course, the Nav Dept.
will have quite a few guys...

     There are very few MCPOs in the US organization for a ship\'s crew (a
submarine usually has only two, if it even has that many).  With a four-man
crew, we would have probably one spacehand, two junior petty officers,
and a first class PO to run things.

   Frankly, comparing the HOSDOC to Impy warships in general, it should be
commanded by a CMDR AT MOST.  Which would leave the XO, the Chief Engineer,
and the Navigator at LCMDR.

     The Chief Engineer is in charge of all the engineering/maintenance

They are nominally the equal of the Navigator, and only slightly junior to
the XO.

agree with Hans here.

    What is a Flight Tactician?  The individual pilots are the tacticians out
there.  However, there should be a Wing Commander in charge of all
the fighters who stays at home, plus a squadron commander for each
squadron who flys with his squadron...

   How did you manage a medical department of only four with a crew of 700?

    Note, finally, that any _real_ warship carries enough crew for three
watches
at all the important stations.  Real warships also have minimal automation,
since
they have to carry around enough guys to have installed spares for battle
casualties.

The Vargr were genetiaclly modded, certainly - but weren\'t the various
strains of Humaniti also modded? I always pictured the Ancients\' role as
analogous to those unseen guys who kept droppin Monoliths all over the

No. Consider the timescale. The men that the Ancients grabbed from Earth
(for whom I\'ve just recently coined the term "Homo Antiquitus") were all
Homo Sapiens. Most of his present day descendants (Solomani, Vilani,
Zhodani, and Darrians to name some) are fully interfertile. Possibly
some of them are not; I wouldn\'t like to bet on the Genoee or the Floriani;
but if the descendant brances of Homo Antiquitus, evolving on different
worlds for 300,000 years, are still compatible, then their common ancestor
must be too. Similarily the doggy ancestors must already have been dogs 
300,000 years ago, not proto-dogs. 300,000 years aren\'t much evolutionarily 
speaking (I\'m more interested in how the Vargr can look like a variety of 
canine races that hadn\'t even been bred till a few hundred years ago ;-).

The Mac.

If not that, then Unix.  If it\'s DOS/Windows it would have to be
virtualy indispensable (and since I already get by without it :-)
before I would use it.

I don\'t see this at all.  First of all, Vargr had several 100,000
years of evolution after they were genetically engineered.  Aslo,
I would say that being genetically engineered is more of a "clean
break" than a human who has an unbroken line of decent from primates.

More associating Vargr as being trumped up animals.  When humans want
to be primitivist do they swing in trees, eat bananas, and go "ooh ooh
ooh"?  No, we emulute more primitive _intellegent_ ancestors.

I would say that a Vargr\'s reaction to this thread would be "typical
human prejudice".  However, I think it is probably very typical
of attitudes in the Imperium.  (That and the attitude that they
are all disloyal pirates).

because people had started on the "I can throw a rock faster at your planet"

    No, the "doggy ancestors" of the Vargr were wolves, not dogs.  Think of
a dog as a juvenile wolf, and you\'re close...

    Also:  the reaction of Vargr to dogs may be interesting, but I\'d bet that
the reaction of the dogs to the Vargr would be much more interesting....

Seriously, though, if it\'s not "beyond reason", then use it.  It
will be refreshing.  After all, so much stuff in Traveller *IS*
beyond reason.

     Oh, I\'m SO sorry!  I forgot that we were talking about CT, where a
"solar
system" consists of a Starport, a fuel-scoping location a few miles from the
starport (the gas giant), and a big spotlight to provide a simulated
day/night
cycle...

     Why bother worrying about whether SDBs can defend a system?  You
can use the usual logic ("Because I\'m the GM, that\'s why!") and declare that
any system can be defended adequately by any passing Free Trader.  Or
attacked successfully by any passing Free Trader, if that\'s what the
"adventure"
for this week is....

These are _player_ characters that you\'re generating, not the general
population.  Character generation reflects the background of restless,
rootless adventurers rather than the average stolid citizen.  (I\'m
paraphrasing the reply I got from GDW years ago.)

The same argument applies to any other species.

Yeah, but those are primitive religions that have generally been abondoned
at our current level of development.  Such worship has never been proposed
for the Imperium, are the Vargr to be considered socially primitive?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Not in general but there\'s a lot of worlds out there. 
More than enough to find just about anything, I reckon.
=======================================================

Furthermore, these religions were based on general animist worship (which
worshiped a number of different animals) and not on a concept that the
monkeys were our "ancestors".  We don\'t worship monkeys because they are
our "brothers".
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Doesn\'t Shintoism & Hinduism still retain \'animist\' characteristics?

I don\'t see why a society/world couldn\'t be tecnologically modern &
still retain alot of \'traditional\' social practices/customs.

Mainly Unix/X-windows (suns and HP730s).  With the occasional use of 
departmental PCs (DOS/Windows - yuk).

My own machine is an elderly Acorn Archimedes, which still gives some 
service.

What would be best for the software, is a set of source code for the 
_core_ functions of your program, that is platform independent.  That way 
the user interface (the only platform dependent part) can be added for 
each platform.

ANSI C would possibly be the best language to use

Thanks for your points as this is a topic that interests me greatly.  
However I would like to defend myself (a bit), I never stated that a 
commander would spread his/her forces all over a system.  What I 
was trying to say was that one fleet concentration defending the 
homeworld was the key to "system" defence as all of the other 
planets in the system are practically worthless(economically, 
population etc).  The other major resource of a system is (in a military 
sense) it\'s gas giants as they allow naval refulling.  I reckon that they 
would be ignored by most commanders without vastly superiour 
defending forces otherwise the \'defeat in detai\' that you suggest would 
of course occur.  What I said was:
"only the major world and if possible any Gas giants have to
 be protected"
the "If possible" in this sentence was supposed to convey my 
explaination above (I\'m sorry that it didn\'t).
unfortunately this does lead to a very defeatist approach that only 
hopes to protect the key resource of a system and that cannot 
effectively deny refulling to enemy incursions.  This is OK for small 
nations but disasterous for the imperium etc. I suppose that this 
means that they cling onto the resource of their worlds, and allow an 
enemy incusion until it can be stopped by a major counter-strike fleet. 
 Your thoughts on this would be appreciated

My SDB statements were with respect to standard trav SDBs.  If 
there has been some redefinition of this term I accept it, as i am not 
aware of all that has gone on here at the TML. I do know that GDW 
refer to battleship/cruiser sized non-jump-capable system defense 
craft as "Monitors" (see Imperium, the boardgame).

      In going over Rob\'s designs I noted his use of
"asymetrical computer arrays" in some designs. For those
who skipped them over, the basic ideas is to install,
say, two computer-1\'s and one computer-7. The ship can
gain all the considerable benefits of computer-7 but
loses its redundancy for damage. As on small combat ships,
particularly fighters, the computer is responsible for
a large percentage of the cost, this seems a simple
and beneficial trade off.
      However, it does call into question some of the
assumptions I had made about the triple redundancy
requirement for starship computers. This question came
up recently in my own campaign. I used, as an example,
the real-world example of the Space Shuttle. (What I
can remember of it, anyway.) It also has three computers.
They each perform the necessary calculations of space
flight all in parallel. One is used as the primary source
of results. However, these results are cross-checked
against the #2 computer. If they are the same, they
are accepted. If they differ the #3 computer is
consulted and the best two out of three is chosen.
      This is the model I had assumed the traveller
triple computers also ran under. Thus, for all normal
operations, all three computers run the same calculations
in parallel. Only when at dock (and for doing jump
calculations, which are fiendishly difficult in my
world) can the computers be run either separately or
dynamically linked for higher productivity (sum the
squares of the computers and take the square root,
eg. Computer-3x3 = sqrt(3*3 + 3*3 + 3*3) = computer-5).
      By this logic a computer array would operate at the
ability of the smallest computer (the only way to keep
them in sync). Thus a asymmetrical computer array would
be of no use except for independent operations.
      What have other people assumed? If you do allow
asymmetrical computer arrays I think that could have
a wide reaching influence. I know my players, for certain,
would have upgraded their computer a few jumps back
to gain the benefits. They could have afforded one,
but not three.

Rob, in answer to your attempt to understand system defences and the
new-found role of the SDB (and ignoring the unnecessarily aggressive and
sarcastic responses of other people), here\'s a short summary of previous
discussions:

(1) SDBs are, under TCS and MT (i.e. superceding CT), too small, lightly
armoured and under-armed to defend anything against anyone, apart from
shipping against small-time piracy.
(2) Hence any system defence must be by far larger cruisers, etc. or
armoured satellites.
(3) The old principle of defending the gas giant is no longer sensible
unless you have an overwhelmingly large fleet, because:
(3a) You\'re splitting your forces between 2+ spots with the obvious problem
that an equal strength enemy system will, by concentrating solely on your
main planet, immediately gain a 2:1 (or better) advantage.
(3b) Under MT and TNE rules they\'re so far apart (with regard to travel
time) that they can\'t support each other, etc. even using minijumps, etc.
(3c) Gas giants just aren\'t regarded as that important if the attacking
fleet brings in tankers, or does a short last jump in (keeping enough fuel
to jump back out) or there\'s an alternative fuel source (starport, planetary
water, etc.)

Oh, and of course:
(4) None of the above is any use if someone throws a rock at your planet at
a high fraction of the speed of light...

It took a number of people an awful lot of heated discussion to sort out the
above points (and some of them will no doubt blither on further if I haven\'t
quoted the exact points they made in my summary above). Point (4) took even
longer.

The whole reason I said:

> No, please! Not the old "SDB\'s can\'t defend a system" argument. That was
> only (finally) clubbed to death a couple of months back and then only
> because people had started on the "I can throw a rock faster at your

was not to put you off, but to stop the same amount of hot air being
regenerated on the same subject. My apologies if this somehow offended
someone but I really do wish some people would try to provide supportive
help and constructive criticism instead of stirring ashes in the hope of
sparking a flame.

If anyone on xboat _truly_ believes this list is purely for idiots running
unrealistic CT kiddy games, then perhaps they\'re subscribing to the wrong
list?

I\'m afraid the only records I have of the discussion are my own posts in
January (x167) and February (x168) which I recall supported Steve\'s
interpretation of the gas giant defence situation, and one from MSAMUELS in
February (x183). I believe the relevant flaming - sorry, discussions -
occurred in the preceding period, so xboat digests from about 160-166 might
be of help to you?

I hope this helps you Rob.

I assume that the standard shipboard computer has all the redundancy 
already built into it!

For example the I (& Ibis) machines, are 1ton.  Thats 14 m^3, a lot of 
volume.  I have in there... CPUs, memorys, storage (on-line, off-line, 
magnetic/optical whatever), cooling & ventilation, printers, and a 
supply of stores (paper, floppy disks etc).

I am though trying to rewrite the CT rules on computer program size and 
computer capacity, the CT computers seem a little small.

aslans in those character classes?  True, you can\'t generate an Aslan

This is a truism that applies to all societies.  There is no reason to

in the Imperium (and the subject of the occurance of primitive religions

Well, *I* never said that the Imperium *didn\'t* have such  things.

Anyway, if the Vargr are to be truly alien then it should be allowed
that it isn\'t necessarily valid to compare their reactions to human
ones anyway.

Which doesn\'t necessarily mean that the Vargr will or won\'t. They are

I\'m working up a description of an amphibious race, and I was wondering 
how well senses transfer from water to air and back; if your ears are 
adapted to water sonic properties, would you be deaf in air, or 
sensistive to frequencies not normally encountered in air-borne sounds, 
or just reduced in hearing abilities, or what?  I\'m looking to have an 
idea of the senses, and my first idea is that eyes are adjusted to air, 
to look out of the water at threats, etc., and the ears are adjusted to 
the water.  This leads to a language which has a verbal form, augmented 
by body posture in air, and taste signals in water.  However, how 
feasable a verbal language is if your hearing is adapted to one 
environment I don\'t know.  I\'ll stop now, and wait for any answers.

Again, quite true. Ever tried AD&D? With youngsters? I play it and I\'m proud
of it, but then that\'s because I run an adult group and the games are
realistic, gruesome and detailed. I\'ve rarely seen children able to run good
games because they don\'t have the experience nor, ironically, imagination
required. This is particularly true in the past 5-10 years (certainly in the
UK) where most children seem to have been brain-washed by computer games - a
major cause of the destruction of their imagination, because everything is
provided for them on the screen.

>    But the CT people seem to spend a lot of time trying to

I am probably guilty of this in my own _Traveller_ games. My group consists
of:

Myself (degree in electronics, mostly a computer programmer, doing a PhD in
radar),
My wife (PhD chemist),
Chaz (degree in electronics - background in radar, GPS, etc.),
Neil (degree in physics, background in computing),
Laura (doing a PhD in historical literature research),
Nick (degree in electronics),

and an assortment of others at various times,

BUT:
the players don\'t have a background in sci-fi (from childhood reading,
etc.), nor do they have their own Traveller rulebooks. They seem to have
quite a lot of difficulty handling some Traveller concepts, so the last
thing I try to do is confuse them with technicalities (unless Chaz starts
disputing something to do with radar!). Technicalities scared off one player
totally (come back Barry, all is forgiven) - perhaps because he did not have
the technical background of the other players, for he is quite happy to
continue to play in my AD&D group.

Having witnessed some of the acts they have got up to, I would in no way
class my Traveller as a \'childish\' game (for the same reasons I classed ,
but I think it is necessary to recognise that some gamers have to sacrifice
a small degree of reality in their games in order to maintain a smooth game
flow.

That is not to say that xboat & TML should not discuss matters of reality!
It is up to individual referees to decide what they include in their games.
Similarly, when quoting data, referees should remember to say if it is canon
or from their own games.

Sounds like a great idea to me.  Then us hackers coule modifiy it to suit
our own tastes.


WRT to the idea of a CT sourcebook, I have been kicking around a similar 
idea myself.  If GDW isn\'t interested, perhaps we could (with GDW\'s 
blessing of course, we wouldn\'t want to violate any copyright laws ;-) ) 
compile something ourselves.  Just a thought.  Hmmmmm, a hypertextual 
database might be nice....

Looking at the TNE rulebook in the shop the other day (never read it
or played it) I noticed that the crew requirements for TNE ships
are much higher than for their MT equivalents.  I\'d be immensely
grateful if someone would inform me how TNE works out crew numbers
for each department, as it seems to me that these figures are rather
more realistic than MT figures.

Are you basing your estimation of demographics on the probability of getting
into a career?  If so, I have to disagree with your methods.  Unfortunately I
can\'t find the letter I had from GDW (from Marc or Loren, I think) so I can\'t
give you the \'official\' line.  As far as I can remember, I was told something
like "those are to make generating player characters interesting. If you want
to play a mechanic, make up the career and play a mechanic."  Taking this
advice, I incorporated all sorts of careers in my HyperCard character
generator (because I used it mainly for NPCs).  If you like, I can try to
find teh file and extract the career tables.

You\'ve read too much MT, and believe the re-interpretative post hoc 
explanations: CT computers as the authors first knew them were something 
different...

CT was written as "1950\'s SF with 1960\'s technology" - those computers use 
VALVES!  Transistors were brand new (and "would never catch on \'cos they were

too unreliable"), and ICs had not been dreamt up yet.  It was the computer 
itself that took up the whole mammoth 13.5m^3, and took umpteen kilowatts to 
cook the valves; and the computer staff probably spent most of their time 
continuously replacing blown valves (hence the manning levels!)

When DGP and GDW came up with MT, they tried to use 1980\'s and early 90\'s SF
and 
technology, and with that described an entirely new type of ships computer,
but 
with the same displacement etc as the original books.  They just filled the 
extra (implausible) space with workstations, displays and access spaces
instead 
of valves.

----

If you can get hold of a copy, yopu might like to look up FGU\'s SPACE Opera 
computer rules.  They had massively parallel computing way ahead of reality
(all 
of a decade...) - their memory units *are* the processors, so the large 
computers are *very* powerful.

    'body' => 'Greetings!
    I only skimmed when the SDB discussion flew past before.
But, judging by Andy\'s summary, I think I have a different
interpretation that might be new (I trust Andy to tell me
immediately if I\'m covering old ground and I\'ll desist
further verbiage...).
    The operation of going into a low, atmosphere grazing
orbit around a massive Gas Giant was less than simple. You
can only scoop across the equator. And only when the winds
are in your favour (cross winds and turbulence in a Gas
Giant\'s atmosphere are *bad news* to a scooping ship). Your
course is set well beforehand and fixed. The gravity grows
high enough that later course correction is not really
possible. Any deviation, anyway, is likely to move you out
of the "safe zone". The slingshot in and out again accelerates
you to speeds you can\'t really handle other than by prediction.
Add to this the fact that your sensors are going to be
almost useless for seeing ahead or below for EMS and Neutrinos.
Can\'t think why densiometers can\'t warn your about air
density ("It is vitally important for a <starship> to have
a fully functioning barometer". Who recognises that quote? :-).
    Did you see the atmospheric braking manoeuvre in 2010?
Ever think what sort of static charge you build up on
such a manoeuvre? Even with a static discharge probe you are
going to be followed by a continual lightning bolt from it
miles long (don\'t stroke your ship\'s cat while skimming :-).
One wrong move and you can face the prospect of being deep
enough in the well, without enough manoeuvre to never get out.
    I wrote a story a few years back about a ship whose
static discharge probe had been unknowingly damaged (someone
ran a forklift into it in a previous starport). As they
begin to skim the read the static building and work out
what is wrong. There is nothing they can do, though. Their
course is locked. Eventually the lightning strikes crippling
several systems. They can level their flight but they are
too deep to climb out again and into the really nasty
atmosphere. Imagine a leaf in a turbulent stream. Needless
to say, it doesn\'t have a happy ending.
    [I have this and other "traveller" stories. I usually find
such stuff on lists irritation so I haven\'t posted it. If there
is interest, I will. Be vocal.]

    So, having set what I see as the scene, lets look at what
this might mean in a game. Firstly, most of my Gas Giants have
a series of weather satellites but in place by the Scout service
to (monitor for science and) predict and advise ships of local
weather conditions. Frequently, if the system is in any way
civilised, there will be a cracking station with skimmer ships.
A cracking station takes low level hydrocarbons (methane, or
ammonia, or else just hydrogen and a carbonaceous chrondite
planetoid) and cracks it into higher multi-chain hydrocarbons
(like gasoline, kerosene, etc). Oil and petroleum are not going
to be common in the universe at large (being a by-product of
long-term life of particular sorts). All plastics (except rayon)
are petroleum derivatives. Thus petroleum cracking and plastic
synthesis will generally be important industries.
    Skimmers are not your meagre ships boats or cow-like tankers.
As they have to regularly deal with skimming, several times a
day, what is a low level risk for a tanker becomes statistically
higher. They are usually needle configuration, streamlined with
an airframe. Topped out as much as possible on manoeuvre drive.
Their pilots are usually at least pilot-3 and have a reputation
for being "wild and crazy beings". They also act as unofficial
rescue boats for spacers who have accidents around Giants.
[You could even theorise an Imperial Drama program about a station
and its skimmers. Sort of "Baywatch" in space. Gas Giant
surfing dudes. :-]
    Now, imagine a hostile naval force in a refuelling situation.
They will not have the co-operation of the weather satellite. They
will have to take their own scans and use historic data to
predict optimal conditions. They may storm a cracking station,
if it exists, and suborn the skimmer pilots, and take use of their
local knowledge. Or else use the cracking stations skimmers
themselves. Odds are if the system is in any way defended the
defenders have already blown the station and skimmers.
    So the naval fuel shuttles must start the operation of
skimming the giant. These tend not to be highly manoeuvrable
ships and are going to be transversing generally fixed
courses.
    Take a skimmer, as described above. Cut down its fuel tank
and replace it with some moderate armament. Call it a SBD.
Let it lurk in an equatorial orbit at or around skimming level.
It is damn difficult to see into a Gas Giant but not quite so
bad trying to see out. They Navy is likely to be passing around
its own telemetry (although probably encoded). If it can\'t get
enough info it can alter orbit till it is just above the line
where it can (periscope up!). Once it can see them incoming on
a particular course it can assume they won\'t deviate. It can lurk,
like a shark, until within range of a shuttle and then fire.
Almost any surface explosion is likely disrupt it. The static
discharge probe (presumably retracted for normal flight) and
surface sensor arrays seem particularly likely targets. They can
only undergo limited evasive actions. Any less-than-trivial
adjustment would doom them (by the above reasoning). Sort of
like trout-farm fishing. Then they just descend again and surface
elsewhere.
    Thus, the target of the SBD attack is the fuel shuttles,
not the naval ships themselves. Anyone ever design an armoured
fuel shuttle?

    Is there an astrophysicist on the list? I would be interested
in comparing my assumptions to reality. For the four gas giants
in the Solar System, what depth would have to be penetrated before
a air-pressure equivalent, say, to earth sea level, was achieved?
What would be the gravity at that point? Assuming we are starting
at a 1-diameter orbit and flying a course to that depth and
out again in an hour (standard skimming time) what is the maximum
speed achieved and what manoeuvre is necessary?

    I will go off and design a skimmer. I\'d like to digest others
reactions to my assumptions and then I\'ll propose a SDB design based
on the skimmer. Other proffers welcome...

Sound Travels well underwater.  Hearing organs adapted in air work
"OK" in water.  I don\'t know about the other way.

Water scatters light so vision is restricted in range.  As you go
to any real depth, you run out of light.  Eyes can work well for
both water and air, but some (not all) species will have trouble
focusing in the other medium.

As far as lanuage goes.  If we are talking about a developed race,
body form are probably going to be less popular as they progress
because a) they are harder to record, b) they don\'t transmit well
over "voice only" media, c) they make you stop tasks you are working
on when you want to communicate (this is probably the most important,
unless the species has "extra" limbs to spare for this purpose, in
which case it would lower the barriers to such communication).  I
am assuming moving and positioning of limbs.  If you have to move
and position the whole body, it would be even more inconvenient
and would probably drop in popularity more quickly.

Taste has the problem that, even under the best circumstance, it
is going to be slower than other forms.

David Summers - Summers@Ethyl-the-Frog.ARC.NASA.gov

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Well neither do I. (Note that I regard the label "big dogs" as a human 
reaction & therefore not necessarily valid, as I have stated previously.)

But I also think that it\'s not beyond reason that what was postulated
could well be. Just because it seems like they are acting like "big
dogs" to humans doesn\'t necessarily mean they see themselves that way.
It just means that someone or some people are making a generalization.
If some creatures are to be truly alien then nothing, including acting
,or appearing to act, like "big dogs" should be excluded from their pos-
sible behavior, IMO.

I sent off something a few days ago about gas giants, bit it never seemed
to hit the list. Odd. So, here goes again.

Somebody wrote that they thought that SDBs were underpowered and
usually too spread out to be effective. That is, If you had 100 SDBs
against 100 invaders, even though the SDBs may have some advantage by 
having no jump drives (CT&MT), they\'d be spread out over an entire system,
thus reducing their effectivness to defend any one spot. I don\'t think
that that\'s necessarily how it is...

First of all, what would a SDB look like? It wouldn\'t really be the 400t
Patrol Cruiser detailed in the old black book. More likely, it would be a 
cruiser-sized vessel, in the 1kt-10kt range. There would be no jump drive,
no fuel purification plants and probably less sophisticated life support
systems because they wouldn\'t spend so long in deep space. This translates
into a ship that could easily outgun a jump capable ship of equal tonnage.
The vessel would be built somewhat higher than local tech level, but
maintained at planetary tech level, meaning that extremely old SDBs would
either be in bad shape or have to be overhauled every few decades.
(Ships build higher than local tech level would have been built out of
system or built by bringing in off-world contractors and high-tech parts.
It would cost more, but presumably, it would be worth the money, especially
if you\'re a tl 11 or 12 world, expecting tl 14 or 15 ships to be your
eventual concern).

SDB distributions wouldn\'t be uniform across the system - you defend
places where there\'s people or resources you want defended. As Jo Grant
describes in the last xboat, gas giant skimming is probably less than
trivial.
A small number of high-g, specially designed SDB lurking just under the
surface of the gas giant can cause enough trouble to severely hamper
fuel scooping.

SDBs surrounding a world would be backed up by close orbit forces
(atmospheric jet fighters) and deep meson gun sites on larger/high tech 
worlds. (I think these alone would severely hassle any hostiles trying
to land on a world, but using SDBs gives you a chance to stop them from
even trying to land). Most orbital landing craft have low accelerations
and probably handle like pigs in an atmosphere, making them easy targets
for fighters. So, anyone trying to put down a big force onto the ground
is going to have to somehow endure a fight between them, in space 
shuttles, and ground defenders, in F-15s or what have you.

In short, although SDBs probably aren\'t quite as powerful as a naval
cruiser or battleship, they can probably hold their own quite well.
Also, I think that most SDBs wouldn\'t have been designed to hold
off Imperial forces - after all, why would the Emperor invade his own
worlds? (Ha!) They\'d be built to repulse excursions from border states
and be used for internal security which would be either lower tech
or small (< 1000t) vessels.

Fights in which the hostiles are trying to capture an asteroid belt or 
orbital station are left as an exercise for someone with more time and/or
imagination than myself.

material from the sci.space.tech FAQ shows destruction was not complete. 

>From Sci.space.tech FAQ

Contrary to popular belief, the plans and blueprints for the Saturn V
have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on
microfilm. The Federal Archives in East Point, GA also has 2900 cubic
feet of Saturn documents. Rocketdyne has in its archives dozens of
volumes from its Knowledge Retention Program. This effort was initiated
in the late \'60s to document every facet of F-1 and J-2 engine
production to assist in any future re-start.

The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it
is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\'s vintage hardware (like
guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB
have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch
from.

By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify
the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean
sheet design.

Other references:

    Several AIAA papers delivered in recent years discuss reviving the
    Saturn V. For example, AIAA paper 92-1546, "Launch Vehicles for the
    Space Exploration Initiative". This paper concluded that a revived
    Saturn V was actually cheaper than the NLS vehicle.

An overview of the infrastructure still available to support production
    of a 1990s Saturn V and how that vehicle might be used to support First
    Lunar Outpost missions can be found in the December 1993 issue of
    _Spaceflight_, published by the British Interplanetary Society.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE

    If you *don\'t* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a
    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your
    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to
    watch out for when ascending, and you\'ll have eardrum trouble if your
    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal
    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no
    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do
    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.

    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some
    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)
    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from
    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,
    you\'re dying. The limits are not really known.

The only safe way (!) is to exhale and leave your mouth open. Your body
operates on the oxygen in your blood for an amount of time based on your
Health (average man: 10 seconds). Quadruple that time if you move slowly,
or multply by if you just passively float there. Double if you
hyperventialate first, and quadruple if you used pure oxygen. Once out of
breath, you fatigue rapidly and fall unconscious (in 10 seconds for the
average character). Four minutes later you are brain dead. If rescued after
two minutes of this 4 have elapsed, you may be brain damaged.

Explosive decompression is worse, because your eardrums pop violently and
small blood vessels burst. You have to make rolls for each eye to avoid
blindness, to avoid getting the bends, and to not get the Hard of hearing
disadvantage. Furthermore, your body\'s liquids do boil into space in a
matter of hours, leaving a fragile powdery husk that cannot be used for DNA
cloning.

This is something I\'ve wondered about.  In SCUBA class, you\'re taught that
the problem is relative volume.  Air breathed at 33 ft depth will expand to
twice its volume at sea level.  But air breathed at any pressure will expand
to fill a vacuum (near-infinite volume?).  Lungs must be able to retain SOME
air though, even in a vacuum.  The question is, how much?  If possible, it
would make sense for spacecraft to keep their atmospheric pressure low enough
that you CAN hold your breath, which would give you the best chance of
surviving.  I agree "the bends" are probably the least of your concern at
that time (I think you only need repressurize to 1 atmosphere for treatment,
which is probably at the top of your agenda anyway, although there might be
some immediate stroke danger from nitrogen bubbles, especially if you\'re out
there for a while).

In old Traveller, this was called a "monitor"; if I remember right, there
was a rather inefficient one in Fighting Ships.  Essentially, it\'s a 
battlerider that never leaves the system.  Maybe SDBs are useful as cheap
mobile missile platforms that can be produced in quantity.  A wing of, say,
fifty SDBs with missile launchers might be a problem for a CruRon.

I didn\'t mean to impugn you... 

I was illustrating some gaming history, and the way that games derive from
the 
books the game authors read, and the subsequent revisionism as the present 
overtalkes the future.  Recent books, and hence new-from-scratch games (eg
not 
TNE) emphasise the compactness and portability of computers (to the extrem of

cyber-stuff), \'cos the authors have met ICs and powerful microcomputers.

Trav is one of an older genre of games derived from still older books, in
which 
heavy power-plant, fuel and drives dominate the ship, and massive computing 
engines figure highly.  [For a good laugh, re-read EE Doc Smith\'s Lensman
books, 
in which the older dictionary definition of "computer" is used ("one who 
computes") - they navigated by slide-rule!

There never was a ship with so much volume, mass or power comsumption
dedicated 
to computation as Trav envisaged in its "future"!  It is one of the "quaint 
charms" of Trav to recognise the \'50s and 60\'s SF stories in it;  and I
derive 
some amusement from reading the efforts of later authors to make it all sound

plausible while struggling not to remove the foundations of the rules...

It *was* "science" and "feel right" when CT first came out!  In MT they tried
a 
revised "science" and "feel right", but since then the present has overtaken 
them again... (But no-one foreshadowed the Pentium divide-bug!)

I felt in MT that the boware was OK - the number of workstations and
holo-tanks 
you could add fleshed out the required volume until it sounded plausible,
like 
the 3m separation between deck-levels (1.5x1.5x3m "ton") allows a sensible 
ceiling and inter-deck trunking.

MT tried to glide over the CT "programs" and concentrate more on the effects.

(In CT, with a Model 1, you had to swap out programs to run even simple
tasks, 
like swap Maneuver for Fire Control!)
MT tried to make it feel like the programs were intricate and extensive
(giga- 
or tera-bytes of holographic storage), unlinke the reels of mag.tape for CT.
(or 
was it paper tape???)

I think a SDB is a Heavy Cruiser or at least a battleship without Jump

You could also put Satellites in orbit to defend against intruders, or manned

disagree with the analysis of SDB\'s in the 10000 ton range, I myself would

At TL=15 and under second edition _High Guard_ rules (two big caveats,
yeah, but that\'s where my development arrested), 10,000 tons (and no
larger than 20,000) is optimal for non-starships-of-the-line
(battleriders, and monitors, which are pretty much interchangeable), since
at 10kton you can just fit an N meson gun (most spinal-grade hits/ton of 
system weight) and wrap it in maximum protection, something like this: 

WB-K106KJ2-E09905-000N9-0 TL=15
btty            2    16   10,000t
brng            2    16   ~MCr10,000 in quantity

Crew=122, cgo=60t; Agility=6.

God knows how that works out in MT, of course.

As a long term, ancient gamer, I sympathise with many of your
points. I do a lot of fantasy gaming as well. I used to check
out new systems looking for one that had a more realistic model
of fighting, etc, etc. Then I started doing some SCA (historical
recreation) where you actually put on armour and bash people
with sword size and weighted objects. The conclusion I came to was
that no system I had seen came close to reality and it was
unlike that one ever would.

The wider lesson I learned was that *any* element of *any* RPG
system will always fall down and fail to satisfy a professional
of that element. This makes a degree of sense. If the system is
truly realistic then you need to be a professional to operate
the game mechanics. E.g. if you had a professional (expert? :-)
system for fisticuffs, say, then it would mimic all the decision
making processes necessary for doing such professionally. For
you to succeed you would have to make the correct expert decisions
and thus might as well be a professional boxer.

So where does that leave us? If you accept that any system is
only going to be an approximation then what you have to do is
to pick/tailor that approximation to meet the level of expectation
that your players require.

Andy broke down his group as an example, I\'ll break down my
current group for my example:

Me      Degree in Mathematics, employed as a computer professional
Wife    Doctorate in Biblical Studies, in academia
Derek1  Basic Leaving Cert education, works in a print shop
Derek2  Basic Leaving Cert education, sells plastic barrels
Colin   Studying for Leaving Cert

All are around their late 20s (except Colin who is 17). With
this sort of varied, non-technical, background this influences
what gets singled out as important in the campaign. They run
a merchant ship. When I work to produce CARP software it is
more along the lines of shipboard account management, and
course plotting. They don\'t care about ship design, they just
want to know what ships are on the market (and actually used on
ship for 3 years, real time before I realised that it was
underdesigned by 16 tons! But then that turned into an interesting
plot device...)

The summary of what I am trying to say, is that different groups
will require different support in various areas. In an open forum
like this you have to expect that 95% of what is here is [largely]
irrelevant for each particular campaign. Aside from being inevitable,
there is a certain benefit. Areas where heated debate takes place
on the list that is of no direct interest on your campaign can
exist as coloured backdrop. The raging debate over human attitudes
towards Vargr could surface as anything from what _else_ is on
the news to NPC motivations. Balkanised systems could be all het
up with accusations and counter accusations of member states
developing or researching high-V planetary bombardment weapons
provide tension leading to a plot device. Recent independent studies
calling into question the relevance of SDBs might prompt actions
from industrial action to a crackdown on government expenditure.

None of these may be directly relevant to the main plot/theme of
a campaign, but, they can all add richness and texture to
almost any campaign.

Well, there were a number of studies done in the pre-skylab years of the us

library.  The scientists used chimps & other animals for testing, and found,
basically, that if you have an oxygen mask on & keep your eyes shut, you 
can survive hard vacuum for 3-4 minutes, exhaling constantly.  (your eyes 
are particularly vulnerable to freezing).

I\'m not an animal-rights nutso or anyhting, but exposing chimps to vacuum 
to watch how long it takes them to die seems particularly Eichmannesque...

>>  It is up to individual referees to decide what they 
include in their games <<

A splendid philosophy, and, of course, the one on which all 
true RPGing is built. So why does this list react with such 
violent, unproductive scorn when such referees post 
ideas/rules/designs based in their own campaigns ? Not just 
me whingeing; I\'ve seen it done to others. 

Traveller is torn between the hyper realism approach and 
what is derided earlier as "kiddy" - and which is also held 
up as trying to retain the original flavour of Traveller. 
Surely, the imagination behind the adventure and the gaming 
pleasure received by the players is far, far more important 
than whether you allow SDBs to hold a planet against mighty 
fleets or insist on complex 3-D vector movement of ships, 
missiles, planets et al in every combat (I\'ve seen both 
done!). If it plays, and the assembled group enjoys, 
terriffic! Every reason for the ref to feel good about it 
and post a few ideas. And no reason for people elsewhere in 
the spectrum to flame them.

C\'mon you perishers! GDW have abandoned "real" Traveller; 
about the only creative source available is this list. At 
this rate, the cynics responsible for creating TNE will 
have been proved right.

Darius Jedburgh lent on the wrecked remnants of the shattered striker grav
tank 
his unit had lost earlier to a tac missile hit, "There\'s nothing worse than a

battle won - except a battle lost."
	Captain harrelson, Jedburghs aide de camp and executive officer of the 
Red Hawks mercenary unit grunted in agreement.  His main worry was being put
on 
another damn starship for a weeks jump - if god intended man to travel in
jump 
space, he would have fitted him with a jump drive !

harrelson activated the map box precariously positioned on the remains of the

grav tanks shattered hull, amidst a bottle of half drunk reginan brandy (1102

vintage), and a wad of papers and after action reports.  after connecting the

battle computer link, they went over the tactics of their previous three day 
engagement to see what tactical lessons they could employ next time.

The first key to their success was in using their air/rafts effectively.  
Previous experience (raid on camp V) showed the potential of the extra
mobility 
for creating mobile fortresses in which the commando company could deploy, 
strike, or hold terrain, and then scatter.

The second key lay in their communications network.  by hooking up mapboxes
and 
"squirting" data concerning their positions to prearranged nodes, the company

could keep in touch and adjust tactics as the situation demanded.

The third lay in re-arranging pallets of logistical supplies.  each platoon
had 
supply pallets containing sufficient medical supplies, food, water,
ammunition, 
power packs etc. to keep operating.  The system also minimised the number of 
troops diverted to making up supplies as necessary for porting to the 
battlefield.

The fourth lay in the choice of weapons.  though a little controversial the
red 
hawks stead-fastly refused to upgrade to gauss rifles, in spite of the higher

tech tickets they could compete for.  The key problem lay in resupply - in a 
longer campaign gauss may be difficult to obtain, and if operating in a
hostile 
environment ie. a planet whose government is both lower tech, AND not happy
to 
see us, they may embargo gauss rounds, making life rather difficult.  besides

Jedburghs ACR had jammed a total of three times - he relied on it, and would
not 
change it for a squad of PGMP equipped marines, besides as he often joked "If
I 
need PGMPs - what the hell does the enemy over the hill use...."

If I ran a civ. and was in war with somebody, or just to get rid of my

	Here I am a few millenia later engaged in one of the oldest professions 
known to humaniti.  Early scriptures showed how Greek hoplites from
Alexanders 
army hired out as mercenaries throughout the civilised world due to their 
prowess, but amongst the wheat was also a helluvalot of chaff.  Various scum,

brigands and liars who claimed to have served with the young strategists, 
emperor cum conqueror.

Not much has changed.  Jedburgh opened the map box, and attached his 
communicator.  the faint red backlighting engaged to show the terrain
features 
ahead, and three green dots (indicating the red hawk platoons), a blue dot
(the 
armour brigade of the freshian league, which the Red Hawks were contracted to

scout for as light skirmishers), and the red dot of the "brimstone" Corps. A 
mercenary formation based out of jewel, composed of the various flotsam and 
jetsom of the military business. scum for short.  Jedburgh wiped away the 
condensation on his faceplate out of habit, doing no good.  Here he was in 
jungle wearing a closed environment suit - it had the advantage with the
chiller 
can of rendering him and his team invisible to the IR sentries, but christ it

did not stop him drowning in his own sweat !

Hang on, he orientated the mapbox again just in case. Damn ! Brimstone had 
deviated from the plan - I mean that\'s OK he thought, but the local boys are
not 
stupid, if they alert the locals, that will bring a veritable storm down on
the 
Red Hawks.  Jedburgh basically had a choice - break radio silence to talk to
a 
bunch of fools, or carry on the plan.  Naturally for a human he chose the
third 
option.
	He packed up the map box, and motioned for his team to move out.  They 
had chosen an approach across fairly open terrain for two reasons.  One it
was 
night, and the locals lacked thermal imaging, only IR, and two they would
never 
suspect an assault from this direction.  All they had to do was attack the 
barracks, kill all commo links with the capital, and the Freshians would be
free 
to annex the disputed oil field no problem.  

Isn\'t it amazing how much time you get to think whilst performing mercenary
ops. 
pondered Jedburgh.  He though about brimstone again. The real mercenary pro\'s

Jedburgh pondered realised the key characteristic of the business.  It was
about 
people.  get the right people, trust others (as far as it goes) and never
forget 
an asshole.  He must of slipped up this time he reckoned.  Varrilon was his 
recruiter.  he had stuck with him since a chance meeting at the end of the
Fifth 
Frontier War, and immediately struck up a good working relationship.
Varrilon 
knew jedburghs criteria - no cowboys, preferably ex-commandos, or marine
support 
troops. Premium on technical knowledge, common sense, and above all "do they 
look lucky".  Napoleon once commented on his Marshals "I do not care how good

they are, are they lucky ?"  by god he had that one right.

Red Hawk Alpha reached the sand berm and took cover.

"Red Hawk Bravo" - Platoon B was in position.

a minute passed

another minute passed

"Red Hawk Charlie" - Platoon C was in posiiton to back up the withdrawal of 
Alpha and Bravo.  Always keep a third in a good backup position thought
jedburgh 
- someone has to cover a withdrawal, and how can anyone when they are running
- 
this reminded jedburgh of the fourth golden rule "be prepared to run".   Mind

you when his platoon leaders told him "how come you never run" he responded
with 
usual aplomb "don\'t do what I do, do what I say".

All of a sudden the hairs on Jedburghs neck rose.  He heard the low phwap of
a 
laser cannon. Damn those Brimstone boys - they must think a bonus exists for 
taking the barracks - shit.

"Alpha, Bravo - execute".

He charged across the ground - 500 meters to the barracks, by now illuminated
by 
flares, and laser discharge.  He say the lead elements of Brimstone - mainly 
trucks backed up by a couple of ramshackle grav tanks.  He could hear
screams, 
occassionally blotted out as his hearing protectors cut in when a
particularly 
loud explosion cut in on his thoughts.  250 meters out, and he saw that the 
enemy were getting it together. not good.

A tac missile rippled out from the post straight into a truck.  It was
flipped 
on its side, and exploded - men, or what was left of human beings staggered
out 
aflame, like roman candles in the night.  jedburgh dropped to the ground and 
looked through the sight of his ACR, panting hard he spoke to himself "don\'t 
fail me now baby".   He looked over the barracks, and there it was - a side 
door.  well, well, well there\'s hope for human kind yet.  He motioned to the 
door, and a fireteam set off.  He and a couple of Hawks checked the
battlements 
through their scopes. Ah sentry.  He exhaled and pulled the trigger.  The
figure 
in the night jerked, convulsed and fell out of sight.  Jedburgh leapt to his 
feet and ran towards the door.  Time was against them now.

Meanwhile the Brimstone idiots were getting repaid for their stupidity in 
spades, the local boys had moved LAG troops and tac missiles to halt the
armour 
attack coming from the NW.  He looked forward and saw the fireteam stationed 
either side of the door.  Jedburgh pointed and te fireteam went to enter.  

Suddenly a flash, followed by a shock wave, knocked him off his feet. Damn,
the 
door was wired !  He looked forward through the smoke, gingerly getting to
his 
feet. Time, Time !  He ran forward - nothing was left of the fireteam save a 
rifle - typical - the weapon survives to fight another day.  He jumped
through 
the door followed by his men.  corridor. left barracks - reinforced by LAG 
troops, right stores, forward (remembering the intel report) courtyard and 
command bunker.

He directed his radioman to set up an open channel with the freshian guard 
armour brigade, a just arrived fireteam deployed to protect him.  Right
thought 
Jedburgh, lets end this fiasco right now....

his four man team ran out into the courtyard - he could see men on the roof,
and 
shilloutes scampering around, trying to salvage their defence.  Ahead was the

bunker, he saw a small sangbag defence near the steps to the enterance, and
let 
off a HE grenade from his ACR - the sudden whoomp, and light sent the sentry
to 
obivion.  His backup men ran down the stairs with satchel charges.  Jedburgh 
moved back towards a wall, 

tink, tink, tink

You bastard thought Jedburgh, no-one pops this commando on a dark night.  He 
swivelled the ACR and fired a burst which discharged his entire Mag.  He
fumbled 
around for a spare, as he saw his team run back.  Then the bunker blew, smoke

venting out from the shattered enterance.

Jedburgh switched channels on his commo link "Guard, Hawks, Objective 1
cleared"
He and his men stormed the bunker, which was a bit of an anti-climax.  A
burnt 
out shell remained, papers were all burnt, bodies mangled and warped by the 
shock wave - war was a messy business.

"Alpha, this is Bravo - fire over, locals have surrendered."

They left the bunker, the defenders were filling down off the roof into the 
courtyard where red Hawks were disarming them.

"Colonel" Havel Masterson entered the courtyard, his grav tank nudging apart
the 
enterance doors.  It juddered to a halt, the colonel jumping straight off,
and 
strode up to the red hawk command group..

"Jedburgh, my task is to coordinate prisoner transfer to the Freshians, you
are 
hereby released from your contract"

Yeah right, thought Jedburgh, here I am with some three dozen scared
conscripts, 
and you want me to turn them over to your scum. no way.

"The Freshian brigade is about three klicks away, we might as well hang on,
and 
catch a lift bac.  In the meantime we can assist in protecting the prisoners
- 
John (motioning to Bravo\'s commander) will set up a perimiter defence while
Alha 
can guard the prisoners, and you lick your wounds."

"major, do not let me pull rank on you"
"OK \'Colonel\' lets keep it simple.  Your corps is a complete joke - yur 
knowledge of tactics pathetic, and your treatment of your men zero.  I am not

letting these prisoners be left to a simple son-of-a-bitch like yourself. 
understand"

around him the red hawks got agitated, some pointing their ACR\'s not at the 
Brimstone troop leader, but there again not away from him either.  Masterson 
locked eyes with jedburgh. an eternity passed. suddenly, the comlink
crackeled 
into life - objective 1 this is guards, 1 klick away, do not engage."
masterson 
looked at Jedburgh, "this does not end here." he snarled and stormed away.

Life at the sharp end, mused jedburgh. "Harrelson, wheres those copies of the

contracts..."

==CLOSE-DEFENCE OF STARPORTS, ETC.==
Bart, here are my views, i.e. what happens in my game (NB: starport refers
to any docking situation, including small ships into large ships):

(1) All starships are required (by Imperial/local law) to have their weapon
systems (including weapons sensors) powered down when within weapons range
of the starport. The device (typically a computer program) responsible for
this is called the \'weapons interlock\' program. This also explains why
anti-hijack systems may not use any external ship\'s weaponry for ground
defence.
(2) Possession of a starship with a faulty or tampered interlock system is a
SERIOUS offence.
(3) Starport sensors can detect the following:
 (a) Close range - if an individual weapon is powered up.
 (b) Medium range - if shields or multiple weapons are powered up. 
 (c) Long range - if spinal weapons or active (weapons) sensors are powered
up.
(4) Doing any of the above without bloody good reason you tend then to
discover:
 (a) Starports have better sensors than you.
 (b) Starports have better weapons than you.
 (c) Starports tend to have patrolling ships which can come and get you.
 (These follow naturally for any large starport when you consider the total
value of the landed ships, cargo, buildings and people within the port -
people expect their investments to be protected, even at a civilian port).

Operation of the interlock may be automatic (receiving a beacon from the
starport or when passing within a given zone known by the navigation
program), or manual (requiring the pilot to activate it). It may be possible
for some military ships to remotely activate the interlocks on some civilian
ships (by mimicking a starport beacon, etc.). Yearly (or whenever)
inspections are required for ship safety certification and checking of the
interlock system would be included in the inspection.

The hidden explosive cargo is a different type of risk. However, the sensors
available to a starport (as per a starship) should allow it to detect
reasonable quantities of unstable/radioactive elements and hence detect
nukes. Random customs boarding (while the vessel is still some distance from
the port) can prevent such a situation as well as their more common use for
detecting smuggled goods, illegal immigrants, etc.

But that\'s just what goes on in my campaign... no one\'s gonna blow up my
orbital starport after I\'ve spent weeks designing the floorplans :-)

of ..digesting.. the old material. I mostly used MT with injections of
CT rules where needed (e.g. Highguardish space combat with tasks).

By designing ships I have always found that battery power is a real
plus (eg no neutrinos) but that standard batteries are incredibly
expensive and inefficient, therefore I have tried to design a more
efficient battery. I hope that nothing similar has already been posted..

----

The Zuchacell(TM) heavy battery line from GSbAG

The availability of adequate power is one of the limiting factors of
starship design. As soon as the Zuchai crystals were discovered reseachers
realized that they were the most promising energy storing device.
However, the crystal structure cannot withstand the stresses experienced
while energy is accumulated for more than a few hours. AFter these the
crystal rearranges itself and all the energy accumulated is released
explosively.

Another disadvantage of the Zuchai crystals is that they keep memory of
the way they have been charged. This is fact one of the main reasons for
misjump, since the energy delivered to the lanthanum network in jump
drives is first temporarily stored in arrays of Zuchai crystals.

Various companies tried nevertheless to develop battery designs based on the
properties of Zuchai crystals. The Zuchacell(TM) design is the most
successful and common one.

Zuchacells(TM) can only be built in size larger than 20 kl due to the
extensive controls and complex design. A jump drive engineering is qualified
for the maintenance of a Zuchacell(TM) array.

A Zuchacell (TM) contains a redundant set of Zuchai crystals, a governor,
and a small capacity standard battery to correct for the Zuchai memory
effect. Energy is cycled through the reduntant crystal bank so that each
single crystal does not remain charged for more than 1 hour. On charge
and off charge periods are alternated by the governor to guarantee safety.
Thanks to the Zuchai high efficiency energy losses are very modest
(less than one per cent of the charge per day).

The following is the table for Zuchacells(TM). No Zuchacell(TM) smaller than
20kl can be manufactured.

Each kl of battery has the following capacity and price:

TL      Capacity Mwh    Cost(Mcr)
9       24              0.45
10      28              0.48
11      30              0.55
12      33              0.62
13      46              0.74
14      51              0.94
15      59              1.12
16      67              1.2

Each kl weighs 2 tons.

----

If you are interested in how they were "designed":
The cost and capacity have been computed from the zuchai crystal
capacity given in MT combat rules (under black globe) which turns out to
be about 80 Mwh/kl (with a duty cycle 0.5 due to cycling). Controls are
assumed to be as bulky as the crystals at TL 9 and decrease linearly with
TL until at TL 16 are just 10 per cent of the crystals volume. Standard
storage batteries as in the MT design rules are also included for a
capacity of one per cent of the total. The weight and price of the 
crystals plus  controls are 2 ton per kl and 0.2 Mcr per Kl to these
one has to add the storage batteries.

I hope this may be of some use...In general I feel that the full consequences
of various technologies have not been fully exploited in the GDW official
universe..

    I don\'t know whether the Vilani did this, though I would assume so.  The

   Tha ACR is at least 10,000 years old.  Possibly older.  The gauss rifle is
at least
3500 years old, possibly older.  The PGMP (assuming you are talking TL13+) is
around 600 years old.  If you are talking the PGMP-12, then you are talking
3500+
years old.

    Note that the NEWEST device you mentioned is older than the matchlock is
in
the Real World (tm).  Note that choosing a 10,000 year old weapon instead of
a
"new-fangled gauss rifle" (3500 years old) is like choosing (in 1995AD) to
use a
stone spear instead of a bow (with stone tipped arrows) - a bit silly in a
world of
M16\'s, AK-74\'s, and similar infantry weapons...

    Note, btw, that I don\'t disagree with your basic idea.  I just disagree
that these
ideas are _new_ or _unusual_ in the Impy Era....

EBISAWA GRAV BIKES

Ebisawa Inc, are know as one of the largest and
most respected produces of grav-bikes in the
Spinward Marches. Although they have been slated
as mere playthings of no real practical value,
that has not stopped enthusiasts from continuing
to purchase their goods.

All Ebisawa grav bikes are build along the same
basic frame. All are needle configuration using
light materials. Each comes with a pilot and
passenger seat with a 500km radio transceiver
and 5km active EMS scanner. They provide a cargo
space which can double as an oxygen storage tank
for the fuel cells on low-ox atmosphere worlds.
Each also comes equipped as standard with a Passive
IR burglar alarm and a radar detector guaranteed
to warn drivers of any radar activity directed in their
direction as commonly used in most Spinward states.
They have received some criticism for the latter
from many worlds in the Marches citing it as
an encouragement to lawless activity. Ebisawa
still supplies it but advises purchasers that
its operation may be illegal in some worlds.

2. I wish to respond to the points made by JSHiggin in xboat digest 271.  In his
comments of digest 270 he lists the ages of the technologies I mentioned, and
lists them in 
terms of Terran years.  With the star spanning universe having planets of 
variable tech-levels is it not the case that to a tech level 0 caveman, a map
box which may have first been built 10,000 years is still a novety ?
	Secondly when discussing the air/raft, my point was mainly concerning 
the employment of 3d mobility, and making use of it, as oppossed to treating
the air/raft as a car without wheels.
	Third, from my own experience as a player in campaigns and a referee, it 
was always a little more difficult to obtain PGMP and FGMP technology (imagine 
the USA with this kind of hardware available `off-the-shelf`), and so my article 
discussed abeit briefly, the pros and cons of the best of the unexotic weapons - 
namely the ACR versus the Gauss rifle, and it was my assertion that nine times 
out of ten, it would probably be easier to use ACR\'s rather than Gauss Rifles.

An interesting example of the age of these weapons could possibly have been 
witnessed in comments by a US general in a UK documentary (Horizon: The i Bomb)
about technology and warfare.  He showed the example of the Somalis who had a
culture thousands of years old which has barely changed to adapt to the 
Twentieth century, yet were using modern Russian assault weapons, and rocket 
launchers, the Afghans are another good example.  What I am saying is that the 
difference between the age in which a weapon was invented and the culture which 
operate it (and vica versa) is irrelevant, particularly in a traveller setting.  
I hoped to provide ideas for players to use their tools in possibly a more 
imaginative manner, unless the referee hands out striker grav tanks, battle 
dress and fgmps regularly (and I would hate to envisage the opposition...)

In summary, if you had already considered the ideas I put forward in the original 
article, then I apologise sincerely for wasting the news groups time.

Supply.  An SDB, constructed for that purpose, could count on
its supply line and would therefore:

1) Need less space for spare parts
2) Have smaller magazines for missiles (or more batteries)
3) Could be more cramped in terms of living quarters by rotating
   crews regularly.
4) Enjoy any other benefits of an extremely short supply line.


These things would probably outperform a Battle Rider (of equal
size and TECH LEVEL) in most cases.

The difference in performance gets even more pronounced in TNE.

I am operating under the conclusions drawn in the (already beaten 
to death) thread which suggests that defending Gas Giants doesn\'t
work.

    Quite so.  Of course, the TL0 caveman won\'t be commanding a mercenary unit,
either.

    My point was that it had been so used for 10,000 years.  It\'s not NEW...

    It _should_ be difficult to obtain.  But not especially so for mercenary
types.  Go to Efate, and buy there, if nowhere else is available...
    Note, though, that it is still true that the technologies you describe
are over 3500 years old.  The point was:  These things are not NEW.

    Sort of like discussing the pros and cons of using a Brown Bess Musket as
opposed to an M16?  But, no, the Brown Bess is MUCH newer relative to the
M16 than the ACR is relative to the gauss rifle.  How about the pros and cons
of the bronze knife relative to the M-16?  That matches the relative ages
fairly
well...

    That\'s nice.  MY point was that the ways you were considering "possibly
more imaginative" were ideas that are ANCIENT by then.  In fact, most of
them are not incredibly "new" in 1995AD.

    No, no, no!  You miss my point entirely!  I have no objection to what you wrote
(it was one of the more interesting pieces in the last few years, frankly, though it
had a few minor problems).  What *I* was trying to point out is the AGE of the
Imperial Civilization (10,000+ years), which DOES have a bearing on the subject.
    I notice that few of the people who play in the Imperium seem to be more than
marginally aware that most of the "usually available technology" is older than the
Pyramids are to us here in the 20th Century.  Your Point of View character in
that piece was speaking of 10,000 year old ideas as if they were new to _him_.
They\'re not new to him, unless he is mind-numbingly ignorant of the Art of War
in the 57th Century (plus or minus), which no professional military man should
be.
   Which, I suppose, means "keep on, but remember that all this "neato keeno
new stuff" being used in the 57th Century is older than civilization is on Terra
of 1995.  Do YOU think of bronze daggers as "neato-keeno new stuff"?  I sure
don\'t.  As long as you keep in mind that 10,000 year old techniques are NOT
going to be considered as "major elements of the success of our mercenary
unit on this most recent ticket"...

"We All Died at Breakaway Station," a pulp science fiction novel from

(a courier or something) have gotten separated from the fleet, and 
their computer is damaged by enemy fire, so they have to navigate 
back to wherever they belong by using a slide rule.  I\'ve forgotten the

"Starman Jones," by Robert Heinlein, also from that era, has the 
navigation staff all calculate their jump numbers (or whatever they 
were called) individually, then program the numbers into the ship\'s 
drives only when everyone agrees.  Starman Jones comes up with a 
number different from the captain\'s, but is either shouted down or 
cold-shouldered into suppressing it, and everyone agrees with the 
captain\'s figures.  Of course they end up lost in space. I\'ve 
forgotten how they navigate their way back, but I\'m sure they used 
plenty of pencils.

I take it you never encountered Kubricks Jaw Bone rangers operating out of

I consider highly unfair that yoiu do not at least compare like-with-like i.e.

I notice the focus of your piece being concerned with the fact that the original 
article "Lessons of modern war" discusses the employment of technologies which 
are by the time of the Fifth Frontier War very old technologies.  In your 
posting in Digest 272, however you refer now to;

Do YOU think of bronze daggers as "neato-keeno new stuff"?  I sure
don\'t.  As long as you keep in mind that 10,000 year old techniques are NOT

1. are you aware that in General H.Norman Schwartzkopf (ret.) autobiography "It 
doesn\'t take a hero" (The General commanding the coalition against Iraq in 1991) 
he refers to his major influence being I think (the book is not ot hand) 
Alexanders battles and those of Roman generals, which by 1991 would be some 
4,000 years old.

2. The gulf conflict itself, involved a battle of manoever on the western flank, 
which in Alexanders day would have been performed by horseborne cavalry, were in 
1991 performed by light Cavalry Fghting Vehicles, backed up in the East by a 
deception plan to fool the Iraq Army as to the axis of the attack.  Did not the 
Israelites employ some kind of deception plan, described in the bible ?

Perhaps there is confusion on both sides concerning the technology, and the 
techniques by which it is used...  If today our military establishments 
regularly wargame, as a tool for learning, conflicts several thousand years old, 
will not the fighting people of the fifty-seventh century be gaming conflicts 
fought much earlier as learning tools ?

In summary, how does this posting relate to Traveller and the recent debate 
between myself and Steve.  Whilst I concede the base technologies to be old by 
the time of CT\'s setting, the techniques of their employment will be probably 
older.  
	The aim behind "lessons of modern war" however, was to provide some 
advice for prospective mercenary players - perhaps a regular "Lessons of modern 
war" column could be in the offing within xboat ?  As GDW never produced a

you guessed it, good old experience....

The Vilani and Zhodani developed Jump Drive in 4717 and 897 BC
respectively. The Vargr developed it while we (Solomani) were in the Dark
ages - 708 AD, after the K\'Kree got it in 376 AD.

The "Modern" Imperium is about 5635 AD - over 3600 years from nowQueries:
does anyone play a campaign in an earlier part of time (say, 4728 AD during
the Vargr campaigns, or 5318 AD, during the Psionics Suppressions?) I\'ve
always considered it but don\'t have a campaign of any sort to run right
now.


The Zhodani went from priting press in 4072 BC. By that clock, the Solomani
developed Jump damned fast - ~700 years from printing press to Jump instead
of 3200. Maybe the Zhodani thought too hard.

I\'ve never seen the alien supplements, but the fact that the Vargr had Jump
Drive long before "we" did kinda surprised me, especially after the last
debate on Vargr attitudes. It seems that humaniticonsiders itself superior
to the dogs. . .but wouldn\'t the Vargr feel kinda smug around Solomani?

   Fortunately, no.  Though I once had a character who commanded a mercenary
regiment who was from a TL4 world.  Does that count? ;-)

    Are there any such that were around in 4000BC?  A bow or sling, I guess,
count.  Do you serously expect to see someone comparing the merits of the
bow/sling versus the M16?  A military man, I mean?

    Note, btw, that in CT the gauss rifle is overwhelmingly better than the
ACR,
in MT it is slightly better, and in TNE is generally worse.   Note also, fyi,
that
the ACR is the weapon I have used most often in "mercenary" situations.  I
only had one group ever that use gauss rifles.  But then, I never claimed
that
I did it due to some inherent superiority held by the ACR.  Just personal
preference.
    Note also, that you haven\'t really gotten a picture of Impy warfare till
you
get original Striker, and equip a battalion of Impy Marines to fight a war.
VERY educational!  ;-)


   Actually, I think you missed the point.  That was mostly literary
criticism, in fact.
Nothing wrong with the info (for the civilians out there who don\'t know
better), but
the POV character sounded suspiciously like he was "explaining how a blaster
works".  Very poor literary technique....

   Yes, I am.  They were, however, strategic influences, not tactical.
 Tactical use
of the weapons available now were developed in WW2 and later.  Some are still
being developed (IMHO, we still haven\'t figured out the proper use of the
helocopter
yet).

    Probably will.  But they won\'t think of the ideas learned there as
"modern",
and "innovative".  And neither should your POV character.

    Quite a good idea, really.  Just remember, as a literary device, the POV
character
should never describe something as if it were "neato-keeno new" that has been
part
of the last 10,000 years.  Or even the last 1000 years.  Even if it is
"neato-keeno new"
in 1995 where we are all sitting...

   Much?  No, not really.  Maybe a dozen in the last fifteen years...

    We have played in the Terran Confederation period (between the second and
third Interstellar Wars, I believe it was) occasionally.  The game is a
change of
pace thing, so we seldom do much with it, but it is still around if we ever
need to

Not surprising here, but I\'ve looked this up a long time ago.  Note also that
the
Vargr have been "civilized" (they built their first cities) long before the
Vilani
did.  About 45,000 BC, which is better than 20,000 years before any branch
of humanity got that far.  The only "modern" races which got to civilization
sooner were the Droyne and the K\'Kree.  And the Droyne cheated...and I
never liked the K\'Kree anyway :-)

I can well see Steve\'s points about the relative age of the mercenary
equipment mentioned in Jeff\'s post. However, I would like to point out that
a lot of people playing such characters (and to a degree their referees) are
rather ignorant of military tactics. Now, some groups are lucky - I get the
impression a lot of subscribers to the old TML (and possible current ones)
have or had military backgrounds anyway. But to the others, a bit of a hint
on why particular mercenary groups are so equipped is helpful. I don\'t have
the post to hand, but one might assume that Jeff\'s mercenary group is
planetbound and not the interstellar \'for hire\' group that most people think
of. After all, there are plenty of opportunities on a single planet for such
a group. Their limited experience and home world tech level (and the age of
settlement of the planet) would all determine how \'modern\' weapons and their
use were viewed.

>From my own viewpoint, I would think that at higher tech levels, mercenaries
tend (as Steve said) to be fairly equally equipped with similar weapons
(e.g. PGMPs, FGMPs) and then I think it is usually the (1) other equipment
and (2) tactics which matter more, i.e. 
(1) Chameleon armour, uncrackable communications links, computer-controlled
HUDs, etc. - very much electronic warfare.
(2) Getting more firepower to a position than the enemy - better protecting
your troops, supplies, etc. Careful use of grav AFVs, etc.

Remember the logistics: low tech war, lose one soldier with perhaps CR50k
training, CR2k of kit. Medium tech (say today\'s crack SAS, etc.) lose one
soldier - that\'s c. CR1M of training [semi-official figure] and perhaps
CR20k of kit. Lose a high tech infantry man (battledress and FGMP) - that\'s
perhaps CR100k training and perhaps CR1M kit? FOR A MERCENARY UNIT, which is
effectively a profit-based organisation (okay, so some people do it for
kicks!), you just can\'t afford to lose soldiers (or worse, vehicles) like
you can at low tech.

So, here\'s my version of higher tech!

either wholly or in part.

        Corporal Frank "Zappa" O\'Leary froze instinctively. His chameleon
armour - a lightweight, high maneouvrability battledress - continued to
\'flow\' for a fraction of a second before matching to the surroundings. Tiny
areas of the armour modulated its colour to match waving foliage around him.
        The jungle was dense, shadowy, heavy-leaved and oppressive. The
latter was helped slightly by the wide angle visor of the battledress
helmet. Helmet cameras compressed the view behind him into thin bands at the
edges of his vision; coloured blips played across the Head-Up Display,
displaying known troop dispositions as green dots. It was the orange dot
which was dangerous.
        Without moving his helmet, Frank\'s eyes flickered upwards. He could
not see the tiny hovering globes around him - each about fifty metres away
and ranging from ground to tree canopy in height. These camouflaged \'eyes\'
ranged across the electromagnetic spectrum over a far wider range than
Frank\'s puny human sight. Mostly remaining passive to hide their location,
occasionally a random drone would \'chirp\', sending a burst of active sensor
pulses into the surrounds, both it and its colleagues picking up and
processing the reflected signals.
        And one drone had chirped, located a target, and had failed to match
it against the constantly updated position data of Frank\'s unit. Not that
the drones would be expected to pick up any of his unit - the battledress
was designed to fool visual and IR sensors while absorbing radar,
ultrasonics and other detection systems. The orange blip was not visible on
passives, so Frank knew it must be well concealed - perhaps even in a bunker
or covered trench.
        Frank waited a further moment; his whole unit would have been warned
of the potential hostile and he knew better than to advance without orders -
the battle computer, or perhaps even his commanding officer, might decide to
send in a combat droid, or fuz-bomb or allocate an alternative trooper to
the job. Confirmation arrived. His eyes flickered across the holographic
displays on the visor, eye movement activating \'switches\' and automatically
relaying the message that he was on the job, assuming command of a drone,
instructing it to approach the hostile. Visual camera pickup flashed up in
one corner as Frank began to advance. He kept on foot - activating the
integral grav belt would be nice but the radiated fields from the damn thing
more than quadrupled his signature, even with the high tech ECM of the
battledress.
        The remote view of the drone flicked between visual and IR. Frank
noted the slight round coolness of a camouflaged pit trap on the ground
ahead of him. The drone sniffed no explosives, could identify no unusual
linearities within its vision (to indicate trip wires, etc.), nor could it
detect life forms within or around. Given the local tech, the \'natives\' were
obviously resorting to archaic trapping techniques! The drone continued a
further hundred metres then rose and skewed around to approach the hostile
from behind and above. Visual showed an area of thick growth but the
thermal-imaging showed multiple shapes - a gun pit of some sort. The drone\'s
sensors indicated a well-shielded power source - probably an energy weapon. 
        Frank had reached the trap pit but gave it a wide berth. After all,
the rebels might have obtained a \'Slinky\' or \'Weasel\' or some other
low-signature mine. He selected the ammo type for the multi-gun, confirmed
target programming with a single wink of the eye and pulled the trigger. The
IntelArm 97b \'Drifter\' puffed gently into the air and through a hole in the
canopy before igniting its weak rocket. As it powered in a short arc toward
the target, Frank decided it was time to move and clicked in grav, rising a
few feet and zipping away to one side. The rocket dropped through the canopy
approximately above the target - simple sensors pinpointed the target centre
- it showered pellets then an instant later fired its penetrating charge.
The charge bored a hole through the plasteel canopy on which foliage had
been laid for camouflage. The resulting explosion of molten steel was
augmented by the fire-cracker effect of the anti-personnel pellets, ensuring
no one survived.
        The drone showed Frank the results. He almost smiled but then his
HUD went hay-wire. His previous location near the pit, now a hundred metres
to his right, ignited as the enemy brought down retaliatory fire. Orange
hostiles began winking into existence as they opened fire at other members
of his unit. One was very bright - perhaps only ten metres away - his own
suit sensors suddenly blaring warnings of a head-shape emerging from the
ground with a linearity computer-resolved to be (93% likelihood) a heavy
automatic weapon - probably a light assault gun. The multi-gun came to bear
but interlocks were already warning him that using the fusion gun option was
dangerous - it\'s blast would tear through the jungle in the direction of a
member of his own unit perhaps only thirty metres beyond the target. The
computer had already selected fully-automatic AP Gauss. Frank pulled the
trigger and the target grew bright red. Visual showed - well, the head had
gone. The computer was already arming a grenade in the launcher and Frank
simply rose a few metres (to give a better angle into the hole) before
pulling the trigger and flying back and away. The earth erupted, enemies
dead or buried.
        Fire broke out around. Drones updated information. Orange dots
disappeared quickly from the HUD. Then all was silent.
        Frank allowed himself a smile now. The computer had decided the
rebels had insufficient reconnaissance kit to allow real troops in rather
than automated combat droids. And the local government had specified minimal
damage to the environment (it _was_ a nature reserve, after all), hence the
lack of heavy grav tanks. Frank was glad. The computer was always right.

    You would probably blow out the bay and maybe one
or two neighbouring ones. That is assuming you were
docking in an internal bay, such as is used for repairs.
By design logic, it is much cheaper to build a stations
of irregular configuration where most of the docking
is intersersed over the hull or long gantries. This ploy
would be even less successful there.
    If you reference the previous "rock throwing" thread
you can see many strategies for one high-V ship (or rock)
that will take out an entire planet. Needless to say this
works much the same for a space station.
    There are more interesting, perhaps, ways you might
take out a space station.
    A normal starship missile comfortably fits inside a
grocery cart (I think). This wouldn\'t be that difficult
to smuggle into the StarSation\'s power plant. The power
plant will be a restricted area, but unless they are
expecting an attack the bribe value you need to get
it will be much less than the cost of the ship you would
smash above. I was reading the other day that if a
vehicle (fusino) power plant receives destroyed damage
it must roll 3D < Tech Level or dramatically explode.
A well placed missile (and a generous DM) might lower this
to D2.
    Another bizzare idea might be to load up your suicide
ship, not with explosive, but with propellant. It would
then (gently) impact into the side of the station and
ignite it. Assuming it was a reasonably small station
the delta-v from the resulting thrust and burn could
destabalise its orbit beyond recovery. Sure, it might take
a year or two before it finally falls into whatever it is
orbiting but that is a couple of years of publicity and
a lot of unwilling investors.

Hello,

I was intersted to know if anyone ever attempted to design a generation 
ship for Traveller (Classic/Mega/TNE).  A ship that would travel at 
sub-light speeds for very long periods of time (tens or hundreds of years) 
and sustain the life of the crew (crew size around 5,000 10,000 maybe?)

What hull size would fit it and what the important parts of a ship like 
that would be?  What Tech level then?  Tl 7,8 or higher?

If there are any designs like that, please DO post them...

Thanks,

           -Shalom Zaidfeld

like to raise however, is the reconciling of military operations a\'la

	I as both a player and referee tended to operate about Tech Level 10, 
thought we did travel around the Spinward Marches in our work, in order to
not 
forget the basic beauty of Traveller - space travel to distant worlds.
However, 
the problem was this - Striker appears to me to be more wargame than 
role-playing game, whereas mercenary though sadly-lacking in vehicle
generation 
rules is great in its provision of an abstract mass-combat system, which in
our 
campaign we proved time and again works....
	By being lower tech - though generally speaking still with a slight edge 
- the odd PGMP for \'stopping power\', we found a niche.  That is, firstly it
was 
easier to relate to the technology and military principles, and secondly we 
avoided excessive number-crunching by getting into situations where - we used

battledress/combat armour - they did likewise and we then proceeded because
of 
near pefect surveillance equipment to engage one another until one side broke
- 
Clauswitz\'s "friction" in motion...

Perhaps ultimately, I enjoyed that style of play - using guile to outwit 
opponents, because I had to.  I have seen players armed to the gills using 
firepower to get out of problems which otherwise might have had to have used
the 
old grey matter.  Perhaps that is my motivation behind writing the article.

    'body' => 'GENETIC ENGINEERING: the act of altering and/or constructing
    DNA sequences to create new or altered life-forms
    subsequently brought to term artificially or through
    a natural host.

    The Science of Genetic Engineering has long been known in
the Imperium. The first attempts at such were mainly along the
lines of selective breeding, as practiced by many primitive
societies. The first direct genetic manipulations occurred by
selective enhancement and alteration of the DNA of various
creatures. The second Imperium was responsible for genetically
enhancing both Orangutan and Dolphin DNA to raise them to a
higher level of intelligence. The most advanced area of this
field, genetic construction, includes the complete synthesis
of totally new life entities from the ground up. The colonisation
of the many worlds of the Imperium, most quite inhospitable,
owes a lot to this sort of genetic engineering. Ecosystems
have been created for worlds where none previously existed
or had no time to evolve.

LEGAL IMPLICATIONS:
    There are many and varied laws throughout the Imperial
member states regarding what can and cannot be done through
genetic manipulation. Surprisingly there is correspondingly
little Imperial law covering the subject. Aside from the usual
guarantees of planets rights to control the import and export
of new or altered beings the one overriding restriction is
that "No human DNA or DNA sequence may be used as a basis
for genetic experimentation or production." (The legal
interpretation extends to other sophont races as well.)
    Many scientists have decried this as overly restrictive.
They claim this as a great setback to human science and
the attempt to eliminate various genetic diseases. Commercial
concerns have complained about the restrictions as sealing off
a large potential market for ecosystem adaptation and tailored
individuals for leisure, entertainment, and special industries.
To understand more about the reasoning behind the law it
is necessary to understand some of the events leading up to
it.
    There was no Imperial control over what could and could
not be done prior to the Genetic Manipulation Act, 194. The
second Imperium was quite free with its experiments and
constructions. There are a number of worlds inhabited by
genetically altered humans originating from this time period.
The popular vid-dramas of "Plutarch Assassins" are not complete
fabrications. It is known that those with money could
have designed beings to suit their whim.
    Much of this was lost over the Long Night but in some
places research continued without even the small restrictions
of the Empire at the time. In the early reawakening efforts
were launched to attempt to recover as much material as
possible and to continue the science. However, as the
core of the Empire expanded more and more unlicensed
worlds were brought in and the results of unlegislated and
undisciplined use of genetic constructions got some dramatic
media coverage.
    On Agafo, a segment of Solomani supremacists
took advantage of the relatively poor diversity of the
Vilani gene set and engineered a killer mange that sought out
Vilani descendants. This necessitated a 400 year quarantine.
    The planet of Emoue was taken over by
the product of a government eugenicist project gone wrong.
An enclave of their descendants still exists but are restricted
to a series of islands and primitive equipment due to their
genetically induced militant tendencies.
    Attempts at autogenesis, cloning and memory transfer,
bore occasional fruits. This set a very disturbing undercurrent
through the nobility and MegaCorporation officers, both of
which rely on inheritance as a means of proliferation and
change.
    It was these and other similar incidents which swayed
public opinion and persuaded Emperor Martin I to sign into
law the Genetic Manipulation Act.
    Violations have and continue to occur. Both through
scientific idealism and commercial incentives. It is, in
fact, a difficult arena to police. However, no major
indiscretions have taken place and the weight of Imperial
backing to the law has kept most activity strictly legal.

FACTS OF GENETIC ENGINEERING
    In the field of Genetic Engineering, proper, existing
DNA codes are taken and spliced together into new life
forms. This can often be a long process of trial and
error. Especially when dealing with new or not completely
understood codes. This is generally best applied to tailoring
a specific species to better suit some end goal.
    For example the Bondi, the nationalistic symbol
was in danger of extinction due to the changing
biosphere of the planet. Evolution is not a fast enough
means of dealing with the often rapid changes that technology
can bring. Here, however, Genetic Scientists stepped in and
introduced changes to the lungs and respiratory systems of
the animal to cope with the changes.
    The more advanced field of Genetic Construction is
quite different. Instead of dealing with existing genetic
codes, a Genetic Engineer constructs them from the ground
up. Completely unique creatures are thus devised.
    Most evolved DNA consists and a large variety of
sequences derived randomly over time. Consequently there
are large portions of their codes that add nothing to
the organism and are completely irrelevant. Constructed
creatures, though, are much more efficiently tailored.
Extra space is sometimes used for comments or copyright
notices but often even the most complicated constructed
organism seldom has more than 4 or 6 chromosomes.
    This fact actually makes it very easy to identify
organisms that have been constructed rather than
evolved. Their origin is quite evident through simple
genetic analysis or often even a microscope. This 
specificity, though, limits the variety. If a constructed
organism is given the ability for self reproduction
the amount of parameters that can vary is quite limited.
There is not the tolerance for random change built into
evolved life. Consequently constructed creatures, left
in a natural environment, seldom evolve further or
mutate and are very susceptible to diseases or changes
that were not engineered into them.
    This, though, has its benefits. Often an organism
or creature can be created to fulfil a certain purpose
or else produce a certain results. Then, when it detects
that it has accomplished its goals, it dies, or ceases
to reproduce.

GENETIC ENGINEERING TODAY
    There are a number of areas where Genetic Engineering
comes to the fore in the Imperial sphere. As previously
mentioned biosphere construction has enabled the colonisation
of previously uninhabited worlds. This has caused contention
in some groups where previous species have been eliminated
by the new constructs.
    The Ubedewi Iceworm was an early successful and popular
construct. It can live in temperatures near absolute zero
by adsorbing any and all radiant energy. Ice worlds can be
seeded with them and, slowly, over time their albedo can
be shifted.
    Biological organisms can be an advantage over more mundane
constructs in certain situations. They can work, sometimes
much more intricately than machines, and usually possess the
capability of self-repair and often self-propagation. Most
people are familiar with Grassfalt (tm) which often appears
on space stations. This is genetically engineered turf that
is tough, resilient and beneficial to artificial atmospheres.
    Another interesting example are the varieties of painting
slugs on the market. Their diet consists of paint and they
have a built in compulsion toward symmetry. Given a blank
wall they will cover it with intricate designs. These expand
over the available surface area and then double back forming
an ever changing tableau of art.
    Scientific interests aside, genetic engineering has been
used in the entertainment and leisure markets. Many exotic
and unusual lifeforms have been discovered on a variety of
worlds. Through genetic engineering, it has been possible
to domesticise and adapt these interesting creatures with
temperaments and habits that make them suitable pets.
    A species of Feeweegro Tree Frog with a particularly
melodious mating call was engineered and given a predilection
for harmony. Two or more Harmonisers together will "sing"
in counterpoint to each other in an ever changing melody
taking as inspiration incidental sounds in their environment.
Snatches of conversation, ringing phones, even construction
work can be pleasantly accompanied if a quartet of Harmonisers
is present.
    In the field of genetic construction creatures are not
limited to nature. All realms of fantastic and mythological
creatures can exist in reality. From living and animated
stoles, to the conspicuous consumptive show pieces of evening
suits made entirely of butterflies and sprites, the range
is too diverse to cover here.
    Although the law restricts the use of human DNA, it does
not prevent the use of other primate DNA or constructs designed
to look as human as possible. These range from decorative
garden cherubs to robot-like heavy labourers for mine work
to specialised "escort girls". Although engineered to react
in as near human a fashion as possible, legally these are
still animals and have no rights other than what locally
passes as animal rights.
    Needless to say moralists on many worlds object to the
more human like constructs on ethical grounds. This has
proven to be an extremely grey area, legally, though. The
Empire does, however, support an Office of Sentiency. They
administer special exams upon request to "potential sentients".
If they pass they are immediately declared sentient individuals
and given all rights and accords due.
    As the subsequent litigation by the newly declared sentient
against their previous creators or owners can be complex
most genetic construction agencies are careful to produce
constructs a fair safety margin below the usual limits. There
are shady businesses that deal much closer to the limit for
commensurate prices, but, fortunately, they are the exception.

    The history of Genetic Engineering in the Imperium has
been a wide and varied one. This article can only serve to
give an overview and we encourage the interested reader to
follow their own references.

ADVENTURES:

77. Mobster, Payoff
    Having conducted some dubious work for an in-system
criminal organisation the players go to a rendezvous
point for the payoff. Instead of the 30,000Cr they were
promised they find a small child clutching a shoebox.
She has fair skin, long crimped silver hair, wears a
silver lace dress, and has solid silver eyes. The shoebox
contains 10,000Cr and a note from the mobsters indicating
that the remainder of the payment is "in kind" and consists
of the genetically engineered plaything.
    Her license is in the box and indicates that she is
down as genetically engineered chimp stock although
anyone with admin-1 will suspect the license. A medical
examination shows she appears to be the victim of severe
mental and (non-damaging) physical abuse.

1-2: All is as appears but the license is a forgery. Players
     may adopt her or sell her for 100,000Cr on the Black
     Market.
3-4: As is (1) but a detailed genetic analysis shows that she
     has some human DNA in her.
5:   She is not a genetic alterant at all. She is a cosmetically
     engineered child of a nearby noble. She was being held for
     ransom by the mobsters but the noble refused to pay. Her
     memory has been hypnotically repressed.
6:   The "child" is a genetically constructed hit-man for the
     mob. She has become a little too well know and wants out
     of the vicinity. She will happily play along. She will
     later escape from the adventurers or else blackmail
     whoever she is sold to.

78. Noble, Vendetta
    The characters are approached by the representatives of
a Noble who indicate that they have a job for those with good
investigative skill and a desire for justice. If they are
interested they will be ushered to a meeting in a grav-limo.
    The Noble says there is another noble on a nearby world
who wronged her in the past and who she owes one to. She says
that no noble is a paragon of virtue. Each evades justice to
a greater or lesser degree, but now is the time for justice
to catch up with her nemesis.
    Based on some follow up work on an off hand comment made
some years ago, she has discovered that one academic institute
he has been funding is unofficially involved in genetic
research. She wishes them to investigate further and expose
whatever is being hidden.

1: The Noble is the subject of a genetic weakness due to
   many years of inbreeding. He is funding research into
   a drug to mitigate the effects and to ensure it is not
   inheritable.
2: As above but this is really just a cover for an attempt
   to clone him without the defect. Research is beginning
   in how to enact a memory transfer to the new cone.
3: As in (2) except the memory transfer is due to take place
   in 3 weeks. Plans are in place for him to "die" and pass
   his inheritance on.
4: As in (2) except the memory transfer has already taken
   place. However the new clone has escaped and is now
   actively plotting the death of its progenitor.
5: The institute is researching a genetically enhanced version
   of the Noble. It is designed for optimum physical performance
   and utmost loyalty to its progenitor. He plans a revolution
   on the world with himself as the head.
6: As (5) except industrial cloning of the replicant is already
   underway.

79. Refugee, Escape
    While on an insystem transfer the player\'s ship detects
a light grav-van on a course near their vector. Depending
on how it may have manoeuvred it could have come from any
of three locations. However, given the design, a popular
one in this system, it is impossible for it to have enough
fuel to get back anywhere.
    Hailing it will produce no results but if they physically
approach it and look through the windscreen they will see
a woman on the other side. She will respond to them but
is obviously unfamiliar with the controls and will have to
be talked through everything.
    When rescued she will say her name is Mlini and she will
say she is fleeing a local industrialist claiming to be her
husband. She will offer the characters 10,000Cr to take her
out of the system. If they seem hesitant she will double the
offer.
    If the players take her up she will confess, once in jump,
that she really has no money. She will appeal to them to
let her work for her passage. After some time the characters
may notice a few odd things. She appears physically perfect,
intelligent and naturally sophisticated. However her knowledge
of the world in general seems particularly lacking. (She has
a UCP of FFFF2A)

1: Mlini is a genetic replicant of the Industrialist\'s late
   wife. He is very keen to get her back and will send a
   detective with an open cheque book to return her.
2: Mlini is an illegal genetic alterant, tailored for the
   pleasure of the industrialist. He will attempt to
   retrieve her as in (1).
3: A sister company sent the industrialist Mlini as a
   present. In reality she is a genetic construct commissioned
   by a rival firm. Consciously she is completely naive and
   innocent. However, at pre-programmed times a subconscious
   "split personality" takes over and she becomes an RNA
   trained espionage agent. This form activated,
   stole some important documents but accidentally
   got switched off during escape. The industrialist will
   attempt to recover her as in (1) but additionally
   so will the rival firm.
4: As in (3) except the subconscious personality will
   awaken 1D days into jump. She will attempt to take
   over the ship. Subsequent events should be determined
   by the referee.
5: Mlini is a genetically engineered experimental fashion
   toy, given to be tried out by a favoured customer.
   Unfortunately the model turned out a little too
   wilful and the customer a little too inept. Alas,
   though, he has fallen in love and will pursue her
   to woo her himself, possibly revealing her origin.
6: As in (4) except the company who produced her will
   send 2 assassins to kill her and dispose of the
   evidence. They will eliminate the industrialist too
   if he talks too much.

80. Civil Servant, Assassination
    While passing through a Company/Corporation owned
world the characters will be approach by a company
official. He will offer them 100,000Cr to track down
and kill some dangerous animals. If they are interested
they will be given a non-disclosure agreement to sign
and a briefing room to report to.
    Another official will inform them that one of the
products the company produces is gentically constructed
fighting automatons for sale to high calibur mercenary
brigades and world governments. Unfortunately four of
these have broken their training and have escaped to
the planet.
    Their current whereabouts and intentions are unknown.
They are close to their genetically programmed shutdown
date and, if they are aware of this, are likely to be
desperate. Their mission is to seek out and put down
the automatons.

1: The automatons are highly skilled and trained fighting
   troops. They are attempting to cause as much physical
   damage as possible on the company in revenge for their
   slavery.
2: As (1) except they are trying to find the genius who
   created them and force him to engineer an extension to
   their life span.
3: The automatons are unarmed but still have lightning
   reflexes and killer instincts. They plan to break into
   a training lab and "liberate" their "comrades" destined
   for slavery.
4: The atuomatons are, in fact, normal human mercenaries
   who have been brainwashed into beleiving they are
   constructs. A anti-genetics organisation has perpretrated
   this in order to embarass the company.
5: The "escape" of the automatons is just a cover. They are
   really on a penetration mission by one of the purchasing
   mercenary guilds to attempt to take the president of

Two comments.  First, is the ommission of the Gene War (Solomani & Aslan,

explains a great deal about the attitude toward genetic alterations

Second, I enjoyed the adventure seeds, but the last one was rather too

I thought that I could also drop a few comments, drawing from my past
service in the Italian Army which is currently following rather standard
NATO concepts and schemes.

1- As it has been suggested already, strategic and perhaps high level tactics

ideas can be drawn from the past, but these old lessons are, in my opionion, 
often only little more than commonsense. 
The low level tactical implementation of operations relies very much on the 
detailed characteristics of the tools at hand. If one looks at the Falkland\'s

war, which is probably more relevant to mercenary tickets than the Gulf war, 
there have been occasions where a single SBS forward observer would
effectively
neutralize a battery or a company simply by directing shipboard gunfire. 
Neither Sun Tzu nor von Clausewitz could have expected that. 
It is very challenging to try and understand what the various Traveller 
technologies would do to ground combat.

2- NATO officers were trained in the dangerous art of "fighting by the book".

NATO doctrine was prepared on how to use in battle the standard NATO unit 
types. If applied without judgement such a conduct could cause defeat even 
against a lower TL opponent, provided he is smarter (which in the Gulf War 
wasn\'t the case). Actually the NATO pursuit of efficient C^3, is probably
based on the idea that only through high tech one could open up new 
strategic and tactical possibilities.

3- Logistics will get more and more difficult. I am sure that in many 
situations one will be better off with some weapons that do not require bulky
ordnance. Sometimes it will be easier to maintain FGMPs than find new 
cartridges. The F117s during the Gulf War, just to make one example, 
dropped bombs for several times their weight...I would expect that in the 
average interstellar campaign supply will be at least as important as in the 
North Africa during WWII.

If there is really a serious intention to work on a manual of military
tactics I would be happy to join! (btw I do not have Striker, is there a
way to get hold of one copy?)

Hi everyone! First post from a long time lurker...

Jo - just saw your post on genetic engineering.
Genetic engineering is one of the areas of Traveller that IMO is 
extremely underdeveloped. It is one of the fastest moving areas of 
scientific research today, but almost no mention is made of it in any 
Traveller material. IMO genetic technology will shape future societies at 
least as much as computing or even star travel.

While I think it is great to get Ref\'s to consider genetic ideas, under 
your Genetic Manipulation Act of 194 the Third Imperium would actually be 
banning much of the research we do today. More work is done on human 
genes that those of any other species. To ban the manipulation of human 
DNA would prevent scientists from using the most powerful methods they 
have for curing disease.

Human DNA is copied and cloned to produce artificial enzyme replacements 
that are identical to the natural products. Human growth hormone, 
insulin, and blood clotting agents are already produced in this way, and 
the Human Genome Project hopes to allow far more disorders to be cured in 
this way. 

At the limit of current technology is gene therapy, where therapeutic genes 
are directly inserted into diseased cells using a modified virus. At the 
moment experiments have only been partially successful (and yes, some of 
these experiments have been on humans), but it is seen as a very 
promising technology that will be ready in a decade or two. Of course, at 
the moment there is no legal precedent to say what you can and cannot 
insert. You don\'t have to insert a disease curing gene. For example an 
army might make its troops resistant to biological warfare agents, or 
parents may choose to have higher intelligence for their children. This 
is still fantasy at the moment, but the possibility will be with us A 
LONG TIME before the 57th century.

Currently, genetics is moving faster than the law. You may have read 
about the wrangles the European Patent Office has been going through with 
researchers (usually corporate ones) trying to patent human genes. Many 
of them have been allowed to. The European Parliament is still arguing 
about whether it should be allowed. 

Some of the ideas you gave I thought were great, especially the \'painting 
slugs\'. As for disallowing the manipulation of Human DNA, cloning is 
common in MT (doesn\'t Strephon himself have a clone?) and I remember an old 
White Dwarf article way back giving ideas for cloning, transplants, memory 
transfers etc for CT. I quite agree that there will be tough legislation 
concerning what and what isn\'t allowed, but IMO it would be more along 
the lines of disallowing the modification of certain traits (eg those 
affecting personality, although these may be used to rehabilitate criminals).

As for genetically engineered species, they will certainly contain less 
genetic variation than any natural one, but natural selection would still 
have an effect once some of the DNA changed (either through mutation or 
errors in replication), and some artificial species may well be 
constructed to allow evolution to take place (eg by giving it plenty of 
\'junk\' DNA, a short generation time, and redundant copies of many essential 
genes, so that if a mutation renders it non-functional then a spare copy is 
present to ensure the individual survives)

Other artificial species I can think of: microbes to clean 
your teeth, dustbins that consume the rubbish put into them, and an 
extention of the terraforming worms might be organisms that help convert 
the atmosphere into one more suitable for settlement. 

The adventure seeds were great. An idea of my own...

The players are hired by some covert operatives from a balkanised 
world. They want the players to steel genetic technology from a rival 
country that they believe it is usiong to develop biological warfare 
agents. 

1) On infiltrating the research lab the players manage to capture samples 
of viral strains being developed for an upcoming offensive. Great care 
will have to be taken on their escape to ensure the virus is no released 
into the atmosphere (dodge those bullets...).

2) The biological agent is actually a bacteria that excretes strong acid 
as a by-product of respiration. Reactive metals (ie what most 
of the lightweight alloys that weapons, starships etc are made out of) 
are corroded by the bacteria. Inadvertantly one of the players carries 
some onto their ship... 

Hope this was interesting. As I said before, raising awareness of the 
genetic technology that will be present in thousands of years time I 
consider is very important to getting the \'feel\' of what the far future 
would be like. Many people don\'t seem to be aware of what we can actually 
do today.

Thanks for listening.

Jules.

     I found this very interesting in light of events that occurred in my 
     current Traveller campaign.  I just completed refereeing a mercenary 
     adventure in which a Broadsword Merc Cruiser-equipped team of 
     mercenaries were sent to a backwater system to liberate it from a 
     squadron of vargr corsairs.  One of the issues that came up was 
     gaining control of close orbit.
     
     I was surprised at the strategy my players took.  They got the 
     corsairs\' attention by attacking several of the strategic points on 
     the main world and drew two corsairs into orbit.  Once they did, the 
     merc cruiser managed to disable one of them before either corsair 
     could even detect the presence of the Broadsword.
     
     The mercs quickly took control of close orbit airspace and the vargr 
     had to sue for peace.  Though I really wanted more "big gun" action in 
     my adventure, I had to realize the vargr had no recourse but to 
     negotiate for peace once they had lost dominance of close orbit and in 
     fact, their very method of getting back home was threatened.  
     Otherwise, the mercs could have placed a forward observer in the hills 
     and just started calling in a hail of shots from space to blast the 
     corsairs to pieces.
     
     Thanks for the interesting observations, Mr. Stiavelli.  If you\'ve got 
     more ideas, please share them.  As a person without military 
     experience trying to conduct a military campaign, any such advice is 
     welcome.

2. thanks for your input Max !  I think you have touched upon two key issues
in 
future warfare command, communications and control (or C3) and logistics.  
NATO\'s pursuit of advanced C3  is driven to an extent by US developments in
the 
field and their perceptions of the need for battle management capabilities in

the 21st century, as part of the project known as \'force XXI\'.  For
Traveller, 
the key in the 57th century will possibly be one of electronic offense vs. 
defence.  battle computers etc. will facilitate excellent knowledge of enemy 
dispositions, but defensive measures will still seek to confound these
systems.  
Though often perceived as an example of perfect intelligence, the Gulf war of

1991 saw the coalition forces working with much sketchier intelligence once
the 
ground war started as you are probably aware.  Iraqi republican guard units
were 
often sighted 50km+ from where they were meant to be...  I personally see
tech 
level advantage in electronics, sensors etc. as being near vital - in the
field 
of personal arms, I am still not completely convinced.  Guass weapons may
have 
higher magazine loads, but what about your second key - logistics.
	The coalition relied upon a very high-tech (relatively speaking) 
logistics machine which quite possibly could have collapsed had the war 
continued.  As troops become higher and higher tech, the need for effective
and 
timely logictics support becomes increasingly crucial.  Many mercenary
players 
forget the need for an effective logistics back-up, whilst focusing on battle

dress etc. and could come a cropper if not careful.  Perhaps Max you have
some 
comments to add to these....

3. Generation vessels.  In digest 274 Shalom Zaidfeld (?) asked about designs

for said ships.  Apologies again as my copy of high guard is not with me, but

these are some of the characteristics I would imagine;
 a.Streamlined hull configuration - have it land on the colony planet and act
as 
a hub for the colony rather than have shuttles etc. to transfer colonists
down.
 
b.possibly 2G max acceleration. Solar cells. Power plant. No Jump. Lots of
fuel 
for power plant however. No need for purification (unless desired for ops. at

destination).

c. Crew: either robots which awaken crew (disproportionate numbers of medical

personnel) as necessary or skeleton crew alive (tech level dependent I
suppose) 
to monitor ship.  Will require more living space than normal to maintain
sanity.

d. Cargo: colonists in low berths. Cargo - genetic samples frozen of plants, 
animals etc. many advance bases. construction equipment. vehicles. food
stuffs 
for first year(s) on world. communications gear. medical laboratories. maybe 
even industrial factories ready to be sited.  engineers explosives. firearms
for 
self-defence.  holo-crystals or CD-ROMs with infromation - cultural,
technical 
etc. on.  several medical bays for recussitation of colonists upon de-frost.

Depending on tech level I would reckon maybe a hull in the region of
20-30,000 
tons (?)

I would appreciate comments or designs using none, some, all of the criteria 
(Challenge of the day !)

    Still?  I\'m sure glad that we have never quite fallen into that trap.
And that when we got close to falling into that trap, a war came along to
disabuse us of the notion.  "American Officers not only do not fight by
their \'Book\', but most have not even read it."  (attributed to some

    I can understand that, given the experiences of this century.  Technology
has done a LOT to change war, and is a lot easier to work with than the
"insane insights" that are the other major factor for tactical changes.

    Quite so.

    There are two subjects that I don\'t cover in my article
at all: "Genetic Surgery" and "Cloning". My definitions of these:
    Genetic Surgery: Creating tailored microbes to go in and
alter the genes in existing cells of a living organism. (Would
"Gene Therapy" be a better term?)
    Cloning: Creating exact copies of exiting organisms.
    The "Genetic Manipulation Act, 194" is not meant to prevent
the former. True, you could not, in theory, clone bits of the Human
DNA to produce stuff but you could construct DNA strands that do
the same thing. There is no ban on introducing alterant DNA strands
to a living organism, human included.
    This doesn\'t prevent the work and research being done, it just
moves it from the field of Genetic Manipulation to Genetic Construction.
Not a problem for planets that have reached the TL for Contstruction.
Maybe we\'re seeing the commercial backing by the Core Higher Tech
worlds for the GMA, 194 :-).
    Cloning is not covered by the act at all. Planets already have
a wide diversity on the outlook of cloning. Some have all of their
citizens cloned and raised communally (al la Paranoia), others
consider it morally evil. The only things prevented by The Act is
the tampering of the DNA of the clones before they are born.



>As for genetically engineered species, they will certainly

    It seems to me that Genetic Constructs are not going to
do well with any change, mutation or error. If you compare
DNA to a computer program. Natural DNA is like a huge (LISP?)
program with lots of junk and replication all over. If a
bit of the program gets corrupted (mutated) it is unlikely
to destroy things. Occasionally a corruption might produce
a beneficial side effect (Oh, I *like* that new colour). This
is evolution.
    A Genetic Construct, though, is like a computer program
that has been optimised, EXEPACKed and runs as a self-extracting
ZIP file :-). If even a bit is changed it is most likely to
completely blow the program out of the water. In extremely rare
circumstances it will not have a harmful effect, and in 
very very rare cases it might be a benefit.
    If this is a true analogy, my argument is that a Construct
is going to be much less likely to get a beneficial mutation.
So evolotion of them is going to be a long, long, process.
Perhaps the Imperium has studied this using the Vargr as
examples. How much are the constructs and how much are they
manipulations? How much have they evolved since creation?

    Some of the players in my campaign have "caught" something
called a "bio-suppresant virus". This lives in symbiosys with
your body. Sort of like a super-charger. It can much more successfully
extract poisons from your blood stream (like alcohol), store
energy for later release, fight disease, etc, etc. The effects
have been a raise in endurance and a faster healing rate (also
almost limitless longevity but it will be a while before they
figure that one out :-).
    TL 21 stuff, but from what I understand, possible.

Well, if you absolutely don\'t get any fun out of tabletop wargaming, then
an abstract system is best. Otherwise it is quite possible to combine war-
gaming and roleplaying and to let one enhance the enjoyment of the other. 
I fondly remember an old fantasy campaign where the Ref ran both roleplaying 
sessions and tabletop wargaming. Our RP characters were adventurers who had 
bought captaincies in defunct regiments  -  regiments without men. We spent 
our time on quests to enhance our reputation (to attract men), we did 
favours for high noblemen to get them to persuade the king to reactivate the 
regiments, we scrambled to hire the 120 men it took to avoid deactivation 
next muster day, we worked harder to get more men so that we could provide 
our henchmen with suitable commissions and still harder to get the money
to buy colonelcies in our own regiments once they had grown big enough to
warrant a colonel and to avoid some rich twits buying them and taking over 
the fruit of all our hard work.
And then one day we were invited to a tabletop session and were informed
that _those_ 20 figures over there represented my regiment and _those_
over there represented my friend\'s. Believe me, it adds a whole new
dimension to a wargame when you know and care for those small lead figures!

Yes, gene therapy is what we call it today, but the term \'therapy\' might 
be a bit misleading by Traveller times when many of the alterations might 
not be therapeutic, but just cosmetic, or enhancement of already healthy 
traits (intelligence, stature, etc).

I get your point. TL8 is the start of the genetic revolution, when humans 
are first able to clone, sequence, and cut DNA, leading to a number of 
important diagnostic and therapeutic methods.
 
By TL9 gene therapy is common for a number of diseases, 
and by TL10 it would be simpler to construct artificial DNA from 
scratch rather than cloning it from sequences of human DNA (as you don\'t 
need the piece of human DNA to start with). Of course, if you are working 
from unknown spequences, you still need to have some original DNA to clone.

Construction of simple artificial organisms would be about TL10 IMO,ie 
taylored microbes and viruses that immunise, cure, or alter some other 
aspect of their host. By TL11 technology would move on to simple 
multi-cellular organisms, which could be large but have a uniform 
composition (eg Grassfelt (TM) <sp?>to clean up your ship).
At TL11 the first complex organisms would appear, in order to make new 
worlds suitable for colonisation, as pets, sport, and even game animals 
(a la the genetically altered polar bears that the Prince Regent has a 
scrape with in Elite 3: FFE), or to replace endangered species on certain 
planets.

Why ban the alteration of a clone\'s DNA before it is born, when it can 
then use gene therapy once it is alive? To alter the DNA while it is only 
a zygote (ie just a few cells) you save yourself a HUGE amount of time 
and effort, as you only have to modify the DNA of a few cells rather than 
the trillions that make up an adult. I fail to see the difference between 
the modification of DNA before or after \'birth\'. 

The same argument goes for gene therapy itself. If a culture will accept 
organ transplants as ethical, then logically it must consider gene 
therapy as ethically sound, as they both involve the insertion of foreign DNA
into the host (the organ is, after all, merely an expression of the DNA
it contains).

For manufacturing complex organisms, why start from scratch when nature 
has already done millions of years of work for you? Take the natural DNA 
of a well known species and insert the genes you want to make your new 
organism out of. IMO this is what the Ancients would have done with the 
Vargr. BTW, I imaginf the Vargr were a hot topic for genetic research 
(whether they liked it or not) once it was realised that they were an 
artificial species. By first contact with humaniti (First Imperium?), 
TL11 humans would be dying to get their hands on the results of that sort 
of technology - they could learn an awful lot. And of course the Varger 
themselves. (Hmm...interesting. Kidnapping Vargr for genetic research, 
with Sentient Rights activists trying to bomb your lab. Just a thought)

A lot sooner than TL21 IMO. Human ageing is essentially caused by two 
things (as currently believed). 1) The deactivation of \'housekeeping\' 
genes that continually run in the background to ensure cell 
multiplication, replication, differentiation etc, and 2) the gradual 
inability of DNA repair genes to combat mutations that occur within the 
lifetime of the individual, which then lead to cell death, tumors, or 
cancers. Figuring out how to sort them out would be tough, but only about 
TL13-14 tough, I think. Still, imagine what a player will do when he\'s 
400 years old and the nearest TL14 hospital is on the other side of the 
subsector when the therapeutic virus in his bloodstream gains a mutation 
and he starts to age at the rate of a year a day
(artificial viruses are already known to pick up mutations and pieces of 
DNA from thier hosts and interaction with natural viruses)

Some comments regarding the discussion of high-tech mercenary units in the
future.

Given that reliability, support, and logistics seem to be major issues with  
current battle technology, might not some of the advantages of future  
technologies be that these issues could be addressed?

With hundreds of years to refine the concept of a mercenary unit, someone
might  
come up with battle armor, weaponry, and vehicles that are high-tech, but  
self-repairing and self-supplying -- ideal for a low-tech environment.

Suppose that at some point it gets harder and harder to squeeze real  
performance gains out of certain technologies. After that, the gains should
be  
in lower energy costs, greater reliability, lower expense, and greater  
versatility.

Some ideas:

- I once read a book with short stories about high-tech armor. It included an

essay purporting to chart the development of armor over centuries. The final

result was "smart-matter" whose shape was programmable; the "armor" was the  
weapon (and sometimes a complete vehicle) as well, and could form projectiles

or beam weapons from its own mass. This idea led to some odd, comic-bookish  
images, but provided food for thought.

- "Living Armor" that regrows damage, and can glean energy from solar or  
thermal sources.  Such armor might be biological in nature or might operate  
using nanomachines, the size of microorganisms, that are constantly repairing

and rebuilding it just as our own cells work on our bodies. The armor can  
adjust itself, tailoring itself to fit any occupant over a day or two. It
might  
be made out of ceramics and metal, and could "eat" lower tech items,
processing  
them to get building materials for repairs.

- John Varley in one of his stories posited a symbiotic partner for a person

that served as a sort of living vac suit. It provided protection as well as  
companionship. It was amorphous.

- Weapons based on any of the above principles

Such equipment would help a mercenary to concentrate on strategy rather than

supply. Of course, they might also tend to change the feel and flavor of your

Traveller campaign, as these kinds of technologies would be very popular and

easy to maintain, and thus potentially widespread. However, all technologies

have their own problems -- some ideas:

- An uninhabited planet where mutated nanotech lifeforms have gone wild
- Someone reprograms your armor so that it attacks you
- A virus attacks your armor or your weapons

While from what I read, powerful and interesting nanotech isn\'t that far off,
I  
think there are some problems with these ideas in terms of play. I think many

people choose Traveller because of its hard sf feel and because of its  
militaristic bent. While the militarism isn\'t directly endangered, ideas like

this begin to change the feel of technology. It\'s not so much solid stuff
that  
sometimes breaks down; it\'s more malleable, and is more likely to mutate than

to break. I think this is more accurate, because given the current rate of  
change of technology, our world 10 or 20 years from now will be very strange
to  
us; how much more strange, then, will the universe be hundreds and hundreds
of  
years from now?  In order to adopt more powerful technologies like these and

retain some of the same feel, I\'d suggest stressing the new problems brought
up  
by the new tech, to give a sense of gritty realism.

These ideas are of course just starting points. I\'d be interested in any  
comments.  Some game books with interesting biotech are GDW\'s DarkTek  
sourcebook for the Dark Conspiracy game, and West End Games\' Space Gods  
supplement for the TORG role playing game.  I haven\'t seen any good
discussions  
of nanotech for games, and any suggestions would be much appreciated.

There is a lot that cultures should "logically" do, but we don\'t seem to be a
logical species!  Ask anyone in risk assessment about the differences between
risks and the amount of time/money spent avoiding them.  My grandfather
remembers a neighbour declaiming: "people shouldn\'t drive they should go by
train, as God intended"!

>For manufacturing complex organisms, why start from scratch when nature

I\'d say to keep the probablility of mutations low, myself.  If I\'m going to
have a geneered bug crawling around my system I want as little chance as
possible of the sucker mutating into something nasty.

What\'s the best solution is unclear. There might even be no best solution,
namely depending on the campaign the order of preference might change.
In my campaigns the Imperial Marines get the best money can buy (although I
am not sure of what that is..), while the Imperial Army is more a 
sector/subsector level organization, with each planet contributing to his own
TL
(or in any case with what THEY can buy). As a result the logistic problems
for
the Marines and the Army are rather different. The Marines rely a lot on
energy weapons since they require maintenance but no ammo. The opposite is
true for the Army. The idea is that one could always repair a broken FGMP
may be getting spare parts from the friends up in the sky. As a result the
Marines are more easily deployable without preparation but more expensive
to maintain. I am not sure how realistic this is.

>The coalition relied upon ...

Yes, indeed a long campaign could have been a problem as far as I can guess
(I was not any more in the Army during the Gulf war). Part of the problem
lies in the size and diversity of the coalition forces. In the Sharp Guard
operation in the Adriatic Sea NATO has set up a Forward Logistic Site (FLS).
All the various NATO navies concentrate their logistic flow to the FLS that
in
turns distributes supply, spare parts and even mail to the various ships.
The big advantage of this setup is that none of the Navies (possibly except
the USN) has enough ships in the area to justify a completely autonomous
logistic chain. In the Gulf probably a similar setup would have not been
convenient. Since I assume the Imperial Army to be far from homogeneous,
logistics can be a lot of fun...I would think that mobile FLS would
be required.
In some operations where various mercenary groups and planetary armies
cooperate, an FLS would probably be an important asset.

>Still? I\'m sure glad that we have never wuite fallen into that trap.

During my officer training in 1987 the Airland Battle doctrine so successful
in the Gulf was not yet really adopted by all the NATO Armies...I think
Airland Battle has been a great achievement, a book saying that you shouldn\'t
fight by the book...Also there is BIG difference in training concepts (not
only quality) between elite forces (Marines, airborne, etc) and the main 
front mechanized and armoured units.
The Gulf war was for the US, the French and, perhaps, the Brits the first 
war in years fought not only by elite troops. I was sure that any NATO army
had elite troops with the required degree of training and initiative for
that sort of actions, but I wouldn\'t have bet my money on the remaining 
forces.. And who would bet on the degree of preparation of the 
Vincennes or the Mora Imperial Army troops??

Before finishing this huge mail (sorry...) a proposal and a question:
1-perhaps we could start defining how a squad/platoon should be
equipped and then if we end up with different ideas..fight it out. Each
of us could set up a mini-wargame and test the various options. I would
see it as an Imperials against Imperials exercise. A Marines squad could
be carried on board an Empress APC (vehicle 36 in 101V) and a TL 14/15 
Imperial Army squad on an Astrin APC (33 in 101V). 

2- has anybody noticed/seen/heard about the US Army SIPE (Soldier Integrated 
Protective Ensemble Project) and AWE (Advanced Warfighting Experiment)
or the French ECAD (Equipment du combattant debarque\')? it looks like there 
will be combat environment suits with integral power supply, HUD, and IR 
chamaleon options pretty soon..

Christopher Griffen wrote about a merc scenario where close orbital 
control won the day.

This is a point I have often wondered about:
- I can find no reason to force Traveller starships to orbit a planet, if 
they are using thrusters. That is, they could "hover" (even at orbital 
height) with no long-term problem. Sure, they would need power to remain 
there, but there is no other barrier that I know of.

This means that even a poorly-equipped merc force could bring 
starship-mounted laser to bear on ground targets.

Now, I know that Striker (Mk 1) and such state that orbiting ships are only 
overhead for one-third of the time - but WHY? there is nothing in the 
rules to force this situation. It looks as though a ship could sit in one 
spot and blast everything on the ground to bits, esp. with the ridiculous 
figures given in MT for starship weaponry.

Answers, anyone?

2- NATO officers were trained in the dangerous art of "fighting by the
book".
 
 Still?  I\'m sure glad that we have never quite fallen into that trap.
And that when we got close to falling into that trap, a war came along to
disabuse us of the notion.  "American Officers not only do not fight by
their \'Book\', but most have not even read it."  (attributed to some
anonymous Soviet officer back in the bad old days of the "Cold War".

An intresting ethnocentric comment there steve.  The Soviet army relied upon
the 
book, as due to poor communications they relied on knowing what their troops 
would do in given circumstances (this includes also the indoctrinal aspect).

The American army\'s bible is known as Field Manual 100-5 and to this day
exams 
are taken on the contents so that all American army officers know the
essential 
principles distilled from history by which to conduct operations.  In wartime

commanders depending upon their relationships will be expected to follow
these 
principles.  For example in the 1991 Gulf Conflict General Franks (Commander
of 
US VII Corps - armoured formation) would tell his subordinates the outline of

hisd orders i.e. `capture point x` and then require them to work out a plan
to 
support his operation, i.e. maximum lattitude to the commander on the spot.
	However, Schwartzkopf\'s relationship with Franks was such that he grew 
incensed when Franks was not advancing at the rate he wanted - i.e. no
lattitude 
to the commander on the spot.  This has some interesting connotations for 
role-playing don\'t you think....
	In summary whilst American and hopefully Traveller Mercenary commanders 
have the initiative to take advantage of weak spots in an enemies plan at a 
tactical level, and abuse them further at strategic level - remember every 
military has some kind of book from which to create a level understanding of
how 
the country, planet, imperium will fight, whether it be the latest
incarnation 
of field manual 100-5 or Imperial Marine Corps Manual 500-74..

The Imperium might be faced with a military problem in avoiding genetic 
research, in that the Solomani or Sword Worlds or whoever could threaten 
the Imperium with a biological agent against which it has no defense. 
Given that the Solomani are so proficient at things biological, the 
Imperium may well have trouble keeping up even if it did try. Solomani 
and Aslan mentions whole geneered human sub-races, some of which sound 
quite repugnant... Such an individual would probably have to contact 
smugglers to enter the Imperium, under the suggested Imperial Law.

The present problem with the Ebola (sp?) virus is an example of a 
threat. If it were more contagious, the human race would be in big 
trouble at the moment (if they let it spread any further, big trouble 
may yet happen).  There are other examples too, such as the growing 
incidence of cerebral malaria in South East Asia at the moment (spread 
by mosquitoes rather than contact with infected people, as with Ebola).

It is possible that there are secret Imperial military biological 
research stations (from which, naturally, things occasionally escape or 
are accidentally released), to attempt to defend against such threats.

I heard part of a story on a recent Australian radio science program 
that digestion weakens the effect of some pharmaceuticals (these enter 
the body via the gut, so they have to get through the stomach first). 
Some scientists are trying to get pharmaceuticals into plants which pass 
through the stomach (maize/corn being an example, I suppose), so that 
smaller amounts are needed to produce the same effect in the body. Such 
plants could be the object of a Safari Ship style adventure or an 
interesting cargo that not all worlds would accept.

Finally, here is the draft of a genetically engineered lifeform, 
designed for the Yiklerzdanzh sector, but can be transplanted.

Player Information

Gibbers are artificial lifeforms produced by the Carillon Harmonies, for 
sale to the mass market as living translators (cost Cr 4000). They 
appear to be based on omnivore gatherer stock, probably based on a marsh 
dwelling creature. They are short, squat creatures, with a large head 
mounted directly on the shoulders, bearing large multi-faceted eyes that 
are further apart than normal, large bat-like ears and a broad nose. 
Gibbers have sexual organs, but all gibbers sold to the mass market 
appear to be infertile.

Although Gibbers can fend for themselves in the wild after a fashion, 
they prefer to be fed. If one is fed by only one person for about a 
week, an emotional bond forms and the gibber will translate for that 
person, whenever held by the hand. They can eat virtually any type of 
food, and will be quite happy as long as the owner feeds them regularly, 
pays them attention from time to time and combs its fur. When left to 
their own devices, they scamper about and gibber to themselves, 
explaining their name.

Being alive, Gibbers are superior to mechanical translators in that they 
can note the emotional and body language content of a conversation, as 
well as spoken words. Gibbers can be pre-programmed with any language, 
but the ones sold on the open market have assets of Carillon-17, 
Galanglic-17, Zhodane-16, Talpaku-16 and SUraak-6. Individuals vary 
slightly in skill.

Referee Information

Some Gibbers have been transported via low-berth to the Regency by 
merchants, where they sell for approximately Cr 7500. It is believed 
that the local Regency ambassador has purchased a full hundred, for 
trial by the Regency Scout and Diplomatic services. It is believed that 
the Gibbers sent have assets of Aslan-12 and Gvegh-10.

Gibbers cannot be easily cloned, due to unusual treatments that are 
needed in utero (artificial or otherwise) that the Carillon keep secret.

Referees should ensure that each Gibber has a quirk of some sort, but 
this will not normally be minor.  About 1 in 6 have a more significant 
quirk, such as the following. These should only appear when triggered by 
something, such as when a food that the particular specimen dislikes, 
when not paid enough attention or in the presence of certain emotions.

(1) Loss of toilet training
(2) Exudes a smell found awful by one or more races
(3) Limited understanding of what not to say
(4) Poor understanding of slang (which the Carillon do not use), hence 
employing it when inappropriate and vice versa.
(5) No understanding of poetic speech (e.g. "Your hair is like a 
laughing brook, rippling in the breeze" becomes "Wanna f**k")
(6) Uses baby talk ("what an ickle sweet little Zhodani you are! Daddy 
get you a loll-loll!")
(7) Deliberately mistranslates

To quantify the logistic needs of a medium-high TL campaign I have started 
considering a Sword World TL11 unit (safely below the TL of PGMP,FGMP).

BEGIN handwaving:

Each squad is on a TL11 Masala APC. 2400 ACR rounds are fired each
day, 10 MRL10 and 10 vanilla SAM (5 l, 10 kg each). The 3cm autocannon
fires 1000 rounds per day (5 turns at ROF 200). Personnel requires 5 l/5kg
per day (generous, but we italians like good food..).

3 squads plus 1 8 cm mortar firing 210 rounds per day (5 turns at ROF 42).

3 platoons plus 2 12cm mortars firing 270 rouds (5 turns at ROF 27) and
2 VRF (5 turns at ROF 1000) make a mechanized company.

3 mechanized companies plus a tank company (similar to the above but
with Gram tanks) plus 1 support battery on 4 20cm MD (5 turns at ROF 121,
max at TL 11) make a mechanized reinforced battalion (a combat group).

Each of these at the rates of fire described above would need
407 kl and 369 tons of supply per day. It is not unconceivable that the
peak ammo use could exceed those given above by a factor 10.
After all everything is assumed to fire only for 5 turns a day..

A division fielding 9 such groups (a mechanized NATO division would probably
field only 6 such groups but..) ends up needing 3663 kl and 3318 tons per
day.

Fuel requirements would be an additional 5.6 kl per btn (50 per division).

As a comparison the btn is equipped with 55 APC and 15 tanks ie
945 kl of vehicles and 6185 tons. In terms of volume, two "typical" days of
combat operations require as much cargo capacity as the initial deployment.

Actually, I have neglected other equipment, support units, and vehicles for
the 
MDs and heavy stuff that increase the deployment volume requirement, on the 
other hand I have also neglected spare parts which may end up requiring
between 
1 and 5 per cent per day of the volume of deployed equipment.

By assuming that each "elementary" component has a medium time between
failures of 5000 hrs. The chance of it breaking in a day is 0.16 per cent
(assuming it is in use only 8 hrs). I count 32 components in the Gram and
15 in the Masala. The chance of something breaking in a single day is 5
and 2.4 per cent respectively. Translating into spare parts volumes of
about 0.1 kl per vehicle. This is roughly 0.15 per cent of the vehicle 
volume per day.
HOWEVER, the opponent often tries his best to increase the damage..thus I
think that the 1 to 5 per cent given above is reasonable.

END handwaving....

Summarizing ammo supply is likely the worst problem for Armies equipped with
high ROF weapons (e.g. TL8 MRLS..), spare parts and fuel follow. Depending
on conflict intensity, daily  supply requirements may range from few percent
to
several times (!) the deployed volume.

Before something like this can be tried at TL14/15 we should try to
agree on a few rules..It is not unlikely that the use of energy weapons
at TL14/15 combined with the self-repairing technologies mentioned by Aaron 
on xboat digest 277 would reduce significantly any logistic problem. What
I do not know is whether this is realistic and desirable for the RPG
viewpoint.

277:

"In my campaigns the Imperial Marines get the best money can buy (although I
am 
not sure of what that is..), while the Imperial Army is more a
sector/subsector 
level organization, with each planet contributing to his own TL (or in any
case 
with what THEY can buy)."

I had not considered this idea. By using the Marines as a high-tech "fire 
brigade" jumping around to quell fires, and having Imperial Army forces as an

international/national guard type formation is a nice dellineation of duties.

Is this in any way based upon the Fifth Frontier War game (which I have never

seen).  In a copy of JTAS (10 - 12 ish) I remember an article calculating
number 
of military forces available  to a planet in support of this board game.
 
"Since I assume the Imperial Army to be far from homogeneous, logistics can
be a 
lot of fun...I would think that mobile FLS would be required. In some
operations 
where various mercenary groups and planetary armies cooperate, an FLS would 
probably be an important asset."

Desert Storm had its airlift equivalent known as the \'desert express\' which
flew 
a horrendous amount of logistics to the Gulf along with surface ships.  As an

indication of the logistics needed for the campaign, the coalition aircraft
used 
some 125 million gallons of fuel, troops required 30 million meals
stockpiling 
before the start of the ground offensive, 36 million gallons of fuel and
115,000 
tons of ammunition. 

"has anybody noticed/seen/heard about the US Army SIPE (Soldier Integrated 
Protective Ensemble Project) and AWE (Advanced Warfighting Experiment) or the

French ECAD (Equipment du combattant debarque\')? it looks like there will be 
combat environment suits with integral power supply, HUD, and IR chamaleon 
options pretty soon.."

I have heard odds and sods about AWE, and there is a World Wide Web site at
Fort 
Knox (US Army Armour School) - Key menu WWW.Army.Mil.  But the AWE site is
under 
construction.  The SIPE initiative was discussed in Armed Forces Journal 
International (I believe), but I have heard nothing about ECAD.  How about
brief 
descriptions, and a journal/periodical reference (especially ECAD)....

There you have it!  Any of you who are playing currently, but haven\'t
sent in a response, please do so - I\'ll be starting to do data edits
and produce some useful statistics over the next months or so (so
that\'s about how long you still have to return a response).  The biggest
effort here will be to insert unknown/non-respondent values into the
data fields, so that crosstabulations are possible (so I can answer
questions like "What\'s the most popular background for T:TNE players?").

Watch this space for further information.  :-)

While the number of people using the T:TNE rules isn\'t suprising, the
number who are playing in a Classic Traveller background is!  It is
clearly the most popular campaign background choice, even if all
three of the New Era campaigns are lumped into one category.

The "If I were running GDW" department:
  Given the above numbers (which were rather suprizing to me), and
  the large quantity of existing Classic Traveller background
  material accessable to GDW, a _We Have Always Been As We Are_ 
  Classic Traveller sourcebook for T:TNE might be the best choice
  for a new T:TNE product.  (some of you may remember Mike suggesting
  this title for such a book a while back).  How about it, Loren?

I should also note that most of the respondents refereed at least one game,
and so are much more likley to purchase suppliements and adventure modules
than the average T:TNE player.

Actually I have not seen FFW either..from what I know about it, that scheme
should not be too far off. After writing my post in Digest 277, I found that
in Digest 12 there was a post by Mark Urbin with similar ideas on how
the Imperial Army could function. Mark was suggesting something not as
loose as my proposal though.

>..I have heard nothing about ECAD.  How about brief
>descriptions, and a journal/periodical reference (especially ECAD)....

I cannot find again the precise reference, I think that the Monch group
publication Military Technology had something on it this fall/winter,
probably in the issue on Eurosatory.

The French defense ministry wanted to address the following: NBC protection,
ballistic protection, individual basic environment, fire control,
communication

The ideas were/are tested at the Montepellier Infantry School. Most of the
developments would be in the helmet which would include HUD, GPS,
integral commo, two intensified TV cameras, integral laser
telemeter/targeting
and anti-laser protection. In addition they would try to improve the aiming
on the FAMAS 5.56mm combat rifle (with the help of the above integral laser
targeting). Sounds like 2300AD, doesn\'t it?

As far as I know two pools of french industries are working on it
the GECAD lead by GIAT and the EIC lead by Thomson-CSF. Apparently there have
been also contacts with the UK to start a possible European initiative.

There seems no reason why you can\'t sit above the target and pound the 
ground (at least under my rules).  However, you are a sitting target for 
any anti-spacecraft weapons or orbital defence forces.  If your in orbit, 
at least you can change it fairly easily, and especially when out of

Surely this isn\'t genetic engineering of human DNA, but biological 
engineering of human volunteers.  However, there is _another_ piece of 
canonical background in MTJ3, regarding the Jonkeereen, to qoute:

"Though Imperial attitudes were very wary of altering the human genome, 
several different projects were begun under the Imperial Ministry of 
Colonization.  Their goal was to produce human colonists suited for 
envirnoments which would otherwise seem inhospitable.  One of th emost 
successful of these projects was the Jonkeereen"

The article goes on to say that the Jonkeereen project was started in the 
500s, in an attempt to "limit Suerrat expansion".  This project used 
geneered humans for the ends of the government, military, and SuSAG (who 
were given the development contract), with little concern for the 
individuals involved.  Eventually, the need for the project dissappeared, 
and the Jonkeereen were left to fend for themselves on the world on which 
they were developed (Jonkeer in Deneb sector).

If this article is taken as canonical (I\'m not sure DGPs products are, 
but they are used in my campaign as such), then this clearly clashes with 
Jo\'s post.  However, it can be salvaged if

1) you are willing to believe the Imperium will quite openly contravene 
their own laws in such a big way

or

2) assume human genome experimentation is wimply closely regulated, and 
so many of the adventure possibilities are still available.

There is no good reason.  Any craft with gravitics should also present
the same problem, or worse.  In fact, gravitic vehicles present a problem
for orbital traffic control, too.  If gravitic technology "works" by
screening all or most of a planet\'s mass from the craft, then the actual
orbital velocity of the craft at a given height will be very sharply
reduced, and quite unnatural, as long as gravitics are on "full".  And if
the planet is rotating, the geostationary (and geosynchronous) orbits 
will drop in altitude substantially as well for the gravitic ship. 

Most of the time, ships would probably be required by law to turn off 
the gravitic lifters and enter a normal orbit.  Otherwise, if the 
lifters were shut down, the ship would change it\'s orbit in a fairly
spectacular, if not lethal, manner.

For that matter, even if you don\'t have gravitics or incredible thrusters,
a geostationary orbit around the Earth is within the range of starship
weapons in MegaTraveller.  You could just take up station way up there
and fire at will.  A case could be made that it\'s harder to hit ground
targets than starships from that far away, I suppose. 

Of course, sitting in one spot, especially while using thrusters, is
foolish if the defenders have any starship-grade surface-to-orbit PD
batteries to return fire with, but predictable orbits are not much
better....

1. Max. ECAD data much appreciated.  Your comment about the similarities with

2300AD, I definately agree with.  It is a great shame it did not take off
well, 
as I thought it a pretty good game system, with a wealth of background 
information.  I never owned it, I borrowed it, and regret not having bought
it 
since....
	
2. Soap Box.  The statistics made for interesting reading.  I have always
felt 
that MegaTravellers greatest sin was to not package their rules in the slick 
black and red stripe format, with the rebellion sourcebook being literally
that, 
a seperate sourcebook.  TNE I thought was a method of redemption, but to be 
honest I think the cover artwork is naff to say the least.  The mechanics
look 
more complex but are probably slick (I have played Twilight 2000).  I do
however 
like the look of the boardgames, brilliant lances and Battle Rider.  Is there

anyone out there who could review them both, and possibly let me know about 
Striker II if its out yet.....

3. I have been examining Traveller resources on the internet recently.  Have 
many people seen the Scott Kellog 2G story at the World Wide Web Missouri
site ? 
it really is a jolly good read.  I notice just recently that at the georan
site, 
the original traders and gunboats deckplans are available in GIF format also.

If anyone knows of any new sources why not let us all in on the secret... by
the 
way I cannot access the mpgn.com site for whatever reason - is there anything

worth ftp\'ing there - please put me out of my misery.

They were probably assuming a specific kind of orbit where only 1 third of
the planet would be in the arc of fire. An over-simplification to be sure,
but it be be some silly Naval Regulation: Thou Shalt Not Orbit Closer thatn
X distance. No more, no less. X shall be the distance, and Thou Shalt not
orbit closer nor farther from this distance, known as X".

As for real reasons to avoid orbital bombardment, examine this:

Orbital bombardment is great for destroying things. However, it can\'t
occupy ground, and not all conflicts involve destruction of property.

The enemy may be huddled around vital, sensitive targets. The danger space
of a Meson Gun is what, a mile? What if you accidently destroy one of your
dirtside objectives?

In the Imperium, especially Classic Traveller, use of orbital bombarment
may be seen as excessive, especially if targeted near civilian areas. There
are likely "Rules of War" that govern martial disuptes within the Imperium,
and orbital bombardment is likely heaviliy regulated.  (Of course, this
doesn\'t matter in the Rebellion - the Knightfall campaign opens with
orbital Meson bombardment of the spaceport the PCs occupy).

Probably so, but nonetheless it is reasonable for starships to *not* play a
role in ground action. IMO they will be brought to bear on a case-by-case
basis - it\'s a degree of escalation and efficiency.

>     I ship _should_ be able to sit in geosynchronous orbit over the AO and

Provided of course it is not harrassed by other enemy ships. Of course,
this is a given if friendly troops are on the ground - I wouldn\'t deposit
them unless I had space superiority.

Of course, if you make yourself a duck without securing the pond first, you
deserve to die. Even if you are in geosynchronous orbit, you can still pull
out to safety - you just have to give up your spot.

MT also has rules for geostationary orbits, which allow a 
ship to hang obver Ground Zero 100% of the time. What I\'ve 
never seen is realistic-looking rules for the _accuracy_ of 
orbital bombardment. Anyone fancy having a go ?

There are various problems with sitting in orbit and blasting 
everything to bits.  Many are political or humanitarian - I\'ll 
not try to explore those - There are however some practical
considerations;

Lasers and Particle Accelerators are supposedly heavily inhibited
by atmosphere.  I seem to remember CT (or striker maybe?) not 
allowing these weapons to be used for ortillery except on vacuum
worlds (as I recall, vacuum worlds were not generally contested
once enemy ships were in orbit ;).

Missiles are never in infinite supply.  this doesn\'t prohibit their
use but certainly limits it.  As for nuclear missiles, see political
considerations above.  Still, I would think missiles to be the orbital
bombardment weapon of choice for vars. reasons; capability of terminal 
guidance, and guided and unguided submunitions come especially to mind.

I once designed a (MT) Company assault transport which was armed almost
exclusively with missiles.  It was not intended to fight other ships, but
to act as orbital support for the landed troops.

Ah, now we come to Meson Guns, the ultimate High Tech weapon.  Anyone
care to guess at it\'s destructive power?  I think that I would put most 
starship mounted Meson Guns in a class with nukes for limits of usage.  
Perhaps the 50-ton bay mounted meson guns would be a bit better - and these
would be used extensively for support if that is the case.  I still
think missiles (purpose built) would be the primary orbital support
weapon.

Anyone remember the _battlefield_ meson accelerator?  Talk about artillery 
support!  I would rule as GM btw that insurmountable engineering problems
prevent anyhting smaller than the battlefield accelerator being built.

In practical terms I think that the 50-ton bay mesons would be equivalent
to the battlefield accel. in destructive power when used against ground
targets.  Accuracy at this range would be of the "which rock" variety
(as in "shouldn\'t we tell them which hill?""no, we should tell them
which rock.").  The problem is one of intelligence, not targetting.

Again, the emphasis should be on "rules of thumb", rather than detailed

    I\'m not sure that there is a relation between debt and inflation.
 Inflation,
last I looked, is an increase in the money supply relative to the overall 
economy.  If the economy grows at 5% per annum, then an increase in
the money supply of 5% per annum is not inflation.  If the economy grows
at 2% per annum, then an increase in the money supply of 5% per annum
will result in an inflation of slightly under 3%....
    Which is a real bitch t model....
    That being said, the only time I ever tried to model inflation in Trav, I
allowed
worlds to overspend their "natural" budget (as determined by
TCS/Striker/what-
ever) by any amount they chose to.  That overspending translated into 
inflation of their money supply, and a consequent devaluing of their currency
(and economy) in the following year in the amount of the overspending.
    This could be stopped by the simple expedient of stopping the
overspending,
but could not be reversed without a raterh painful period of defaltion....

   Use the TL-F ships to do as much as possible.  The main use of the
lower TL ships will be to cover the escape of the TL-F ships if they get
in over their heads.  You _really_ want those TL-F ships to survive.

    Same way.  TL-lower ships are generally not very combat effective,
so they won\'t allow for winning much in the way of battles, but they
can quite effectively cover retreats, pursue a defeated foe, fight 
second-rate ships (battletenders, carriers. tankers, etc).  Basically
treat them as a forlorn hope....

So the next time two super-powers come to grips it won\'t be fought on the
ground, 
it will be fought by the spys and saboteurs who break through security and
tell their guys where ALL the opposition forces are and what they are doing.

If you have perfect intelligence on YOUR forces then you can better utilise
them; if only you knew where the opposition was.

BUT if both sides have perfect intelligence on the OTHER sides forces and
they are relatively balanced then you don\'t have a war you have stalemate.

Apart from starship indirect fire or support fire which is obviously
important,
and has already been discussed in the list, one thing that I have always
found 
hard to accept is the lack of modern indirect fire weapons at TL 12-15. 
In practice after the introduction of the mass driver the only improvement is
the meson gun.
I believe that indirect fire will remain very important in ground
operations, however the minimum meson gun size is crucial. I have 
tried to design TL 13 support vehicle in MT (the TL13 equivalent of the M109)

and I end up with something in excess of 1000 tons...Using the old
mercenary meson gun would produce (although at higher TL) something more
reasonable.

My feeling is that Army generals would either ask for lighter meson gun 
designs or for some new more powerful and smarter kind of ammo for the 
mass drivers.. The idea of hiding your artillery where the opponent cannot
see it, looks too good to be abandoned. Faster vehicles (especially with
high signature) would just call for deadlier weapons.

If the list could agree on what "rules" we should follow, one could attempt
to sketch the order of battle of a TL 15 battalion. The reason why
I think this is a good starting point is that IF indirect fire becomes
even more efficient and common than it is now (TL 8) typical troopers might
all become forward observers equipped with light personal weaponry to
guarantee survival with a minimal signature.
In contrast, IF there is no indirect fire support apart from occasional
starships, it would seem reasonable to assume that every soldier has
an FGMP or even something heavier suitable to dispose of a tank....

On a separate issue, how do people on the list see sensors and naval cbt?
obviously it all depends on the precise rules, but I do like to have 
AWACS ships doing the sensor work for battleships. Is this common?

     including the Grav cavalry combat, suits of battledress-like armor and

     Chris Moeller\'s beautiful fully painted pages and the Travelleresque

Striker and other CT sources did not allow PAWS to work in atmosphere. A
number 
of discussions covered this, with the main points being:

1.	Starship weapons use neutral particles (which hold together in vacuum 
but break up in atmosphere);
2.	Surface PAWS are charged (generally following a laser-cut "hole" in the 
atmosphere but which break up in vacuum).
(To Roger Moore: does reality agree with this old view?)

Lasers were usable in atmosphere, although their range was reduced. However,
If 
Striker I was used to create these weapons, the main problem was not the
range 
of the weapon, but the range of the sensors...

Peter did not discuss fusion/plasma weapons at all. One of my players mounted
a 
starship fusion gun weapon on a (BIG) grav tank - I have the stats at home,
but 
from memory it was a penetration of 103 and a range of 50+ km (probably more,

but limited by sensors), able to take out any tank (and most starships, at
close 
range. No wonder they were good close-in weapons in HG).

> Anyone remember the _battlefield_ meson accelerator?

I do. We used it (home ruling??) with a danger space of 10 m - ie. able to 
destroy one vehicle at a time. Much more surgical than spinal mounts.
However, 
your tank still has to be able to *see* the target - a case for drone
vehicles 
carrying sensors and meson communicators? With a meson gun, the "pop-up" 
manoeuver (dangerous at high TL\'s) is dispensed with.

Reasonable assumption, still as it has been noted already, what you really 
need is a neutral beam not a beam of neutral particles. In a magnetic field 
the neutral beam becomes polarized and develops an electric field balancing 
the Lorenz force. A neutral beam is easier to produce than a beam of
neutrals.

>2. 	Surface PAWS are charged (generally following a laser-cut "hole" in the

It seems to me that plasma instabilities (e.g. Kelvin-Helmotz) will destroy 
such a beam rather quickly. Point defence usage would be possible but
probably 
nothing long range. I guess this is still matter of debate among physicists.

>..the main problem was not the range of the weapon, but the range of the 
> sensors..

Agreed, and it is also realistic. Once you see them, they are dead. 

>I do. We used it (home ruling??) with a danger space of 10 m

I do not have at hand now my ironmongery manual. By using the 50 ton bay 
meson in the MT rules and the blackglobe rules for energy transfer, I find 
that the MG transfers energy at 20,000 MW rate. This means 1.2E11 Joules per 
6 seconds turn = 0.03 kiloton.  By rescaling such an energy (crudely) one 
finds a 200 m danger space. Sounds a lot but is probably what one wants when 
dealing with strongly armoured, agile Grav Tanks.
In 6 seconds a supersonic tank can move 10 times that distance.

Peter H. Brenton said:
>I still think missiles (purpose built) would be the primary orbital support 
>weapon.

Might be, but a missile has to physically reach the neighbourhood of the
target
intact, avoiding anti-missile fire and  E^(any odd number)CMs. Also it has to

be quite a good missile to approach  a fast vehicle like e.g. the Invader 
Tank (vehicle 24, of 101 V).

High ROF Mass Drivers (from the ground) using the same smart rounds with 
terminal guidance could end up being more convenient since you reuse the 
propulsion system.

>The problem is one of intelligence, not targetting.

Yup, especially to get the sensors of those heavy MGs underground..

For the Xboat Ground Cbt Manual we should really agree on a set of concepts
and rules. If indirect fire is powerful, tanks will operate like cockroaches,
if it is not, then  the only enemy of a grav tank is another grav tank and 
one might end up with some kind of dogfight.

sides, lovingly provided by US arms brokers of the U.N.
DEsigns for smart bullets that track the soldiers transmissions, and =

epileptic like shock.  Flash a light like this from behind your advancing =
troops and anyone turning to face them will have a bit of a problem.  I =
don\'t know with our current technology, and my current security =
clearence, how much of this stuff works.
One thing to note:  In Tom Clancy\'s novels, the complaint i\'ve heard is =
he has the high tech stuff TOO realiable.  Alot of the toys we actually =
deploy sometime have a 60% failier rate reported, so the real rate is =
probably much higher.
Maybe you can build stuff of a tech level or two abouve what your base =
tech level is, but the reliability drops.  I guess you could treat this =
as a wear and tear factor, or a reduction in skill level when used.

	I would like to make a few comments regarding your article "indirect 
fire and sensors":

"one thing that I have always found hard to accept is the lack of modern 
indirect fire weapons at TL 12-15..... I believe that indirect fire will
remain 
very important in ground operations."

Is the emphasis today not increasingly focused upon direct-fire solutions ?  
Artillery today utilises smart technology like the Merlin system for mortars 
offered by British Aerospace, and the \'skeets\' and various smart submunitions

developed by the US military ?  In future would it not be the case that as 
armies become smaller and more manoeuverable, that the emphasis switches to 
direct-fire weaponry, backed up by good sensor technology ?  
	Indirect fire still maybe potent for use against low-tech military 
formations relying upon attrition, but at TL 12-15 the formations are
probably 
victim to that most common of ailments - assuming that their opponent will be

equipped like they themselves are ....

My own feeling vis a vie Traveller HIGH tech combat is that rapid moving grav

vehicles and battle dress troops with grav belts etc. will use plasma weapons

and so forth to directly nail their opponents.  The defence may deploy smart 
mines that sense grav-modules (anyone thought about that ?).  What say you
Max 
in defence ????
 
"On a separate issue, how do people on the list see sensors and naval cbt? 
obviously it all depends on the precise rules, but I do like to have 
AWACS ships doing the sensor work for battleships. Is this common? "

There seems on the face of it similarities between submarine warfare today
and 
space warfare tommorrow (plus several caveats).  In underwater warfare
sensors 
are paramount, and picket ships of some form acting as forward scouts will 
provide a crucial role, and have in my campaign.  AWACS ships are a little 
tricker - do you have designs for any for CT ?

I am going to be attending GEN CON for the first time this year, 
and I was wondering how many of you will be attending as well.  

Clay Bush and I were thinking that it might be neat that those of
us from the TML, XBOAT, and HIWG lists meet the night before the con
starts.  

I would like to suggest around 7pm in one of the restaurants or 
lounges in the Marc Plaza (now called Milwaukee Hilton), on Aug 9 
(Wednesday).  They are renovating the hotel and I have asked them to
send me a brochure of the new facilities.

If enough people show up we could take over the restaurant/bar/lounge!

Anyway, how many people out theRe are planning to go to GEN CON
and would be interested in meeting the rest of us.  If others are
already planning something like this, then please let the rest of us know.

A wonderful game, IMHO the best hard science fiction game I have
ever found. And it has the best aliens by far.
 
I have a the Near Star Map as a computer file, reachable at
http://www.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/dive/NYSTAR3.DAT.Z
(there is also a datafile, stars.vr, for the virtual reality
system DIVE where the user can fly around among the stars).
 
I plan to post my new version of 2300AD soon. I was not
completely happy with the somewhat dated feeling of the game,
so I changed it into a much more dark setting. My version is
essentially the world of Aliens, with some cyberpunk elements
and a much more cynical world. The colonies are poor and
rebellious, the core is growing stranger and stranger, the
Pentapods control an unhealthily large part of the economy,
drugs are extremely common etc.

I feel that our opinions do not differ as much as it would initially
appear...

>Artillery today utilises smart technology ..

Indeed, I have in mind smart rounds like the IMC (Improved Conventional
Munitions), FASCAM (Field Artillery Scatterable Mines, GRAV!!),
SADARM (Search and Destroy ARMour), various ammo for the Phase II and III
of MRLS and ATACMS like the BAT (Brilliant Anti-Armor Submunition) and a 
few more things developed at higher TL. I haven\'t had time (yet) to make my
mind on whether mass drivers with smart rounds are better than meson guns.
In any case, I define as indirect all weapons that do not require direct
line of sight to the target, therefore including launch and forget missiles,
and most smart rounds.

>What say you Max in defence ????

You may be right indeed. Even forgetting about the real world and
concentrating on MT, I do not know which way it goes. A fast moving
Grav Tank has a very high signature...(at least acoustic..). The
issue is: how much firepower would be required to .. silence it?
if the firepower required is more expensive than another tank then..
I hope to find the time (and players) to equip different
forces at the same TL but very different operational concepts and
see what happens (I suspect that the outcome will depend a lot on the
terrain features, e.g. desert vs jungle). I guess that\'s what the Imperial 
Army and Marines would do anyway..As I suggested some time ago, if a few of
us
agree on the exact rules and each suggests an order of battle we could run
a few wargames in parallel... 

> AWACS ships are a little tricker - do you have designs for any for CT ?

I have designed some picket ships in MT (I could do it with HG if there is 
interest, although it is a long time that I do not use it). The main problem 
with MT is that the way sensors work is not very smart..

My house rule is that each sensor can perform ONE task per turn free
Each extra task reduces the UCP of every offensive weapon by one. In
addition if a ship signature is above faint I increase the difficulty
level by one unless sensors are on a boom.  
With these rules it is very convenient to have lots of small ships full
of sensors deployed around your fleet directing the battleships fire.
With such an arrangment the battleships would stay out of sensor
range of enemy battleships, and both parties would try to locate the
opponent\'s picket ships. If space fighters are used to locate the
opponent\'s picket ships and protect your own then the picket would
probably turn into an AWACS.

On another fleet combat issue, reading various discussions on the list I 
have the impression that it is generally assumed that fleets jump in a system
as a whole. Actually, since the time for jump is randomly determined
and may vary by up to one day, I\'ve always assumed that a fleet
will reach a system scattered in space and time. This makes fleet
operations even more difficult. 

              Cheers,

becoming a bit too threadbare.  But here are my points:
1) Keep the Traveller culture, races, timeline, as much as possible.  
2) Seriously rework the system generation & frequency tables - ala the 
Goeran archives - the stellar system foundation from 2300 was a magnificent 
start (albeit a pretty weakly done game) from a hard-science point of view. 
(in that vein, I think someone had a woody for \'beanstalks\')
3) Seriously re-work planetary details; i think the game Outpost, while 
lame from a playability standpoint, admirably represented the kind of \'raw 
worlds\' available.
4) Some minor rewriting and development of the equipment and tech level 
systems - personally, the TL15 Imperium marine is wimpy, given that the 
difference in lethality should be to TL9 us as we are to TL3(!)
5) (my personal bugaboo) a 3d map.  geez.  it\'s space, after all.  take 
the  "10,000 world of the imperium" and put \'em in 3d space, suddenly the 
imperium\'s pretty dinky.  it\'s not that complicated of a thing, when you 
realize that it\'s a natural candidate for an RPG that mandates having a 
computer - rather than being a book-game that has some computer support.

None of these things are really that significant, given the resources that 
could be marshalled via this medium.

What does anyone say - care to come up with a set of XBOAT rules that 
maintain the essence of classic traveller, but are written in 1995, rather 
than re-hashings of rules written in what, 1980?

has 
the high tech stuff TOO realiable.  Alot of the toys we actually deploy
sometime 
have a 60% failure rate reported, so the real rate is probably much higher."

This is a statement well worth bearing in mind.  Here are a couple of Tech
Level 
7 - 8 examples from recent history.

1. The US army sought to develop a point defence anti-air system called the 
PIVAD or Sargeant York.  It had a radar which could track low flying rotary 
objects i.e. helicopters.  In its debut to esteemed members of the services,
the 
executive etc.  it was put through its paces, whereby it tracked a rotary 
object, and engaged - successfully destroying the fan on a US army field 
toilet...

2. The US Navy advanced AEGIS system enabled phenomenal response times as,
with 
minimal human inolvement, a radar would identify, track and prioritise
targets 
for the automatic missile system to engage.  On occassion this system has - 
recognised an A310 Airbus as an F-14 tomcat, and killed 300 people, and
nearly 
destroyed a quantas jumbo jet flying over the Pacific.

3. The gulf war of 1991 was characterised by pictures of highly accurate 
missiles hitting targets flawlessly.  remember many did not, and these were
not 
shown !  much work is being performed fitting GPS to paveway bombs and just 
about everything including the kitchen sink to improve accuracy - why if the 
weapons were so accurate in the first place ???

4. Also, the patriot missile system whose radar was confused by the poor
quality 
of Iraqi scuds that broke up on re-entry creating many targets....

In short, the state-of-the-art can be extremely tempremental, and players
scream 
"unfair, its not in the rules" when their gizmos break down.....

When I was refereeing a campaign that was one of my favorite devices to make 
life more interesting.  Particularly when I had a well equipped party.

Another concept that I had in the back of my mind was that a high tech item 
was developed on a particular world.  There *could* be reasons why that high 
tech piece of gear would not work on another world.  Fer instance, 
environmental.  If (to take an extreme example) the world that an item was 
developed and tested on was a desert world and you take that item to a world 
that is a highly humid place it might start screwing up at the worst 
possible moment.

A "Rambo" type PC that was playing in one of my campaigns discovered that on 
a rather low tech world where he thougth he would be preeminiant with his 
ACR with every bell and whistle known to sophontkind discovered that the 
high pollen counts caused the action of his weapon to require cleaning more 
often than normal.  Otherwise the weapon "stovepiped" on him.  And did.  In 
the middle of a firefight. Many times.  Repeatedly.  :)

>scientifically?

My answer to that is "Yes, but..". When I started playing CT in 1980-81
I was still working at my first degree in Physics. My things in travellers
looked real bad...I worked at my own Hardscience, no Thruster plates, no
Jump Drive, 3D version...Everything was similar, except the Imperium was
smaller and travelling from one star to another using Ramjets was quite
a task. Players simply did not enjoy the game. The game was not an SF RPG
any more but became a strategic wargame.
I restarted playing the old CT and later MT when it came out. I believe that:
1- the Imperium background is really great (**CENSORED** GDW for the
Rebellion and TNE..,btw I would be curious to know whether the revenues
really
went up.)
2- changing the rules in a way compatible with the Imperium history and
background is a MAJOR task. 
3- once one is through with such a task he may be tempted to publish it and
then he will get sued for copyright infringement.
Also it is unclear whether a ML is the best place to carry out such a
project,
years ago the project TDR (Traveller Done Right) on the TML did not go
very far as far as I know...
As far as I know physics, astronomy, economy, sociology, biology, computer
science (the virus...,sic), psychology are all very wimpy in Traveller...
still it is/WAS a great game!

Personally, I\'d rather develop a totally new game then try to patch
Traveller.
(and I might actually try to do it..)

                               Max

    The Port of Houston did a similar amount of business

>From my readings, it appears that Hitler had some realy awful weapons which
he wouldn\'t use because he had a personal philosophy NOT to deploy a weapon
that they did not also have a counter for.  He was very worried about how
quickly the Allies could duplicate the weapon and use it.  A couple of
examples that spring to mind are his special concrete penetrating bomb that
was intended for use against the Mraginot line and his \'dirty\' (radiation)
bomb which he really wanted to use on the Americans but didn\'t want the
reprisals to fall on Germany.  He sent that technology and some samples to
the Japanese via sub because he knew they would use it if they had the
opportunity.  Luckily, the war ended before they could.

Emergency Agility: No meson gun, lasers, particle accelerator, plasma gun



The BF series of fast battle-riders were produced on Mora/Spinward
Marches to fulfil demand for a pure ship-killer. Their role is similar to
that of the strike fighter: to carry heavy weapons for short durations on
relatively simple seek-and-destroy missions. While fighters use their
agility to avoid serious damage, BF series craft employ thick armour.
Sometimes power is diverted from the meson gun to achieve respectable
emergency agilities for pursuit or evasion. BF series craft are most
effective against escorts, and are dangerous to cruisers. They have
proved slightly vulnerable to concerted attack by fighters, and cannot
withstand heavy missile bombardment or the heavier spinal mount weapons,
but cause damage out of all proportion to their displacement when
correctly employed.

In addition to 5 and 6 kiloton vessels, there are also two 7.5 kiloton
designs, one with a meson-N spinal mount and another with increased
agility and greater endurance. In general, BF series battle-riders are
deployed in squadrons of four to six from cruiser-sized tenders (100 kton
range). [The tenders have a 30kton carrying capacity, which allows them
to carry four 7.5 kton craft, two 7.5 kton and three 5 kton, five 6 kton,
or six 5 kton craft, or a standard-sized 30kton battle-rider.] If pressed
into service as system defence craft, they will sport drop tanks or
external demountable tanks, to extend patrol duration. However, their
lack of any subsidiary craft is a distinct handicap to such employment.


Design notes: I\'ve assumed Book 5 CT rules for meson screen energy usage
(as is obviously done in Fighting Ships) and for purification plant
volume and mass (= 2 x volume). Needless to say, the 7.5 kton designs and
the tender aren\'t done yet, except for some preliminary calculations to
see if a meson-N can be squeezed into 7.5 ktons, 6G etc. Add extra
sensors to taste, and don\'t retro-engineer to CT -- they\'ll die horribly!
I\'m also tempted to produce a 5kton missile boat, with enormous agility,
as a variant.

Depends on the trade status of the world. 200 million people in a
dirt-poor backwater aren\'t going to generate that much business. 10 
billion people on Trin, with a decent industrial base, are going to 
generate a *huge* amount of merchant traffic. Although I\'d say that 
most of that traffic should be transported by bulk carrier, there 
should still be some good pickings for tramp skippers.

It also depends on how well-integrated interplanetary economics is. 
If most worlds are self-sufficient in basics (hydroponics or algae 
for food, biomass or radioactives or solar power for energy), I 
wouldn\'t expect to see the kind of mass transport of foodstuffs that 
we encounter on Earth. Luxuries and high-tech items are another 
matter of course. I have a vague recollection of a discussion on the 
TML a long time ago concerning this -- I think the consensus was that 
the old Imperium was such a heavily-integrated market.

As a matter of interest, what\'s the breakdown for cargo types through
New Orleans and Houston? Given that the US is a major industrial 
nation (I hesitate to put the word "still" in there :-) as well as a
major agricultural producer, it\'d be interesting to see the split 
between agricultural produce and other stuff.

Draft Scenario 1
Rules: standard MT (incl. Referee\'s Companion)
Theme: two TL 14 brigades are fighting each other on a planet
X-861000-0 with a lot of rough and broken terrain. Nobody has fixed 
installations and both fleets avoid engagement. 
In order to win, one has to conquer a given, known  spot (let\'s say that 
the spot contains access to a hidden very powerful meson gun). 
Obviously it is rather artificial but it is better to start simple.
To fix ideas let\'s consider an almost  TL 8 in structure, TL 14 in equipment 
Armoured brigade fully equipped with energy weapons so as to be
less dependent on supplies...

Arm Bde on 2 Armoured btns, 1 Mechanized btn, 1 Artillery Group, 1 HQ cmp,
1 Cbt Engineers cmp, 1 Electronic Warfare cmp, 1 Logistic btn, 1 Cavalry cmp 
(on Zhodani speeders??), 1 Field Hospital cmp.

Armoured btn: 4 companies with 14 Trepida (v32) tanks, 1 HQ company
with 1 Trepida, 3 Astrin (v33) APC, 6 modified Astrin for support (equipped
also with  Recon Drones), 1 support company on 1 antitank platoon on ? 
[I\'d like something better than a FG] with 4 to 9 weapons, 1 light cavalry 
platoon on 8 (military version) Rapid Speeders. 1 airdefence platoon (to be 
defined).

Mechanized btn: 3 companies, 144 Men and 12 Astrin each. Each 12 men
squad bears 10 FGMP-14, battle dress, and gravbelt. 1 HQ company
with 9 Astrin (some modified for support), 1 heavy weapons company
with 1 antitank platoon, 1 air defence, 1 Fusion gun battery (something
heavier than the standard).  

Artillery group: 1 Meson gun battery (bulky!) on 4 MGs for heavy, long
range support, 3 medium support batteries (I would like to use MDs..
let\'s say some fusion gun here), 1 airdefence battery (on lasers
tentatively).

Cbt Engineers, EW, Logistics, etc have to be defined better.

Operations: normally the brigade will operate in combat groups depending
on needs eg armoured cbt groups (with 3 tank companies 1 mech. company,
1 medium support battery, plus minor detachments  each).

I guess that it will be possible to: 1- design much better vehicles
than the ones used here (eg the Striker Tank), 2- prove that a similar
bde with some MDs would, on the short run, be superior.

The mail is already too long, before continuing I will wait for some
comments sitting quitely while my clone gets the flames...

    It\'ll take a few days to get a good breakdown.  But about 1.1 million
tons of that was steel (mostly imports) in New Orleans, with a similar
amount of imported steel in Houston, but much more exported steel.
    "Bulk cargo" is mostly agricultural and other raw materials (coal
mostly, here), while "general cargo" is steel and container cargo -
mostly industrial products, in other words.
    So a rough guestimate is 75% agro and other raw materials, and
25% industrial products...

yes to both, and all of the spectrum in between. So

Would we even have had the choice?
    Consider the cockroach. Older than man, it is one of
the most successful species, evolutionary speaking.
I\'m willing to bet it could survive being trod upon by
a triceratops, I\'m willing to bet that zero-G wouldn\'t
phase it. Ships have wiring, air ducts, panelling and
sink fittings like any modern place. There are still
likely to be as many architecturally useless places 
for them to hole up. Food preparation and cleanup is
unlikely to be 100% efficient. Not worth the cost. If
a cockroach can live by eating the glue in corrugated
cardboard boxes today, I\'m sure it can live equivalently
by licking the lubricant from a starship\'s laser couplings.
    Consider the Norwegian rat. A bane to seafarers since
that first dugout log floated down a river. Starship holds
are big. Canisters may be tough but there are always
weaknesses. How much food does a battleship crewed by
thousands go through? Where do they store it? If mice can
learn to walk on tiptoe and survive in meat freezers,
I\'m sure rats could become very aware of "take hold" sirens
and "vacuum imminent" warnings.
    Consider mildew. A ship or station in normal orbit
transverses from light to dark much more frequently then
we terrestrial subjects experience. One of the complains
from Skylab was how the ship popped and pinged as the
hull expanded and contracted going in and out of the
light. No matter how advanced your life support, condensation
is going to be a problem. Where there is condensation and
head, you\'ve got mildew. Even with the best production
system, I\'m willing to bet that nature is still cheaper
a lot of the time. Spaceships will still have natural
fibre seat coverings, wall coverings, etc, etc. Plenty
of scope for scum eaters.
    So consider finally, as you run your games, what is the
potential for vermin. Not only will the tramp freighter\'s
they hire on leak oil, but also crawl cockroaches. Raw
recruits on a Navy ship get sent on rat patrol. The
sleepover room they hire at the starport D was cheap because
it has a mildew problem.

Well, yes, maybe. You could still decompress the entire ship
for an hour or so, and there would be no more rats and
cockroaches. Sure, this procedure would probably be a
little rough to some of the crew\'s personal belongings.

But the idea is great in itself! Maybe rats couldn\'t survive
this treatment very well, but it\'s a good guess that vermin
exists in the Traveller universe that could survive this and
maybe even rougher treatment.

So starships could be infested with extraterrestrial bugs of the
referee\'s own device. Slimy things, poisonous things,
disease-carriers, destructive little vermin, even cute animals
if the referee is in a playful mood.

I think there are a lot of improvements to be made, but the basic means of
delivery will remain unchanged: Throwing an object up so that it lands on
your enemy. Whether this is done with compressed air, chemical propellants,
or electromagnetic mass drivers is irrelevant - there are only so many ways
to throw a ball.

I think one reason artillery development pales in comparison to small arms
development is that the technology for small arms changes - lasers, PAWs,
and so on - while artillery delivery doesn\'t. The improvements in artillery
are going to be faster response time, coordination of multiple spotters,
and greater accuracy. I imagine that by the Imperial age, personal
navigation transponders will relay the exact position of each friendly
trooper, and sensor suites mounted on each trooper will provide information
on enemy locations in relation to their positions. Right now it takes a few
minutes at least, even with the aid of computers, to relay the position of
an enemy, calculate the attack, and traverse to fire. THat process gets
speeded up tremendously by computer and sensor improvements that allow for
such automated integration of information.

Drones and missiles maybe become more effective and cheaper alternatives to
traditional artillery. A contragrav drone with masking a high velocity
could run anyone\'s day more than single round, and are especially more
effective when you consider advanced artillery rounds would be like small
drones anyway.

The improved targeting I mentioned above might let artillery finally target
vehicles on the fly - right now it\'s just too difficult to hit a fast
moving vehicle with artillery.

Not for battleships, no. They typically have pretty good sensors for
themselves. Aircraft Carriers seem to have the Command and Control ability
in US Naval doctrine. Of course this is based only on limited experience
with Harpoon. . . I"m sure some real naval times could tell more
accurately. Still, IMHO most starships will be capable of detecting objects
for themselves, and if fleet actions occur with ships several light-seconds
apart, independence will be even more important.

As I recall, Book 2 (or Book 5) explains that evacuating the ship is
standard operating procedure during combat.  Keeps decompression damage to a
minimum.  Granted, this makes space combat rather less like Star Trek or
Star Wars, but it does seem somewhat more realistic.

It does suggest that each stateroom might have a smaller decompression-safe
storage space for that stuff that \'might\' be affected by hard vacuum, while
Naval or Scout characters might have vacuum tight footlockers, etc.

This detail seems to have been more or less dropped in MegaTraveller,
however.

    Hmmm....
    Makes it hard to quote you here, Jo...

    There is a relatively straightforward solution to unwanted 
lifeforms in your ship - keep your cargo hold in vacuum all
the time, and depressurize your whole ship every month or
three to finish any leakers...
    Also, don\'t land unless you have to.  That\'s what Up Starports
are for....

I have seen FFW, and it does sort of work this way.  The Imperials
start with a number of small Imperial Marine units.  Some of these
are Elite (which has an affect on combat) and all are to TL F
standards.  The defense forces indigenous to the worlds in the
Spinward Marches, however, are at the TL of the world on which
they are based.  These are not, however, Imperial Army units.

Most of the Imperial Army units come in as reinforcements.  And
most are at TL F.  But I believe that that\'s because of the
heavy reliance on Strategic Reserve strategy on the part of the
Imperials.  Thus the bulk of the Imperial *Army* is actually 
coming from worlds somewhere in the Interior, where TL F worlds
are, if not prevalent, at least common.

There are several non TL F Army units, however, and lots of
Colonial Forces which are brought in as reinforcements which can
be as low as (iffen I remember rightly) TL A.

    'body' => 'Hi All,

while trying to run a CT game (using MT) during the week, I "found" and area
of 
the rules that I had previously ignored, the interstellar trade section.
After 
plummeting beneath the screen for 20mins when my players casually asked "So,
what 
cargo\'s are available?", I was distressed to find that all the effort I had
put 
into generating cargos etc was of no consequence and in fact just a faceless
job 
lot from the first table would have done!

Now, people have probably mailled such things before but here\'s my "solution"
to 
this problem:

INFLUENCE OF TRADE-GOOD TYPES ON RESALE PRICE
my goal here was to integrate the roll for general class of trade goods
(Processed 
Resources, Natural Resources, Manufactured Goods, Information and Novelties)
into 
the trading system.  Thus not only do Ag world goods sell better on an As
world 
but specificaly biological natural resources (as the asteroid belt has
none/very 
little).

Assumptions
1)As per MT you must roll on the first trade-good type table you can
(although  
this is inconsistent within MT)
2)The goods generated  by these tables represent the abundence of a
particular 
resource type on a world.
3)No modifiers to the tables were considered.
4)Both Natural and Processed resources are split into 2 catagories Nat I, Nat
II, 
Proc I and Proc II corresponding to (11-33) and (44-66) on the tables.

Analysis
First I calculated the percentage chance of a given type of good being
available 
on a world type - this would show which worlds had an abundence/scarcity of 
particular goods.

  WORLD: Ag   WaRi AsVaDeNa  Ni   In  Others  Average
GOODS      
Nat I    4.2  13.9   41.7   20.8  4.2   8.3    15.5
Nat II  37.5  13.9    0.0   20.8  4.2   8.3    14.1
Proc I   0.0  15.3   16.7    8.3  9.7  22.2    11.2
ProcII  30.6  15.3    0.0    8.3  9.7  22.2    14.3
Man     11.1  16.7   30.6   25.0 55.6  11.1    25.0
Info    13.9  25.0   13.9   13.9 13.9  19.4    16.6
Nov      2.7   2.7    2.7    2.7  2.7   2.7     2.7

Results
Once you have this data you can rank the worlds to see where a particular
type of 
good will sell well (or poorly).  I have generated two such tables below.  To
use 
these tables just insert a new step into the resale price calculations.  In
order 
not to upset things too much I use these modifiers in addition to the
destination 
world/sourceworld modifiers (this also has the advantage that you can just
skip 
determining cargo type if you want a quick resolution).

TABLE A (based on double/half average abundance generates a -/+1 to resale
price)

  WORLD: Ag   WaRi AsVaDeNa  Ni   In  Others   
GOODS      
Nat I    +1    +0     -1     +0   +1    +0     
Nat II   -1    +0     +1     +0   +1    +0     
Proc I   +1    +0     +0     +0   +0    -1

Nov      +S    +S     +S     +S   +S    +S     
Novelties are special and have an unpredictable selling price so when the
item is 
to be sold( ie on arrival at a destination world) roll 1d6 where 1,2=-1,
3,4=+0, 
5,6=+1.


TABLE B (based on each +/-10% from average abundance generates a -/+1 to
resale 
price)
This is an alternate table to be used instead of TABLE A if more influence on

price is desired.

  WORLD: Ag   WaRi AsVaDeNa  Ni   In  Others   
GOODS      
Nat I    +1    +0     -2     +0   +1    +0     
Nat II   -2    +0     +2     +0   +1    +0     
Proc I   +2    +0     +0     +0   +0    -1   
ProcII   -1    +0     +2     +0   +0    +0     
Man      +1    +0     +0     +0   -3    +1

Nov      +S    +S     +S     +S   +S    +S   

As you can see there\'s endless possibliities here.

And now a question, in MT there is mention of both freight and cargos but the
two 
seem confused.  How do I determine how much freight is available, and how
much 
cargo is available?

The jump time accuracy even for the most accurate Imperial Navy ships
is, I believe,  in the 15-30 minutes range. However, apparently Marc Miller
in his JTAS #24 "Jumpspace" article (I haven\'t seen it, I am quoting
from Steve Bonneville posting in Xboat 155) states that a jump is accurate
to 1E-10. This is a lot! a minor retcon would be to say that spatial accuracy
equals temporal accuracy times the speed of light. Therefore typical
spatial accuracy for a very accurate jump (within 15 minutes) would
be 18 Mkm = 0.12 AU. The benefits of such a choice are:

1- make rock throwing to smash planets more difficult.
2- make  coordinate fleet jumping a bit more difficult, fleets have
to reassemble after jumps. This explains why the Imperial Navy is still
building battleships rather than only battleraiders.
3- make piracy a bit more interesting. Merchant ships will not jump
routinely within 100 diameters and pirates have a chance.

Vacuum might kill the big things but you\'re still thinking "Earth" here -
you should be thinking "Alien" - i.e. there will be bugs that don\'t care if
you evacuate their air. I\'m pretty certain evacuation won\'t kill all
bacteria, etc. Then there\'s toxins in the system (overheated synthetic
materials giving off poison gas, recyclers not working properly), and the
problem that evacuating every month still leaves the other 27 days for
vermin, et al to accumulate.

Has anyone ever actually had their players volunteer: "Hey guys, it\'s time
for us all to suit up and evacuate the ship in case we\'ve got rats on
board"... I shouldn\'t think so!

Anyone subjected their players to finding an ant or wasps nest in their air
system?
"C\'mon Jack, get that suit on"
"Fred! I\'m doing it as fast as-"
"Hell, listen to that buzz - they know we\'re on to them"
"All done. Ready to Evac"
HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...
"Yo! Take that suckers"
HISSSS...
"Er, Jack"
SSSS...
"Yeh, yeh, what is it?"
SS...
"I can still hear the buzz"
"Don\'t be stupid - in space, no one can hear you buzz"
"Er, Jack, I can definitely-"
"Fred, er, that means, er-"
"Oh God. Ah! Oooh! They sting! Damn!"
"Get out of the suit Fred! Get out!"
"Arrrgh! Get the bloody pressure back up! OOOOOH!"

There are, of course, other measures. IMHC (In My Humble Campaign) ship air
systems have electrified grids and mini trundling robots in between to keep
out nasties and sweep up any resulting mess...

permission to copy mine, which you may have noticed attached to my bit of
prose on the Mercenaries novellette piece I submitted on 15th May.

The reason we\'ve started doing this is that some people are making a lot of
xboat/trav stuff available to a very wide audience via WWW, etc. without
asking the permission of the authors and without making clear the
copyrighted nature of the work.

If Jo or I decide to send stuff here which we might later want to use as a
submission to a magazine, work of fiction, etc. then we have to protect our

the author\'s identity. I believe (and I hope Jo would agree) that we are not
attempting to stifle the use of our work for individual members of the list
(including quoting small sections as appropriate in replies - copyright law
DOES allow that), but we object to having such data made widely available
outside the list without being *asked*.

This is not intended to excite a drawn-out discussion of copyright law

>...sensor suites mounted on each trooper will provide information
>on enemy locations in relation to their positions.

This is true. Still EMS counter measures will also be very powerul
at high TL and densitometers and neutrino detectors are very bulky,
the latter probably too bulky for a single trooper. If you do without
them it is a totally different game.

>Do you need a meson gun? Don\'t munitions improve at all at upper TLs?

Yes, I do need it. Munitions improve, too. If we concentrate on Traveller
the improvement in munition and the relevant ranges are given in the rules. 
I believe that a Meson Gun would be a useful asset, although probably too 
expensive and bulky to be really the TL13-15 equivalent of the M109. A meson
gun is powerful, has long range, is harder to track where it is hiding
(since your EMS won\'t see the shells coming...).

>Drones and missiles maybe become more effective and cheaper alternatives to
>traditional artillery.

I partly agree. But look at air-to-air Real World combat. Missiles have
not totaly replaced guns. A fast dumb projectile may have advantages.
Artificial gravity fields can be detected in MT, so that a drone so
equipped, though useful, may  have to face alerted point defences. It all
depends on the exact rules...If point defence is very effective, one
may have to saturate the target and saturation is very expensive to
achieve with smart ammo. Here again a meson gun would not require a
logistic system able to ship around tons of ordnance every day for
every battery. I have to agree that missiles might be an alternative 
to mass drivers (for me that\'s still artillery, when at artillery 
[technical..] school apart from a few 40 mm our group only saw missiles...).

>The improved targeting I mentioned above might let artillery finally target
>vehicles on the fly - right now it\'s just too difficult to hit a fast
>moving vehicle with artillery.

Agreed! the battlefield will indeed look very different at higher TL.

I hope to have soon some more material and vehicle designs for my 
TL 14  armoured brigade and then be able to start some tests.
I\'d like to see what happens when an energy-weapons unit meets one
with more standard ordnance at the same TL.

>Still, IMHO most starships will be capable of detecting objects
>for themselves,..

Again I think it all depends on the exact rules under consideration.
I have only CT and MT experience. In MT it seems to me that it is
easier to hit something than it is to find it in the first place.
Under this assumption it pays to have sensor ships directing
fire. It is not too unlike soviet cruisers equipped with surface-to
surface missiles (or even the French-Italian OTOMAT Mk 3 with a   
range significantly exceeding 100 km). The effective weapon range
is larger than the detection range, therefore they need midcourse
guidance (often provided by helos).

I had a lot of fun when I threw a smaetal swarm at my players.  Smaets
were described in one of the Journal Bestiary columns.  Tiny biting
flying insect-like things with a dormant stage that can withstand
vaccuum for long durations.  It helped that they were trying escape
the planet with their lives at the time, and the swarm had every ship
being held under quarantine.  And of course it happened while they
were in the open, miles from any airtight structure.  Then they broke
quarantine and left anyway, only to find out vaccuum didn\'t kill the
suckers, and no planet would let them land because of the quarantine.

I heartily recommend them.  :-)

(The players enjoyed it too -- made for a lot of interesting action.
And Los Angeles County was spraying for medflies at the time.  :-)

I am pleasantly surprised. I must confess I did not realize Traveller stuff
was doing so well in the marketplace. I do face a dilemma, now. Offers have
come in at a fast pace, and several people have suggested this sale go to
auction. Here are current offers to buy at the prices quoted (NB means no bid
has come). I wanted to publish this list to let you all know what has come
about in the last day or so. Several questions were also asked, so I will

I may have missed a bid...I have a lot of e-mail; don\'t worry, I have saved
most of it, so I will review all offers later (it\'s 4:30 am, so I\'m going to
bed). The individual bids run the total revenue to $131, so right now the
"lot" will not sell below that price. I didn\'t expect such a furvor (I truly
have been far, far away from role playing and Traveller for a long time, I
really did not know what to expect). Please continue letting me know what you
want. A "lot" bid wins if it outranks the total of the individual bids,
otherwise the inventory will be split up.
I must state that I prefer selling the entire inventory, but will hold it
until I see the last reasonable offer(s). Thanks for being patient. And many
thanks to all the folks letting me know about the various BBS and newsgroups
interested in this stuff. See me at profwelks@aol.com.

5. The Striker books are in the box with the combat tables. The Traveller
box is worn, with a split in one side. All the books are in excellent
condition, some have
faded edges of pages, but otherwise suffer nothing other than shelf wear.

    'body' => 'I am still rather busy designing the vehicles for my TL 14 brigade using
MT rules. Just for fun I have decided to make it a heavy armoured bde
and redesign most vehicles.

All vehicles have the same basic chassis and modular components to
ease maintenance. Turret size may differ. The basic characteristics are:

Main Battlefield Tank: armor 72 and std fusion gun 79/5, top speed=720 km/h
                       (design "probably" completed)
Cavalry Tank: armor 60 and same weaponry as the MBT (the only difference
              is armor), top speed of about 2800 km/h (have to check)
Armoured Personnel Carrier: Armor 40, 1 RPA-14, crew=2, + 10 troopers
                            can operate with both the above tanks
Antitank vehicle: Armor 40 and pulse laser TL13 - 250 MW (to be designed yet)
AirDefence: armor 40, 1 RPA14 and 2 BL 47/4

Cbt engineer, EW, C3 etc vehicles will be based on the APC.

The Meson gun vehicle using the 100 ton bay and the Artillery vehicle
using a shipboard Fusion gun (500 MW) have to be designed yet.

The ideas behind these designs are:

i) the Tank should defeat everything and be ideally able to withstand
any attack. In practice armor 80 would be preferred but then to keep
the displacement to 10 tons, one would have had a sitting duck or
a ludicrously expensive thing (with the lighter grav modules).
ii) the Cavalry Tank is not too unlike the French AMX-13 or the Italian
Centauro. The can kill a good tank but would be wiped out by a bad tank..
Reco and quick actions are their tasks.
iii) the APC is supposed to resist infantry weapons (FGMP-14) and
penetrate any battledress. It carries a fully equipped squad.
iv) the antitank vehicle is based on the idea that it may be useful to
have something able to kill a tank using a low signature weapon (compared
to the fusion gun..). I am not sure it is really useful, but I like
the WWII german panzerjaeger vehicle....
v) air defence vehicles are meant to deal with various high flying 
stuff and shells. [note that all vehicles will have their own point
defence weapons]. 
vi) every few days the vehicles will have to be refuelled. Even with
more fuel there would not be room anyway for prolongued occupancy.
vii) 40 is the minimum armor (by the way if radiations are the reason
why armor 40 is required for starships, a vacuum world would have
the same requirement..).

The bde I proposed should allow one to test the relative benefits of
slow (720 km/h..) tanks versus fast tanks. Also it should be interesting
to see whether at TL14 number beats quality, that is good tanks can be
defeated by larger numbers of Intrepida tanks.

Is there interest in this stuff? at some stage I\'ll have to decide 
whether to post the designs or distribute them only to those interested..
(if any).

you embargo gauss rounds? All you need is the metal and a mercenary company

embargo ACR rounds because you not only need the metal (which also needs
more complicated equipment to form the shells), but the chemicals to fuel

I haven\'t looked at MT, CT, or Striker rules recently enough to have any
idea what precisely these stats me, but if they incorporate movement mods
are taken into account, my bets are on a Cavalry tank beating an MBT. Same
gun, almost four times as fast but with only 20% less armor? AS I said, I
don\'t know the rules but just from these stats I\'d bet on the Cavalry
winning the day, at least one-on-one.

>The Meson gun vehicle using the 100 ton bay and the Artillery vehicle

Uhhh. . .isn\'t a fusion gun a direct fire weapon, and artillery indirect by
definition?

I.	BATTLEFIELD MESON ACCELERATORS

Excerpt from Striker [Mk 1]:

"Battlefield meson accelerators are introduced at tech level 15." (page 5)

"The firing sheaf is a circle centred on the MPI (after deviation), with a
radius equal to the weapon=92s burst size...A meson accelerator may fire=
 with
less than its stated burst size; if so, the fire mission order must state
the new burst size." (page 5)

The MPI is the Mean Point of Impact; ie. the centre of the fired shot.

The stats for the TL 15 battlefield meson accelerator are:

Power:	250 MW input
Volume:	15 m3
Weight:	15 tons
Price:	MCr 10
Burst Size:	10 cm
Crew Req=92d:	6
(Striker Book 3, page 39)

Note that Striker scale is 1 cm =3D 10 m. Therefore, 10 cm =3D 100 m radius;=
 200
m diameter. Max Stiavelli was exactly accurate in terms of danger space.
Next time, I=92ll look up the stats instead of going by memory!

II.	MT BATTLEFLEET ARRIVAL IN-SYSTEM

Max Stiavelli writes:
>	I\'ve always assumed that a fleet will reach a system scattered in space
and time. This makes fleet operations even more difficult.

DGP recognised this problem, and came up with a revision that said (roughly)
that one ship would work out the jump calculations for the fleet, all would
jump together, and this would result in ships arriving within minutes of
each other. If you want me to, I will fish through my magazines and give you
the exact ruling.

III.	RE-WORKING TRAVELLER

Steve Lieb writes:
>	Is it just me, or is Traveller in need of a serious reworking=
 scientifically?

I thought that this IS what TNE was all about: that the game did not
correspond to reality, so change the game.

(As an aside) My beef with this is what I want to use the rules _for_. TNE
is more of a _simulation_ than a game. For an example of what I mean:
Harpoon is a _simulation_. It uses real-life stats and converts them to game
terms (and uses them so well that the US Navy uses the game for basic
wargames). However, this causes problems when you play:

a.	"Low-tech" troops and equipment do not stand a chance (as in reality);
b.	It is difficult to balance opposing forces in order to have a good "game"
(as opposed to a walk-over by one side).

Now, I don=92t (necessarily) dislike "reality" in a game - I want enough to
make it believable, but not enough to overpower it - I mean, this is a GAME,
not REALITY - that is the point, surely? If you played out "Die Hard 2"
using TNE, what you would get is "Die Frequently" (as an aside, my wife -
who is not overly fond of the DH movies - wants the 4th one to be called
"Just Die, Would You?!").

We can suspend disbelief and allow transporters in Star Trek - or allow
magic and fantastic monsters in AD&D - without worrying about the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle, or the conservation of energy, or the inverse square
law! Why can=92t this extend to SF? No, I do not advocate going as far as
Space Opera or Buck Rogers, although those type of games can be fun. I want
_harder_ SF than that.

However, the TNE rules seem to be over-complicated for a GAME. I believe
that GDW has made a marketing decision to allow themselves to be pushed into
a niche market. They now have the most realistic game system on the market
today (even if you include the errata - or perhaps BECAUSE of the errata!) -
but it appeals to a very small market because of its realism (and therefore
complexity). Look at what people are buying: apart from the Magic cardgame,
they are buying ROLEplaying games. These usually favour characterisation and
scenarios over rules - often, a GM can dispense with dice for entire=
 sessions.

At this point I will note what Derek Wildstar (wildstar@qrc.com) said in
digest 289:
>	If you want to play Star-Trek-like or Star-Wars-like games, Traveller: The
New Era isn\'t the right tool for the job.

And what Andrew Richard Doull (adou01@cs.auckland.ac.nz) said in Digest 292:
>	I feel GDW are closest to the gaming community when it comes to explaining
why they made their design decisions, and recognising a mistake when they
make one.

OK, so GDW are good guys in that they take notice of what people say, and
maybe I should just use the background (which I love) with another set of
rules. I have created a system based on (don\'t laugh) AD&D (cut in with a
bit of Buck Rogers), for one of my Traveller groups who prefer heroics to
realism...so, back to POW! WHAP! BASH!

IV. FREIGHT VS CARGO

In xboat 289, Robert Brennan wrote:
>       ...in MT there is mention of both freight and cargos but the two
seem confused...
I believe that that "freight" is other people\'s cargo! That is, "cargo" is
what you can buy, with all the requisite modifiers. Freight is what you
transport for other people, at a fixed price (Cr 1000/ton, isn\'t it?).

V. TRAVELLER FAQ - COPYRIGHT LAW IN THE USA

In xboat 290, Andy Lilly suggested that:

Honestly, I agree. That\'s why I have tried to have enough in the brigade
also for a Cavalry combat group. Some time ago, I have designed a TL16 grav 
tank (see http://astro.sns.it/~mstiavel/Traveller/Equip.html for the data)
meant for the Imperial Guard and other elite and they were similar to the
Cavalry tank in philosophy.. 
Still I would like to test it extensively.

>..artillery indirect by definition?

I think that indirect fire is simply superior to direct nowadays and that\'s
why artillery came to be identified with indirect fire. It did not use to
be so in Napoleon\'s time I think..Since at TL14 one does not have indirect
fire energy weapons except for the meson gun and that\'s very expensive I
thought to give some additional direct support.

That would be great. Combined with the speed of light spatial error
it would help understanding how accurate jump really is..

  My players like the little touches which give a game a feel of
  realism - things like printing mission orders on standard forms, 
  and sticking those forms into a standard folder.  Things like 
  NPCs having noticeable quirks.  Things like foreign languages
  being written in non-Latin characters.

  It\'s feeding that last one that can really make a difference - 
  especially if the foreign orthography you choose to use is 
  consistent with the "feel" of the information you have on the 
  language you\'re using it to represent.

  For example, _Rats_and_Cats_ has Aslan male script as a flowing,
  ornate script with lots of curlicues.  Tamil and Malayalam both
  work well for that.  The female script is more angular - but in 
  keeping with the general feel of Aslan society, I\'ve chosen to
  use Arabic/Farsi to represent it - it\'s more angular than Tamil
  or Malayalam, but it still has the same kind of feel that I
  associate with Aslan society.  Another alternative for either
  might be to use a "Tengwar" font from JRR Tolkien\'s elvish
  languages.

  Vargr languages probably vary as much as Vargr polities do.  But
  because of the basic shape of the face and the structure of the 
  vocal apparatus, all of them are likely to have many harsh sounds,
  and lack softer sounds, especially the sibilants.  Almost any 
  "angular" charactery will work for that, from Japanese Kata-kana
  through Old Norse runic to "Klingon" representations.

  Vilani is a very formalized language, even in its current demotic
  koine form, in keeping with their social attitudes.  Devanagari
  works well to convey the kind of feel I get from it, with 
  Traditional Chinese or Korean hangul the best second choices.
  (N.B. The same can be said of the Newt/Bwap tongue, if you play
  with Newts.  Don\'t select similar-looking alphabets for Newts and 
  Vilani.)

  Zhodani was a tough one.  It "feels" more like Polish than
  anything else, for some reason, which makes it a slavic language.  
  OK, let\'s use the Cyrillic alphabet - but don\'t use any letters 
  that bear a strong resemblance to Latin alphabet letters, and use 
  similarly non-latin characters from the Greek alphabet to fill in.

  For Galanglic, naturally, I use the standard latin alphabet, in a
  font suitable for the purpose.  Representation of older dialects 
  of Galanglic (Anglic, English, etc.) I generally try to render in
  a font that looks "old fashioned" - perhaps Goudy Old Style for
  something dating back to the Rule of Man, Fraktur or blackletter
  for something dating back before Terran Confederation days, or
  pre-starflight.  The further back you go, the more you should vary
  spelling - mutate consonants (d to/from t, f to/from v, etc.), 
  add or remove aspirants (h, w), and so on.  With a little work, 
  including contextual analysis, your characters should be able to 
  dope it out, just like you or I can manage Middle English, or 
  someone with both Modern English and Modern German can figure out 
  a good amount of modern Dutch or Afrikaans. 

  Minor race tongues I look at on a case-by-case basis. only as 
  needed.

  Just tossing out some ideas.  Comments?

Oh, but what if your players can read one or both of these alphabets?
Some of mine can. This problem goes for all the other languages
you\'ve mentioned too. Don\'t get me wrong, I think it\'s a cool idea.
Maybe one should invent new alphabets instead. I\'ve done a couple
for one of my friends\' Warhammer Fantasy campaign and I thought it
was fun. Ok, maybe you won\'t think that.

But this raises another problem: If you write handouts in a language
or alphabet that the PCs are supposed to be able to read, but the
players aren\'t, at the very best they\'ll have to sit down and decipher
it all, which seems wrong when the PCs can read it without effort.
Also: is this fun? Some players seem to think it is, and some don\'t.
Personally I don\'t think it\'s fun, but I\'ll have to admit that it adds
great flavor to a game.

I like the idea with mutated spelling. I think I\'ll remember to use that
once. I don\'t know about the fonts, though. First of all, players
shouldn\'t get assosiations to medieval times or something like that,
when they are reading a text from the Rule of Man.
.
Another thing: Is galanglic written with latin letters at all? 3000 years
is a lot of time for an alphabet to mutate. Illustrations, especially from
DGP, seems to indicate that galanglic letters aren\'t to similar to latin
letters.

In my game galanglic is a language decendant from english, but it
isn\'t english more than danish sounds like the old nordic tongue.
It seems reasonable that ordinary people of the Imperium will be able
to read texts written some hundreds years ago, yes maybe even back
to the beginning of the Imperium, but not from across the Long Night.

But anyway, thanks for the article, which I thought was inspiring and
recieved the rare honor of being saved to my harddisk.

As a GM who (i): has recently returned-to-the-classic-Traveller-fold 
(my home-grown campaign concluded [?] *way* back in 1988), and (ii): 
has only just the other day discovered this list, there are several 
observations/questions I would pose.

For several years now a thought has been niggling at me. Traveller 
seemed to lack something - and that something was a 3rd dimension to 
the universe. As an abstract, the official Traveller universe existed 
soley as a linear concept. For example: the Spinward Main moved in a 
series of straight lines from flat subsector map to flat subsector map 
(and there\'s nothing at all wrong with this). 

However, with the simple addition of several maps above (and below) a 
subsector, the Universe becomes 3 dimensional (cubic space). This, of 
course, can be a boon for (i): jump-1 Free Traders, as a whole new 
network of feeder routes will open up; (ii): budding AstroNavigators;
or (iii): GM\'s when a misjump catapultes a ship that random 6d6 number 
of parsecs off course :)  The best way to represent such a working 
model is to photocopy the requesite number of subsector maps (3 is 
good, 5 is better) onto acetate and to layer them one atop the other. 
It adds a whole new dimension to the game ...

As there have doubtlessly been many refinements to classic Traveller 
in the field of Trade and Economics, are there any Digests I should 
look at in particular? My campaign is *very* much a Merchant Prince 
one [I think that PC\'s discharged weapons maybe half a dozen times in 
6 years of campaigning - and I\'d like to keep it that way, thank you 
:)] in a home-grown universe based on Anderson, Cherryh, Norton, et 
al. Any other Merchant Princes out there?

My second question relates to computers. Since Traveller was 
published, computers have progressed way beyond the simple models 
represented (especially in the fields of capacity, and performance). 
Could anyone please point me in the direction of new material/updates 
et cetera regards computers in the *classic* Traveller universe [my 
finances don\'t stretch that far to purchasing MT or New Generation - 
even secondhand :(]

Thanking you in advance.

Regards,

     This is true, but for ease of use, I\'ve decided to apply a fair degree 
     of suspension of disbelief.  One way _I\'m_ able to rationalize it is 
     that even though the starmaps appear 2d, one can argue that the 
     planets are actually set "above" and "below" each other to a fair 
     degree.  While liberal use of the Pythagorean Theorem and laws of 
     cosines and sines could give you an accurate figure, let\'s face it, 
     Traveller\'s jump drive rules are relatively inexact.
     
     I\'d like to think that the Traveller universe already _is_ 3d, but 
     that the maps just show a slightly myopic depiction of what\'s actually 
     in space.
     
     I guess it all depends on the level of detail you want to have.  For 
     me, all the mathematical calculations takes away from what I really 
     want to do:  roleplay.

    Hiya. On a long car trip (in which I wasn\'t driving)
I sat down and began writing a "alphabet generation system"
for traveller. Once I had that I thought I would then write
the software to go with my sysgen stuff to generate unique
alphabets for each ethnic region. I haven\'t got much further
than the back of an envelope design but you sound like you
would be interested.

Alphabetic representation:
    In general a written symbols can be used for individual sounds
(english), just vowels (?), just consonents (hebrew), syllables
(korean), whole words (mandarin), or whole sentances (?). A
writing system will mainly consist of one of these methods.

Alphabetic grouping:
    Generally symbols will be grouped at one level higher than
their representation. I.e. if individual sounds are represented
then spaces are more likely to occur between words. If words
are represented then spaces are more likely to occur between
sentences, etc. But not always.

Punctuation:
    Punctuation may occur to several different levels. Paragraph,
Sentence, phrase, word, or syllable. A special case is in either
a all consonent or all vowel language where punctuation can
indicate the unrepresented vowels or consonents.

Alphabetic form:
    What do the characters look like? I thought of four general
classifications: Caligraphic (Kanji, Arabic), Typographic (most
roman fonts), Pictographic (Hiroglphics), or Digital (Braille).

    Anyone interested in fleshing this out into a more formal
generation system? If I like it I may even encode it in a font
generation program...

    This has been discussed before. I\'ll give a brief summary
of what I remember and then state my own views:
    1) Rationalisation: Space really is 3D but the physics
of jump-space are 2D. Thus the 2D maps are really of where systems
appear in jump-space rather than real space.
    2) Rationalisation: Space really is 3D but it is a bugger
to map so for the game\'s sake we use 2D.
    3) Rationalisation: Jump drive technology only works well
in planes parallel to the galactic plane. Several "parallel planes"
exist, the Imperium occupies only one. The others are only reachable
by STL drive.
    4) Refusal to rationalise: run it 3D.

    I run my game 3D. I have for a number of years and have
not found it a problem for my players. Mind you I use the
Sysgen software for my campaign background so I don\'t have to
worry about the massive amount of generation you need.
    As jump drives increase the number of stars you can reach
increased by the cube rather than the square. This generally
makes borders rather untenable. At the moment my characters are
moving from my equivalent of The Imperium to my equivalent of
the Solomani Confederacy. The two are currently at war but
there is no firm battle line. Rather just a increasing probability
as one moves in a general direction that each individual system will
be one or other.
    Another effect is that even if you are low-jump, the number
of worlds you can get to in 4 jumps is vast. Say you are looking
for a TechLevel-G world with a hydrographics greater than 4.
The odds are it will be within 4 to 6 jump-2s. No problem.
As I said above, you really need some form of automatic generation
to keep up with where the players can go.

>My campaign is *very* much a Merchant Prince one in a
>home-grown universe based on Anderson, Cherryh, Norton,
>et al. Any other Merchant Princes out there?
    My campaign has also been largely trade based. Again,
I use more software to manage this. When I ran it on
Tuesday they actually did get involved in a fire-fight
and is was more a question of "Use the lasers, those
bloody missiles cost 10,000 a shot!".
    [I\'m a big Cherryh-fan too and my campaign bears
much from her influence. Love to chat about it off-line
if you like. BTW: The Internet Cherryh Mailing list is
run from jaymin@maths.tcd.ie. Send a message saying you
would like to subscribe to it to that address. Plug plug.]

>Since Traveller was published, computers have progressed
>way beyond the simple models represented
    So? In our own era we have seen computers get
significanly more powerfull. My desktop machine at work
is about 40 times more powerful than the mini that my
whole college department ran off of. However, back then
I could write a simple "input three parameters and do a
basic calc" program and it would be about 4K. Now to
do the same with my tools at work results in something of
about 60-90K.
    Sure, hardware has improved, but in general software
has expanded to fill the gaps. I have absolutely no
problem with computers in traveller, and I\'m a computer
professional! If you want to search a database, the
algorithyms may be better, and the software faster, but
you can damn well bet the database will also be several
orders of magnitude larger. Just look at the net today,
compared to 10 years ago. There is a lot more out there,
but not that much more of interest (for me, anyway :-).

 Yes, that can be a problem.  It\'s one that I haven\'t run into, 
 because my players are knowledgeable in Latin-alphabet languages 
 only.  Obviously, you would want to adjust your choices for your 
 players.  Or, just remind them that this is _not_ Russian or Greek 
 or... and that the idea is that the document should _look_ 
 authentic.  As far as inventing alphabets, that\'s a great idea.  
 But it takes a certain kind of creative talent that I lack.

 Usually, I\'ll provide a simple typed translation into Player

 Actually, they probably _should_.  Remember that to a Second 
 Imperial Millennium citizen, the Rule of Man was a _long_ time ago
 - even farther back than the Long Night, which _ended_ about as 
 long ago as the Founding of Christianity is to your players.  In 
 this case, I\'m not looking for a specific feel - just a relative

 Granted.  But since my players are fluent in English, and their

 just map them onto each other.

 Actually, once you have widespread printing, in large quantities, 
 the form of the letters will not change much, since you have so 
 much preserved material.  Look how little changed the Latin 
 alphabet has changed in 2,000 years - and Chinese hasn\'t changed 
 in even longer...

Not intended for use in \'line\' operations, the Kristin is used to escort
fleet auxilliaries and tankers during normal operations.  The Kristin can
also serve as a commerce raider in wartime, it\'s relatively high agility
allowing it to strike quickly against lightly armed targets.



Solomani TL 13 Fleet Tender (40000 t) \'Fer Galinin\' Class

The Fer Galinin is used as a resupply / tender vessel to support extended
fleet operations.  The ship carries 10 non-jump capable 400t fuellers for
skimming fuel, and a large on-board purification plant.  Cargo and fuel are
carried in 600t modules attatched to the exterior of the ships\' dispersed
structure hull.

The Interstel Type 6B fueller is used for fuel skimming operations in
conjunction with fleet tenders and tankers.  The boat is capable of skimming
fuel from both gas giant and oceanic environments.  Each Type 6B can carry
378 tons of fuel as cargo.

Most of the (3D) Pshfwallha Rift sector my campaign was/will be set 
in had been manually plotted and rolled up *long* ago! By using the 
*Scouts* system/density generation rules I was able to keep things 
relatively sparse - approximately 120 systems per subsector [400 
cubic parsecs]. Needless to say, it became necessary to scale down 
the size of a sector to just 4 subsectors - however, it still 
measures a respectable 1 600 cubic ps. Where can one obtain this 
Sysgen software? (Remember, I haven\'t gamed Traveller since 1988.)

Which is exactly my point. A Traveller Model/1 computer is rated as 
TL 5 (1900-39, which makes it the equivilant of a glorified adding 
machine!). And this is the model used in a standard Free-Trader 
straight \'from the yard\'?  Model/1 has a cpu of 2, and an additional 
storage capacity of 4. Therefore, because the cpu has a capacity of 2, 
only 2 programmes can be run together (multitasking?)

To quote from Deluxe Traveller (page: 70): "During the computer 
reprogramming phase, specific programs may be removed from the 
computer and others inserted.  ... both jump-1 and navigation would 
be required for the performance of an interstellar jump. Both 
programmes would be fed into the computer during the programming 
phase, but only after sufficient space had been cleared (perhaps by 
removing the maneuver and auto-evade programmes)."

Now I\'m writing this on a 486SX-25 with 8 Meg of RAM (not particularly
grunty I\'ll admit) from home. But with it I can work one application 
in Windows *and* have UUPOLL access my server, download email and 
news, unbatch it, and let me know there\'s mail. That\'s the equivilant 
of a cpu of 2. The idea that in the Far Future programmes have to be 
physically(?) removed before beginning another set of tasks smacks of 
the good ol\' days(?) of the Spectrum ZX (which is about the time when 
Traveller was originally written).

Which is again my point. Today\'s hardware has improved to the point 
where my 486 at work handles 6 extremely powerful graphics programmes. 
And what about networking? And the gigabyte computer? The computer
technology presented in Traveller is seriously outdated and IMHO needs 
to be upgraded. Or ... do I have it all wrong?

in the same class as RSDean\'s (?) "Small Bulk Freighter" from
the archives. I\'ve done out the following two ships for
comparison for them...

Pesago Express

CraftID: Pesago Express Freighter, TL15, MCr802.346
   Hull: 3688/9219, Disp=4097t, Config=4SL, Armour=40G,
         Loaded=58050, Unloaded=13480

  Other: Fuel=901t, Cargo=2400t, Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purefier(24h)
         ObjSize=Average, EmmLevel=Moderate

    The Pesago is the low end freighter meeting a maneuver-2,
jump-3 requirement. It has an operating cost of 1212Cr per ton
per fortnight (730 if it scoops its own fuel). Although it cannot
compete on jump-1 runs, express freight contracts over a jump-3
usually give it a tidy profit margin.
    There is no surplus power for any armament. If armament is
desired a supplementary power suply must be added or else forgo
the maneuver-2 preformance.


Nakar Freight Runner

CraftID: Nakar Armed Freighter, TL15, MCr1109.008
   Hull: 3800/9501, Disp=4223t, Config=1AF, Armour=40G,
         Loaded=60124, Unloaded=15183
  Power: 43/108, Fusion=11678MW, Duration=30/90
   Loco: 190/475, Maneuver=2, 152/380, Jump=3, Cruise=2138kph,
         Max=2850kph, Agility=6
Sensors: EMS Active (Planetary), EMS Passive (Substellar),
         ActObjScan=Diff, ActObjPin=Diff, PassEngScan=Rout,

  Accom: Crew=17 (2 bridge, 3 engineer, 9 gunner, 2 command),
         Staterooms=17, Env=all
  Other: Fuel=929t, Cargo=2400t, Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purefier(24h)
         ObjSize=Average, EmmLevel=Moderate

    The Nakar is one of a class of armed freighters designed
for service on the fringe. Its jump-3 allows access to most
worlds in undeveloped areas and its maneuver-2, high agility,
and heavy armament give it a survival edge in regions not
patroled by the Navy.
    Ships of this class are seldom seen in civilised space.
The running costs are simply too high. The fortnightly costs
require a profit of 1477Cr to be made from each ton of cargo
space. Unattainable through freight contracts and very difficult
to achieve, especically for the quantities in question, for
speculation.
    However, if you assume wilderness refueling for all operations
the required profit per ton drops to 980. A very narrow margin
for freight contracts but a potential nice earner if under
subsidy from colony worlds.

Minor correction which might be of interest to the orthographers on
this list.  Korean uses a phonetic alphabet, making it more like
English than Chinese.  Groups of these characters are arranged to make
syllables, and groups of syllables make words.  Because of this
arrangement, written Korean looks like each syllable is a separate
character, but it just looks that way because you\'re used to words
being composed of characters.  Each syllable is further broken down
into its own characters, so Korean words are composed of syllables
which are composed of characters.

Because it\'s phonetic, there\'s no question about how a written word is
pronounced, and very little uncertainty about how a spoken word is
written, which accounts for the 99% literacy rate in both South and
North Korea.  Once you learn the alphabet, you can pretty much read
and write in Korean.

This is something I have neglected recently. In one campaign
years ago I generated a sort of language with the aid of a computer
program so that one of the players (who like his character was an
archaeologist
expert in ancient history and languages) could have fun decrypting it.
It was fun to play it but it really takes a Tolkien to invent a new
language...
(I had a two way converter converting words from english to the new
language and back, without keeping the same number of characters, it was
based on prime number congruences with some extras. The alphabet I used
was ..Etruscan.....[He immediately recognized it..]).

On a different subject, has anybody understood the logic behind having local
nobles interfering with the Navy? I was shocked when I read that in rebellion
(I had not realized it was that bad until that time..). History tells us
that one of the best ways to achieve complete failure in a military mission
is to have the politicians influence the military (see, e.g., Winston
Churchill during WW I..).

If the influence of politicians is so large, one could also understand why
the Imperial Ships (as sketched in Shattered Ships) are so expensive and
inefficient. In my Universe the first thing Norris has done as a Grand Duke
is to protect the military from political/noble interference and to
start designing/building new more efficient battleships.

Modular Combat Vehicle System

The MCVS has been developed jointly by the Imperial Army and the Lilad 
(Deneb 1135) to equip Lilad Army  aggressor brigades. These units were used
in joint exercise conducted during the year 1090-1100.

All items are at TL 14.

The basic principles of the MCVS scheme is that all combat vehicles are
based on identical modular components, so as to ease maintenance and repair.

The basic components are:

Fusion Power generator: 14kl 42 tons 7 Mcr 126 MW

Std Gravity Thrust: 505 10.1 kl 20.2 tons 1.01 Mcr 50.5 MW

Communication and Sensor pack, including Cont Radio Reg*2. LaserComm, Reg.*2
	MaserComm Reg*2, EMSActive Cont*2, EMSPassive Cont*2, EMSJammer, Neural
	activity sensor Long*2, High Pen Densit.(250m)*2, Neutrino Sensor 10kw*2
	Pass Audio, Active Audio, Environ., Magnetic, Radiation, TL 14 Avionics
	9.6688 kl, 2.3424 tons 2.3209 Mcr 1.5194 MW

Decoy pack including prismatic aerosol*2, sandcaster*2
	0.022 kl 0.032 tons 2.54 kcr, 0.016 MW

Environment pack including BasicEnv, BasicLS, ExtendedLS, GravPlates,
Inertial
	Comp. for 10 tons hull
	10.53 kl 13.23 tons 0.1701 Mcr, 9.99 MW

Control Pack including 3/fib*2 computers 3 hololiked 3 holoHUD EC protection
	19.09 kl 8.04 tons 0.4719 Mcr 0.052 MW

These packs and the hull shape are common to all vehicles.

This MBT is a heavyly armoured sitting duck compared to other TL14 tanks,
it was designed to test on the battlefield the comparative efficiency of
armor
versus speed at high TLs. The vehicle cost would have been lower had a
non airframe hull been used. It is designed to have a fair chance of
surviving all rapid pulse fusion gun available at TL15 or lower and all but
the heaviest non rapid pulse fusion guns.

Designed to deploy a standard imperial squad of 10 men it can operationally
replace the Astrin APC. It is used as the basis for many other vehicles and
has been designed to be able to operate in space and survive any man-portable

weapon system.
Its twin RPA-14 guns are adequate to fire against battle dress equipped
troops,
and also against lightly armoured tanks like the Trepida. In addition they
serve as point defence against missile fire.

 I most certainly would.  In your design, though, you want to 
 remember that languages evolve, and that the form of the language, 
 both written and spoken, depends much on the mindset of the
 culture that is writing/speaking the language - or, sometimes, on 
 the mindset of the culture being hired as historians or 
 bookkeepers.  An example of the latter is modern Mongolian, which 
 bears a strong resemblance to vertically-written Arabic - because 
 at some point, the Mongols hired Arabic-speaking people to act as 
 record keepers.

 Also consider that mass written communication is going to have a 
 simplifying influence on the written language - compare, for 
 example, the blackletter type of the Gutenberg Bible with the
 simple Times of the Times.  Or "modern" Simplified Chinese in use 
 in the People\'s Republic, as compared to the Traditional Chinese 
 in use in the Republic (Taiwan).  Or even the two Japanese kana 
 sets as compared to the more traditional Kanji.

 True, with the caveat that there may or may not be a one-to-one 
 mapping of phonemes to glyphs in the alphabetical representations.
 Similar comments hold for the syllabaries or pictographics.  I\'m
 not aware of any languages that map sentences into single glyphs, 
 although I am given to understand that a single word in Inuktitut
 may in fact express an entire sentence concept.

X::>Alphabetic grouping:

 Very true.  Traditional Chinese springs to mind here; until 
 recently, even punctuation wasn\'t used.  Sentence/concept breaks 
 were implied from context.  It makes for a very dense printed 
 representation.

X::>Punctuation:
 ::>    Punctuation may occur to several different levels. Paragraph,
 ::>Sentence, phrase, word, or syllable. A special case is in either

 ::>indicate the unrepresented vowels or consonents.

 Except that those are not called punctuation, \\per se\\; those are 
 called "diacritics" or "lentition marks".  Punctuation is a
 contextual aid, not a pronunciation aid.

X::>Alphabetic form:

 As long as you allow for hybrids of these, I see nothing wrong 
 with these classifications.

 If you choose to go the diacritical/lentition route, remember that
 most of the marks have their origins in "shorthand" writing of the 
 basic forms of the letter.  For instance, the circumflex over many 
 French vowels is believed to have its origins in a superscripted
 script "s", and the umlaut similarly started as a superscripted
 "e".

Note: I have not tried to design optimal vehicles (for instance it would
      be rather easy to improve the MBT) but rather to get a consistent
      and plausible set of vehicles. I am sure that most designs could be
      improved (or dropped) after being tested in battle.

      The values of Top speed listed correspond to the Top Vacuum speed
      of the MT Referee manual (that of course does not make sense). Top
      speed in a standard atmosphere is limited to 90 per cent of the
      quoted value.

The reason is, the nobles that have "insinuated" themselves into the chain
of command *are* the local civilian Imperial government.  Here in the USA,
we have civilian control of the military through President as commander-in-
chief.  In the Imperium, the reigning Emperor can\'t directly control the
entire military due to the communications lag, so he is forced to delegate
these powers to the dukes of the marches, who know the Imperial eye is on
them if they mess up.  It helps that many of these high nobles were in the
navy themselves -- if Norris hadn\'t been Duke of Regina, his career path
suggests that he might have had Frederick Santanocheev\'s job and rank 
during the 5FW.  Also note that Norris, as a subsector duke, did not have
enough authority to override the sector or vice admirals until *after*
he recieved near-Imperial powers from Strephon\'s Imperial Warrant -- the
old 5FW board game simulates this.  Offhand, I\'m not sure if he was able
to override even fleet admirals (one-stars in 5FW) before he got the 
Warrant.  I suspect that the high nobles know what they can and can\'t tell
the admirals to do -- and if not, they\'ll have it "carefully explained" to
them by their liege when they complain about not being listened to.  The
dukes also help raise the subsector colonial navies, so they get some input
that way too.  

The Imperium judged that having powerful, independent Grand Admirals at the
domain level was a failure -- they tried that before the Civil War, and it
was one of the things that Arbellatra abolished afterward.  Local direction
of the IN was given to the sector and subsector dukes, and the archducal 
level was cut out altogether, at least partly to avoid turning the domain
archdukes into what the Grand Admirals had been.  Of course, the dukes still
owe fealty to the archdukes, so this power *is* available to the domain
government, it just has more checks on it.   It\'s probable that "modern"
Imperial Grand Admirals don\'t have direct control of troop formations but
create policy.  The megacorps face a similar problem in their operations.
If it\'s all working, it\'s a carefully crafted balance of powers between
the civilian government and the Navy, and the nobles and the Emperor,
designed to keep the Imperium together.

It could be argued that the big mistake made by Strephon and his advisors
was in strengthening the archducal power in an attempt to strengthen the
civilian Imperial government.  It wasn\'t entirely his fault -- it failed 
because the people he trusted also failed.

before, please forgive me...

Prof. Lenat at Stanford University developed an AI program. Lenat trained 
this system, EURISKO, to produce Trillion Credit Squadron designs and 
compare them in combat against each other. Drexler continues (p73, OUP edn):

"Lenat and EURISKO entered the 1981 national Traveller TCS tournament 
with a strange-looking fleet. The other contestants laughed at it, then 
lost to it. The Lenat/EURISKO fleet won every round, emerging as the 
national champion. As Lenat notes, `This win is made more significant by 
the fact that no-one connected with the program had ever played the game 
before the tournament, or seen it played, and there were no practice 
rounds.\'

"In 1982 the competition sponsors changed the rules. Lenat and EURISKO 
entered a very different fleet. Other contestants again laughed at it, 
then lost. Lenat and EURISKO again won the national championship.

"In 1983 the competition sponsors told Lenat that if he entered and won 
again, the competition would be cancelled. Lenat bowed out."


The question is, did JTAS ever publish notes on the winning squadrons, 
and if so, what did they say? [Did they ever publish stats for the 
winning squadrons, as half-threatened, or were they too embarrased?]

I would expect that minor differences would be present but that the

Alternatively, it can be used to refuel vehicles on the battlefield by
using interior collapsible tanks (44 kl) and external drop tanks (up to
135 kl, is considered only streamlined when using them).
A similar vehicle including a 35.1 kl drone hangar is used also by
cbt engineers.
A modified version of this vehicles is used for C3I duties. rather than
robot arms, collapsible tanks and the crane, the interior cargo space is
used as a control room for 4 additional crewmembers and an additional
control pack and sensor pack.

balance in Imperium. I think it all makes a lot of sense in the
Imperium during peace time. During wartime, however, I still remain
sceptical. In my universe the Deneb Domain manages to successfully
fight off Aslan and Vargr during the Rebellion thanks to coordination
between the various Sector Forces, a similar coordination requires
homogenuous unit types and similar combat training. They all turn
out easier to obtain if there is a unique command. 

I have understood that e.g. the Duke of Lanth cannot stop the Imperial
fleet based there from being repositioned somewhere else, but can he 
interfere on what battleship types are built? or can the Duke/Granduke
of the Spinward Marches interfere on moving a fleet from Trin to Guzulin?
or on battleship design issues? or on budgetary issues?

I believe that in order to achieve something one needs a political 
decision at the start and no political interference from then on..
otherwise one ends up with things like the United Nations mission in
former Yugoslavia or a nice empty tunnel in  the middle of Texas, several
million dollars down the drain and formerly SSC employees looking for 
another job..
Regardless of what one may think of NASA achievements for instance,
the fact that NASA has to fight for money every year makes it very hard
for ESA to collaborate with it, since most space projects last for 
several years.
 
These issues would be similar for organizations spanning several months
of travel time. If one sector decides to change power plants bolting
techniques without the rest of Imperium doing it, this will cause
problems when ships from other sectors will operate there...
The same if they all start introducing a new model and somebody changes
his mind half way through..

Is it really possible to combine efficiency and local political control?

I.=09BATTLEFIELD MESON ACCELERATORS

Excerpt from Striker [Mk 1]:

"Battlefield meson accelerators are introduced at tech level 15." (page 5)

"The firing sheaf is a circle centred on the MPI (after deviation), with a
radius equal to the weapon=92s burst size...A meson accelerator may fire=20
with
less than its stated burst size; if so, the fire mission order must state
the new burst size." (page 5)

The MPI is the Mean Point of Impact; ie. the centre of the fired shot.

The stats for the TL 15 battlefield meson accelerator are:

Power:=09250 MW input
Volume:=0915 m3
Weight:=0915 tons
Price:=09MCr 10
Burst Size:=0910 cm
Crew Req=92d:=096
(Striker Book 3, page 39)

Note that Striker scale is 1 cm =3D 10 m. Therefore, 10 cm =3D 100 m radius=
;
200 m diameter. Max Stiavelli was exactly accurate in terms of danger space=
.
Next time, I=92ll look up the stats instead of going by memory!

II.=09MT BATTLEFLEET ARRIVAL IN-SYSTEM

Max Stiavelli writes:
>=09I\'ve always assumed that a fleet will reach a system scattered in space
and time. This makes fleet operations even more difficult.

DGP recognised this problem, and came up with a revision that said
(roughly) that one ship would work out the jump calculations for the fleet,
all would jump together, and this would result in ships arriving within
minutes of each other. If you want me to, I will fish through my magazines
and give you the exact ruling.

is more of a _simulation_ than a game. For an example of what I mean:
Harpoon is a _simulation_. It uses real-life stats and converts them to gam=
e
terms (and uses them so well that the US Navy uses the game for basic
wargames). However, this causes problems when you play:

a.=09"Low-tech" troops and equipment do not stand a chance (as in reality);
b.=09It is difficult to balance opposing forces in order to have a good
"game" (as opposed to a walk-over by one side).

Now, I don\'=92t (necessarily) dislike "reality" in a game - I want enough t=
o
make it believable, but not enough to overpower it - I mean, this is a GAME=
,
not REALITY - that is the point, surely? If you played out "Die Hard 2"
using TNE, what you would get is "Die Frequently" (as an aside, my wife -
who is not overly fond of the DH movies - wants the 4th one to be called
"Just Die, Would You?!").

We can suspend disbelief and allow transporters in Star Trek - or allow
magic and fantastic monsters in AD&D - without worrying about the Heisenber=
g
Uncertainty Principle, or the conservation of energy, or the inverse square
law! Why can=92t this extend to SF? No, I do not advocate going as far as
Space Opera or Buck Rogers, although those type of games can be fun. I want
_harder_ SF than that.

However, the TNE rules seem to be over-complicated for a GAME. I believe
that GDW has made a marketing decision to allow themselves to be pushed int=
o
a niche market. They now have the most realistic game system on the market
today (even if you include the errata - or perhaps BECAUSE of the errata!) =
-
but it appeals to a very small market because of its realism (and therefore
complexity). Look at what people are buying: apart from the Magic cardgame,
they are buying ROLEplaying games. These usually favour characterisation an=
d
scenarios over rules - often, a GM can dispense with dice for entire sessio=
ns.

At this point I will note what Derek Wildstar (wildstar@qrc.com) said in
digest 289:
>=09If you want to play Star-Trek-like or Star-Wars-like games, Traveller:
The New Era isn\'t the right tool for the job.

And what Andrew Richard Doull (adou01@cs.auckland.ac.nz) said in Digest 292=
:
>=09I feel GDW are closest to the gaming community when it comes to
explaining why they made their design decisions, and recognising a mistake
when they make one.

OK, so GDW are good guys in that they take notice of what people say, and
maybe I should just use the background (which I love) with another set of
rules. I have created a system based on (don\'t laugh) AD&D (cut in with a
bit of Buck Rogers), for one of my Traveller groups who prefer heroics to
realism...so, back to POW! WHAP! BASH!

I believe that that "freight" is other people\'s cargo! That is, "cargo" is
what you can buy, with all the requisite modifiers. Freight is what you
transport for other people, at a fixed price (Cr 1000/ton, isn\'t it?).

Prof. Lenat at Stanford University developed an AI program. Lenat trained
this system, EURISKO, to produce Trillion Credit Squadron designs and
compare them in combat against each other. Drexler continues (p73, OUP edn):

"Lenat and EURISKO entered the 1981 national Traveller TCS tournament
with a strange-looking fleet. The other contestants laughed at it, then
lost to it. The Lenat/EURISKO fleet won every round, emerging as the
national champion. As Lenat notes, `This win is made more significant by
the fact that no-one connected with the program had ever played the game
before the tournament, or seen it played, and there were no practice
rounds.\'

"In 1982 the competition sponsors changed the rules. Lenat and EURISKO
entered a very different fleet. Other contestants again laughed at it,
then lost. Lenat and EURISKO again won the national championship.

"In 1983 the competition sponsors told Lenat that if he entered and won
again, the competition would be cancelled. Lenat bowed out."


The question is, did JTAS ever publish notes on the winning squadrons,
and if so, what did they say? [Did they ever publish stats for the
winning squadrons, as half-threatened, or were they too embarrased?]

No, JTAS never got around to publishing the winning TCS squadrons but they 
did have a few articles about the design of an efficient Trillion Credit 
Squadron.

I do have a listing of TL12 ship designs that are apparently those of a 
winning TCS fleet that I obtained from the HIWG. It\'s rather long so its 
probably better if you email me if you want copy.

This touches upon the subject about where is the distinction
between the political and the militatry forces of society?
Military personnel has (in principle) purely a executive function.
They have to make the decisions about where the ships are
and what they are going to do.

Policy makers, on the other hand, are the persons who decide
upon issues pertaing to the grand perspective. They can take
advise from specialists (navy personnel), but eventually, *they*
are the people who make the decisions. This is what makes
them policy makers.

This means that budgetary issuis, IMHO, are in the hands of
the nobility. This way, they will also have very much to say about
which ships ought to be build. Maybe not in detail, but they are
the ones to decide if the Imperium should build Dreadnoughts,
ordinary Battleships, Battleriders or a lot of Cruisers, for example.

On the other hand, the nobility will have only very little (if any) to
say about strategy and tactics, which is the responsibilty of
high ranking Navy officers.

But the distinction can easily become somewhat blurred: A duke
or archduke might decide that "I want a buffer zone between us
and the Aslan here!" or "Our main priority must be to turn away
Vargr and Aslan incursions, and we\'ll just have to hope that the
Zhos won\'t make any trouble!" These are decisions of strategy,
but as far as I can see reasonably an issue that a noble, and
not a navy officer, should decide upon.

>Is it really possible to combine efficiency and local political control?

Well, no one said that the organization of the Imperium is optimal.
Sometimes, when we discuss this, we tend to forget. When I
write how things are in my campaign, it isn\'t a picture of what I
think is perfect organization, it\'s a picture of how I think the
Imperial society actually works. And I don\'t think it\'s perfect.
Personally, I\'m not very keen on feudal systems, yet this is how the
Imperium works, and this is the way I play it. Complete with corrupt
nobles amidst honorable nobles, incompetent nobles among
competent nobles.

The Imperium is not a Utopia, it\'s a simulation of a real society.

Not as far as I can recall (I have all issues of JTAS since #4, and I
only recall one TCS design article, which does _NOT_ seem to refer to
the Lenat/EURISKO fleets - it was probably written by a later winner).

Personally, I feel that by _not_ publishing the winning squadron designs
GDW did TCS/High Guard players everywhere a disservice - it\'s quite possible
that by studying the designs and the reasons they were so successful that
we could have learned something about the TCS/High Guard system, and
possibly been able to meet the program on it\'s own terms in future
competitions (or at least, exploited the same loopholes in the design
sequence that EURISKO did).

One wonders, though: if the same person (human) had done the winning designs
for two years running, would GDW have barred that person from competing in
subsequent years?

Would anyone happen to know what these designs looked like?

This also points up what I consider to be a major weakness of the High Guard
combat system - there\'s very little "maneuver".  As a High Guard admiral,
your major decisions are what to put in the line versus the reserve (and
when to move ships from one to the other), and to designate targets for your
ship\'s weaponry.  This emphasizes the importance of the ship design, of
course.

An improvement (and in this regard, I _do_ feel that the current offerings
from GDW _are_ an improvement) is to incorporate enough maneuver and other
tactical options that a skilled commander in a merely average ship has a
good chance of besting a merely average commander in a better ship.

BL/BR isn\'t perfect - there should be sufficient design options that if you
_know_ what type of ships your opponent is going to have, you should be able
to design a fleet that will counter it.  (This would have been the best
option for dealing with EURISKO - a smart player, or someone else with
access to a lot of computer time - could design a counterfleet for the
design that the program was most likey to come up with, or possibly EURISKO
would have stated that there was no \'best\' fleet).

This unit is used by quick response teams of the Deneb Imperial Naval
Intelligence. Its high performance is obtained at the price of low
endurance and agility. The main purpose of this ship is not combat
however, but rather intelligence gathering, support of covert missions,
extraction of agents and other similar covert operations.
The vehicles carried depend on the precise mission. Normally they
include fighters, Gcarriers and some special purpose vehicle.

Well, I guess that\'s the whole point of it..

What I was just trying to say is that since it does not make much sense
for politicians to decide whether to buy Dreadnoughts or Cruisers and
then leave the strategy and tactics to the military, I would have
hoped that one of the first steps taken by Norris would have been to
put some reasonable admiral in charge of the Aslan and Vargr operations
completely free of political interference. In my universe Norris himself
supervises the Vargr front and Tranathiaf (sp?) is in charge of the
Aslan front. (not by chance this is the point where my universe and
GDW\'s started to seriously depart from each another).

Also, I am not worried by politicians saying:
"Our main priority must be to turn away Vargr and Aslan incursions, and 
we\'ll just have to hope that the Zhos won\'t make any trouble!"

but rather by them saying:

"aahhh, now that the Aslan and Vargr are attacking us certainly the
Zhos are not expecting a surprise attack, let\'s do that"
or something equally smart.

My preferred view of political control over the military is that the
civilian government says how much money they can spend and the military
spend it. Or may be they present a number of budgetary options. I would
hope that by the 56th century no civilian would look over the budget for
selectively cutting this and that or moving money from something to something
else.

While I agree that the feudal intermixed chain of command is what we are
told Imperium has, I find plausible that it would be rectified asap when
the chance arises..

One serious problem of the Traveller world is that the technological
advancement has not been followed by a similar cultural and political
development. Despite everything the world has evolved a lot in the
last two thousand years. What we seen in Bosnia now, was rather normal
two centuries ago...On average, countries that develop some technology
develop also the cultural background to use it properly. Obviously
there are exceptions, but I think that the trend is rather clear.
Enslaving the population of a defeated city was normal two thousand
years ago. Armies in the middle ages instead were satisfied by sacking the 
city and raping the women. Nowadays, these things are not normal thanks God.

The Rebellion, the succession by right of assassination, etc.. are very
hard to believe in the 56th century.

I read an article about EURISKO in Scientific American or some such mag many

years ago; it leaped out at me because of the discussion of TCS.
As far as the program\'s strategy, all I remember was that the program was  
supposed to have designed fleets that were uniform -- all the ships were  
identical. This meant that the loss of any one ship caused no loss of
features  
from the fleet, only a proportionate loss in firepower.

I\'ve never played TCS, so can anyone comment as to whether this is a chestnut

of TCS design or a useful design concept?

  I\'m not sure about posting to a Web site, since this is copyright

designs to anyone who wants to type them in.

By the way, the designs use L-hyd drop tanks, and I\'m not sure these are

When we look at society today it is correct that feudalism has been
eliminitated in modern societies, but this is due to a wide array of
determining factors. One of them is cheap fast coomunication. The
Imperium doesn\'t have this. For information to travel from one end
of the Imperium to the other takes months! This will seriously affect
the mindset of the people.

Why is the feudal system of the Imperium hard to believe? Because
we look at it from *our* enlightened time with *our* prejudices towards
feudalism. But the fact that feudalism failed once in our history is not
sufficient argumnet that it will never work again.

I think that the average citizen of the Imperium views him/herself as
a free individual. The feudalism of the Imperium does not extend to
the individual citizen, but only defines a hierachy of the upper
echelons of society.

In principle aristocracy can be defended just as well as meritocracy.
In an aristocracy, nobles are raised to lead. When they start out on
their duties, they have a lifetime of education about their responsibilities.
This might work as well as a meritocracy. And remember that nobles
typically will have advisors which are chosen for their skill and not
their heritage, and thus we have a meritocracy on the level just
below the nobles.

As for example Ilelish or Antares was defined as distinct cultural
regions of the Imperium, the Rebellion makes perfect sense to me.
If I lived in Ilelish, I wouldn\'t want to live under the reign of Lucan.

And the right of assasination: I see it as merely a tool for legitimization
of a change of power. When Cleon the Mad was assasinated, his
succesor took over, not because she performed the assasination,
but because she had the support to do it. This works excactly like
the right of fleet control, which was excercized during the first civil
war, although this was never legitimized.

So, as it turned out, Dulinor coudn\'t become emperor because he
didn\'t have the sufficent support. And this in spite of the fact that
if the right of assasination is real, he is the theoretical emperor.

So what you have is a question about power. Strephon\'s greatest
mistake probably was to delegate more power to the Domains. When
the Domains feel they have the power to oppose the Imperium, a
Rebellion-like situation is likely to arise. Not because the system is
a feudal one.

By the way, the designs use L-hyd drop tanks, and I\'m not sure these are 
legal under the later tournament rules - any feedback?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Well, if memory serves me right, 2 out the 3 battleship designs 
(Tigress & Kokkirrak) in the CT \'Fighting Ships\' only had enough
internal fuel space for J3, despite their J4 jumpdrives. The 
Plankwell *did* enough internal fuel for J4 but it also had a
wimpy meson screen hobbling it. I once wrote a BASIC prg, way
back when, to help me design HG ships. I found that if big
BB\'s only set aside the 30% of internal space needed for J3,
they had ample room, at TL-15, for the best of everything.
If 40% was set aside for J4 then something had to be sacri-
ficed. After playing around a little I concluded that the
limit of one spinal mount per ship dictated that designs
be produced that would yield the maximum number of spinal
meson guns. I think some others here have posted to that
effect previously. In my universe I decided to change the
rules so that meson guns could be defended against better
than the official rules allowed.

1. TCS DESIGN STRATEGEMS
I think we should do the winner of the TCS competition justice and get his 
designs published here.  Would someone please be kind enough to do the 
honours...

2. NOBLES AND IMPERIAL CONTROL
I can contribute a little to the various comments made about nobles not, or 
having limited influence upon strategy and greater influence upon the 
weapons/structures deployed to impliment the strategems.
	Regarding procurement, lets take the example of the United States (not 
to be vindictive, but as it has one of the most open bureaucratic societies
it 
yields best to analysis).  retired officers are often picked up on retainer
due 
to their special knowledge to sell systems to their former service, due to 
contacts etc.  assuming noble involvement in those companies, creates
situations 
where the procurement process can be influenced (adventure hook time)  Then 
there is the example in the 1970s where I think Lockheed was involved in a 
scandal bribing I think a member of the Netherlands Royal family to influence

procurement decisions in that state, (another good adventure hook).  Then
there 
is the problem of a noble controlling teritory with industrial capacity
reliant 
upon contracts from the military - they will seek to improve their own lot,
but 
improving that of their home industries, and so resort to "all necessary 
measures" to secure contracts, military facilities etc.  I suggest people
refer 
to Nick Kotz\'s excellent book "The wild Blue yonder: Power, Politics and the
B1 
bomber".  
	In this analysis, two bases are built to operate the craft from, one is 
in Texas, not the climate, or territory in which the bomber is expected to 
operate, or even in the performance envelope for a cold war attack on the
Soviet 
Union.  The base is built there because of the support the
Congressman/senator 
rendered the Air Force in getting the programme into reality.....  Real life
is 
often very fascinating to say the least.

3. MAX\'S VEHICLE DESIGNS
Max, enjoyed examining the designs, but without striker or MT I am a little 
stumped as to what comments I can make.  I will put together a posting 
concerning the roles and types of combat vehicles used in the future however.

Has anyone considered the effects of atmospheric pressure and local=20
gravity=E2=E2on the performance of aircraft?  I couldn\'t find anything in=
=20
COACC or FF&S which made sense.  Here are my rough ideas.

Fixed Wing aircraft.

Lift: For a given aircraft, at a given speed, this is proportional to the=
=20
gas density.  The density is roughly proportional to air pressure, and=20
also depends on temperature.  Thus, as a rough guide to the ability of=20
your aircraft to fly, multiply its rated weight by local atmospheric=20
pressure to find its lift.

Load: The force due to the aircraft\'s mass depends on the local gravity. =
=20
Thus, to find an aircraft\'s effective maximum load, multiply by local=20
gravity.

Can it fly?  If the lift is more than or equal to the weight, it can=20
fly.  OR As lift also depends on speed, if the lift is less than the=20
speed, then you just need to go faster to take off, but the aircraft will=
=20
not stand up to the sort of manoeuvres it could do under the conditions=20
it was designed for.

Rotary Wing aircraft

About the same as Fixed Wing, except lift must be greater than load, as=20
you can\'t spin the rotors faster without redesigning the aircraft.

Lighter than Aircraft

Lift:  This is equal to the mass of atmosphere displaced.  Thus, as for=20
Fixed Winged aircraft, multiply the lift by local atmospheric pressure,=20
although for different reasons.

Load:  Multiply the unloaded weight by local gravity, and subtract from=20
the lift given above.  Divide the result by local gravity to give you the=
=20
mass which can be carried as load.

Various restrictions need to be made regarding the upper and lower limits=
=20
of pressure and gravity at which an aircraft can still operate if=20
designed for a different environment.  You might also want to modify the=20
construction rules to allow for optimisation to a specific environment.

Speed of sound varies with pressure, too, so maybe the speed limits on=20
airframes could change.

At least these were my thoughts.  Anyone want to pick holes?

This unit, despite its bulky size dictated by the minimum size TL14
meson gun, is intended mostly for supporting ground operations rather
then space cbt. Since it is a paying target for the opponent\'s ground forces
it has been purposedly avoided to double its role as command control.
The unit normally operates alone or with a small escort from other vehicles.
Various deployment techniques are used depending on the terrain of
operation and the level of threat.
The Gun Boat can operate submerged with sensor and communication
drones above the surface, in the atmosphere at low altititude
moving at high speed or even camouflaged and powered down. It normally 
remains far from the front line thanks to its high speed.
When the enemy threat is large it is used only against  valuable targets,
like similar units of the opponent, starships, or large concentrations
or vehicles.

While I agree that feudalism is not necessarily bad, I tend to disagree
with the previous  statement. Take the European Union as an example. Most 
European countries have their cultural identities developed in  
many years of history. Still, most of the European citizens (although
perhaps not most of the Danish citizens) are not especially unhappy 
about some form of unification. Moreover, I am italian but have lived
in the Netherlands, in Germany and in the US for relatively long
periods and I did enjoy it! therefore, personally I would prefer to say:

If I lived in Ilelish I would prefer Lucan to an idealistic incompetent
like Dulinor.

(not to mention that if I were Lucan I would have had psionic body
guards from the Marches to scan visitors minds..)

My major point on the little realism of Imperium however is not about who 
wants to be governed by who or whether feudalism is inferior to other forms 
of governement but rather on the surprising amount of violence that is
present. My guess is that this is to make it a better world to roleplay
rather than a better world to live.

Good point! in the Army, we were regularly visited by salesmen who had 
been in the Army themselves, and in some cases outranked the officers
they were talking to (nice psychological trick..).

Sorry about that, but I haven\'t designed High Guard stuff since a long time,
it is much easier for me to use MT..I would enjoy giving a try designing
the combat vehicles you propose though..
I will be travelling for the next two-three weeks and will carry
a laptop with the design worksheet...

Message-ID: <9506142114.AA01380@malibu.pencom.com>


I read an article about EURISKO in Scientific American or some such mag many
years ago; it leaped out at me because of the discussion of TCS.
As far as the program\'s strategy, all I remember was that the program was
supposed to have designed fleets that were uniform -- all the ships were
identical. This meant that the loss of any one ship caused no loss of 
features
from the fleet, only a proportionate loss in firepower.

I\'ve never played TCS, so can anyone comment as to whether this is a chestnut
of TCS design or a useful design concept?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The TCS fleet published in JTAS #10 is not uniform - there are four types 
of major combatants and two types of fighters.  However, there are 75 of 
one of the major combatants (11,100 tons), with 11 total of the three 
other major combatants (four at 12,000 tons, four at 19,980 tons, three 
at 19,600).  The fighters are really more small battle riders (seven at 
1,000 tons; three at 100 tons).  I\'m not much of a TCS player, but it 
looks like the fleet relies on missiles (there are only four meson guns 
and three particle accelorators in the whole fleet).

    'body' => 'Some more comments about civilian noble control of the military in the
Imperium:

We have one example of the procurement process from "classic" Traveller.
In the 990s, just after the 3FW and as the Solomani Rim War roared into
life, the IN issued the specification for a new fleet intruder class, 
the _Azhanti High Lightning_ class.  Construction contracts are important
enough to the sector economy that all regions vie for a contract.  Why?
Because the Imperium is paying billions of credits for each ship, which
creates high-tech work for shipyards, key to interstellar commerce.
And with the Marches growing quiet after the end of the 3FW, the raging
Solomani Rim War to rimward meant that most construction contracts would
go closer to the fighting to rimward, and the previously busy naval yards 
in the Marches would lose work.

In order to secure a contract, the Duke of Regina (probably Duke Norris\'s
great-grandfather) spoke for the Marches (before the Moot?) and relayed 
the sector\'s offer to procure an additional cruiser from sector funds on 
the condition that they would be allowed to produce part of the cruiser 
run.  The offer was accepted, and judging by Supplement 5, the LSP yards
at Mora were awarded a contract to build five of the nearly seventy ships.
(Mora was probably one of the few tech-14 worlds in the Marches in 990.)
This was a fairly unique offer, since the Marches covered the additional
cruiser by mounting a fund drive in the schools, collecting quarter-credits
from kids\' lunch money for it, _Children of the March_.  But this sort
of deal might be more common, without the patriotic bells and whistles
and creative fund-raising.  (If I remember the library data version of
this right, it added a comment about a minor scandal involving the way
some local planetary governments handled the money....)

I suspect that IN appropriations are recommended to the Emperor, along with
the rest of the budget, by the Moot.  We also know that there\'s a Ministry
of Defense, with an Imperially-appointed minister of ducal rank, which may
work with the IN in making requests for funding before the Moot committee
in charge of preparing the budget.  Since the nobles are all Moot members,
they through their proxies at the Moot (senators?) can have an influence on
these decisions.  In any case, to make decisions the nobles will need to
get advice from their staffs, since the jobs for the highest of them is
otherwise utterly unmanageable on a scale that is almost incomprehensible. 
And the senators at the Moot will also hear from the fellow nobles whose
proxy votes they hold, and need to report to them afterwards.  Of course,
communications delay means that the Moot attendees will need to vote how
they think now and talk about it after the fact.  Even without the election
cycle, the politics of this means that the Moot will be slow to implement
radical changes, to avoid mistakes.

This brings up another interesting point.  Norris, as Duke Regina, is in
charge of the interstellar government of Regina and Jewell subsectors, and
the Quar/Chronor outpost. (Spinward Marches Campaign)  But he doesn\'t
directly rule Regina -- it has it\'s own planetary executive elected locally
by lottery (I think), who might control the planetary naval flotilla.  
Norris, as Marquis Regina, is only the representative of Regina to the 
Imperium (via the Moot, even if he never attends himself).  This isn\'t 
always the case -- some worlds with gov codes of A or B are ruled by
Imperial legates of marquis rank, like Vincennes in Deneb.  Norris does
have some sizable holdings on Regina which he (actually his staff) must 
oversee, including fiefs, but these are different things.

     I don\'t think that\'s necessarily true.  Technological advancement does 
     not necessarily guarantee any sort of cultural advancement, especially 
     in a universe in which the only mode of interstellar communication is 
     xboats, traders and other ships physically carrying in the news.
     
     In our own world, the same atrocities that have been committed for 
     time immemorial, lavished upon unsuspecting victims on a perpetual 
     basis.  With communication technology as it is (tv, radio, etc.) those 
     who want to be savage need to be a little more clandestine about it, 
     but given the right circumstances even the most technologically 
     advanced army and the civilization that supports it have been known to 
     take part in pillage, homicide and rape.
     
     As sentient beings, I think one consistent aspect of humanity has been 
     our aggression and violence.  Occurences of some of the aforementioned 
     atrocities might be anomalies in the future, but across a civilization 
     spanning hundreds of light years and consisting of trillions of 
     people, that\'s a lot of anomalies!
     
     The key is the dependency worlds have upon one another for trade and 
     life support (in some cases) and the "pony express" style 
     communications system.

Happened a lot during World War II.  Also Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Korea,
Vietnam, Burma, many wars in Africa and South/Central America, all during
this century.  

Routine targeting of civilian populations, indiscriminate use of landmines
(not to mention manufacture and sale of the same), poison gas, biowar...

I, personally, am not convinced that warfare is becoming more "civilized".

Think of it as realpolitik: a willingness to admit to practices that today we
prefer to pretend don\'t exist, but engage in anyway.  After all, what is the
"right of assassination" but recognizing that a coup d\'etat can transfer the
control of the government?  Canada, Britain, the United States and many other
countries maintain diplomatic relations, give money and military support to,
etc. many countries where the governments came to power by coup.

Ooh, you\'re touching upon a sensitive subject here...

We\'ll I wouldn\'t. Dulinor may be an idealistic incompetent (some of
his actions points in that direction) but at least he\'s not an "evil" type
dictator. Most war crimes during the Rebellion seems to be
committed by Lucan\'s forces.

Anyway, the fact that Lucan isn\'t dead yet indicates that he\'s a
cunning, maybe even intelligent person. That makes him even
scarier.

The Rebellion was invented with the sole purpose of making the
Imperium a better place to roleplay in. This was discussed in an
article in the Travellers\' Digest #12.

It doesn\'t seem to me, though, that the pre-Rebellion Imperium
was a better or worse place to live than modern day Terra. The
worlds are autonomously controlled, and, like the real world, there
are good and bad places. The organizational structure of the
Imperium doesn\'t affect the citizens.

I disagree with your assessment, Max; I think that developments in the
Imperium  
are pretty well supported by the history we\'ve been given. The Imperium is
the  
3rd Imperium, not the first. Culture and technology have not simply advanced;

they\'ve gone up and down. The Traveller universe is designed for diversity,  
with tech levels and cultures varying widely from one planet to the next; the

historical details support this.

Our modern belief in progress simply hasn\'t been proved true in the Traveller

universe. Things haven\'t steadily gotten better; they\'ve gotten worse, then  
better, then worse again.

While overall we seem to be doing pretty well as a planet, Bosnia proves what

we are still capable of. Hitler and Mussolini aren\'t that far in the past,
and  
atrocities occur all the time. We live on an interdependent and
interconnected  
planet; Imperial cultures are far apart in time and space, and there aren\'t  
good communications to help public opinion along. The Imperium\'s time scale  
provides hundreds of years for some cultures to develop beastly attributes,
and  
their scattered planets provide plenty of isolation to practice them in.

That said, I think you should set up your universe however you like. I just  
don\'t believe that we as a race are inevitably getting "better" all the time.
I  
think progress in the area of societal values is something hard-fought that  
could easily be lost.

the border line with the following statement::On earth today
the countries with the highest production TL (and this is what the
TL is) are less violent than the ones with lower TL.

Two possible reasons:
1- higher TL = better lifestyle, more money = less will to kill
and torture somebody else for silly reasons

2- higher TL = higher development = higher general cultural 
development(and this is a fact of history, on  average)

So I would reiterate (for the last time, I promise) that everthing
is at has been described in the traveller universe, but I would
expect that in the 56th century real world either we have killed each other
completely or the world will be less violent than it is now (as
far as humans are concerned).

MAX\'S DESIGNS FOR THE IRIDIUM BRIGADE

Under Max\'s Modular Combat Vehicle System (MCVS) the craft all have the same
key 
features (further details in Digests 300 +):

* Same Power Plant, Grav Thrust, Sensors, Commo, Decoy launchers, Environment
* All have no EMM Level

TYPES OF VEHICLES AND ACRONYMS

MBGT - Main Battle Grav Tank (modern day equivalent: M1A2 Abrams (US), 
Challenger 2 (UK), Leopard II (Germany), Le Clerc (France)

IFV (APC) - Infantry Fighting Vehicle (modern day equivalent: M2 Bradley
(US),

good 
sensor setups, with the Cavalry grav Tanks as scouts, what use are these ?
As 
all your designs have no EMM, they cannot even be justified as being
stealthy, 
and they only serve to complicate maintenance - Max I would like your (plus
any 
other XBoaters) opinions

Jeffrey is questioning the role of the RCEV vehicle. In my view this was 
actually covering three different roles:

Commo Veh. using two drones yet to be designed. Since commo will mostly be
via direct lineof sight beams, efficient commo in broken terrain etc requires
relay stations. These are provided by the drones deployed by this vechile.

Reco Veh. theidea is to use the drone for reco missions that might 
otherwise be dangerous. 

EW Veh. this  was intended to provide through the use of its drone/s either
Jamming capabilities without risking the cbt vehicles themselves or passive
surveillance of the opponents emissions (either intentional = jamming) or 
unintentional, acting therefore as an electronic intelligence gatherer.

Unfortunately I have not yet designed this drones..

CONCLUSIONS & ISSUES FOR FUTURE ARGUMENT

1. Max\'s designs suggest Direct fire will be king in future over indirect
fire - 
is there universal agreement over this issue ?

2. Some brave sole may consider now the cost and equipment of your average
TL14 
Marine, and factor that into this analysis......

3. Which organisation is best.  fundamentally beta is disadvantaged without
the 
Meson Gun Boat, but in the future of sneaky combat (remember the distinct
lack 
of EMM), commandos will be king.....

4. Someone with MT/TNE/Striker/Striker II may try to game this, and give 
opinions, me I\'m perfectly happy just posting dissention.....

Jeff

missing some counters. 

First: The Zho OOB says there are 7 named and 9 numbered colonial
squadrons, and 8 named and 8 numbered colonial troops. My copy of the
game has an errata slip (dated 1 Sep 81) saying this OOB is in error,
that there are actually 7/9 troops and 8/8 squadrons. My copy of the
game has 7 named and 9 numbered colonial squadrons, and 7 named and 8
numbered colonial troops. I thus think I\'m missing a colonial troop of
some kind, but I\'m not sure if it\'s a named one or a numbered one.
Zho colonial troops in my copy:
Esalin (20-8 MI), Sheyou (10-10 LI), Clan (10-10 GT), Cipango (1c-12
LC), Chwistyoch (10-10 LI), Cronor (1c-13 LMi), Atsa (2-10 GT)
476 (20-13 LI), 509 (10-12 LI), 46 (2-13 LJ), 98 (20-13 LI), 
3112 (2-11 LI), 1067 (2-10 GT), 397 (20-13 LC), 840 (20-13 GT)
(L is "lift", G "grav", M "motorized", I "infantry", C "cavalry", T
"tank", Mi "mech infantry", J "jump")

Second: The Imperial OOB implies there are 34 Imperial BatRons and 32
Imperial CruRons. My copy of the game has 30 BatRons and 25 CruRons. 
Here\'s a listing of the units in my game. Format is
ABC(D)/EFG(H): S, ...
where ABC(D) are the undamaged attack/bomb/defense and jump factors,
EFG(H) are the damaged attack/bomb/defense and jump factors, and the
S\'s are the squadron numbers. I have ordered them first by fueling
class, then by undamaged jump number, then by undamaged attack factor.

If anyone out there would care to give me the stats for any units
missing in my game, I\'d be grateful.

Also, anyone know why some of the BatRons\' jump number increases when
they take a step loss?

Right now, that is possibly true.  (Although Japanese prisons do things that
have been illegal in North America for decades, and the Japanese TL is
equivalent to North America\'s.)

However, just half a century ago this was not the case.  Look at the German,
Russian, Japanese, American, and Canadian human rights record during WWII.

During the Renaissance, when technology was improving at a phenominal rate,
violence in everyday life reached record levels.  The most technologically
advanced societies were also the most violent.  Assault and murder were
commonplace, and even kings were powerless to stop casual killing in their
courts.

Even right now, authorities are often powerless.  Canadian visitors to
Detroit are often escorted to the Tunnel by the Detroit police when they
stray into the wrong areas after dark - apparently people in Detroit know
which neighbourhoods to avoid.  Same thing applies in New York City.  (In
fact, an acquaintance of mine in counter-terrorism tells of how the FBI
delayed a raid until after dawn because there were areas _they_ didn\'t go
into after dark!)  Carjacking, home invasion... all have skyrocketed in
recent years, along with technology.

You are, of course, free to run your universe as you choose.  In my Traveller
universe, advancing technology has not changed human nature, because I can
find no historical evidence that human nature is changing.

	Therefore I thought a posting was in order to discuss, and hopefully 
contribute to the discussion regarding fuedalism, civilisation etc. by
comparing 
now, the future, and back again.  Some may claim that comparison is
impossible, 
but one thing is certain to me - human nature is eternal (and if someone else

said that I apologise...)

Firstly, lets consider What is our social system today - the International 
system is an anarchic collection of sovereign units (all states have equal 
sovereignty i.e. control over their borders, legal control within them over 
their citizens etc.) generally speaking these entities called states
represent 
distinct cultures with different social values etc. institutionalised in an 
administrative form by government.  In considering our world today I think it
is 
 necessary to remember that our values can colour our judgement without
careful 
consideration.  Democracy is not the system which governs the majority in the

world, and it is just another system - only better because it appears to keep

the \'wolf from the door\' effectively, it does have negative facets and
arguably 
a distinct lack of social justice - I only have to say to the American
audience 
here "O.J.simpson" for them to understand my point.
	I have been lucky enough to spend 5 - 6 years living in South and West 
Africa, the more low tech of todays societies, and hopefully feel I can add 
something distinct to this problem.  Today there are still fuedal societies
in 
existance, think of the Zulus in South Africa represented by their leader 
Mangesutu Butelezi - a fuedal system of leadership.  By and large the Zulu 
homelands (historical term now) are predominantly Incatha, politically.  The
ANC 
is largely made up of members of Nelson Mandela\'s tribe and outlook - lets
hope 
the right of assassination does not become South Africa\'s future...
Elsewhere 
in Iraq, Saddam Husseins precarious rule relies upon the posting of family 
members, from his native town of Tikriti, within a minority population in
Iraq 
(30% Sunni Muslim, 70% Shia(fundamentalist)).

Turning to the Third Imperium, what\'s changed in a few thousand (Terran)
years 
of evolution ? well, the anarchic environment is far less so.  The Imperial 
government is a federal type - super United Nations, with its armed forces 
raised from worlds by taxes, with control for the space between worlds.
Worlds 
are still individually sovereign, with extra-territorial starports akin to
those 
airports today.  As someone pointed out, the slow communication times (quick
for 
then), place restrictions on this \'utopia\'.  The logical way out is to
designate 
a caste-type system of people reliable \'to do the right thing\' in given 
circumstances.  The megacorporations appear to follow similar practise, as
does 
the armed forces.  In one of the Frontier Wars, The Spinward Marches went to 
war, the Imperial Government declared War formally as soon as word reached - 
this shows similar thinking - if not standard practise, after all the
frontier 
is such a long way from here.....
	If Fuedalism is dead, why is there so much emphasis placed in my state 
on knighthood\'s, with yearly lists of people invested for their services ?
and 
what do these people share ?  Also note the "Vons" in Europe, and existence
for 
better or worse of a noble class - its influence is diluted due to other 
structures i.e. mass communications, participation in the political system, 
economy etc.  but imagine the states of Europe hundreds of years ago - slow 
communication times, political awareness, participation restricted to higher 
echelons etc.   Think also of diplomats a couple of hundred years ago - today
by 
and large they are \'rubber stamps\' for a governments policies at the end of a

telephone or satellite link.  Then they were persons of enormous influence.

Consider the levels of order prevalent in todays world - not the past.  We
have 
high law levels (A+) such as in Singapore, "spray someones car and its the
cane 
for you son !", or zero - Liberia, where heads are placed on sticks today in
the 
1990s.  I must admit, whether or not its the fact that my work is
international 
politics, or not, I have a dark Hobbesian/machiavellian view of human nature,

and I think the wider public forget what a nasty place the world is, except
for 
15  minute blurring images presented by a friendly newscaster daily....

So has Traveller got it right ?  well from a role-playing view it would
arguably 
be a lot boring if the universe was uniform - imagine the world being
America, 
Britain or worse Bosnia (Twilight 2000 comes close I suppose).  Different Law

Levels work nicely, as do the types of government ranging from Democracy
(USA), 
to Monarchy (UK), to Anarchy (Former Republics of Yugoslavia), and Theocracy 
(Iran). The basis in Feudalism holds up well I believe, as perhaps it is
better 
to consider the alternatives - if the Imperium was just a government, 
states/planets would feel little empathy with it (bad news), and feel 
marginalised, but a system of nobles and trusted persons in contact with the
bg 
picture would be effective - I mean Bill Clinton or John Major contend with 
domestic problems and relations with say 30 important states and the odd
crisis 
or three - imagine your state, countries, and x worlds as well ? no way, 
something would give.  Perhaps Nobles are kind of ambassadors for the
Imperium, 
wielding influence (at best) in a benign way, reminding the worlds that they 
belong to something larger and better.  I mean if nobles are like royalty
today, 
what do they do mostly - maintain a high public profile for their followers,
and 
project a good image of their home world/subsector/sector wide....

I wish to turn now to the issues of Right of Assassination and the violence
in 
society today.  Someone has talked of the Imperial right of assassination as 
\'unrealistic\', others consider it a formal transfer of power, a process.
Does 
it happen in the real world today ?  not quite.  I mean noone will go to
Saddam 
Hussein pull a gun, say "by right of xyz....", shoot him, sit in his chair
and 
dictate policy - no in democracies we have what P.J. O\'Rourke calls
"character 
assasinations" or elections (sorry joke).
	In International Law we have De Jurre Governments and De Facto 
Governments, a neat play on words when either a civil war is raging, or a
coup 
de etat has occured, and the home governent is unsure which horse to back.
The 
key point it that it is very rare, by the rules of our game in the real
world, 
that a coup leader is not recognised as the legitimate power once he has his 
hands on the levers of power i.e. military, political etc. and what are these

levers ?  In a third world state typically they are - The media (or
broadcasting 
stations), the Mint, the parliament/assembly building, the military
headquarters 
etc.  note: in a third world country, or modern state they are often
clustered 
closely together for security, yet paradoxically make coups easier.  Think of

Washington D.C. and The Gambia.  The latter is 40 km wide, and 360 km long,
the 
capital is grouped on an island with all of the above there. A coup took
place 
there last year - easy, yes.  Washington D.C. - the Pentagon, political 
buildings, judiciary etc. all grouped together.  The difference is the
dspersed 
media - but then the Imperium negates that advantage.  In sum, the ability to

mount a coup in virtually any society is not impossible, just because the 
Imperium is so large, we think naaahh, but wait, if I was going to cause a 
revolution, a small fleet sufficient for the local depot, if not just Core 
system would be enough (Small means relatively !).  So what of the right of 
assassination - if you just killed your head of state routinely you would
create 
mass panic, and lack of faith in the system as a whole (key)  In Roman times 
there was a year in which several (36 ?) Emperors were elected and killed
off, 
yet always there was a ritual to go through of some kind.  The key here is
that 
humaniti I believe is a beast which along with a darker side to its nature is
a 
creature of habit.  The Right of Assassination is not the regal equivalent of

"you have the right to remain - dead !", but rather is the cumulation of the 
system by which persons outside of the royal blood lines ascend to power,
after 
all if Lucan were any other Emperor, he would have probably been tolerated,
and 
a family member take over, yet with no family, how would Lucan have been 
replaced - assassination most likely, as when he grew old, pressure would
have 
mounted (and Lucan does not strike me as someone to give up "Saddam of the 
spaceways").  In summary I think the Right of Assassination is not
indefensible 
in a future RPG, it is ekegant, but should not be interpreted literally.
	Finally, Finally, violence as becoming more civilised.  I think the 
writer mayhave spoken in the heat of the moment, and like the press and 
politicians, is being hounded remorselesly.  Violence, has never been a 
civilised affair, and what is there to suggest that new technologies will
ensure 
social checks on its existence (short of psionics).  Conrad Lorenz had a
theory 
of aggression concerning humans and animals (remember we are just a more
complex 
animal), and he spoke of animals having inhibitors due to their natural 
weaponry.  For example combat for animals is a largely ritualised affair,
rarely 
resulting in a fight to the death.  Lorenz suggested that humaniti\'s lack of 
natural weaponry led to combat being brutal and Hobbesian in the extreme.  
Combat as a civilised affair arguably existed for a time, during the Italian 
city-state wars of the Middle Ages when battles were decided by manoevre, the

losing side, like in a chess game, running off rather than fighting, but this

was a brief period.  The Gulf War of 1991 was hailed as a precision conflict
and 
shape of things to come.  But now as the data comes in, the results appear to

suggest that it showed the way of the future of warfare, but was not the 
watershed itself.  Pictures of bobs hitting taregts were propaganda for the 
public opinion at home - not every tomahawk hit its target, and pictures of 
gunship crews straffing troops in APC\'s "up close and personnal" were
suppressed 
for as long as practical.
	I have met Colonel Bob Stewart twice in the last six months (first 
commander of the UKs UNPROFOR contingent) and believe me he would not agree
with 
any statements concerning warfare as becoming more civilised.  His
description 
of entering a house one day to find the village inhabitants having been 
incinerated while bound up i.e. still alive is enough to put you off your 
dinner, and ensure when you turn the television off, you do not get to sleep.

As long as humaniti can find justification, its nature will be to do dark 
things.
	In closing ratehr soberly I hope I have contributed something to the 
discussion, I doubtless believe this posting is long enough to get myself
into 
hot water over some inconsistency.  I apologise for not mentioning previous 
posts by name, but you all had input into this one.  Finally, I considered
Max\'s 
statement in yesterday\'s posting regarding Political Correctness, and I want 
everyone to think of this;

What is political correctness ?  Is it a way of gaining recognition of other 
peoples prejudices expressed by language, or is it becoming a form of
linguistic 
fascism ?  for example if I wished to write a project comparing race or
gender, 
I would meet a hailstorm of protest at University - a bastion of intellectual

freedom (?)  If the University invited say a prominent member of a extreme
right 
wing political group to express its views so that we could gauge their
concepts, 
like any other party, would the university be treated as a institution acting
in 
a streetwise, conscious manner, or would it be demonised and face withdrawal
of 
support from funding sources ???
	I think PC is a frightening challenge in the incarnation it has reached. 
 It is not fashionable in my department to consider warfare and issues of 
military strategy "with 1989 there\'s little need for you people" - precisely
the 
attitude of before 1914 "there can be no war between civilised states". hmmm

Jeff

I know quite a few people who would agree with Aaron, and disagree with the

If nobody else can, I\'ll check my copy when I can (probably the next

that someone here has a known-complete copy of the game ...

Because some of the BatRons are composed of a mixture of ships of different
classes (and presumably, tech levels).  The assumption seems to be that
the obsolescent ships (with lower performance) will be destroyed first,
leaving the remainder to perform at the higher jump number.

Those are probably battlerider squadrons -- the step up could mean that
the squadron carriers are carrying fewer riders each, improving the 
efficiency of their drives.  The other possibility is that the squadron
was a mix of different classes of vessels, and some of the less jump
efficient (older?) ones got destroyed in combat.

You leave out the most important reason:
3- Higher TL societies have more to lose! As technology increases, so 
does the destructive power of its weapons.  The Cold War did not become a 
hot war because neither side was pushed by confrontation (indeed, they 
avoided confrontation) into a situation where they felt the only 
alternative was to lash out - since they knew that lashing out would be 
the last thing either side did.

many disagreements among the greater powers in the 20th century would 
have lead to war in the 19th or certainly the 18th century.  As teh Costs 
of war rise, the willingness to engage in a full-scale war decreases.  
WWII taught the nations of earth how destructve war could be - and how 
costly its clean up afterward.  Complete with a hint of how awful the 
next upgrade of weapon technology could be...

As TL rises, abd weapon destructive ness rises, nations risk more by 
going to war against an equal opponent - hence they avoid it where they can.

The suffix \'ron\' comes from \'squadron\'. Thus, a BatRon is a
Battleship Squadron and a CruRon is a Cruiser Squadron. There
are also Battle Rider Squadrons, Tanker Squadrons and some
other squadron types which I don\'t remember right now.

You can read more about this in GDW\'s \'Fighting Ships of the
Shattered Imperium\' or \'Rebellion Sourcebook\' if you can get hold
on any of these. It\'s the same material offered in both books, so you
only need to buy one of them to get that further information. I
seriously suggest that you buy \'Rebellion Sourcebook\' as \'Fighting
Ships of the Shattered Imperium\' in my opinion is a waste of money.

I can do this.  I have my copy [relatively] handy.  Last time I
messed around with it I had all the counters.

That\'s one interpretation.  I have another.  Battle Riders.  A
tender carrying only half of its Battle Riders can jump farther
than one fully loaded.  If the counters you are referring to
are BatRon counters, then the particular BatRons could be made up
of classes of ships where the displacement ratio of Battle Riders
to their Tenders is relatively high; high enough to make a
difference in jump performance of the Tender if half of its Riders
are lost.

I\'m new to the list, so please be gentle...(snicker)

I\'m in the process of rebuilding my Traveller collection. I started buying
Traveller in 1977, and had a large pile of stuff by the time my gaming group
broke up in 1984(ish). At that point I stuck everything into storage because
of a lack of space in my living quarters.

Recently my wife and I put a bid in on a house and as a result I\'ve been
pulling things out of storage in anticipation of being able to store
everything under one roof. Unfortunately, a chunk of my collection was
destroyed due to flooding and vermin. I\'m starting to rebuild it, using the
ads from Challenge and the various Internet auctions.

Here\'s the problem: My collection was pretty thoroughly trashed so it\'s hard
to see what was in it. My memory of what was there isn\'t that good either, it
has been years since I looked at some of this stuff! Is there anywhere (or
does anyone have) that one can get a complete listing of Traveller stuff?
Even if it is limited to "mainstream" publishers (GDW, FASA, DGP would be my
list of "core" publications) that would be a ***big*** help in my quest.

Thanks! Once I start rebuilding enough maybe I can start contributing to the
list as well!

indirect fire. I do not think that direct fire is superior, just that at 
TL14the only reasonable indirect fire weapon (the meson gun) is ver expensive

have had meson guns instead of fusion guns in the fire support vehicles and
artillery vehicles.

Mass dirvers would be an alternative, but they have enormous supply 
requirements

Iridium Beta. In NATO nowadays a battalion almost never operates as it is but
always in cbt grou[ps where it is reinforced suitably. Since the
ratio of infantry to armor depends on the terrain, it is more conveniente 
to have felxible brigades having the capability of deploying several 
kinds of combat groups. For this reason I would rather prefer a brigade 
of type
alpha to the beta model, which might end up being not flexible enough.

There are really 7 named and 9 numbered Zho Colonial Troops and
7 named and 9 numbered Colonial squadrons.  So both the OOB AND
the errata are incorrect.

You are missing 1 numbered Zho Colonial Troop Counter.  It is
a Factor 20, Tech Level 14, ARMORED Lift/Grav CAVALRY unit.  Its
unit number is 998.



>Second: The Imperial OOB implies there are 34 Imperial BatRons and 32
>Imperial CruRons. My copy of the game has 30 BatRons and 25 CruRons. 

Similar problem.  The actual number of Imperial BatRons is 32
(what the OOB says are available as REINFORCEMENTS and) and the
actual number of Imperial CruRons is 26 (what the OOB says are
available as REINFORCEMENTS).

One of two things should be done, either:

1)  Change the Imperial OOB (Discretionary Placement section) to
read that regular Imperial forces available for initial placement
may be placed in the Imperial reinforcements boxes instead of on
the map if desired, or

2)  Change what it lists as being available as Imperial
reinforcements to read that 30 BatRons and 20 CruRons are available
as reinforcements.

The good news is that you are missing only 2 BatRons and 1 CruRon.

BatRons:

 8-0-4(4) / 4-0-2(4) Unstreamlined, # 501
 3-1-7(4) / 1-1-4(4) Partially Streamlined, # 493

CruRon:

 3-4-6(3) / 1-2-3(2) Streamlined, # 356

    'body' => 'I just had a chance to look over the winning TCS designs that Django posted
tuesday, and had some comments on them.

Firstly, I can see why people laughed at them. 

Okay, they\'ve all got lots-and-lots of fuel, but except for the Wasps
they\'re so lacking in maneuverability that their opponents would have to try
to miss them.

They also seem to have lots of relatively useless energy weapons. I suspect
that may be to take advantage of the High Guard quirk about weapon hits
knocking off one factor at a time if there\'s only one battery of a given
weapon...

Some comments on the individual classes--

Garter class: I can\'t quite figure out what this class is for exactly. The
\'TB\' designation suggests it\'s a tanker, but it\'s pretty heavily armed (and
fast) for that. And why bother with tankers for a one-shot tournament? Maybe
it\'s supposed to confuse the enemy. :-)

Cisor class: Pathetic speed and no maneuverability. It\'s armed nicely, but
because it\'s a sitting target it\'s opponents should be hitting it much more
often than it can hit them.

Queller class: Same speed and maneuverability flaw. This has lots of
incredibly wimpy batteries and a big PA mount. To bad all the little
batteries don\'t much chance of hitting a target with respectable
maneuverability. It\'s also _really_ well supplied with sandcasters, all to
weak to do _anything_ unless the enemy\'s guns are just as wimpy.

Eurisko class: These are apparently supposed to be the mainstay of the
force, since there\'s so many of them. At least this class has _some_
maneuverability. It\'s extremely well armoured, so at least it can jump to
safety once its weapons and m-drive are gone. Not that it will have enough
fuel without its drop tanks. Once again, it has lots of really weak
batteries, which combined with its poor agility mean it will be taking many
many more hits than it delivers. Finally, its lack of a fiberoptic computer
makes it very vulnerable to meson gun hits.

Wasp class: The USP for this gives m-drive and plant as \'Z.\' From agility
and fuel, I\'d guess this should be 6. This is the largest \'fighter\' I\'ve
ever seen--on par with an Alliance Navy Fast Patrol Boat. I actually like
this one--probably because it\'s basically a low-tech version of something I
came up with for Neubayern in Steve Higginbotham\'s TCS game. My PF design
never saw combat, though.

Bee class: This is more like the heavy fighters developed towards the end of
Steve\'s game. Not a very good example of the concept, though. Again, it\'s
unmaneuverable, and armour on a fighter was found to be useless (and
wasteful) in practice. Interestingly, it appears to have two seperate
missile launchers in one turret _firing as seperate batteries._ This is a
very nice idea--I wish I\'d thought of it. I don\'t see why the sandcaster
wasn\'t another missile, though...

Finally, this whole squadron has a flaw you could fly a Tigress through: not
one ship can jump without drop tanks. So, all an enemy has to do is fire a
salvo at each ship, blowing off their drop tanks, and then calmly withdraw
to a safe distance. 30 days later the whole force runs out of power plant
fuel and has to surrender. :-)

Of course, that doesn\'t matter in a one-shot tournament, but I can see how
it would annoy any other entrants who might have designed more practical
ships.

Now, I may be missing something here, since they did win. But, how? Their
design philosophy seems totally at odds with what worked in an actual TCS
game. I\'d love to see how this force would fare against a TL12 force from
Steve\'s game...

In looking at these designs from a Battle Rider perspective instead of a 
High Guard perspective they look rather different.

I am going to be converting these ships to BR terms, and in looking them 
over I\'ve got one observation to make right off:

Missiles kill things.

Direct fire weapons of any kind in BR just can\'t punch through the 
defenses of a comparable ship. Lining two identical ships of the line 
(CLs or bigger) up and firing them at each other yields a long series of 
No Effect since its as easy to make tough defenses as it is to make Big Guns.

Missiles on the other hand, just plain do damage if they hit. To anything.

These ships have lots of missiles (I haven\'t come up with the exact 
numbers yet) and should do very well against any opposing fleet.

The low maneuverability of these ships is also less of a handicap after 
they get translated since the idea is to go active to guide missiles only 
when the missiles are about to hit, thereby giving your opponent as 
little time to shoot at you as possible.

Finally, I\'d like a wee bit of advice on converting High Guard ships to BR:

1) As I recall the Agility of an HG ships is roughly its maneuver-Gs in 
combat. Is that correct ?

2) Fusion and plasma guns no longer function as anti-spacecraft weapons 
since the ranges have gone WAY up. So, Should they be replaced with laser 
turrets, point-defense lasers to shoot down all those missiles, particle 
accelerators with low range and high damage, or (probably the most 
popular) should fusion and plasma weapons be added to BR (this way you 
don\'t have to go near TNE/FF&S to play BR) ?

I\'ll keep track of all replies to this and eventually post a summary. My 
intention is to create a _loose_ set of _guidelines_ to enable the easy 
conversion of High Guard ships to Battle Rider. I am *not* interested in 
writing a bulletproof set of rules for doing so, I don\'t have the time 
and BR doesn\'t need that much detail.

I suspect that all those crappy extra weapons are not really weapons, but
armour. Under the unmodified TCS rules the defender decides just what
system in a category that gets taken out by a hit.

I think they\'d loose, but then, Steve made a lot of changes to the original

I use GURPS mechanics in the games I GM.  I\'ve also used CT and
MegaTraveller and slightly prefer MegaTraveller, it\'s a bit
more consistent and flexible a bit more complicated than it
really needed to be also.

Wow, you mean it existed?  Hm, I seem to have invented something already
made.  Sheesh.  That always happens.  I just mentioned it in case anyone was
interested in seeing it.  Since then, tho, I cannot find the electronic
files, just the paper printout & transparencies.  
It seems to work pretty good, especially if you prefer (as i do) to have
combat play a minimal and lethal part of the game.
For combat, it\'s straightforward.  I have silhouettes of people at
point-blank, short, med long and xlong ranges.  Player declares what weapon
is shooting, lays the cross hairs where he hopes to hit, and rolls 2d6-skill
(for the hit) and 1d20 for the location.  On the silhouettes are marked into
three areas that signify the lethality of a hit in a given location - light
wound, med, and, you guessed it - heavy.  For the light wound roll 2d6-2 vs
END.  For med 2d6+2, for heavy 2d6+6.  Add 1,4,or 8 to the roll for every
previous wound in this combat (lt,med,hvy, respectively)  So a traveller
that had been hit for a moderate wound previously gets hit by a light wound,
would roll 2d6-2+4= +2 roll vs END.

The relevant Traveller News Service dispatches are reprinted in the FFW
rulebook, actually.  :-)  There\'s a number of them - it\'s probably not
practical to summarize them here.

Other relvant material is the Classic Traveller adventure _Twilight\'s Peak_.

Because he (Stantocheev) was an idiot.  In the game, I believe his plotting
factor is 4, though there are worse in the game.  Replacing a high-plotting
value admiral with one that\'s plotting 0 is _very_ valuable.  Admittedly, the
plotting 0 tactics +3 admiral would be better, but Norris is the one
that the Warrant was for.  Also, check the rank number on that genius - if
I recall correctly, he\'s pretty junior - which means that he\'ll wind up
commanding one of your smaller fleets.

The plotting factor is the number of turns in advance that you must write
the fleet\'s movement orders - in other words, for Stantocheev, you\'ve got
to decide where his fleet is going on turn 12 when you\'re in turn 8!  Unless
you\'re good (or lucky), getting fleets to where they need to be while
plotting this far in advance is tough (even moreso if your opponent has a
smaller plotting requirement that you do).

The other important factor about how the rules work, is thate higher-ranking
admirals eventually wind up controlling your most valuable fleets - no
matter how good (or importantly, how bad) the admiral is!  There are a
number of really _bad_ high-ranking admirals in the Imperial mix, and the
Warrant is needed so that Norris (who is at least flexable, if not a great
tactician) can relieve these high-ranking idiots.

One more thing - the Warrant isn\'t forged (Norris didn\'t do that - he saw
the war coming, and predicted that some high-ranking idiot would gum the
Imperial works up).  So he went to Strephon, and requested the Warrant (see
Travellers\' Digest #9, page 9) so that he would be named Supreme Commander
of the Imperial defense of the Marches.  UNfortunately, the ship with the
Warrant (or rather, the ship Norris believed was carrying the Warrant) was
hit by Zhos on the way in, and went down in a Red-zone system.

Norris\'s "illness" was faked, so that he could personally retrieve the
warrant.  Norris felt that he couldn\'t order someone to go get it for him
because if it wasn\'t there, he would have ordered someone to peform an
Imperial crime.  So later in the war, Norris has the Warrant, and is
suddenly feeling fine.

Actually, the Imperial Warrant was *real*.  The only thing that Norris
forged was his "appointment" to Archduke Deneb in 1116.  The Warrant
was one of those "here\'s your rope; don\'t go hang yourself" situations. 

In the context of the 5FW board game, the Imperial player doesn\'t get 
all the admirals.  The "real" 5FW was played out with Sector Admiral
Santanocheev as the highest ranking admiral available, as I recall.
So Goolanzoon and Mtume aren\'t available.  Norris is the only other
Imperial admiral that has a zero planning time.  Santanocheev was 
sacked, in game context, because his planning time was too slow, and
this would let the Zhos make it look like they were doing one thing,
and then change plans before the Imperials can react.

in London\'s Financial Times (6 Apr 95), about new forms of piracy in 
Southeast Asia.  Here is an excerpt:

"In a typical case, a Southeast Asia-based crime syndicate will buy 
an old cargo vessel for about $1 million.  Syndicate members register 
the vessel under a new name with a flag-of-convenience country for 
about $5,000.  No inspection of the vessel is required."

The syndicate then sets up dummy offices as if it were a legitimate 
shipping company, forges ship\'s documents, and hires a crew (giving 
them false passports).  The syndicate learns when shipments are 
likely to be made, and their destinations.  When it gets a cargo 
loaded, it sails out of port, ostensibly toward the cargo\'s 
destination.  En route, the crew changes the ship\'s name, and takes 
the cargo somewhere else -- usually China.  

When the cargo\'s owner learns that the cargo hasn\'t arrived at its 
intended destination, an investigation begins.  Lloyd\'s shipping 
index reveals that the ship doesn\'t exist -- it is a phantom ship.

The International Maritime Bureau, a United Nations sponsored 
organization that investigates shipping crime, has at least four 
phantom ship cases under investigation in Southeast Asia.

I think that the phantom ship idea could be easily translated to the 
Spinward Main, especially in the areas along the Imperial border.  
I\'m surprised that I didn\'t think of it myself.

Hi: 

Is there any information out there in regards to the software in the
archives?

I am looking for info on the following for each program: 

Author(s), Function, Platform, and whether each file is source or 
binaries. 

Also, can anyone tell me Jo Jaymin\'s email address?

The battlefield CSEW drones are integral part of the MCVS 
series of vehicles. They are designed to carry out a number 
of functions depending on the Operational Module included and
on the programming of the mission specialist. A drone can be
converted from one mission to another on the battlefield,
however drones themselves are not designed to be repaired
on the field. Their complexity and use of non-standard components
make the replacement of the whole drone more cost effective.
The fusion gun is installed only for self-defence. The drones
are programmed to avoid any contact with the opponent.
The following are some of the major versions:
C-drone: used as communications relays station. Includes
Radio=FarOrbit*4,Laser=FarOrbit*4,Maser=FarOrbit*4 and two
additional kl of fuel for extended operations. The mission
specialist has Commo-4. C-drones can operate from space,
orbit or at ground level.
S-drone: used as remote sensing vehicle. Includes
Densitometer=LowPen/100m,Neutrino=10kw,NeuralAct=Long,
PassAudio,EMSpassive=IS,EMSActive=FarOrbit.
The mission specialist has Sensor-3,FwdObs-3. The S-drone
can direct support fire after detecting a target.
EW-drone: used for ECM,ECCM, and electronic information
gathering. Includes Densitometer=LowPen/100m,Neutrino=10kw,
NeuralAct=Long,PassAudio,EMSpassive=IS,EMSJammer=FarOrbit.
The mission specialist has Sensor-3,Commo-3. The EW-drone
is able to intercept or disturb sensors and communications.

C-drone 4.9Mcr
S-drone 5.1 Mcr
EW-drone 5.4 Mcr

>The relevant Traveller News Service dispatches are reprinted in the FFW

Not quite true.  As I remember, the news in FFW was pre-war.  The TNS for 
during the war was printed in several JTAS, and reprinted in JTAS 19 
"Traveller News Service (Revisited)".  This takes-up where the FFW TNS 
leaves off, with the call up of IISS reserves.  A synopsis of the FFW was 
printed in The Spinward Marches Campaign, along with maps.  
Unfortunately, the maps, the synopsis, and the TNS don\'t tally on details 
like which fleet was where when, although the dates etc. of major events 
seem to be correct.

With regard to Duke Norris\' illness.  TNS reported him ill with a 
"pneumonic virus" on 212-1107.  Santanocheev was first mentioned on 
268-1107, forbidding landing on interdicted worlds unless enemy forces 
have already done so; perhaps an attempt to pre-empt Norris\' visit toone 
of these worlds in pursuit of the Imperial Warrant.  On 302-1107, the 
office of the Duke denied reports of his death.  Admiral Santanocheev is 
mentioned in reports on 035-1108, 362-1108, 021-1109, and 029-1109, all 
showing how badly the war was going.  Finally, on 132-1109, Norris 
relieved Santanocheev of his command, taking personal control of the 1st 
Provisional Fleet, and going on to plan the fight-back.  650 days to find 
the warrant and then use it!

In SMC, it is indicated that while Norris was a veteran of Imperial Naval 
Intelligence, Santanocheev had set up a seperate agency, the Office of 
Naval Information, which he used in preference to INI.  Unfortunately, 
ONI were inept, and INI were to loyal to the Imperium to attempt to usurp 
the legitimate (if incompetent) Naval authorities.  Only a high noble 
with plenipotentiary powers (ie. Norris with a warrant) could do this.

Next week, we\'ll have a brief history of the Julian War, and the 
political intrigues leading up to it (not!)

Hi folks,

An odd thought and question came to my mind as I was doing my morning 
ritual today.  

In (Mega)Traveller, at what distances are battles between space fleets
fought?
This brings up a host of other questions, such as:

	+	What types of activities are happening with apposing 
		fleets in the interim between detection and closing for
		battle?

	+	Do apposing admirals take pot shots at each other at 
		extereme ranges with missles?

Part of my thinking tells me that in today\'s Naval engagements you take 
shots at your enemy "over the horizon" with weapons that engage targets 
on their own, such as Tomahawk and Harpoon missles.  What is the Traveller
analogy to that?

Conversely, if folks take pot shots at each other from real long range, how
good are the missles and how good are the evasive tactics?

That Andor and Candory. Andor was spelled with a y in one of the earliest
publications, but all (most?) other sources leave it out. No official
explanation for the interdict has been published, but note the curious 
fact that they have functioning starports despite being interdicted.
Also I think we\'ve seen Droyne ships (in _Merchant Prince_?) that are
registered to Andor mucking about the Marches.

In my universe the Droyne of Andor developed Jump-1 drive and colonized 
Candory long, long ago, but didn\'t colonize further due to the 3-parsec
gap in all other direction (that was before I got hold of the Foreven
Map. There\'s a world two parsecs from Andor there, but I ruthlessly
destroyed it when I noticed it). Anyway, the Droyne explored a bit in
special scout ships, but eventually decided to stick to Candory and
leave the rest of the galaxy alone. They were found by Imperial scouts
late in the 1st Century. No interdict, since they were star-travelling
(albeit in a small way) already. In 610 they became an Imperial protectorate
when the Imperium established Districts 267 (later Five Sisters), 268,
269 (Egyrn), 270 (Pax Rulin), 271 (Sindal), 272 (Tobia), and 273 (Usher).
In 810 they were interdicted without explanation to the public (The
subsector governor discovered they were psionic? Ancient sites were
discovered on Andor?). However, since the locals were already Imperial
clients they have the right to come and go as they please. Hence Droyne
ships from Andor plying the spacelanes with impunity.

Imperial scientists have been known to obtain permission to visit Andor
and Candory on those extremely rare occasions where the Droyne have
invited them to examine an Ancient site.

This is the order of battle for another version of the TL14 bde. Unlike the
previous versions this is armoured, since it should be preferred for a
desertic environment. I have tried to estimate the cost, each trooper
has been included with 1 Mcr cost (both equipment and training).
The displacement tons for vehicles are also given.
Once back in Pisa I plan to run some wargames between the various Iridium
bdes (at comparable cost levels).

2 Armoured btns: each 78 vehicles (57 MBT), 251 troopers, 3274 Mcr, 860 tons
1 Mechanized btn: 64 vehicles (46 IFV),596 troopers, 2024 Mcr, 760 tons
1 Artillery grp: 4 MGB, 58 vehicles, 376 troopers, 9994 Mcr, 6460 tons

EW cmp: 14 vehicles, 56 troopers, 434 Mcr, 140 tons

Bde summary: 
4 MGB, 360 vehicles (114 MBT, 46 IFV), 1876 troopers, 21576 Mcr, 10240 tons

Each Armoured btn is on:
4 tank companies (each on 3 tank plt of 4 MBTs + 2 MBTs) with 14 MBTs
1 HQ plt (1 MBT, 2 C3I, 2 SSV, 3 APC, 2 RCEV)
1 Fire Support  cmp (1 anti-tank btr on 4 HKV, 1 lance on 4 CT, 1 airdefence

1 HQ plt (2 C3I, 2 SSV, 4 IFV, 2 RCEV)

EW-drones (ECM/ECCM/EI) from EW cmp 28

Note that a large fraction of both cost and displacement is due to the 4

This Battlecruiser was designed by the Domain of Deneb Naval Design Office
in order to test the effectiveness in combat of battleunits not relying on 
heavy armor and therefore not exceedingly expensive to built. The BCX15 has
the standard maneuver and jump level required by Imperial Navy standard and
is classified as a Battlecruiser due to its low armor. The ship relies also
on
enhanced missile defence capabilities, as a response to simulated combat 
exercises carried out by regular Navy Batrons against the Aslan and Vargr 
Aggressor Rons which showed that regular Imperial Battleships are vulnerable
to 
coordinated attacks by large groups of small missile capable ships.
Duration is 14 days at full power PLUS 90 days with only environment and 
controls/sensors.

P.S. The Def. Missile bay is currently being redesigned. Once completed I 
will post more details and also the relevant penetration table.
P.S.2 Thanks to Aaron I now have the Striker weapon design rules!

There are several possible approaches:
(1) Treat as AD&D invisibility - i.e. sound, smell, etc. are not affected.
(2) Treat as full sense invisibility - i.e. sound, smell, etc. ARE affected.
Note that this does not make the Droyne\'s footprints invisible if it walks
through mud or if someone throws flour over the Droyne.
(3) Have you read any Terry Pratchett? Treat as the \'invisibility\' of Death
(and his close relatives). i.e. people sort of remember seeing someone but
they can\'t quite pin down who, and obviously it wasn\'t very important and...
basically they just aren\'t \'aware\' that the Droyne is there, as long as it
doesn\'t do anything to bring attention to itself. If someone really
concentrates damned hard (having already been made aware of the Droyne\'s
powers) then they might be able to pick up the Droyne. The rest of the time,
people just appear to \'ignore\' the Droyne, in every possible sense - i.e.
it\'s footprints are ignored, because if there\'s no one there to make the
footprints, then by definition they don\'t exist, so the onlooker doesn\'t see
them. And if the Droyne isn\'t there, then covering it with flour obviously
won\'t make it any easier to see, so that\'s how it works - it isn\'t any
easier to see! Impeccable logic.

It looks like that in MT it is easier to destroy your opponent than to 
see him (not too unreasonable after all..). As a result in my battles 
each opponent tends to stay at a safe distance (out of sensor range) from 
the enemy fleet, trying to guide its battleships fire (mesons and missiles)
using AWACS ships. Part of the battle preparation is trying to locate the 
enemy\'s AWACS..

I suspect that many others are using picket ships of some sort..

Units of similar kind are present as shipboard vehicles on most Imperials
Cruisers and Battleships. Upon jump they reach positions around the naval
formation and at large distances from it. Their purpose is to identify enemy
forces and to direct fire against them. Fighters squadrons and small ships
can sometimes be deployed alongside AWACS ships for their protection and
will be guided by the AWACS ships against enemy units threatening it.
Donosev class IISS ships can sometimes fill the same role when AWACS are
not available.

TL-8 Odour Supplant-Janitorial Robot [OS-JR]
 
The Odour Supplant-Janitorial Robot [OS-JR], commonly called 
Hos-Jar, was one of the first models introduced to the vacated 
automated maintenance & upkeep market in the Reformation 
Coalition.  Hos-Jar has been developed and manufactured back in 
mid-1200 by a small and unknown company called Barzel Manufactory 
[BM]. 
 
Barzel Manufactory started out in early 1200 as a family run 
electronics repair facility, which provided its services to the 
expending population of Delios Tradestation, Apollo\'s orbiting 
Class-E Starport. Due to Apollo\'s status as an Administrated 
Territory by the Reformation Coalition, there were barely any 
restrictions in the way of design and implementation of robotics by 
the RCSA.
        
This cemetery world provided Barzel Manufactory with most of the 
components and electronics needed, thus supplying virtually a free 
and a steady replenish of scavenged electronic apparatus.  Many 
market analysers, on Aubaine and elsewhere in the coalition, 
attribute it as the reason for their relatively high pitched 
earnings in sales. 
 
                        ----
 
Barzel Manufactory first released this model in an attempt to 
suppress the growing numbers of vermin in Delios\'s inner hull and 
service conduits.   They produced a small array of Hos-Jars to 
patrol and exterminate the vermin.  The Hos-Jar\'s low and 
semispherical hull, together with it\'s tiny arm enabled it to reach 
into the vermin\'s hideouts easily and brought to a successful & 
triumphant victory.  
 
Thus, the first introduction of Barzel Manufactory\'s robots designs 
became a favourite addition in Delios.   Their celebrated high 
speed chases after vermin in the empty fuel tanks resulted in 
numerous gambling pools in the bars.  Scores were kept for each 
Hos-Jar\'s performance, and later, even a tri-d Hos-Jar simulator 
game was released by Barzel\'s expending venture into the 
electronics commodity market.
 
Hos-Jar successfulness in controlling the vermin situation also 
attracted a number of transient Free Traders and Coalition 
Merchants to acquire the model for treatment on their vessels and 
as merchandise to trade around the coalition.  It is also rumoured 
that some Guild vessels obtained the model, but this information is 
not conformed.
 
Of course, exterminating vermin was only one component of Hos-Jar 
multi-operational capacity.  Barzel Manufactory added many 
diversified optional odour canisters to their Hos-Jar product line 
and transform it to an Air quality enforcement tool.   
 
For example, here\'s Barzel Manufactory\'s ad for the Hos-Jar:
 
"...be it in a marines\' changing room after a raid, aboard a 
scout ship with a shabby lavatory or a Ithklur-infested bar 
with no elbowroom, even in the maintenance bays of Aubaine\'s  
Starport, Odours can make you and your customers feel 
uncomfortable and interfere with their enjoyment of your 
facility and products.   That means loss of revenue and 
produces a bad name for your business.   
 
-So how can I solve the problem?, you ask.  
 
Why, here at Barzel Manufactory, we came up with the 
appropriate tool for the job.  Our Odour Supplant Janitorial 
Robot product will attack at an unwanted odours and restore 
the air quality to your normal standards.  The Hos-Jar, as we 
fondly call it here, uses a low  body configuration and a 
quiet operational mode to keep it out of view. It\'s swift 
movement will reach any area where it\'s services are needed 
quickly and effortlessly.   
 
The Odour Supplant Janitorial Robot model is also easy to 
maintain and inexpensive to own.   Of course, we back all our 
products with Barzel Manufactory\'s standard 20 years warranty 
so you don\'t have to worry about a thing. Our full catalogue 
of various Odours and pesticides add-on canisters is available 
at no charge.   Whichever odour you need, we can supply you 
with it.  
 
Our company offices and product exhibitions are available at 
most major starports (Aubaine, Trybec, Aurora and our new 
offices in the Kruyter system) and of course, you can always 
reach us at Barzel Manufactory\'s main offices:

                        ----
 
Physical & Technical Description:
 
The Odour Supplant-Janitorial Robot model utilise a low, 
semispherical shaped composite laminate hull which provides 
its main structural support.  A short arm is based on the top 
of the hull, housing the odour emitter mechanism and a tube 
which is attached to the externally mounted odour/pesticide 
canister at the rear of the hull.  The arm\'s installation 
resembles a turret, with the ability to turn 360 degrees, thus 
providing an superb coverage of the area around the robot.   
 
A basic visual sensor is installed towards the front of the 
hull, just below the arm\'s installation.   It provides the 
robot with basic pattern recognition;  For example, the 
Hos-Jar will recognise Humans, walls, Hivers and everything 
else in its way as obstacles.  Although, it could also be 
pre-programmed to track a specific configuration, colour or 
smell of an obstacle.  Be it a rat, Ithklur or a foul-smelling 
vac suit, the Hos-Jar will distinguish it and spray it if 
so programmed.
 
The Smoke/Gas Detector sensor is installed alongside the basic 
visual sensor.  As described before, it can be pre-programmed 
to detect a specific odour/smoke/gas, follow the programmed 
instructions and handle it.   Located underneath these two 
sensors is the internal speaker.   This device can be 
pre-programmed with a small number of Anglic words and it comes 
with miscellaneous other options like Male/Female voice, voice 
volume and more. (Note:  Barzel Manufactory recently announced 
the availability of alternative sound cards for the Schalli 
and Ithklur languages).   
 
The Hos-Jar\'s TL-10 storage battery provide for its power 
requirements and is installed internally at the base of the 
hull, just below the CPU brain unit.  The battery is the only 
component used in this model that is manufactured & shipped to 
Apollo from Trybec instead of being scavenged from Apollo 
itself.   This high performance battery provides for 5 hours 
of continuous operation and is easily recharged.
 
And last, The Hos-Jar\'s robot brain unit.   This state of the art, 
TL-8, unit is produced solely from the finest recovered components 
available.  It resides on top of the battery, and is easily 
accessed by lifting the arm\'s installation.   The housing contains 
the CPU unit and the varied sensory pre-programmed cards.   The 
brain is occupied with Barzel Manufactory\'s patented PRAC/1 
[Pattern Recognition Algorithm Card, Class 1] (As discussed above, 
regarding the basic visual sensor).  
 
All of the cards, including the brain, can be easily programmed 
using a TL-8+ hand/standard computer, the owner\'s password and the 
MCE [Module Customising Extension], located on top of the CPU 
unit.   Just plug-in the cord to the computer\'s standard port and 
Hos-Jar\'s brain will display the options that are accessible to you.
 
                        ----
 
Referee\'s Notes & Adventure Hooks:

The Hos-Jar can be added to most Traveller/Megatraveller/Traveller: 
The New Era campaigns readily and can provide for a broad & richer 
atmosphere & background in the adventure.   The Odour Supplant 
Janitorial Robot is designed to be used as an NPC by the referee.   
Be it a minor encounter in the bar, or a mini-adventure on its own, 
here are some tips which can help you run the Odour Supplant 
Janitorial Robot Model by Barzel Manufactory in your Traveller 
adventure.
 
If you look closely at the Design Notes, you might notice that the model 
suffers from a shortage of power. This 0.000008 MW shortage is not 
obvious during normal operations, since not all of the components 
work at the same time.   However, if the power requirement is 
stretched to its limit i.e.: If the Basic Visual Sensor and the 
Odour/Gas Detector, plus the Odour Emitter, arm and the brain start 
to operate simultaneously, unknown effects might occur.    The main 
reason for this is that the brain is the main power hog in the 
model, thus it will be the one developing minor quirks in its 
operation.
 
These quirks can range from simple ones, for example, the brain 
won\'t shut off the gas emitter, thus, flooding the bar with sweet 
aroma which will irritate a group of Vargrs.  This will provoke them to 
pursuit the Hos-Jar down and destroy it, causing a commotion which 
may lead to various adventure hooks.  
 
- The owners wants the Vargrs to pay for his 20,000Cr Hos-Jar which 
  they destroyed and hires the PCs to find them and obtain the money 
  from them.
 
- The PCs help the Vargrs out by shutting off the Hos-Jar (in a 
  friendly way), thus gaining the gratitude of the Vargrs/Bar owner 
  which may lead to miscellaneous rumours/job offers.
 
- [More to come...]
 
Another problem with this model is that the arm can only handle a 
load of 480g while the Gas Emitter installed on it weight 500g.   
This problem plus the poor agility of the arm (AGL 2) can be used 
by the referee to turn them into either witty scenes
or terrifying ones.  For example:

That Andor and Candory. Andor was spelled with a y in one of the earliest
publications, but all (most?) other sources leave it out. No official
explanation for the interdict has been published, but note the curious 
fact that they have functioning starports despite being interdicted.
Also I think we\'ve seen Droyne ships (in _Merchant Prince_?) that are
registered to Andor mucking about the Marches.

In my universe.................
...................... However, since the locals were already Imperial
clients they have the right to come and go as they please. Hence Droyne
ships from Andor plying the spacelanes with impunity.

Imperial scientists have been known to obtain permission to visit Andor
and Candory on those extremely rare occasions where the Droyne have
invited them to examine an Ancient site.

I like this. It jibes very well with the info in CT \'Fighting Ships....\'
that states that the quarantine is enforced by no less than Tigress class
BB\'s.

It is some time that my players do not engage in hand to hand cbt. 
In any case, as far as I recall, I  have used the blocking factor as the 
Wpn Def factor in the to hit task (page 69 in the Players\' Manual).

I decided for this choice since the single task combination:

To Hit another unit with a hand-to-hand attack 
has for the defender both the Wpn skill and the mysterious Wpn Def...

Concerning the TL 14 Iridium brigade I am currently trying to compute
conglomerate unit values according to the Referee\'s Companion. They will
be posted once ready... designs for the brigade vehicles are on

Late replies to some issues...

1. 5FW and Santanocheev

Norris called him "that buffoon" in "Survival Margin", and the SMC book says
that Santanocheev was working off invalid info given to him by the ONI (in
my campaign, my players refer to them as "The Offal of Naval Intestines",
indicating that they are held in high regard (not!). The ONI were apparently
convinced that the Zhos were organising a major push thru Efate, rather than
the Abyss Rift. Consequently, he was in the process of diverting ships away
from Rhylanor - which would have been disastrous.

2. Interdicted Droyne worlds

I think that the xboat316 reply was right - they were interdicted when the
Imperium discovered that they were psionic. Also, the Imperium believed that
one of these worlds was the Droyne homeworld - potential threats from
still-functional Ancient super-weapons would be a walid reason for
interdiction, don\'t you agree?

3. Droyne Invisibility

My bet is for the "Plateau eyes" effect (_A Gift From Earth_, Larry Niven) -
the
victim ignores the Droyne totally. This agrees with Andy Lilly\'s response #3,
Rob Prior and J Roberson.

       ##    meet women of the former USSR through romance ads    ##

     Months ago, Olga Kosmina placed my personal ad in several papers of the
former Soviet Union.  Since that time I have received over 40 responses for
the $50 I mailed Olga.  (I believe she paid the newspapers something around 
$35 and kept the rest for her efforts.)
     I have found greater success and savings by placing my own personal 
romance advertisement rather than purchasing addresses through Russian
"bride"

This is Paul Sanders. After an absense of a little over a year, I am 
ready to get back into the thick of things. I talked with Kevin Knight 
last evening to learn the status of The Traveller Chronicle #8.
Kevin tells me that altho slightly behind schedule, it should be ready 
shortly. He also told me that he could use submissions, 
articles/adventures in particular.

So...if you\'ve always wanted to see your name in print, dust off that old 
scenario from your last campaign and send it to either Kevin 
(sword.knight@genie.geis.com) or myself (imperium@netcom.com). I\'d be 
happy to forward any items on to Kevin, and I\'d be delighted to work on 
illustrations to accompany your submission.

Speaking of which.... Bill White, if you are still out there, I did get
your article on planting colonies in the Far Frontiers Sector. I liked it
and want to discuss the layout of the floorplans for the colonial outpost
with you, so please contact me and we can take it from there. 

Happy Travelling,

Paul

The ordinary low berths are for travelling just like stated
in the rules. Emergency low berths are for, yes, just that,
emergencies. They differ from ordinary low berths in at
least two ways:

1. I don\'t remember where it says this, although Starship
Operators Manual would be a good guess, but
emergency low berths can hold 4 persons at a time.
Of course they all have to be frozen at the same time.
This is the main reason for the difference in volume, etc.

2. Emergency low berths freeze people very quickly and
thaw them very slowly, where ordinary low berths both
freeze and thaw at a moderate pace. There\'s a trade-off
between time required for freezing and time required for
thawing. This is all detailed in the article about low berths
in TD 21(?).
As far as I remember, every low berth can be set to act
as other types, but they come with a standard setting.
With emergency low berths one would assume that the
highest priority would be to be frozen as fast as possible,
hence the setting with fast freeze time and slow thaw time.
With low berths for a frozen watch, for example, freeze time
is very slow and thaw time very fast, because what matters
is that one can get replacement troops as fast as possible.

Besides Mark Seeman\'s comments about the traditional use as a way to hold
up to four adult human-sized people in emergency situations, the other 
use for Traveller\'s emergency low berths is as a livestock low berth. 
Each would hold one or a number of animals of up to 400 kg mass suspended
while in transit.  The ELB\'s in the original Far Trader design from the
original Traveller were apparently for this purpose, primarily.

Hello there.

Well, I would have to agree that missiles are difficult to redesign with 
the rules at present.  What you need is a copy of Special Supplement 3, 
Missiles in Traveller, which was included in JTAS #21.  Although, this 
makes things only a little clearer.

I have not been able to reproduce the MT standard ship missile with this 
system, and according to its rules, the Nuclear and Antimatter missiles 
would not be able to be fired from a missile turret.  This has to do with 
ships missiles being packaged in special missile tubes that hold the 
missiles right up until firing.  They are actually fired in these standard
"shipping/launch container" packages, which hold 50kg of missile, which 
is the way in which missile construction is based, on weight.  As Nuclear 
and Antimatter missiles are 70kg and 90kg respectively, they will not fit 
in a standard shipping container and cannot be fired from a standard 
missile turret\'s launch rails.

In this supplement, I have also found major typos in the construction 
formulae versus the written rules.  So I have adopted the use of the 
written rules.  Antimatter missiles do not exist in this supplement, but 
Fusion warheads do, as do Enhanced Radiation.  It also contains three 
types of solid fuel propulsion systems which allow any propulsion rating 
you want with the necessary rules.  You wanna 6G6?  Sure, no prob.  OH, 
BTW, that is 6 1200 second rounds.

My advice to you all is to fix the rules with major infusions of 
Striker.  There is some neat stuff in this supplement, but it is for 
Classic Trav, not Mega.

I myself have always liked the Star Trek torpedo concept, so I have been 
modifying the rules to generate bigger missiles, if need be.

	Ciao,
	Anthony

MT missiles seem to have a bit of an identity crisis.
The info from COACC is based on a "rule of thumb" in the back of the Striker 
rules which says: use 15 cm for turret and 25 cm for bay missile warheads.
This seemed to be to reduce the otherwise very large number of missiles in 
play while still having an appropriate level of firepower from a bay.

 ----

I thought 6G6 indicated a maximum acceleration of 6G per turn with fuel for 
6 G-turns of acceleration although I might have that wrong.
This is from Special Supplement 3: Missiles.
The turns were assumed to be 1000 seconds ( use 1200 seconds for MT ).

In case it might help shed some light, way back in 1978, GDW published a game
called MAYDAY,  one of thier Series 120 games which they called a "variant"
of the Traveller ("classic") starship rules.  Marc Miller was it\'s designer.
 In MAYDAY Miller writes:  "The acceleration, or G factor for vessels (in
MAYDAY this includes missles) is expressed as an indication of maximum
acceleration for the movement phase, and maximum total acceleration allowed
before fuel exhaustion.  Thus 1G5 indicates a maximum course change of 1 hex
(per movement phase), and a total course change of 5 hexes."   If Miller\'s
and GDW\'s past use of the 6G6 style notation is any indication, 6G6 means
that the missle can pull 6 Gs for 1 turn, or 1 G for 6 turns, or 2 Gs for 3
turns, or 2 Gs for 1 turn and 4 Gs for a second turn, etc.

But to confuse matters futher, in MAYDAY the turns were _100  minutes_ and a
hex was 1 light second across!  Those 6G6 missles (which were standard in the
game) could haul butt, accelerating at a constant 1 G for 10 hours!!

By the way MAYDAY is still my favorite system for small ship movement and
combat.  It\'s simple and elegant, only has 7 pages of rules so new players
can be controling ships in a short time, and meshes very well with Classic
Traveller.  It meshes a little less well with MegaTraveller.

Hope this helps.

I seem to remember, from my days fireing shuch things that the bullets
don\'t come out in bursts of four .... you are taught to fire your
weapon in short controlled bursts .... ie 4 rounds .... but this dose
not mean that four rounds have to come out, hold down the trigger too
long and more come out, too short and less come out. GDW probs said in 4
bullet bursts, so they didn\'t have to make the character role another
task during combat "Routeen Submachine Gun \'Controlled Burst\' Task"
succsess :- number of rounds character wants to come out
failier :- more or less depending on the Ref

Lightning Bolts are OK, you just have to put your players in an electrical
storm .... ;-)

It\'s your game so you rule .... but GDW are matching real life which means
30 round mags.

I don\'t see why. I view the four bullet burst as a simplification
of Traveller\'s \'reality\', so I guess that SMGs really can fire
bursts of any amount of bulllets from one up to it\'s clip
capacity.

In real life, not all SMGs fire bursts of four, so why should
the manufacturer produce a weapon with clips holding a
multiplum of four? Rather he/she would produce a clip
with a practical size.

Remember, BTW, that in MegaTraveller, SMGs can also
fire bursts of 10 bullets, so in that case your 32 bullet clip
won\'t do anyway.

But then, in real life, the H&K MP5 family doesn\'t have a 30 round mag
available. They have (from memory), 15, 24, 32, and 40 round capacity
magazines, though. And then there\'s the M-16, whose 30 round magazine
is less than reliable with 30 rounds, so you only load 25-28 rounds . . .

There is no hard and fast rule in real life for magazine capacity.

    'body' => 'Okay, here I am again with more questions about the MT combat rules.  
This time I\'m confused about interrupts, especially as they relate to
hand-to-hand combat, direct fire combat and the tactical points pool.

Here goes:

1. The group with the highest tactical points skill level decides who
   goes first in a combat scenario.  Fine.  Now, if both sides have an
   equal amount of Tactics skill, who wins?  I\'ve been having each side
   roll 1d6, with the highest value having the initiative.  Am I doing 
   this right?

2. Let\'s say I have Tactics-1 and you have no Tactics.  We engage in 
   HTH combat.  Because of my Tactics skill, I should go first.  Does it
   make sense, then, to have you able to interrupt me?  According to the 
   rules, "the defender may attempt to preempt the attack by interrupting 
   the attacker" in HTH combat.  That means that, if the interrupt roll
   is successful, my Tactics did me no good at all.  What\'s up with that?

3. There doesn\'t appear to be anything in the rules preventing a character
   from interrupting his direct-fire opponent.  For example, A is shooting
   at B.  B sees this and interrupts A, which means B is firing first.
   Now, does this make sense?  I understand if a character (say, C) sees
   A shooting at B and decides to interrupt A and shoot at A.  However, if
   B can interrupt B\'s own attacker, then what\'s the point of determining
   who goes first?  Am I missing something here?

I\'m wondering if interrupts are a waste of time and introduce unneeded
complexity into the game.  How do other people feel?

Well, there are several ways of deciding which side goes
first. The official rule is the side with the largest tactical
points pool, but, as you mention, this is not always decisive
(my players\' PCs often don\'t have tactics skill at all).
There\'s no official rule concerning what to do in this
situation, but DGP did mention this: As always in MT, don\'t
let rigid rules bog you down. Use common sense. This
was the way the rules were made in the first place.
DGP also makes some *suggestions* on the subject: Let
the person with the highest leader skill decide which side
goes first or flip a coin (or, as you do, 1D6).
Common sense could go something like this: The always
jumpy and paranoid PCs have been ready for combat for
hours, whereas the guards they have to battle are in a
slightly disadvantageous situation. Not enough to justify a
surprise, mind you. Then I would have my players go first.

Well, you could always try to interrupt back. It is quite
possible to interrupt the interrupt. But remember the rule
which says only one interrupt per side per turn is allowed.
But as an interrupt is somewhat of a "charging towards the
enemy with your guns ablazing", it wouldn\'t be too
appropiate in a HTH situation. Remember that the only DM
you get on the task roll is your movement speed.
So your opponent would have to roll 7+ on 2D6 to interrupt
you (not that hard), but then you could try the same.

As stated above, just interrupt back.

The rule was made to enable a player to state something
like this: "I\'m going to jump out of cover and rush towards
the enemy while emptying my gauss rifle to cover my
friend\'s butt."
You don\'t have to use the interrupt rule all of the time. Only
when it seems appropriate. Again, use common sense.
The MT rules are flexible enough to allow for that, and was,
in fact, designed with just that purpose in mind.

First off, I have a problem with this whole tactical point pool rule. 

The problems I see with this are: 

1. Why is tactics more important than dexterity? 

2. If players have differen ideas about how to fight an enemy, why should
their tactics be put together?

I think that alot of the Traveller combat system believes that two sides
of a combat are going to act as two whle groups rather than as 
individuals. 

I think a better way is have each person roll d6 and add his dex/5 and
his own tactic skill. Blast interrupts. Let people hold their turns
so they can say something like "I can go now but I will wait for 
my turn so that i can cover Joe the Vulcan"

One thing I found with Mayday was that firing 6G missiles after
fleeing 6G ships is pointless - they will never catch up.

On round 1, the missile has a vector of 6 hexes + the firing
ship\'s vector. On subsequent rounds, it will only increase
this by 6 hexes - just what the enemy ship is doing.

Against slower ships, they may catch up... but will probably
run out of fuel first.

..This may be another argument for x-ray laser detonation
missiles (wash your mouth out!), or: FASTER MISSILES!

I found it is possible to create a STANDARD missile which is
capable of 10G, and then created military missiles capable of
21G! Combat in Mayday becomes easier and more like HG - missiles
hit in the turn they are fired, so no before-during-after vector
counters are necessary.

These missiles were turret-capable. I will try to dig out my
old designs, but I am not promising anything - I think they are
at the bottom of the pile.

Tactics governs group activity, not any individual

I\'ve never been in the military, nor in any covert operations, 
nor in any other situation where I was intentionally exposing 
myself to violence, but if I were going to do so with other 
adventurers, I would damned well be sure that, if violence arose,
I could count on them to act cohesively and competently and for 
the good of the group.

>I think that alot of the Traveller combat system believes that

>rather than as individuals. 

Yes, I think it does.  I\'m not going to raid Genentech\'s corporate
offices, nor sabotage Alameda Naval Air Station, nor hijack the
Larkspur/SF ferry with people I don\'t know, who have their own 
agendas and goals, and who might start shooting when to do so will
blow surprise and get us all killed, or who will shoot at their own
preferred targets of opportunity and not at the squad of troops about 
to kill me.  My character isn\'t likely to participate in such actions 
against the 58th Century equivalents in those circumstances, either.

In refereeing and playing various rpgs for almost 20 years, I\'ve found 
that conflicts among player characters that lead to a lack of trust 
on the battlefield are the most likely causes of failed missions and 
failed games.  I suspect the same is true for real world small groups 
engaged in organized violence.

I\'ve found that mature players generally have no problems acting as a group. 
Sure there are disagreements, but they get resolved at the planning stages. 
When I started reffing games for my high school students I had a hard time
adjusting to the "every player for himself" style of the less mature players.
 

Now, there are games (such as Paranoia) when backstabbing and treachery are
essential.  If everyone knows they are playing this style game, and it is
just a game, then I wouldn\'t label it immature.  Generally, though, I\'ve
found "going your own way" strongly correlated to "sulks", "argues with GM",
and "carries grudges between games".  

That said, I\'d rather play with some of my high school students than many
adults.  Great people, and getting better.

        Did you ever work on the Life Path generator you mentioned on
        the 18 sept 1994? :)
        
- At TL17 Antimatter fuel becomes available.  Wouldn\'t Jump drive use
    AM fuel just as easily as Hydrogen fuel?  How to modify the
design
    sequence for this?
    
    You could introduce this as new technology as a basis for a 
    hi-tech adventure.
    I end up with around 2.534 Kl of antimatter fuel for every jump
    unit installed above TL16.  
    Now, this greatly reduces the volume of fuel required
    (from 135 Kl of Hyd to 5.068 Kl of antimatter for a Jump 1-100
tons)
    but it costs a great deal more to run (4735 Cr for Hyd refuel,
    3167500 Cr for a AM refuel!) so this is definitely NOT for 
    everyday usage.  It\'s great for Star Trigger delivery systems
    though. <snicker> <bows to the great Daryen gods of technology
and
    counter-espionnage>

    Note that in TNE MAA systems are 400 times more fuel efficient
    than in MT.  Divide fuel requirements by 400.  In this case fuel
    cost for a jump is about twice that of a standard Hyd jump.
    Which is correct?
    
- Errata for MegaT: On page 69 and 88 of the referee book, the
neutrino
    sensors (tl 18 and 20) are incorrectly marked as having 1 kw

    instead of .1 kw.  Same goes for the last line on the Neutrino
    Sensor table on page 88.
    Is this in the MT Errata?  I haven\'t found it.
    TNE/FFS ignores this completely.

- Regarding my assumptions on possible mobs of Aslan Pirates and
Outcasts:
        
        First, I\'d like to point out that there is an adventure for
        Aslan outcasts in Alien Realms called Ahriy Uprising.

        Second, here are a few numbers I came up with - I had to make
some
        of them up without a lot of guidelines though:
                The total Aslan population is about 3.5E10 in the
Hierate,
        plus 1.05E9 outside the hierate for a total of 3.605E10.
        One of the most likely reasons to become an outcase seems to
be 
        pride and ambition. Overly ambitious aslans will try to bite
more 
        than they can chew and get into hot water (or even cold
water, do 
        aslans evem LIKE water?:).
        Let\'s say we have 5 thousandths of such kind of people. 
        (Which comes out to 1 aslan out of 200, which seems
reasonable)  
        We get 1.8E8 outcasts. 
                It seems that outcasts are not always forcefully
thrown out 
        of Aslan society, it depends on the reason why they\'re
outcast.
        Let\'s say that about 60% of these outcasts live outside the
Hierate
        ->1.08E8 outcasts.
                Spread out evenly among the ~210 system outside the
Hierate: 
        5.15E5 outcasts for each system.  
                This means we have about 10% of the population of
systems 
        that is actually made out of Outcasts outside of the Hierate.
 
                Aslans get thrown out of the Clan, sometimes along
with 
        their whole Ahriy.  Since these are prides, not all of the
are 
        actually mature.  Let\'s say 50% of these DO have careers.
        Only about 45% of these have the possibility to become
pirates:
        that would be 115875 pirates PER SYSTEM!!!.
        Now, most outcasts are just as honorable as the next
        aslan, they just don\'t show it the same way.  Let\'s say only
5 0/00
        of these aslans actually do become criminals.
        580 criminals, 50% of which would prey on ennemy clans.
        That leaves about 291 working as pirates or
        tourist traps for those who can\'t make the difference between
a 
        True Aslan and a barbarian.  Considering the high crew
requirements
        and ground support, I would say that means there\'s a
possibility
        of about 6 medium Outcast Pirate bands and 12 medium True
Aslan 
        Pirate bands.
        18 total, so a 8.5% chance of meeting an aslan pirate band
outside
        the Hierate.  (About 1 chance on 12 so that fits well in an
        encounter table :)
        So strike my Hordes of Aslan Pirates and outcasts theory. :)
        Any comments?  I know my computations are pretty convoluted
and
        innacurate.

Any public or private comments appreciated.

Unlike the previous versions Delta is structured as a reinforced

Compared to a typical armoured cavalry regiment this unit has a more
significant complement of ground troops.
The displacement tons for vehicles are also given.

3 Cavalry sqdns: each 113 vehicles (27 CGT), 403 troopers, 3158 Mcr, 1210

EW cmp: 14 vehicles, 56 troopers, 434 Mcr, 140 tons

Rgt summary: 
4 MGB, 475 vehicles (81 CGT), 1945 troopers, 21196 Mcr, 11250 tons

Each Cavalry sqdn is on:
3 cavalry trps (each on 2 scout lances, 2 tank lances, 1 support sect, 1 HQ
plt)
1 tank company (on 3 tank plt of 4 CGTs + 2 CGTs) with 14 CGTs
1 HQ plt (4 IFV + 4 RCEV))
1 artillery btr (2 FIST sects on 4 FIST each + 4 IFV + 4 RCEV)


Scout lance : 6 IFV + 60 troopers
Tank lance : 4 CGT
Support section: 2 ADV
Troop HQ  plt 1 CGT + 2 IFV

Note that a large fraction of both cost and displacement is due to the 4
meson gun boats. A TL15 version of the rgt could field a similar firepower at
a significant lower cost.

Note also that in my previous posts the hit points for vehicles were
computed using the hull values. I will update in the following days
the table to consider the most vulnerable drive instead. This makes
a 10 ton vehicle more vulnerable to hits than 4-5 troopers...

I have 12 (count em, 12) factory-original 30-round HK magazines for *my*

While there are a number of pre-ban (1994 magazine ban, that is) magazines
for the MP5 in a wide variety of capacities (the 40-round MaxCap mag most
immediately comes to mind) Heckler & Koch themselves only make 15 and 30
round mags for the weapons.

                     And then there\'s the M-16, whose 30 round magazine
> is less than reliable with 30 rounds, so you only load 25-28 rounds . . .

This is true for almost all SMGs (and assault rifles).  Underloading
each mag by a round or two will generally increase the odds of a successsful
clip insertion.

Imagine an Imperial Marine gets in a gunfight with a gold medal gymnast at 
the Imperial Olympics. My money\'s on the Marine to get the first (and last) 
shot off, even if the gymnast outpoints him/her heavily in the dex
department.

Traveller seems to assume that training is more important than natural 
ability in this sort of situation; for the most part, I agree with them. 
Tactics skill was probably chosen as a pretty good indication of this sort 
of training.

Which is not to say that this should be a hard and fast rule - there are 
many times that I want to run a combat round without any actual combat 
happening (during a chase scene, or whatever). In those cases, I\'d 
substitute something else for Tactics (appropriate vehicle skill, for
example).

>I think that alot of the Traveller combat system believes that two sides

>individuals. 

This is true, and seems generally true for the Traveller rules. All the ship 
combat and construction rules beyond the original 3 booklets, for example, 
seem to be written for big warships battling fleet actions, rather than the 
small ship-to-ship actions that a scruffy group of adventuring 
"entrepreneurs" are likely to be involved in. While I appreciate the realism 
in rules that say the crew of the Centennial Eagle will be vaporized if they 
try and buzz an Imperial Destroyer (Star or otherwise), there are times when 
I want a group of PCs to be more heroically than the rules normally
encourage.

For my two cents worth on the subject, I think that the skill TACTICS allows
the experienced person to set up a "killing field" and respond to situations
of surprise when they find themselves in a firefight.  The skill TACTICS in
my campaign does not always outdo someone with high dexterity: it all
depends on the situation.

If what you have is two guys in a street drawing down on each other in
gunslinger fashion, there really isn\'t much INHO that the skill of TACTICS
will add to my defense.  If I am in that situation, I want to be the quicker
of the two, with the steadiest aim and the best luck, not a sound strategist
or tactician.

However, if you will give me time to assess the situation and use my TACTICS
skill to evaluate the situation aforehand I am going to find that sucker
from 500-600 meters w/my ranged in rifle and do them in, lay an ambush to
them on the way to the street or whatever, using in best fashion all of the
resources available to me at that time.

There is a lot to be said for TACTICS and DEX, but the situation should rule
and as always the GM is the final arbiter.

getting enough email that I think it\'s time to clarify a few things.

I understand the utility of interrupts in a many-to-many combat situation.
If person A sees enemy B about to give a killing shot to A\'s friend C,
then it is reasonable to expect A to try to interrupt B.

My problem is if, in the above example, C tries to interrupt B.  I\'m 
finding that it is not fair to allow a person to interrupt one\'s own
attacker.  The rules make this clear for hand-to-hand combat but imply
that it\'s okay in direct fire combat.  I am beginning to disagree with
this implication.

Basically, I\'m looking for a good reason to allow interrupts against
one\'s own attacker in direct fire situations.  Can anyone come up with
a good example of where it\'s realistic?

Someone pointed out that the initiative being discussed here is not like
the D&D initiative.  With MT, having the initiative means you get to say
who goes first.  I maintain that, in 99% of the cases involving non-military
player characters, it is essential that the side with the initiative goes
first.
Traveller combat is very deadly.  The person who gets off the first shot 
usually survives.

   Notes for all nukes:
   1. Turret warheads all fit in standard 15 cm missiles and weigh 15 kg;
   2. Bay warheads all fit in standard 25 cm missiles and weigh 60 kg;
   3. Yield is in kilotons, Price in Cr \'000s;
   4. Bays may mount and fire turret missiles, if desired;
   5. The TL 13 "blast-producing" turret warheads = standard HG nukes;
   6. The Surface Explosion (SE) DMs replace the normal HG -6 DM;
   7. The Radiation (Rad) DMs are additional (note that the +6 DM for
      batteries < factor-9 still applies);
   8. The SE effect of the enhanced rad nukes is due to blast and
      "X-ray kill" (_\'Til they Glow_, JTAS #22);
   9. The req\'d _Striker_ storage shielding is inbuilt into the ship\'s
      turrets and bays (or use the MT shielding rules).

   2. Non-weapon payloads
      - flare: TL 6, 10 kg, Cr 500, duration 1 turn
      - probe (remote sensor) - must have radio
        a. Basic EMS: TL 8, 3.5 kg, Cr 2200, 4.5 kWh
        b. Active EMS: use MT rules
           Note: if using Digest Group\'s HG mods, use this rule:
           If a missile battery fires probe ordinance and it "penetrates",
           treat the combat step as if the attacker is at visual range for
           this round; ie. Damage can be seen, Internal explosions can be
           detected, BUT spinal mounts CAN be used.
      - message (sealed compartment): TL 5, Cr 100 per 10 kg of cargo space

e. Internal Power
   Recommended minimum power is:
   Continuous burn   2 turns (2000 secs/0.56 hours)
   Limited burn      3 turns (3000 secs/0.83 hours)
   Discretionary burn 5 turns (5000 secs/1.4 hours)

DESIGN EXAMPLE
==============
Standard TL 8 ship missile, 10G

a. Propulsion System
   Discretionary burn, 2 turns duration (allows for a 20 hex course change)

   Required G-factor = 10
   Mc = 10 + G = 10 + 10           = 20 kg
   Cc = 50 x G^2 = 50 x 10^2       = Cr 5000
   Mf = 0.4 x T x G = 0.4 x 2 x 10 = 8 kg
   Cf = 200 x Mf = 200 x 8         = Cr 1600

b. Guidance System
   Controller   TL 8   3.0 kg   Cr 450   1.5 kWh
   Radio        TL 8   1.3 kg   Cr 500   1.5 kWh

c. Detonation System
   Contact      TL 5   0.5 kg   Cr 100   nil

d. Payload
   Shap. conv. HE  TL 5  10 kg  Cr 500

e. Internal Power
   Minimum duration = 3000 secs = 0.84 hours
   Power drain = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 kWh
   Actual Power req\'d = 3 x 0.84               = 2.52 kWh
   Battery mass @ TL 8: 0.35 kWh/kg, 2.52/0.35 = 7.2 kg
   Battery Price @ Cr 375/kg = 375 x 7.2       = Cr 2340

f. Standard container, 5 kg.

g. Totals:
   Mass  = 20 + 8 + 3 + 1.3 + 0.5 + 10 + 7.2
         = 50 kg + 5 kg container
   Price = 5000 + 1600 + 450 + 500 + 100 + 500 + 2340
         = Cr 10,490

h. Description:
   Standard ship\'s missile, 10G20 discretionary, contact detonation,
   radio receiver, HE warhead, 50 kg, Cr10,490
