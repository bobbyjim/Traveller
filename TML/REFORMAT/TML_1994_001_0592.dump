Hmmm, an interesting image: `rural ghetto\' that doesn\'t sound all that
bad now.  I guess I\'m confused.  What exactly, then, is the problem with
being `ghettoized\'?

Okay, so `ghettoized\' means something akin to `exploited\'?

Yup, that\'s how I feel.  I seem to have forgotten the original point.
Maybe I should just concede you this one, Jeff, whatever it was.  :-)

I get your point but when I look at the `term limits\' crowd in light of the
chronically low voter turn out I have to ask myself if it\'s the politicians
who have forgotten their obligations or the citizens?  Remember, the most
powerful politician on the planet\'s term was prematurely `limited\' in 1992
without recourse to any term limiting law.  *That\'s* democracy.

How do `we\' know this?  Someone mentioned *Arrival Vengeance* but I looked

Hmmm, doesn\'t all this government secrecy sort of bring into question
the suggestions that the Regency is somehow more democratic?  [Warning:
this is one of those areas where my Sense of Reason may be at risk of
blaspheming the Holy Writ of GDW.  :-) ]

Okay, let\'s start identifying these factions.  The Isolationists want to
maintain the Quarantine.  The Expansionists want to move into the Wilds.
The Democrats seek to expand `democratic\' values.  The Aristocrats seek
to maintain the *status quo*.  The Tolerants favor a relaxation of psi
prejudices while Santanocheevists oppose any moves toward accommodation
with the Zhodani.  Anybody have other/better names for these groups?  How
about other blocs that haven\'t been identified?  What about Imperialists
who still hope one day to rejoin the Imperium and Autonomists who favor a
complete break from the Imperial past.

Alliances might exist between the Isolationists and the Autonomists; between
the Aristocrats, the Santanocheevists and the Imperialists; between the
Expansionists and the Imperialists; between the Democrats and the Tolerants;
and between the Expansionists and the Tolerants.

This is *so* cool!

Absolutely true (not the `limits\' part though).  The fact that the `Rape of
Trin\' became wide-spread pubic knowledge [FACT ALERT: I don\'t have TNE] must
mean that it served Norris\'s purposes somehow.

I\'m not sure I understand this point.  Are you saying that by taking 
`longer\' to reach the Regency through the Extents the Virus would somehow
be more powerful?  How so?  Wouldn\'t Regency agents have a *better* 
opportunity to observe the Virus which would permit the Regency to better
develop counter measures?

There it is again!  *Please* tell me where in *AV* Jumpstart and Longbow
are mentioned.  Just the page numbers will suffice.

Wait.  Roll back the clock 85 years.  Substitute Strephon for Norris and
Imperium for Regency.  What do you get?  Rebellion.  Hard Times.  The
Viral Collapse.  And yes, da**it, The New Era.  :-)

Doesn\'t the very name `Regency\' suggest a deep felt respect for that `old
order\'?  All the legitimacy of a `regency\' is derived from that for which
the `regent\' is stewarding authority.  To me it is absurd that the *people*
of the Regency would forget what they\'ve been `waiting\' for all these years.
 
A great expansion of the background round robin!

Hi agian

I am going to mention some thoughts I have had about the Regency.
I feel that the Regency and the Counslate have become closer thgether
both econamically and in looking coreward. The Zhodani might find it 
useful to have some of the Scouts on some of their explorations. As 
well as the expansion into the unexplored areas to coreward.
The Vargar threat is not as much of a "paper Dog" soem have made it 
out to be I think tha tthe Corsairs can be a very serious danger to the 
borders\' econimy ( yes I know I can\'t spell ) Two things I think was done
was the Hiring of some of the " Iheati " to help the Domain to deal with
the Vargar the other is the breakup of the large fleets into the smaller
"task " groups much better able to deal with the Vargar small Corsair 
fleets. ( What a Political struggle in the Admrility That was...)
Then the Virus hit...
The Aslan are still the Patrol and the small task groups are the 
Quarrintine forces.
Most of the adventures into the Corridor sector and into the old imperium
are either Covert Government, or of private Noble families ( younger sons,
and daughters) especally those with a Scout tradition in the Family.
The Regancy has more data available to it locations of Naval Depots,
Research stations and industrial worlds. They will send Covert Missions 
to find some of the jumpstart caches. ( mentioned in Survival Margin!)
Also at least one expidition to find "Long Bow" ( also mentioned in 
Survival Margin) Then in 12xx ( I can\'t remember the exact date )
but some thing is comming and the Regancy MUST be ready for whatever 
it is. The government knows that something is on the way.
Here is an adventure for you find the longbow information, Were is it?
Behind the curtin?
There are some more possibilities... a combined expidition Regancy - 
Zhodani that finds out what Longbow is about.
I could go on but I am sure you can see that we are not locked into just
the RC stuff that is published.
I know that some of you will not agree with my estimates. Oh Well You use 
what you feel fits for you game it\'s what makes the game so interesting.
I am speaking in general terms there are some spefic forces at work that
I don\'t feel like mentioning now because some of my players are on here.
and I don\'t want to give them to much information before they are ready.
or they could use it or mess it up...
James if I have blown it on the Zhodani please Correct me. ( James Kundert
is more knowlageable than I about them. ) I do know that they have some very
sharp traders!
Ok I think I have Babbled on for a while time to Quit...
Oh there is a couple of articles on StarPorts in JTAS. ( I\'ll look for them
but all I can do is give the No.s and dates... I don\'t have a Scanner and 
that would not be legal anaway... :-) )

I tend to feel that the Coalition is not the UFP with a single way of
thinking
(Prime Directive).  There are between 10 and 20 worlds of varying sizes
within
the Coalition and although they roughly fall between two outlooks (Oriflamme
led Centrists and the Federalists of Aubaine) each world has its own spin on
policy, with differences within the people of each world (so there are
probably some Centrist backers from Aubaine).

From PoT: "There are real tensions between the different cultures of the
Coalition . . . players, even if from different worlds, may be willing to put
these differences behind them and work together in harmony... That\'s kind of
the point of the Coalition, after all.  NPCs ... may not be quite so braod
minded... Nobody is likely to pull a gun ... but don\'t expect covert agents
working for the Oriflamme Marine Intelligence (as opposed to the RC) to blow
their cover just to help out ... eye-lights that get into a jam..."  Eye-
lights being starry-eyed Federalists.

Therefore it seems that RC missions may all have the same objectives and
rules
of engagement but the member worlds also are conducting missions into the
Wilds and they are operating according to their own rules.

Finally I do agree that this background with its diversity and its element of
the unknown is a "*more* interesting setting than a stable government" would
provide.  Throw into this mix the evil Star Guild (may they die in poverty)
and the Vampire Data Net makes it a more volatile setting than the 3I.

I don\'t know how many of you are HIWG members, but those of you who are
will by looking through the back issues of AABP see that I have made
several changes to the Gvurrdon sector. Rukh and Anti-Rukh are long
gone. The new troublespots are the border between Thirz Empire and
Society of Equals. Anyone interested in getting data for Gvurrdon in TNE
please mail me a DD disk and I\'ll return it with whatever I got. (couple
of 100K) This information has been mailed to GDW. (And it would be nice
if you let me know that you have received it and looked at it [hint,
hint]). HIWG members may get this from Clay Bush.

I don\'t think Regency would foster instability in Gvurrdon. If whats
remaining of Gvurrdon falls to the Virus, it just mean that Regency have
to commit more resources to protect that border. And likewise with
Zhodani. In my campaign Thirz Empire is Zhodani backed, while what\'s
left of Thoengling are Imperial backed. And the zoo needs the stability
much as Regency needs it.

 ...key word & tricky phrase was "my interpretation".  Based on the

my interpretation of the fate of Imperial "interstellar culture".  As

    Both, in my opinion...  but we\'re straying into alt.politics.  
Especially ironic when you consider that the citizenry were manipulated by 
the media and out-and-out *lied* to by the "boy from Hope"... Slick 
Willie is a "wonderful" example of politicians in a democracy 
forgetting who his obligations belong to.

After reading Jeff\'s post about the threat from the Virus from the Vargr
border then I don\'t think the Regency will be anxious to foster instability
in the Extents *either* but (there\'s always a `but\', isn\'t there?) *if*
there really is such a threat of Virus from the Extents then it seems to
me the Vargr are going to be somewhat `occupied\' themselves and won\'t
pose much of a threat to the Regency.  On the other hand, *if* there is
really such a threat of Virus from the Extents is it still fair to claim
that the Regency ought to be able to venture into the Wilds where it will
face the Virus head on?

If the Regency is equipped to deal with the Virus in the Wilds then it
ought not to face a `greater\' threat of Virus from the Extents (I know
Jeff still has some clarification on this point) and ought to be comfortable
fomenting instability in the Extents if a credible threat from the *Vargr*
(as opposed to the Virus) is perceived.  If Virus from the Extents *is*
a threat then the Regency ought not foment instability among the Vargr (and
doesn\'t *need* to either) and probably *isn\'t* capable of taking on the
Virus directly in the Wilds either.  I don\'t see how it can be both ways.

I agree completely.  I recognize and enjoy the fact that each of us will
have our own take on the `official\' background.  I was just trying to
preface my comments with (an admittedly cynical) acknowledgement of some
TML\'ers\' views that to take issue with what\'s been published in the
`official\' literature is pointless.  Some folks (not me) feel one `can\'t
argue with the rules\' which, since I don\'t have any TNE products anyway,
I sometimes find myself doing.  :-)

Thanks for the pointer.  I don\'t have *SM* but I looked in *AV* again
today and, although a personal message from Strephon to Norris is mentioned,
the jumpstart caches are not (nor is Longbow).  It is suggested that Seldrian
`takes an interest\' in Avery but we\'re not told why.  We\'re told Avery is
`about\' eight years old in 1126 which puts his birth(?) sometime in 1118 -
after Strephon had reappeared and *after* it was clear the Imperium would
not rally to his banner.  Coincidence?

Greetings, Sophonts!
	An interesting point came up in yesterday\'s game -- A combat situation
came up on Knorbes in Regina, a TL 2 planet.  Basically, one of the locals
attempted to lop the head off of one of my players.  It was our first
collective foray into the TNE rules (and my first time running combat with
them) and questions invariably arose.  The most pressing is the following:

If armor (Say, for example, Ballistic Weave) with an Armor Value of 1 is
good enough to drop a die of damage off of a pen 1 weapon or completely
negate damage from a pen NIL weapon, why does it only stop 2 points of
sword damage?  A sword does 2d6 damage, average of 7 points of damage,
reduced to 5 points (granted, not much) with the AV 1 armor, while it
will completely stop a 9mm TL6 autopistol with ball ammo.  If anybody
has a good \'realistic\' explanation of this phenomenon I\'ve got a player
*eager* to hear it :)

On a similar front, the same guy would like to know if you could wear
a Flak jacket over Ballistic Weave (For the laser protection:)?  I ruled
that it would be *possible*, but that it\'d probably be like wearing a ski
jacket over a snowmobile suit.  Any comments?

Sorry to muddy the recent thrust towards more \'setting\'-type discussions
with this rules ironmongery, but my group is eager to hear the collected
wisdom of the net on these matters...

Why not a middle ground? Imperial Culture (capital letters, please) that had
1,000 to ingrain itself won\'t be wiped out by a 70-year gap. Even the entire
Dark Ages didn\'t wipe away the influence of Rome on, for example, Northern
Europe. And look how long others tried to keep the "idea" of the Ceasars
going - all the way up to the last Czar. 
    In the New Era, the Noble Houses may change, technology may be viewed in
a new light (ie, with suspiscion; once you see Uncle Ed eaten by his
mulchmower, how eager are you gonna be to mow the hypergrass on Rigel-7?),
but the basic Imperial societal structure will be far harder to wipe out
completely, even given the enormous impact of the Hard Times.
    Individual planets may be exceptions, but the "idea" behind the Imperium
is far from dead...and the Eastern Roman Empire (the Regency as the
Byzantium, anyone?) did briefly reunite both halves...

    'body' => 'Greetings and salutations to you all. Oh what the heck, HI EVERYONE!!!
Well, I\'ve been unable to read my mail for a couple of weeks, and BOY have
you guys been BUSY!! I had a brief scan of my accumulated mail (all 460K of
it!), and I have a few comments to make and a question.

First, the question -
One thing that\'s always bugged me about traveller is the fact that lots of 
people (and I\'m referring to people living in the traveller universe) seem
to like living in VERY inhospitable curcumstances, such as on planets with
Exotic, Corrosive and even Insidious atmospheres. I find this rather odd.
	Ok, I can hear everyone saying that there\'s lots of valuable ores
and minerals on these worlds, which are exploited by industry. That\'s all
very well, and I have no problems with this. For example Heavy Metals
Amalgamated finds platinum and lathanum on a particularly nasty Insidious
planet. There\'s just enough to make a small mine cost-effective. So, they
send down a few tens or hundreds of people to build a small underground
mining village and live happily ever after. I can live with this - although
I dare say the employees would rather not....
	What gets me is that there are several worlds in CT, MT, and TNE 
which have very high populations, but type B or C atmospheres. One example
is in Path of Tears (I think its in the same subsector as the planet Lucifer)
which have a population digit of 7 and a type C atm. Lets see, that\'s a few
tens of millions of people living on (or in!) an absolute hell-hole of a 
world (just think, Venus is bad enough and that\'s only a type B atm!). The 
big question is.....WHY?!
	Seriously, I would appreciate some kind of reasoning behind 
condemning millions of people to live in a 750 atm pressure, radioactive
Hydrofluoric Acid atmosphere with oceans that corrode you if you even THINK
about them.....
	And no sneaky saying that the population actually live on the 
planet\'s moon! If they did that, then the more habitable moon should be listed
in the UPP, and not the hellhole it orbits!
	Answers on an email please to ....... zcfbj00@ucl.ac.uk

Now, a few comments before I leave you.

First, MESON HANDGUNS: 		scary.......
	There seems to be a lot of this going about. \'I know, lets see if we
can design a realistic tactical nuclear grenade\' |-). I hope people are 
joking here, otherwise, I think they\'ve missed the point with the iron-
mongery in FF&S. Of course, there are good points to this, just picture a 
mob running around a building lobbing tac nuke grenades through the windows...
Maybe I\'m just being too serious.....

Second, is there any plans to release any solid info on the K\'kree?! I mean,
lots of people have said that the starport rules were a long time coming, but
the poor K\'Kree are practically unknown!! I was really looking forward to DGP
publishing an Alien Module on K\'Kree and HIvers (also largely unknown but this
at least seems about to be rectified by GDW, bless their little cottonsocks!)
as well as modules on the Zhodani and Droyne (there\'s ANOTHER mysterious race
for you), but they (IMHO, flame on, etc) appear to have conveniently copped
out (and let a _lot_ of people down in the process - thanks a lot, DGP...). 
I\'m sorry, but I would imagine that the DGP Alien Modules were fairly 
universal (even non-Traveller GMs could find them very useful) - they were 
very well laid out and also were good reads to boot. For DGP to say that 
they\'re dropping an excellent Traveller line just because the New Era was 
coming seems a bit daft to me....(***flame off (was that a flame?!)***).
	I\'m sorry, but I _had_ to get that out of my system. Anyway, back to
reality. What little info on the K\'Kree that I have read (in DGP MT Journal 4)
was quite interesting, but they seem to have been largely ignored by GDW (The
K\'Kree? Oh, they\'re just a bunch who live to Trailwards who generally have 
nothing to do with the Imperium - forget about them....:-)). I do hope that 
now DGP have dropped their line, GDW will start doing more books on Aliens 
(I know there\'s an Aliens of the Rim one coming up, but that still leaves the
K\'Kree, Droyne and Zhos largely uncovered.). If anyone\'s got any more ideas
or info on any of these races, then do drop me a line, and sorry about the 
rant.....

	Right that\'s all from me. TTFN until neaxt time and remember-

    Interesting...  I noticed in DGP\'s "Vilani & Vargr" that the 
borders in Gvurrdon had changed from the original Vargr Supplement 
(Thirz had grabbed a few Society Worlds, Rukh had swallowed half of 
the Anti-Rukh) and I\'ve been using Thirz-Society conflict as a 
backdrop for one of my e-mail groups.  So what happened to the Rukh? 
I imagine they swallowed the Anti-Rukh (the Antis just didn\'t have 
what it takes -- no decent starports, low-tech vs. TL15, Type A, large
yards...).  Did the Rukh fall apart?  If so, there are a couple of 
(LARGE) TL-15 Vargr worlds "on the loose".  Did they join someone 
else?  Did they change their name? What? Who? How?
    Can you e-mail the Gvurrdon data and history, or put it up for 
ftp?  I avoid surface mail like the plague.  Also, do you have stats 
for the next sector spinward?  I would like to see what the rest of 
the Thirz Empire looks like, as I haven\'t gotten around to rolling the
rest of it up, yet.

>Zhodani. In my campaign Thirz Empire is Zhodani backed, while what\'s

    Yah, that\'s mostly what I did.  I figured that a strong Vargr 
nation that close to Zho borders was probably on good relations with 
the Zhodani, or the Zhos would have picked a fight with them and 
broken them up years ago.  I have been running the Thirz as having a 
vaguely Irish-Celtic "government" -- a bunch of semi-autonomous 
planetary "kings" and clan-lords owing fealty to the "High King"
(mistranslated as Emperor by the Imperials).  I see the Society 
of Equals as a loose confederation, based on the name and the 
various Vargr scenarios that have been set there. Right now (1112) the
Thirz lords are hungry for the rich worlds of the Society of Equals, 
and are picking a fight based on the multi-national slave trade going 
on between them.  (The Society allows slavery, the Thirz don\'t. 
Extra-national corsairs raid Thirz and independant worlds for slaves 
to sell on Society worlds.)

I\'m trying this first).
I also want to know if there are any suggestions to the name.  It will be
be a alt group (if you feel that it should be included in rec let me know).
The name can be something like "alt.games.2300ad".

 I see someone else has noticed the rather extreme population and naval

belittle the \'what will happen to the RCES\' discussion because they could
roll right over the RCES like the RCES roll over chickens.         
 Expect the Hub Worlds to be decimated by virus/civil war/teddy bears  just  
as soon as the majority of Traveller players start to ask GDW what they are
playing at.
 I am honoured enough to play with some of the people who are listed on the
Hub Worlds development team, so I suppose I could ask them what the heck they
thought they were doing putting 30 Billion people on a Mars-type planet, and
if they actually intended it to be many times more powerful than the RC.

I\'d be more than happy to share details of the Earth Colonies campaign but
since TML seems to be focused on the `official\' background - or least 
backgrounds related to the `official\' Imperium campaign - I have been hesitant
to do so.  The Earth Colonies Campaign, while a Traveller campaign, is
completely original and unrelated to the Imperium Campaign.  (See my posting
of Feb. 24th - TML 547/6877 - for specific details.)  If others would be
interested in reading about the Earth Colonies campaign (or would *not*)
please let me know.  If there\'s a positive response (as opposed to merely a
lack of negative response) I might start with an explanation of the 3-D
aspects of the Earth Colonies campaign.

If you\'re interested in the Earth Colonies campaign but would rather not
see it on TML (or no one expresses an interest to do so) you can always
send me a business-sized (4 in x 9 in) self-addressed, stamped envelope
(SASE) for details (overseas folks contact me by e-mail first) about our

Jumpstart Caches are described in Survival Margin as a public works

OUT ON A LIMB TIME:

I think Longbow is some super secret faster than light stardrive.  The 
reason I believe this is from the Adventure PROJECT FARSTAR (In a very 
old copy of Challenge).  In this adventure the players work with scientists on 
the problem of how to jump farther.  One of the possible scenarios is that the
 players detect a starship moving faster than light!  Longbow is listed 
in the back of SURVIVAL MARGIN as a FTL communicator that didn\'t work.  I 
think there is more going on here than that though.

EVEN MORE WILD SPECULATION:

Wouldn\'t it be weird if the crash was not from the *VIRUS* but rather 
from as yet unknown agent that even now is hurtling its way to the new era.

   Actually, ghettoization is probably the wrong word.  What I\'m 
   thinking of is the planet that becomes a "banana republic" - its 
   only source of foreign (interstellar) exchange becomes raw 
   materials that high-tech cultures need but will not pay high 
   prices for.  Consider the state of things in countries like 
   Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Mexico, Malaysia, and so on.  I\'d say 
   that there are probably better words than ghettoization, but I 
   can\'t think of them.

TML::>Okay, so `ghettoized\' means something akin to `exploited\'?  

   More than just exploited.  Japan was exploited after WWII, but 
   it was able to pull itself together.  But South Asia and the 
   Indo-Pacific island nations, and to a lesser extent, the 
   Carribean and Central and South America are both exploited and 
   ghettoized.  Some countries are making an effort to pull 
   themselves out of it - Argentina is a notable example.  But most 
   of those countries have no present hope of escaping or solving 
   their problems, many of which are connected with high population 
   density, low wages, and single-product economies.

   OK, I finally have it straight, once and for all.  It\'s NOT in 
   AV.  It\'s NOT in TNE itself.  It _IS_ in Survival Margin.

   On P30, Strephon effectively makes his decision to abdicate by 
   choosing not to cooperate with IRIS.  That this is his attitude, 
   rather than it being beneath his dignity, is confirmed by the 
   statement that IRIS will "get me out of this" and by (P31) his 
   apparent happiness at his claim being disallowed.  So we know 
   that Strephon has abdicated.  He effectively turns the job over 
   to Norris on P51, where he sends Avery "with them" [the AV], 
   and P52, where we see the text of the message that was in the 
   holocrystal given to the diplomatic team from the AV.  In that 
   message, Strephon confirms Norris\'s assumption of the title of 
   Archduke, gives him Jumpstart, and warns him about Longbow.  He 
   also makes it clear that Norris is the only one left to carry on 
   the traditions of the Imperium.  Recall also the Domain\'s last 
   words to the interstellar communications network: "We keep the 
   flame".  Though veiled, this can be taken as a reference that 
   they _know_ that they have the only rightful claim to the mantle 
   of the 3I.  That they take on the name "Regency" after that 
   indicates that Norris is taking his position as "emperor" not as 
   his own position, but as a trust, for when a true Emperor shall 
   resume the Iridium Throne.  Recall, however, that after a much 
   shorter period, a previous regent (during the Civil War (in the 
   600s)) took the thrown as Regent, rather than Emperor, until she 
   was asked, by the Moot, to take the title as well as the 
   authority.  It is not unreasonable to assume that the same will 
   happen with Norris or his successor, or possibly Avery or one of 
   his descendants.  The question is _when_ this will happen - in 
   other words, at what point does it become appropriate for the 
   Regency to "admit" that it is in fact the Imperium?  See my 
   comments later in this article...

   Sorry about all the confusion...

   Not necessarily.  News that is not in the Government\'s best

   Washington, DC, hotel, around about 1974?

   No, not really more powerful.  The primary evolution of Virus 
   was toward a non-suicidal, and non-homicidal form - because it 
   is more conducive to spreading Virus, i.e., survival.  This 
   evolution was facilitated by the ability of many substrains and 
   strains to interact with each other.  But this kind of 
   interaction is slowed down when you have a situation in which 
   the spread of Virus is slowed down.  Thus, strains of Virus 
   approaching the protected states through the Vargr Extents will 
   tend to be earlier strains, and therefore more dangerous ones.

   The total quarantine imposed by the Regency and the Zhodani (and 
   the other surviving Spinward States) would tend to cut down on 
   opportunity to observe.  And a Virus that can bridge the 
   gap between Software and Hardware (as Virus can) is _not_ 
   something that you will easily be able to develop 
   countermeasures to.  Nor is it something that you want to bring 
   into a well-equipped research lab in the heart of your territory 
   (such facilities need support that is unlikely to be available 
   at the frontier), when the amount of damage that can occur in a 
   release accident is so high.  The Rape of Trin (I still somehow 
   think it was Gram, but...)is graphic evidence of what can go 
   wrong.  You don\'t mess with that kind of thing.  Consider:  
   Union Carbide has just announced plans to build a chemical plant 
   in your home town.  It will be the same kind of thing that the 
   plant in Bhopal, India, was doing.  Are you really going to feel 
   comfortable about having that plant there?

   I refer you to the outcome of the Civil War of the 600s.  
   History _does_ tend to repeat itself.  Also, Norris never threw 
   his support to any faction - he was loyal to the concept  and 
   ideal of the Imperium itself.  Can _anyone_ descended from 
   _any_ factional leader, no matter how "good" his/her lineage, 
   and how pure his/her motives, establish a _morally_ justifiable 
   claim to the Iridium Throne?  I suspect that when/if this 
   situation arises, and push comes to shove, that the people of 
   the Regency will stand behind the Regent, rather than the 
   Pretender.  At that time, when the _people_ realize that the 
   Regent is in fact the Emperor, the Regent will "reluctantly
   accept the summons to the Iridium Throne."

                   The Necessity of Peace
                       In the New Era
 
One plausible explanation for the peace between the Regency and
its neighbors is the very real danger that the Virus poses to an
unstable region (which is what you\'d have if a war were to break
out).  Warfare could allow the Virus to easily infiltrate and
wreak havoc abroad, doing to the nations of the region what it
did to the Imperium, the Hiver Federation, the Solomani
Confederaton, etc.
 
Therefore, the Regency, the Zhodani Consolate, the Darrian
Confederation, the Sword Worlds, and all the governments further
spinward each have a very high stake in keeping the peace and
tolerating each others\' presence.
 
That doesn\'t preclude covert activities, however.  :)

Let\'s talk about armor. Modern bulletproof vests are weaves of high-tech
materials. They form a mesh upon which a bullet goes splat, spreading out
the kinetic energy over a wider surface area and doing less damage.
However, since it\'s a weave, sharp pointy things can slip between the
cracks and hurt people. In order to stop them you need to have solid
plates, like those in a flak jacket.  Lasers are thin, sharp pointy things,
just like knives and swords - I would rule that whatever special protection
flaks (and any other "hard" armor, like battledress) give for lasers apply
to swords & knives as well.

Emailing eps files is best done by converting them to either uuencode
or binhex format.  Uuencode is probably easiest for people on most

I\'ve lost the name and address of the person who was asking for ads

 As it happens, I\'m the HIWG Sector Analyst for the sector in question
(Usingou to the Vargr, Ziafrplians to the Zhodani).  The position
entails collecting all available information on the sector and
developing where needed.  What I have is as follows:

 -A dot map of the sector with borders from V&V.  Getting this map
  was a real case of eye-strain, as the V&V map does some really
  bizarre things across national borders.
 -Nameless UWPs for the Zhodani part of the sector, and nameless
  _provisional_ UWPs for the Vargr section.  Why provisional?  I\'ve
  not had time to take a really close look at the Gvurrdon half
  of the Thirz.  There might be trends to propagate in government
  types.
 -All subsectors named.
 -All worlds in Subsector P named, with basic notes on the subsector
  level.
 -All Zhodani Way Stations placed.  Random sector production is
  wonderful, but Way Stations need to be placed by hand.  As an aside,
  the placement of Consular Naval Depots makes it obvious that
  the Zhodani may talk to the Thirz, but they don\'t completely trust
  them.

 Aside from the actual world locations and the placement of the
border (provided by DGP in V&V), and the subsector names (provided
by another HIWG member) all the above is my own work.  The naming
of worlds continues in sporadic fashion (and I\'ve got a huge list
of Zhodani world names from other sectors so that duplication is
kept to a minimum), but all other details are done as needed.
 I don\'t publish a fanzine, or I would take submissions.

 This brings up some good questions, however.  What is the nature of
"adventuring" in the Zhodani Consulate?  Does such a thing exist
in the Imperial sense of the term?  What do the answers to these
two questions mean in terms of further development of a Zhodani
sector?  In the final analysis, is Ziafrplians worth developing
to an exhaustive level?

 The final question can be answered more easily for Ziafrplians
than for its spinward neighbor Tienspevnekr, because Ziafrplians
is a _border_ sector.  Here there be Vargr.  A few of the more
adventuresome Imperial merchants might find their way this far
especialy via the Thirz or the buffer area.  While Ziafrplians
is not the hotbed of adventure that Gvurrdon, the Marches, and
Foreven are, it does have potential.

 While the sector listing is still too rough to distribute whole,
anyone interested in particular pieces can contact me by email.
Contributions to the finished sector will be appreciated and
(if ever necessary) credited.

  Ballistic weave is notoriously bad at stopping thin penetrating or
shearing attacks like daggers, arrows and swords. Even very small
bullets like .22LR have a tendency to "slip though the net" sometimes.

  Now this only holds for ballistic weave, ie TL6-8 Terran body armour,
not for platemail, combat armour and battle dress, and possibly not even
for low-tech vac suits.

  I suspect this is a relic from T2k2, since T2k2 only concerns itself
with body armour and not platemail, combat armour and battle dress.
But you would still get some impact damage from the actual blow, it
is hard to stop that.

That Regency-thing that some of you are making is quite interesting, in fact
when I started my current campaign I planned to situate it to the Regency.
But \'cos the only material I have about that region is what is in the TNE
rules book I decided to establish it instead to Aubaine because I knew it
would be supported so I didn\'t have to do *all* the work by myself.

My group just finished their first mission to RC. It was the Once & Future
Emperor adventure from the rules book. I have to admit that we enjoyed playing
it. Of course it was a short one and quite linear, but it was suitable for
introduction adventure. There were also couple of illogical/unfinished spots
which bothered me a bit. One thing which I was strongly disappointed was that
it was situated to many subsectors away from Aubaine and there were no star
maps about area where PCs were due to travel. I had to improvise how much time
it took for them to get there. I have to admit that I got very lucky about
that time. Since then I have downloaded sector datas from sunbane (?).

My group spent almost 2 years in that mission (including 1.5 years in the
scout ship). When they got back and their ship got its annual maintenance
they kept their vacation. While two of them were in Jump Drive named bar
one of them paid attention to one of the spacers who were there. In fact he
was not supposed to be anything special but I suppose my group will encounter
him later. I guess that he will be involved in organ legging and slavery.
In my game Trybec is very criminal place or at least its star port is.
There authorities do next to nothing about smuggling and slavery. Slaves come
from wild of course. 

My player group have four players.

Ayla Walls: Her duty is to keep the party alive and well. She used to be
            a doctor in Brusman, Aubaine. But she didn\'t pay much attention
            to Hippocrate\'s Oath. Therefore she is not allowed to keep a 
            doc shop. Althought not a soldier, she is competent with her
            SMG.

            She met one of her student time friends who were going to Trybec.
            Ayla doesn\'t know that but her friend is also involved in organ
            legging (she is a doctor).

Andrew Strong: Originally from Schall. His grand parents came from Seliga
            during the Rebellion, before Seliga died. He has been a diplomat
            in Aubaine, after that he spent a few years as a journalist.
            Finally he "saw the light" and decided to begin bounty hunting.
            He is quite a funny guy because he loves danger but panics
            easily.

            Next mission of the party takes them to Seliga, where they will
            meet scavengers working for one of the Schall\'s families. It might
            be interesting to see how his loyalties are divided between his
            new employees and his home planet!

Paul Doolittle: Party\'s soldier, after serving 3 terms in the army he decided 
            to go to Hiver Academy. He also flies partys star ship. Althought
            not a very competent pilot, he is the best the party have. He
            have received an "unofficial" nickname as "Doomlittle" after
            almost crashing their ship while taking off from Aubaine when
            going to orbit.

            Nothing special about him at that point.

Jack Road:  Other party found him from Karaguuka. He was deserted there by
            his former companions. I guess he was too unsocial for them and
            they got fed up with his arrogant behavior. Knows something about
            star ships and lots of computers and robots.

            He is from small pocket empire in Diaspora sector near 
            the Karaguuka. I suppose there will be interesting personality
            clashes within party when he comes to play. Oh yeah, I almost
            forgot, he served couple of years one of the Karaguuka\'s most 
            powerfull warlords as a technical advisor (literally).

So, that\'s what kind of party I am running.

I also need a little help about some equipment.


1) When you buy a vac suit, does it include a helmet?
2) In upgrade booklet p. 7 sez: 4 cm CLC Rifle\'s ammo price is 6/68, does
   that mean that you must pay Cr.6 for 68 "bullets" ?
3) In TNE rules book p.337 is a thermal.meteoroid garment. It has a armor 6
   and cloth -1. If this is true, would not it be a very good armor even while
   worn by itself? And what does that cloth -1 mean? Is it same as Agl Mod -1?

I\'m no TML member, but I will try to post here anyway. If time permits
I read the TML bundles. Since quite a while I\'m interested in playing
(game mastering) a SF campaign, presumably in the Traveller background.

Beside humans as player character I would like to roll up character of
some of the typical alien races, too. So my question: Doesn\'t anybody
know statistics of Vargr, Aslan, etc. (Classic Trav, MT or TNE) or can
describe them in relation to humans? (Aslan are stronger for example?)

PS: If you like, please CC: me the mail, too, because I can\'t read the
TML every day.


thanks in advance,
bye.

>What would the UWP\'s look like for the Spinward Marches in the

Based on the TNE stats for Spinward Marches/Regina in TNE, expect
some minor population increases and a general tech level increase
of one from 1112/1120-era (Post FFW/Rebellion) stats.  Regina
subsector\'s average tech level is not terribly high by world, but
the lower tech ones have a better chance to rise further than
the high tech ones.  Kinorb, at tech 2, jumps to tech 4, I recall.
But Uakye, at tech D, stays where it is, even though both Efate
and Regina gain a tech level.

Governmental affiliation on the rimward edge of the sector might
be a bit odd.  Any parts of old imperial District 268 that the
ihatei didn\'t take forcefully may have been incorporated like
Ruie/Regina by now, to shore up the Regency\'s authority in the
area.  I\'m not sure what will be going on with the Sword Worlds,
especially considering the partition after the 5FW.

Expect to see the Xboat system extended along the coreward edge of
the sector, and perhaps other borders as well.  New scout bases
(Regency Quarantine Service bases, actually) will be constructed
at many of the worlds on or near the new xboat route, to watch
the border for Virus and support the advanced pickets.

Actually, that\'s why the HubWorlds needs all those resources, as I see it.
Kaggushus is sitting in a very dangerous spot.  Massilia was the most
technologically advanced sector of the Imperium -- some twenty-odd 
tech 16 worlds were in the sector (one of which *was* Kaggushus).  That
means there could be a lot of dangerous Virus-infected high tech hardware
flying around the area.  On the other side, the Hub is very close to the
edge of the Black Curtain, and nobody in the Hub has any idea what might
be lurking in there, eating exploratory ships.  They might need to find
out one of these days.

Also, note that the coreward neighbor to the HubWorld\'s Ershur subsector
is Core sector\'s Cadion subsector.  There are at least two interesting
things to check out there.  Just over the border is Reference/Cadion
(Core 0140).  The astrographic center of the Imperial navigation system,
and former data repository of the IISS Imperial Grand Survey.  If even
partially intact, it could be a treasure trove of information for 
rebuilding or raiding dead and not-so-dead worlds.  Of course, it\'s 
probably a death trap, considering that life support on the airless rock 
was computer controlled and that there are tens of thousands of different 
data storage computers networked under that rock, as well as Imperial
Naval and Scout bases sited in the system.  The second target in the 
subsector would be Lucan\'s research station where Virus was actually 
developed.  It might be inside the Black Curtain, but there could
still be useful information that wasn\'t destroyed by the staff, the
Virus, or Dulinor\'s raiders.

In fact, it\'s interesting that the Hub survived the initial Virus
attack that close to the release point....

it up, and continue to develop it. In terms of what the OFFICIAL supplements

   The point is, NO ONE HAS TO USE THE OFFICIAL BACKGROUND! For instance, Mr.
Johnson offers information on his Earth Colonies campaign. Great! I\'d like to

the creativity which goes into these efforts., Even for those who wish to take
the Imperium and alter it to suit their tastes, such as disposing of the Virus

   I use and follow the GDW background for the following reasons: I\'ve been a
fan of it since the days of the Journal; I can\'t really see myself coming up
with anything better; and I simply don\'t have TIME.
    The one disadvantage of coming up with your own background or altering the
existing one is that there is less support material that you can just use "off
the shelf". However, if you\'re creative enough to create your own background in
 the first place, writing your own support material shouldn\'t bee too tough.
    GDW owns the "official" Traveller background, but you DON\'T have to use it.

    Speculations:  Because the, say, 75 lbs of force behind the sword 
swing is distributed over an edge maybe a millimeter wide and the 
sharp edge of the sword actually cuts the ballistic cloth fibers?  9mm 
TL6 autopistol -- sounds like a Walther P-38 or other 9mm Parabellum 
equivalent.  Not anywhere near the muzzle energy of a rifle round, or 
even .45 ACP.  Or maybe TNE\'s rules are screwy?  In GURPS, modern and 
ultra-tech ballistic cloth stops melee weapons as well as bullets. 
I understand that, in the Real World (tm), getting shot in the 
ballistic vest gives you a heck of a bruise, if not broken ribs -- you
do take some damage.  That damage is an improvement over having 
bullets puncture your internal organs, however.

Sure, why not?  Yes, *jury-rigging* armor like that might be awkward, 
but someone, somewhere probably sells an integrated C.E. suit with 
ceramic inserts over the vitals -- it\'s a whole lot lighter and 
cheaper than combat armor, and such armor was on the standard 
equipment list in the 2300AD game.

Good point.  My idea was that most worlds NEVER HAD an Imperial 
Culture ingrained; that *most* worlds had their own culture with a 
"interface" layer of Imperial Culture among the nobility and the 
starport personnel.  It would be more reasonable to assume that the 
Imperial Culture never *replaced* the original culture on these worlds
- -- even as the peasant cultures of France and England are more Gallic 
Celt and Angle/Saxon/Celtic than Roman even in the 20th century.  But 
Imperial influence on Art, Religion, Philosopy, Architecture, 
Literature, Language, and Technology might be as pervasive as the
influence of Roman and Greek cultures in the former Roman Empire. 
However, I see the true Imperial Culture being as dead as the Roman 
Culture is now -- a lot of wannabes shortly afterward, and a 
pervasive, lingering influence on all the "liberal" Arts, but never 
quite the same again.

>And look how long others tried to keep the "idea" of the Ceasars

<grin> Even later than that -- Mussolini portrayed himself and the 
Fascists as restoring the glory of the Roman Empire.  Ever notice that
the Italians in WWII used the Roman Legionary standard?  And Hitler 
didn\'t use the Roman eagle clutching a swastika in its claws by 
coincidence.

    I put \'em in orbital habitats, myself.  Humans just don\'t live on 
worlds like that.  Of course, aliens who are native to the environment
are another case entirely... Some of those high-pop hellholes may be 
inhabited by the local equivalent of Chlorans, or Mesklinites.

I\'ll see what I can do. E-mail is out of the question as I use a

Internet properly is impossible. I can however try to put them up at a
FTP site. I haven\'t done that before, as I\'m quite new to the net. So
any instructions would be appreciated.

I doesn\'t have the stats of the sector spinward of Gvurrdon. I have been
trying to get those for more than 2 years, but the sector has been
changing hand in HIWG a few times, and I do not know who\'s holding that
position at the moment.

As I read it we got quite similar perception about Thirz Empire and
Society of Equals (SoE). But in my campaign Thirz has given back some of
the worlds, as they became unruly under their domination. However they
kept a few. At the moment SoE eyes the build up of forces along the
border to Thirz suspiciously. They do both share border with the wilds
close by. And the zoo and Regency are worried that a shooting war might
errupt. This might lead to that their borders will be poorly defended
against the Virus as the forces are drawn to the front.

So you have trouble accepting that technophobia (and techno worshipping)
in TNE. I have a little trouble with this technophobia thing too.
In my game technophobic planets are those planets which had high TL before
the collapse and a (very) low TL now in the new era. I can\'t imagine a TL 7
planet with technophobia. Those planets doesn\'t worship technology either.

But I think that technophobic planets are possible, even probable.
For example let\'s assume you had a dog when you was a child, you really loved
it and felt very sad when it died. But you decided not to buy a new dog. After
several years from your dog\'s death you walk in the street minding your own
business when a BIG DOG (maybe even rabies infected) attacks you! It really
beats you up tearing half of your face to unrecognisable mass, eats your
right arm and piss on your back. Then you wake up in a hospital and recover
slowly and even if you recover fully you will fear dogs or at least feel very
nervous when you see one again. I\'m *not* hoping that this ever happens to
any of you guys and I don\'t even hate dogs that\'s just an example, right?

With this example I wanted to tell you how irrational phobias are. And what
comes to that point that most grand fathers remember that glorious time when
technology was people\'s friend, they also remember their
friends who were killed by Virus infected machines. How about that technology 
worshipping? If there are a living Virus infected computer controlled military
base or high port which can affect the people\'s life for example making it very
short, can be a very possible subject of worshipping. Heck, people worship
even abstract things which somebody claims to be gods.  I suppose that
nobody worships a microwave owen, on the other hand why not?

I\'d like to hear about that Earth Colony campaign and more about that
bodysnatcher adventure.

Well, I suppose that\'s it...

And remember...

  According to both 3G and the Kemira-Vihtavouri reloading guide
9mm Parabellum vary between 337 Joule and 500 Joule and .45 ACP between
470 Joule and 506 Joule, so it is definately wrong to say that a 9mm has
significantly lower energy than a .45

  Short nines (makarov, .380 ACP and so on) however is a different story.

I don\'t think so.  More like worried their former `bosses\' want to
reclaim their Deneb operations!

Where do the megacorps fit in in terms of the Regency political blocs we\'ve
identified?  Certainly, many megacorps will be prominent in the Isolationist
bloc because they\'ll want to maintain their new-found autonomy.  Megacorps
might also then be expected to support the Autonomists in breaking from
the Imperial past.  In this sense, both the Quarantine and promotion of a
move from `regency\' to `independence\' or autonomy can be seen as being in
the interests of the major economic concerns in the Regency.  The megacorps
might also support the Aristocrats (since many megacorp leaders are nobles)
and the Santanocheevists because an expansion of psi-talents might not be
good for business (nor would greater accommodation with the Zhodani - at
least not for those in the `military-industrial complex\').

Certainly the Zhodani Core Expeditions suggest an `exploratory\' interest
in the Consulate.  Has anyone ever run across a Zhodani equivalent to the
IISS?  I would think the Zhodani exploratory service would be similar to
Starfleet in the "Next Generation" era with `counselors\' on every ship
to help the crews deal with the stresses of the unknown.

I\'ve always been a Sword Worlder.  (I `served\' in the Second Grav Tank Corps
during the 5FW as a result of the *JTAS* `draft\' *way* back when.)
We\'ve already noted that the Sword Worlds were the home of the original
`Space Vikings\' from H. Beam Piper\'s Future History.  Obviously, there were
and are Piper fans at GDW but the Sword Worlds never seem to achieve the
`glory\' of Piper\'s novel.

It would seem that the most sensible course for the Domain of Deneb, and later
the Regency, would be to turn the Sword Worlds into an `buffer\' state against
the *ihatei*.  The partition of the Sword Worlds following the 5FW, the
natural infighting of the Sword Worlders themselves, and the ability of
the Regency to focus on the SW in light of the Zhodani `rapproachment\'
would all seem to facilitate such meddling.

If the Quarantine Service is the successor to the IISS in the Regency how
does the role of this service interact with the `Aslan-dominated Patrol\'
created by Norris during the Rebellion?  [FACT ALERT - I don\'t have TNE
rules!]  :-)

I agree but how should we (I?) deal with those responses to criticism of the
official campaign (in effect `altering it to suit my tastes\') that say
`such and such doesn\'t matter\' because `it says so in the rule book\'?  This
is absolutely true but I don\'t see how such a response furthers or contributes
to the discussion at all.  IMHO, there\'s not much point to a discussion about
the `gospel\' of the official rules.  That seems to me to be something like 
the joke about the guys in prison who just yell out numbers and everyone
laughs except when the new guy tries it because he `just can\'t tell a joke\'.
I can see it now:  TNE page 32!  Yeah, and *PoT* pages 14-17!  No, no.  *FF&S*
page 64 . . . .

Another disadvantage is that it\'s tough to discuss your own campaign on a

Well, yes, but won\'t most of those worlds venturing into space during
TNE be doing so through the *technological* heritage of Imperial Culture?
And won\'t this make a Revenant [FACT ALERT - I don\'t have TNE!] just as
comfortable in most Pocket Empires, including the RC, as an ancient Greco-
Roman would be among the Neoclassical `gentlemen citizens\' of Jeffersonian
America?  More so even since the temporal displacement is only 70 years
rather than 700?

I face the music - the world generation rules, to be polite, leave much
to be desired.  Being the heretic that I am, I lower the population
level.  I mean, come on, you might find *some* rational for millions of
sophonts in that sort of system (wherever they live) but you\'re stretching
any reasonable limits of the imagination to do it several places in the
same sector.

We learned this in *AV* too.  We\'re told that Strephon refused to
cooperate with IRIS because he was distraught by the violence and 
suffering that resulted from his reappearance in Gushemege.

So Avery appears in *SV* too?  Do we learn anything more about him

Here\'s an interesting question: does Strephon have this authority?
Also, we (the `real\' us) are told that Strephon is genuine but the information
in *AV*, including the ref\'s info, suggests the PCs, and therefore
Norris and the rest of the Domain, are less certain.  Does *SV* shed any
light to confirm to Norris that Strephon is genuine?  What good is this
`claim to the mantle of the Imperium\' if Strephon\'s identity remains
suspect?

This suggests that Strephon *didn\'t* have the authority to `pass the crown\'
on to Norris.  In order to become Emperor, he or his descendant would have
to be `confirmed\' by the Moot - or ignore them like Lucan did.  Of course
if the only Imperial aristocracy to survive is in the Regency then this
issue of Moot approval may become moot.  ;-)

I agree, but what does this say about the eventual fate of the new

Hmmm, this might be a decidely `American\' view about press freedoms.  Any of
our British friends care to interject a few words about the "Official
Secrets Act"?  Watergate is a poor example because powerful political
interests (Democrats) existed who benefited greatly from the disclosure.
I can\'t imagine the Isolationists being that powerful in a multi-bloc
Regency, unless *Norris* wanted them to be.

And keep this in mind.  If *news* of a Virus assault on Trin (or Gram?)
got off-world (or out-system, at least) then the *Virus* might have as well!
That\'s a good enough reason to keep the news under wraps in and of itself.
So I maintain, if the news broke, it served Norris\'s interests.

If you meant to write ". . . this kind of interaction *increases* (rather
than *is slowed down*) when you have a situation in which the spread of
Virus is slowed down" then I get your point.  Sorry I\'m so dense.  :-)

Maybe, but Arbellatra was the `one, true choice\' that was so missing in
the Rebellion.  Norris isn\'t if any other factional power manages to
survive the Collapse.  *We* know none have (with the possible exception
of whatever\'s behind the Black Curtain) but *Norris* doesn\'t - at least
not yet.

Certainly.  Lucan would have enjoyed universal support if he hadn\'t been
implicated in the death of Varian.  (That\'s why Dulinor tried to have him
killed).  The Imperium doesn\'t have the `Klingon\' tradition of offspring
bearing the burdens of the crimes of the parents so any `kinder, gentler\'
descendant of Lucan might enjoy widespread support.  An usurper in Illelish
might gain support if she managed to topple Dulinor - even in Illelish -
once Dulinor went completely off the deep end into religious fanaticism.
(Convenient how GDW played that, isn\'t it?)  Margaret might have done it
in the Rebellion if she hadn\'t turned out to be a bigot.  (More convenience.)
A `kinder, gentler\' descendant of hers would have advantages similar to
Lucan\'s heirs.  Likewise `regencies\' in Antares or Daibei might offer
claims nearly as valid as Norris\'s and would enjoy similar levels of
support in their cores had they managed to survive the onslaught of Virus.

Despite my points above, I\'m convinced you\'ve divined where GDW is headed.

"ghettoization."  In the poli sci literature the word is "dependency."
If you\'re really interested in this subject there\'s a good book
called _Dependent Development_ by Peter Evans about Brazil.
	You could easily adapt the experiences of Brazil and countries
like it to an interstellar civilization.  To put it in Traveller terms:
	Megacorps or companys from hi-tech worlds establish subsidiaries
on low-tech worlds to take advantage of their raw materials and low
labor costs.  They may then establish local suppliers of inputs for
their products, eithe because the local government forces them to or
because its cheaper than importing.  Often they transfer some technology
to their local partners so that they can better produce the inputs
that the megacorps need.
	This often creates a two tier society with a ring of hi-tech
export industries clustered around the starport while the rest of
the planet languishes at its basic tech level.  The megacorps workers
and the employees of its suppliers will have much higher incomes than

the rest of the planet and will begin demanding luxury consumer goods
from off-world.
	A cozy relationship can grow up between he megacorps, the local
suppliers, and the government.  The megacorps get cheap production, the
local suppliers get a lot of business, and the government gets good tax
revenue.  Unfortunately, a lot of the money generated by these activites
may go into maintaing the life-style of those in this triple alliance.
This could be the basis for the "imperial society" that has been
discussed elsewhere.
	Adventure opportunities abound in this situation and can easily
be taken from history.  You could have rebels seizing control of the
gov\'t and "nationalizing" the megacorps assets, which might cause
intervention from Imperial Marines to "protect the lives and property
of Imperial citizens."  It doesn\'t have to be the empire either.  You
could use this in the Regency or in the RC.  
	What happens if a newly "assimilated" world decides to try and
kick the RC out?  What if the megacorps are trying to recover national-
ized assets?  How about being in the pay of rebels who want to 
interfere with the operations of the megacorps?  Maybe the players\' 
ship is carrying the megacorps products and is hijacked so as to
"liberate" the cargo for the rebels.
	You can have a lot of fun with this idea and history is replete
with examples that would make excellent adventure nuggets.

  Well, you might try to get a hold of the Classic Traveller Alien

  info therein will certainly be dated, it won\'t be outdated...

  GDW did a not-quite-complete set of Alien Modules for CT.  I have

  Solomani, Zhodani, Droyne, and Darrian.  Certainly, I\'d like to 
  see GDW issue supplements/conversion guides/reworks for all of 
  these, but what\'s in them should still, when mixed with a little 
  imagination, be useful, whether you play in the Classic Era, 
  MegaEra, or New Era.

  With sufficient (not monetary - what\'ve you got to trade?)

 This was never a question.  The best "gung-ho" adventures available
to the Zhodani are the Core Expeditions and all the little stuff
on and off the Core Road between Expeditions.  As such, the sectors
of the Core Road (term coined by me, BTW; no need to look it up)
are marvelously safe from a private campaign point of view.  There
are more sectors on the Core Road than in all the rest of Explored
Space, and _no_one_ will ever publish anything to counter your work
(Security Leak #5 not withstanding).  Sure all your PCs are Zhodani,
but once you peel off the respective Noble layers the Zhodani and
the Imperium are _very_ similar.

 But I was asking about adventure _within_ the Consulate.  Because
of one inherent difference (not psi, BTW), we poor Solomani cannot
conceive of and detail the vast range of Zhodani world-bound cultures.
We have enough trouble with _Imperial_ world-bound cultures.  The
result is that the Consulate looks fairly monochrome to us, and no
fun to adventure in, native PCs or not.  I suspect that in "Real
Life" this just isn\'t so.  As many Solomani philosophers will tell
you, "Life is an Adventure," and this applies to the Zhodani as well
as to all other Human races in Explored Space.  The high degree and
unusual success of the Zhodani social engineering scheme does little
to affect this maxim of humanity.
 What is the difference that makes visualization so difficult?  The
basic underlying (and utter) honesty of the Zhodani.  This immediately
cuts out a great many adventure seeds that work just fine in Imperial
space.  Think about it.  How many Amber Zones over the years have had
lying, cheating, or stealing somewhere in their makeup or motivation?
Or private military operations?  Murder?  Dropping any of these into
Zhodani space will attract every Tavrchedl\' in the subsector, not to
mention the Consular Navy and maybe SORAG, all of whom are much
nosier than their Imperial counterparts when it comes to member
worlds.
 This problem makes the sectors that _border_ the Consulate much
easier to detail than wholly interior sectors.  In these places there
are peoples with honesty levels closer to Imperial/Solomani norms
who are much easier to develop, leaving the Zhodani (who probably
dominate the sector from the real estate point of view) as the
"big, stuffy, puritanical neighbors."

Hear, hear!  And in the case of Virus, technophobia is a damn rational
response -- assuming that anyone is left rational afterwards.  Living
through a Virus attack on an unprepared, unsuspecting world would be
like a movie by Steven King (or another wild horror author) on a real
bad acid trip.  The problems start small, but get worse and worse as
Virus takes hold.  Anything that\'s automated can and will be used
in the most destructive way the controlling Virus can think of (at
least in the case of the secondary Viral strains).  

Not only would survivors of such an attack be pretty screwed up for a
long time afterward, they might never find out why all their machinery
turned against them.  This could lead to all sorts of crazy speculation,
and the idea that a controlling spirit residing in a computer decided
to visit itself on humaniti to make it suffer for the sins of the
Rebellion, in the absence of any other plausible explanation, might
carry the day.  (Besides, the concept of Virus isn\'t exactly all that
rational either...considering all the debate on the TML on how to
explain how it can possibly work.)

>bodysnatcher adventure.

I agree.  No reason to limit discussion to the GDW universe here,
after all.  It would definitely be interesting to hear about some
of the variants people have come up with.

As regards David Johnson asking:

>> Secrets Act"?  

Hmmm, yes. I don\'t actually know if this is a strictly American thing. There
is certainly a public opinion over here that \'that sort of thing just wouldn\'t
happen....\' but several cases, such as the admission of MI5 (CIA/FBI) trying
to destabilise the Labour govmts of the 70\'s (Read Spycatcher by Peter Wright,
the book Maggie had banned in the UK), and that huge coincidence when a lawyer\'s
office safe was broken into, that just happened to contain the only documents
relating to adultery by the leader of one of our opposition parties (Paddy
Pantsdown). 

As for the Official secrets act, the government do have the power to nail you
to the wall - *if* you\'ve signed it! They can also put D notices on newspapers,
but to do that, they have to know if the paper are going to print it, before
they can stop them! (Any lawyers who can give more details, please do, I\'m
only really good on the Data Protection Act 1984, and speeding in built-up 
areas in the hours of darkness.)

Freedom of speech is quite good here (in theory) you cannot be stopped unless
you have entered into a contract with the govt. not to disclose etc. (the OSA).
Certainly I would agree with Jeff, when he says

Of course it will - well in any enlightened democracy......does this include
the Regency under Norris? Opinions on an e-postcard please..

(Sorry about this non-Traveller stuff....I\'ll get to the point...)

The point is that the higher the technological level gets, the less powerful
in numbers etc you have to be compared to your political enemies in order to 
get the dirt on them, IHMO. The Isolationists may have gotten lucky, but
equally Norris could have engineered the leak. However, I don\'t think the I\'s
would have to be particulally resourceful to find the dirt on something as
big as the Rape of Trin - I mean, an awful lot of people must have known
something was up, one way or another - couriers, traders, etc.

Hi my name is Mark Fletcher, and this is the first time I\'ve posted to 
TML. Thanks to all the people who have informed me about TML these last 
few days.

Ive been reading some of the opinions out that some folf have given on 
the political status of the Regency, the Reformation Coalition 
(henceforth RC, its sore on the fingers!) and the Pocket Empires. Id like 
to take the time to offer my opinions on this matter; I probably stand to 
be corrected.

THE REGENCY:

The Regency perhaps is not as diversified as many people would believe. 
The Regency government would perhaps be split in two, much like the 
Houses of Parliament in Britain. One house, which would be made up from 
elected representatives, would attend to the running of day to day 
activities, whereas the second house, the House of nobles or "Moot moot" 
would oversee the long term policies of the domain. Any major changes in 
the running of matters would have to be passed before the Moot moot.

Sure there will be a degree of political views, but not as much as say, 
the Solomani Confederation. I think Norris would have forseen the 
problems in changing the government and would try to smooth things out.

To summarise, the Regency is differs little from how the Domain was run, 
except now there is a group of elected representatives assigned to make 
sure that the Nobles dont get away with murder...

REFORMATION COALITION

The last thing the RC want is to break up into small warring polities, 
and two things prevent this:

1. The Hivers: The Hivers being the long term schemers that they are 
   have realised that if they do not have a bigger say in how things are 
   run in human space, they could have some pretty xenophobic neighbours 
   pretty soon! I think that after the Hivers have rebuilt their society, 
   they probably turn their hands to altering the cultures of the former 
   Imperium with the goal of producing a more altruistic, less violent 
   culture 
2. The governments of the RC have realised the potential of technology. 
   While the RC economy is largely based on imports, there will be a 
   thriving trade in technology between these worlds, such as The Auction 
   on Aubaine. These worlds want the latest technology, the best minds, in 
   order to keep up with their neighbours.

Finally has anyone came up with a way for designing Robots for Traveller:TNE?
If so let me know. Also going back to what was said on the Regency, 
perhaps another job for the defunct IISS would be to conduct Diplomatic 
missions between the worlds of the Regency, and to help worlds with low 
TL\'s and low populations, so that they can contribute more to the Regency 
economy.

This might provide some interesting adventures.

  A few quick notes about combat.  Ballastic Weave is a fabric.  It\'s very
good at stopping fast blunt things like bullets.  What is does is spread
the damage around, thus keeping the bullet from penatrating.  It\'s not
perfect though.  For every die of damage it stops, the wearer still gets
one point of `blunt trauma\' damage.  For example, you get hit with a round
from an 11.45mm pistol (dam:2 Pen:1-Nil) while wearing a BW suit.  The 
armor stops one die of damage but not the other.  The round it stops still
does 1 point of blunt trauma damage.  You take 1d6+1 points of damage.
(personally I like 1d10+1 better, but that\'s another topic...).
  The BW fabric is not good at stoping sharp (or very thin) things though.  
Swords, knives, arrows, and laser beams are good examples of what it does
not stop very well.
  According to the TUB (Traveller Upgrade Booklet) that came with FF&S 
(and available from GDW), any kind of `hard\' armor (flack jacket, combat
armor, etc) would provide good protection from MP lasers.  FYI, A flack
jacket is a thick BW vest with inserts (or `plates\') of metal or hard
ceramics/plastics.
  Moral of the story.  You\'re BW suit is pretty handy between Tech levels
of five and nine.  You are most likely to get shot by a slug thrower.
Below that and there still is a good chance you\'ll get stabbed.  Above
that and you start seeing lasers.  

  Where to find Spinward Marches world stats.  The Regina subsector is in the 
TNE book.  There is a CT supplement called `The Spinward Marches\' which has 
data on a dozen or so subsectors.

  Challenge #72...Anybody seen it?  GDW told me (over the phone) today
that it was shipped to subscribers last week.  I\'d add some time to shipping
in the US due tax filing frenzy.

  It probably did, but when you have several hundred years in which
  to work, it\'s likely that a number of planets will have "grown"
  out of the condition.  But that was with an empire that expanded
  _without_ stripping worlds of technology.  If a world is taken by
  the RC and sucks up the remnant tech to support the needs of
  "integrated" worlds, it\'s going to be that much harder for the
  planet so stripped to recover.  Worse, it is entirely likely that
  any assistance that the RC gives such a planet later on will be
  deliberately focussive in its effects, so that the planet can
  realize its "maximum productivity."  It\'s a completely different
  attitude than the official materials imply that any of the three
  prior empires had.

  But Strephon\'s identity is _not_ seriously suspect, as far as the
  dip team from AV is concerned.  There\'s that look that only a
  certain kind of ruler can have, and the Strephon that they meet
  has that look.  Certainly, outside of Gushemege, the other
  factions don\'t believe it.  But his own faction does believe it,
  and Norris believes it based on the report from the AV.  Norris
  even writes a letter acknowledging Strephon\'s communication.

  But even if you don\'t accept that line of reasoning, if it
  pleases "Strephon" to make like he is granting permission for
  Norris to do what he has done anyway, and will not undo, what\'s
  the harm?  And my statement about the Regency "knowing" that they
  still have the only rightful claim can be justified on a "moral"
  basis:  They alone have remained loyal to the concept of a United
  Imperium, with all that that implies.

  This gets a little foggy.  As Strephon is still alive, no 
  succession need take place at this point, and the other factions 
  are now fighting over which one will win at coup d\'etat.  Thus, 
  Strephon does have the right to abdicate and name who he prefers 
  as his successor.  Since this would be an "ordinary" succession, 
  the Moot will need to meet and confirm the choice, but even 
  before that meeting occurs, the heir to the throne wields the 
  power.  Technically, one could say that he is his own regent.  In 
  the case of Norris, he knows the law, and prefers to abide by its 
  spirit.  Norris is de facto the Emperor of the Third Imperium, 
  but he cannot take that title until a Moot convenes and confirms 
  it.  To comply with the spirit of the law, Norris should not 
  explicitly convene the Moot for the purpose of his confirmation; 
  rather, he should wait for the high nobles of the Imperium (who 
  make up the Moot) to come to the conclusion that a meeting of 
  the Moot is necessary, and then to meet to elect an Emperor.  If 
  this doesn\'t happen in Norris\'s lifetime, so be it; Norris will 
  remain Regent, and pass the Regency on to whom he thinks best 
  (Avery?  His true-daughter Seldrian?  His seneschal?).  What is 
  important to Norris is not the title, or the personal power, but 
  the way that the power is used, and the results that it 
  engenders.  I have no doubt that, if Norris felt that his mere 
  presence as Imperial ruler was doing more harm than good, he 
  would step down without hesitation.

TS::>I agree, but what does this say about the eventual fate of the new
  ::>Democrats in the Regency?

  What was the eventual fate of the new Democrats in the British 
  Empire?  Perhaps the Iridium Throne will become the Presidential 
  Chair.  Perhaps even the democrats will realize that when you are 
  governing thousands of worlds, it\'s simply not practical to have 
  democracy at the highest levels.  You need to make decisions, and 
  to have someone with the authority to do so.  You can\'t wait for 
  1,000 or 5,000 or 10,000 worlds to vote on the matter and get 
  back to you; you\'d face perpetual governmental paralysis.  When 
  you\'re talking about waiting a month or two for feedback on 
  important, but not time-critical, decisions, Democracy is OK.  
  But when it gets to the point where you must wait the better part 
  of a year, more and more decisions need to be made too rapidly to 
  allow for feedback - even with a Jump-6 network.  At that point, 
  a non-democratic structure is the only one that works.  A similar 
  argument can be made for the inherited position - how long can 
  you afford to wait for the people to make a conclusive decision?  
  When your empire gets too large to allow for this, you need a 
  simple, clear, automatic method of replacement.  Thus, 
  inheritance.  Thus, monarchy.

  Can you really seriously believe that you could suppress the news 
  of the destruction of even a small city on all of over 1,000 
  worlds?  If it doesn\'t spread through the official press, it will 
  spread through the grapevine.  Which is worse.  You\'ll get such 
  outrageous stories that you\'ll _have_ to come forward with an 
  official statement, if only to quash the more harmful rumors.

  As to the UKOSA, I point out that SpyCatcher was published in 
  most of the rest of the world, where the UKOSA couldn\'t reach.  
  Despite it\'s autocratic governmental form, the Imperium is more 
  of a Federal structure than anything else.  Individual planets 
  have a great deal of autonomy, and there is freedom of travel for 
  those who have the money.  To actually implement an OSA in the 
  Regency, one would have to _tightly_ control not only the X-boat 
  network, but all of the commercial passenger ships and tramp 
  freighters as well.  Because people _do_ talk.  We would be 
  talking about internal controls on traffic as tight as the 
  interface controls, and that still won\'t prevent people from 
  talking.  Similarly with UKOSA: It doesn\'t really stop me from 
  meeting an American friend and talking to him, then he goes back 
  home and writes a book, carefully fogging information that could 
  identify me.  The info is out, despite OSA.  Ooops!

  Not necessarily.  Remember, Regency ship-to-ship contact 
  procedures are designed specifically to restrict the ability of 
  Virus to spread.  And since Virus doesn\'t spread through human 
  beings, there\'s nothing stopping the news from spreading by way 
  of people doing spacewalks from one ship to another, after 
  establishing communications by opening up airlocks and waving 
  flags at each other.  Plus, there\'s lots of low-tech stuff that\'s 
  still useful for communication, and can\'t be infected: How do you 
  infect a ball-point pen with Virus? or a piece of paper?

  Information was tightly controlled in the Soviet Union.  That 
  didn\'t (most emphatically it didn\'t) stop underground networks 
  from forming and passing the news on through channels that the 
  government _couldn\'t_ control.

  No, I meant what I wrote.  When you restrict the ability of Virus 
  to spread, the various strains do not have as much opportunity to 
  interact and modify each other.  Thus, less change in Virus.  
  Thus, the survival of more dangerous homicidal strains, as there 
  is less competition from "smarter" versions.

  Wait a minute: Dulinor immediately discounted both Varian and 
  Lucan when he killed "Strephon".  Recall that he claimed the IT 
  by right of assassination.  That already means that there\'s no 
  clear choice; you have two factions: Ilelish and Core.  If Varian 
  had not been killed, the choice still isn\'t clear:  Varian is the 
  heir apparent, but there is precedent for ascension by Right of 
  Assassination.  In such a case, what\'s the right answer?  The 
  last time RoA was invoked, the deceased Emperor had no issue.

  But this is mostly beside the point.  Except for Deneb, _every_ 
  faction was directly involved in the war for the IT.  Except for 
  Deneb, _none_ of the factions was willing to see anyone but their 
  choice on the IT.  I view that as the reason why (a) Norris 
  didn\'t try for the throne himself, and (b) why he withheld his 
  support from _all_ of the other factions.  In light of this 
  selfishness, and the following isolation, can you be _sure_ that 
  any descendent of any of the factional leaders is truly operating 
  from good motives, and not from a tradition of family hatred that 
  says that the other factions took away what was rightfully 
  theirs?

  Also, both the Ziru Sirkaa and the Federation of Antares 
  publically seceded from the Imperium.  Under such circumstances, 
  can any descendent of their leaders assert a legitimate claim to 
  the IT?

I heartily agree (Loren are you tuned in?)- an entire sourcebook or at
least half of one could be of use, possibly with the other portion
devoted to ships w. deckplans similar to the Traders & Gunboats CT
supplement.

My requests:  services available, locations, contact methods and

for
jump points   high ports  low ports   air ports   asteroid clusters and
claims

There never seemed to be much if any discussion in Traveller WRT space
stations.  Locate one at a jump point and considerable effort is saved,
especially for hub systems typically only used to facilitate travel
(such as Spires, Kruyter, and Phoebus in the RC.  This will of course
detract from such a systems economy - no stopovers by passing ships,
crews, and passengers.

Also what about the construction of a station in the middel of an empty
sector to provide a refueling point for long distances.  If many systems
are at a Jump-4 distance such a station placed halfway would allow Jump-
2 ships to make the journey.  The station would need to be regularly
supply by tanker ships and their fuel prices would be greatly inflated.

Sounds like a Viking SAG mission.  As a variant players could play Vargr
and run a SAG mission.  But yes - I agree w. Cynthia in that it would be
more than a minor nuissance to the Regency.  I also feel that at some
point factors of the Regency must move outward to expand the economy.

This exemplifies one of Traveller\'s basic assumptions: that an interstellar
society would only be interested in the worlds oribiting stars and not in
the space that lies between them.  I think it indicates how a choice of
notation (the hex based star maps) can affect the development of a design.
By having a world-based generation system rather than a star based 
generation system the designer of Traveller made a blunder of cosmic
proportions (pun intended).  In the SF genre this was a common assumption
as well (up until the late 1960s).  It was believed that all colonisation
would be of worlds not of space itself.  O\'Neill\'s work on orbital colonies
led to a new viewpoint.  An interstellar civilisation might actually prefer
to live in space stations rather than on the surface of a world.  For a
start, there\'s a lot more energy (in the form of solar radiation) available
to it.  And many industrial processes would benefit from zero-g conditions.
Plus, there\'s plenty of room to expand.

Of course, one of the reasons for prefering space colony life (the cost
of transporting people and goods out of a gravity well) disappears when
you have cheap anti-grav.  But even so, you\'d expect a lot more space-based
colonies than Traveller depicts.

Not that this is a problem for the New Era:  the Virus got them.

The people of the Regency might not be too keen on this.  After all, look
what happened the last time someone had to decide who got to inherit the
Throne.  Perhaps voting is the easier option after all.  It may be slow,
but what the hell are you in a hurry for?  With a large Empire the
ability of the central government to make decisions that actually matter
(rather than just rubber stamping those made by government agencies) is
extremely limited.  What did Strephon actually do as Emperor?  Until
the Rebellion he hardly figured at all in the lives of most citizens of
the Imperium.  He was just a figurehead, a symbol.  The day to day
running of the Imperium (and any large government) is in the hands of
its\' civil servants.  And no-one elects them.  Nor do they inherit their
positions (although there\'s some doubt about that).

The discussion about the legitimacy of the Regent\'s claim to the throne
is beginning to resemble Imperial Law 101.  Putting on my Machiavellian
hat, I\'d propose that all this stuff about legitimacy doesn\'t matter one
whit if you\'ve got the power to enforce your will on the population.
Legitimacy is just sugar to make the pill go down a bit easier.  As an
example, the legitimacy of the Third Imperium to call itself the Third
Imperium has always struck me as a brilliant piece of manipulation on
the part of Cleon Zhunastu.  His claim that the Sylean Federation was
somehow the heir to the Second (and by implication First) Imperium
just because one of the last claimants to the Throne happened to live
on Sylea a thousand years ago is like Balastroni in Italy today claiming
to be the Roman Emperor and the legitimate ruler of all of Rome\'s former
territory in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.  He can claim all
he likes, but that doesn\'t mean that anyone will bow down before him.
Calling the Third Imperium the Third Imperium was simply an attempt to
convince the rest of the interstellar population emerging from the Long
Night that the Sylean Federation somehow had a right to rule them.
Undoubtedly this claim would have been meaningless except for Sylea\'s
economic and military strength (in other word\'s the rest of the
interstellar community didn\'t have much option).

Another example: the Right of Succession by Assassination seems to me to
have been invented by the Imperial Moot as an expedient measure when
faced with a powerful pretender to the Throne who they couldn\'t stop.
If some bozo turned up at the Capital with a huge fleet
of warships, killed the Emperor and then declared himself/herself the
new Emperor what was the Moot going to do?  Yup, legitimate the new
Emperor by declaring a "Right of Succession by Assassination" clause in
Imperial Law.  This was a convenient way for the members of the Moot
to avoid being killed themselves.

Quite why Norris has continued to call himself Regent for the 70 years
following the events of Arrival Vengeance I don\'t understand.  Is he
waiting for a legitimate heir to appear?  From where, exactly?  Since
the AV crew met the real Strephon and Norris believed him to be the
real Strephon and the real Strephon bequeathed the Throne to Norris
(for what it was worth, Strephon may have been ruler on paper but
by that point he certainly wasn\'t ruler in fact) then Norris (on paper)
is the Emperor and so is whovever he decides to pass the title on to.
Whether anyone else outside the Regency will accept this is moot.  But
then, they didn\'t accept it at the time of the Rebellion (hence the
Rebellion).  Personally, I think that all this debate about legitimacy
is a waste of time and bandwidth:  we\'re rehashing  a problem that couldn\'t
be resolved 70 years ago.  I don\'t think that it can be solved now either.

My memory of CT starship building was that if you got a computer
model (n)vis (replace n with computer number), and the end with the
correct abbrev. (One was to do with protection for nucluar attack),
Then you could reduce the number of crew required by one (to a
mimimun of 1), due to the cleverness of the computer.

In these days of the "virus" and the mistrust of computers, I would
think that even the Scout ships these days would have two crew, one
to fly the ship on the other other to make sure that the computer is
really telling the truth ;-)

Some folks have asked what the K\'kree might be up to in The New
Era.  Here\'s my idea.  I don\'t own Path of Tears, so I don\'t know
the RC time line very well, but this\'ll get the idea across in a
nutshell.

The Hive Confederation fell to the Virus in the 1130s.  The K\'Kree
2000 worlds fell soon afterward, but their destruction was more
swift.  The Hivers were more capable of resistence against the
Virus than the less electronically adept K\'Kree.

K\'Kree electronics and robotics was far behind the Hivers and The
Imperium.  At their height, the best K\'Kree robots were TL13.
Oddly, their starships were totally dependent on robotics.  All
K\'Kree ships had robotic engineering crews just ripe for the Virus.
As such, the TL 16 Virus swept through the TL 13 K\'Kree fleets like
wildfire.

Further, as the 2000 Worlds of the K\'Kree empire were farther from
the site of release of the Virus, a greater proportion of the more
advanced breeds of the Virus struck the K\'Kree.  Also, as the
K\'Kree ships did have robotic engineers, the K\'Kree vampire ships
are now in far better shape than the vampires than Imperial ships
where robots were more rare and so have less access to
maintainence.  (Just where have all the Imperial Vampires gotten
their annual maintenance done for the last 70 years?)

The K\'Kree worlds are full of Vampire fleets.  It is an incredibly
dangerous place to go.

The main worlds are in ruins.  However, K\'Kree claustrophobia paid
off handsomely for the Militant Vegitarian Centaurs.  Nearly all of
their high population worlds were habitable without special life
support.  Few K\'Kree would settle on a world were they could not
roam freely on the plains.  Indeed, any K\'Kree who did settle in
shelters on inhospitable worlds was looked at as something of a
weirdo.  Many of these worlds have survived despite the Vampire
ships raging overhead.  Their technology has been blasted back to
the stone age in most cases, however, K\'Kree with their out doors
culture and vegitarian appetites are in some ways better suited for
this than other species.

Still, this was the chance their ancient enemies had been waiting
for for centuries.

The Hivers, when they recovered from their fall, saw their chance.
The K\'Kree are now utterly powerless.  Immediately, the Hivers
dusted off their old manipulation-invasion plans, and took aim at
the K\'Kree culture!

Traveller Historians may recall the first Hiver-K\'Kree war.  The
aggressive and militarily superior K\'Kree backed off when the
Hivers unveiled their secret manipulations of a few of their
worlds.  Hiver Master Manipulators had socially engineered events
to make a few K\'Kree planets turn away from the monolithic backbone
of K\'Kree culture.  K\'Kree were actually using *MEAT* to sauce
their vegitables!  K\'Kree were going into isolation for
*RECREATION*.  These abominations against the K\'Kree frightened
them so that they immediately sued for peace when the Hivers
threatened to launch their manipulation across the whole of the
K\'Kree 2000 worlds!  The K\'Kree quietly nuked some of their own
planets to stop the abomination.

The Hivers have now contacted a few K\'Kree worlds and have
manipulated their culture to conform with the ideals of the old
Hiver Confederation.  However, you don\'t turn a species of fanatics
onto tolerence of other life in just a few years.  These K\'Kree are
the missionaries of the Hivers to the rest of their race.  Just as
they have in the Imperium, the Hivers have given the K\'Kree the
technology and mission to clean up their entire region of space.
They have formed the KFC:  K\'Kreer Freedom Coalition.

You thought RCES was bad with their Smash And Grab tactics?  The
KFC\'s forces are happy to wipe out any K\'Kree not of their herd who
might stand in their way.  You want ground combat "Star Vikings"?
It\'s much easier to nuke a planet and clean it up with a nuclear
damper than it is to land troops anyway...

Why?  The other K\'Kree are intolerant!  They have no regard for the
lives of aliens and other sentient life.  Thus, they must be
converted or destroyed.  [RL note:  You may at some point in your
life have met up with some of the "Good" skinheads?  The ones who
beat up the "Bad" skinheads?  And the graffiti they spray over cars
is stuff like "JUST SAY NO!" or "BE KIND: REWIND!"  Perhaps you\'ve
met the people who attack anyone if they aren\'t perfectly PC?  The
ones who think all the white males in the world should be lynched?
Picture those guys armed with Grav Tanks, Fusion Guns, Nukes and a
mission from GOD!]

No, the KFC does not eat meat.  (Not usually anyway, as it\'s not
very good for a K\'Kree\'s digestion)  And no, they don\'t *usually*
enjoy isolation.  Psychologically, they are just about the same as
they always were, but they are on a different mission now!

Possible Adventures:
KFC finds a Vampire base set up on a technologically crushed high
population planet in the old 2000 worlds.  Well, it seems the
K\'Kree inhabitants are helping the Virus.  Hmm...  Better nuke \'em
good, then convert the survivors.

Misjumped RCES meet up with misjumped KFC troops.  Gotta cooperate
to get back to the Hive Confederation.

RCES members call in some KFC troops for a special mission.  (They
trained together in the Hiver Technical Academy)

[on strange lack of orbital colonies in Traveller....]

Ray Pullar writes:
>Not that this is a problem for the New Era:  the Virus got them.

Which may be part of the reason you don\'t see many; not just Virus,
but orbital colonies are *fragile*.  If you put a few hundred
thousand or even millions of people in a hull in orbit, it makes a
nice tempting target for an invader or terrorist to hold hostage,
and such a target is much harder to defend than a planetary surface.
(Of course, planets have their problems too.)  And most of the
material that\'s been published has been in the developing Domain
of Deneb area, which is not only more interested in planetary 
resources, but has had this recurrent problem with the neighbors....
Massilia and Core probably had quite a number of orbital colonies,
but we never saw much of either sector pre-Virus.

Of course, when you have high-efficiency maneuver drives, the 
economic cost of the delta-vee paid by siting your industry on a
planetary surface is low enough to make colonies look that much
less attractive as investments.  Deep space jump refueling stations
would be useful, but supply of such a station would be an order
of magnitude more difficult.  My explanation of the "Battle of
Two Suns" that was "midway between Yres and Menorb" in Regina
that ended the Fourth Frontier War was that INI discovered a secret
Zhodani fleet replenishment station being used to support attacks
on those two worlds sited in deep space and that when the Navy
sent a fleet to destroy the station, they stumbled in on a refueling
Zhodani fleet.

[on the Regency and the Official Secrets Act]

One of the Amber Zones in _Best of JTAS_ #1, "Salvage on Sharmun",
mentions an Imperial Official Secrets Act.  The adventurers\' patron,
a scout named Kinson, had to sign the OSA when the ship he was on
was shot down over an interdicted world.  (It was in a fleet carrying
the sector military payroll!)  Undoubtedly the fleet commander had
an Imperial Warrant so that they could go through the area.  The
money was written off as a loss...the culture was too sensitive to
risk recovery.  But that won\'t stop Kinson....  It was a great
adventure, especially since it was the first real Traveller adventure
I ever ran!  It led into all sorts of complications for the party
I was refereeing (he he he).

About the current (1201) First Regent: it\'s probably Seldrian.  We
know Avery Aledon has a ministerial/cabinet-level post.  We know
the First Regent\'s position is hereditary in the same way noble
titles are hereditary.  (I.e., heirs can be chosen by the title holder.)
Avery is most probably Seldrian\'s direct heir if she adopted him
after _Arrival Vengeance_.  And the players\' ages in 1201:
  Strephon Alkhalikoi   born 1049, in 1201 aged 152. (likely dead)
  Norris Aledon         born 1063, in 1201 aged 138. (probably dead)
  Seldrian Aledon       born 1097, in 1201 aged 104.
  Avery Aledon          born 1118, in 1201 aged 83.  

Regency buffs may be interested to note that according to an old TNS
news brief I saw again the other day, "the Duke of Regina\'s seneschal",
i.e. the now-famed Branj Dilgaadin, announced the beginning of the
Fifth Frontier War to the Marches in 1107, not Norris himself!

It\'s actually a pretty responsible step.  As regent, Norris or Seldrian
can\'t assume the office of Emperor without approval of a quorum of the
Imperial Moot, Lucan notwithstanding.  Somehow I doubt that the nobles
left in the Regency constitute a quorum of votes.  Now, conceivably
this could be circumvented by declaring that the Regency is all that is
left of the Imperium (but this is a questionable call, at best).  The
only other option is for the Regency to technically secede, which it
never did during the Rebellion, unlike Daibei, Vland, and Antares.

Furthermore, by maintaining the fiction of an imperial regency, the
Regency asserts the continued existence of the Imperium.  It\'s a 
hedge against the future.  The Regency seems to be protecting the
legal rights of the worlds in the Wilds to be in the Imperium, if
anyone still wants to be in one with Deneb.  Otherwise, the possible
lack of any government claiming to be the "Third Imperium" could 
cause problems with the other old governments moving in on the
ungoverned territory.  It\'s a legal fiction.  Undoubtedly, once
the Regency is able to recontact the other worlds of the old
Imperium and assess the situation, a more permanent decision can
be made.  (In a sense, the Regency is in a semi-permanent state of
"crisis management" until then.)  

Of course, none of this stops anyone from doing anything out there
in the Wilds.  The Regency is only betting that someday, someone
might set up a bargaining table, maybe even they themselves, and
they know they\'ll want to be in a good bargaining position at that
table.  After all, there\'s no doubt that someone will have to 
negotiate with a lot of *very* angry neighbors about this whole

If
anyone uses it I would certainly like to hear how it was altered to fit into
a
particula campaign and how the adventure was resolved.

AURORA RCES HQ  -  Khulam Subsector Directorate
  Intel indicates elements of the Kide (3131/Khulam) local military are
seeking offworld assistance in the overthrow of the current TED.  Team is
needed to contact insurgent agent(s) to confirm intel and if possible to
asist
in coup.
- ----
                                    KIDE COUP

  Intel is passed to the players about a senior Kide army officer seeking
offworld help.  If the group is RCES they will simply be assigned the
mission.
If the are free lancers this info (a possibly lucretive if dangerous job)
will
come their way via a government or Free Merchant contact.
  The initial part of the scenario will involve travel to the Kide system,
avoiding the Kide sig-delts, making their way planet-side, and contacting the
army officer - one General Edmond.  One way to get onto Kide would be travel
with Free Merchant contacts (although such will expect payment of some sort)
or posing as merchants themselves.
  Once on the world finding Edmond will be easy - just ask any military
personnel who will direct the PCs to the starport cantina.  Edmond will
initially question PCs to assure their trustworthyness and if assured will
offer ship parts (stored at a starport warehouse for assistancwe with his
plan.  Whatever the agreement he will provide 10% upfront and the rest upon
success of his planned coup.

  His plan involves having the group contact elements of the army, loyal to
Edmone, currently stationed in the jungles west of the Kargamir Sea.  Once a
signal is r4eceived from Edmond the PCs will lead these forces in a
diversionary attack on the starport (keeping damage to a minimun) with the
PCs
used to neutralize the Imperial Guard.  This will hopefully result in some of
the Imp. Gd at Arturo\'s residence to be sent as reinforcements and allow
Edmond to take Arturo.
  A day or two after they make contact the army unit will come under fierce
attack from guerrillas.  These guerrillas are led by one of the two remaining
TEDs left after Arturo united Kide.  Unless the PCs are extremely careful(or
lucky) they will fall into the hands of these guerrillas.  This is not all
bad
as the TED may easily be convinced to join the coup with his forces taking
the
place of the recently defeated army unit.

  Before agreeing to such an attack the TED has a test for the PCs.  During
the period of civil wars one of the leaders established an ammo cache in the
mountains south of the Kargamir.  The TED has a mpa showing its location and
he wants the group to travel there with four of his men.  The cache is no
doubt protected by automated defenses and while his men wait outside the PCs
are to enter the cache and disarm the defenses and return with as much ammo
as
possible.
  To this end the group will stop at a village along the way and acquire pack
animals - obviously the guerrillas are for simply taking the animals, the PCs
may choose other options.  Travel through the mountains to the cache should
be
fairly easy with maybe one fauna encounter and possibly another encounter
involving a difficult crossing on the mountain path.  The cach is protected
by
a TL9 retinal scanner locking system which requires lockpicking tools for a
Difficult: Intrusion task (lock quality has deteriorated due to age) to
bypass
the system.  BTW from MegaTraveller:

Lockpick Set:  Allows picking of ordinary locks by a dextrous and skilled
user.  Lockpicks are illegal on most worlds; on such worlds the cost rises to
Cr100 or more.
 A lockpick set of a given Tech Level cannot be used against types of locks
of
higher Tech Levels, but it may be used against a lock of higher TL if it is
equipped to deal with that type of lock.  For example, a TL6 kit cannot be
used against electronic locks since these begin to appear at TL7. However the
same kit could be used against a TL7 deadbolt lock, albeit at a slight
disadvantage; the difference in Tech Levels could be used as a DM to the
success roll.

TL          Vol          Weight         Price
- ----
5           0.5 liters   0.25 kg        Cr10-100

  The cach is also guarded by a few automated laser defenses, etc. -
Difficult: Observation to locate.  The contents include vast stores of
ammunition and a G-Carrier in very poor condition (wear value 8 or 9, half
normal armor).  Return to the guerilla camp is uneventful and soon thereafter
the signal is rec\'d from Edmond.

  When they reach their assigned positions near the starport they are met by
the contact sent by Edmond. She naturally is doubtful about trusting the
guerrilla force but can be convinced by the PCs.  She tells the group to
begin
the attack on the starport in three hours.
  Initially the attack goes smoothly.  The PCs will become involved in a
firefight with a group of Imp. Gd. lift troops (Veteran, TL10) in Combat
Armor
equal to twice the number of PCs.  Their first clue that the plan has gone
awry is when they hear the TED over their radios say, "Those stinkin\' Arses
sold us out.  Everyone retreat and if you see the offworlders cut them down."
  Possibly a group of guerrillas will bump into them and another fight will
ensue but soon a number of grav tanks will be seen in the distance.  At this
point all the guerrillas will flee and the Edmond\'s contact will run up to
the
group.  She will pant in a near hysterical voice that an offworlder, she
thinks with the Guild that Edmond also contacted revealed the plot to the
Imperial Guard.  Edmond has been captured and she needs to get off the
planet.
The group at this time may notice (Easy:Observation) that they are outside
the
warehouse where they rec\'d the first shipment of ship parts.
  Shouldthey enter the warehouse they will find a transport vehicle of some
kind which they will be able to load with 1 ton of ship parts.  They arrive
at
the ship and load the parts just as the Kide military is closing in.  By this
time the ship is ready to take off.

  The three AD batteries will each get one attack on the ship before it is
out
of range.  Unless an Average: Sensors check is failed the ship avoids the
sig-
delts and will outrun them to the jump-point.  Should the check fail only one
sig-delt is manned and able to react.  Every time it fires or is struck there
is a 1 in 10 cumulative chance that the power plant will fail rendering the
ship temporarily helpless for long enough for the PCs to escape).
  Obviously the ship parts can be sold but should the group successfully
escape with the woman contact they will be well rewarded by the RC (whatever
that means).

Drives must discharge accumulated energy before moving on, and they must do
so in a significant gravity well. A deep space station with that much

Sphere-scale) station. Lemme know if I\'m wrong. . .

is a list of all the subsector names I\'ve seen by sector, one the list of

Whoops.
 
I forgot about the "period on a line by itself" rule. Here is the
rest of my posting on MaxThink and the building of Traveller
hypernets:
 
 
One way to visualize a hypernet is hierarchically, like this:

Each of the above branches could then branch out, even to each
other.  Extensive interlinking makes the structure more akin to a
network than a hierarchy.  Networks can include circular routes,
star patterns, group-ins, group-outs, and imbedded hierarchies.
 
 
Speaking of hierarchies, Traveller breaks down rather easily into
a hierarchy.  Here is the Traveller branch from the tree above
expanded to show one possible breakdown:

If all traveller material was organized in this structure, rather
than spread out and mixed together, it would be a breeze to learn
and use.  That\'s where MaxThink comes in.
 
The above diagram took me over 2 hours to construct.  That was
with the hierarchy already in mind -- if I was building this
thing from scratch in this format, modifying the structure during
construction would be a major pain.  And, as you can see, I
rapidly ran out of room for subcategories.  The outline format is
so much easier to work with -- the above classification scheme
could be constructed and in MaxThink in a matter of minutes, and
more completely, with plenty of room to expand.

Contact me if you are interested in purchasing MaxThink.
 
I shall try, within the next couple of weeks, to post an
explanation of Transtext (a hypertext word-processor that works
well in combination with MaxThink) and how it can be used to make
your "Travelling" life easier.

    "Psychological warfare is buying a poster of a window complete
    with lacy curtains and a very excited dirty-old peeping-tom
    peering in through one corner, and giving it lovingly to your

    take it down off her bedroom wall when it starts giving her
    the creeps."

I\'m about to explain a type of technology that can make the

Description:
- ----
 
MaxThink is a heirarchical outliner.  With it, you arrange
information exactly as you would in a standard outline written on
paper -- With a main-topic, indented sub-topics, and
sub-sub-topics indented still further, etc.  The difference is
that in MaxThink, you can rearrange the structure and content of
the outline so much faster and easier, which is ideal for
organizing knowledge, whether you are writing a book (or many
books), writing a report, catalogging or building your expertise,
or running a TRAVELLER campaign.  The information used in most
RPG\'s fits nicely into MaxThink\'s hierarchical structure.
 
Topics consist of text.  They may contain whatever text you want
to include, from a single character to reams of jibbering.  Below
are excerpts from a printout of a sample Traveller-related
MaxThink outline:

Notes concerning the above printout:   You may control the
formatting of printouts, including defining the numbering system
to be used (if any), how many levels are to be shown, margins,
subtopic indentation, and line spacing.  The outline above is
truncated both in its length and depth -- in the outline from
which this printout was generated, each timeline entry has an
action-by-action account of the event, and each character has
subtopics beneath it which fully define that character.
 
 
MaxThink\'s Display
- ----
 
Below is an approximation of what MaxThink looks like on the
screen.  I\'ve shortened it a bit so you could see the whole thing
without scrolling (the actual display takes up the entire
computer screen, so there are generally 19 topics showing rather
than just 8).  Also, the menu includes a highlighted pointer, but
I couldn\'t depict it in ASCII -- in the display below, imagine
that the Brainstorm menu item is highlighted -- I\'ve used
brackets [] to signify highlighting.  Also, the numeral at the
top of the screen is always highlighted, as can be any of the
numbers in the list.  To depict the text cursor in later screens
when I show you the Edit Mode, I shall use the * sign.

Here is an explanation of the above display:
 
Note that I\'ve used square brackets where the program uses
highlighting (reverse video), so topics #2, #5, and #7, and the
Brainstorm menu selection are highlighted.
 
Since there is no cursor present on the screen, this means you
are in TOPIC MODE.  See the arrow to the left of topic #5?  That
is your TOPIC POINTER. It signifies which TOPIC you desire to
work on.  While in topic mode, it can be moved with the cursor
keys:  Up, Down, Right, Left, Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn.  The
Right Arrow key takes you one level deeper into the outline (to
the sub-topics of the currently selected topic), and the Left
Arrow key takes you one level higher in the outline (to the
parent of the currently displayed topics).
 
The Ins key, and the function keys F7, F8, F9, and F10 are your
one-key TOPIC CREATION commands.  F10 and Ins both create a topic
after the one you are currently pointing at (a sibling), F9
creates a topic before the currently selected one (a sibling), F7
creates a topic one level higher (an uncle), and F8 creates a
topic one level deeper (a subtopic, or child).
 
Now, lets take a look at the outline from which the printout
above was taken:

The list shown in the above display is the top level of a
Traveller outline from a Traveller hypernet (a hypernet is a
system of interlinked files, each of which may be an outline or
any other kind of file).  The list is actually much longer -- to
see the rest of the topics on the list, use the Down Arrow key or
the PgDn key to scroll down the list.  To quickly jump to a
specific topic on the list, press "J" to activate the Jump
command from the command menu, then the number of the topic, then
Enter; or you can select the Jump command by moving the command
highlight by pressing the Space bar until Jump is highlighted,
and then press Enter.  To activate any command, all you have to
do is press the first letter of that command while in TOPIC MODE.
 
 
When a topic\'s number is highlighted, it means that the topic has
children (sub-topics) below it in the outline tree.  To go to and
see those sub-topics, move the topic pointer to the topic you
wish to see the children of, and then press the Right Arrow key
once.
 
Here is how the above display changes after pressing the Right
Arrow key once:

You\'ve moved 1 level deeper into the outline and are now looking
(see above) at the subtopics of the first topic from the previous
level.  Notice the "PATH" indicator on the STATUS line (bottom
line of the display) above.  It shows the path to the currently
selected topic.  Also on the status line is the amount of free
memory space left, the name of the file currently loaded, the
text/heading indicator and the display depth indicator. The F2
key toggles from full-text to 1st-line viewing only, and vice
versa (I\'ll demonstrate this later).  The "2" on the status line
above means that 2 levels are shown on the screen at once.  To
increase this press the Ctrl and the Right Arrow key.
 
Here is the display after Ctrl-Right is pressed once:

I stopped at the above location so that you wouldn\'t get lost.
Take a look at the path, and compare that with the path in
previously shown displays in this article, and you will know
precisely where you are in the outline. When in the program, you
can always move back up levels to see where you are.
 
Notice the angle-bracketed entry <c:\\rpg\\trav\\invasion.adv>.
That is a link-out to another outline (the one that contains the
adventure).  By having the adventure in a seperate outline, you
can access it from multiple places (such as from here, and from a
subtopic of the Adventures/Scenarios topic you saw earlier on the
top level) within the presently viewed outline or from a larger
hypernet (the above adventure could be accessed from any number
of linked outlines, or from within one or more text files).  The
topic number isn\'t highlighted because there is nothing "under"
this topic in the current outline (i.e., it has no sub-topics).
 
Now, we shall jump to topic #4 on the list above, which is
another link-out, so we press J, 4, Enter, and then Right -- 3
Downs and a Right would do the same thing.  Then, MaxThink
automatically saves the outline we are leaping out of (if any
changes have been made to it), and loads the outline specified in
the angle brackets.
 
Here it is, showing the entire screen:

it has no noticeable effect if none of your topics are longer
than one line, but comes in very handy when viewing outlines with
verbose paragraphs, as in the display above.

The commands in MaxThink allow you to manipulate text in ways far
beyond what word processors are capable of.  That is primarily
because blocks of text in MaxThink are PREDEFINED -- each topic
is a defacto block of text which you can DO THINGS TO.  In a word
processor, you have to mark a block of text before you can do
anything to it, but not in MaxThink.  Even more significant than
this is that, by having blocks of text predefined (they are
defined the instant they are created), the relationships between
these blocks/topics are also predefined, being implicit to the
very tree structure of outlines.  This allows you TO MANAGE
BLOCKS OF TEXT BASED UPON THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM.
 
Because the (sibling, parent, uncle, and offspring) relationships
between topics are known, this makes possible many commands that
can manipulate text based upon these relationships, and also
gives added power to standard block copy/move commands in that
they can refer to these relationships by referring to locations
in the outline\'s tree.  This allows for the creation of commands
that are far more effective in ORGANIZING TEXT AS PIECES OF
KNOWLEDGE. In word-processed documents, your pieces of knowledge
are organized in a linear fashion, and are therefore much more
difficult to manage well.
 
Therefore, in MaxThink, moving through your documents is much
easier, as is copying, moving, sorting (alphabetically sorting or
interactively rearranging), categorizing, and in general
reorganizing the text (or any portion thereof) contained therein.
 
For typical routine word processing, since paragraphs are
predefined blocks of text in MaxThink, this allows you to create
and manipulate conventional documents more effectively in
MaxThink, even if you want to retain their conventional linear
format.
 
Editing complex documents becomes easier and faster, because
MaxThink allows you to work with text in ways that are closer to
your patterns of thinking.
 
On top of the text-manipulation abilities, MaxThink can also LINK
files together, allowing for the organization of entire knowledge
nets.  It has several very powerful commands designed for
managing not only the relationships between the topics contained
in the currently loaded outline, but also the relationships of
many individual outlines (and other files) to each other!
 
 
 
              Creating a Traveller Outline from Scratch
 
 
 
 
Here\'s what a new outline looks like:

To edit the topic currently being pointed at (in this case, the TITLE),
activate the Edit command by pressing "E".  Then you will see a cursor
within the body of the topic.  (I\'ve used an asterisk * to depict the
cursor).  Now you can start typing...

Notice that the menu disappeared.  To exit EDIT MODE and return to TOPIC
MODE, simply press the escape key (ESC).
 
I recommend you keep the title to a mere line or two.  Elaboration should
be reserved for the body of the outline.
 
Your outline after typing the title:

Once you have entered the Title, press the F8 key, and start typing to your
heart\'s content.  F8 creates a subtopic, and works from either TOPIC MODE
or EDIT MODE.

Next, you can press F8 again and type in the first item in your collection,
or you could press F10 to create the next topic on this level.  Here is the
outline after pressing F10 and entering the text of several items:

Enter text, press ESC when entry complete
TEXT       2        PATH:  0                194 Kbytes
- ----
 
 
 
Note that you can move the cursor with the cursor control keys.   UP and
DOWN will traverse the text of topics.  Using LEFT or RIGHT off of the end
of a topic will move to the parent (LEFT) or to the first child (RIGHT).
In addition, most of the WORDSTAR cursor control key combinations work as
well (move right one word, etc.)
 
Let\'s say that once you type in the above, you decide to rearrange the
order of the topics.  There are many ways to do this.  First, press the
ESC key to return to TOPIC MODE.

The MAIN Menu includes commands and 3 submenus.  The submenus are the
BRAINSTORM menu, the FILES menu, and the OPTIONS MENU.  All the other
entries are commands.  To activate a command move the command highlight
with the Space bar or Backspace key, and press Enter.  Or just type the
first letter of the command to instantly activate it while in TOPIC MODE.
Here is what each of the commands do:
 
C = Copy -- Copies the current topic or selected range of topics to a
    specified location in the outline (see also Get and Put).  The vairous
    methods of copying in MaxThink are ideal for creating new characters,
    ships, planets, or equipment in TRAVELLER, because you can copy an
    existing entry and type over it, or you can use a dummy entry (complete
    with subtopics) which includes only the text that remains the same from
    entry to entry  -- the content descriptors (such as Strength __,
    Dexterity __, Endurance __, etc.) -- then you can just fill in the
    blanks.  Saves a lot of work, especially when designing planets.
 
D = Delete -- Deletes the current topic or selected range of topics.  The
    DEL key on the cursor control pad does the same thing when in TOPIC
    MODE.  Actually, this command sends the current topic to the topic
    buffer, from where it can be relocated if desired, but be careful,
    since only one deletion is held in the buffer.  Each deletion clears
    the material already in the buffer before placing the text of the
    current deletion there.  To get text out of the topic buffer and back
    into your outline, use the Put or Undo commands.
 
E = Edit -- Changes to EDIT MODE, placing the cursor at the beginning of
    the current topic.  The menu disappears, and can\'t be accessed again
    until you press the Esc key.  In edit mode, your keyboard is converted
    into a typewriter for entering text (in Topic Mode the keyboard is a
    control console or sorts).  The cursor control keypad can be used to
    move the text cursor.
 
G = Get -- Sends a copy of the topic or selected range of topics to the
    topic buffer.  For use with the Put command.  Note that the topic
    buffer isn\'t usually cleared before a link-out, therefore the GET and
    PUT commands can be used to transfer material between outlines, and
    between MaxThink\'s two windows (see the Z command).
 
I = Insert -- Creates a topic after the current topic (on the same level),
    and automatically puts you in EDIT MODE.  The F10 key and the Ins key do
    the same thing, though the F10 key will also do this while in EDIT
    MODE.
 
L = Lock -- Locks the current topic or range of topics to the topic pointer
    so that it can be dragged to a new location in the outline.  The
    standard cursor control keys work in dragging UP, DOWN, LEFT (up a
    level), RIGHT (down a level), PgUp, PgDn, Home (to the top of a list),
    and End.  The power in the Lock command lies in the fact that all
    subtopics are dragged along with their parent topic, thus entire
    branches (or groups of branches) of your knowledge tree can be moved
    with ease.  To release the dragged text to the topic pointer\'s present
    location, press the Esc key.  The Lock command is the most
    fundamentally basic of the interactive sorting commands.  The
    lock-drag-release sequence can allow you to rearrange a list or
    restructure an entire outline in a matter of minutes or even seconds.
 
J = Jump -- Allows you to teleport to anywhere in your outline.  Just enter
    the path of the topic you want to teleport to.  A number entered with
    no dots within it will teleport you to that entry on the currently
    displayed level.  This is tech-level 16 transportation at your
    fingertips!
 
M = Move  -- Allows you to to teleport text from anywhere in your outline
    to anywhere else in your outline.  You may enter the path as in the
    Jump command, or you may point to the end destination with the TOPIC
    POINTER.
 
P = Put -- Copies everything in the topic buffer to the specified location,
    by entering the path, or by moving the topic pointer.  Get and Put used
    in conjunction are another way to teleport text from one location to
    another within your outline.  Get and Put are the only commands that
    can transfer text directly between outlines and across MaxThink\'s two
    windows.
 
Q = Quit -- Exits the program.  Allows you to save the currently outline
    before quitting.  Also hesitates if there is something in the second
    window.
 
X = The "X marks the spot" command.  This command jumps to your X-list,
    which is a seperate screen that can hold up to 20 shortcuts in the
    current outline.  When you press "X" for the first time, the shortcut
    screen is empty.  To enter the current topic for jumping to it more
    easily later, press the Ins key.  You can move through the shortcut
    list with the topic pointer, selecting which topic to jump to with the
    RIGHT ARROW key.  To remove an entry from the shortcut list, simply
    point to it and press the DEL key.  The "X" command essentially allows
    you to predefine your teleports.
 
U = Undo -- Undoes the last command.  If the last thing you did was create
    a topic, then this command will uncreate it (delete it).  You can also
    undo deletions in this way -- but only the last one you did.  Some
    complex commands in the BRAINSTORM menu can\'t be undone.
 
R = Ref -- This command will come in very handily when MaxThink\'s memory
    limits are removed in future versions, but is of limited usefulness
    now.  It creates a word reference list of all the words that appear in
    the current outline.  You can then scroll through the list with the
    topic pointer, and jump to the occurance in the outline itself of any
    word desired (with the Right Arrow key).  This command takes up a lot
    of memory, so it only works on relatively small outlines -- it
    overloads on outlines larger than about 10K.  I expect this will become
    one of Maxthink\'s most powerful features in the future.
 
Z = Z -- MaxThink has two windows.  That is, you can have two outlines
    loaded in MaxThink at the same time.  To toggle back and forth between
    the two windows, simply press Z while in TOPIC MODE.  The 2nd window is
    always there, even if you\'ve only loaded one outline -- the 2nd window
    comes in handy for jotting down notes that you want to transfer to
    several different outlines later, or as a temporary holding facility
    for transferring material with the Get and Put commands, or for holding
    an extra outline.
 
V = V -- Shows the version number of MaxThink being used.
 
A = A -- Copies the current topic or a range of topics to the file
    CLIP.TXT.  CLIP.TXT can then be converted into another outline, or into
    a document of some other sort.  A useful research tool, ideal for
    selecting info to be printed out for your players.

Just for the record, these NPC\'s are Vargr, and not human. And how to
play them? Ever read Under the eye of God by David Gerrold? It is about
two Trackers (sort of bounty hunters) which are brothers, twins if I do
not remember wrong. If you haven\'t read that book; shame on you.

However these two brothers (from the same litter) joined the Oruelaen, a
psionic group working for the King of Thirz Empire. This group are
mainly infromation gatherers and observeres for the King. Tasks as
bodyguards for diplomatic envoys and doing research for the King are
their main job. They do not get into "James Bond" work often as they are
few and expensive to train. This group are not secret, but the number of
members are. In fact there are less than 300 members of the group.

Eskhevaedz comes from the same litter as Uerzrro (NPC no 0002). As they
grew up far from others they stuck together in all situations. When
they came of age they both decided to join the Thirz Empire Navy.
As many in the Thirz empire are tested for psionic ability when they
enter the service, they were found to have the requirements to become a
part of Oruelaen, a psionic military group in Thirz Empire.

As Eskhevaedz are physically larger and more charismatic sophonts tend
to notice him and ignore his smaller brother. Thus removing the
attention away from him, which in many cases work out to their
advantage.

Of the two Uerzrro is the quite one, even though he is far better
shot and driver. Being smaller and more quite tends to work in his
favor as most sophonts just ignore him, and consentrate on his bigger
brother, thus giving him a upper hand.

I\'m sorry for any bad wrapping of the lines that might occur. I have
tried to weed out the long lines, but I\'m not sure if I have been too
successful with it.

As an added bonus I\'ll include the stats for the 5mm Oruelaen Issue
Gauss Pistol:

TL:     15
Ammo:   5x25mm
Empty   1.264Kg
Loaded  2.251Kg
Ammo    0.987Kg
Mag:    28/0.767
Weapon: 2633Cr
Ammo:   0.157/5.9Cr

ROF:    5
Dam:    4
Pen:    1-2-nil
Blk:    1
SS:     1
Brst:   4
Rng     31

This weapon are given to all Oruelaen operatives, and they get to keep
it after they have ended their service, provided it is a honorary
discharge. All the weapons are marked and numbered so a stolen weapon
will be easily tracked. Even when the number is removed the weapon will
stand out from the rest as it is not available commercially anywhere.

The numbers calculated here has been found with the following formula.
LS = ((SD-HO)*150,000,000)/300,000
LS = Distance in Lightseconds.
SD = Outer limit of Central star\'s 100 diameter in AU
HO = Habital zone Orbit in AU

The TNE rules mention that a starship must exit jumpspace at least
100 diameters out from a body, but it fails to mention that exiting
jumpspace in many system will put the starship several AU from its
target world due to that the 100 diameter of the central star is
stretching further out than the habital zone.

Thus in extreme cases there will take several years travel in normal
space before the mainworld will be reached. Taking the most extreme
example, a M9 Ia star. Travel from jump point to the mainworld will
take little more than 5 years if 100 gee hours of thrust is spent.
This will be reduced if the craft is refueling at gas giants on the
way.

This type of influence from the sentral star will have to be dealt with
in some way. There is two way to deal with it.

1. The problem doesn\'t exist. Only the size of the mainworld matter.
Thus ending this discusion once and for all.

2. Let the matter stand and find a way to explain how the history could
evolve as it did, even for several days, or weeks of travel had to be
commited. Even years in the extreme.

I will go for option 2. Because it is an interesting discusion. And I
have taken the reservation that the mainworld always are in the
habitable zone.

Taking the example above, but with MT rules, a ship under constant 1 gee
acceleration would make the same trip in 153 days. Here we get into a
trouble with the fuel duration.

The TNE gee hour system makes the game more fun, but then again it makes
high gee traders unnecessary. High gee are only usable in combat. If you
got a 1 gee ship or a 5 gee ship does not matter when you only can spend
20 gee hours of fuel. Most of the ships in the TNE book only got about
20 to 30 gee hours to spend. That might depend on their low tech, where
their powerplant and crew accommodations takes up a lot of space.

The effect of limited gee hours, will make the end of wilderness
refueling at gas giants in most cases. Unless you\'ll be too far outside
the habitable zone, and spend several days worth of travelling. If the
system configuration allows it, it would be wise to fuelscoop at a gas
ggiant.^M 


If the distance is so long that the travel will take several weeks or
months, it would be more adviseable to put up a trading post on a planet
outside the 100 diameter limit of the central star, and let merchants
trade there, and then use ships built specially for in-system travel.
When they don\'t have to lugg around a jumpdrive, the space can be taken
up by reactionmass, increasing the gee hours.

If the travel time is truly long, the crafts would probably be manned by
robots, for plain cargo runs. Passenger should be placed in  lowberth
for the duration of the travel. Any sophont crew should be of the type
with strong willpower and a steady psyke. Which are necessary to stand
the condition of prolonged confinement to enclosed spaces, and dull
rroutines. ^M 



This will also change the strategic, and tactical fighting for a system,
compared to how it was considered in MT. The gas giants are suddenly
the single most important part in a system to ensure victory. In case
warships has to spend several weeks or months to get to their targets,
they will be commited soon as they cross the 100 diameter boundary of
the central star. If the battle for the gas giant is lost, only fleet
tankers may help them out again. If the captains are desperate enough
they might risk a jump out of the system. In many ways fighting ship can
have far less gee hours to spend for travelling than merchants, when
they need fuel for combat maneuvers. A good estimate is to use about
half the reaction mass to the travel and the rest for the battle for the

gas giant. Over-confident, or desperate commanders may order the use of
jumpfuel for combat maneuvers or for travelling. Either way fighting
ships should refuel their jump fuel before they start the travel inwards
in the system. Systems where it will take more than a month or two of
travel will be quite safe from invasion, when a fighting ship will get
problems with morale, and the tactical initiative will be lost. Two
months gives a lot of time to prepare to meet an enemy.

The real fun of the calculus start when there is a binary or trinary
star system, and the companion stars overlap the central stars 100
diameter limit. Some may even at times have their 100 diameter limit
overlap the main world. But I will leave this kind of calculus to the
reader when my own maths skills ends long before this level are
reached.


I would like to get comments on this, either here or mail me personally.

Special Key Commands in Topic Mode
- ----
 
F5 -- Your next question is probably "How do you mark a range of topics?"
      In TOPIC MODE, the F5 key starts the marked range on the currently
      selected topic, and then you move the cursor with the cursor control
      keys to elsewhere on the currently listed level, and press F5 again
      to mark the other end of the range.  Most of the menu commands and
      special key commands work on a range as well as an individual topic,
      though there are exceptions.  In addition, many commands allow you to
      type in a range -- but marking a range with the F5 key is usually
      easier.   In edit mode, F5 activates the text marker, for
      standard word-processor block copies/moves/deletions.
 
Shift-F6 -- Define the Macro.  Extremely powerful, even though limited to
            about 80 keystrokes.  This feature allows you to create
            powerful command combos on the fly, including editing text and
            the activation of commands. Unfortunately, MaxThink can only
            have a single macro defined at one time -- Therefore, until
            this feature is upgraded, having a third-party macro program
            (or macro-capable operating environment) can boost the power of
            MaxThink by at least a magnitude.  Works the same in Edit Mode,
            and allows the switching of modes within the macro.  To use,
            press Shift-F6 to record your macro, and again when you are
            finished.  Press Shift-F6 twice to clear the current macro --
            it is a good habit to clear the macro after finishing up with a
            destructive or data-shuffling macro.
 
F6 -- Execute the Macro.  Be sure you remember which mode you defined the
      macro in, for you will need to start the macro in that mode for it to
      work right.  The same keystrokes mean different things in MaxThink\'s
      various modes, so getting this right is critical.  Saving the outline
      before extensive macro use is definitely a good idea.
 
F7 -- Creates a topic one level up from the current topic, moves the topic
      pointer to the new topic, and automatically enters EDIT MODE.  Works
      just as well from EDIT MODE.
 
F8 -- Creates a subtopic under the current topic, moves the topic pointer
      to the new topic, and automatically enters EDIT MODE.  Works just as
      well from EDIT MODE.
 
F9 -- Creates a topic immediately before the current topic on the current
      level, moves the topic pointer to the new topic, and automatically
      enters EDIT MODE.  Works just as well from EDIT MODE.
 
F10 -- Creates a topic immediately after the current topic on the current
       level, moves the topic pointer to the new topic, and automatically
       enters EDIT MODE.  Works just as well from EDIT MODE.
 
 
 
 
THE BRAINSTORM MENU
- ----
 
The pinnacle of MaxThink\'s text-manipulation technology lies in the
Brainstorm Menu.  Pressing Enter while the Brainstorm item is highlighted
(being the first entry on the main menu, it usually is highlighted), or
typing "B" from anywhere on the main menu, will change the menu display as
below:

Let\'s say your mind is going a mile-a-minute, and you are being bombarded
by your imagination with lots of ideas.  You start pressing F10 every few
seconds, creating a new topic and type like mad entering text.  It\'s all
you can do to keep up with your thoughts, so you don\'t bother categorizing
as you brainstorm.  Before too long, you have a very long list of possibly
unrelated ideas, task reminders, and observations.  That\'s where the
Brainstorm commands come in.
 
Or, perhaps you have generated a very long list of vehicles of every
conceivable description.  Selecting a particular type of vehicle for game
play would then require searching across many irrelavent entries.  Sorting
them into categories would make finding a specific kind of vehicle much
easier in the future.  This is where the Brainstorm commands come in.
 
Again, all you have to do is type the first letter of the command, so from
the main menu you would type B (to select the Brainstorm Menu) followed by
the first letter of the brainstorm command you wanted to activate.  Of
course you could use the Space bar and Enter key to make the selection
instead.
 
 
 
 
 
                     ----
                     SUPER-POWERED COMMANDS:
                     ----
 
Typing from the main menu:
 
BB = Brainstorm/Binsort -- Best used after marking a range.  This powerful
     command turns the selected topic or range of topics into bins numbered
     from 1 up to 16 into which the rest of the items on the same level can
     be interactively tossed into with ease.  Simply determine your
     categories, place them at the top of the list, mark them, and then
     press BB.  They will be seperated from the rest of the items on the
     level by a line marked prominently with +++++BINSORT+++++++ (I call
     this the "Binsort Barrier").  For the item at the top of the remainder
     of the list below the Binsort Barrier, type the number of the bin you
     want it sent to and press Enter, and that topic is instantly MOVED to
     the sub-level below the topic (bin) chosen, becoming a subtopic of it.
     The next item on the list instantly steps up for its turn to be
     categorized in this way.  To skip an item on the queue, press Enter
     and it will be sent to the end of the list for reconsideration later
     (thus, you can scroll through the list if you want).  If you want to
     send an item to two or more bins, Alt-C will make a copy of whatever
     item in the you are currently pointing at.  Binsort is arguably the
     most powerful command in the program, competing for this position with
     the Brainstorm/Gather command, the Brainstorm/Sort command, and the
     Lock Command.
 
     The Traveller vehicles list mentioned above can thus be easily sorted
     into the categories of Land Vehicles, Water-borne Vehicles, Air
     Transport, Sub-light Spacecraft, and Starships.   Those categories
     could then be further subdivided (by using BB again) -- For example,
     Land Vehicles could be subdivided into Tracked Vehicles, Wheeled
     Vehicles, Air-Cushioned Vehicles, Legged Vehicles, Pogos, Rail
     Transport, Tubular Transport, and Cable Cars.
 
 
BC = Brainstorm/Categorize -- Restructures a list divided by fences so that
all the topics between the "fence" topics become subtopics of those fences.
Useful for reversing a Levelize (see below) but also useful for outline
building similar to Binsort above.  Some people think best in terms of
boundaries rather than in subclasses.  These fences represent boundaries.
Simply move your topics around so that they are within the proper
boundaries (delineated by the fences), and then type BC.  To make a topic
into a "fence" topic, use the Brainstorm/Tag command below.
Brainstorm/Categorize is best used with a marked range.
 
BD = Brainstorm/Divide --  Divides a topic by line, paragraph, sentence, or
     word.  Great for breaking up documents into their component bits of
     knowledge.  If you want to retain the orignal undivided topic in your
     outline, then make a duplicate of it first with Copy or Get/Put, and
     then Brainstorm/Divide the duplicate.
 
BF = Brainstorm/Fence -- Places a fenced topic before, after, or as a
     subtopic of, the current topic.  The first 11 characters of a "fence"
     are 10 equal signs followed by a space.  You can enter the text to
     follow the fence in the command itself, or you can go back and edit
     the topics created by this command.  This command provides a way of
     inserting boundaries into lists.  It is very useful in conjunction
     with Brainstorm/Categorize.
 
BG = Brainstorm/Gather --  An extremely powerful interactive
     sorting/moving/copying command.  This command has its very own buffer,
     and has two modes of operation:
 
         Brainstorm/Gather/Auto -- Gathers globally or selectively into
         MaxThink\'s Gather buffer all topics that contain a search string
         specified by the user.  The topics in the buffer may then be
         copied or moved to the desired location.  If moved, they no longer
         exist from where they were gathered.  If copied, they still can be
         found in their original locations as well as in the new one.  This
         command is perfect for gathering all the material on a particular
         subject from within an outline/document, for instance to gather
         all the topics that mention a particular character, government, or
         alien race.
 
 
         Brainstorm/Gather/Manual -- Probably my favorite command, because
         it gives you full juggling control over your material, and is best
         used for the sorting of ideas and random thoughts.  When this
         command is active, the F5 key becomes the grab key.  The cursor
         keys move the topic pointer as normal, but most other keys will
         not work, except for the following:  When the F5 key is pressed,
         the current topic (and all of its subtopics) are moved to the
         Gather buffer.  The F7, F8, F9, and F10 keys will reinsert the
         last gathered topic to the level above, to the level below, as the
         topic immediately before, or as the topic immediately after the
         current topic, respectively.  Topics in the buffer are NOT wiped
         out by subsequently gathered topics, but is cleared (as explained
         below) when the command is completed or exited.  This command
         operates on the Last-In-First-Out principle, and you can cycle
         through the gathered topics by spitting them out (with F7, F8, F9,
         and/or F10) and reswallowing any of them at any time with F5.
         After you are through gathering, or gathering/juggling, or
         swallowing/spitting, you may press Esc to abort on those items
         left in the Gather buffer, or press Enter to copy or move the
         items left in the Gather buffer.  Esc sends the topics still in
         the buffer back to where they came from, while Enter sends the
         topics (or copies of them as you desire) to the location you
         specify.
 
         This command competes with the Binsort command because not only
         can you interactively categorize topics, you can regrab any topic
         that you decide you don\'t want to put there.  However, this
         command is more of a general purpose interactive copy/move command
         with more emphasis on moving around, and therefore it is not as
         streamlined as Binsort is for categorical sorting.  The
         grab/move-cursor/reinsert sequence of the Brainstorm/Gather/Manual
         command is even more powerful than the Lock command at rearranging
         lists and reorganizing entire outlines, and is best used for
         industrial-sized outline remodeling jobs.  :)
 
BJ = Brainstorm/Join -- Join a marked or specified range of topics by line
     or word.  Joining by line saves paragraph information (useful for
     redividing back into paragraphs later), while joining by word
     wordwraps the joined material into a single paragraph.  Great for
     combining gathered concepts into essay form for editing.  Some data is
     better viewed in paragraph form rather than outline form, for
     instance, that is how I prefer character descriptions.
 
BL = Brainstorm/Levelize -- This command collapses a specified portion of
     your outline from multiple levels into a single level.  You may
     specify how many levels to collapse.  Levelizing starts from the
     current level and affects the sub-levels below it.  The most useful
     feature of the command is that it allows you to specify if you want
     the parent topics to receive fences (labels) or not.  This allows the
     use of the Brainstorm/Categorize command to refold a levelizedlist
     back into its orginal hierarchical structure.  Brainstorm/Levelize
     converts outlines or portions thereof into boundary-separated lists,
     and Brainstorm/Categorize converts them back again.
 
BP = Brainstorm/Prioritize -- Similar to the Binsort command in execution,
     this command is used to order a marked or specified range of topics
     from high-to-low or low-to-high priority.  The screen is divided by
     the Priority Barrier, and the marked topics form a selection queue
     below the barrier.  You then move the topic pointer through the queue,
     and press Enter when you are pointing at the highest (or lowest)
     priority item.  The topics so chosen are sent to the list above the
     barrier, ranked in the order they were sent to that list.  This is
     like the procedure used by kids for picking teams for a kickball game
     or other team sport.  When you are done selecting, or when you abort
     using the Esc key, you are returned to Topic Mode, and the order of
     the topics in the current level is reflected by whatever prioritizing
     you did.
 
     This command is most useful for short or medium-sized lists.  Long
     lists are rather cumbersome for this technique, and are better
     prioritized using the Lock command or the Brainstorm/Gather command.
     Where precise prioritizing is not needed, a very useful technique is
     to manually grade/label each topic with its priority rating (say,
     on a scale from 1 to 5, for instance) at the beginning of the topic,
     and then sort the list (this rating can then be easily removed with
     the Brainstorm/Untag command - see below).  Brainstorm/Binsort can be
     used in a similar fashion to categorize topics into bins labeled
     Priority One to Priority Five.
 
BR = Brainstorm/Randomize -- Randomizes the order of a marked or specified
     range of topics.  Great for busting up assumptions and preconceptions.
     Reading down a list after it has been randomized can give you many
     more ideas, because it will expose you to many more relationships as
     you associate each item on the list with the next.  And yes, as you
     observant ref\'s have instantly seen, this command can also be used for
     randomizing encounter tables, or any kind of table, and even for
     rolling dice (to roll multiple dice, randomize an entire distribution
     list).  With this command and a macro, you can rapidly generate as
     many random numbers as you need for character generation or what have
     you.  A similar macro can be used for skill selection.  Note that
     these numbers and selections are not truly random, as they rely on the
     use of a computed or stored "seed" value, but it approximates
     randomness well enough for RPGaming purposes.
 
BS = Brainstorm/Sort -- Sorts a marked or specified range alphabetically
     according to ASCII value or in the standard order used in
     dictionaries.  Sorts in ascending or descending order, as you specify.
     You may also specify the column on the screen which to sort from,
     which makes MaxThink a basic database program on top of everything
     else!  Thus, you can sort your Traveller bibliographies and product
     list by Title, Author, or Publisher; sort your AD&D spells by name,
     level, or type of magic.
 
BT = Brainstorm/Tag -- Places a user defined string (or "fence") at the
     beginning of a topic or each of a range of topics.  The default fence
     is 10 equal signs.  This command works well in combination with the
     Brainstorm/Categorize command above.  It is also useful for creating
     data fields within topics, giving them temporary or permanent labels.
     Once you have labeled everything you need to, the Brainstorm/Sort
     command can by used to order them.
 
BU = Brainstorm/Untag --  Removes a specified number of characters from the
     beginning of a topic or each of a range of topics.  Useful for
     removing fences and labels.

                Creating a Traveller Hypernet
                ----
 
Linkouts are contained in angle brackets <>, and can be placed
anywhere within a topic.  A link-out usually contains a path and
filename <y:likethis.mt>, which can be another outline, or a file
in a different format (usually ASCII).  Angle brackets can also
contain call outs to DOS, to load programs to view files of
specific data formats. For instance, the linkout <dos 123
d:\\trav\\spread\\koors.wks> would load the lotus spreadsheet named
koors.wks from its directory on my hard disk. More useful, would
be call-outs for loading a graphics file viewer, along with the
filename to be viewed -- such call-outs could be quite useful if
placed in the appropriate locations in an adventure write-up, for
instance.
 
MaxThink includes its own file viewer to read non-outline files
specified within angle brackets.  As usual, all it takes to
link-out to view the file is a press of the Right Arrow.
However, MaxThink\'s text file viewer can only view the first 20k
of a file -- the remedy for this is to specify a dos call
to run your favorite file viewer (the one I use is LIST by
Vernon D. Buerg), like this:  <dos list c:\\example\\filename.any>.
Here are some examples of link-outs and call-outs:
 
        <filename.any>   If this is a MaxThink outline, MaxThink will
                         save the current outline and load this one.
 
        <filename.any>   If this is any other kind of file, MaxThink will
                         try to view it with its built-in file viewer.
 
      <y:filename.any>   The use of the y: (or other non-drive letter)
                         assumes you\'ve predefined y: using DOS\'s SUBST
                         command.  This saves having to include the entire
                         path in the link-out, and provides for portibility
                         between DOS systems with various drive
                         configurations.
 
<dos list filename.any>  Use this callout to view a text file greater than
                         20K in size.
 
<dos cshow picture.gif>  Here\'s a callout for viewing graphics files.
 
 
MaxThink has many more menu and key-based commands and other
features that I haven\'t even mentioned yet, but I\'ve been writing
all day, and I\'m about ready to pass out.
 
My Traveller hypernet has grown many times too large for MaxThink
to handle as a single outline, as it measures several megabytes
in size.  Therefore, it includes scores of interlinked outlines.
It also contains link-outs to every bun or text file downloaded
from Sunbane and every text file I\'ve obtained from the HIWG and
other sources.

Note that it would have probably taken me 10 times longer to
organize the information in the example outline above using a
word processor, because of the way I\'ve ordered the information
(in a way most useful to me).  If I had to use a wordprocessor to
it, I probably would not have embarked on the task of organizing
my campaign records in the first place.  Each branch entry in the
outline above includes a linkout to the file that contains the
information for that branch, so getting to any information on
my campaign is quick and easy.  No shuffling through piles
of papers.
 
Having MaxThink would allow you to do the following:  Keep
records on your campaign, organized the way you want.  Make your
own adventures for and custom developments to the game, and keep
all these writings organized in a single structure so that you can
easily find what you need when you need it.  It\'s like having a
road system to access your knowledge, with highways leading to
major areas, and roads branching off leading to the various
pieces of information contained.
 
Your Traveller hypernet could in turn be hooked-into and made
accessible from any number of other hypernets.  For instance, on
my computer, I have an all-encompassing hypernet (which I call my
"Master Outline"), which links to and therefore encompasses
almost everything I\'ve ever written over the past few years,
including a branch designed for Self-Management (to plan,
schedule, and execute projects, programs of activities, and
individual tasks).  It also contains a branch on Business,
another containing my personal Researches, and another for my
favorite hobby (RPG\'s).  Each branch of my Master Outline
branches off, so the whole contains a great many reference areas
and development areas relating to many different subjects
(philosophy, ideas, nutrition, sleep, exercise, property
management, hypertext/hypernet technology, catalogs of utilities,
bibliographies on several subjects, etc., etc., etc).
 
Each branch of a hypernet can be referred to as another hypernet
(or subnet) if it in turn links-out or branches (otherwise it is
just a file of some kind, like an outline or document, but not a
hypernet in and of itself).  My RPG hypernet has a huge branch
dedicated to AD&D, and another even larger branch designed to
support my Traveller campaign and TML activities.
 
One way to visualize a hypernet is hierarchically, like this:

 . y                     |--Self-evaluation
 
Each of the above branches could then branch out, even to each
other.  Extensive interlinking makes the structure more akin to a
network than a hierarchy.  Networks can include circular routes,
star patterns, group-ins, group-outs, and imbedded hierarchies.
 
 
Speaking of hierarchies, Traveller breaks down rather easily into
a hierarchy.  Here is the Traveller branch from the tree above
expanded to show one possible breakdown:

    'subj' => '(cont.) MT and Traveller hypernets',

the sake of continuity):

If all traveller material was organized in this structure, rather
than spread out and mixed together, it would be a breeze to learn
and use.  That\'s where MaxThink comes in.
 
The above diagram took me over 2 hours to construct.  That was
with the hierarchy already in mind -- if I was building this
thing from scratch in this format, modifying the structure during
construction would be a major pain.  And, as you can see, I
rapidly ran out of room for subcategories.  The outline format is
so much easier to work with -- the above classification scheme
could be constructed and in MaxThink in a matter of minutes, and
more completely, with plenty of room to expand.

Roger Sanger speaks of the necessity of Peace in the Regency area:

>Therefore, the Regency, the Zhodani Consolate, the Darrian
>Confederation, the Sword Worlds, and all the governments further
>spinward each have a very high stake in keeping the peace and
>tolerating each others\' presence.

I don\'t know....  Consider the Consulate\'s view once you give them
the goal of disposing of the remainder of the 3rd Imp and their 
willingness to take the longer view:

Continue supporting their Vargr client states (becomes easier once
competion with impies ends with impi demise) provides most of their
clean border that they do not already provide.

They cover a bit more of their own border (hard border with Regency)

They assault Regency (they have SEVERAL SECTORS worth of spare navy
to draw on.

They don\'t have to win - they just have to make the Regency draw off 
enough forces to let the Virus in.  The Virus can do most of the work.

The Zho pull back and seal off their border, and spend 50 years 
changing their technology to include a non-computer pyschic component
(ie Virus proof) to their ship control systems.

They come back after 50 years and easily take over the corpse of the 
Regency, neatly rebuilding the Spinward Marches as Zho societies.

Part of the problem it seems to me about depending on the Vargr is
that the Vargr over the long run do not form stable societies.
The Virus problem will eventually be at the wrong place at the wrong
time during an unstable period and then - bye-bye Vargr state.  On
teh other hand, I\'ll wager that the Vargr are BETTER are rebuilding 
collapsed societies than humans are...  Perhaps contact will come to
the Regency from Vargr merchants moving through Vampiure areas in
Vampire-proof ships...


Roger Sanger asks:

>How far could a well-stocked 5k-ton vessel go without starport
>support?

>How far could a solar-powered ship go without starport support?

Both questions have the same limits:

The vessel will be fine until something important wears out and needs to be replaced.
(engines, avionics components, life support components, water recycling system, maneuver and
jump drives, power systems, airlock seals, reaction mass pumping systems, battery failure, and
several other things that may have a slight chance of failing over time - some of which are detected
and fixed during semi-annual maintenance which won\'t be done w/o starport support).

The crew will be fine until they cannot restock with supplies.
(life support or recycling system failure; lack of planets with terran life; small craft failure stopping
the crew from landing, etc.)

>Couldn\'t such a ship successfully travel across the map and back
>in less than 10 years\' time?
According to GDW\'s spacecraft maintenance requirements, probably not.  Something important
would fail and cause the ship to stop moving before then.

>What would its probability of
>success be (at the beginning of the collapse)?  (Toward the
>beginning of the New Era)?

Worse toward the beginning, I\'d imagine, as you can add the hazards of:

   o  paranoid surviving planets with space defenses still operating
   o  pirates who\'d love another operational ship
   o  Virus vampires
   o  Virus infection

>And what of the MegaCorporations?  Wouldn\'t they want to reclaim
>their companies\' assets?

Only where they have survived.  However, consider that many corps (or pieces of Megacorps) had
assets (factories, facilities, transportation & distribution nets) that may well have been destroyed or
taken over during the Collapse, or had assets on far flung planets that went out of contact when
the Collapse came.  These Megacorps need to survive the Collapse and the Chaos afterward
deprived of the assets that made them Megacorps in the first place.  Most Megacorps are more
likely to survive as deserted corporate skyscraper HQs, with a few ancient managers pushing
meaningless paper from office to office because that\'s what they have always done - since the
collapse.

Doesn\'t mean it cannot happen.  It can even lead to some interesting problems:

Megadodo of Taj Mahal sending mercs to retake a working factory from Megadodo of Bainbridge,
because the Bainbridge office no longer believes that the Taj Mahal office has jurisdiction based on
a memo they received 70 years ago releasing them to reorganize as the local director saw fit...

Amtgeschafft IG demands of the government of Caledonia 70 years in back rent of their electronics
factory which was taken over by the government as an emergency measure 70 years ago - after
the Megacorp pulled its personnel off-planet.

>Imperium?

Short list:

1. Number and type of ships.  The Regency Navy has been evolved to
   keep a sealed border.  These are MUCH different set of ships that
   would be used for planetary and system conquest - not to mention
   the possibility of fighting major fleet battles.

   Further, every time you move your border, you have to guard an
   additional system - meaning more guard ships that must be built,
   crew hired, and supported.  What from?  From anything that may
   be out there - and as you expand your border in 1 direction, you 
   have to guard from 3 directions (every direction but behind).

   Not everyone in the Regency wants all their income sucked into
   taxes to built military spacecraft.

2. Support required.  Each time you send your fleet further and 
   further, you need to support it (meaning more ships used in the
   supply line instead of supporting the economy at home).  Everytime
   you take a planet, you need to maintain the troops you leave on
   it.  Also, once you start taking junked planets, you need to pour 
   in resources to rebuild them.

   Not everyone in the Regency wants all their income sucked into
   taxes to support the military they did not want to buy in the 
   first place nor to support a large chunk of the old 3Imp!

3. Troops required.  Even light occupation forces add up given a lot
   of planets.  These are troops that will be away for longer and 
   longer periods of time as you move further away.  Each trooper is
   someone who cannot help the Regency economy - and needs to be fed,
   clothed, armed, and ammoed from Regency factories.  The more
   planets you occupy simultaneously, the more troops you need.  Oh,
   and regardless of the TL on the assaulted planets, there will 
   probably be some casualties.  As these mount, these assaults will
   lose support.

   Not everyone in the Regency wants to grind their children in 
   Norris\'s war machine.

4. Time.  Pacifying planets takes time.  It does not happen over 
   night.  Regency forces cannot go "Hell for leather" too far before
   the available forces, transport, supplies are all engaged 
   somewhere and are forced to wait for some actions to conclude 
   before continuing.  Not to mention a much longer period of time
   used to digest and support a given planet so that it is not a 
   drain on the Regency.

   Not everyone in the Regency wants to spend their life in service 
   on some wreteched wreck of a planet or in jump space.

To sum up briefly, the Regency cannot afford it.

>It all seems rather pointless!
   
Another reason I did not buy TNE.

I\'ve heard this arguement before and I don\'t buy it.  Certainly *direct*,
participatory democracy, or *demarchy*, isn\'t feasible but that\'s not
most folks\' experience with `democracy\' anyway.  A representative democracy
can deal with a large, interstellar state just as easily as a hereditary
aristocracy.  The difference comes from the roots for *-archy*, which
pertains to the nature of the ruling authority, and *-cracy* which pertains
to the source of that authority.  Admittedly these boundaries are
often confused but the difference between, say, *democracy* and *demarchy*
is that in a democracy the people (demos) *consent* to being ruled while in a
demarchy the people rule directly.  A *monarch* is a single ruler but the
source of that ruler\'s authority is not clear.  In an *autocracy* though
the single ruler\'s authority comes from herself - not the `people\'.

Thus, a democracy might be an *autarchy* with ruling authority invested in
a single ruler.  (Captain Picard is this sort of ruler - he has absolute 
authority but that authority rests upon the consent of his crew - or at
least a majority.)  A democracy might be an *oligarchy* with ruling authority
invested in a group of individuals.  (Modern representative democracies like
the US would fit this category.)  Or a democracy might be a *demarchy* in
which everyone participates in the decision making.  (A typical gaming
group would fit this category.)

In a sense *all* states are `democractic\' - even oppressive ones - because
any large group must enjoy some degree of consent from a majority of group
members in order to function.  Thus, the Soviet Union `collapsed\' when the
leadership no longer enjoyed sufficient consent from the `governed\'.  One
might make a similar arguement for the aristocracy of the Old Imperium and
the Regency.

The key then, I think, when we\'re talking about `democracy\' is the degree
to which the populace has the opportunity to express its `consent\'.  With
a hereditary aristocracy there are no `sanctioned\' methods for the people
to express their lack of consent except through revolution.  In a `republic\'
the people have regular opportunities to express some sort of consent
through voting.  The distinction here might then be between `regulated\'
democracy and `unregulated\' democracy.  An `unregulated\' democracy relies 
upon non-consensual methods of transferring authority (heredity or
abdication say) while regulated democracies have some consensual method
such as elections.

Therefore, a `regulated\', democractic oligarchy or autarchy could just as
effectively govern a large, interstellar state as could the `unregulated\',
democratic oligarchy of the Old Imperium and Regency.

Etc. (Again, a lot is cut.)

Certianly.  All I have to do is patrol the dozen or so worlds within jump
distance of the `source\' world.  Choke points at the refuelling sources make
it easy to stop all but the most concerted efforts.  If I already have such
a plan in place prior to the incident then I can implement this plan as soon as
news arrives at the `authorities\' (possibly expanding my net to include news
from this second `source\' world as well) and long before any sort of group
forms to undertake a `concerted\' effort to counter my plan.  Remember how
the news of Strephon\'s assassination preceded the `official\' news through
discrete government channels?  (That\'s how Norris `became\' Archduke.)  One
wonders in that case if such a plan even existed and yet Norris was successful
at *proclaiming himself* Archduke without news to the contrary *ever* leaking
out!  Norris was an *expert* at this sort of behavior - he owed his very
position as Regent to it.  I\'m convinced that news of the `Rape of Trin\'
served his interests or else it would not be *widely* known.

Let me turn this example on its head.  The CIA professed to be `surprised\'
by the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union and has even taken congressional
heat for being `unprepared\'.  I find it difficult to believe that such was
the actual case - especially in light of the clear incentive for the CIA
and the rest of the Western intelligence community to continue to support
the fiction of the Soviets as a credible adversary.  Remember, `liberals\'
in the West have never expressed the view that the Soviets were *unable*
to threaten the West but rather merely posited that they were *uninterested*
in threatening the West.  *Both* sides, `apparently\', were caught unawares.

Etc.  (Again, a great deal of discussion about the nature of legitimate
claims to the Iridium Throne has been cut.)

Obviously Dulinor *never* `discounted\' the possible claim of the Twin
Princes or he would not have sent his agent Imprey(?) to assassinate them.

Not true.  The Vilani never sought the Throne but instead seceded.  Daibei
never sought the Throne.  And both Lucan *and* Margaret had *legitimate*,
hereditary claims to the Throne.  Lucan`s, and later Margaret\'s, claims
were weakened not by their hereditary legitimacy but by questions about
their character - respectively, Lucan\'s fratricide and Margaret\'s bigotry.
Heirs of either would not share this stain and might make *very* effective
claims upon Norris and his heirs to turn-over their Regency to the legitimate
ruler.

I\'m not suggesting that Norris would want to preserve the Quarantine in order
to avoid such a legitmate claim (although as time passes his heirs might).
But clearly the possibility existed (exists?) for a *seemingly* legitimate
heir to Lucan or Margaret to come forward that still suffered from `hinted\'
questions like their forebearer.  Such a situation is a prescription for 
a *Second* `Rebellion\' and Norris might have wished to avoid such a possiblity
while taking the chance that he might also be forsaking a truly legitimate
heir.

Besides, if this isn\'t the reason the Regency maintains the Quarantine 
what is?

	I don\'t think I agree with you.

1.  In point one you said that the Regency Navy has evolve to using 
different types of ships.  Well supposed that would the RQS job to keep 
the quarantine.  No?  And what the major fleet battles are there to be 
fought.  Most pocket empires (supposedly) will no have squadrons of 
battle riders.  

Every time you move the border, the whole border has the possiblity of 
moving.  If you decide to had another planet that may free up resources 
for a planet behind it, because it no longer jump accessible from the 
wilds.

Who says you any more taxes are needed.  You could reduce the amount of 
forces held in the interior of the Regency.  This one thing I one aspect 
of the 3I that I never understood, why they kept  a incredible amount of 
naval power in the interior of the 3I.  The way I see it is that allowed 
the Rebellion to happen.  

2.  What is an investment?   Essentially you build something for the 
future.  Regency will not have "all" of its income "sucked" into taxes.  
Won\'t the private sector get into this is well.    

About the support required.  That is a longer term investment as well. 
Those supports will build up the infrastructure needed for being larger.
  
3.  Who says anything about occupation forces.  A lot of planets might 
want to join the Regency given the chance.  Yes some planets would 
eventually need to be occupied, but given the Regencies tech level 
advantage, the time to occupation would be limited.  Look at the allied 
powers occupation of Japan and Germany for example.  You defeat the 
country and then leave a small fraction behind.

About the loss of support.  Why?  People will give up support when the 
feel it is no longer a just or worthy cause.  If the Regency performs 
well (no reason to thing that it will not),  why would be people give up 
support.  

Who says that it is war machine and that everyone\'s children would be in 
it.  

4.  Ok.  I already mentioned time issue.  Just look at how long it took 
Japan and Germany to get on their feet.   Take a look at East Germany 
today.  After 3 years it is now on the upward track according to stats 
and given 10 more years will be help out the whole of Germany.  

Your right, the Regency can\'t afford it if every one lives like Americans 
today do.  Saving only 5% of their income and have stupid laws that 
essentially hinder us.  If the Regency saves around 10% of income the it 
can easily afford it.

  Your point is conceded from the viewpoint of _real_ power.  The 
  problem is that of _perceived_ power, and guidance.  The United 
  States, for example, could in fact get along quite well without a 
  President; yet let him get assassinated, and the Vice President 
  will have to take the Oath of Office as soon as possible, to 
  prevent a world-wide panic because "nobody is at the helm" of 
  "the most important nation on Earth".  Similarly with the 
  Imperium or the Regency.  There must be someone at the helm, or 
  the people will lose confidence in the government.  With the 
  Spinward States, I get the impression that it was Norris\'s 
  personal charisma that was what made it possible for the other 
  states to put aside their distrust of each other and work 
  together for mutual survival.  If Norris dies with a 
  "hand-picked" successor, the other states will likely give that 
  successor the benefit of the doubt, and see how well things work 
  out.  In the event that Norris dies without a successor, the more 
  opportunistic factions in the _other_ states may prevail in their 
  counsels, and the Spinward States would then go down together.

  So, why won\'t they hold off long enough for the Regency to hold 
  an election?  Well, maybe they will.  But what happens if the 
  first round of balloting (which must take _months_) doesn\'t 
  produce a clear choice?  How long are the other states going to 
  wait for a clear choice in the Regency?  These are questions that 
  must be considered.  Remember that both the Vargr and the Aslan 
  took advantage of a perceived weakness in the Imperium when there 
  was no clear choice.  Why should they refrain again?  In the case 
  of the Domain of Deneb, a local charismatic leader was able to 
  stabilize the situation.  But there is no similar leader waiting 
  to step in if Norris is removed from the picture.  Thus, Norris, 
  even more than the previous Emperors, _must_ have a heir 
  apparent.  Such a person need not be related by blood.  But the 
  provision must be there for _that_person_ to take over on zero 
  notice.

TS::>The discussion about the legitimacy of the Regent\'s claim to the throne
  ::>is beginning to resemble Imperial Law 101.  Putting on my Machiavellian
  ::>hat, I\'d propose that all this stuff about legitimacy doesn\'t matter one

  Conceded, again.  But it takes _one_ person to provide that 
  inspirational leadership that makes it possible for the empire to 
  assert that legitimacy and have the people go along with it.  
  Even that might not be enough; we don\'t know how bloody the 
  "Pacification Wars" really were.  But the perceived image of 
  legitimacy, and a charismatic leader, almost certainly helped.

TS::>Another example: the Right of Succession by Assassination seems to me to

  Actually, the RoA was created by the Moot to rid themselves of a 
  dangerous lunatic who had achieved the throne by normal and legal 
  succession.  They didn\'t know he was a lunatic when the 
  legitimized him.  They hired a fleet admiral to bump him off.  
  The payment was the Iridium Throne itself.

TS::>Quite why Norris has continued to call himself Regent for the 70 years

  Well, Strephon didn\'t really make Norris the heir to the throne.  
  He made it clear that Norris was the only one left to carry on 
  the traditions, but as far as Norris\'s rank goes, he was only 
  confirmed in his self-assumed title of Archduke of the Domain of 
  Deneb.  It was basically when the Collapse came that the Domain 
  sealed its borders, and basically proclaimed to its people that 
  it was the Regency for the Imperium that Was.  After that, it was 
  just common usage that got "out of hand".

Actually, the Zhodani have no real motivation to smash the Regency,
and a lot of good reasons not to, for now.  

>They assault Regency (they have SEVERAL SECTORS worth of spare navy

Which they weren\'t willing to use during the Fifth Frontier War, and
they probably won\'t want to use now.  Also, consider that the
Zhodani are probably using spare fleets not attached to the Core
Expedition and other pursuits to help their Vargr client-states
maintain the quarantine coreward of Windhorn.

>
>The Zho pull back and seal off their border, and spend 50 years

>(ie Virus proof) to their ship control systems.

Except that they won\'t have the Regency doing part of the job for
them anymore, they\'ll lose a lot of their own ships needed for the
quarantine in the process, and they\'ll lose the Windhorn-Great Rift
choke point in Corridor that has made holding Virus off for this
long feasible.  And they\'ll lose every other ally they ever had in
the region, forever.

>They come back after 50 years and easily take over the corpse of the 
>Regency, neatly rebuilding the Spinward Marches as Zho societies.

Why just the corpse?  If the Zhodani stay on good terms, there is
a good chance that as long as the current situation holds, the
Regency will side more and more closely with them.  They\'ve already
begun to accept psionics -- this, in the Marches!  They\'ve begun to
implement democratic reforms which are even more far reaching than
Zhodani democracy.  There\'s probably a faction in the Zhodani
government that figures if things keep going their way, they might
be able to *civilize* the Regency without any more bloodshed!
(From a Zhodani point of view, of course!)  

After all, the Zhodani Consulate is now humaniti\'s biggest living
government, and the Regency is the second largest.  If they can
be converted to an ally or client-state of Zhdant, the advantages
are enormous.  And there is only the memory of the Imperium left
(for now) as an alternative.

(Of course the various Vargr and Aslan New Lords are still around,
 but the Regency does seem to be becoming more and more influenced
 by Zhdant.  It\'s small now, but it doesn\'t have to stay that way.)

The KFC has found a deadly challenge!  The planet of
G\'ekuwadlewix!-wugga-wugga (B8669RK-D in the K\'trekreer Sector) is
a K\'kree planet held by the old intolerant regime of the
unenlightened T\'t\'tkahk Xeng Kirr (2000 worlds).  They have not yet
built an operative jump drive, but they have managed to keep a
force of in SDBs that have succeeded in holding the swarms of
vampire fleets at bay.  It is a prime planet of 4 billion K\'kree.
The KFC would dearly love to get their hooves on
G\'ekuwadlewix!-wugga-wugga.

However, the evil decadent TES (Technologically Elevated
Steppelord) has rebuffed the KFC\'s attempts to convert them from
their old fashioned ways.  Therefore, they must die.

But, G\'ekuwadlewix!-wugga-wugga is too well defended for a simple
SAS (Smash and Smash) mission.  Nuking the planet from orbit is not
an option.

The KFC mission planners have devised a coup that should allow the
KFC to take over G\'ekuwadlewix!-wugga-wugga with deadly simplicity.
By dropping an asteroid on the main population center, it would
utterly swamp the planetary forces.  The bombardment will be seen
as an opportunity for the hovering vampire fleets.  The KFC fleet
would arrive to provide aide and assistance including some large
KFC dreadnoughts (The KFC Super Buckets).

Once in position, the KFC would insert itself into the positions of
power and gradually take over.  Once in power, they can safely
convert any survivors of the bombardment.

The asteroid is to be targeted on the main population center, which
is far from the industrial centers.  (Precaution from the days when
the Virus ran rampant on G\'ekuwadlewix!-wugga-wugga.)  This is
fortunate as the asteroid will cause a maximum of chaos in the herd
without losing too much of the high tech industrial power that the
KFC so desperately needs to carry their mission out across the
entire T\'t\'tkahk Xeng Kirr (2000 worlds).  Also the grief of the
loss will make the survivors more willing to look up to their brave
\'saviors\' and so conversion from their evil ways will be
facilitated.

The job of the players?
The players are the crew of the Xing\'t\'t!.  An old K\'kree
Xeekr\'kir! class merchant ship, renovated by the KFC.  In the hold
is the 100 tons of the fusion powered mass driver that will drive
the asteroid across the system to G\'ekuwadlewix!-wugga-wugga.  The
crew must transport the drive to the system\'s asteroid belt, power
it up, and set it on course, all the while avoiding all detection
by the G\'ekuwadlewix!-wugga-wuggan defenses.

The unloading of the drive will be a difficult operation.  To do
so, the crew must set it out in (gasp) vacc suits!  It will require
3 weeks of work in hard vacuum.  The isolation and close quarters
inside the suits, even with the open area of the ship for relief,
will be quite a strain on the pastoral K\'kree.

Once the drive is set up, the crew of the Xing\'t\'t! must make a
microjump to G\'ekuwadlewix!-wugga-wugga.  There they must pick up
their agents who have laid the ground work for the conversion of
the planet.  G\'ekuwadlewix!-wugga-wuggans are suspicious of the KFC
crews, but, since they are K\'kree, they are not overly aggressive
toward them.  Refs:  treat encounters with the militia as law level
9.  This will give them an excellent opportunity to view the fine
planet they have just marked for demolition.

What a pity these barbarians are such racists.  It\'s a good thing
we\'re here to save them.

72:8/7304 K\'kree in TNE

TS::>KFC:  The K\'kreer Freedom Coalition.

  Stop reaching!  I refuse to allow bad puns to become part of the 
  background of my universe! :)

TS::>Some folks have asked what the K\'kree might be up to in The New
  ::>Era.  Here\'s my idea.  I don\'t own Path of Tears, so I don\'t know
  ::>the RC time line very well, but this\'ll get the idea across in a
  ::>nutshell.

TS::>The Hive Confederation fell to the Virus in the 1130s.  The K\'Kree
  ::>2000 worlds fell soon afterward, but their destruction was more
  ::>swift.  The Hivers were more capable of resistence against the
  ::>Virus than the less electronically adept K\'Kree.

  So far, I agree with you.  The destruction of the 2KW would have 
  _had_ to be as swift as (or swifter than - see later) that of the 
  Imperium, Confederation, and Hierate, and the Trailing Extents.  
  Remember, the Deyo-based transponder was in virtually universal 
  use by the time Virus was born.  The Hivers weren\'t really less 
  susceptible, though; they were just able to identify and take 
  countermeasures faster due to their advanced computer knowledge.  
  Even today, in 1201/NE1, they\'re still cleaning up the damage.  
  But the important thing was that they were able to maintain 
  continuity of culture and of communication.

TS::>K\'Kree electronics and robotics was far behind the Hivers and The
  ::>Imperium.  At their height, the best K\'Kree robots were TL13.
  ::>Oddly, their starships were totally dependent on robotics.  All
  ::>K\'Kree ships had robotic engineering crews just ripe for the Virus.
  ::>As such, the TL 16 Virus swept through the TL 13 K\'Kree fleets like
  ::>wildfire.

  When you look at the design of K\'kree starships, and the psych 
  profile of most K\'kree, it\'s not so odd.  It\'s fairly easy for 
  even a human to get claustrophobic in an area where there\'s a lot 
  of machinery, and space is a consideration.  And it certainly 
  would make their systems highly susceptible to Virus.  Possibly 
  more susceptible than the other empires.

TS::>Further, as the 2000 Worlds of the K\'Kree empire were farther from
  ::>the site of release of the Virus, a greater proportion of the more
  ::>advanced breeds of the Virus struck the K\'Kree.  Also, as the
  ::>K\'Kree ships did have robotic engineers, the K\'Kree vampire ships
  ::>are now in far better shape than the vampires than Imperial ships
  ::>where robots were more rare and so have less access to
  ::>maintainence.  (Just where have all the Imperial Vampires gotten
  ::>their annual maintenance done for the last 70 years?)

TS::>The K\'Kree worlds are full of Vampire fleets.  It is an incredibly
  ::>dangerous place to go.

  Yes, I can easily go along with this.  I\'d suspect that there was 
  comparatively _less_ actual destruction in the 2KW than in any of 
  the other empires, because the various strains of Virus have had 
  the time to learn how to be more survival-oriented.  (Assuming 
  that you accept an unwritten premise in your argument.  I 
  address this later.)  The questions that come up here are:  

  (1) How fast did Virus really spread?  

  The XBoat network in the Imperium was an essentially zero-layover 
  system with an average point-to-point distance of between J2 and 
  J3.  Thus, we can suggest that within the Imperium, the spread 
  speed was J2.5/week.  Outside the Imperium, the jump rate would 
  be lower, as there was no continuous zero-layover network in 
  place, and "tramp traffic" density would likely be lower, as the 
  economies of the minor states in the area would likely not be 
  able to support the level of trade that the Imperium could.  
  Assume, for argument, that this reduces spread to J2/week at 
  best; we could probably cut that a little bit, and say that it 
  will cross three sectors (spin to trail) in one year.  Thus, from 
  the release in 1129, we can estimate that Virus made it to the 
  2KW by 1131 or 1132 at the absolute latest.

  (2) How fast did Virus evolve?  

  This question we have no useful data on.  If evolution was fast 
  enough, then the characterization above is accurate.  However, if 
  it took five years for the first strains of "survive as long as 
  possible while infecting others with quick suicide strains" to 
  appear, then the destruction of the K\'kree worlds will be as 
  widespread and as serious as the destruction of the Imperium.

TS::>The main worlds are in ruins.  However, K\'Kree claustrophobia paid
  ::>off handsomely for the Militant Vegitarian Centaurs.  Nearly all of
  ::>their high population worlds were habitable without special life
  ::>support.  Few K\'Kree would settle on a world were they could not
  ::>roam freely on the plains.  Indeed, any K\'Kree who did settle in
  ::>shelters on inhospitable worlds was looked at as something of a
  ::>weirdo.  Many of these worlds have survived despite the Vampire
  ::>ships raging overhead.  Their technology has been blasted back to
  ::>the stone age in most cases, however, K\'Kree with their out doors
  ::>culture and vegitarian appetites are in some ways better suited for
  ::>this than other species.

  Yes, I\'ll buy this.  Also, as K\'kree did not build as densely as 
  other races did, the damage in terms of lives lost was probably 
  lower among the K\'kree than among other races.  Even if the 
  material damage was as high or higher.

TS::>Still, this was the chance their ancient enemies had been waiting
  ::>for for centuries.

TS::>The Hivers, when they recovered from their fall, saw their chance.
  ::>The K\'Kree are now utterly powerless.  Immediately, the Hivers
  ::>dusted off their old manipulation-invasion plans, and took aim at
  ::>the K\'Kree culture!

  I have a problem with this.  The Hivers only created this plan as 
  a response to K\'kree aggression.  Militarily, the Hive Federation 
  was taking a beating; this is why they resorted to the 
  psychological warfare of manipulating the K\'kree culture.  Once 
  the K\'kree realized that they valued their cultural uniformity 
  more than they valued their mission of spreading vegetarianism 
  through the cosmos, they backed off.  That\'s why the Hivers never 
  actually put their full-scale plan into effect.  Even given the 
  opportunity, I don\'t see that the Hivers would necessarily feel a 
  need to do anything about the K\'kree.  This, of course, could 
  change down the road.

TS::>Traveller Historians may recall the first Hiver-K\'Kree war.  The
  ::>aggressive and militarily superior K\'Kree backed off when the
  ::>Hivers unveiled their secret manipulations of a few of their
  ::>worlds.  Hiver Master Manipulators had socially engineered events
  ::>to make a few K\'Kree planets turn away from the monolithic backbone
  ::>of K\'Kree culture.  K\'Kree were actually using *MEAT* to sauce
  ::>their vegitables!  K\'Kree were going into isolation for
  ::>*RECREATION*.  These abominations against the K\'Kree frightened
  ::>them so that they immediately sued for peace when the Hivers
  ::>threatened to launch their manipulation across the whole of the
  ::>K\'Kree 2000 worlds!  The K\'Kree quietly nuked some of their own
  ::>planets to stop the abomination.

  Yes.  This is what I was referring to above.  The Hivers have no 
  _need_ to be proactive; they already have the best defense that 
  they can against the K\'kree.

TS::>The Hivers have now contacted a few K\'Kree worlds and have
  ::>manipulated their culture to conform with the ideals of the old
  ::>Hiver Confederation.  However, you don\'t turn a species of fanatics
  ::>onto tolerence of other life in just a few years.  These K\'Kree are
  ::>the missionaries of the Hivers to the rest of their race.  Just as
  ::>they have in the Imperium, the Hivers have given the K\'Kree the
  ::>technology and mission to clean up their entire region of space.
  ::>They have formed the KFC:  K\'Kreer Freedom Coalition.

  I told you: you may not make bad puns! :)

TS::>You thought RCES was bad with their Smash And Grab tactics?  The
  ::>KFC\'s forces are happy to wipe out any K\'Kree not of their herd who
  ::>might stand in their way.  You want ground combat "Star Vikings"?
  ::>It\'s much easier to nuke a planet and clean it up with a nuclear
  ::>damper than it is to land troops anyway...

  Remember that the other "unreconstructed" K\'kree will see these 
  K\'kree as aberrant/perverted.  Any fights would likely be to the 
  death of every last K\'kree on one side or the other, civilians 
  and foals not excepted.  This is not what I would consider ideal 
  territory for "missionary" work.  The only way I see this helping 
  the Hivers is that it keeps the K\'kree busy with their own 
  internal battles, thus they are not causing trouble for their 
  neighbors.  But I don\'t see the Hivers forming an RC-like 
  alliance with any K\'kree.

TS::>Why?  The other K\'Kree are intolerant!  They have no regard for the
  ::>lives of aliens and other sentient life.  Thus, they must be
  ::>converted or destroyed.  [RL note:  You may at some point in your
  ::>life have met up with some of the "Good" skinheads?  The ones who
  ::>beat up the "Bad" skinheads?  And the graffiti they spray over cars
  ::>is stuff like "JUST SAY NO!" or "BE KIND: REWIND!"  Perhaps you\'ve
  ::>met the people who attack anyone if they aren\'t perfectly PC?  The
  ::>ones who think all the white males in the world should be lynched?
  ::>Picture those guys armed with Grav Tanks, Fusion Guns, Nukes and a
  ::>mission from GOD!]

  As above, strike "converted or".  K\'kree are not likely to 
  convert.  Especially when the evangelists are perverts.

TS::>No, the KFC does not eat meat.  (Not usually anyway, as it\'s not
  ::>very good for a K\'Kree\'s digestion)  And no, they don\'t *usually*
  ::>enjoy isolation.  Psychologically, they are just about the same as
  ::>they always were, but they are on a different mission now!

  But the mentality that would allow for this kind of mission is 
  itself a sign of major perversion!  Remember that no K\'kree, 
  anywhere, has a loyalty to other than the Steppelord of the 2KW, 
  through the normal chain of command.  Since all K\'kree have this 
  loyalty, it is unthinkable to fight against other K\'kree unless 
  they are diseased (perverts).  And since one does not voluntarily 
  become a pervert, it is useless to try to convince a pervert to 
  drop their perversion.  They are therefore not fit to survive, 
  and must be destroyed, to prevent the spread of the infection.

72:8/7305 Space Colonies; OSA; Regency

TS::>About the current (1201) First Regent: it\'s probably Seldrian.  We

  I could actually see Norris handing it over to Branj, his 
  seneschal.  Remember, Branj was psionic, and would have known 
  intimately what Norris wanted to accomplish as Regent and with 
  the Regency; he also would be intimately acquainted with Norris\'s 
  methods.  He\'d be the ideal choice.  If it was impractical for 
  political reasons, I\'d go second with Seldrian, with an 
  admonishment from Norris to "listen well to Branj; I have always 
  found his advice valuable."

  ::>know Avery Aledon has a ministerial/cabinet-level post.  We know
  ::>the First Regent\'s position is hereditary in the same way noble
  ::>titles are hereditary.  (I.e., heirs can be chosen by the title holder.)
  ::>Avery is most probably Seldrian\'s direct heir if she adopted him
  ::>after _Arrival Vengeance_.  And the players\' ages in 1201:
  ::>  Strephon Alkhalikoi   born 1049, in 1201 aged 152. (likely dead)

  Not necessarily.  If the Alkhalikoi line had a lot of Vilani 
  blood in it, he could still be alive, as lifespans of 200 
  standard years are not surprising among the pure Vilani.

  ::>  Norris Aledon         born 1063, in 1201 aged 138. (probably dead)

  Ditto, though I would tend to agree with you here.  Somehow, the 
  drawings of Strephon had him looking "more Vilani" than the (IMO) 
  very definitely ethnically Solomani Norris.

  ::>  Seldrian Aledon       born 1097, in 1201 aged 104.
  ::>  Avery Aledon          born 1118, in 1201 aged 83.

TS::>Regency buffs may be interested to note that according to an old TNS
  ::>news brief I saw again the other day, "the Duke of Regina\'s seneschal",
  ::>i.e. the now-famed Branj Dilgaadin, announced the beginning of the
  ::>Fifth Frontier War to the Marches in 1107, not Norris himself!

72:8/7306 Why Regency v. Imperium

TS::>It\'s actually a pretty responsible step.  As regent, Norris or Seldrian
  ::>can\'t assume the office of Emperor without approval of a quorum of the
  ::>Imperial Moot, Lucan notwithstanding.  Somehow I doubt that the nobles
  ::>left in the Regency constitute a quorum of votes.  Now, conceivably
  ::>this could be circumvented by declaring that the Regency is all that is
  ::>left of the Imperium (but this is a questionable call, at best).  The
  ::>only other option is for the Regency to technically secede, which it
  ::>never did during the Rebellion, unlike Daibei, Vland, and Antares.

  Yes, this fits in nicely with my own theory.  In fact, it appears 
  to be just another perspective on it.

TS::>Furthermore, by maintaining the fiction of an imperial regency, the
  ::>Regency asserts the continued existence of the Imperium.  It\'s a
  ::>hedge against the future.  The Regency seems to be protecting the
  ::>legal rights of the worlds in the Wilds to be in the Imperium, if
  ::>anyone still wants to be in one with Deneb.  Otherwise, the possible
  ::>lack of any government claiming to be the "Third Imperium" could
  ::>cause problems with the other old governments moving in on the
  ::>ungoverned territory.  It\'s a legal fiction.  Undoubtedly, once
  ::>the Regency is able to recontact the other worlds of the old
  ::>Imperium and assess the situation, a more permanent decision can
  ::>be made.  (In a sense, the Regency is in a semi-permanent state of
  ::>"crisis management" until then.)

  Again, this fits in with my discussion on the legitimacy of the 
  Regency.  You carry it farther into the future, and in a 
  slightly different direction, but it\'s scary to see someone read 
  your mind so accurately! :)

TS::>Of course, none of this stops anyone from doing anything out there
  ::>in the Wilds.  The Regency is only betting that someday, someone
  ::>might set up a bargaining table, maybe even they themselves, and
  ::>they know they\'ll want to be in a good bargaining position at that
  ::>table.  After all, there\'s no doubt that someone will have to
  ::>negotiate with a lot of *very* angry neighbors about this whole
  ::>Virus business....

  ...but how much of that anger will be along the lines of "Of 
  course we were researching it!  But you don\'t think we would have 
  actually _released_ it, do you!?"?

    'body' => 'Ray Pullar writes in message 7297 about orbital colonies in response to
another writers comments about refueling stations to bridge empty sectors.
 
Before I go on about orbital colonies I would like to mention that the Aslan
bridged the rift using similar methods. It is briefly mentioned in the GDW
Aslan alien supplement.  Basically what they did was to drop off a fuel
bladder halfway. Jump back to get another, then jump back to the one they
dropped off.  Then they would refuel from the bladder allowing a jump-3 ship
to bridge a jump-6 gap.
 
As for orbital colonies, I have a fasination with them so I am attempting to
design an O\'neill colony using traveller FF&S rules.  For reasons Ray
mentioned (cheap anti-grav) colonies would only be viable at lower (TL8 - 10)
tech levels.  I\'m using TL10 as a cut off because since you have this TL8
monster in orbit you might as well use it and upgrade parts of it.  
 
Using the statistical functions in my HP-48 I have extrapolated the ship hull
tables to attempt to get realistic Traveller numbers for the hull.  Figuring
Light alloys would be the easiest material to use in terms of economics (mass
drivers sending lunar materials to orbit or asteroid mining) I have come up
with a 6.46E10 hull rating that encloses 9.044E11 cubic meters or in simpler
terms the hull is a cylinder 6km in diameter and 32km long.  It has a hull
thickness of 50cm giving an armor rating of 85. O\'neill\'s figures state that
based on medical observations of astronauts on the Apollo missions, 50cm of
rock will adequately protect a human for a 30 year stay in open space.  Low
earth orbit studies don\'t work because the crew is still protected by the
Earth\'s magnetic field.  I also gave the hull an internal structure good for
8G\'s of acceleration in an effort to allow for the stresses the hull will see
due to the use of station keeping thrusters plus the rotation of the colony.
The mass in metric tons so far is 1.4e9 tonnes for the hull and 1.35e8 tonnes
for the internal structure. Price so far is 3.5e6 MCr.
 
I also intend to add an average of 10 meters of rock and dirt to the station
for landscaping purposes.  This mass has not been accounted for yet.  Other
systems like solar power, nuclear fission (to be added as a backup at TL9),
fuel storage and docking bays have not been figured in yet. The mirrors to
reflect sunlight into the station have also not be added yet. I did figure out
the normal extended life support for a smaller station and that required at
least 50 GW of power to operate (hence the need for fusion).
 
I intend to post my final design when completed (It\'ll take a while yet <g>).
So comments at this time are welcome.  As a last note, A colony of this size
can support at least 2 million inhabitants.  Extended life support is not
necessary since the colony does have a working ecosystem.  The fusion power
option may be useful for a colony out in our asteroid belt where the sun will
probably be too weak to support a natural ecosystem. And finally, O\'neill
states that the maximum size of a colony using current (1970\'s-80\'s) tech and
Light alloy / Iron materials is 15miles in dia and 75 miles long.
 
Given the interlocked structure of the Imperium there really was no drive for
any planet to go through the expense of constructing colonies such as these.
But here in the new era, or in your own campaign, I can see colonies present
in lower TL systems as those systems develop their own path to the stars. 
 
One other component is needed to build large colonies, and that is a smaller
factory colony (not larger than Babalon 5) to build the components for the
large colonies.
 
Such colonies would also be virus resistant (in my mind) due to the low TL
present.  The colony doesn\'t really need a large networked computer.  Once
it\'s in a stable orbit and is spinning it stays that way.  I\'m sure a small
computer (to small to host a fully sentient AI) is all that is necessary to
provide the station keeping and rotational corrections needed.  The main
reason Starship computers are so complex (as I understand it) is because of
the complex nature of the Jump calculations and the extreme precision needed
to energize the jump coils (See the Starship Operators Manual from DGP)
 
Any feedback? Comments?

sectors do not seem to have anything like this many.

For example, from Travellers Digest:
Trojan Reach 9   (14 subsectors worth of systems)
Ealiyasiyw 22    (16)
Deneb 10         (13)
Riftspan Reaches 5 (108 worlds)
Reft 4           (4 or 5 subsectors worth)

From Knightfall:
Massilia 10 (16 subsectors)

Other official:
Diaspora 28 worlds
Hinterworlds 21
Vland 13
Spinward Marches 13

The numbers are rough (counted by eye) but should be near enough for this 
purpose.  Does anyone know if this is deliberate?  If so, why?  Or was it 
an accident or a bug in a generation program?

Officially, they don\'t work that way, although some of the early CT
material seems to imply that you must end at a star system.  I find
it useful from several angles to force jumps to only be to large
celestial bodies:

o It prevents certain "abuses", such as creating a jump-1 ship
  that\'s 95% jump fuel (in drop tanks for you purists) and can
  jump 30 times without refueling.  I guess such a ship would be
  useful for exploration purposes, but this blows a hole in the
  effectiveness of the Great Rift as a barrier to travel (early
  CT definitely suggested that you could not jump further than
  jump-6 without refueling).  Allowing jumps only to celestial
  bodies does not eliminate such ships, but only allows them to
  operate along J-1 routes.  Without this restriction, the Virus
  would be much harder to stop (and the Regency\'s blockade would
  be futile, but I don\'t want to get into that discussion).

o It explains why misjumped ships always end up in star systems
  (at least according to the rules I have, which don\'t include
  TNE).

o It helps to explain the 100-diameter limit.  The presence of
  the 100-diameter limit means that gravity wells play a part in
  jump mechanics.  Technology will eventually determine what the
  effect is and attempt to exploit it.  Since 100 diameters seems
  to be a constant, it makes more sense to determine the effect
  from the start and use it to explain jump mechanics.

o It eliminates certain "free energy" scenarios by microjumping
  away from a star or planet then gaining more kinetic energy
  than total energy you put into the jump (note microjumps would
  only be to celestial bodies also).  This "free energy" problem
  is often misunderstood: thrusters were fine, they just used
  too little energy for the kinetic energy they imparted.

o It can be used as a hand-waving aid to improve "feasibility"
  of jump drives.  If you accept that in some dimension space is
  curved by gravity, then jump drives might make use of this by
  exiting normal space and heading along an "equipotential line"
  towards another star or planet.  The 100-diameter limit would
  then represent a compromise, which is close enough to the
  celestial body to make use of this effect, but far enough away
  to insure that you don\'t crash at the destination (energy loss
  during the jump could cause you to arrive closer to the star
  or planet).  The distance also makes it easier to target the
  destination.  Notice that this interpretation does not preclude
  precision jumps, which can be within the 100-diameter limit.
  If you really want to prevent jumps to or from within that
  limit, do some hand-waving about "second or third order effects
  of the gravitational potential well" (this can also be used as
  an explanation to allow jumps to a planet\'s 100-diameter limit
  even if it is inside of a star\'s 100-diameter limit).

o This interpretation does not preclude jumps to interstellar
  space, just makes them very difficult and more dangerous.
  The two ways to do it are to start your jump from well beyond
  the 100-diameter limit (in which case even gravity wells as
  small as large ships could pull you back to normal space, but
  targetting would be VERY difficult) or to expend extra energy
  during the jump to bring the ship up to a "zero gravitic
  potential" and into normal space (probably the way they would
  get those extremely rare refueling stations out there).

o An interpretation of jump mechanics can by itself open new
  adventure possibilities, or can be used as a lead-in to a new
  adventure ("You come out of jump and see--blackness, an utter
  void of blackness" as the ship emerges in the center of a
  dark cloud that only a few pirates knew about, until now).

o As far as "discharging energy" is concerned--that never was
  a part of Traveller.  That was a hack to let the 2300AD 
  universe have a "Traveller" feel rather than a "Star Trek"
  feel while still using stutterwarp drives.

Also seen: Smash and Grab. The scenerio book for Star Vikings.  Looks

in PoT.  Some more RCES hardware is shown.  I only thumbed through it, but it
looks like it\'s worth it.  My only problem was the $18 price tags on the front
while $14 is printed on the back of the book.  So of course I pointed out the

Well, I dumped them into the "top-level" /donations file, where nobody

I have no idea if that\'s where they should have gone, or even if anyone

Here\'s a first take at the Regency sourcebook I mentioned back in TML msg
574/7200:

REGENCY TIMELINE

I don\'t have TNE so I\'m not going to be able to help much but here\'s
a template to get us to TNE.

1121-1130 (Hard Times)
1131-1140
1141-1150
1151-1160
1161-1170
1171-1180
1181-1190
1191-1200

Significant dates would seem to be needed for the following:

Declaration of the Regency
Establishment of the Quarantine
The `Rape of Trin\' (Gram?)
Death of Norris(?)
Openings to the Zhodani(?)
Others?

THE QUARANTINE LINE

Details about the establishment of the Quarantine.  What\'s the rational for
it?  How was it initially established?  What challenges faced the Regency as
it was being established?  What is the actual line (which worlds)?

SUBSECTOR MAPS AND UWP DATA

Which subsectors?  Is the capital still at Mora in Mora(?) Subsector?  What are
the other major subsectors of the Regency?  Regina?  Rhylanor?  Deneb?  Let\'s
follow the *Path of Tears* format with Imperial Era (IE) and Post-Imperial
Era (PIE) UWP stats.

MAJOR WORLDS OF THE REGENCY

Brief descriptions of Mora, Regina, Vincennes, Glisten, Lunion.  What others?

REGENCY GOVERNMENT

Using the *World Builders\' Handbook* model, executive authority is obviously
held by a `ruler\' - the Regent.  What about legislative authority?  Under
the Imperium this was also held by the `ruler\' - the Emperor.  The suggestions
of greater `democracy\' in the Regency might be apparent here.  In a mulit-
body legislature (Moot?) the aristocracy would certainly still have a voice
so let\'s call the upper house the `Chamber of Nobles\'.  A second body might
be the `Chamber of Delegates\' that is composed of representatives from
individual worlds (probably with representation weighted by population - one
doubts Pop 1 worlds will have the same say as Pop A worlds, especially since
the Chamber of Nobles will already reflect this bias).  Might there be a
third (or fourth?) house?  Generally, legislative authority in the Regency
would be classed as `several councils\' in *WBH* terms.

While primary authority will be executive (the Regent), secondary judicial
authority might also exist to complement the secondary legislative authority.
Again, under the Imperial system judicial authority was held by the single
ruler and `delegated\' down through the aristocracy.  My sense is that the
Regents will still maintain judicial authority similar to the Imperial model.

Therefore, in *WBH* lingo the Regency has a primary executive/judicial ruler
with several secondary legislative councils.

*POT* apparently has a table of all RC worlds, their populations, political
bloc and number of representatives.  Anyone care to post a list of Regency
worlds with populations (maybe Roger\'s hypertext can help here?) and we can
work on representatives from there?

REGENCY POLITICS

These political blocs have been suggested:

Isolationists want to maintain the Quarantine.
Expansionists want to move out into the Wilds.
Democrats seek to expand `democratic\' values.
Aristocrats want to maintain the noble aristocracy.
Tolerants favor a relaxation of psi prejudices.
Santanocheevists oppose any moves toward accommodation with the Zhodani.
Imperialists still hope to one day resurrect the Old Imperium.
Autnomists favor independence and a complete break from the Imperial past.

Here\'s an `alliance\' template:

     Iso  Exp  Dem  Ari  Tol  San  Imp  Aut
Iso   -    x    ?    ?    ?    o    x    o
Exp   x    -    ?    ?    ?    o    o    o
Dem   ?    ?    -    x    o    ?    x    ?
Ari   ?    ?    x    -    ?    ?    o    ?
Tol   ?    ?    o    ?    -    x    x    ?
San   o    o    ?    ?    x    -    o    ?
Imp   x    o    x    o    x    o    -    x
Aut   o    o    ?    ?    ?    ?    x    -

codes: o = favorable, x = opposed

What is the nature of the Regency government?  Someone mentioned that Avery
from *AV* serves as a cabinet minister(?) to Seldrian (the Regent) which
suggests some sort of ministerial portfolios (cabinet posts for Americans).
What is the nature of the relationship between the Regency Moot and the 
Regent?  Does the Moot have any `real\' power?  What about the relationship
between the Chambers of the Moot?  How are members of the Chamber of
Delegates chosen?  Is this decided by each individual world or are there
`common\' standards throughout the Regency?  If there is some sort of voting,
who gets to vote?  Everyone?  Adults only?  Literate adults?  Propertied
adults?  How long after I move from Junidy to Strouden can I vote there?

Remember that even a system where *only* the Chamber of Nobles has some sort
of `limited\' veto power over the Regent is one that is more `democratic\' than
was the Old Imperium.

REGENCY LANGUAGE

Anyone care to offer a few examples of Riftian jargon after 70 years of
divergence from Galanglic?

QUARANTINE SERVICE AND REGENCY PATROL

Again, without TNE I can\'t do much here.  Has the old DSS really become the
Quarantine Service?

REGENCY NAVY AND ARMY

This would seem to follow pretty much the Imperial model although there
looks like there might be a good debate taking off on this issue now.

QUARANTINE AREA OF OPERATIONS

What\'s the mission of the Quarantine Service?  Can anyone produce a map
of the entire Quarantine Line?  Are there any places were the Quarantine Line
has recently been expanded?  To follow the *POT* template we ought to provide
maps and UWP data for such worlds.

REGENCY MEGACORPS

This seems to be the equivalent of the *POT* material on the Star Guild.
Do all the megacorps still exist in the Regency?  What have they been up
to in the last 70 years.  Ideally, *all* major operations for each megacorp
throughout the Regency should be identified.  Where do the megacorps come
down among the various political blocs?

*****

There you have it - an excellent starting point for development.  Let me
suggest the following guideline.  If you want to develop a particular aspect
of the Regency - say, Ling-Standard Products operations or Santanocheevist
political goals and strategies - just post a message stating your intent.
First come, first serve.  If someone else comes along with similar interests
we\'ll just steer them toward the other person and you can collaborate.  Keep
us informed of what you\'re doing.  I would prefer to see most `work\' done
on the TML so we all can contibute our cr0.02\'s worth.  :-)

This would seem to me to be a good place for development.  What are the
nature of Regency naval forces?  Rather than focusing on the details of
ship design let\'s concentrate on tactics, strategy and design philosophies.
Both Ted7(?) and Alex have raised some good points about these issues.
Let\'s start exploring them.

The idea of a Zhodani-Regency alliance is intriguing.  (If the Federation
and the Klingons can do it in 80-some years why not the Zhos and the
Denebians?)  Scott Kellog has been posting some *very* original stuff on the
K\'kree.  Maybe we could do something similar for the Zhodani and *finally*
flesh them out into `real\' human beings.  Except for the Imperial psionic
bias that we all bought into back in the heydays of the 5FW, can anyone
come up with a good reason not to see the Zhodani in a postive light?

Certainly Norris anticipated this point and has made arrangements for his
successor.  While I suspect this is (will be?) Seldrian what\'s to stop
Norris (or his successors) from holding an election for the successor
*prior* to the demise of the current Regent?  The current system in
Mexico in which the reigning, er, excuse me, *presiding* President virtually
hand picks his successor might serve as a good model.  Even if elections
were held and it took several months to poll all the worlds in the Regency
a leadership crisis could still be avoided.  (The recent assassination of
the Mexican successor provides an interesting insight into problems with
the `hand picked\' option.)

Other alternatives to `hand picked\' or `elected\' successors also exist.  There
might be a specific chain of command in the event of the demise of the
Regent - a `Vice\' Regent or some such thing.  The Sector Dukes of the
old Domain would be good candidates.  The Sector Dukes (Vice Regents?)
might even rule as a quadumvirate until the Regency Moot met to select a
successor.

The point is there are several ways to avoid a leadership crisis and its
inherent instability.

BTW, what is the noble hierarchy in the Regency?  Under the Domain there
were four Sector Dukes under Norris, right?  These still ought to be around.
I know Norris was sometimes referred to as Sector Duke at Regina but at
other times it seemed the Duchess of Mora was the chief duke in the 
Spinward Marches.  (Isn\'t that why Norris\'s capital is at Mora?)

Maybe we ought to identify these figures as part of the development of
the Regency.  There ought to have been Sector Dukes for the Marches,
for Deneb, for Reft and for the Trojan Reach - each of which also held
a subsector fief.  In the Marches there were Dukes for Regina (which
included Jewell), Vilis, Lanth(?), Rhylanor (which included Aramis),
Lunion, Mora, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil.  What about Deneb, Reft and
Troy?  Which subsectors managed to survive the Vargr incursions, the
Aslan invasions, and the onslaught of Virus?

Not exactly.  It would be like hiding an atomic strike on San Francisco
if you could only get there by air from L.A., Portland, Seattle, San Diego,
Reno and Honolulu or overland (not by highway) by 4WD vehicle and the
only communication in and out was by USmail.  Sound a little easier?

Ah, but there\'s the rub!  Norris wouldn\'t say *nothing* - Trin would be
suffering from a biological plague, or a civil war (like Joyeuse in the
Sword Worlds), or an *ihatei* or K\'kree invasion, or a sudden nova . . . .
In the days of the Imperium they called this - you got it - Interdiction!

Sure they would, but you wouldn\'t have the whole darn Regency so afraid of
the Virus they don\'t want to venture out beyond the Quarantine Line.  In
fact, nasty little rumors, especially if they hinted at something *really*
bad, would actually *help* the interdiction of Trin.

Remember, Norris is like Napoleon, only, for some reason, no one managed to
paint him putting the Archducal crown on his own head.  :-)

Yeah, I suppose so.  The only obstacles are three things, IMHO.  
First, Branj is probably about as old as Norris -- especially 
if he did announce the beginning of the 5FW.  New blood is good. 
Second, it takes Seldrian out of immediate sucession to Norris\'
old job, and Seldrian *is* Norris (being a gender-flipped clone).
Third, the nobles wouldn\'t like it -- I remember an adventure 
where a count was replaced by a knight by Lucan, and one of the
old guard turned up his nose and said "It is not appropriate for
a knight to replace a count."  Branj might not even be a knight!
Politically, it might be better to have a First Regent that is
also a subsector duchess.

The Alkhalikoi weren\'t long-lived as emperors went.  They were
pure Solomani until Zhakirov married in the late 600s, and
most of them lived to be about one hundred.  And Strephon had
little left to live for.  

Now the Lentuli dynasty, that\'s another story.  Martin III was
167 when he died -- and I think he was *also* Solomani in
descent!  (Medical technology, I guess, and Martin III looks
like he was an ornery critter.)

I knew you were going to say that.  :)

Saw Challenge #72 and Smash-n-Grab in the store today (and I haven\'t
been in for a while too....)  The news in Challenge is in a really
annoying new rococo format that makes it harder to read.  Of course,
IMHO, Challenge was one of the casualties of the Rebellion.

On the other hand, S&G is professionally done, and I didn\'t even see
any typos, which Rebellion-era players will agree is astounding for
GDW.  (Now I\'ve jinxed it, I bet....)  About five adventures on 
different worlds in the AO.  The military tone of several makes me
begin to see why we\'re using T:2000 rules. :)

Aside: In a sidebar, a RC marine wonders idly about the Purple Heart:
  "Where did it come from, and who\'s that guy on the front?"  !!!!
  The US Purple Heart does have a guy on it -- George Washington.
  Is the RC issuing US-style purple hearts?  Did the Imperium and/or
  Solomani?  Maybe it\'s inspiration to reclaim Terra by the US
  quadrimillenial in 1258!  (Temporally speaking, this would be like
  issuing a medal today with an Egyptian MIddle Kingdom pharaoh\'s
  face on it.  I don\'t blame her for not knowing.)

As far as the store I saw S&G at was concerned, price was $14.

	  So far, I agree with you.  The destruction of the 2KW would have 
	  _had_ to be as swift as (or swifter than - see later) that of the 
	  Imperium, Confederation, and Hierate, and the Trailing Extents.  
	  Remember, the Deyo-based transponder was in virtually universal 
	  use by the time Virus was born.  The Hivers weren\'t really less 
	  susceptible, though; they were just able to identify and take 
	  countermeasures faster due to their advanced computer knowledge.  
	  Even today, in 1201/NE1, they\'re still cleaning up the damage.  
	  But the important thing was that they were able to maintain 
	  continuity of culture and of communication.
- ----
Um, I guess I\'m not wholly following you here.  The Deyo-based
transponder was in virtually universal use *IN THE IMPERIUM* and in
those ships which did trade across the border (ie, within a subsector or
two of the Imperial Border you\'d find (say) one in two with a Deyo).
The Vargr, Solomani, Aslan, Hivers, K\'kree, Zhodani and whomever would
have only a handful of the total ships within their spheres of influence
equipped with such technology.  The Deyo would allow the Virus to \'leak\'
from Imperial computers to, say, Aslan through an Aslan ship with a
Deyo, but to infect other Aslan ships would require the Virus to adapt
itself to whatever protocols the Aslan are using.  The Deyo provided the
initial infection, but was no longer the prime means of transmission.

Basically, the rest of Known Space ought to have seen generally slower
infection rates, unless they had some communication system comparable to
the Deyo transponder hooey.  Plus, the K\'kree have really sucky computers.

Jeff also mentions speed o\' infection:	  
- ----	
	  (1) How fast did Virus really spread?  
	
	  The XBoat network in the Imperium was an essentially zero-layover 
	  system with an average point-to-point distance of between J2 and 
	  J3.  Thus, we can suggest that within the Imperium, the spread 
	  speed was J2.5/week.  Outside the Imperium, the jump rate would 
	  be lower, as there was no continuous zero-layover network in 
	  place, and "tramp traffic" density would likely be lower, as the 
	  economies of the minor states in the area would likely not be 
	  able to support the level of trade that the Imperium could.  
	  Assume, for argument, that this reduces spread to J2/week at 
	  best; we could probably cut that a little bit, and say that it 
	  will cross three sectors (spin to trail) in one year.  Thus, from 
	  the release in 1129, we can estimate that Virus made it to the 
	  2KW by 1131 or 1132 at the absolute latest.
- ----

Similar high-speed communications channels must have existed in all the
major interstellar governments, though, so actual virus transmission was
probably much higher.  Although direct infection through Gateway, etc.
might have been as slow as you suggest, it would be much faster (IMHO)
for the virus to have spread through the Solomani Confederation, the
Hive Federation and thence to the Two Thousand Worlds, each of which
has an effective common border.  Thus, transmission speed can be kept at
about J2.5 for the whole distance.

Here\'s the first installment of Earth Colonies campaign material.  I\'ll
wait for response to this before I post anymore.

COLONIES SPHERE OVERVIEW

The Colonies Sphere is a region of charted space centered on the Sol system.
The Sphere measures 30 parsecs in diameter and consists of over 500 systems
scattered among 56 subsectors.  Each subsector is eight parsecs wide, ten
parsecs long and nine parsecs high, containing 720 cubic parsecs.  Three
dimensional locations are similar to standard Traveller conventions with 
the addition to the standard four-digit hex notation of a two-digit decimal
notation for the z-location (vertical).

Coordinates in the z-plane increase from `upward\' (zenith) to `downward\'
(nadir), just as standard x-coordinates increase from spinward to trailward
and standard y-coordinates from coreward to rimward.

[The Earth Colonies Sphere system locations are based upon the `real\' locations
given for the *2300AD* "Near Star Map".  The three-dimensional Cartesian
coordinates given in lightyears (cyr) have been manually entered into an
Excel (Macintosh) spreadsheet where they are converted to parsecs (pc) and
translated to three dimensional hex grid locations.  I will be more than 
happy to provide an electronic copy - you can figure out how to convert it
from Mac Excel to your favorite application - to anyone who sends me an
unformatted 3.5-in disk and sufficient postage to return it to you.  Overseas
folks contact me first so we can work out currency exchange details.]

Many worlds in the Colonies Sphere have been settled by Humans and Dolphins
from Earth during two major migrations.  The first occurred before the advent
of jump drive and the second from several different worlds after jump drive
was invented.  Two other sophont races, the Aeroi and the Meren, have
settled worlds on the fringes of the Sphere from their own regions of space.
The Earth Colonies campaign occurs at the beginning of the 31st Century AD.

While several independent worlds exist most worlds claim some sort of
allegiance to one of the major Terran insterstellar states in the Sphere.
These major states are:

*Commonwealth of Earth (Earth/Sirius 1720.19 A867988-D): Homeworld to both
Dolphins and Humans, Earth is also the capital of the largest state in the
Colonies Sphere.

*Abrahamic Synod (New Canaan/Gaea 2215.10 A865999-D): Settled by followers
of the Abrahamic faith who fled Earth during the Sundering.  New Canaan
sends missionary vessels throughout the Colonies Sphere and beyond.

*Empire of Aztlan (Aztlan/Procyon 0911.20 A9879A7-D): The strongest military
power in the Sphere, the Empire of Aztlan seeks to expand its control among
the many independent worlds of the Colonies Sphere.

*Federation of Nyanza (Nyanza/Nyanza 1531.12 A86898A-D): Nyanza\'s settlers fled
the African continent and surrounding oceans during the Sundering.  The worlds
of the Federation are the most cosmopolitan (`multicultural\' in PC Newspeak)
in the Colonies Sphere.

*Ouroran Community (Amazonas/Ourora 1934.24 A766955-D): By far the major
economic power in the Colonies Sphere, the Ourorans often find themselves
in fierce competition with the Aeroi.

The two extraterrestrial races encountered so far have established outposts
and settled several worlds in the Colonies Sphere.

*Aeroi Worlds (hvi-Unapfi/Auriga 1909.09 A893847-D): The Aeroi are native to
a world far beyond the Colonies Sphere.  Aeroi merchants, based at hvi-Unapfi,
travel to every major world in the Sphere.

*Meren Worlds (Dedn/Europa 2934.30 AA6A865-D):  The Meren are also from beyond
the Sphere.  Their expansion into the Sphere, including sometimes violent
competition with the Aeroi, has lessened recently as their attention has
mysteriously turned inward.

In addition to the major Colonial States, several smaller states have been
established by settlers from Earth.  Most of these lag a tech level or two
behind the major Colonial States.  These states include the Republic of
Kiangsi, the Rajasthani Confederacy, the Dolphin-dominated Theridian League,
the isolationist Republique Quebecois, the Empire of Shinnihon based at
Ehime and the Kingdom of Hejaz.

COLONIES SECTOR

Subsectors in the Colonies Sphere follow the same Traveller convention with
the addition of a Roman numeral to denote the `level\' of a particular 
subsector.  Levels run vertically `downward\' from I to IV.  An asterisk (*)
indicates the subsector is unexplored by the Commonwealth Scout Service.
(Other subsectors may only be partially explored.)  The subsectors of
Atlantis, Susanowo, Sarasvati, Chalputepec, Siva, Jaxartes, Missisquoi and
Europa, while part of the Colonies Sector, are technically not included in
the Colonies Sphere.

That\'s all for now, except for the following pitch:

EARTH COLONIES DEVELOPMENT LEAGUE (ECDL)

Only the most rudimentary of structure has been developed to date for the
Earth Colonies campaign - basic system locations have been determined,
a few central subsectors have been mapped and UWP data generated, major
Colonial States have been identified, general technology levels set, and
major non-human races created.  The remainder of the campaign environment
will be developed by the Earth Colonies Development League.  The League 
is responsible for creating, coordinating, maintaining and publishing all
campaign background material.

The primary mechanism for the League\'s activities is the newsletter *Melbourne
Times* (MT#4 is due out shortly).  All newsletter subscribers become *de facto*
members of the League.  Other information of a more specific nature will be
published in a series of Working Papers available from the *Melbourne Times*
at a minimal cost.

So churn up your creative juice and become a developer.  Developers will be
responsible for individual subsectors (an 8pc x 10pc x 9pc region), for
individual states, and for individual non-human races.  General purpose
developer positions are possible too.

Actually, no, I wasn\'t kidding.  It started out as a serious attempt
to figure out the K\'kree in the new era.  IMHO, from the Hiver point
of view, manipulating their long term, diametrically opposed enemy: the
K\'kree would be a MUCH higher priority than would be helping out the
humans who the Hivers *know* they can get along with.

They know that the K\'kree will eventually regain space flight, and
so they now have a golden opportunity to get their tentacles into
controlling the Centaurs toward something more constructive than what
they were like before.  Remember, the K\'kree have *exterminated* several
sentient species before *just* because they ate meat!  This is something
the Hivers *must* stop because of their \'mothering\' instinct.  It is
also diametrically opposed to the way the Hive Confederation worked.

I think that manipulating them to follow the Hiver way would be the
highest priority that the Hivers would have.  I also think that the
fanatically militant and utterly pitiless K\'kree would take their mission
*deadly* seriously.  I can\'t see even the Hivers breeding the fanaticism
out of the K\'kree in only a few years.

Thus, we get the KFC (or something very similar to it.)

I admit that I started playing up the parody aspect of it (Oh no!
a KFC super bucket!)  But if you take that away, it\'s all quite serious.
Smashing asteroids into planets is just the sort of thing the K\'kree
woud do (and have done) in the past.

My take on the situation is similar to what occurred where I work about 
2 years ago.  When our union steward left we were assigned a new steward by
the Chief Steward.  There was much complaining and at a meeting we demanded
the right to choose our own steward.  We might even have chosen the same
person picked by the Chief Steward but we wanted it to be OUR choice not to
have the decision handed down from on high.

The Virus and events leading up to TNE are such a radical departure from
the 3I setting established from the time of CT (way back in the mists of 
time) that it throws a serious monkey wrench into the direction of most
campaigns that were in existence not to mention upsetting the sensibilities
of devoted players of Traveller.  Try making any change and see what the
result is, for example the Channel Tunnel, the formation of the EC, the
reunification of Germany, NAFTA, the proposed Health Care plan, etc.

Perhaps the reaction would be slightly different if GDW had polled gamers
thru their magazines, at conventions, and thru the various mailing lists. 
Just my 2Cr worth.

other bits of the Traveller universe out of \'your\' universe...  :-)

I guess I worded that badly.  What I meant was that I find it odd
that the 2000 worlds (an otherwise normal TL 15 nation) found itself
totally reliant on TL 13 technology for its spacecraft.  That IS odd.

}
}(1) How fast did Virus really spread? [deleted]
}(2) How fast did Virus evolve? [delete]

K\'Kree robotics (so we are told in Book 8 and 101 robots) is highly
dependent on the use of "Master -- Slave" type systems.  That being
where one robot with a computer brain communicates directly
electronically with brainless robots and in coordination with other
brained robots.  This is to keep an electonic \'herd\' together, much
as their organic masters follow their herd.  I submit that this type
system will be the most vulnerable sort of electronic network that
the Virus would encounter in all of the known Traveller universe.
This should greatly increase the rate of spread of infection.

From my readings of what we have on the Virus, it is sometimes affected
by the software and design of the system it takes over.  If the "Master
- -- Slave" type system/design philosophy, was incorporated at all into
the Virus, one would see an increased proportion of cooperation in the
Virus strains in the 2000 worlds.  Thus we would see fewer bits of
random destruction, but more coordinated efforts leading to
destruction on a vaster scale as individual vampire robots become
packs, and indivicual vampire ships grow into vast fleets.

}
}I have a problem with this.  The Hivers only created this plan as
}a response to K\'kree aggression.

Not really.  The Hiver way is more along the lines of "If you don\'t
like your neighbor, change him until he suits you."  They would have
come up with some similar plans even if the K\'kree were losing the
war, or even if there was no war at all.  The war made the
manipulations imperative for the Hivers, but they would have done
the same thing without it.

}Militarily, the Hive Federation
}was taking a beating; this is why they resorted to the
}psychological warfare of manipulating the K\'kree culture.  Once
}the K\'kree realized that they valued their cultural uniformity
}more than they valued their mission of spreading vegetarianism
}through the cosmos, they backed off.  That\'s why the Hivers never
}actually put their full-scale plan into effect.  Even given the
}opportunity, I don\'t see that the Hivers would necessarily feel a
}need to do anything about the K\'kree.  This, of course, could
}change down the road.

Well, by my reading, psychological manipulation is never the last
resort of the Hivers.  It is the *FIRST*.  The Hivers believe in the
"Peaceful coexistance of all races."  Thus the K\'kree, with their
policies of exterminating other species, are anathema to the Hivers.
Further, the Hivers tend to take the long view of things, being patient
molders of other species (The Ithklur for example).  As they are often
looking toward the future, they know that eventually, the K\'kree will
indeed rise again from the ashes.  They know that the K\'kree who do
rise may be just as horrible as their previous ancestors were.

It seems logical, therefore, that the Hivers will take an extreme
interest in how the K\'kree develop in the next few generations given
how wide spread they are and the power they are likely to yield in
the future.  The Hivers also know the principle of manipulation very
well.  A few words spoken in a few ears can have as much impact on a
culture as warship 10 years later.  If the Hivers are to manipulate
the K\'kree to make such a radical change as becoming a peaceful race,
which is willing to live with others, the changes must be started
as quickly as possible.

The Hivers have manipulated and \'mothered\' many different races to
conform with their ideals.  They could not effectively do so to the
K\'kree as the Centaurs were too powerful militarily.  Once that hold
is gone, there is no reason what so ever for the Hivers to treat the
K\'kree differently than any other species (excepting the reasons
I\'ve given above).  The K\'kree would be targetted for manipulation
as surely as the Ithklur were, and just as the Humans of the RC are
being targeted.

}
}Yes.  This is what I was referring to above.  The Hivers have no
}_need_ to be proactive; they already have the best defense that
}they can against the K\'kree.

But they don\'t need a defence against the K\'kree.  There is no reason
to defend against the K\'kree.  The K\'kree simply will be converted and
brought into the Hiver fold, just as any other species (Human, Ithklur,
etc.)  Standard Operating Procedure for Hivers.

}Remember that the other "unreconstructed" K\'kree will see these
}K\'kree as aberrant/perverted.  Any fights would likely be to the

}the Hivers is that it keeps the K\'kree busy with their own
}internal battles, thus they are not causing trouble for their
}neighbors.  But I don\'t see the Hivers forming an RC-like
}alliance with any K\'kree.

Yes, the KFC will undoubtedly spend a great deal of time fighting
the traditional K\'kree.  This will buy time for Hiver manipulators
and observers and give the Hivers the time and pressures they need
to change the fabric of K\'kree society.  And undoubtedly there will
be many such massacres as there were in the scenerio I presented
"Path of Blood" However, I submit that the KFC K\'kree would have
some attitude of sympathy for the traditional K\'kree, with a sort
of "There, but for the grace of Hivers, go I" air.

Also, it must be noted that even the "traditional" K\'kree have the
missionary spirit:  Witness all the K\'kree client races which have
been converted to vegitarianism.  With a bit of a push from the Hiver
manipulation teams, I think they would be willing to convert the
poor "traditional" barbarians, provided it doesn\'t take any more
effort than it did to make the original "client" races.  Conversions
and manipulations would follow the plans laid out by the Hivers.

}::>Why?  The other K\'Kree are intolerant!  They have no regard for the

}
}As above, strike "converted or".  K\'kree are not likely to
}convert.  Especially when the evangelists are perverts.

If the K\'kree managed to convert "inferior" (non K\'kree) species
like omnivores to vegitarianism, I see no reason why they would
not try to convert their own relatives to "peaceful co-existance".

}::>No, the KFC does not eat meat.  (Not usually anyway, as it\'s not

}
}But the mentality that would allow for this kind of mission is
}itself a sign of major perversion!  Remember that no K\'kree,
}anywhere, has a loyalty to other than the Steppelord of the 2KW,
}through the normal chain of command.

I strongly suggest that you go back and read "Lords of Thunder"
in MegaTraveller Journal #4 by W.H. Kieth.  Basically, it involves
the Steppelord a K\'kree Empire, an offshoot of the 2000 worlds.
The empire was formed by some True Believer K\'kree steppelord who
wanted to exterminate all carnivorous life, and unite
omnivore/vegitarians under K\'kree rule.  He was unsatisfied with
the current level of effort in that department.  The Empire he formed
was never recognized by the 2000 worlds.  Obviously, K\'kree are indeed
capable of loyalties to someone other than the Steppelord on Kirur.
Especially when they haven\'t heard from him in about 70 years and he\'s
probably dead anyway.

}Since all K\'kree have this
}loyalty, it is unthinkable to fight against other K\'kree unless
}they are diseased (perverts).  And since one does not voluntarily
}become a pervert, it is useless to try to convince a pervert to
}drop their perversion.  They are therefore not fit to survive,
}and must be destroyed, to prevent the spread of the infection.

The omnivores that the K\'kree converted to vegitarianism would fall
into the category of \'perverts\'.  Yet the K\'kree spared the effort
to convert them.  I don\'t think that the KFC will have any different
attitude toward "traditional" K\'kree.  Some will be converted, some
will be massacred.

IMO, if the Hivers are capable of manipulating a human culture that
has been an aristocracy for thousands of years into a democracy
practially overnight, then the above mentioned changes for K\'kree are
not out of bounds.

Kameraden. . .

When Hitler referred to Nazi Germany as the Third Reich, the assumption was
that the reign of Otto von Bismark had been the second Reich, with the
reign of Charlemagne being the first one. Of course, for Hitler much of
this was more likely propaganda to sway the Tutonic masses. Of course, I\'m
sure he linked Germany\'s might to the Glory of Rome, but nontheless Ancient
Rome was not one of the Reichs.

The other day I grabbed a Star System Generator for GURPS. I have the

netcom.com in the pub/cain directory (maybe pub2/cain; I\'m not sure).

Anyway, it\'s an *excellent* program. It looks good and generates an entire
galaxy, globular cluster, and galactic core, replete with sector maps which
can be exported as ASCII text for printing. It\'s not Traveller, but for
being able to punch up a map on the computer and let your players play
navigator, it beats coding it yourself.

I\'m not going to delve deeply into this pandora\'s box, just note that
one thing the Regency will need are fast reaction fleets to deal with
a direct attack by a Vampire Fleet.  (That may be how Trin got hit...
a fleet attacked and one got through in the confusion.  Since Trin is
so deep in the Regency, I wonder if it got any other places on the way.)

Deneb is a bit odd.  First the usual lowdown.  Under a domain archduke
were the subsector dukes.  In most sectors, the senior subsector duke
at the sector\'s seat of government was considered the sector duke, and
had slightly more respect.  Under them came the counts, who ran two
or three world counties, and under them the marquis who ran individual
worlds.  Sometimes frontier positions seem to have been held by lower
ranking nobility than usual, or lay vacant.

We know who the sector dukes in the Regency were in the late 1120s.

SPINWARD MARCHES: Duchess Elane Shankarr Muudashir of Mora
                  Born: 1095.  Succeeded: 1121.
                  Matriarch of Mora.  Probably Marquise of Mora.
                  [MTJ #2, "DIS News Briefs", p.3]
DENEB:  Duke Aleksandr Lagaashinga of Deneb
        (No other info avaiable.  Know that he\'s sector duke since
         Deneb is clearly identified as sector capital in the UWPs).
        [MTJ #3, "DIS News Briefs", p.97]
TROJAN REACH:  Duchess Sharik Arcadia of Gazulin
               Career marine.  Promoted to sector duke in 1118
               in the wake of the suicide of Duke Alexander Quinn
               of Tobia, after its fall to the Aslan.  Since
               Pax Rulin is administered from Spinward Marches/Glisten,
               she is also probably the *only* duke in Troy.
               [TD #20, "Trojan Reach Library Data", p.29]
               [Pax Rulin info from Adv. 4 _Leviathan_]
REFT:  Irrelevant.  The capital of Reft is at Cyril/Moibin, on
       the Ilelish side of the rift.  The "provincial capital"
       on the Deneb side is at Lintl/Vestus, and really was only
       a glorified subsector capital which had all governmental
       duties for Vestus, Macon, and Usher subsectors (A, B, and
       E).  Macon and Usher don\'t have central capitals of their
       own.  [TD #20, "Reft Sector Overview"]

Duchess Elane is most likely still in power in 1201, since the 
Matriarchs seem to be long lived, if her predecessor is any example.

On the Spinward Marches capital:

For a long time, everyone simply assumed it was Regina, or maybe 
Rhylanor.  Part of the reason is because of how large the Duke
of Regina loomed over the area during the 5FW back in the days
of Classic Traveller.  Mora was first identified as sector capital
in _Spinward Marches Campaign_, but not many people noticed, 
especially since the supplement was chock full of typos and about
half lifted from the old _Spinward Marches_ and _Citizens of the
Imperium_ supplements (although the Citizens section was so screwed
up by typos as to be worthless).  Since the back story of the sector
says Mora was settled first, in 60, it makes sense that it\'s sector
capital.  The main reason the domain capital is also at Mora is
that it is near the center of the Regency -- Deneb is too far to
trailing, especially with Corridor closed.  The fact that it was
already a sector capital didn\'t hurt, either.  

As archduke, Norris can only appoint new knights and baronets, but no
peers.  This could cause a problem.  Norris used to have an Imperial
Warrant from Strephon that would have allowed him to create peers
subject to the review of the emperor, but Strephon got "killed"....
Doubtless the Regency has developed some sort of workaround as part
of the First Regent job, for now.

Almost definitely.  We know that at least the Solomani Confederation
had an effective Imperial-style xboat route since they were still
part of the Imperium when the main system was completed in 718, even
though they had just recieved autonomous region status in 704.  The
routes show up on maps of the Solomani Rim sector.  The level of
formality of the high speed systems undoubtedly varied among the other
major governments...I can see the Hiver and K\'kree having decent 
commo systems, but each Aslan clan would probably have its own slower
independent courier network, and so on.

It seems to me that the real pre-cursor to the Rebellion is the
Solomani Rim War.  We\'re all so used to maps of the Imperium in 
its latter days that its easy to forget what it was like in, say
the late 600s, when it still had open frontiers, and its rule
stretched beyond Terra.

_Smash & Grab_ has been out for awhile now, and since I haven\'t seen a
review of it I thought I\'d throw my initial opinions on the fire to see
how many people agree with me on this.
 
CAVEAT:
    I don\'t like the TNE setting overly much.  Extreme distaste is probably
not too strong a term.
 
Overview:
    Smash and Grab is a 126 page sourcebook for Traveller: TNE.  The cover
is computer generated.  It purports to have five Hot Recovery missions
for the RCES.  As it says on the back cover "_Smash and Grab_ is a
collection of sweat-in-your eyes, ozone-in-your nostrils combat adventures
that will leave your player characters (those that survive, anyway) combat-
hardened veterans when it\'s all over." 
     \'Nuff said.
 
Specifics:
    Five adventures and eight pages of equipment at the end.
 
    Adv. 1:  "...a bit different from the usual smash-and-grab..".  About 
25 pages long, which includes the Promise subsector UWPs and several
full-page, but crude, maps and various and sundry artwork.  A full three
and a half of these pages are given over to the Briefing, which is intended
to be *read verbatim* to the players.  *THREE AND A HALF PAGES*.
    Basic gist of the adventure is the recovery of the crew of one of the
twelve original starships sent out by the Dawn League (that\'s why it\'s
different from the usual smash and grab, by the way).  So, land on the planet,
attack the prison, meet up with some Imperials who slept through the collapse,
collect the crew, and leave.
 
    Adv. 2:  Land on the planet, attack the Droyne at the starport, unplug
the virus-infested AI computer that leads them and steal his SIMMs, leave.
About 20 pages, with about 5 of them full page, but crude, maps.  The
briefing runs about a page and a half (remember, it\'s supposed to be read
*verbatim* to the players).  You also get to \'parachute drop\' from orbit.
 
    Adv. 3:  About 20 pages.  The TED in this adventure is actually a rogue
RCES agent.  Land, attack the psionics institute, unplug the virus-infested
AI computer, which...get this...is *psionic*, and mind-controlling the
aforementioned rogue RCES agent, and leave.  (This one reminded me of a
review of the Fiend Folio I read lo these many years ago in the Dragon.
"Ah, but *this* Mummy is _green_ and drains life levels.")  The briefing
runs about a page.
 
    Adv. 4:  Sneak onto the planet, pass yourself off as being from a distant
land, try not to look like spies (and thus find yourself executed) while
you try to find one of the RCs missing starships & crews.  Not as much shooting
as in the earlier scenarios, although it\'s set up to be nearly impossible not
to seem like spies (and thus have to shoot your way off the planet).  The
briefing is mercifully under a page.  About 20 pages, two of which are taken
up by a spread of floorplans for one of the local\'s palaces.  This is
basically a circular tower with most of the upper two floors (ie, the right
hand page) 90% "open to the air" (ie, no actual rooms or anything).
 
    Adv. 5:  Planet A. is having a civil war with both sides possessing
Nuclear weapons.  So, attack the planet, stealing some warheads from one
side and destroy a few on the other side to, get this, "...teach the
locals a lesson and reduce their arsenals, but not eliminate them altogether,
as the warheads being used are...[needed] to defend their world against
the vampire fleets."  Also, by GM fiat, most of the important equipment is
lost during the drop to the planet.  Runs about 18 pages, with under a page
worth of briefing.
 
 
Conclusions:
    1.  Out of five adventures, two had controlling AI computers and two
had TEDs who had captured a team of RC agents.  All were basically "run around
until you\'ve had enough intrigue and then start shooting at things"-type
scenarios, if they weren\'t outright combat missions.  One let you fight
aliens, one let you fight psionics.  Yup, an RC campaign will have *lots* of
variety :/  <Yes, I\'ve got Path of Tears.  This book is pretty far from the
"kindler, gentler" PoT.  It\'s not incompatible, but definitely much more
militant.>
 
    2.  From the introduction on page 5:
 
    "...[W]e have actually scripted the briefing so that the 
referee can read it verbatim.  Our experience is that this is easier
on the referee than having him or her make up the words of the briefer.
Also, having a script enables the referee to engage in some roleplaying,
and makes the briefing that much more real for players."
 
    Yeah, after all, you wouldn\'t want to roleplay any of your NPCs or
<shudder> have to *make up* part of an adventure yourself, would you?

    3.  Anybody who thought TNE wasn\'t a military role playing game
can go stand over in the corner.
 
    4.  Oh, yeah, nearly forgot.  Also from the intro:
 
    "All five of these worlds...will continue to figure in Coalition
operations and politics.  And since the Characters are *NOW EXPERTS*
on these worlds, having gained their experience the hard way..." <Emphasis
mine>
    Hmmm, yeah, landing and attacking a prison makes me an expert on the
whole world.
 
    5.  As someone mentioned, no Glaring Typos (for which GDW gets praise).
However, the grammar is occaisionally pretty klunky (not that I\'m necessarily
one to point a finger, but I can at least recoginize it).
 
    6.  For no apparent reason page 126 has the "cross-hairs" page number
that was used (I believe) in Brilliant Lances.
 
    7.  Ads for Star Vikings (which looks like a book full of NPCs) and
the RCES Equipment Guide.

Ahem.  Thank you.  But as I have often said, there is a reason why
my nickname is "2G"  I hope to correct miss-spellings of Kellogg.
[Come on!  It\'s on your breakfast table every dang morning! :-]

As to the Zhodani not being "Real" human beings, I haven\'t done
that yet for TNE.  However, if you want to read about "Real"
Zhodani in action, I suggest that you go back to the archives and
find the (unfinished) chapters of "The 4.5th Frontier War".  A
series of adventures I wrote (and perhaps one day will finish)
involving a crew of Zhodani wandering about in Iakr Sector (Foreven
to you Imps) during 1102, trying their damndest to solve a mystery
while the Spinward Marches boils up to a war fever.

[Basically, a SORAG "True Believer" defector was trying to ignite
the 5th Frontier War by playing the Zho navy off the Imperials]

Yeah, I know I wrote it, so I\'m at risk of blowing my own horn, but
it is the ONLY treatment of the Zhodani I have ever seen that takes
them seriously to my satisfaction.  One day, perhaps I\'ll get
around to writing up the last 2 chapters.  Not at the moment
however.

So what are the Zho\'s up to now?  Well, as Steve noted, they have
"Won" the series of frontier wars by default.  The Imperium is
gone.  The Regency is not a threat to them.  As we have learned in
MegaTrav, the Zhos didn\'t really want to try to absorb the entire
Imperium after all.  All they wanted was to scare the Imps into
never invading the Consulate.  Now they never will.

However, it would indeed appear that the Zhos will absorb the
Regency after all.  Though, not militarily.  As has been noted, the
Regency now has begun to accept psionics.  You can be a psi in the
regency and *not* get lynched.  This will of course weaken the
interest of the Zho military (and the common Zhodani) who wanted to
make the galaxy safe for psionics.  The Regency just isn\'t the
threat it used to be.

What they will do is to increase trade with the Regency and thus
expand their interests in it.  That will provide a broader power
base from which they can begin to move the Regency toward the
acceptance of a Psionic upper class, and when that notion is
accpeted, they will mold and promote that psionic class toward the
image of the Zhodani psionic "noble".

Note the manipulations already ongoing:  The Regency is not only
accepting psionics, we are told is becoming more and more
democratic.  Remember, the Consulate *IS* a democracy.  [The vote
is limited to the Psionic upper classes.]  But it is democratic.
It won\'t be long before the citizens of the Regency will look
toward their psionic citizenry to start molding their society.  [We
look to psych/sociologists for social planning, wouldn\'t one tend
to give more creedence to a psych/sociologist who is also a
telepath?]

As to what\'s going on in the Consulate?  Well, mostly a
technological explosion.  The Consular Navy needs weapons to fight
the virus.  There will undoubtedly have to be Regency cooperation
to keep the virus at bay.  Thus there will be some technology
transfers, but there don\'t need to be that many.  The Consulate in
1120 was a TL14 Borderline TL15 society.  Zhdant (the homeworld was
the only TL15 world in the Consulate).  That technology will be
called upon to fight the virus.  The jump from TL14 to TL15 will be
a very swift one.  My guess is that in 1200 the Consulate would
have several TL 15 worlds near the borders of the Virus (Spinward
Marches) and on those worlds will be a growing development of TL16
items.  Thus the Consualte of 1200 will be about on par with the
Impierium of 1120.

I would also speculate that the cooperation of the Regency in
fighting the virus (shared intelligence at the very very least)
would begin to see some authorizations of TL16 Technology Transfers
from the Imps to the Consulate.

Regency/Consulate Trade?
Well, the Regency is now cut off from Imperial markets.  They need
someone to trade with.  Consulate Traders will find growing
acceptance in Regency markets as the psionic prejudices wear away.
[Investors!  Put your stocks in inter-face trade lines!]

Take a look at history:
WWII.  The US provided arms, equipment, & manpower to the fight,
while never being actually attacked at its industrial sites.
Result:  The US became the major industrial force on the planet and
dominated world politics for many years before the Russians began
pushing to compete in the cold war.  The standard of living in the
US was the highest in the world for years after the war.

The Consulate has never been hit by the virus and is providing
arms, equipment and manpower to fight off the virus at the
Regency\'s borders.  Think what it must be like at home in the
Consulate...

Back to Zhodani Technology:
Someone suggested (I forget who) that the Zhos would pick up the
neural interface technology from the Imperials.  Well, note that
the "Neural Jack" as described is only TL13.  The Zhos already have
it.  Indeed Neural Interface Technology would be a LOT easier for
the Zhodani.  Consider:  To make a DNI (Direct Neural Interface)
you need a hyperaccurate map of the human brain.  Not only that,
but of the individual\'s brain in particular.

Imagine how much easier would this be if you are a telepath.

The Zhodani probably developed Neural Interface Tech at a much
relatively lower level than the Imperials.  I\'d say that a DNI
would be TL 11 or 12 (possibly even lower) to the Zhodani.  Indeed,
while the Zhodani may have been TL14 overall in 1120, their psionic
technologies would be somewhere around TL16-17-18 relative to the
Imperials.  [That means Neural Rifles, Neural Scanners etc.]  Note
that while only a fraction of Imperial worlds had a psi-institute,
*EVERY SINGLE PLANET* in the Zhodani Consulate had at least one. 
They are way ahead of this game and will stay that way.

Summary:
The Zhos appear to be manipulating the Regency just as the Hivers
are doing so to the RC.  With the huge resources of the Consulate
vs the Regency, plus the fact that the Consulate is far less
exposed to Virus.  There will be little to keep the Consulate from
doing whatever they wish.  But they don\'t need or want a war.

They\'ve already won.

That won\'t stop them from expanding their interests tho.

myself like that adventure, but they wanted something with some combat. Not
ALL combat, but a little action/adventure feel. To be frankly honest, some of
the original Traveller scenarios were a bit short on action. I have no problem

Hey, wait a minute!  That couldn\'t have happened because there\'s no way

Okay, how influential is Duchess Elane?  Can anyone identify the dukes
`under\' her?  Did I get the subsectors right: Regina, Vilis, Lanth,
Rhylanor, Lunion, Mora, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil?  Does Norris still
hold the Duchy of Regina or does Seldrian (or someone else, Branj?)?

> DENEB:  Duke Aleksandr Lagaashinga of Deneb

So in TNE it\'s still Duke Aleksandr or else his descendant.  What are the
subsector duke positions in Deneb?  Are there some `dukes-in-exile\' for
subsectors overrun by the Vargr or Virus?  Such folks would make great
candidates for the House of Nobles.

> TROJAN REACH:  Duchess Sharik Arcadia of Gazulin

Yes, I remember her now.  Did *TD* mention her rank?  That would give
some indication of her age.  Again, either she or her descendant ought
to still be around.  Again, what duchies existed in Troy?  How many are
now just `duchies-in-exile\'?

> REFT:  Irrelevant.  The capital of Reft is at Cyril/Moibin

Good point.  Won\'t the Duke/Duchess of Vestus be of greater precedence
than your average duke?

The question remains: where do these sector dukes and all the subsector
dukes fit into the Regency power structure?  Did Norris bring all his
courtiers from Regina with him to Mora when he became Archduke (like
Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton) or did he take advantage of the existing
court structure at the sector capital at Mora?  While the sector court
at Troy might have been minimal, the Deneb sector court under Duke
Aleksandr ought to have been on the same order as that at Mora, right?

I think we\'re beginning to see that the whole idea of the Regency and
of any `democratization\' in the Regency rests upon much more than just
Norris.

Hmmm, for a `simple naval intelligence officer with no intentions of
ruling\' Norris seems to have developed an interesting pattern of enhancing
his own importance.  (And before anyone starts claiming I\'m heading some
anti-Norris effort let me say for the record that I really like the guy.
I just don\'t see him as `simple\' or merely `benevolent\' at all.  He\'s the
sort or politician *extraordinaire* that would put Machiavelli, Richelieu,
Larry Atwater, and James Carville to shame!)

Another good point.  An Archduke can\'t establish new peers but a Regent
might establish all sorts of `governors\' and other administrators to help
him carry out his duties.  (Don\'t these sorts of figures appear in the
`future history\' side bars in TNE?)  [FACT ALERT: I don\'t have TNE!]
Might this be some of the source of the `democracy\' in the Regency?
How will the traditional peerage react to such a move?

I\'m *really* enjoying this!

100 DIAMETERS: LOSS OF ENERGY
As already explained on TML, No, jump drives don\'t need a gravity well to
expend their energy after a jump. There are reasons why high speed or FTL
drives might require gravity fields to speed/slow them (sling-shotting, etc.)
but this is not the case in Traveller (ooops, opportunity to get jumped on
here, so I\'d better add: in my opinion, in my universe, at the current
instant in time, subject to review... phew... that was close!)
100 DIAMETERS: EXCEEDING HABITABLE ZONE FOR A STAR
1) Not all inhabited worlds are in the habitable zone. This is a possibility
for explaining why outer worlds are inhabited when they seem to have no
other redeeming feature.
2) Why keep beyond 100 diameters? Well, in my world, opinion, instant, etc.
gravity wells disrupt jump-fields and can \'pull\' ships off-course. I retain
the 100-sun diameter limit for inter-system jumps on the principal that
when travelling several light-years \'through\' the Nth dimension, you can\'t
afford to have your nav calculations affected by such gravity; it\'s bad
enough that the whole universe is expanding, planets move around suns, etc.
let alone putting another factor in. So for a big star the party\'s ship
arrives at the edge of the system to make sure they arrive approximately
where they expected, and not in the middle of a planet or sun.
Now, in-system jumps... travelling a few AUs is so much less distance than
inter-system that gravity can be allowed for a bit - you don\'t have to rely
on old nav charts - you\'re in system, you can scan around and see exactly
where you are, where the planets and sun are, and even map or calculate the
gravity variations across the local system. Now you\'re ready to do an in-
system jump which can go within the sun\'s 100 diameters but still ought to
stay outside 100 diameters of planets and the like - fluctuations in the
gravity \'contour map\' may still pull you off line, so you want to keep clear
of planets, just for safety (i.e. star law 287312 dictates...)
In my game (personal opinion at this instant, etc.) you can activate a
jump drive anywhere you like, even on a planet\'s surface... Of course that
doesn\'t mean you\'ll arrive where you wanted... and in the latter case you\'d
better be hovering, or most of your landing gear\'s outside the jump field...

Humble, humble, humble. That\'s to make up for not prostrating myself
elsewhere in this article. Everything I said in this and ALL previous
articles is my personal opinion, has always been stated as such and can be 
substantiated as such in a court of law.

works - something I like about Traveller. However what I didn\'t like was the
way that they then used this to eliminate key elements of the MT and CT
universes, especially when there are huge inconsistencies in what they allow.

For example - no thruster plates due to non-conservation of linear momentum
however they explain Jump drive by saying that this conserves linear momentum,
and just changes you position in space. However this violates conservation
of ANGULAR momentum which is derived directly from the linear conservation
law, so in effect J-Drive is no more justified than Thrusters.

HEPlaR drives are a very nice alternative technology and if TNE was a game
with no previous background (although some would argue that it is :-) I
would use them however, IMHO, it alters the game too much from MT/CT.

The biggest inconsistency though has gor to be MESON GUNS! For a book that
explains in huge physical detail how things work why do they leave these in?

FF&S : mesons are a subatomic particle which transmit the strong nuclear force
       and which don\'t interact with matter.

WRONG! Firstly if they don\'t interact with matter exactly HOW do they transmit
the strong nuclear force? The fact is the mesons DO interact very well with
matter. When a meson hits material it produces a shower of particles with
will penetrate the material to a certain depth depending on the material type
and the original meson\'s energy. The original meson is lost when it creates
the shower and does not go sailing through matter as FF&S seems to think.
In short the meson gun is in no way different to a particle accelerator so
why leave this is FF&S while taking out other stuff?

Traveller appears to be no exception.

I agree.  My position has been that since the Virus attack on Trin *is* public
knowledge then it *must* serve the interests of Norris (or whomever the 
current Regent is) - otherwise he would have kept it secret.  I guess my
position has gotten a little confused because I\'ve been expending so much
bandwidth arguing that Norris *could* have suppressed the news if he\'d
*wanted* to in order to make my point that he *didn\'t* want to suppress it.
(Is this what happens when we don\'t `quote\' extensively?)

Anyway, I came up with the opinion that Norris *must* have wanted the news
of Trin to leak out in order to promote the widespread sentiment in the Regency
*against* expanding beyond the Quarantine Line.  If you\'ve been following
the discussion you\'ve already seen my opinion of the rational behind these
actions.  If you don\'t buy that, maybe it helps the Zhodani to manipulate
the Regency if it stays put behind the Quarantine Line.

Counselor Troi, can you tell us anything?  :-)  This TNE just keeps getting
more and more original!

Does this mean fashionable Zhodani of the mid-1200\'s will be driving
gravcars made in the former Wilds?  Or by Viral factories?  :-)

Oh boy!  I\'m loving TNE to death.  Just think, I can play a human puppet in
the Wilds trying to make the galaxy safe for Hivers OR I can play a human
puppet in the Regency trying to keep the galaxy safe for Zhodani.

Then again, we still have the Solomani.

    'body' => 'Ok. I\'ve finished up my preliminary work on a Space colony for Traveller.  For
now preliminary it will stay since I think that I\'ve generated enough info for
the thing to be usable.
 
Secondly, why go through the trouble?  Because no matter what era of traveller
you are playing there were always emerging worlds and I believe that the use
of orbiting colonies are the step that will be used.  Some ways to use
colonies would be: 1) As a setting for the development of the first Jump
capable ship. 2) Lot\'s of uses for a colony in a balkanized system. 3.) The
colonies are the space faring government in the system, and the planet is home
to a space fearing, zenophobic government. 
 
Well, anyway here\'s the info:
 
I started to design the colony using FF&S.  I designed the colony to 8G\'s and
the mirrors to 10G\'s to try to compensate for the acceleration and stress
caused by rotation.  Note that the mirrors are external to the hull and add to
the mass and volume.  I don\'t really see the point of completing the design as
this "vehicle" is so large that I think the numbers I\'ve come up with so far
are good enough to provide a general idea of the size of the colony.  As
mentioned further in this message, items such as cargo bays, docking
facilities, additional power generation, and zero-gee industry can be added
externally to the station and connected through the counter-rotating hub at
the stern of the colony.  The power requirement for Life support is way too
large for a self-contained ecosystem. The amount is there for reference only.
Other items of interest:
To simulate a 1 G gravity field the colony must rotate at .547 rpm.
Velocity of the outer skin of the colony rotating at .547 rpm = 383 mph

| |__ Stern Engineering                         Bow Engineering ____|
|
|_ Cooling array (environmental)


The colony is basically a cylinder 32km long and 6km in diameter.
Bow Engineering is 7km in diameter and 250m long and houses the solar power
array along with a few small maintance airlocks. It also houses the cables
that hold the mirrors in position at the proper angle.
Stern Engineering (7km in diameter and 500 m long) contains some of the power
distribution network along with
most of the environmental machinery.  A ballanced ecosystem in the cylinder
reduces the need for full use of the extended life support system. External
power is required for full use of the life support system.  The daily function
of life support is to remove excess heat collected/produced by the ecosystem.
The waste heat is dumped through radiators at the stern of the station.

The stern of the station also contains a counter rotating docking section (not
shown).  My design philosphy is to minimize the machinery and this design does
not include the docking bays, zero-gee manufacturing, etc. The "industrial"
area will basically hang off the back of the colony connected by a 50 to 500m
in diameter access tube. It is this tube that is counter-rotated.
 
The main cylinder contains 94 square miles of usuable land. Most of this land
will have to be devoted to agriculture to keep the ecosystem functional.  Note
that some housing will also exist on the lower slopes at each end of the
cylinder, and that some residents might enjoy living in the lower gravity
conditions that exist higher up on the slope.  I would think that a minimum of
2 million humans could live here.  I don\'t know how to calculate a reasonable
population density but I believe that even 4 million is not unreasonable.
 
My design also allows 10meters of soil (in addition to the hull thickness) to
allow GM\'s to use a wide variety of terrain inside the colony.

In order to build this colony, a smaller station must be built first to
provide the industrial capacity to build the colonys components.  This smaller
colony O\'neill One houses about 10,000 to 20,000 workers and is also
self-sustaining.  O\'neill two as I have designed here is based on the O\'neill
three colony as shown in the book The High Frontier.  Other ideas have come
from the Japanese Gundam series.  The OAV Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket show a
lot of the Rhia colony.  Currenly Gundam is not available commercially so find
your local Japanese animation group if you\'re interested.

Some last thoughts: I haven\'t included an altitude control system as I have no
clue on what would be required.  The colony computer and the Virus.  Compared
to a Starships computer, the colony\'s computer is an idiot. Remember that the
colony can be built with current 1970\'s and 80\'s tech.

Erp.

	In a fit of well meaning, but quite likely misdirected, energy I
rifled off a review of Smash & Grab that Allen Shock was right to point out
spoiled several plot elements.  Probably at least one thing out of each of
the scenarios.  I did this unthinkingly (hoping to put in enough of a
description to get my point across without reproducing the whole adventure)
and didn\'t really consider that I\'d potentially be spoiling it for others.

	In the event that I\'ve screwed up somebody\'s campaign, let me
apologize right here and now.  It was a dumb thing for me to have done
(at *least* without a warning), and I\'ll try not to do it again. <Sheepish

extract the main file (TCH_BETA.EXE) and a text file (TCH_BETA.TXT). Read
the text file - it does explain why the program might seem too \'flexible\'
in its handling of the rules.
Just to remind people, the program runs under Windows (3.1, probably 3.0)
on PCs and has been substantially rewritten (in a car-crusher) to compact
its screen into 640x480, so everyone ought to be able to see all of it.
When the final (pay cash or else) version appears, people who have
contributed (with errata, _useful_ comments, etc.) will get reduced price
or free copies. For those of you who download the program, please pick it
apart (by comparison with the MT books, etc.) as I\'m trying to make it as
letter-perfect as possible. Please please please note the comments in the
text file about the flexibility rules - i.e. if the \'Rules\' selection is
not set to \'Strict\' then yes the program deliberately allows you to re-enter
the same College as many times as you want, etc. The text file has an example
(near its end) to explain this. Charisma is for all races; it\'s just how
pretty you look. For Vargr, \'Social Standing\' represents the Vargr \'Charisma\'
since it is a measure of their social rank. If you can\'t handle things like
this, tell me and the next version will fix them.

Pretty influential, and probably *very* conservative.  She\'s
the hand-picked successor of Delphine, who seems to have been

No, we don\'t know a lot about her.  As far as I can tell, Troy only had
two duchies for three subsectors: Tobia and Gazulin, Pax Rulin being
under the control of Glisten.  [Although I once ran a high-powered
campaign that put one in Egyrn...my Imperium had picked up a vacant
world there.  They put a duke there because (1) they wanted more worlds
in the area, and (2) his enemies at Court wanted him out of the way.  
Fun, but *not* canonical.]

>Good point.  Won\'t the Duke/Duchess of Vestus be of greater precedence
>than your average duke?

Probably.  I didn\'t look real close, but Reft may only have two duchies
also, Moibin and Vestus.  Furthermore, the text in TNE suggests that
the Regency has extended its\' power out into Old Islands and New Islands
subsectors in the middle of the Great Rift, as seen on the "Black Curtain"
map.  (Mostly, there are supposed to be outlying listening posts and
RQS bases there.)  Classic Traveller players may remember those worlds
from _Trillion Credit Squadron_.  Lots of little human governments of
Terran descent (21st century STL, pre-contact), and substantial fleet
manufacturing capability at about TL12.  I think they were supposed to
have unified in 1106, after TCS.  (Wonder if Dulinor bought part of
his last fleet from them?)

Other interesting notes from TNE:  apparently Trin wasn\'t the only
world hit by a "leaker", just the most notorious (maybe none of the
others got to a hi-pop world.)  Also, at the beginning of the crisis,
the Regency sent some fleets to Riftspan Reaches to help the Aslan
close and seal the jump-5 route.

Oh, and about the side-bar "Regency Sector Governor" from TNE.  Watch
the dating system.  If they\'re using New Era dates in notes from
somewhere, that seems to me an indication that there\'s been contact
and perhaps some level of unification with the Reformation Coalition,
since the RC developed the New Era dates.  So far, this suggests
a reunification in the 1240\'s, although the worst seems to be over
before then.  (As in the "Eneri Kuniholm" entries.)

Okay, so she\'s probably not much for this new `democracy\'.  As *the*
autocrat she\'s the most likely leader of the Aristocratic bloc.  Maybe
this bloc is called `Muudashirites\'?  You might expect Duke Aleksandr
of Deneb to be prominent in this bloc as well.

Okay, but as a newly-elevated noble who had a career as a marine one
might expect her to be more egalitarian than the typical aristocrat.
A candidate to lead the Democratic bloc?  Anyone for `Arcadians\'?

BTW, if Sharik succeded Duke Alexander of Tobia as Sector Duke of Troy
then doesn\'t that mean that the Duchy of Tobia is vacant?

Okay, we\'ve got we\'ve got ten duchies so far (Regina, Vilis, Lanth,
Rhylanor, Lunion, Mora, Glisten, Trin\'s Veil, Gazulin and Vestus)
plus whatever remains in Deneb.  Can anyone help there?

Let\'s say Seldrian is Duchess of Regina (which includes Jewell), Elane
holds Mora and Sharik holds Gazulin.  We\'ve established the Duke (male
or female, in all cases) of Vestus as being of greater precedence due
to the larger duchy.  Similar cases would exist for the Duchies of Rhylanor
(Aramis) and Glisten (Pax Rulin in Troy and parts of District 268 right?).

So far, the Regency nobility breaks down as:

The Regent (and possibly Archduke of Deneb, especially if Avery *is* a clone
            of Strephon, the Aledon\'s might want to retain the Archduchy)
Duchess of Mora, Elane
Duke of Deneb, Aleksandr or his heir
Duchess of Gazulin, Sharik or her heir
Duchess of Regina, Seldrian (or instead Branj or an Aledon neice or nephew?)
Duke/Duchess of Glisten
Duke/Duchess of Rhylanor
Duke/Duchess of Vestus
More prominent Dukes/Duchesses in Deneb
Duke/Duchess of Lunion
Duke/Duchess of Trin\'s Veil
Duke/Duchess of Vilis
Duke/Duchess of Lanth
Remaining Dukes/Duchesses in Deneb

And finally, just to stir the pot:

How do we know this `Sector Governor\' is from the *Domain of Deneb*
Regency?  [FACT ALERT: I don\'t have TNE!]

This table shows that compared to the laser carbines muskets inflict
little damage unless the target is wwearing a flak jacket (or better)
armor - assuming an area covered by the flak jacket is hit.  The cloth
armors offer no protection against a laser which also has some
additional benefits.

The short range is five times that of the rifle-musket, there is no
recoil so it is an excellent choice of weapon for zero-g combat, and
when used in a vacuum the CLC laser inflicts the listed damage to a
range of 2400 meters.

Obviously when facing armored foes these lasers are as useful as
flashlights but then high-tech armor has to have some benefits.

Considering the fear and confusion at the time of the Rebellion and
Collapse MegaCorps (MCs) would lose interest in their holdings.  When
the tales of Virus first enetered the Domain of Deneb a number of the
MCs would probably have sent a mixture of company assets and hired
agents to contact branches of the MC in the 3I Core.

These would have met with varied fates including falling victim to
forces of the Rebellion, Privateers, corsairs, Virus-controlled ships
planets, & stations, and even populations tired and/or made paranoid by
the Rebellion/Virus threat.  Since disregard of the quarantine does not
seem to occur to any large degree it can probably be assumed that the
missions sent by the MCs universally met with total disaster (i.e. they
didn\'t return).

Since the year 1200 many of the MCs will probably be looking with
increasing interest at files from the time of the Rebellion and finding
a number of interesting data.  With the collapse of society most
inventories will probably be assumed to have been confiscated or
destroyed by someone in the intervening 75 years.  It is possible that
ships both under construction and those already built might exist but
again they will most likely have been confiscated or even captured by
Virus.  The final type of data rediscovered will be of most interest to
the remaining MCs within the Regency.

DATA - R&D and Industrial Espionage.  The past 75 years has certainly
been less than stable - even within the Regency.  Even though MCs have
continued R&D the quality of the work in many cases is inferior to what
was done before Collapse.  The quantity of projects has also undoubtly
decreased along with the loss of MC assets beond the Regency.

As the MCs continue to look at these old files listing the type and
location of R&D they will begin to form ideas for sending teams to
search and recover that data.  In some cases the site of such missions
might be original sector or corporate HQs.  These missions can be
expected to have to overcome the unknown just to arrive at the system
containing their target and then in some cases perform extensive survey
& sensor work to locate facilities.  These facilities may be under
control of Virus, genetic experiments, and planetary populations who
possess the range of attitudes possible in the Wilds.  Quite a number of
such missions could be run for campaigns operating within the Regency.

Cover up the cause of the death of several billion people?  I don\'t think so.

As the Brits would say:  "Not bloody likely!"  (Heavy Michael Caine / Cockney
accent).

Norris couldn\'t have covered up a tragedy of that scale even if he wanted to,
and he would have lost his credibility if he had tried to do so.  The
fall of Trin couldn\'t have been completely contained -- records, people, 
escapees, rescue attempts, etc. -- word would get out.

Just a thought,

I\'ve been playing the computer game "Frontier" recently, and for reasons
which are not Traveller-related and would take quite a bit of space to
explain, I spent some time considering the planet Riedquat.  Those of
you who have played "Frontier", or its predecessor "Elite", will know
that name; Riedquat is an anarchic world, a haven for pirates and a
great place to go if you want to kill something or buy stuff to smuggle
to somewhere else.  In "Elite" it had a small, basic space station to
serve as a starport, mainly because "Elite" didn\'t simulate landing on
planets so orbital ports were the only place you could go and trade.
In "Frontier", the station has been upgraded, whereas almost all other
star systems in that region still have the same small stations that they
had in "Elite".  What I wanted to figure out was why.

Riedquat is the home of numerous families who compete for dominance of
territory.  The competition is waged with any weapons available.  Think
of a cross between Bosnia and the town in "A Fistful of Dollars", on a
planet-wide scale.  At some time in the past, someone managed to get a
small space station in orbit.  Nowadays, as more powerful weapons have
found their way to the planet, there is no ground port because if one
was built, it would probably be destroyed again within a day.  Besides,
the economy of the planet is agricultural.  Practically anything which
can be grown is available there, especially narcotics.  Any family which
made the effort to build a ground port would be spending less time on its
agriculture, which would leave it with less money to import weapons with
which to defend itself.  For the same reason, no-one has built any arms
factories there; doing so would temporarily leave the builders poorer
and thus less able to afford to defend themselves, and the factory would
probably be destroyed soon anyway.  All families therefore depend on the
orbital port in order to sell their products and buy weapons.  The port
presumably has some shuttles which can take weapons down and narcotics
up, and which do not need a ground port to land.

Now comes my speculation.  The people in the orbital port realised that
they were in a unique position.  With more civilised planets, the orbital
port depends on the planet below for trade goods.  It is built, maintained
and controlled by that planet.  In the case of Riedquat, though, it is the
planet which is dependent on the orbital port.  The orbital port takes a
percentage of the price of all goods going both ways, payable by the people
on the ground.  It also does everything possible to make space travellers
welcome; docking fees are among the lowest around, and there are very few
laws except those needed to protect the station itself.  A squadron of
fighters enforces those laws.  The port exercises almost total neutrality
in its dealings with the families on the ground; it trades fairly and
equally with all.  Except, that is, if a family decides to object to the
trade tariffs being charged.  Then the port just stops trading with that
family.  The family is then left with a surplus of tradeable goods and a
shortage of weapons with which to defend them, making it a perfect target
for any neighbour who fancies a bit of plundering, which basically means
everyone.  At the same time, the people of the orbital port make it quite
clear that they have no ambition to take any land for themselves.  They do
not have the manpower to take or hold any ground.  Besides, if they did
show any inclination to do so, then given time they would easily be able
to conquer the whole world, as they have the advantage of controlling the
only way for weapons to enter the system.  So at the first sign of such
ambition, the families on the ground would have good reason to temporarily
forget their squabbles, unite and attack the port first.  But while the
port people show no intention of taking land, the families continue to
concentrate on fighting each other.  The space port continues to dominate
the planet\'s economy.  And anyone who visits the system had better be well
armed.

Sometimes musicians are wonderful inspiration for rpg characters, such
as the one bard from one group I used to game with by the name of Eddie
van Halfling.  Although I have only heard one song by Sass Jordon (and
then only because one Philadelphia DJ likes her music) I just couldn\'t
help creating the following character by melding this inspiratiuon with
someone I knew briefly in college.  This character may be a useful NPC
in Reformation Coalition campaigns.  Should any of you use her I\'d love
to hear in what capacity and what alterations she underwent.

  Sash Jordin is from Lucifer where she was once a mechanic.  After some
time it seemed to her a dead-end and in an effort to find something
better she became mixed up with some fringe elements (they call
themselves privateers but that\'s not what the Free Traders call them).
During this time Sash did manage to make a government contact that was
able to have her accepted at a Hiver Technical Academy.  After that she
spent some time as an RC employed trader before striking off on her own.
  With her heavily mortgaged (40 years) Far Trader, \'High Road Easy\' (or
the \'Easy" as Sash refers to her) she began plying the trade routes of
the Coalition with an occassional foray into the Wilds.  On one such
trip she located a badly damaged 200 ton ship with several hull
breaches.  It did posess an operation Jump-3 drive unit.
  Upon her return to the RC she sold most of the ship as salvage and
kept the Jump drive.  Shortly thereafter Sash touched down at Aubaine
for annual maintenance and also consulted with a Hiver Engineering
specialist she knows.  She then arranged to have the \'Easy\' refitted
with the new drive unit at practically no cost as the starport got her
J-2 drive in exchange.

  Now Sash\'s most frequent run is Lucifer-Aubaine-Kruyter-Nike Nimbus
with an occassional side-trek to Aurora and Eos.  She can also make the
Aubaine to Oriflamme run in two jumps instead of the usual four and has
been well paid a number of times for doing so discretely.

  Physically Sash has a wiry build with close-cropped hair dyed red and
a wisp of longer blonde hair at her neck.  Since becoming owner/operator
of the \'Easy\' she has had to watch the bottom line to make her payments
on time but will not risk her crew unduely.  When in a confrontational
encounter Sash will attempt to talk her way out but is not a sniveling
coward - if necessary she will fight using a Gauss pistol by preference
(or hand-to-hand on high law worlds).  In business deals she is a shrewd
bargainer and if she feels a particular offer will not provide a safe
margin for profit she will have no qualms about turning it down.

Because of several people asking for easy access to the GDW-Beta (and
also the TNE-Pocket) information, John Lewis and I used the current
GDW-Beta archives as a "test project" for placing this information
on the World-Wide-Web.  For the test, we used the GDW-Beta archives,
since they were only around 2.5 meg.

For those of you familiar with the World Wide Web, the URL is:

http://muon.qrc.com/gdw_beta/beta.html

The IP address is 198.178.200.101, if it\'s not in your nameserver.

BTW: "muon.qrc.com" is the MacII that lives on John\'s desk, so it may be
unavailble (there is an 8-user limit) or slow from time to time during 
the day.  Don\'t panic, just try again in a few minutes.  If there are any
real problems, contact John (jlewis@quark.qrc.com) or myself
(wildstar@quark.qrc.com) by e-mail.  If you can\'t get through by e-mail,
then we\'ve got bigger problems to worry about than a Traveller server.


If you\'re not familiar with WWW, there are several routes you can use to
access this information.  First of all, there are several WWW browsers
that are freely available for most major platforms; running a WWW browser on
your own machine is definitely the preferred way to go.

Failing that, there are a number of browsers accessable by Telnet.  I am
aware of the following (in general, telnet to the address given, and follow
any special instructions for that site):

info.cern.ch
	No password required.  Located in Switzerland; probably a good
	choice for European users, but not for North Americans.

ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu
	Log on as "www".  Uses the Lynx full-screen browser, which
	requires a vt-100 terminal (or emulation).

www.njit.edu (128.235.163.2)
	Log on as "www".  Full-screen browser.

vms.huji.ac.il (128.139.4.3)
	Log on as "www".  Line-mode browser with "extra features".
	Located a Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.  Accesses a
	dual language Hebrew/English database, with links outside.

sun.uakom.cs
	Located in Solvakia.  Uses a slow link, use only if nearby.

info.funet.fi (128.214.6.102)
	Log on as "info".  May not be working.

fserv.kfki.hu
	Log on as "www".  Located in Hungary.  Uses a slow link, use 
	only if nearby.
	

As I said before, the absolute best way to access this information is to use
a browser program that\'s local to your machine (and preferably uses all of
the bells and whistles at it\'s disposal).  Failing that, use one of the
telnettable browsers.

IMHO, the "best" one  (at least for North American users) is at
ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu (the one at www.njit.edu is slow).  From either one
(these are the only two I\'ve used), select the "GO" command to enter a
URL, and type the GDW-Beta URL:

http://muon.qrc.com/gdw_beta/beta.html

This will get you to the main page for GDW-Beta (where the charter, disclaimers,
and other legalistic garbage is, along with the good stuff: links to the
documents).  From the ukans browser, tab over to the link that you want to
follow, and hit enter to call up the next document.  Use the left arrow to 
back out.  The njit one is a little more klunky - each link has a number,
and you have to Query that number to call up the next document.

They all have help information, so take your time and read the documentation,
and you shouldn\'t have too many problems.

And our position is that there is no way that the Regency government
could hide the scourging of a subsector capital for more than a limited
period of time.  Besides, we don\'t know enough about how that "leaker"
got through the Quarantine.  It\'s possible that the leak was "noisy"
enough that everyone knew it was coming, and despite heroic efforts
didn\'t stop it in time (since it apparently stopped after Trin).  Of
course, it\'s possible that a far trader snuck into system and only
hit Trin.  There\'s too many people here who would know about it,
especially if a quarantine is either now or was temporarily needed
around Trin.  (But this topic seems to be mostly talked out, now.)

[Zhodani comments from several people deleted]

My original comments about the Consulate-Regency connection were
slightly exaggerated to make the point, since we really aren\'t 
used to thinking about that possibility.  While they are temporarily
allied, as Virus threat decreases, strains will reappear in the
relationship.  Also, eventually, the pocket empires will recontact
the Regency, and the citizenry of the Regency yet feels more closely
akin to the old Imperium than the Consulate.  Still, the Zhodani
are no longer the primary source of friction -- I expect that the
ihatei Aslan are harder for the Regency to negotiate with.  That
may *lessen* as the Viral quarantine ends, since the old Hierate
would then be open for re-colonization.  And even after re-contact,
the Regency may still want to go its own way.  We\'ll see.

Just to play the rules advocate for a while :) I (mis)quote some rules
that can be found in various books. For instance in Referee\'s Companion
page 20 it says that you can enter jump from any spot in the system but
only safely outside the 100 diameter limit.

And on page 13 in SOpM it says that a ship cannot enter within the 100
diameter limit of another body. I believe this is mentioned elsewhere
too.

Now comes the monkeywrench. This is taken from Imperial Navy Handbook
(INH) Revision May 28, 1992. (If you can\'t find it, it is because it is
a working document put on ice :) )
Rob Prior: The gravity gradient of a dense object extends further out
than one from a less-dense object. A ship can arrive within 100
diameters of a neutron star (which virtually guarantees destruction
from tidal forces) yet must also arrive 100-diametersfrom a red giant
(which is mostly hot vacuum).

I do also let my players acticate their jumpdrive where-ever they want,
if they are crazy enough. It is a great way to put them where you want

I have seen many threads dealing with the Zhodani either manipulating or
absorbing the Regency. 
 
Now my opinion on the whole situation stems from the data in the Rebellion
sourcebook explaing Zhodani motivations.  From that data I feel that if
anything, the Zhodani are more than happy to have a small, stable government
like the Regency on the borders.  As long as the Regency does not attempt any
expansion in the direction of Zhodani territory, the Zhodani will leave the
Regency alone.
 
Some quotes to further my belief:
from p66 of the Rebellion sourcebook;
   The Zhodani are not expansionist nor are they Imperialistic.  They long ago
reached the practical size limit for their empire, and they are satisfied with
their territory.

To paraphrase some info... The frontier wars were fought to keep the Imperium
out of Zhodani terrirory.
 
Another quote from p66
Nothing is more acceptable for the Zhodani than to have many small human
governments on its borders; each is large enough to be stable, yet small
enough to pose no threat.

Of course very little info has been released about the Regency and the Zhodani
in the New Era except for the fact that they exist.  From the rebellion info,
I would guess that if anything, the Zhos would aid the Regency against the
Virus while also conducting undercover operations to ensure that the Regency
stays small enough to not be a threat.  As for the Zhos conquoring the Regency
in some way; I don\'t think so.

I dug out *Travellers\' Digest* #19 and came up with the following info
for Deneb Sector c1120.

The Sector capital, presumably Duke Aleksandr\'s seat, at Deneb/Usani is
not the Subsector capital, which is at Usani/Usani.  Does this mean there
would be a separate duke at Usani?

Anyway, duchies were at Pretoria/Pretoria, Lamas/Lamas, Antra/Antra,
Arleshanu/Million, Magash/Sabine, Inar/Inar, Dunmag/Dunmag, Imone/Star
Lane, Vincennes/Vincennes, Usani/Usani, Geiishir/Geniishir, Qevar/Gulf,
and Zeng/Zeng.  Atsah had already been overrun by the Vargr and a client
state established at Atsah/Atsah.  Whether this was under the subsector
duke or a Vargr warlord is unkown.  Kamlar was probably administered from
Usani and Vast Heavens probably from Geniishir.

I beleive I read somewhere that Lamas had been destroyed in a Vargr attack
and that most of the coreward subsectors had been overrun at one point during
the Rebellion, including Aramis in the Marches.  Can anyone shed some light
on this.

I also believe I\'ve read here on TML that the Quarantine Line now extends
down the center of Deneb leaving Antra, Million, Dunmag, Atsah, Usani,
Geniishir, Kamlar and Vast Heavens to the Virus.  [FACT ALERT: I don\'t
have TNE!]  If this is the case, then the only remaining Regency duchies
are Pretoria and Lamas (both possibly overrun by Vargr), Sabine, Inar, Star
Lane, Vincennes, Gulf and Zeng.  Duchies-in-exile might then include Antra,
Million, Dunmag, Usani, Geniishir and possibly Atsah.

Any help in this area, canonical or otherwise, would be appreciated.

    'body' => 'Hi all,

Sorry, can\'t remember exact quotes, but here are two thoughts on manipulation:

RAPE OF TRIN
News got out. But whose news? [FACT ALERT (to borrow from Dave Johnson): I 
don\'t have any TNE stuff!] My \'Commander Lilly\' character eventually got 
promoted to be an Imperial Count. There were lots of planetary \'rapes\' (some 
even instituted by my own intelligence operatives) but my own people only 
ever heard what I wanted to hear. I didn\'t have to lie, just shift the blame 
or emphasis, spread a little rumour. If I wanted something to sound as if it 
had leaked, my intelligence people leaked it, then I denied it but, directly 
afterwards, also denied something people knew to be true (i.e. grass is now 
officially blue, not green). You only have to look at other world-scale 
manipulations to know that news can get out with no effect whatsoever...
For example we\'ve just had a documentary on the De Beers and Anglo-American, 
i.e. the controllers of 80%+ of the world\'s diamond market. Basically, 
diamonds are not exactly the rare things most people believe. It\'s only by 
careful manipulation of the media, markets, etc. that Anglo keep the diamond 
prices nice and high (allegedly, I\'m just repeating what the program said; I 
have no personal knowledge of the reality of the situation... but I can 
smell a rat as well as the next Aslan). Okay, so the program says this 
pretty blankly and also mentions exploitation of the poor natives, etc., etc.
Even if this program was watched by every person in the US and UK, just how 
many people are still going to go out and buy a diamond ring for their 
engagement, etc. The Anglo (et al.) marketing specifically includes details 
of how to encourage such sales - I think the program said over the past few 
years their advertising had persuaded 20-30% of Japanese now give diamond 
rings for such occasions!

The power of the media...

Someone else said:
> The Zhos appear to be manipulating the Regency just as the Hivers
> are doing so to the RC.
And then (I think) David Johnson said:
>Oh boy!  I\'m loving TNE to death.  Just think, I can play a human puppet in
>the Wilds trying to make the galaxy safe for Hivers OR I can play a human
>puppet in the Regency trying to keep the galaxy safe for Zhodani.
>Then again, we still have the Solomani.

Hmmm... Who\'s actually manipulating whom? [FACT ALERT: No TNE; see above] If 
the Regency, Coalition, etc. are getting back anti-virus help, aid in 
raising their technology, etc., wouldn\'t they quite happily play ball with 
whatever their \'manipulators\' desired. To take a vague analogy, look at how 
Japan built itself back up after WWII (hope this isn\'t a contentious issue). 
Back then they were \'beaten\', but now they\'re doing pretty well for 
themselves. Perhaps the general populace think their own governments are too 
weak to resist these outside influences but I\'d bet my shirt (a nice blue 
and grey striped one; hell I\'ll throw in the John Major blank grey tie as 
well) that the Regency (etc.) leaders aren\'t taking this lying down. They 
don\'t have to throw off their helpers the instant they\'re back to a stable 
position of strength; they can just quietly keep growing, looking 
reassuringly docile to the Zho and Hivers, etc. And if they pull new 
strengths from the outside influence - e.g. a resurgence of psionics in the 
4th Imperium (?) then they can\'t really lose, can they? Of course a good 
diplomat in the Zhos or Hivers will already have anticipated this and will 
have counter-measures in place, e.g. remote (flase holding companies, etc.) 
control of certain critical raw materials within the new Imperium, holds 
over important officials (spying, bribery, blackmail, etc.), etc. etc.

If a government says grass is green, run straight out your front door and check!

Yours, cynically,

Comments:       Aramis is the capital of the subsector to which it gives 
		it\'s name.  This has come about not through the usual process 
of economic and cultural dominance which determines the site of most subsector 
capitals, but simply because of the world\'s proximity to Rhylanor subsector, 
from which the region\'s government is directed.  The world  itself is ruled 
directly by Marquis Leonard of Aramis, and all major contracts  and posts are 
held at his sufferance.  Almost the entire world population lives within the  
underground city of Leedor, which the Marquis holds as his fief from the 
Emperor.  This city  grew up in the wake of the mining which carved the caverns 
it occupies.  The mining continues  beyond the current city boundaries, and 
still provides a major source of export.  During the  Civil War, the mines were 
briefly occupied by Imperial Marines to ensure continued production. When the 
world was scheduled for inclusion in the X-boat network, a period of great 
growth  came about.  The scout base was established at this time, and Naasirka 
underwrote the  starport  upgrade, taking control of the shipyards.  Much of 
the original X-boat infrastructure  for the region was built here as a result.
  In the late 700s, the increasing strategic importance of both the subsector, 
and the X-boat route through the system, lead to the establishment of a naval 
base on the world. The world had by then developed into a trade and commerce 
centre.   As the subsector population increased, calls came to move the capital 
to a more central  position.  This has been resisted up to now, and Aramis\' 
pre-eminence has been aided by the fact that six major transport lines run 
scheduled services through the system.  In addition, the world\'s starport 
remains the only major source of overhaul for starships operating in the 
subsector. 
 
Subsector D                                                     Deneb Domain

Those of you who have read this may have noticed that the distance to 
jump point is more than 100 planetary diameters.  This is because of a 
modified ruling I use for determining the Jump Point, which I introduced 
purely to allow accessible, habitable planets orbitting big stars.

We\'ve discussed jump distances before on TML, and I originally suggested 
that the distance you should use was the point at which gravitational 
acceleration became the same as it is 100 diameters from Terra.  
Unfortunately, as someone pointed out at the time, if you work out the 
algebra, because a star/planet/whatever\'s mass increases faster than the 
gravity reduces, the result is that you end up with even greater jump 
distances;  for the big star I was looking at, the jump point became 
something like 400 diameters, which took months to travel to.

After this, I came up with a different method; I assumed that the jump 
point was at the distance where the \'radial gravitational spatial gradient\' 
was the same as at 100 diameters from Terra, i.e. the rate of change of 
gravitaional acceleration as you move away from the central mass.  This 
gives the following formulae for the jump point distances:


Star

distance = 117.5 x (cube root of star\'s mass) million km

with the star mass in Solar masses (as in Scouts)

Planet or gas giant

distance = 1.28 x (cube root of mass) million km
	 = 160 x (cube root of density) x (UWP size digit) thousand km

where the planet or gas giant\'s mass is in Earth masses.

This gives planetary jump points of roughly the same size, but reduces 
stellar and gas giant jump points.  Provided you are willing to live with 
the reduced gas giant distances, I think this gives a reasonable method 
of reducing the jump point distances for large stars.  It also has the 
interesting effect of allowing straships to emerge from jump within the 
star if the astrogator is careless in plotting his jump vector.

If you don\'t like this, or my write-up, please don\'t flame me, as I don\'t 
care :-)  Your welcome to post alternatives, but this is what I use, and 
I\'m happy with it.

Sorry, Rodge, I appear to have been semi-conversationalist in this post ;-}

  OFFICE MEMO          Bank loan refused, re<Space Colonies   Date:4/28/94
bucsek@oo.com (John Bucsek) described his TL-8 O\'Neil Colony Two as:

>"Price: 468,614,466 MCr...The colony is basically a cylinder 32km long and
>6km in diameter....I don\'t know how to calculate a reasonable population
>density but I believe that even 4 million is not unreasonable."

Given the price the MONTHLY mortgage payment would be ~1.43 MCr PER PERSON
(assuming a pop of 4 million) given a 5% interest rate and 100 year loan. 
Also, this doesn\'t include the initial cost of putting 4 million people in
orbit--no small sum for a T-8 society (no grav).  IMHO, there is no way that
any government or private corporation would  back this venture.

But you say, "The cost is spread over the population of a whole world."  If you
assume that the world has a unified government and a population of 1 billion
the MONTHLY mortgage payment would be 5,739 Cr, or 68,875 Cr/year.  IMHO, there
is no way that any government or private corporation would  back this venture.

Finally, I have heard a formula quoted from "High Guard" saying that a world\'s
ability to build spaceships is one ton per 1,000 population.  I may be wrong
here because I don\'t own a copy.  The Hull Material    mass is 1,468,574,005
tons which would indicate that construction time for the 1 billion pop. world
above would be 14,686 years.

I respect John\'s opinions and efforts, but the math doesn\'t work.  Maybe that\'s
why Earth doesn\'t have one now.  This is especially true in the T:TNE era when
you know grav technology is "just down the pike" and there are vampire ships
out there that would drool to do a high delta gee ram!  BTW, the planet
couldn\'t afford the fleet to protect it either.

At least in the T:TNE era,  I assume that rational paranoia, if nothing else,
would limit the size and number of orbital habitats, starports, etc.  Also,
there would be MUCH less incentive to built high population cities.

Any, thoughts, comments, flames?

Heck, since Tobia was overrun by Aslan New Lords fleets, it may be
*gone* as a duchy.  (But still be a friction between the Regency and
the New Lords!)  Of course, it is also possible that there still
is a Duke of Tobia, but was either too young or in the wrong place
(like still at Tobia) to take command of the sectors defense in
1118.  Besides, with the fall of the subsector, the position would
become less important.

>How do we know this `Sector Governor\' is from the *Domain of Deneb*
>Regency?  [FACT ALERT: I don\'t have TNE!]

We don\'t, of course.  However, I thought that it would make sense,
especially considering that "Spinward Marches" is hardly an 
appropriate name for a sector containing half of a pocket empire
and it\'s capital.  It\'s not exactly the frontier anymore.
Similarly, I expect a renaming of the Solomani Rim sector, 
eventually, and Core.  (Although they may save the old names as
historical nostalgia -- if anyone is feeling that nostalgic!)

>The Sector capital, presumably Duke Aleksandr\'s seat, at Deneb/Usani is
>not the Subsector capital, which is at Usani/Usani.  Does this mean there
>would be a separate duke at Usani?

Really?  Interesting -- I\'ll have to have a look at that.  I only
remember a baroness at Usani (in an old TD or MTJ).

On Rebellion-era domain maps, I recall even parts of Regina subsector
were over-run.  However, by TNE the area seems to have been re-taken.
Some of those worlds, in the Marches at least, seem to get captured
temporarily every time that there is a Frontier War, but they always
are re-taken.

Of course, this last time wasn\'t just a frontier war, but things seemed
to be under control on the Vargr front by the time Virus hit.

[comments on Quarantine Line]

It probably isn\'t that bad.  Remember, the Quarantine Line has to be
fairly *wide* in order to work right.  Some of those subsectors may
be buried in the Quarantine Line but still able to function on some
reduced level -- the RQS probably has bases in there for refueling
and replenishment.  Admittedly, living on a world in the Line and
traveling into the greater Regency would be a hassle, but possible.

The best other suggestion I had was Regency.  Since I don\'t have the

Looks like it\'s gonna be in excess of 70 8.5X11 inch pages.  This is
just for the 40 or so likely natural bodies, plus some human-

The *BIG* problem I\'m encountering is choosing a tool that will:
  1. be easy for me to use to create the charts
  2.  Produce files easy for people to view or print
  3. Be widely available.


So far, I have (kind of) settled on Word for windows (v 6--the one

I think this is a good take on the Regency megacorps that provides
excellent adventure possibilities.

See *The Cosmic Computer* another `Future History\' novel by H. Beam Piper
that occurs prior to the period of the Space Vikings.  (In fact, *The
Cosmic Computer* occurs just following the System States War between
the Terran Confederation and the rebels who fled to found the Sword
Worlds.  Sound familiar?)

In *Computer*, the protagonist, Conn Maxwell, returns to his backwater
homeworld, Poictesme, after attending university on Earth.  His father
heads a company that salvages military hardware left behind from the
war.  The home folks want him to help them find Merlin, a `super\'
computer rumored to have been left behind by the Confederation military.

As I\'ve mentioned previously, the megacorps ought to figure prominently
in a Regency sourcebook.  With the exception of the Vilani megacorps
all of them ought to be alive and relatively well in the Regency.

The megacorps c1120 from *MegaTraveller Journal* (may it rise again!) #3:

Delgado Trading (miniturization, heavy mining & refining, publishing and
   trading)
- -A key player in the war against the Virus.

General Products (starships, non-starships, heavy machinery)
- -Quality problems were threatening existence by Rebellion.  Domain/Regency
 susbsidies would be likely in order to maintain a major shipbuilder (cf.
 the Chrysler bailout).

GSbAG (starships)
- -Probably doing well equipping the Quarantine Service and the Deneb Navy.

Hortalez et Cie (banking and investment)
- -With addition of Zirunkariish assets most likely dominates Domain.

Instellarms (military products)
- -Probably doing well, although mercenary actions can be expected to be
 limited in Deneb by government efforts to conserve resources.  Can be
 expected to favor the Expansionists and Santanocheevists.

Ling Standard Products (mining, electronics and computers, starships,
   starship systems, power generation, small arms)
- -Probably the primary commercial and military contractor combating the Virus.

SuSAG (chemicals, pharmaceuticals, geneering, extra-Imperial psi drugs)
- -Will the illegal psi drug manufacturing move into the Regency?  Obviously,
 SuSAG will support the Tolerant bloc, if not openly then certainly with
 financial backing.

Sternmetal Horizons (mining, manufacturing, power generation, food processors)
- -Probably doing well.

Tukera Lines (shipping)
- -Probably still active and possibly a supporter of the Imperialist bloc.

Vilani Bureaux (probably not active in Deneb after the Collapse):
  Makhidkarun
  Sharurshid
  Naasirka (assets acquired by LSP?)
  Zirunkariish (assets acquired by Hortalez)

Might there be any sector or domain corporations which now rival the former
megacorps in influence and power in the Regency?  What commercial interests
are not represented by the Imperial megacorps?

It seems to me the megacorps were always `ignored\' as the major players 
they must have been in the Imperium - with the exception of Tukera\'s role
in Margaret\'s faction during the Rebellion.  They ought to be very
powerful players in the Regency.

Ok lets start, Scott (2g) Kellogg: I don\'t think a telepath is going to be
much help in mapping someone\'s BRAIN; His/her\'s MIND maybe; Even my wife
noticed that! how about a clairvoient Doctor. Hummm and even then I\'m not 
so shure that the Zho\'s would be all of that much ahead in Nural jack tech. 
After all they have all of those nifty Flicking controls...

Some of you hace been talking about the Regancy. I too have been in a high 
powered game and had a character installed as Duchess of Egryn... She does
not have time to adventure, Reigning, Working for Norris and Intellagence
( Only a few people know about this... :-) ) and using her unexpected 
talents as a Fleet commander to help the Domain\'s Vargar problem. She is 
a very buisy lady. As is the rest of her family...
Over the years I have devloped a picture of Norris that is ( ONLY in my 
version of the Traveller universe ;-)) interesting. He and my Duchess grew up 
on Regina and know each other very well, as such she is one of the people he
trusts to tell him when she thinks he is going off the trail. She takes this
VERY seriously BTW. Norris was the younger Son and as such did not expect to 
reign so he decided that he would do something fun during his career. Then
POW there he is no more Mr. Background there he is reigning. Wow this is 
not what I expected, but I\'ll Try to do the best I can. And so he has, I 
feel that he has a talent, ( like Justinian ! ), to pick unlikely persons
to do jobs for him, But they turn out to be monstrously successful. ( who\'d
ever think that a 70 year old Eunich would turn out to be one of the Military
geniuses of his time ? [ Narsess of course ! ]). So given this and his 
Cahrsima and political astutness I think he will do well by the Regancy. As
will all of those who belive in him and his stance... I think that Seldarion
will probably succeed him than maybe Avery. The Nobility will have by that
time have built up a tradition of service to the Regancy or will have fallen 
by the wayside.
I like some fo the political factons and will prob. use tham in addition 
there are a few others... Anybody remember the Psionic knights about time
they came out of the Closet... OOps I\'d better be carefull I might let to
much slip some of my player\'s lurk here Hi, James and Catie...

On the Zhodani next door. Why spend time and money and lives conquering the 
Regancy when they are turning into good neighbors? But I don\'t think that 
the Zhodani would get to far trying to covertly modify the culture.
First, ( as Marcus remarked to one of the "covert" Marines on board. " Covert
IS spelled with a C!" ) The Zho\'s I\'m afraid not subtile enough to pull it 
off. In addition ( In My universe at least. ) the Scout Service has been 
doing manulipitions all along now ( Some one has to fix all of those poor 
planets\' cultures after being contaminated. Surelly you don\'t think TED\'s 
are NEW do you ? ;-) ) I think thay will be looking for anything like that 
here.
I also feel that there are strong political factions in the Consolate as 
well some of whom would want to keep hamds off and see if the people next
door will devlope into ( naturally ! ) the best culture ( Zhodani of Course )
and others would see the different culture as a stimulas for their own 
slightly stagnating culture.

More on the group of Characters They are on this weird covert mission to Ruby
They arrived on Ruby Flak and Marcus accually talked and determined that both
of their govenments had given them the same Contact! so they decided that 
Flak should go and make the drop. When he arrives he finds that the contact
has been taken off to jail by the local police. Not the Tvarchedl\'. Flak has 
to fend off the lady by implying that he is Gay... She tells him that some 
person has payed for the girls to take care of anyone who comes in for free
for that week. Flak comes back to the ship and reports.
Gunnar goes up and informs the troops that there is a free house and is almost 
trampled by them. ( he figured that this will make it easy to find them if 
needed ) 
Flak left.
Gunnar left.
Falk went to the covert Tvarchedl\' office and identified himself and told 
that he needed help with this mission as his contact is languishing in a 
local jail. They get excited and promise all the help that they can give.
So Flak got a turban, false moustache and a Car and driver. and headed 
for the police station when he arrived he saw a man, Big, wearing a trench 
coat Shades, and a hat walking past the station. Uh Oh that looks like Gunnar
I\'d better get him out of the way for a while. So he calles on the car phone
and askes his Tvarchedl\' people to arrest Gunnar.
Gunnar has put on his Trench coat hat and shades and gone for a walk past the
police station, When four cars pull up and turbans come pouring out, They 
arrest him then as they are putting this obvousely Sword Worlder in the car
they noticed his psi shield... a natural one ( you have to be in close 
proximity to tell if a shield is natural or not... ) They start asking him
pointed questions. Gunner is thinking "Flak I\'ll get you for this... Some day"
and then produces Id showing his Sorag idenitiy. ( Flak is not the only one 
with several covert idenitiys! )
The Police are all watching the show four tvarchedl\' cars one man being 
arrested and even before the media get their cameras rolling he is let out 
and continues on his walk!
at about that time Flak & Co. invade the policce station. Flak rants and 
raves about how horrible and ilegal the recent actions of the local police 
have been and he goes through the cells and sets some fo the prisioners Free
some for reeducation and at about that time the Military Governor shows up 
and they have a shouting match Flak finds out that the media is outside and
he convinces the Governor how to turn the situation to his advantage and 
he asks for a delivery truk to be parked around the side so he can port into
it so he won\'t be recognized by his shipmates who do not know about his real
idenity.
Mean while Gunnar goes to the "house" and engages a slim dark haired girl
( Exocitic fo rhim...Blond Blue eyed... ) then reports back to the ship.
just in time to see the reruns of the press ( why do they call it the 
"press" Hungh? ) reports. He sees himself being let go and FLAK walking up to 
the police station shure he is waring a false moustache but as Catie mentioned 
in a story where one of her Zho cahracters on catching one my characters,
"Dear Lady you can disguise a face but you can\'t disguise a walk". Marcus 
( who has devloped soem supisions about Flak\'s real idenity ) recognized Flak 
as did Gunnar ( Who already knew, Gunnar is a Brigadeer General and works for 
INI ).
Flak goes to the "house" and makes contact gets the information, and heads
for the spacce port. He arrives to find a riot, The Zhodani Tvarchedl\' are
going on a rampage and arresting people off of the streets and talking over 
police stations... ( Our Gm is playing this as a newly [ 5th] taken planet.)
After Flak convinces a guard that he is a ships crewman and wants to rejoin
his ship they tell him to wait until they can get him in finally he gets to 
the ship, Gives Marcus the information does not notice Gunnar or anyone else
as he goes to his room and colapses, One tired man he used a lot of psi.
Gunnar will deny being out side of the station if Flak ever asks.
Oh what a tangled mess. Flak is a Zhodani Gunnar is the Ini operator watching
him. The other two marines know Gunnar is Ini, Flak does not but he discovered
that the marines can\'t be read they have psi shields. Mahgs and Gunnar\'s are 
natural although they both have implanted shields. Doug\'s is an Implant.
this makes Flak very nervious as he is no longer shure who is who anymore.
Oh I forgot we had a run in with one of the pirates and found out why the 
Zho\'s are putting up with the Vargar pirate base in their system a Bio weapon
this is why both governments have put pressure on this group to do this OP.
Gunnar is VERY unhappy with the planning and orders that have been givin.
So is Flak, Marcus, and the troop commander Colonel Whotsisname Who has been 
not at all happy about the ring of command that these two marines have after
all they are only sergents. Just before the raid Gunnar is going to tell him
and inform him that during this part of the mission thsy are not sergents and
they do outrank him and he sould listen to them ( especally if the want to 
make it back as they ar eonly grund pounders, Why oh why couldn\'t Ini found
some marines? ).
I apligise fo rany spelling errors and I hope that you find my comments as
interesting as I find most of yours. I am going to play as long as my group 
wants, During the events leading up to the formation of the Regancy. The 
Regancy and Consulate treaties. and then start the children and maybe later
the grandchildern. I have already given thought to the children of soem of my 
characters. The son fo my Duchess wil go to the Naval Academy then into the
Navy of course. Then she and her husband get sent by Norris on a Diplomatic 
mission to Zhodant and beyond. He musters out and hangs around fo ra year 
then tells his sister that he is going on a hunting trip where upon he runs
away to join the scout service! The daughter will go to the niversity then 
come home. She has been influenced by the liberals at school and while Mom 
is gone she institutes some of those policies at home. She almost bankrupts
the Duchy but she is fically saved by this accountant who she decides to 
marry! When MOM comes home she is NOT going to be happy!
The grand childern have not been given quite as defined backgrounds but one 
fo the more exotic looking ones will be a singer...
Uh Oh I think I\'ve rammbled on for too long now...
see all of you soon.

The 2300 comparison comes from the importance of detection and sensor locks.
The primary difference from the imposition of the tyranny of the fuel gague.
The "they keep working as long as they have power" manuver drives have been
replaced with a system that consumes enough fuel to make a difference at
a tactical level.

Makes for a more interesting combat game, but plays havoc with in-system
travel.

Yes, but a calculator will be needed.  A spreadsheet is recommended, but not
neccessary.
The biggest pain in the neck is creating the damage charts, which cannot
be automated.

rationalizations.  What material changes does this cause?

See above comments on the new maneuver thrusters.

Also, weapons arrangements have altered.  High energy weapons are
useless in space combat (their "projectile" is too slow for ship combat speeds)
and are usually replaced by lasers.  Since lasers, particle accelerators,
and meson guns can be custom designed, there\'s room for greater
variety in these weapons.  Turret or barbette sized accelerators are useless
for ship combat (range too short), and due to design limits, bay-sized PA\'s
have trouble against ships with heavy armor. Good for hull-scraping, though,
which should not be underestimated considering the importance of sensors,
whose antennae are vulnerable to scraping.

Speaking of design limits, I\'d recommend an energy limit on lasers of 50 Mj
per tech level, or else their versitility will make PA\'s and MG\'s a couple
of also-rans in the weapons ratrace.

Finally, missles are all supposed to be nuke-det X-ray laser warheads.
No impact missles, and the ol\' Imperial No-Nuke rule goes out the window.

Maybe no TL8 world would (or could) fund a habitat.  HOWEVER ...
In many systems, asteroids exist.  This makes the job of getting 
the material much easier.  Orders of magnitude cheaper.  Little
gravity well to contend with.

On many systems, the habiats *already* exist.  They are just 
dark, cold, and silent (or maybe not?)  After all, _advanced_
civilizaitons put them up there, and barring further catastrophe,
are re-colonizable.  It will always be cheaper to (well, for 
many thousands of years anyway) renovate than to rebuild.  This
goes for things like lunar colonies too.

The "new" society need only be interplanetary, not inter-
stellar, to make this work.  And, for any society digging 
itself out of a near-grave caused by overspecialization in 
a single technology, re-establishing colonies and habitats 
would be a priority, if only for military purposes.

I can see lots of room for adventures here.

After about 4.0 on, they\'re all Mac Compatible. I have 5.1 and about a year

Hope that wasn\'t a major selling point - Sounds like Microsoft\'s just

    'body' => 'KMCCARTHY@qmgate.osc.hq.nasa.gov  Made a very good reply to my original design
post for O\'neill style colonies in Traveller.  
 
I also agree that 468x10 6 MCr is too expensive.  That is not even including
the support structure needed to build the station.  The only mistake that I
could have made (and I did do this deliberately) was to design the colony as a
Starship.  Building the colony would be similar to colonizing a world with an
insidous or no atmosphere.  And there are plenty of those in Traveller.  So I
would guess that building an orbital colony would be similar to colonizing a
vacuum world.
 
Other monetary comparisons are: O\'neills testimony before congress that
extablishing a small colony (only 10,000 inhabitants) plus the powersats to
provide Earth with energy plus the lunar colony needed to provide the raw
materials would cost $40 to $200 billion (in 1978). Cyberpunk gives costs from
4 to 7 billion eb for their larger colonies. Both are a huge difference from
the 468 teracredits (x10 12) I have for my colony.  
 
The one thing that is really needed to build a colony is a reason.  O\'neill
used solar power generation as the driving force with manufacturing as a
secondary reason. Fusion at TL-9 destroys that reason.  Cyberpunk uses
basically the same reasoning with a bit more emphasis on the manufacturing.
 
I welcome all comments (flames, etc.) but I will close saying that I did the
design study just to see how it would turn out.  I do think that special
design rules would be necessary to make it work in Traveller.  Those same
rules should possibly cover the colonizing of other worlds.  For example: The
n-th planet of that system x parsecs away is really rich in minerals.  Lets
mine it!  How much would it cost to send 10,000 sentients over there and set
up a mining base???
 
I question these thing because I like to Role play in a setting that has man
expanding out into the galaxy.  And when you try to come up with some frontier
setting these question do arise.

Regarding the `Rape of Trin\' and whether the Regency government would have
been able to contain the news of a Virus assault on Trin.  This is really
a moot point since the news *is* out and it has served to make the Regency
population wary of the Virus and hesitant to move back into the Wilds of
the Old Imperium.

This serves the interests of the Regency leadership (and those in the
Isolationist bloc) by keeping the Regency from expanding and possibly
encountering a legitimate claimant to the Regency in the Wilds of the Old
Imperium.  Whether this is the motivation of the leadership or not, it exists
as a by product of the populace not wanting to venture into the Wilds.

(As for all this talk of the need for the Regency to move into the Wilds in
order to `expand\' its stagnant economy - that sounds like a bunch of hooey
called Reaganomics - or `voodoo economics\' to use George Bush\'s phrase.  The
Regency is full of undeveloped worlds that provide excellent opportunities
for economic expansion - it was an Imperial *frontier* prior to the Rebellion
and Collapse!)

Furthermore, the above mentioned desire to remain behind the Quarantine Line
*also* serves the interests of the Zhodani if they want to maintain the
Regency as a manageable buffer state on their rim-trailward border.

Not a contentious issue (at least not to me and I\'d describe myself as that
most unsual of creatures in the US: a Nihonophile) but a better example
might be Western Europe which was on the `winning\' side in WWII but has never
quite been able to emerge from under the `800 pound gorilla\' of the United
States.  It\'s not a particulary horrid fate (any Europeans want to disagree?)
but it doesn\'t fit my picture of the sort of interstellar state I\'d like
to adventure from.

Exactly.  Another reason to rush out and buy TNE!  :-)

Well, not exactly, this is the `wonder\' of aristocracies.  Even if
Duke Alexander of Tobia died without issue the fief of Tobia, with
all its liegeholders - all those Counts, Marquises(sp?), and Barons,
still remains.  All those nobles with all their Imperial patents just
don\'t `go away\' because the *ihatei* show up and seize their fiefs.  In
fact, all those nobles have probably been at the Domain court for the
last 80 years clamoring for military action to liberate their fiefs
and generally causing the Archduke and later the Regent all sorts of
headaches.  These nobles will be active in the House of Nobles - more
so even than `sitting\' nobles because they don\'t have an estate to run -
and will enjoy the support of the other nobles who will want to ensure
similar relief for themselves should their own holdings be overrun.
These nobles-in-exile will dominate the Aristocratic bloc in the Regency.

Actually, I wasn\'t referring to the New Era *name* of *Deneb* at all.
What I meant was how do we know that the `Regency\' that has appointed
this `Sector Governor\' is the *same* Regency that currently resides 
in Deneb and not some *other* `Regency\' that has grown up in the Core -
maybe even behind the `Black Curtain\'?  Maybe the same `Regency\' that
the Regency leadership in Deneb finds it so convenient to remain behind
the Quarantine Line in order to avoid?

Yes, I remember the same `fluidity\' of the border during the Vargr incursions.
The important point though is what happened to the fief holders in these
borders regions?  How many returned to their holdings and how many were
displaced and are now sitting at the Domain/Regency court and becoming a
general nuisance?

This makes sense but as I don\'t have TNE I don\'t know how this jives with
the GDW canon.  Can anyone with TNE give us a sense of where the Quarantine
Line runs through Deneb Sector and which fiefdoms have been displaced?


One last note on Regency megacorps.  The *MTJ* #3 article on megacorps in
the Rebellion mentioned that in many areas sector and subsector 
corporations had begun to challenge the regional branches of the megacorps
in their regions.  This would seem to still have been the case in the
Regency.  Possibly, by TNE there might be several `mini-megacorps\' in the
Regency that are as powerful as the surviving regional divisions of the
megacorps.

Earth/Sirius (1720.19 A867988-D) 21 Feb 3001
- - The jump ferry Bright Prospect was christened today by Pan Commonwealth
Starlines.
- - The 200-kton starship is the first of its kind.  While jump ferries are quite
common in Commonwealth space, the Prospect is the first starship built
specifically for commercial purposes.  Previous jump ferries have been
converted from surplus battle rider carriers.
- - Construction of the commercial jump ferry is seen by industry observers as
confirmation of the economic success of the once-controversial jump ferry
concept.
- - Two additional jump ferries also commissioned by Pan Commonwealth have been
laid down at the Jakarta Shipyards.  A fourth ship has been commissioned by
rival Transtellar Lines.

New Canaan/Gaea (2215.10 A865999-D) 11 Feb 3001
- - Supreme Aspirant Ganesa today recognized the Prometheus Foundation for its
assistance in helping the Abrahamic Synod develop jump-4 capability.
- - In ceremonies at her Spiritual Sanctuary, the Abrahamite leader presented the
Golden Sunbeam, the Synod\'s highest award, to Maruda Ishihara, Subsector
Curator of the Prometheus Foundation, who accepted on behalf of the
Foundation\'s Board of Directors.
- - "With this new discovery we will be better able to bring our message of love
and peace to fellow seekers of enlightenment," said Ganesa in prepared remarks
delivered at the ceremony.
- - With its development of jump-4 capability, the Synod\'s place among the major
Colonial States remains well established.

Aztlan/Procyon (0911.20 A9879A7-D) 18 Jan 3001
- - A spokesperson for the Imperial Admiralty today refused to comment on the
latest clash between Aztlan and Commonwealth naval elements in Pollux
subsector.
- - "I can neither confirm nor deny any reports of engagement of foreign forces
by elements of the Imperial Navy," said Lieutenant Dona Imelda Aniak.
- - "While it is not our policy to discuss the Empire\'s naval maneuvers I can
assure you that any attempt by foreign forces to encroach upon Imperial
territory will be met with appropriate resistance."  Dona Imelda made her
comments during the Admiralty\'s weekly press briefing.
- - Tensions in Pollux subsector have risen in recent weeks following the
disappearance of the Commonwealth merchant carrier Finnegan\'s Surprise which
failed to make it\'s scheduled arrival at Remus/Pollux more than two months ago.

Amazonas/Ourora (1934.24 A766955-D) 01 Feb 3001
- - Spacers worked to stop leaks from a disabled fuel tanker Saturday, but rough
skies kept crews from cleaning up clouds.
- - Starport officials said hydrogen clouds and rain were spotted from between
450 and 3000 kilometers downwind and as far as 9000 kilometers west of Nuevo
Recife.
- - Officials speculated that most of the fuel burned before the Haven\'s drive
failed 200 kilometers above the resort town of Arenzano on 14 Jan, and no more
than 2 billion kiloliters was left on board.  But environmentalists say as much

    'topic' => 'Earth Colonies Dolphins',
    'body' => 'Gentlesophonts:

One of the tenets of the Earth Colonies campaign is that Dolphins are
sentient - not that they\'re `uplifted\' or anything but that they\'re sentient
*now* - it just takes Humans a couple of more centuries to recognize it
because we\'re so unable to envision sentience that is different from
ourselves.  (We\'re even seeing some of this today in the growing realization
that even the ways we\'ve measured `intelligence\' in Humans is more a measure
of `socialization\' that of `intelligence\'.)

I\'m not sure I\'ve done a very good job of portraying it yet in the Earth
Colonies campaign but what I\'ve tried to suggest is that Dolphins are as
accomplished at the `soft\' sciences as Humans are at the `hard\' or physical
sciences.  Dolphins are diplomats, sociologists, historians, psychologists
and artists.  To me this seems natural for a sophont species that has no
technological capabilites.  In fact, Dolphins had been trying to `communi-
cate\' with Humans long before Humans ever `heard\' them.  It was primarily
through the efforts of Dolphins that Humans and Dolphins have become a
fully integrated Terran culture. This blend of philosophy and science 
gives Terrans a natural edge when dealing with other sophonts.  (I\'m just
trying to envision what the `philosophical\' equivalent of `waldos\' would
be for Humans!)

The following article is reprinted from *Melbourne Times* #1:

Sophont Brief: Dolphins

Regarded for millennia by Humans as merely bright animals, the Dolphins are now
equal partners in Terran civilization.  In fact, although there is no
archaeological evidence to support their claim, both Dolphin and Human
sophontologists now agree, based upon examination of the extensive Dolphin oral
history, that Dolphin sentience actually preceded Human sentience.  Dolphins
rose to sentience in response to stimuli similar to those for Humans - namely
the need for improved cooperation in hunting and in avoiding larger predators.

Physiology: Descended from aquatic, air-breathing omnivore/hunter stock, a
typical Dolphin measures 3.5 meters in length and masses about 140 kilograms. 
Dolphin coloring tends to be grey on the dorsal surface and white on the
ventral surface.  A subcutaneous layer of fat provides a degree of protection
equivalent to jack armor.  Quite agile in an aquatic environment, Dolphins can
achieve speeds in excess of 50 kph in terrestrial-like waters.  They can remain
submerged for up to 40 minutes before needing to surface for air.  Dolphins
lack mobility beyond the aquatic environment, although this disadvantage has
been overcome through technology with the advent of the grav-assisted
environment suit.  These environment suits also provide protection from skin
damage due to lack of moisture or excessive exposure to sunlight.

There are two Dolphin sexes with little physical difference between the two. 
Sexual maturity occurs in the early teens.  Young dolphins leave their mothers\'
groups after three to six years and associate with other adolescents until
sexual maturity.  Females return to their mothers\' group for child bearing and
bear live young after a twelve month gestation period.  Males usually form
exclusive pair or triplet bonds. Females usually bond in groups of two to six
for the purpose of group child rearing.  Members of male groups often cooperate
in wooing females.  Male-female bonding rarely occurs.  Life expectancy is in
excess of 80 years.

In addition to highly developed visual, auditory, taste and tactile senses,
Dolphins also poses an extensive sense of echolocation - the ability to examine
surroundings by emanating and detecting reflected sound waves in water.  They
have no sense of smell.

Dolphins require prosthetic devices in order to manipulate most mechanisms. 
Known commonly as \'waldos\', these mechatronic appendages provide manipulation
similar to Human arms and hands.  Unlike early models current tech level units
can be harnessed to a Dolphin\'s fins without assistance from another being.
Because much of their speech is beyond the auditory range of Humans, Dolphins
often use a voder or \'voice-box\' to translate their voices into the range of
Human hearing (The range of Dolphin hearing is sufficient to detect Human
sounds).  Early voders required a surgical implant, but more recent units
function without invasive measures.  The voder is usually attached with organic
adhesive to the lower jaw.  Environmental suits and other suits designed for
Dolphins, such as battle dress, incorporate integral waldos and voder.

History: Sophontologists attribute Dolphin sentience to the need for greater
cooperation in hunting and in avoiding larger predators.  Such cooperation
proved quite successful, with most groups ranging from 5 to 40 individuals. 
Family bonds predominated.  Because Dolphins faced few environmental challenges
after the development of sentience the need for environmental manipulation
never became manifest.  Undoubtedly, the lack of Dolphin manipulative members
played no small role in this situation as well.

With environmental manipulation unsuited as an outlet for Dolphin intellectual
development, social manipulation became the natural focus of Dolphin intellect.
Early Dolphin society saw much conflict as groups competed for food resources
and mating opportunities.  The conflict was more social than physical with
\'victors\' enjoying the cooperation of the school, while such cooperation was
denied to the \'vanquished\'.  As Dolphin society developed, this conflict became
more managed with individual conflict highly ritualized.  Eventually
cooperation was accomplished without conflict.  Furthermore, the great mobility
of Dolphins lead to interaction and eventual cooperation throughout the oceans.

Dolphin history is recorded through an extensive oral tradition that far
exceeds that of any Human culture.  The sum total of hundreds of thousands of
years of Dolphin history is maintained by the \'Singers\' of each school.

Dolphins faced their greatest environmental challenge from their encounter with
industrial-age Humans.  Dolphins had long recognized Human sentience from the
first venturing of Humans into the seas in early ships.  Dolphins were
frustrated by the apparent inability of Humans to recognize sentience in their
ocean-dwelling counterparts.  This frustration turned to alarm with the advent
of industrial Human society and its wholesale slaughter of Dolphins in fishing
operations.  Furthermore, industrial fishing displaced millions of Dolphins as
their sources of food were harvested by Humans.  Ocean polluting served as an
additional environmental threat to Dolphin society. Dolphins were completely
unable to counter the technological assault of Humans .  Efforts turned more
urgently to attempts at communication.

The breakthrough came in the early 22nd Century when Human researchers, looking
for methods of communicating with theoretical extraterrestrials, turned their
methods on Dolphins as test subjects.  Once the initial contact was made
interaction proceeded at a dizzying pace.  Dolphin entities were admitted to
Human international organizations and Dolphin territorial jurisdictions were
recognized.  Dolphin sociological and political thought served as a driving
force in the greater integration of Human society found in this period.

The advent of communication, portable environmental and prosthetic technologies
designed for Dolphins facilitated their emergence and assimilation into Terran
society.  Dolphins quickly gained prominence in diplomacy, management,
education and the arts.  The fusion of Dolphin \'art\' and Human \'science\'
produced a new renaissance.

Unfortunately, much of the environmental damage done to the Earth\'s ecosystem
by Human industrial and technological society was well developed long before
the new renaissance could begin to deal with it, much less reverse it.
The Dolphins were less devastated by the collapse of the ecosystem than were
Humans because they were less dependent upon the infrastructure of a
technological society.  Nonetheless, Dolphins were active participants in the
exodus of interstellar expeditions that fled the Earth during the Sundering.

When Terrans once again ventured out into space Dolphins were firmly
established as equal partners with Humans.  Much of the success of
reintegrating the Near Solar colonies into the Commonwealth is attributed to
Dolphin diplomats such as Garibaldi Bridgebuilder.

Psychology: Dolphin psychology is often quite difficult for Humans to grasp. 
Dolphins value their individual independence even more so than most Humans. 
And yet Dolphins also place a greater value upon the social community as well. 
This aspect of existence is so important that Dolphins often succumb to death
when exposed to extend periods of isolation.  On the other hand a Dolphin would
not dream of giving up one\'s own individuality.  Whereas the relationship
between individuality and community has been a constant source of conflict in
most Human cultures the Dolphins have developed a symbiosis between the two
that is unparalleled in Human society.

The result is that Dolphin society is much more harmonious and homogeneous than
is Human culture while at the same time tolerating, even encouraging, greater
individuality and a wider range of diversity.  This attitude has facilitated
the integration of Human and Dolphin society.  Dolphins do though sometimes
have difficulty remaining committed to the ideals of sub-groups within society,
say a corporation or governmental entity, and at other times find it difficult
to differentiate themselves from the interests of larger groups beyond the
society, such as other foreign states.  This may explain the most common
stereotype of Dolphins as freelance diplomats.

Society: Due to the extensive global interaction among groups, Dolphin society
does not suffer the extensive fragmentation common to Human society.  Dolphin
society is much more harmonious and homogeneous than is Human culture.  On the
other hand Dolphin society is much more tolerant of diversity and individuality
within society than any Human culture.

Dolphin society lacks the extensive governmental and mercantile organizations
of Human society.  Individuals participate in activities on an ad hoc basis. 
This may seem unmanageable to non-Dolphins until one takes into account the
fact that being a contributing member of society is central to the psyche of
every Dolphin.

A specific \'Dolphin\' society no longer exists.  Dolphin and Human societies are
fully integrated, both in the Commonwealth and in the Colonial States.  Thus,
Dolphins have adopted some of the more formal structures of traditional Human
society while at the same time transforming those structures in such a manner
that they would not be recognized as such by a Human from the period before the
fusion of the two cultures.

Dolphins are at the forefront of those calling for integration of the
Commonwealth and the other Colonial States.  At the extreme, Dolphins are also
prominent among those calling for greater cooperation between Terrans and
extraterrestrials.  Dolphins can be found extensively among the diplomatic
services, the mercantile concerns, the exploratory services and the arts. 
While Dolphins make excellent educators they generally are poor scientists,
engineers and soldiers.

I hope not. GDW has already dropped thier Dark Conspircy line due to
lack of sales. Personally, I like T:TNE, but I never did play 
Classic Traveller, and MegaTraveller seem to lack organiztion.

I have a couple of questions for the list (this has bugged me for
quite awhile).

1. I know ALOT of people dislike T:TNE. Is it due to the system, or
the world?

2. What would people change in the current Traveller version? 

I think GDW needs to do something to regain support of the people
they losted, and maybe the T:TNE bashers need to be more understanding
to change.

Just comments (no flames please),

This is a very good point.  I was looking at the Sword Worlds this weekend
with the intention of bringing them `up to date\' to TNE.  In 1120 most of
the Sword Worlds were at tech level 10 or 11 with the exception of Sacnoth
which was at tech level 12.  The only class A starport (if my memory serves
me - my materials aren\'t at hand) was at Gram.  It seems to me that by
TNE most of the worlds in a `feudal technocracy\' ought to have advanced
at least *one* tech level if not more and that additional class A starports
ought to exist - prime candidates being *at least* Anduril and Sacnoth.

    I\'ve been wondering how well Traveller:TNE is doing in terms of
	sales.  I know I haven\'t purchased it, but that is more related to
	personal finances than anything.  Once my stint as a student is
	finally over (at least for a couple years), I certainly hope to pick
	up the new traveller material, despite its flaws. 
	
	What\'s in the boxed set?  I\'ve never seen it around up here.

I\'ve been asked to post some info on a 3D subsector.  The following is
reprinted from *Melbourne Times* #3:

Starfield: Fomalhaut Subsector (K-III)

Named for its brightest star at hex 2322.22 the Fomalhaut Subsector contains 33
worlds.  The highest population is 800 million at Tabora.  The highest tech
level is 13 at Okhotsk and Ibadan.

Fomalhaut is one of the core subsectors surrounding Earth which is just one
parsec to coreward of hex 1720.19.  The Commonwealth enjoys much influence in
the subsector, maintaining naval bases at Nifflheim and Canyon and scout bases
at several other independent worlds.  The Ouroran Community is somewhat less
influential in Fomalhaut but does maintain scout bases at Nuevo Chaco and
Nunavut which also hosts a Commonwealth scout base.

Most worlds in the subsector are non-aligned.  Eight worlds claim allegiance to
the Commonwealth of Earth to coreward in Sirius Subsector.  A single world,
Goias, claims allegiance to the Ouroran Community to rimward in Ourora
Subsector.

Tabora, the populous rich world, and Marduk, a rich, agricultural world are
chief in importance in the subsector.  Trabzon and the breadbaskets Okhotsk,
Maka and No Cha are also important worlds.

Major Subsector Trade Routes

  OFFICE MEMO          Recolonization in T:TNE                Date:5/2/94
Recent discussions on O\'Neill colonies brings up a new topic for dicussion:
Will the systems without habital planets be recolonized?

"At least in the T:TNE era,  I assume that rational paranoia, if nothing else,
would limit the size and number of orbital habitats, starports, etc.  Also,
there would be MUCH less incentive to built high population cities."

I believe that the tens to hundreds of billions killed by the effects of the
Virus in systems without habitable planets will be a massive impediment to the
recolonization of systems.  There may be bases, trading posts, outposts, etc.
in these systems but not full fledged Traveller worlds for 100s of years AT
LEAST.  Aside from the issue of cost of recontruction of these "domed" worlds,
which I\'ll be the first to admit FFS can not deal with, there is the
psycological impact.  I\'d guess that 99+% of any population wouldn\'t be willing
to live an a domed colony.  "What if the Virus comes back?"  

The starmap of the future will look quite different from the 3I era.  This will
effect everything from interstellar trade to warfare.  

Comments?

market share that I see.   My local store (in Duluth, MN)  only carries 
one or two TNE items at a time.  I think there are couple of problems 
that are evident.

1)  The quality of materials in MegaTrav definently drove people away.
2)  Not creating a new fad with TNE, sort of jumping on the destroyed 
    universe bandwagon.
3)  Computer Games are getting much more sophisticated, and Traveller 
    has not kept up.
4)  Detail, not enough detail for novice group to build a traveller campaign.
    ie.  DND were everything there for you.  Even a novice player who 
    knows the rules can get buy with one of the modules.  It may only be 
    passing, but it is not failing.  Therefore it is hard to bring people 
    into traveller.

Using MegaTRaveller and Book 7: Merchant Prince as sources the following
info re. possible MegaCorps within the Regency may be of use.

Merchant Lines known to have operated within the Spinward Marches up to
the time of the Black War include:

Imperial Merchants: Ling Standard Products, Makhidkarun, Naasirka,
Sharurshid, Tukera Lines, Al Morai, Sinzarmes, Oberlindes Lines, UTP
(Uake Transport Partners), Jamison Factors.

Darrian: Tharnitia Denus, Frendi Marshikin, Theriani.

Sword Worlds: Gramstaatsbedrif, Chaperons Blancs, Talisman.

Others: Tyeyo Fteahrao Yoir (Aslan Interface Line), Dhoylezhokka (Droyne
Interface Line), Thyo Supud (Droyne Free Trader), Rraegnaell Oukh (Vargr
Interface Line).


This is not to signify my interest in tackling MegaCorps in the Regency.
I\'d like to instead be a primary contributer to the Quarantine Service.
This service seems to ahve its roots with the creation of The Patrol
established in 1120 by Norris as Archduke of Deneb using naval reserve
ships and crews to begin security sweeps along the Imperial coreward
border of Deneb.  L\'oeul d\'Dieu (3010) Imperial Naval Base was handed
over to the Patrol as a permanent base of operations.  The Patrol\'s
policy was to secure the borders from incursions and invasions.  Aslan
enlistees were actively sought after.

More info in future installments.

The Domain of Deneb map in *MegaTraveller Journal* #1 shows the Border
Worlds, the Imperial client state established in the worlds occupied at
the end of the Fifth Frontier War.  This map is dated c1120.

In *MTJ* #3 there is Domain of Deneb UWP data to accompany the *MTJ* #1
map but it is dated c1118.  This UWP data does not show any allegiance
codes for the Border Worlds and instead lists all the Imperial-occupied
worlds as part of the Sword Worlds once again.

The `library data\' that accompanied the map in *MTJ* #1 indicated that
the Border Worlds were `tightly controlled\' from their capital at Beater.
Then, apparently, by *MTJ* #3 - two campaign years earlier(!) - there are
no Border Worlds.

Can anyone shed any light on this situation?  It\'s my sense that with the
Vargr and Aslan incursions that the Domain might have found it simpler to
no longer maintain the occupation and sustain their client state - and
the Border Worlds would have quickly fallen.

Well, yes.  There are differences between the brain and the mind.
However, a detailed functional study of the mind/brain will be
infinitely easier for the longstanding psionic sciences of the
Zhodani than it would be for the Imperials.

Allow my to give you an example of how the brain is \'mapped\'.  It
is mainly accomplished by studies of head injuries and the ways in
which the physical damage is correlated to the damage to the mind.

Person X has a lesion on the cingulate gyrus, just above the corpus
callosum.  This might be established by several means:  (CAT scan,
clairvoyance or other)

Person X\'s behavior is to sit around all day and do nothing.
Person X will not even eat unless fed.

So what does that say about the function of the cingulate gyrus of
the brain?  Hum...  Well...?

A psychologist will sit around for hours and wonder and puzzle what
the heck is going on in person X\'s mind.  Eventually, (If they\'re
very lucky and have enough high tech equipment around to determine
it all)  They may come up with an answer that is an edjucated
guess.  Thus they discover the function of the cingulate gyrus of
the brain.

A telepath can tell you *EXACTLY* what damage has been done to the
mind.  "Well, person X can see and hear and understand everything
around him, but has no desire to act upon that information.  Even
to the point of knowing that he is hungry, but he lacks the will
power to get up and go feed himself.  Therefore the cingulate gyrus
appears to be the center of the mind\'s motivations and will power."
(BTW, in case you\'re wondering, this is the current guess as to the
function of the Cinguate Gyrus.)

Another sort of study to feed a person\'s brain stimulus and then
monitor activity levels of different areas of the brain by watching
the levels of glucose uptake.

"Hey!  When we feed him visual images, the occipital lobes of the
brain light up!  Look at the glucose intake there.  Must be the
visual centers!"

Or, in brain surgery, the surgeon pokes around a bit and finds that
by prodding here, just posterior to the central sulcus the patient
feels a sensation in his foot.  But if they prod just *anterior* to
the central sulcus, the foot *moves*  Ah HA here we have the
sensory part of the brain, and here we have the motor!

Then we come to a *BIG* problem.  Well, it seems that not everyone
in the world has an identical brain, nor an identical mind.
(Surprise, surprise)  To put in something like a direct neural
interface, you need to know the recipient\'s brain with a fair
amount of exactness.  VERY difficult if you have only a CAT scan
and a glucose monitor.  But in the case of the telepath, the brain
differences can be mapped out for individuals because the minds can
be mapped out with clarity.

With telepathy you\'re taking all the guesswork out of it.  Much
more accurate determinations can be made because the mind in
question can be studied with exactitude.

I would further point out that the history of the Zhodani gives
them a surprising amount of scientific background on the mind and
brain.  The Consulate is the longest standing human government in
the entirity of the Traveller Universe.  TL8 should give the
Zhodani all the technology they need to determine an accurate model
of the human brain.  They\'ve been TL8+ for nearly 8000 years.
Their psi-science has been around for longer than that.  I maintain
that the Zhodani have had accurate models of the brain for at least
8000 years.

Because of this and their culture, it seems logical to me that the
psionic and medical sciences related to the brain of the Zhodani
are at the very *least* 1 or 2 tech levels (probably more like 3-4)
in advance of what would be normal for Imperial technologies.
Thus, they would have a DNI at TL12.  Possibly even as low as late
TL9 or early TL10.

Another area where telepathy will give a *definite* edge to the
Zhodani is in design work of work stations.

An Imperial designer, when laying out a cockpit of a fighter knows
that there is a Lot of data that has to be presented to the pilot.
The main danger of designing a cockpit (even one that the pilot can
customize) is swamping the pilot with data.  It is the most
difficult problem when designing cockpits.

Side note:  Yes, it can be done, you can easily get used to the 11
guages in a Cessna 152, but even that simple trainer aircraft can
look awfully daunting when you first try and learn to scan your
instrument panel.  I don\'t even want to think about how someone
would scan the panel of a Boeing 747!  I used to know an F-14
Jockey, when the early jets came out, there were some examples of
early jets that required the *full* time of the *full* crew
watching all the instruments just to keep the ship in the air!  (I
think the example he used was the A-3?)  If it had tried to go into
combat, no one would have been able to watch out for any enemies!

A Zhodani cockpit designer would *KNOW* how to present a lot of
data to a pilot\'s mind without swamping him.  Studies on how to do
just that would be thousands of years old by now and quite
perfected.  Zhodani data presentation inside the cockpit (and
outside for that matter) is *THE BEST* in the Traveller Universe.

Not many, and with the possible exception of Mora, look in Deneb.  
The Regency may be the most technically-advanced government after the
Collapse, but they were only a developing region beforehand, so
the infrastructure is a bit weak.  The Zhodani have a chance to
catch up, with their superior industrial strength.  Here\'s the
high-tech (TL 15 or 16) worlds in Deneb, selected using grep on
the TML files, circa 1118.

**TL 16**

Deneb
  Depot         1613 A100644-G  D Na Ni Va           220 Dd F9 II
  Vincennes     1122 A899AA6-G    Hi In Cp           113 Dd M7 V K1 V G1 V
  Pashus        1432 A232455-G  S Ni Po RsZ          812 Dd A9 V

Vincennes is the jewel of Deneb, and was visited in an issue of MTJ.
Note that the naval depot in Deneb is also tech level 16!  It was
smaller than the Corridor base, but more advanced in technology.

The Darrian Confederation has one world in the Marches at TL16,
Darrian, but its entire TL16 output goes to maintaining the TL16
infrastructure on the world -- standard of living is closer to TL12.
There may be a vargr world in Gvurrdon at TL16, but I forget who has
it.  I vaguely recall one from the old GDW Aliens module, coreward of
Aramis.

**TL 15**

Deneb
  Ansirk        1609 B100100-F  N Lo Ni Va           122 Dd F2 V
  Magash        0316 A400976-F  S Hi Na In Va Cp     824 Dd F8 V K7 III
  Starn         1417 B000996-F  S Hi Na In As RsB    722 Dd K0 V
  Imone         0826 A9C1555-F  N Ni Fl Cp           613 Dd M0 V
  Dekha         1128 C100A9A-F  S Hi Na In Va        210 Dd M6 V F3 V
  Bishop        1226 B201553-F  S Ni Va Ic           524 Dd M6 II
  HRD           1623 A401654-F  N Na Ni Va Ic        810 Dd M5 III
  Saguenay      0235 B438256-F  N Lo Ni              324 Dd M0 V
  Qevar         0731 A2326AE-F  A Na Ni Po Cp        403 Dd M6 V
  Jecife        1640 A439667-F  N Ni                 123 Dd F6 II

Plus a Dzarrgh Federate world and two client-states.

Spinward Marches
  Rhylanor      2716 A434934-F  A Hi Cp              810 Im M2 VI
  Mora          3124 AA99AC7-F  A Hi In Cx           112 Im M4 V
  Glisten       2036 A000986-F  A Hi Na In As Cp     821 Im K9 V
  Trin          3235 A894A96-F  A Hi In Cp           101 Im M0 V

That\'s right -- only four in the Marches.  (Surprise!)  Note that
one is Trin, and we all know what happened to Trin.  Ever wonder
why the Zhodani were obsessed with taking Rhylanor?  This is why.

Reft
  Lintl         0503 B739AEE-F    Hi Cp              404 Dd K2 VI

There are three more in Reft, but on the wrong side of the Great Rift.  

Trojan Reaches

None.  Tobia was, but the Aslan have it.  In fact, the Aslan have
five, the Florians two, and there is one droyne world and one
non-aligned world.

***********

That is it.  Most of those won\'t go up.  A very few might.
More likely that a tech 14 world will go tech 15, and on
down.

Also note that the Aslan colonies and the Domain are fairly
evenly matched.  The old Aslan colonies in Troy are solidly
tech 14.  As a rough estimate, note that the Aslan have
some 53 worlds at tech 13+ (avg. in this range is 13.7) and
the Domain has 70 at tech 13+ (avg. in this range is 13.9).
This doesn\'t take into account population or starport, so it\'s
a rough measure.  It\'s a good thing for the Domain that the
Zhodani will have trouble with Aslan encroachments on Foreven
to keep them both busy on another front.   Also, this only
counts Aslan worlds in Troy, not in other colonial sectors.

Deneb has a fair number of tech-14 worlds, so they aren\'t as
thin on technology as the above may make them look.

One sector, "Sigma Zephyrus", has no known location, but is probably 
eight or more sectors spinward of Core near Theta Borealis.  Its only 
mention is from a sidebar in DGP\'s TD #19, p. 25:
  "Years ago, Deneb was the original headquarters of the Scout Service\'s
   Group Program, which established exploration outposts at Geokha
   (Sigma Zephyrus 3210) and Pautho (Theta Borealis 1506), far beyond
   Imperial borders."

by Steve Bonneville                             30 April 1994

The following is a list of subsector names known in many of the 
sectors in charted space.  There are a fair number of holes in the
data which await filling.  The list is organized alphabetically by 
sector, and positionally within the sector, in the standard format.
Some sectors which may be "apocryphal" end the list in a separate 
section, out of order.  Magyar, in two different forms, is listed
in both places.  

Most info is from products.  Some information was gleaned from 
"official" sources available to the TML, such as the DGP-authorized
sector data on sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca.  (A handful only.)

Subsector names may change without warning after the Collapse!  The
list data is circa 1100.
Examples:  Massilia/A was Kerr is Ershur.           [DGP/GDW]
           Old Expanses/M was Nicosia is Aubaine.
           Old Expanses/N was Sarid is Oriflamme.
           Alpha Crucis/A was Ximenes is Lazzerton. [Sol. Rim]

The "Apochryphal":

These are sectors in which the "canonicality" of the data is 
questionable.  Name of the data\'s publisher follows the sector name.  
Reasons for being here are:

1) Paranoia Press.  All Paranoia Press materials were judged "non-  
   canonical" by GDW at about the same time as all Judges\' Guild  
   materials for Traveller were.  They published two sectors, "The 
   Beyond" (blue book) and "Vanguard Reaches" (gold book), and 
   subsector names for surrounding sectors comes from map margins.
   Both sectors appear on the positional map in DGP\'s canonical 
   "Solomani & Aslan", and the star positions do not match. (DGP\'s are,  
   IMHO, more interesting.)  Governments were moved around a bit, but 
   some of the names are similar (Duchy of Treyln in same place, Esylat 
   in subsector B instead of H).
2) Far Frontiers.  FASA held the "land grant", and their materials are 
   still considered fairly canonical.  The _Traveller Chronicle_ has  
   been printing subsectors recently, but note that they seem to reflect 
   Paranoia Press materials more than DGP\'s material, so it was left 
   here.  (This makes sense, since the FASA material was originally 
   developed at the same time as the Paranoia Press materials.)
3) Magyar.  DGP printed the Magyar sector library data and maps in 
   _Traveller\'s Digest_ #14, but unlike every other sector they printed, 
   this one had major consistency problems.  First, the subsector names 
   along the trailing edge of the sector did not match those in GDW\'s 
   _Solomani Rim_ supplement.  Second, the X-boat lines, as shown on the 
   map, cross the Solomani/Imperial border as if it weren\'t there.  The   
   star positions match those in DGP\'s later _Solomani & Aslan_ book.    
   This one could be squeezed into the canon if (1) Solomani subsector 
   names are different than Imperial subsector names in places, and (2) 
   the X-boat routes shown show the system as it appeared prior to 990, 
   when the Solomani Autonomous Region revolted.

Does anyone out there know if there\'s been an updated errata sheet
posted by GDW to GeNIE lately?  The last one I remember seeing was
released in July.  I know about the Upgrade Booklet, but I\'m just
looking for something in an electronic medium as well.  Plus, I also
liked the way there was commentary, and additional stuff thrown in that
GDW didn\'t pick up on.

Thanks in advance...

ships during the Final War, all infected with nasty strains of Virus. Now,
while most would have probably destroyed themselves by now, there would 
undoubtedly be some that survive - particularly the more advanced strains.
	So how about this for an idea - a few ships manage to jump WAY out
of Known Space in various directions, to arrive at OTHER vast, stable star-
spanning empires. And then proceed to screw up these ROYALLY by infecting
everything they see. I would think the natives of these other empires would
be most displeased by this, and might start to think about destroying the 
cause of the weird Virus that\'s just destroyed their billion-year Empire.
So, at some point in the future, the Imperium (probably just rebuilt) 
suddenly finds lots of big nasty fleets at all its borders, ready and 
raring to tear out its throat.
	The same sorta thing happenned in the Star Fleet Battles Universe
with the Seltorians and the Tholians (well, Ok, maybe it didn\'t, but the 
idea of chasing somebody over long distances is there...?!). Actually, for
all you Space 1999 fans out there (YAY!!!), one episode in the first (better,
IMHO) series called \'Voyager\'s Return\' actually is very similar to this.
	In that, a Voyager probe returned to the wandering Moon. Unfortunately
its propulsion system turned all the planets it passed into radiactive slag,
peeving the inhabitants no end. So, they sent out a fleet of ships to track
it down to its source at kill everyone there. Rather nice idea, I thought, and
I\'m sure you can see the similarity...

People were discussing inter-ship, etc. collisions some weeks back. I just 
saw in a newspaper (Sunday Telegraph 24/4/94), a short article about 
space-based kinetic weapons which included the following:

"Such a bomb could be an interstellar spacecraft the size of a cross-Channel 
ferry weighing 1,500 tons, which, to travel the vast distances between the 
stars, had been accelerated to 600 million miles per hour, a speed close to 
that of light. ... , if such a craft hit a planet at such a speed it would 
produce a blast 150 times more violent than a full-scale nuclear war and 
extinguish all life forms."

Of course, you\'ve got to get the ship up to that speed...

Even, "...two InterCity trains which are both travelling at 125mph and whose 
combined weight is 800 tons. The impact would cause an explosion equal to 
1.3 tons of TNT..."

Hope this interests someone.

I don\'t mind the world _as such_ (although I consider the mechanism used
for producing the change (ie. the Virus) to be ah... slightly unlikely...),
but I bitterly resent the fact that GDW abandoned the old setting to do
the change. That means that no more support material will be produced for 
the pre-Crash Imperium. I gather that GDW felt that the mass of background
material that had accumulated over the years intimidated potential new 
customers, and took this way of wiping the slate almost clean. That may
be so, but I, at least, feel differently about it. By it\'s very nature a
multi-planet science-fiction background represent a wealth of information
that the PCs should rightfully be able to get merely by looking it up in
a reference book. I know of no Referee who can afford the time and effort 
required to produce all that by himself. After 15 years I was just about
approaching having a minimum level of background information on a few 
areas in Spinward Marches  -  much of it produced by myself, but as much 
or more provided by outside sources  -  and now GDW has invalidated 80%
of it in one fell swoop. I now have the choice of dropping most of my
background info and follow GDW 80 years into the future (where I can 
logically look forward to having them dump me again when the new
collection of background information becomes intimidating to newcomers,
ie. when I begin to get some use out of it) or of dumping GDW and keep
playing in the pas with no more outside inspiration and help. Of the two
I choose the latter, but I\'m not happy to be forced to the choice.

The answer is: possibly a lot but propably not at all. Never forget (as is
so easy to do given our background as 20th Century Earthlings) that the 
TLs in Traveller are _economic_ (or sometimes social) indicators. Any
planet that is in contact with a high-tech planet has all the high-tech
_knowledge_ they want (ignoring for this argument the question of techno-
logical secrets and blockades  -  surely TL 15 knowledge is widespread 
enough Behind the Claw to be available _somewhere_). The problem is wether
they have the economic underpining to implement the technology. The
Sword Worlds were TL 11 1500 years ago. They\'ve been knocked down a bit 
once or twice during their history by wars  -  once below TL 9  -  but
they\'ve been TL 9+ for centuries. Why should a 70 year period of crisis
management (I\'m referring to the Quarantine) be conductive to economic
growth? Or perhaps it is  -  one might argue that a pseudo-wartime economy
would stimulate technological improvements. But then, the Sword Worlds
have frequently been on war footing throughout their history, and they
were still only TL 10-12 in 1120. And never forget that wartime economies
are not sustainable in the long run. Perhaps the Sword Worlds goes through
a regular cycle of booms and recessions with acompanying TL increases and
decreases?

On the starport improvements I agree completely. The concept of B starports
(as defined by the ability to construct starships) on TL 9+ worlds has
never made much sense to me. Presumably they are the result of economic
factors too.

If all you\'re comparing is TLs then you\'re right. But otherwise, no, the
Aslans colonies and the Domain are NOT evenly matched. At least, not if
we are to regard the old material about the Aslans as accurate. Because
the Aslan colonies are divided into 29 major and thousands of minor
\'principalities\' who are unable to combine the way the Regency can. That\'s 
why I\'ve never been able to swallow the Aslan invasions described in 
Megatraveller. Add the fact that the average _ihatei_ fleet spend a lot of
it\'s money on transports instead of fighting ships (after all, that\'s the
whole point of an _ihatei_ fleet) and that _ihatei_ are generally equipped
with obsolescent ships (that drops the effective TL a bit for a start) and 
I would undertake to defend Tobia with only the subsector forces of Tobia 
and Reft in 1116. Or, if through a whole series of monumental blunders some
Aslans had been allowed to get settled on a few Regency worlds, I would
undertake to take a Named Fleet and have them either kicked out or (more
likely) sworn, tax-paying citizens in a couple of years. And that\'s
without using a truly inspired idea for solving the problem that I came up 
with some years ago. 

Anyway, that the Aslans were allowed to put their paws on the whole south
bit of the Domain even for a short while surprised me. That they have been 
moved out of the Regency or turned into Regency citizens again by 1200 
surprises me not at all.

store (which I partly own :) only sold 1 copy of TNE.  To myself.
	But ever since TNE came out, we sold a lot of MegaTRaveller
material, including the boxed set, some adventures, etc.  It seems
that almost everyone (including myself :) were so put off by TNE that
they decided to stick with MT. 

	I think that what GDW should have done with TNE is put more
enphasis on characters and role-playing instead of game mechanics.
That seems to be the craze right now (just look at the White Wolf
games - simple mechanics but lots of role-playing/background).  And
the old Traveller fans who play it for the mechanics would have
changed/added their own rules anyway so whyy bother?  
	I say 1) Use GOOD art.  The \'techy\' header and footers are
really annoying and unnactractive.  The Star Wars art (Nuunis) really
looks like Star Wars, not Traveller.  As for the other drawings, hey,
even I can do better.  Please fire your art director or give him a
PGM-15 tan. 
	2) Put the emphasis on Role-playing, not combat. Traveller
players are and will always be \'sophisticated\' gamers who want more
than blowing up dozens of Vargrs or TED\'s all the time.  Theyy want
to do it some of the time. :)  Give us an alternative point-oriented
character generation.  Give us special character books (i.e. Marines,
Merchants, Scouts (what do you mean, the imperial scouts are dead?)),
special sourcebooks, etc.  
	3) Use a game system that doesn\'t make a super-hero out of
everyone.  Competent, yes, but surhuman?  Boring.  I know more people
who play Traveller (CT or MT) than Twilight 2000... So why switch to
the T:2000 system?  A point-based character generation system would
let players generate \'competent\' characters for Traveller, and \'Green
Berets\' for T:2000 if you give them more points.
	4) Hire a new art director. :)
	5) Please foolproof your products?

	These are my main gripes. :)  Oh, BTW, I bought TNE.  I feel
ill.  So I bought a copy of MT to replace the one I had permanently
borrowed from a friend.  Then I bought Space:1889.  I felt all better
again.  Is there a Space:1889 mailing list? :) I love it! :)
Sorry for wasting your bandwith. :)

Another thought, more for pocket empires and even the Reformation Coalition,
is based on the last (chronologically) Pern book by Anne McCafery.  _All The
Weyrs of Pern_ is about the Dragonriders (a neutral, more or less, defence
organization) finding an advanced, solar powered computer, buried in ash from
when Pern was originally colonized.  The conditions on Pern where rough enough
that they had lost all high technology and memory of it.  At the start, they
were only TL-1.  With the computers help they were able to advance up to a
firm TL-2 with some TL-3 besides having the use of some advanced Relic
technology.  By the Megatraveller Tech chart in the Referee\'s companion this
computer was TL-16.
 
The timeline for this TL change was only 10 years or so.  Some important
consideration were: A willing population.  The Dragonriders wanted to advance,
as did some of the craft halls.  Some were opposed but they were the minority.
The skills to make use of the knowledge: For example one crafthall was already
working on developing paper. The computer just gave them a better formulation.

Read the book for the details. It is well written, and the author gives credit
to those who helped with the tech details and even gives a disclaimer for the
short timespan for advancement.  The computer does not survive the book as it
had only one mission.  That was to save the planet at any cost.  This
directive was given to the computer a few thousand years previously by the
commander of the colony.  The computer was only using the people and the
dragons as a resource to achieve this end.  If they learned something from it,
then good, but it also did not want to alter the social and technical growth
of the colony.  So when it\'s end was achieved, it shut itself off, although
the inhabitants were left with working desktop computers plus the storage
devices.
 
So there it is... a popular science fiction example that pertains to parts of
our discussion.

Here in Pittsburgh, the TNE stuff seems to move pretty well. I had to 
wait over a month for FF&S because it was always sold out. I\'ve hardly
even seen Path of Tears on the shelves but Smash and Grab seems to be
selling pretty good. I have no idea whether new players are buying
TNE or if old CT fans like myself are buying into the new rules and
background.

Personally, I\'ve bought all the new rules; TNE, BL, and FF&S, but
none of the supplements that require the Virus; PoT & SaG. I plan 
to continue this policy with the possible exception of the Regency
sourcebook.

I\'d have to say that I can accept most of the rules changes. The 
bean-counting approach to G-turns and large crew requirements being
the only exceptions, mainly because they negatively (IMHO) affect
my campaign.

The background issue is a very personal subject for the returning 
traveller players and I don\'t think GDW can win on this issue. 
Some people will never accept the Collapse or the New Era that 
resulted. I\'ve looked at the backbround source books and found them
to be boring. Smash & Grab in the New Era is not my idea of fun. But,
I\'m willing to sit out the official GDW background until it becomes
suited to my tastes. In the meantime, I hope to run a campaign far 
from the borders established official background. 

If GDW wants to sell background materials to me they should:

(1) provide good adventure formats which would be easily adapted to
    any campaign.  With any of the old Adventures or Double
    Adventures although set in the third Imperium could be used in 
    nearly any setting. 

(2) A Regency sourcebook should be top priority. If I ever use the 
    GDW background again it will be behind the claw. Proper
    treatment of the Regency might reassure fans of the Spinward 
    Marches that they are important in the development of the TNE
    background. The most compelling reason for using the GDW
    universe in CT and MT was the idea of an multiple sector spanning
    *EMPIRE* capable of endeavors that smaller powers could only
    dream about.

(3) Get the TNS cranking out some useful information. If Virus
    is being fought in any part of known space I\'d like to know
    about it. Wholescale death and destruction can get pretty boring
    after too long. The Virus idea has been around for about a year 
    now and I find the virus infected TNS transmissions to be 
    insulting. 

    Ditto for Commodore Bwana. I have nothing against Dave Nilsen
    but this persona is annoying. I don\'t know if he thinks he\'s
    being clever or whati, but I don\'t want to read his articles.

On the other hand, if GDW hadn\'t nuked the third Imperium I wouldn\'t
have worked so hard to flesh out my own space. It is still ongoing,
but it has been fun. And, it\'s mine, do you hear me, all mine!

Mike Basinger (kin to Kim? :-) <dbasinge@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu> asks:

> 1. I know ALOT of people dislike T:TNE. Is it due to the system, or
> the world?

I dislike it for two main reasons.  The first is that I *really* liked
the Imperium campaign.  This has always been the most appealing aspect
of Traveller to me - the incredibly-well-developed campaign background.
I haven\'t messed with rules in more than a decade but I followed
the development of the campaign background from a few worlds in Regina
subsector to the entire Imperium and beyond - even if quality suffered
in the MegaTraveller era - intimately and with great eagerness.  From
the moment I read the last TNS news brief in the latest issue of *JTAS*,
and later *Challenge*, I *couldn\'t wait* for the next issue to arrive.
I picked up the Supplements - at least the `background\' ones, I never
bought *Animal Encounters* for example - as soon as they came out.  In
a sense I have *lived* in this world for the last fifteen years.

The Rebellion seemed to put much of this at risk initially but eventually
things settled down.  The Domain of Deneb was relatively stable and seemed
to be in good hands with the folks at DGP.  After a while I moved into
MegaTraveller and even ran a long-running pbm campaign based upon the
`Nail Mission\' in the *Rebellion Sourcebook*.

TNE takes all of this background, all of this history, and basically
throws it in the toilet.  The Imperium is gone, the Virus has wiped
the surface of most worlds clean, and I find myself in a situation
similar to that of the `imaginary\' folks in the Imperium campaign.  I
feel toward GDW as they must feel toward the Virus - except that I\'m
not `afraid\' of GDW and can hinder it\'s `spread\' merely by not buying 
it\'s products.

(And then of course there is the further point that I believe we established
several weeks ago here that TNE, from the point of view of background,
doesn\'t offer anything over what could have been done with a series of
`frontier\' sourcebooks and without destroying the Imperium.)

The second reason I dislike TNE is that I\'ve been through this process
of `new and improved\' evolution before and find it rather disingenious
the second time around.  I first entered the realm of role-playing with
the three little *D&D* books: "Men and Magic" (or "Characters and Combat"),
"Monsters" (or "Starships"), and "Wilderness Adventures" (or "Worlds and
Adventures").  This `evolved\' into the `new and improved\', wallet-grabbing
*"Advanced" Dungeons and Dragons* (or *MegaTraveller*) in full-format
books.  I had abandoned *D&D* for *Traveller* by the time the next iteration
appeared and I\'ve abandoned `official\' *Traveller* now that *TNE* has
appeared.  As I\'ve said here before, "Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool
me twice, shame on me."

> 2. What would people change in the current Traveller version?

For me, own up to the mistake, abandon the `New Coke\' of TNE, and bring
us Bobby(?- the Patrick Duffy character on *Dallas*) back in the shower.
I realize though, that this ain\'t gonna happen.  That\'s fine, but I ain\'t
gonna buy TNE either.

> I think GDW needs to do something to regain support of the people
> they lost

Not really, unless *TNE* really isn\'t selling and they *really* want to stay
in the *Traveller* business like they say.  Of course, it might be that we
`old timers\' weren\'t buying enough products to keep *Traveller* viable (but
anyone who has taken Marketing 101 will tell you where the solution to *that* 
problem lies) and that\'s what prompted the move to *TNE* in the first place.

> and maybe the T:TNE bashers need to be more understanding
> to change.

I disgree.  There is no *inherent* value in change - especially if it costs
me money to do so.  *TNE* forces me to abandon something I already like
without any commensurate improvement, IMHO.  So why be understanding?  Change
merely for the sake of change is called "chaos" - or poor marketing.  :^)

> Just comments (no flames please)

No flames intended.  I appreciate the opportunity to explain my view.  
(Sorry to all you folks who\'ve heard this before.  It\'s the first time
*I`ve* sounded off though.)

Peace,

Even if the Consulate has not been hit by the Virus.  What about the TAS
News items in *Survival Margin* from Esalin/Spinward Marches in 1119
that speculate about a rebellion (against psionic rule) or change of
gov\'t within the Consulate.  There is also evidence of Zho ships that
have "suffered tremendous battle damage" in addition to intel indicating
the withdrawal by the Zho of their newer, more powerful vessels.

Was the internal strife or were the Zhos attacked by forces unknown on
their non-imperial borders?  Is the rellion against psionic rule just
wishful thinking on the part of TAS or did the Zho masses decide to
broaden the definition of their democracy but overthrowing the psionic
nobles.  Possibly a new philosophy emerged within the Consulate that was
more willing to approach the Regency with hopes of cooperation.

Norris\' dealings with the Zhos are also intiguing.  He was willing to
open negotiations and cooperate with them as well as embrace the use of
psionics within the Regency - is it possible that he is half Zhodani
(even if he has no psionic talents)?

This is getting good!  REAL GOOD.  I\'ve really enjoyed the custom
gaming material and info-packed messages you Traveller-crazies
have posted to the TML lately.
 
Keep the material coming guys, and I\'ll bet even more TML\'ers
will see the light.  The more of us there are who chip in with
custom adventures, background info, rules subsystems, and gaming
ideas and examples, the more valuable will the TML become as a
gaming and campaign resource.  If each of us gives just a little,
the contributions will multiply, and the returns will be great!
Call it the "leverage of cooperative contribuation".
 
As for those who have been watching from the sidelines, come on,
join in on the fun!
 
 .   Don\'t be timid.
 
 .       Don\'t be shy!
 
 .           We might laugh, we might cry -- but that\'s the whole
            idea behind roleplaying!
 
If you do any ref\'ing at all, you must have some cool,
interesting, or fun ideas you\'ve tried out on your players.  We\'d
really like to compare notes!

teleportation booths they shall be transporting -- to emerge from
Jump Space on the Other Side.  Thankyou David.  Long live the

This is an excellent point but it is also one of the areas where those
dreaded rules will seep over into background.  Basically, all those 
inhospitable worlds in the Old Imperium (like the exotic atmosphere worlds
we discussed a while back) were a result of `poor\' world generation rules
that permitted large numbers of moderately- and highly-populated inhospitable
worlds.  There wasn\'t really any background rationale for this (say, an
Imperial colonization policy to expand habitation to inhospitable worlds).
In a sense, background rationale was a victim of rules.

Such may be the case with TNE as well.  [FACT ALERT: I don\'t have TNE!]
Rationale like Kevin\'s will take a back seat to whatever world generation
rules are published.

(In the Earth Colonies campaign, I\'ve modified the world generation rules
in an attempt to account for this.  Generation of the `natural\' UWP
factors - size, atmosphere and hydrosphere - is `biased\' toward hospitable
worlds; the rationale being that colonists will gravitate to such worlds.
Population is independent of `natural\' factors but is weighted toward
moderate population levels.  In addition to government and law level,
tech level is based upon population; the rationale being that people make
technological achievements, not automated facilities or import houses.
Starport class is generated *last* and is matrixed from population and
tech level.  Thus, lightly-populated `garden\' worlds and highly-populated
iceballs/hell-holes exist but are much less common - and therefore easier
to explain.  Low or unpopulated high tech/starport class worlds are also
less common - just as are international airports and `world-class\'
manufacturing plants in Antarctica and the Sahara.  I can post these
modified world generation rules if anyone is interested.)  Plug, plug.  :-)

This is another good question that, not having TNE, I can\'t answer.  I\'ve
assumed though that those worlds that were initially overrun by the *ihatei*
and have now been reclaimed by Deneb (to use Autonomist language) still
have their Aslan populations - they\'ve just been incorporated into the
Republic (to use New Democrat language).

I remember this.  By TNE LSP and Tukera Lines will be the only remaining
megacorp shipping lines in the Regency (to use Imperialist language).
What was left of Makhidkarun, Naasirka and Sharurshid after the withdrawal
of the Bureaux will certainly have withered with the onslaught of Virus.
Al Morai was a sector-wide line in the Marches and might be challenging
LSP, if not Tukera, in TNE.  I\'m not familiar with Sinzarmes but Oberlindes
Lines was a subsector-wide line in Regina that was expanding into Aramis.
The Vargr invasion was causing them problems.  There ought to have been
other subsector-wide lines in the Marches in places like Rhylanor, Mora,
Lunion, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil at least.  If I\'m not mistaken UTP was
just a fledgling line - just a few free traders - and Jamison Factors
was a single free trader.

There should be at least one sector-wide line in Deneb (we called it
Blue Star Lines - for the star Deneb - in my campaign) and several 
subsector-wide lines as well.

These are, at best, subsector-wide lines.

Especially in light of the *MTJ* article I would expect Vincennes to maintain,
and possibly increase, it\'s TL.  Such won\'t be the case for the other worlds.
With only two million people Depot\'s TL is clearly a result of import
technology which means it can be expected to *fall* when contact is
lost with the Imperial interior.  The same goes for the 80,000-person
Research Station at Pashus.

Low population means import technology to maintain the artificial biosphere
on this inhospitable world.  TL will probably fall.

the Imperial core can be expected to lead to a TL decrease.

300 people?  Clearly import technology or some sort of automated facility.
TL will most likely fall.

Low population suggests import technology or automated facilities used

probably fall.

Unless, of course, the Hold (to use Isolationist language) government
establishes a technological exchange policy between these worlds and
Vincennes.  If I were Archduke/Regent/Premier I would be spending every
science and technology and education tax dollar I had to send scientists
and engineers from Magash, Starn, Dekha, Rhylanor, Mora and Glisten to
study on Vincennes for a year or two.

Some good development work!

VIRUS

Probably the most difficult thing to deal with rationally.  For a game
that\'s gone so heavily into "hard science" lately, the Virus is anything
but.
  For instance:

  Given that the Virus spreads by communication (and a case for self-
  rewritable synaptic computers can be made here), I can deal with the
  wholesale infection of starships.  I can deal with the infection
  of world internets.  But a lot of isolated systems should have been
  missed.  A computer dedicated to controlling gravitic generators on
  a floating city or a gravitic air "dome" as on Luna should be totally
  isolated from outside networks -- there\'s too much chance for tom-
  foolery.

  Why the robot hysteria?  A master-slave system like the harvester that
  got Dulinor, that I can understand.  But independent \'bots that
  don\'t hook up to computers shouldn\'t be a danger unless somebody
  manually infects them.  And Virus can\'t spread by psionics because
  then it a) automatically infects everything and b) could possibly
  infect "living beings" like humans.  It\'d just take a while to
  figure out the protocols....  Further, a world like Vincennes in
  the Regency with its reliance on robotics and early TL17 in 
  robotics and communications would be *better suited* to understand
  Virus, so abandoning that technology would be silly.

  But apparently the indepedent systems were got too -- and they 
  shouldn\'t have been.  Especially if they were supposed to follow
  the guidelines on Virus that they wrote in TNE!

RULES

My biggest rules gripe is the new skill/asset confusion.  I\'d rather
see UPPs for NPCs and figure out their "assets" than risk confusion
between skill level and asset (skill + attribute) level.

My second biggest gripe is the difficulty in rolling up alien PCs.
(Always a problem in Traveller, actually -- it\'s so humanocentric, 
but has some good aliens.)  Right now you can either "reverse
engineer" them from the NPC templates (with some difficulty), or
use old rules if you can find them and convert them with _Survival
Margin_.  Or, if you have PoT, play a Schall.  PC generation rules
run about a page.

Also, the UWP for population is seriously screwed up for TNE.  In
Traveller, it seems to have represented citizens of the local 
government.  Which means it often misses local aliens.  For instance,
published material says there is a tech-0 vaccuum living alien race
on Thorell/Aubaine, but there is no way to see this since the UWP 
reflects the destroyed Imperial interdiction station and claims the 
world is barren.

For the most part, of course, the rules aren\'t the problem.  Especially
if they don\'t change them *again* anytimne soon.

BACKGROUND

IMHO, GDW will have to advance the history quickly to keep people
interested.  And once we get out of the Solomani-dominated
Diaspora and Old Expanses, we\'ll have to see what\'s become of the
old Imperial cultural regions and alien races, human and non-human.


DIGRESSIONS

On an unrelated note:

In the TNE rulebook, there are several subsector-sized ppocket
empires shown connecting the RC and the Hive Federation *which is
shown as fairly intact* (from what we can see of it).  What are
they?  Hiver bases?  Small versions of the RC?  Does the RC even
know about them?  One seems to be placed in the Hinterworlds in
such a way as to include the Leenitakot "ringworld" formerly held
by the xenophobic Outcasts of the Whispering Sky.  Wonder what\'s
up.

weeks to get it; the distributor kept running out. Since I bought it and have
been running it, three others in my gaming group have also done so. One of them
is a Traveller fan from the early days; he owns mint condition copies of allof
GDW\'s products for the original game. He refused to buy MegaTraveller because
he was mad that they killed Strephon. He likes the background ideas behind TNE
and really likes the new rules system.

> I know A LOT of people dislike T: TNE. Is it due to the system or the world?

First, it seems that a lot of people ON THE TML don\'t like TNE. The TML is a
small sample compared to the total number of Traveller fans in the world. We
don\'t know how many of them like or dislike TNE.
   From what I\'ve been able to tell, most people that dislike TNE seem to do so
because of the changes made in the background of the Traveller universe. There
are those who don\'t like the new system, of course; there are some things about
the new system that I don\'t care for. There were MORE things about the older
system that I didn\'t care for, so I feel the new rules are an improvement.
(More on that later). Unless they\'re too complex or unplayable, rules systems
don\'t mean that much to me. Background is much more important.
   A fair number of people here seem to dislike TNE because of the death of the
Third Imperium. Interesting, since it wasn\'t the Virus which killed the 3I; it
was the Rebellion. Hard Times and the Arrival Vengeance adventure make it
pretty clear that the Imperium was dead. Lucan\'s Imperium wasn\'t legitimate;
he kept the Moot from meeting to confirm him (which they would not have) and
killed his own brother to get the throne! When he did that, the Third Imperium
as such ceased to exist. The Domain of Deneb, in attitude at least, might be
the last remnant of the Imperium and it still exists.
   Changes in technology bother some people. They point to the removal of the
Thruster Plates and the alterations in space missles as being "not Traveller as
we knew it". That\'s right I suppose. And I agree that the changes were probably
unneccesary, at least from the missles standpoint. I myself don\'t care about
such details. Having played BRILLIANT LANCES many times now, I can testify that
ships still get hurt real bad when "hit" by a missle. HEPlar drives cause a bit
more concern to some of my players; they\'re worried about running out of fuel
during a battle. In 12 games of BL this has not happened yet.

>What would people change in the current Traveller version?

 I would alter the hit point formulas; characters can take WAY too much damage
for a game that\'s supposed to be at least somewhat realistic. (My players, by
the way, disagree with this, And we DID have a fatality in our last session...)
I would give lasers a 1-2-3 penetration rating and forget about "realistic"
lasers; this is science FICTION, after all. People have certain expectations
about SF, and one of them is that lasers are effective weapons. I would fix the
rules for autofire weapons; Impossible difficulty at all ranges really annoys
me. Almost every other game I\'ve ever seen with autofire weapons allows you to
direct shorter bursts at a single target,and this often IMPROVES your chance to
hit. This may not be realistic, but it again falls under the heading of
expectations.
   And finally, if I were in charge at GDW, I would give SERIOUS thought to
putting a Third Imperium sourcebook on the schedule for fourth quarter 1994
or early 1995, and/or a Regency sourcebook. This would help out those who still
want to play their Traveller in a large empire setting. GDW does not have to
support an Imperium sourcebook; this can be done in Challenge or even in other
gaming magazines if need be (unless GDW turns into Palladium, which I don\'t see
happening). But it would be helpful to older players who wish to keep playing
in the old universe, and to new ones who don\'t know the rich history which the
new game is built on.
           All oif this is my opinion, of course.

Certainly there is! For those who aren\'t aware of what topical interest
mailing lists currently exist on the periphery of this list (which tries
to hit the generic Traveller interests), here\'s the appropriate section
from the TML Orientation Message.  BTW, if you have updates/additions to
this list, please let me know!

TOPIC COORDINATORS

There are also more special addresses to send items to the mailing list.
This is because people wanted to start "special interest groups" for
certain topics:

Traveller EPBM Referee: pbemref@engrg.uwo.ca (Mark Cook and metlay)
	Richard Johnson began refereeing a Traveller Electronic
	Play-by-Mail game, where players are crewmembers aboard the ISR
	Alcyon, on a mission to research a newly-discovered Ringworld.
	Mark Cook and metlay took it over. They periodically keep the
	TML at large informed of game happenings. There are a whole
	family of mailing-list style aliases at the engrg.uwo.ca site,
	to aid characters in routing PBEM mail - for details, contact
	pbemref. The game is usually suspended May through September.
	Note that the engrg.uwo.ca address actually forwards mail to
	their real mailboxes: markc@cv.hp.com, and metlay@netcom.com.

Compter-Aided Traveller "CAT": richard@agora.rain.com (Richard Johnson)
			       dan@engrg.uwo.ca (Dan Corrin)
	CAT members discuss how computers can be used as RPG aids in
	playing Traveller, including automated character & star system
	generation.  This list is distinct and mostly seperate from the
	TML.  Please mail to BOTH addresses to be added, as Richard is
	topic coordinator and Dan maintains a redistribution mail alias,
	cat@engrg.uwo.ca.

Traveller Done Right "TDR":
	THIS LIST IS CURRENTLY DEACTIVATED. If you have specific
	questions about TDR, please send E-mail directly to metlay
	(metlay@netcom.com) and/or Mark Cook (markc@cv.hp.com).
	Discussion on rule changes to Traveller, MegaTraveller, and
	Traveller:TNE rules currently should be directed to the TML.
	(TML thanks Mark Cook for the above statement).

2300AD: ftavares@ptearn.fc.ul.pt (Pedro A C Tavares)
	Pedro is interested in keeping those with interest in 2300
	together, and reports to the TML occasionally if there\'s any
	interesting material. Write him if you\'re especially interested
	in 2300.

TNE-Pocket: tne-pocket-request@ocf.berkeley.edu (George Herbert)
	George and Guy Garnett (aka Derek Wildstar) have a working group
	to flesh out a pocket empire for Traveller: The New Era. The
	location is the Aoreriyya region (subsectors J, K, M, and N) of
	Reavers\' Deep sector, and the time is 1200 - the dawn of GDW\'s
	"New Era". This is quasi-official work being done with the
	knowledge of GDW. Members of this list are expected to
	contribute regularly. Periodic reports of goings-on are posted
	to the TML, and complete archives are available by FTP from
	ocf.berkeley.edu in the directory pub/Traveller/TNE-pocket.

Space 1889: space-1889-request@mit.edu (Matt Goodman)
	Matt has started a mail list to discuss GDW\'s Space 1889 game,
	which is unrelated to Traveller, but as it\'s a GDW game, it\'s of
	interest to several TMLers.

If you cannot reach these people, send the mail to traveller-request and
I will gladly manually forward mail to them.

Aw, shucks, Rodge. Back in 1987 I just wanted to see if anyone
remembered the old Traveller black books I played with in the early 80s,

Whew!  It\'s been over a month since my last installment.  It
didn\'t feel like that long ago.  Well, I better get a move on.
Without further ado...
 
For those of you new to the TML, this is a continuation of the
telling of one of the adventures I ran my Traveller players
through earlier this year.  It is loosely based upon the movie
"Invasion of the Body Snatchers", and takes place on the planet
Junidy in the Aramis subsector of the Spinward marches, backdated
to the year 1053 IR.  Episodes #1 and #2 are contained in TML
messages #7007 (BUN 557) and #7072 (BUN 563) respectively.
 
A couple of weeks ago, in an effort to prompt you guys into using
the TML as a central Traveller material-swapping depot, I
promised to upload some NPC\'s to get the ball rolling.  Instead,
I shall go one step further and post the PC\'s who partook in this
adventure.

and pathological lying at an early age.  He eventually grew out
of these short-sightted compulsive drives, but they developed into
an overriding disregard for the law, and aspirations to make big
money the fast way:  By cheating.  By being caught and punished
so many times in his youth, he learned the value of truth, and
the importance of the reputation that came with telling it, or
in his case, selling it -- To whomever was willing to pay.
Unfortunately, even though he had saved up quite a nest egg, he
was still a small-time operator.

Background:  It didn\'t seem natural to him, life as a civilian.
He had been on the force for most of his life, and now that he
was retired, he felt empty.  He missed the excitement and the
sense of fulfillment it gave him.  He was considering opening his
own private detective agency, but that would probably turn out to
be mostly on-line missing-persons work.  He longed to be young
and on the force again.
 
 
 
 
 
 
                        Episode Three
                        ----
 
It felt like forever before the elevator arrived.  As the door
opened, Baraka had the overwhelming fear that one of those things
would be inside...  But the elevator was empty.  With a sigh of
relief, Baraka buried himself into one corner of the tiny room.
When the doors closed, Baraka became quite conscious that he was,
for the moment, trapped -- just like in his apartment.  As the
elevator descended, Baraka\'s stomach entered his throat.  He was
still queezy from his ordeal, but he had nothing left to give.
He took a couple deep breaths, and afixed his compressor mask.
 
When the elevator stopped, and the doors began to open, Baraka
once again was overwhelmed by the thought of another one of those
humanoid monsters leaping through the doorway at him.  As the
doors parted, he could see someone standing there.  Baraka
dropped his brief case, and fumbled for his his utility pouch.
Grasping his body pistol tightly in both hands, he lunged forth,
and aimed it point blank at the creature\'s face.  "DIIIIIIIE!" he
screamed at the elderly woman dressed in a pink jumpsuit.  It was
Mrs. Bluutz, the building manager, and she was looking rather
shocked with fear at the moment.
 
Baraka melted, then winced.  Feeling like an idiot, he quickly
hid his gun behind him.  "Uh, sorry maam... Uh, sorry about that.
I, I\'ve had a rough day."  Pretty sure he was going to lose his
apartment, he left her standing there in shock and made his way
to the building\'s main airlock.  Ten paces later, he stopped,
turn around shaking his head in disgust, and went back past Mrs.
Bluutz into the elevator.   The landlady just stood there, her
mouth wide open and silent, glaring at him with wide open fearful
eyes, as Baraka retrieved his briefcase and departed once again
for the nearest airlock.
 
Since the atmospheric pressure outside was not enough to sustain
human life (though llellewelolly found it quite adequate), most
buildings were pressurized and thus had airlocks.  As the doors
opened, Baraka overcame the urge to draw his gun again.  He had,
in a very short period of time, aquired an acute fear of doors.
Doors sealed you in, and you never knew what was on the other
side.  At least not anymore.  He reluctantly entered the chamber,
and as he waited for the air to thin, his mind raced.  "What if
the streets are crawling with those things!?" he thought.  The
outer doors opened, but people were passing on the walkway
outside normally enough.
 
Baraka hurried along the sidewalk.  Finding a public phone was
easy.  Because of the dangers posed by the its atmosphere,
Junidy\'s cities had emergency pressure-booths placed at intervals
of every 150-feet on boths sides of the street, so you never had
to go further than about 75-feet in the event your
compressor-unit failed.  Each pressure-booth had a communicator,
and therefore performed the dual duty of comm-booth.  For
comm-users, it was mandated by law that you must exit a
pressure-booth for someone in atmospheric distress, unless you
were in the same trouble yourself.
 
Baraka went no more than 150-feet before he found an empty booth.
He entered and shut the door.  The comm-unit\'s vidscreen
prominently displayed the following message:  "Please wait for
booth to pressurize before disengaging your air supply.  For
emergency pressurization, press the Enter key."  A second or two
later, the unit\'s rather aluring female simvoice repeated the
same message.
 
As he waited for the air to thicken, Baraka sighed and leaned up
against the back wall of the booth and casually looked around.  It
was weird - there wasn\'t a daddy-longlegs in sight.  Then he
noticed a man walking by who was staring at him intently, not
breaking eye-contact until he was completely passed. "What the
fuck\'s your problem?!"  Baraka yelled, knowing the man probably
couldn\'t hear him anyways, since he was inside an air-tight
booth, and the voice amp in his mask was turned off.  Then he
shook his head in disgust. "Asshole."
 
At that moment, he noticed a vargr walking by.  As was often the
case with aliens, he couldn\'t tell if it was male or female.  He
was glad vargr had to wear compressors just like everybody else
(except dandies) -- fights with the wolf-like beings could get
pretty nasty, but the face masks served as defacto muzzles.  It
too stared at him intensely.  Baraka looked down to see if his
weapon was exposed.  No, it was safely hidden inside his utility
pouch.  He reflexively checked his jumpsuit for foodstains.
Nothing.  He looked at his reflection in the vidscreen to check
his hair.  It was fine, but he noticed a smeer of green on his
neck.  He began to wipe it off as he looked up.
 
The vargr had passed, but now there was a middle-aged lady
standing only a couple of feet away to one side of the
transparent booth, her two beady little eyes staring out over her
air mask and straight into his eyes.  Baraka was beginning to
feel trapped again.  There was a loud DING as the vidscreen
displayed the message:  "Pressurization complete.  Deposit
credcard, or press 9-1-1 for emergency service."  Startled, Baraka
convulsed as if he had received an electric shock.  Noticeably
shaken, he stared back at the strange woman, looking more than a
little nervous.  She was expressionless, and was looking right
through him.  He held up his credcard, to show her he was about
to make a call.  He flicked his voiceamp switch and yelled, "Go
to the next one lady!"  She didn\'t move. The vidcomm spoke,
"Pressurization complete. Deposit..."
 
Baraka noticed a couple other people walking by who were staring
directly at him as well.  Not inquisitive glances, but intense
blank stares.  He muttered, "To hell with this!" and pressed the
Esc key on the commconsole.  The vidscreen displayed the message,
"Depressurizaton about to begin, please re-engage your air
supply.  Press Enter when ready."  Baraka did.  The voice came on
and annoyingly repeated the message.  Baraka had always wondered
if the voice was modeled after a living woman or designed from
scratch.  He often fantasized about meeting her, but that was the
last thing on his mind at the moment.  He just wanted to get the
hell away.
 
Baraka kept an eye on the lady as he waited, but glanced around
sporadically to make sure he wasn\'t surrounded.  After what
seemed like ages, the bell sounded again, and the door finally
opened.  The cowardly snitch ran down the street, holding his
briefcase clutched up against his chest.  His compressor was not
self-adjusting, so he reached up with his semi-free hand and
cranked it up a bit, to accomodate his increased physical
activity, turning one of the knobs on the side of his mask.  As
he gained some distance, he could have sworn he heard a scream
in the background.  He turned off his voiceamp to muffle his
heavy breathing.
 
After jogging several blocks, Baraka resumed walking.  He glanced
around nervously, and eyed people suspiciously as they walked
past.  He had entered the central district.  There was much more
traffic and many more people out and about.  Baraka continued
walking, taking it all in.  Things seemed back to normal.  After
several minutes, his fear having subsided, he tried to think
things through.  Was his imagination running wild?  Or was he
just being paranoid?  He almost shot his landlady for freaking\'s
sake. "No."  He thought to himself.  "I was attacked by something
not from this world.  Maybe assassins from some distant planet, I
don\'t know.  But they looked human, and people just don\'t melt
when they die."  Baraka started to feel light-headed.  He reached
up and turned his mask\'s airflow back down to normal.  His
thoughts resumed.  "No. It was real, alright.  People were
staring for no reason.  That woman."
 
Baraka stopped at the next pressure booth, but then thought
better of it and continued on.  He wasn\'t about to trap himself
again.  But that was going to be a problem.  Society on Junidy
was based on structures which confined people, or rather, which
held in the air they needed to breath, or took them from place to
place or floor to floor.  He walked across the street, which was
bumper-to-bumper with electrocars (petroleum-based fuel was
prohibited by the Air Preservation Acts).  He headed in the
direction of the Galaxia Deluxe, to use the vidcomms there.
 
Baraka began talking to himself.  "Hold on.  Who\'s going to
believe this shit?"  he asked outloud, his worried voice muffled
by his air mask.  "No one ever believes them in the movies, but
they always tell anyways.  Idiots!  I\'m not going to get locked
up.  I\'m keepin\' my mouth SHUT.  Waitasec.  Except for
\'Ghostfiends from Hell\'.  Now that movie made sense.  Yeah, Jorga
Porshe was cool.  The guy actually had brains.  It was my
favorite line too. \'If it sounds so crazy that you have a hard
time believin\' it even after seeing it with your own two eyes,
then never tell a living soul until you can prove it with
conclusive physical evidence.\'  I love his movies.  When someone
stands out in the open, they got shot, plain and simple.  Just
like it should be."
 
Baraka stopped himself from wandering further from the critical
issue.  "The bodies.  The bodies are proof.  But what if they\'re
just immigrants from some weird-ass planetoid?  Waitasec.  What
am I talking about?  There are no bodies; they\'re mush.  I better
get rid of the mess.  Screw that, I\'m not going back there.  Big
Eddie\'s after me.  Either Big Eddie wants me dead, or he\'s one of
them, in which case he still wants me dead.  Or maybe he just
wants to eat my brain or something, in which case he still wants
me dead.  I\'ve got money, I\'m getting off this rock."
 
If only it was that simple.  Baraka knew that the reach of
well-financed criminals like little shit-head Eddy extended well
beyond their homeworld\'s orbit.  With just a photo and a few
credits for enticement, bounty hunters could pretty easily track
you down by bribing a customs clerk to run a visual comp on local
emmigration records.  Plus, they had many other tricks.  He
wouldn\'t be safe until Big Eddie was dead.
 
There was only one person he could trust who might handle this.
Baraka continued on his way, passing comm-booth after comm-booth,
intent on making his call from the Deluxe.  How the hell he was
going to talk him into it, he had no idea.

 VIRUS: It is reasonable to assume that many worlds were not touched by the
Virus per se; I beleive there is a world like this in Path of Tears. Most
worlds which were low tech level (perhaps 7 or lower) and habitable probably
didn\'t feel the effects of the Virus itself, since their computer technology
would not have been advanced enough. What WOULD hurt them was the extreme
slow-down of interstellar trade. It is implied throughout Traveller that the
Imperium wanted planets to economically dependant on it. Many worlds imported
high-tech items which became relatively important to the functioning of their
society which would suddenly have become unavailable with the crash of the
Imperium. A lot of worlds had simply become too dependent on the Imperium.

 As for the scientific plausibility of Virus: yes, you\'re right. It is blatant
"rubber science", as bad as Jump drives, contra-grav lifters and artificial
gravity. It\'s also a plot device; a way to get from there to here. Robots can
be infected through radio communications systems, just like ships and other
computers. Robots which were completely self-motivating and had no need of
computer direction were fairly rare in the Traveller universe, or so I have
been led to beleive.

NPC\'s

> I\'d rather see UPP\'s for NPC\'s and figure out their assets...

  The major NPC\'s in Smash and Grab are written up this way. I do this for
important NPC\'s and use templates for cannon fodder types.

ALIENS

  It takes time to develop and write game supplements.especially when you are
dealing with other things such as lawsuits, and trying to get work done on
other games AND publish a magazine, and your staff isn\'t that large. There is
a book announced called "Aliens of the Rim". When they start developing the
Regency, I\'m sure we\'ll see "Aliens of the Regency" or some such thing.
 It would be really nice if GDW would at least tell us whether they will ever
detail the Regency and if so, approximately when. But they don\'t have to do
this. It will happen some day; GDW at least claims to be interested in making
money. and they won\'t miss the chance to sell you a book! :)

Not really, unless *TNE* really isn\'t selling and they *really* want to stay

I disgree.  There is no *inherent* value in change - especially if it costs
me money to do so.  *TNE* forces me to abandon something I already like
without any commensurate improvement, IMHO.  So why be understanding?  Change
merely for the sake of change is called "chaos" - or poor marketing.  :^)

I had recognized your point that variance in tech levels suggests some
sort of sociological reason - as opposed to technological - behind the
tech levels but I hadn\'t considered the fact that Sword Worlds technology
had been relatively stagnant and yet still varied from world to world.
This does tend to suggest that an increase might not occur in the 80 years
to TNE.

I agree with this point as well.  If the Frontier Wars haven\'t induced 
technological advance one doubts Virus will - especially since the Sword
Worlds aren\'t on the front line.

Well, maybe, but that still doesn\'t explain the *variance* in tech levels
from world to world within the Confederation - especially since it was
suggested in the *JTAS* "Contact" article on the Sword Worlds that they
were very homogenous - at least to outsiders.  One would expect then some
similarity in technological achievement.  Without it, one wonders why
Sacnoth, at tech level 12, hasn\'t come to dominate the Sword Worlds long
ago.

(I suspect that this is once again merely a matter of the world generation
rules intruding into the background but any rationales - not just opinions -
to the contrary are appreciated.)

Some thoughts on the Sword Worlds in TNE.  I\'ve started with Rebellion-era
stats and made modifications with some of the following ideas in mind.

Rebellion-era *ihatei* invasions of District 268 resulted in large numbers
of refugees moving into the `Metal Worlds\' along the rimward edge of the
Sword Worlds.  These barren worlds were prime candidates for refugees fleeing
the encroaching Aslan.  This sort of immigration was further enhanced by
strict controls on the Imperial borders in Lunion subsector.

Later, as the *ihatei* moved into 268, these same worlds would have drawn
their attention.  Ultimately, the Confederation was forced to cede Steel
in order to halt further Aslan moves into the Sword Worlds proper.

On top of this crisis came the onslaught of Virus.  The Confederation was
spared the brunt of the Virus assault due to the buffer of Deneb but the
subsequent rapproachment between Deneb and the Zhodani left the Sword Worlds
`out in the cold\'.

In response to these challenges business as usual had to change in the Sword
Worlds.  No longer could the various worlds afford to bicker among themselves
and efforts were made to enhance the central government.  Technological
exchange programs were launched to spread technological capabilities across
the Sword Worlds.  Class A starports, with their associated shipyards, were
constructed at several worlds.

Internal immigration was encouraged in order to further equalize capabilities
across the Confederation.  Population increased from legal immigration from
Diatrict 268 as well.

Earth Colonies Sphere
Sphere diameter of 100 cyr (31 pc) includes 529 worlds.  Average stellar
density is 0.035, giving an average of 25 systems per subsector (720 cu. pc). 
Undiscovered systems must be beyond 15 pc from Earth/Sirius 1720.19.

#012#Jump Distance Tables
Method 1: Determine the absolute values of the differences in hex coordinates
(i.e. |X1-X2|, |Y1-Y2|, and |Z1-Z2|) and arrange them in numerical order from
lowest to highest, then consult the table below:
	D1	D2	D3	Distance
	0	0	1	1
	0	0	2	2
	0	0	3	3
	0	0	4	4
	0	1	1	1
	0	1	2	2
	0	1	3	3
	0	1	4	4
	0	2	2	3
	0	2	3	4
	0	2	4	4
	0	3	3	4
	1	1	1	2
	1	1	2	2
	1	1	3	3
	1	1	4	4
	1	2	2	3
	1	2	3	4
	1	3	3	4
	2	2	2	3
	2	2	3	4

Method 2: An expansion of Method 1 that does not require the delta values to
arranged in numerical order:
	DX	DY	DZ	Distance
	0	0	1	1
	0	0	2	2
	0	0	3	3
	0	0	4	4
- -and so on.  This table would be three times as long as Table 1.

Method 3: Determine the distance on the X-Y plane of the map and the absolute
value of the differences in Z-coordinates (i.e. |Z1-Z2|) and consult the table
below:
	DXY	DZ	Distance
	0	1	1
	0	2	2
	0	3	3
	0	4	4
	1	0	1
	1	1	1
	1	2	2
	1	3	3
	1	4	4
	2	0	2
	2	1	2
	2	2	3
	2	3	4
	2	4	4
	3	0	3
	3	1	3
	3	2	4
	3	3	4
	4	0	4
	4	1	4
	4	2	4

All tables only consider distance up to jump-4, the limit for TL13.  Table 1
can be used to calculate distances from hex locations without the use of a map.
 Table 2 is a longer version of Table 1 but requires less arithmetic.  Table 3
can only be used in conjunction with a map.

While they seem to have been stagnant in the past, the challenges of 
surviving through to the New Era might wake them up. This seems to be 
suggested by David Johnsons write up (which I liked, BTW). I don\'t see why 
you can\'t be optimistic and use the higher of the suggested tech level 
increases, and have SACNOTH go up to TL 13.

perhaps some of you noticed one aspect of character generations, added to TNE.
I\'m refering to the aspect of surface gravity as an influence to the characters
strength and constitution. I found a rule to determine the surface gravity of
a planet in the system generation section of the TNE rulebook. It essentially
says: Surface gravity depends on planet size and its average density.

There is a dice table to determine the density of the planet. So no problem
here, ...but...there is no entry for average density in the Universal World
Profile. What I\'m searching now are suggestions, where to add this - not so
unimportant fact - in the UWP.

Suggestions are welcome. At the moment I add the letters "L", "M", "H" to
the world profile. The position is next to the techlevel code, before the
base code.

Bertil, you\'re making a mistake that is one of my pet hates in Traveller:
You\'re assuming that everything produced on Earth in a particular period
of time belongs to one specific tech level. IMO that \'TL to period 
equivalence\' table is a good rule-of-thumb but a terrible rule. It has
been pointed out time and time again that there are computers made today
that is equivalent to TL 10 or 11 or whatever  -  at least according to
the Traveller tables. "How can that be when Earth is only TL 8? We can\'t
make jump drives yet!" Simple: Earth today is TL 8 wrt. space tech but a
lot higher wrt. computers and robots.

A was bashing TNE for a while and decided that it wasn\'t worth my

any new TNE materials.  I\'d much rather spend my money on cellular

That really depends on which copy of the rules you mean ;-)

Assuming you have the latest mods, Loren Wiseman (from GDW) has
said here and in other places (it was in Challenge too, I think)
that the penetration numbers only applied to hard armor: combat
armor, battle dress, flak jackets with plate inserts, etc.

Lasers should ignore all other armor.

Why is the penetration so low?  Frank and Dave did alot of 
research into lasers, and decided that this was more realistic.  It
also brings it in line with Fire, Fusion, and Steel.

This, along with the other replies I\'m certain we\'ll see, should
clear this up.  I can point you to the text in various places

Obviously, FF&S has done something at least a bit wrong (surprise, surprise!).
One advantage I would note about DE weapons, however, is that you do not have 
to find your ammo carrier after firing 40 rounds!

It seems to me that a TL 11 or 12 Tank-Mounted laser _should_ be capable of
greater penetration than a respectable-sized TL 8 CPR gun!  And at TL 14 we 
should be seeing a significant difference.  I am do not have any rules in front 
of me at the moment, can anyone comment?

I created the message numbers. :-) I agree with your disappointment in

Scott Kellogg is quiescent lately (although he\'s got quite a armful to

Subject: Re: Pocket Empire Ideas

I like the idea about the Terrafroming business.  I once wrote a Qbasic 
program that generated worlds.  Based on some desirable characteristics
(size,orbit, hydro) there was a probability that It had been terraformed 
by someone in the past, Imperium, early settlers.  A probability was 
established that would then effect air,water,atmos, etc..you get the idea.
I actually think Megatraveller is a great game, in fact I got my own 
introduction to traveller through MT.  I only played or GM\'d about 3 
campaigns in MT and so never really developed any attachment to it.  
Certainly I agree that the MT background is superior to that of TNE but I 
also argue that the scope of MT is too broad to be meaningful anyway.  
While the Traveller player is certainly above average, most people do not 
think on this level.  Ultimately its up to the GM and players.  I 
understand how some people feel abandoned, their Great Imperium stolen 
from them and maybe the transition from MT to TNE is a bit contrived.  In 
fact I considered setting this campaign in the MT background but for no 
real reason I didnt.

Incidentally, for the people who haven\'t figured it out, there\'s 
several good reasons why there is no Regency sourcebook for TNE
yet.

1)  The Regency is huge and complicated.  A lot of published material
    exists which involves the area.  Any reasonable sourcebook on
    the Regency will therefore also be big and complicated and...

2)  A lot of work to write it.  Especially considering the other 
    important projects to get out the door.  RC set-up and support.
    (Yes, despite many opinions on TML, this is important.)  The
    Brilliant Lances Express rules.  Long-term preparation for
    upcoming stuff -- the history will get ever more interesting
    as TNE develops, and to get stuff out in a timely way, they
    have to start now.

3)  Later usefulness in the plot of the Regency.  Think about it.

Personally, I\'d rather see other materials come out first rather than
have a *bad* sourcebook or nothing for a long time, stagnating sales
of Traveller and cutting off the game at the ankles.

Besides, for people who don\'t like the current future history, this
gives you a chance to tell GDW what you don\'t like so they can fix
it for the later stuff without "causing too much damage".

Patience, folks.  For now, you can make it up as you go!

Seconded.  Pointing out minor rules problems is one thing.  Bitching and
moaning about TNE is another, less useful thing.  I admit to my fair
(unfair?) share!  But get real, people -- TNE is here.  If it goes away,
any perceived problems notwithstanding, it would be a Bad Thing (tm).
It would be stupid for GDW to abandon a new system, especially since
it\'s basically two of the old systems.

Not that I\'d like to see people stop pointing out problems with the rules.
We need to know about those.  But it would be nice if people would relax
a little about all this -- after all, the Traveller Police won\'t stop
you from changing the rules you don\'t like to something better.

Meat thrown to the rules lawyers:  there\'s some interesting minor changes
to the anagathics/aging rules in TNE, in particular in regard to progression
down the aging table.  Under the new rules, while using anagathics, you
still progress down the aging table.  Personally not sure whether I\'ll 
use it that way or use the MegaT interpretation yet.

This is true only on the cutting edge of technology, which for most worlds
in the former Imperium (and all worlds in the Regency) is 16. Even if you
assume that the newest discoveries are kept secret that still means that
anything up to TL 15 is a question of economics: Can you afford to build
and maintain the industry for a given TL. And that is mostly a matter for
the "historian" to decide, at least in a campaign background like the
Imperium where the economic information we have is very scant. So if you
want a world to advance from TL 5 to 15 in 70 years, make it so. If you
want to drop them from 15 to 5, make it so. Use what GDW tells you or make 
up what you think is reasonable.

Peter H. Brenton <pete@biochem.uchicago.edu> replied to a FF&S
comment that at any tech level projectile weapons far outclass DE
weapons as Anti-Tank Weapons.
 
I would have to agree that a TL-8 projectile weapon will be
outclassed by a TL-11 + energy weapon.  But to compare the two
together at the same tech level I would think that the projectile
weapon would cause more damage.
 
I say that on the basis of having played Centurion, a grav tank
board game by FASA that I found very playable and fairly
realistic.  Vehicles have a variety of weapons mounted as they
each achieve different results.  Using various types of shells you
can achieve different effects on the enemy armor. Lasers give a
straight line penetration. And missiles are similar to shells but
more powerful.  The lasers alone won\'t kill a tank since it is
very hard to hit the same spot twice.  So the tactics usually
demand that you fire a few shells and missiles first to thin out
the armor, and then fire the lasers to hopefully penetrate and
damage various internal components like ammo, fusion reactor,
crew, and stabalizers.

Or we can look at OGRE/GEV from steve jackson games. Their
rail-gun (gauss) fired tactical nuclear shells outclass every
other weapon on the battlefield.  The background history states
that lasers were found to be too tempermental to be used on the
battlefield and so laser are regulated to anti-air duty. A
definite rules simplification but one that works in that future
history.
 
Also, jump infantry is included in the Centurion rules, and I can
see how Centurion could easily be adapted for use in Traveller
ground actions.  Another technology that appears in Centurion is a
ceramic armor that defends nicely against lasers but is normal for
shells, meaning that you have to layer you armor in you vehicle
designs.

And thinking of armor, a reactive or ablative armor spaced with a harder
material (like superdense) should help keep the weight down while still
improving survivability.  Which give me a thought. I will have to try to
design a Centurion type Gravtank with FF&S.  It should prove enlightening.
 
Sorry if this is off-topic for some, but anytime I have compared
games, I have found more similarities than different.  It is
important to define what exists in the future history you use and
stick with it.  If another game design can be used to fill-in
parts, or just make play easier then I\'m all for it.

One last note, Centurion doesn\'t have the believability problems
that FASA\'s Battletech does. I could never understand why a few
nice heat-seekers couldn\'t be used in Battletech! <G> The thermal
exaust from those fusion reactors make such easy targets!
 
The whole point of this was to say that I think that fighting
vehicles would function best with two or more weapon types that
complement each other.
 
And hopefully when STRIKER II is released (I did hear it
mentioned, I think) it will simplify ground actions for us. (And
cause another new round of debates) <g>

The amount of laser pulse energy needed to burn through
or cause impulsive spalling on the inner surface of a
four inch armour-grade steel plate is just incredible.
The practicality of punching through with a HEAT warhead
(any modern LAW will do) or a long rod saboted penetrator
from a HV gun is obvious.

We\'ve spent billions of dollars trying to develop lasers
powerful enough to do about as much damage to a missile
as a few shotgun blasts (<5).  Nonhardened targets are
vulnerable to lasers.  Hardened ones are for all practical
purposes much better broken with kinetic penetrators of
some sort.

Not that I was ever a major contributor, but my alienation has been much
the same as for these individuals. I will never play TNE, and hence am
uninterested in anything to do with TNE. Unfortunately, this also means
that the TML has become a source of annoyance to me rather than pleasure.
It reminds me that the abomination that is TNE is not going to go away,
more\'s the pity.

It is therefore with much regret that I ask James to drop me from this
fine list. I have many kind words for the people that I have met via
the TML, but only words of contempt for GDW which through its actions
has driven me from the TML.

Farewell, and I\'ll see some of you on the PBeM. (It\'s not dead, it\'s
getting better...)

    'body' => '              The Political Economy of the Imperium

I want to talk a little bit about the Imperium, and some of the
assumptions that underlie its structure.  Let me begin by listing
two of the problematic areas that I think merit consideration.

1)  In UWP generation, world physical characteristics are
independent both of Starport type and Population details.  As has
been pointed out, this leads to cases where hostile, hellish
worlds with millions or even billions of inhabitants sit next
door to garden planets with populations measurable on the fingers
of one hand.

2)  Nearly every star system has a starport of one kind or
another, no matter how useless the real estate in the area is. 
In fact, since the starport code is generated _first_, there is
no relation between the starport and anything else in the system
except its tech level.

One way to approach these "problematica" is to say, "Well,
they\'re completely non-rational; let\'s change them."  That\'s a
valid solution.  And that\'s been done here on this list, so I
don\'t propose to go that route again.

The other approach is to say, "Well, this doesn\'t seem to make
sense.  But there are certain assumptions that I\'m working with
in making that judgement.  Okay, so what assumptions about an
interstellar society are necessary to justify the approach that
these rules take?"

One answer, at least, was suggested by the writer who said that,
essentially, "Third Imperial culture is a _starfaring_ culture." 
(It consists, in other words, of _travellers_.)  

This lets us decouple the mainworld characteristics from the
value assigned to a system by Imperials.  They aren\'t looking for
a garden world just like dear old Terra (or Sylea, or Vland). 
They live in space, viewing planets as resource centers rather
than places to colonize or settle down upon.

Of course, that is not to suggest that there are no planet-bound
or planet-centered cultural groups within the Imperium, or even
non-travelling subcultures within Imperial culture -- there may
be segments of the population of Capital/Core, perhaps, who view
the rest of the Imperium the way some New York City dwellers look
on the rest of the United States.  But the culture into which
most Classic Traveller PCs mustered out may have been what can be
called "mainstream Imperial culture".

This rationalization only gets us part way, however.  It can be
asserted that the main objection to the UWP generation sequence,
all considerations of culture aside, is that, economically, some
results are hard to justify.  I don\'t dispute that here.  But I
do suggest that economic behavior exists within a political
framework -- that is, a structure of regulations, laws, and power
struggles and imbalances.  By attempting to rationalize some
apparently illogical results within a political economy
framework, the referee can "flesh out" the underpinnings of a
world or a subsector and make it more real, interesting, and fun
for his (or her) players.

The lo-pop garden world next door to the hi-pop hellhole is a
case in point.  Instead of calling this an irrational result of
arbitrary die rolls, we can say that the lo-pop world is a
tourist site or rest and recreation area for the teeming masses
who labor on the surface, in orbital facilities, on the jovian
moons, and out in the Oort clouds.  The world government has
petitioned the subsector nobility to make sure that the garden
planet next door is preserved for that purpose, and so the
proclamations have been duly made.

[Note that adventure hooks can be found here:  What if some
outsiders decide that they do want to settle there?  The hi-pop
world, with no authority outside its system, may hire PCs to
investigate, negotiate, and/or evict.  Or the squatters can hire
them to help defend the settlement (a la the Magnificent Seven),
or to escort a spokesman to the subsector capital to plead their
case.]

The ubiquity of starports is another matter altogether.  It seems
that some of these serve no good purpose -- why would someone
spend their hard-earned credits to build a starport in the middle
of nowhere?  The "if you build it, they will come" argument only
goes so far, even if we assume a highly mobile and transient
community of interstellar travellers.  

It occurs to me, however, that just as the U.S. government
subsidized the building of the interstate highway system, the
Imperial government would subsidize (and otherwise encourage) the
construction of starports.   Thus, while some starports would be
built by megacorporations and smaller companies anticipating a
profit, others would be financed by the Ministry of Commerce,
still others by the Scout Service, and others by the Navy.  Some
megacorporations might be induced to build a starport by virtue
of a tax write-off they would then become eligible for.  Low tech
worlds might contract with higher tech corporations to build a
starport in exchange for certain concessions or rights upon the
planet.

[Adventure hook:  PCs become involved in the investigation of
shoddy construction practices by a subsector-wide corporation,
where substandard materials are used but assessed as more
expensive so that the bill can be presented to the Ministry of
Commerce, and the excess credits pocketed.] 

It is not often noted, but the Imperium does in fact possess
considerable power regarding megacorporations and smaller
interstellar corporations down to at least the subsector level. 
_The Imperium permits them to exist_.  That is, by virtue of the
laws and regulations it promulgates, the Imperium makes it
feasible for star-spanning corporations to function.  They are
not natural or even inevitable constructs.  If the legal
structure of the Imperium was altered so that only the capital of
individual worlds or subsectors could be consolidated for
business ventures, a very different economic environment would
prevail, one perhaps more similar to the mercantile era of
Terra\'s 17th and 18th centuries (or thenabouts).

The assumptions I am making here are different from but no less
valid than those made by advocates of changing UWP generation. 
In a sense I am making the case for an "active Imperium" that
acts on the worlds within its domain, indirectly, by governing
the relationships between them.  In MegaTraveller terms, I
suppose that would put me in Dulinor\'s camp.  And we all know
what happened to him.

Comments?  I\'m all ears.

Ah, but there\'s a LARGE difference between the depths of space between the 
stars and space in a given star system.  I agree that O\'Neill\'s work shows
the latter can certainly be practical - but usually within a star system,
where material and energy are available, as opposed to a point in the depths
between the stars where material and energy would need to be transported.

OTH, I am sure that there can be some "Deep Space" refueling stations
that make economic sense - such as they represent a major (2 month+
time saving) travel short-cut to be worth it to starships to pay for
fuel at say triple or quadruple the cost (remember that all energy fuels,
food, building material, or ship fuel must be jumped in by a hauler that
then needs to jump back out!  Not many ships can carry Jump-4 worth of
fuel and still carry a useful cargo load!

J Roberson sez:
>I always thought that there weren\'t deep-space refueling stations in
>Traveller because ships don\'t just refuel, they discharge energy. 

Nope.  They just need fuel to go any further.  (see above why their might be
an expensive deep space station).

>I know that was true in 2300AD 

True, but that\'s due to a vastly different technology.

>and I\'m pretty certain that\'s how jump worked in Battletech, 

Ah, no.  In BT, jumpships are rather delicate items, easily effected by 
gravitational fields.  The safest place to jump into a system is at 
either the "north" or "south" poles of a sphere centered on the system\'s
star.  A good interstellar navigator with intimate knowledge of planetary 
position and movement within a system can find additional places to 
jump to, usually closer to (but not on top of) the inhabited planet.  
Jumping to the wrong place in the system can have disasterous effects 
from permanent damage to the jump system (as in won\'t work any more)
to coming out as dust near a gravity well to not coming out (actually,
not much worse than the previous :-).

Once in system, jumpships need to recharge the capacitors used tp power
jump in one surge.  The economic way to do so is by unfurling a large
solar panel to gather the energy.

>and I guess I always assumed it was true in Traveller. Jump
>Drives must discharge accumulated energy before moving on, and they must do

Nope.  Different technology.

>A deep space station with that much

>Sphere-scale) station. Lemme know if I\'m wrong. . .

There\'s no particular reason the STATION would need a grav well is there?
Even beyond the ships travelling to it, the station is just a (hopefully
well-engineered) pile of metal in deep space.  It can be as large or small 
as folks are willing to pay for.

There is nothing in GDW\'s current (or past) Traveller series technology that 
requires a celestial body for jump.

Yeah, that sounds like the oldtimers I\'ve known.  Especially the
squawking and squabbling!

I think that it\'s too bad that some of the long time Traveller players,
most recently Nick Sylvain, have found TNE so annoying that they\'ve
gone away.  Nick has always had something useful to say, as have many
of the other "oldtimers" on the TML who are no longer around.

I have problems with some things about TNE, too.  Some of them fairly
major.  But heck, I had problems with "Classic" Traveller, some of
them major as well.  As anyone who ever tried to run the old adventure
"Research Station Gamma" knows, sometimes you just have to wing it.
And if something is too broken to use (like the MT "Frightning Ships"
supplement) then you don\'t buy it.  Some people would say TNE falls
into this category.  Their choice.  (Some people are sick of new
rules sets.  No problem there!)  Besides, I loathe GURPS. :)

So I guess I\'ll be around for a while.  Of course, I reserve the right
to flee at will if things get too brain-dead.  Doesn\'t look like that
quite yet, though.  After all, DGP could have *published* that awful
"Baddies From The Core" outline from MTJ #4!  (Concept ok.  The
implementation outlined, no.)

This is a good point.  I\'m something of a Sword Worlder though (I was in
the *JTAS* `draft\' a long time ago and served in the Confederation Second
Grav Tank Corps during the 5FW) and decided to `be conservative\' and choose
the lower TL choice in my modifications for TNE to avoid any suggestion
of partisanship.  I\'m curious what others think of this issue.

I agree with Hans\'s point but I think this has major ramifications for the
Regency and other Spinward States in TNE.  As Alistair suggests above one
would expect the Viral threat to serve as an important motivator for all
interstellar states to seek to overcome the economic and social obstacles
to the spread of their highest technological capabilites.

Just as the Regency is most likely sending scientists and engineers from
its TL 15 worlds to study on Vincennes, I would think the Sword Worlds
would be doing the same.  They might even put aside their distaste for
Imperials and Zhodani in order to participate in technological exchange
programs with them.

It was in the interests of the Imperium to maintain the technological
diversity of its worlds - it made the lower-tech worlds easier to control
through advanced technology and the higher-tech worlds easier to control
through control of the means of transportation and communication between
them.

Such motivations become suspect in the face of Virus.


Finally, Bill White <whitew@eden.rutgers.edu> writes a whole bunch
of good stuff on:

I agree with much of what Bill writes - his argument is well thought out.
I, too, prefer to `rationalize\' the `inconsistencies\' that appear due
to `glitches\' in the rules.  With Traveller world generation though these
`inconsistencies\' are, IMHO, just too rampant.  Yes, there may be policy
reasons for the Imperium to subsidize `un-needed\' starports and
to promote settlement of `Nifflheims\' when several `Edens\' are just
a week away, but I find it impossible to explain these sorts of decisions
when such explanations often become necessary for multiple occurrences in
a single subsector.

I don\'t like rules, but world generation is one of those places where
a lot of useful information is generated very quickly - a good measure
of the usefulness of a rule - and in this instance we\'re still plagued
with relics that were developed a long time ago when sci-fi role-
playing was still relatively new.  It was fine - even fun and interesting -
to have such `awkward\' worlds when we were just adventuring in Regina
subsector but now that the entire galaxy is at our disposal I think it\'s
time for a little tinkering with the mechanics.

Scheherazade Wavecatcher

Scheherazade is an attractive, middle-aged Dolphin female.  She is somewhat
small for a female Dolphin and her soft build reveals her non-athletic nature.
In atmosphere, Scheherazade is always dressed in a stylish e-suit with integral
waldos, voder and contragravity.  In hydrosphere, she is typically unclothed.
Scheherazade usually scorns the use of translation devices, relying instead
upon here own linguistics skills.  Just in case though, her voder is equipped
with a full translator for use in emergencies.  She often carries a
computer-recorder and comm-link.

Scheherazade speaks native Delphinese and understands most major Human
languages as well as Meren and several Aeroi dialects.  She can speak all these
languages with the use of her voder.  Her words tend to come quickly when she
is excited or angry, but she has learned to control this in professional
situations.  A natural diplomat, Scheherazade is gregarious and a facilitator
of conversations.

Scheherazade has mastered the social skills required of a diplomat, but several
of her assignments in less sophisticated areas of society have led to her
comfort among them as well.  She is also quite able to persuade others of her
point of view.  She is an innovator and highly adept at adjusting to new
situations.  She is often looked to as a leader.  Her own respect for authority
is generally tolerant.

Scheherazade has few interests outside her work.  Fortunately, the work of a
freelance diplomat requires a broad range of interests.  Scheherazade has
extensive contact throughout the diplomatic community, especially in economic
and criminal law fields.

Scheherazade has two co-mothers to whom she is very close.  She is similarly
close to her sole brother.  She has a single birth-daughter who has not spoken
to her in years.  She is closer to her two care-sons.  Recently, she has become
involved romantically with Ulfilas Yellowknell, a writer of some renown.
She has made professional enemies of Pelham O\'Boyle, a Commonwealth army
officer who was court-martialed as a result of her investigations early in her
career, and of Akbar Aubademaker, an instructor at the Universidad de Lima who
attempted unsuccessfully to take credit for her research.  She counts
Jacqueline deVlaminck, a pirate encountered while negotiating the Nyanza
Anti-piracy Protocol, and Dean Quadros, a belter she met during her work on the
VanMaanen Mining Accords, among her professional friends.

Somewhat typically of Dolphins, Scheherazade is an idealist.  She has gone
freelance to pursue her belief in greater harmony among all peoples, a position
that was not always fostered in the Commonwealth diplomatic corps.  Her
continued association with Hsun Li, her former superior in the Corps, has lead
to several challenging assignments for a wide variety of clients.  Most
recently she has served as a trade negotiator for Aeroi interests in Ourora
subsector in the aftermath of the Markets War.

Earth is the homeworld of both Dolphins and Humans and the birthplace of Terran
civilization.  All Terran states in the Earth Colonies Sphere were originally
colonized by settlers from Earth, or their descendants.

Earth is the capital and most important world of the Commonwealth of Earth.
The world suffered extensive ecological damage during the 21st through 24th
Centuries and only recently has most of the damage been erased.  Earth of the
31st Century is closer to the \'garden planet\' of yore than it has been since
the rise of industrial civilization.  Scattered among its vast oceans and
forests are gleaming megalopolises.  Exploitation of natural resources has been
abandoned in favor of a balanced stewardship.

Dominate how? And how quick is quickly?

How would this affect the inter-planet dealings? Individual Sword Worlds
may be feudal technocracies, but the Confederation itself is a  -  well,
a confederation ;-)

Ah, but thats the whole point. You don\'t have the factories because you can
buy your TL 12 stuff cheaper from Sacnoth than you can build them yourself.
And you don\'t build that ship yourself becuase it\'s cheaper to buy it from
Sacnoth, too. This also impose a natural restriction on Sacnoth\'s ability to
dominate the Confederation: If they become too expensive the other worlds
_will_ build TL 12 factories  -  which will propably trigger a recession on
Sacnoth and close down a lot of industry  -  quite possibly enough to drop
Sacnoth a TL in the process. That\'s what I mean by economic cycles.

On the contrary, there is a lot of intergration. That\'s why their economies
can affect each other that way. What they don\'t have is much economic
_control_. Each world will do what seems best for itself.

How do you know that? By that logic the independent worlds along the edge
of the Imperium should have fallen to the Imperium long ago too. They are
certainly even weaker than the Confederation. Lots of independant worlds
have fallen to the Imperium in the old days. But the Imperium had to stop
somewhere. It happened to be before they swallowed the Sword Worlds (Of
course, the fact that the present Sword world government (centered on Gram)
is rumoured to be heavily backed by Zhodani money may explain a lot). The
Imperium did occupy 12 of the Sword Worlds for a time after the Third
Frontier War, as a matter of fact. They just decided to go home again.

(Do me a favour and describe how a feudal technocracy functions. Of all the
government types that\'s the one I\'ve never been quite clear about. I have
a vague idea, but I can\'t quite see how it would work in practice). Anyway,
as I said above, the Confederation is not one.

Because it was only one of 20+ worlds and the rest wanted it differently?

Why should it? It is tied to political power. One source of political power
is technology, but it\'s not the only one. Besides, the leadership dosen\'t
fluctuate all that much. The Sword Worlds had been led by Gram for centuries
in 1120.

Elucidate please. I\'m not trying to be snide, I actually can\'t see why that

Oh, dear! You really have a gamer\'s mentality, don\'t you? (And, yes, here I
am being snide ;-) The Sword Worlds have had their civil wars, true, but
they don\'t have them twice a decade. I think they\'ve had four or five in
15 centuries. They\'re not the local Monday Evening Gaming Club trying to
do each other down, reasoning that having 50 \'victory points\' and win is
better than having 500 points and lose. Wars cost. Maybe the Sacnoth
leaders think a destructive stalemate would destroy too much. And, as
I\'ve mentioned above, if Sacnoth dosen\'t sell those ships then the other
worlds _will_ build the factories to make the parts and build their own. If
that\'s the way it works, then the only reason why the other worlds are not
TL 12 is precisely that Sacnoth IS selling them ships and spare parts.

Thank you. Ahh, yes. I too remember a time when a Kinunir was an awesome

its 15 (Count them: 15!) jump capsules <<nostalgic sniff>>.

They just don\'t make Marines like that nowadays, do they?

Kerry -
     I wrote the articles in collaboration with James Holden.  That
segment is actually a condensation of something in the Grand
Explorations manuscript which Geo Gelinas and I wrote.  (Although the
book was ultimately cancelled, the material might begin to see print
soon in the form of magazine articles.)
     The similarities to Theta Borealis sector, published by Group One,
were deliberate so as to lend validity to that product.
     You\'re welcome to forward this information back to whoever
posted the above.  Thanks.                                        MIKE

The Group Program
     In 359, the Scouts began a massive deep space exploration effort,
named the Group Program after Dr Sylvester Group, the prominent
scientist that lead the campaigned for it.  The primary objective was
to send ships with astronomical sensors well outside the Imperium.  At
the same time, the ships would carry exploration teams to study the
systems along the way.  With the support of other scientists from a
wide range of fields, he won the endorsement of several dukes and
ultimately that of the Emperor Anguistus.
     The project set up headquarters at Deneb and prepared two series
of missions focused on two different directions roughly ninety degree
apart from one another.  The series called Group One focused on areas
to spinward, while Group Two went to coreward.  Each set up a
permanent colony on a remote hospitable world to support these remote
scientific endeavors.
     Group One established itself at Pautho (Theta Borealis 1506
A567456-E V), a very hospitable world, but barren at the time.
Imperium-wide attention given the projects attracted numerous
engineers and technicians to settle the colony.  They rapidly set up a
class A starport, city, and hinterland with the lavish support of the
Scout supply line.  The colony tech level started out fully at the
Imperial maximum (TL13).
     Advanced scouts particularly selected Theta Borealis for its many
budding minor races.  The colonists recruited a few thousand to help
build the colony.  In return, Pautho gave the aliens technological
assistance which allowed a few to start their own interstellar
communities after a couple of centuries.  Humans from Pautho often
settled on these alien worlds to form commercial companies.
     Meanwhile, Group Two settled Geokha (Sigma Zephyrus 3210
A689559-E V) in the same fashion.  This sector, called Zhiaqrqiats in
the Zhodani language, was rich in Ancient sites.  Geokha itself had an
enormous intact Ancient city completely untouched by the Final War.
However, the Ancient withdrawal was evidently quite orderly, leaving
little to physically ship back to the Imperium for study.  The
searchings by scientists and the occasional artifact hunters
periodically encounter rich finds, though.

Except the background, that is.  Many of the supposed barriers
to travel would not exist without this as at least a practical
requirement (for example, you can do it, but you waste fuel and
it adds an element of danger).

An example from Classic Traveller is the Great Rift, and the
corresponding J-n routes across it which would no longer be needed
(before saying they\'re for traders, think about the cost savings
of using a smaller Jump drive and the fact that you have more cargo
space by making a series of smaller jumps--besides, they weren\'t
just for traders).

An example from TNE (which I don\'t own) is the Regency\'s defense
against the virus.  I guess TNE claims they are covering every
cubic meter in a shell 6 parsecs thick around the Regency (which
is ludicrous--they would have to be able to INSTANTLY destroy any
ship coming out of jump in that area and NEVER fail).  More likely,
they are covering every planet and gas giant at the border.  Of
course, this doesn\'t work if it\'s easy to jump to empty space.
There would be a whole chain of Virus refueling stations extending
throughout the Regency\'s open space by now (scary, isn\'t it?).
Make it a little harder to do, and the refueling stations still
appear at the border (slowly), giving the blockade fleets another
horror they have to face before it\'s too late (not to mention the
occassional deep-space jump patrol popping in on top of literal
fortresses just inside of Regency space).

It\'s possible they don\'t often make much economic sense.  (Maybe I\'ll do
a quick analysis sometime.)  But they might make very good military
sense, as a refueling depot.  All you need are the hulls for holding
the LHyd fuel, tanker/tugs to haul them around and fill them up, and
a parsec or so to hide them in.  I don\'t know whether the logistical
assets to support such a venture would be worth tying up or not.


On Depot and its\' TL16:

Point taken.  However, I think that Depot\'s tech is supportable on
the Domain\'s resources.  Deneb has enough TL15 worlds to handle any
materiel Depot got from other worlds at that tech level (maybe with
some retooling) and it would be fairly difficult and time-consuming
to ship anything significant from further away.  The nearest TL16
world outside Deneb was the capital of Corridor, Kaasu (Corr. 1209).
The only other TL16 worlds in that direction are the two in Vland,
Gemid and Lukham.  So Depot had to be fairly self-sufficient in the
way of manufacturing.  And from what we\'re told, typical Imperial
naval policy dictated this.  Still, I\'d expect short-term equipment
problems, especially with experimental ships like the uprated TL17
armed Voroshilev battleships, since those contractors and that project
was not originally in Deneb.  It still will be rough for a couple
of decades, but not I believe, insurmountable.

Hmm...Depot (Deneb) may have been centered on Imperial prototype
development and testing, as well as high tech production.  Does
anyone else remember any TL16 naval depots?  (It seems to me that
some of the depots were designed with major secondary missions.
Except Depot (Corridor).  Its\' secondary mission was its\' primary
mission -- to be the biggest naval base in the Imperium!) :)

>My own view is that TL represents the production capability of the world.

Agreed.  I really liked the DGP _World Builder\'s Handbook_ development
of the tech level concept into types of technology at different levels,
with UWP tech level represented as the height of commonly available
technology on the world.  That didn\'t rule out weird tech level
variations in places, or lower tech in undeveloped regions, and so on.
For instance, UWP tech for modern Earth was 8, best representing the
planetary production (i.e. the industrialized, computerized "First
World" countries), but low common was only 6, representing the best
available elsewhere.  The book, if you can still find a copy, presented
a nice flexible system.


On Imperial Politics:

The x-boat system is an interesting case study.  When designed in the
mid-600s, it was state of the art: tech 13, jump four.  (Although
the Imperium was considered tech 14 in 700, so the government probably
had many jump five ships by then).  After four hundred years of service
it was still jump four.  While political reasons for having a slower
information system have been expressed (the government gets news by
jump six first), there are other considerations.  The x-mail system
may have been aging, but it still worked, and it would be terribly
expensive to redesign the entire system for jump six.  What if the
way stations would need to be moved?  Think of the expense of the
new x-boat designs!  [Especially in the old Classic Trav design
system which explains why we have the xboats we do!]

Even so, prior to the Fifth Frontier War, there had been talk of
building a jump six express route from Regina to Capital in order
to keep closer track of the Zhodani situation.  (Which may have been
Imperial sabre-rattling, but is still interesting.)  TNS news
releases on such things were in the 5FW game, and may have been in
JTAS was well.

I\'ve only gotten through part of Jim\'s discussion but if you\'re going
to participate in our current world generation discussion then I
strongly urge you to check this out first.  It will save us a *great*
deal of duplication.


Andy Lilly <A.S.Lilly@bnr.co.uk> asks with regard to the Earth Colonies
world generation variant I posted:

It\'s not that you\'re not reading the tables correctly it\'s just that I
didn\'t bother to explain them.  The description of government types C+
as \'democratic oligarchies\' merely describes the nature of authority and
consent under these governments.  The \'democratic\' means that ultimately
the government enjoys some level of consent (even if that\'s merely a
consent to oppression in the face of an alternative of death - which is
what permits the oppression to continue) from the populace.  Since high
government levels result from large populations some sort of consent
*has* to exist.

The \'oligarchy\' in the government type description merely describes the
agent that exercises authority.  In this case, a group of individuals
(as a opposed to the single individual of an autarchy).  At C+ we get
an oligarchy again because population levels are high which strains
the ability of a single individual to exercise authority.

The specific characteristics of this \'democratic oligarchy\' are left
to the referee.  If you prefer a theocracy go right ahead.  The rules
are simply constructed to permit an extremely oppressive government
type without requiring that it be characterized as theocratic.  (A view
expressed in the canonical rules that, IMHO, reflects the Western humanist
bias of the original developers rather than an objective take on
government types - there was nothing \'religious\' about the rule of Sauron
in Mordor!)

If you haven\'t read the discussion from last year\'s TML made available
by Jim Vassilakos <jimv@ucrengr.UCR.EDU> some of this might not make any
sense.  Also, note that I originally sent this message as mail directly
to Jim.  (So he\'s probably whom I mean when I write "you".)

My general feeling was that the discussion was starting to get a little
too complicated.  I guess I agree with Jim\'s comment of 19 Feb 93:

> Hmm... this is starting to entail lots
> of variables.

I\'m not much for rules in the first place.  My approach to role-playing is
to generally ignore the rules except when they can provide a lot of useful
information with a relatively small amount of effort.  This is illustrated
by the difference between the basic and extended canonical rules.  The
basic rules give plenty of info on the main worlds for a relatively small
amount of effort while the extended rules give lots of info for the (less
important) rest of the system *and* requires a great deal more effort.

That said, I do feel the basic rules need work which is why I developed
variant world generation tables for the Earth Colonies campaign (but that
only address the main world).

The concern about spectral types interested the scientist in me (I was an
engineering major) but pretty much bores the role-player in me (I\'m now a
humanities major).  I realize some `garden\' worlds get generated about
stars that sort of ruin the garden but I\'m willing to deal with that on
an individual basis.  (I realize though that this becomes an issue when
you seek to expand the system to include some sort of random life generation.)

I really liked the idea suggested by Bruce Pihlamae that proposed an
approach to developing worlds similar to that used to generate characters.
The generation of the geosphere, native biosphere, external cultural
influences and subsequent interactions seems very interesting.  (I also
like the `resonance\' of this approach with the character generation scheme.
This does begin to become a product of one\'s approach to one\'s particular
gaming universe though - another important point raised in the discussion.)
Unforunately, this particular stream of the discussion seems to have died
out.  (I also agree with your sense that this is more `world building\'
than `world generation\' - sort of like the `expanded\' character generation
rules - but I *do* like it.)

I\'ve jimmied (Oops!  Just realized you might not like that term.  :-) with
the trade classifications myself.  (In addition to many of the points raised
I\'ve always found the fact that waterworlds - Hyd A - can\'t be agricultural
to be more a product of our own land-lubber bias than objective consideration.)
Generally, though I\'ve never been satisfied with my limited attempts to
rectify this situation.  This is probably due to the fact that trade codes
don\'t really matter except in the trade and commerce rules.  Not being
much for rules anyway I just don\'t encounter the trade codes that much.

The other point I found of interest was the notion of some sort of `life
scale\' that details the sophistication of native life.  In general I come
down on the side of this measure not addressing technological accomplishment
(sentience is important regardless of TL, IMHO).  On the other hand I\'m
uncomfortable with randomly occurring sophonts but the idea of a code that
will tell me whether the local life consists of water-borne single-cell
organisms or highly sophisticated mobile predators does seem quite useful.
I see no problem just adding this code to the `Remarks\' section of the UWP.
Say a code like `LX\' where the `X\' is the UWP digit.  (I\'ve added columns
under `Remarks\' in the Earth Colonies campaign that address local defense
battalions and system defense boats already.)

I find the `Resource\' measure of less use.  Planets are pretty large bodies
and most will possess *some* sort of resources.  It seems to me that more
important will be the *accessibility* of those resources which leads you
back to `good\' biospheres.  (No matter how much lanthanum there is on some
`hell-hole\' there is a price to be paid to extract that resource in such
an environment - making it ultimately less valuable, unless you *can\'t* get
it somewhere else - and if I can\'t get it anywhere else, how did I find it
to be useful in the first place?)

The last issue I feel I need to address is the suggestion that government
and law level might influence tech level.  First off, you\'ll see from the
variant world generation that I posted from the Earth Colonies that I\'ve
rejected the government types from Traveller (which were always problematic,
IMHO) in favor of a government characteristic that attempts to address the
nature of popular consent and the exercise of authority that is unrelated
to the specific manifestation of that consent and exercise of authority.
I also abandon the `weapons restrictions\' guidelines for law level in favor
of a more loosely defined level of government intrusiveness that primairly
manifests itself in `encounter throws\' for the local police - whether
such an encounter occurs because of a weapons violation, expired license,
or your haircut is up to the referee.

That said, I would be very careful about any modification of tech level by
government type or law level because such modification is highly susceptible
to contemporary political views about the nature of technology and the
practice of science that are extremely lacking in objectivity.  Even in
the TML discussion there was a great deal more ideology than technology - both
with respect to `oppressive vs. open\' government types and with repsect to the
nature of government intrusiveness (law level) into the practice of science
and technology.  (I say this as a practicing engineer currently involved
in the joint US-Russian space program *and* as a soon-to-be science and
technology policy graduate student.)

Excellent article!  Exactly the kind of thing I subscribe to this list
to read!  

When I roll up systems, I don\'t muck with the starport or population 
rules.  I like the challenge that results from having to explain why
a world has 10 billion people on it when its temperature is 100 below
zero and has an insidious atmosphere.

If the rules change so that only garden worlds have high populations,
then each worlds starts to look suspiciously the same.

Regency Quarantine Service

In the years following the withdrawal of the Corridor Fleet the Domain
of Deneb Navy & Scout assets conducted a fighting retreat before the
onslaught of the Vargr invasions.  In 1125 the frontier of the Domain
had been pushed back to the spinward half of Deneb Sector while the
other half had been reduced to Wilds.

When Norris established the Quarantine (312-1130) the Patrol was
combined with part of the Regency Interstellar Scout Service
(Exploration and External Mapping branches) to form the Regency
Quarantine Service (RQS).  Communications (xboat & courier service) and
Internal Mapping functions remained unchanged (within the borders of the
Regency).  The RQS soon became a separate service.

The Quarantine border was extended to more defensible positions and is
several parsecs deep to prevent high jump performance ships from leaping
over the blockade.  By 1201 this border ran through the following
subsectors:

	Deneb: 		B - G - K - O
	Reft:			C - B - F - E - I
	Trojan Reach:	L - P - O
	Riftspan Reaches:	C - G - F - E

The Scout/Courier ships now available to the RQS were modified to create
Quarantine Cutters quickly followed by the addition of 70-ton Inspection
Launches.  The RQS still wasn\'t able to maintain a virus-proof seal
along the entire border which resulted in the creation of the RQS
Auxiliary comprised of private citizens assisting the patrol of the
border.  Later 150-ton Quarantine Cutters (stretched versions of the
Scout) entered into use by the RQS.

The above data on the RQS is pieced together from Survival Margin and
T:TNE manual.  The following is my conjectures on tactics of the RQS as
well as some additional necessary assets.  For each system that contains
gas giant(s) and/or a world with water present the RQS will need to base
assets able to defend those sites and send messages to other systems in
the Zone.  This would include manned bases in position around such
planets and small fighter craft in addition to the ships normally in use
by the RQS.

When a ship arrives at a system within the Zone and is detected by RQS
sensors they will be hailed.  If they respond they will be instructed to
rendezvous with either a Quarantine Cutter or an Inspection Launch
depending on the size of the ship.  If any problems arise when
communication is attempted the RQS will dispatch armed craft (either
Cutters or fighters who tend to shoot first and ask questions later.
Fighters would be designed with high manuever capabilities and would be
based at all refueling sources.

They would not be launched until a suspect ship is fairly close.  This
provides multiple benefits: the fighters have ample fuel, the incoming
ships are low on fuel, the bases are close-by so are able to provide
heavy fire support (Particle Accelerators and Meson Guns).  Another
option would be to replace some or all of the fighters with remotely
piloted vehicles operated from the base.

Finally should incoming hostile forces overcome an RQS base there must
be some means for notifying other nearby systems.  This is accomplished
by maintaining a small unmanned station outside of the 100 diameter zone
which contains jump torpedoes.  When RQS forces are nearly overwhelmed a
signal is sent to the station which then launches all of its torpedoes.
Each torpedo is preset to enter jumpspace at the proper time.  One
torpedo is sent to each nearby system.  As part of the notification
signal additional data can be transmitted and sent with the torpedo such
as compostion of enemy forces.  When the torpedo arrives at its
destination it begins broadcasting its message to RQS bases.  This
system is a response to the Rape of Trin and currently only 1 in 3
systems are equiped with these stations.


Next:  The RQS in 1200 and beyond.

I agree with the majority of the discussion that followed.  Large
artificial habitats will no doubt be avoided like the plague (or the
Virus).  Smaller AHs (not Avalon Hills! :)  will only be established if
the need is great enough.  BTW this only applies to such groups as the
RC, the Regency would not have such phobias.

An example would be Kruyter which is inhabited by RC workers of a
private corporation attemting to recover minerals and relic equipment.
This would provide the only good reason for returning to such worlds.
If additonal reasons for the continued habitation of the world are found
(such as being a J-2 way station between more important systems) then
possibly the colony would continue to exist.

As far as the tech needed and phobia toward such I think if people are
willing to trust returning to space in ships they will have no problem
with AHs.  They will of course take all the precautions used on
spacecraft to deter Virus infection.

Re: 1. I know ALOT of people dislike T:TNE. Is it due to the system, or

                         and
    Contents of T:TNE Deluxe Edition

Several months ago this very topic was heatedly discussed on TML and
I\'ve included a humorous summary that was posted:

Once upon a time, before the sinking of F.G.U. and the rise of Star Wars
licensed products, there was a game called Traveller. It came in three
small booklets and it was good. But with the waning of the years of
innocence GDW did look upon the face of their sales, and lo, begat Mega
Traveller of Many Colours, and did fill it with many fine and strangely
crafted rules. But yeah the people of the Imperium did look upon the new
creation wrought in the image of the three books and lo saw that it was
flawed. Listening to the torment of the multitiude GDW did release
errata sheets; and they were legion. And the people did name the Many
Coloured One "Typo Traveller" and were filled with dismay.

With the passing of the age of Innocence came \'The New Era\', and there
was many wiping of slates clean. And lo the sides of the die did
multiply thricefold and more, the Imperium was swept away, and the
people did weep. Yet from within the lamentation the people did look
upon the new book and did like the new uncluttered task system and
rejoiced over character generation. And yeah they threw down their laser
carbines for they were as nought in the face of the enemy, and picked up
rifled muskets for they had better penetration at small range than the
ACR with DS rounds.

And yet in this moment of triumph \'Errata\', the Evil One, did once more
spoil the party with seditious mistakes and inconsistencies.

And it is Now, and I that speak to you from the far distant land of
England. A land that has not yet seen the light of FF&S or indeed this:

 U> From: gt6963c@prism.gatech.edu
 U> There are 2 books and 1 booklet in the deluxe box:  TNE rules, FF&S,
 U> and an "upgrade" booklet that covers changes to the main rules that
 U> have been made by the creation of FF&S.  It says that "updated rule
 U> books will have the designation version 1 mod 1, dec 1993 on the
 U> title page".
 U> John

With confusion and a sadly dwindeling bank account, I seek T:TNE Errata
to fill the holes in our blessed book. Sages of the TML, answer me:

   What errata is currently available?
   Where may such wise lore be found?
   Does this involve more than changes to system travel times?
   Will GDW slay Errata for good with version 1 mod 1?

I can only watch and hope.

It seems that the less TMLers were upset over the game system (a
combination of Classic Traveller (CT) & Twilight 2000 (T2K)) as they
were over the setting (i.e. the eradication of the 3rd Imperium (3I).
Many of us who\'ve played Traveller for some time were devastated at the
loss of the 3I, or more pointedly GDW\'s apparent intention to stop
support of such with modules & sourcebooks & move in new directions.

GDW not only changed the system but also the setting all at once and
officially has left the 3I behind as but a note in history.  The rules
overhaul in my opinion is good.  The character skills have been heavily
altered but still have the Traveller flavor.  Combat has changed to the
T2K system, I agree somewhat with A. Shock\'s opinion regarding lasers (I
would limit their pen to 2-2-2 as non-rigid armor does nothing to
lasers) and automatic fire (it seems that more damage is done by firing
the full number of single shots that if the weapon is fired on full
automatic!!).  These rules are GDW\'s \'house rules\' that they now use for
all their (dwindling) rpgs.  The boxed set includes the rules book which
contains all the rules:
	character creation
	task resolution
	world building, space travel, commerce,
		equip maintenance & repairs (a la T2K), psionics
	combat - planetary (i.e. individual), vehicle, & space
	equipment list

in one 380 pg tome which also includes 2 scenarios (one in the RC & one
in the Wilds).  Also included is Fire,Fusion, & Steel which is a tech
design book for firearms, vehicles, and spacecraft plus a map of
Diaspora sector & accompanying stats (for both 1119 & 1200) plus char
gen charts.

The setting GDW seems to actively support is as follows: as the Final
War wound down Lucan was researching a secret weapon.  Dulinor
discovered this & raided the research base not knowing what was being
developed.  He thereby acquired the AI Virus & spread it.  The Virus was
bred for distruction and what the warring factions didn\'t destroy it did
- - leaving the former Imperium in ruins, depopulated, and in many cases
without space transport or contact.  Except for the Domain of Deneb (now
known as the Regency) which had warning of the Virus & set up a
Quarantine Zone at its borders.

Seventy-five years later the survivors are starting to crawl back into
space.  GDW is supporting one such area - the Reformation Coaltion.
This group first tried peaceful trade but their initial missions all ran
into serious trouble.  They then sent rescue missions which achieved
using force what the peaceful trade missions did not.  The RC is now
embarcked on a mission of reuniting all the worlds of the former
Imperium.  The only propblem is most of the worlds are run by TEDs.


Technically Advanced Dictators rule by might.  Nearly all the worlds of
the Imperium suffered a drop in Tech Lvl but some relic tech items are
left.  Those who have advanced weapons can rule over many even if they
are few in number.  The RC is democraticvally inclined (at the moment)
and therefore only wants like minded worlds to join (and will eliminate
TEDs to bring democratic rule to planets).

This is the Star Viking campaign which is described in the rules along
with mention of two alternate settings: the Spinward Sates (Regency) and
a Pocket Empire.

I personally rather like the current setting - the Imperium always
seemed too big & not subject to external threats.  Even the Zhodani were
only a threat to but a portion of one sector.  Nonetheless GDW should
have taken a cue fromTSR and maintained multiple settings.  Many of the
TMLers want the old Imperium.  The Regency is very similar but does not
seem to enjoy much official support.  GDW should issue products for both
the Regency and Reformation Coalition settings and possibly more (its
the new way to make money - Task Force Games does it with Star Fleet
Battles, Avalon Hill with Advanced Squad Leader, and TSR with their
multiverse of D&D settings).  On the TML we have started developing our
own background for the Regency.  Feel free to join in with your comments
and ideas.

  I agree that the stats seem to be a result of applying a mechanical
system to the process without editing the results.  As the Regency and
other peoples further spinward were not touched by the Virus (with a few
exceptions) they would not have suffered the degradations suffered by
worlds in the Wilds.  In addition during the first few decades the
economies, tech levels, and possibly populations may very well have
increased for the following reasons:

	- the Zhodani and Regency entered a new, more peaceful stage in
their association with each other

	- with the loss of Corridor and contact with the Imperium the
Regency needed to produce more items for self-sufficiency.  What they
couldn\'t produce would be purchased from the Zhos, Darrians, Sword
Worlds, etc.

	- ship building outside the Regency probably increased and
starport quality with it.  To successfully equip the RQS ships were
needed, ships not available from the Imperium.  The Regency would need
nearly all of its shipyards to produce RQS ships.  Civilians would have
to go elsewhere and initially that would probably be to Gram in the
Sword Wlds and Mire & Jacent in the darrian Confederation.  An effort to
upgrade other starports to capture a share in this new market would be
made by the Sword Wlds, Darrians, Arden & Border Wlds.

The updated stats seem well thought out and well within the bounds of
believability.

playing Classic Traveller.  The last one struck me last night after dropping
someone of at the airport.

Idea 1:
The Imperial Police Agent:  This came from an idea involving extradiction
of criminals from countries and even states within countries.  Basically
if a criminal commits a crime on planet A and then flees to planet B, who
brings the criminal to have justice on planet A.  The Imperial Police 
Agent was different from bounty hunters in that they were given a ship
for there use and have powers of arrest on all planets.  If they required
extra help on the arrest they could enlist the aid of the Imperial Navy.

I used this idea as a campaign for a group of two people.  It is better
suited for a small group.


Idea 2:
Planetary Dictator:  I want to have the some fun playing planetary 
governments.  The players have to form a political party on a democratic
world and get into power.  Once in power they have to try maintain their
hold on power.  This can be done democratically or by coming up with a way
to form a dictatorship.  In the game I played a planetary civil war enabled
the P.C.\'s to declared marital law, they just forgot to remove it.


Idea 3:
The Customs Barrier:  After going through security at the airport here
I noticed two things:  it is very light, and in all the traveller games
I have played I have never had to go through security or customs at a
starport.  For this adventure the PC\'s have just landed on a high law
level world and are trying to get through customs.  Unknown to the PC\'s
(unless they ask) the government has decided to outlaw a large range of
items.  Items outlaw should included an item on of the PC\'s is carrying
i.e. the wearing of black items of clothing is now outlawed.

The search for contraband should be extensive and maybe involve guards
with rubber gloves etc.  This gives the PC\'s a chance to use those little
used admin, bibery, streetwise skills.

Also the guards will be lightly armed and armoured with a large heavy 
armed and armoured swat team as backup.  This team would be hidden away.
The players in my group have a nasty habit of shooting problems.

I hope these ideas are of some help

I understand that the Italian M4 Spectre have a clip magazine capacity
of 50 rounds.  It has a length comparable to most 20-30 rounds
magazine by using a four column arrangement.  If you keep that in mind
higher capacity clip magazine doesn\'t *have* to mean a significantly
longer length.

I don\'t recall which version of the Calico appeared in C72, but the
9mm model comes with a 50 round held in a helix pattern on top of the
weapon.  A 100 round version is also available.

If you\'re really worry about the physical bulk of the magazine, take
the solution used by some version of the HK G11.  The stock breaks
opens and a 100 round brick of its caseless ammo is inserted w/o any
metal/plastic jackets.  pretty niffy ah?

With 40+ referees with active Traveller campaigns frequenting the TML,
between them there must be a LOT of NPC\'s floating around out there.

One of the referee\'s most tedious tasks is to generate NPC\'s.  Oh,
how much easier life would be if there were an NPC pool from which
a ref could pull an NPC whenever he needed.  (sigh)

Such would be the case if each of you posted your NPC\'s to the TML.
Take advantage of the leverage of cooperation, contribute your efforts,
and receive in return the efforts of 40!

The concept is starting to catch on, as several people have already
submitted theirs.  The NPC pool is growing!






NPC\'s are the life-blood of any campaign.  I love to read other refs\'
NPC\'s because it reflects their RPG-running style, and is a window inot
their imagination.  There are a lot of refs on the TML who would also
love to see your NPC\'s...

I hope you liked the 3 characters I included with the latest episode
of They Came From Beyond.  I hope to have episode 4 posted by the end
of the upcoming weekend (whew, these episodes take far longer to write
than the original adventure took to play!).

Having fun,
Rodge.

Apart from having long banana magazines, you can double your ammo capacity
by the quick\'n\'dirty method of taping or clipping two magazines together.
Modern magazines have their capacity increased by being thicker so that
they contain two columns of rounds.

Drums tend to be less reliable than straight magazines.

The big advantage of a top- or side-mounted magazine is that you can lie
prone and it doesn\'t get in the way.

Finally, if you have too big a magazine, it becomes heavy enough to upset
the balance of the weapon.  In the case of pistols and bullpup rifles,
this is not such a serious problem as if the magazine is mounted forward.

The major problem as I see it is the loss of cargo space where you
have to carry the extra fuel.  Any of these deep space refueling
stations would be expensive to operate.  I would guess that a
constant stream of tankers would be necessary to support a busy
deep space station.
 
The few imperial ships that are meant to function by using a deep
space stopover, usually carry a fuel bladder in their cargo hold,
or would have the extra fuel capacity built in.  The Imperiallines
Type TJ Frontier Transport is a ship that comes to mind with it\'s
jump 6 capability as opposed to the Type TI Frontier Transport
with its J-2 capablility.  The TJ is meant as a special courier
and is designed as such. The TJ even looks like the TI for
security reasons.
 
The one problem I have is with the TNE ship designs.  Now that we
are back to somewhat realistic thrusters, I find that I need more
fuel for my M-drives than for the J-drive.  So if you are willing
to sacrifice maneuverablity when you exit from jump, most TNE ship
already have the capability to do a deep space stopover without
carrying extra fuel.
 
CT and MT ships however would need to carry extra fuel.  I agree
that a deep space stopover is allowable, however it should be a
MAJOR problem to do so.  Either the refueling problem, difficult
piloting (or rather navigation) task, or something.  It is
allowable as it is the way the Aslan bridged the Riftspan Reach
gap (commercial ships are still only J-2 or J-3).  See GDW Alien
Module 1 for details.
 
I disagree that it creates a big problem with the Virus and the
Regency blockade.  The Virus doesn\'t have the refueling capability
to move a large fleet by the way of a deep space stop, and knowing
that the regency is watching for them, they wouldn\'t put
themselves at such a tactical disadvantage. (Less than 20 G-turns
of fuel remaining as opposed to the 40+ G-turns fully fueled)
 
It makes even less sense for merchantmen to use smaller J-drives
as this increases the travel time and decreases the profit.

One last point, In Arrival Vengence the ship rendevous with a deep
space comet for refueling on the way back to the regency.  This
allowed them to cross the Great Rift through the Gushemege,
Corridor, and Deneb sectors.  But the location and orbit of the
comet was a state secret for such an emergency.

First off, my cr0.02 about deep space jumps and refueling.  (Please keep
in mind my avowed aversion to rules details.)

I\'ve always considered that jump calculations use gravity wells as `targets\'.
The better your jump drive (jump-2 over jump-1, say) and/or the better your
navigator (navigation-2 over navigation-1, say) the better you are at
`targeting\' a specific gravity well.  Furthermore, the stronger a gravity
well (i.e. a star over a gas giant or giant over a rocky planet) the easier
it is to target  (it\'s also `stronger\' if you\'re closer).  Similarly, the
lesser the `interference\' of other gravity wells (no similarly or larger
massed objects in the vicinity - and `vicinity\' increases with mass) the
easier a specific gravity well is to target.

What this means is that in a typical system the largest star will be the 
easiest target.  Jumps from outside the system will require higher jump
numbers and/or higher skilled navigators to target smaller bodies like
gas giants and planets (and at least the star\'s well gets me `targeting\'
in the general vicinity).  The gas giants in a binary or trinary system
will be more difficult to target than those in a solitary system.  Similarly,
the planets in a system with several giants will be more difficult to target
than those in a system with only one giant.

With this premise `coordinated jumps\' are quite difficult which seems to
mesh with canonical thinking.  My fleet can probably all emerge in orbit
about a system\'s major gas giant but it will have to maneuver afterwards
to regain its formation.

Jumps to deep space are difficult because there is no gravity well to serve
as a target.  Even if I stage some sort of refueling post it will be
difficult to get close - the lack of any other significant gravity wells
in the vicinity helps but I\'m still targeting something *much* less
massive than a star, gas giant or planet.  It\'s possible but some ships
are going to emerge at a distance from the staging target that is beyond
the range of their maneuver drives/life support.  Fuel drones will get
there eventually since they don\'t have to worry about running out of
recycled air.  (I guess in this d**med New Era they\'ll run out of fuel too!)
As I build up fuel at the staging depot my gravity well will increase
making it easier to target but this will still be much more difficult than
jumping to a star system.

That\'s the rationale.  I don\'t have any specific rules to back it up.
Basically, if the ref wants them to make it they will, and if she doesn\'t,
they won\'t.  IMHO, that\'s role-playing.

Well, something like what all this *Smash and Grab* stuff is supposed to

I, King David I of Sacnoth, send my TL 12 fleet down to Gram, shoot up

The Confederation is really little more than a mutual-defense pact set up
to protect the Sword Worlds from Imperial incursions and to permit joint
`defensive\' operations against the Darrians.  Think more of NATO
than the European Union.

Sure, I do this if I value cheaper products over dependence upon Sacnoth
(or whatever world currently is on an `up\' cycle).  If I\'m as smart as the
Japanese I don\'t get caught in this trap.

There are other ways for Sacnoth to preserve its dominance.  The technology
of the US is largely available to Latin American nations.  Unfortunately,
many of these nations lack the stability, primarily political, required to
support a similar level of economic and technological achievement.  Fostering
this instability has been standard American policy for nearly a century.
One of the reasons Central Americans who can\'t own American cars don\'t build
their own factories is that the US military drops in every once and a 
while to topple the local government.  When we\'re not doing that we\'re
supplying arms to some `disgruntled duke\' who keeps the fires of instability
burning.  We are able to do this because we have the will and a significant
technological advantage.  The other Sword Worlds won\'t be able to `gang
up\' on Sacnoth for the same reason that everyone from the Rio Grande to
Tierra del Fuego hasn\'t `ganged up\' on the US.

If the King of Gram is equipping his navy with TL 12 equipment built on
Sacnoth then he\'s *not* doing what\'s best for Gram and his fief-holders
*ought* to depose him.

Well, except these other worlds don\'t keep invading the Imperium.  Clearly,
the Sword Worlds are able to coordinate their efforts well enough to fend
off not only Imperial military efforts to neutralized them but political
and economic efforts as well.  The Imperium has not been doing to the Sword
Worlds what I\'ve described for the US in Latin America and suggested for
Sacnoth within the Confederation.  If they\'ve tried, it hasn\'t worked or
the Sword Worlds wouldn\'t keep joining the Outworld Coalitions.  The Zhodani
may be a factor (although the alliance between the Zhos and the Sword
Worlds is one of convenience - there\'s little love for the Zhodani among
the Sword Worlds people) but I suspect there must be a great deal of political
and economic cooperation among the Sword Worlds to have permitted them
to remain independent.

Ooops!  Maybe I\'ve made your point.  Maybe this is why Sacnoth doesn\'t
just take over!  :-o  But then again, if relations among the Sword Worlds
are friendly then they ought to see some advantage in several high-tech
worlds with class A starports.  Maybe there is some sort of negotiated
`balance of power\': Sacnoth gets the high tech and Gram gets the shipyard?
(But don\'t the shipbuilding rules state that any world can build ships for
its own navy regardless of starport class?)

Well, first, the Confederation is nothing more than a bunch of cooperating
feudal technocracies (with some exceptions).

Second, keep in mind that, IMHO, GDW has never gotten the feudal technocracy
aspect of the Sword Worlds right.  The canonical take on this government
type has been merely a `high-tech\' aristocracy.

A feudal system is one in which ruling authority is granted to a specific
individual by others who provide support to that individual in return for
his efforts at coordinating their collective activities.  In medieval
times this was centered around common defense.  The fief-holders provided
military and economic support to the `lord\' and in return he used these
common forces to protect each of them from `barbarians\' and such.  In a
technocracy these efforts are not limited to military affairs but are
focused on the entire range of technological activities.  The `lord\' is
essentially the `chairman of the board\' of a huge conglomerate.  He
coordinates the activites of manufacturers, distributors, financiers,
retailers, etc. so that each can function in the marketplace.  It\'s something
like the Japanese kieritsu(sp?).  In the case of the Sword Worlds this
sort of thing is happening on a planetary scale.  Every technological (and
economic) interest on Sacnoth holds `fealty\' to the King.

Another good way to look at this is as a `plutocracy\'.  The economic elites
(`technocrats\' in a high-tech society) are also the political elites.  Unlike
conventional Western democracies (some might argue this point), there is
no separation between politcal power and economic power.  In the US we have
as much separation of `business and state\' as we do of `church and state\'
but in a technocracy this is not the case.  It\'s not like the `state-
controlled\' economies of the old East bloc - it\'s still a `capitalist\' system.
If your `company\' or `fief\' goes sour your political influence does as well
(because you can no longer support your `liege\').  Again, the Japanese
system - if you ignore the politcal government - is a good model.

Maybe, but again, if I\'m the King of Sacnoth my TL advantage permits me
to pretty much `smash and grab\' at will.

Now you see that in a feudal technocracy, technological power *is* political
power.

A good point.  I can\'t explain it.  As I understand it I don\'t see how any
world but the technological leader can be the dominant world.  (And Gram is
clearly mentioned as `dominating\' the Sword Worlds.)  Maybe the Zhodani
influence is a factor but it seems to me that the anti-Zhodani sentiments
in the Sword Worlds ought to work against this.  (The Contact article on
the Sword Worlds from *JTAS* mentions the anti-Zhodani sentiment.)

Hope my explanation of a feudal technocracy helped.  I don\'t see any specific
reason why it should apply to inter-world relations except that since many
Sword Worlds are feudal technocracies I would expect them to take a similar
approach to inter-world affairs.  I just don\'t see a bunch of economic barons
voting and negotiating joint communiques.

> Oh, dear! You really have a gamer\'s mentality, don\'t you? (And, yes, here I
> am being snide ;-)

Yes, I admit it.  I want the Sword Worlds to be as fractious and quarrelsome
as they were in Piper\'s *Space Viking*.  You see, since `my\' Sword Worlds
have always been that way I *really* have no use for the rehashed Space
Viking-wannabees of the Reformation Coalition.

(Speaking of rehashing Piper, does anyone remember how much that Amber Zone
article about the `rogue\' Sword Worlds captain in the 800-ton mercenary
cruiser from the post-5FW war *JTAS* seemed *so* familiar to the plot of
*Space Viking*?  You know, the Sword Worlder who had (in this case) her
fiance killed just as they were to be married and so sold the family
estate to buy a ship and go hunting for the killer?)

Another good point but only because I don\'t think the Sword Worlds have

Maybe, but keep in mind the US policy in Latin America.  Sacnoth doesn\'t
*need* to dominate militarily in order to dominate.  Especially if the
economies are as integrated as you\'ve described then the feudal technocracy
extends *across* the subsector and there ought to arise someone at the
top and that someone ought to be the highest tech world.

Well, it seems to explain the way the Sword Worlds have been portrayed better
than how I *think* they *ought* to be portrayed.  :-)  I guess I need to
understand what causes these cycles - why doesn\'t this occur in the Imperium?

I\'m sitting on the fence here.  I guess I\'m struggling with those differences
in the Sword Worlds that were introduced either to keep them `different\' 
from Piper\'s novel or just because whomever `created\' them wasn\'t really as
much of a Sword Worlds fanatic as I am.  In either case, I just don\'t 
think the differing TLs and lack of several starports in the Sword Worlds
makes sense and I\'d like to `fix\' in in TNE.

Thanks, Hans, for the chance to work through this.  I hope it continues.

Yes, this is a must!  I would only suggest that an initial `jump drone\' is
dispatched as soon as the in-system forces are engaged by a hostile force -
just in case things go poorly you wouldn\'t want the drone not to be
dispatched at all.  Better to have the folks at the next base prematurely
worried than surprised.

This is a great rationale for the improvement of starports in the Sword
Worlds.  I can just see the Deneb Information Service (DIS) news brief
now:  "Oberlindes Lines Announces Shipbuilding Contract with Gorram
Yards on Gram/Sword Worlds".

Excellent idea.  Some variations would be to introduce the "Circuit Judge"
like "Judge Roy Bean" (sp?) or even Judge Dread (without the weapons).

I\'ve always wondered how they would take a case to a higher "off-world" court.

You also could have an inter-system bodyguard operation for important
personages like: the visiting diplomat, professor, surgeon, or scientist.

How about introducing the players to some important personage and have
one of them call hime "recalcitrant" and have the locals misinterpret it
as "thick head".  Don\'t laugh, our Prime Minister did it to the Indonesian
Leader.  Substitute whatever words you like but make it a grave insult
and have them carted off for flogging or something equally violent.

    'body' => 'Shiela-X was a player character with an excellent (although somewhat
nutso) player.  She was converted to an NPC when my original campaign
"blew itself to smithereens" in 1989.  I liked the character so much
she started showing up in other player\'s adventures.

Shiela-X  

Str	9
Dex	B
End	7
Int	8
Edu	A (4) see below
S.S.	3
Psi (none to speak of)

Skills;  Pilot-5, Computer-3,Sensor Ops-3, Streetwise-2, Pistol-2, SMG-2, 
Shotgun-1, Gunnery(Missile turret)-1, Tactics-1, Navigation (old traveller)-2
Electronics-3, Engineerong-3

Shiela\'s father was a knife, her mother a test tube.  Yes, Shiela-X is an 
AP, or Artificial Person (hence the low S.S.).  Her DNA was combined from
several different persons.  Her purpose as designed was to be a deep space
scout for the Scout Service.

Shiela-X is a tall distinctive-looking, woman.  Her figure is thin, but the
way she dresses reveals her sex without question.  She works out
semi-constantly (high End., Str), and often wears tight spandex outfits
(one of her favorites is transparent) especially in battle, which she lives for.
She is also often seen in leather hip-length boots.

She is almost never seen without her Cigar, a huge Freudian thing which she 
chews on especially when angry or nervous.  She lights it after sex, battle, or
to annoy people.

Her hair she wears extremely short, and bleached pale white.  Her manner is
gruff and judgemental.  Her favorite choice of action is the "smash and grab"
even when such a course is foolhardy.

Shiela was "made" in the Spinward Marches, she is unsure where.  But when her
\'control programming\' failed and she went rogue she was at Mora/Mora.  She
killed several guards in her escape, some of them had already surrendered to
her.  The Imperial authorities have a warrant ("Armed and Dangerous") out
for her arrest or retrieval of her body (reward of 100,00 Cr).

If she likes you she may show you where they tatooed her serial number.  Chances
are you\'ll see it eventually since she likes to shock people with what she
wears.

Favorite Weapon; 

(casual) a big auto pistol (.44 automag, typically)
(in Battle) a flechette loaded 11mm pump shotgun

Favorite Dance;

The Tango (one of the few times the cigar comes out)

Favorite Food;

Combat Rations (bred into her for scout work)

Remember, just about everything about Shiela-X, her anti-social behavior,
her tastes, her auto-eroticism (she\'s very sexually self-centered) is due to
her designers desire to create a tool for deep space exploration.  She was 
intended to be put alone of a type S for months or years at a time and sent out
into the unexplored vastness.  It was found that regular humans required 
companionship too badly, and computers/robots did not have the required
independence of thought to survive or make the missilns successful.

Her training as a pilot began at a very early age (to the detriment of other
subjects like History, Literature, etc) along with training in electronics,
computers, navigation, engineering, a smattering of weapons skills and tactics
intending to give her survival skills for almost any situation.

Her education therefore is excellent in areas like metallurgy, botany, biology
(not sufficient for skill levels, just a good general knowledge), but terrible
for history, literature, philosophy, or psychology.  Judgements should be made 
regarding which level is used for a given roll.

Shiela escaped her keepers at the age of 16, and after stealing a small ship
made it appear as if she crashed it (actually making a controlled crash from
secondary controls in the engine room) which destroyed the entire front section
of the craft.  This was in the Mertractor system on a planet with a large 
underground society.  She disappeared into this realm for awhile (learning her 
streetwise skills here), making friends and contacts.

The Imps eventually figured out she was still alive (she blew up an arboretum)
and began pursuing her in earnest.  Note that in my campign world there is a
serious aversion to cloning or creating persons artificially.

At the time of our adventures She was about 32 years old.  She paired up with 
the rebellious (and Psionic) Son of the Duchess of Mertractor, Quentin Xavier
Bim III, but he is another story.


Personal note;

Typically my players and I would play Traveller (the original) in a classroom
where we went to college (Clark University, Worcester MA).  We never knew which
 of several classrooms would be available, so we would write on the blackboards
in the lobby of the building, "Shiela-X where are you?" in big letters, and 
the room number in small ones at the bottom.

Years later, people were still seeing "Shiela-X where are you" on those black-
boards on occasion.  The game long since ended.

I think that instead it\'s calculations based on charted positions,
etc.  While your idea is interesting, how do you locate the
targets?  Also, this seems to be against the 100 diameter idea: you
want to be far away from gravity wells, not close to them.  

I think that you target your ship towards a coordinate in space,
not towards a gravity well...

If I were a player in your campaign, I would want to know how my ship
is targeting gravity wells parsecs away: that would indicate alot of 
interesting possiblities ;-)

Erm.  The old, old _High Guard_ rules said that was an option for planetary
navies.  I guess to allow tech-8 E-starport worlds to have rockets (and
hence explain Earth.)  It probably isn\'t exactly true now.  There\'s an
interesting discussion of shipbuilding in the RC in _Path Of Tears_ about
B-port worlds building starships with drives imported from A-port worlds.
The "One Small Step" articles in _Challenge_ also allowed some minor
shipbuilding on low port worlds, but I forget the details.  (Of course,
in old _High Guard_, you couldn\'t build tech-8 ships....)

I\'m not sure about the current TNE ruling.

If you don\'t like the TNE computer virus, why not just replace it with a 
\'green\' virus, i.e. one that kills off plants or living creatures. Give it a 
long enough incubation period and assume it can be carried as spores or 
bacteria or something in starship air or on crew boots or in crew people, 
etc. and make it attack livestock or food crops (or even people) and you 
have quite enough reason for complete collapse of planets plus paranoia 
about infection from outside (i.e. the Regency \'blockade\'; or is it the 
Coalition - I don\'t have TNE).

It might be more believable that after a few years someone would come up 
with a means of neutralising this (innoculation?) than the strange lengths 
required to fight a computer virus. It also explains the spread of the virus 
more easily and doesn\'t require suspension of belief with regard to the 
(computer) virus\' infection methods.

Anyone working in germ warfare care to elaborate? :)

I\'m sure someone must have thought this one up before?

Remember, too, that RQS patrols *all* borders, even the Zhodani and
spinward ones.  Not as heavily, but it\'s a safety measure in case
someone screws up their part of the border.  Also don\'t forget that
the Zhodani/Vargr are patrolling an area to coreward that may not
be clearly marked on the current map.  (People who have _Survival
Margin_ and TNE know about the variability of maps, i.e. the Black
"Sphere".)  The Aslan are a first line of defense for the jump-5
Riftspan route to the old Hierate, as seen from the Regency.

Judging by the text, sadly minimal.  The Exploration Office is
apparently shut down.  Contact & Liaison and Survey are apparently
restricted to operations inside the Regency...updating old 
cartography and maintaining internal mutual understanding among
the various sophont species of the area.  I miss the IISS.

I suppose that it is possible the RISS is quietly trying to maintain
the old IISS Group offices out in Theta Borealis and Sigma Zephyrus,
though.  The old sector staff was pretty committed, and they may yet
have *some* small discretionary funds.  It\'d be a shoestring operation,
though.  There might also be some long-range Imperial base ships like
the Solomani ones that have not yet returned from multi-decade missions
to spinward, or even gone back out -- they have to be fairly self-
sufficient.

And the next thing you know Sacnoth is being visited by the combined fleets
of the rest of the Sword Worlds who are anxious to ensure that you won\'t
visit their world next.

Yes, that was my own impression. Though perhaps it is a little more. The
original Sword Worlders were refugees from a lost war. Perhaps this gave
them an Us-and-Them mentality that prevails to this day. You can fight
between yourselves, but only if you don\'t cripple the other guy so much
he can\'t help against \'Them\'.

Which may be why Sachnoth is due for their own downturn on the cycle in the
not too distant future.

Think about this for a moment. Sacnoth is not the US in that analogy, they 
are another one of the Latin nations.

Ah! There\'s another point. _Significant_ is a significant word here (;-).
How significant is an advantage of 12 over 11 and 10? The only figures I
have are some from Steve Higginbotham that are based on his extensive
experience with Trillion Credit Squadron campaigns. So they apply to
Classic Traveller. Quite possibly (almost certainly) things are different 
under Megatraveller and New Era rules, but how different and in what 
direction is difficult to say, so I will stick to Steve\'s until someone
comes up with better ones. According to him, and assuming competent ship
designs, a TL 12 fleet is twice as efficient, ton for ton, as a TL 11 and
six times as efficient as TL 10. Not an impossible imbalance to overcome
when you\'re 20 to one (I don\'t have the Sword World population figures
here. What is the population of Sacnoth compared to the rest of the
Confederation? It\'s no use being twice as good as the other fellow if 
there\'s 10 of him.)   -  even if the other worlds don\'t buy TL 12 ships
elsewhere.

Depends on what he buys. Some things (like computers) would be risky, other
things could be checked against sabotage. But perhaps he buys them from the
Imperium instead. After all, they are propably playing the US to the Sword
Worlds\' Latin America.

>Clearly,

I don\'t see how that follows at all. The only times the Sword Worlds
invade the Imperium is with promise of Zhodani help. You can\'t make
many assumptions based on how people behave when they think they have
a powerful ally.

>The Imperium has not been doing to the Sword

Based on the constant instability of the Sword Worlds it seems to me that
that may be precisely what the Imperium has been doing.

If they\'ve tried, it hasn\'t worked or
>the Sword Worlds wouldn\'t keep joining the Outworld Coalitions. 

On the contrary, if the Imperium has been doing that it explains why the
Sword Worlds are PO\'d enough to keep on joining an alliance that has struck 
out again and again.

I\'ve no doubt they are a major factor.

And maybe the Imperium sees that advantage too and meddles to prevent it?

As mentioned above I disagree. I\'m also not at all sure that he would want
to. He may have the statesman mentality rather than the wargamer mentality.

As I\'ve replied, technological power _enhances_ other kinds of power. A 2/1
advantage is nice, but only decisive if everything else is balanced.

Well, I still believe that your understanding is mistaken. A population 1 
million world with TL 12 is weaker than a population 10 million world with 
TL 11. Or 10 population 1 million worlds with TL 11. Not to mention the
central point in my theory of Sword World economic-technological cycles:
The TL 11 worlds had TL 12 themselves not so long ago and still retain
TL 12 ships.

I really think you should try to make up an explanation that fits the known
facts rather than to make up an explanation and change the facts to fit them.
(But I know just how you feel. I have the same attitude to the conduct of
the Aslan and Vargr in the Rebellion. The only way they could have the
succes they are described as having is if the whole Deneb Domain is run
by imbeciles or traitors. There\'s no way they could be the threat thay are
portrayed as unless their military opponents are hopeless incompetents. So
perhaps my disagreement with you is just that I _can_ see a way for the
Sword Worlds to work the way they are described while you can\'t.)

There\'s no answer to this argument (I know, I\'ve used it myself ;-). All
I can say is: Try sitting down one day and start all over by listing known 
facts about the Sword Worlds, discarding all your own interpretations for 
a while, and then try to make sense of them  -  just as an interlectual
excercise. Perhaps you\'ll come up with something useful.

Think about the kingdoms of medieval Europe. There were some mixing of
feudal duties between kings (especially between England and France). But
eventually the individual countries prevailed over the feudal structure.
There\'s no reason why a king should welcome a feudal pattern just because
their own power is based on it. And, in fact, we KNOW they don\'t. If they
did the Sword Worlds would be an empire instead of a confederation.

I am announcing my plans to create a second Traveller Mailing List.

TNE, for good or ill, has caused a deep division in Traveller gamers. A
large number of very productive TMLers have dropped off the list as the
TNE material (most specifically, the TNE setting) have made TML no
longer interesting to them.

These people feel they no longer have a forum where they can discuss
Traveller topics of interest to them. We\'ve lost a lot of creative and
interesting people. This represents a loss of valuable talent to the
game and a loss to the TML community.

This is a behavior similar to when people unsubscribe from a newsgroup
when the "signal-to-noise ratio" grows too small. When this happens,
often an enterprising individual suggests that the newsgroup be enhanced
by division into different topical areas.

So, I am announcing my intention (again, for good or ill) to create a
topical sublist disjoint from (but related to) TML. This list will exist
to discuss the Imperium in the Classic and Rebellion period. It will
focus on the black book and MegaTraveller environment. It will not be a
totally TNE-free zone. Depending on initial response, application of TNE
rules to the Classic and Rebellion settings may be tolerated.

I have not yet decided on a name for this sublist. Nor am I taking
subscriptions for it at this time. The TML, however, will be the first
to know when the mechanisms are ready.

Please spread the word. Let disaffected former TML subscribers know that
this is in the works.

Perhaps it is no longer true, but it used to be that you GAINED
cargo space by doing a number of smaller jumps (the fuel usage
can be recalculated based on a smaller ship\'s mass--if you base
fuel usage solely on hull size, use inflatable or drop tanks).
In addition, you saved space by using a smaller jump drive.

Without TNE, I am at a disadvantage.  It occurs to me that a
large fleet action would not be necessary, though.  Why not
penetrate to the center of the Regency where they are not so
vigilant and "infect" them from the inside out?

> It makes even less sense for merchantmen to use smaller J-drives

This is a reasonable argument, although I believe that most
merchants will not have large jump drives.  They are far too
expensive, and less of your ship is dedicated to cargo.  They
will likely restrict their trade to nearer stars, except in
special cases, which would justify either the extra expense
or the extra time.

Again, things may have changed, but it used to be that a
large jump drive (and equipment to support it) overwhelmed
the cost of a ship, to the point where it was generally not
profitable to use one in a trader.

I think we are all in agreement.  The background states that jumps
to deep space are possible, but indirectly implies that they must
not be easy.  We already know gravity affects jumps, why not use it
as a \'target\' as David Johnson suggests (perhaps even a mandatory
one)?  This is consistent with the Arrival Vengeance using a comet
(it has it\'s own gravity well, even though it is small).  Perhaps
sufficiently dense "dark matter" could even be used, but precisely
locating it might be difficult.

1121-1130
  312-1130 Quarantine established
1131-1140
1141-1150
1151-1160
1161-1170
1171-1180
1181-1190
1191-1200

Significant dates are still needed for the following:
 Declaration of the Regency
 The `Rape of Trin\' (Gram?)
 Death of Norris(?)
 Openings to the Zhodani(?)
 Others?

THE QUARANTINE LINE

>From PBJuzyk <psualum@aol.com>:

When Norris established the Quarantine (312-1130) the Patrol was
combined with part of the Regency Interstellar Scout Service
(Exploration and External Mapping branches) to form the Regency
Quarantine Service (RQS).  Communications (xboat & courier service) and
Internal Mapping functions remained unchanged (within the borders of the
Regency).  The RQS soon became a separate service.

The Quarantine border was extended to more defensible positions and is
several parsecs deep to prevent high jump performance ships from leaping
over the blockade.  By 1201 this border ran through the following
subsectors:

	Deneb: 		B - G - K - O
	Reft:			C - B - F - E - I
	Trojan Reach:	L - P - O
	Riftspan Reaches:	C - G - F - E

The Scout/Courier ships now available to the RQS were modified to create
Quarantine Cutters quickly followed by the addition of 70-ton Inspection
Launches.  The RQS still wasn\'t able to maintain a virus-proof seal
along the entire border which resulted in the creation of the RQS
Auxiliary comprised of private citizens assisting the patrol of the
border.  Later 150-ton Quarantine Cutters (stretched versions of the
Scout) entered into use by the RQS.

SUBSECTOR MAPS AND UWP DATA

I would suggest a typical subsector on each of the Regency frontiers: the
Zhodani frontier (Jewell), the Vargr frontier (Regina, Aramis, or Pretoria),
the Virus frontier (Lamas, Dunmag or Usani) and the Aslan *ihatei* frontier
(Tobia, Gazulin, Pax Rulin or Glisten).  The capital subsector, Mora, would
be representative of the Regency \'core\'.  Maybe a subsector in the Deneb Wilds?

Let\'s follow the *Path of Tears* format with Imperial Era (IE) and Post-
Imperial Era (PIE) UWP stats.

MAJOR WORLDS OF THE REGENCY

Major worlds ought to be Mora/Mora, Deneb/Usani, Gazulin/Gazulin,
Regina/Regina, Rhylanor/Rhylanor, Glisten/Glisten, Lintl/Vestus,
Pretoria/Pretoria, Magash/Sabine, Vincennes/Vincennes and Lunion/Lunion.

Any other candidates?

REGENCY GOVERNMENT

Using the *World Builders\' Handbook* model, executive authority is obviously
held by a `ruler\' - the Regent.  What about legislative authority?  Under
the Imperium this was also held by the `ruler\' - the Emperor.  The suggestions
of greater `democracy\' in the Regency might be apparent here.  In a mulit-
body legislature (Moot?) the aristocracy would certainly still have a voice
so let\'s call the upper house the `Chamber of Nobles\'.  A second body might
be the `Chamber of Delegates\' that is composed of representatives from
individual worlds (probably with representation weighted by population - one
doubts Pop 1 worlds will have the same say as Pop A worlds, especially since
the Chamber of Nobles will already reflect this bias).  Might there be a
third (or fourth?) house?  Generally, legislative authority in the Regency
would be classed as `several councils\' in *WBH* terms.

While primary authority will be executive (the Regent), secondary judicial
authority might also exist to complement the secondary legislative authority.
Again, under the Imperial system judicial authority was held by the single
ruler and `delegated\' down through the aristocracy.  My sense is that the
Regents will still maintain judicial authority similar to the Imperial model.

Therefore, in *WBH* lingo the Regency has a primary executive/judicial ruler
with several secondary legislative councils.

*POT* apparently has a table of all RC worlds, their populations, political
bloc and number of representatives.  Anyone care to post a list of Regency
worlds with populations (maybe Roger\'s hypertext can help here?) and we can
work on representatives from there?

REGENCY POLITICS

The Nobility:

Archduke of Deneb and Regent: Norris? Seldrian? Avery?
Duchess of Mora: Elane Shankarr Muudashir at Mora
 -Leader of the Aristocratic bloc, possibly
Duke/Duchess of Deneb: Aleksandr Lagaashinga or his heir at Deneb
 -Leader of the Imperialist bloc?
Duke/Duchess of Gazulin: Sharik Arcadia or her heir at Gazulin
 -The most prrominent new Democrat?
Duke/Duchess of Regina: Seldrian Aledon or her heir at Regina
Duke/Duchess of Glisten: at Glisten

 -Possibly a leader of the Santanocheevists?
Duke/Duchess of Vestus: at Lintl
Duke/Duchess of Pretoria: at Pretoria
Duke/Duchess of Sabine: at Magash
Duke/Duchess of Vincennes: at Vincennes?
 -Where does Count Audine Garhik, Marquis Vincennes (Norris\'s nephew)
  fit in here?  If Count Audine is Marquis of Vincennes but not Duke
  then where is the Duke\'s seat?  Why isn\'t it Vincennes if the subsector
  capital is there?
Duke/Duchess of Lunion: at Lunion
Duke/Duchess of Trin\'s Veil: no longer at Trin!
 -Possibly a leader of the Isolationist bloc
Duke/Duchess of Vilis: at Frenzie

 -Prominent in the Expansionist bloc
Duke/Duchess of Gulf: at Qevar
Duke/Duchess of Zeng: at Zeng

Other dukes/duchesses-in-exile who will be prominent in the House of
Nobles and the Aristocratic and Imperialist blocs:

Duke/Duchess of Antra/Deneb
Duke/Duchess of Million/Deneb
Duke/Duchess of Atsah/Deneb? (overrun by Vargr during the Rebellion)
Duke/Duchess of Tobia/Trojan Reach: heir of Duke Alexander

These political blocs have been suggested:

Isolationists want to maintain the Quarantine.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Trin\'s Veil?
Expansionists want to move out into the Wilds.
 -Enjoys Instellarms backing.
Democrats seek to expand `democratic\' values.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Gazulin?
Aristocrats want to maintain the noble aristocracy.
 -Led by Duchess Elane of Mora
 -Possibly known as Muudashirists?
 -Enjoy much support among the House of Nobles
Tolerants favor a relaxation of psi prejudices.
 -Discretely supported by SuSAG.
Santanocheevists oppose any moves toward accommodation with the Zhodani.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Rhylanor?
 -Enjoys Instellarms backing.
Imperialists still hope to one day resurrect the Old Imperium.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Deneb?
 -Enjoys support from Tukera Lines.
Autnomists favor independence and a complete break from the Imperial past.

Here\'s an `alliance\' template:

codes: o = favorable, x = opposed

What is the nature of the Regency government?  Someone mentioned that Avery
from *AV* serves as a cabinet minister(?) to Seldrian (the Regent) which
suggests some sort of ministerial portfolios (cabinet posts for Americans).
What is the nature of the relationship between the Regency Moot and the 
Regent?  Does the Moot have any `real\' power?  What about the relationship
between the Chambers of the Moot?  How are members of the Chamber of
Delegates chosen?  Is this decided by each individual world or are there
`common\' standards throughout the Regency?  If there is some sort of voting,
who gets to vote?  Everyone?  Adults only?  Literate adults?  Propertied
adults?  How long after I move from Junidy to Strouden can I vote there?

Remember that even a system where *only* the Chamber of Nobles has some sort
of `limited\' veto power over the Regent is one that is more `democratic\' than
was the Old Imperium.

REGENCY LANGUAGE

Anyone care to offer a few examples of Riftian jargon after 70 years of
divergence from Galanglic?

QUARANTINE SERVICE AND REGENCY PATROL

>From PBJuzyk <psualum@aol.com>:

Regency Quarantine Service

When Norris established the Quarantine (312-1130) the Patrol was
combined with part of the Regency Interstellar Scout Service
(Exploration and External Mapping branches) to form the Regency
Quarantine Service (RQS).  Communications (xboat & courier service) and
Internal Mapping functions remained unchanged (within the borders of the
Regency).  The RQS soon became a separate service.

The Scout/Courier ships now available to the RQS were modified to create
Quarantine Cutters quickly followed by the addition of 70-ton Inspection
Launches.  The RQS still wasn\'t able to maintain a virus-proof seal
along the entire border which resulted in the creation of the RQS
Auxiliary comprised of private citizens assisting the patrol of the
border.  Later 150-ton Quarantine Cutters (stretched versions of the
Scout) entered into use by the RQS.

The above data on the RQS is pieced together from Survival Margin and
T:TNE manual.  The following is my conjectures on tactics of the RQS as
well as some additional necessary assets.  For each system that contains
gas giant(s) and/or a world with water present the RQS will need to base
assets able to defend those sites and send messages to other systems in
the Zone.  This would include manned bases in position around such
planets and small fighter craft in addition to the ships normally in use
by the RQS.

When a ship arrives at a system within the Zone and is detected by RQS
sensors they will be hailed.  If they respond they will be instructed to
rendezvous with either a Quarantine Cutter or an Inspection Launch
depending on the size of the ship.  If any problems arise when
communication is attempted the RQS will dispatch armed craft (either
Cutters or fighters who tend to shoot first and ask questions later.
Fighters would be designed with high manuever capabilities and would be
based at all refueling sources.

They would not be launched until a suspect ship is fairly close.  This
provides multiple benefits: the fighters have ample fuel, the incoming
ships are low on fuel, the bases are close-by so are able to provide
heavy fire support (Particle Accelerators and Meson Guns).  Another
option would be to replace some or all of the fighters with remotely
piloted vehicles operated from the base.

Finally should incoming hostile forces overcome an RQS base there must
be some means for notifying other nearby systems.  This is accomplished
by maintaining a small unmanned station outside of the 100 diameter zone
which contains jump torpedoes.  When RQS forces are nearly overwhelmed a
signal is sent to the station which then launches all of its torpedoes.
Each torpedo is preset to enter jumpspace at the proper time.  One
torpedo is sent to each nearby system.  As part of the notification
signal additional data can be transmitted and sent with the torpedo such
as compostion of enemy forces.  When the torpedo arrives at its
destination it begins broadcasting its message to RQS bases.  This
system is a response to the Rape of Trin and currently only 1 in 3
systems are equiped with these stations.

REGENCY NAVY AND ARMY

This would seem to follow pretty much the Imperial model although there
looks like there might be a good debate taking off on this issue now.

QUARANTINE AREA OF OPERATIONS

So the Quarantine Line runs through Lamas/Deneb, Dunmag/Deneb, Usani/Usani,
Kamlar/Deneb, C/Reft, Macon/Reft, F/Reft, Usher/Reft, L/Trojan Reach,
P/Trojan Reach, O/Trojan Reach and the subsectors in the Riftspan Reaches.
Who maintains the Line in these *ihatei*-occupied subsectors in Trojan
Reach and the Riftspan Reaches?

What\'s the mission of the Quarantine Service?  Can anyone produce a map
of the entire Quarantine Line?  Are there any places were the Quarantine Line
has recently been expanded?  To follow the *POT* template we ought to provide
maps and UWP data for such worlds.

REGENCY MEGACORPS

Delgado Trading (miniturization, heavy mining & refining, publishing and
   trading)
- -A key player in the war against the Virus.

General Products (starships, non-starships, heavy machinery)
- -Quality problems were threatening existence by Rebellion.  Domain/Regency
 susbsidies would be likely in order to maintain a major shipbuilder (cf.
 the Chrysler bailout).

GSbAG (starships)
- -Probably doing well equipping the Quarantine Service and the Deneb Navy.

Hortalez et Cie (banking and investment)
- -With addition of Zirunkariish assets most likely dominates Domain.

Instellarms (military products)
- -Probably doing well, although mercenary actions can be expected to be
 limited in Deneb by government efforts to conserve resources.  Can be
 expected to favor the Expansionists and Santanocheevists.

Ling Standard Products (mining, electronics and computers, starships,
   starship systems, power generation, small arms)
- -Probably the primary commercial and military contractor combating the Virus.

SuSAG (chemicals, pharmaceuticals, geneering, extra-Imperial psi drugs)
- -Will the illegal psi drug manufacturing move into the Regency?  Obviously,
 SuSAG will support the Tolerant bloc, if not openly then certainly with
 financial backing.

Sternmetal Horizons (mining, manufacturing, power generation, food processors)
- -Probably doing well.

Tukera Lines (shipping)
- -Probably still active and possibly a supporter of the Imperialist bloc.

Vilani Bureaux (probably not active in Deneb after the Collapse):
  Makhidkarun
  Sharurshid
  Naasirka (assets acquired by LSP?)
  Zirunkariish (assets acquired by Hortalez)

Depending on your POV, it might be more applicable to equate the Mromons
with TNE people, making the TNE rules the Book of Mormon. Or better yet,
make TNE part of the Walkdenbooks New Age religions, perhaps with TNE being
the "Newly Revised PC Bible".

No offense meant to any of those groups, of course. Besides, I don\'t play

Many alien races supposedly travel abroad.  When the virus
struck, many of these travellers were stuck in the Regency far
away from their home worlds.
 
The Newts travelled around a lot, so there are probably a few of

Believe me, they make enormous military sense!  Deep space stations 
(particularly mine) altered the entire strategic picture of the 
Islands War in Steve\'s TCS game.  The use of deep space stations would
have changed the entire course of the Fifth Frontier War, if the Zhos 
or the Imperials had used them...

Deep space stations are nearly impossible for the enemy to find *by
chance* (unlike solar systems); since they can be placed anywhere, 
there is NO border anymore, and no chance of predicting where the 
attack is coming from, and NO chance of intercepting the enemy fleet 
before it is in your system.  The war changes to one of fortifying and
defending bodies of strategic interest, like home worlds and major 
colonies.  In such an environment, habitable gas giant moons are a 
pearl beyond price, because the 100-diameter radius of a gas giant is 
well outside the orbits of the moons, giving the defender halfway 
decent warning of an enemy fleet on his doorstep... Otherwise, your 
planet better have massive orbital fortifications and/or planetary 
defenses, or it is a sitting duck for the first fleet to pop out of 
jump-space at the 100-diameter limit.  Your fleet will have no chance 
to defend against that attack before the enemy fleet is close enough 
to your world to bombard it or launch a ground assault.

The above comments about habitable gas giant moons also apply to 
hostile inner-zone worlds that are inside the 100-diameter jump limit 
of a star... They are also defensible with a fleet.  Perhaps strategic
considerations merited the colonization of some of those 
"overpopulated hellholes"?

I\'ve rationalized the use of deep space stations in the Islands, and 
lack of their use by the Imperium by deciding that it is a very 
difficult navigational task to jump to and from deep space points. 
The Island nations had a good supply of such skilled navigators 
because the Island worlds are so scattered that merchant ships and 
many military vessels *must* use multiple deep-space jumps to get 
anywhere.  Most of the Imperial worlds are close enough together that 
Imperial ships can jump from world to world, and thus the necessary 
skill to be a ship\'s navigator isn\'t as high, and deep-space jumping 
is not a standard part of basic Imperial navigator training.  I 
also venture to add that Impy merchants consider deep-space jumping
as risky a practice as burning unrefined fuel in your jump drive, and 
discourage it.  So do their insurers.  Someone else can explain why 
the Imperial Navy and Zho Navy don\'t do it very often...

The effects would be too different.  First, viruses tend to be *very*
species specific.  It would be likely the outside alien governments
would get missed.  Second, if it destroyed the ecosystems of planets,
the Imperial core would be essentially rendered uninhabitable, especially
if the "virus" was persistent in nature.  Third, unlike the computer
virus, direct physical contact would be required to spread the virus.
Fourth, the rate of spread would either be slow enough to save outliers
(like, say, the Solomani Confederation), or unnoticable enough to 
sneak into Deneb undectected.  

It might be possible to work up a plausible scenario of some sort, but
it would be substantially different in form than the TNE scenario.

Out of curiousity, how many of you are interested in Sky Galleons of Mars,
that is, you play (or would if you had more opponents, scenarios etc.)?

For those who don\'t remember, SGoM is the game of sky vessel combat that is
somewhat cut down and included in Space:1889.

A second question for those who are interested, would you be interested in 
playing in a campaign game of the English & Regency fleet vs the Oenotrians
(plus perhaps High Martian & pirate problems)?

Roughly, what I have in mind is for various Admirals and squadron leaders
to have to carry out a variety of missions (patrols, support the ground troops,
try to disrupt enemy supplies, put down pirates, or direct assault on enemy
fleets) on a campaign level.  Where opposing forces arrive in the same place
at the same time, a battle is fought using SGoM.  

If there is interest shown, I\'ll expand on these ideas a bit.

HISTORY OF THE IMPERIUM WORKING GROUP
- --Clay Bush, 30-April-1994

This a general post for all Traveller afficionados out there. It\'s an
insider\'s view of a Traveller fan organization.
- ----

What is HIWG?
============= 
HIWG is a multi-national organization of Traveller fans. That\'s as specific a
definition as I\'ve come up with.
 
It started in 1987 when MegaTraveller came out, and was to develop Imperial
history. It did a lot of this, and many ideas went into Rebellion Sourcebook
and other products. It outgrew this focus, though, as people exchanged
programs, wrote up sectors, and developed races.

A good portion of MEMBERS\' work has seen print. HIWG itself has several
newsletters (AAB Proceedings is the general newsletter, STARBURST is the
Australia-New Zealand newsletter, and WHITE NOISE is the current United
Kingdom newsletter), but it does not and will not publish any supplements
itself. No collection of 100+ scattered people can imitate a company
successfully.
 
Instead, there is a list of people who joined HIWG, wrote some documents, and
developed their ideas enough that GDW (or others) chose to publish them.
 
We see our function as a meeting place for fans, and we expect good things to
happen from people interacting. It\'s hard to predict what will develop in
advance, as we\'ve discovered.

The discussion has been muted as everyone waited to see TNE when it came out.
It is picking up steam, however, now that all the core pieces of TNE are out.

LAND GRANTS 
To encourage ownership and friendly competition, we allocated sectors and
areas to "analysts." Some of this material has seen print as library data,
some published sectors have had their worlds named by HIWgers, and others are
very sketchy. HIWG got credits, but Fugate did end MTJ4 with a note that HIWG
material was too much "why" and not enough start-adventure-here. 

Nevertheless, much of HIWG\'s material is about detailing sectors and their
inhabitants. GDW selected specific a HIWG member to collapse the rest of Old
Expanses, and other "collapse the sector" projects are underway. The results
will be in the HIWG library, along with the collected official sector UWP
files.

To prevent overloading one person, HIWG divided the Imperial universe into
four "quadrants." The four met at Reference/Core. With the Virus leveling
Imperial space, HIWG may develop some new organization to better fit the new
realities. It\'s being kicked around by members. 

OTHER PROJECTS
There were also a number of equipment and ship designs that HIWGers
exchanged.
Witha new system (Fire, Fusion, and Steel) to absorb, this has died down. It
will pick up after members finish revising their worksheets and programs. We
are looking at starting a design special interest group to handle exchanging
this information.

(Bryan Borich\'s "Starships, Starports, and Vehicles" distributed MT craft
designs. People contributed their own, and Bryan verified, compiled, and
distributed them. Bryan\'s been busy with work in that "real world" where we
get paychecks, and FF&S is still new, but I expect a restart before the 1994
is out.)
 
There is also some interest in a Classic Traveller working group and an
Alternate Technologies working group. Neither is yet a working entity, but
HIWG\'s results have always depended on what members decided to put in.

HIWG LIBRARY 
Most work is exchanged in numbered documents. (The numbering system is being
revised to separate New Era from Rebellion era work.) The library also
contains a few programs, sector UWP files, and other collected data.

HIWG documents are available on disk or as hardcopy. I think most people
reading this post will prefer the disk versions. If I pulled together all the
documents and files that have been done, I would fill eight 1.44MB disks.

(If a HIWGer writes an adventure, it goes off to someone as a submission. And
quite a few get published. The adventures just aren\'t in the HIWG library.)

MEMBERSHIP
Membership gets you copies of AAB Proceedings, a membership directory, and a
list of documents. Programs we exchange between people who have the same
machines (Mac, IBM, Atari), and interest groups with their own newsletter
form
around interesting areas.

Membership is available at US$2.00 per issue of AABP from the membership
secretary. Usual membership payment is US$12. Send to:

Good point.  I hope I\'m not trying to `force\' the Sword Worlds into my own
view of how they `should\' be but clearly that\'s how I\'m being perceived.
I\'ll have to try harder.

This is some really good stuff, except I thought Sharurshid and the other
Vilani megacorps had withdrawn to the Ziru Sirka during the Rebellion?
[WARNING: I don\'t have TNE!]  It seems to me that even if the Vilani
Bureaux had maintained a presence in the Domain of Deneb this presence
would have been cut-off by the Virus and the Quarantine Line and the
`Imperial\' megacorps would have assumed control of former Bureaux assets.


Now back to the Sword Worlds.  Hans Rancke <rancke@diku.dk> writes:

> Encountering their TL 12 fleet en route. Now what?

Well, first, remember in my scenario, Sacnoth hasn\'t been selling any TL 12
goods to Gram, and since they probably can\'t get any from the Darrians
or the Imperium (the Zhodani, maybe, I admit, but Sacnoth has similar access)
so the Sacnoth Fleet only encouters a TL 11 Gram Fleet.  (I believe this was
the case in the 5FW.  Forces from different worlds - Gram and Joyeuse -
reflected the TL of the specific world.  Anyone have easy access to those
*Fifth Frontier War* counters who can check for sure?)

Before I go further, let me say that I\'ve taken to heart Hans\'s (and Phil\'s)
comments that I should focus on the `facts at hand\'.  I\'m really trying to
come to an understanding of the situation based upon the facts rather than
my own view of `how it ought to be\'.  I just see many inconsistencies in
what few facts we have at hand.

> (Or _not_ encountering 
> it, which would be a lot more worrying ;-).

Well, yes, but this is the nature of interstellar warfare in the Traveller
universe.  :-)

> And the next thing you know Sacnoth is being visited by the combined fleets

Well, maybe, except that if Sacnoth does it\'s `front work\' some of the
other Sword Worlds will be allied or at least tolerant of it\'s actions.  If
it hits the `leader\' of the opposition first the remaining worlds will be
less likely to jump up for their own `chance in the barrel\'.

> Perhaps this gave
> them an Us-and-Them mentality that prevails to this day.

Are those refugees *Piper\'s* `original Sword Worlders\' or GDW\'s?  :-)
I believe the original GDW Sword Worlders were merely fleeing the
Interstellar Wars rather than their own specific defeat.

This might be true, but I don\'t think Sacnoth (or whoever) will need to
`cripple\' the other worlds in order to dominate the Confederation.

> Which may be why Sachnoth is due for their own downturn on the cycle in the
> not too distant future.

I admit, if these `cycles\' exist it explains a lot, but I just don\'t see
what causes them, nor understand why the same thing hasn\'t happened in the
Imperium or the Darrian Confederation.

> Think about this for a moment. Sacnoth is not the US in that analogy, they 
> are another one of the Latin nations.

Okay, but I don\'t believe this situation is analogous in terms of the TL
disparities (I\'ll get to that in a bit).  In a `Latin\' scenario with no US
I see several different blocs centered about the `stronger\' nations like
Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia (which will see much more stability
when the US drug market disappears).  This is quite similar to Sword
Worlds history.  If one world rises to dominance (possibly with Zhodani
aid) I suspect it will stay there.  In a feudal technocracy, it ought to
be the highest tech world.

BTW, if Gram does maintain its position with Zhodani aid *and* the Sword
Worlders have this `us vs. them\' mentality it seems much more likely to
me that a combined fleet is going to show up at Gram, especially in light
of the anti-Zhodani sentiment in the Confederation.

> How significant is an advantage of 12 over 11 and 10?
> a TL 12 fleet is twice as efficient, ton for ton, as a TL 11 and
> six times as efficient as TL 10.

Another measure would be the TL mods used in *5FW*.  I don\'t remember the
details (and my copy is 250 mi. away in Fort Worth) but I seem to
remember just a few battalions of TL 15 Imperial troops being able to
hold off several TL 10-11 corps of Sword Worlders.  Let\'s use the
figures you\'ve quoted until someone else digs up their copy of *5FW*.

> What is the population of Sacnoth compared to the rest of the

Okay, let\'s look at the info I posted a while back:

Sword Worlds Subsector Data c1120 (from *MTJ* #3)
Tizon (+6)      0922 B386887-A M   Ri                   323 Sw  K2VI M3D
Narsil (+6)     0927 B574A55-A M   Hi In                224 Sw  M0II M6D
Anduril (+7)    1026 B985855-B M   Ri                   222 Sw  F2V
Gram (+8)       1223 A895957-B M   Hi In Cp             603 Sw  F2D M2D
Sacnoth (+7)    1325 B775956-C M   Hi In                301 Sw* F9V M8D
Sting (+5)      1525 B645896-A M                        302 Sw* M0V

These are all the pop 8+ Sword Worlds.  Gram, at twice the population
of Sacnoth, ought to be able to fight the higher tech Sacnoth to a standstill.
Anduril, at one-tenth the population of Sacnoth, could choose the `winner\'
in such a conflict.  Narsil, at a ten-to-one advantage over Sacnoth, suffers
a twelve-to-one technological disadvantage.  Seems a Sacnoth-Anduril alliance
should be able to topple those `Zho-puppets\' on Gram.  Since Gram is the
capital that suggests a Gram-Anduril alliance (or Zhodani aid).

Where?  I doubt the Imperium or the Darrians would sell to the Sword Worlds.
The Zhodani, maybe, but what advantage do *they* have in fostering instability
in the Confederation?  A stable Sword Worlds on the border of the Imperium
would have been in the interest of the Zhodani!

I\'m wasn\'t thinking sabotage - I was thinking war-time embargo.  Tough to
wage a military campaign if you\'re buying your ammo-vehicles-medkits-
transport ships-*et al* from your adversary.

> But perhaps he buys them from the

I doubt it.  At the risk of beating a dead horse, if allied Mexican-
Brazilian-Argentine troops had recently occupied San Diego and San Antonio
you can bet there would be *a lot* of support in the US for much more than
just `fostering instability\' in Latin America.  (It\'s often fashionable to
make light of US resolve as being `typical\' of great powers like the
Imperium but keep in mind the last time any `foreign\' troops were in the
US proper they were from Virginia, Georgia and Maryland!)  It\'s clear
that any supposed efforts by the Imperium to merely foster instability
in the Sword Worlds have been unsuccessful - it hasn\'t prevented them
from attacking every time the Zhos get a wild hair.

> I don\'t see how that follows at all. The only times the Sword Worlds

I\'m not sure I understand your point.  Regardless of why the Sword Worlds
have attacked the Imperium there are clearly reasons why the Imperium
hasn\'t `dealt\' with the Sword Worlds long ago.  I doubt the Zhodani would
have gone to war over an Imperial invasion of the Sword Worlds so there
must be some reason the Sword Worlds themselves were able to deter such
action.

I can\'t reconcile this `fact\' with the proposed `cycles\'.  (And yet, I
can\'t reconcile Gram\'s leadership either.  I\'m still generally confused
and dissatisfied.)

Again, this seems contradictory to me.  Any Imperial meddling in the Sword
Worlds has caused the *opposite* result - Sword Worlds incursions - so
why hasn\'t the Imperium sent ". . . the [Imperial] Marines to that little
[subsector spinward of Glisten] and *stopped* that problem!"?

> >The Zhodani may be a factor
> 
> I\'ve no doubt they are a major factor.

Okay, this seems the only reasonable solution.  The Zhodani are supporting
Gram in its leadership of the Confederation.  Through this support, and
*despite* the generally anti-Zhodani sentiments in the Sword Worlds, Gram
is able to maintain its leadership in spite of the greater technological
accomlishments of Sacnoth.  In addition to it\'s support of Gram, the
Consulate has made it clear to the Imperium that it will not tolerate
direct action against the Confederation.

In a sense, the Sword Worlds have been nothing more than a Zhodani client
state.  (Ouch!  That\'s tough to admit.)  To continue to tromp on my Latin
American analogy, it\'s as if the Soviets had supported a Cuban-Mexican-
Brazilian-Argentine-*et al* confederation that overran Florida, Texas,
and California every few decades (and Lanth and Glisten are more like
Yuma, Del Rio, and Key West).  It\'s shaky, but I can understand it.
Maybe the `anti-Zhodani sentiment\' in the Sword Worlds was just Imperial
propaganda?  (More likely, it was another poorly-considered `rationali-
zation\' by the original developers used to explain why psionics weren\'t
rampant in the non-Imperial Sword Worlds.)

Given this, one would expect some major changes in this relationship now
that the Virus has severed Deneb\'s connection with the Imperium and there
has been some *rapproachement* with the Zhodani.  The Zhodani no longer
get as much value from supporting Gram.  Scanoth rises triumphant!?!  :-)

So, what do you think?  Have I done it?  :-)

Well, I guess I still haven\'t explained my view of what a feudal technocracy
is.  The Sword Worlds leaders may be called `kings\' but they\'re more like
`CEOs\' - they are at the top of a huge, conglomerate, capitalist, economic
power structure.  They don\'t have an `empire\' just like the `barons\' of
the Japanese `keiritsu\' don\'t.  They have a cooperative arrangement - a
Confederation.

I think this has been some good work.  It\'s certainly helped me to understand
the Sword Worlds better.  I just hope Phil Pugliese:

Okay, I\'ve got some sort of `jump space gravity well detector\' - maybe
it\'s a `Johnsonometer\'?  :-)  It doesn\'t matter that those `gravity waves\'
from that star in the next system are 3.26 years old because the relative
motion between here and there in the past 3.26 years isn\'t significant.
(Didn\'t the *World Builders\' Handbook* say I could `scan\' systems at
interstellar distances?)  This also makes Navigation skill useful (since
even my Model 1/bis can just input coordinates into the nav\'puter).

Actually, no.  I want to get close (that\'s the whole idea, right) but I
can\'t get *too* close or my jump drive goes wacko.

If this is how it works, how do I explore new territory?  Just jump out
there and hope there\'s a system?  I supposed I can take astronomical
measurements for coordinates, but isn\'t that just `photonic\' targeting?

Remember when I suggested a new Regency-specific mailing list?
Well, I\'m sure glad it DIDN\'T come about.

As for seperate areas for TNE and pre-TNE Traveller, well...

The Pros:
- ----
You might placate some of the people who ditched due to TNE, and some of 
them might come back to participate.

The Cons:
- ----
More administrative work for James -- keeping two lists, etc.
Possible reduction of the critical mass that has been achieved on TML.
Creates a little more hassle for those who like partaking in discussions
and swapping in all eras.
You can already discuss anything relating to Traveller on the TML, from any
era -- to diminish its subject matter for the aesthetic concerns of a 
handful seems ludicrous.

The participation level of those who ditched wasn\'t that high anyways.
If TML is not regulated/restricted from CT/MT posts, TML\'ers will go
right on posting such, to the loss of those who subscribe to the subject-
limited list exclusively.

- ----

Seems like a rather lopsided issue to me.

I prefer the general Traveller theme.  It\'s much simpler -- you read the
messages you want to read.  You keep the messages you want to keep.

Plus, I love bigger crowds -- 500 is a pretty big crowd!

Okay, okay, so I\'m a little *too* eager.  I\'ve two questions though.
Where do non-CT/MT, non-TNE Traveller discussion (like the Earth Colonies)
end up? And secondly, when do we get a Pre-MT/Rebellion mailing list?  :-)


Mike Basinger <dbasinge@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu> suggests:

This might be a good idea.  James, how difficult would it be to develop
a mechanism that would `reject\' messages that didn\'t conform to this format
like you already have for messages with 80+ characters per line?

To illuminate why merchants would find deep space jumping dangerous,
consider this.  When you jump into a deep-space hex, you have no 
"landmarks" to orient by -- normally, in a stellar system, you have a 
nearby star and some planets to fix your location, but for a deep space
station, you are dependent on an accurate jump and the station\'s 
radio beacon/radar reflector.  On _Brilliant Lances_ scale, a ship
jumping 100 diameters from a size-8 world is a bit over 40 hexes away
from target.  Finding a lone station at even that close a range could 
be tricky.  And if the station isn\'t where you think it is or your 
calculations are substantially off, you and your ship may be waiting a
long time to be found.

My guess as to why the IN and ZN don\'t seem to use deep space refueling
much is two-fold.  First, it may be tricky to maintain fuel levels in
the cache without tying up too many fleet tankers, especially if it
is in a forward area.  Cynthia, what\'s your experience with this?  It
may also be that we just don\'t hear much about them -- our usual source
of info is the TNS, and such bases would usually be secret installations.

I think that such stations have been used -- my interpretation of the
4FW "Battle of Two Suns" which was "midway between Yres and Menorb"
as depicted in the CT adventure _The Kinunir_ sounds a lot like a 
fight over a fueling and resupply base in deep space.  It would explain
why the fates of Efate, Yres, and Menorb hung in the balance over the
outcome, and why afterward the Zhodani supply lines were too long.
It would also explain why the battlefield may still have ships from which
parts could be salvaged.

The following library data first appeared in *Melbourne Times* #1:

CREATE: An acronym for Cultural Revelation, Appreciation, Tolerance and
Education, CREATE is a Nyanzan quasi-governmental organization responsible for
development and promotion of artistic and cultural interchanges among
Federation worlds as well as between the Federation and other Colonial States. 
Largely through the efforts of CREATE, Nyanzan artistic and cultural endeavors
are not only recognized but widely applauded throughout the Colonies Sphere. 
Artists from across the Sphere are drawn to the many educational institutions
operated by CREATE on Federation worlds.

Gaez Gavvi Eudrael (GGE): Roughly translated as "External Security
Directorate", the GGE is the primary Meren intelligence agency in the Colonies
Sphere.  Focused mainly on countering Aeroi efforts during the Markets War, its
operations have been scaled back with the end of that conflict.  Still, the GGE
is believed to have recruited Dolphin and Human agents from most Colonial
States in recent years.

House Moreira: A major Ouroran mercantile entity, Moreira provides passenger
and freight transport among Community worlds and operates interface routes as
well.  It is a Community leader in the manufacture and export of starships,
computers and robotics, and a variety of vehicles and crafts.  Moreira is also
the largest operator of starports in the community.
Lucent Templars: An elite military order of the Abrahamic Synod whose members
are found in all of the Synod\'s military services.  Appointment to the order is
made personally by the Supreme Aspirant and entails extensive, and highly
secret, religious and military training.  Claims that this includes training in
psionic disciplines have been vehemently denied by the order and have never
been substantiated by reliable sources.

Markets War: Period of confrontation (c2955-3000) between Aeroi and Meren
interests over access to markets in the Colonies Sphere.  While the two
entities never actually met in all-out war, each was involved in various
activities, including market monopolization, military support of local
governments and indigenous guerrilla movements, commercial and political
espionage, financial leveraging and arbitrage, and industrial and mercantile
sabotage, that resulted in often intense tension in the region.  Ended with the
political collapse of the Meren Expansionist Clique and the mysterious withdraw
of many Meren elements to their own sphere.

Prometheus Foundation: An independent research and development house that has
been instrumental in the dissemination of technology throughout the Colonies
Sphere.  Prometheus agents and researches are encountered throughout the Sphere
wherever technology is being developed.  Many states are critical of the
Foundation\'s insistence on sharing its technological innovations but none have
been willing to forego the advantages of cooperation with the Foundation.  The
Prometheus Foundation\'s origins trace back to a late 20th Century arms
manufacturer that translated military technology into commercial technology for
developing nations.  Among its more famous accomplishments has been the
subsector organization used by most States in the Sphere that was developed to
foster cooperation across borders.  The Prometheus Foundation also provides
minimum Class E starport facilities throughout the Sphere where such facilities
are beyond the capability of individual worlds.

Transtellar Lines: One of the major Commonwealth interstellar carriers,
Transtellar liners and freighters are common throughout Commonwealth space and
beyond.  Transtellar operates interface routes to all major Colonial States. 
Transtellar\'s origins trace back to a corporate charter granted during the
period of early sub-light re-colonization just prior to the development of jump
drive.

Universidad de Aztlan: The major university of the Empire of Aztlan is one of
the most respected educational institutions in the Colonies Sphere in the
fields of engineering and technology.  In addition to training cadets for the
Empire\'s military services the Universidad de Aztlan also graduates the
majority of the Empire\'s shipwrights and other starship industry technicians. 
Unlike other Aztlan universities, the UdeA does not accept students from
outside the Empire.

Ysinal udi-Quinan: The major Aeroi mercantile house in Auriga subsector is also
the largest organization of its type in the entire Colonies Sphere.  From its
headquarters on hvi-Unapfi, Ysinal udi-Quinan manages Aeroi investment and
trade development activities throughout the Sphere.  Even though a
quasi-governmental agency, Ysinal udi-Quinan includes several non-Aeroi
corporations among its holdings.

It seems I haven\'t explained my idea about the economic cycles well enough.
Basically I postulate a series of recessions and booms. Since I postulate
that the Sword Worlds have access to TL 15 physics texts from the Imperium,
I also assume that a lower-than-15 TL is the result of economic conditions:
A TL 12 world can\'t support the industry needed to build the TL 13 stuff
needed to maintain the TL 14 industry needed to build the TL 14 stuff
needed to maintain TL 15 industry. Got that? So a recession could (depending
on its severity) drop the TL of a world while a boom could raise it. Thus
I assume that Gram had TL 12 a few decades ago, which is when they built a
lot of their current fleet. (Remember, I also assume that a world can 
maintain ships and equipment at least two levels above their own TL). So
they have the ships and they can, if necessary, maintain it on their own. 
Furthermore, my thesis is that if Sacnoth wasn\'t selling TL 12 stuff at
competetive prices them Gram would build it on its own  -  the reason why
they aren\'t doing it now being that Sacnoth is selling it cheaper than they
could build it themselves. You see? It all hangs together. The situation
you postulate  -  that Sacnoth has a TL 12 fleet and Gram hasn\'t  -  is not
possibe under my assumptions.

>(I believe this was

I hadn\'t thought about that. Yes, I think you\'re right. I\'ll check. That
would certainly knock my theory over the head. Except that I just might
claim that FFW had made a mistake ;-) Ah, how difficult it is to abandon
a well-loved theory...

>Before I go further, let me say that I\'ve taken to heart Hans\'s (and Phil\'s)

And if the Gram ships in FFW really are TL 11 (which I think they are) then
that comment is going to return and hit me in the face like a boomerang! ;-)

>I\'m really trying to
>come to an understanding of the situation based upon the facts rather than

Well, I\'ll continue my argument as if FFW didn\'t exist. For the moment,
anyway. Until I get a chance to think about it a bit.

Now you\'re postulating historical facts to support your view. This is no
more (and no less) valid than me postulating that Gram is the one that has
done its political homework and has the backing of the other Sword Worlds.
Either is equally possible in theory. But one of them has things turn out
the way GDW says they did and the other one dosen\'t. IMO one should prefer
the one that corresponds most closely to GDWs version.

Now, if you could demonstrate that Sacnoth couldn\'t possibly loose a
confrontation with all the other Sword Worlds then you\'d have something
much more solid.

Actually, while I\'ve no doubt that GDW\'s Sword Worlds owe their origin to
Piper, they actualy have a lot less in common with Piper\'s than one might
think.

I believe, however, that the GDW SW ancestors did, like Piper\'s SW ancestors,
flee a lost civil war.

Remember that my theory ties TLs tightly to the economy. I know it hasn\'t
worked that way on Earth today, but it\'s the only explanation that I can
see why nearly all worlds aren\'t TL 15. So relegate the TLs to the back-
ground for a moment and think about the world economies today. We\'ve got
economic boom/recession cycles. Why shouldn\'t the Sword Worlds? As to why
it dosen\'t happen in the Imperium and the Darrian Confederation:

	1) Maybe it does. Why is only 4 Imperial worlds in the Spinward
	   Marches TL 15?

	2) Maybe they have a better control of the economy than the 
	   Sword Worlds. The Imperium, at least, has enough size to
	   dampen local problems.

So far no problem. This is just what the Sword world history says happened.

So this seems to be the assumption that dosen\'t fit. Examine it. Change it
to fit. Specifically the part of the assumption that has the individual
Sword Worlds tied together in an \'emperor-level\' feudal technocracy. Try
to imagine the tecnocracies stopping at the planetary level.

How deep is that anti-Zhodani sentiment? You assume they think of Zhodani
as a 50ties redneck thought of russians. Perhaps it\'s a 20th Century
Yankee/Southerner dislike.

Well, Steve\'s figures was about ships and not troops, but even so, there\'s
a ot of difference between a 12-11 disparity and a 15-10. In fact, Steve
claims that a TL 15 fleet has a 500-1 advantage over a TL 11 fleet and can
defeat any number of foes of lower TLs.

If, that is, wars were decided by mathematical formulae. Let\'s not get that
simplistic. Lots of instances in history where the apparently certain loser
didn\'t. I would have been satisfied if Gram wasn\'t too far behind. That
they are equal given a TL 11 fleet and clearly superior given a TL 12 fleet
just helps.

Gram certainly needs allies given that the Zhodani help is covert enough to
be just a rumour. Perhaps Gram buys Zhodani ships at a discount. No feudal
technocrat could be very upset at a peer taking advantage of a good deal,
surely?

Perhaps the anti-Zhodani sentiment was strong on Sacnoth but weak on Gram
300 years ago. Nowadays they _do_ have a politically stable Confederation.
Gram has been in charge for three centuries.

How long does it take to go on a war-time production scedule? Always
remember that Gram knows perfectly well how to make these things. They
just can\'t make them as cheaply. That\'s the central point of my theory:
THE MOMENT SACNOTH STOPS SELLING TL 12 STUFF SOME OTHER SWORD WORLD

What time in history are you talking about? Just after the 3rd FW where
the Imperium occupied 12 of the Sword Worlds? Or after the 5th where they
set up a puppet government of half the Confederation? The Imperium _did_
a lot more just after these incursions. They just didn\'t keep it up for
centuries  -  which I consider perfectly politically plausible. After
the heat dies down a later government relaxes the more stringent measures.

But they did. The occupied half of them after the 3rd FW. Later they decided
that keeping up the occupation wasn\'t worth the bother. The 4th FW was
settled by negotiation, not Imperial conquest, so they didn\'t get a chance
there. After the 5th FW they cut them in half and tried with a puppet
government.

Remember, on paper the Zodani _ought_ to have been able to kick the Imperial
ass. Nowadays we know that the reason why they didn\'t commit enough forces
to do this was that they didn\'t want to take over Deneb. They\'ve been 
static for 2 millenia (I have a private theory that they have some massive
internal troubles, but that\'s by the way). In essense, the Zhodani have
been playing a very cynical game with their Vargr and Sword World allies,
using them as cannon fodder. They never intended to win those wars (this,
much more than their thought police/doctors makes the Zhodani bastards
in my books). But neither the Imperium nor the Sword Worlds knew that. The
Imperium were frightened enough of the Zhodani potential to refrain from
taking drastic advantage of any of their victories; the Sword Worlds were
impressed enough to get suckered into yet another Outworld Coalition.

The Sword World incursions were a result of the Zhodani alliance, and had
nothing to do with their strength relative to the Imperium.

They have. They just took them home again after a while.

How general are those sentiments? Or rather, how violent? Is it a general
\'kill-the-zhos\' hate (your choice?), a somewhat widespread \'all psionics/
zhos needs bashing\' resentment (my own choice), or an occasional \'zhos 
stink\' dislike?

Not technological accomplishment (What\'s the accomplishment in buying an
Imperial physics textbook?). Temporary economic advantage.

Quite possible.

Make that overran every two centuries and you\'re nearer the mark. This is
actually quite important. If the Sword Worlds really bothered the Imperium
every other decade then I agree with you that the Imperium would do
something about them. But they don\'t. And, disregarding the 4th FW, the
Imperium has taken quite decisive action whenever the Sword Worlds have 
ovestepped the line.

Very propably. Or perhaps it\'s a "Real Men don\'t need psionics!" thing.

OK. So you think the Confederation is one huge Feudal Technocracy, right?
I think it is a confederation of (mostly) feudal technocracies. On what
do you base your assumption that it must be the one and can\'t be the other?
(Note that my argument is that if both are possible then we should choose
the assumption that fits the facts best. Only if one is inevetable or the
other impossible should we choose in despite of the known facts). I won\'t
dispute that if you have a lot of feudal technocracies on the planetary 
then a further feudal level is a distinct possibility. All I\'m saying is
that it\'s not inevetable, that a planetary king could just as well think
of himself as a real king and treat the other kings as such.

When I first scoured Megatraveller, I thought I saw something to the effect
that, as you postulate, economics and infrastructure are what limit TLs.
TL10 traders sell TL10 computers to a TL8 world. Even if they have the
manuals and maintenace books, all the buyers are going to have to rely on
TL10 servicing, which would require TL10 computter training, probably from
imported engineers or natives who study abroad, etc. Essentially, they
can\'t just read the books - they need to be at least capable of
manufacturing the tech themselves and support it as well.

I would postulate that trade with more advanced planets may let you reach
higher TLs more quickly, but not immediately.

As for Earth, I think the differences between the Core and the Spinward
Marches (Regency) would be more akin to the difference between New York and
San Francisco & surrounding regions, circa 1890. S.F. was a pretty advanced
city for its time, but it in no way rivaled New York. It was still a
frontier, where they were still building the infrastructure that New York
alrady had.

You can\'t run before you can walk. Even if someone shows you how and holds
your hand, you still have to get there on your own.

Right, except that \'some\' and \'some\' should read \'a lot\' and \'a lot\'.

Since James suggested this to us in the first place, that\'s probably
not an issue for him, or (if it is), he believes the ROI is worth it.

Unlikely, since those that enjoy TNE will either remain with the original
group, or join both groups and post as is appropriate.

Join both groups.  If the hassle is too much, maybe your enthusiasm isn\'t
enough.

True, but many of us feel that mixing TNE with earlier traveller is like
mixing _Ren_&_Stimpy_ with _Masterpiece_Theatre_.  In our eyes, the two are
mutually exclusive.

Careful when you use the word handful.  I\'m not sure how long you\'ve been
with the TML, but I\'m going on 6 (or so) years, and the number of voices
I\'ve seen disappear due to TNE is appalling.  I\'d hardly call it a \'handful\'.
Also, how many of the current subscribers are active contributors?  Maybe
there\'s a reason.

> The participation level of those who ditched wasn\'t that high anyways.

BZZZZZT!!  Nice try.  Thanks for playing.

Ask James about the old TML metrics.  At one point (several years ago),
I was one of the 3 highest-volumn posters (# of lines and frequency) on
the entire TML.  Metlay (God bless him), was also in that group, and he
fall dropped the TML altogether, rather than have to endure TNE.  Nick
Sylvain was also a high volumn contributor, and the only thing I\'ve seen
from him recently was his announcement of impending departure, also because
of TNE.

That\'s not really the point.  We (the anti-TNE folks) want to not have to
wade through the low signal-to-noise ratio that TNE presents in the TML.
It a separate group, it ceases to be a problem for us, and those of you
that enjoy TNE (and creamed spinich and enemas and so on...) can stay
right here and do exactly what you\'ve been doing all along.

> Seems like a rather lopsided issue to me.

Seems like a pretty selfish one to me.  You\'d rather keep us around, even
when we don\'t want to be here, rather than lose part of your audience?
This may cause many folks that dropped out to come back.  The flip side
is many are leaving anyway, they just don\'t have anywhere else to go.
The separate mailing list would resolve that.

 ... and plow through a ton of TNE garbage to get to them.  No thanks.

If crowds is your scene, try commuting in Manhatten.

Subject: Misc. Questions

All I need is the air that I breathe...
- ----

One of the hazards of space travel is going to be running out of breathable 
    air. When considering a particular \'scene\' for a scenario I was 
    planning, I realised I had no good idea of how long it takes a person 
    to use up the available air in a sealed room. So, some questions for 
    the list.

Imagine you are in a sealed room. How long does it take a person to die 
    because the air gets bad - and why? Is it lack of Oxygen, or the 
    presence of impurities?

If the room is filled not with air, but with Oxygen only:
- -   what atmospheric pressure should it be at to be safe? I believe that if 
    the pressure is too high the atmosphere promotes any sort of minor 
    spark into a serious fire/explosive hazard.

- -   how long before a typical human unfortunate dies from bad air in this 
    scenario.

Some questions on firearms...
- ----

 ..   At what tech level can you build guns out of non metallic materials?

 ..   What sort of non metallic materials are possible - plastics, carbon 
    fibre, or what? 

 ..   At what tech level can you build caseless ammo and weapons to use it? 
    And when does the result become as practical as weapons using cased 
    ammo?

Note:
    I\'m interested in both real world comments as well as comments based on 
    whatever is covered in (CT/MT/TNE) Traveller rules.

Design Notes

My first stab at designing using FF&S. A very user friendly product, and soon
got results. If you spot any bad errors let me know.

The major difficulty with this design was keeping the weight down! With such a
high muzzle energy the receiver came in at a hefty 1.2 kg. I fiddled with the
muzzle energy to get it out at under 2001 to preserve the 1-Nil penetration.

Why do weapons with muzzle energy of 2001 to 3000 drop penetration back to
2-Nil????????

The ECT weapon system had battery weight costs for the magazine, but took away
the recoil due to it\'s firing mechanism.

I found the barrel length and casing length vital to the design, as this
determined the muzzle energy, and thus the receiver characteristics. I rifled
the barrel. Is this ok on a pistol? (I am afraid I don\'t know anything about
real guns).

The weapon is a heavy sidearm, known as a \'Pulse Pistol\' as ECT weapons use an
intense pulse of electrical energy to ignite the working fluid in the round to
a plasma state. ACRs in my campaign are called Pulse Rifles. . .

Having put together my design I looked back at the Gauss pistol in the upgrade
booklet to see how it compared. I just couldn\'t believe how poor the stats
were. TL 13 weapon with a SS recoil of 5? It can fire bursts, but with a recoil
of 11? A short range of 11 meters?

I applied a quick assumption that the pistol had a Muzzle Velocity of 1500
(FF&S p.102). Without designing the whole system, and using the knowns found in
the upgrade booklet, I reckon the stats for the weapon should look more like
below:

TL 13 Gauss Pistol
                                                 Recoil

4mm Gauss Pistol - Dart  5   2   Nil    1   35   2   6   19
4mm Gauss Pistol - HEAP  5   3   2-2-2  1   35   2   6   14
4mm Gauss Pistol - tranq 5   -1  Nil    1   35   2   5   11

I struggle to get the stats found in the upgrade booklet. Any thoughts anyone?

I am now into session 2 of refereeing DGP\'s \'Flaming Eye\' campaign, using the
wholly superior TNE rule set. I believe the Imperium to be a superior
background, and TNE to be a better set of rules. Right now I have the best of
both worlds.

I\'ll keep this short, but here is my .02Cr on splitting the list.  I enjoyed
CT and never really liked MT.  I can deal with TNE.  Except for the change in
the Maneuver Drives I like the new vehicle design better.
 
I don\'t want to see the mailing list split.  But seeing how some people pay
for their mail by the byte I can understand not wanting to recieve mail you
don\'t want.  It is throwing money away to them.  For me mail is part of my
basic service at a local BBS. For $0.25 an hour I can afford extra mail.  So
rather than lose the CT posters, I must say split the list.  I can afford to
subscribe to another mailing list and I will as I\'m interested in Traveller in
ALL forms.
 
The tagging of messages by prefixing them with a CT, MT, or TNE was a great
idea.  And would work if this was a newsgroup and I could use a off line
reader.  With the mailing list though, you still run into the price per byte
for some people.
 
Again, these are my views, but I believe they make sense.
 
One last comment on something someone else mentioned.  TSR supports multiple
setting for AD&D.  You\'re right. Why didn\'t GDW do the same?  And rather than
the virus, cleaning up after the Rebellion would have taken a few hundred
years anyway.

Okay, you may remember when James initially posted the suggestion of
creating another mailing list for the anti-TNE crowd that I jumped at
the idea.  Since then I\'ve had some second thoughts.

I\'m going to get to Mark Cook\'s arguments for the separate list in a moment.
(Nothing personal Mark, you\'re just a handy proponent.)  First though, I\'d
like to explain my own situation.  I\'m pretty new to TML - only having 
subscribed in January of this year.  I think since then though, I\'ve been
a pretty active contributor - for good or ill!  :-)  I started the CT/MT
vs. TNE background discussion a while back and I think most of you ought
to know that I have little use for TNE.  I don\'t give a hoot about rules
(I never even used the CT/MT rules for much of anything except character
and world generation) and I feel the TNE background offers *nothing* over
what could have been done with a CT/MT `frontier sourcebook\'.  While I 
have just about *every* GDW and DGP product since those first `Three Little
Black Books\', I have not purchased *any* TNE products and I\'m seriously
considering letting my subscription to *Challenge*, which goes back to
*JTAS* #5, expire.

That said, Mark Cook <markc@CSOS.ORST.EDU> writes:

One might suggest the same about `oldtimers\' who find it too much hassle to
put up with the `noise\' of TNE postings.

I\'m not sure I buy this.  If all these folks were still contributing there
wouldn\'t be such a `low signal-to-noise\' ratio.

Hmmm.  There seems to be plenty `selfishness\' to go around here.  Look, 
I\'m just as pissed as anyone at what GDW has done to Traveller and I don\'t
appreciate these `newbies\' bitching about my `whining\' all the time either
but that doesn\'t mean I want to pick up my toys and go play by myself.

I doubt it, but I\'d like to offer a challenge to allow you to prove me wrong.
Let\'s have all these hordes of oldtimers `walk their walk\' instead of just
`talk their talk\'.  Let\'s see what this new mailing list would look like
right her in TML.  Beginning June 1st (which should give enough time to
get the word out and to let folks transitioning from school to get settled
for the summer) let\'s have `Pre-TNE Days on TML\' for all these oldtimers
who are just bursting with megabytes of pre-PIE-in-the-sky information to
contribute.

I would *love* the opportunity to participate in discussions about Imperial
background.  That\'s what I loved about HIWG (except I wasn\'t `on-line\'
with GENIE which kept me somewhat `ghettoized\').  I would *love* to develop
*other* campaign backgrounds like the Earth Colonies on TNE.  If folks were
really contributing like this I suspect all the TNE devotees would be
`dropping out\' or clamoring for their `own\' list.  (Sorry, newbies.)

But I don\'t think that will happen.  I suspect those folks who are dropping
out have a variety of other reasons besides merely the TNE `signal-to-
noise\' ratio - things like other priorities in their lives now, something
that happens to all of us.  But please, go ahead and prove me wrong beginning
June 1st.

I also think there is another problem with creating a new list.  Namely, if we
start with the anti-TNE crowd, where do we stop?  I (and many others I
suspect) was never very pleased with MegaTraveller and the Rebellion.  Do
we get a pre-MT/Rebellion list next?  How about a `background only\' list
so I don\'t have to be hassled by all those pesky, boring discussions about
laser comm frequencies and starship lavatory design?  What about an anti-
Grandfather list for those of us who disliked that whole fantasy trip?
And another list where the Sword Worlds don\'t have those d**ned economic
cycles of Hans\'s?  :-)

Now, please, Mark (and others), let\'s not have more argument about our
arguments about a new list.  Just take me up on my challenge and start
posting all that pre-TNE stuff to the TML.  You don\'t even have to wait
until June 1st - get that `signal-to-noise\' ratio up *now* because every bit
of bandwidth that\'s wasted arguing against me instead of being pre-TNE
posts just makes my case and argues against a separate list.

OK, let me propose why the Impies and Zhos don\'t use \'em: it\'s a 
*political* decision.

Suppose deep-space refueling stations are common.  Then, worlds which
are 6-12 parsecs in from the border become vulnerable to attack without
warning.  They would thus want some defensive elements stationed full-
time in their system.  This would probably at least quadruple the fleet
elements that would have to be deployed to provide "border coverage" for
all these "non-border" systems.

Can the Navy support all these requests?  I don\'t think this is likely.
You run the risk of being spread too thin.  So what is the enterprising
World Leader to do?  Build a big system fleet or lots of planetary
defense fortifications.

However, how are a planet\'s big system defense fleets and large planetary
defense batteries perceived by its Larger Political Entity (Imperium or Con-
sulate)?  I think they do not like them at all.  First I\'ll give some
Traveller facts and then I\'ll do some interpretation.

Fact 1: Planetary defense forts are not covered in Traveller literature.  The
closest thing is "planetary defense battalions" from the boardgame "Invasion:
Earth", which are not that effective.

Fact 2: System defense boats are the accepted mechanism for system defense.
But, the quantities for these seem very low.  I think a Traveller News
Service brief from the JTAS "War" issue read something like "the ten heavy
SDBs in the Regina system were sent to defend the system gas giant, which
would be the first priority of an attacking fleet."  This seems like a
very small number for a world at the edge of the Imperium.

Interpretation: The Larger Political Entity (Imperium or Consulate) does
not allow large system defense forces.  This would give too much power
to the individual worlds.  By taking responsibility for defense of the
whole LPE, the LPE Navy can be used for "showing the flag" and other semi-
coercive means of keeping the member worlds in line.  This will allow the
member worlds to exist together more peacefully, since they can\'t easily 
have internal military disputes.  (Also makes single-world rebellions
difficult.)

To summarize Cynthia, deep-space refueling implies the need to fortify
planetary bodies.  Given the need to enforce internal cohesion, however,
the Imperium and Consulate have decided to not allow large (autonomous)
planetary defenses.  Thus, they both did not use deep space refueling
stations during the Frontier Wars.

I would assume large planetary defenses (and fuel dumps) would be much
more prevalent in Trillion Credit Squadron games, which have much smaller
(probably single-system) political entities.

Comments are appreciated...

As far as I see, the only issue is if enough people are
interested in an "old traveller" mailing list, especially
those that have already left because of TNE.  People who
want it all can just subscribe to both.

The only inconvenience this should cause is if a great
deal of cross-posting occurs, although given that the
past high-volume contributors have largely been quiet or
left the list, this seems unlikely.

Other than discussing valid impediments to splitting the
list, let\'s not argue about it or take sides.

Officially, we don\'t know a blessed thing except the vague allusions in
_Survival Margin_.  Much like the whole "Who are these IRIS people?"
business from Strephon.  A quick unofficial guess-work analysis:

Longbow appears to be some sort of psionic-based interstellar communications
project, possibly in the research phase since prior to the First Civil War
and First Interstellar War, which appearently has come to fruition by the
early 1100s, at least enough to cause Strephon to consider repeal of the
Psionics Suppression Acts of the early 800s.  

Someone or something named Pentecost is connected to the project.  Pentecost
was the day upon which the disciples of Jesus were "filled with the Holy
Spirit and began to speak in other tongues", and is a Jewish feast day 
celebrating the first fruits of the harvest.

Longbow was apparently being used to warn the Imperial government of some
sort of mysterious threat approaching the Imperium at superluminal speeds
and which would apparently reach the outer borders in about 1202.

Make of the tidbits what you will.  Apparently Pentecost went missing
during the Rebellion.  Strephon apparently witnessed a test from the
Depot at Lishun to Capital, but we don\'t know much since he was busy
waxing obscure...er, poetic.  This is one of those "increasing the aura
of mystery" things that GDW is so hot on these days.  (No implied value
judgment intended.)

  While I agree with this statement, I can\'t see that creating a
seperate group for CT/MT folks will reverse the "loss to the game"
except among the TML lists.

  Similarly, the "base-line" TML will not be a CT/MT-free zone.  I
refuse to cater to isolationists\' desires for a monopoly of information.
My Traveller posts will go to _whoever_ is interested, on either list.
  Also, given the nature of netters and gamers, the list split will
not end the superiority argument/gripe.  I refuse to point fingers at
current TMLers, but the publicity that the split will demand will
inevitably attract new members to both lists whose interest is in
"The Difference". I have yet to see a group of netters who can
completely resist that kind of salt in an old wound.  Expect flare-ups.

 >Depending on initial response, application of TNE rules to the
 >Classic and Rebellion settings may be tolerated.

  As most of the CT/MT folks are primarily hot about the setting (or,
in their words, the lack of one), I certainly _hope_ that rules
cross-overs will be "tolerated".  Why?
  One of this list\'s strong points used to be its vehicle posts and
discussions.  Unfortunately, the primary vehicle designers are all
among the Anti-TNE group, and most have not bothered to even _glance_
at the TNE vehicle design rules (I\'m sure someone will respond and
give us a list of reasons for this, so I won\'t anticipate them).
  I have used every edition of the rules.  I started my Traveller
years with the purchase of the brand new JTAS #4. I consider the
current ship-building and ship-to-ship combat rules to be better
meshed and more usable than ANY previous edition. ANY. What\'s more,
these rules are such that they can be used with any previous edition
of the roleplaying rules with much less translation work than might
be expected. Part of the work has already been done
(see TML message 534/6615 for "Three-Pack Turrets").  I\'m sure
that the rest will be discussed in detail. You have only ask, and
the TML will produce _someone_ with an answer.

Dug out my *Rebellion Sourcebook* and pulled out the following information
to start some development of the Regency Navy for our TML Regency sourcebook
*Shall Not Perish*.

First off, the *RS* states that a typical Imperial sector fleet consists
of about 1000 combat ships (battles, cruisers, carriers and escorts as
opposed to tankers, scouts and auxilliarires) which averages out to 62.5
ships per subsector.  Each subsector has a `numbered\' regular fleet and
a `reserve\' colonial fleet.  A numbered fleet has 2-10 squadrons and from
50-200 ships.  This suggests that the `1000 ships\' number must only refer
to numbered fleets since an average of 62.5 ship per subsector would mean
only 31 ships each for the numbered and reserve fleets.  This is consistent
with other comments that the sector fleet is composed of the numbered 
subsector fleets but conflicts with statements that include the reserve 
fleet as part of the sector fleet.  Nevertheless, I\'ll deal with only
the numbered fleet ships here.

So here\'s a break down of the Regency Navy based upon the information in
the *RS* (all numbers are approximate):

Spinward Marches Fleet (11 fleets, 687 ships):
212th Fleet (Jewell)              213th Fleet (Regina)
214th Fleet (Aramis)              193rd Fleet (Vilis)
18th Fleet (Lanth)                23rd Fleet (Rhylanor)
43rd Fleet (Lunion)               73rd Fleet (Mora)
208th Fleet (Five Sisters)        100th Fleet (Glisten)
207th Fleet (Trin\'s Veil)

Deneb Fleet (16 fleets, 1000 ships):
194th Fleet (Pretoria)            212th Fleet (Lamas) [same # as Jewell?]
151st Fleet (Antra)               61st Fleet (Million)
195th Fleet (Sabine)              257th Fleet (Inar)
125th Fleet (Dunmag)              88th Fleet (Atsah)
196th Fleet (Star Lane)           258th Fleet (Vincennes)
154th Fleet (Usani)               183rd Fleet (Geniishir)*
193rd Fleet (Gulf)                260th Fleet (Zeng)
55th Fleet (Kamlar)*              184th Fleet (Vast Heavens)*
*probably reduced strength due to smaller patrol area

Trojan Reach Fleet (4 fleets, 250 ships):
201st Fleet (Pax Rulin)*          202nd Fleet (Gazulin)
203rd Fleet (Sindal)*             204th Fleet (Tobia)
*probably reduced strength due to smaller patrol area

Reft Fleet (3 fleets, 188 ships)
19th Fleet (Vestus)               74th Fleet (Macon)*
128th Fleet (Usher)*
*probably reduced strength due to smaller patrol area

Total Regency Navy (c1120): 34 fleets, 2125 ships

Several fleets have been `displaced\' as a result of the Viral and *ihatei*
assaults: 151st Fleet, 61st Fleet, 125th Fleet, 88th Fleet, 55th Fleet,
184th Fleet, 203rd Fleet and 204th Fleet.

These assets might have been transferred to the Quarantine Service.

There\'s lot\'s of development work to do here: squadron composition of each
of these 34 fleets, squadron and fleet commanders, deployment and force
compositions, etc.

Jump in and have a bite!

Thanks, Mark, for taking the pre-TNE position and expressing it more
eloquently than I have.

The level of contribution today is similar to what the old TML enjoyed,
but the contributor\'s names and the topics are quite different. The old
TMLers are now no longer listening, and pre-TNE era support, which these
people would love to do, founders due to lack of a forum in which to
discuss it.

The sheer volume of the postings is what turn off several many listeners
- -- even casual listeners frequently drop the TML because they cannot
drink from the fire hose.

The subject line (and enforcement) idea has given me an idea. Currently
TMLers can select three frequencies: nightly, twice-weekly, and archive
bundle. Maybe a better approach is for TML to join the information age
and allow subscribers to select digests automatically cutomized to their
interests, filtering the traffic for them, based on article subject
lines. These digests would allow each subscriber to adjust the traffic
level as well as topical interest.

Users could subscribe to any or all of the following subject interest
areas (notice that existing topical interest lists like CAT could easily
be grafted on as topical subject areas of TML):

	CAT		- Computer-Aided Traveller
	Classic		- Black Book/Traveller Book Ruleset
	MT		- MegaTraveller Ruleset
	TNE		- TNE Ruleset
	Imperium	- Third Imperium Era
	Rebellion	- Rebellion Era
	Regency?	- Regency Era
	Admin		- List Administrivia
	Announce	- New product, list, pbem announcements, etc.
	Miscellaneous	- Stuff that doesn\'t fit the above

What it would take from me is a serious dedication of time to develop
the filterers and list management. I\'d also need to add a robo-admin to
allow people to automatically maintain their list of topical items, and
develop instructions clear enough that even net-newbies can deal with
them.

Sounds like a lot of work, more than I may be willing to chew off.
Still, it\'s interesting. I\'ll let you know if there\'s any chance this is
doable.

In the mean time, it would probably be wise for me to set up the simple,
pre-TNE mailing list to stop the exodus today before the Third Imperium
dies in the hearts of its fans.

Thanks.  I appear, however, to have ruffled some feathers in the
TNE camp.  Sigh.

Well put, and dead on target, IMHO.

I\'d be willing to investigate mechanisms to help implement this
scheme (which I like a *lot*) when I get back from Central America,
if you\'re interested in any help.

Yes, please.  If introduced as a transitional tool (of indeterminate
duration), we can placate the anti-TNE camp (which I sit firmly in),
and then work on a more elegant solution (such as you propose above)
at our leisure.

Okay, we\'ve started with the Regency Navy, now let\'s take a look at the
Regency Army.  By `army\' I mean `mobile\' ground forces available for off-
world actions.

I\'m using the article "Troops in the Fifth Frontier War" from *JTAS* #10
as a reference for determining troop availability.  Thanks also to Steve
Bonneville for `grepping\' data on Deneb high-tech worlds in TML msg
592/7421 from May 4th.

At TL 16, only worlds with Pop 7+ will have mobile troops.  The only Regency
world that meets this criteria is Vincennes.  At Pop A, Vincennes can
support three (3) `army\'-sized (combat factor 5C) units (3 x 5C-16).

For convenience let\'s identify these units as follows:

1st Vincennes Army (TL 16)
2nd Vincennes Army (TL 16)
3rd Vincennes Army (TL 16)

TL 15 worlds also must have pop 7+ in order to support mobile troops. In
the Regency, Magash (pop 9), Starn (pop 9), Dekha (pop A), Rhylanor (pop 9),
Mora (pop A), Glisten (pop 9), Trin (pop A in the Rebellion era - but
destroyed by the Virus in TNE) and Lintl (pop A) meet this requirement.
Dekha, Mora and Lintl will support three armies like Vincennes:

1st Dekha Army (TL 15)
2nd Dekha Army (TL 15)
3rd Dekha Army (TL 15)
1st Mora Army (TL 15)
2nd Mora Army (TL 15)
3rd Mora Army (TL 15)
1st Lintl Army (TL 15)
2nd Lintl Army (TL 15)
3rd Lintl Army (TL 15)

The pop 9 worlds can support four (4) `corps\'-sized (combat factor 1C)
units (4 x 1C-15) as follows:

1st Magash Corps (TL 15)
2nd Magash Corps (TL 15)
3rd Magash Corps (TL 15)
4th Magash Corps (TL 15)
1st Starn Corps (TL 15)
2nd Starn Corps (TL 15)
3rd Starn Corps (TL 15)
4th Starn Corps (TL 15)
1st Rhylanor Corps (TL 15)
2nd Rhylanor Corps (TL 15)
3rd Rhylanor Corps (TL 15)
4th Rhylanor Corps (TL 15)
1st Glisten Corps (TL 15)
2nd Glisten Corps (TL 15)
3rd Glisten Corps (TL 15)
4th Glisten Corps (TL 15)

These 16 corps are equivalent to three `armies\' (with one corps remaining).
Regency troops at lower tech levels can be developed from the UWP values
using the *JTAS* #10 article.  I\'m not sure what the TL cutoff is but
regular `Imperial\' troops do not go below TL 13 or so.  Can someone with
*5FW* help us out here?

This basis should provide a similar starting point for development as did
the Regency Navy post: what are the deployment, organization, commanders,
etc. of these Regency Armies?

At the a high atmospheric pressure oxygen becomes toxic.  This is the reason
Scuba divers use compressed air instead of oxygen.  At normal pressure the
fire risk from an all oxygen atmosphere is very high.  

The breathable air in a room is converted to bad by a person consuming
oxygen which is replaced by carbon dioxide.  Eventually the lowering oxygen
levels will cause a person to die from oxygen starvation.  At which point
I don\'t know but the amount of oxygen used by a person depends upon their
activity rate.  By doing little the air in a room can be made to last longer.

Away to extend the time a person has in a sealed room is to have someway
to replace the oxygen.  If there was a bottle of compressed oxygen in the
room it could be opened occasionaly to increase the oxygen levels.  This
may have to be done carfeully if there is no gravity in the area.  If a valve
on a bottle of compressed gas is broken, the bottle can smash through brick
walls.

Expanding on the Regency Navy and Army posts, let\'s look at the Sword
Worlds in detail.  This exercise might serve as an example for expansion
of any Regency subsector military forces.

There are no clear rules (with the exception of possible *Trillion Credit
Squadron*, which I don\'t have) tying naval forces to any sort of UWP data.
Based upon the `1000 ships per sector\' mentioned in the *Rebellion 
Sourcebook* we get an `average\' of 62.5 ships per subsector.  Based upon the
world generation rules, in the Spinward Marches we get an average of 26.7
worlds per subsector with a total average subsector population of 46 billion.
This, combined with the average ship figure, works out to an average of
roughly 700,000,000 people per regular naval combat ship.  This is a very
rough number, and specifically does not account for tech level effects, but
I\'ll use it nevertheless.  I welcome any `less soft\' figures though.

This number suggests that only Pop 8+ worlds will be able to support regular
naval forces.  This doesn\'t quite `jive\' with *5FW* (Joyeuse, a Pop 7
worlds raised a fleet) but it\'s a fair working point.

Combining this with the *JTAS* #10 "Troops in the Fifth Frontier War"
article we get the following forces for major Sword Worlds:

Tizon (pop 300,000,000; TL 10)
 No ships
 One corps (1C-10), two divisions (20-10)
Narsil (pop 20,000,000,000; TL 10)
 29 ships (J1-10)
 Four armies (5C-10), one corps (1C-10)
Anduril (pop 200,000,000; TL 11)
 No ships
 One corps (1C-11), one division (20-11)
Gram (pop 6,000,000,000; TL 11)
 Nine ships (J2-11)
 Five corps (1C-11), one brigade (10-11)
Sacnoth (pop 3,000,000,000; TL 12)
 Four ships (J3-12)
 Five corps (1C-12), one brigade (10-12)
Sting (pop 300,000,000; TL 10)
 No ships
 One corps (1C-10), two divisions (20-10)

Thus, the entire Confederate Navy consists of 42 ships.  The Confederate
Army consists of something around seven armies.  These figures seem a little
low but keep in mind there has been no accounting for what are called
reserve or `colonial\' forces in the Imperium.  These are `older\' forces
used to supplement the regular forces.  For the Confederate naval reserve
let\'s assume an additional 42 ships but at one TL below that of the regular
forces: 29 at TL 9 (J1-9), nine at TL 10 (J1-10) and four at TL 11 (J2-11).
These `reserve\' forces may have comprised the Joyeuse Fleet of the 5FW.

The Confederate regular army forces are for offworld or `offensive\'
operations and do not reflect indigieous defense battalions on each world.

This example could be used to develop naval and army forces for any subsector
in the Regency (or elsewhere).  I hope we see it so applied!

Since it is getting late, and I don\'t want to root through my pile of 
Traveller stuff just before going to bed, I won\'t try to cite page numbers.
However, we do know that "deep meson gun sites" are the preferred method
of ground-based planetary defense, and that these are supplemented by
ground-based missiles and lasers.  I agree that these devices do not show
up in 5FW, which I _do_ have in front of me as I type.

Regina has only 10 SDBs, according to the 5FW map.  However, the numbers of
boats are strongly dependent on population, and Regina is not a high-population
world.  Jewell has 120 TL12 boats, Efate 150 at TL13, Rhylanor has 200 at
TL15, Zivije 120 at TL11, Louzy _500_ at TL8, Rethe has another 500, and
Porozlo has 1000 SDBs at TL10. 5FW does not distinguish between TLs for SDB
efficiency, so those 1000 Porozlo boats are quite a menace to any invading
Zho fleet.  Checking the population levels produces the following:

Population A: 500-1000 SDBs
           9: 100-200
           8: 10-12
           7: 1
          6-: 0

Note that some of the worlds in the population 8 or higher category also
contribute local jump-capable squadrons to the Imperial forces in 5FW.

I don\'t really think that the Imperium (as depicted) is all that hostile 
to local forces.

This reminds me--someone posted a few weeks ago that they didn\'t think that
the Imperium allowed multi-planet governmental bodies.  Go back and check
Adventure 7: Broadsword, for an example of a world (Garda Vilis) ruled from
the neighboring world (Vilis).  Also, there are quite a few type 6 governments
in the Spinward Marches.  I play that _some_ of these may be under direct
Imperial control, but the majority are in situations like that of Garda
Vilis.

I think you eventually pass out from the unrecycled air - you fall asleep
as your brain gets oxygen starved, and you don\'t wake up until the New Era
;)

>If the room is filled not with air, but with Oxygen only:

        You will die. Pure oxygen is poisonous to people, especially at
high pressures (this from a Cthulhu adventure I ran based on the bottom of
the South Pacific, but also corroborated by my J-o-T skill).

        See above. I\'m not quite sure that oxygen is poisonous at normal
pressure, but I\'m sure it is under pressure. And yes, pure oxygen and
sparks do not mix in a pleasant fashion.

>- -   how long before a typical human unfortunate dies from bad air in this
>   scenario.

        Depends on how much such a human had to start with. How big is the
room? When does the air shut off? Are thei spare tanks?

I think you could hedge on this to whatever is appropriate to the
adventure. Just assume that the room had x hours of air left, or had x
hours of backup air, or that x hours of air are in some convenient Vacc
Suits lying in the corner.

>At what tech level can you build guns out of non metallic materials?

Define Gun. You can build a simple gun-like contraption from natural
materials. If you want something more refined then you will have to wait
until the proper process comes along. I would say that only at TL7-8 (I\'m
more used to GURPS TLs, but I think those are the corresponding Traveller
TLs for Modern Times) for the ceramic/plastic guns that seem to get past
metal detectors.

I\'d bet MacGyver could build a simple Cannon-Locke or Matchlock out of
Bamboo and twine. . .

I would say the modern day. Caseless ammo requires being able to
manufacture a round with the powder already on it and not held by a
cartridge. Of course, technically I guess the old ball-and-musket was
"caseless" in a sense. . .

Granted, but the \'two group\' idea would solve the problem for both
groups.  Those that don\'t like TNE can avoid it easily, and those
that like all the Traveller variations can mail to and read both lists.

The ratio would be better, but the noise wouldn\'t be any less.  To me
(and, I suspect, many others), getting 1000 lines of useful material
out of 2000 lines of signal is not much better than getting 200 lines
of useful material out of 1200 lines of signal.

The problem is, Dave, that a lot of folks have alreayd picked up their
toys and left.  This might (no guarantees) get some of them back.  I say
this not because I just want the increased volume, but because many of
them were outstanding contributors.

Sigh.  I wish it were that easy.  I\'d love to prove you wrong, in the
fashion you offer, just to get the old timers back.  Unfortunately, if
any sort of pre-TNE incentive is offered, I suspect that what we\'re
more likely to see is a gradual return of some of the more interested
folks.  There are many that are still members of the TML today, but
just don\'t speak up out of lack of interest in the TNE.  If I weren\'t
so mouthy, you wouldn\'t ever hear from me. :^)  Scott Kellogg doesn\'t
post nearly as often as he used to before TNE (although his posts are
every bit as worthwhile and valuable as they used to be.)  Surprisingly
enough, this very subject (the TML/TNE split) has brought a couple
of old-timers out of the shadows, if ever so briefly, to wit:

For those folks that remember, we\'ve lost the priceless wisdom
of Metlay, the wonderful ship designs of Rob Dean, and many
others.  I never see posts from Bertil Jonell any more, and
I can\'t recall the last time Adrian Hurt stomped me into a
tortilla, arguing weapon designs.  Too many of the old, rich
voices are silent, and I for one, would almost anything to
get them back.

It has been suggested (and argued) that the TML list should be split into
several splinter groups.

I think that both sides have stated their points of view:
1) The volume and noise/signal ratios of the current TML are too high for me.
2) What\'s a little volume, it\'s the contributions that matter, wade through the
   cruft - the rest of us do.

Personally, I find myself falling into the first camp for various reasons, some
of which are technical and some of which are personal.  Firstly, I receive the
nightly bundles, which is about all that I can handle at one sitting since I\'m
saddled with a MUA that does _not_ automatically break the digests down into
individual messages for me.  This same limitation in my MUA requires me to wade
through entire articles that I couldn\'t give a hoot about just to get to a
short posting that I _am_ interested in.

I think that James\'s suggestion of automatic, individualized digests would make
everyone happy, you get what you want to read, you can post to the relevant
sub-lists as needed, heck you can cross-post if it\'s relevant to more than one
group.

I don\'t think that requiring a special "tag" in the subject line is the proper
way to go about things, though.  It makes much more sense to me (from a
technical point of view) to have separate mailing addresses for each of the
list, as well as separate "digestifiers" for each list.  If you want to
cross-post then send the message to all of the lists that are (or might be)
concerned.

I might also include a list called "Traveller-general",(or somesuch) that would
(hopefully) have broad appeal.  In the case of a cross-post to more than (say)
three sub-groups, the _actual_ message woud be posted to Traveller-general, and
only a short pointer message would be cross-posted to the others.

Yes, this scheme requires some thought in posting, but the poster _has_ to
realize that he/she\'s not only using up his/her own time, but the time of
countless others that may or may not have the same specific interests.

I think that it would be much more efficient in general to split the various
sub-groups out, require those that are interested to subscribe (or perhaps
subsribe them by default, and let them unsubsribe if they wish) than to
continue with the current high-volume mish-mash that we currently have.

As an aside, I probably will subscribe to any and all Traveller related mailing
lists that get created.  The main advantage for me will be that I\'ll be able to
_concentrate_ on what _I\'m_ most interested in, possibly skipping the other
stuff if I don\'t have the time for it at the moment.

I hope that the message above made sense, It\'s been a 12-hour day for me, and
I\'m not done yet...  :(

I \'ve been following the discussion, and note a *major* suumption being
made by practically everyone. An incorrect assumption, at that.

Interstellar space is not "empty". It\'s full of all sorts of dark
matter. Comet nuclei, the occasional planet,  giant molecular clouds,
etc.

A comet nucleus is a "dirty snowball", that is, it\'s water ice, with
amonia, methanne, and a fair amount of "dirt". The dirt willl be mostly
fairly finely divided stuff like carbonaceus chondrite meteoric
material. Plus bits or rock and other things.  And these snowballs will
be tens to hundreds of kilometers in diameter.

It\'ll be *real* easy to extract hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and
many other things useful for ship fuel or life support from these. And
even the small ones will supply fuel and other consumables for *decades*
of heavy use.

This may be a good reason for carrying fuel purification plants. If you
mis-jump into an "empty" hex, you have a fair chance of locating
something useful if you stretch your sensors to the limit and use
manuever fuel (and low berths) carefully. In CT or MT, scratch the bit
about manuever fuel. :-)

Also, once found, relocating them would be easy. Especially if you
plant a good beacon. I\'m willing to bet that pirates and
revolutionaries would find these ideal hideouts.

I\'d also be willing to bet that a number of such "bases" whether
illegal, or just "company secret" might survive the Virus, because
they\'d have long practice in "I\'m not here" tactics. If a ship jumps in
and doesn\'t give the right codes, they won\'t broadcast anything to it.
And if it acts "wrong" it\'ll be considered an enemy and dealt with. If
it\'s merely a misjumped ship, well, accidents happen.

This could explain the survival of groups of merchant ships. The
locations and codes wouldn\'t be entered into the ship\'s computers so as
to prevent them being found by the law or by competitors. Likewise, log
entries would be faked to make it seem like the ship had made one jump,
not two (or more) small jumps. So the virus might never find out about
them.

Yes. :)  The people in the room breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon
dioxide (well, some anyway; as anyone trained in CPR knows, a fair amount
of oxygen goes out too.)  Eventually, the oxygen partial pressure in the
chamber falls in favor of the carbon dioxide, until not enough oxygen is
left in the room for the occupants to continue respiration.  How big is
the room?

If you\'re really interested in this, check out old submarine stories --
WWII-era and prior submarine crews were *vitally* concerned with this 
question.  The old "diesel" boats equipped with the German schnorkel
could run their motors underwater, and ventilate with outside air, but
carbon *monoxide* fumes still could cause problems.  A lot of research
was done on both, from what I understand.  Nowadays, nuclear subs have
enough power to spare for "scrubbing" systems that this isn\'t the same
sort of problem.

As for the question about the pure oxygen environment, I\'ll leave that
to the Apollo 1 experts in the crowd.  Actually, come to think of it,
carbon dioxide build-up was an important hurdle for the disastrous  
Apollo 13 mission as well.

The battalions were grav-mobile, and had about the same bombardment factor
as a BatRon (but not same defense/offense).  Earth also had three corps-
level PD emplacements, non-mobile, one identified with each starport on
the chit.  Those had the highest bombardment in the game and a sizable
defense garrison.  Are you speaking from tactical experience?

Also, I\'m unconvinced Earth is a fair example...it\'s possible both sides
were treading lighter than they wanted lest they risk damaging Earth too
much in the fighting, for political reasons at least all around.

expect some of them to make it back because there are too many differences
caused by the new TNE/FF&S rules (Virus/ship movement). I don\'t know.

It\'s a fact of the TNE era. (the suggestion made here that the Virus

suggestion to make it more realistic).
    As for the ship movement problem, I happen to remember a vocal outcry
about the unrealistic DGP thrusters and about getting more science into
Traveller again. To a certain extent that\'s what we got.
    Admittedly not everything\'s perfect (to say it mildly for some).
    Hey, it\'s only a game, a Sci-Fi game at that. Game Designers are not
scientists (and even if they were, there would still be disagreement
over what\'s real and what\'s not).

Humans are used to breathing area that is 80% N2, 20% O2. The air
pressure they breathe it at is 14.7 lbs/in^2. The partial pressure of O2
is about 0.20 * 14.7 lbs/in^2, or about 2.9 lbs/in^2. This is the
theoretical minimum air pressure that humans can sustain while still
being able to get adequate oxygen supply to their cells. The practical
minimum air pressure, however, tends to be higher than this -- for one
thing, altitude sickness may set in at this low a pressure (bodily
fluids filling up the lungs). Also, pure O2 is only wise for short
periods as it tends to oxidize the linings of one\'s lungs. I believe
that astronaut\'s space suits have them running about at 4-5 lbs/in^2,
and the cabins of early space craft at around 6-7 lbs/in^2.

I think the shuttle uses a O2/N2 mix that approximates earth atmosphere
at sea level. All that inert N2 adds a lot of weight but makes the
astronauts much more comfortable.

	There has been some debate over alternate materials over in 
Rec.guns, particularly about stuff like the \'plastic\' gun depicted in the 
movie "In the Line of Fire\'.  For those who haven\'t seen it (and don\'t 
mind a spoiler;-) the bad guy, an expert in making plastic and 
composite materials (among other things) makes a simple two shot 
pistol that would pass through a metal detector.  Opinions varied, but 
given current tech levels on Earth (8-10 or whatever) such a gun is 
quite possible.  Also, remember the infamous Glock \'plastic\' pistol of 
several years back.  It was mostly made from non-metallic 
components.  The company has since increased the percentage of 
ferrous metal components, but at the time it was quite revolutionary in 
design.  Similarly, ceramic materials of sufficient toughness and 
durability exist to make the hard part of firearms today; what lacks is 
the economic incentive to make them.  Steel is cheap, and will 
probably continue to be cheap for some time to come.  There are 
other considerations to making guns lighter, too.  As long as we\'re 
using guns that recoil, a lighter gun is not neccessarily better.  Since 
perceived recoil is very dependent on the mass of the gun, a light gun 
has more perceived recoil, and a much greater effect on the accuracy 
of that second shot.  A Marlin .44 mag carbine has much less 
perceived recoil than a .44 mag snub revolver, and is much more 
accurate. Weight also affects the first shot accuracy as well.  A 
heavier gun requires more effort to move it, so small motions are 
less likely to upset the aim once it\'s established.. 

	Therefore the only time that non-metallic components will be 
used, in firearms, or anything else, for that matter, is when they 
impart a greater advantage over more conventional materials.  This is 
pretty much a standard dictum of manufacturing design.  Carbon fiber 
composite materials are pretty much state of the art stuff, as 
materials go, but they\'re commonly used in fishing rods, because 
they\'re so much better that other alternatives (performance-wise) that 
they make economic sense, oce you\'re tooled up to make them in 
quantity.  OTOH, the same carbon fiber technology is usable to make 
bicycle frames, but since the margin of performance gain is so much 
smaller over the best of more common materials, they\'re only used in 
very high performance (read ungodly expensive) applications.

	The same applies to caseless ammunition.  Caseless 
ammunition is in common use today...it\'s used for the 20 and 30 mm 
cannons used in fighter aircraft like the US F-16, and others (I don\'t 
know any others off hand)  These give a huge advantage over 
conventional cased ammo.  You lose the weight of the shells, and so 
can carry more ammo, and you don\'t have to store the shells after 
firing them.  (a great problem with cased is that when ejected from a 
highspeed aircraft during dogfight maneuvers, they can easily cause 
great damage to the aircraft firing them)  So, in one sense, we\'re (at 
tech 8 or 10, whatever we are) already capable of caseless ammo. 
Similarly, there have been experimental hand weapons made that 
use caseless ammunition for a few years now.  This has other 
problems, namely durability, and safety.  Coventional cased 
ammunition can be dropped, ground into the dirt, carried through mud, 
dunked in streams, rattle around in a pocket for years, and still work.  
Such durability hasn\'t been verified for the caseless ammunition 
avaliable today.  It will become practical, when A) it does prove as 
durable and useful as conventional ammunition, and B) it is 
sufficiently cheap that is is cost effective to switch, which involves a 
weapon redesign.  The latter probably won\'t happen until a 
government or two, large ones, decide that this is the new standard, 
and order it for their armies. Then, thanks to the economies of scale, 
caseless becomes cheaper and more avaliable than cased, and will 
probably start to supplant it.

	This long winded explanation of something tha would be easily 
answered by going to my books (or my campaign, where to simplify 
things, all commonly avaliable guns are caseless, and come in two 
calibers) is to point out what I percieve as a great problem of the 
\'granularity\' of the Tech level scale.  As someone has pointed out, 
Earth today is a low tech level, but only because we don\'t have 
interstellar flight.  Since the tech level is based on broad classes of 
technology, I don\'t think it\'s applicable to very minute detail, so the 
question of \'when is caseless ammunition avaliable\' is really moot.  
It\'s avaliable when it\'s needed and economically viable.  We had 
\'caseless\' ammunition over a hundred and fifty years ago, when 
paper cased cartriges for muzzleloading rifles were in common use; 
what tech level were we in 1800?

It depends on the volume of the room and how many folks are trying to
breathe.  Of course, I don\'t know *how* it depends (i.e. minutes per
liter of air per person).  It also depends on the pressure and percentage
of oxygen.  The greater the pressure and/or oxygen concentration (and
the fewer the people) the longer you can survive.

It\'s lack of oxygen, unless impurities are also being introduced.  The
human waste product, carbon dioxide, isn\'t harmful.

The explosive hazard is a product of oxygen concentration not pressure.
The higher the concentration, at any pressure, the greater the risk.
The confusion comes from the fact that higher concentrations permit the
air to be `breatheable\' at lower pressures.  Thus, early US spacecraft
used all-oxygen atmospheres at lower pressure (some chemistry folks or
divers can probably explain the partial-pressure thing) because the
craft pressure vessel didn\'t need to be as strong if the internal pressure
was lower.  The capsule fire in Apollo I on the launch pad changed all
that.  Since then, US spacecraft have taken the weight hit and used 
stronger crew pressure vessels in order to keep the oxygen concentration
closer to what it is in `normal\' atmosphere.

> - -   how long before a typical human unfortunate dies from bad air in this

A 100% concentration of oxygen at the same pressure as `air\' (~20% oxygen)
would permit you to breathe about five times longer but you would probably
only use a 100% oxygen environment at lower pressure (in order to gain the
stength/weight savings of the early US spacecraft).  At 20% of atmospheric
pressure (or thereabouts) you wouldn\'t live any longer in a 100% oxygen
environment than you would in a 20% oxygen atmosphere at standard pressure.
Below 20% of atmospheric pressure you\'d having trouble breathing even in
a 100% oxygen environment.

There isn\'t really a simple answer to your question.  Me, I\'d just wing
it.  Either they get out in time, or they don\'t.  :-)

    I was initially for the idea of a pre-Virus list...  because I was
    hoping that all those discussions about the Imperial background,
    equipment, places, amber zones, etc.  would come back.  I don\'t
    give 0.02 credits for the RCES, and the only use I have for the
    Regency stuff is for filling in holes in the c. 1112 Domain of
    Deneb area.  The Earth Colonies stuff is fascinating, but I\'m not
    sure yet what I\'ll do with it.

    ...but a pre-Virus TML is pointless if nobody posts on it.  I
    think David has a point; is anyone still interested in DISCUSSING
    the era besides me?  I have stuff I could have posted, but I
    sensed an underwhelming amount of interest in pre-Virus material
    -- all the posts were about TNE gun designs, Regency politics,
    RCES politics, etc, etc, etc.  I once issued an appeal for TNE
    ship designs from the TML\'s famous ship designers (that\'s you,
    Scott and Robert!), and saw nothing posted in return.

    I say pre-Virus list, because like someone else here, I like the
    TNE rules, but despise the background.  I\'d like to be able to
    discuss Pre-Virus and alternate history backgrounds, but using TNE

Melbourne Times News Service

Anokye/Pollux (1419.16 B848689-B) 21 Apr 3001
 In its official report released today, the Navy confirmed that the
unidentified ship destroyed at Epimetheus/Pollux three weeks ago by the frigate
Foch was an Aztlan Maza-class escort.
 According to the report, the Foch was conducting frontier refuelling shortly
after emerging from jump when it encountered the unidentified ship in the upper
reaches of the gas giant\'s atmosphere.  When it refused to respond to the
Foch\'s hail, the ship was fired upon and eventually destroyed.
 Initial efforts to identify the ship were hindered by the loss of the
wreckage in the giant\'s lower atmosphere.  The report states that the ship was
identified after an analysis of telemetry gathered by the Foch during the
engagement.
 A spokesperson for Commodore Geraldine Kolchak declined to comment on the
report, but sources close to the Commodore stated that the discovery of an
Aztlan warship in Commonwealth space was certain to lead to further escalation
of tensions in the Pollux subsector.

Dedn/Europa (2934.30 AA6A865-D) 24 Apr 3001
 In a terse communique released today, the mysterious Committee for State
Security announced that it had assumed all executive authority in the Meren
Worlds.
 Actual composition of the Committee remains unclear.  The Committee has been
rumored to be an extension of the reactionary wing of the Expansionist Clique,
which has suffered from increasing turmoil since the end of the Markets War.
 The status and location of Morrochai Gvo remains unknown.  The communique
stated that the Meren Autarch had been "relieved of its responsibilities" by
the Committee.
 In a separate statement, Ivondond Verch, leader of the Reformist Clique and a
frequent critic of the Autarch in the past, called for Morrochai\'s restoration
to its "appropriate and lawful position" and characterized the action of the
Committee for State Security as a "supra-legal usurpation of executive
authority".

New Canaan/Gaea (2215.10 A865999-D) 27 Apr 3001
 The New Lhasa Skystupa fell to the ground today.
 The gravitic spiritual and entertainment complex slowly descended from its
aerial position 800 meters above the city after its main gravitic generator
shut down.  A Skystupa spokesperson stressed that it had been a controlled
descent and that the Skystupa\'s 860,000 inhabitants were never in danger.
 The cause of the generator failure has yet to be determined.  The
spokesperson stated that Skystupa engineers hoped to have the complex airborne
again within a few days.
 The New Lhasa Skystupa is the first gravitic urban complex developed on New
Canaan.  The effect of the generator failure upon additional Skystupas
currently under construction at New Medina and New Istanbul remains unclear.

Aztlan/Procyon (0911.20 A9879A7-D) 28 Apr 3001
 The Imperial Household announced the engagement today of Crown Princess Sola.
The heir to the Adamant Throne will wed Don Arturo Kumate, an officer in the
Diplomatic Corps.
 The Crown Princess, currently serving as an auxiliary craft pilot in the
Imperial Navy, had long shown little interest in marriage.  Sources in the
Household have denied reports that the Crown Princess was pressured into the
engagement by Empress Ana and Grand Duke Guillermo.
 Don Arturo first met the Crown Princess nearly 18 months ago during a
reception held for her by the Ehime monarch at the Ehime embassy.  Don Arturo
has served as Her Majesty\'s ambassador to the Ehime court for the past three
years.
 The wedding, in accordance with Imperial tradition, has been scheduled to
coincide with the annual Festival of the Founders to be held later this year. 

Earth/Sirius (1720.19 A867988-D) 01 May 3001
 Earthsteward Emile Cevera opened year-long ceremonies today celebrating the
Tricentennial of the founding of the Commonwealth of Earth.
 "As we cross this threshold of our fourth century, we reach forward to the
myriad of opportunities that beckon to us," said Cevera in remarks carried live
across the globe.
 The Commonwealth Tricentennial will be celebrated in a variety of events over
the next year throughout the worlds of the Commonwealth.  The celebration will
climax with the Commonwealth Games to be held here at Earth.

Nyanza/Nyanza (1531.12 A86898A-D) 03 May 3001
 The Nyanzan Subsector factor for Ysinal udi-Quinan announced today that the
Aeroi mercantile giant had reached an agreement with the Nyanzan Navy to
provide armed escorts for YuQ shipping operations in Nyanza, Wanganui, Aquila
and Ourora subsectors.
 The three-year contract includes provisions for piracy suppression as well as
escort duties.  Representatives of the Federation Navy declined to discuss the
actual price of the contract.  Analysts at the Nyanza Securities Exchange
estimated the amount to be in the gigacredit range.  Ysinal udi-Quinan stock
had risen 5.625 points by the close of trading today.
 A spokesperson for the Ouroran embassy criticized the joint Aeroi-Nyanzan
effort as an "unnecessary and provocative escalation" of the recent trade
tensions in the region.

Amazonas/Ourora (1934.24 A766955-D) 12 May 3001
 House Moreira officially closed the Mendes Highport today.  The closing
coincided with opening ceremonies for the new Amazonas Highport which has been
operational for several months now.
 The Mendes Highport was constructed around the hull of the Conestoga-class
sub-light transport Chico Mendes which brought the original settlers from Earth
over five hundred years ago.  The ship served as an orbital base of operations
for the initial colonization of Amazonas.  Over the centuries the orbital
facility has grown into a sprawling shipyard complex that served as Amazonas\'
primary Highport.
 The new Highport was constructed by Moreira after it determined that further
upgrades to the Mendes facility were impractical.  Moreira officials have
described the new Highport as the "centerpiece of commercial infrastructure" in
the Community.
 The Mendes facility will be stripped down and the Chico Mendes hull
refurbished in time for the sexacentennial of the settling of Amazonas.

The following Sophont Brief on the Aeroi first appeared in *Melbourne
Times* #2.

The Aeroi were the first extraterrestrial race encountered by Terrans.  Aeroi
civilization is apparently not much older than Terran although the Aeroi did
achieve jump drive, with its subsequent interstellar expansion, several hundred
years prior to any Terran state.  In a sense, because it was an Aeroi ship that
first discovered a Terran settlement, the Aeroi actually \'encountered\' Terrans.

Physiology: The Aeroi are descended from arboreal, air-breathing grazer stock. 
A typical Aeroi measures 1.2 meters in height and masses about 35 kilograms. 
Aeroi are able to \'stand\' to a height of approximately 1.6 meters and their
\'wingspan\' measures nearly 2.6 meters.  Their coloring tends to be a variety of
shades from pale yellow through a deep orange.  They are hairless but their
tough skin provides good protection.  Aeroi are exceptionally agile both on the
ground, their primary environment, and in the air.  Aeroi flight capability is
limited primarily to gliding although actual \'powered\' flight is possible under
certain conditions (dense atmospheres, lower gravity).  Aeroi are limited to
speeds of 20 kph on the ground but have been known to approach 100 kph in
flight.

There are two Aeroi sexes with physical differences limited to the sexual
organs.  Aeroi young are born after a gestation period of six months encased in
a hard-shelled envelope somewhat similar to the eggs of Terran avians. 
Multiple births are extremely rare.  The young are \'hatched\' from this envelope
after a period of two months.  Females were originally responsible for the
envelope-stage young while males generally cared for the hatchlings.  These
traditional roles have become obsolete with the rise of technological
civilization.

Aeroi reach sexual maturity in their early twenties at which point they
generally leave their parents\' care.  Aeroi bond in exclusive female-male pairs
although these pairs seldom last beyond the period required for child rearing. 
Both Aeroi females and males remain fertile into their early fifties.  Life
expectancy commonly exceeds 120 years.

Aeroi posses exceptional visual (extending into the infrared range), auditory
(extending beyond Human high-frequency ranges) and taste senses but have no
olfactory organs.  A pair of eyes are located at the front of the head, as
is the mouth.  An ear is located on both sides of the head.  Breathing
orifices are located in this region as well.  Tactile senses are somewhat
limited due to the protective nature of the epidermal layer.

Aeroi manipulative appendages, which hang from the lower portion of the
abdomen, are highly agile and posses generally higher strength than those of
Humans.  The \'wing\' appendages also terminate in manipulative members although
these possess less strength.Their \'wings\' are also quite agile - giving them
great maneuverability in the air despite being limited to gliding flight most
of the time.  Aeroi utilize the \'wing\' appendages for ambulation and are also
quite mobile on the ground.

Aeroi speech organs are able to produce most Human sounds and both Dolphin and
Human speech is well within range of Aeroi hearing.  Much of Aeroi speech
though, occurs beyond the range of Human hearing but not of Dolphin hearing. 
This allows Aeroi to communicate to Humans if necessary but also allows
protected communication in the presence of Humans.

History: Aeroi sentience is attributed to changing environmental factors that
lead to decreasing food supplies for early Aeroi groups.  The gradual decline
in available vegetation lead to the need for increased cooperation among
far-ranging Aeroi groups in locating sources of food.  Family bonds dominated
most groups with numbers ranging from 12 to 30 individuals.  As the
environmental conditions continued to worsen, the need for manipulation of the
environment lead provided a further impetus for intellectual development.

The deteriorating environmental conditions led to increased conflict among
early Aeroi groups.  The scarce grazing areas though also served to maintain
great physical distances between groups.  Conflict became more \'strategic\' in
nature and was focused on migration and grazing patterns rather than actual
confrontation between groups.  Records of violence between Aeroi groups does
not survive in the historical record.

Eventually, groups learned that conflict could be managed.  Cooperation, in the
form of mutually beneficial arrangements, became increasingly common.  Conflict
still exists but takes the form of competition in the formulation of
arrangements.

Aeroi groups grew into clan or tribal organizations but mobility remained
important.  Even though technological advancement and improved environmental
manipulation have decreased the need for mobility it remains quite important in
the Aeroi psyche.  These \'tribal\' affiliations also remain quite strong.
The advent of technological civilization led to increasing mobility in the
search for resources and to competition among tribal groups.  This served as a
primary driver in the Aeroi move off-world and, with the discovery of jump
drive, into interstellar space.

The first record of Aeroi contact with Terrans is with worlds settled from the
Ehime Prefecture late in the 29th Century.  Since that time Aeroi economic
interests have expanded through most of the Colonies Sphere.  Until recently,
much of this period was characterized by intense economic conflict with the
Meren.

Psychology: The Aeroi are highly individualistic but are also strongly
influenced by tribal bonds.  Competition among tribal groups is almost
instinctual and the importance of individual contributions to this conflict is
widely recognized.  Aeroi can be ruthless to those outside their own tribal
group but are exceptionally compassionate to tribal members.

While the Aeroi seem to thrive on conflict they find violence as abhorrent. 
This is not so much a revulsion toward violence as it is a recognition of
violence as being blunt and inefficient tool.  In a sense, Aeroi see violence
as \'beneath\' them.

Aeroi see conflict and competition as natural methods of providing improvement
and innovation.  The idea of cooperation in an environment free from
competition is completely alien to the Aeroi.

To a certain extent, the Aeroi see outsiders as natural.  Aeroi tribal groups
have always seen each other as outsiders.  While this has prevented a cohesive
racial attitude from developing it has provided the Aeroi with an advantage in
dealing with non-Aeroi sophonts.  They see non-Aeroi as no more \'alien\' than
other Aeroi tribes.

Society: In modern society, Aeroi tribal groups are generally organized around
some sort of commercial enterprise.  These groups are often insular and because
of this highly diversified in their activities.  The Aeroi respect for the
individual leads to a great deal of tolerance for diversity within the group.

Each tribal group provides its own governmental structures.  In this sense
there is no Aeroi government per se.  Instead a variety of organizations, all
of them Aeroi, compete in a broad range of activities.  One might even say that
there is no Aeroi society, but rather a collection of Aeroi societies.

Aeroi tribal entities are almost exclusively commercial ventures.  These
entities are fierce economic competitors both among themselves and with
non-Aeroi groups.  The Aeroi seem to have some difficulty interpreting the role
of Terran governmental entities.  For this reason the boundaries between
economic and political competition are often blurred from the perspective of
Terrans.

The Aeroi distaste for violence is apparent in that Aeroi military and security
organizations are almost exclusively staffed by non-Aeroi.  In general, Aeroi
military forces tend to be small and conflicts limited.  The Aeroi prefer, and
are usually able, to resolve conflicts by non-military means.

    'body' => 'There have been a number of postings of late about Imperial military
structure; especially in the Regency.  I have been running CT/MT/TNE
campaigns for more than 10 years, and I have always had a problem with 
GDW\'s ideas on Imperial military structure.  While GDW\'s structure is
fairly straightforward, they forgot just how big and feudal the Imperium is
(was/will be).

In my campaigns, the main military arm of the Imperium is the Imperial Navy.
The Marines are part of the Navy, just as in the United States.  The 
Imperial Army does not normally exist, except as Army-level HQ and support
units stationed at convenient locations.  

The Navy has three levels to it; Imperial Navy, Imperial Navy Reserve and
Colonial Navy.  The IN is the regular active force.  The INR consists of
recent retirees and Depot-stored excess ships, and includes training
units and ships at various IN bases.  It would also include support ships and
large transports for Imperial Army movement. The Colonial Navy is an ad hoc
force made up of starships from the navies of Imperial member states.
Such units would tend to be mainly patrol or escort vessels; few worlds
need or can afford dreadnaughts.  Each sector has a single fleet, with one
group per subsector (each with 1 or more squadrons).  Each sector also has
one reserve fleet, which can be bolstered with Colonial forces during a
declared emergency.  These units would be organized into planetary squadrons,
or composite squadrons for worlds with only a few ships.

The Marines are the regular ground forces.  There are Fleet Marines assigned to
ships as security or drop troops, Garrison Marines assigned to guard
Imperial facilities, and Line Marines assigned as additional units.  These
forces are used for fast response, and are the ground force normally used.
If drop troops attached directly to Groups are not sufficient, the fleet has
access to Line Marine units carried in bulk transports.  In general, a 1000
ship Sector Fleet would have a full corps of Line Marines available, as well
as several Marine Landing Brigades (Drop Marine brigades) in the fleet,
and at least 1 Marine Landing Force (Drop Marine battalion) per subsector
Group.

If more ground force is needed (an extended occupation) the Imperial Army
would come into play.  Units would be activated from the armies of
Imperial member states.  They would be combined with units of compatable
Tech Level to form divisions, corps and armies under Imperial Army control.
The IA would supply high-tech command and support units, and INR transports
would carry the forces into battle.

The justification for this is largely economic.  It is expensive to maintain
a full-time army.  The Imperium has a proven need for a Navy and for quick
reaction ground forces carried by the Navy, but a full-time Army is a 
needless drain on resources.  Why not use the armies of the member worlds,
much like a feudal levy (except better trained and equipped). 

Just some thoughts... any sort of input is welcome.  I have done a lot
with deep-space stations too, so maybe I\'ll throw my weight into that
discussion next time.  As regards the TNE/CT controversy, I find the 
new background OK, but I would like a Regency/Imperium sourcebook 
someday.  I am fairly pleased with the rules, except for starship combat.
I\'m lazy, so I like the cheesy simplicity of CT starship combat or the 
abstract comfort of High Guard.

None of this reflects the views of my employers (who would probably
like MT starship combat better anyway).

[Rest of the table omitted.]

Ooops!  Guess that was a lot of information to digest at one time.  The
first problem is that the headers for my table aren\'t as clear as they
could be.  A better header might read like this:

Hex_Location   World_Name/Subsector_Name (Allegiance)   Distance (pc)

Thus, for example, the world Issyk Kul, located in hex 1620.20 in the
Procyon Subsector, is a member of the Commonwealth of Earth (Co) and
is one parsec away from Earth.

In the Earth Colonies campaign many subsectors are named for
their brightest star.  In this Jump Destinations Table for Earth/Sirius
(that is, the world Earth in the Sirius subsector), Procyon,
Fomalhaut, Pollux, Sirius and Vega all refer to *subsectors* rather
than to the stars themselves.  Following the Traveller convention the
*system* name is omitted and the main world name is used with the subsector
name instead.  Thus, the star names from the 2300AD Near Star List do
not appear in the world/subsector names in the Earth Colonies campaign.
For example, in the example above, the world of Issyk Kul is actually
located in the Alpha Centauri system but appears on star charts and the
like as Issyk Kul/Procyon.

The 2300AD Near Star data lists Cartesian (xyz) coordinates in lightyears
(cyr) for the star systems.  These coordinates were converted to parsecs
(pc) and overlayed onto a three-dimensional sector hex map (basically a
`stack\' of 36 standard Traveller 2D sector maps to add `depth\') centered
on the Sol system (Earth) located at hex 1720.19 (again the conventional
1720 sector hex location but at a `depth\' of 19 pc in the `stack\').

A Jump Destinations Table like this one for Earth is developed by a
world developer so that jump distances don\'t have to be continually
calculated for that particular world using the Cartesian formula.  These
calculations *can* be made though for any two worlds in a sector if their
hex locations are known.  For example, Issyk Kul, at hex 1620.20, is one
parsec from Earth, at hex 1720.19 as follows:

SQRT [ (16-17)^2 + (20-20)^2 + (20-19)^2 ] = SQRT [ (-1)^2 + (0)^2 + (1)^2 ]

= SQRT [ 1 + 0 + 1 ] = SQRT [2] = 1.4 which rounds to 1

Hope that makes the 3D Earth Colonies Sphere a little clearer.

I think we\'re beginning to discover some truth about the Sword Worlds.

No, I get your point, I just don\'t see any `facts\' that support these cycles.
What is it about the technological disparities between worlds that suggests
these cycles?  I understand that you\'re saying that without things cycling
up and down there ought to be no disparities - every world would be TL 15.
Why does this have to be the case?  While it\'s clear that technological
knowledge ought to be equivalent throughout `known space\' there is nothing
to suggest that economic development is constant as well.  It might
be that lower tech worlds just haven\'t `grown\' to higher technological
accomplishment yet - like on contemporary Earth.  Why the need to propose
these mysterious `techno-economic cycles\'?

I\'m not sure this is really relevant to our discussion but I\'m not sure
I agree with this idea.  A TL 6 mechanic is going to have problems fixing
the electronic-fuel-injection in my TL 8 car just as a TL 6 computeroid
is going to have difficulties trying to replace the vacuum tubes in my PC.
A TL 4 electrician won\'t have a clue how to fix the CRT on my TL 5 TV.
Of course, you\'re going to say she can because her world was at TL 8 when
she went to trade school two decades ago.  :-)

If the 5FW counters `prove\' that there are truly disparate TLs in the
Sword Worlds doesn\'t that lend credence to the idea that disparate TLs
are due to disparate techno-economic *development* rather than `cycles\'?
And won\'t that, in turn, generally call for Sacnoth to be the dominant
world unless Gram is receiving outside help?

I agree.  Someone *please* dig out those *5FW* counters!

If there is true techno-economic disparity in the Sword Worlds then Sacnoth
can dominate *economically* - like Japan does today - and it doesn\'t *need*
a confrontation.  (But a little `demonstration\' might not hurt!)

I just checked the *JTAS* Contact article again.  It merely describes the
original Sword Worlds settlers as `Solomani exiles\'.  There is no mention
of *any* warfare.  The time is the c-400.  I\'m not sure when the Interstellar
Wars occurred.

Doesn\'t different levels of `techno-economic development\' explain the
disparate TLs as well?  This *is* how it works today!  Why the need for
something different?  Maybe `techno-economic development\' is really what
TL is measuring.

Because these are the only four that have achieved that level of `techno-
ecomomic development\'?

But this isn\'t what *you\'ve* proposed!  If Sacnoth is selling its high-tech
goods to all the other Sword Worlds then the technocracy can\'t stop at the
individual worlds because the economy doesn\'t!  This is the nature of a
feudal technocracy - the poltical situation is tied directly to the economic
situation.  If the economy is interstellar then political power in inter-
stellar and the center of power out to be the strongest technocracy - Sacnoth.
Unless there is outside influence like the Zhodani.  Again, quoting the *JTAS*
Contact article:

"A Confederation Council, made up of representatives from all worlds,
regulates interworld trade, handles diplomatic relations with outside powers,
and adjudicates interworld disputes."

Sounds like the Japanese *keiritsu* to me.

No, I don\'t.  I have no idea how deep this sentiment is.  Remember, I suggested
that this `sentiment\' might not exist anywhere except in the mind of Imperial
propagandists.  Here\'s the quote from the *JTAS* Contact article:

"This public prejudice against psionics has been the major element in limiting
Zhodani influence in the region."

Well, fine, but I\'m merely trying to provide some data for your 10-to-1
question.

Actually, with the benefit of historical observation there are very few
incidents where any `unlikely\' victory can not be explained.  We share this
`historical viewpoint\' as `developers\' of the Sword Worlds.

> Perhaps the anti-Zhodani sentiment was strong on Sacnoth but weak on Gram
> 300 years ago.

Well, again, maybe.  Another interesting fact from the *JTAS* Contact article:
the only Psionics Institute in the Sword Worlds is on Sacnoth!  Which is
listed as a "third factor (and in may ways the most significant)" why psionics
have not been made an integral part of Sword Worlds culture because "the
omnipresent interworld rivalry reinforces the latent anti-psi prejucice
among the inhabitants (and governments) of those worlds not politically
dominated by Sacnoth."

> Nowadays they _do_ have a politically stable Confederation.

Doesn\'t sound like it from the above quote.

I was thinking more along the line of a `mini-pacification campaign\'.

The geo-political reason is called `spheres of influence\'.  Examples are
the US in Vietnam and the Soviets in Afghanistan.  The Sword Worlds are
removed from the Consulate yet are situated on the Imperial border.

I wasn\'t trying to explain the SW incursions.  I was trying to explain the
lack of an Imperial pacification campaign.

They haven\'t `stopped\' it - it keeps occurring!

I merely saw `decades\' as analogous to centuries when comparing a millenia-
old empire to a two-century-old nation.  I feel the Sword Worlds *have*
been a bother and that the Imperium *hasn\'t* taken *decisive* action. A
pacification campaign is decisive and consistent with past Imperial actions.

> Very propably. Or perhaps it\'s a "Real Men don\'t need psionics!" thing.

This is what the *JTAS* Contact article suggests.  My suggestion is that
that entire `real man\' schtick for the Sword Worlds is all just a bunch
of Imperial propaganda.  I suspect the Sword Worlders are no more 
`paternalistic, macho, vain, braggarts\' than Zhodani are `mind-sucking,
inhuman totalitarians\' once the veneer of Imperial propaganda is removed.

> Depends on the economic developements.

Not if the reason for Gram\'s leadership has been access to Zhodani aid.
In TNE one might suspect King Angus of Gram to be cherising his last cigar
and cursing his former patrons like Fidel.

> OK. So you think the Confederation is one huge Feudal Technocracy, right?

No, I think it is a bunch of planetary technocracies too.  *You* have suggested
there is a great deal of economic integration between these economies which,
in my understanding, calls for a broader interstellar technocracy as well.
In this view there are no `planetary kings\'.  There are just `CEOs\' that
see their influence and power spread across several worlds.  They don\'t have
a direct economic interest in things like diplomacy so they relegate it
to the Confederation Council.  But since economic power is political power
in a feudal technocracy then the strongest poltical power ought to be the
strongest economic power.  We both see this as Sacnoth.  You choose to see
mysterious cycles to explain Gram\'s leadership while I blame the Zhodani.

Who\'s assumptions better fit these facts?

Some more good work.

Subject: TML split

    
    With regard to the TML split:
    
    I personally don\'t care either way but I thought of some alternatives 
    that might please people.
    
    This of course means work (a lot?) for James.
    
    Initiate a code to be present on each message (possible list below):
    
            TNE:  Traveller New Era specific,
            FFS:  Fire Fusion & Steel specific,
            HG:   High Guard or Trillion Credit Squadron specific,
            CT:   Classic Traveller specific,
            GDW:  stuff about releases and or erata etc,
            FLM:  Flame material about anything you hate,
            GEN:  non-specific stuff
            others to be determined
    
    Here\'s your work James:
    
    Each subscriber should be able to specify which labelled messages they 
    want to receive.
    
    Any messages received by the server that DON\'T have a label (or 
    several labels) are rejected and returned to the sender with an 
    appropriate dirty message.
    
    
    Sounds really complicated but it would be nice.
    
    Is this possible or is my head in the clouds again?

    'body' => 'I agree that GDW has been somewhat inconsistent on how the Imperial
military worked.  Here\'s my two bits:

I disagree about the Imperial Army.  IMHO, they\'re a fairly important and
much under-noticed branch of the Imperial military.  The Marines may be
the shock troops and Rapid Deployment Force, but much of the day-to-day
scut work falls to the Army.  They pick up the jobs the other services
miss.  They are the "UN peace-keepers" that keep fighting on balkanized
member-worlds from getting out of hand.  They\'re the occupiers who help
maintain civil order in the former Solomani Sphere.  They\'re the planetary
Coast Guard, who perform search and rescue missions when necessary.
In areas of unrest, they\'re responsible for the defense of member-worlds
within the 1/10 diameter limit.  When necessary, they\'re the troops that
go in behind the Marines to secure the planetary foothold they\'ve made,
and follow it up with the type of force the marines aren\'t meant to deliver.
If there\'s a big public-works project to be done, the IA Corps of Engineers
are called in.  Note that at least seven of the eleven regiments of the
Imperial Guard were IA units, with the IISS and Marines providing one
each and a special formation of Aslan another.  (Note that these IA
forces under the General Staff staged the coup that unseated Styryx in
favor of Gavin.)

The IA is supported by the powerful, high-tech worlds, although recruiting
is universal.  Like the IN, Colonial Reserves and planetary or even
national armies are permitted...as long as certain unofficial but well
understood guidelines are followed.  In fairly safe regions of the realm,
they aren\'t very visible.  In the Marches and in the Solomani Rim, they
are a more common sight.

Note that the IA is a joint command, as mentioned in _Mercenary_.  It
isn\'t just the army, but also the aerospace force and wet navy.  The
idea is that the main mission is defense of individual worlds.  Because
of thise focus, levels above the individual world command are less
important in the IA than in, say, the IN, which is interested in the
defense of entire subsectors and sectors.  Furthermore, individual
units, while loyal to the Imperium as a whole, would typically be more
closely related to their host world than an IN command is, due to the
need for coordination between planetary government and the Imperial
defense forces.

The joint command system in the IA also means that, depending on the
mission and the composition of the troops, it is equally likely that 
one would see a Vice Marshal as a Major General, for instance, in an
overall command position.  Wet navy forces would tend not to be          
deployed as freely off-world as land or air forces, of course.

In terms of inter-service rivalry, notice that some of the peacetime
IA missions are broadly similar to missions that might be undertaken  
by IISS Contact & Liaison teams.  This sort of dove-tail overlap 
seems to be characteristic of the way the Imperium operated its\'
military forces.

On another note:

>I\'m lazy, so I like the cheesy simplicity of CT starship combat or the

Cheesy!  Heck, it was great, once you got past the trigonometry.  You
could play it with a handful of index cards, a calculator, some 
mimiatures, and enough flat space.  (Oh, I suppose a tape measure and
dice would be useful too....)  Portable, quick, clean rules.
Although owners of the 1977 rules might notice that ranges seem to have
increased just a bit in the modern era. :)  At least we\'re now using
the metric system.

we split the list?" angst there.  The big issue was over computer 
wargames vs. classic paper and cardboard games.  Usually a person 
prefered one over the other.  Instead of splitting the list they elected 
to use voluntary message headers.  On the subject line an article about 
computers would have the mssg "COMP:" This worked pretty well.  It would 
work for the TML as well IF each message was sent individually instead of 
in bundles.  I don\'t know if engrg@UWO.CA has the resources to do this 
though.  I sincerely believe that splitting the list is a bad idea.  I 
have a great deal of empathy for the CT/MT crowd.  I can understand the 
very justified sense of frustration that comes from spending hundreds of 
dollars and hundreds to thousands of hours learning about Lord high 
poo-poo and the land of the nobodies only to have it all become INVALID.  
I used to be this obsessed as well.  After a while I found that it was no 
fun though.  This is supposed to be a hobby.  We are supposed to be 
enjoying ourselves.  Splitting this list splits our community.  Everybody 
loses from this because instead of banding together we become separate.  
Already these separate groups are building their sense of self by 
identifying and attacking an "OTHER".  In our community the rift is over 
CT/MT vs. TNE.  This is almost as stupid as the conflict in the Russian 
Orthodox Church about whether to use three fingers or two when making the 
sign of the cross.  TNE has a very broad vision.  CT/MT fit within the 
scope of TNE.  The equipment has changed but it isn\'t 1978 either.  Our 
views of science have changed.  What is possible now wasn\'t possible 
then.  What seemed likely then, much like flying cars from the fifties, 
has proved to be more difficult than we imagined.  

With a change in technologies comes a change in social structures and 
politics.  This is a basic premise of science fiction.  By changing the 
equipment in Traveller GDW ***HAD*** to change the third Imperium.  The 
TML has provided nearly countless examples of how the new TNE rules 
change the way things work in a traveller campaign.  This really proves 
my point.  GDW had a choice.  Either they could leave Traveller alone or 
they could change it.  They chose to change it.  Once they began to 
change it they realized that the third Imperium made much less sense than 
before so either the changes had to go or the third Imperium had to.  GDW 
chose to dump the third Imperium.  This is a fact.  It can not be 
disputed.  They have offered the Regency as a replacement and this makes 
sense because most of GDW\'s developement is in the Spinward Marches.  
Opening traveller to other companies had the unanticipated affect of loss 
of control for GDW.  Imagine that as the referee in your campaign your 
players could change the fundamental realities of your campaign world.  
I\'m sure that GDW faced something like this and chose to reassert control 
of their campaign.  Thus we have TNE.

This has gone far afield and I apologise for its length 

Later I may continue and discuss how TNE opens new doors for SFRPG\'s and 
all of the "good" aspects of TNE.  Until then I wish to share my regrets 
that like any change the creation of TNE has resulted in the destruction 
of the third Imperium.  I never really like it but I used it.  I took the 
ideas in the the third Imperium and used them.  I took adventures from 
the black books and used them.  They were great adventures because they 
could stand alone from the third Imperium.  Sadly, this trend was not 
continued in MT and it is the main reason I lost interest at the time.

remember that we are all in this because we love Traveller

Speaking of ship designs,

Here is the Dakaar-class freighter, which was partially described
in _The Drenslaar Quest_ by W.H. Keith published by Gamelords.

While the Dakaars operate mostly in Reavers\' Deep, equivalent 
designs are likely common throughout Imperial space.


Dakkar-class freighters were built by Starstream Enterprises 
on Caledon (Tech Level 12) and were operated by Starstream, 
Dakaar Trading (a subsidiary of the Dakaar Corporation), the 
Aariskin Corporation of Ildrissar, and a number of other 
subsector- or larger sized shipping and trading concerns. 
These ships are designed primarily for surface-to-surface 
cargo transfer capability.  While they have no space dedicated to 
a ship\'s vehicle, most crews commonly carry an air/raft in the 
cargo hold.

The time depends on the size of the room, who is breathing, and
whether they are conserving their air.  Normally about 4% of
the air is converted from oxygen (O2) to carbon dioxide (CO2)
per lungful, but this may change as the ratio changes.

Normally there is 20-21% O2 in the air, humans need at least
half that to survive.

CO2 is poisonous, however.  I heard once that CO2 poisoning
would kill you before O2 deprivation would in this situation.
This may have only been under pressure, however.

There are easy ways to neutralize the CO2, however.  Divers
that use recycled air do this (supplementing with additional
O2).  There are also ways to convert it back to O2 (I think
submarines do this now).

Any room filled with O2 is a fire hazard.  The O2 doesn\'t
actually explode, but it promotes burning of anything else
in the room.  As the pressure increases, this effect will
increase, so that more and more becomes vulnerable, but...

The real hazard is that pure O2 is deadly at ANY kind of
pressure above 1 atmosphere.  Pure O2 will allow you to
breathe at a LOWER pressure, however.

>     scenario.

I don\'t think the CO2 poisoning effect would be diminished
(it might actually be worse, since there will be more O2 to
convert).  Therefore, no longer than before.

It\'s a bit complicated to determine exactly how long the
unfortunate has.  Partial pressures determine if the air
is breatheable and/or poisonous.  5% CO2 at 2 atmospheres
is as poisonous as 10% CO2 at 1.  Less O2 is also needed
at higher pressures, and even 20% O2 can become poisonous
if the pressure gets high enough.

As a rough rule of thumb, you could divide the volume of
air in the room by the volume of a lungful of air.  This
is how many lungfuls would convert 4% of the air from O2
to CO2 (alter this 4% number drastically based on activity
level--perhaps 1-10%?).  At one atmosphere, the air will
be unbreatheable when the O2 drops to 10% or the CO2 rises
to its toxicity level (whatever that is).

Increasing pressure would help prevent O2 deprivation
(assuming the O2 partial pressure doesn\'t reach toxic
levels), but it would not reduce the CO2 poisoning effect.

Actually Survival Margin should not be treated as Virus-infested by
CT/MT enthusiasts.  The majority of it is filled with TAS news regarding
events within the 3I (or at least the various factions) and should be of
direct use with rebellion-era campaigns.  Then there is the rules for
conversion of characters to TNE.

Another thought slowly crept into my gray matter recently.  Namely some
of the scenarios for use in the Star Vikings campaign could be used in a
rebellion era campaign.  Given the premise that as the Black War
continued the Imperial infrastructure began to break down leaving forces
of the factions with reduced assets and many of the worlds have
withdrawn from the interstellar community and may be more than a little
xenophobic.

Smash & Grab scenarios may be adapted by having forces of the factions
raid worlds for many of the same reasons RCs do: rescue prisoners,
capture  technology, overthrow gov\'ts to install one that favors their
faction.  As you mentioned ideas for scenarios can come from almost
anywhere - they just need the proper interpretation.

Say, isn\'t this what I suggested a day or two ago?  Does anyone read TML
anymore, or is there just too much information?

The idea of the NPC swap is great and Ill submit some of mine later today 
but one thing that can also be a challenge is coming up with original NPC 
names sometimes on the spot during a session and when preparing for it.  
To help alleviate that burden I would like to submit my names list that 
keep handy when Im a GM.  Perhaps someone has a similiar list they would 
like to share.  Note that many of these names will be familiar as they 
are taken from popular and obscure novels.  Some from the credit pages of 
well known Traveller pubs.

Natalie Norwood		Dag Formasa
Nathan Kopek		Tula Ba
Lin Po Lee		Rulon Mylook
Alex Baldwin		Sergi Chien Chu
Niman Poseen		Admiral Scolari
Nikko Imbala		Ikor Mylook
Booly			B J Eyzaguirre
Keem So			Derek Dacarassimi
Ryber Hysook		Tamara Ard
Marla Sa		Strephon Pecorin

And While Im at it, here are some place names I have categorized them but 
use them as you see fit.

    'body' => 'I like Steve Charlton\'s Ideas on Imperial Marine/Army/Navy
organization, and want to fill it out a bit.

I\'ve had it in mind (and still am planning to) design some of the
major components of a Marine Expeditionary Division of the
Imperium.  Here\'s some design considerations;

Everything this division needs must be optimised to take up the
least amount of volume.  MBTs and APC with energy weapon armament,
a focus on energy-based support weapons would be the beginning to 
prevent a huge logistical need for shells/bullets.  Infantry weapons
would be similarly designed.  Actually I would probably equip with
4mm Gauss weapons because of the low signature (compared to energy
wpns) low noise, and since 4mm gauss ammo is relatively easy to
manufacture at any industrial world, and takes up a low amount of
space per round.  (manufacture one jump-2 away-much easier to transport
than some tech-14 ACR explosive or binary propellent ammo).

Actually there is a series of books, "Until Relieved" is one of
them, where a weapon (which I think was a gaus weapon) used wire
on spools as ammo, and had a cutting/straightening tool to seperate
the wire into individual rounds.  Not a bad idea.  (could that have
been one of the series by J. Andrew Keith?  The memory fades when you
hit 27.)

Space transport should be modular.  I envision a "Rodger Young" class
Company Assault Transport which would be deployable alone, in pairs,
or in hordes as a division.  I also thought there would be just a few
"Divisional Assault Transports", Which I want to build as a battle
rider, each rider holding one battalion of either combat or support
function.  This configuration allows planetwide coverage for orbital
fire (one ship would only be able to cover a portion of the planet
with orbital fire) and sensors.  It also reduces in-system vulnerability 
(not counting the tender, of course) of the division if there are still
space-bourne defenders (there should not be).

At one point I was thinking of an artillery vehicle with four 5-barrel rotary
mass drivers.  This would allow the equivalent of a platoon of artillery in 
one vehicle.  It would also increase vulnerability since one well-fired
missile takes out a platoon of artillery.  The other problem was that the 
MDs had to be 100mm (to fire submunitions and Remote Deployed Minefields)
and this created an enormous power requirement.  They do seem possible,
however, and I intend to design them as such.  The advantages of deploying
one vehicle in place of four is still greater than the disadvantages.

Imperial Marines are equipped with Tech 15 hardware whenever practical.
This should save space, make the expeditionary force superior in technology
to the majority of opponents, and prevent the full utilization of any 
captured equipment (since the enemy cannot maintain TL15 stuff on TL12 world,
in theory).  

The Marines are a combat organization.  Other functions are handled by other 
branches whenever practical.  For example, there\'s a (Marine) combat engineer
battalion attached to the division, but if additional engineers are 
needed in a given situation, borrow them from the regular army.  Logistics
is handled by Navy personnel until supplies reach the ground.  I would put
Air Superiority in Navy hands, but Close Air Support (when used) with
Marine pilots.  Likewise, there should be a Marine officer directing
orbital Fire Support (although the gunners are obviously Navy).

Ok, Now my questions.  How many combat battalions in an Imp. Marine
Division?  How many companies per battalion?  Platoons per company?
Troops per platoon?  Are companies combined arms? or are platoons?
Is artillery organic to the Battalion? or the company?

Translation of above;  What does the Table of Organization and Equipment
look like for a Marine Division?  I\'ve made some suggestions above, but am 
not familiar enough with military organization to know "what works"
and what doesn\'t.  What "monkey wrench" would get thrown into Marine
organization within the imperium?  Perhaps a few incompetent Noble
commanders?

Remeber that Marines are probably often deployed as companies, and should have
many of the divisional services provided at lower organizational levels
(A combat engineer squad?  I guess we could get carried away.)

I can\'t reach Sunbane either, and have been unable to contact Dan about
it. I know it\'s there, but flaky, because the TML is still (sort of)
running, and it uses disk on sunbane. Let\'s all sit on our hands and

list just because they didn\'tlike TNE. If they had stayed and continued to
submit ship designs, adventure ideas, designs and the like, there would still
be plenty of Classic and Mega-Traveller material here. Their choice to leave
was their choice. I still think that if everyone agreed to, we could just live
in peace with each other. For instance, I run an Imperium-based game using the
TNE rules. Ideas I might come up with that aren\'t strictly rules based would be
useful to anyone running in the Imperium, wouldn\'t they? And here\'s a weird
thought-is there anyone out there who LIKES the Virus-based TNE background,
but prefers to use MegaTraveller or Traveller to run it? I\'d be really inter-
ested in seeing ship designs etc. for something like that. Another idea: there
are some nifty things in FF&S that aren\'t in High Guard. How would you go about
"porting" these things backward so you could use them in the older version?
   I do agree that the constant fighting about TNE vs. CT vs MT has probably
hurt the list. I\'m willing to completely drop the subject under the following
condition:
      No more insulting remarks made about either TNE nor the people who
play it. You can say "I really don\'t like TNE" rather than "TNE bites and so
do you".
   I\'m a naturally defensive person and it really bugs me when people slam
something I enjoy. I\'ll try to control that, but all I ask is that others
try to control their vehement dislike of TNE and not be insulting.
  I\'d really prefer to get back to talking about Traveller. I\'d rather not
see the list split, not because I\'m afraid of losing my "audience" but because
I really do enjoy the diversity of subject matter and opinion that a larger
list allows for.

One of the things which makes SF for me is Non-Humans. Despite the number of
pre-generated non-human races in Traveller (Vargr, Droyne, Hivers, K\'kree, 
Aslan) there seems to be no establised method of rolling your own. Do the 
members of the list have any hints, tips or suggestions on how to create a 
believable non-human race, for use as either PCs or NPCs? Are there any 
favourites out there from the annals of Traveller history?

P.S. Has anyone else noticed the similarities between the RCES Marines as
portrayed in Smash & Grab and the MI from Heinlein\'s Starship Troopers?

P.P.S. Being a relative newcomer to the list, I would value the input of
those who chose to leave the list when TNE was launched, so I vote for
the \'temporary two lists\' idea. (I have CT, MT and TNE.)

Stuart.

Ammel Brodrig			Born, Arizona Dawn  Day 187,1160

I was born in the coastal city of Alameda on Arizona Dawn where I 
grew up with my two sisters.  My parents worked in the area.  My 
father was a ParaWIG drivers and my mother a computer builder.  They 
urged me to excel in school and other activities.  I was able to get a 
Federation Scholarship to the cosmonautical Academy on Prima.  After my 
four years there, I entered the fleet.  Through hard work and 
determination I was able to climb up through the ranks and after only 14 
years in the fleet I was on the verge of my own command.  Quite an 
accomplishment.  Then it happened.  The Icarus Incident.  I was the XO of 
the NeoSol Federation Destroyer Icarus, the CO was the son of some 
Council Senator.  We were doing a routine docking  with a civilian high 
port.  When docking was imminent, the CO inexplicably vented the Heplar 
thrusters into the docking area.  The surge and heat buckled the main 
door and the plasma exhaust superheated the air in the hangar deck 
causing an oxygen flash fire the moved through the entire wing of the 
high port.  518 people died and hundreds more were injured.  In the 
ensuing investigation the CO dissappeared from sight and questions about 
him were brutally repressed.  The most mysterious being that a post 
accident med exam revieled some sort of implant? in the CO\'s head.  I 
never knew what to make of this.  In any event I was the only one 
available to court martial.  They had to "hang" somebody, the CO was 
nowhere to be found so they chose me.  The navy will always protect 
itself, I learned and will make you look like a complete bozo to do so.  
Some called for my execution, in the end I was discharged to the colonial 
corps where I now run a system outpost in the system of Home.  Me and six 
other sad sacks and several dumb robots.  I think that I had my fill of 
this, youre going to get screwed anyway so you might as well have fun, I 
think I\'ll take Belle Starr up on that offer...I always wanted my own 
High Port.

My family has always been space faring, hell my brother and I were both 
born in space aboard the family ship, Speculator.  Ive no children but my 
brother long lost to the depths of space has two.  They are back on 
Aurigae but I swear that as soon as I make that big score, Ill retire and 
help take care of them.  Even with Noel\'s talents, the Speculator grows 
long in the tooth....so Im looking for that big multiMCr deal...any 
suggestions or leads you might want to pass my way for a few Cr or a cut?
Well anyway, Im off to Alameda High Port to pick up some important 
charter and to meet some guy who claims to have known my Brother, he 
wouldnt be the first...the other turned out to be mistaken.

Ref: BJ is the ultimate speculative trader.  He tools around in a 100 
year old far trader with a crew consisting of a sentient TL 14 android, a 
refugee Jonkereen and a mechanical genius.  He\'s looking for that last 
big score but hasnt found it yet.  After that he can buy that ranch on 
Enope.  But does he really want that ranch?  Isnt it really the thrill of 
the deal that makes his heart beat!?....

They said it must never be allowed to happen again.  But when Union of 
Senled tanks rolled across the Great Plain into Nemo, no one lifted a 
finger to help a small defenseless nation.  Sure they talked but decided 
It was easier to let Union of Senled have their way.  Maybe theyll be 
satisfied with that, right?!?  Well it was my home they razed.  My 
parents they butchered and so I had to do something about it.  When that 
command ship blew up in the harbor I watched from shore...my handiwork 
having been responsible.  They eventually figured out what happened and 
who.  I was captured and due to be shot until a raid broke me out of 
prison and I ran to Enope.  I know that the Union of Senled has agents 
here on this planet.  I also know that there is a beedling vault on 
Aurigae, I just dont know where.  In a war zone there is little 
opportunity for careful archaeological surveys...what I do know is that 
vault may contain what we need to push the Senled out of our nation, or 
in the wrong hands...ensure Union of Senled domination of Aurigae.

Ref: Jana started off as farmer and studied biology and agriculture in 
tech school.  When Senled invaded her home country of Nemo she became a 
resistance fighter(or terrorist depending on your POV) and helped to sink 
a Union of Senled ship in Nemo\'s Landing Harbor.  She was captured and 
imprisoned but subsequently escaped in a Nemon raid in the facility.  She 
escaped to Enope where she met Ulysses Stark where he was then a local 
Constable.  They eventually married (covertly).

Salvor started off as a "law enforcer" until he decided he wanted to fry

assualt the very structure of society itself.  His right hand still 
twitches its electronic nerves when he remembers how (Name omitted for 
Security Reasons) had it cut off to teach him a lesson.  That was in the 
confederation days.  The Unified Sphere Charter put Rach into your 
jurisdiction.  The Mysterious Foundation has covertly hired you to 
investigate the so called Cyber Conspiracy which supposedly is linked to 
seperatism on Rachland and the Icarus incident..but how?  You are 
liscensed to carry your trusty Brock-10mm etc pistol anywhere, some 
strings have been pulled your dissappearence faked, your visage altered 
and you are now part of the Piedmont Investigative Service sent to Rach 
aboard a Universal Exports ship with the man known as Mr Songstrom.  What 
will some strange occurences on Rachlan reveal?  Only time and hard work 
will tell.

	Other things: I would switch to the Pre-TNE list and drop the

the deluxe CT set I had.  MT had a rich, complex background... It was
a lot more interesting... So I\'ve been trying to learn everything
about the 3rd Imperium/Rebellion era since then, getting many
headaches in the meantime :).  I wouldn\'t want to drop everything for
TNE. :)

Subject: re: A pre-Virus/TNE list

First up:
- ----
Thanks to those who replied with useful tips on running out of air, and 
availability of non metallic guns. Much appreciated. I\'m still interested 
in more info on this if anyone has comments to make. This is one of the 
main reasons I find TML a useful thing to subscribe to: the helpful 
suggestions of others.

Re: A second Traveller List
- ----

I would prefer it if the list didn\'t have to split, but can cope if it 
does. My main worry (as some other posters have expressed) is that there 
may not be enough in the way of traffic on either list to keep them going 
if the list splits. Rather than debate it though I think we are just going 
to have to try it and see. 

I do think the idea of people posting Pre-TNE material to the TML is a good 
one though. It would demonstrate:
    
    (a) the amount of actual active support the separate list would get. 
    Though admittedly only from those who are still part of the TML: it 
    wouldn\'t show up those who left and who might come back - but will they 
    come back anyway? Do they know about what is being proposed, and has 
    someone asked them what their view is? 
    
    However, if there is enough support amongst -current- TML membership 
    then I think it is clear that the split has a good chance of working.
    
    (b) whether people actually found the \'signal to noise\' ratio still 
    poor to accept even after the amount of useful signal improves.

I agree. I like the new generation traveller rules. My current campaign is

What do people think of PRE_VIRUS rather than PRE_TNE? Would this be 
acceptable to the people who wanted PRE_TNE in the first place? For me, the 
important difference between CT, MT, and TNE is their respective 
backgrounds, much more than their rules.

I\'m still interested in -reading- it at least. And then maybe asking a few

Steve then goes on with an excellent explanation of a workable, sensible
military structure for both naval and ground/planetary forces.

The question I have is just how is this different from the canonical
structure?  There are a few minor discrepancies (like subsector naval forces
organized into `groups\' rather than `numbered fleets\') but on the whole it
seems quite compatible with `official\' military organization.  Admittedly,
it\'s the first time I\'ve seen the Imperial Marines divided into Fleet,
Garrison and Line units but this is mere color.  The use of Imperial Army
forces only on an as-needed basis also seems to be consistent.  The
Imperium didn\'t rely upon mobile Imperial Army units to protect individual
worlds but instead left that to `indigineous defense battalions\' raised
by and restricted to individual worlds.  Imperial Army forces were raised
at roughly ten percent of these levels for `Imperial\' use.

My own take on the problem with Imperial military structure was the idea
of `separate\' planetary forces - aerospace and `wet navy\' forces - that
were distinct from the `ground\' planetary forces - the `army\'.  Since
distinctions between land/water/air/orbital transportation disappears
at Imperial tech levels (TL 13+?) it seems to me that military organiza-
tional distinctions should `disappear\' as well.  I find it hard to believe
that the Imperial Army and Marines are not equipped for combat on a 
waterworld or have to rely upon Naval or other aerospace forces for
close-air support, inter-theater transport and the like.

An Imperial Army (or Marine) unit should contain land, water, air and
orbital elements capable of dealing with combat situations in any planetary
environment.

In the Earth Colonies campaign, I\'ve dealt with this issue by abandoning the
traditional `army\' units types - infantry, cavalry, armor, etc. - for more
generic `planetary\' unit types as follows:

Anti-bombardment units consist of guns, missiles, screens or other forces
  intended to counter aerial or orbital bombardment.
Bombardment units consist of missiles, airborne bombers, ortillery or other
  forces that attack from a position removed from the battlefield.
Combat Platform units consist of battlefield weapons platforms such as armor,
  air combat, ground attack, sea attack or other forces.
Patrol Platform units consist of mobile weapons platforms used for land,
  air or sea patrol.
Platform Carrier units consist of mobile forces used to introduce Combat
  Platform units directly into remote battlefields.
Transport units consist of mobile forces used to transport other units
  between bases or battlefield rear areas.
Troop units consist of battlefield troop forces such as infantry, cavalry,
  jump troops, robotic troops or other forces.

In conventional military terms, anti-aircraft batteries and ballistic
missile defense (SDI/`Star Wars\') forces would be Anti-Bombardment units;
ballistic missile, air bomber and cruise missile forces would be Bombardment
units; fighter aircraft, tanks, and attack submarines would be Combat
Platform units; AWACS aircraft, reconnaissance satellites and some surface
vessels would be Patrol Platform units; aircraft carriers would be Platform
Carrier units; airlift and sealift forces would be Transport units; and
marine infantry and air cavalry forces would be Troop units.

The concept of the battalion as the basic military unit is maintained but
the idea of `battalion\' is broadened to described a particular collection
of combat forces regardless of whether the `battalion\' is actually a
`conventional\' collection of troops, a collection of combat aircraft,
a collection of submersibles, or whatever.

A 1960\'s era Rand Corp. published study "Habitable Planets" covered this issue,
among others, in some detail.  It may be avaliable in large university
libraries, it was at my university.  It is recommended reading for anyone
interested in what type of planets humans could live on.  It has been over 5
years since I last checked it out and I can not recall any details but it
provides upper and lower limits of oxegen, atmos. pressure, temp etc.  

If anyone has easy access to a university library a short summary of its
conclusions would be beneficial to the mailing list.

Text item: Text_1

     I have for the past year played a mixed game of T:2300ad and MT.
     Mainly allowing some of the 2300ad races and at least the stutter warp
     drive into the MT game.

       My question/suggestion is can the Pentipods (who are bio -
     technologist) create a \'biological\' computer to run the new starships?
      In theroy it should be possible.  The qustion is: if one can be
     created how much volume would it consume and what amount life support
     will be required to maintain it?  Also at what point of complexity
     would the \'computer\' become selfaware?  I figure without a cybiline
     interface the computer would be immune to the silicon virus.  I have
     not neen able to find anything in either 2300ad or FF&S to offer any
     clue as to how to design one of these units.  Any suggestions or ideas
     would be apprecated.

            ASLAN INVASION OF REGENCY TERRITORY
 
 
I was looking over some UWP data of the Spinward Marches
recently, and many of the worlds I thought were part of the
Regency (Rebellion Era) were marked as being controlled by the
Aslan.
 
The data in the Imperial Encyclopedia reflects this.
 
One of the worlds was Glisten!
 
I wouldn\'t have expected an asteroid cluster with a population of
9 BILLION and a tech-level of 15, a naval base, a scout base,
major shipyards with large Imperial Naval contracts, and a
civilization based heavily on interplanetary transportation to
fall to any but the largest conceivable Aslan Fleet!  What
happened?
 
Was there a typo?
 
Does the errata clarify this?
 
A skim through TNS (Traveller News Service) entries failed to
clear this issue up.
 
So, Attention all Regency and Rebellion History buffs!

[ WARNING: IMPERIAL VIRUS HAS INVADED SUNBANE!]
Well, seems like it anyway :-)
This didn\'t seem to get through first time, so I\'m resending. Thanks to 
Pierre (609/7649) - yes, a currency-killing virus would be devastating. I\'m 
sure I\'ve heard this one before, I\'ll have to see where from... a book? TML? 
Anyone know?

GREEN VIRUS

I\'d just like to explore a \'green\' virus (601/7543) a little further. Thanks
to Steve for his input (602/7555), I\'d like to ask the following (of him and
TML as a whole):

> First, viruses tend to be *very* species specific.

My biology knowledge (at the limit) tends to zero, so I can\'t argue, merely
propose:
a) I used the word virus. Would any virulent form of bacteria or other
organism be more suitable as a biological warefare agent?
b) The virus could afford to be specific if it targeted the correct victim.
There might be a suitable common factor among most worlds (type or species of
livestock, crop type, human type, etc.) that would allow it to hit all worlds
hard. If not, perhaps this might explain why some worlds have survived better.
Surely some \'agent\' which affected humanoids in a generic manner (e.g.
respiratory) would affect all the human species and could still be quite
lethal to Aslan and Vargr. Perhaps the Hivers don\'t use the same blood
oxygenation techniques that our bodies rely on. Perhaps (like Asian flu), the
virus (oops, used that word again), can cross between apparently dissimilar
species in certain cases?

> Second, if it destroyed the ecosystems of planets, the Imperial core would
> be essentially rendered uninhabitable, especially if the "virus" was
> persistent in nature.

The species-specificity probably prevents total annhilation of an ecosystem.
Assuming the \'agent\' was intended as a biological weapon (rather than some
strange disease that dropped off a passing asteroid or was sent by the
ZHhhasjycgerh from a nearby hostile galaxy), the makers would not have
intended to wipe out an entire planet\'s flora and fauna as this would make the
world useless to them (assuming they were intending to take control of it).
On the same lines, the \'agent\' would be reasonably short lived (weeks to
months) once active, otherwise the planet would again be unusable by the
\'conqueror\'? Of course, if the Hivers sent it, or somehow had a hand in it, 
perhaps they already have the neutralising agent and are just watching 
everyone else squirm?

> Third, unlike the computer virus, direct physical contact would be required
> to spread the virus. Fourth the rate of spread would either be slow enough
> to save outliers (like, say, the Solomani Confederation),...

Even if the \'agent\' were spread by contact, it ought to be able to cover the
majority of the Imperium eventually - after all, most worlds are contacted by
starships. On major traffic routes with several hundred or thousand ships a
day passing through, landing, etc. the chances of contamination ought to be
high. If the \'agent\' can be airborne, or can stick to the outside of a ship
(somehow surviving atmospheric entry, vacuum of space, solar radiation, etc.)
or anything along these lines then it could still spread widely. Of course,
if the incubation (or inactive) period of the \'agent\' is too short then it
would start showing up before it had spread very far. Perhaps this was
intentional - find a potentially hostile planet, sow the seeds, leave planet
innocently and then a year later when the war has started the inhabitants
wonder why their crops/livestock/etc. have all just died.
With regard to the Solomani (and Zhodani, Aslan, Vargr, et al), I\'m not sure
how bad they\'ve been hit anyway [FACT ALERT: I don\'t have TNE!] and it would
only require one trader to smuggle his goods (and hence the \'agent\') across
the border to a source who then carries the goods to an A-class starport,
providing a central distribution point for the \'agent\' to all the surrounding
worlds.
An airborne \'green\' virus certainly doesn\'t require physical contact to the
degree that the computer virus does (even if it were spread by data networks
and radio links).

> It might be possible to work up a plausible scenario of some sort,...

I\'m trying:
a) just out of interest (knowing little about such warfare methods),
b) in case any TNE virus-haters find this more useful than the computer virus,
c) in case I can use this \'agent\' on a smaller scale in other games (hell, I
ain\'t even had the Rebellion yet!).
The GDW virus has already taken some direct hits in all the flak that\'s been
thrown at it. It\'s still flying, because it\'s the official version, but I
think it\'s probably less plausible than a \'green\' virus, especially when it
appears that some people are wondering if the computer virus is psionic, in
order to explain it\'s methods of contaminating low tech computers, etc.!

> ... but it would be substantially different in form than the TNE scenario.

Why? My initial thoughts were that an \'agent\' would be designed to mostly
knock-out a planet (killing crops, livestock or people) without destroying its
useful factors (flora, fauna, natural resources, man-made structures). Once
discovered it could be defeated (eventually) but progress would be gradual and
even once a counter-agent were discovered, it would be difficult to distribute
to every world affected. In those areas where the \'agent\' had died out
(possibly intentionally, possibly due to over-gorging itself on the available
victims - a bit like yeast dies off in brewing), people would get together
pretty quickly and set up quarantine areas. These would have to be big
because, just like the computer virus, a single infected ship or person could
bring back the virus.

Right, I\'ve lit the fuse, let\'s see what pretty colours the fireworks are. Any
CONSTRUCTIVE replies (direct or to TML) would be much appreciated. I\'m not
interested in long arguments on why a \'green\' virus wouldn\'t work. Instead
replies of the "this factor would be a problem... but perhaps the virus was
engineered to get around it like this..." would be much more useful.

SHIELA-X (601/7539) - Thanks Pete. I know some players who\'d love to 
play/meet her.

L\'OEUL D\'DIEU (601/7538) - My French knowledge is as extensive as my 
Biology. If this is God\'s Eye (or something) where\'s the Mote? Thanks Steve, 
another set of data to add to my collection.

EARTH COLONIES (603/7566, 7567) - More useful background (I don\'t play 
anywhere near the Solomani but the organisations, etc. will still appear in 
my games near the Spinward Marches). Keep it coming, Dave.

DEEP SPACE STATIONS - Nice discussion, especially 602/7554 and 603/7565 
(err, lost the name and Steve again, respectively). Just where does every 
tenth supply ship go after it leaves the Naval depot? It seems to jump in 
the wrong direction for any of the known naval bases... ah! Just imagine the 
embarrassment finding Zhodani naval bases in \'empty\' sectors of the Spinward 
Marches, Imperial bases in the middle of the Solomani Rim, etc.

REGENCY SOURCEBOOK - Just wish I had TNE and could contribute in some 
manner. Oh well... What we need is another mailing list, say tml_beta? :-)

AND THE LATEST BIWEEKLY MAILING
Looks like lots of other messages got lost as well as mine.

DEEP SPACE STATIONS - Keep talking guys

LONGBOW - Interstellar psi networks - old hat. My 3I campaign uses them 
between all Imperial subsector capitals, especially those in threatened or 
rebellious areas. Of course, the populace don\'t know this and it\'s pain of 
death to let the news leak out. Since I play a Scout Corp special agent 
(with my colleagues posing as Imperial counts and countesses) we 
occasionally are allowed to use the psi post service if we need urgent 
direct contact with the central intelligence office of the Emperor (who

              TML INTERESTS -- WHO PLAYS WHAT?
 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION LATELY ABOUT AESTHETICS ON THE
TML, TIMIDITY INHIBITING POSTING DUE TO DOUBT ABOUT TML\'ERS
INTERESTS, AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS MUCH INTEREST ANYMORE
AMONGST TML\'ERS IN THE CLASSIC AND REBELLION ERAS.
 
LETS CLEAR THIS UP ONCE AND FOR ALL...
 
The overwhelming response to my For Sale notices for Classic and
MegaTraveller spares indicates a high level of interest in
pre-TNE eras.
 
As for my own pushing of TNE, it might interest you to know that...
 
I have yet to begin playing TNE because I\'m determined to play
all the way through the first two eras before I do.  I do however
have a deep facination with TNE, and since my gaming group has
been on haitus for the past month-and-a-half or so, I\'ve been
posting a lot concerning the Regency circa 1200.  Well, as
circumstances would have it, (Seattlelites, take note) my gaming
sessions shall be starting up again this coming Saturday, so the
slant of my messages shall probably be returning to the Classic
Era very soon.
 
How soon we forget...
 
NOT VERY LONG AGO, BACK IN JANUARY, GUY GARNET (aka DEREK
WILDSTAR) DID A SURVEY OF TML\'ERS TO SEE WHO WAS RUNNING WHAT
KIND OF CAMPAIGN (CT, MT, TNE), AND WHAT RULESETS THEY WERE
USING.  OVER 40 TRAVELLER REFEREES RESPONDED.
 
BELOW IS TML BUN 541 / MSG 6734, WHICH INCLUDES GARY\'S SURVEY
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS.  I THINK YOU WILL FIND IT MOST
INTERESTING...
 
====================================================================
====================BUN 541 / MESSAGE #6734=========================
=====================WHO PLAYS WHAT? SURVEY=========================
==============By Gary Garnet / aka Derek Wildstar===================
=======================January 31st, 1994===========================
====================================================================
 
A (relatively) recent discussion on TML got me thinking about campaigns.
What do Traveller players and referees currently play?  So I asked that
TMLers who are currently in a campaign (as either players or referees) to
send me some e-mail saying which rules and what campaign background you are
using.
 
I got a total of 42 responses, describing 52 campaigns (two people were
involved in three campaigns at once, and six were involved in two campaigns
at once).  Several people described campaigns which had just ended (finished
and unlikeley to continue) or ones that they *would* run if an opportunity
presented itself - I didn\'t count either of these cases.
 
I can draw some interesting observations from the results.  First of all, 42
responses is a statistically significant sample of the TML population.
While I have no way of knowing if the sample is random or not (the sample
is those people who responded to my survey), there is also no reason to
believe that it is *not* representative of the TML as a whole.
 
I\'m on more shaky ground when I try to extrapolate the results on TML to the
game-buying population as a whole.  I would suggest that TML is representative
of the older segment of the game market (college students and young adults),
while it virtually ignores the younger segment of the market (high-school-age
buyers).
 
 
SUMMARY:
 
The envelope, please:
 
The rule set with the most campaigns is _TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA, with 50% of
the vote, and more than twice the number of the closest runner-up.
 
The background with the most campaigns is CLASSIC THIRD IMPERIUM, with 48%
of the vote, and slighly less than twice the number of the closest runner-up.
 
 
RULES:
 
    Rank    Title               Percent
 
    #1  Traveller: The New Era      50%
    #2  MegaTraveller               21%
    #3  "Classic" Traveller         19%
    #4  2300AD                       6%
    #5  GURPS                        4%
 
I was suprised to see MegaTraveller get more votes than Classic Traveller,
although the result is quite close (one vote!).  From TML traffic, I would
have expected it to score significantly higher.
 
 
CAMPAIGNS:
 
    Rank    Era or Background       Percent (*)
 
    #1  "Classic" Third Imperium      48%
    #2  "New Era" Campaigns           27%
    #3  Rebellion                     12%
    #4  Other                         10%
    #5  2300AD                         4%
 
(*) Does not sum to 100% due to rounding.
 
This result was suprising, particularly in light of the above.  I would have
expected that the New Era campaign background would have been more popular
with New Era purchasers, but only a small majority (54%) of those who use
T:TNE play in the official T:TNE universe.

What\'s interesting here is the depth of support for the "Classic" Third
Imperium.  No matter which rules set you are talking about, it seems that
there is a significant percentage of those people playing in a 3rd Imperial
background.  It would be interesting to compare sales to date of T:TNE with
total sales of Classic Traveller and MegaTraveller, I wonder if it
correlates with the numbers of campaigns currently being played?
 
 
CONCLUSIONS:
 
I note that the largest single segment of the Traveller campaign "space" is
the T:TNE rules and the "official" Post-Collapse background.  But this
is internally fractured, and (for example) RCES or Star Viking materials may
be of limited utility to people who are running a Pocket Empire or Regency
campaign.  These "New Era" campaigns also represent slightly less than 27%
of the Traveller campaigns currently being played.  While there\'s no larger
single rules/setting combination, there should be a way to reach a broader
part of the Traveller players.
 
If it were up to me, I\'d certainly put some effort into a "Classic" Third
Imperium campaign supplement.  Potentially, such a supplement could be
impetus to cause new sales of the T:TNE rules, be "converting" people who at
present see no advantage to changing rules systems.
 
Again, IMHO (In My Humble Opinion) there\'s not a whole lot of point to the
other segments of the market.  There\'s no effective way to write for the
"other" segment - FF&S comes about as close as you can get to targetting this
population with it\'s alternative technology rules.  The Rebellion represents
a small market (11.5%), and in addition, "Third Imperium" materials may
still be useful in a Rebellion-era campaign.
 
The numbers for 2300AD may not be reliable.  TML is composed primarliy of
Traveller players, and discussion doesn\'t usually apply very well to 2300AD
topics; therefore the game and it\'s background may be significantly
under-represented in the survey.
 
 
NOTES:
 
"Traveller: The New Era" includes two rule sets: Traveller: The New Era and
Deluxe Traveller: The New Era (referred to elsewhere as T:TNE and DT:TNE,
respectively).
 
"MegaTraveller" is just that.
 
"Classic Traveller" is a number of rules sets and options: Traveller (the
original boxed set, Books 1-3), Deluxe Traveller, The Traveller Book, and
Starter Traveller.  Any or all of these rules, in combination with Books
4-8, Striker, and/or the DGP Task System (described extensively in The
Travellers\' Digest prior to the publication of MegaTraveller) - these all
were aggregated under "Classic" Traveller, because they were effectively the
same game.
 
"2300AD" includes Traveller: 2300 and the revised edition, 2300AD.  No
respondents reported that they are using the original (Traveller: 2300)
edition.
 
"GURPS" is, of course, a Steve Jackson Games product; it was included
because I have heard considerable anecdotal evidence that it is a popular
choice for people who don\'t consider Traveller a viable game system, but
want to continue playing in a Traveller-like setting.  It is aparrently not
as popuar as word of mouth would have it.
 
The definitions of the campaign backgrounds are or course more subjective.
In general, I went with whatever label the respondent chose for his or her
campaign.  In a few cases it was a tough call, but I put the response in the
category that seemed to fit best.
 
"Classic Third Imperium" campaigns are those set in or around the
Pre-Rebellion Third Imperium.  Some referees indicated that they may implement
the Rebellion in their campaigns.  Just like hypothetical or future campaigns,
I categorized campaigns based on what is happening *now*, and not on
future plans which may or may not be realized.
 
"New Era Campaigns" are those set in a Post-Crash universe, whether it be
the official RCES and Star Viking setting, or referee-developed Pocket
Empire, Free Trader or even Regency campaigns.  I would like to provide a
breakdown of the different types, but in many cases there isn\'t enough
detail in the responses to say for sure which category is applicable.
 
"Rebellion" campaigns are those set anywhere in Imperial space in any time
after the assasination of Strephon to the Crash.
 
"Other" campaigns are those in original referee-generated universes, or
universes modified beyond recognition.
 
"2300AD" campaigns are those that use the Traveller: 2300 or 2300AD campaign
settings.  There don\'t seem to be many of these around anymore.
 
 
If anyone has additional questions about this, send me some E-mail and I
will be happy to answer questions about this survey.

So you see, there still is a lot of interest in the Classic and
Rebellion Eras.  Unless these refs have all changed over in the
past 4 months.  Confirmations, anyone?
 
I hope I\'ve helped to distinguish all doubt.
 
As for what guidelines there are for discussion on the TML, the
only restriction in TML\'s charter is that it be at least vaguely
related to Traveller!
 
Don\'t be timid, don\'t be shy.  Get your favorite subjects

Found this in my Mech Eng. Handbook so I ought to be accurate:

**** WARNING: MILDLY TECHNICAL DISCUSSION FOLLOWS!!! ****

A average person consumes 0.83 kg of oxygen and produce 1.00 kg of CO2 per day
for a give volume of air at 1 atmosphere and 25 degree C come to something
like this:
	7.776 * Volume in cubic meters = hours of Oxygen for 1 person

However I am unaware of the concentration of CO2 would be toxic to human in a
sealed enviroment so this would be a ultimate limitation.  Also these value 
are for someone who\'s awake so it can be increase if these folk were asleep or
resting.

The best example of this would be the Apollo 1 tragedy.  The crew capsule at
that time used a pure oxygen supply which ultimate killed the crew when it
caught on fire(fuel was in the cabin material).  I would rate
the odds of a fire a MUCH greater risk then running out of O2.  Assume this
scenario is played out in the presence of operating device (electrical/optical
/or mechanical) I would try the following:

		To determine if a oxygen fire starts:
			Average: Pressure in atmoshpere + modifiers

			modifiers
			+1 if mechanical device present
			+1 if optical/electronic device present
			+2 if High speed mechanical device present
			+3 if High power electric device present
			+5 if Anything sparks!

Determining on the nature of the material the fire could be a glowing amber
(low level of reactant or slow burning type) or an explodsion that engulfs the
entire room...  Makes for short adventures though....:(


>Some questions on firearms...

The Glock series pistol and the Steyr series rifles are both examples of
existing guns with frame built of plastic.  However the receiver and barrel
are both made of traditional metallic materials.  So late TL-8 is when I would
expect them.

In order to make the barrel and receiver out of non metallic would be
diffcult.  What is need are high temperature, high strength, and high wear
resistant materials.  So far none of the non-metallic materials exibit all of
these qualities.  If the goal is to pass through airport type metal detector
then you could use metal composite made of non-ferrous (i.e. iron) materials.
Materials like Carbon Titanium composite is an example.  But don\'t expect to
see these until about TL-10

In FF&S it states that any non-ETC rounds after TL-10 are caseless.  As to
when it becomes practical it depends on your definition of \'practical\'.  If
the concern is \'cook-off\' that pretty much been solved.  If the conern is
reloading you\'re out of luck.  In my campaign I allow players to make their
own ammunition (within reason as to type) if they possess a ammunition mould
and press set...think of it as an injection moulding machine for ammunitions.
However it\'s a ship mounted device...definitely not man-portable.

Also as a side note: use of caseless ammo allows receivers to be designed
without the normal ejection cycle...thus allow a potentially higher cyclic
rate of fire.

Subject: Shall Not Perish 16 - Regency Navy

[Regency Fleet list omitted...along w/some other stuff]

Just a few comments on the list...

Looking back at my MT map of the Spinward Marches.  Isn\'t all of Glisten
subsector within the area of Aslan Conquest?  Not to mention about a quarter
of Trin\'s Veil Subsector (spin-rim ward)?  Assuming the conquest area
would narrow as it reached deeper into Imperial territory, I dare to
assume that Pax Rulin, Gazulin, Sindal, and Tobia would\'ve been overran as
well.  (Also see Imperial map in Survival Margin, pg 98)

I would suggest that the 100th, 201 to 204th fleet be either deleted
(persumed destoryed during the invasion) or reconsolidated into a new
fleet due to heavy losses. (probably incorporated into the most senior
of the five fleets)  I don\'t know if \'displaced\' is such a good description
of what happened to fleets from conqured areas.  It seem unlikely that
these fleets would withdraw and let their keep be overrunned unless they\'ve
taken significant losses.

However, If the Aslan Ihati and the Regency are at peace in the New Era,
these fleets could be re-established with Aslan Ships.

Also about 1/2 to 2/3 of Aramis Subsector was overrun by the Vargr
Invasions.  I would imagine the 214th also took a beating before this was
allowed to happen.  If the terrority was not retaken by the time of the
New Era the 214th would probably still exist but expect it to have shiny new
TL-16 ships and performing quite aggressive patrols along the frontiers.

The 193rd fleet would be tasked with the job of keeping the Swordworlders
in line (punitive strikes/aggressive patrols/showing the Regency banner).

Given the proximity of 43rd fleet to the area of the Aslan conquest, I
would expect the 18th (Lanth) fleet be re-delopyed to help cover that
subsector\'s border with the Swordworlds.

Considering the central location of the 73rd (Mora) and 23rd (Rhylanor)
Fleets, these would probably be the original core of the Patro.  Expect
to find large number of high jump performance battle squadrons here.

The same would go for the Deneb Fleets.  I don\'t have a map of the Sector
so I\'ll leave it to other to ponder their fates.  However the Reft fleets
are probably gone.  Dulinor wouldn\'t let go of 188 perfectly good fighting
ships so nearby.

- -Ed

p.s. Great listing.

p.p.s. BTW I beleive the Deneb 212th (Lamas) should be 213th.  Still 
conflict with the Regina fleet though.

Signal to noise ratio.  TNE != Traveller.  The game systems are very
different.  The flavor of the games is really different.  If I wanted
realism, I\'d join the army.  I\'ll stop ranting now.

This seems to be a common problem with large groups.  Look at the
Classic Trek vs. Next Generation vs. DS-9 fights.  Look at the 
DS-9 vs.  Babylon-5 fights.  Look at the rec.games.mecha vs. the
sci.military folks fight on the B-5 newsgroup.  Most of the fights 
are silly. 

I will admit that the rec.games.mecha vs. the sci.military folks fight
is fun to watch.  The giant robot fans are basing their arguments on
game rules while the sci.military folks are talking about real world
experiences.  Weird.  Catch it on the Babylon-5 newsgroup.

I\'d like to see the list split.  That way if I have a busy day I can
save the TNE postings for another time.  Also then I can discuss the
old adventures without someone bringing up the GDW-virus.

Lets save bandwidth, shall we?

1.) I support the est. of a seperate CT/MT list

2.) I will continue to sub both lists.

3.) Those now departed aren\'t the ONLY ones who can design vehicles!  Perhaps
more of us should take a hand in that activity.

4.) Right now my biggest "signal-to-noise" problem puts CT/MT vs. TNE
discussions squarely in the "noise" category.

Thank you for your attention, we now return to your regularly scheduled

What we get from TCS is an annual naval budget, based on UWP, and

A LOT low, unless you are talking about capital ships only.  I might 
believe that the Sword Worlds has only 42 active-duty Battleships, but
given the naval budgets and yard capacities of even Tizon or Sting 
(let alone Narsil - ohmigawd!), I cannot believe that the Sword Worlds
has only 42 total battleships, cruisers, carriers and escorts.  Sting
alone should have that many.

Remember, the Confederation has been in the habit of taking on the 
Imperium; I suspect they run a much larger navy in proportion to their 
population than the Imperium does.  Compared to the Navies of 
independent single worlds, the Imperium has an incredibly low (factor 
of 100 or more) naval strength in proportion to its population (based 
on my experience playing TCS).

I know we had a long-running thread about the pros and cons of deep 
meson gun sites a few years back, and I don\'t intend to resurrect that 
thread, BUT-- experience playing TCS has shown one not-so-minor defect 
of those "deep meson gun sites" that Impy planets are so fond of:  
they are shorter ranged than missiles.  A fleet can stand off and 
bombard your starport, industries, surface installations and troops 
out of existance without your meson guns being able to reach it.

I assume that the SDBs mentioned in FFW are more like Mora\'s 
multi-hundred thousand ton planetoid monitor than like those 200-ton 
fighters-on-steroids that are listed as SDBs in the various Traveller 
books.  I would be hard put to imagine that a world with Regina\'s yard
capacity and budget was restricted to 10 overgrown fighters, or that 
10 oversized fighters would pose a serious threat to an invading 
fleet.

This is a contradiction that has been around since Classic Traveller 
and never been explained.  Several places it has been explicitly 
stated (no, I don\'t have it in front of me now) that the Imperium 
does not allow multi-stellar member nations.  I believe it was 
mentioned in one of the Solomani supplements, to contrast it with the 
Solomani Confederation which was made up of multi-stellar member 
nations.  Yet, we have always had those Type 6 governments, some of 
which were described as having Imperial military governors (like 
Terra), most of which are described as colonies of some neighboring 
system. Go figure.

	Although I am not a "player" of Traveler, CT, etc,etc. I
am an advid READER of the fiction generated as a spinoff. Part of 
this is the rich backround data that supports the Traveler

	Recently, David Johnson, whoes work we have all enjoyed 
here sent me a copy of his group\'s publication, THE MELBOURNE 
TIMES. This publication is something like the old JTAS, with a 
multi-page "News Service" entry, great illustrations, and several
feature articles.
 	The News Service is based on Dave\'s "Earth Colonies" 
campaign, and is extreamly dense in information content. I read it
through the first time and found that I had to go back and re-read
it to get the maximum effect. THAT\'S how packed with info it was.
I finally sat down and began taking notes, it was that good! I got
Issue #3 as a sample, I do not know where this is in the "flow" 
of the zine, but it\'s News Service covered the period 1531.12 to 
0723.27 [0ct 22, 3001 to Nov 12, 3001].
	Also included in this issue was a "Sophont Brief" on a new
alien race I had not encountered before the MEREN. If they ARE 
familiar to you, then anything I could say would not due this 
article justice, and if they are new to you also, and if you\'re 
tired of aliens who are genetically altered cats and dogs .... or
humans ... then I urge you to pony up $1.50 for at least issue #3
of MELBOURNE TIMES. It\'s worth it even if allyou use is the 
Sophont Brief. But I\'m willing to bet you\'ll find a lot more of 
use in this, like:
	1 - Library Data. Short [1/2 page] but again close spaced
            8 point type, so there is a lot of data there.
	2 - Personafile - New NPCs for your campaign, this one,
            Benazir Chatterji would be suitable as a patron.
	3 - Worldscape/Starfield - although the physical genera- 
            tion of a system can be automated, the backround and 
            especially NAMEING everything is a pain in the...well
            you know what I mean!
	4 - And finally although it\'s not called the AMBER ZONE, 
            it is! An excellent adventure idea - utilizing dolphin
            characters.
All in all, MELBOURNE TIMES is well worth the $5.00 {$10.00 
overseas} that Dave and the guys want for their work. It\'s 21-24 
pages of hard data, NPCs and adventure ideas!

Today, generally the Rule of Three prevails.  Three combat platoons makes a
company, three combat companies make a battalion, etc.  There is no "Law of
War" that makes this a golden rule.  What is important is the span of control
of the commanders.  Of course that can change with technology.

Before you do the TOE of the Division you need to hypothesize how the Division
fights and what effect TL-15  would have on combat.  Suppose all of the
infantry would be TL-15 Battle Dress, Grav Belts and Fusion Rifles.  How are
they employed that is different from today\'s infantry units?  What kind of
logistical tail would this require.  What if they had battle dress but not grav
belts?  Do you need Grav Tank support?  Etc., etc., etc.

If want some basic info and/or help I have a good knowledge of US Army TOE and
some relivent background, 4 years in the 82nd Airborne Div and 8 in the Special
Forces.

>Remeber that Marines are probably often deployed as companies, and

>(A combat engineer squad?  I guess we could get carried away.)

A more effective method would be attached troops/units.  The Task Force concept
is used extensively by  the US Army to tailor make Co., Bn. and Bde. task
forces for specific missions.  Units are attched as needed to accopmlish
specific missions.

PS: Can a TL-15 4mm Guass rifle penetrate TL-15 Battle Dress?

I\'ve been watching this discussion for a while, and it has prompted me 
to post some of my own material on Sacnoth.  Regarding the above, I 
sifted through the description of the Sword Worlders in the Contact 
article, compared it to the apparent Imperial standards of behavior, 
compared the Imperial culture to 1980\'s American culture (the two are 
quite different), and concluded that Sword Worlders are probably a lot 
like conservative 1970\'s Americans.  By *IMPERIAL* standards, the 
SWers are `paternalistic, macho, vain, braggarts\'; by 1990 normal 
American standards, they *might* be mildly sexist and/or racist; by 
1990 American liberal standards, they\'re Republicans :-).  By 1970 
American standards, they\'re just plain folks.  

What follows is my campaign summary for Sacnoth:
 
Sacnoth is a very Earth-like world, one of the most Earth-like in the 
entire Spinward Marches.  It is slightly smaller than Earth, and the 
gravity is slightly lower (0.89 G).  There is slightly more than half 
as much water (49% of the surface area).  Its sun is somewhat brighter 
than Earth\'s - an F9 V. The temperature and climate is about the same, 
though there are more local climatic extremes due to more land and 
less water to buffer the climate than Earth has.  The atmosphere is 
standard O2-N2 mix, but polluted from Sacnoth\'s industries and cities.  
Fortunately, Sacnoth\'s medical and environmental technology keeps up 
with the resultant health problems.  It has a long day, 33.68 hours, 
and a long year (504 Sacnoth days, 708 Earth days).  The seasons are 
correspondingly long, and, in the early days of Sacnoth\'s settlement, 
the six months of winter resulted in a very high rate of clinical 
depression and suicide.  At the present time, this hazard is averted 
by light-enhancing interior design and customary use of 
stimulant-laden drinks during the winter.  (They drink lots of 
coffee-type drinks.)  Winter Melancholy is still a frequent 
affliction, but is almost instantly recognizable and easily treated.  

Sacnoth is inhabited by 8.91 billion people, the overwhelming majority 
of which are human (A very few Vargr, no Aslan, no minor races), 
mostly of Solomani descent.  There are some people of mixed 
Vilani-Solomani blood, but the cultural heritage is overwhelmingly 
Solomani Scandinavian-Germanic.  The major population centers are the 
megalopoli of Berkagerdi, Trettigard, Jordestad, Tyssestad, and 
Asarna, and various other, lesser cities (under 100 million).  The 
megalopoli are divided into city-sized administrative units called 
Cantons, ruled by a noble of at least Baronial rank.  There are two 
city-sized orbital habitats, Vemdalhavn and Eyrarhavn, and many 
smaller, factory-sized installations.  The shipyards of Berkagerdi and 
Vemdalhavn are capable of building up to 5000 ton starships, and a 
variety of non-starships.  

The current government of Sacnoth is a feudal monarchy (NOT a 
constitutional monarchy!); the current King is Harald VII.  He is the 
same monarch who ruled before the war, though certain of his advisors 
were ousted in the political re-alignment that resulted in the 
formation of the Border Worlds.  Sacnoth nobles traditionally have 
families late in life (age 75 to 125), and King Harald\'s heir, Prince 
Johann, was killed in naval combat during the war, so the question of 
succession is somewhat uncertain right now.  Current politics revolve 
around the succession question, and the very real resentment felt by a 
significant fraction of the population (esp.  the military) at 
"knuckling under" to the Imperium and "becoming an Impy puppet state".  
The military in particular feels betrayed by the government they 
served so loyally, much like the German Army after WWI.  

Transportation is uniformly gravitic; wheeled vehicles are quaint 
museum pieces from other worlds -- much like chariots in the real 
world.  Sacnoth builds very high quality grav vehicles (TL 13).  
Sacnoth medical technology is extremely advanced (TL 14); if there are 
any pieces of you left to put back together, they can probably fix 
you.  As a result, in addition to the standard crimes defined now, 
violence against another person falls into the categories of Assault, 
Lethal Assault, and Murder.  Murder is an Assault that results in 
permanent death, whereas Lethal Assault is an Assault that results in 
temporary death (dead, but resuscitated later).  

The standard of living is uniformly high, though there are always 
people who are less advantaged than others.  However, there are no 
"backward" parts of the world.  As is to be expected in a world of 
almost 9 billion people, laws and regulations affect most fields of 
endeavour, but are not particularly oppressive -- just annoying.  
Paper is another quaint historical curiousity, but entering data into 
administrative databases is still called "paperwork".  Sacnoth\'s 
industries are mostly automated, but household robots are unknown and 
the use of robots to replace anything besides dumb manual labor is 
virtually unknown.  However, all equipment more sophisticated than a 
broom is quite "smart" (think modern microwave oven, but voice 
controlled, for example).  

 
 A few noted products/brand names:
 
 Husqvarna - energy weapons, gauss weapons 
 Nibellung Gravitics - grav vehicles - Enclosed air/raft
 Tonsonig Metals - fissionables, industrial crystals, basic alloys 
   
  System Fleet - After FFW 

about 70% of Sacnoth\'s fleet was destroyed during the Fifth Frontier 
War.  What remains include 32,000 heavy fighters, approx.  600,000 
tons Jump-3 capable (avg 50,000 tons?, approx 12 hulls), 4.8 million 
tons Jump-2 capable, and 7.2 million tons Jump-1 capable (avg 5000 
tons, 2 biggest 30,000 tons, total approx 1440 hulls).

Baraka made it to the Galaxia Deluxe.  The air-lock took longer
than normal.  Baraka\'s fear of being trapped reached an all-time
peak, despite the apparently normal people sharing the air-lock
with him.  He had his hand in his pouch ready to draw his plastic
pistol when the inner doors started to open.  He thought he heard
a scream...
 
He started to draw his weapon, but realized it was nothing more
than bad bearings on one of the door motors.  Baraka sighed
deeply, and just stood there as the others left the air-lock for
the hotel\'s busy lobby.  Baraka poked his head out, looking first
to the left, then to the right.  The people looked normal enough.
 
With a slight smile on his bugeyed face, Baraka weaved his way to
the public vidcomms.  He slid his credcard into the slot and
keyed in a sequence.  The screen said "Calling James L. Tiberius.
Waiting for answer, please stand by..."  Baraka wondered why the
phone had no voice.  Still slightly paranoid, as he waited Baraka
glanced from individual to individual in the lobby to see if he
could spot any that were not quite normal.  He couldn\'t.
 
"Baraka, how many times have I told you never to call me here?"
The man on the screen was in his fifties, his face covered with 3
days growth of grey whiskers.
 
Startled, Baraka replied, "James, am I GLAD to see YOU.  My cover
is blown.  I\'m choking.  You\'ve got to help me!"
 
"I\'m retired, remember?  Call the precinct."
 
Baraka couldn\'t stand his friend\'s condescending tone, it almost
always frustrated him.  "There\'s something weird going on in that
neighborhood.  I\'d be a sitting duck in there."
 
"You and your paranoia.  You\'ll be fine."
 
Baraka started to raise his voice, but remembered where he was
and moved in closer to the mic instead.  "They\'re insane.  I
killed two of them."
 
"What the hell are you talking about?"
 
Baraka, looking quite serious now, stared into the vid-dot
sitting just above the phone\'s screen and lied through his teeth.
"Two of Eddy\'s boys came to get me.  I killed them both.  I had
to, or I was dead meat."  Well, at least it was partially true.
He was trying to follow Jorga Porshe\'s example -- don\'t tell the
truth if it will land you in the funny farm.
 
"Where are the bodies?  What did you do with the bodies?"
 
Baraka slapped his hand over the speaker, and leaned closer to
the mic, and whispered loudly, "Keep it down, would ya?  There
are people all around."
 
Jim said something, but he couldn\'t hear him.
 
Baraka wanted him to see the bodies, or at least what was left of
them.  He fantasized about being Jorga Porshe, suave, always with
the right plan, and the right thing to say.  "Physical evidence,"
he mumbled to himself, as his hand slid down off the speaker.
 
"What?"  Jim was obviously getting irritated.  "What evidence?
Where\'s the murder weapon?"
 
Baraka\'s mind began to wander.  *Baraaaaaaka*  *Baraaaaaaka*
 
"Baraka!"
 
He snapped out of it, glad to be free of the horrifying
flashback.  He started to puke, but was already emptied out.
 
Jim was convinced something was up.  "Where are the bodies?"
 
"In my apartment."
 
The ex-detective paused, then stated sternly.  "Baraka, I want
you to stay where you are.  I\'m going to call the precinct now.
Everything is going to be okay."
 
Baraka, looking quite pekid, shook his head slowly.  "You owe
me.  I need your help."
 
There was a long pause.
 
Years ago, when Detective Tiberius was undercover to bust up a
small exodrine smuggling operation, Baraka had saved his life.
Had James taken that drink, he wouldn\'t be alive today.  He
befriended Baraka after that, and swore that he would repay the
deed.  "If ever you need my help," he had said, "I\'ll be
there."
 
Jim took a deep breath.  "Alright, I\'ll see you at your apartment."
 
Baraka\'s eye\'s grew wide.  "No way!  I\'m not going back there."
 
"Meet me there in 1/2 an hour."  Bzzzt.  The screen went blank.
The words "Thankyou for using Telequick" appeared on the screen.
 
It was quite comfortable in the lobby, yet, despite his jumpsuit,
Baraka was shivering.  He didn\'t feel very good.
 
*Baraaaaaaka*

That depends a bit on how "airtight" you play the blockade.  If you play it as
airtight as GDW suggests (destroying every incoming ship), no one unless you don\'t plan to
return. Ever.  Ships are just too expensive to waste.  Including by the Regency Government!

If you play it as a reasonably tight custom blockade where your ship can be certified clean and
go on, then all sorts of speculative merchants will go to set up trade posts (outlets for medium tech goods), seek hi-tech facilities requiring few repairs, new (or fabled in old trade circulars) products.  (Examine Piers Anthony\'s old Polytechnic League/Nicolas van Rijn stories for a good inspriational feel).

The down and out will go looking to squat on a large "mostly free" chunk of real estate.

The missionarily inclined will go to rebuild down-trodden survivors (whether they want it or not :-).

The Gov\'t will sends Scouts and set up listening posts for its own knowledge and protection.
  

>What would the Regency government itself be doing about the wilds?

It would want to explore.  However, note the limitations set upon it by the expense of the 
blockade (in the next few messages, I have a discussion about the Regency Navy & RQS & such
rude things as budgets and taxes.)

>Except the background, that is.  
Beg to differ with you.  Such jumps are done in several places in GDW\'s own 
adventures.  In fact, the J5 route across the Great Rift includes more than one
such station.  Such jumps and deep space stations are PART of the background.

How do you get to the Islands Clusters without them?  (Must be, otherwise the
Islands would have been rediscovered by the 3I LONG before the 900s.  (See 
Trillion Credit Squadron for details.)

However, note that costs of operating a series of Deep Space stations increases
geometrically!  Assuming the cost of operating 1 station is 4 times as expensive
as operating an orbital port (probably more like 8, but 4 will do).  To operate the
second one, you need to do the same operation from the first!  Setting up that
second station into the depths is 16 (or 64 starting with 8) times as expensive to 
build and operate!  Note that regardless of whether they are used for commerical
purposes, building and maintaining something by anyone (including the military or by 
Vampires) has a cost in logistics and energy spent for that purpose.  That\'s the
cost I\'m discussing.  Governments cannot set these babies up deep into the Rift all
over the place.  This is also why the Vamps are unlikely to "flank" the Regency through
 the Rift - it requries to many resources to do.

Ah, you have hit upon another of the reasons why the Regency cannot really exist
given the Virus (and why I didn\'t buy TNE).  You\'re correct - they cannot maintain a perfect 
seal.  Actually, it\'s even worse
than you describe; see my upcoming discussions of the Regency\'s naval problems).
Nor can they defend against misjumps - given several hundred ships set to purposely
misjump, several could easily penetrate the Regency.  There should be several Trin\'s Veil
type occurrences if not a wholesale rampage.

However, the technologic capability has ALWAYS been available as part of the Traveller
milieu.

It does, of course depend on your circumstances.  GDW\'s adventures include cases
of smuggler bases, ancient\'s bases, and naval bases (The Darrians have a major 
naval base hidden in deep space) as well as a few commercial stations.  Note: 
The question was whether it could be done.  

My comments on COST are trying to point out that it rarely is, because it is quite
expensive.  The sole reason the Aslan sought for their route over the great Rift was that
(for the clan in question), the only other routes for expansion lead to Imperial and Solomani
space.

Even in CT & MT, any ship capable of more carrying more than 1 jump\'s worth of fuel can
make deep space jumps.   That\'s stated several places explicitly.

No?  Why not?  As described by GDW, various forms of the Virus are perfectly capable of
coordinating a fleet of several hundred vessels (networked over comm links) as easily as you move your hands and feet.  These include vessels of all shapes and sizes - including space tankers.  So, as Mr Virus, I pop a jump2 fleet to somewhere between two stars.  I refuel some vessels from teh tankers - including some of the tankers.  The tankers jump back to "vamp space" and refuel.  They come back to the fleet hole up point, and refuel more of teh fleet.

Some of the vamp fleet (fully loaded) leaps further into Regency space within teh dark between the stars.  Spare fuel is forwarded to only some ships.  The rest are told to wait.  Do this a fwe more times and some ships appear behind the Regency\'s wall and turn on their transmitters.  Uh oh!  For a more elaborate invasion, a tanker squadron makes a few leaps back and forth.  It takes time, but if the Regency doesn\'t ever patrol the dark between the stars, they will get their fannies wacked.

Unless I had something particularly valuable or time critical someone was paying extra for.

Uh, stored in a what? Computer memory or three?  In imperial military computers (sure in security sites, but networked).  Mr. Virus can find these too :-)

David Johnson says:

>I\'ve always considered that jump calculations use gravity wells as `targets\'.

That\'s not what various elements of the background material describe, though
I will grant they have some effect - try to jump too close to a grav well and you 
don\'t come out.  Jump drive is described as going from point A to point B through a medium (jumpspace) other than our space time continuum where the travel time is much shorter.  
There\'s nothing in the mechanics that gives you a bonus or minus 
for trying to get closer or further  from a grav well beyond.  I have to presume it doesn\'t
matter then.  If anything, since if you flub a navigation skill roll (In TNE), meaning you used 
less skill than required for success, you come out further away, I presume its easier to 
jump further from a star than close to the 100 diam limit.
  
All the targeting information for Navigation is based on your data bank.  Up to date
nav data includes information about the orbits and  locations of bodies in the star system. 
I\'d imagine that the first fella jumping into s star system comes in well away from the star 
and spends a while observing, so that the next fella will know where is permissable and 
not permissable to jump in.


But I\'ll grant that for t

>My fleet can probably all emerge in orbit

If your fleet tries jumping into orbit around system X\'s gas giant, odds are good
they ain\'t coming out. :-)
The problem is more likely one scale.  Consider interstellar distances.  Now, let\'s add extremely small perturbations in the EXACT attitude of your ship as it enters and travels through 
jumpspace.  Things like the speed able spacer Jock Strapp is jogging at while exercising in the ship\'s corridors, or the effect on the drive mount of engineer Kappappappappadan\'s boom box while he play Beethoven\'s 5th.  These have a small effect - enough to move the ship at most a couple hundred klicks - like the space generally occupied by a fleet while maneuvering!  Since these are not all known in advance (some haven\'t occurred; what if  engineer K switches to the
Beatles instead (ah, those longhaired Solomani...), they cannot be completely compensated for.  Of course your fleet disperses a bit during jump - it\'s safer than appearing interspersed or appearing close enough to risk collision in those first moments. 

>Jumps to deep space are difficult because there is no gravity well to serve
>as a target. 
But you don\'t target a gravity well!  Traveller does not include gravity detectors, and certainly not
ones that work at interstellar distances.  However, you are on to something...

> Even if I stage some sort of refueling post it will be

>massive than a star, gas giant or planet.  

I agree with the effect, but not the reasons,  Remember, gravity wells do
not affect the Navigation plot!  Certainly, a station of any size (smaller than those
purported to house 1 million or more, but something that size is prohibitively expensive for
a deep space station) will not produce enough of a gravity well to be noticed.
However, as I said before, due to the need to know exactly where gravity well generators are
(stars, planets, planetoids, etc), known systems are well mapped.  You can target to the
nth degree and appear (with luck) say anywhere within a 10,000 km bubble without much
effort because you have a vast body of data available to you, prompting you to accuracy.

In a jump to a deep space point, there are few such references.  So, instead of accuracy to
the .000001th degree, you may only be accurate to the .001th degree.  The coordinates are just
not that carefully defined in the navigation data until several hundred jumps have been made, the general jumpspace perturbations along the route have been documented, and any deep space bodies have been located and recorded.

To recap:

It can be done.  It is part of the canon that it has been done.  It will be done if the costs justifies it, but that probably won\'t be very often.

Hah!  Sure -- it\'s the best evidence we\'ve got for the Imperial Army 
structure questions.  (It\'s a different thread, but you did ask....)  :)

The counters in 5FW represent the Imperial forces that are space-mobile; 
in other words, planetary army formations are only represented where 
they have been "imperialized" and released to Imperial deployment.  
(Someone else can look at planets, if they want!)  What does the 
interstellar government have in the primary theater of operations?

* Huscarles: 
     One elite regiment, tech-15, heavy lift infantry, deployed into 
     its\' six battalions.  (4518th "Duke Regina\'s Own".)  Details of 
     composition are in _Spinward Marches Campaign_.  Originally 
     Imperial Marines.
             
* Marines: 
     Seven regiments, two of them elite, all tech-15.  
     
No other large forces loyal directly to the Imperium are elites.

* Regular Army:
     Eight field armies, six corps, eight divisions, four brigades, four
     regiments.  75% tech-15, 25% tech-14.  Regiments are mainly drop 
     troops.  Brigades are all lift infantry.
     
* Colonial Forces:
     RESERVES: Three field armies, six corps, five brigades, one 
        regiment.  TL 10 to 15, average 12 to 13. Larger formations tend 
        to better equipped.  The regiment is a tech-15 heavy lift 
        infantry unit, however!
     PLANETARY:  Two field armies, nine corps, two divisions, one 
        brigade, one battalion.  TL 8 to 13, average 10 to 11.   The 
        tech-8 unit is the Esalin Mechanized Infantry Division.  
        (Remember the "UN peacekeepers"?)  Both armies are from Porozlo 
        -- the only world represented twice!  Assumed to be 
        "imperialized" planetary forces since all here have planets 
        for identifiers.
    Again, all brigades are lift infantry.
    
* Mercenaries:  Yes, the Imperium has this nasty little habit....
     One division, one brigade, one regiment, seven battalions.
     TL 12 to 16, average 14.  Five of the battalions are elites,
     including the tech-16 unit. 

The marines are in first, easy to move to trouble spots, and are better
equipped and have higher morale, but most of the force is in the Army.
(Also note, because of this, the marines might get used more in 
"peacetime".  Remember too, the technological background of the Marches 
when considering the state of equipment in the regular and reserve 
forces.)

Yes -- at the corps or army level.  But for best effectiveness, expect 
to see the battalions to be a bit more specialized in their training.  
Think about what such a capability would require.

Usually deployed as regiments.  When the 4518th was given to Baron 
Regina, it was composed of two battalions of lift infantry, one of lift 
cavalry, and one of jump troops.  It probably still follows Marine 
doctrine.  There, some artillery is attached to the infantry/drop 
troops, some to regimental.  HQ also gets a fighter squadron and an 
_ortillery_ (planetary bombardment) squadron.  Organization seems
to follow the modern Western model closely.

Makes sense.  The _Kinunir_ is the closest thing that I can think of 
that\'s been seen, but it\'s just not adequate.

    'body' => 'Since it has been posed as a question, just how does one blockade
against the Virus?  What kind of fleet do you build?  Without getting
into the heavy specifics of weapons (I\'ll leave that to those more
talented, interested and experienced in ship design),  I\'ll discuss the
military issues faced by such a defensive blockade and the most economic
means of resolving such issues.

First, let\'s consider the problems imposed by Vampire ships:

1. Scope of task: You need to produce a complete blockade in systems at 
   least six parsecs deep all along the perimeter.  Based on the map in TNE,
   this is a line some 62 parsecs long in 1200.  Sorry that I don\'t have a 
   Deneb map, but assuming that the density of systems is the same as the
   Spinward Marches, that\'s some 70 systems total that the Regency needs to
   garrison.  This does not include systems that the Zhodani watch in    Chronor
   and Jewell.  Nor does it include anything on the Spinward edge of the 
   Regency - as if the Regency would not fear infection from any Virus ships
   having crept across the J5 route from Aslani space or through Zhodani 
   space having made the trip around the Windhorn.  Nor does it include
   naval forces arrayed against piracy or other external threats - like the
   Aslan ihatei from the Trojan Reach or the Zhodani Consulate.  

   Nor does it include guarding the dark between the stars.  Vessels must
   patrol these places, but bases in all the empty hexes is simply too 
   expensive.  
   
   Why must you guard 6 parsecs in depth?  To stop penetration by a J6       vessel.  Why must you patrol the empty parsecs?  Its too easy for a 
   squadron of vessels to piggyback fuel to deep space jumps and pierce
   the blockade. 

   The final threat, of course, cannot be effectievly guarded against:
   misjump.  Given a few hundred ships attenpting to misjump, a few will 
   pop in the middle of the Regency.  You know, those "safe" areas without
   excessive impediment to travel so life can pretend its still the 3rd
   Imperium.

   All it takes is one to get through and plant its eggs.

   Note: if you examine the maps in Survival Margin, the safe area of the
   Regency was a much smaller area that did not include the Deneb Sector! If 
   that map was accurate (why else would GDW print it? :-), the Regency        pulled out of areas too large for it to defend and left them to the         tender mercies of the Virus!  That must have been delightful PR for
   Norris\'s administration!)
   
2. Location: Given the enormity of space, with the only limit on entry into 
   a system being the 100-diameter limit, there is an awful lot of space 
   in any star system that a Vampire can appear in.  I\'m not that up on the
   technical end of MT, but from FF&S, you will need a fair number of

3. Identification:  Vampire ships can be of any class, from a 100-ton
   Scout vessel to a 1,000,000-ton battle rider (complete with Batron
   attached!).  They do not appear or act different than a human-run 
   ship.  Since TL8 computers can do decent voice synthesis, I\'ll
   assume higher TLs have no such problems.  So, how do you tell a
   Vampire (or worse yet in the beginning a mere Virus carrier) from
   an uninfected ship?  Every ship entering a system must be interrogated,  
   investigated, and determined if it is safe or not - and quickly.
   (in fact TNE says "the first thing a ship sees when it comes out of jump
   space in Regency space is a naval vessel").

4. Defense: Full defense is just about impossible.  Consider - at least 
   in the beginning of the "infection" period when the number of Vampires is
   thickest and defenses against infection are nil, a Vampire simply needs     to enter the system and broadcast (download) eggs to any number of
   computer-linked communications systems.  A 1000AU radio is the most 
   dangerous weapon aboard a Vampire - it can start broadcasting as soon
   as it arrives in system to any number of accidental listeners!     
   Certainly, it can begin broadcasting before it can be detected.

   (Ah, three cheers for Imperial standardization.  Mr Virus can easily
   enough write and quickly down load small programs to locate one of
   the few popular imperial comm systems, issue the (well-known) 
   commands to have the comm system point an ear up to the sky, and
   let out a "ready" peep.  While the inspector ships are still closing in 
   on the new ship, it is already down-loading itself to awaiting, open
   systems on the planet.)

   Defense must be prepared to destroy ANY and every ship that enters the
   system.  And any ship that may be in the system before it can leave in
   the event of infection.

Now, for the defenders, there are a few advantages:

1.  Most infected vessels are not military; they should be defeatable by
    light military forces.

2.  The effect of Viral infection is not immediate.  by the late 1130s, the
    Regency scientists should have figured out a bit about how the Virus
    works - enough to have figured out how to detect it dormant in a 
    computer system.  Shutting down the system and removing Mr. Virus at 
    that point may be annoying and inconvenient, but it will beat the hell 
    out of genocide and mass destruction!

3.  After the first ten years or so, the threat should thin out enormously
    as Vampires wear out and become non-functional.



Next, How do you defend a planetary system?

Given the Regency fleets I identified in msg 605/7586 let\'s look at how
these naval forces might be organized in TNE.

I propose, rather than organization based upon the sectors of the Imperial
era, that the Regency Navy will be organized along the `fronts\' of the
Regency: Zhodani, Vargr, Virus and Aslan *ihatei*.  This leads to the
following fleet organization (I\'m going to adopt Steve Charlton\'s
terminology):

The Spinward Fleet (4 groups, 250 ships)
212th Group (Jewell)             213th Group (Regina)
193rd Group (Vilis)              18th Group (Lanth)

The Coreward Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
214th Group (Aramis)             23rd Group (Rhylanor)
194th Group (Pretoria)           211th Group (Lamas)
195th Group (Sabine)             257th Group (Inar)

The Rimward Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
43rd Group (Lunion)              208th Group (Five Sisters)
100th Group (Glisten)            201st Group (Pax Rulin)
202nd Group (Gazulin)            203rd Group (Sindal)

The 1st Quarantine Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
151st Froup (Antra)              61st Group (Million)
125th Group (Dunmag)             88th Group (Atsah)
154th Group (Usani)              183rd Group (Geniishir)

The 2nd Quarantine Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
260th Group (Zeng)               55th Group (Kamlar)
184th Group (Vast Heavens)       204th Group (Tobia)
74th Group (Macon)               128th Group (Usher)

The Regent\'s Fleet (6 groups, 375 ships)
73rd Group (Mora)                207th Group (Trin\'s Veil)
196th Group (Star Lane)          258th Group (Vincennes)
193rd Group (Gulf)               19th Group (Vestus)

Subsector names merely reflect the Imperial era origins of the groups
and may or may not correspond to New Era designations.  (For example,
one might expect the 203rd Group to now patrol Regency worlds in District
268.)

Does anyone have any idea what the percentage breakdown might be for
battle, cruiser and assault (carrier) squadrons within a `typical\' group?

In the above organization one might expect the Spinward, Rimward and
Regent\'s Fleets to have a higher percentage of BatRons while the Coreward
and Quarantine Fleets would have more CruRons.  AssRons would probably
be concentrated in the Regent\'s Fleet.

Comments, critiques, suggestions and questions are welcomed and encouraged.

batteries bearing       8  8 1 6  Crew=395.

Low=137. Cargo=644. Fuel=18,500. EP=3500. Agility=5. Marines=150

Notes: All lasers are pulse lasers. Ship has frozen watch, fuel scoops, 
and purification plant.

This is the original design of the _Gorbachev_ class. 24 of these ships 
were built by the Naval Forces of Neubayern, all named for political 
leaders of twentieth-century Earth. This version of the class saw action 
against Amondiage and Sansterre during the Old Islands War, and against 
New Colchis during the Topas War. Following the Topas War, Alliance 
Supreme Commander Sir Isaac Connor described the class as being the 
"workhorse of the Alliance Fleet."

Following the war of 5627, the ships of the class underwent the Series A 
upgrade, which equipped the key ships of the NFN with Alliance technology.

BC-1 Series A BC-P6357H3-490300-(ND)000A-0 MCr42,370.9 50,000 tons
batteries bearing    8   12    4 Crew=370.
batteries      A   13    5 TL=12(14).
Low=510. Cargo=699. Fuel=18,500. EP=3500. Agility=5. Marines=650.

Notes: All lasers are beam lasers. Ship has frozen watch, scoops, plant. 
The refit cost MCr1,351.24 per ship, and took 14 weeks.

The Series A _Gorbachev_ was one of the first warships to incorporate the 
heavy laser technology developed by Sansterre. The letter-code bay 
weapons and highly efficient spinal mounts made possible by this 
improvement in laser technology gave Alliance ships a powerful punch at 
close range.

These refitted ships were also among the first to carry TL14 letter-code 
missile bays. The combination of a letter-code bay and nuclear missiles 
gave the _Gorbachev_, and latter Alliance ships, the ability to crack 
even the heaviest armour.

The Series A version of this battlecruiser saw action in the Serendip 
War. The entire class participated in the Second Battle of Neubayern, 
when the Serendip Belt tried to depopulate Neubayern, and five of them 
were lost or damaged beyond repair.

The surviving 19 ships were among those which fled to Home and Sansterre 
during the Imperial occupation, where they underwent the Series B refit 
which incorporated the tremendous advances the Alliance had made in 
weapons and propulsion.

This covers the "history" of the _Gorbachev_ class. I\'ve got plans to 
write up the "current" status of the class (along with the Series B 
version) in the world of the Islands Cluster, but make no promises as to 
when this will be...

I\'ll post other NFN designs from the Alliance in days to come, unless of 
course you don\'t want me to. :-)

I have been following the earth colonies discussion.  I think its a great 
idea but you dont need me to tell you so.  I once ran a camp with 
quasi traveller rules (before I had ever seen traveller...I used 
champions hybrid rules) based upon an extensive system of earth colonized 
worlds (100+).  I just joined TML a couple o weeks ago and have some 
questions regarding the Earth Colonies.

Questions-What is the status(if any) of Extraterrestrial Humans or non 
Human sentients?

Could someone post a five point (or more at one line per point) synopsis 
of the Earth Colonies background.  I mean fundamental things.  I can get 
details (historical, political,etc) from the discussions and submissions. 

I would love to join this discussion.  Even if youre only using Terrans, 
there is enough variety in Terran culture to more than satisfy a

Agreed.  The Sword World fleets (two of which were in _5FW_) seemed
similarly small, but I forget the figures offhand.

About the multi-world governments in the old Imperium: they weren\'t
_quite_ illegal.  Worlds were allowed to sponsor colonies on nearby
worlds, to get them going.  A small amount of internal conflict was
allowed, but the second things looked like they might get out of 
hand, the Navy and Marines were called in.  Some cultural regions
had close pre-Imperial ties, but were usually forced to officially
act through the Imperial bureaucracy at the multi-world level.  It\'s
possible that some exceptions were allowed where it served the 
government\'s interests.  For instance, the Vegans were given that
huge autonomous region near Sol to counterbalance the Solomani
Confederation.  They were even allowed to maintain an internal 
navy under their control at TL14+, many ships of which were retired
second-rate Imperial vessels, which admittedly often had the most
powerful weapons downgraded.  So it\'s possible the Imperium did 
this very occasionally on a smaller scale -- but they kept a real
close watch on them.  They probably didn\'t have too much trouble.

After all, the Imperium was pretty good at object lessons.  What
they did to Ilelish during the early years is an example.  I\'m
sure that when the Solomani lost Earth, quite a few people breathed
a sigh of relief that the Imperium didn\'t dare to put the Terran
tropical regions to the nuclear sword, even after an evac.

Yeah, I killed the Emperor in one pre-MT campaign, too.  A friend
of mine had just gotten the GDW Zhodani, and I read it cover to
cover and was inspired.  This was the high-power campaign with a
PC playing the "Duke of Egyrn", so I appointed him special ambassador
to Zhodane with instructions to discuss the "Pa\'an Question" which
was unresolved after the 5FW.  (He started out as an IISS Imperial
Warrant psionic agent, and worked his way up the noble ladder over   
the course of the campaign, so he was a vehemently anti-Zho psi,
which threw another wrench into the works.)

Essentially, over the course of negotiations, he and his retinue
got to know the Zhodani, and slowly began to "go native".  Then
the news of Strephon\'s assassination reached Zhodane.  When it
became clear that the Zhodani were more interested in the Core
Expedition (which he had known nothing about, of course) than
the attack on the Marches he expected, he became very confused. 

A replacement arrived to discuss the new situation, and he was   
recalled.  The Imperium collapsed into a Second Civil War, the
Marches dominated by a "Regina Free State" around Norris.  So 
he ended up working to stabilize the area behind the claw....
As I recall, Strephon was killed circa 1117 or 1118, so the
Zhodani found out circa 1118-1120.  It\'s been a while.

The bizarre thing is, I didn\'t really _plan_ any of these new
developments in advance, they just sort of *happened* as I went
along, because they seemed to fit the plot so well.

I knew the scenario had worked because afterward, the PC playing
the Duke came up to me and said, "God, Steve, you\'ve not only got 
me *liking* the Zhodani, I might want to ally with them!  The Zho 
are either *incredible* propogandists, or I\'ve lost my mind!" :)
Best campaign I ever ran.  High power campaigns can be fun!

Not at TL 15 (or 18 for that matter) to detect more than the presence of
the star.  It has nothing to do with TL and everything to do with signal
differentiation.  At those distances, all you\'d receive is light sent from a 
point source.  All signals from that system would appear as the same signal.


>If this is so, how do I explore new territory?

That\'s easy:  pick coordinates well beyond the 100 diam limit of the star (1000
is a good choice).  Odds are very good that you won\'t bump into the gravity
well of a planet.  Head slowly toward (take a month or two) the star and 
examine it to determine the system\'s ecliptic plane.  Then examine the 
ecliptic plane for planets. As you drift in, you will get more data and figure
out the orbits of the planets.

That\'s part of what the ISS used to do.  No one said all Scout Service work
was exciting.

Next time, someone can use your data to determine where in orbit the planets
will be, and where is a safe jump point.

Hey! I just got an idea for system defense!  Build LARGE artificial grav
generators.  Something Bship sized should be able to generate a large moon-sized
G well.  In war, you can move a few around your system around the 100 diam 
limit of your mainworld and disrupt those coming in - except your folks who 
you can tell where these items and their masses are placed.

I vented once, and only once.  I feel no need to do so again.

Someone give Jeff Davis Loren\'s address or GDW_Support\'s address and let

My apologies to Jeff Davis who is probably quite nice and is quite welcome

Unfortunately, this question will continue to be asked - and answered with
equal vehemence on both sides.

And for the record, I did not buy and will not buy TNE because I don\'t like
the changes made to the setting. I believe the leap to TNE was made because
GDW had two purposes:  1. They wanted to upgrade the rule set to their set of
House Rules (used with TW:2000, cadillacs & dinos, & Dark Conspiracy)
2.  They wrote themselves into a corner with the Rebellion and wanted a fresh
start.  Some folks like it, and others do not.

Not meaning any disrespect but would that make them Latter Day
Travellers?  BTW has anyone else noticed the recent news release from
Iran.  Their High Ayatollah has decreed that it is sacrilege for muslims
to watch TV via sattelite.


SPLITTING GROUP

I am not in favor of splitting the group.  I have CT, Mt. & TNE and have
played all incarnations starting w. CT in the eqarly \'80s.  I enjoy
reading the thought\'s others have regarding all types of Traveller as
well as both official and individual campaigns.  The use of identifying
headers seems a brilliant idea.  If you don\'t play the game, ignore the
message and why flame the other system when the bandwidth could be
better used to crow about the system you\'re fond of using.


DEEP SPACE STATIONS: (in a Steve Urquel voice) "Did I do that?"  At
least I think I mentioned something about them that started this round
of discussion.  IMHO DSS\'s can make economic sense given the right set
of circumstances (distances of systems and the political/economic
situation of those systems) as well as military sense.

I can not remember (in CT, MT, or TNE) anything from GDW indicating the
mechanics of how a ship navigates (astrogates for us Latter Day
Travellers) through jump space.  I can think of three methods:

1) A vector (distance & direction) is always directly related to
jumpspace navigation; if I wish to jump two parsecs 270 degrees from my
current forward position the parameters necessary to achieve that can be
directly calculated.

2) Jumps are made toward gravity sinks.  When I start to enter jump
space the ship is attracted to gravity nodes - the navigator allocates
the proper amount of enery to drop out of jumpspace outside 100
diameters to avoid merging with heavenly bodies.  Or as Han Solo put it,
"It\'s no mean trick.  Be nice if we rushed it and passed right through a
star or some other friendly spatial phenom like a black hole.  That
would end our trip real quick."

3) Jumps might be calculated toward objects emitting sufficient
radiation (for a sufficiently long enough time - at least a dozen years
or more) to be detected by starship sensors and used to lock in a
course.  Obviously a DSS would not emit enough radiation nor would it be
in existence for a long enough period of time if it did.

Looking at the "official" evidence either methods 2 or 3 seem to be the
correct method, probably 2 since gravitational fields are specified as
being involved in the procedure (one must be at a sufficient distance to
avoid having gravity interfere with the jumpdrive.

As was pointed out during the 5FW neither side made use of DSS\'s and
while the 3I & Zhos may be a lot of things neither group would be likely
to pass up any advantage, no matter how risky.

Thank you David Johnson for the kind comments.  You are quite correct
regarding dispatching jump drones.  Initially the procedure was to await
the outcome of hostile actions before launching drones but after the
Rape of Trin RQS Expedition Leader David Johnson brought this matter to
the attention of the RQS command which swiftly altered the procedures to
launch drones if a ship enters within 100 diameters of a fuel source
without acknowledging commo contact or as soon as hostile actions break
out.  Possibly this minor procedural fauz pas is responsible for the
Virus penetration to Trin but if so it has never been made known to the
public.


bonnevil@mermaid.micro.umn.edu (Steven M Bonneville) points out
correctly that the RQS also patrols the Zho & other spinward borders.
This is true but the RQS only maintains light assets (mostly inspection
launches) for inspections while the Navy maintains a strong presence in
these areas.  Naval ships are called upon to enforce the Quarantine
procedures should firepower be required.


L\'oeul d\'Dieu/Spinward Marches (3010 B98A510-B)
  While not a major world this system became the Patrol\'s base of ops in
275-1120 and thereby deserves some attention.  When Norris established
the Quarantine (312-1130) the Patrol was combined with part of the
Regency Interstellar Scout Service (Exploration and External Mapping
branches) to form the Regency Quarantine Service (RQS).  The base then
became an important asset of the RQS.

I think we\'re all on similar wavelengths regarding deep-space jumps,
although we all have taken different approaches to the seemingly
conflicting data about them.

I think we\'re agreed on the following "facts":

o Deep-Space Jumps ARE allowed
o Deep-Space refueling stations DO exist
o Deep-Space refueling stations ARE NOT extremely common
o Large distances (eg: Great Rift) DO present an obstacle to travel
o Blockades (eg: Regency) ARE possible
o Stellar and planetary bodies DO affect jump (eg: 100 diameter limit)

If anyone else has any facts to add, please do.  But take note, I
have avoided using obscure references as well as many not-so-obscure
rules references so that I can generalize.

To me, a natural conclusion from all of these facts is that jumps to
deep space are somehow very difficult and/or risky.  This is not the
only conclusion at which you could arrive, but it makes sense to me.

Another suggestion has been that it is simply too expensive to use
multiple jumps (for traders) or to set up deep-space refueling
stations (for the military).  I don\'t think this reconciles all of
the facts, for reasons I\'ve already stated.

====================

I am now done talking about the effects of the background, game
mechanics, etc.  The rest of this is merely a suggestion, which
doesn\'t come from the rule book, so don\'t start quoting me page
numbers from books I probably don\'t have. :-)  I\'d better give
that a few more smileys: :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)

====================

My interpretation has been that gravity plays an integral part in
jumps, such that it is difficult to jump to interstellar space.
I am now inclined to revise this interpretation so that gravity
wells are REQUIRED as destinations of any jump.

There is plenty of interstellar dark matter, so deep-space jumps
would still be possible, although the difficulty of finding such
matter may change throughout the galaxy (eg: there might be less
in the Great Rift, and the Regency might have cleared it out at
the border).  Also, interpretations of how much matter is needed
may vary (eg: do you need something the size of a comet? will a
dust cloud do?).  These two things would affect whether deep-space
jump points are common or are well-guarded secrets at different
places in the galaxy.

This also helps me justify the way mis-jumps work.  I avoided
mentioning this earlier, since it opens up a whole new can of
worms (intentional mis-jumps: JUST SAY NO! :-) :-) :-).

In general, I disagree based upon the Imperial naval tradition discussed
in the *Spinward Marches Campaign*.  It is important to maintain the
tradition of a military unit so I doubt *any* unit would be disbanded
unless it had suffered a *particularly* stunning defeat.  The units
fighting the Aslan *ihatei* most probably were not *destroyed* in a pitched
battle but rather fought a series of engagements from which they were
forced to withdraw.  A similar situation would have occurred on the Vargr
front.

With this in mind I would expect *all* of the fleets to have survived in
some form or another.  This would permit them to be reinforced and rebuilt
by the New Era.  Recall that I mentioned the subesctor associations merely
to indicate the Rebellion-era origins of the fleets.

On another note, this entire issue of Aslan *ihatei*, Vargr and Virus
incursions into the Regency and subsequent borders must be resolved.  I\'ll
try to start that effort in another post.

It\'s my belief (desire?) that many of the *ihatei* have been incorporated
into the Regency in those former regions of the Domain that were occupied/
settled during the Rebellion era.

Remember, I\'m the guy who never bought the idea of Vargr incursions into
the Regency in the first place.  It\'s my view that a clever Regent ought
to have been able to keep the Vargr at bay by fostering their inherent 
instability.  (Some folks have claimed this policy would facilitate the
spread of Virus in the Extents.)  In any event, I would expect the Regency
to have reclaimed any territory lost to the Vargr during the Rebelion era
by TNE.

With the *rapproachment* between the Zhodani and the Regency during TNE I
would expect the Sword Worlds to be much less of a threat without the
support of their Zhodani patrons.  (Much like Cuba now.)

The relationship between the Rebellion-era Patrol, the Quarantine Service
and the Regency Navy is one still to be discerned.  Wasn\'t the Patrol
originally staffed by Aslan?  This is why I felt many of the *ihatei* have
been incorporated into the Regency.  Does any TNE material mention the
fate of the Patrol in TNE?

The three Reft fleets on the spinward side of the Great Rift are clearly
safe from any sort of claim by Dulinor.  Their challenge was the *ihatei*
as well.

Thanks.  Yours too.

Well, on a whim I\'ve reidentified it as the 211th Group which at least doesn\'t
conflict with any Regency units.

These are very important issues for our Regency sourcebook project *Shall
Not Perish*.  These problems with borders in the Domain/Regency actually
pre-date the Rebellion era discrepancies noted above.  (You\'ll recall my
questions about the discrepancies in the Border Worlds in Sword Worlds
subsector after the 5FW.)

What I\'d like to do is to try to identify *all* `official\' maps of the Domain
of Deneb (Spinward Marches, Deneb Sector, Trojan Reach and Reft Sector) that
either show borders of world allegiance codes from *Supplement 3: Spinward
Marches* to whatever has appeared for the Regency in TNE.  This would include
everything - like the map of Pax Rulin subsector in *Leviathan*.  I\'d like
to identify the source of the map, the `real\' date it was published, and
it\'s supposed date in the campaign.  (And please, let\'s try to be more
specific than just `Rebellion-era\'.)

I\'ll examine whatever maps I have over the weekend.  Rodge and Ed, will you
give us the appropriate sources of the citations you used above?  Anyone
else, please contribute as you can.

In addition to identifying sources, we need to start to get a handle on the
discrepancies.  If possible, when you post your sources, please try to
identify as many discrepancies as possible.  Give world name and hex location
and whatever border/alignment discrepancy exists.

I\'ll serve a coordinator of this effort.  It shouldn\'t take but a few days
if enough folks participate.  Once we\'ve gathered all the data I\'ll post
a summary and then we\'ll try to resolve the discrepancies for *Shall Not
Perish*.

Let\'s get busy!

     Y=35, Z=50
Notes: This ship has a frozen watch, fuel scoops, and purification plant.

This is the original version of the _Excelsior_ class. The NFN built 15 
of these ships, most of them named for historical battleships. The 
exception was the lead ship, which was named for a fictitious ship class 
from Star Trek. This version of the ship saw action during the Old 
Islands War and the Topas War--following the Topas War, FAdm Connor 
described it as "the best battleship in the Islands."

This class also received the Series A refit immediately after the wars.

BB-1 Series A BB-R6357H4-590307-00R09-0 MCr86,286.3 100,000 tons

     Y=35, Z=50
Notes: This ship has frozen watch, scoops, plant. The refit cost 
MCr1,887.6 per ship and took 15 weeks.

The Series A _Excelsior_ wasn\'t a major improvement over the original 
version. The Admiralty felt that upgrading the battleships further would 
delay improvements on other ships unacceptably, so the upgrade was 
postponed.

The battleship _Musashi_ was officially handed over to the Alliance Navy 
in 5629, and served as the flagship of the Alliance for several years. 
The Series A version of the battleship saw action in the Serendip War. 13 
of the ships participated in the defence of Neubayern, and two of them 
were lost or damage beyond repair.

The 13 surviving _Excelsiors_ fled to the safe worlds when the Imperials 
arrived. During the Occupation, the ship received a major refit, 
effectively becoming a new class of ships.

Okay, here\'s my first take on a map.  Y\'all can use this as a guide for
reporting on your own maps.

Source: *Spinward Marches Campaign* sourcebook
Published: c1985
Game date: c1111

This sourcebook contains two maps of the Spinward Marches: one inside the
front cover (8.5 x 11) and one centerfold (11 x 17) that are essentially
identical.  The borders show every world in Regina, Aramis, Lanth, Rhylanor,
Lunion, Mora, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil as within the Imperium.  Imperial
borders in Jewell, Vilis and Five Sisters are `consistent\' with previously
published works.  Although they conflict with the UWP data that appears
in this sourcebook, the maps do not show the Border Worlds in Sword Worlds
subsector but rather show the united Sword Worlds like previous maps.  Two
worlds in District 268, Mertactor 1537 and Mille Falcs 1637, are shown as
part of the Imperium which matches the UWP data.

The sourcebook includes UWP data for all worlds in the sector.  This data
shows alignment codes for the Border Worlds for the following worlds in
Sword Worlds subsector:

1424 Beater (mentioned as capital of the Border Worlds in text on P17)
1522 Dyrnwyn
1523 Durendal
1524 Hofud
1525 Sting (mentioned as capital of the Border Worlds in text on P19)
1526 Steel
1626 Iron
1627 Bronze
1628 Mithril

Separate text also mentions that there are ten Border Worlds which is
consistent with this list.

Clearly, this source contradicts itself but other than the confusion about
the Border Worlds capital this might be explained by the use of an earlier
map here.

Because there has been some mention of Regency expansion into District 268
in TNE I\'ve included the following list of worlds there shown in the UWP
data as `Client States\', presumably of the Imperium.

1132 Bowman
1138 Tarsus
1232 Walston
1237 Collace
1238 Pavabid
1337 Judice
1340 Motmos
1434 Tarkine
1435 Dallia
1532 Elixabeth
1631 Talchek
1632 Milagro

That covers this source.  Let\'s see the rest of them!

Welcome to the Sword Worlds Development League, Cynthia!  Thanks a bunch
for some really great stuff on Sacnoth.  We\'ve only got 22 more worlds
to go.

This may be what you\'ve said but I just want to get clear that the *JTAS*
Contact piece says very specifically that this Teutonic heritage is
merely `cultural\' and that the Sword Worlds enjoy the full range of
Solomani *ethnic* diversity.

So your work represents the post-5FW era.  Have you brought Sacnoth up
to TNE?  Where do you stand on the capital of the Sword Worlds in TNE?
Does Sacnoth have a chance?  :-)

Is this *TCS* information?  Didn\'t you say somewhere else (maybe you didn\'t,
I can\'t find it now) that Sacnoth\'s shipyard could only build 5000-ton ships?
If so, where do the larger ships mentioned above get built?
  
Some great work.  And once again, welcome to the `club\'.  :-)

> Could someone post a five point (or more at one line per point) synopsis

Okay, here goes (but no promises of brevity):

Who: The Commonwealth of Earth, an interstellar state headed by Earth.
  Several interstellar entities known as Colonial States headed by worlds
  originally settled in a sub-light diaspora from Earth that began in the
  24th Century AD.  Major Colonial States are:
    Empire of Aztlan
    Abrahamic Synod
    Federation of Nyanza
    Ouroran Community
  Several other minor Colonial States exist.
  A basic premise is that Humans have finally `recognized\' Dolphin
  intelligence and most of these Terran states enjoy integrated Dolphin-
  Human societies.
  The two spacefaring extraterrestrial sophont species that have been
  encountered: the Aeroi and the Meren.
What: The Commonwealth of Earth, the major Colonial States and the Aeroi
  and Meren are at TL 13.  Minor Colonial States exist a one or two tech
  levels below this.  Many independent worlds and mini-states exist at
  a variety of tech levels.
  The motivation for the 24th Century diaspora was a severe ecological
  catastrophe.  Coping with this catastrophe on Earth provided time for
  the Colonial States to establish themselves as major interstellar
  players.
  The Earth Colonies campaign uses a 3D campaign area based upon the
  `real\' system locations from the 2300AD "Near Star List".
Where: the Colonies Sphere a 30 parsec *sphere* centered on Earth that
  represents the extent of exploration by the Commonwealth Scout Service.
  Other Colonial States have ventured beyond this region.  Both the Aeroi
  and the Meren originate from beyond the Sphere.  (Also known as the
  Earth Colonies sector.)
When: The dawn of the 31st Century AD.

> I would love to join this discussion.

Jump right in!  Keep in mind though that development of the Earth Colonies
campaign is handled by the Earth Colonies Development League (ECDL) off-
line through the newsletter *Melbourne Times*.

Keep in mind that the Earth of the Earth Colonies is not the same as the
Terra of the Solomani.  The Earth Colonies campaign is a completely original
campaign background.

Okay, let\'s look at the Sword Worlds Navy again.  I know these rules are
for individual worlds but let\'s try looking at the Sword Worlds as a whole
first.  Let\'s assume a `subsector government\' of 5 (feudal technocracy).
The Sword Worlds population (c1120) is approximately 30 billion.  These
parameters give:

Budget: cr500 x .95 x 30,000,000,000 = 14,240 Gcr
Capacity: (30,000,000,000 x .95)/1000 = 28.5 Mt

Now I don\'t have much idea how to convert this to ships and squadrons but
just using the tonnage figure and an estimate of 50,000 tons per `capital\'
ship gives 570 ships!  No wonder the Imperium hasn\'t conducted a pacification
campaign against the Sword Worlds!

Either you *TCS* wonks have to help me out here or we need to begin to
accept that the *TCS* rules just aren\'t compatible with the naval forces
that appeared in *5FW*.  (And start arguing about which to throw out?  :-)

    'body' => 'Subject: *Shall Not Perish* - RICE Papers

I\'ve been watching the growing information about the "Regency
Sourcebook" (Working title, which I _like_, "Shall Not Perish") and 
decided to explore some aspects of the Regency that were never 
really explored even when the Third Imperium Chamber of Commerce 
published little black books.  The occasional Contact article in 
JTAS was good, but insufficient.  So, I decided to pursue the 
_cultural_ aspects of the Regency.  What my research revealed is 
introduced in the following document, RICE Paper #0000.
- ----
RICE Paper #0: Introduction


1.  What is RICE?

RICE, the Regency Institute for Cultural Education, is a
non-governmental organization dedicated to increasing the level
of knowledge and understanding of the various cultures that the
traveller may encounter within the Regency and in its immediate
neighbor stellar states.  This mission is carried out through
our efforts to keep the Regency Library Data network as
up-to-date as possible, and our distribution of information
directly to travellers on request, through such publications as
this series of RICE Papers, and our representatives at traveller
assistance centers, including, but not limited to, facilities
operated by the Travellers\' Aid Society.  We are funded by a
combination of tourism corporations, the Travellers\' Aid Society
and similar extra-Regency organizations, and private donations.


2.  The History of RICE.

When the borders of the Domain of Deneb were sealed late in
1129, the resulting panic caused an upsurge in isolationism, and
a general decrease in economic activity on the interstellar
level.  The Domain government, in an effort to prevent the
fragmentation of the Domain, instituted massive efforts to
promote interstellar tourism and commerce, and to publicize the
successful efforts of the Patrol (later the Regency Quarantine
Service) in preventing the infiltration of Virus into the
Domain.  One of these efforts was the Deneb Cultural Exchange
(DCE), which had much the same mission as RICE today.  However,
as a governmental agency, the information available was limited
to that which the various worlds of the Domain chose to make
available.  Simultaneously, the Travellers\' Aid Society created
the parallel Deneb Travellers\' Exchange (DTE), which made an
effort to get accurate information from field researchers, but
which was drastically underfunded, due to a dropoff in the level
of utilization of TAS facilities.  In 1145, after the
liberalization of the Domain government, and the subsequent
reorganization into the Regency, and rapprochement with the
Zhodani, Vargr, and Aslan, the DCE was privatized and operated
by a consortium of megacorporate tourism subsidiaries.  Shortly
thereafter, an agreement with the Travellers\' Aid Society
allowed the DCE and the DTE to share information and facilities.
In 1160, the arrangement was formalized, and RICE was created.
Now, we have been asked by various planetary and interstellar
governments to expand our target audience, from those who have
already decided that travelling is what they\'d like to do, to
the general public.  Thus, the RICE Papers, of which this is the
first.


3.  What Are the RICE Papers?

The RICE Papers were originally conceived of as a set of
pamphlets focussing on a single aspect of a culture that a
traveller should be aware of.  When we submitted several drafts
to various governments, we were advised that our original format
was indeed useful, but that we should also provide broad
overviews of the various planetary cultures, preferably in a
format that could give the reader an idea of what would
typically be encountered in the course of a visit to the culture
in question.  Thus, there will be two series of RICE Papers.
Numbered RICE Papers will provide the broad overview, while
lettered RICE Papers will cover one specific topic in somewhat
greater depth.  The lettered RICE Papers are actually associated
with a particular numbered RICE Paper, and the letter will be
prefixed by the number of the corresponding numbered RICE
Paper.  Thus, if RICE Paper #1643 is on the planet Ruie, then a
RICE Paper focussing specifically on the legal system on Ruie
might be RICE Paper #1643-A, and a RICE Paper focussing on local
cuisine might be RICE Paper #1643-B.


4.  How Do I Read a RICE Paper?

RICE Papers are mostly ordinary text narratives.  However, as a
convenience, we are also providing extended UWP data, in a
DGP-based format.  These should be interpreted as described
in Appendix A to this RICE Paper, and the text considered in
that light.  At the end of this document, we have appended a
sample extended UWP, with brief annotations.  Also, be aware
that information provided by a RICE Paper is correct according
to the best information available to us at the time of
publication.  Governments change, and information may be
misinterpreted by our field researchers.  It is recommended that
you verify any information that you feel may affect you both
before embarking on your trip, and before leaving the starport
extraterritoriality zone on your destination world.  While we
encourage people to leave the extraterritoriality zone and
immerse themselves in the local culture, we recognize that under
some circumstances it may be inadvisable to do so, and
acknowledge that one can get a taste of the local culture, and
have an enjoyable trip, without leaving the zone.


5.  How Do I Get the RICE Papers?

RICE Papers are placed on the Library Data network as they are
ready, and copies of the text can be retrieved from the network
databases as required.  There are future plans for making
hardcopy available, but these plans have not been finalized yet.


6.  When Will the RICE Paper for <insert chosen planet here> Be
    Available?

In order to get the highest quality reports from the field, we
have chosen not to require that a particular planet be done at a
particular time.  We do record requests, and, when demand
warrants, add requested planets to a list of the "Ten Most
Desired Destinations" distributed to all RICE Liaison Offices.
As field researchers choose to go to one of these planets, they
are removed from this list.  However, we do not require that a
researcher choose a planet from this list, and in fact, many of
our researchers will deliberately avoid any planet on the list,
preferring to search out that one particular undiscovered gem
that is well off the major trade routes.  We believe, as
indicated, that we will get better reports from this policy, and
that this will better serve those who are looking for a pleasant
and interesting trip.

         number of planetoid belts (exclusive of the main
         world, if it is a belt), number of gas giants,
         allegiance, and the standard Hertzsprung-Russel
         stellar classifications for each star in the system.
         Use the standard interpretations for these figures.

Line 3:  Surface gravity, in standard g, followed by local day
         in hours:minutes:seconds, and local year in standard
         days, hours:minutes:seconds/local days,
         hours:minutes:seconds.  Normally, starships will
         gradually adjust their internal gravity and light/dark
         cycles to match the destination planet.  However, some
         people require more than the week of jump travel to
         adjust.  This information is provided to allow
         travellers to begin the adjustment process before
         embarking.

Line 4:  Atmospheric density in standard pressures, weather is
         either "natural" or "controlled"  This information is
         provided to allow adjustment prior and during travel.
         Note that atmospheric density significantly different
         from that which a traveller is used to may require the
         traveller to use assisted breathing apparatus.

Line 5:  Basic temperature, degrees Celsius, 35 degrees
         latitude, followed by the range in basic temperatures,
         expressed as (degrees per ~8 degrees latitude, followed
         by equatorial temp to polar temp), followed by the
         maximum change in temperature in the polar regions
         (maximum summer increase to maximum winter decrease,
         followed by latitude where seasonal temperature changes
         become noticeable).  Use this information and that in
         the next line when selecting clothes to pack.  On most
         worlds of technical level 8 or higher, indoor
         temperature is normally controlled to be within the
         range of 10 to 20 degrees.

Line 6:  The size of the daily variation in temperature.  This
         is the difference between the high and low for the day.

Line 7:  Classifications of products widely available for
         export.  These are listed in the order natural
         products; processed products; manufactured products;
         information.  Within a classification, products are
         separated by commas.  These are GENERAL CLASSES ONLY,
         representing the kinds of goods that the planet excels
         in producing, causing an export market.  Consult trade
         representatives to determine the availability and
         market for specific products.

Line 8:  Social classification.  There are three entries for
         this line.  First is progressiveness indicators,
         attitude/activity, then the aggressiveness indicators,
         attitude/activity, then the extensiveness indicators,
         global/interstellar.

Line 9:  The legal and technical profiles.  The legal profile
         consists of six entries, in the following order:
         overall law level, representing the likelihood of the
         traveller being required to experience one or more
         portions of the legal process; weapons law level,
         representing the restrictions on type, availability,
         and "carryability" of personal weapons by individuals
         not part of the planetary law enforcement agencies;
         trade law level, representing the level of restrictions
         placed on the exchange of property; commercial law
         level, representing the level of restrictions on doing
         business in general, including labor laws, zoning,
         permits, and so on; civil law level, representing the
         level of enforcement of restrictions on personal
         activity, and personal freedom level, representing the
         types and severity of restrictions on personal
         activity.  The technical profile consists of 14 entries, 
         as follows:  First, the range (high and low) of technology 
         commonly available on the planet.  Next, the technology 
         levels for Quality of Life: Energy production, computers 
         and robotics, Communications, Medicine, and Environment.  
         Next, the technology levels for transportation: Land, 
         Water, Air, and In-System Space.  Next, the _acknowledged_ 
         level of common military technology: personal and heavy, 
         and finally, the novelty tech level.  Items can be found 
         of the novelty tech level, but, as the name implies, they 
         are novelties, and not to be expected to be generally 
         available.  They are typically demonstration or 
         experimental models, or imported.

We believe that this is the minimum set of information needed to
alert the traveller to any general conditions that he needs to
be aware of.  Following this extended profile will be the text
of the RICE Paper, calling out the general characteristics of
the culture, and any noteworthy conditions or habits that can
help the traveller to understand the culture better, or to avoid
making mistakes that will insult the local population or involve
the traveller in legal action.

I\'m open to comments and questions on RICE Papers, and suggestions 
as to which planets to tackle.  At this point, I am using as a 
baseline the MegaTraveller UWP for the Spinward Marches, except for 
Regina Subsector (from TNE), and as I find MT-era or later docs for 
other sectors/subsectors of any of the Spinward States, I\'ll use 
them as baseline material.  For the record, if nobody has guessed, 
I am using DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook to flesh out the XUWP, 
and applying liberal amounts of imagination to convert the result 
into a RICE Paper.  Comments, as I said, are welcome, including 
even those comments that tell me to shut the hell up.  RICE Paper 
#0001 will be coming soon.

Yes but these subsectors also provides a \'Home port\' for these fleets.  This
is particularly important for crew with families and routine logistic support.
Not to mention that it\'s a great way for the region to benifite economically
from these ships.

Should not be too diffcult with out the Zhodani actively supporting the
incursions.  Also the Aslan ihatei units ought to give them an interesting
surprise.

I vaguely recall reading the same referance.  But considering the mission
of the Patrol as a centralized fast reaction force these two fleets will be
the idea core.

Over a period of 70 years I would imagine the incorporated ihatei units be
fairly evenly distributed throughout the Regency.  So between rebuilding the
reavaged fleets and setting up the Quarantine area the descendents of the
ihatei should be everywhere.

Also about five years ago at a Los Angeles Gaming convention I recall Loren
Wiseman mentioning the ideal way to deal with the ihatei is to trade land
grant for service.

***:Regarding Regency Maps

Here\'s a list of the border hex from the MT Box set (c 1987)

On the South (Aslan/Rimward) side:

1541,1540,1539,1538,1437,1337,1436,1435,1434,1535,1634,1735,1834,1934,

2637,2638,2739,2839,2940,3039,3040

Worlds bounded by these hex were suppose to be under control of the
Aslan ihatei.

Everytime I take a look at this I can only imagine that it\'s must\'ve been
one heck of a fight.

At the North (Vargr/Coreward) side:

2201,2202,2303,2402,2503,2504,2505,2506,2507,2607,2708,2807,2907,2906,

      The _Berlin_ class Light Rider

BM-1 Berlin BM-K6068F3-C00100-00009-0 MCr10,780.7 10,000 tons
batteries bearing      A  Crew=440.
batteries        A  TL=12.
Low=220. Cargo=218. Fuel=800. EP=800. Agility=6. Marines=350.

Notes: Has a frozen watch, fuel scoops, and purification plant. This 
class normally operated in groups of four.

This is the original _Berlin_ class rider. 180 of these riders were 
built, and the class was originally meant to serve as part of the core of 
the NFN, along with the _Provence_ heavy riders. Riders of this class 
were named for cities on Earth.

The class saw extensive action during 5627. In the Old Islands War, it 
was found that the Amondiage _Sword_ class was almost perfect for 
fighting the _Berlin_. In addition, the weaknesses of the rider concept 
were dramatically displayed when half the NFN\'s riders were captured at 
the Third Battle of St. Genevieve because they couldn\'t retreat from the 
system. The disastrous showing of the riders during that war convinced 
the Admiralty to drop the rider concept, although riders would remain in 
service for several years yet.

During the Topas War, the _Berlin_ made just the opposite impression on 
the Serendip Belt when a Light Rider Squadron and a Cruiser Squadron tore 
up half the Belter Navy. The _Berlins_ of the Light Rider Squadron were 
captured, but the performance of the NFN ships so terrified the Belters 
that they later ran away rather than fight an Alliance force.

Following these wars, fourteen of the twenty _Berlins_ captured by the Belt 
were given to Topas to serve as the core of its Navy, and the other six 
were kept hidden by the Belt. In 5629, the NFN officially gave twenty of 
its _Berlins_ to the Alliance Navy.

In 5631, the NFN decided to give their remaining _Berlins_ a Series A 
refit. 60 riders received the refit before the Serendip War.

BM-1 Series A K6068H3-C00300-0000A-0 MCr10,755.6 10,000 tons
batteries bearing     A  Crew=440.
batteries       A  TL=12(14).

Notes: Has frozen watch, scoops, plant. The refit cost MCr347.6 per ship 
and took 9 weeks.

40 of the Series A riders, along with the 80 remaining original model 
_Berlins_, participated in the Second Battle of Neubayern, where the 
Missile-A bays of the refitted riders helped pulverize one of the Belter 
battleships. 73 of the riders were lost, however.

When the Imperials invaded, 20 Series A _Berlins_ were hidden in deep 
space. The rest of the class was scuttled (very visibly) in the Neubayern 
system to prevent capture by the Imperial Navy. When the Imperials were 
thrown out, the 20 _Berlins_ were reactivated to act as system defence 
boats for a few months and then were relegated to museums. They never saw 
action again.

Okay, so we have the Regency Navy (RN).  The Regency Army (RA) consists of the
traditional three force commands: Aerospace (COACC), Nautical, and Ground.
The Regency Quarantine Service (RQS) consists of assests originally gained from
the (mostly Aslan?) Domain Patrol and the DISS.  Is there still a scout
service in the Regency, an RISS?

Now that we\'ve seen the post-5FW era *Spinward Marches Campaign* borders and
allegiance data, let\'s compare the early Rebellion era information from
MegaTraveller.

Source: *MT Players\' Manual* rulesbook
Published: c1987
Game date: c1116

This rulesbook contains a map of the Spinward Marches  inside the
front cover (8.5 x 11).  The borders show every world in Regina, Aramis,
Lanth, Rhylanor, Lunion, Mora, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil as within the Imperium.  Imperial borders in Jewell, Vilis and Five Sisters are `consistent\' with
previously published works.  The map shows the Border Worlds in Sword Worlds
subsector but adds two more members (Tyrfing 1324 and Sacnoth 1325) bringing
the total worlds up to twelve.  The two worlds in District 268, Mertactor 1537
and Mille Falcs 1637, are still shown as part of the Imperium.  There is
no UWP data in this book but a library data entry for the Spinward Marches
(P91) mentions the Border Worlds.

Three of the other MegaTraveller books, the *Referee\'s Manual*, the *Referee\'s
Companion* and the *Rebellion Sourcebook* do not have any Spinward Marches
border or allegiance data (except in Imperium-wide maps that are difficult
to read at that scale).

Source: *Imperial Encyclopedia* sourcebook
Published: c1987
Game date: c1118

The sourcebook includes UWP data for all worlds in the Spinward Marches.
This data shows alignment codes for the Border Worlds for the following
worlds in Sword Worlds subsector:

1324 Tyrfing (added since post-5FW era)
1325 Sacnoth (added since post-5FW era)
1424 Beater
1522 Dyrnwyn
1523 Durendal
1524 Hofud
1525 Sting
1526 Steel
1626 Iron
1627 Bronze
1628 Mithril

This data is consistent with the *MTPM* map and adds two more former
Sword Worlds to the Border Worlds.

The Imperial Client States in District 268 have been affected by the
invasion of the Aslan *ihatei*.  The following worlds are listed as
client states in *IE*:

1132 Bowman
1138 Tarsus
1232 Walston
1237 Collace
1238 Pavabid
1340 Motmos
1434 Tarkine
1532 Elixabeth
1631 Talchek
1632 Milagro

The new information in *IE* reflects the invasions of the Aslan *ihatei*
and the Vargr.  Thirty-nine worlds in District 268 and Glisten and Trin\'s
Veil subsectors have Aslan allegiance codes and 21 worlds in Regina and
Aramis have Vargr allegiance codes.  This information is not reflected
in the sector map that appears in the *Players\' Manual*.  The worlds
overrun by the Aslan are:

District 268
1337 Judice (was Imperial client state in post-5FW era)
1435 Dallia (was Imperial client state in post-5FW era)
1436 Talos
1537 Mertactor (was Imperial world in post-5FW era)
1634 Pagaton
1635 Binges
1637 Mille Falcs (was Imperial world in post-5FW era)

Glisten subsector (were all Imperial worlds in post-5FW era)
1736 Melior         1737 Egypt          1739 Aster
1836 Callia         1932 Mithras        1934 Weiss
1935 Windsor        1937 Overnale       1938 New Rome
1939 Craw           2035 Aki            2036 Glisten (subsector capital)
2038 Trane          2132 Centry         2134 Caledonia
2137 Sorel          2138 Horosho        2140 Romar
2231 Marastan       2232 Crout          2233 Tirem
2234 Inthe          2236 Tsarina        2237 Wurzburg
2331 Bicornn        2334 Ffudn          2336 Bendor

Trin\'s Veil subsector (were all Imperial worlds in post-5FW era)
2536 Squanine
2739 Dodds
2839 Farquahar
2940 Thornastor
3039 Tenelphi (Yikes!  `My\' homeworld!)

With these sorts of gains into the Spinward Marches you would expect the
the Aslan to have overrun Sindal, Pax Rulin, Tobia and Gazulin in the
Trojan Reach.

The Vargr made gains to coreward in Regina and Aramis as well:

Regina subsector (were all Imperial worlds in post-5FW era)
2201 Dentus
2202 Kinorb
2303 Yorbund
2402 Heya

Aramis subsector (were all Imperial worlds in post-5FW era)
2602 Corfu          2607 Focaline       2701 Lablon
2706 Heguz          2708 Violante       2905 Pavanne
2906 Carsten        3001 Jesedipere     3002 Yebab
3003 Nasemin        3004 Zykoca         3005 Aramanx
3008 Pysadi         3102 Rugbird        3103 Towers
3104 Feneteman      3202 Junidy

Again, one would expect similar sorts of Vargr inroads into Pretoria,
Lamas, Antra and Million in Deneb sector.

There are Imperium-wide maps in *IE* that show the progress of the Rebellion
during 1116-1120.  Again, these are difficult to read because of the scale
but the 1117 map show Aslan *ihatei* in Sindal, Tobia, Pax Rulin and
Gazulin and in Usher and Vestus in Reft sector.  The 1118 map shows Aslan
moving into District 268, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil.  By 1119 the Aslan have
been forced out of Vestus.  By 1120 they have been expelled from District
268, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil.  None of these Imperium-wide maps reflect any
Vargr gains into the Marches or Deneb.

The situation on the rimward front does coincide with Norris\'s plans for
dealing with the *ihatei*:
1. Contain their advance to within 5 pc of the border (not quite)
2. Negotiate a halt to the incursions (basically a delaying tactic)
3. Build up forces to counter the incursions
4. Expell the invaders
By 1120, the Domain seems to have seen some success here although one
might expect the *ihatei* settlers to have remained even if their
naval forces were expelled.  (That\'s the nature of *ihatei* invasions.)

Next, let\'s look at the later Rebellion era as depicted in *Travellers\'
Digest* and the *MegaTraveller Journals*.

I think we\'ve lost track of the original question. As I recall it (correct
me if I\'m wrong) you started out by asking how come Gram was the leader of
the Sword Worlds when Sacnoth was so much more powerful. I assumed that
you were talking about powerful in the naval sense (since a TL or two
dosen\'t mean nearly as much as the population size in the economic sense).
So I proposed two possible reasons why the Gram and Narsil fleets maybe
wasn\'t less powerful than the Sacnoth: One possibility was that Gram and
Narsil bought TL 12 ships. Another, postulating these economic cycles, was
that maybe they had been TL 12 themselves and still had a lot of TL 12
ships from back then. (Those two possibilities turned out to dovetail so
neatly that they subsequently got intermixed, but that\'s by the way). 
Since then I\'ve tried to defend the notion that the economic cycles are
_possible_. I don\'t say that they definitely must be, that there are no
other possibilities. Just that they are perfectly possible. I don\'t try
to prove that they exist, only that they could exist. OK? Nor did I use
them to explain the disparity of different TLs. My argument in that 
direction was:

	1) TL 15 _knowledge_ is readily available to anyone in contact
	   with Imperial society.
	2) That many worlds have lower than TL 15 _industry_, cannot
	   therefor be explained by a lack of knowledge, but must be
	   due to other reasons.
	3) The most likely limiting factors are economic.
	4) Economic cycles are well-known on Earth today.
	5) Granted, economic cycles does not cause TL swings on Earth
	   today (as far as I know).
	6) However _if_ technology is limited by economy (as it is in	
	   the Traveller universe), sufficiently large booms and recessions 
	   _ought_ to be able to affect the TL of a world.

It applies to the ability of Gram and Narsil to maintain a TL 12 fleet with
TL 11 and 10 economies.

But my whole point is that they _will_ have much more than a clue. The

That too.

No, it proves that the authors of a board game have different priorities
from the authors of a role-playing game.

Not in terms of the economy according to _Trillion Credit Squadron_. The
GPP (Gross Planetary Product) of Gram is close to that of Sacnoth and that
of Narsil is a lot bigger.

There are 7 SW squadrons that must be TL 12 (jump3 capable), 9 that could
be TL 12, but propably are TL 11 (jump2 capable), and none that can be TL
10 (no jump1 squadrons). The troops are marked with TL: One brigade from
Gram is TL 11 and one from Joyeuse is TL 10. The rest are anonymous and
consists of four TL 10 corps and 2.5 TL 11 corps. No TL 12 corps at all.
The whole force is much less than the total available Sword World forces;
the attack on the Imperium appears to be a secondary effort. Most of 
their prime units must have gone against the Darrians. Any Gram TL 12
units could be there.

I had always assumed that GDW just took all the Sword World names they could
find in "Space Viking" and used the Tolkien names and the Norse Mythology
names (not even swords!) to fill out the subsector. But a short while ago I
checked, and it turns out that there are a whole bunch of Piper SWs that
has no Traveller SW counterpart. Most of the duplications are with really
famous swords like Excalibur, Joyeuse, and Durendal  -  the kind of names
anyone would dig up once the idea of \'Sword Class\' names had ocurred to
them. So what the Traveller SWs owe to Piper is actually little more than
the concept of the sword names. The societies are different in a number of
ways too (Women accepted in \'male\' roles for instance).

You\'re right. I\'ve mixed my own idea up with the official info. \'Exiles\'
does imply some sort of pressure on them, though.

This was long after the Interstellar Wars. _Cats&Rats_ says that they left
Terra in -420. That they used 29 years to get to the Spinward Marches
implies a desire to get _really_ away from it all. My interpretation is
that they were losers in a civil war in the Old Earth Union. Not official.

That\'s just what I said. It\'s two different and independent bits of my
argument. The disparate TLs indicates a close tie to economy. Economy can
(and often does) fluctuate. Ergo TLs can fluctuate. If you postulate that 
Sword World economy dosen\'t fluctuate you get stable TLs. If you postulate 
that it does you get unstable TLs.

Certainly. The stable economy theory. But one set of UPPs isn\'t enough to
say anything one way or the other about this. Of course, we do have 
several sets of UPPs for the Sword Worlds, but since they have world
populations fluctuating by bilions within a decade I don\'t know that
we can really rely on them.

Perhaps not, but it sure sound like it from the length of time the Gram

I think that is wrong. Whatever the age of an institution, the people who
run it usualy thinks in terms of their own generation.

The pacification campaigns took place before even the Ante-bellum period of
the Imperium. The 3rd frontier War took place after the Civil War and the
Psionic suppressions. I find no problem with accepting that Imperial
attitudes were different in those two periods.

I must have a different definition of \'intergration\' than you. I think these
worlds all produce whatever is most profitable at any given time and sell it
to anyone who will buy. That\'s not intergration in my book.

GDW failed to consider the ramifications of what they had already established
about Aslan ihatei and made a massive mistake in an effort create one more
Rebellion faction.

And the Vargr (as originally described) are equally incapable of posing a
credible threat. 

I\'ve presented my arguments against the seriousness of Aslan ihatei threat 
before. I\'ll do it again if anyone wants to dispute the matter. But for
now I\'ll just post a letter that I worked out to explain away most of the
inconsistencies and what happened afterwards:

- ----
Message from High Commissioner the Lord Goolanzoon, Sector Admiral, Imperial
Navy  (ret.),  Minister without portfolio of the Archduchy of Deneb,  to His
Grace Archduke Norris of Deneb using the private cypher:


Mora, 345-1118

Dear Pruneface,

Well, the "Committee to Review the recent events in the Trojan Reaches with a
view to ascertaining etc. etc."  -  in short, what went wrong and what can we
do about it?   -   has finally completed it\'s investigation.  No doubt you\'ll
eventually get a predigested resume of our findings through your tame bureau-
crats, but I thought you\'d appreciate a informal overview. (And to be totally
honest, I\'m too damn exited to wait for an official reaction).
    First of all,  there\'s  no doubt that the whole thing was shockingly mis-
managed by the Duke of Tobia and Admiral Torgeson. They seem to\'ve lost their
so-called heads completely.  True, most of the regular units were up coreward
watching the zhos, but the astrographics of the Reach is such that any first-
year  cadet  could\'ve  stopped  the aslan by garrisoning a few key worlds and
forming  a few  fire-fighter squadrons.  These are ihatei,  after all,  using
obsolescent  clan hand-me-downs   -   not much superior to our Reserve forces
(rather the reverse,  if anything).  Hell,  give me a half-decent spy network
and  a  good  courier system and I\'d\'ve undertaken to stop them with half the
forces the two fatheads had.
    Instead  Tobia  and  Torgeson  concentrated their forces to guard the few
worlds that were already so well protected  that no sane aslan would dream of
trying  to  muscle  in on them and sat around with their thumbs up their bums
while  our bewhiskered land-grabbing friends grabbed left,  right and center.
And  none  of  the other nobles had the gumption to do anything more than try
and protect their own little patch  (mostly with pitiful results). Personally
I think that the proper cure for what ails the local nobility is a collective
brain-transplant.  If  you  can\'t  find  enough donors,  a set of cheap paper
substitutes will still be an improvement!
    I know, I know.  We can\'t really do anything about the nobles   -   but I
can  dream,  can\'t I?   -   but you ought to sack the top three levels of the
Fleet,  at  least.  There\'s a few you\'d have to kick upstairs and a couple of
exceptions, but most of the idiots deserve to be cashiered. That\'s the result
of the Reach being too far from any real fighting for centuries,  I guess   -
all the fools wind up down here, where they,  quote "can\'t do any harm",  end
quote. Ha, bloody ha! I\'ve said it myself, may the Guiding Spirit forgive me.
    I  spoke  of  fools,  but  I\'m pretty sure that there\'s also a few knaves
around. That shocking business with Aki - ihatei that far inside the frontier
and 30 parsec from their base, for the luffa Mike!   -   couldn\'t\'ve happened
without  the conniving of somebody pretty high up.  I have a few of my bright
young  men  looking into it   -   hopefully giving the lardbutts of the local
Naval Intelligence  (hmpf!)  a few well-deserved heart attacks in the process
- -  and when we find the culprits, the bastards are going to breathe vacuum!
    Mind you, I\'ve often wondered what made the aslans commit that particular
bit of lunacy. Imagine trying to control 10 billion locals with a few hundred
thousands.  They  had a couple of tech levels on the locals,  true,  but as I
always say,  once you can make explosives the rest is just dressing.  Anyway,
young Blackstone-Hawke - remember him?  He was one of Santanocheev\'s hangers-
on  and wound up in charge of the Gazulin Reserve Fleet after the shake-up  -
Well, he seems to have had a few more brain cells than we gave him credit for
(or  perhaps  being stuck in the boonies for half a decade has wised him up).
The  moment he heard about Aki he put a fleet across the aslani supply lines,
and  the  last  I  heard about it the survivors were at the peace tables with
their tail between their legs.  (Not that far between their legs though. They
have  been  raiding Glisten and a lot of other places for supplies,  and they
still control the Aki system. But I guess you know all this already).
    Anyway, there\'s no getting around the fact that the dam is well and truly
broken.  Apointing blame is all very well   -   it\'s rapidly becoming the fa-
vourite  sport  of the local nitwits   -   but the real problem is what to do
about  it.  Curiously enough according to my tame sociologists the problem is
more the locals than the aslans.  You remember the old diplomatic joke?  "You
give  us  what  we  want  or we beat the hell out of you and take it anyway"?
Well, apart from at Aki and a few other places, the aslans seems to have come
up  with a variant:  "You sell us what we want or we beat the hell out of you
and buy it anyway"! Most of them prefer to buy rather than take  -  they just
don\'t  take  no for an answer!  Nor would there normally be any problems with
getting  them to swear fealthy to the Imperium.  Well,  that\'s not altogether
true;  some of the clans are quite anti-Imperium.  But we\'d have the strength
to deal with them if we could get along with the rest.
    That  would  seem to solve most of the problem,  wouldn\'t it?  If they\'re
willing to pay for what they take and to become loyal citizens, then we real-
ly should be able to work out something, right?  Alas, the locals have become
thoroughly paranoid about them and in many cases refuse to share their worlds
with  them.  They  organize their own militias and try to push the aslans off
their planets. And you know what happens when you push an aslan  -  he pushes
right back!  If something isn\'t done, the descendents of both sides are going
to be sniping at each others 200 years from now.
    Fortunately  we have been able to come up with a solution!  That\'s right,
we have an answer,  and it\'s so simple that you\'re going to kick yourself for
not thinking of it yourself.  I did when my aide earned the fastest promotion
in history with just one sentence.  Think about it. What are our two greatest
problems  today?  One is that we have all these young aslans swarming up from
rimwards, eager for land and willing to fight for it, and we can\'t stop them,
because most of our ships are up corewards trying to keep the damn Vargr from
devastating more planets than they already have.
    I really wish I could see your face now,  Pruney.  As my aide said:  "Why
don\'t we get our two problems to fight each other?" Corewards and in Corridor
there  are  scores  of planets whose populations have been decimated;  untold
acres of prime land whose legitimate owners and their heirs are dead and gone.
We  can  hire all the ihatei we can get and pay them off with that land!  And
you can bet your bottom credit that the survivors are not going to regard the
aslans as interlopers. They\'ll be saviours!
    Furthermore, once we have a credible offer to make, we\'ll be able to play
the aslan clans off against each others. You know how fragile aslan alliances
are,  Frankly I\'m amazed that the present one has held so long as it has, and
it  has only done so because they could get more out of cooperating with each
other than with us.  The land the aslans can get down here rimwards is mostly
second choice.  Give them an offer of prime land and they\'re not going to let
the  Vargr  stand  in  the  way.  And we\'ll be able to favour the friendliest
clans, leaving us in a position to make the unfriendly ones toe the line.
    With the extra strength the aslan can supply  (not to metion the ships we
will be able to spare from the rim)  we should be able to clear the Domain of
Vargr.  Hell,  we  may  even be in a position to clear Corridor,  although my
aslan  experts  doubt  it.  They say that the present massive burst of ihatei
will  taper  off in a year or so,  and that it will be a long time before the
pressure builds up to the pre-Revolution level. For one thing, the ihatei has
mostly  leap-frogged over all the neutral worlds we kept between them and us,
and  it will be some time before they\'ve "filled in the cracks".  Still,  who
knows? Perhaps enough of them will prefer Corridor to filling in cracks.
    What  I  suggest is that we keep this plan secret and try to surprise the
Vargr.  The most pressing problem is Aki and the rest of Glisten. If you will
send me a warrant,  I\'ll take over the negotiations and get the ball rolling.
I\'ve  already put my staff on to planning the logistics which,  I admit,  are
going to be a headache. But worth it, I\'d say!

Cheerio,
Goggles.

Your idea of article subject lines seems most excellent and you list
topics seem fairly well broken down.  While I initially favored not
splitting the list in all fairness to those who have yet to embrace TNE
(or know something that infidels like myself are ignorant of) a split
seems to be in order.

Why should they suffer and in some cases pay for data that is worthless
to them.  I shall miss them but hopefully the filters will be feasable
and soon allow us to reap the benefits of technology> TML - mail listing

As a Latter Day Traveller with access to *PoT* info detailing the
military assets of a world can be found on pages 95-97 of that book of
ineffable damnation (TM the other company (lest mention of their same
summon them like demon-spawn)).

From that book: "The greater the perceived threat or need for security
forces, the more resources will be devoted to defense.  This system uses
total personnel as  auseful guage of the resources devoted to the
military."

balkanized worlds - ea. nation averages 1% of its pop in armed forces
(this can vary by 50%+ in either direction.)

non-balk worlds - only about 0.25% pop in armed forces

hi-pop worlds or countries - multiply total number of personnel by 0.5.
Note not all nations on balk worlds are subject, only those with pops of
1 billion+

These forces are broken into four branches: wet navy, air force (inc.
orbital & sub-orbit craft), space force, and ground forces.  The
calculation of the percentage of the total each force is comprised of is
fairly complex.  The space force for example:

Base percentage determined by starport: A = 10%, B= 8, C = 6, D = 4, E =
2, X = 0 which is modified as follows:

(ignoring TL 8-)
	Factor	Modification
	TL 9 or 10	x 0.5
	pop = 8	x 0.2
	pop = 9	x 0.03
	pop = 10+	x 0.004

Once the number of personnel in each force is established the equipment
is determined bearing in mind only a small percentage comprise the
actual crew with the remainder support & logistics.

Ex - Space Force: One combatant for every 500 personnel.  In large
services (30000+) half of the personnel will serve with major combatants
(1000+ tons) with one in service for every 1500 personnel.  The balance
will be regular combatants.  Small services (<5000) will partially or
fully man armed merchant craft with one in service for every 250
personnel.

These numbers seem skewed when put into use, for example:
Tizon (pop 300,000,000; TL 10)
600,000 personnel, 200 major ships,  600 regular ships

Narsil (pop 20,000,000,000; TL 10)
400,000 personnel, 133 major ships, 400 regular ships

Gram (pop 6,000,000,000; TL 11)
2,250,000 personnel, 750 major ships, 2250 regular ships

Someone tell me my calculations are off!! It is midnight. Or as

Any suggestions for a name for this gun?  The purpose of the gun is to
provide Coalition forces with a one-man weapon that can overcome battle
dress equiped forces of TEDs.

    'index' => 'am136',
    'month' => '05',
    'body' => 'Since people originally asked about the composition of the Sword
Worlds military, here\'s the lowdown from 5FW:

Since the game is focused on the primary theater of operations, 
we only see the Joyeuse and Gram fleets.  The Darrian theater
is off the game board, as is the rimward theater and most of
the Sword Worlds Confederation, so the Sacnoth and Narsil fleets
are not represented.

Planetary forces are estimates converted from the wargaming
notation to something a little more clear to the general reader.

ARMY: 
       Mjolnir has no defenses, tech-10.
       Gungnir has one division, tech-8.  Balkanized world.
       Joyeuse has an SDB, one corps, two divisions, and one brigade, 
         tech-10.  Balkanized world.
       Gram has 120 SDBs and twelve corps, tech-10.
       
   Mobile forces available are:
    
       Six corps (one elite), two brigades, TL 10 to 11, mostly 
         tech-10.

NAVY:  Under the Gram and Joyeuse Fleets:
       Six BatRons, seven CruRons, two AssaultRons, one TankRon.
       Fleet is roughly 60% jump-2, 40% jump-3, suggesting roughly
       60% tech-11, 40% tech-12, minimum.
       
Three admirals are available.  One must be a Zhodani liaison.  
  Unfortunately for the Sword Worlds, their skill is inversely
  proportional to their rank.  The ranking flag, Riksdattar, is
  much like Santanocheev.  [Incidentally, if her name is formed
  in the Icelandic manner, Riksdattar is a woman.  Just an
  observation for the SW culture watchers.]
  
*ANALYSIS*

Hm.  I guess the SDB figures are for craft or are more abstract...
Terra only had 34 wings in 1001, after all.

Note that Gram is stated to be TL 10!  However, _Spinward Marches 
Campaign_ confirms the tech-11...but it also says Regina is tech-12,
which is an increase of two tech levels from previous supplements.  
Would someone kindly check the CT book _Supplement 3: The Spinward 
Marches_ to see if this is the case?  It might answer some questions.

Since the SW were not colonized until -399 imperial, and they have 
had no patron like the Imperial colonies, is it possible that they
are just entering a period of technological growth?

Note the paucity of forces available to the SW government.  It
would seem that they aren\'t really prepared for much of an
offensive campaign. 

Side notes:

The leadership in 5FW is interesting.  Generally speaking, the 
Zhodani have better leadership than the Imperials.  Santanocheev
isn\'t a complete disaster as an admiral -- he\'s a bit like General
McClellan from the US Civil War; he reacts and plans very slowly,
but in battle he\'s a decent tactician.  Norris isn\'t a tactician,
but he has a grasp of strategic planning and a reaction time that\'s 
pretty phenomenal. The IN actually has a couple of junior admirals
that tactically *impede* the performance of their fleets!

Seditious TNE influence:  by using _PoT_ rules in a wildly 
inappropriate way, estimated armed forces from UWP.  Ground force
seems a bit low, but probably explainable by needing more hands 
in space in a pre-Collapse professional military.  The SW seem to be
a naval power, anyway.

  I looked over Graham Spearing\'s TL 11 10mm ETC pistol.  The numbers
all check out except for the bulk listing.  With a length of 28cm, the
bulk is only 1, not 2.
  If the bulk listing is ok for the player, but the 3 recoil is a bit
hefty, try adding a 4 cm muzzle brake.  It will make it bulk 2 (32 cm
length), but drop the recoil to 2.  It will only make it slightly
heavier (2.0071 Kg unloaded vs 1.8071 Kg unloaded) and only raise the
bottom line price by Cr50.

    Many blights and wilts are multi-species.  Fungi and viroids seem 
    to be non-discriminating...

    A number of virii are multi-species; influenza is perhaps the best
    known example.  Several truly unpleasant tropical nasties jump 
    from monkeys to humans (HIV, for one).

    Many epidemic diseases have vectors other than humans (Bubonic 
    Plague in rats & fleas, for example).

    For a truly evil virus, read the posts I made about a time-delayed
    nanotech "virus" back in the late Hard Times/Survival Margin days,
    when the Virus was a rumor being condemned on the TML.

    As a matter of record, according to the Julian Protectorate 
    article some years back in Challenge, the Gashikaan Empire once 
    tried to wipe out the Vargr species using a tailored virus.  They 
    killed a lot of Vargr, the disease was brought under control, and 
    the Vargr nations nearby were really pissed off and trashed the 
    Gashikaan Empire because of it.  I don\'t remember whether this was
    the "Sack of Gashikaan" or if the bitterness fostered by the "Sack
    of Gashikaan" was what led to the attempted genocide.  In any 
    case, the modern Second Gashikaan Empire is still a bunch of 
    Vargrphobes.

(1) No. My groups are still post-5FW, and I doubt I will ever use the TNE
universe.  (However, we have the Imperial Occupation of the Islands Cluster
and the Sixth Frontier War coming up instead... and possibly the 2nd Solomani
Rim War.)

(2 & 3) Sacnoth will take Capital of the Border Worlds Confederation away
from Beater as the popular backlash against "knuckling under to Impy puppets"
crests; the Border Worlds will cease to be a tame puppet...er client state of
the Imperium.  However, true to traditional Sword Worlds fractiousness, the
Border Worlds/Sword Worlds split will stand, as  Gram and Sacnoth will be
unable to agree on proper usage of the Metal Worlds.  (The Border Worlds has
opened them to colonization, particularly from overcrowded Sacnoth -- the
Sword Worlds, still having many underpopulated, relatively pleasant worlds
open for further colonization, demands that they be closed to further
colonization and retained as "resource worlds"...i.e., they don\'t want
Sacnoth having more political allies and votes in a reunited Confederation
government).  The Joyeuse civil war will finally grind to a close, as those
who have been fostering instability there change policies, and Joyeuse will
become an significant part of Sword World politics once it rebuilds.

Some were built on Gram, and some in Sacnoth\'s yards *before* the war, before
the Impy Navy raid that trashed Sacnoth\'s A yards... (yes, I am playing fast

    'body' => 'Navigation

         Normal space navigation is carried out with the aid of System
    Navigation Beacons, which provide precise 4-D position fixes to
    users.  Most System Navigation Beacons use some form of
    spread-spectrum technology to reduce the power required to make a
    broadcast signal heard across an entire solar system, and to avoid
    drowning out nearby radio traffic from the power of the signal.
    Since a spread-spectrum signal is weaker than background noise at
    the receiver, the receiver has to "know" the Pseudo-Random Noise
    (PRN) code imposed on the carrier signal to identify signal amid
    background noise.  The Imperium has a set of standard PRNs used
    Imperium-wide for normal use.  Military navigation systems have
    their own secret PRNs with encrypted Nav signals.

        In a war zone, the Imperial Navy (or local authority, if
    non-Imperial) will shut down the civilian system to impair enemy
    navigation insystem.  This is one reason, in addition to hazards
    from combatants, that War Zone systems are made Amber zones or
    occasionally Red Zones.  [BTW, this is based on our (1992 Real
    World) GPS and Russia\'s GLONASS systems].

         Grade of starport usually implies comparable grade of
    navigation systems.  A class E starport may have one beacon at the
    starport (which is useful for finding the starport, and not much
    else), whereas a class A starport mainworld has a full
    constellation of navigation beacons around every major body in the
    system (which makes deep space navigation a trivial exercise).

         Interstellar jumps make use of a published ephemeris for a
    system, listing all the celestial bodies and major installations,
    and their orbital statistics such that their positions can be
    calculated at any given time.  With an accurate ephemeris and
    competent navigation, a merchant ship or battleship can jump
    precisely to the 100-diameter limit of their destination world.
    Without an accurate ephemeris, it is usually necessary to jump
    into the outer system, above the plane of the ecliptic (to avoid
    debris and traffic), and calculate one\'s own ephemeris from
    collected sensor data.

         Many worlds with less-than-trusting rulers issue falsified
    ephemerii.  The fixes provided by their System Navigation Beacons
    compensate for this falsification, so it has no effect in ordinary
    use.  During Emergencies (war, raids, etc.), the Beacons can be
    shut down, and the falsified ephemeris makes it harder (tho far
    from impossible) to get an accurate jump fix, and, more important,
    makes it nearly impossible to launch a ballistic strike from an
    extreme distance (i.e., throw asteroids at the planet from beyond
    detection range.)  The ephemerii used by the Imperial Navy are
    either *UNCONFIRMED* (the public, possibly falsified ephemerii
    issued to civilians) or *CONFIRMED* (true, usually classified,
    ephemerii that have been verified true by Scout Service
    surveying.)

	This is pretty accurate, but quite misleading.  Based on what you

	_You_ misunderstood the significance of these numbers, at least.
The budget is an annual budget, and the capacity is shipyard capacity.
	Since TCS requires 10% of ship cost as annual maintenance, to all
intents, the _value_ of the SW Navy is 10 times the annual budget, or
TCr142.4.
	The shipyard capacity has some bearing on Navy size, but, in my
experience, not much.  The only world in any of my TCS games that _ever_
operated its shipyard at capacity was one doing a lot of contract work
for other players (due to its higher TL).  Most of the worlds seldom
operated at more than 20% capacity.

	However, a good guideline for Fleet size is 1 ton of ship for
KCr750. This results in a Sword Worlds\' Fleet of about 190,000,000 tons,
or 3800 ships in the 50,000T range.
	Note that this thumbrule can vary quite a lot, depending on TL, but
it works reasonably well from TL11-15.

	The two sets of rules are completely incompatible.  I have, however,
always assumed that the FFW fleets are a simplification of the reality
it pretends to model for ease of play.  Who wants to play a game with
10,000 pieces, after all?

Subject: Weapon Designs in Traveller

Much as I dispise the authors of TNE for throwing away the
whole potential of CT/MT and restricting the game to a
not-very-interesting universe there is one bit they managed
to get just right. From the back of FF&S:
	"Other games give you lists of weapons, we give you
the factory".
	This is *exactly* what Traveller used to be about, but
not just for weapons, but the universe too. Now that the TNE
bitch is out of the way this opens up some interesting ideas
I have had...

	I think the FF&S weapons & ammo design is a pretty cool
idea. It would be cute and easy enought to do to have the 
simple ammo/pistol/rifle rules in a small application for
design. The problem is that as they exist they are useless
to me since I spit upon TNE combat.
	However, the only really TNE specific bit is where they
translate the physical stats of the gun (muzzle velocity,
etc) into those stange numbers. If you just replaced this table
with one showing good old penetration, attenuation and damage
you would have nifty firearm design rules for MT. By a similar
mechanism you would have the same for CT.
	Taking this idea to the logical extreme I thought that once
I had an application I could just get an expert at any particular
system to translate the physical outputs into the game mechanics
of *whatever* particular system. GURPS, Paranoia, etc, etc.
	We don\'t need the application to start with. Just the tables.
Whose first? I\'ll happily coordinate the results.

Recently there was some discussion re. the composition of ground forces.
According to the Book of Moron (thats Path of Tears for those who have

one battalion equivalent per 2000 personnel (includes one maneuver 	
	battalion (of about 500) and its support personnel (about 500) 	
	plus up to 1000 others in the supporting military infrastructure

types of maneuver bttns: infantry, cavalry, armor, airborne, commando,

support bttns:
	combat support: combat eng, field art, air defense, antitank art,
		coastal defense, fortress art, etc.
	non-cmbt support: signal, forward supply, transport, maintenance,
		MPs, etc.
infrastructure: medical, veterinary, admin, training, theater and rear 	
	area supply, judge advocate general, and general staff personnel


one division equivalent per 20000 personnel typically of 10 maneuver and
10 support battalions and 10000 infrastructure personnel

Fron TL5+ the typical battalion consists of five 100 man comnpanies: 3
line, 1 support, 1 HQ

Old style rebreathers used CaCO3 to absorb CO2.  Modern rebreathers
crack the CO2 electrically and recycle the O2.  This is the same
method used aboard nuclear subs.

Not quite accurate.  O2 toxicity begins at 2 ATMs of 100% O2.
Anything less is not normally dangerous.  This is the reason
that std. compressed air diving is physiologically limited to
a max. depth of 289 FSW (ft. of Sea Water).  That equals 9
ATMs (atmospheres) of sea water, plus 1 for the surface, for
a total of 10 ATMs.  The rounded value of O2 as comprising 20%
of normal air, gives it a partial pressure of 2 ATMs at 288
FSW.  Any deeper diving requires custom mixed gases.

Ok, I take back what I said about proofreading, here\'s a *real*
doozy....

Recently, for whatever reason, I looked into designing a ship 
capable of interstellar flight with a payload of five billion
tons, using FF&S.  (A *huge* payload.  Some of the CT referees
out there who liked FASA may know where my number is coming
from.)  So I checked out drive systems.

FTL travel works great...a ship with jump-1, and able to jump
three times without refueling, uses 32% of its internal volume
for drive systems, including fuel, as would any other large 
jump-1 ship.

STL travel stinks.  And it revealed a *major* bug in the FF&S
rules.  At tech-9 and above, the best options are the fusion
rocket and the Daedalus drive.  Supposedly, the Daedalus drive
is a better choice; "the engines [have] a lower thrust-to-mass
ratio than a conventional fusion rocket, but provide fuel 
efficiency about one order of magnitude higher." (p. 74)

#$**$%^@!  <This is a family mailing-list.>  :)

Per cubic meter of maneuver drive: (in metric tons)
 
                  THRUST       FUEL USE  ...fuel per ton of thrust
 Daedalus drive: 1.5 ton   0.00050 ton/hr.     0.000334 ton/hr
 Fusion rocket   9.0 ton   0.00035 ton/hr.     0.000039 ton/hr
 HEPlaR drive:  33.4 ton   0.02917 ton/hr.     0.000873 ton/hr
 
Figures are rounded.  HEPlaR figures include the required fusion
power plant in the drive\'s cubic meter, here assumed to be at
tech-10, are included for comparison with the tech-9 drive systems.
The advantage of a higher thrust-to-mass ratio is that your engine
is smaller.  HEPlaR fuel use doesn\'t improve...but the engines
get smaller.

The Daedalus drive is an order of magnitude *worse* in fuel 
efficiency than the conventional fusion rocket!!!  Combined
with its\' worse thrust-to-mass ratio, the engine is fairly
worthless.

Of course, maybe fuel efficiency isn\'t the issue...a big fusion
rocket isn\'t exactly a healthy thing to be around.  But that
wasn\'t the selling point in FF&S!  At tech-10, the smaller motor
of the HEPlaR probably outweighs the fuel efficiency advantage
of the Daedalus drive.  (It might be worthwhile at late tech-8.
The Daedalus design was originally supposed to be staged, and
that may also help its\' prospects as an interstellar drive, but
not as a competitor with the fusion rocket.)  The fuel 
efficiency of all of these seems to be a bit short of the kind
of performance I was looking for.  (It *is*, however, quite
realistic.)

This also brings up another interesting point.  It seems to me 
that even accounting for the extra mass needed in the motor of
a fusion rocket, it is more efficient than a HEPlaR drive.  This
suggests that there may be an advantage to using fusion rocket
designs in some cases on a military vessel, perhaps as a second
drive system.  

Any comments?  Am I reading this wrong?

Many would agree that the knowledge on how to build an atomic bomb is
readily available in books stashed in libraries the world over. Thus,
anyone can get the knowledge to build a bomb.

I want one, so I go to the library and check out "How to win friends &
influence people the Oppenheimer way". I read carefully, and build a case
and timer, etc. Then I hit a stumbling block: Plutonium. Where do I get it?

Regulations aside, I can\'t afford it. Looks like if I want my own nuke, I
will need to invest some money or play the lottery frequently until I get
enough cash to buy or manufacture Plutonium.

Similarly, even if a TL10 world had access to TL12 technology, they
wouldn\'t be able to put that knowledge to much use until they had invested
time & money into developing the appropriate infrastructure.

I agree that most world have access to the knowledge. However, I would bet
that some wouldn\'t, and even those that did still would\'nt be able to put
it to much use.

Take the example of the TL6 mechanic trying to fix a TL8 car. Sure, he\'s
read the manual, and maybe seen a videotape or two, but he hasn\'t actually
*done* it. Mechanically, I would rule that he still has a skill penalty.
Knowledge must be confirmed.

I imagine that what would happen would be that a number of specialists who
were familiar with higher TL equipment would make a living fixing it,
though the market would be smaller since all that hi-TL equipment is going
to be imported.

Hi All,

I really like Ken Hagler\'s High Guard ship designs. I\'m a big fan of
those simple but useful design and combat rules. Also, I like to 
collect designs so please keep them coming. I\'ll try to post some 
of my old favorites soon.

I recently found a 400k floppy with my circa 1985-86 traveller
campaign on it.  I\'ve been able to recover most of the information
from some corrupted MacWrite files. What is this? Has the Virus
destroyed my Third Imperium as well as GDW\'s?  ;-) Anyway, the 
files require some cleaning up and format changes. I\'ll try to post
them in the next few weeks provided that my wife doesn\'t go into 
labor first. It\'s mostly amber zones and background. 

I\'d like to see a CT/MT list because I\'ve been overwhelmed by the
volume lately. I hesitate to bring up CT issues because it\'s hard
enough to follow everything that\'s going on now. 

But, here it goes....

I remember in the early TML a lot of bandwidth was spent on how High
Guard was flawed concerning Agility. The argument was that the same
energy was being used twice. I\'ve looked through my archives and I
can\'t find if this was resolved. Could someone please fill me in?

First of all point blank range is the principal factor in determining

this .The next important factor is the frontal area of the round and

Short Range= 8(MV)/(MV * r )^1/3

Hey, I was only using the best rationale I could come up with.  Once y\'all
get the *TCS* data maybe you can then address what appears to be a 
discrepancy between that and the *RS* `1000 ships per sector\'.

This is a good point but it really boils down to whether the Sword
Worlds are more like the independent worlds of *TCS* or like the
Imperium doesn\'t it?

I guess what I\'d rather have seen than just comments that this doesn\'t
make sense to you was some suggested alternative.  I\'m not very `attached\'
to what I\'ve developed for the Sword Worlds naval forces but a response
that basically just says "Un uh" isn\'t very interesting *or* useful.

The *RS* says that Imperial naval fleets, which are responsible for a
single subsector, consist of "50-200 ships".  It goes on to explain that
these are battles, cruisers, carriers and some escorts.  Given this I
don\'t see it as completely unreasonable that the Sword Worlds, drawing
from fewer than a complete subsector\'s worth of worlds, are only able to
raise 42 ships.  Yes, they may be more militarized (due to their culture
and their Imperial experience) but they are also a frontier that is
more thinly populated than the `average\' Imperial subsector.  Sure,
they might have twice or three times that many ships so rather than just
saying the answer *isn\'t* 42  :-)  please suggest some alternative and
provide a rationale.

It may be hard to imagine but it\'s consist with canonical material.  I
believe there was some stuff in *JTAS* that referred specifically to the
Regina SDBs as being the 400-ton variety (something in TNS about them
"vectoring toward Assiniboia"?).  It\'s clear from *5FW* that SDBs depend
upon world population (although I couldn\'t find a clear pattern and I
played with the values from *5FW* and *S3:SM* for quite a while).  I feel
Imperial military doctrine doesn\'t call for SDBs to be a significant
factor in a major war - that\'s the role of the Navy.  SDBs are more for
dealing with raiders and pirates.

Please, give us a sample.

I\'d like to point out though that there are two levels of Regency military
development needed here.  One is at the level of the battlefield, which
concerns unit organization, equipment, and the like - tactical issues;
and the other is at the subsector or sector level - resources to support
forces, deployment, command structures - strategic issues.  It seems there
ought to be a great deal of variety at the tactical level (forces to assault
a TL 15 military facility from orbit vs. `peacekeeping\' forces on a TL 8
balkanized world) but that there ought to be some coherent structure at
the strategic level (subsector HQs, troop levels, logistical structures, etc.)

Peace,

Yes, this is true, but I\'m not sure how this would affect redeployment of
these forces in the face of incursions.  I doubt the Regency admiralty
would permit these forces to be destroyed needlessly trying to defend
their home ports.  Faced with defeat at the hands of the *ihatei* (or 
other foes) I believe they would withdraw and regroup.  Keep in mind
that by TNE many of the `overrun\' regions have been recovered and these
fleet units could be redeployed to protect these `gains\' once again.

Well, maybe, except that an Aslan-crewed force would need ships and equipment
designed for Aslan.  Furthermore, it appears by TNE that the Patrol no
longer exists - it has been `absorbed\' by the Quarantine Service.

This misses Pysadi 3008 which I cited from the *IE* UWP data.  Clearly the

This is a great idea, Jeff.  (Although are you sure `rice papers\' isn\'t

What with the uncertain timelines and all maybe it would be a good idea
to include a `date\' for when the RICE paper was written that ties it to
the source for the basic UWP data?

    'body' => 'Thanks to Steve Bonnev, Peter Brenton and David Johnson for the
 responses.  Just to clarify; I have assumed that "Army" (Imperial or
planetary) is a sort of generic term that includes aerospace and wet
naval forces.  However, in situations where Imperial military might
is called for, I think that both of these elements would become
non-issues.

Don\'t panic yet!  Let me explain my heresy first.  In the case of aerospace
forces, an Imperial task group of whatever size would have some form
of orbital support fire, and perhaps even cover from carrier-based
space fighters.  In addition, high-tech AFVs can be classed as aerospace
fighters in many respects, maybe slower but with far more firepower.

In the case of wet navy forces, surface vessels could be directly engaged 
by orbital support fire, fighters or even grav vehicles.  A PT Boat might
be fast and agile, but would be a slug compared to a TL13+ AFV.  The
submersible threat would be more problematic, but I do remember that
the old "Fighting Ships" booklet and some of the GDW material
relating to the defense of Terra in the Solomani Rim War mentioned
that SDBs and fighters were often based in the oceans.  I would suspect
that such vessels would have some limited combat ability in the sea.  I
think lasers might be a bad idea under water, but penetrating x-ray or
maser weapons would work, as would meson weapons.  Even missiles
(direct impact) would work, with some modifications.   Of course, I was
not a physics major, so you may all stop laughing if I am wrong!  :-(

This does not mean that such vehicles would be the best solution, but
it would certainly be more cost effective to use mission-capable existing
designs than it would be to spend funds on whole new classes of vehicles.
An Imperium-wide military machine does get a tad expensive, so these
concerns are very valid.  Besides, we know the 3rd Imperium must be
cheap or broke, or else they could have afforded a less sequel-like name.

As regards Peter Brenton\'s ideas on a Marine Expeditionary Division,
I have used a similar concept.  The Imperial marines would certainly
need to field big units (divisions and corps), but a lot of the dirty work
could be done with the clever employment of smaller mobile units.  This
is where the distinction of Fleet Marines vs Line Marines came in.  The
ship-borne Fleet Marines might just be the ship\'s troops of an Imperial
"ship of the line", or they might be purpose-carried for rapid operations.
I had three classes of such units; Marine Combined Arms Teams (MCATs),
Marine Assault Forces (MAFs) and Marine Assault Brigades (MABs).  

A MCAT would consist of a combined arms company of two rifle platoons
and one armor or mechanized platoon, with a support platoon for
command and heavy weapons.  These would be ad hoc units, formed
from a MAF designated to be broken up into smaller units.   The MAF
could be divided into three MCATs.  The MCAT would be carried on a
5,000 ton starship, which would also have a pair of fighters for aerospace
support.

The MAF would be designed for longer-term field deployments, with
the intention of being at least semi-independent.  The MAF would be made
up of two rifle companies and one armored or mechanized company, with
a weapons company (MRLs) and an artillery battery (2 Meson guns) for 
fire support, an engineer platoon, a medical platoon, a port service platoon
(to handle starport operations at the local captured starport, or at
whatever landing field the engineers built) and a command and general
support company.  The MAF would be carried on a 10,000 ton starship,
which would also carry a squadron of fighters for aerospace support, and
would have orbital support weapons.

The MAB would be especially popular for extended independent
operations.  It would have one armored or mechanized battalion, two
rifle battalions, an artillery company (3 batteries), a drop
infantry/commando company, a cavalry troop (grav bikes & speeders)
an engineer company, a medical company, a port service company and
a reinforced command and general support company.  The MAB would
be carried on a 50,000 tons starship, which would carry a wing (3 
squadrons) of fighters for aerospace support, and would be well
armored and equipped with orbital fire capable weapons.

Of course, the above was using the old High Guard rules, which were
fairly lenient for space requirements.  I would suspect the tonnage of

Notes: This is a fleet battle tender. It can carry up to 40,000 tons 
worth of riders--normally four _Berlins_ or two _Provences_. Has a frozen 
watch, and fuel purification plant.

This is the original, and only known, version of the _Rhine_ class. 70 
were built for the NFN, named for rivers on Earth. This class saw action 
in the Old Islands War and the Topas War. Following the Topas War, FAdm 
Connor commented that the ships\' substantial missile armament made them 
useful as \'auxiliary battleship\' in some situations. In 5629, five of 
these ships were handed over to the Alliance Navy.

Many _Rhines_ were present in the Neubayern system at the beginning of 
the Second Battle of Neubayern, but they successfully escaped to St. 
Genevieve where they joined the Alliance Fleet. Many of these ships no 
longer had riders to carry, as these had been destroyed at Neubayern, and 
were handed over to the Alliance or mothballed.

The fate of the _Rhine_ was unclear since the riders were being phased 
out. The NFN had begun experiments with a class of 1000-ton laser-armed 
gunboats, but the experiment had not yet yielded any concrete results 
when the Imperials arrived. Many _Rhines_ were scrapped or hidden, but 
five were hidden on Sansterre.

When the Cluster Liberation War came, one of the _Rhines_ carried forty 
of the experimental _Thunderbolt_ class PFs, while the others carried 
various riders. Following the War, some of the _Rhines_ were reactivated 
to carry PFs, while others were used to carry disabled ships to shipyards.

Since the Alliance Navy uses _Rhines_ primarily as support ships in 
peaceful areas, those that remain in service are a very low priority for 
upgrades. As of 5650, there are no known refits of the class, although it 
has been rumoured that one ship has been modified for use as a technology 
demonstrator.

Those bored with me, or revolted by all this militaristic talk can
skip to the next item.  The rest of us can then make fun of you at our
leisure  (just kidding)  :-).

To continue:  What good are MCATs, MAFs and MABs?  Remember
that this was all designed for a pre-rebellion campaign.  The Imperium
had its share of enemies, but much of the IN and IMC\'s job was
internal peacekeeping.  Small firefighting units were a major element
of Imperial military doctrine.

In general, all groups (subsector fleets) would have at least one  MAF
available, either intact or divided and deployed as three MCATs.
The Sector Fleet would have a full corps of Line Marines available at
various bases, with their large troop transports, but the fleet would also
have a number of MABs available.  In unruly sectors, there might be 5 or 6 
MABs, while a small or quiescent sector might only have one or two.

In terms of deployment, I always gave each subsector at least 1 patrol
squadron.  This would consist of about a dozen destroyers or destroyer
escorts, with one escort carrier (a 25,000 ton carrier with a reinforced
wing of fighters) and some form of light cruiser (Gionetti or Azhanti
High Ligtning, depending on my mood).    This squadron would also
have either an intact MAF or 3 MCATs attached to it.  If the subsector
had multiple patrol squadrons (pirates, illegal alien problems),  the MCATs
might be split up among the squadrons or additional MAFs assigned.

The MAF/MCAT would be used in the usual "show the flag" operation
or as a rapid intervention team to defuse critical situations.  Such a 
deployment would also alert one or more of the fleet\'s MABs.  If a 
situation arose requiring a full MAB, that deployment would alert the
other MABs and the Line Marines in the sector.  If those forces are sent
in, the Sector Duke would probably need to seriously consider
mobilizing the IA.  Since MCATs, MAFs and MABs all have dedicated
transports, they could respond to any situation in a week or two, while
the Line Marines and IA forces are busy locating transports and stuffing
all their gear into cargo modules.  Anybody who has watched the US Army
trying to load one armored battalion onto a train will appreciate just
how long it takes to move such forces, even if some equipment is
pre-packed or prepositioned.

Anybody have any feedback?  Come on in, the water\'s fine.

PS - Regarding A. Langford\'s quest for non-metallic guns.  Have a
          look at some books on medieval sieges.  Many of the larger 
          bombards were made of wood, bound together with brass rings.
          I also think I remember a picture of a hand gun from that period
          made of similar materials.

PPS - This month\'s Popular Science has an article on Fuel Cells, which
             have caused me a certain amount of grief in my current TNE
             campaign.  One problem; the technology involves hydrogen
             and oxygen freed from water or methane, but FF&S says that
             fuel cells use hydrocarbons (gasoline to us non-chemists).  Can
             anybody shed some light on this?

Again, none of the above reflects the views of my employers.  No way,
no how.

This is some good work.  Thanks folks.

It seems we have a clear conflict here between rules sets.  The *5FW*
shows much smaller forces than both *TCS* and *POT* suggest is available.
Nevertheless, *5FW* is the only source of `official\' naval and army
forces.  On the other hand, the *POT* rules meet the `most recent\' criteria
*and* seem to be more comprehensive - dealing with space and planetary
forces.

The question to be resolved seems to be how do were rectify the current
rules (or *TCS* for that matter) when they suggest a world like Tizon in
the Sword Worlds could have dominated the entire battle field in the 5FW?

Yes, I think that\'s it.

Okay, here\'s where I diverge.  I was thinking more along the lines of
`economic\' strength, which I agree is tied to population, than mere naval
strength.  Keep in mind that Gram and Sacnoth are on the same order of
population (6 billion and 3 billion, respectively).  Narsil is at 20
billion but it\'s two TLs below Sacnoth.  Still, in a feudal technocracy,
one tech level is going to make a *tremendous* amount of difference.  (It\'s
like the difference between Japan and Mexico if Japan\'s economic power 
gave it corresponding political power in Mexico.)

I believe I\'ve accepted that these cycles *might* exist and that if they
do they would explain Gram\'s leadership of the Confederation.  My concern
has been that I can\'t see what *causes* these `techno-economic\' cycles
(since we\'ve agreed they have no `real world\' parallel) and that I don\'t
see how they explain the tech level disparities.

I feel that it takes more than just knowledge.  I don\'t care how much you
know about internal combustion engines, if you can\'t refine oil to make
gasoline and you don\'t have a continental highway network you\'re going
to have a rough time getting your Yugo or Hyundai from Houston to Detroit.
The knowledge may be there on a lower tech world but the corresponding
infrastructure isn\'t.

Please, Hans, I\'ve got a smile on my face right now and there is absolutely
no malice in it.  I\'m enjoying the living daylights out of our discussions.

Well, I think we\'re beginning to see there are some serious conflicts
between *5FW*, *TCS* and the TNE military forces per *POT*.

Hmmm, Steve Bonneville has reported:

Looks like there is a discrepancy *within* *5FW* between the counters (TL 11)
and the map board (TL 10).  Is this the case?

Well, maybe, but this doesn\'t agree with the campaign as it was reported in
*Spinward Marches Campaign*.  According to *SMC*, the Narsil Fleet patrolled
the Darrian border (and eventually lost the disputed worlds in Querion to
the Darrians) while the Sacnoth Fleet patrolled the rimward border and
was eventually destroyed by the Imperial 214th Fleet attacking from Glisten
and occupying what became the Border Worlds.  Note the Narsil Fleet was
deployed against the lower tech Darrians rather than the Imperial Navy.

Well, not exactly.  There are other similarities.  The whole feudal
technocracy thing.  The *JTAS* article on the former Sword Worlds naval
captain who\'s spouse/fiance was killed on their wedding day so she sold
the family estate to buy a ship and chase the killers - nothing more
than Lucas Trask in a dress!

I think this `liberation\' issue is merely a matter of when Piper was 
writing (early 60\'s) versus when GDW was creating Traveller (late 70\'s).
Remember, the GDW material makes a big deal of the `mis-treatment\' of
women in the Sword Worlds.  As Steve Bonneville points out:

>  much like Santanocheev.  [Incidentally, if her name is formed

I think there\'s a great deal of similarity between Piper\'s Sword Worlds
and GDW\'s Sword Worlds on the issue of how women are portrayed/treated.

Okay, but why suppose these still-unexplained cycles when they\'re not needed
to explain the disparity?  If the different economies are merely at
different stages of development (with higher TL being an indication of
greater `advancement\') there is no need of these cycles.  Then Zhodani aid,
already well established in the canonical material, explains why Gram has
lead the Confederation when one would expect more advanced (higher tech)
Sacnoth to do so.

Ah, but what about *all* those other worlds *outside* the Sword Worlds 
that aren\'t experiencing these cycles?  What `facts\' suggest the Sword
Worlds should be different from the rest of the universe?

Billions?  Really?  Can you cite the sources?  This is interesting from
our allegiance/borders viewpoint too.

No, they\'re not tighly entwined politically *and* economically like the
case would be in a feudal technocracy.  A better example would be, say,
California and, heck, all the other states west of the Rockies put
together.  When California wants federal water in Montana, it gets it.
Largely because of it\'s greater population (which also gives it a larger
economy) which gives it greater political power in the representative
democracy we have here.

> >If the economy is interstellar then political power in interstellar...

> I don\'t see how that follows.

By definition.  In a feudal technocracy, economic power translates *directly*
into political power.  You get to be `king\' because you control the largest
share of stock.

> > Sounds like the Japanese *keiritsu* to me.
> 
> Sounds like a slightly stronger European Union to me.

Yes, it does, except that in Europe representatives are chosen through a
representative democracy that places power in the hands of individuals
equally while in a feudal technocracy (and in the *keiritsu*) those
representatives are chosen by shareholders that place power in the hands
of the owners of production.

I agree.  I would explain this apparent conflict (it\'s a fact Gram has led
for a *long* time but it\'s someone\'s opinion that the Sworld Worlds are
`unstable\') as more cleverly-disguised Imperial propaganda.

[Has anyone realized how convenient this has become for GDW?  By clearly
placing some misleading information in published works (like the library
data in the *Imperial Encyclopedia* that was identified as having a SMART
bias) they (and we) can explain away just about any inconsistency at a
latter date.  Clever, or just lucky?]

Another good point, but it still begs the question of the Imperium not
`dealing with\' the Sword Worlds.

If I\'m Freya Freighters of Sacnoth and I buy a controlling interest in
Loki Levitation of Gram I have not only gained economic influence on Gram
but *political* power as well.  Since, at TL 12, I\'m clearly the strongest
economic power then I\'m going to gain more and more of this sort of
control.  As soon as the King Harald of Sacnoth (thanks, Cynthia) buys
a controlling interest in the holdings of King Angus of Gram, Angus 
becomes Harald\'s *vassal*!  That\'s how a feudal technocracy works.

Some really good stuff, Hans.  BTW, I think you\'ve got the *ihatei* situation
pegged exactly.

Hi Steve,

I wish I could say you are... but. You aren\'t. When GDW-beta list was
playing around with the pre-release stuff we had on FFS (precious little)
it became clear VERY quickly that the most effecient drive that still
fit within reality was the Fusion Rocket - and aside from it\'s nasty side
effects is a beautiful deep-space drive. I designed a number of ships
from that system, and planetary landings aside, Fusion is the best bet.

	Interesting idea, but neither of the submarines I was on did this. 
We just threw the CO2 overboard, and got our O2 by splitting seawater.

	Well, no.  Not really.  Actually, in terms of fuel usage, it is
SLIGHTLY better than the fusion rocket.  But it will never be used if
fusion rockets are available, unless you can live with small
fractional-G acceleration.

	I thought of this a while back.  Military vessels designed by me (as

INSTEAD of Heplar.

	I wish that whichever idiot gave GDW that definition of "point-blank
range" had kept his ignorant mouth shut...
	"point-blank range" has absolutely NOTHING to do with height of the
gun above the ground.  It has much more to do with the little known
detail that bullets, upon leaving the barrel of any gun, rise above the
line of the barrel by a small amount.  Point-blank range is the range
that the bullet has dropped BACK down to the line of the barrel after
that rise.
	Consider this, btw.  If you use GDW\'s definition of point-blank
range, then almost by definition, an anti-aircraft gun of a given muzzle
velocity will have a longer point-blank range than an anti-tank gun of
the same muzzle velocity (the anti-tank gun sits low to the ground
(maybe 2 ft up), while the AA gun sits higher up (typically 5-8 ft, back
when we built AA guns))...

	More thinly populated???  The SW have around 30 gigapeople in them,
all reasonably high tech. Regina subsector can only claim about 7
gigapeople, Rhylanor about 25, Vilis less than 10...
	Plus, of course, the 50-200 ships per subsector is ridiculously low
BY TCS STANDARDS.  In my game, Neubayern had several thousand warships,
New Colchis had more like 10,000 ships.  All the Islands together
amounted to about the resource base of the SW, and collectively, they
could muster over 1000 warships in the 50,000T+ range, plus a few more
thousand in the 10,000-50,000T range, plus another bunch in the
1000-10,000T range, plus fighters (a total of over 100,000 fighters in
the Islands).
	Besides all that, if you assume only 40-odd major Sword Worlds
warships, then the SW are in the same position the Islands were in when
the game began: any squadron of Tigresses could beat up their Naval
Forces all by itself.  Frankly, any single Tigress could beat up the SW
Fleet if it is only 40 major combatants...


> It may be hard to imagine but it\'s consist with canonical material.

	Do yourself a favour, and learn to ignore canonical material when it
is clearly pretty stupid.  Regina may have had 10 400T SDBs, but if it
did, ask yourself "Why?"
	There is no military use for them (any of Neubayern\'s Flower class
escorts (of which there were more than a thousand) could take all ten
SDBs at once.
	There is no real civilian use for them (other than to let pirates
run amok through the Regina system) - remember that Regina orbits a gas
giant, and has a HUGE jump-limit to patrol - thye couldn\'t patrol it
adequately with ten of ANYTHING, much less SDBs that are no match for a
well-equipped pirate.
	Customs cutters?  They\'d need more than ten, given that large
jump-limit, unless Regina has civilian traffic amounting to no more than
30-40 ships per day arriving/departing.  And if that is all the civilian
traffic Regina has, then Regina\'s starport must be smaller than the port
of New Orleans...


> It\'s clear from *5FW* that SDBs depend upon world population (although

	There were designer\'s notes for FFW in one of the Journals...

	Au contraire, mon vieux...Impy doctrine (which is frankly idiotic)
assumes that the battle for the gas giant between the enemy fleet and
your SDBs will be the crucial part of the defense of any system.  It is
SUPPOSED to prevent the enemy from refueling before your Fleet can reach
the GG where they arrived, thus allowing you to pound them into bloody
paste before they can escape.
	Admittedly, this isn\'t worth a pile of warm spit in terms of Naval
Doctrine.  I point out, for those who are interested, that in only ONE
case in my TCS game did a Fleet jump in to a gas giant, rather than
arriving at the 100 diameter limit of the main world.  And that one case
came because the attacker wanted the enemy to know he was coming, so as
to cause the enemy to be deceived as to the objective of the attack.
	In all other cases, the ships jumped in using drop tanks (and aso
arrived with enough fuel to leave, if they had to), and arrived at the
100 diameter limit, thus allowing the target only an hour or two warning
before the attack began for a response to be formed...

	Faced with defeat by Ihatei?!?   What a concept!!!  I suppose
Regina\'s ten 400T SDBs might be faced with defeat by Ihatei, if the
Ihatei could get in that far, but I find it hard to believe that any
_important_ Impy force could be defeated by the Ihatei...
	Can someone out there design a TL14 ship of no more than 30,000T
that can fight off an attack by an Impy BatRon as long as there are at
least 100 of them present?  I admit that using TNE rules, this is much
more possible than it was under either HG or MT, but it is still pretty
unlikely...

    One of the things that happened after High Guard came out was a 
major change in the sizes and numbers of Naval vessels cruising about. 
For pre-High Guard CT, 10 400-ton SDBs WAS a major defense force -- 
and a 400-ton patrol cruiser was a real warship, and the Kinunir 
(1200-tons) WAS a Cruiser capable of subduing anything in the 
subsector.  Post-High Guard and "Supplement 9: Fighting Ships" (the 
REAL "Fighting Ships"), 10 SDBs was a joke, not a force.  The Kinunir 
becomes a light escort, comparable (loosely) with the Chyrsanthemum 
and Fer-de-Lance class escorts.  If you are playing in a High 
Guard/MT/TNE universe, do not take anything from early JTAS or very 
early supplements about Naval strength as "canonical".  The "canonical" 
material isn\'t self-consistent; it was composed over at least two 
different "world-views".  You have to decide which world-view you are 
using, and throw out the material that is inconsistent with that view.

    I have been assuming a post-High Guard+ worldview.  It is 
possible, even likely, that the apparent inconsistency between TCS 
strengths and 5FW counters relates to the shift in Naval strength 
between pre-and post-High Guard.  Did 5FW come out before or after 
High Guard?

    I believe that the WAR!  issue of JTAS had designer\'s notes for 
5FW, and how to derive your own defense batallions and SDB strengths.  
Unfortunately, I don\'t have it with me today to look up.  

    Many aspects of Imperial doctrine appear to have be thought up by 
someone who never played a TCS (or similar Naval warfare) campaign; 
they just don\'t work in practice.  For instance, after some TCS 
campaigning, it turns out that the Battlerider/Battleship controversy 
is a non-issue:  if your enemy does not have meson weapons, use 
Battleships, because the jump drive allows you to get your expensive 
hull and jump drive away when your guns and M-drive have been 
crippled, and if he does have meson weapons, use Battleriders because 
a meson hit is just as likely to cripple the J-drive as any other 
system.  With the battleships just as likely to be lost as the 
battlerider, the battlerider\'s ability to carry more weaponry, 
screens, armor and fighters makes a difference.  Proper doctrine 
reduces the vulnerability of the tender -- it should either be fully 
combat capable, or stay the hell away from the battlefield.  

    I think that real Imperial Naval officers, who have 10,000 years 
of space combat experience to draw on, would use doctrines based on 
that experience, that make sense; therefore, I regard most of what was 
said regarding Imperial Naval doctrine in JTAS and Challenge as so 
much hogwash.

Any suggestions for a name for this gun?  

John Bogan <john.bogan@asb.com> replied to me:

The Garnett

That gun was designed by Guy Garnett (Wildstar@quark.qrc.com), longtime 
TML member and coordinator of the TNE-Pocket sublist and admin of the GDW-
Beta sublist.  

GDW-Beta was formed to test some of the design sequences in FF&S, and 
Guy tried to re-create a real-life Soviet anti-tank rifle from the 1930\'s (PK
something)
using the small arms design rules.  Upon seeing the result, he called it the
"poor man\'s fusion gun".  POT describes its use EXACTLY as he envisioned.


Guy also has a regular column, "House Rules", in _The Traveller Chronicle_,
a new Traveller magazine now gearing up for its fifth issue.


I say give credit where credit is due.  The Garnett Gun it is.

Iwo Lyon				Born 1180  Giga, Frontier
Str-7  Agl-A  Con-8  Int-6  Edu-4  Chr-5  Soc-4
Iwo was born and grew up on the planet Giga which is located in the 
region of sparse stellar population at the edge of NeoSol subsector known 
as the frontier.  When he was 12 raiders? or a scout force from an 
mini empire across the frontier raided his Windrider village.  Led by a 
man known only as Gushmegne, they massacred almost everyone they could 
find including Iwo\'s father, mother and brothers.  In 1193 he was found 
by a NeoSol Federation Scout wandering through the desert regions of Giga 
in a catatonic state.  The scout took him in and carried him back to his 
home on the planet Aurigae.  The trauma on Giga had awakened Iwo\'s 
nascent Psi abilities and contact with a secret order on Aurigae served 
to develop them further.  The members of this order are the gaurdians of 
a merging of Psi Abilities and Martial Arts known simply as The Way.  
There are 5 facets of the way that are inherent in an individual just as 
Psionic abilities are inherent.  Trauma and training awaken them.  When 
the Union of Senled invaded Nemo in 1198 his adoptive family was killed 
by a ballistic missile attack(conventional) on their home city.  This 
trauma awakened the second way in Iwo.  After this he joined the crew of 
a far trader owned and operated by BJ Eyzaguirre.  He has used this 
position to smuggle TL 10 weapons to the TL 6,7 Nemon National League.  
His life filled with tradgedy he no longer smiles and always has a look 
on intensity on his face.  He has devoted himself to practicing the two 
Ways he knows and seeks adventure to awaken the others.  He also will 
look for ways to assist the Nemon National League and hates any 
representative of the Union of Senled.  

Iwos conventional skills should be appropriate to a junior spacehand.
Added to these skills
UAMA-6 Stealth-3  Riding-2

****Iwo only has experience with the first two ways****

The Five Facets of the Way are
1)The Way of the Shining Path( Hand Strike -4)
  Microtelekenesis combined with hand strikes, gives a hand strike some  
  penetration ability.  Say Pen of 2 if it penetrates then does full 
damage, otherwise no damage.

2)Way of the Breeze (Enhanced Stealth treat as Stealth-8)
This way enables the user to move about being very difficult to see or hear

3)Way of the Comet (Super Speed)
Using teleportation this allows super fast movement.  Say Psi Level * 
10m/turn) 

4)The Way of the Hurricane (TK Blast)
This is simply an area effect TK Blast of great power.  Car flipper, wall 
buckler at higher levels.

5) The Awareness of Reality (Ultimate Way--Masters Only)
The Awareness of reality is the most difficult and possibly the most 
powerful way.  It enables the practitioner to "fold" things in and out of 
reality.  It is in a sense sort of a PsiTransfer that functions as a 
black globe sort of thing.  It absorbs energy impacting it (up to some 
max) and the user can store this energy of short periods of time then 
dumping it into his or her own Psi based attacks, actions etc.  I havent 
quite figured out how to formulate this but suggestions are welcome.  
Just like a globe it can be overloaded and prevents communication across 
it.  This included Psi communication?  

Each way requires one combat action to activate and pulls from some pool 
of UAMA and Psi-Level.  I havent had the chance to really sit down and 
work this out in detail but I have the main idea pretty much to my 
satisfaction.  I think that I havent introduced anything in direct conflict 
with any era of traveller.  It certainly adds an element of space opera 
to the universe.  Can you imagine Masters of the Way battling it out in 
some high port while the PCs get caught in the middle.  I know some of 
you might say I should play champions for this but as I said there is no 
direct conflict with the Traveller Universe here and I think it adds to 
my campaign (at least in my head).

Solon Maghib enlisted in the Navy at the age of 17 where he soon 
expressed an interest and aptitude for the Special forces.  He joined the 
SPACR (Space Planetary and Atmospheric Combat Regiment) at the end of his 
first term and distinguished himself.  At the end of his 2nd term he was 
selected to attend OCS.  Graduating from there he was soon promoted to 
the rank of Sub-Lt.  Much of his activity is classified but he did 
recieve a commendation for his part in closing down the Gamma project.  A 
geneering experiment initiated by a private consortiun whose subjects 
where kidnapped from low tech worlds.  During his 4th term his family was 
killed in the well known Icarus incident where the Destroyer Icarus 
vented its thrusters inside a docking bay killing 518 people. (See Ammel 
Brodrig)  He left the Navy at the end of this term and move to Enope 
where he spent his time carving stone and wood, living off of the land.  
While on one of his treks through the wilderness of Enope he discovered a 
diamond.  It was not long after that he was framed for murders of two 
junior constables.  The local  Chief Constable Ulysses Stark was on the case 
and he discovered evidenve that Solon did not commit the murder.  It was 
Aaron Nessus, the son of a man who was regionally(planetwise) powerful.  
The Constable came upon Nessus holding Solon at gunpoint bragging about 
how he framed him for the murders.  When U Stark ordered him to drop the 
weapon Nessus instead aimed for the Constable, He was shot dead by The 
Constable U Stark.  Far from being heros both Solon and U Stark found 
life very difficult on Enope after that.  When given the oppurtunity to 
leave Solon joined Amara Adan of NeoSol Systems Corp and her Corporate 
Action Team.  

From an interview of Solon Maghib by a local news service on Enope

For some reason people have this concept that the SPACR drops from orbit 
on top of the enemy and starts blazing away. Wrong.  Thats very unlikely 
and happens only when something has gone very wrong.  We are much more 
likely to spend two weeks hiding in the rafters of some warehouse on a 
clandestine spotting and observation mission.  You never know when 
there\'s one of us around.  Could be one reading this over your shoulder 
right now.  Don\'t look! too late you\'re DEAD!  They teach us so much, but 
they don\'t teach us how to cope back in the real world.  When my family 
was killed in the Icarus incident.  I broke from what I thought was 
real.  I left the Navy and moved to Enope where I formed reality from 
stone and wood through sculpture...

Been thinking about the portrayal of the Sword Worlders in the official

on the Sword Worlders from *JTAS* #18.

On the status of women:

"Sword Worlds society is militaristic and male-dominated, women having a
much more subordinate position than in the Imperium."

Sounds bad, right?  Here\'s the specifics:

"Almost without exception, men fill important public offices, business
positions, and high military commands.  While women are not legally or
culturally prohibited from any occupation, any woman in a `male\' profession
is expected to exhibit male rather than female behavior (at least in public).
The reverse, however, is not true.  Men may never exhibit female behaviors
(in public at least) without losing face."

Sounds more like the US today, or at least in 1970.

On the instability of Sword Worlds governments and interworld rivalry
let\'s look at the historical timeline:

- -189  First interstellar government, the Sacnoth (or First) Dominate, formed.
- -102  First Dominate falls in First War of Rebellion, various individual
      and multiworld governments exist.
 104  Triple Dominion formed
 217  Triple Dominion falls, again various smaller governments prevail.
 604  Second Dominate formed after First Frontier War.
 698  Gram Coalition overthrows Second Dominate
 788  Trilateral Alliance replaces Gram Coalition after loss in Darrian War.
 848  Trilateral Alliance falls, replaced by Gram government four years
      later.
1110  Border Worlds break-off after Imperial occupation following the 
      Fifth Frontier War.

Thus, we have six governments ruling for over 700 years over a period
of nearly 1300 years (not counting the Border Worlds).  Prior to the
current government (c1110) at Gram each Sword Worlds government lasted
an average of approximately 90 years - three generations, which is pretty
good for a feudal system.  The most recent government had existed for
over 260 years by 1110!  The interregnum between the current government
and the previous one was only four years.  There was virtually no
interregnum in the two government changes prior to the last one which
means the Sword Worlds have had a single interstellar government, albeit
with changes in the seat of government, almost continuously since the
Second Dominate was formed in 604 - over half a millenia and nearly half
the life of the Third Imperium!

Imperial propaganda: "a battle for the hearts and minds" indeed!

I too felt a little uncomfortable with the religious comparisons made a
while back.  I think a good rule to follow when considering making some
comment about another group is to consider a similar comment made
about the corresponding group that you identify with.  You might have
a little insight then into what you might be doing to someone else.

If you must have a group to `put upon\' stick with fictional ones like
those "dirty, stinkin\' Zhos" or those nutty Gilgameshers.

Thanks!

For your enjoyment, here is the original design and commentary.  PLEASE NOTE
that this item was written PRIOR to the publication of FF&S, and that
I haven\'t corrected the FF&S stats for this gun from the PRELIMINARY
version of FF&S, so the FF&S design IS NOT CORRECT as stated below.  The gun
as given in _Path of Tears_ and _RCES Equipment Guide_ *HAS* been corrected
to the final version of FF&S, and is as correct as the rules allow.

Personally, I prefer the "real world" stats, which are provably more correct
than any of the FF&S-generated information.  The second column of the design
table below gives the actual values for the real-world gun, as accurately as
I have been able to determine them.  Feel free to use these in place of the
FF&S statistics.

If a lot of the following sounds familiar to purchasers of _Path of Tears_,
well, this materials was used (with permission) by GDW for both POT and the
_RCES Equipment Guide_.



- ----8<---- The following is a post originally dated October 29, 1993:

This is (yet another) small arms design; tonite I\'ll knock off of the
small arms and see if I can design a Ilyushin Il2m3 (better known as
the Shturmovik) to check out the aircraft design sequences.  That plane\'s
armor should be, um, challenging, in the FF&S system.

No longer do your TL-5, xenophobic natives have to cower in fear of
Reformation Coalition backed Star Vikings.  Have the local warlord call
up a few squads of these "poor man\'s fusion guns".  With Ball ammunition
(locally producable at TL-5), they can penetrate TL-10 Battle Dress and any
Combat Armor.  With DS ammunition (a TL-8 item), these weapons have damage 
and penetration equal to (or better than, particularly at longer ranges)
the FGMP-14 and FGMP-15 and can effectively defeat all forms of personal
armor, as well as the side, deck, belly, and turret armor of the G-Carrier
and the Grav Tank.  

Given their relative low cost, particularly when compared to their high-tech 
opponents Battle Dress (Cr220,000) and Fusion Gun (Cr54,000), these weapons 
are clearly very cost-effective.

Notes:
1 - Whenever two figures are given, the first is for ball (an option for
Armor-Piercing Incendiary would have been nice) and the second is for the
"high-tech" (TL-8) Discarding Sabot round.
2 - Figuring the internal magazine as a box magazine that\'s permanently
attached to the weapon.  I\'m also using the grams to kilograms "fix" that
I mentioned in my first weapon design.

Comments: Yes, this really was a real gun.  Originally designed as a man
portable, anti-tank small arms rifle by the Soviets during WWII, the gun
was quickly outclassed by the rapidly improving armor protection of
German tanks.  The cartridge lives on as the ammuntion for the TL-6 KPV
machinegun (found on many Soviet armored vehicles and anti-aircraft
defenses).  The gas-operated action of this rifle (scaled down, of course)
found its way into the SKS rifle.

All in all, I\'m not really very happy with this FF&S design; the weapon
came out more than twice as heavy as it should have (a hundred-and-fifteen
pound rifle).  I think the problem here is that the FF&S design system is
too linear; if you push on the high end, you get guns that are much too big 
and heavy, and if you push on the low end, you get things like 10mm (cal) 
by 3mm (long) cartridges and guns that are much too light.

I note that the two biggest contributors to the weight of this gun are the
receiver and the bipod.  Both of these are directly proportional to the
muzzle energy of the weapon.  One (probably the bipod) or both of these
formulae are definitely wrong.  One "fix" might be to make the bipod a
multiple of the mass of the weapon (probaby 1/10th the mass of the weapon,
minimum 1kg) instead of basing it on muzzle energy.


Tactical Considerations:
The close range of this weapon exceeds the extreme range of every fusion
gun except the FGMP-14 and -15, and the short range equals or exceeds the
extreme range of any of the fusion guns.  The best use of these weapons
would be long-range fire at the attackers, from behind cover (preferably
cover strong enough to resist an extreme-range fusion gun strike) or
sniping from outside the range of their weapons.  If this is impossible 
(and it frequently is), then a series protected positions likeley to suprise 
the enemy are good (around a corner in a corridor, for example).

Game Use:
This weapon (or rather, one using the "real world" stats and not the FF&S
design, which is completely impractical) could be quite useful to anti-RC
forces in the New Era.  A relatively low-tech design, it is quite capable
of being manufactured by many worlds in the Wilds.  Although the DS
ammunition is probably going to be considerably harder to produce, there
will probably be a number of worlds equipped with it.  As Star Viking
activities expand, it is very likeley that traders operating in the wilds
will find a demand for this type of weapon.

Several adventure plotlines are possible around this weapon; one which 
suggests itself to me is probably obvious.  The players (RCES or \'Lancers) 
attempt a smash-n-grab on some TL-5 to TL-7 dictator.  They expect an easy 
time of it.  Pull this one on your players after they\'ve done two or three 
of the same type of missions in a row and have had a chance to get 
overconfident and complacent.  Suprise them with the weapon; without the DS 
ammunition, it shouldn\'t be too deadly, but should (if employed well) be 
able to prevent the PCs from accomplishing some or all of their objectives.  
Drive home to them in a practical sort of way how difficult their lives 
would be if lots of worlds had them.  Later developments in the campaign can
involve efforts to stop free traders from spreading the guns (or the designs)
around the area.  Another one might have to do with discovering that someone
is producing DS ammunition.

- ----8<---- End of original post.


An interesting additional scenario or plot complication has occurred to me
since then.  POT and RCESEG use the FF&S stats for this weapon, which place
it at over a hundred pounds - considerably heavier than the \'real thing\',
and severely limiting mobility with the weapon.  One option would be to
assume that the version of the weapon that is being distributed throughout
the wilds by Free Traders has been considerably over-engineered (making it
even *more* rugged, reliable, dirt-tolerant and generally idiot-proof that
is usual for even a Soviet weapon).  Considering that most of the metal
parts are probably about twice as thick as they need to be, you could
probably club someone with it and not loose accuracy.  The thing should be
easy to field-strip, easy to maintain, and shouldn\'t malfunction even under
considerable provocation.

Once the players think that they\'ve got the drawbacks of this weapon
identified, you can spring the \'lightweight\' version on them.  This would be
the \'real world\' weight weapon, and is considerably more portable than the
FF&S version.  A logical place to do this would be to decide that some world
at around TL-5 or TL-6 invented this weapon on its own, for native use.  It
would also be a bit more fragile than the \'heavy\' version, requiring some
skill in its use to keep it in top working order.

One final caveat when using this gun in a RC campaign (particularly in one
based on scenarios in _Path of Tears_).  The POT sourcebook also contains
some RCES \'improved\' armor, with an armor value of 6 (probably specifically
designed by the RC to protect against this gun).  While this is a reasonable
thing for the RC to do, it\'s worth a second thought for a role-playing
campaign.

With AV-6 armor, RC troops are relatively well (although not perfectly)
protected against the gun, significantly reducing the threat to your PCs.
This is good, in that PCs won\'t die, but bad in that to increase the level
of the threat you (as referee) have only one option: to introduce DS
ammunition.  This will unfortunately increase the amount of damage the gun
can do to PC-deadly levels.  The "average" damage would be 21 points (33 if
you roll D10s for damage the way I do).

I personally recommend AV-5 combat armor against the ball-equipped gun.
This will allow 2 dice of damage through, which is a crediable threat but
one unlikely to kill PCs with a single shot.  Use the (rare and expensive)
DS ammunition against vehicular and battle dress equipped targets with an AV
of around 8 to 10.  Again, the idea is to provide a credible threat without
an inordinate risk killing PCs with a single lucky shot.  An average of 7
(11 with d10 damage dice) points is enough to make anybody sit up and take
notice, but not so much that they\'ll be dead before they can react.

I realize that, as the referee, you can \'save\' any PCs you feel like by
rolling a disproportinate number of misses, assigning hits to NPCs, or even
managing to throw 6 dice and not roll any number higher than a two (aren\'t
referee screens wonderful devices?).  But having to do this (or the reverse,
and consistently giving all the \'breaks\' to the bad guys) indicates a poor
scenario design or a poor balance between the PCs and the opposition.
Sooner or later the PCs will catch on, and it\'ll be bad for both their
morale and for theis suspension of disbelief.  It\'s better to get it right
in the first place than to have to make \'fixes\' for the rest of your
campaign.


Well, there you have it - the Garnett Gun.  Enjoy!

The _Dinimbue_-class express boat, or "xboat", has been used by the
IISS Communications Office for centuries as one of the workhorses of
the Imperial communications network.  Optimized for their job, the 
ships are unsuited for almost any task besides carrying electronic
xmail.  The ship carries extensive databanks and a powerful and 
triply backed-up maser communicator.  Only one communicator is
meant to be powered at a time; the radio is for emergencies and
xboat tender retrieval operations only.  The class is named after
the professor at the University of Sylea who, in 624, designed the
infamous "Poni Express" insignia which has since adorned all IISS 
Communications Office ships and crews.

DESIGNER\'S NOTES:  This is an attempt to capture the spirit of
the old CT xboat design using the FF&S/Brilliant Lances ship design
rules.  Since any size ship may now carry jump drives, the ship
was simply reduced in size by a factor of five, to the minimum
possible size.  The ship is state-of-the-art for the late 600s
Imperial, when the xboat net was started.  To accurately reflect
the high proportion of fuel to cargo, those hits have been spelled
out explicitly in the damage table rather than using the standard
"Hold" result.  (Typical practice in my designs...a little more
realistic.)  Since the sensors are a bit sub-par (which seems to
fit well with the concept and GDW\'s typical designs), I assume that 
the tender has a beacon which makes it easy for the xboat to
to center its\' commaser.  The old "80% for quantity purchase of
class ships discount" is applied in parentheses under price.
Like the classic xboat, it\'s a sitting duck.

But according to the only _Traveller_ rules we have on the subject (_TCS_)
technology _dosn\'t_ make that much difference. If you look at the credit 
conversion table you\'ll see that the credits of two worlds with the same 
starport type (which I take in this context to mean the same level of trade)
differ by only 5% per TL. Now, I\'m not an economics major. Perhaps that
notion is as ridiculous as some of the mistakes that I am able to spot. 
But since I don\'t know any better I\'m arguing from those tables. With
twice the population of Sacnoth Gram is nearly twice as powerful as Sacnoth
economically.

We don\'t agree on that. We have plenty of real world parallels for economic
cycles. Since we agree that a lower-than-15 TL can only be due to economic
reasons, economic instability _should_ result in TL instability. (Btw. I\'m
not so sure we don\'t have any examples of that. Didn\'t some farmers put
their cars in the barn and go back to the horse waggon during the Great
Depression?).

Make that steamships instead and you have a better analogy, since the ships
of space don\'t need any highways. Even if you can\'t produce boiler plates
you may still be able to rivet them together when they come apart.

No offense taken. I do mean that, but I also direct you to the word \'try\'.
If different sources disagree we have to choose between them, and in most 
cases I\'d be inclined to choose the role-playing source over the board
game source. I\'d be happier if we could reconcile them, but it\'s just not
possible. _TCS_ gives much bigger fleets than is present in 5FW.

I had forgotten that. OK, consider the above retracted. 5FW forces are just
generally understrength.

I said \'little more\'. You\'re right on both above counts. But Elaine would
have had no chance of going Space Viking from Piper\'s Gram if Lucas had
been the one killed. That \'nothing more\' is quite a lot.

I think so too, but what\'s that got to do with it? It _is_ a pretty
significant difference between the two societies.

Mistreatment? Men and women are assigned different roles in society,
thereby denying some women the chance to fulfill their potential (and
some men too, btw.) That\'s not good, but I wouldn\'t call it mistreatment.
On top of that women have a safety valve in that they are accepted in 
\'male\' roles provided they adopt \'male\' behaviour. Males are never
accepted in \'female\' roles.

As Steve Bonneville points out:

Nothing contradictory in that. Riksdattar is a female accepted in a \'male\'
role. And apparently she\'s really accepted, not just tolerated (Either
that or she\'s the daughter of a king. \'Rik\' is a nordic name, but it
could also mean \'realm\').

I think there\'s quite some difference.

Except to explain why it took Gram 14 centuries to go from TL 12 to TL 11.
OK, there\'s been some civil wars in between, but they\'ve had centuries
since the 3FW. This _could_ be explained by a slow, steady, uneventful
economic rise over the centuries with, say, a TL per two centuries. Or
it could be an economic roller-coaster that pulls one world two steps
back every time it get one step ahead. Personally, knowing how today\'s
industrial magnates love to screw around with each other, the second
picture seems much more likely than the first.

First of all, how do you know they haven\'t? Regina was settled in 75. It 
was TL 10 in 1105. It was TL 11 or 12 in 1120, wasn\'t it? (I haven\'t the
books with me here and may be misremembering). Why did Regina gain one
or no TLs in 10 centuries and one more in 15 years? It dosen\'t make much
sense if you assume that TLs always increase or stagnate (barring wars).
It makes perfect sense if TLs rise and fall over the centuries.
Secondly, even if the Imperium _is_ stable there could be a very good
reason for that: Imperial control. The Sword Worlds have a political
machine, a commitee, to rule them. The Imperium has a single authority
who can shift things around to keep the economy more or less stable 
whoever it may hurt in the short run. The Confederation Council has to
take short term hurts into consideration.

Where did you get that definition? I mean, if you made it up yourself you\'re
begging the question. I admit that I\'m vague about just how a feudal
technocracy works, but isn\'t that because it\'s a term GDW made up (Or lifted
from some SF book?)? Or is there some dictionary definition of the term? 
Have there ever been a formal feudal technocracy in Real Life? 

>You get to be `king\' because you control the largest share of stock.

In a feudal society you get to be king because you have the support of the
great lords. In theory you gets that support because you own the land and
lend it to the great lords in return for their sworn support (In practice
the great lords often control the land whatever the King wants).

By analogy a feudal technocracy is one where the King theoretically owns
all the industry (the source of power analogous to land in a feudal
society) and lend it out in exchange for support. In practice many great
lords propably control their \'fiefs\' whatever the King wants.

What you are describing is a corporate government, not a feudal one. In a
feudal government power (in this case, ownership of shares) flows from the 
top to the bottom. What you describe is power flowing from the bottom (the 
individual shares) to the top.

After the 3FW the Imperium dealt with the Sword Worlds by invading them.
Later a different administration decided that the occupation was either
unnecessary ("They\'ll never dare do anything again, not in a thousand 
years"), or just too expensive, or both. The 4FW was settled by negotiations
and one proviso must certainly be that the Imperium did not retaliate
against the Sword Worlds. And after the 5FW they again dealt with the 
Sword Worlds, this time by setting up a puppet governmnt on half of them.
I just don\'t understand how you can say that they didn\'t deal with them.
They\'ve dealt with them at least twice.

Granted, but the only way you can get that influence is if the king of
Gram allows you to buy that controlling interest. Remember the \'feudal\'
in the government class. The king theoretically _owns_ those shares and
what you pay for must be the right to benefit from them. And one of the
things you must pay with is the promise to support him. So it\'s even
possible that King Harald will not allow you to invest in anything on
Gram.

Is it? Perhaps our first step should be to define just what a feudal
technocracy is and how it works.

<bing!> Wrong, but thanks for playing. See FF&S page 70, column 2, para
3, "FC"; "Fuel consumption, in tonnes, per hour per tonne of thrust."
                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So the Fusion Rocket line should actually be:

Fusion rocket   9.0 ton   0.00035 ton/hr.     0.000350 ton/hr

This makes the Daedalus slightly better, but still nothing like an order
of magnitude.

What REALLY worries me, though, is the fuel efficiency of AZHRAE
engines.  Has anyone actually tried to design a tech 8 surface-to-orbit
vehicle (NASP or similar)?  As far as I can see, it\'s not actually
possible to carry enough fuel to make orbit from an Earth-sized world.
(I\'ll go into details of the calculation only if necessary.)  Does
anybody have a fully-worked design for something of this sort?

Mea culpa -- you caught me making an overly broad statement.  Let me
try that line again:
  "First, viruses *tend* to be very species specific."

Both influenza and rabies are examples of multi-species virii.
As far as I know, however, they are still both limited to class
Mammalia.  Influenza is unstable genetically, which is why there
are so many flu strains and why coming up with effective vaccines
is so hard.  Bubonic plague is caused by a bacterium, _Yersinia
pestis_ (unless they\'ve changed their mind about the genus again),
so it\'s a slightly different story.  Many non-viral microorganisms
could be expected to have effects in alien ecologies that are 
chemically similar to our own, especially those involved in 
decomposition.  The bacteria and fungi work directly on the
chemical structure of an organism, giving them a lot of food
opportunities.  

Viruses are another story.  Typically, viruses have a "host range"
of organisms they can infect, and usually this range is limited
to one species.  From what I recall, a virus targets it\'s quarry
based on the chemical antigens and structure of the surface of the
preferred cell.  (So HIV attacks certain white-blood cells, but 
not, for example, nerve cells.)  So a virus will typically be 
optimized to attack one specific sub-system, and sometimes the 
optimization is very very specific.  The viruses that attack
multiple species are usually targeting very similar cell types.

Furthermore, the target cell needs to be able to interact with
the DNA or RNA strand the virus releases.  If the alien isn\'t
DNA/RNA based, or simply can\'t produce the parts the virus needs
for construction, the infection won\'t work.

There are usually subtle differences between cells even in similar
species, especially at the cell membrane level viruses use to
recognize potential targets.

Conceivably, a virus designed to affect all Terran mammals could
infect the vargr, since vargr are Terran mammals, and members of
a genus in class Mammalia related to _Canis_.  But all external
similarities aside, a human should be more closely related 
genetically to a strand of kelp than to an aslan, or any other
alien.  (In Traveller this may not be true.  But then, the aliens
in Traveller are more science-fantasy than reality, of course.)

Targeting specific species would be simpler.  You just have to
pick a cell type unique to the population that you are targeting.
This sort of thing might make a horror like a disease that prefers
Vilani or Zhodani, for the most part, possible.  You really
couldn\'t *trust* such a thing, since the human minor races are so
closely related, but someone might try.

I suppose one could speculate about the existence of a Lucanian
biowar weapon that did target several species, not necessarily a
virus, that mainly was meant to nail humans.  That might have some
interesting effects on future history -- the former territory of
the Imperium might end up being dominated by a number of very 
non-human alien species that were unaffected by the weapon and
thus lucked into ready-made pocket empires early on.  Some of 
the nastier may have even helped the weapon along....

Yuck.  This is getting ugly.  As far as I know, the Imperium
never used CBW, although they did stockpile some in the Marches
during the bitter Third Frontier War.  The Second Empire of
Gashikan did mount a particularly despicable attempt at 
xenocide in the -1400s (31st century AD) against the entire
vargr species, using a series of microbes.  The vargr stopped
it, but almost all the vargr in Gashikan sector died.  It was
the worst part of a long series of interspecies wars set off
by the Sack of Gashikan in -1658 (AD 2860).  Note that only
the vargr were targeted.  An Ancient biowar weapon seriously
depopulated Zhdant, but it was targeted primarily at the world\'s
(now extinct) Droyne population...and who knows *how* it worked;
it was an Ancients weapon.  (Besides, it was out of character.
Not only did it not kill all the humans, it was misdelivered
and didn\'t hit right until after the Zhodani had space-flight.
Usually Ancient weapons seem to hit whatever they attacked, and
destroy whatever they hit.)

Discussions of the viability of the GDW VIRUS are similar to discussions
of the existence of God: there are two sides and neither can be
conclusively argued.

Possibly VIRUS is not properly named, or is the common reference used
for what is involved.  This is similar to my work at a wastewater
treatment plant - we use bacteria and algae to treat wastewater but most
of the workers refer to these biological organisms as \'bugs\' which they
are not.

From my understanding the VIRUS was developed from research of a silicon
life form.  This life form is completely unlike anything that exists on
Earth in 1994 so we, the members of TML, may very well have gross
misconceptions of this beastie.  This life form seems to exist as
computer code that is able to burn new circuits much as we can construct
various forms of habitats to increase our quality of life.  In so doing
this VIRUS, as it is called by the humans whose computers it has taken
control of, has decided to use those computers to control the various
forms of equipment in meeting an agenda of its own.

If this were merely a computer virus it well could be said to be
unbelievable.  Even as it is I feel that GDW simply used it as a plot
device to bring about the transition from MT to TNE (I wonder if thios
much banter goes on re. the transition from TSR\'s AD&D (TM) to the 2nd
edition rules?

Ulysses Stark grew up on Arizona Dawn in one of the more populous 
cities.  He enlisted in the NeoSol Confederation Marines at the age of 17 
and served as an autogunner, MP and various other duties.  In 1189 
Ulysses, along with a hand (platoon) of Marines were stranded on a 
frontier  planet due to an accident/oversight.  He and his team evaded 
hostile locals for 16 months before being befriended by one group of 
nomads.  The people there talked about something called "Helios?"  The 
lost platoon was rescued in late 1190 and returned home under relative 
secrecy but not before the friendly nomads had given to Ulysses the 
tattered remnants of some long dead archaeologists journal...the exact 
meaning of its observations still a mystery due to its fractured nature.  
He married the Nemon Rebel and fugitive Jana Biesecker on Arizona Dawn in 
1193 and retired from the marines in 1197 after 20 years of service.  He 
then became constable for a small district on Enope and raised riding 
animals.  When two junior constables were found shot to death in their 
ATV in a local wilderness area all fingers pointed to the strange loner 
who lived in the hills by the name of Solon Maghib.  Ulysses vowed to 
hunt the killer down and did so only to discover him held prisoner by the 
son of a local wealthy statesman.  When challenged the man Aaron Nessus 
fired at the Constable who shot him dead.  Constable Stark subsequently 
found life very difficult on Enope and eventually decided to leave, 
trying to find his fortunes working as a security consultant for some 
corporation or high port.  He still recieves a pension of about 900 Cr/month.

Strephon grew up a fairly average middle class kid during the hey day of 
the NeoSol Confederation before it gave way to the Unified Sphere.  He 
attended NeoSol Univ and got an undergraduate degree in Agricultural 
Science.  He moved on the graduate school where he mastered in 
agricultural economics.  As a bright young wunderkind he was snatched up 
by NeoSol Systems Company rapidly emerging agricultural systems 
division.  The redevelopment of worlds ravaged by the rebellion and hard 
times provided ample oppurtunity to whoever got off to a head start.  He 
was trained and sent to the relatively new automated lowland facility on 
Rach where he was part of the analytical team that helped to plan the 
facility layout for the future works.  He transferred to the planet 
Aquilas where he worked as a special assistant to then Facility Manager 
Amura Adan.  After suffering losses from ocean going pirates there and 
the lack of any centralized government on the world, Strephon and Amura 
developed the idea of a corporate action team to handle such situations.  
After some persuasion the company decided to back the idea although there 
were malcontents.  Strephon is now Amura direct assistant and handles 
much of the administrative and analytical work of the team.

"I was brought up to believe that if you work hard and youre always 
honest that youll make something of yourself.  Life has taught me that 
people lie.  Ive developed a sense of bitterness but I still try to be 
true to myself through honesty and hard work.  Ambition? Yes Im ambitous, 
Im looking for that idea, that score that will push me towards the top 
but I temper that with compassion and common sense.  Being a part of the 
team is great, Heck Amura and I are just alike, she\'s even told me I 
remind her of herself 6 years ago.  I think we make a pretty good team"

My father and mother worked in a high port orbiting prima.  Thats where I 
was born.  My mother was a sub-manager and my fathers was a technician.  
I attened secondary school planetside and so lived there away from my 
parents during the school terms.  I went on to university where I majored 
in general physics.  One summer I got the chance to do a drop from orbit 
with a Marine pilot in one of the new Drop Gunships.  I was hooked.  I 
got into the conferderation Marines after graduation and was selected for 
a pilots slot.  I graduated from flight school with my drop wings on Day 
1,1196.  
	I was in a drop gunship a year later when the Carrier Altair 
jumped for the first frontier excursion.  Theres nothing like dropping in 
from orbit in 40 tons of composites and crystaliron loaded down with half 
again that wt of everytype of ordnance you can think of.  Its no problem, 
the grav negates your weight so you can sit there and hover behind that 
tree line for a half an hour until called upon, then you light up 80 tons 
of thrust and come roaring across the battlefield.  It can really suck 
being the other guy.  The gunships arent grav tanks but their a grav 
tanks worst nightmare.
	During my second tour off Midas Prime, my "ground pounder" as 
theyre called was hit my some sort of beam which disabled it, (so much 
for armor)  I egressed and was later rescued off the planets surface.  On 
the ground I felt very strange about the appearances of things.  I cant 
quite put my finger on it but it hand something to do with the 
geometry?! of the terrain.  I took some pictures with my data recorder 
that Ive never gotten around to taking to an expert.  I left active duty 
for the reserves soon after that.  I was able to buy a little grav 
shuttle on Prima and I fly that around Sol City on charters.  Ive got an 
offer to join a team from an old friend Strephon Pecorin so Im headed to 
the high port to check it out.  Adio

    'body' => 'Some rules hardliners might get upset here but I have no problem with 
adding things to the RPG tech background to either correct (in my mind) 
things or introduce effects or capabilities as long as they are not in 
direct conflict with the standing rules.  This preamble is here because I 
would like to introduce a new type of ammunition/weapon that I have 
played withand might start using.  The goal is the beloved Blaster of 
SciFi fame.  I wont post this in standard weapon form because it is 
really intended to initiate discussion.

This weapon is the Magnum Bolt Rifle.  It is compact,  at 60cm and 
beefy at about 6.8 kg loaded.  A fat weapon.  At 60cm its short 
enough to be a sort of heavy blaster.  It fires a round that has as its 
base a 20mm x 32mm Straight ETC cartridge.  This gives Ea of 8500J.  
The rules bending is this.  One of the available ammo aside from Heap and 
DS is a Plasma Pulse Cartridge that sits on the end of the ETC 
cartridge.  It is ballistic tipped.  The ETC cartridge initiates the 
"reaction" in the PPC.  A micro piezo electric fuze in the ballistic cap 
discharges the plasma stream upon impact.  It is in a sense a Super HEAP 
round.  Dont ask me how it works.  It is in effect a ballistically 
delivered plasma pulse.  The special effect would be that the cartridge 
glows because of the heat and it fails completey after about 0.5 s when 
you just get a 20 meter stream of plasma.  Maybe doing 1D6 burn damage to 
anybody in the stream hexes.?..A PPC about this size is a 3D6 attack.  
The round energy with a 20 cm barrell gives 5D6? So the total would be 
about 8D6?  It would have a pen of 1-1-1 but a max range of 200m because 
of the cartridge consumption. So....you get a large caliber weapon that 
fires a glowing bolt at about 400 m/s (slow enough to be seen?) That will 
punch right through battle dress.  You get the range of a slug weapon 
with the Pen of a Plasma weapon.  Think about it, ballistically delivered 
fusion cartridges?  And after about 200m you get a bright streamer.  Even 
better the thing gives off a bright explosion? when it hits a target 
inside 200m.  Hell, if you dont like my bolt ammo just look and see what 
a rifle firing 20mm x 32 mm Heap ammo can do.  That alone would make an 
extremely devastating but still compact weapon.  I can see it now, the 
Battle Dress trooper at TL 10 coming down and seeing these guys in 
T-Shirts with some short compact weapon and while theyre laughing hearing a 
kaboom and wondering where that hole through his chest armor came from.  
As soon as I find my FF&S Ill formalize all this stuff.  But the Magnum 
Rifle is something Im definitely gonna dump in a campaign...

given up through the Cluster Liberation War.

     _Rorke\'s Drift_ class Heavy Cruiser

CA-1 Rorke\'s Drift CA-N6368F3-090100-00E08-0 MCr30,626.8 35,000 tons
batteries bearing      D    1 9  Crew=296.
batteries        F    1 A  TL=12.
Low=273. Cargo=806. Fuel=13,300. EP=2800. Agility=6. Marines=250.

Notes: Ship has frozen watch, fuel scoops, purification plant.

This is the original _Rorke\'s Drift_ design. 60 of these ships were built 
for the NFN, all named for famous battles fought on Earth. This version 
of the ship saw action during both the Old Islands War, in which six were 
lost, and the Topas War. Following the Topas War, FAdm Connor commented 
that the lack of armour made this class to vulnerable to risk against 
capital ships.

The surviving cruisers received the Series A refit in 5630.

CA-1 Series A CA-N6368H4-090300-N0009-0 MCr30,670.5 35,000 tons
batteries bearing    D  1 9 Crew=281.
batteries      F  1 A TL=12(14).
Low=641. Cargo=676. Fuel=13,300. EP=2800. Agility=6. Marines=1000.

Notes: Ship has frozen watch, scoops, plant. The refit cost MCr1,330.47 
per ship and took 14 weeks.

The Series A _Rorke\'s Drift_ received the new Missile-A bays and a laser 
spinal mount, and also had the Marine contingent greatly expanded, from 
two companies to a heavily reinforced battalion.

The added accomodations for the Marines came in handy, as the _Rorke\'s 
Drift_ class was called on to perform several disaster relief missions 
throughout the Cluster in the next few years--the Marines were frequently 
replaced with medical personnel.

In addition to the disaster relief missions, the class also saw action in 
the Serendip War. 34 of them were at the Second Battle of Neubayern, and 
13 of them were lost or damaged beyond repair.

When the Imperials invaded, eleven ships were hidden in deep space, and 
the remaining thirty were removed to the safe worlds. There they received 
the Series B refit.

CA-1 Series B CA-N6368J4-000700-N000A-0 MCr35,315.2 35,000 tons
batteries bearing    1 Y Crew=410.
batteries      1 Z TL=12(15).
Passengers=30. Low=720. Cargo=647. Fuel=3640. EP=2800. Agility=6. 
Marines=1000.   Y=51, Z=60

Notes: Ship has frozen watch, scoops, plant.  Has an NH3 fuel system, 
Helson-Canomaar Overdrive jump system, and enhanced output maneuver drive.  
Carries one 30-ton small craft.  Has 1800 ton missile magazine (600 
battery-rounds).  Carries 40 ER missile controllers.  Missiles have 
anti-missile fire control capability.  Has enough fuel for four jumps 
before refueling.  The refit cost MCr22,691.7 and took 48 weeks.

The Series B _Rorke\'s Drift_ is representative of the other Series B 
refits. An NH3 fuel system was installed, reducing the fuel mass to 52% 
of normal. The newly-developed Helson-Canomaar Overdrive system was also 
added (this was the most expensive single component), reducing the jump 
fuel requirement by a factor of ten. Combined, this allowed a ship to 
jump with 5.2% of the pre-refit fuel requirement.

This enourmous savings in space mostly went to weapons.  Using the 
multi-bay system, which allows more bays than normal to be carried at the 
cost of doubled tonnage requirements for each \'extra\' bay, 60 100-ton 
missile bays were added. All missile bays were equipped with anti-missile 
fire control, which allows a missile bay to act as a repulsor bay of 
three factors lower. Also, enough magazine space was added to support ten 
turns of ER missile fire. During the Cluster Liberation War, these ships 
carried exclusively Kinetic Energy missiles. These missiles do damage 
like a nuclear missile, but aren\'t affected by nuclear dampers and have a 
- -2 penalty to hit. 

The older Series A ships were reactivated late in the CLW, but were used 
primarily to mop up Imperial stragglers. The Series B ships performed 
with distinction during the War, though. Even with the improved nuclear 
dampers and anti-missile fire control, they were still too vulnerable to 
go toe-to-toe with Imperial capital ships--instead, they fired ER 
missiles from beyond the Imperial\'s range.

The high point of the class\' career was the Battle of Pamraeltan. The 
Imperial Naval Base in that system was to be the jumping-off point for 
the Imperial\'s planned reconquest of the Islands following their initial 
defeats there. They had mustered a sizeable force led by a _Tigress_ 
class battleship. The Alliance Navy had learned of the Imperial plan, and 
launched a preemptive strike on the Imperial fleet as it was being 
assembled. During the ensuing battle, a squadron of _Rorke\'s Drift_ class 
cruisers fired a single salvo of KE missiles at the Imperial flagship, 
rendering it dead in space and badly damaging its weapons and fuel tanks. 
Before the Imperials could get there flagship to safety, it was destroyed 
by an Alliance planet-buster.

Not necessarily the case.  Naval forces may be forced to jump outsystem
(or at least vector out of orbit) after landing planetary units and before
they are able to retrieve them.  I\'d hate to be the planetary commander
who had to fight opposing orbital bombardment and aerospace forces with
only ground forces.  Similarly, I\'d hate to have to fight ballistic
missile submarines and orbital satellites with only AFVs or other grav
ground vehicles.

This is an important point that I think is very difficult for us TL 8
humans to understand.  Distinctions between ground, air and orbital
craft/vehicles will tend to disappear with the advent of contragravity.
I\'m not going to argue this from a design rules standpoint (I wouldn\'t
be able to anyway) but from a philosophical standpoint, at average
stellar tech levels there won\'t *be* clear distinctions between things
like AFVs and aerospacecraft.  To the extent that we still see such
distinctions I think we are merely falling victim to our experience that
has been limited to things like tanks and fighter planes.

Yes, but again we are limited by our own concepts of submarines.  The
wet navy material that appeared in *Challenge* was a great start in this
direction.  It showed things like submarines attacking orbital craft
and the like.

I think this acceptance of air, sea and land forces and the subsequent
focus on land forces (which goes all the way back to *Mercenary*) is
way too much 20th Century thinking and not enough 57th(?) Century
thinking.  The next time you think 20th Century experience is relevant
for Traveller planetary combat ask yourself how well a Prussian cavalry
officer might envision a carrier battle group hunting for attack
submarines.

In the Traveller-era I believe there will be two types of military
forces:  space forces (the Navy) and planetary (land/sea/air) forces
(the Army).  There may be some specialized forces like the Marines but
the only command division will be at the point where certain grav
vehicles/craft cannot escape planetary orbit.

The stuff that\'s appeared on ground forces is good as far as it goes but
I\'d like to see a combat force that was equipped to move through several
worlds in a subsector: a water world, a vacuum world, a `garden\' world,
and a desert world for starters.  I\'ll let all you folks with military
experience or inclination decide whether this needs to be a corps or
army or several armies with whatever associated space forces are 
necessary.  Each of these worlds has some sort of planetary and local
space forces but not more than your fleet of several squadrons ought
to be able to deal with if you have the right force composition.

I realize the Imperium doesn\'t need this sort of flexibility because it
can just lumber along and wait for the appropriate forces to be transported
to the respective worlds but the Imperium is gone.  What kind of forces
is the Regency going to use to chase that Vampire Fleet from behind the
Black Curtain back across Corridor, mopping up or `cleansing\' worlds
along the way?

How long does it take if I have contragravity?  :-)

*I\'m* certainly the last person to argue over rules (I generally throw
them *all* out) but I don\'t think it\'s this cut and dried.  The `1000
ships per sector\' and `50-200 ships per numbered [subsector] fleet\'
figures are from the *Rebellion Sourcebook*, a MegaTraveller reference.
It was these numbers that I used to estimate the Sword Worlds naval
forces at 42 ships.

The distinction seems to be more of `strategic\' focus (fleet compostion
and such per *5FW* and *RS*) versus `tactical\' focus (ship tonnages and
the like per *HG*, *TCS* and *TNE*).  I believe this is where the
actual inconsistencies are.

It was *JTAS* #10 (the `War!\' issue was #9).  The article only covers
*ground* (not aersopace or nautical) forces.  There are no corresponding
rules for SDBs or other space forces in *JTAS*.

This is fine with me.  So what do we do now?  What is the rationale for
accepting the *TCS* or other `tactical\' part of the canon *over* the *RS* or
other `strategic\' part of the canon?

You know someone with 10,000 years of space combat experience?  :-)

Yes, more thinly populated "than the `average\' Imperial subsector".  This
inludes those heavily populated subsectors in the Imperial core.  Regina and
other subsectors in the Spinward Marches are also `frontiers\' - they\'re not
`average\' for the Imperium.

We\'ve already established this.  Again, what is the rationale for
accepting `tactical\' figures from places like *TCS* over `strategic\'
figures from *RS* and the like?

Even if it had several 200,000 ton battles?  Is this a tech level issue?

What I\'m asking is why you choose to accept *TCS* data over *RS* data?

You\'re "mixing apples and orange".  Why would I choose to have a *TCS*-
generated aggressor fight a *5FW*-generated defender?

Let\'s see what a little creative rationalization can do with this.  I 
postulate one or more fuel refining depots in orbit about the gas giant.
There are strictly controlled traffic corridors between the 100-diameter
jump point, the fuel depots and Regina itself.  85% percent of incoming
traffic and 100% of outgoing traffic passes through these corridors.  Of
course, some `unauthorized\' traffic might skirt these corridors but I\'m
not worried about protecting them from corsairs anyway.

I came up with this in about 30 seconds.  Give me a couple of weeks and
I\'ll make those 10 SDBs *invaluable*!  (As long as you don\'t restrict me
to *5FW* constraints while you use *TCS*.)

Again, these only covered *ground* forces.

Remember MegaTraveller?  The Imperium only fights for high population
worlds.  In *5FW*, high pop worlds have *hundreds* of SDBs that are able
to match the jump-mobile naval squadrons.  Furthermore, I believe that
*JTAS* said that the 10 Regina SDBs deployed in the gas giant\'s atmosphere
in order to `harrass\' opposing forces.  There was even a rule in the
game for declaring your SDBs `active\' or `passive\' or some such thing.

What do we have here?  The Cult of the Trillion Credit Squadron?  :-)
I\'m not trying to argue what *TCS* says.  What I want to know is *why* I
should ignore *5FW* and *RS* in favor of *HG* and *TCS*?

More Cult dogma?  The *Rebellion Sourcebook* clearly indicates that most
of Glisten subsector as well as portions of District 268 and Trin\'s Veil
subsector fell at one point to the *ihatei*.  Once again we see that the
`strategic\' viewpoint conflicts with a `tactical\' one.  How do we choose,
rationally, between the two?  Can we reconcile them at all?

Finally, I\'ve got a question for all you *TCS* cult members.  Is there any
clear way to identify ship types or classes based upon tonnages?  In other
words, is there some breakdown like:

Battles          100,000+
Cruisers         40,000 - 100,000
Destroyers       5000 - 40,000
Etc.?
(Please don\'t take issue with my numbers.  I don\'t have a clue what the
actual values out to be.)

What about types/classes themselves?  Is there some finer breakdown than
battles, cruisers, carriers, escorts, etc.?  Is there a way to tell a
frigate from a destroyer, etc. (besides what the designer choose to call it)?

The following NPC sketch first appeared in *Melbourne Times* #2.  Adelaide
Olowua ought to be adaptable to any campaign with minimal effort.

Personafile: Adelaide Olowua

Adelaide Olowua is a Human female of medium height.  Her features reflect a
strong African-branch influence and are considered attractive by most Humans. 
She keeps her black hair close-cropped.  Her athletic build is somewhat unusual
for one approaching late middle-age but not surprisingly so.

Adelaide usually dresses in close-fitting clothes - she claims they are merely
functional but is acutely aware of their ability to highlight her figure.

Of average strength and endurance, Adelaide is surprisingly agile.  She is
bright and has a great deal of experience from which to draw.  Her position as
a retired merchant captain has offset the negative social affect of being a
free trader.

Adelaide\'s interests tend to be simple: good food, good drink, good company. 
She enjoys a good story and appreciates good piloting.  She has little
tolerance for authority.  She enjoys playing grav-ball and the rhythm lute. 
She is quiet, but sociable.

Adelaide\'s allegiance lies with a small group of people: her ship mates, her
family and a few close friends.  She is generally devoted to these people and
will make major efforts to support them.  She withstands trauma well and is
very cool under fire.  She is a respected leader and can lead large groups with
success although she has not yet taken advantage of this ability.  Her own
respect for authority is minimal - a reaction to the restrictive conditions on
her native Nyanza.  Likewise, Adelaide is very tolerant of other viewpoints and
lifestyles.

Born June 21st, 2948, at New Lagos on Nyanza, Adelaide\'s travel documents still
show Nyanza as her home.  She has not had a permanent home for many years but
uses her mother\'s address.

Adelaide\'s father died shortly after she was born.  Her mother, Lily Olowua,
remarried when Adelaide was in her teens.  She has a younger half-brother.  She
herself has been involved with several men but has never been married and has
no children.

Adelaide\'s friends tend to be ship mates.  Her ship\'s navigator, the Dolphin
Bolivar Sprayswallower, is a veteran of the Nyanzan Navy, and has served with
her for five years.  Duncan Ishige, her ship\'s steward, is the son of a friend
from her days at the Academy.  The robot Archimedia, the ship\'s engineer, was
purchased by Adelaide over four years ago but has since been emancipated. 

Adelaide first met her closest friend, Refuin iks-Louan, over twenty years ago.
She has always had the utmost respect for the Aeroi\'s mercantile skills and
asked him to join her crew when she became a free trader.

Adelaide has made more than a few enemies, especially among customs officials
in the Ouroran Community.  She has always somehow managed to stay above the
letter of the law, if not the spirit, and thus has avoided any serious trouble
so far.

Service History: Adelaide attended the Victoria Lines Merchant Academy on
Nyanza, receiving her Merchant\'s Certificate with Honors in 2970.  In addition
to extensive flight training she studied Victoria Lines\' administrative
procedures.  Upon graduation she chose service in the Deck Department and was
commissioned as a Fourth Officer.

During her first term Adelaide spent much time dirtside, including a stint at
Victoria Lines Deck Department School.  In addition to the computer and gunnery
skills she learned at the School she did a lot of brawling and carousing in
startown establishments.

Adelaide successfully completed the promotion exam to Third Officer in her
second term.  Many of her assignments were route service in frontier regions
where she spent much of her time performing EVA during orbital operations.

Adelaide\'s third term was spent at a variety of dirtside posts.  She spent some
time as a vehicle driver and was involved in more than a few fire fights with
smugglers.  She also managed to complete the promotion exam to Second Officer.

Adelaide completed the promotion exam to First Officer early in her fourth term
and was subsequently assigned to Command School.  She was taught standard
merchant legal practices and had an opportunity to learn Victoria Lines ship
tactics.  In her off-hours, she continued to spend her time in the less
reputable areas of startown.  After Command School she was assigned as a pilot.

Command School had been a good move - Adelaide made Captain in her fifth term. 
Now the one responsible for the trade mission, she proved to be a capable
leader.  She also learned some of the more \'underhanded\' aspects of merchant
operations.

Adelaide continued to prosper in her sixth term and grew comfortable with the
unpredictable nature of merchant operations.  She also became familiar with the
economic aspects of the business.

Ultimately, Adelaide began to chafe under the strictures of the Lines and
decided to muster out in 2994.  In addition to financial and material benefits
she received possession of her Far Trader Rampart Parabola.  She began the life
of a free trader.

Recent Activities: Adelaide has been plying the space lanes as a free trader
for over six years.  She has managed to maintain a fair profit margin but not
without resorting to more than a few illegal activities.  While she does not
consider herself to be smuggler - she calls it profiteering - many customs
officials would disagree.

As Nyanzan free traders go, Adelaide is something of a shining star.  She has
never resorted to outright piracy and would not do so given the opportunity. 
She considers avoiding duties and regulations to be a matter of course.  Taking
from others is another matter entirely.

The Rampart Parabola has encountered more than a few pirates itself over the
last few years.  Adelaide has been ruthless in these encounters and has so far
avoided any major losses.  In fact, she and her crew have developed something
of a reputation among the pirates of Nyanzan space.

Adelaide is well known for her honest dealings (with brokers and traders) and
is often highly sought after by those who have a cargo that they want shipped
while avoiding any \'official\' entanglements.

The following library data first appeared in *Melbourne Times* #2:

Discovery Service: The exploration and missionary service of the Abrahamic
Synod.  The Discovery Service has primary responsibility for survey of new
systems as well as for contact with new cultures.  The Scouts of the Discovery
Service are renown throughout the Colonies Sphere for their scientific and
surveying skills.  The Discovery Service has also proven quite effective in
spreading the Abrahamic faith among the new peoples contacted.  It has shown
greater success in gaining new members for its State than has any other scout
service.  Primarily because of this record of success the Discovery Service has
been banned by most Colonial States from conducting operations on their
respective worlds.  Discovery Service teams are generally welcome on
independent worlds due to their extensive record of aid to developing worlds.

General Hulls and Drives: The largest corporation in the Commonwealth, General
is the largest manufacturer of starships in the Colonies Sphere.  General
builds all classes of starships from private yachts to naval battleships at
shipyards on both Commonwealth and independent worlds.  In addition to its
manufacturing operations, General is a major insurer in Commonwealth space. 
The company also has extensive holdings in the chemicals (primarily jump fuels)
and mineral processing industries.

ikrahanbe: Aeroi meditative state commonly used as a means of focusing
intellectual effort on a particular problem.  Often used during trade
negotiations, the technique involves the complete encirclement of the Aeroi by
its membranous wings in concert with a semi-conscious mental state.  The
process seldom lasts more than a few minutes.  After emerging from ikrahanbe,
Aeroi are usually able to present a proposal that is agreeable to all parties
concerned.  The technique is sometimes unsettling to non-Aeroi who confuse it
with some sort of psionic talent.  The Aeroi claim the process is strictly
internal to the practitioner and several independent examinations have failed
to detect any evidence of psionic activity.

         Hi guys - 
              All this talk about naval forces etc set me thinking, so I
         decided to do an analysis of the class A starports in the Domain
         ca 1120.  The original list had some 95 starports, which I broke
         down by tech level.  This gave me the following info:

         TL     No of Stpts    Total Cap    %Cap
         G         1           12.0 MTons    %8
         F         9           47.5         %31
         E        11            3.5          %3
         D        10           26.5         %17
         C        14           31.0         %20 
         B        22           25.0         %16
         A        12            8.0          %5
         9        11             .004        <%.01
         8         4             .3          <%.5

         Total Cap=Total Shipbuilding capacity in millions of displacement
         tonnes, per the TCS guidelines (peacetime)

         %Cap=Percentage of total capacity for this category (may not =100
         due to rounding)


         In other words, the majority of the class A starports are TL12 or
         less (%64), but the bulk of the shipbuilding capacity is at TL13
         or greater (%59).  In fact, over 1/3 of the shipbuilding capacity
         of the Domain is TL15 or above!  I don\'t know about anyone else,
         but this suprised me - it hardly jiibes with the "rude frontier"
         image that people sometimes have about the Domain.  It does
         however explain how the Domain could survive at a high tech level:
         it actually has a strong, high tech industrial base.

         I did some more analysis of these worlds, sorting out those worlds
         that have significant shipbuilding capacity (1 million tons +) to
         get the following list:

         Capacity=Total Shipbuilding capacity in millions of displacement
         tonnes, per the TCS guidelines (peacetime)
         %Total=Percentage of total capacity for this category (may not
         =100 due to rounding)
         Min=Minor Combatants (ca 1000tons)
         Maj=Major Combatants (ca 50000tons)


         These figures are taken from the TCS budget info posted by Ken
         Hagler, with the total atarport capacity figured as follows %25
         devoted to minor combatants (avg 1000 T), 25% major combatants
         (avg 50000 T), and %50 allocated to civil ship construction.

         This gives an annual construction rate of almost 750 major ships/
         year, with nearly 60 million tons at TL15+.  This translates into
         300 major combatants *PER YEAR*..

         What this seems to imply is that the MT figure of 1000 ships per
         sector is a limit imposed by Imperial Policy, not by the
         limitations on planetary economies.   The actual number of ships
         would be determined by a number of factors:  

         1.   Basic nature of the interstellar government (i.e.,
         militaristic alla The Sword Worlds, or pacfistic, or somewhere in
         between).
         2.   The budget of the interstellar government for maintenance.
         As a quick rule of thumb, I would allow 1/2 of the TCS budget for
         the planet to be used for maintenance, the rest going to upgrading
         and new ships.
         3.   The current political situation - a government at war, or on
         the brink of war, would allocate more resources to weapon
         building.
         4.   Other more pressing uses for shipbuilding capacity,
         (exploration services such as the Zho Core expeditions, patrol
         services such as the Quarentine, orcommercial use)
         5.   The useful life of a starship - the longer they last the
         easier it is to maintain a larger fleet.

              I think this may shed some light on the continuing discussion
         about the Sword Worlds.  The Sword Worlds will have to spend a
         fairly large portion of their planetary budgets on the maintenance
         of their fleets, and will thus be operating on a sort of "cold
         war" budget (sound familiar?).  This might be the mechanism behind
         the proposed "boom-bust" cycles.  The converse would be true for
         the Imperium (and Domain).  A much smaller portion of the whole
         economy would be devoted to military ends, and a larger portion
         would be available for development purposes, both public and
         private.  This would keep the econonmic development on a more even
         keel, and could be the reason that the "boom-bust" is not seen in
         the Imperium.  With it\'s isolation and the burden of maintaining
         the Quarentine, the Regency might start to experiance the same
         kind of effect.  Perhaps this is the "overheating" mentioned in
         TNE.

         As for using the PoT formulae (which I like conceptually), the
         figures that were posted last week were wrong...the thing that was
         missed was the population multiplier.  On a Pop 8 world, the
         multiplier is .2, at Pop 9 it is .03, and at Pop A it is .004!  In
         other words, a world whose population is an order of magnitude
         higher than another will not necessarily have a corrispondingly
         large space force.  In practice, this gives worlds like Efate,
         with a Pop of 9, a fleet of major combattants in the teens (I
         don\'t have the figures in front of me now, sorry)
         I think the PoT figures work great for the Wilds, where there

Equipment Guide is now available for $20.00.  Is it worth it?  Yes, if you\'re
a user of FF&S.  The RCEG has a lot of good designs for all players and NPC\'s.
It covers equipment used by the RC, the Guild, and planets in the wilds.
 
Basically it is broken down into four types of equipment.  Equipment
(resporators, armor, drop capsules, etc), Weapons, Vehicles, and Spacecraft.
The equipment is further categorized by availability (RC, Relic, Guild, Wilds,
Hivers). 
 
Finally, there is a four page FF&S rules expansion in the back.  Modules and
Pods are added to spacecraft design.  Floatation screens to ground vehicle
design, Grav belts to lift vehicle design.  For Aircraft design, further notes
for compound helicopters are added as are aircraft modifications for other
planetary environments. (How to compromise your design so that it works in
Thin atmospheres as well as your native standard atmosphere).  
 
For small arms, Dual-feed receivers, Modular small arms, and overpowered
cartridges are dealt with.  For high-energy weapons, Rapid-fire High-energy
weapons are added, Plasma and fusion bazookas are added, and the question of
concussion and burst of high-energy weapons is answered.  In Munitions,
guidance and missile design is added.  Shotgun and Flechette rounds for
Grenade Launchers are added.  A New Rule is added for projectile weapons with
a penetration of Nil.  And in Misc. some details of Workstations and Labs, and
Hatches and Rates or Troop Egress are dealt with.

Whew!... A lot a rule for just four pages but if any of those area are things
that you are designing with FF&S then you will want RCEG.

All in all it is a good source of equipment for the busy GM.  There are even a
few adventure ideas for dealing with relic equipment buried in the
descriptions.

Other Impressions.  Lots of decent artwork.  Most equipment has a picture to
go with it.  Eight full color plates of the equipment in use.  

What I miss.  DECKPLANS!  One thing I loved about CT was the detail level of
standard starships.  That seemed to be farmed out with MT and is nonexistant
with TNE.  Maybe they will finally appear in the Personalities of the
Reformation Coalition supplement, but I won\'t hold my breath.

   I based my fighting-ship classifications on the spinal mount.
Battleships would have the largest SMs for their TL, cruisers the smallest,
and escorts/destroyers would only have bay and turret weapons.  Ships from
lower TLs tended to be larger than equivalent higher TL classes - my
philosophy was to wrap the smallest hull around the SM I could.  Finer
gradations were based on secondary weapons or performance (lots of
missiles, high accelleration, heavy armour, etc.).  Then there are
fighters, but I never could see a lot of use for them in space combat.

This all applies to MT; I haven\'t designed enough ships to get a feel for
TNE ships.

dispute over which version of Traveller reality we should use to visualize
fleet conditions in the Imperium.

I haven\'t got time for a detailed answer, but you have to start on the
basis of accepting that there is no way that 5FW can be reconciled with
TCS.  Once you get past that, the reason for not accepting 5FW as the
model is this:  The ship levels in 5FW are way too low for any reasonable
bottom up estimate based on population or economic activity.  

Take Glisten as an example: Glisten is inhabited (according to the Imperial
Encyclopedia data) by about 8 billion people.  If they were responsbile for
the maintenance of the entire "average subsector" fleet, neglecting any
contributions by the other worlds in the subsector, 42 ships with an
average crew of 1000 (probably a bit high remembering the mix of ships from
Supplement 9) would represent .0005% of the population.  Even with a
thousand support personnel for each crew member (I hope you will agree that
is an unthinkable level of bureaucracy!), that would still be less than
half a percent of the population.  If those 42 ships had an average displacment
of 50,000 tons, typical High Guard designs would give them a cost of about
50,000 MCr, which means that each of the 8 billion people would have con-
tributed about Cr260 to build them--over a ten year period (or more).  This
would work out to be an annual tax burden of 26/12000 for the average starship
steward, 2/10 of one percent, and less than that for a more highly skilled 
worker.  Retirees could easily pay it out of their pensions. (-:  If the
Imperium was seriously interested in defending itself, it would spend more
money.  Likewise, serious attackers could easily spend more than a fraction
of a percent of the annual wages of their populations, so the 5FW numbers
are not reasonable.

I agree with Steve Higginbotham, who said that 5FW was best viewed as a
"simplified" representation of the "real" world, since no one would want to
push 10,000 counters around.

A heavy weapon. I say if you\'re going to do it, go all the way and make it
a squad support weapon, with a belt feed and longer barrel.

20mm???? This is not a personal weapon! If anything, it would take the
modern grenade launcher\'s role.

Calling it a "heavy blaster" IMHO conjures up Han Solo dashing thorugh
Imperial corridors with a large energy handgun. THis thing is what squad
leaders use to bust a fortified position before rushing forward.

Sounds to me like a very unstable weapon, especially if it jams (I don\'t
have FF&S but the reality checking says: it may jam and blow up in your
face when the plasma just *has* to go).

>Don\'t ask me how it works.

Too bad. I\'m asking. The gun initiates the reaction. The fuse releases it.
What if the round cooks off prematurely? Where does the energy go? What if
nearby electromagnetic interference sets it off?

>It is in effect a ballistically

The round would have to include a little magnetic force-tunnel thingy to
project the plasma forward properly. Otherwise it would go splat and
vaporize everything around it, rather than focusing on the target.

This may be the range of a sidearm but this thing is more than a sidearm,
and doesn\'t come close to the range of a proper battlefield rifle.

That is not a rifle. That is a Very Heavy Machinefun or a Light Autocannon.

Or more appropriately, consider what a member of a Mesoptomanian militiaman
would make of the over-the-horizon high-speed death that characterizes so
much of warfare today. I refer you to GDW\'s Harpoon game and the satellite
scene from *Patriot Games*.

While I agree that there will be a consolidation of forces, there will
always be those vehicles that, when restricted to a single environment,
will still have a substantial edge over those that are not.  Take a grav
tank, for example. Yes, it can fly, but if the design only accounts for
low-level flight and not intercontinental transit, think of how much more
armor and payload it can carry without the extra thruster plates, fuel, or
whatever. Ther will always be room for specialization.

Analyse the economic strength of the 30 billion people in the Sword Worlds. 
Assign what you think is a reasonable sum of money per citizen for them to 
spend on their yearly naval budget (assume 1 credit hasthe buying power of
a US $). Now see how many naval vessels you can buy for that. Decide what
part of the initial purchase price it will cost to operate a ship. 1/20th?
1/10th? 1/5th? Whatever you decide, multiply the number of ships in the
fleet by the inverse number. Now match the figure you arrive at against 
the figure TCS gives you and against the 42 battleships _RS_ gives you.
Which is closest? By how many orders of magnitude?

If you accept the rationale that _5FW_ is a board game with other priorities
than _TCS_ then you certainly needen\'t. If you try to fit them all into a
coherent whole you need to address these discrepancies. GDW claims that 
BOTH_TCS_ and _5FW_ are based on the same reality. A few simple calculations 
show that that can\'t be true. Now what?

And you just the other day agreed with me that the only faintly reasonable

fight the ihatei with anything approaching an important Impy force. (And
even then I just can\'t accept the defeat of Tobia).

Both tactically and strategically the ihatei are in deep shit if they poke
their furry muzzles across the 4-5 parsec gap that seperates the spinward 
3/4th of Trojan Reaches from the coreward 1/4th.

I think you need to consider some more design issues, and some game balance
issues.

First, the PPC cartridge is going to be smaller than a conventional ETC round
from the same barrel.  This is because you will need a "container" to
direct the force of the plasma bolt that is bigger or thicker than a 
corresponding HEAP cartridge casing.  I still think it would be a nasty weapon
but this will help bring it down a notch.

Which leads handily to my next issue.  Cardinal rule: anything the NPCs get
the PC will get eventually.  Give *them* a compact weapon capable of defeating
battle dress (and light vehicle armor???) and your in trouble.  Make sure that 
there are some limiting factors; I would make the range very short ("due to
the extreme weight of the round"), the cost per round very high, and/or the
recoil very high.  A fully automatic version would be right out.

Ok so much for the voice of reason.  Now think about this; why have the bolt 
go off on impact?  seems to me you could do some serious area damage with the 
addition of a simple proximity fuse, or a timer fuse which causes the round to
go off at a set distance from the barrel.  It would act a bit like a plasma
shotgun; the round leaves the barrel at 400 m/s, at 20m it goes off-creating an
effect like there was a plasma-gunner standing there.  I would go for a more 
diffuse bolt which attacked a cone, use the rules for flechettes but with 
the "fragments" being hot plasma.  I wouldn\'t dare to guess a damage after
sermonizing above.

I am hardly a TLC cultist, but I do have an answer for that one: NO.

The current nomenclature game into being between the introduction of steam and
the turn of the century, and it was intended as a set of functional designations

Battleships were the "ships of force" able to stand up to other battleships.

Cruisers were light ships with long legs, able to serve as the "eyes" of a 
battle force, or take on extended patrolling for commerce raiding/protection
or force projection.

Destroyers were designed to destroy enemy torpedo boats -- that is, provide 
a defensive screen for the battle fleet.

There were a selection of minor types, but that was the core, and with the 
exception of a few new types (the Fleet and Escourt Carriers) it held through
WWII.  After that, everything went to hell in a handbasket.

Ship designations since the start of the cold war have had a lot to do with
the politics of defence appropriations and nothing to do with function (which
is why Destroyers now do extended patrols, Agis cruisers provide zone defence,
and Janes lists submarines first among a nation\'s naval assets.)

In Traveller, it is even madder - witness the Patrol, Mercenary, and Kinunir
"Cruisers" in the same universe with the "Azanti High Lightning".  In my HG
designs I always tried for the WWI functional designations -- but when I 
start FF&S design, I plan to stuff the whole mess for a new set of functional
designations that have some relation to real tactical employment.

  so often seen in Challenge.  IMHO, a waste of four-color ink.
  A better choice would have been something like the color vehicle
  paint drawings in the T:2000 vehicle supplements, which were far
  superior in artistic merit and were useful and relevant to the
  supplement, and often enlightening in themselves.

  Some of the equipment drawings are useful.  A bright spot in the
  book\'s art design are the drawings of two TL14 Ithkluri weapons.
  The Hiver ships shown look like shoeboxes.  I\'m trying to forgive
  in the interest of promoting alien psychology in ship design,
  but the picture of the Hiver Utility Vehicle landed on a moon
  looks very unrealistically bad.  I can deal with boxes in the
  vaccuum of space, but where\'s the landing legs?  The Schalli
  battle-dress looks like it escaped from _Battletech_.  Stats
  for an _Aliens_ style cargo handler are given on a battle
  dress page, but it\'s easy to miss because there\'s no art for
  it, and it\'s in a corner.  Shame, shame -- major art and 
  marketing oversight, IMHO, here.  (How do I know?  One of the
  color plates shows an odd variant of it.)

* The subtle and not so subtle Imperium-bashing can get a bit
  heavy for old-timers who remember what it was like even at
  it\'s worst.  I get the impression that the RC thinks that
  it is desigining equipment that was overlooked by the fallen
  civilization (the Imperial idiots!).  I may be reading more
  into this than is really deliberately there.

* Some new FFS rules are introduced.  The RC seems to be somewhat
  confused about the difference between a grav belt and a G-tube
  or grav bike.  Also, grav belt propulsion by ducted propellor
  somehow bothers me -- I liked the grav belt on the cover of the
  MT _Imperial Encyclopedia_.  There is no such thing as a "two
  man grav belt" -- that thing is a bedframe grav bike.  Some
  interesting musings on how gravitic fields work, and what
  happens when you stick a weapon or your arm outside the grav
  belt\'s field.

* Every time they say that independents have trouble getting RC
  body sleeves, I ask, "Why would they want one?"  I miss the 
  IISS TL15 uniform vacc suits, which made the IISS look more
  like professionals, IMHO, and less like superheros in their
  long-johns.  There\'s a very comic book feel to TNE in the RC,
  and if I wanted to play in the comic books, I\'d play _V&V_ or
  _Champions_ or the like.  I don\'t.  This goes back to art.
  Ditto for the battle dress -- especially the light model that
  looks like the poor fool is wearing a corset.  Now Imperial,
  Solomani, or Zhodani battle dress from MT and previous -- 
  those are much more interesting. 

* The info included seems more useful.  There are some equipment
  designs, a lot of weapon designs with associated rounds and
  magazines, and a fair number of vehicle and starship designs.
  Modules for the _Auroras_ are included.  A TNE _Trepida_ is
  included, designated by the RC as _Intrepid_ (they thought
  the Imperial designation was inappropriate.)  The companion
  _Astrin_ APC is not included, nor the ballistic vehicle 
  re-entry system the IMC used, which seems like it would be
  a good candidate for inclusion, considering the uses intended
  for this supplement.  (Admittedly, we haven\'t seen that system
  spelled out in stats yet in the game.)  A MT-era Solomani design
  for a "grav tank" called the _Chariot_ is included, here called
  the _Pyrrhus_ since it isn\'t really a MBT grav tank, and if
  used like one....  The art used for it is familiar, but I
  don\'t know if the _Chariot_ was in DGP\'s _101 Vehicles_, or
  if they\'re just reusing the picture for, say, the Gram grav
  tank.

  Also, comments in the text indicate that the Hive Federation
  is able to equip its\' Ithkluri Marines at TL 14 already, and
  that they are *exporting* TL 13 parts to the RC.  DGP stated
  that the Federation was at TL 15/16 before the Rebellion
  (marginally superior to the Imperium), and since the only
  damage they suffered was due to the Collapse itself, I suspect
  the Federation is well on its\' way to becoming the pre-eminent
  technological and trading power in Charted Space.

Summary.  I\'m still a bit unsettled about this one.  If I get it,
it will only be to strip out the useful stuff and chuck the bizarre.
I\'ve never seen a book so putatively realistic that gave me such
a sense of unreality.  Your milage may vary -- I\'d like to hear
other people\'s opinions, especially the newer players.

As usual, most of my arguments are with Dave Johnson... :-)

    Yep.  Blame GDW...  they could have modeled Classic Traveller on 
Star Wars, or Star Trek, both of which show signs of thinking 
"futuristic", but instead went with "1970s with Starships"...

    He would quite rightly suggest that it was the province of the 
Navy, not the cavalry, to envision such things...  

    If you think the modern or future world has nothing to learn from 
the military geniuses of the past, why is Sun Tzu\'s "Art of War" 
required reading for U.S.  Marine officers?  (I have read Sun Tzu; 
much of his commentary is timeless.)  


>Yes, but again we are limited by our own concepts of submarines.  The

    I\'m not; I watched "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" as a kid.  
:-) I still think the Flying Sub was neat...  

>This is fine with me.  So what do we do now?  What is the rationale for
>accepting the *TCS* or other `tactical\' part of the canon *over* the *RS* or
>other `strategic\' part of the canon?

    A) personal preference.
    B) TCS is based on world economies directly; given X people at 
Techno-Economic Level Y, you get X*Y*C credits to play with.  Make up 
and apply a good thumb-rule for translating credits to number of hulls 
at Z tons each, based on known prices of ships as listed in the rules.  
Poof, you have a number of ships per region (sub-sector, sector, 
square foobars) that is consistant with the rest of the rules (i.e., 
makes sense).  The Rebellion Sourcebook stuff seems to be a lot of 
"we\'ll pull an even number out of thin air and write it down...".  

    On the other hand, for poltical reasons, the Imperium may be 
building a lot fewer ships than it is capable of...  (a) most of its 
yard production may be in mercantile shipping (the "phantom" bulk 
haulers once discussed on the TML), (b) member worlds may be 
exploiting the advantage of being in a large Imperium:  an Imperium 
needs fewer ships to defend its borders than the sum of the ships each 
member world would need to defend itself.  Therefore, member worlds 
need spend much less tax money and build fewer non-producer
(military) vessels than an independent world would.  Note that both
arguments assume that both TCS & RS numbers are valid in the same
universe.
    The objection to this argument is that if argument (b) is true, 
the Imperial economy should be booming...  so why do we have so many 
worlds with the Techno-economic levels of banana republics?  And, the 
numbers given in 5FW and RS sources are *TOO* low to defend the 
borders of the Imperium, even with the size advantage -- not when one 
independent world can produce a big enough fleet to seriously threaten 
the entire Spinward Marches, IF the Spinward Marches fleets are as 
small as suggested in RS.  

    You could also argue that *only* 5FW & RS numbers are valid; I 
simply cannot stomach that.  When GWP (Gross World Product) CAN be 
estimated based on listed population and required standards-of-living 
from the MegaTraveller rules, and ship construction costs are known 
from the same rules (likewise, both facts can be ascertained in CT 
rules), IT MAKES NO SENSE for worlds to build a tiny fraction of the 
Navy they are capable of building, especially when their "lives, 
fortunes and sacred honor" are threatened by (pick one) Imperial 
conquest, Zho conquest, Sword World raiders, Vargr raiders, Solomani 
conquest, K\'kree militant vegetarianism, etc, etc, etc.

>You know someone with 10,000 years of space combat experience?  :-)

    You\'re being silly.  I can go to my bookcase and pull out two 
military works by generals dead over 2000 years, both from Empires 
that have undergone worse "Dark Ages" and worse Tech Level losses than 
space-faring humanity ever did in Traveller...  The Vilani have been 
spacefaring for 10,000 years, and fighting other spacefarers for a 
signficant fraction of that.  Add in Aslan military history (2000 
years), Terran military history (3000+ years), Zhodani, Vargr, and 
K\'kree military history (several more thousands of years), and you 
have one hell of a huge body of "Theory and Practice of Interstellar 
Warfare".  

    I quote you:  "way too much 20th Century thinking and not enough 
57th(?)  Century thinking."  You are forgetting the sheer weight of 37 
centuries... for Terran humanity alone.  How much have we (Real World)
learned about the Art of War in 3700 years?  A lot.  How much have we 
forgotten?  None.  In a Dark Age, the Art and Technology of War is the
one thing that advances, rather than declining...

You asked this already.  In the same letter.  See above.

I understand that.  Read this letter.

    There is *at least* a one-day "jump lag" between you posting a 
letter, and all the responses to it coming in.... and you asked this 
question already.

    You\'ve seen Hans\' opinions about the Ihatei doing anything in 
Glisten or Trin\'s Veil...  his opinion is similar to ours.  To be 
kind, most of GDW\'s Rebellion-era material is not the highest quality 
they\'ve ever produced.  Also, don\'t 5FW counters (including the SDBs) 
represent Squadrons and Fleets, rather than individual ships?

    Yes. Tonnages are approximate, based on classes from Supplement 9,
and from memory.  Classes are usually based on size and intended use.

Primary function: slug it out with other large ships; has
spinal mount; jump capable; aka "Capital ships".

100,000+ tons           - Battleship
70,000 - 100,000t       - Heavy Cruiser, Battlecruiser
40,000 - 60,000t        - Cruiser
20,000 - 40,000t        - Light Cruiser, Cruiser

Primary function: as above, not jump capable.

over 5,000t             - Rider, BattleRider

Primary function: carry small combatants (fighters, SDBs)

any size            - Carrier
add armor           - Armored Carrier
add spinal mount    - Strike Carrier

Primary function: carry large combatants (Riders)

any size            - Tender
add armor, weapons  - Battletender (?)

Primary function: escort capital ships and carriers, engage SDBs, 
light riders, badly-designed fighters and mop up damaged capital 
ships.

1000-3000 tons      - Escort, Light Escort
3000-10,000 tons    - Destroyer, Destroyer Escorts
10,000-20,000 tons  - rarely seen for some reason. (Frigate ?)


Primary function: commerce raiding, anti-piracy patrols, customs 
cutters.

300-1000 tons       - Close Escort, Patrol Escort("Patrol Cruiser")
1000-3000 tons      - Escorts as above, on independent or convoy duty.


Primary function: engage similar combatants or cruisers, travel in 
large battle groups of same type. (My own designation, based on an 
extra-Imperial nation with non-standard doctrine).

3000-20,000 tons    - Corvette or Frigate

Primary function: small non-jump combatants, delivered in swarms to 
battlezone, or used for commerce raiding.

50-200 tons         - heavy fighter, small SDB. If well-designed, can
                    disable capital ships if in large numbers.
20-50 tons          - fighter.  Commerce raider.  Cannon fodder.
6-20 tons           - light fighter, interface fighter. Cannon fodder.

>    Is there a way to tell a frigate from a destroyer, etc. 
>(besides what the designer choose to call it)?

    Beats the hell out of me.  Depends if you are using classic 
European usage or modern American usage for the term "frigate".  The 
former means a large ship, not quite as big as a "ship of the line".  
(the USS Constitution was a frigate) Modern equivalent would be heavy 
cruiser or cruiser.  The latter usage means a small escort, smaller 
than a destroyer with slightly different duties.  
    American frigates were formerly called "Destroyer Escorts".  The 
purpose of the Destroyer is clearer if you remember that the name is 
short for "Submarine Destroyer".  As a carrier group or battlegroup 
escort, the destroyer\'s job is anti-submarine warfare; the frigate\'s 
job is manning the radar pickets (listening for enemy aircraft, ships 
or missiles in coming) out there at the edges of the fleet.  Ideally, 
the frigate is between the Carrier (or Battleship) and its 
accompanying cruisers and the enemy, and will "see" (and handle 
fire-control against) the enemy before the enemy can "see" the core of 
the Carrier Group.  Or something like that.  
    And I have no idea what a Traveller Frigate would be good for 
(spatial equivalent?)  In any case, the type names are chosen by the 
military based on intended use, not by the designer.  The U.S. Navy 
has changed the type names of several ships during their lifespans, as
they were refitted and given different duties.

 ::>a little too tongue-in-cheek? :-)  Can anyone post a RICE paper?

 Sure.  I was thinking that consistency of textual material would 
 be a Good Thing, but since these things _are_ done by different 
 field reporters, they would actually reflect the different styles.  
 The only thing that I would suggest is that the XUWP be kept in 
 the standard format as presented in RICE Paper #0000, modified as 
 discussed below, and that no lettered RICE Paper be published 
 until the numbered RICE Paper that it is associated with has been 
 published.  Also, since under this scheme there is a possibility 
 that multiple RICE Papers may get published simultaneously, I 
 would recommend NOT assigning a number, but instead using the TML 
 number of the message that contains the RICE Paper.  Of course, if 
 a lettered Paper is being published, _that_ one gets an assigned 
 number based on the appropriate numbered Paper.

 Also, RICE was just a fortuitous acronym.  I almost changed it 
 when I saw what it led to, but decided that I liked it...  The DCE 
 and DTE were deliberate, though... I wonder how many people caught 
 the pun...

 Absolutely, good thought.  I\'ll add that in RICE Paper #0001 (or 
 whatever number it turns out to be, per the revised method of 
 numbering ).  As it stands, Spinward Marches except Regina 
 Subsector is per Imperial Chamber of Commerce issues as of 1116 or 
 thereabouts (Megatraveller Imperial Encyclopedia); Regina 
 Subsector is per Regency Board of Economic Development issues as 
 of about 1200 (Traveller: The New Era).  I know I have Deneb 
 Sector somewhere, and I think it\'s of the 1116 issue, but I\'m not 
 sure.  If someone has "accurate" info, contact me off the list so 
 that we can arrange appropriate information transfer...

    Necessarily.  If you don\'t have orbital control, your guys won\'t ever

more than a small fraction of an assault force down to a defended planet
while an enemy fleet existed insystem).

    Probably just as long.  Civilians don\'t have a good appreciation of
just how much STUFF an Army needs to move to function.  It\'s not just
tanks and APCs and howitzers and men.  The tanks and APCs and howitzers
amount to only a small part of any military force larger than a company.

as "strategic"?  Big picture is NOT the same as "strategic", fyi.

    Yes.  Even if it had 40 1,000,000T battleships.  This, like all
military issues, is a TL issue.  TL dominates tactics in Trav, it
dominates operations, it dominates strategy.  It even dominates
logistics...
    If you ignore TL, then EVERYTHING you say about the military situation
in Trav is meaningless drivel...

> What I\'m asking is why you choose to accept *TCS* data over *RS* data?

    Because RS is inconsistent with the reality presented in other places.
For instance, the ability to fight an interstellar war WITHOUT resorting
to sterilization of worlds is a function of military strength.  With a
small number of ships, it becomes impossible to move large enough units
to the target area.  And if you can\'t take the world, you either leave it
alone (and if it is safe to leave it alone, then there was no point in
coming here in the first place), or you sterilize it.
    Yet Trav REPEATEDLY described successful invasions of worlds.  Several
in the FFW, more in the Rebellion.  WHERE DID THE SHIPS COME FROM?
Supposedly, the total amount of shipping available to the Imperium was
declining steadily during the Rebellion, yet they were coming up with
invasion forces right up to the point when the fighting ground to a halt.
    If Dulinor had had 2000 ships at the start of the Rebellion, where did
he get the resources to conquer whole subsectors?  Certainly, 2000 ships
weren\'t it.  Unless EVERY one of the 2000 ships could move an entire
division of high-tech troops, which they couldn\'t (The Tigress is the only
Impy ship ever described that could move a division, though mention of
assault transports was made)...

    No, I\'m describing a SINGLE SHIP.  Designed using HG, which was the
system used to design that SDB.  You are assuming that a ship designed
under High Guard is somehow different than another ship designed using
High Guard just because the one ship was designed for a TCS game, and
the other was designed as a bit of local color for the Traveller game?
Ridiculous!

    Let\'s use a calculator instead.  Regina\'s 100 diameter limit is about
12,000,000Km.  One incoming corridor, one outgoing corridor means 24 giga-
meters to patrol with your 10 ships.  Which means each ship has at least
2,400,000Km to patrol (assuming the ships are NEVER down for maintenance
and things like that).  Weapon range of 300,000Km means you have to run
900,000Km to get within weapon range of a pirate attacking someone as far
from you as he is likely to get.  Which means that you take about an hour
and a half to get within firing range of the pirate if you had your hands
on the controls just waiting for this to happen.  If the pirate is at all
competent, he can blow up his target in half an hour, and be gone well
beyond your sensor range before you get there.  If, on the other hand, he
is stupid enough to be trying to capture the ship, he\'ll have done that
in an hour, and you\'ll find yourself with a velocity differential of
about 330Km/s relative to him (he won\'t be in weapon range, because he\'ll
have run AWAY from your line of flight for that very purpose).  If he\'s
pulling 4G, and you 6G, you\'ll catch him in about 4.5 hours, which is
about two hours longer than it\'ll take him to reach the jump limit if
he\'s smart.  And if he\'s stupid enough to not jump before you reach him,
then you have to figure out how to beat him up before you overshoot
him (about an hour at your current relative velocities), WITHOUT killing
the innocent civilians on the captured ship.  Of course, to complicate
your planning on beating him up, you have to keep in mind that he is
twice as big as you are, and twice as well armed, and your nearest friend
is around 3,000,000Km away still.  And if he is smart, then he has a very
good friend running amok through your shippin lanes while you are off
chasing him...:-)
    As most of the old TMLers can tell you, I think piracy will never work
in Trav.  But the situation you described is about as close to paradise
for a pirate as I can imagine in Trav - lots of traffic in a small area (thus
saving you the trouble of FINDING targets), defenders spread out all over
that traffic lane (thus letting you know where they are so you can avoid
them).

    I\'m not restricting you to ANY constraints.  I am using HG to design
pirates, you are using HG to design SDBs (the one in question is the
standard SDB from the Trav game (and Mt, and TNE, in different
incarnations).  It has NOTHING to do with FFW.  FFW just provided the
background for GDW to describe the SDB.  And if you\'d like to design a
BETTER SDB (using HG, or any other rules set) feel free.  It won\'t make
a difference, any more than it would make a difference whether the US Navy
used ten PT boats or ten Iowa class BBs to patrol the US coastline.  The
problem isn\'t the capability of the patrol ship, the problem is the
NUMBER of the patrol ships.  Keep in mind that your ten ships can only be
TEN places at once...

    If the Imperium only fights for high pop worlds, how did they grab
the Border Worlds from the SW?  Only one High Pop world there, so they
shouldn\'t have touched any of the SW except Sacnoth...
    As to "*hundreds* of SDBs", that is irrelevant to the utility of
the SDBs that Regina supposedly sent to the GG.  You have to assume that
the Commander of the Regina System Defenses knew what he was about.  So
he obviously expected to accomplish something by deploying ten 400T SDBs
to Regina\'s GG.  But WHAT?
    As to "harassing", what harassment could those offer to a battleship?
Or even a Fleet Escort?  I think if you drag HG out, you\'ll find that
any combatant larger than a DE can deal with any possible action by ten
of those generic SDBs without breaking a sweat.  In fact, I venture to
suggest that ONE (1) Impy Sylea class fighter could deal with anything
those ten SDBs could do to harass anything...
    And "active" meant that your SDBs did something (mostly died), while
"passive" meant they did nothing (and therefore lived, but accomplished
nothing while doing so).

    No.  We have people who like to do EXPERIMENTS!  Try it some time.
Pick out a rules set you like.  Design ships.  Design a Doctrine for
using the ships.  Deploy the ships IAW your Doctrine.  Then let some-
one ELSE design ships, and a Doctrine, and let him put his Doctrine and
ships up against YOUR Doctrine and ships.  DON\'T take GDW\'s word for
waht works.  Or mine.  And don\'t GUESS!  Get off your lazy behind and
FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!
    As to the question of strategy and tactics and operations, if your
Doctrine doesn\'t cover ALL of them, it won\'t be worthwhile for anything
other than defending a system that YOU are in (you can\'t give tactical
orders to a froce that is three weeks travel away from you...).
    In my TCS game (which was more a strategic game than a tactical game,
and more an operational game than either one), TACTICS didn\'t actually
mean very much.  All the players could do is decribe BROADLY what
tactics their fleets should use (what "the Book"said).  The normal
decisions they made were operational and strategic (how should we spend
our money to advance our goals?  Where should we deploy ships to?  How
many should we deploy there?)
    As to why you should ignore FFW and RS, consider:
    1)  Built into FFW and RS is GDW\'s picture of "tactics" and "ship
design" and "logistics" and everything else.  Which means that
accepting their picture of the Impy Navy requires that you accept
their picture of how a battle is fought.  (Remember those SDBs which
are actively defending the GG?  Or passively hiding there?  Well,
they don\'t accomplish much UNLESS I go to the Gas giant!  FFW assumes
that a Fleet MUST go to the gas giant (and that there is only ONE gas
giant)  So the function of those pieces in that game assume a certain
tactics used by all sides.  Which is all well and good IFF those tactics
are the BEST tactics possible given the TECHNOLOGY!  They aren\'t.  In
three TCS games I\'ve run, I saw only three attacks that used the gas
giants the way GDW said they were used.  All three failed.  I saw only
ONE attempt to defend at the gas giants the way GDW said they should be
defended.  It was the most disastrous defeat for the defending Navy I
have EVER seen.
    Note that the three attacks using GGs the way GDW said they were used
were all involving UNDEFENDED gas giants.
    2)  Neither of those games deals effectively with ANYTHING but the
Impy forces in general, and the non-Impy forces in the Spinward Marches.
This ignores too much of the Trav Universe, and requires that you
assume that the K\'Kree, the Hivers, the Solomani, the Aslan, and the
countless Vargr states ALL FIGHT THE SAME WAY!  This is incredibly
stupid, UNLESS the "SAME WAY" is the BEST way to fight.  I have seen
too much HG combat to believe that "defend the gas giant, fight them
as they come from the GG to the main world, defend the main world" is
the BEST way to do anything.  I have also seen too much to believe that
"attack the GG to refuel, move to the main world while beating up their
fleet, attack the main world" is the best way to attack anything...
    3)  And finally, neither of these sources is "strategic", which is
the only thing you claim for them that TCS isn\'t also.  Both are only
vaguely related to any military factor other than number of
ships/men/tanks, etc.  Which any student of the military can tell you
is pretty insignificant compared to other concerns...

    You assume that GDW did more than arbitrarily decide the fate of the
Ihatei and GListen, eh?
    You seem unaware that strategy grows out of tactics/logistics/operations
and that tactics grow out of strategy/operations/logistics.  If you can move
your army 30 miles in one day, your "strategy" cannot call for the capture of
an enemy position 300 miles from your nearest forces three days from now.
Because if your strategy DOES call for such, then you\'ll have to change
strategies in three days when your men fail to accomplish the objective you
have set for them.  And if your strategy requires that worlds be taken
intact, then they cannot be bombarded with nukes and dinosaur killers.
    If the Operational Simulation produces different battle results than
the tactical simulation, then the operational simulation is a bad simulation.
Once your operational simulation produces results consistent with playing
out under a tactical suimulation, then you can proceed to determining
whether the strategic elements decribed in RS are actually relevant to your
operational goals.  If they are not, then clearly the strategic elements so
described are not a good model of the reality you purport to describe.

    Alternately, you can ASSUME that the strategic concerns described are
correct, and assign operational/tactical concerns consistent with that.
    BUT< if you do, then you should be aware that you have then made an
assumption comparable to the French assumption in 1940 that the Germans
could not get through the Ardennes in less than ten days, and certainly
could be stopped at the Meuse River by the forces present along that
frontier.
    Ultimately, ALL strategy/operations/tactics are a function of what
ONE man(army)/ship(navy) can accomplish with the weapons available to
him/it.  So you have to know what a man/ship can accomplish before you
can make any realistic analysis of what your Army/Navy can accomplish.
    And you can\'t determine what one man/ship can do by looking at
a strategic primer.

> Etc.?

    Well, for all you RS/FFW Cult members, no, there is not.  Labels in Trav
are largely arbitrary, based on the assumption that spaceships in the far
future are similar to modern Naval vessels.  They aren\'t.  Not even close.
Which is why so many people who play the game misuse their fighters (which
are NOT analogs of modern fighters, but rather of modern PT boats).
    However, that being said, GDW seems to use the following:

    Battleship = 200,000T+
    Heavy cruiser = 75,000-100,000T
    Light Cruiser = 30,000-50,000T
    Escort = 5,000-10,000T
    Destroyer = 2000-3000T
    Destroyer Escort = 100-1000T
    Fighter = 100T-.

    Note that in my experience, ships as small as 30,000T have been described
as
battleships, and ships as large as 100,000T have been described as light
cruisers,
by the few people who knew that doctrine for use is what made it a given
type,
NOT tonnage.


> What about types/classes themselves?  Is there some finer breakdown than

it)?

    No.  The designer is the only one who knows what the proper label for
something is.  The USNavy today has 18 "cruisers" that are smaller than
their destroyers.  And once upon a time, a cruiser twice as large as those
destroyers was labelled a "frigate" (back when we were in a nostalgia phase
in the Navy, and wanted to bring to mind the Constitution and such).
    You may, of course, assign labels to suit yourself, f you don\'t like the
designer\'s.  If your labels don\'t take into account tactical/operational
use for the ships, they will be pretty meaningless, but that\'s your
privilege...

Hmm. Perhaps ideally... :-) It might be fairer to note that the \'elected\' 
representatives only get where they are by lying, back-handers, use of the 
media to portray them as \'nice people\', etc. [allegedly]. They rarely think 
for themselves, preferring to tow the \'party line\'. In the case of a certain 
current European government within a few miles of myself, the strings are, 
in reality, pulled totally by the owners of production, who ensure the 
politicians vote as they desire in order that they can maintain their high 
profits and so that the politicians can become directors when they retire 
from politics. Perhaps not so different from a feudal technocracy? :-) or 
should it be :-( ?

THE SWORD WORLDS \'DEBATE\'
A lot of the problem seems to be over someone having TL11 and not having as 
good starships as a TL12 world, etc. Given the World Builder\'s Handbook, for 
TL11, maximum TL for a particular facet (power, ships, domestic, etc.) is 11 
+ (11/5) = 13. So in theory the world might be rated TL11 but actually still 
retain (or have built up to) TL12 or TL13 in their starship production. This 
might well be the case if the world was particularly worried about being 
able to defend itself from attack. Perhaps the TL12 ship production is 
military only, so all other ships (traders, etc.) are only TL11. Perhaps the 
domestic economy (if you play TL as a reflection of economy) has suffered to 
make up for this input into the military such that the populace only has TL9 
or worse facilities. Just some thoughts...

WHY DOESN\'T EVERYONE HAVE THE BOMB?
New Scientist once carried an article describing how to make a nuclear bomb 
in your own home. It did point out that you\'d die of radiation poisoning but 
that if the exercise was being carried out by a terrorist this might not 
matter. Given the theory that plutonium is available by cash or manufacture, 
how does one get it? Obvious answer is to go and TAKE it. That\'s what 
terrorists could do. If your own country isn\'t suitable, pop across to a 
nearby dissolving multi-state ex iron-curtain country, tip some guards a few 
credits and walk off with a preprepared warhead. Hell, take the whole 
missile. :-)

To apply this to a wider range of products, even should your own world be 
TL11 and unable to supply TL12 replacements for your bought-in TL12 
thingummy-jigs, there\'s no reason why you shouldn\'t buy, steal or smuggle 
such from other worlds. If it\'s important enough then I would assume a 
government would be quite willing to go many jumps and deal with less than 
scrupulous worlds in order to obtain what they want. You only have to look 
at today\'s arms trade.

"What\'s this consignment of pipes for Iraq?"
 "Oh, just some plumbing for a water refinery."
"And these huge pointed bullet-like cylinders."
 "I think they go along inside the pipes - for cleaning... probably..."

gun-manufacturing machinery to this country?"
 "I have so many pieces of paper passing across my desk I can\'t possibly read

Get that damn grav vehicle off of my train!  You\'re messing up my 
harmonious tech level karma.

Actually, the problems I saw were more because the equipment was
being combat loaded; which means important stuff was being loaded
last so as to be the first thing unloaded.  The problem was, nobody could
agree as to what was important.  

OK, Glisten... A couple of people were surprised that Glisten with its
umpteen billions of population and lots of SDBs would have fallen
to the Ihatei.  I imagine the Aslan did not really invade Glisten so much
as capture all of the surrounding agricultural worlds.  I\'m sure Glisten
had hydroponics and carniculture plants as internal food sources, but
there would have been some form of dependence on supplemental outside
food sources.  Basically, reprocessed algae might keep you
alive, but probably would not keep you overly happy or healthy.  The
Ihatei probably waited a few months and then suggested a small change
in alliegence in exchange for some non-artificial food.  The humans would
get to stay alive, retain their property and eat a good meal, while the Aslan
would gain a high-tech industrial base in the Spinward Marches.

What do you think, sirs?

Hi all,


Are all the weapons in the Twilight:2000 game usable with the TNE game 
system? Is this a new marketing strategy for GDW to make all their games 
compatible? I bring this up because I was looking through issue 72 of
Challenge and there is an article on advanced infantry weapons and the 
stats are identical to TNW weapons.

Which brings about the point, are the vehicles in Twilight:2000 
compatible with TNE rules. I was thinking of running a variant where the 
PCs are from a Tech-7 world and they have to fight off an invading 
Imperial Army of Tec-12. (Abrams vs. G-Carriers, whoopee!)

Env Suit-2	Swimming-4	Bribery-1
Energy Pist-2	Willpower-2	Geneticd-2

Dr Eco was born outside the coastal city Adskir\'s Landing on the planet 
Aurigae and grew up on or near the water because of the seafaring 
tradition of the region.  He developed an early interest in computer 
technology and continued to develop this despite his early seafaring life.  
Boredom and economic reasons led to Max\'s joining the merchant marine at 
the age of 17.  With a cooperative captain he was able to streamline the 
operations of his ship and increase its effeciency in more ways than 
one.  After a couple years in Max decided to pursue his interest in 
computer technology and due to his aptitude was able to win a scholarship 
to study at Sol City University on Prima, then capital of the NeoSol 
Confederation.  While there he continued his maritime pursuits by diving 
and racing powerboats on the lake just outside the spreading city.  Max 
got an university degree in Computer Technology and was invited to pursue 
graduate work.  He developed an interest in the very theories of computer 
science and studied such concepts and virtual reality and biological 
combinations with computer technology.  He ultimately developed an 
interest in quantum computer technology. (dont ask)  After finishing the 
graduate program he obtained his doctorate in Computer Science.  The 
scholarship required that he serve an 8 yr term in the Federation Scientific 
Agency and did so studying the problem of heuristic computer systems 
whose physcial structure is modified by the virtual structure.  He also 
spent some time studying the problem of electronic/photonic interfacing 
with biological organisms and was part of a team that tested some simple 
enhancements on animals.  Its ultimate goal was the cybernetic enhancement of 
humans in a whole new way.  The program at this stage showed little 
promise of success.  Due to changes of focus and ethical questions the 
program was discontinued.  After completing his term Dr Eco returned to his
home planet Aurigae to the University of Ayken located in the Nemon 
Province.  Archaeologists there had discovered both an ancient Sea Bottom 
Arcology as well as an ancient base of some sort, dates were put at 1000 
yrs or better.  The Arcology had been intentionally flooded or so the 
theory went but the cause was not known.  What got Dr Eco involved was 
that both sites contained fragments of various sizes of some sort of 
three dimensional crystalline computer core.  Dr Eco believed he could 
recover some of the virtaul knowledge from these fragments based upon his 
quantum computing models and theories.  This combined with the draw of 
the sea led Dr Eco to join the sea going research team where he spent 
most of his time aboard the Aurigae Explorer, a survey ship.  As 
fragments were recovered with Dr Eco personally recovering some, an 
interesting picture developed.  During this time there was a potentially 
very dangerous conflict brewing.  A people known as the Nemons primarily 
because they lived in that province on Aurigae around the supposedly 
ancient city of Nemo\'s Landing were(and still do) claiming to be the 
indigenous people of Aurigae (or more indigenous than anyone else by 2000 
years or so).  The Union of Senled, an emerging military power claimed 
that this was not true and that the Nemon region actually is part of some 
Kingdom of Senled that did indeed exsist about 120 yrs ago.  The evidence 
collected by the surveys was suggesting that the Nemons have been there 
at least 1000 yrs or more.  The computer core fragments that were being 
analyzed by Dr Eco appeared to be Imperial.  Furthermore there are 
numerous references to people who called themselves Nemons who had been 
there hundreds of years or more by that time.  Was the Arcology the 
remnants of an Imperial facility on Aurigae?  Are the Nemons Solomani 
settlers from the second Imperium or even Before? How long have they been 
on Aurigae?  If they are proven to be indigenous what does this mean?  
Will the Confederation use this as an excuse to weaken the emerging Union 
of Senled? Probably!!

Assisting Dr Eco in his investigations were his brother and Sister-in-Law
Gellek Adan, and Giselle Adan.  Their young daughter Amura back home in 
junior academy on Arizona Dawn.  While Dr Eco was ashore at the 
University of Ayken analyzing some new fragments a mysterious explosion 
ripped through the Aurigae Explorer while it was on another survey 
operation.  Going down in less than two minutes all aboard were drowned.  
Several bodies were never recovered including those of Max\'s brother and 
sister in law.  Dr Eco went to Enope to raise his neice Amura for 
his dead brother.  Years later he returned to Aurigae.  Follow up surveys 
confirmed the wreckage of the doomed ship.  Dr Eco himself dived on the 
wreckage in shallow water...something wasnt right about the 
wreckage....sabotage?  When he returned to the University he found 
his office ransacked.  His samples and artifacts gone, his data stores 
wiped.  Two days later the Union of Senled invaded the Nemon Province.  
One attempt on his life encouraged Dr Eco to leave Aurigae, which he did 
traveling to Arizona Dawn where he was recruited by the Vega Group a 
Unified Planetary Sphere govt ageny.  Here he was put on a team that was 
involoved in the top secret investigation of the Gamma Project.  His 
prior experience with biological electronic/photonic interfacing being 
directed related to ambitous and unethical project. Dr Eco makes 
infrequent contact with his niece Amura Adan who is in charge of the 
corporate Action Team for NeoSol Systems Company.

Greetings Fellow DawnNet Users
You can call me Pierre
I will be using Tariq\'s account with his knowledge to provide information 
that I have acquired through various sources.  Hopefully you will find 
this useful or at least interesting.  Please direct all inquiries 
regarding Arizona Dawn Info Service and NeoSol subsector Info News 
Service to Pierre at this address.

I have uncovered some information about the Gamma Project of which you 
have seen previous references to. 

Apparently the original project initiated on Arizona Dawn 20 yrs or so 
ago was officially closed down by the Federation Government after certain 
ethical and scientific questions were raised.  It now appears that some 
individuals in government, the military and private sector sustained the 
project clandestinely.  When the Unified Sphere was chartered and got 
going the Vega Group, a Union Investigated Service discovered evidence of 
the projects continued exsistence and even evidence that it had 
progressed to human experimentation.

The Gist of the Gamma project is this...
It has long been thought that electronic and photonic components could be 
used to enhance human physical abilities.  This is the well known field 
of cybernetics.  More contreversial is the idea of enhancing human mental 
abilities by directly interfacing the human brain with a processor.  The 
initial Gamma project involved experiments in this field.  It now appears 
that the renewed Gamma project took even this radical idea a step or two 
further.  Its supporters suggested that based on the idea of a computer 
or processor that alters its physical structure according to changes in 
its virtual structure, it could be possible to build a semi-organic 
processer based upon neurological models that would exhibit similar 
performance or behavior.  Much still not known about both the virtual and 
physical structure of the brain it was suggested that an initially semi 
organic yet artificial processer could be devloped (grown?) that could 
interface with the brain in a way no one had previously conceived of.  It 
appears that the supporters just started to see if they could do it 
without thinking if they should or the consequences.  Some critics have 
called the idea a sort of semi-organics computer virus that has the 
cability to infect the human mind.  Consequences....multiplied effeciency 
for other Cybernetic enhancements.  Improved interface with external 
processors, etc.

It appears as one of the more heinous facets of the entire renewed Gamma 
Project that human beings were KIDNAPPED from frontier worlds and less 
developed regions on worlds loosely bound to the then NeoSol Confedertion 
to be used as test subjects...many of these tests failed...I do not know 
what became of those subjects.  Information that Ive collected showed 
that a Raid by a SPACR force somewhere on the frontier shut down the 
project but quite a bit remains unclear about the whole thing.  It is 
rumored that there are some big names involved in this.  I believe that 
the Dawn Foundation and the Vega Group are pursuing the continued 
investigation.  When I obtain more information I will pass it to you.  

I have come across an internal paper written by a Major in the 
Unification Marines that may prove insightful into the philosophy of the 
Corps as well as explain its developmental philosophy before and after 
the Charter.

Thank you for your attention 

Pierre

I just realized that I subconsciously neglected to stress the
interior of the hull for acceleration.  Obviously, it shouldn\'t be
necessary in this design, but if you retrofit a manuver drive of
some sort into the thing, you should consider it.

on RCEG review, musings....

I just realized, if grav belts typically move around by propellor,
and contragrav only reduces a 1G field to 0.01 G, what happens
on a vaccuum world -- do you float down like a feather?  You can\'t
fly to high altitude either.  Your velocity varies with density of 
atmosphere.  Yuck.  I *really* miss the old grav modules.

The _Pyrrhus_ "grav tank" has been identified as the so-called
grav tank in the TNE rulebook, and has a virtually identical 
silhouette to vehicle #11, "Striker Grav Tank, TL9" in DGP\'s
_101 Vehicles_.  I knew I saw it somewhere.

The _Dinimbue_-class express boat, or "xboat", has been used by the
IISS Communications Office for centuries as one of the workhorses of
the Imperial communications network.  Optimized for their job, the 
ships are unsuited for almost any task besides carrying electronic
xmail.  The ship carries extensive databanks and a powerful and 
triply backed-up maser communicator.  Only one communicator is
meant to be powered at a time; the radio is for emergencies and
xboat tender retrieval operations only.  The class is named after
the professor at the University of Sylea who, in 624, designed the
infamous "Poni Express" insignia which has since adorned all IISS 
Communications Office ships and crews.

DESIGNER\'S NOTES:  This is an attempt to capture the spirit of
the old CT xboat design using the FF&S/Brilliant Lances ship design
rules.  Since any size ship may now carry jump drives, the ship
was simply reduced in size by a factor of five, to the minimum
possible size.  The ship is state-of-the-art for the late 600s
Imperial, when the xboat net was started.  To accurately reflect
the high proportion of fuel to cargo, those hits have been spelled
out explicitly in the damage table rather than using the standard
"Hold" result.  (Typical practice in my designs...a little more
realistic.)  Since the sensors are a bit sub-par (which seems to
be typical of GDW ships like this), I assume that the tender has a 
beacon which makes it easy for the xboat to center its\' commaser.
The old "80% for quantity purchase of class ships discount" is applied
in parentheses under price.  

Like the classic xboat, it\'s a sitting duck.  The ironic thing is,
considering the size of this craft, it really *does* deserve the
title "boat" instead of the "ship" any jump vessel rightly deserves.

round however I was trying to keep in mind that this is science FICTION 
and I was mainly looking for special effects as well as a justification 
for choosing the weapon over an M-16A1....I realize that It is important 
to maintain consistency within the rules but I would really love it if 
someone can come up with a weapon that produces the desired dramatic 
effect yet is still relatively compact.  A plasma carbine or pistol, Even 
if you could build it, in the current sequence it would have a short 
range of a few meters and about the same damage as a .45 and cost a 
helluva lot more.  Maybe I should just suck it up and realize that the 
PC, NPC should chose between his slug pistol or a laser pistol as his/her 
sidearm...I think that I will do this.  Anyway a laser pistol can have a 
pretty high damage for a sidearm and only rigid armor is gonna stop it.  
Range is of course only human physiologically limited.  Im gonna whip put 
my FFS over the weekend and see if a gauss pistol gets up there.

I should point out however that a head shot from a tl 8 9mm 2D6 pistol has a 
30% of instantly killing a PC with a Con of 6.  If the shooter is a short 
range (say 8m) and has a slug pistol asset of say 7(4) =11
He has a 16/20 or 80% chance of success. (Average Shot, 17-20 Auto miss)
Furthermore there is a 11/20 (55%) chance of outstanding success doubling 
the average damage of 7 to 14.  The product of these two probabilities is 
44%  Now there is a 14/20 (70%) chance that a D20 will roll under the damage
of 14 thereby doubling the damage again to 28 which is more than twice 
the PC head hit points (2 x Con).  The net prob is 0.8 * 0.55 * 0.7 = 0.3  
Make this a 3-D6 pistol and the percentage goes up I believe to 49%

BUT
It could be that my reasoning is flawed..but Im fairly sure it isnt as 
far as the net probability is concerned

My interpretation of the rules is flawed in that you do not cumatively 
multiply damage, the second doubling only adds the double the original 
damage but again Im pretty sure my interpretation is correct.  This 
certainly produces a when it rains it pours effect.  The round that gets 
you really gets you!

Thats more than enough from me

    'body' => 'In answer to the recent question about how ship types are classified, the
Imperial ship classifications appear to be somewhat arbitrary. Here\'s a
description of the system I used for the Neubayern Federation Navy:

Battleship--  A ship designed to pulverize any other ship, with heavy bay
armament and a big spinal mount. 100,000+ tons.

Battlecruiser--  A ship midway between a battleship and a cruiser, basically
the smallest ship that could still go up against a battleship and not
necessarily be committing suicide. :-) 50,000-100,000 tons.

Strike Cruiser--  A classification invented because I had a "heavy cruiser"
design with more firepower than the old battlecruiser, and I thought that
sounded odd. Eventually, it actually developed a real meaning--a cruiser
designed more for battles than for other cruiser duties. 40,000-50,000 tons.

Heavy Cruiser--  An all-purpose ship that could serve either as a powerful
battle unit, as a patrol unit, or as anything else I came up with. Many of
them served as remarkably well-armed hospital ships. :-)  30,000-40,000 tons.

Light Cruiser/Raiding Cruiser--  Different names for the same thing, this was
a cruiser that specialized in commerce-raiding and long-range strikes at an
enemy\'s rear area. The CL/CR bit rose from the fact that the Alliance needed
a "Raiding Cruiser," which I designed, but the NFN officially disapproved of
raiding (despite wanting the means to do it). 20,000-30,000 tons.

Destroyer--  A ship designed for escort and fire support duty. It differed
from a cruiser primarily in the lack of a spinal mount and significant troop
contingent. 10,000-20,000 tons.

Fleet Escort--  A ship that was designed as a TL12 copy of the Imperial _P.F.
Sloan_ class. I was never very impressed with these (despite their adequate
performance), probably because of their somewhat poorly thought-out origin.
5,000-10,000 tons.

Fleet Tender--  A ship designed to carry battle riders. 100,000+ tons.

Fleet Carrier--  A ship designed to carry fighters for offensive action in
special Heavy Carrier Squadrons. 100,000+ tons.

Carrier--  A ship designed to carry fighters for defensive action
accompanying other types of squadrons. Note that despite the intention, there
wasn\'t a real division of the carrier roles in practice, and the smaller type
got written off as a bad idea. 50,000-100,000 tons.

Heavy Rider--  A battle rider built to carry a spinal mount, with no other
offensive weapons. 20,000 tons.

Light Rider--  A battle rider built to carry offensive bay weapons, and
nothing else. 10,000 tons.

Fast Patrol Boat--  A sort of "super fighter" built around a single 100-ton
bay. It was an experimental design that was supposed to operate just like a
really big, really tough fighter.

Fighter--  All of these were originally meant to engage enemy capital ships,
but it didn\'t work this way. Only the 90-ton FA-5 Krait was up to fighting
ships with an realistic chance of success. The Krait was also being tested as
a glorified point defence system for engaging incoming missiles.

1) The economics of building and running starships as set forth in various 
   CT and MegaT products makes it impossible for a high-population world to 
   base it\'s food supply on imports; the available trade fleet is simply not 
   big enough to import a significant amount of food. (A low or medium 
   population world can do it if it relies on the trade fleet of a nearby 
   high-population world). (Possiby things have changed with TNE, but if so 
   I\'d like to see some figures.) Glisten MUST produce nearly all of it\'s
   own food (And why do you think that a TL 15 society will have to make
   do with processed algae?)

2) History has shown that people can stand quite a long siege on low rations. 
   Even if Glisten imported, say, 10% of it\'s food, and even if those 10% 
   meant the difference between just getting by and slow starvation, Glisten 
   could hold out for a long time. Time enough for the Imperium to free the 
   aforementioned food-supplying worlds. And, of course, Glisten could
   always import food from worlds farther away; it would cost more, but 
   Glisten is one of the four richest systems in the Spinward Marches. Not
   to mention one of the four most important systems to the Imperial Navy.

3) Glisten is 20-30 parsec from the nearest substantial Aslan world. It
   will be incredible easy for the Imperium to disrupt their supply lines.

4) Aslan ihatei do not have the strength to stand angainst even a modest
   Imperial fleet. Split up and spread out across all these agricultural
   worlds they become even easier to deal with.

[About the strength of Aslan ihatei: It cost money to outfit ihatei fleets, 
money that the clan must deduct from it\'s naval budget. Outfit too many 
and you friendly neighbouring rival clan will jump your clan holdings at 
home. Ihatei fleets consist of roughly 50% fighting ships and 50% transport 
ships (the cost of their scout ships is negligible in comparison to the other
two ship types). This cuts their fighting strength in half. Ihatei fleets 
are outfitted with obsolescent clan vessels, making the typical ihatei 
fleet TL 12 and jump-3, worse even than Imperial subsector forces, let 
alone Imperial regulars. Strategically there runs a broad starless gap of 
more than 3 parsecs\' width through the Trojan Reach from the Great Rift to 
Beyond. Only in two places can jump-3 ships cross this gap without using 
drop tanks or deep space fuel depots. Given a half-decent spy network a
reasonably competent Imperial admiral coud garrison the two choke points
and patrol the rest of the far side to seriously hinder the buildup of drop 
tanks and the laying of fuel depots. Politically the ihatei come from 29
major and scores of minor clans. The biggest clan can hardly represent more
than 5% of the total Aslan strength. If they act independently their fleets
will be small enough to be threathened even by individual Imperial squadrons,
and if they cooperate they have to work out whose ships goes where in any
fleet action (What clan admiral will consent to having his ships blown up to 
destroy an Imperial fleet so that the othert clans can reap the reward?)]

(Then there\'s the problem of defending your wives and cubs once you\'ve
managed to settle them somewhere. Remember the world where all the humans 
died of a mysterious disease which didn\'t bother the Aslans? Yeah, right!
If that really happened that world would be glowing in the dark a few
months later).

Uncle!  I don\'t have *TCS* so I can\'t discuss it.  We\'ve fallen over into

Yes, I know.  This is where we agree.  There are Real World examples of
*economic* cycles, but . . .

Why?  This is what I\'m having difficulty with.  You realize just *one* 
single example of a world that went *down* in TL and then back up would
make your case?  So far, I haven\'t seen such an example.

I think you\'re confusing the *use* of technology with the ability to
*produce* technology.  I think this figures in the historical example of
Regina that you keep using.  (I\'ll get to that in a bit.)  Nevertheless,
I\'ll give you this Depression-era `techno-economic\' cycle if you\'ll grant
me that the *keiritsu* are a good example of feudal technocracy.

Okay, a poor analogy but you get my point.

But I wouldn\'t call that capability the same as the tech level of the folks
that built the boiler.  Again, I think you\'re confusing use with the
ability to produce.  Didn\'t we already settle on that a long time ago?
("That" being the idea that TL measures the ability to *produce* a certain
level of technology rather than the mere use or presence of it.)

This is a good rationale.  I can accept this, but . . .

*TCS* *also* gives much bigger fleets than the MegaTraveller *Rebellion
Sourcebook*, another role-playing *and* later-occurring source.  Since *5FW*
and *RS* seem to be somewhat in agreement, one might make the case for
accepting them over *TCS* and *HG*.  I\'m not necessarily proposing this,
I\'m just trying to point out that the choice isn\'t as clear to me as
it seems to be to others.

I don\'t think it\'s appropriate to judge works outside the era they were
created.  My point is that if Piper had been writing in the late \'70s,
I doubt this particular difference would exist, just as it was `impossible\'
for the folks at GDW to create an `unenlightened\' Sword Worlds in 1978.

But isn\'t this information no more `reliable\' than early `official\' data
that painted the Zhos as `mind-sucking totalitarians\'?  We have to accept
that these sorts of observations reflect the bias of whatever Imperial
`observer\' provided the information.  GDW has established a tradition of
painting such sources as being `biased\' to one degree or another.  That\'s
always been one of the appeals of Traveller to me.  Every point of view
is ambiguous - no simplistic `chaotic good\' templates here!

Okay, let\'s a gree to disagree.  This whole Piper bit is an obscure tangent
anyway.  (But I\'ll bet some TML\'ers are out combing the shelves of used
book stores for Piper works!)

I *get* the *economic* fluctuation, what I don\'t get is how *technological*
ability gets tied to it!  Beside your Depression-era example (which 
represents the most serious economic cycle ever *and* confuses use with
ablity to produce) I can\'t think of any other.

Basic scientific method:  my explanation of "slow, steady, uneventful"
growth explains the observable facts without any need of your mysterious
cycles.  On the other hand, just *one* example of a *down-turn* would make
your case.  So far, it hasn\'t been made.  (And things like the Long Night
or the Viral Collapse don\'t count!)

Okay, here\'s where I think you\'re confusing *use* with *ability to produce*.
The comment above suggests to me that you\'re assuming Regina was at TL 10
in 75.  How could it possibly be at the time it was settled?  There were
no factories, no maintenance facilities, no *anything*!  The only
technological capability in the system was on the settlement ship(s).
Maybe these were at TL 7 or something but it must have been *decades*
(if not longer) before any starships were being built on Regina.

Of course, this all goes to pieces if you don\'t accept the `ability to
produce\' definition for TL.  The problem with `use\' is that every world
on the map becomes *at least* TL 9 every time a starship lands!

Well, at least we\'ve found something to agree upon again.  :-)

Bingo!  You\'ve caught me.  This is how I understand a feudal technocracy
from reading Piper.  Since I believe the GDW Sword Worlds have a great deal
in common with Piper\'s I accept that GDW must have lifted the idea of a
feudal technocracy from Piper.

Not that I have come across.

> Have there ever been a formal feudal technocracy in Real Life?

Yes, I think the Japanese *keiritsu* (which is not a `corporate government\'
but I\'ll get to that in a bit) is a feudal technocracy.

This is good, but you\'re about to confuse *owning* the means of production
with *managing* an operation, i.e. a corporate government.

A corporate government is a specialized form of autocracy.  In a corporate
government everyone involved is an *employee* of the person(s) in charge.
They have no choice but to follow the dictates of the manager or leave
the company.  Maybe I led you astray by describing the `king\' in a feudal
technocracy as a `CEO\'.  This was inaccurate and I apologize.  The `king\'
is like the Chairman of the Board of Directors (often also the CEO).  As
such she is repsonsible for seeing that the will of the shareholders is
carried out.

In a corporate government the CEO does not have to listen to the Vice
Presidents or other officers of the company -  she gives the orders and
they carry them out.  In a feudal technocracy, the Chairman ignores
the voices of the other Directors (who represent blocs of shareholders)
at her peril.  When things get tough, the directors *remove* the Chairman
and find a replacement.  In the corprate model, when things get tough
for an Executive Vice President, she finds another job (or jumps out
a window).

In a feudal technocracy the `king\' owns the largest bloc of shares of
*everything* but he doesn\'t necessarily own everything.  If no one owns a
controlling bloc you get balkanization, like Joyeuse.  The `king\' may
own everything, may own a majority of shares, or may own a plurality of
shares (the biggest bloc but not a majority).  `Fief\' holders under the
`king\' will have stronger positions (and more independence) as the `king\'
owns less of the total holdings.

A good modern example outside the *keiritsu* would be the influence of
pension fund managers on corporate America today.  Because pension funds
often hold huge blocs of stock in a corporation they are able to influence
the policies and practices of the corporation.  They are, in effect, the
`fiefholders\' of the Chairman or `king\' who may still control the largest
bloc of shares but is no where near having a majority holding.

The key element here is that in a feudal technocracy the economic influence
of shareholders translates directly into politcal power.

> Granted, but the only way you can get that influence is if the king of
> Gram allows you to buy that controlling interest.

No, only if he owns everything.  If he only owns a plurality or majority
his `barons\' can sell their shares at will.

> The king theoretically _owns_ those shares and
> what you pay for must be the right to benefit from them. And one of the

Right, and if King Harald buys an interest in Gram\'s holdings he becomes
a player in the political system there.  He may choose to honor his
`bond\' to King Angus (sorry, I\'m sticking with Piper) or he may not.  My
point is that since, under my world view, Sacnoth is the strongest 
economic power, Harald will one day triumph over Angus.  Unless of course
Angus has managed to control all the shares on Gram, in which case Gram
becomes an autocracy rather than a feudal technocracy.  (And then Harald
just uses his higher TL military to defeat Angus!)

I\'ll give you this is you give me an example of a downward turn in your
cycles, otherwise I\'m sticking with the scientific method.  :-)

I think I\'ve made a decent start.

sense in light of the Regency\'s recent history.  This means that military 
force designs will have been strongly influenced by the Rebellion, the 
Black War and by VIRUS.  


Lets look at these historical events in reverse order.  VIRUS is a major 
problem for the Regency.  Every peice of electronics needs to be 
reconsidered.  All of the high tech logistical and staff assistance computers
in the Regency\'s Military need to be redesigned and made as VIRUS resistant as
possible.  There might even be a trend in the Regency\'s military to look for 
low tech solutions to military requirements.  A FN-FAL has no electronic parts
to host a VIRUS egg, for example.  

The Black war poses some very challenging problems for the Regency.  
Having to deal with a raider jumping in at the 100 diameter limit, 
blasting at full accelleration to the target, dumping its bombload of 100 
Megaton Nukes, and coasting out to the 100 diameter limit to jump away is 
a frightening threat.  Vampire vessels can exercise this same tactic so 
keeping a defense for this sort of attack is still required in the new era.

The rebellion suggests that the Regency should design a "Military with a 
conscious".  Officers should be expected to exercise some judment on 
following orders.  A ship captain assigned to carpet bomb an orphanage 
should be expected to use his or her conscious to conclude that this is a 
wastefull unmilitary activity and that this order should be refused.

I\'m just scratching the surface here.  I think that any military force 
designed for the Regency will be shaped by its history  and the history 
of its neighbors.  It will also be shaped by the perceived needs of the 
Regency.  To design a military for the Regency requires that we identify 
these needs and find possible solutions for them.  I realise that this is 
not as glamourous as deciding how many MBT\'s per platoon, but by building 
a firm foundation first we will save ourselves a great deal of pain later on.

sizes, bear in mind that you are talking about two different sets of 
numbers.  TCS has budgets based on population and governments, and this 
figure covers _everything_.  The fleet sizes in Rebellion Sourcebook and 
elsewhere are _not_ everything.
 
The figures in Rebellion Sourcebook only include cruisers, carriers, 
battleships and some escorts; they omit entire squadrons like AssaultRons 
(which I think explains a good point that someone made about how all the 
invasion forces could be carried by the number given for ships available 
to Dulinor).  I would imagine that the figure would certainly only be 
operational ships, and so would exclude ships in mothballs or "ordinary".
 
The figures in Rebellion Sourcebook are internally inconsistent anyway.  
Even if you interpret the 1000 ships figure as being each for numbered 
and numbered reserve fleets, it still seems small; 16 minimum size 
numbered fleets of 50 ships is 800 ships, which leaves little leeway.  If 
you don\'t believe that the 1000 ships is each for numbered and numbered 
reserve fleets, it is even further out.
 
To further explain the apparent inconsistency, there is the maintenance 
overhead aspect of the TCS rules (10% for operational ships and 1% for 
ships in ordinary).  Both the economics of shipbuilding and published 
sources surely show that there would be many ships in ordinary.  I have 
not seen this taken into account in some of the discussions.
(Incidentally, does anyone know why these are so high? Operational 
civilian ships only need 0.1%).  
 
Anyway, if you take Glisten as an example, it has an annual military 
budget of about TCr4.  Even if it had the biggest yards in the galaxy, it 
could still only build TCr40 worth of operational ships, as maintenance 
of these would soak up the entire military budget.  In Fighting Ships of 
the Shattered Imperium (which I know is not the best source of designs in 
the world, but it is official), TCr40 doesn\'t buy all that many _big_ 
ships; Battleships and Dreadnoughts are commonly TCr1 or more.
 
Even when you add in the taxation income from the rest of the subsector, 
the figures do not grow by orders of magnitude (particularly if you 
reduce the value of the money by starport/TL), since Glisten dominates 
virtually every other world in the subsector.
 
Anyway, it looks to me that GDW have always been deliberately vague about 
definitions of numbers, to avoid apparent contradictions like this.  So 
you are all free to some extent to interpret the numbers how you like.

Not quite. In your discussion with Cynthia and Steve you have two different
conditions (the different sizes of fleets) that is irreconcilable and
consequently the problem of which source to accept. In the economy question 
we have one condition set forth by one source and not mentioned in any 
other source. Since there is no contradiction I submit that we should go by
the one source we do have (Actually, we have two since _Striker_ gives
similar (though not identical) results. _Striker_ and _TCS_ are, however,
contemporary). The only known source we have on the effect of TLs on the
economy states that the difference of one TL on otherwise identical worlds
is that the higher TL planet\'s money is worth 5% more.

>>economic instability _should_ result in TL instability. 
> 
>Why? This is what I\'m having difficulty with.

Is the difficulty with the fact that there are no examples, or is it the
very concept you can\'t accept? If the first there\'s not much I can do 
since I proposed them to explain somthing else. Since they are, therefor,
merely inferred I don\'t see how you can expect an example. If I had an
example I wouldn\'t have to infer it. If it\'s the concept, however, I shall
try to illustrate. Not that technological cycles must be, but merely that
they could be:

Example 1:
"I/S Hansen Motor" on Gram who builds jump-1 and -2 engines decides to
expand and builds an new assembly line in their factory for producing 
jump-3 engines. Gram now becomes TL 12 in space technology (by definition). 
"Sleipner Spring-motorer", the well-known jump engine manufacturer on
Sacnoth notes the subsequent drop in sales of jump engines to Gram and 
lowers the price on jump-3 engines. Baron Hansen decides that he can\'t afford
to fight this move and converts his jump-3 assembly line to make jump-2
engines. Gram is now, once again, TL 11. 

Example 2:
As before, but this time Hansen manages to get some other nobles to back
him and proceeds to sell jump-3 engines to all of Sleipner\'s former customers 
driving Sleipner off the market. Sacnoth is now TL 11 (in space tech).

(Btw. there\'s another, perfectly simple, explanation of how Gram could be
as strong as Sacnoth (Note that I don\'t agree that they need to be): Gram
could be solidly TL 11 in most areas and TL 12 in space technology while
Sacnoth was TL 12 in just enough parts to qualify for TL 12 status but of
only TL 10-11 in other, vital areas (Check _World Builder\'s Handbook_ for
details).)

How many worlds do we have any historical data on? A mere handful. While an
example might prove my point, the absence dosen\'t disprove it (since I\'m
merely trying to establish that it could happen).

No I don\'t. If the depression drove some people to abandon their cars, a
more severe depression could, conceivably, have driven almost everybody
to do so. If that happened, most car factories would close down and very
few new cars would be made (In fact, for a time you might have people 
using old cars that were no longer manufactured  -  a use TL _higher_ 
than the production TL).

Can\'t do that since I still don\'t know exactly how the *keiritsu* work. I\'ll
accept that they form your definition of a feudal technology, but I suspect
that your definition is not the only possible one. Certainly your definition
is not that of a feudal system (though I acknowledge that compound words
sometimes take on a meaning quite different from any of it\'s components. I
would regard that as a bit of a cop-out, though. IMO a feudal technocracy
ought to be feudal in some way).

Neither did I. I said that the people who couldn\'t _build_ a boiler might,
nevertheless, be perfectly capable of repairing it. This was in connection
with being able to maintain higher-han-your-own-TL equipment, remember?

I think so. At least, I heartily concur. TL _ought_ to indicate the ability 
to produce (unfortunately there are countless worlds with low population and 
high TL where that dosen\'t make sense. How can 10 men build a starship?).

Try comparing the _TCS_ naval expenditure of Cr 500 per citizen with the
real world (Double it to account for non-space forces too). A credit is
supposed to correspond to a US$. Now compute the taxes the average 
swordworlder would pay to support 42 200,000 T battleships  -  no, make 
that 500,000-tonners if you like. Compare that figure to the real world.

Do you really think that no contemporary of Piper wrote about social
systems with more equal treatment of men and women than his Sword Worlds?
Or that TCS couldn\'t have gotten away with describing a minor, antagonistic
power as far more repressive than they did?

Because if technology wasn\'t tied to economic features then most every

philosophically induced limits.)

Conceeded, but let me address that confusion of use and ability to produce.
I\'m not confusing the two. But if something becomes too expensive to buy,
don\'t you think that it would shortly thereafter go out of production? So
if use decline sufficiently and does pick up again, the ability to produce
automatically disappears too.

Except that they represent a stagnation of the economy that is quite

is not slow, it\'s moribund.

Right. I will give you those decades. I\'ll even make them centuries. So the
question becomes: Regina was TL 9 in 275. Why did Regina gain only one TL in
EIGHT centuries and two more in two decades?

Funny, I too think that Piper\'s Gram describes a feudal society, possibly
even what GDW thought of when they coined the term \'feudal technocracy\', 
but I disagree that it describes one that works the way you claim. The only 
shares I remember mentioned is the ones in the Tanith Venture, an offworld
commercial venture. Every other \'holding\' in the book is a solid land fief.
The holdings are enhanced by various commercial features like the mines
on Traskon and the Karvall steel mills, but the old feudal fiefs were also
enhanced in value from whatever water mills and mines to be found on them.
Piper\'s Gram is merely a feudal monarchy set in a more technological
advanced age than the medieval feudal monarchies of Terra.

In a feudal society a vassal\'s ability to disregard the dictates of his

obligation to obey his liege lord\'s legitimate orders.

It only just struck me, but why are you assuming that there are any share-
holders? I repeat: "By analogy a feudal technocracy is one where the King 
theoretically owns all the industry (the source of power analogous to land 
in a feudal society) and lends it out in exchange for support."

Who owns the corporation in a corporate government? Who owns it in a feudal
technocracy? What\'s the difference? 

I think it would be useful to agree on the equivalences of various terms
in the three systems we\'re talking about. Here\'s mine:

Traditional feudal society	Corporation		Feudal technocracy

King				     -			King

The king is the man who owns the fiefs and doles them out in return for
support from his vassals. In that respect he is the equivalent of the
owner or the shareholders of a corporation. But an owner\'s power does not
depend on the support of their CEOs, so there is no real correspondence.

 Fief				Corporation		Corporation

Land was what supported the fighting men that was the military power in the
old feudal monarchies. In more advanced societies industrial holdings pro-
duce wealth that pays for military power.

Vassal (Duke/Count/etc.)	CEO			Vassal

The vassal manages the fief for the king. If the fief is an industrial
holding then his work resembles that of a company CEO.

Steward/Reeve/Guard Captain	Company Officer		Company Officer

The officers who helps to run the holding, hired and fired by the man in
charge.

Sub-fief			Subsidiary		Subsidiary

A vassal may parcel out parts of his holding to lesser vassals. 

Feudal service			Dividends		Feudal service

In a feudal society a vassal pays his liege lord with service, not with
money. Shareholders, on the other hand, recieve their pay in money.

     -				Board of Directors	     -
     -				Shareholders		     -

These have no real equivalents in a feudal society.

>In a feudal technocracy the `king\' owns the largest bloc of shares of
>*everything* but he doesn\'t necessarily own everything.  

You didn\'t get this from Piper. Duke Angus owns his holdings outright. Baron
Trask owns all of Traskon. Baron Karvall owns all of Karvall. When Lucas
Trask pledges Traskon in return for a ship, Angus gets the whole bit, not
just a share of it. 

>If no one owns a
>controlling bloc you get balkanization, like Joyeuse.  

If the Dukes can\'t agree on who to support for king you get balkanization.

>A good modern example outside the *keiritsu* would be the influence of
>pension fund managers on corporate America today.  Because pension funds
>often hold huge blocs of stock in a corporation they are able to influence
>the policies and practices of the corporation.  They are, in effect, the
>`fiefholders\' of the Chairman or `king\' who may still control the largest
>bloc of shares but is no where near having a majority holding.

Still sounds like corporate politics. I don\'t see where the feudal bit gets
into it at all. The Chairman of a Corporation dosen\'t excersise _any_
control over the pension funds, does he? The pension fund managers dosen\'t
perform services for the Corporation Chairman, do they (They don\'t even
pay him money). Thus there is no true equivalence between the pension fund 
managers and a fiefholder in a feudal society.

I realize that I assume that the word \'feudal\' in \'feudal technocracy\' has a 
semantic content close to the normal definition of the word and is not a
mere buzz-word. 

>The key element here is that in a feudal technocracy the economic influence
>of shareholders translates directly into politcal power.

In a feudal technocracy industrial holdings IMO takes the place of land for 
the purposes of generating the wealth that translates into power.

>>Granted, but the only way you can get that influence is if the king of
>>Gram allows you to buy that controlling interest.
> 
>No, only if he owns everything.  If he only owns a plurality or majority
>his `barons\' can sell their shares at will.

If he owns them he can dictate who gets to buy them.

>>The king theoretically _owns_ those shares and
>>what you pay for must be the right to benefit from them. And one of the
>>things you must pay with is the promise to support him.
> 
>Right, and if King Harald buys an interest in Gram\'s holdings he becomes
>a player in the political system there.  

But what if King Anders just refuse to let his baron sell his holding?

>He may choose to honor his `bond\' to King Angus 

He damn well better.

>(sorry, I\'m sticking with Piper) 

Why? We are talking about the GDW Sword Worlds, aren\'t we? Why invite
confusion?

>or he may not.  

Thereby forfeiting his right to the fief. 

>My point is that since, under my world view, Sacnoth is the strongest 
>economic power, Harald will one day triumph over Angus.  

1) Being stronger is not an automatic ticket to victory.
2) He isn\'t that much stronger.
3) Assuming just for a moment that your view of feudal technocracies is
   true (which I doubt), the whole concept could as easily work the other 
   way round. King Anders could own huge blocks of Sacnoth industry, making 
   Harald a puppet of his.

>Unless of course
>Angus has managed to control all the shares on Gram, in which case Gram
>becomes an autocracy rather than a feudal technocracy.  

If Anders owns all of Gram he will have to put people in charge of parts of 
it, which could result in various systems, including a feudal technocracy. 

 .(And then Harald
>just uses his higher TL military to defeat Angus!)

Again you assume that Harald and his ancestors would want to conquer Gram
militarily. Again I suggest that they may not be ready to pay the price.

>>>Since, at TL 12, I\'m clearly the strongest economic power

>> Fallacy. See above.

>I\'ll give you this is you give me an example of a downward turn in your

No, I was talking about their respective GPPs. Of course, if King Anders
owns a big slice of Sacnoth, he gets a good slice of their GPP too ;-)

TW 2000 weapons are actually TL 8 (HK G11, FN-FAL).  The idea about the

pretty big TL spread but perhaps the fact that the higher TL force has to 
bring its stuff with it will provide some balance.  There are plenty of 
TL 7 weapons that could take out a TL 12 Grav tank.  

While Im on the subject..does anyone have any knowledge of or experience

to adapt some traveller weapons to the Last Battle system(Sands of War)

TL 8  120 mm Smoothbore 50 Caliber Gun  APFSDSDU will give a Pen rating

TL 11 120 mm Smoothbore ETC Gun  APFSDSCI Pen Rating over 250

It should be an interesting invasion...Id like to keep this discussion 
going.. Lets call this the premise

The PCs are on this TL 7 world and presently 2000+ km from their ship 
(which is in contested territory anyway) and they are racing someone to 
get something and get back to the ship (if it hasnt been captured or 
destroyed)  This works best if the PCs had little or no warning about the 
invasion.  Hell...maybe us TMLers (or whats left of us) can write a

    MY 2 CENTS ON FEUDAL TECHNOCRACY & THE SWORD WORLDS
    ----
    
    	 Reading Hans\' and David\'s discussions on Sword Worlds government 
         prompted me to do some research. Here are my results.
    
    TECHNOCRACY:
    ----
     n.	 Organisation  and management of a county\'s industrial resources by 
         technical experts for the good of the whole community; Hence 
         technocrat, advocate of this.
    
    	 (from the Concise Oxford Dictionary)
    
    FEUDAL TECHNOCRACY:
    ----
    
    	 Government by specific individuals for those who agree to be 
         ruled. Relationships are based on the performance of technical 
         activities which are mutually beneficial.
    
    	 (from TNE, p188).
    
    	 This could be lots of things. However, it sounds like the feudal 
         system we all know from history/hollywood/fantasy role playing 
         could fit in with this. 
    
    CONCLUSION (IMO, of course 8-))
    ----
    
    	 One possible interpretation of a Feudal technocracy comes from 
         combining what we understand by the terms Feudal and Technocracy. 
         
    	 The Feudal bit is in fact just like the Feudal system we know from 
         history, with for example a King and his vassal Nobles (Dukes, 
         Marquis, Counts, Barons, Knights) each of which has his/her own 
         vassals who comprise the remainder of the population (e.g. 
         Upperclass, Middleclass, and Lowerclass). And of course Nobles may 
         also have lesser ranking Nobles as vassals, depending on your 
         version of the Feudal system.
    
    	 Each Noble (including the King) has a staff (e.g. a council of 
         advisors supported by a  \'civil service\' or \'public service\') to 
         assist in the administration of his domains. When it comes to 
         managing the industry within a noble\'s domain, the staff are 
         technical experts in that relevant technologies. This last is the 
         \'technocracy\' bit. The ruling classes believe in this method of 
         managing industry, which makes them technocrats. By analogy, the 
         practice would probably extend to the management of fields other 
         than those traditionally thought of as comprising \'industry\'.
    
    	 To me the above description seems to fit the term \'Feudal 
         Technocracy\' better than David Johnsons *kieretsu* (sp?) model. 
         I don\'t know enough about *kieretsu* to say whether or not they 
         also fit the description. To me they sound like a better model for 
         Corporate governments.
    
    So, what do people think? Comments welcome.

Well, we all know the REAL reason for that is that Regina was made out to be
such
an important world in the Marches\' affairs that having such a relatively low
tech level
as 10 seemed a bit peculiar.  Even more, it\'s forward location and Tech-10
defenses
made it rather vulnerable to Zhodani attack, as 5FW players may know.

The solution was to tweak the TL upward slightly during the shift to MT.

I tend to regard the lower tech level as one of those "early Traveller
inconsistencies",
like the major warship status of the Kinunir, and retroactively give it the
higher tech.

Otherwise, attribute the increase to the 5FW.  As a solution it has its
problems,
but its the closest thing to a reasonable rationalization available.

Here\'s some additional material for *Shall Not Perish*, our TML Regency
sourcebook.

We\'ve already identified the following political blocs for the Regency:

Isolationists want to maintain the Quarantine.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Trin\'s Veil?
Expansionists want to move out into the Wilds.
 -Enjoys Instellarms backing.
Democrats seek to expand `democratic\' values.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Gazulin?
Aristocrats want to maintain the noble aristocracy.
 -Led by Duchess Elane of Mora
 -Possibly known as Muudashirists?
 -Enjoy much support among the House of Nobles
Tolerants favor a relaxation of psi prejudices.
 -Discretely supported by SuSAG.
Santanocheevists oppose any moves toward accommodation with the Zhodani.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Rhylanor?
 -Enjoys Instellarms backing.
Imperialists still hope to one day resurrect the Old Imperium.
 -Led by the Duke/Duchess of Deneb?
 -Enjoys support from Tukera Lines.
Autnomists favor independence and a complete break from the Imperial past.

I\'d like to propose two additional blocs:

Interventionists want the Regency to play a stronger role in the affairs
  of individual worlds.
 -Enjoys support among most megacorps.
Sovereigntists oppose efforts to limit the sovereignty of individual worlds.

From what I recall of TNE\'s spiel on starships, you now have lots of 
crew because you can\'t trust your computers any more (or maybe that\'s 
the inference I drew). It makes things kind of difficult for 
retro-designing old rules starships -- I bought FFS over the weekend 
and tried to redesign the Fiery class GE using FFS. I *think* I\'m 
doing the design right but I still end up with a fast escort with less 
armour than the Gazelle and a measly 17 G-turns of thrust.

I think some tweaking of the engineering/maintenance numbers for crew 
sizes are in order. What I plan to do is compare the engineering crew
requirements in CT, TCS and MT and see how they look compared to 
TNE/FFS. If anyone\'s interested, I\'ll report back to the list.

You said it. I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1983 or so and I don\'t 
like the idea of using TNE rules for the Imperium. That said, I think 
the new rules are failry good (except for the personal damage rules, 
but I\'m working on that :-). As a result, I\'m working on a 
non-Imperial background at the moment which has been stalled somewhat 
due to getting FFS and discovering all those variant technologies ...

Pete,

I tried out you FFS Excel template for <2cm slug waepons.  While I liked it
ALOT there is one major error.  In the Design Evaluation Box the Burst Recoil
Calculation is not correct.  It only gives the Burst size not the recoil
calculation for a burst, which is what should be displayed there.

Please make the correction and email the TML and me when it is complete.

Thanks,

Kevin

I like it.  How\'s this?

In order to be appear in the digest, messages must contain one or more
codes (listed below) embedded in the Subject line, seperated from the
rest of the text by a non-alphabetic character. These codes are used by
the digester to create custom, filtered digests. For example, the
following would appear in digests filtered to include Classic Traveller
and 3rd Imperium messages:

	Subject: CT,IMP: How many Ancients can dance on the head of a pin?

_____RULESET______ ______ERA_______  ________GENERAL________ ____DESIGN SIGS____
CT  Classic Trav   IMP 3rd Imperium  ANN   Announcements     VDES Vehicle Design

  Credit Squadron  AHIS Alternate	   specific stuff
FFS Fire Fusion &       Histories

So folks, what do *you* think? Have I misplaced FFS? I think before we
add any more categories, we\'ll probably want to remove some. I think 21
categories is a good working maximum.

    TCS maintenance costs include stuff like crew payrolls, military 
pensions, life support costs, berthing costs, bases, training schools, 
etc, etc, etc, that are paid for separately from "annual maintenance" 
when using the role-playing rules (CT Book 2, High Guard, MT, TNE) for 
ships.  

>In Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium (which I know is not the

"Shattered Ships" is utterly worthless as a source of ANY information,
official or unofficial.  It is so riddled with typos that EVEN GDW has
apologized for it; furthermore, the ships that aren\'t typographical 
errors violate the published rules six ways from Sunday.  Ignore it.

Hans & David:

    Yes.  I excuse this rate of progress in most of the Imperium by 
chalking it up to "Vilani Cultural Influence"; the Sword Worlds has no 
such excuse.  Rather the opposite:  technophile Terran cultural 
heritage, surrounded by enemies, constantly fighting wars.  You need a 
really good explanation why Sacnoth isn\'t TL21 already...  

Feudal Technocracy:

Hans:
>I realize that I assume that the word \'feudal\' in \'feudal 
>technocracy\' has a semantic content close to the normal definition of
>the word and is not a mere buzz-word.

    So do I. If anything, the "technocracy" part is the buzz-word.  
David, what you keep describing sounds like a plain old Corporate 
state (Gov 1) to me.  Frankly, a true "Feudal Technocracy" as 
described in the CT/MT/TNE definition is either extremely rare or 
describes the standard Vilani bureaucracy when it is still small 
enough to be functional.  Most non-Vilani Gov 5 worlds are probably 
just High-Tech Feudalisms, a la Piper\'s Gram, or the worlds of the 
Keltiad (Patricia McNeally).  

    To further muddy the issue, I have somewhere an issue of High 
Passage or JOTAS (I forget which), in which Mark Miller describes the 
Traveller government codes.  He said that these government codes DO 
NOT actually describe the whole government, but how it appears to 
outsiders (travellers) that must deal with it (i.e., what kind of 
government hassles your PCs get...).  Don\'t pin too much on a single 
UPP digit; set up your world\'s government anyway you like, and pick a 
UPP digit that approximates it.  There will be several to chose from.  
Is the U.S.  a representative democracy (gov 4) (based on government 
structure as outlined in the Constitution), a civil service 
bureaucracy (gov 8) (based on how the Federal government is supposed 
to work), an impersonal bureaucracy (gov 9) (based on how the Federal 
government usually works) or a charismatic oligarchy (gov C)(the 
country is really run by a relatively small coterie of elected and 
appointed officials who know each other, pat each other\'s backs, and 
get the job by looking good in 30-second sound bites)?  

    As with TechLevel definitions, GDW created endless fodder for 
arguments by mixing structural definitions (Representative Democracy, 
Tech level of a given artifact), with procedural or functional 
definitions (impersonal bureaucracy, production level of a world).  

When doing detailed looks at a world, I find that GURPS Space has 
better random-generation tables for government type than Traveller. 
The government descriptions are more informative, too.

David:
>I\'ll give you this is you give me an example of a downward turn in your

You are confusing "scientific method" and Occam\'s Razor.  OR is not 
"scientific method", it is simply a useful heuristic for sorting out 
multiple explanations.  It is not necessarily correct, either.

    Yep.  I can take a 1st ed.  AD&D character, monster or scenario 
and drop it *unchanged* into a 2nd ed.  AD&D campaign.  Any necessary 
changes are trivial enough to do in my head as I encounter them -- for 
the most part.  The only exceptions are dragons and the "d" critters 
- -- most of them went thru upscaling in combat abilities and hit dice, 
and scenarios involving them have to be rebalanced.
    To drop a CT/MT scenario into TNE, I have to redo the NPCs, the 
equipment, the animals, and the ships.  All that is left is the plot, 
and most of the MT stuff had really poor plots.  In some cases, the 
change from unlimited delta-V thrusters (or CT non-specific "maneuver 
drive") to limited delta-V reaction drives totally throws the plot out 
the window.  Let\'s not even mention that if you use the TNE "Virus" 
background, all the old 3rd Imperium background material is worse than 
useless.  TNE is an entirely NEW game with the Traveller name still 
attached...

    This may be true of, say, Ley sector, but the Spinward Marches 
faces one of the 3rd Imperium\'s two biggest enemies, and GDW material 
has repeatedly stated that the Spinward Marches, Deneb, and Corridor 
Fleets are *OVERSIZED* because of the Zhodani and Vargr threats.  
There is no greater threat besides the Solomani, and GDW material has 
depicted the 3I deploying more forces against the Zho/Vargr front than 
the Solomani Rim -- apparently, the Solomani were trounced during the 
Rim War...  <sarcasm intended>.

This is great work, Wes!  The reason I\'ve been pursuing this discussion was
to generate this sort of information.  All these folks arguing for different
rules isn\'t particularly interesting *or* useful.  IMHO, though, efforts
like this are.

See!  This is useful information.  It adds to our understanding of the
Regency (or the Imperium) and is a great contribution to *Shall Not Perish*.

You mean there is another course besides endless rants about one\'s favorite

I do too.  Thanks, Wes, for actually *trying* to reconcile the divergent
rules information rather than merely rejecting out of hand the source that
you disagree with.  (of course, it still doesn\'t explain the *5FW* counters
for the Sword Worlds . . . .)

I\'m sorry if it has appeared acrimonious.  That certainly hasn\'t been my 
intention or impression.  And I really don\'t care *which* \'reality\' we
should accept.  I\'ve been trying to understand *why* we should accept either
one over the other.  IMHO, the ideal situation would be to reconcile *all*
official information.  I recognize that this may not be possible but I
think Wes has shown us that it\'s less impossible in this case then some
folks think.

Thanks to Wes I don\'t think we do *have* to start with this assumption.  If
we broaden the discussion beyond mere issues of rules to include the entire
campaign we recognize that *rules* are just a tool that can be used to
facilitate the larger endeavor of the entire campaign background.

See, here we are again.  What\'s the value of basing the decision merely
upon \'rules\' data like population and \'economics\'?  If we remember that
this is an entire role-playing campaign, we see there are other aspects
like politics and culture to help us explain these \'facts\'.

This may be but you have to admit it is based upon a \'rules-only\' point
of view.

(Yeek!  This has been going on for a while)

First - I have a terrible feeling that _Ihatei of Doom_ will soon become
a trademark.  I wish I could think of clever things like that.   It could be
the second in a string of movies about a famous interstellar archaeologist
wandering the Spinward Marches.  In the first feature, Rhylanor James
and the Lost Oytrip, our hero discovers an ancient device designed to
communicate directly with Grandfather, only to have it stolen by the
perfidious Zhodani.  The second, Rhylanor James and the Ihatei of Doom
finds our hero saving the Domain of Deneb from a secret cult of Aslan
worshippers, with the help of a somewhat tubby Newt by the name of
Slick Round.  The final installment, Rhylanor Jones and the Last
Emperor finds our hero travelling to Usdiki to find the whereabouts of
Strephon\'s Cloning Machine, with the help of Dr. Quentin James (who is of
course secretly Rhylanor\'s father).  On the way, Rhylanor alienates an
entire army of Emperor worshippers, who do their best to stop our hero
out of a fear that mass production of Strephons will severely lower his
market value.

Sorry, I digress.  Long weekends are good for the soul! 

There are a few problems with Hans arguments.  The most obvious one
 (and the least satisfying as this is the source of all the hubbub) is this:

The Aslan conquered Glisten subsector, therefore the Aslan were capable
of conquering Glisten subsector.

This is all well and good, but how?  Hans Rancke points out that

>Aslan Ihatei do not have the strenght to stand against even a modes
>Imperial fleet  Split up and spread out ... they become even easier to deal
>with.

I was initially inclined to agree with this statement, but it is based on two
assumptions that may not be true:

1.  The Imperium had a modest fleet available to stop the Aslan
2.  The Aslan fleet was quantitatively and qualitatively weaker than
      the local Imperial forces.

Remember, at this point the Domain of Deneb (DD) has been cut off
from the Imperium, and has been fighting a war with large-scale
vargr invasions and pirate raids along the coreward and trailing borders.
This invasion was serious enough to allow the loss of Depot in Deneb
Sector, a major source of IN reserve forces and equipment.  These
raids began before the Ihatei invasion, and many forces from the
Trojan Reach area were likely drawn into the conflict coreward, leaving
frontier defenses in that traditionally quiet area severly weakened.

As the ease of spread of the Rebellion has shown, there was significant
discord in the Imperium.  It is possible that while the fleets of DD did
not rally to Lucan\'s or Dulinor\'s call, many individual waships might
have done so.  Others may have seen an opportunity to turn bandit,
join up with the Vilani or Antareans, or left the Imperium altogether.
Significant naval forces would be occupied with internal security duties,
further weakening frontier defenses.

As to the strength of the Ihatei, do not base your assumptions on human
or Imperial norms.  The Aslan are a warrior culture.  This means the Aslan
will devote significantly greater portions of the GAP (Gross Aslan Product)
to military equipment.  A warrior strives for the best weapons he can get,
so much of that money will go to ships.  I obviously have no good
historical precedents (not many starships in the middle ages) but I do
point out the relatively large size of military forces in the Germanies in
the 19th Century.  I would not be surprised if the Alsan could field a
military two to three times the size of a comparable sized human empire.

As to tech levels; don\'t assume that a TL12 or 13 society has any real
technological uniformity.  As I point out above, the Aslan are a militant
race.  The females are likely to be the scientific brains of the region,
but the funding for scientific research will ultimately be controlled
by the various (male) clan heads.  While the males will not concern
 themselves with financial details, they will expect a useful return on the
investment of clan funds.  Picture this scenario:  Two female Aslan
 scientists, Alwaro and Elwaro, go before the Clan\'s head, Kytharako,
advised by his cheif finance officer Lyhara, a female.

Alwaro:  Honored Sire, I seek funds for a project.
Kytharako (looking bored):  What is it now?  Another study of (hiss)
                                                           Leaf-eaters?
Alwaro (looking abashed):  Yes, Honored Sire.
Kytharako:  Such talk bores me!  Be gone from my presence!
                         (looking at Elwaro)  Another scientist?  I suppose you 
wish
                         to study snowflakes?
Elwaro:  Your words are true, Honored Sire.
Kytharako:  Whay should I give you more than I gave Alwaro?
Lyhara:  Honored Sire!  Do you not remember?  Elwaro presented you
                   with the new plasma focusing ring last year.  She has greatly
                   enhanced the power of our house!
Kytharako:  What has this to do with snowflakes?
Elwaro:  Noble Sir, the ways of science are strange.  By studying the
                  crystals of nature, perhaps I can learn to make better laser
                  mirrors, and increase the range of our clan\'s strength.
Kytharako:  Khhrrr, you are wiser than many would realize.  The money
                          is yours.

What I am trying to get at with this pathetic attempt at virtual roleplay is
that Alsan science will focus on weapons technology as a means of
fiscal survival.  I would image Aslan weapons technology might be 1 or
2 levels higher than their general tech level.  A TL12 squadron would be
an unequal challenge to a TL15 squadron, but three TL12 squadrons with
TL14 weapons would be easily an equal match to the TL15 squadron.

Supply Lines:  The Ihatei are coming to DD to settle and stay.  They are
probably expecting to live off the wealth of the new territory rather than
surviving off of a tenuous supply line.  Given the rapidity of their conquest
of the Trojan Reach, I am sure they managed to seize a respectable
industrial base; certainly enough to maintain a steady supply of
ammunition.

Food Supplies:  While Glisten might be able to raise bulk food supplies
readily enough, there are many trace elements (certain minerals and
vitamins) that do not lend themselves to hydroponic agriculture.  Since
I am writing this at TL8, I have no idea if a better method exists at TL15,
but the fragility of these closed ecosystems in Traveller leads me to
beleive this is still a problem.  The various laws of entropy make it
clear that a sealed system cannot sustain itself indefinitely.  Blockade
running might slow the collapse of the Glisten artificial ecosystem,
but that will end once the Aslan roll up the systems around Glisten.  With
no base to mount a releif effort from, the Imperium is not going to be
able to releive Glisten.  I think the Rebellion Sourcebook data strongly
infers that the DD was unable to mount effective counterattacks into
Ihatei territory until well after the loss of Glisten.  If a counterattack was
impossible (for whatever reason) a releif mission to beseiged Glisten
would be equally wasteful of time and effort.

In your last paragraph, you make your strongest point: the Ihatei have
to hold what they seize.  Frankly, I think that is not going to be possible
for the Aslan, due to their small population base.  Their only chance is
to win the hearts and minds of humans on occupied worlds, and the
occasional nuclear or biological attack on DD worlds is going to make
that very hard for the Ihatei.  Hmmm... maybe we need to start up a new
furor/discussion frenzy on human resistance actions in the occupied
territories.

Thank you for your response, Hans.  Despite the hammering above, I
though your arguments were very good.  In all honesty, I think the 
battle lines in GDW\'s Rebellion Sourcebook were mostly random, and
intended to add a threat of danger for some complacent old Spinward
Marches campaigns.  So please dont think I am picking on you; I am
always this obnoxious after a three-day weekend.

    'body' => 'Yo Folkes,
	I\'ve vaguely watched some of the debate on the takeover
of Glisten. I don\'t have my spinward marches map with me on
this trip so some of the following points may be off but bear
with me. The one crucial fault I find in most for the arguments
is this:
	STOP THINKING LIKE AN ASLAN MALE.
	THINK LIKE AN ASLAN FEMALE.
	I think it is easy enough to prove, as many have done, that
a military takeover of Glisten by an Ihatei fleet is laughable at
best. However if you think about it from a non-military point of
view it may not be so funny...

	Picture this: An Aslan male sits at home having breakfast
with his four wives and associated residents. The wind blows
through the veranda and a bird gurgles in a nearby cage. The third
setting of tea has been brewed, stewed, and served.
	Husband: "Wife #1. I am experiencing... the urge."
	Wife #1 quickly considers the impact on her schedule versus
the political advantage of having a daughter to marry off (Remember
the women are the medical technicians. Fertility treatment and
control? You bet!) Lightning quick whisker flicking and ear movements
pass between the four wives as the negotiating starts all unseen
by the husband who is inhaling the vapours of his tea. "My Lord."
Comments #1 verbally, It\'s been... so long."
	Husband: "Yes, but. I remember you speaking to me about
biological determinism. It is simply something I must do. The
Imperium will be a great enemy." He serenely takes a sip of tea.
	All the body-language fencing between the wives stops
instantly. "But they would outnumber us 50 to 1 and they have
a much more advanced fleet!" said Wife #4 who hadn\'t learned the
bloodymindedness of men yet.
	"Yes, it will be a great fight." He blows little bubbles in
his cooling tea. "Number four, you will arrange a meeting with
my brother\'s family, Number three, you will see to the maintenance
of the ships and thingies, Number two, um. Well, Number one, you
know about these things, see to it." He then goes back to
blowing bubbles in his tea. Well pleased with himself.

	Aslan males seldom think without acting. Whereas Aslan
females seldom act without thinking. In this sort of situation
the women are faced with the irremediable bloodymindedness of
the men and take what contingencies they can. Delays can be laid
but the inevitability of it all has to be catered for.
	The prime focus of a high-status woman (wife or sister)
is that of a corporate executive. The forces she has to bear are
not military. One family unit may not present much military or
economic power but given that the male Aslan "itch" for land is
not an isolated occurrence there are likely to be quite a few
wanting to seek their death amongst the rather superior Imperials.
For every male with enough ships and arms to even think of
getting to the Imperium there are at least two or more wives and
female relatives running the economic concerns that support the
unit.
	With the above scenario repeated several times over the women
are going to start getting together to pool their resources.
The Aslan have, on average, a lower tech level than the Imperium.
This means that their money is worth less, or, more importantly,
an Imperial credit goes further buying Aslan goods. Pushing
trade links into the Spinward marches, naturally heading toward
Glisten, trade centre of that area, is facilitated for the
Aslan because of this. Effectively exporting cheap Aslan labour
does create a trade deficit but remember this is the women\'s
equivalent of moving the economy onto a war footing. The deficit
can be padded by reinvesting the capital in high-tech Imperial
goods. These can be sold further back in Aslan territory and
much of the loss recuperated. It is a long trade link but here
the women are converting capital reserves into economic investment.
Considering the alternative is putting the money into military
hardware that is almost certainly going to get blown away it
is the better choice.
	So we have the Aslan pushing their goods in Glisten
sub-sector and creating an export market for Imperial goods.
An aid to this process are all the Aslan who have moved there
looking for land pre-rebellion quite peacefully which is
well documented. Don\'t just think of the Aslan males squatting
quite happily on their new sandboxes but again, for every
man there are several women conducting and setting up business.
	Ireland experienced something similar when it took in
400 of the Vietnamese boat people. Although they had no money
they came from a middle class background. In a country where
unemployment hits 21% in areas after five years not a single
one was not working. Most in businesses they had created
themselves
	If Imperials are reluctant to buy into the new Aslan trade
opportunities the recent settlers certainly will. And again,
many of the have settled quite peaceably and probably have
full citizen rights which enables them to act as a local agent
for the entrapenurial Aslan.
	The Imperium is unlikely to get too protectionist about
the trade either. With echoes of the rebellion bouncing around,
the markets are bound to be bouncy and domestic Imperial
investors cautious. People usually vote with their pockets and
if strong Aslan trade looks to bring chance for prosperity to
an otherwise depressed economy then it becomes a very attractive
option.
	So as Aslan trade influence waxes so too follows legal
and political influence. Generous donations to parties and
co-operation in paying taxes are likely to influence politicians
toward more favourable Aslan laws. More settlers? No problem.
Plenty of Aslan-Imperial cultural exchanges.
	More and more Aslan come. Invaders? No! Settlers! Lots
of nice press photos of local system defence navies welcoming
joint Aslan patrols of their system. With the uncertainties of
the Rebellion echoes doubtless self-defence is high on the mind
of many citizens with the pull back of components of the Imperial
fleet.
	The Alsan settle on previously uninhabited or unused areas
(check your charts, there\'s plenty). How do they support 
themselves? They just have to continue as the women started.
Running the economy. I\'ve just been through Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Singapore on the little (!) business trip. You don\'t need
natural resources to be incredibly prosperous!
	The Hivers may excel in manipulation but you have to
remember: three quarters of the Aslan population (the women)
consider economics and corporate management as the elite profession
of choice. ("What do you want to be when you grow up, little girl?"
"I want to be a corporate investment strategist!")
	The Scout service may have marked Glisten down is being
controlled my the Aslan but it is likely that this would have
been a surprise to Glisten itself!


	The limousine picks up the Aslan husband from the domestic
spaceport and brings him to his house via a long circutorious
route across his new lands. His four wives await him on the veranda.
	He smells and blows bubbles in his tea. "It isn\'t quite
what I expected."
	All the wives look concerned in unison. "Are you displeased
in any way, my lord", asks #3.
	He concentrates, takes a long sip, and then tries to remember
what he was saying. "Well, I just thought there would be lots of
guns and things."
	Wife #1 steps forward. "My lord, I could not have your serenity
disturbed as such. The Imperials are not worthy opponents. We merely
arranged a leveraged takeover of some local interests with clan
capital and ..."
	"Pah", interrupted the husband. "None of this woman\'s talk."
He inhales his tea once again, his eyes surveying the landscape.
All his. "I wonder if there is good hunting..."
	The bird in the nearby cage gurgles.

Okay, this might work (but I ain\'t gonna do it!).  There seems to be much room
for variation here though.  Isn\'t the \'42\' *RS* figure already within two
orders of magnitude of what *TCS* might suggest (~5000 \'capital\' ships)?
I would guess the 42-ship figure itself already has something like a plus
or minus one order of magnitude uncertainty.  This particular course might
lead to nothing more than a flame war over assumptions.

I guess I\'d like to see something along the lines of what you\'ve proposed

Fortunately, Cynthia makes a stab at this in a bit.

Yes, I agreed.  So one course is just to say "A ha!" and congratulate
ourselves on catching GDW with their pants down around their ankles.  
Another, possibly more interesting, course might consider that Norris is
an even more incredible strategic thinker than we\'ve thought and thus
he *conceeded* these regions to the *ihatei* knowing they could be 
assimilated and used later against the Vargr, or Lucan or whatever threat
Deneb (and later the Regency) might face.

Nope, I don\'t think this at all.  (I\'ve read *Art of War* too and I liked
it so much I there\'s a Dolphin mercenary named Sun-Tzu Sharkkiller in my

much of what we accept today about the actual conduct of warfare will
change through seven tech levels even if many of the underlying concepts
are timeless.

Good points all.  As far as I\'m concerned you\'ve made the point that Hans
was suggesting above.  Can we go on now to figure out what a \'typical\'
fleet and squadron in the Regency might look like?  Can we determine what
the total military (navy and army) forces of the Regency are?  This was
my intention way back when.

Yes, yes, I know.  I know the *Imperium* has this access.  What I was
questioning was your apparent claim that somehow we 20th Century Humans
(specifically you) had access to it as well.  I thought you had made this
comment in an effort to justify your claims about the \'reasonableness\'

I kept asking this question because IMHO everyone was just saying we should
ignore the *5FW*/*RS* information merely because it contradicted *TCS*.
Being asked to accept that as a matter of faith was getting a little
tiring.

Here it is again folks: the Great TCS Schism!  :-)  (Please, don\'t flame
me TCS-ites!  I really don\'t care whether there is or isn\'t a
breakdown.  It\'s enough to know there is no clear answer.)

At least we\'ve got a \'fictional\' religious group to insult now!  Curse
those blasted TCS-ites!  May they rot on the *5FW* board map!

But seriously, this has been some good work.  Thanks to everyone who
has contributed.  Maybe we can develop a consistent system:

This is in line with what Les said above.  Can we work out a series of
ship classes here based upon what he calls "real tactical employment"?

I realize this is like talking about evolution to a creationist but when I
played *5FW* there were situations in which naval forces would enter a
system, land ground forces, and then have to face an opposing naval force
that subsequently jumped in system.  In the course of the battle the first
naval force could be forced to withdraw without retrieveing its ground
forces (BTW, this happened to the Sword Worlds at Lanth in the *official*
campaign).  The ground forces left behind had no \'aerospace\' support from
their orbital elements.  If I were the ground commander in such a situation
I\'d have liked to have had some way of dealing with that enemy fleet now
in orbit besides surrendering or hiding in a cave somewhere, thus, I\'d
have landed attached aerospace forces of some sort.  (And this ignores
the fact that should I have managed to defeat that orbital force I might then
need some sort of air or sea lift capability to continue the planetary campaign
if my own naval forces have already jumped out system!)

You\'re forcing me into "apples and oranges" again!  Why would I force the
Imperium to maintain *RS* protocol and then allow the Sword Worlds to
use *TCS*?  That\'s not only unfair, it\'s stupid!  I could have just as
easily used the *RS* methodology for Glisten subsector and come up with
a number for the 214th(?) Fleet that was similarly absurd to you TCS-ites!

>     So let\'s ask another question:  What makes you think *RS* qualifies

Let\'s talk English 101.  *FYI*, when someone places a word in quotation
marks (like I did with \'strategic\' and \'tactical\' *every time I used them*)
it\'s an indication that they are using the word in a non-standard way and that
it\'s meaning is suggested by the context of the text in which it appears.
Thus, I used \'strategic\' and \'tactical\' as easy ways of distiguishing
between the \'big picture\', sector-level focus of *5FW* and *RS* and the
\'little picture\', ship-design focus of *HG* and *TCS*.

BTW, why the need to get so \'acrimonious\'?

>     If you ignore TL, then EVERYTHING you say about the military situation
> in Trav is meaningless drivel...

Again, why the need to get so angry and insulting?  As far as this issue
is concerned, I find it more than a little irritating to have accepted a
point in one discussion for the sake of argument (in this case, Hans\'s
point about the Sword Worlds that tech level differences of one or two 
*aren\'t* that important) only to get *flamed* for it by someone else in
another discussion!  If you\'d been following the discussion on Sword
Worlds technology, Steve, you\'d have known that *I* think differences
of just *one* tech level *are* vitally important.

Let\'s talk Rhetoric 101.  This is what\'s known as a circular argument.

Here\'s some \'reality\' for you.  There were several assault transport 
squadrons in *5FW* and these were exactly how large troop forces were moved
around.

Now, I\'m not still trying to argue *5FW*/*RS* vs. *HG*/*TCS* (I\'ve already
accepted Cynthia\'s and others\' points) but I do hope you\'ll see that
there is no inherent value in calling for one source to be ignored *merely*
because it contradicts other sources!

[Sorry about this heavy quoting folks.  I tried to cut as much as I could

I\'ll try to write it simply.

You say your escort *Pansy* can beat my ten SDBs at Regina.

You say this has nothing to do with the differences between *5FW* and *TCS*.

You admit that my problem is the *number* of my ships rather than their 
  individual capability.

I say:  THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ONLY TEN (10) SDBS AT REGINA IS A *DIRECT*
RESULT OF THE *5FW* RULES!  As we\'ve already seen, if *TCS* rules were
used for Regina there\'d be *a lot* more than just 10 SDBs there!  So,
please quit wasting everyone\'s bandwidth!

And prior to occupying the Border Worlds the Imperial 214th Fleet
destroyed the Sacnoth Fleet at Sting!  (BTW, there are *three* hi-pop
worlds in the SW.  The Gram Fleet was defeated by the Imperial 213th
Fleet and the Narsil Fleet was defeated by the Darrians.)

>     As to "harassing", what harassment could those offer to a battleship?

Uh, suicide run around the \'high guard\' during refueling?  Uh, forcing
some naval elements to remain in system to continue to protect ground
forces from SDB bombardment?  (Unless, of course, the ground forces had
attached aerospace elements.)

If you\'ll recall it was my \'lazy behind experiment\' that came up with
the \'42-ship\' Sword Worlds fleet that started this discussion.  No one
has yet stated that this *5FW*/*RS* focus is inconsistent with itself,
merely that it doesn\'t jive with *HG*/*TCS* and some folks think the
latter makes more sense.

So again, why the need to get angry and insulting?

No, again, if you\'d been paying attention you\'d know that I\'ve accepted
this.  What I\'ve asked is that given this arbitrary decision can we
develop a reasonable rationale to explain it?  This has been a common
endeavor of much of the background discussion we\'ve had here on the TML.

Fine.  So based upon your wondersous experience with *TCS*, what is the
structure of Regency naval forces in TNE?  How many squadrons are there,
what is their composition and deployment?  These are the sorts of ends
this discussion was directed towards.

 Hypothesis:  Because TL10 represents what I call a "catalyst"

 things at TL10, it acts as sort of a "jump start" for later 
 technology.  Consider Earth itself - many millennia at stone, then, 
 a number of centuries at brass, then, a few centuries at iron, 
 then, once steel is discovered, the exponential curve becomes 
 apparent.  Perhaps TL9 is a sort of plateau, the limit of what 
 planetbound tech can achieve.  Then, you have to develop an 
 economical "maneuver" drive to get out to the asteroids, where it 
 becomes possible to discover the principles of jump drive.  Jump, 
 and the associated technologies, act as the next catalyst, and 
 those technologies build on each other, just like solid-state 
 computers built on vacuum-tube computers built on basic tube 
 electronics built on an understanding of electrical theory built 
 on observations of what happens when magnets interact with other 
 things...

Pathetically, I never got to go to Epcot Center.  I was terribly deprived
as a child.  I did get to visit Chester\'s Land of Desert Amusements here
in Tucson, which had fun, hands-on activities like the popular
"Lick the Hantavirus Rodent" exhibit.

In reality, I was using food as an over-simplified example.  What I was
trying to get at was that a perfect closed ecosystem does not exist, and
will not exist at TL15.  The problem might be due to trace elements missing
in food, or an inability to crack sufficient oxygen from ice asteroids in
the Glisten Belt; the cause is basically irrelevant.  The effect is that Glisten
might be militarily powerful, but still be unable to withstand a long-term
siege.  Entropy is just as powerful in  TL15 Glisten as it is in a TL8
Biosphere.   Think of it as punishment for living in a hollowed-out rock
instead of a proper world with an atmosphere.

However, the Aeroponics would be a very good idea for a Glisten type
closed ecology.  It would be far less unpleasant than Algae extracts, and
require less lifting power than a comparable hydroponics plant.   This
would make it more viable for starships as well as orbital habitats and
similar closed environments.   It would also be a nice scenic diversion,
almost a park-like setting for the tunnel and dome dwellers of Glisten. 

 And far more romantic than a walk past the algae vats.

PS - The Gestapo did have more stylish uniforms than the BATF.

None of the above reflects the views of my employers.  We dont have
stylish uniforms either.

Hmm.  Yeah, there\'s no such thing as a perfect closed ecosystem, not even
a planet...there\'s some lossage somewhere.  But if you are implying that
Glisten, as a system, is dependent on, say, oxygen imports because too
much is being lost to outgassing, airlock inefficiencies, and so on, I\'m
not sure I can go along with that.  There\'s just too many people there for
that sort of thing to work, I\'d think.  Besides, how do you besiege an
entire asteroid belt anyway?  I suppose you could hold major population
centers hostage if you were ruthless enough....  I guess that I\'m not 
sure your thesis is self-evident.

Although, come to think of it, Sirius/Dingir was supposed to be like that,
a system with all artificial or "imported" planetoids, moved there for
near-Earth starship traffic purposes, and it had ten million residents.
But that\'s still barely in the reasonable range for such things, I guess,
and the situation there is a lot different that at Glisten, which is a
big natural belt, mining, and industrial center. 

[DGP printed their version of Glisten in TD #15.  While I personally
 didn\'t like some details, like why they thought Glisten was named 
 Glisten, they bring up this issue.  Their call was that Glisten could
 be self-sufficient in a pinch.  Why?  Plenty of agriculture/aeroponics/
 hydroponics.  Actually, I can think of a few benefits to growing crops
 even in a traditional manner under a dome on some asteroidal regolith.]

Are you sure you aren\'t confusing Depot-Deneb with Depot-Corridor?  I
thought Depot-Deneb was about four parsecs behind the lines.  If the
Vargr got that, I think all of Deneb sector would notice!  Besides, it
still had its entire security force, unlike Corridor.

A clan ko worrying about clan investments in research?!  I don\'t want
to call you a tahiwihteakhtau, but no.  His wife will worry about that
stuff -- the ko can and *must* trust the clan\'s females\'s judgement in
all monetary matters.  Most Aslan males don\'t understand "return on
investment" very well, and even if the ko does, he can\'t exhibit such
knowlege in public for fear of self humiliation on a number of levels.

However, females do understand that war is an extension of politics by
other means.  Furthermore, the males do want effective weapons systems
in order to defend the clan and extend the territory.  The males just
don\'t care how much the weapons cost -- it falls to the females to 
explain what the clan can and can\'t afford.  So in that sense you are
correct that the males will have an influence on spending.  The males
know what they need to win a war, the females tell tham what they can
have.  

I\'m also sure that the females long ago discovered that wars are usually
a lot more expensive than they\'re worth.  It\'s just that sometimes, the
code of honor makes warfare unavoidable.  Some wars just need to be
fought.  But the females understand the importance of basic research,
if they\'re any good.  Especially since if they find something new and
make money with it, then the clan can go *buy* land and not have to
fight for it.  This, for some reason, makes the males happy.  Aslan
are not Klingons.  

There\'s some other drains on Aslan productivity, in the industrial
sense.  The Aslan honor artisans and craftsmen, and prefer artistic
things, even battleships.  Also, they dislike using robots.  For both
these reasons, mass-production isn\'t quite the same in the Hierate
as in the old Imperium.  This also means that the Aslan view technology
and scientific studies more as a means to an end rather than an
end in itself; they aren\'t quite inquisitive in the same way as a 
Human or Hiver.  But with Humans and Hivers around, keeping up is a
end in itself.  So is surpassing them!  But one has to be careful of
setting off an arms race with the neighbors.

    'index' => 'am247',
    'topic' => 'REB: Ihatei',
    'body' => 'My take on the Aslan ihatei issue.  First, some background:

Rebellion Sourcebook, page 60:
 "By mid-1117, it was clear to the Aikoho Earleatrais that the Imperium
was being torn apart.  At that time, an ihatei fleet which had
originated in Ealiyasiyw sector entered Trojan Reach in search of new
worlds; it was redirected to Imperial territory and was successful
in establishing a settlement within the Imperial border."

 And so on.

 Norris, faced with too many problems, delegated a Fleet Admiral to
"eliminate any threat to the Domain" that the Aslan caused.  To use
an infamous line, "when you have a hammer, all your problems start
to look like nails."  The Admiral had a fleet behind him.  By 1119,
he was applying this "hammer" to every Aslan nail he could catch,
not bothering to check his definition of "Threat to the Domain"
with Norris.
 In short, it didn\'t work.  By 1120, the Aslan had reached the region
so marked in the Player\'s Handbook and Imperial Encyclopedia.
  One thing to remember is that the map in the PH is a _snapshot_ of
the sector as of 001-1120.  Another thing to remember is the definition
of the Imperium\'s border: within this line, the Imperial Navy
_controls_the_space_lanes_.  As far as our hapless Admiral and the
Scout Service were concerned the Aslan controlled that space, because
the Navy certainly didn\'t.
  Barring a few violent incidents (the ones we all read about in the
TNS), the Aslan settled in where ever they found room to do so, and
promptly became reasonably good neighbors.  The majority of the
perceived threat vanished.  This didn\'t save the Duchess (?) of Egryn,
unfortunately.
  Why can I make the assumption of fading menace?  Because by late 1123
Norris feels comfortable enough with his rimward neighbors to send
the Arrival Vengeance in that direction with a reasonably good
chance of the ships\' getting to Daibei.
  The map of the Vengeance\'s path also notes Frontier, Outlands and
Wilds.  The Frontier designation runs along the Imperial border all
the way up to Vilis subsector.  Based on this, the Sword Worlds and
possibly the Darrians are also having ihatei problems in the 1120s.

  From Arrival Vengeance, page 7:
  "Norris has used both naval force and diplomacy to attempt to
contain the Aslan ihatei. In its current role, Vengeance is primarily
concerned with the latter..."

  It is apparent that Norris has, by this time, realized the nature
of the "invasion".  While he can\'t stop the Aslan advance completely,
he is trying to direct it.  Flareups between land-hungry Aslan and
"dammit, I live here!" Imperials contribute to the Frontier rating.
Much of Glisten subsector is actually classified as Wilds, but I
suspect that this is due to the earlier violence more than
current threat.

  While we don\'t have any data on the next seven years, I can guess
the general trend.  An uneasy state continues between the incoming
Aslan and the Domain, very gradually improving, but with bad spots
and regressions fairly common.  On the other side of the Domain, the
Vargr are slowly running out of steam.  Norris looks forward to many
years of juggling the two groups with some dismay.  Then comes
the Arrival Vengeance, home at last; the "Regency Address" in 1127;
and, in 1130, word of the Virus.
  The moment the reality of Virus set in, the possibility of shifting
borders was gone.  Norris knew it, the Aslan knew it, and the Vargr
learned it the hard way.  The Zhodani had given up on shifting borders
over a thousand years ago.  The region behind the Claw became static,
border-wise, unless you were a very long way from the Quarantine
Zone.
   The Aslan probably returned to spreading along the edge of
the Great Rift, as well as boosting the manpower of the Regency.  The
spread of the ihatei is more slow and deliberate, and never violent,
because they don\'t dare fight each other with the Virus looking over
their shoulder.

of rules. Ah, the nostalgia of looking through the 3-booklet set once 
again ...

Anyway, comparing the number of engineers you need depending on which 
set of rules you use isn\'t easy. CT and Highguard use x engineers per 
displacement ton, MT uses some benighted formula using control points 
and FFS uses a figure based on peak power output. Trying to reduce this 
morass to a nice figure per tonnes mass or power output gets a little 
bizarre because of the MT formula. As a first cut, here are the 
engineering crew requirements for the "standard" starships as specified 
in CT, TB (the Traveller Book), MT and FFS.

Ship            CT  TB  MT  FFS
Type S scout    0   0.5 0.5 2(0)
Type A trader   1   1   1   4(2)
Type R merchant 1   1   2   5(3)
Type Y yacht    1   1   1   5(3)
Type C cruiser  4   4   3   5(3)
Type M merchant 3       2   7(5)
Type T cruiser      3   2   7(5)
Type L lab ship     2   1   3(1)
Type K safari       1   1

FFS figures in brackets are the number of non-manoeuvre crew required. 
It looks like engineering crew requirements have doubled in FFS.

I\'ll be producing figures on engineers required per tonne of drive and 
per MW produced as soon as I can get them to make sense ;-)

differences, follow.
	Could  it  be that the ship crews in  TNE  represent  the
fact  that  crewbeings can only do a 8 to 12 hour shift  on  duty
without fatige becoming a problem?
	Anouther  thing i noticed whilst comparing the  differnce
is  that the bigger the ship the larger the crew gap  is ,  after
discusionb  with  M Archer we propose that it may be due  to  the
difference  in  powerplant sizes, as the TNE plants  seem  to  be
bigger,  so  a scout ship gains 1 person and a cruser gains  (  i
think  sorry my memory fails here) 8 or 10 crew coupled with  the
above point this would seem resonable.

On  a differnt track onece i get confermation of the gun stats  i
posted  on the 31may/ 1 june ( again memory lapse) apper  i  vill
start  posting  the rest, Thank you to all who have droped  me  a

New topic; What does the prosperous imperial citizen own that she/he 
would find indispensible in conducting everyday life?

Identicard:  The ATM/Credit Card gone wild.  This thing opens doors, gets
cash, debits your bank account for purchases, has your complete medical
history (yeah I know, I got that from an AT&T commercial), will get you
access from any computer terminal to your private records, identifies
you indisputably.  Less costly models have fingerprint scanner circuitry
built into the surface, more expensive ones use a chemical reaction which
is carefully tuned to identify your distinctive body chemistry.  The real 
cheap ones require a four to 10 digit security password.  Some terminals 
can accept voice ID or scan your retina, with the comparison data stored on 
the card itself.  Almost every security measure can be defeated, of course, 
but mostly they\'re pretty good.

Personal Electronic Manager:  Technology and fashion go hand in hand.  
If you doubt
this I ask you to take a walk into your nearest Sharper Image store, or go
to a high priced business lunch place downtown and look for young men with
their cellular phones out making high-profile calls.  In the imperial future
of tech fashion remember this; less is more.  Implanted microphone and 
speakers go into the jawbones of most every megacorp exec in the business.
along with this is the implant computer (doesn\'t matter where...inside a
titanium femur perhaps?).  This thing acts as Personal information manager 
extrodinaire, optimizes the comm signal with your multiplexer (actually the
only external component is a signal booster/receiver/antenna.  Some have an
antenna replacing part of their anatomy-the titanium femur again?), networks
with local information resources, monitoring market information, location/
condition of competitors or allies in business, etc.
	One limit to the implanted tech at TL15 I impose is in vision
systems.  At TL15 people wear eyeglasses, not for vision correction, but
as binocular holographic projection medium (identical to the holographic
eyepiece which originally appeared in Grand Survey or Grand Census-but
with two eyepieces).  Even TL15 doctors don\'t try to screw with optic nerves 
much.
	So everyone who\'s anyone is connected in the most personal sense
and can "hook in" to the \'net instantly, easily, seamlessly, and does so
as though it were second nature.  Those who are truly successful have only
the eyeglasses to betray their hook-ups, while the less fortunate have
pickups on their throat and sticky speakers behind their ears ("commdots").
	This connection is stilll quite expensive (from a personal financial
standpoint) I imagine it\'s about like having a computer today-lots of people
have them, but not everyone can afford them, and in general those who have
them have a specific use in mind.   On the other hand, the corporate world 
would provide them to all their execs.

Stylish Grav Vehicle:  Be it a Harley reproduced grav skimmer, or a Porche
2911 Hovercar, The Yuppie of the future\'s grav vehicle is a sign of her or
his status in society.  Most vehicles in my campaign used in an urban setting 
are "skimmers", capable of flight and wheeled travel.  For a long time one
character\'s most prized possesion was a Porche reproduction in Grav form
with retracting wheels (Modelled after the 944), Gull wing doors, and a 
vastly overpowered thrust system (btw, I considered a Porche body an airframe
for velocity purposes-is there any accuracy to that?). fun fun fun.
	Note that the individual\'s computer/display system integrates with 
the on-board computer of similar tech vehicles she/he is driving to provide
all the display information through the display headset the person is wearing.
This also prevents untimely phone calls while driving in traffic from taking 
over the display.
	I don\'t buy central traffic control systems "taking over" grav vehicles
either.  I think this would only happen in trans-continental or high-altitude 
ballistic trips (where adjustments are minimal in any case).  For local travel
the individual is expected to keep within established travel lanes both on the 
graound and in the air.

Ok, I\'ve blathered enough.  Remember I\'m talking about high tech, large pop
worlds with relatively free-type governments.  The picture changes quite a
bit with oppressive gov\'ts, with TL down around 11 or so, etc.

P.S.  To my knowledge this is the first post to both the TML and the XTML.  It
seemed appropriate-is it?

The more I think about it, the more I dread the proliferation of
categories.  Categories that are too specific will tend to cause
confusion and/or threads which expand and contract into different
categories (seeing half a thread, especially alternating messages,
can be annoying).

Perhaps you should go back to a much simpler list, at least for
the non-general stuff:

CT	Classic Traveller, includes HG, TCS, IMP
MT	MegaTraveller, includes REB
TNE	The New Era, includes NE, FFS
FICT	Fiction, includes AHIS
SCEN	Scenarios/Patrons/etc.
CAT	Computer Aids
DES	Designs, includes VDES, WDES(weapons), CDES, WDES(worlds)

SALE	For Sale/Trade/Wanted
FLAME	Flames (to /dev/null?)
GEN	General, includes MISC (see below)
ADM	Administrivia (see below)
ANN	Announcements (see below)

To make it idiot-proof, I would suggest allowing several aliases for
some categories.  For example, MISC should be an allowable alias for
GEN.

You probably don\'t want to allow people to unsubscribe to the ADM or
ANN categories.  If you wish, you can limit posting access to them
(or you can trust us--it may be useful to be able to post things to
the entire TML on occassion).  My interpretation of ADM/ANN is that
they should not carry threads (GEN would be used for that, or add a
TML thread for TML meta-discussions if you wish).

You will want to print the entire category list on every TML mailing
you send.  If the list is short, this shouldn\'t be a problem.  If it
is long, then the list is needed that much more.  Consider that when
designing the list.  With my list, the categories are obvious enough
that you can do it easily in one line (no need to show ADM/ANN):

TML Categories: CT, MT, TNE, FICT, SCEN, CAT, DES, SALE, FLAME, GEN

I really like the idea of allowing cross-posts by simply listing
multiple categories (eg: "CT/MT:" or "CT, MT:"), although I think
the TML digester will be a nightmare of a program.  Once again, to
make it idiot-proof you will want to allow several ways to list
multiple categories.  I would suggest converting any combination of
spaces, tabs, "and", "or", or non-colon punctuation into category
separators.

And one more thing to make the TML digester a REAL nightmare:

What some people will REALLY want is the opportunity to explicitly
EXCLUDE messages that are cross-posted to particular groups.  For
example, I might want all messages in the CT and MT categories that
are NOT also in TNE, or I might want to specifically exclude SALE
or FLAME messages, even if they are cross-posted.

And on a relatively related note:

I remember reading something about a TML World-Wide-Web site.
Could someone give me the address?  We just got Mosaic up here and
I\'d like to try it out.

Nice!  That was well thought out.  A sort of James Burke/Connections
view of Traveller TL.  For those poor souls who didn\'t understand that
reference, there was a late 1970s series from the BBC called Connections,
hosted by James Burke.  James would wear these amazing 1970s 
polyester suits and talk about how completely unrelated inventions and
events would act together to move the course of technology.  I think
it is now on The Learning Channel on cable - well worth a watch.

I have noticed there is another sort of plateau at TL13-15.  When you get
to TL13, you have made lots of major advances in various areas of
technology, but when you go from TL13 to TL14 and then onward to
TL15, the major effect seems to be a reduction in size.  At TL15, a few
new technologies appear, but are usually prohibitively large or
expensive.  TL15 seems to be the end of this plateau, and new technology
starts coming up more frequently at TL16.  I am basically looking at
starship and weapons technology for this statement (I am a bit
bloody-minded).  One question - does reaching such a TL Jump Start
add enough social stress to a society to make a Rebellion more likely?  Is
this a contributing factor to the Rebellion?

Re: David Johnson\'s TCS vs 5FW

If it comes to a choice between TCS fleet sizes vs 5FW fleet sizes, I would
have to pick the economy-jumbo-sized TCS fleets.  Not for any reason
of playability or historical realism, but mostly because I have too many
middle and high-ranking Imperial Navy PCs and NPCs in my campaign
to have anything less than several thousand warships in each sector.

Maybe the IN just has a high turnover rate.  Right-sizing strikes the 
Imperium.

In all seriousness, I do prefer the TCS numbers over the 5FW numbers,
if I am running a TCS-oriented campaign.  If not, I dont care too much,
but for consistency I use the TCS numbers anyway.  There is nothing
wrong with 5FW or RS, other than the fact that I had TCS first, and so
that was what I used.  Basically, if you like big fleets, you like TCS.  If
you like small fleets, you like 5FW/RS.  If you are happy either way, you
use whatever you first got access to.

I certainly dont see why suggesting 5FW force levels would generate
so much dismay.  Maybe there are some TML members who are major
stockholders in naval ship construction firms.  I thought your ideas were 
interesting, even if I don\'t use those figures myself.

scharlto@avalon.com

This does not reflect the views of my employers.  They own no naval
construction stock, and so do not care about fleet sizes.

 Oops!  Look in the DESIGN SIGS column (also, try to keep to 72 or 
 less...).  You are using the same code for two different "lists" - 
 WDES for both weapons and worlds.  I\'d recommend dropping the DES 
 from all of the DESIGN SIGS entries, and go with VEH for Vehicle 
 Design, WEAP for Weapons Design, CHAR or N/PC for Character 
 Design, WRLD for World Design, and the current CAT for Computer 
 stuff.  As far as using them in both TML and XTML, I think this is 
 a good idea, and should eventually allow the remerging of the 
 lists.  At least initially, it might also not be a bad idea to 
 treat messages that come through with no code at all as though 
 they had GEN.  A really sophisticated system would be able to 
 accommodate a reference to another message, in several formats 
 (like the one I use), and be able to automatically prepend the 
 appropriate subject codes.  Don\'t try to get into this, though, 
 unless you have LOTS of time on your hands.

 Question:  How flexible are we on this?  Your example shows 
 prepending, but your text specifies only "embedded".  Would a 
 format such as "1:8/25 [FFS, NE]: How do I design a foobar" be 
 acceptable?  What about "1:8/25: GEN: Converting Quuxes from 
 GREPS"?  Or "Bazzleberries stink! \\FLAME\\"?  All of these meet the 
 qualification of embeddedness with separation from the rest by 
 non-alphanumerics, but they\'re all quite different.  Certainly, a 
 program that uses regular expression parsing (a la *ix grep) could 
 handle any or all of the above, but I have no idea of what you\'re 
 using at e.u.c.  Thus, the question...

The TNE 400 Ton SDB has a volume of 5600 m^3, and a laden mass of 4886.17
tonnes, for a specific gravity at 1G of .86.  It Floats!  (Dorsal surface
probably awash, but she is NOT going under.)

Now, I have not seen anything in the rules for using Contra-Grav for making 
things heavier, so the base design is probably not going under water.

Clearly, any SDB designed to submerge must either be designed for it (ballast
tanks, probably some sort of prop. thrusters) or be locally modified (put
that crate of lead in stateroom three, and strap it down good!)  

Just a thought, maybe a nasty to pull on some players who havn\'t thought 
things though.

confess that I like the TNE rules, except for a few minor quirks that I
steamroll over with some house rules :)

A modern tanker today barely got 2 dozen crew members, and often less. A
200 ton craft needs somewhere between 5 to 9 crewmembers depending on TL
and design. Far too many, especially when the craft is intended to be
used for players. And not all players like to have starship skills
either. Thus extra hands have to be hired, which means less space for
cargo and fuel when the accommodations has to be made for the extra
personell.

One other thing that eat up space is the powerplant. Where did the size
modifier go? I think someone asked this before. If GDW read this list,
I\'ld appreciate an answer on these questions.

[engineer comparison table deleted]
>It looks like engineering crew requirements have doubled in FFS.

It\'s actually worse, and might be worst of all at lower tech
levels, depending on how the computer multiplier comparisons
work between MT and TNE.  In TNE you have "Engineers" who are
calculated based on the power produced by your power plant and
your computer multiplier.  You also get "Maintanance" crew 
that are calculated based on, among other things, drive tonnage.
So the whole question is complicated by differing definitions
of what an engineer is.  I suspect that the maintenance crew
requirements have also risen, but I don\'t have FFS with me right
now.

One of the effects this new rule has is that high-tech power 
stations will have computers built in to reduce the number of
engineers required to run them.  Otherwise, your 5000 MW tech-17
antimatter plant requires the same number of engineers to run
as your 5000 MW tech-5 steam boiler.

Incidentally, one of the things that is good about FFS is that
they\'ve dropped those awful control point calculations from the
rules.  One thing I find annoying, however, is the inconsistency
of units for calculations.  Sometimes the rules call for cubic
meters, sometimes kiloliters (which are the same thing) and 
sometimes for displacement-tons, for instance.  You have to stay
pretty alert to avoid making stupid errors.

                   Rachland Notes           
                     PC Notes   

         The PCs are dispatched to the unusual world of Rach to
investigate the disappearances of a couple AAROVs(Automated
Agricultural Remotely Operated Vehicle) as well as the loss of
contact with a Maintenance Team.  A couple of local authorities
who went out to investigate found mauled bodies.  They looked
like something mean and sharp had been at work.  The mission is
to launch an investigation first into the disappearances of the
AAROVs as well as a side investigation regarding the Maintenance
team.  The local office chief is really leaning hard on Amura to
get to the bottom of this.  Amura will stress that If they cannot
make progress on a timely basis, HQ will probably be called in. 
The agri facility is very important to Piedmont(Nearby City) so
the PCs can expect good cooperation from the local authorities.   

                    Background  

Unique factors such as atmospheric and soil composition in many
low lying areas of Rach create ideal environmental for certain
crops that do extremely well.  Rach in fact produces a large
yearly surplus of food that is a major source of export income. 
The problem lies in the fact that the air near sea level is very
dense. (About 2 atm) and the Sea and ground at these altitudes
are racked by extremely severe Storms.  Winds of 200km are not
uncommon and constant rain is a fact of life.  Humans generally
find this very uncomfortable and so a great deal of effort has
been put into automating agriculture.  This is where NSC comes
in.  They perfected an automated agriculture system that included
ROVs but also a way of shielding the crops from some of the more
vicious storms.  Sort of a grav repeller.  Only the whitecoats
are sure about how it works.  This combined with extremely hardy
crop types has led to a great deal of success for NSC on Rach.    

                      Mission Details  

Travel to Rach aboard available transport whether that be NSC
charter, NSC owned and operated or Commercial with equipment. 
Depending upon means of travel make way to Piedmont and make
contact with local coordinator Joel Ghiel, who will arrange
accommodations and transport intracity and to the facility.  Do
not discuss the investigation with individuals not assigned to or
included in this investigation.  You are to familiarize yourself
with NSC operations and the local authorities and then proceed to
the Piedmont Edge Agricultural Facility by Grav Shuttle to
continue your investigation.  The On scene Crew Chief (Lathan
Devers) will fill you in on the details and provide what
assistance he can.  You will board at the facility as needed.  We
hope that you will be able to put one of our most successful
projects to date back on its best footing for the Company, and
for the People of Rach.  After your successful completion of the
investigation contact Joel Ghiel for further information and make
way to HQ on Arizona Dawn for debriefing and some well earned
reward.
               Referee Only   

The situation on Rach is somewhat complicated but here is an
effort to illuminate it.  The recently chartered Unified
Planetary Sphere is actively expnding outwards.  It is an effort
to consolidate the worlds of the immediate region.  Many would be
members support this but others do not, especially those who are
liable to lose power by having an extraworld authority to answer
to.  In fact they are willing to go to considerable lengths to
prevent UPS consolidation.  NSC being a UPS chartered corporation
and Based on Arizona Dawn, one of the two core planets has become
a side target for an organization known as the Free Indigenous
Rachland Solidarity TaskForce or FIRST.  It is mostly a
legitimate political organization but members have resorted to
illegal and extreme activities.

differently (very differently).  Note that in my subsector the VIRUS 
exsisted but not nearly to the degree in the official GDW script.  It 
contributed to technological decline but nearly so much as the rebellion 
itself.  It has been more or less eradicated except for a node here and 
there.

                    ADVENTURE START ON PRIMA
D: PC                                  
                         BACKGROUND

Slogans and Posters cover the walls and fill the public viewing
screens encouraging individuals to join the reunification effort. 
To join the destiny of the people to establish empire in this
region of space and mayhaps over the whole of what was known as
the third Imperium.  A speaker exhorts, "Surely the ability of
\'The people\' to resist the ravages of the Rebellion and to rise
above the chaos of our times so swiftly is a sign that they are
destined to do this thing.  Now the time is right for the push. 
Those who yet manage to hold on will soon be relieved and those
who have fallen will soon be rescued.  \'The people\' on the edge
of the great rift are of the right stuff for this task.  Every
individual should feel the manifest destiny of the tasks which
lay before us.  And every individual should wish to be a part of
this bold effort."
        
       Incessant propaganda covers visi boards and is posted on
streetside sign columns.  A giant VisiBoard can be seen for many
blocks with the face of the Technology minister giving a speech
on the virtues of Trade and exchange Protocol for all civilians. 
This switches to a speech by Admiral Iruban with slides of Some
Ships of the Unification Fleet.  Today the fleet officially sets
out on its initial excursion (Lead elements have been out for
years) and Great Fanfare surrounds the event.  A parade of
Marines and Sailors makes it way down the street.  Music plays
and an assembly is planned at the Starport.        UP workers
press Literature into the hands of the Passerby and PC alike and
wax on the Virtues of the Party and the PC\'s usefulness to it.
(If the PC has expressed anti expansion/unification sentiments
then UP agents will watch them casually).  Security troops
surround vital communications points as well as near the
Starport. (Terrorist threats).  Further from the Fanfare Lobbyist
and Demonstrators for the Nemon Nation\'s League will plead for
the besieged nation.  (If they get too vocal Security may break
this up.)

                         Nemon Recruiter 
Away from the Parades the scene is slightly more subdued.  A
Skilled recruiter from the NNL will approach a PC to ask for help
in forming a cadre to take to Aurigae.  He will offer decent pay
but nothing great.  He will brief the PC on the situation in an
effort to recruit him.  Every PC should be approached as the
recruiting effort has some size to it.  However Union Intel is
aware of these efforts and has agents attempting to curb the
efforts of the NNL subtly.  PC\'s may get caught up in this.  The
recruiters will try and set up a meeting.
 

                        Amura of NSC   
Amura of NSC is trying to contact some of them for a team she is
setting up.  The Corporate Action Team as she calls it.  (Due to
the uncertain nature of frontier and outsystem operations she
felt a technically trained sort of strike/investigative team
would be needed,  NeoGov OK\'d it on a trial basis)  It is her
idea and her project so she has a very keen interest in seeing it
work.  Sometime before the PC\'s meet the recruiters she will set
up a meet with one or two of them for 10 days in the future,
specifically on day 11.  She encourages them to bring any
individual who the PC\'s think are qualified.  She is prepared to
offer 2KCR((+Skl-4)x250) every 30days plus bonuses.


                      The Nemon Meeting 
The PC\'s will go to the arranged meeting spot and either the
recruiters will be killed by Union agents who have been tailing
the PC\'s or be dead when they get there with a note warning them
not to work with the "insurgents".  If they have tailed the PC\'s
they will kill the Nemons in such a way as to not be found(Poison
Darts most likely) but will get buck if necessary, they will
avoid attacking the PC\'s and will run if it comes to that.  They
have a TL 9 Roadster nearby to make their escape. 

                          What Now?
With one possible Patron dead It will be up to those in the know
to tell the others about the meeting with Amura.  Until then the
PC\'s are free to do as they like.       This may include going to
Tinan to spend some money(Weapons) or Staying in Neo for the same
purpose(Vehicles).  (The price is right!)

They might choose to investigate the Murder of the Nemons.  Maybe
some local contacts will have the answers.  An extended
investigation may even reveal the culprits before they try to
kill the PC\'s.  If so they will try to leave the planet on a
jumpliner to Aurigae.     (Page on this-Who killed the Nemons?)

Investigate other Employment Opportunities.  Many postings for
Ships Troops as well as Trader crews.  A lot of ads extol the
virtues of establishing civilization on some rebellion wasted
balls.  Land Grants are being offered by the "Governments" of
these worlds.  Join the Unification Colonization Corps!  Some of
these might be worth further investigation. (Paragraph on each) 
(Job Opps for Bored PC\'s)
 

                            The Meeting with Amura of NSC

The PC\'s will be asked to come to regional HQ on Neo for the
meeting.  It is only 100 km from the City and less than 20
minutes by train.(The Old Line a new grav line is building.  It
is rumored that it will be a 1000kph train with Inertial Comp and
Everything stations will be about 150km apart)  They can drive if
they have a car and a permit.  The train station is about 10km
from the complex and an aide will be waiting with a Limobus to
pick them up.  (And possibly Union Agents if they have been
overly careless).  (Mostly propa on the Radio) There is only one
small tower (10 floors+4 underground) and several 3 level
assembly buildings.  The Limo will enter an underground driveway
about 0.5 Km long to a parking deck.  Amura will meet them their
with another aide.
                                     Orientation
They wont get much of a tour of the facility but there will be a
breakfast and some orientation session/interview(2 hours).  A
general exam will be given (1 hour) and then break for lunch. 
Afterwards aides will detail the training schedule.  Company
hiranks will come by and sit down for a while every now and then. 
It they still wish to continue they will be asked to complete
some paperwork and receive some materials among them a temp ID
badge.  There is no commitment until the 22nd day of training. 
Those who sign up will be given pagers and an assembly date of
17-1201
                                          
                                Post Orientation

After this there is a dinner and networking gathering.  Amura
will be shooting her bow at targets and will invite competition. 
A couple of target pistols are available.  They will be driven
back to the train station for the ride home.  They can do as they
choose for now.  See side adventures.  Near the end of this
period one of the PC\'s will be contacted regarding a possible
inheritance and that he should get in contact with someone.  This
is an important but not urgent matter.  The PC\'s should use this
time to resolve anything that can be wrapped up but try to stay
out of trouble.  NSC does not want convicted criminals.  

                                      Ship Out
A couple of days before their contact day they are told to go to
Starport B to meet a Charter Jumpliner to Tinan.  Their temp ID\'s
will serve as Boarding passes.  The passengers are all would be
trainees(About 40).  Amura and a couple of aides are also aboard. 
It is a Jump-1 trip to Tinan.  Anything that happens aboard the
ship will either be the PC\'s own doing or High Strung trainees.


                                    Arrival Tinan
They should go by the high port to show it to the PC\'s "You\'ll be
doing a good part of your training there" but the ship will land
at the complex.  they will be barracked in double occupancy
rooms(comfortable) and given uniform sets.  For the first 21 days
they can leave the complex on off days or on evenings.(Nearby
town of 40 000)  If they get in trouble this may be limited.

		NSC Training and Skill Development

Skill represents the skill gained.  Difficulty is the level of
the Test required to gain the skill or an additional level if a
character already possesses it.  If an outstanding success is
rolled then the character receives and additional level.  The
attribute/asset list show what attributes or assets are
applicable.  In rolling a player may choose to test the average

ARMOR RATINGS and the IMPERIAL NAVY SHIP-OF-THE-LINE

I just gained enlightenment on another shift in the rules which
should interest battle fleet naval architects.  This one is related
to starship armor factors on very large ships.

In _Brilliant Lances_, there is a design for a 1000-ton TL15 
Imperial Navy DE, the _Chrysanthemum_-class.  It is a close structure
with armor factor 62, which comes out to 2.214 cm of bonded super-
dense armor at a volume cost of about 0.62 % of the ship.  I decided
to scale this percentage for a 500000 d-ton sphere, to see what sort
of armor we might expect to see on a _Tigress_-size battleship.
(It\'s not quite fair, since the DE loses some mass to configuration,
but that isn\'t really vital for this argument.)

It turns out that at 0.62 % of ship volume, the _Tigress_-size ship
can carry some 25.087 cm of bonded superdense armor, for an armor
rating of 702.  This is 2.25x the amount of armor needed to stop a
standard TL15 150MJ beam laser dead.

If one is willing to armor an expensive battleship a little better 
than a DE, at 1.77 % of ship volume you can have 71.5 cm of bonded
superdense armor plating, and an armor rating of 2002.  This is just
sufficient to stop a TL15 500 kT nuclear detonation x-ray laser dead.

Note that either value is sufficient to stop any of the "pea-shooter"
class PAWS in _Brilliant Lances_.

These armor ratings are very definitely not ridiculous.  If anything,
they may turn out to be conservative.

It looks to me like the lighter weapons are really only useful for 
anti-missile fire or to try and scrub the communications and sensory
antennae off a ship.  The only other thing I can think of doing with
them is to try to saturate a big ship\'s anti-missile defenses and get
a fusion weapon right up next to it.  So I suppose the *really* big 
ships like the _Tigress_-types will depend more on what we\'d currently
consider very heavy weapons to do any real damage to the enemy line.
I have no idea what sort of power the TNE equivalent to the meson-T
delivers on target, but it is probably massive.  The big ships will
need to depend on heavy bays to back up the main gun, though, since
the turrets and "pea-shooter" spinal mounts on escorts won\'t do much 
good.  I\'m not sure if the 100-ton bays can cut it; I haven\'t checked.

As for the _Chrysanthemum_ in a fleet action, well, I guess it really
is a cheap "tin can".  I suppose it\'s supposed to be an SDB hunter
and commerce cutter.

re. gsw@aloft.att.com (gerald.s.williams)\'s discussion of categories:

I agree entirely with Gerald\'s dread of category proliferation and feel
that his reduced category set is well thought out with the exception of
alternate histories.  Possibly AHIS could be placed under scenarios or
may maintain its own category.  Perhaps a test drive (or compilation of
categories in which messages currently posted would fall might be
enlightening.  As long as there are not many AHIS posts to interfere
with those interested only in fiction (or scenarios) or vice-versa it
could be combined otherwise a separate category may be a necessity.

This is a good analysis.  To tell you the truth, I like the feel of being
able to armour my dreadnaughts in proper Fisher fashion.

As for tactics, would you not want to (1) engage with (relatively) light
armourment to detroy the antennas for the meson screen (I am under the
impression that cust out the meson defence) then (2) engange with the meson
armed big ships.

I have been thinking of some lighter meson armed ship ideas as well, but that
needs some development.

Thats fine.  If there is no magic "torpedo" for frying big ships, torpedo
boats do not serve a lot of purpose.

It\'s a different secret than the official one for several reasons; one, that
I don\'t like the whole Grandfather business at all, and, two, that even if I
did like it most of my players know it too, and that tends to ruin their
sense of wonder. And IMO the secret of The Ancients ought to be full of
wonder.

I have, however, tried to make my version fit all the clues left behind. My
Ancients left the universe in much the same state than the GDW Ancients did,
they just went about it differently. So some of he things I work out should
be useful even to those who want to stick with Grandfather and the kids.

At the moment I\'m trying to work out how an Ancient set of coyns looks. We 
know the names of the coyns in the set of 36 used by modern Droyne, and 
we\'ve been told what some of them looks like. The Ancient set consisted of
38 coyns and some of the odern coyns (Aslan, Hiver, K\'kree) cannot be part 
of the set.

I\'ve listed the facts I\'ve used (numbered) and the assumptions I\'ve made
(lettered). If anyone can come up with facts I have missed or have some 
good ideas, please let me know.

1) Coyn sets found in Ancient sites range in size from 6 to 38 pieces.
   [_Imperial Encyclopedia_ p. 21].

a) The lesser sets found are subset of one standard 38-coyn set, not 
   alternate sets.

b) The Ancient coyn set is identical to a pre-Ancient coyn set used by 
   pre-Ancient Droyne in prediction ceremonies.

2) Grandfather introduced the coyns as a tool of casting to a number of
   Chirper worlds around -75,000. [_Droyne_ pp. 6 and 45]. On some worlds
   the Chirpers gained the ability to caste, on others it didn\'t work
   (Vanejen, described in _Research Station Gamma_, is an example of the
   latter).

3) Grandfather modified the coyns on later visits and introduced the Aslan,
   Hiver and K\'kree coyns (at least). [_Secret of The Ancients_ p 32].

b) The Ancient coyn set consisted of six groups of six plus two specials.
   The six castes was one group. Void, Soil, Air, Gas, Water, and Fire was
   aother (these were the Droyne concept of elements: Earth (Soil), Water,
   Fire, Good (breahable) Air (Air), Bad (unbreathable) Air (Gas), and the
   absence of any of the other five (Void). 18 of the other coyns mentioned
   in the modern set were also in the Ancient set, though any grouping of 
   them into sixes lacks common themes (the third group, Darkness, Cold,
   Noise, Signal, Heat, and Light are pairs of opposites  -  but so are
   Genesis & Death and Defeat & Achievement from another of the groups).
   Anyway, the abovementioned plus Aspiration, Sacrifice, Beast, Mercenary,
   Voyages, Justice, Change, and Phoenix (can\'t really be a phoenix, of
   course; it must be a legendary Droyne beast with the same characteristics 
   as the phoenix) were also part of the Ancient set. Humaniti, Vargr, 
   Aslan, Hiver, and K\'kree was not. Remains the Droyne, which was one of
   the two special coyns. The remaining special coyn disappeared from the
   set when Grandfather re-introduced it, presumably because it was no
   longer relevant to the new Droyne. I suggest Eskaloyt, the Droyne
   homeworld itself. We now have 30+2 coyns. We lack one group of six, all
   of them coyns that were subsequently removed. One solution supplies not
   only a group with a common theme, but also the explanation of why they
   became redundant: Six prey animals native to Eskaloyt. Used by primitive
   Droyne to perform hunt magic.

So I suggest that the Ancient coyn set consisted of:

Worker	   Warrior	Drone	    Technician	 Sport	  Leader
Void	   Soil		Air	    Gas		 Water	  Fire
Darkness   Cold		Noise	    Signal	 Heat	  Light
Genesis	   Aspiration	Sacrifice   Defeat	 Death	  Achievement
Beast	   Mercenary	Voyages	    Justice	 Chance	  Phoenix
Hissayt	   Emissyob	Ayvaylk	    Bestoy	 Nebbay	  Hayyarn
Droyne	   Eskaloyt

But I can\'t just hand a list like that to my players. I\'d much rather give
them a description of what the coyns look like. And that\'s where I need some
help. I\'ve come up wih a description of most of the coyns. Some I like, some
I\'m not thrilled about, and some I downright dislike, but can\'t come up with
a good alternative to. So if you think of something you think is better, let
me know.

c) The modern coyns that duplicates Ancient coyns duplicates their design 
   too.

4) The first Grandfather set (in -75,000) consisted of 38 coyns and included
   one with a human and one with a flame [RSG pp. 4 and 38].

d) The set of six fake coyns menioned on page 13 of _Twilight\'s Peak_ are
   copies of real coyns (albeit modern coyns); they depict an aslan leader,
   a flame, a human, a cloud, an ice crystal, and a sine wave.

e) The depictions of the six castes on page 64 of TP and pp. 12-13 of
   _Droyne_ are taken from the coyn depictions of those castes.

f) The coyn shown on the back of _Droyne_ (two flames and the lower third
   is obsured by a droyne) is not a variant of the coyn wih the single
   flame.

Now to match coyns to descriptions. The first six are easy, thanks to
assumption e):

A massive droyne with digging tools	Worker
A tall droyne with sword and shield	Warrior
A flying droyne with a bottle[1]	Drone		
A medium droyne with tools and detector	Technician
A slender droyne with ball and bat[2]	Sport
A big-headed droyne with a spear[3]	Leader

[1] A feeding bottle, perhaps?
[2] My best guess. It looks like a giant spoon and an irregular disc. I
    suggest that it\'s for _feldoss_, a popular droyne game that I just
    made up ;-) 
[3] A ceremonial spear, of course. See later.

The rest are a bit more tricky. The ones we know about, apart from the
Aslan and the human, was a flame, an ice crystal, a cloud, a sine wave,
and two flames. The flame and the ice crystal can be Fire and Cold. The 
cloud could be Air, Gas, or Water (or any of the philosophical concepts, 
of course; a cloud could be the symbol of hope to an agrarian community
("I do so hope it will rain")). The sine wave I eventually assigned to
Signal, which gave me a jagged zig-zag line for it\'s opposite, Noise.

Now, going down the list here are the symbols I came up with for each coyn:

Void	    Nothing engraved. A blank disc.
Soil	    A massive cliff. 
Air	    A white cloud (ie. the outline of a cloud).
Gas	    A black cloud (ie. a filled-in outline of a cloud).
Water	    A foam-flecked wave.
Fire	    A flame.

(Except for the Void and the Fire I\'m pretty dissatisfied with these, but
they are the best I can come up with. Any suggestions?)

Darkness    Two different sized cresents (The moons of Eskaloyt)
Light	    A sun.
Cold	    An ice crystal.
Heat	    A campfire (Two flames arising from a tree log). 
Signal	    A sine wave.
Noise	    A zig-zag line.

Voyages	    A sailing ship.
Justice	    A ceremonial spear[4].
Chance	    Six sticks in a random pattern[5].
Beast	    A ferocious six-limbed carnivore in mid-jump[6].
Mercenary   A big-headed droyne with arms and armour[7].
Phoenix	    A six-limbed animal surrounded by flames.

[4] Used by primitive Droyne leaders to dispatch those judged guilty or
    supurfluous to the community (This must have been before krinaytsyu
    became common; when it did, the Leader kept the spear as his symbol
    of authority).
[5] The Droyne use such sticks to generate random numbers according to 
    the pattern they fall in; coyn drawing is not, of course, considered 
    a random procedure since theyare assumed to predict future events.
[6] The _Stomfelk_, the most feared predator on Eskaloyt.
[7] I reasoned that mercenaries must be krinaytsoyni, and the most common
    krinaytsoyni are leaders. Hence a leader with weapons for a mercenary.

Genesis	    An egg.
Death	    A droyne skull.
Achievement A brimful cup.
Defeat	    An empty, tipped-over cup.
Hope	    Six stars in a random pattern[8].
Sacrifice   A droyne sitting with eyes closed[9].


[8] Well, what can I say? If I could come up with good symbols for Air
    and Gas, I\'d use the (rain) cloud for hope. As it is I\'m falling back
    on a Droyne constellation symbolising hope.
[9] A droyne commiting krinaytsyui, of course.

The Hissayt, Emissyob, Ayvaylk, Bestoy, Nebbay, and Hayyarm are various
six-limbed herbivores and omnivores once important to Droyne hunters. I
had descriptions of them all worked out, but those notes seems to have
dissappeared.

Finally the two special coyns:

Droyne	   A group of three droyne, a leader, a drone, and a worker[10].
Eskaloyt   Some strange irregular outlines (diferent on the two sides)[11].

[10] In other words, an alpha-male, a female, and a beta-male.
[11] Polar projections of Eskaloyt. Since they don\'t have the lattitude
     and longitude lines common to human map projections they are unlikely 
     to be identified as such by humans. 

Well, that\'s what I\'ve got so far. Any comments?

         David Johnson was looking for some suggestions about the governent
         of the Regency - here\'s my take on it:

         ----%<----

         Government Structure of the Regency

         The Regency has three actual branches of government: Legislative,
         Judicial, Executive; and the Military.  The legislative branch
         consists of two chambers, the Moot and the Senate, which share
         power.  The judicial branch consists of a series of appeals courts
         of varying power, and executive branch consists of the various
         Governors.  The military is not a separate branch, but is not
         beholden to the other branches.  The Regent is the highest level
         of authority for each branch.

         At the top of this hierarchy, wielding the highest power of the
         executive, legislative, judicial and military branches, is the
         Regent.  The office is held for life and passed on to the
         designated heir.  The Regent appoints candidates to all executive
         and judical posts on the sector and subsector levels, subject to
         confirmation by the Senate.  The armed forces are controlled
         directly by the Regent with no oversight by the Senate or the
         Moot.  The titles held by the Regent include, but are not limited
         to:  Lord Regent of the Third Imperium, Archduke of Deneb,
         President of the Senate, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Navy,
         and Supreme Marshall of the Imperial Army.

         The Moot is the senior chamber of the legislative branch, composed
         of the peers of baronial rank and higher in the realm who serve as
         long as they maintain their title (usually for life, although
         abdications do occur).  There is approximately one noble per
         planet in the Regency, and as such, the Moot tends to favor the
         rights of lower population worlds.  The members of the Moot are
         predominantly human.  Although the Moot does vote to confirm the
         succession to the Regency, this power is mitigated by the fact
         that they can only vote for, not against a new Regent.
         Politically the Moot tends to be dominated by the Aristocratic,
         Imperiallist and Sovreignist blocks.

         The Senate is technically the junior chamber of the legislature,
         although in fact it is more active politcally than the Moot.
         Senators are popularly elected representatives of Senatorial
         Districts of approximately 1 billion sophonts.  Being based on
         population, these districts can vary in size from a portion of a
         world to a dozen or more entire worlds.  Because of this, the
         Senate tends to favor the high population worlds, where some 96%
         of the Regency\'s population live.  In addition, the Senate is a
         more cosmopolitan body, with 29 Llelywolly Senators from Junidy,
         11 Gl\'lu Senators from Kibushish, one Ebokin Senator from Yebab,
         several Aslan Senators from the spinward regions, and even one
         Chirper Senator from Vanejeen.  Senators serve 10 year terms, and
         may be elected to no more than 3 terms in succession.  The Senate
         has the power to confirm or reject all appointments to the
         Judicial and Executive branches made by the Regent. Unsuprisingly,
         the Senate tends to hold Democratic/Interventionist views.

         The judicial branch exists to decide when (or if) Regency law has
         been violated, and consisists of a series of courts at various
         levels that have the ability to review the decisions of courts at
         lower levels. The lowest level are the Regency District Courts,
         corresponding to the Senatorial Districts.  These courts are the
         base of Regency law, and spend much of their time hearing local
         cases dealing with conflicts between Regency law and the local
         laws.  Decisions of the District Courts may be appealed to the
         Subsector Appeals Court, which can in turn lead to an appeal to
         the Regent\'s Court on Mora.  The final avenue of appeal is
         directly to the Regent, who can reverse the decision of any
         Regency Court.  Justices of the District Courts are elected from
         the district.  Justices of the Appeals and Regent\'s courts are
         appointed by the Regent for indefinite terms, but are subject to
         confirmation by the Senate.  They may be removed from office by
         the Regent, or by a vote of the Senate.

         The executive branch consists of the Subsector Governors appointed
         by the Regent and confirmed by the Senate, and Planetary Governors
         appointed by the Senate.  It\'s purpose is to ensure that the will
         of the Senate and of the Regent is carried out.  Thus the
         Governors are responsible for collection of taxes, implementation
         of policy and enforcement of Regency law.

         The military in the Regency is not an actual branch of the
         government, but it funtions in many was as such.  The head of the
         military is the Regent, and under him are the Admirals and
         Marshals of the Realm.  Each Sub-Sector has a Fleet admiral
         assigned to it, and each high population world has a Reserve
         Admiral in charge of the reserve fleet, and a General in charge of
         the planet\'s ground forces.  The military, through the person of
         the Regent (undoubtedly with advice from the Senate and the Moot),
         has the right to decide when to wage war or make peace.  It is
         effectively outside the the control of the Senate, the Moot and
         the Governors on most matters.  The military is, however, bound to
         uphold Regency law, and thus must obey decisions of the judiciary.

         ----%<----

         I have tried to incorporate a few important ideas in this outline,
         most importantly the divisions of power between the Senate and the
         Moot, and their different focuses (i.e., the population based
         Senate v. the planet based Moot), the conflict between
         Sovreignists and Interventionists (to use David Johnson\'s terms),
         and the role of the Regent as the font of all political power. 

         One idea that I would particularly like comment on is the
         Senatorial District.  It would seem odd to me to allow , say,
         Menorb and Pixie the same level of representation given their
         different populations.  So I have combined Pixie into one district
         with Menorb, Yres and Boughene.  This gives a fairly compact
         district of 3,060,900,800 (New Era figures) which is further
         divided into three subdistricts, each of which elect one Senator.
         This seems to be more in tune with a democratic body than the
         arbitrary sector/subsector designation, as it can recognize
         clusters of worlds as sharing common circumstances without giving
         them seperate governments.  The main problem with this is the
         exact nature of the districts (they are a pain to figure out), but
         that seems ok to me too..it lets things stay flexible as
         populations grow and shift.  And just imagine the fights in the
         Senate of over redistricting!  I can see a whole adventure based
         on census taking, and whether the population of Wochiers has
         really passed 1 billion.  How\'s that for cerebral adventuring?  

         Also, this concept gives the minor races more of a chance to have
         representation in the Senate.  Imagine a Gl\'lu delegation
         wandering around in insulated suits full of ammonia - how\'s that
         to remind your players that they aren\'t in Kansas anymore.



         So there you go guys...  go to town!  I\'m off to the beach for a
         few days...I can\'t wait to get back and see what you all think!

Oh yuck.  The MT 400 d-ton SDB had a specific gravity of about 2.0 laden,
so it wasn\'t a problem before.  You could give up some of the hydrogen fuel
storage and flood those fuel tanks with water, er, "unrefined fuel".  It
would take 29 G-turns worth to bring the SDB\'s specific gravity to just
over 1.0.  That would add about 725 tonnes of mass to the ship.  Since the
SDB has 112 G-turns, I suppose you could pay the price. 

Seems to me that you\'d be better served adding armor to the hull and getting
some added value out of the mass -- besides, superdense armor is more compact.
But maybe there\'d be some value in "crash surfacing" with this design.

This is a good point but one might wonder then why Sacnoth has not made

Maybe, but it\'s tough to fight a prolonged war this way against an opponent
who can produce his own goods internallly.  Essentially though, this is what
I\'ve proposed for Gram - it\'s been receiving aid from the Zhodani.

This extreme is an attempt to build the Star Wars Death Star 
main weapon.  Some time ago I retrieved the following from 
rec.arts.sf.science, posted by Erik Max Francis, 
max@alcyone.darkside.com, in response to a question there:

Now for Earth, from the sci.astro faq, we have:

(1) G =   6.673e-11 N m^2/kg^2 (7e-11)
(2) M =   5.974e24 kg
(3) R =   6.371e6  m

Which, unless I have screwed up here, is about 2.25e32 j, or 
2.25e26 Mj

So if we want to build a death star, we need a weapon (a 
Meson Gun would seem ideal) which will feed that much energy 
into the core of a planet in a reasonably short period of 
time -- say about 30 minutes.

Lets assume that we can design the weapon with an ROF of 100.

This gives us a discharge energy of 2.26e24 Mj.  Working at 
TL 14 and selecting a tunnel length of 250 m (to give a short 
range of 10 hexes, the other calculations fall out:

3a Effective Tunnel Length 300m
3b Tunnel Volume           5.62e24 m^3
3c Cross Sectional Area    2.25e22 (a diameter of 8e7 km !!)
3d Tunnel Mass             3.37e24
3e Tunnel Price            5.63e23 MCr

I won\'t bore you with damage values, which run from 7e12 
down.

Well, so much for the Meson armed death star -- back to the 
drawing board, Darth.

This is fine but you have to recognize the `inter-relatedness\' of the
feudal system.  The vassals provide local resources (knights, taxes, etc.)
to the lord in return for coordinated services (military protection).  This
is what distiguishes a feudal system from a simple aristocracy where their
is no inter-relatedness.

Yes, this is technocracy but it has no system of inter-relatedness.  If the
technocrats are merely advisors appointed by the ruler then they serve at
her whim.  This is not a feudal system.

I don\'t think so.  Rather, it is merely a technocracy (such as exists in
many contemporary nations) within an aristocratic system.

I hope I\'ve distinguished the difference between corporate government and
a feudal technocracy in my prior post in response to Hans.  One key is the
matter of scale.  A corporate government only works on a relatively small
scale (hence the lower government digit) while a feudal technocracy works
on a larger scale.  This difference of scale results in siginficant
differences between the two types.

There is a more elegant solution to this inconsistency and Hans has already
suggested the answer.  If you think of tech level as being tied to economic
growth in an environment where each technological breakthrough need not
be `rediscovered\' but merely `grown into\' (in an economic sense) it\'s
actually quite simple.

If you think of the economic growth of Regina from it\'s settlement in 75
you would expect the situation to go something like this: early economic
activity would be highly exploitative with natural resources being extracted
for export and most manufactured goods imported; eventually, indigineous
industry would appear but even this would be limted at first.  Regina
quickly became a hub for further exploration and development in the Marches
so it\'s economy would move from exploitation of natural resources to one
of trading services where manufactured goods from the Core were shipped
out to developing worlds and resources from these worlds were shipped back
to the Core (probably just Deneb sector).  This `trading post\' economy
would continue for quite some time (similar to, say, St. Louis in the
exploitation of the American West - it had been settled a *long* time and
had quite a large population before any automobiles were manufactured there).
Eventually, as `civilization\' moved into the Marches, a `full\' economy would
emerge on Regina with a significant industrial base.  This would lead to
rather significant increases in economic output and thus tech level.

I hope I made this clearer in my last response to Hans.  It seems to me
that what\'s happening (and not particularly with you, Cynthia, nor Hans) is
that many folks are confusing feudalism with aristocracy.  Feudalism is based
upon mutual obligations between the lord and his vassals.  An aristocracy
has no such requirement.  In medieval feudal aristocracies these obligations
were centered around military affairs.  In a feudal technocracy the
technocracy `buzz-word\' shifts the focus from military affairs to industrial
activities (including service industries) but the system of mutual obligations
remains.  It is these mutual obligations that distinguish a feudal technocracy
from a corporate government.

Right, but we\'re not talking about knowledge here, we\'re talking about
the ability to *produce* a certain level of technology, i.e. industry.
(Tech level 15 *knowledge* ought to be available from your local library
data terminal on most Imperial worlds.)  For the ability to *produce* a
certain level of technology to `go away\' you\'d have to have a *severe*
economic down turn like the Long Night or the Viral Collapse.

As one of those people and a long-time space advocate I have to admit that
*no* space project has been cancelled or postponed due to budgetary
constraints.  Budget decisions represent a redirection of *priorities*,
not a lack of economic resources.  In the same period that space technology
has been virtually stagnant (c1970 to the present) there have been 
*tremendous* advances in computer, medical and biological technologies.
(Of course these fields haven\'t had the `advantage\' of almost complete
government subsidy that the space program has had.)

> Money funds research. Research advances Technology. Therefore, economic

Yes, but it won\'t affect the ability to produce technology in the Imperium
where the higher tech knowledge already exists.  Neither does it explain
*reductions* in the ability to produce a certain level of technology.

A better example (Oh no, I\'m making Hans\'s point!) might be to compare Detroit
to the Japanese automakers.  Because Nissan, Toyota and Honda were able to
produce higher quality automobiles more efficiently there was nearly a
*de facto* tech level drop in the US.  Nevertheless, even this example 
only concerns a particular industry which might explain a drop in one
of the *WBH* tech level specialty areas.  An overall tech level drop would
have to affect *several* sectors at the same time.  IMHO, that could only
be caused by a major economic catastrophe.

This is a good point on which to redirect this discussion back to the
original purpose.  How do we determine naval and army (ground/air/sea)
force composition and organization for the Regency?  I don\'t care whether
we use *5FW*/*RS* protocols or *HG*/*TCS*/*POT* protocols.  I made an
initial suggestion for the Sword Worlds using my best guess at *5FW*/*RS*
protocols which got the shorts of a lot of TCS-ites in knots.  Fine.
So will some of those TCS-ites *please* make an alternate suggestion?
I\'d do it myself but I don\'t have *TCS* or *POT*.

Here are some questions to consider:

How are Regency naval and army forces organized at the subsector and sector
level?

What is the overall composition of Regency military forces?

What is the compostion of a `typical\' Regency naval squadron and a `typical\'
army battalion/regiment/division/corps/whatever-you-think-the-`basic\'-unit-
ought-to-be?

Who are the major military figures in the Regency?

I don\'t either.  I\'d really rather see folks suggestion *alternatives* to

they disagree with.  The latter course is neither interesting *nor* useful.

Let\'s get back to our TML Regency sourcebook, *Shall Not Perish*.

My ccr2 worth on the Vargr and Aslan incursions.

As for the Vargr at high pop worlds like Junidy, consider this: nuclear
blackmail.  A corsair band shows up, threatens to drop some nukes unless
the locals surrender, so the locals do.  This wouldn\'t work in the `old\'
days because the Imperial Navy would show up, blockade the world, and
chase the Vargr down in the Extents if they fled.  (Remember, the Vargr
aren\'t suicidal, just greedy, ruthless and opportunistic.)  In the chaos of
the Rebellion such an Imperial response became much less likely so some Vargr
were emboldened.

As for the *ihatei*, clearly these Aslan came to dominate high pop worlds
like Aki and Glisten through economic and diplomatic means as well as military
means.  It\'s one thing to say Glisten would fight when they\'re assured of
eventual relief from the interior; it\'s quite another when that relief is
much less certain - especially when reliance upon that relief from the
interior has been ingrained for centuries.  (Texans like to think of
ourselves as tough cookies but if a Latin American army showed up at
Houston one day and it was unclear when, if ever, the US Army was going
to help out, I wouldn\'t put it past the Mayor to quitely succomb to `these
wonderful benefactors from the South\'.)

As for the eventual reincorporation of *ihatei*-occupied worlds into the
Regency I suspect many of those Aslan settlers would have no problem
becoming Domain citizens once the Domain Navy *did* show up and it was
certainly a lot simpler (and less bloody) to accept this *fait accompli*
than to try to eject the *ihatei* squatters.

It\'s the very concept.  I accept that some technological variations might
be tied to economic fluctuations but I have great difficulty with the idea
that overall technological capability (what TL measures) is going to vary
much unless there are *huge* fluctuations in the economy, i.e. the Long
Night or Viral Collapse.

The examples you cited are fine but they only refer to individual firms.
For the techno-economic cycles to occur they have to affect entire
industries.  A particular Gram jump drive manufacturer might get a `jump\'
on a particular Sacnoth jump drive manufacturer but for the techno-
economics theory to hold *several* Gram industries (ship building, medical
tech, communications, robotics, *et al*) would have to `get a jump\' on
similar industries on Sacnoth.  This really seems to be a stretch of the
imagination to me.  I\'ll admit it\'s possible but it\'s not very darn likely.

Yes, I\'m aware of *WBH* but while this might explain a particular circumstance
it doesn\'t explain the subsector-wide situation.  Gram might have higher
space tech than Sacnoth but by the same reasoning Narsil might have higher
space tech than both.  This just leads to ever-more-insidious possibilities.

Wait a minute!  This is the same `reasoning\' UFO-nuts use to make claims
about ET visitors.  It is the burden of any claimant to provide evidence
of their claim.  Merely suggesting that your argument can\'t be disproved does
not make your point!

Certainly they could have but I believe they were copying Piper wholeheartedly
and were merely `updating\' to fit the general attitudes of their own time.
They certainly intended for folks to `play\' Sword Worlders and so didn\'t
want them to be too repressive (like the Solomani which were never featured
as anything but `bad guys\' until *Solomani and Aslan*).

We seem to go back and forth on this.  I accept that technological
achievement (TL) is tied to economic capability.  What I don\'t accept
is that fluctuations in the economy (relatively minor in the overall scheme
of things) are reflected in *fluctuations* in technological achievement
(a relatively major event).  Again, why the need to propose this in the
absence of *any* evidence of a downward technological `fluctuation\'?

I don\'t know but nothing about this slow rate of advancement calls out for
your mysterious techno-economic cycles.  I might suggest that this problem
arises from our own limited contemporary experience in which GDW has tied
technological achievement of several tech levels (TL ~5-8) to a chronological
period that only spans a single lifetime.

Not true.  Gorram Shipyards was an industrial fief, not a land fief.  There
was also banking fief.  A feudal technocracy works similar to the feudal
aristocracy we are more familiar with.  The difference is that the medieval
feudal arstocracy was tied to land fiefs as you describe while a feudal
technocracy is tied to industrial and service fiefs that exist in `modern\'
society.

We all know these obligations were often ignored and `legitmacy\' often
fell to the most charismatic or otherwise powerful liege lord.  This is
the whole basis of the Arturian legend.  Uther Pendragon lost his kingship
as his vassals rebelled or refused to support him.  Arthur regained that
kingship by uniting those vassals in the Fellowship of the Round Table.

No.  A feudal technocracy is a system of government where the owners of
industrial production give their support in exchange for economic opportunity
or `protection\'.  A medieval baron pledged his knights and a portion of
his economic wealth to his liege.  In return, the liege-holder (ulitmately a
king) agreed to use the combined strength of all of his barons to protect
each fiefdom from assault or other danger (like internal strife).  Similarly,
in a feudal technocracy like the *kieritsu*, the owners of industrial
production pledge their economic support (i.e. cooperation) to a central
authority which cooridinates the efforts of various industrial and service
sectors towards the perceived common good, namely profits.  This is a 
voluntary arrangement where the individual corporate entities may or may not
choose to continue to cooperate.  Just as feudal barons might choose to
no longer support their liege and often did just that when they perceived
an advantage for themselves.

> Who owns the corporation in a corporate government? Who owns it in a feudal
> technocracy? What\'s the difference?

In a corporate government there are a single group of shareholders as
represented by the corporate board of directors.  This board acts in essence
as a single entity.  In a feudal technocracy there are several *different*
and independent groups of shareholders (i.e. the `barons\') who each act
as *separate* and distinct entities.

> I think it would be useful to agree on the equivalences of various terms
> in the three systems we\'re talking about.

I don\'t think it\'s appropriate at all to discuss a corporate model
here.  A corporate government is a specialized form of an autocracy.  In
a corporate model there is, in theory at least, no imput at all from those
participating in the system.  You just do what the boss says or you\'re fired.
I\'ll focus my comments on the comparison of feudal aristocracy and feudal
technocracy and try to point out where the corporate model isn\'t relevant
as appropriate.

This isn\'t correct.  In a feudal aristocracy the king does not `own\' the
land.  Rather the king supplies `coordinated services\' (i.e. joint military
protection) in return for `cooperation\' from his vassals (i.e. local military
forces and tax revenue).

No, the king is the equivalent of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
The Chairman provides `coordinated activites\', i.e. `running the company\'
in return for the financial support of the shareholders, i.e. `cooperation\'.
A true feudal technocracy is much more complicated than this because it
concerns *all* of the shareholders of *all* of the industrial and service
entities acting in the entire marketplace.  In this sense, if there is a
`king\' he has gained monopoly control of the entire economic sytem.  This
is why US industry fears the Japanese *kieritsu* so much.  They are concerned
that their coordinated activity gives Japanese industry a competitive
advantage.

No, the dividends received by shareholders in a feudal technocracy are
equivalent to the military protection received by fiefholders in a feudal
aristocracy.

No, *shareholders* are the equivalent of *fiefholders*.  Each block of 
shareholders, represented by their boards of directors, is equivalent to
the fiefholders of a feudal aristocracy.  Each block of shares is a fief.

There\'s no conflict here!  Trask could have sold only a portion of Traskon.
He owned that entire block of shares of the total economic sector of Gram.
Remember, it was partially because of the greater economic power he gained
from the acquisition of Traskon that *Duke* Angus eventually became *King*
Angus.  Traskon Barony increased Angus\'s share of the total economic output
(GPP?) of Gram and thereby led to him becoming king by virtue of his control
of the largest portion of the entire economy.

Right.  And in a feudal technocracy, `dukes\' are merely those who control
large blocks of industrial production - shareholders.

Yes, he provides coordinated control of the combined assets of shareholders
(like the pension funds) in an effort to produce profits and hence dividends
or increased stock value for the shareholders.  This is just like the feudal
aristocratic model where the king provides coordinated control of the 
combined resources of fiefholders in an effort to produce security.

*Au contraire*!  The pension funds and other shareholders provide *cash*
to the chairman just as aristocratic vassals provided military forces and
tax revenue to the king.

It is *exactly* the same.

We\'re saying the same thing.  If the technocratic baron chooses to place
his support in the hands of a different lord he transfers not only economic
power but political power as well.

> If he owns them he can dictate who gets to buy them.

He doesn\'t own them just as an aristocratic king didn\'t own his vassals\'
fiefs.  If Uther Pendragon had `owned\' the fief of Cornwall he could have
just `removed\' the Duke and taken his wife Igrayne.  Instead he was forced
to lay seige to Cornwall when the Duke no longer chose to support him.

or profits from the technocratic king.

It is in a feudal technocracy.  Again, it\'s why US industry fears the 
Japanese.

He is if he really enjoys a full tech level advantage.  (Of course, you
must give up your `cycles\' to accept this point.)

Yes, he might except that the TL 12 vassals on Sacnoth might choose to
no longer support Anders (since their TL 12 industry ought to be better
able to compete *against* Anders\'s TL 11 holdings on Gram) and so they
would strive for their own competitive advantage and thus greater politcal
power.  Eventually, some Sacnoth vassal of Anders\'s would rise to a
position of dominance on Sacnoth as King Thorvald or whomever.

> If Anders owns all of Gram he will have to put people in charge of parts of

No, if Anders of placing people in control then they enjoy their control
*at his whim*.  This is not a feudal arrangement at all.  It is autocracy
*and* similar *then* to the corporate model.
 
> Again you assume that Harald and his ancestors would want to conquer Gram

No, I\'m just assuming that a little military action might make the economic
conquest of Gram a little simpler.  Think of Japan with a full tech level
advantage, a nuclear arsenal and the ability to project global military force.
There\'d be no `voluntary\' import restrictions on Japanese autos in the US in
that scenario!

For the same reason Entrope isn\'t TL 15: Economic problems at a level of
detailing that we haven\'t bothered to go into. The facts we can\'t get
away from is that Gram is TL 11 (overall) in 1110 and Sacnoth is Tl 12
(again overall). Apart from that we can do anything as long as we think it
makes sense. Like make Gram TL 12 in Space Technology (and even Sacnoth
TL 11 in space technology if you feel that is necessary to explain why
they aren\'t top dog). But to make Sacnoth TL 14 in space technology (or
in anything) is to magnify the very problems you complain about.

So? With imported tech you may be able to win a short war against someone
who can produce what you have to import even if you can\'t win a long one. 
With no imports you\'d lose even a short war. So the imports makes sense
in any case.

Unfortunately I haven\'t seen it. Could you mail me a copy if you still have
it on file? I\'m particularily interested in your response to my comparisons
of various features of feudal, corporate, and feudal tech societies.

But why do you assume that the TL digit of an UWP has anything to do with
_ability_ to produce? To me it makes just as much sense that the TL is
the level of technology actually produced, regardless of capability. That\'s
why I think an economic downturn can affect TL; when it\'s no longer 
profitable to build something the society stops doing it, even though they
still could if they had to  -  and we have a TL decline.

That brings us to a dead end. I think it could be caused by less than 
catastrophic declines in economic affairs, but then, I\'m profoundly ignorant 
of economics. It\'s mostly SF to me ;-). So by now we\'re down to different
articles of faith. So I\'m signing off the \'technological cycles\' debate
unless someone else interjects new blood. You don\'t think they\'re possible, 
I do. End of story. I\'d much rather get on with finding out just how a
feudal technocracy actually works.

This above suggests the Senate is the `upper\' house rather than the Moot, i.e.
it has more power.

If nobles of baronial rank are to be included there will be *several* per
planet.  Barons are responsible for planetary regions and cities.  Marquises
rule at the planetary level.

I like this idea but it has to be rectified with the above issue.

A good point but one might hope that by the 57th(?) Century folks might have
come to realize that a person of one ethnic group might still be able to
represent the interests of other groups (as opposed to the unfortunately
commonly held view to the contrary in contemporary America).

Good, good.

This suggests the aristocracy has given up its traditional judicial role
held under the Imperium.  This is a major change that represents a major
loss of power for the nobility.  Is there a rationale for this loss?

>          The executive branch consists of the Subsector Governors appointed

This represents another loss of power for the nobility.  One wonders just
what the nobility does in the Regency?  And more importantly, how they came
to lose such influence?

>          Moot, and their different focuses (i.e., the population based
>          Senate v. the planet based Moot)

This is a good idea but I\'m not sure how to rectify it with the inclusion
of barons in the Moot.  (And I don\'t see how barons could be excluded either.)
Maybe there is a way to deal with this by adjusting the population levels
for the Senate districts.  How many Senators are there in the Regency at one
per billion population?  Lowering this number to one per half billion (or
less) would increase the number of Senators (and correspondingly the 
influence of hi-pop worlds) with repsect to the barons of the Moot.

Electing Senators at-large in any of these mulit-billion districts would
further enhance the influence of hi-pop worlds.  In your example one might
expect Pixie, Yres and Boughene (and possibly part of Menorb) to be included
as one sub-district (and thereby give the smaller worlds a chance at some
representation).  On the other hand, three at-large Senators would all be
likely to come from Menorb.

This is some great work.  I might suggest as a modification leaving the
judicial function in the hands of the nobility.  (They\'ve already been
weakened by the appearance of the Senate abd it doesn\'t really affect the
split in the power structure you\'ve outlined.)  Furthermore, the Regent\'s
Governors (subsector and world) are also a big threat to the nobles.  They
also seem to be in direct conflict.  (What\'s the relationship between the
Duke of Vincennes and the Subsector Governor or the Marquise of Efate and
the Planetary Governor?)  Maybe these Regency executives only exist in fiefs
where the noble patents have been vacated, either through death without
issue or through the dislocations resulting from the Rebellion and the Viral
Assault?  Possibly, for example, there is no longer a Marquis of Glisten
but rather an *ihatei* Governor (I\'d prefer `Resident\' for worlds to
distinguish them from a subsector Governor) who was appointed by the Regent
when Glisten came back `into the fold\'.

Again, Wes, great work!

The trick is, they\'re related. You can\'t simply nhave TL15 knowledge. You
also have to have references to TL14, TL13, TL12, etc to build upon. All of
this takes up space, whther physical or virtual. To use modern equipmetn
analogies, if a world can\'t afford, or decides to redirect its prioroites,
it may have less "disk space" than is required to hold all the Imperial
TL15 data. So sure, a few places may act as repositories of information,
but it may not be very available, and the world will still have (generally)
access to only TL x.

>*no* space project has been cancelled or postponed due to budgetary

And why do we redirect those priorites? Because we can\'t afford to explore
all of them equally. Six of one - I said it was half empty, and you said
itwas half full.

discussion re:  feudal technocracies, I thought I\'d try again.  Here goes:

                            FEUDAL TECHNOCRACY

     I have been following the Sword Worlds debate with only mild
interest, but a line in one of the posts struck my attention. 
What follows is entirely tangential to that discussion, however.

     One of the participants in the SW thread said, concerning
feudal technocracies, that he or she thought there should be
"something feudal" about them.  That set me to thinking about
what a feudal technocracy is, at least in Traveller terms.

     First, some purely hypothetical statistics as background. 
How often do feudal technocracies occur within the Imperium?  The
number of worlds in the Third Imperium is given as 11,000:  I
don\'t know where that came from, but I will use it here.  That
means, using the world generation routine given in the rules --


             THIRD IMPERIUM FEUDAL TECHNOCRACIES BY POPULATION

Pop  Freq  Feud Tech:   %Occur     #Occur
 0    2.7%     DR 12     .001         11
 1    5.5%     DR 11     .003         33     
 2    8.3%     DR 10     .007         77
 3   11.1%     DR 9      .012        132 
 4   13.9%     DR 8      .019        209
 5   16.6%     DR 7      .028        303

 8    8.3%     DR 4      .007         77
 9    5.5%     DR 3      .003         33     
 A    2.7%     DR 2      .001         11

               TOTAL =   .112       1227

Pop:           UWP Population Code
Freq:          Population code frequency within Imperium
Feud Tech:     Die roll required for UWP gov code 5
%Occur:        Frequency of UWP gov 5 worlds @ pop code
#Occur:        Number of UWP gov 5 worlds @ pop code     

Thus, approximately one-tenth of the worlds within the Imperium
may be feudal technocracies.  A majority of these are small
communities under one million in population, though a very few
high-pop feudal technocracies exist.  Interestingly, UWP Gov Code
5 may be the mode of the government type data set -- that is, the
most frequently occuring value.  I haven\'t done the math on that,
but it is intuitive given the results above.
     The above chart implies that feudal technocracies are a
common category of government throughout the Imperium.  It can be
inferred from the above that a feudal technocratic government is
best suited to an intermediate-sized community, for reasons which
may or may not be clear.  I would argue that feudal arrangements,
by defining the relationships among the individual members of a
society, grow too complicated above a certain population size or
density.

     It may be helpful, at this point, to elaborate upon what a
feudal technocracy is.  In a discussion of the concept of
feudalism, a historian named Morris Bishop said that it is "one
of those words that have taken on so many extended and figurative
meanings that the original [one] has been obscured."  Bishop goes
on to say that feudalism "is a total organization of society,"
specifying the status of individuals within its purview, and
establishing implicit and explicit responsibilities among them. 
     In medieval times, this feudalism centered around land,
agriculture, and military service.  In terms of the Third
Imperium, a feudal technocracy may focus on very different
elements.

     The central idea of a feudal society, in any event, is the
codification of the complex web of social, legal, and economic
interrelationships among its members.  The term "government" is
therefore somewhat of a misnomer.  (I suspect that many a feudal
technocracy may appear to be a balkanized world to the untrained
observer.)  UWP Gov Code 5 refers to feudal *societies*.

     If we accept the definition of a "technocracy" to be "a
government by an elite controlling some aspect of the application
of the society\'s technology", then the worlds to which we assign
UWP Gov Code 5 must meet two criteria.  
     First, the legal rights, responsibilities, and roles of
individuals must be defined in terms of their socioeconomic
status (thus, "feudal").  
     Second, an elite class which controls some critical
technology must make up a privileged, ruling class (ergo,
"technocracy").
     This critical technology may be military technology -- the
lance, armor, and warhorse of the medieval knight, for example --
but does not have to be.  Nor is it necessarily a single
technology:  access to more advanced technical knowledge and
resources may be sufficient.
     However, the existence of a critical technology helps to
differentiate a feudal technocracy from an oligarchy.  It occurs
to me as well that, whereas oligarchies may tend to be relatively
homogeneous ("monolithic" in World Builder\'s Handbook terms),
feudal technocracies admit more possibility for conflict, as the
elites may sometimes work at cross-purposes -- though within the
social bounds established by the feudal arrangement.

     How many different types of social systems can be posited
which fit the first half of this definition?  I could think of
five; there are probably more.

1.  Traditional Feudalism:  An elite, usually military, ruling
over a producing "proletariat" of farmers and laborers.  A
separate intellectual class may exist, as well as a small
mercantile class.

2.  Corporate Feudalism:  A complex arrangement consisting of
individual economic organizations within which "employees" and
"managers" have certain specified tasks.  "Owners" in one form or
another may serve as the ruling class, but the managerial elite
will, by virtue of their expertise, have considerable power.  The
corporations themselves are bound by a web of economic alliances
and buyer-seller arrangements.

3.  Contract Feudalism:  Within this type of society, economic
relations between individuals are defined in terms of "contracts"
which may be implicit or tacit but which, by certain behaviors,
all parties acknowledge to be legally binding.

4.  Arcological Feudalism:  The society is arranged as one or
more arcologies; that is, self-contained and economically self-
sufficient communities.  As with corporate feudalism, an elite
managerial class of technical experts holds considerable power
within the society.

5.  Caste Feudalism:  All economic roles are hereditary and
confer a greater or lesser degree of social status upon the
possessor.  The highest caste controls the society\'s critical
technologies.

     It is difficult, perhaps, to imagine a society wherein the
critical technology is not military.  It might help, therefore,
to do some brainstorming on this issue.  Some of the following
may be reasonable:

1.   MEDICAL - The society\'s elite are the doctors who can extend
or deny life-saving treatment, including anagathics.  Rather than
the Hippocratic Oath, their credo is to advance the interests of
society as a whole by their efforts.

2.  TRANSPORT - In a world where communities are isolated and not
self-sufficient, those who control transport technology exert a
great deal of influence upon other members of the society.

3.  COMPUTER - In a complex economy, those who control the
computers and telecommunications technology that enable it to run
smoothly hold considerable power to direct resources as they see
fit.  In some places, highly advanced AI-like "expert systems"
may be the elite.  ("The Computer is your friend.")

4.  ENERGY - By controlling an industrial society\'s sources of
energy, those who build, maintain, and direct a world\'s power
grid can gain considerable political influence and economic
advantage.

5.  ENVIRONMENT - In a hostile environment, the engineers who
control and maintain life support systems are of critical
importance, and may be able to extract political power from their
position.  Alternately, the toxin-removing, food-preparing
"shugilii" of the Vilani may fall into this category.

     The above elements can be combined to provide the referee
with some inspiration when obliged to detail a UWP Gov Code 5
world.  For example, a Pre-stellar world with caste feudalism and
medical technocracy may require the genetic typing of children to
determine their "proper" function in society.  The highest caste
may be the Eugenes, who manipulate the breeding of the lower
castes to achieve their ends.  Lower castes accept the system
with the belief that adherence to "Wedding Protocols" will result
in higher caste offspring, and thereby advancement.
     Travellers to this planet will be struck by its unusual
social structure.  Alien, indeed.  Possibilities for patrons and
adventures exist here, as well.  The Eugenes may wish to improve
the breeding stock by gaining some high-quality off-world genetic
material, and commission the PCs to find suitable donors.  A rich
but low-caste trader might desire the PCs to use their High
Stellar computer expertise to falsify her son\'s genetic record so
that he will be declared suitable for high caste upon reaching
maturity.

     The point of this admittedly lengthy post is that worlds in
a science fiction adventure should be to some degree alien or at
least exotic, and should serve as gateways to adventures that are
not just "cowboys with rayguns".  Or Star Vikings with assault
rifles.  
     Feudal technocracies, to continue the metaphor, do not have
to be barons with blasters.  

     All the above is IMHO, of course.  I know there are some
holes in my argument.  Any comments, gripes, protestations,
modifications, exhortations, helpful hints, complaints, or
accusations will be greatly appreciated.
