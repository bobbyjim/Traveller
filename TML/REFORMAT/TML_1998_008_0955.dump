You can just push on the gyro; I think some satellites are oriented using
gyros as the active element. It ought to work for ship twisting, given
sufficient gyro mass. It works to keep a 50,000 ton ocean liner or
battleship upright in sea conditions that would otherwise involve 
quaint rolling motions.

You don\'t need a flywheel. Set up magnets in the rotating section (lets
call it a rotor) and in the stationary section (lets call it a stator) and
use the whole spin assembly as a generator (like regenerative breaking) and
convert the kinetic energy into electrical, which you then use to charge up
your screens and HPGs in 2300....

The only down side of this is that both sections will end up rotating.
In space, there is no "stationary" and you Newton rules... if you have
a spinning section you need to slow down or speed up while keeping
another section non-rotating, you\'ll need either some kind of thruster
or a flywheel to store that rotational momentum in.

  Well, there are two periods to consider, obviously, specifically
pre-Rebellion and during the war.

  We are forced to assume (if d-tanks are functional) that the mega
corps didn\'t institute wide-spread d-tank operations, certainly not
on the periphery, anyway. The TNS item about the destroyed liner
might have a lot to do with it - the liability implications might
have encouraged them to wait years to ensure that risk levels were
low, and that the circumstances impacting that risk were equally
well explored. This is merely prudent (dare we say, conservative?)
business.

  Further, the authorities clearly have security concerns (post-FFW)
that affect their willingness to see such a system installed too
soon. Imperial permission (and possibly capitalization) would also
be needed to install the huge d-tank support infrastructure.

  Once the Rebellion occurs, and the entire Imperium becomes a hunting
ground for commerce raiders, then developing such a system would be
suicidal. Not only would the resources be needed elsewhere, but the
system would not work. Any elements of such a system that were in place
in 1116 would be the first things to collapse.

  In the question of switch-over times there also arises the issue
of converting all those ships that have internal tanks, and how
efficient, safe, or functional all those conversions will be if
not carefully considered.

Full Thrust is a starship miniatures combat tabletop game.

  Luckily a lot of the technical issues are fairly simple, including
the economic number crunching, at least in isolation. It\'s the socio-
political and background history implications that have to be decided
by designers (or individual referees) fiat.

  To be honest, professional writers have advantages and
disadvantages. Knowledge, experience, and authority are
the pro\'s, the big con is time/financial pressures. One
guy I know put many hundreds of hours into a micro-armour
simulation as a hobby; very few game companies have the
luxury of open-ended design schedules for either salaried
or outsourced personnel.

  Patience, care, and exposure to rational critical analysis
can go a long way.

  Assessing the skills available is difficult, but the TML
self-evidently represents a lot of spare time :)

Such a table exists in the MegaTraveller material concerning starship
operations. It would be useful if this could be reprinted in an actualized
form. I think it was in the Referee\'s Companion

I can\'t stand the strain anymore. I have to tell *someone*.

The Truth is that the Empress Wave is an adverstising campaign for a

Alas, to do this, you have to be able to *control* the stuff. And it\'s
the blasts while you are learning that mess up the neighborhood. And
thus they\'d rather do without and keep things fairly intact.

I was thinking that some systems had ones strong enough that they
almost act like a continuous series of low-level flares. "Strong" in

I think it\'s a matter of *volume*. With 20 you have twice the volume of

It\'s life support. Areas with no people in them don\'t need to be kept
under the sort of strict temperature controls that the living areas
have. Also, each passenger *adds* to the heat load the cooling system
for the living quarters has to deal with. 

A human just *sitting* there is a 100 watt heat source. One who is
doing something active could run a kilowatt. Maybe more. The more
people running around, the more the life support gear has to mess with
airflows to keep the air temps comfortable. Ever been in a long meeting
in a small, crowded room? The place quickly becomes unbearably hot.

Depends on how you do it. Cartridges for a week are apt to cost more
than that. And methods that *don\'t* use "consumables" are apt to be
more expensive. But the fact that you can use them when there\'s a
misjump and you are stuck in jump for *four* weeks instead of one may
make them worth it to ship owners.

Personally, I wouldn\'t have chemical cartridge type purification on a
jump capable ship or even on any sort of long duration craft. They are
ok for shuttles and the like because they won\'t be in use more than a
few days at a time.

The problem isn\'t *physical* damage. It\'s the *high* levels of
radiation. High speed protons mostly. Sort of like the radiation

Flares correlate to *some* extent with sunspots. But the sunspot cycles
take decades of observation to figure out because they are that long.
Sol\'s main cycle is 22 years, though the two halves of the cycle are
similar enough that you can refer to an 11 year cycle.

The idea is that when you first arrive, you don\'t know if this is the
"light" part of the cycle or the "heavy" part. Imagine the "fun" if you
assume that the high number of flares means that you are in the "heavy"
part of the cycle, and then as the years go by, you discovere that it
was the *light* part, and you are getting flares far stronger and far
more often than you designed space facilities to handle. Oops.

Stars are *different*.

Trouble is, you are looking for stuff that\'s mostly "dust" and "grains
of sand". That\'s not easy to detect at long range.

Once you\'ve got a path for the comet, you\'ve got an area to search. You
might even send out ships to take samples in various parts of the
orbit. 

But a typical cometary orbit has a period of *centuries*. Halley\'s
comet with it\'s 75 year period is actually a *short* period comet. 

How well you can determine the comet\'s orbit determines how well you
can determine where the meteoroids derived from it will be. And thus,
how well you can tell if your ship\'s trajectory crosses the "stream" or
if the stream crosses a planet\'s orbit while the planet is there.

But good orbits require good observations. And worse yet, comets
*change* their orbits due to outgassing. So you can never be sure if
there\'s stuff in the *old* orbit, or stuff from a comet you haven\'t
seen yet (and won\'t for 5000 years!).

For the small stuff, it\'s pretty hard to detect. But it\'s still big
enough to be a pain. Check Bruce\'s sensor rules to figure out how far
away you can detect a rough surfaced, almost black "marble". And then
realize that while these are rare, they are enough to mess a ship up
nicely. 

And you *will* have flare warnings if you have a fairly cheap set of
satellites watching the star. It\'s just that until you have a long
enough baseline of observations, you can\'t predict in advance when
there will be lots of flares and when things will be quiet.

To go down far enough that there\'s significant hydrogen to scoop mean
that you *are* travelling through something thick enough for
streamlining to matter. If you weren\'t, the scoops couldn\'t pick up
anything. 

And your velocity is going to be around 100 km/sec or better (I don\'t
have time to figure Jupiter\'s orbital velocity at the top of the
atmosphere, but it\'s likely *higher* than that).

A gas gaint has a gravity well that extends *way* out. And I don\'t buy
"floating" at the lower altitudes where the atmosphere is as denses as
"normal" atmosphere, much less deeper. The weather would be worse than
any hurricane on earth.

It gets kinda weird. You see, once you hit jupiter\'s size, planets
can\'t get much bigger. They have enough pressure at the core for the
electron shells of atoms to collapse, giving you degenerate matter,
which packs a *lot* tighter. Bodies actually start getting *smaller*
until you get them big enough for fusion to start at the core. Then
they get bigger as radiation pressure counteracts the gravity. 

So the mass/diameter ratio isn\'t anything resembling a straight line.

But they don\'t accidentally screw with the background, because they as you
have stated really had no impact on it at all. Why was that? No supplement
has as I understand explained why they didn\'t have a bigger impact on the
Imperium than what they had. The fact that they were introduced, seen as
an improvment, but never went beyond that is to me a great chatch for an
adventure. Sorry, but to me the way you put forth your arguments it seems
like you want a universe were the background is a constant, never
changing. To me that is a dull universe to play in.

I agree, I had forgotten when they were introduced, missed with about a
decade :-) But we know that they were introduced, never had the ability to
change the universe around themself. Why? Things like this is what I want
in a background. It\'s inspires to great roleplaying IMO.

Let me refrace that. Put "stabel" in for "well defined" and youget my
meaning more precisly. The fact that a ship that uses drop tanks, without
large enough internal tanks for a new jump, is pretty much a sitting duck
in the system it jumps to means that the systems that has drop tank
facilities must be stable. Very stable. Since there is a significant lag
in time for news to spread, no corporation is going to risk multi-milloin
credit ships with having drop tank facilities in systems with unstable
economies, war strucken systems, and so on. You seem to accept the many
constants that are in the Traveller rule books. Fuelcost is nearly
constant, life support cost is constant, and so on. To me this is
unbeleavable. In two systems several parsec apart the fuel might vary with
several hundred or maybe thousand prosent.

I\'m not really sure what your saying here. What I mean is that drop tanks
are a new invention. I want to keep that. But why hasn\'t it changed the
workings on space travel in the published materials? So I posed some
reasons why non but the large traderoutes in stable parts of the Imperium
will use drop tanks. What is wrong with this line of thought?

I\'ve been in some Role-playing sessions with up to ten persons in one
room. Sounds familiar, does it? A little problem there: the owner of the
room is the master and afraid of insects coming into it, so the windows
are shut. But that\'s none against a overcrowded bus/tram in winter ...

Because we can now measure time so accurately that the irregularities
in the Earth\'s rotation were starting to cause problems. We\'ve had to
add 17 or 18 seconds to the clock since the mid 70s just to keep the
atomic clock time (1 day = 86400 seconds *exactly*) in synch with the
astronomical time (1 day = average time for Earth to rotate over the
year). That may not sound like much, but it\'s an error of *miles* in
navigation.

Eeek! I must be an astronomy junkie. I recocognize half of therm, and
could probably make a stab at naming them. (TAI, which I think is
another Atomic time?, ET = Ephemeris Time, UT0= probably earth\'s
rotation *not* corrected for something or other).

It\'s probably simpler than that. The bigger the reactor, the more
volume it has compared with surface area. If you have a reactor X on a
side (or X in diameter) and it has a surface area of Y and a volume of
Z, one that is *2X* will have a surface area of 4Y, but a volume of
*8Z*. So you have *half* as much sheilding per unit of volume (and
mass). 

Remember, a bigger reactor *doesn\'t* need thicker shielding. Or at
least, not so much thicker that it overrides the square-cube law.

UT = Universal Time
UTC (the C should properly be a subscript) = Coordinated Universal Time.

UT is based on the rotation of the earth. UTC has leap seconds added to
keep it in synch with atomic clock time (the Earth is slowing down).

For most purposes, they are both identical to GMT.

You know, David, I\'ve tried to restrain myself from escalating this out of
the friendly discussion category, but this and similar remarks are simply
too provoking. To have my own points dismissed by a general statement and
to have my requests for specific arguments dismissed with a mere repeat
of the same general statement is bad enough, but to have you claim that
you have, indeed, answered specifics, is just too much. So I\'m going to
say flat out that what you are saying is not true. If that upsets you,
the remedy is simple. Just provide a few quotes of specific examples you\'ve
provided of elements in previously published Traveller material that would
be invalidated by the existence of drop tanks[*] and I\'ll eat a large helping
of crow and apologize most humbly to you. Otherwise have the decency to
refrain from spouting similar... stuff... in the future. Put up or shut up.

And I have one where they do appear. So have at least one other on the list

checked my own copy).

Of course, if they do, indeed, cause trouble (as you know I don\'t agree
with that, but I\'m willing to assume it for purposes of this argument),
the only reason they do is that they were ignored while the history of the
Imperium was being developed. If they had been remembered, that history
would have reflected their existence and they would have fitted right into
the background. So they weren\'t a bad idea when they were dropped, just an
idea.

(Why do I get that strange sense of deja vu? I know, it\'s because I really
have seen it before....) David, do you ever really read what your opponents
write? I\'ve stated that several times. I\'ll repeat it just in case you\'ll
deign to actually read it this time: The setup of a society that use drop
tanks will differ in some ways from a society that don\'t. (This is really
so self-evident that I shouldn\'t have to point it out repeatedly). That\'s
not and never have been what I\'ve argued. What I\'ve argued is that such
changes won\'t invalidate much, if anything, of what has been published
_until now_.

>You have also based this on the unsupportable 

claim?

>(by your own admission) that you will be able to see all the ramifications.

I\'ve never claimed that, nor seen the need to claim that. The only claim
I\'ve made, and the only one I feel is needed to justify my position is
that as far as anyone can see right now, it won\'t invalidate any previously
published material.

>Your claims have done nothing to address the fundamental point that a
>change of the magnitude to the basis for economy and social and politcal
>interaction can\'t help but fundamentally change society.

That\'s propably because I more or less started out demonstrating that it
propably would change core societies significantly (though I must say
that I consider \'fundamentally\' too strong a word to use without backing
it up with specific examples). I usually don\'t go around trying to
refute things I\'ve stated myself. I also claimed that that it is completely
irrelevant since none of those core societies have been portrayed so far
in such details that it can be proved that they didn\'t use drop tanks
to some extent. (That some of those systems have been summarily described
without any mention of drop tanks is not enough to show that drop tanks
are not present; at least not unless you\'re prepared to shred a lot of
other material on the same grounds (I can give you a number of examples of
elements in the Traveller background that should logically have been at
least mentioned in an earlier publication, but wasn\'t)).

Nobody likes that sort of thing, and that\'s one reason why I haven\'t done
it before, but there is a limit. You\'re a great one for moral relativity,
but the cases are not equivalent, any more than the ostensibly equally
great degree of pigheadedness on the part of a Flat Earther and a Round
Earther. You forget one crucial difference: is it true or not? Fortunately
in our case it is easily settled. I claim you haven\'t provided specific
examples of parts of the previously established Traveller canon that will
be invalidated if drop tanks are retained. You claim you have. Fine.
Provide a few quotes and I\'ll apologize. I\'m not too proud to admit it
whem I\'m proved wrong. BTW. just as a matter of curiosity, have you ever
been wrong? I mean, have you ever changed your mind as a result of an
argument with someone else on the net? If the answer to that question is
"No" or "Hardly ever", then you should take a few minutes to ponder if
that shouldn\'t tell you something.

At least I have a basis for my assertation. I have run several Traveller
campaigns and, believe me, to players adventuring in the parts of the
spinward Marches where my campains have been set (and where a number of
Traveller adventures have been set), the risk of meeting a commerce
raider in the next system is of far more importance than the fact that
the cost of travelling from Rhylanor to Mora may be 25% of what it would
otherwise be.

No! I most certainly _don\'t_ want you to reiterate your arguments! I grew
tired of them after the first couple of reiterations. I want you to
provide _evidence_ for your arguments. You do know the difference between
arguments and evidence, don\'t you?

I guess that if you had just stuck to repeating your arguments interminable
without providing any supporting evidence, then I\'d just have let it slide
as so often before. But when you add insult to injury by claiming that you
had, in fact, provided evidence... well, I guess you\'re 100% right. I\'m not
willing to just let that slide. Now I have slammed you. That is an odious
thing to do UNLESS the slam happens to be true. So go ahead. Prove me
wrong and I\'ll apologize.

I gave you a list of specific features that would change drastically in the
average CT campaign once the Rebellion broke out (Which, btw. you ignored).
So, once again you are stating an untruth. I may also have split hairs and
ridiculed you (if pointing out that an argument is ridiculous is ridiculing,
then I guess I did), but it is demonstrably not the only thing I did.

To give an example of what would have been a proper way to dispute that,
you could either have taken the list and argued that those features
wouldn\'t necessarily have to change or you could have provided a list
of specific changes that the average CT campaign would inevitably run
into once drop tanks became an integral part of Imperial society and
argue that those changes were greater than my changes. Since you hadn\'t
refuted my arguments, I chose to take that point as given. You chose
to refute it by a bald assertation. That is not an impressive way to
argue.

I agree with Leonard that if you consider a ship to be physically scooping
hydrogen (or water) then either the velocity of the ship must be so low
that it will be very difficult to escape back into orbit, or the hull must
be hypersonically streamlined to prevent hideous drag, or your ship hits
the atmospheric layer like it was a brick wall and pieces start to shear
off and (eventually) the hull breaks up.

Think of it as an airplane hitting water; no matter how carefully the pilot
angles into the sea s/he is going to end up cartwheeling or tearing off the
landing gear, wings, etc and at least damaging the fuselage and surface
gear.  Now a flying boat doing the same operation is properly "streamlined"
for the thicker medium and can therefore safely land (not a perfect
analogy, but adequate).  Note that in either case a dramatic decrease in
speed is necessary.

That said, is there any denial in FF&S of the possibility of fuel scoops
including electromagnetic field effects to collect ionized hydrogen from
much thinner layers of atmosphere (i.e. further out and allowing higher
safe streamlined (not hypersonically) passes)?

In the MT ship design system scoops require no energy, and I would take
that to mean there is no EM field.  Do scoops in FF&S or FF&S2 require
energy (I haven\'t used FF&S enough and havent rec\'d FF&S2 yet)?

I believe this concept is akin to that of the Bussard Ram Scoop which would
collect its fuel as it travelled between the stars, picking up the random
hydrogen molecule.  Of course, the size of the "scoop" need not be nearly
as large since densities even in the very upper atmosphere of a GG are
orders of magnitude bigger.

I have yet to decide if IMTU this is the case (it isn\'t yet relevant).  It
seems like there could be unforseen circumstances or implications.  The EM
field need not be partucularly strong to collect individual ions at a
pretty good clip, but it needs to be cast pretty wide.  Similar technology
(I think) could be used to collect sensor data as well.

Corrections and comments welcome as always.

From "Broadsword" which was a LBB Adventure (number escapes me);

Modules could be swapped in open space in an hour.  Crew rewquired is unknown.

Modules are truly swappable; Broadsword carried four modules and two cutter
"frames".

A module is 30 displacement tons.

Under MT (since I don\'t have the MT Imp. Encyclopedia here) I can easily
design a 50ton TL15 boat with 30 tons of "cargo" to represent the module.

Designing modules is interesting; they must have their own internal power
and (if needed) environmentals, so are basically ships without drives.

The modules in the adventure included; an ATV Module (carried one wheeled
ATV), a cargo module, a passenger module, a fuel module, an assault module
(this was interesting; articulated outer hull would dig up a "quickie"
foxhole for the troops it carried to deploy into - which I though was
probably absolutely useless on a TL 11+ battlefield), a fuel module, a
weapons module (one laser turret?), and a fighter module (four fighters @ 6
tons each I think).

I though a combination passenger/freight module would be more practical.
Broadsword needed one fuel module to refuel (although a cargo module with
collapsable tanks would do as well-the scoops were built into the
drive/bridge portion of the cutter).

Alltogether an interesting design, and similar to the "Eagle" from
Space:1999 in concept.  I do not remember if it was explicitly stated
whether the cutter could operate without the module and what that would do
to its performance.

Yes, a wonderful and flexible design concept.

Without the module, the Cutter acts as a 20 dt craft with 6G maneuver
capability. Streamlining of the module-less frame wasn\'t referred to,
but from the drawings it looks like it would drop from streamlined to 
unstreamlined - the cutter was unstreamlined while using the fighter 
frame.

I thought up a larger scout cruiser that had four modular cutters and
a module carousel in the center - kind of like the cylinder on a revolver.
It allowed for swapping modules inside a hangar, instead of having to
park a module in open space while you went in and got the one you
wanted, but at the cost of having one or two empty module hangars
to swap modules into.

Now that we know that Jupiter (and supposedly other gas giants) have

The definitions are somewhat different than old-fashioned Greenwich time
which is defined by the rotation of the Earth and hence wanders back and 
(mostly) forward as the Earth\'s rotation (mostly) slows. UT0 is the 
time as measured by the rotation of the Earth at greenwhich (similar to 
GMT but without the averaging that made GMT "mean".) UT1 is 
time as measured by the rotation of the Earth at your particular location
(offset back to Greenich\'s time zone); it varies from UT1 due to the 
non-roundness of the Earth. UTC is time kept by atomic clocks; it advances
due to the slowing of the Earth\'s rotation but only by integer seconds
("leap seconds"), as opposed to UT0 or GMT, which sort of slid forward
continuously as the Earth slowed. 

The distinctions may sound trivial, but at a leap second every few years they
add up for navigational purposes - or astronomical purposes; I have to worry
about things like whether a calculated time for an eclipse of Io is 
in UTC or some other non-sliding timescale like TDT. I think the official
changeover happened when the most accurate timekeeping changed from 
stellar observations to atomic clocks.

Basic Training at Ft. Benning GA.  We\'d shove forty infantry into a trailer
(we called it a cattle car) that was about 30ft long by 10ft wide.  This
was with weapons, rucksacks, etc..  made for a practical experiment in

TAI is international atomic time, which doesn\'t slide forward as the
Earth\'s rotation slows (so it\'s now about 30 seconds ahead of UT/GMT).
ET is old-fashioned ephemeris time for observing things with. TDT
(Terrestrial Dynamical Time) is its modern successor, defined by a fixed
offset from TAI of 32.184 seconds (don\'t ask why.) UT0 is time-measured-from-the
stars at your location instantaneously (uncorrected for things like 
pole wander); UT1 is time-measured-from-the-stars/earth\'s rotation corrected
for observer\'s location and pole motion. (I may have got these mixed up in
earlier posts.) TCG and TCB include general relativistic corrections, with
their origins at the center of mass of the earth and of the solar system
respectively. (GR corrections start to matter for things like GPS satellites...)
They haven\'t been officially adopted yet, though. Thank god there are 
computer programs to understand all these things for me...

It\'s pretty straightforward. If you do it in gravity it requires handling
equipment of some sort (or enough room to fly the cutter over and lower it
down on the module) but it\'s otherwise an easy process; the modules are
completely replaceable (which is the point, after all.)

I was wondering if anyone has ever thought of doing the 4th Imperium
milieu?

The tech level would be high:

	starship-sized matter portals are (recently?) feasible;
	jump drives are smaller and may use less fuel;
	small jumpships are common, though expensive;
	stepping discs have replaced grav vehicles for surface
		transport on modernized worlds;
	research into building rosettes is being pursued earnestly or done;
	world terraforming (for rich systems only) proves a
		great way to ship out a waterworld\'s excessive ocean;
	intrigue and bloodshed are common as systems swallow up
		the administration of lesser systems (if transport
		is nearly immediate).

The 4I would look quite a bit different than the 3I -- as different
as the 3I looked to the RoM as to the 1I.

Perhaps ship-sized matter portals would be constrained in the same
way the jump drive is constrained: portals range from 1 to N parsecs,
with one week travel time between points.  Portal range would have a
ceiling based on the current TL -- would it behave like a jump
projector with a focusing element?  OTOH, portals may be something
else entirely, more like the teleportation discs found at Twilight\'s
Peak: nearly instantaneous transportation, with the attendant administrative
implications.

What years would the 4I range over?  3I 2000+?  3I 3000+?

From 3I years 0 to 1100 the TL went from 12 to 15.  The Long Night
reduced the TL from 13 or 14 down to 12.  MT showed many major worlds
at TL16; did TNE surpass this in any significant amount?

If TL16 was held onto, and even TL17 by advanced groups (Darrians),
then perhaps after 1000 years the TL could be as high as the low 20\'s.

Anyone have opinions on this?

Hmm..I always thought skimming was performed by diving at the

easy to find/target any skimming star/spaceships.

Arrrrggghhhhhh NO! NOT THE UNSTREAMLINED SHIPS IN AN ATMOSPHERE ARGUMENT!!
NOT AGAIN!!!! :-)

Because, Air/rafts, as usually pictured, even though they are open topped,
are typically streamlined. Any vehicle meant to operate in an atmosphere
will be at least somewhat aerodynamic...It may have the aerodynamic
properties of a brick, or an f-104 fighter (much the same thing, though
the F-104 is a bit pointier) and depend on raw thrust to get where it\'s
going, but it is <quote> streamlined <endquote> by the rules of the game.

An open air/raft will have one bitchkitty of a ride when it gets up to the
jetstream, and pray you don\'t hit any clear air turbulence, or a
thunderstorm, or an updraft over a mountain, or any number of the other
nice things our atmosphere can do to man-made things flying around in it.

IMTU, an air/raft CAN reach orbital altitude in theory, but only the most
desperate will actually try this.
 
Unstreamlined, or Open Frame spacecraft are typically that way because
they take advantage of the ability to stick things all over without regard
to how they behave in an atmosphere.

In a GG, if you drift in slowly, you\'re still subject to the local
weather. For an example of such weather take a look at Jupiter. That big
red thing there...that\'s a hurricane that\'s been going for centuries, at
least, with winds of around 180 miles per hour.

For an example of what _happens_ to unstreamlined vehicles in such wids I
refer you to The Weather Channel, where they typically show bits of
hurricanes blowing stuff all to hell fairly frequently.

Even minor crosswinds can wreak havoc on even perfectly drifting objects
(theoretically at rest with respect to the local wind) look what happens
to hot air baloons when they get into sticky weather.

That\'s why unstreamlined starships can\'t enter atmospheres.

I don\'t believe you are correct (but I may be wrong)... you directly remove
the kinetic energy and convert it to electrical energy. The spin section
slows down as a result. Transfer losses are in heat in the system
converting (the generator). You are effectively removing the \'v\' from the
mv of the momentum.

We used to stop flywheels from 50k rpm at work by driving them like this.
They had pretty insignificant friction and operated in a vacuum. I suppose
there was a low <2 Nm torque acting in this case, but you could balance
this out with judicious use of thrusters. Looking back, I suppose that
means I agree with you ;-)

It\'s in the early, early version of Book 2, in the section on consumables
and custom missiles.  As I recall, it states that the referee may make 
available alternative missile designs besides homing nukes, such as mines,
controlled missiles, and jump torpedoes.  No rules or guidelines for the
actual devices are included, those being the days when as Dave Arneson 
once said, "there were no rules, only a referee with a whip and a chair".

Not all versions of CT are created equal.  The black books I have give
the scale for miniature-based space combat at 1" == 1000 miles!  Later
editions of Book 2, thankfully, went metric, but too late for the world
UWP system in Book 3....  

Personally, I\'ll admit I don\'t mind either jump torpedoes or drop tanks.
I agree with Hans that by all indications, commercial drop tank operation
is only going on in the deep interior of the Imperium, and frankly, we
didn\'t see much of that in peacetime.  By MegaTraveller (1118+), the 
Rebellion has progressed far enough that any traffic of that sort that
still existed would be deep in the Safes, and players (on the frontier
or front lines) would still see mostly old-fashioned non-drop tank 
traffic.  Jump torpedoes might work; they could be unreliable, or more
expensive to operate (no engineer to babysit it in jump), or just not
able to carry enough data (such as pseudoreality commo).  If you don\'t
like \'em, don\'t use \'em.

I rather suspect by the time we\'ve had 3000 years to do astronomy with a
sample size in the thousands, we\'ll be a _bit_ better at figuring these
things out that we are with less than a hundred years of decent
observations and an N of one.

we might even know what _does_ accurately predict flares...other than a
bunch of Darrians huddled around that big, weird looking machine over
there...

give it a horrible acronym, too, like UHaIaH2BaGR (Useful
Hints and Ideas about How to Be a Good Referee).

The group has found themselves on a dead world, the product
of a major planetary war.  They are in a mostly dead subsector,
two subsectors Spinward of the 3I.  I am not using canonical
starcharts for these subsectors.

On several systems are the equivalent of berserkers, complete
with factories, scouts, and behemoth destroyers.  In the
adjacent subsector lies starfaring human colonies, with fair
interstellar tech in clusters of confederations.

Our heroes must pass through the berserker subsector, then 
through the civilized subsector, in an old, crippled but high-TL
ship in orbit around the world they\'re on.  They must evade
destroyers, aid humans, and struggle through they subsectors
to re-enter the Imperium.  They will re-enter the Imperium
via Chamax and probably the Darrian Confederation.

1) Should the volume of space be narrowed?
   One subsector only?
   Half of a subsector?

2) What patrons may they meet?  What major NPCs?

3) What tasks may they be able to perform to help themselves
   get back to civilization?

4) What things may they find?

5) What situations might they get themselves into?

6) What situations might they find themselves thrust into?

7) How do I get a lot of interesting play out of each world
   they visit?

8) What is a good way to detail worlds?  Not topography, but
   adventure-related, tangible things.  And they don\'t need
   additional dead races, I\'ve got plenty of them already.

Any suggestions at all would be helpful.  Thanks in advance.

You would get a biplane that Baron Von Richthoven would give one or _two_
gonads to possess, one that _might_ stand it\'s own against WWII
fighters, if it could jump on them low and slow, but would be vapor if it
ran up against your average TL-15 hypersonic stealthed laser and missle
armed fighter.

You\'re talking, roughly, about a high tech design in much the same way a
Stimson biplane is today, a TL-8 rendition of a TL-5 craft, with higher
performance and durablility, but not radically altered flight
characteristics...an open cockpit biplane ain\'t gonna do supersonic, or
even much above a couple of hundred miles/hour.

OTOH, your TL-15 fighter\'s gonna have a hard time engaging the TL-6
aircraft, too. There is an old SF short story, "Hawk among Sparrows",
whose author escapes me right now(James Blish? Dean....something? comes
vaguely to mind), about a supersonic fighter somehow
transported back in time to WWI, where the pilot promptly tells the allies
that he\'ll take out Richthoven and his flying circus.

Only there isn\'t enough metal in the planes of the day for his radar
guided missles to lock on, and they don\'t have that lovely 1000 degree jet
exhaust for his heat seekers to find. 

A classic time travel story.

I think when you get to these \'ranks\' the reason for not having them on the
promotions/ranks list is that these are ranks depend on a great deal of political
power and promotion to them will not be through standard military process.  Thus,
PCs shouldn\'t be able to attain these ranks in chargen.  For NPCs, IMHO, you
should just fiat the rank desired.

Yah and if I remember correctly( it was published in ANALOG?) the pilot had to find
them visually and fly thru them at supersonic speed to knock them out of the air.

I agree with the points about entering a gas giant storm or even a
storm on an Earth-like planet.  This last sentence, I don\'t necessarily
agree with.

Unstreamlined ships will certainly have problems with high-speed
maneuvering (mostly if they are asymetrical) but wouldn\'t have any
problems with low speed maneuvers.  CG equipped ships should have the
easist time floating around.  They might have problems with nasty
weather, but are generally going to be quite a bit tougher than hot
air balloons and have significantly more maneuvering capability than
most hot air balloons.  The above is mainly going to apply to ships
with significant amounts of thrust (well over 1 G or local gravity
and/or CG).

Going to or from orbit in such a ship will take quite a while as the
ship will be limited in speed, but should be quite possible.
Again, avoid hurricants and thunderstorms and the like but turbulence
won\'t affect such a ship any more than any other (aerodynamic ships
are affected by turbulence and hurricanes, look at what happens to
airplanes that fly into hurricanes or bad turbulence).  In fact, a
slow moving ship may have an easier time of it simply because it\'s
slow moving.

He does find, though, that jetwash blows the relatively flimsy planes
into bits of wood and canvas.  :)

I wish I remembered the title and author, too... a very good story.

because I finally realized I really, really, really hated the New Era
setting. It never amounted to much, because I ended up moving, but I liked
it.

In my version though, it wasn\'t a 4th Imperium, it was a Republic. And in
fact, it was made up of virtually all the various empires - the Imperium,
Solomani, Zhodani, even parts of Vargr, K\'kree and Aslan space. (No hivers
- - IMTU, someone created a virus to kill them off - and their various
subject races took over their space). 

Most of the adventures in the game came from exploring new space and
recontacting planets on the fringes of known space. 

The average tech level was still pretty low, but several planets had
reached TL 17 and 18 (and in once case, 19), so you started to see some
exotic gizmos.  There were also quite a few sentient robots and talking
toasters and the like (a less homicidal virus strain was developed).  

All in all, it was pretty much an extrapolation of what I thought Traveller
was heading towards when it sputtered out - (ie, The Regency was fairly
democratic, the Zhodani were being nice, some of the Virus was being nice,
everyone was getting sick of the Hivers, humans were getting tired of
fighting each other, etc)

Anyway, no it wasn\'t exactly like the Traveller as we know it, but then
again , neither was Milieu 0 (IMHO) nor was T:TNE (compared to CT & MT),

  You may be mistaking one of Hans pro-drop-tank posts for one of
my anti-drop-tank related posts. But I never claimed to be able to
foresee all the ramifications of a change either; in fact, I specified
the inability to do so.

It will depend.  First on who close to your intended point
you come in.  (if ships are coming a day later or earlier
than intended, they may be scattered significantly away
from the intended point).  It also depends on how good
a job the imperium does of protecting the points.  If
they try and cut corners and stick a small SDB or armed
scout ship to protect it, then someone may be some
ships together to raid it.

I would think they would just pretend to be the legit
operators.  (They have all the ships documents).

Groovy.  We have a Spooky Setting.  This can be milked for lots of theater.

And now we have an Evil Impersonal Enemy.  Do not let the enemy be defeated
too soon, but do allow regular victories, as long as they perform sensible
actions, like running when things are not good.

And finally, the Great Escape.

These are the elements that have made up some of my more fun campaigns.

>1) Should the volume of space be narrowed?
>   One subsector only?
>   Half of a subsector?

Keep it small!  Remember, unless you go hog wild detailing things, or
setting the course very explicitly, you will need a LOT of information
about each one.  If you have a full sector or even a full subsector, you
are letting yourself in for a lot of world design work.

My suggestion (and bear in mind that it is only a suggestion) is to plot
the adventure like a book:

Make a list of overall plot elements.  For example, my current game:
1.  Introduction
2.  The Briefing by Mr. Shoes
3.  The Setup, wherein the sides are declared
4.  The Investigation, where they find out the Real Story
5.  The Setback, wherein the Villains cause trouble for the heroes
6a. The Going to Ground where they sneak past the bad guys
or
6b. The Making a Bold Stand
7.  The Escape
8.  The Gathering of Good Guys
9.  The Bringing to Justice.

Each of these elements usually happens in a dramatically different scene,
though important people will drift from one to another.  The Escape, for
example, was when they crept away from the bad guys on a mining moon, and
fled off planet.


The Gathering was when they convinced a rather unfriendly Ministry of
Justice commander to come back with them, along with a few handy Marines.
Had they not done the Escape correctly, the Villains would have applied
pressure, making official help almost impossible to find.

>2) What patrons may they meet?  What major NPCs?

Each scene should have a couple of named people, not all of which are
important.  I usually shoot for three or four at least, so that it is not
obvious who the really important people are.  I also rarely have people who
are entirely helpful or harmful.  For example, in the last session, my
players happened to ask a person with a grudge against a major bad guy for
help, and got a near complete explanation for a major section of unknown
details.  They do not yet believe these facts, and verifying them will be
quite dangerous, but the encounter was quite lucky.

In essence, remember that unless they have a high profile, they are not
likely to gather a lot of official interest, thus most encounters should
not move the plot along.  Most scenes, on the other hand, should.  To cover
this, I usually have them beg, buy, or steal some research, and then have
the research produce useful information.  As a result, even if they are
talking to someone who will not advance the plot directly, they may well
choose to involve this otherwise unrelated person.

For example, in one game, they befriended an out of work engineer, who
later on was quite useful when they needed some background information on
an alien weapons system.

>3) What tasks may they be able to perform to help themselves

>   get back to civilization?

Repair tasks are big, as are spook tasks.  Research into who the enemy is
are also pretty handy.

>4) What things may they find?

Lots of gimmicks, and lots of experiences.  Work hard to make each scene,
and thus each planet or location on each planet, different enough to
remember.  Also, try to make the individual people memorable.

>5) What situations might they get themselves into?

Look for conflicts in the situation.  It is usually from conflict that
interesting events happen.  For example, if they are in a broken down, high
tech ship, a number of worlds are going to want to take it off their hands
to take it apart.  The players might protest, but might also need the help
of the people who want their ship.

>6) What situations might they find themselves thrust into?

Try to avoid putting them in situations where self interest is completely
opposed to the plan you have for a scenario.  Some self interest <-> good
nature conflicts are good, but if it becomes too extreme, players rebel.
For example, in The Long Way Home, it was clear to the players that they
should act as do gooders on all sorts of planets.  The players, on the
other hand, had little reason to want to do this - they were a LONG way
from home, and thought getting involved in petty planetary disputes a
really bad idea.

>7) How do I get a lot of interesting play out of each world
>   they visit?

Make them interesting.  Buy a tour book for a place you have never been,
and then see what the natives think about it.  Map it upwards for a whole
planet.

Consider - except for good science bits, the real interesting thing is the
people.  A good way to get some ideas is to pick up a large survey book,
and open at random.  Whichever culture you hit is likely a good source for
ideas.  The players had a great time when Belisarius (renamed to Ishiiki
Verdun, the Vliani halfbreed) showed up, and used them as a bunch of
couriers.  He had the guns, and then the money, and then the loyalty to
keep them going all sorts of places, and his descriptions of the vile,
corrupt court had them annoyed and morally indignant on a regular basis.

A final note - my current episode has taken place on Sylea (TAS, the
Palace, the Moot, the Cafe, the Embassy to Amur Isark, and numerous
ballrooms and hotels), Amur Isark (the City, the Underground Home of the
Archons, the Wilderness, the Forest, and numerous rugged outdoorsy spots),
fours ships (a merchant, a courier, and two cruisers), and will soon go to
the Queendom homeworld.  This last may be interrupted, if the players
decide to try to hook up with the Amazing High Tech Alien (Darrian, in this
case) Conspiracy.

The game has run for a good six or eight months, and probably has another
couple of months before they have to make a final decision about whether
energy being is on their things to be list.

What has kept it interesting has been the large number (>200) characters I
have created.  Many of them were walk ons with just a name or a job, but
they all had a name and a one sentence description, which made the players
want to know what happens.  Sylea, in this episode, is inhabited by a lot
of people that they know, and they are interested in what happens to them.

    'body' => 'Hi folks. I\'ve been screwing around with the idea of creating some
new rules for fusion-powered maneuver drives, and as I was running
the numbers, I came across some conclusions that are so totally
opposite my preconceptions that I thought I\'d pick your brains to
find out what I\'m doing wrong. Keep in mind when you\'re going over
this that I\'m probably the last person on this list who would ever
start a gearhead discussion. My familiarity with physics amounts to
a few brief articles in some 30-year-old encyclopedias weighing
down my bookshelf. I\'ve never taken a class in the stuff, not even
in highschool, so you can safely assume that the following material
is error-infested. So much for my general disclaimer. Now here we
go...

I started with the idea of typical solar fusion:

protium + protium => deuterium
protium + deuterium => helium-1
helium-1 + helium-1 => helium-2 + 2 protiums

So, in total, 4 protiums (hydrogen-1) are converted to 1 helium-2
4 protiums weigh in at 4.03188 amu
The helium-2 weighs in at 4.0026 amu
So we\'ve got a mass loss of .72%

This was a tad higher than what I anticipated, but no biggie.

I went on to assume that the formula for fusion-powered energy
conversion is:

e=mc^2

where e is the energy in joules,
m is the conversion mass in kilograms
   (that .72% of the reaction mass), and
c is the speed of light in meters per second.

I don\'t know why this should be the case, but it\'s what I read
somewhere. Even assuming the equation is correct for this purpose,
I\'m still concerned about my units, so somebody please check them
out. I\'m no expert.

Onward and forward... if this is all correct so far, then fusing
one gram of protium results in:

m = .001 * .0072
c = 299,792,000
e = mc^ = 647,101,700,000 joules

The next question was how to convert this to accelleration,
assuming that the 99.28% of the reaction mass, now in the form of
helium-2, could be shoved out the back side of our make-believe
starship. Again, I\'m uncertain about my formula as well as my
units, so please correct me, but my assumption was that:

1 joule = .74 poundals
        = .74 feet/sec delta for 1 pound in 1 second
        = .74 * .3048 m/sec delta for .4536 kg in 1 second
        = .2256 m/sec delta for .4536 kg in 1 second
        = .1023 m/sec delta for 1 kg in 1 second

Or to state this another way, you get .1023 m/s/s accelleration for
1 second if you apply 1 joule to 1 kilograms. The accelleration
increases linearly with joules and decreases linearly with
kilograms. So, we can say:

a = .1023 j / m

where

a = accelleration in meters/sec (for one second)
j = joules
m = starship mass in kg

We can even reduce to this to gees of accelleration by simply
assuming 1 gee = 10 m/s/s so that

a = .01023 j / m

where

a = accelleration in gees (for one second)
j = joules
m = starship mass in kg

So let\'s say that the starship is about 1,000,000,000 kg. What
would this be in tons? A million or so? And we already know that if
they\'re burning 1 gram of protium per second, then they\'ve got
647,101,700,000 joules per second to work with.

a = .04972 (647,101,700,000) / (1,000,000,000) = 6.6 gees

We\'ll have to assume they\'ve got some inertial compensation
technology considering this level of accelleration. Ignoring
relativity for the moment, they should be doing lightspeed within
less than eleven days:

c = 299,792,000 m/s
1 gee = 10m/s/s, so 6.6 gees = 66m/s/s
So 299,792,000 / 66 = 4542303 seconds = 52.5 days

In that time that would burn off 4542 kg of protium, which is a
miniscule fraction of the total mass of the starship
(1,000,000,000kg). This is the result that I find the most
ludicrous. In all the hard science-fiction that I\'ve read it\'s
generally assumed that if you want to get near lightspeed (where
you can take advantage of time-dilation to shorten the perceived
duration of your journey), you\'ve either got to gather fuel as you
go (ala the Bussard fusion ramjet, Cosmos p205) or got to have some
humongous tank for your fuel, because you\'re going to need a lot of
it. Here, I\'m computing a ridiculously small fuel tank (in
comparison to the size of the overall vessel). Is this wrong or
what?

Now, accounting for relativity will change the results, but
probably not to the point that a "large" percentage of the ship
will need to be allocated to fuel. If I\'m not mistaken, under
relativity accelleration must be multiplied by (1-z^2)^(.5) where
z is the percentage of lightspeed (expressed as a number between 0
and 1) at which the starship is traveling at any given moment.

This brings up another question. Under newtonian mechanics, if we
assume 1 gee (10m/s/s) accelleration, then velocity equals the
integral of accelleration, and distance equals the integral of
velocity (since this is a text-only environment, I\'ll use the
notation I[x]dx to represent the integral of x).

So, to restate this:

if a = 10 then
v = I[10]dx = 10x
d = I[10x]dx = 10 (x^2/2) = 5x^2

where a=accelleration in meters/sec/sec, v=velocity in meters/sec,
d=distance in meters, and x=time in seconds since the start of
accelleration. Substituting in the relativistic equation of
accelleration, we get:

a=10(1-z^2)^(.5) where z=v/299792000
a=10(1-(v/299782000)^2)^(.5)
v=I[10(1-(v/299782000)^2)^(.5)]dx

At this point my math skills break down and I\'m not too sure how to
proceed. Anybody want to take over? The whole point of this is that
I\'d like a simple formula or procedure into which you can plug in
a newtonian value for accelleration (10 in this example) along with
x (time), and get relativistic values for v (velocity) and d
(distance).

You just defend the well defined supply routes (which is what you
would do drop tanks or no.)

The saving in cost would free up resources, at a minor investemnt
(remember, they were already invented, they just had to, at worst,
fix a few bugs.)

However, this all gets to be a minor point to me.  I don\'t think
this whole approach is a good way to go.  Introducing a new technology
then immediately hedge it in with restrictions and coincidences to
make sure it never was widely adopted (and you either need to 
refuse to advance the timeline, or keep up restrictions, etc.
to make sure the possible ramifications don\'t develop in the
future) is something I have always found to be a mistake.
It make the background hokey when players start poking holes
in your web of restrictions you have to pile more on, making
things worse.

Well, at this point, anything you can imagine that makes the Zhodani crazy, moves at
lightspeed rimward and will therefore also pass Imperial Space, with unknown effects,

Exactly.  By making the position of Sector Admiral an a ssaignment carrying
nominal command over the fleets of the sector, you allow the Duke to pick

You don\'t need to do this.  The micrometeors are strung out all along
the orbit of the comet (though there are periods if higher activity)
and you experience them, or not, based more on when the orbit of
the Earth (or your craft) crosses the orbit of the comet (anywhere
along it, and not too acurately.  The scatter of the meteors around
the orbit is going to greater than the uncertainty in the comets
orbit).  These are pretty easy to determine and if we had Travaller
sensors, all the ones that cross Earths orbit would have been done.

The meteor outbursts are going to be pretty predictable.

One of the core elements of Traveller is the use of feudalism, honor,
_noblesse_oblige_, and whatnot to manage an empire across a multi-year
communications lag.


Remember: the X-Boat network, for example, was set up at J-4 so that
local authorities could get early word (via Imperalines J-6 couriers

I\'m sorry Hans.  You are the one that started up with snide remarks, slams
on what I was saying, and general escalated the situations.  I have several
times tried to explain that I\'m not willing to play you little game 
in the hopes that it would be dropped.  This has only met more 
vigorous attacks.

Hogwash.  I responded when you first made the points.  Just
because I won\'t do it again the second or third time you make them
just means I won\'t beat a dead horse.  It is also hypocritical
because you deal in generalizations just as much as I do and
many of the theads were only dealing with generalization because
you yourself answered specific points with generalizations (I
have specifically pointed out places where a post that was 
attacked for being a generalization was in fact a response to
something just as general from you.)

I\'ve been in threads with you sever times where I answer a point,
then you, a gazillion posts later, repeat the same points (I don\'t know,
forgetting the original answers or just ignoring it) and go through
the same old stuff all over again (often simply assuming your side
has been "proven" because it wasn\'t mentioned recently).  I don\'t
have time for this.  I have a life.

Except I _never_ claimed that drop tanks invalidate existing material in

And if you can\'t even remember what I have posted, or perhaps been able

Commodore was once basically like your Fleet Captain rank - it was a
temporary rank given to captains in the RN to give them authority over
other captains (normally the more senior automatically had authority, no
matter what). IIRC that made it a flag rank, except that a commodore didn\'t
have a personal flag, so it wasn\'t really a real flag rank. In WWII it was
given to those in command of merchant convoys (probably one of the most
thankless tasks on the ocean).

Well FF&S1\'s alternate tech gives 1parsec telporters at TL21, and we know
that the ancients had teleporters, so they\'re not really alternate
technology. Thus FTL comms are no higher than TL-21.

I can see why it would matter. I had just assumed that they had changed the
way they measured GMT to using atomic clocks, etc.

According to the FF&S1 rules for modules that are in the _Reformation
Coalition Equipment Guide_ a module needs its own shell and internal
structure, and only needs its own life support, controls and AG units if it
uses more than 30% of the parent vessel\'s volume. Modules don\'t need their
own power if the parent vessel has enough surplus to power it, and can in
fact porvide power to the parent vessel if they have a power plant that
gives them a surplus.

The RCEG implies that the module is an integral part of the cutter, so it
would certainly become unstremlined, and I wouldn\'t want to accelerate to
hard.

The TNE-RCES list was disscussing this a couple of months ago. We are still
debating the effect of the Empress Wave on all this, along with a few
comments by Dave Nilsen when he made an appearance on the list. He said
something about \'wandering psionic knights\' and the effects of the EW
wearing off after 600 (I think) years. Some of us think that the Long Bow
project\'s experiments will have been made to work by then, giving psionic
based FTL comms. 

I think the Regency Sourcebook had a cap of TL16 put on by the Regency
government, but a number of planets are pushing that pretty hard, and will
go to TL17 very quickly once the limit is removed. It\'s quite a lot of fun
designing TL-16 ships with a good supply of good black globes, manipulators
and really efficient meson guns.

Just a little clarification on this six star stuff.  Washington wore two
stars by his own appointment.  He bought the rank because he could afford an
Army.  If you add up all the troops fighting in the entire American
Revolutionary War it would add up to a very small corps today.  He received
a third star in 1799 (I believe at his death) as an honorary rank.  Pershing
died as a four star (America\'s first four star, they had stopped at three
throughout all previous wars) and it was created for him in France in 1917.
He was the "Expeditionary Forces Commander in France and needed to be on
equal footing with Foch (later promoted to Field Marshal). The big hubbub
about six stars came about when GotA Omar Bradley (who died in 1981) brought
it to the attention of the president at a ceremony held for him in 1976
(America\'s 200th anniversary).  The story goes that Bradley had the utmost
respect for Pershing and had known him quite well.  He felt that Pershing
should be given the highest rank (honorary) ever held by an American.  It
moved thru congress and Washington\'s name was brought up.  Politicians being
what they are they thought it a grand idea so they promoted Washington and
Pershing to the honorary rank of six stars.  Till this day there isn\'t a set
of six stars to represent the rank and as far as I know there never was a
design for them.  You can check Army Regulation 670-1 (I believe, I retired
almost 9 years ago after all)  to see what the five stars look like but it
will be devoid of any representation of the six star emblem.  Read the story
in the Stars and Stripes, European edition, when I was stationed in Berlin.

  If these are capital intensive (or just plain expensive) stations,
then the operators will see to point defenses. Pirates "raiding"
one of these stations, unless somehow one is financed in the complete
boonies, is fantasy.

  If a ship misjumps substantially within the system, the pirates
are going to be a bit bummed, as the target is by definition in
the middle of nowhere wrt the rest of the system, and they can only
take the cargo, unless they happen to have a fuel tanker with them
(which seems drastically implausible).

  They have to tamper with all the ships documents while in
Jump; the crew and passenger lists will all have to be modified,
and they probably need to snuff the original crew (making for a
tough fight for the ship), as there\'s absolutely no reason not
to have an on-board customs/security inspection at a refuelling
station with which they will have to dock anyway. Anyone on board
who so much as bats an eyelash wrong and you get to chat with one
of Douglas\' boarding parties.

  They\'ll also have to have a ships crew snuck on board (because
the original crew will have been heaved out the lock) and there
will be no prospect (obviously) of picking one up before arriving
at the refuelling point.

  Given a jump to a security checkpoint, hijackers will have to
have substantial personnel in place with a wide, expert skill set
with casualty redundancy, and the need to either focus on tramp
freighters or become mass murderers. Actually, it sounds like the
major threat will come from PC groups :>

  IIRC, they were still being tested on small ships immediately before
the FFW, so around 1106-1107. The Rebellion started in 1116? Also, the
Ilelish admin wouldn\'t have bothered to start the system up. This is
clearly not decades, unless the commercial use of d-tanks started before
1100. Sadly, I don\'t have FFW anymore, or copies of the TNS to hand.

  Also, waiting a few (3-4?) years after the FFW to research safety
concerns leaves the system no doubt very poorly developed by 1116.

  If the raiders are unable to overwhelm the security, as is relevant
in the "Pirates Extinct?" question. If the "raider" is a battlefleet
that might traverse half a sector before being brought to battle (while
its own raiders hit sites stripped to concentrate for said battle) then
the system collapses completely across the affected (huge) area.

  If said battlefleet is victorious, then the commerce of the sector
can\'t even escape as Fleet Intruders skip ahead and cut links. The
war-supporting capacity of the sector is captured at a blow, unless
immediate and successful counter-attack is possible. Both NI and the
fleet command would blow a gasket on general principles.

  See above for the increased cost of failure. Tanker stations can\'t
be hardened vs. KKM\'s (even non-nagic drive ones). "Just defend" becomes
an extremely expensive issue in terms of warfighting ability. You might
recall your own arguments that the Imperium would be _unable_ to defend
its lines of communication in _peacetime_ using large but available
quantities of _small escorts_. While overblown IMO, you must now reverse
that argument to suggest that defending _all points_ of your LOC _at all
times_ in wartime from all directions is now a simple and easy task.

  A ship blew up for unknown reasons (and it might have been a
terrorist bomb) and that\'s a bug? Microsoft is a 3I megacorp?

  The short term size of the investment depends on the efficacy
of refits, which I\'ve already mentioned.

  It remains to Mr. Wiseman to determine this for us. If it is
a historical development in keeping with the designers view of
the Traveller universe (and I\'m not sure I\'d like that) then it
becomes something to critique, not to argue over.

Actually the late hour bit me Bruce, and I apologize. I wasn\'t actually
thinking of open frame designs (aka ST:Enterprise) when I wrote that. I was
thinking more along the lines of an AHL class ship SLOWLY cruising the outer
atmosphere of a GG as opposed to a March Harrier. (Bad examples maybe but I
hope you get the idea).

I think I\'m thinking more along the lines of areodynamic vs the "flying
brick" or better, the SR-71 of another thread vs the ST:Voyager. The Voyager
is not my concept of "hypersonic" streamlining, however I don\'t see why it
couldn\'t negotiate an atmosphere, at a slow enough speed. With CG, lift is
no longer needed so it would handle more like the Heindenburg, not the best
ride in bad weather, but capable none-the-less.

I guess the problem is I don\'t picture fuel skimming as a missle run through
atmosphere or water. I see it as more of a hover while pumps and compressors
do the work, with ship movement providing the feed to the compressor/pump
inlet scoops. I\'ve always believed that the actual skimming operation runs
parallel (time wise) with the purification. Ships scoops raw atmosphere
through compressors, atmosphere is processed through the purification plant
and is seperated by catalytic reaction, hydrogen is stored, "waste" elements
are dumped. Once the tanks are full the ship leaves the GG. Water fueling is
basically the same with oxygen being the "waste" material, except whats
pulled off for life support. Other liquid oceans would be much the same,
with other "wastes".

Unfortunately, if the deck plans follow the typical quality assosiated with
the (several) examples of GURPS deck plans I have available, I\'m not sure
how much use they will be. For a game system that is VERY well suited for
miniature play they seem very reluctant to place hex grids and scale to
their published maps.

Oh, well, we can hope.

I don\'t know about that.  The expense is unclear (and depends on
how far you take the development of the technology).  The defenses
will match the percieved need (and the iron is that as piracy
becomes rarer, the percieved need will drop) and will be subject
to the usual shortsightedness and profiteering that humankind is
prone to.  I doubt it will be common (there will be clear need
and it will be dealt with), but _never_ happen?  I\'m not so sure.

I\'m not talking about a misjump.  I\'m talking about the accuracy
to which you can place your exit point.  That could throw them
off so that they are only some distance away.

Depends on whether the Imperium bothers to list the crew and
passengers for every single jump and how much trouble they
go to do that.  You list could just be one that the captain
made up for his own reference.

> and they probably need to snuff the original crew (making for a

Or hide them away someplace, but that is always a problem in
highjacking.

Sure there is.  Cost.  Not everything that one can think of a reason
for will happen.  Now I\'m not saying it won\'t happen, but it will be
based on the perceive need vs the cost.  As above, as the event gets
rarer, the percieved need decreases.  That makes it hard to completely
eliminate anything.

I have absolutely no problem with "demountable" tanks.  However,
I would think the need to have jump projectors to extend the

Well, in fact I agree that is would make piracy harder.  In 
fact, if you read what I say, I claim it "might" not make
piracy extince (in certain circumstances).

Hardly, this fleet can catch trader regardless of the method.
The main difference is they know ahead of time where the
good pickings is, but you know ahead of time where they
have to attack.  It is a double edged sword.

So you have a system of stations that you can jump in to replace
them.  (In fact, you can also have them set up to jump out
if there is trouble).

Right, so what you do is use the fact that you know where they
commerce raider need to attack to have the fleet that you
have designated to defeat them waiting...

It was pretty clear to me that is was a bomb or something.
However, you could, I suppose, make it some bug that delayed
the technology to just before the rebellion, and then not
allowed it to develop in the rebelion.  But that gets back
to my remarks about careful contrivance.  But the, if it
is never developed, how do the PC\'s have it?  If it is,
then why isn\'t it being used the way it clear can be?

Okay, but I guess I was trying to say can it be done so as the locals
dont know you are using higher tech vehicles - I have some players
trying to sneak some advance vehicles onto a low tech world so as to
have an advantage... But how do I reflect this?Will the damage ratio of
the new TL15 "equivalent" of the TL6 vehicle withstand more damage as it
is made with stronger material?

But I guess what the players are asking is it able to pass for the TL6
vehicle at a glance over or even at a up touch and feel kind of thing -
but I know if somebody scrapped the paint off or tried to scratch it or
something it would be shown to be unusual to say the least...???

Well, it wasn\'t my idea at all.  I focus on milieu 0, so even laser
pistols are a novelty.  But if you\'re going to have matter-transmission
portals, of _any_ size, don\'t you get FTL communication point to point?

Regardless, to say that a Traveller universe has a Tech Level cap is a bit
ridiculous.  Sure, radical changes would result in a drastic effect on the
universe, but prefer to think of Traveller as more than just certain TLs,
etc.  Traveller has game systems, etc., that make it unique.  IMHO,
Traveller has a character to it regardless of the tech level and feudal
governments.

Perhaps we should establish a Church of Traveller Canon to properly
indoctrinate these innocents before the devil fills their minds with evil.
;-)

Really, though, I have some space available to host such stuff.  But I\'m
junior on the TML and am probably in need of indoctrination/re-education
myself.

What would the list of topics be?  I can only think of a few:
Jump Torpedoes,
No pre-TL 21 FTL communications,
Near C Rocks, or something like that.

Additions welcome.

The Bilandin font.  I still have version 1.0, been waiting to see if there
is a more up to date version before slapping on the webpage.  It\'s the
writing seen in many old DGP products, most notably Strship Operators
Manual.  The panels on the ship\'s interior sketches actually said things;
the one I recall off the top of my head is the comaprtment under the
gunner\'s chair contained an emergency vacc suit.

Did someone say heresy? ;-P

From what I\'ve read so far, GT\'s material looks good. There are even a
couple of familar names from TML among the posters on the playtest

Why do you say that\'s a problem, Mike?  I agree with your vision, fully!
Sure, you can design hypersonic ships to do the fast skim, but ships with
adaquate CG should be able to skim just the way you describe.

That\'s how I see it too.  The "fast pass" technique would skim a load,
process it on the outer loop, dump waste on the orbit back in, and skim
another load at close approach.  The "slow hover" technique would hover, or
move slowly, through the upper atmosphere skimming and processing at the
same time.  

As always, this is all IMTU...

Awesome movie, for the most part, but I was disappointed they didn\'t
have it out at Pearl Harbor.  When the Vortex opened again, they of
course, regardless of random chance, went right back to where they
belonged.

Woulda been nicer in a SEQUEL to see how F14 Tomcats stood up against a
crazed flight ot pterodactyls.

Ok, here\'s what I *think* I know about it...

On the cover of the TNE rulebook there is a woman holding some sort of
staff, or maybe a weapon, she\'s the "Empress" of Empress Wave fame.  Who is
she?  Where does she come from? What does she want?  There are NO
definitive answers to any of those questions.

As I understand it, she is an image that some psionics receive when
"looking" toward the galactic core..maybe comes to them in dreams. Is she
real or metaphor? We don\'t know.

The vision appears to be linked with a light speed event that is passing
through and disrupting Zhodani space. Just how is Zhodani space being
disrupted? We don\'t know.

Over on the RCES-TNE list, Dave Nilson dropped hints about "psionic
awakening" and those "wandering psionic knights", but he hasn\'t done more
than hint. Does even *he* know where he was going with TNE, probably...but
*we* don\'t know.

Personally, I set my PBEM several thousand years beyond all the events of
the rebellion/virus/wave (IMTU any, all or none of that might have
happened), where humanity is just beginning to explore the stars again.  A
really *long* night!  Anything that relates to *anything* in printed
sources is the stuff of legend...or maybe just a bunch of "old wives
tales."

If anyone\'s interested the (c) 1977 Book 2 I have printed in the UK under
licence from GDW by Games Workshop includes this too. (p.18)

I was quite surprised by this as I confess to having long thought they been
introduced in Leviathan.

That\'s there too (p.22) but I guess the usage of miles was less surprising!

No. *The* Official Kilogram is a bar of platinum iridium alloy in a
vault in a Paris suburb. The ones elsewhere were made by measuring them
against that primary standard (which is done as infrequently as
possible to avoid wear on the standard!) 

That makes these "primary national standards" "traceable" to the
standard. Then each national bureau of standards (or whatever they are
called in a specific country) creates standard weights referenced to
their primary standard. 

In high accuracy work, one of the important details is how many
"generations" removed your standards are from *the* standard.

There\'s a story about how one of the big government research labs
ordered a set of weights traceable to the US National Bureau of
Standards weights. Such weight sets (and other, equivalent tupes of
standards) are *expensive*.

They arrived, sealed in a canister filled with nitrogen gas. And a
shipping clerk, following an accounting department directive, opened
the canister, drilled holes in the weights, and attached property ID#
tags to them. Totally *ruining* the weights....

It might be an interesting item for characters to carry as cargo. A set
of Imperial standards of some sort. They have to be treated carefully,
and are worth a lot amount. Of course, they aren\'t worth *stealing*. In
fact, if stolen, their value drops to zilch, because you lose the
traceability. 

But some pirate\'s informant in port will only know that there\'s this
cargo container insured up the wazoo, and being treated like it was
made of spun glass. 

The poor players will have one *hell of a time with *that* contract.
Especially since I *really* can\'t see most players thinking they\'d have
any problem due to *that* piece of cargo. :-)

It *is*, just indirectly. Since the *second* is defined that way, and
the speed of light is a defined constant, the length of the meter
follows by simple mathematics.

That\'s the *worst* possible place to do it. You\'ll be cutting across
the maximum number of "field lines" (thus inducing the mzximum current
in any conductors in your ship). 

Your best bet for minimizing magnetic effects is to skim at the
*equator*, but along a north/south path. 

This is also good since determining *where* the magnetic poles are
isn\'t the easiest thing to do until after you are already well into the
planet\'s magnetic field.

But the magnetic fields aren\'t *that* much of a problem. The problem is
the charged particles trapped in them. Jupiter\'s "Van Allen" belts are
*huge*. And the major moons are right in the middle of them.

As I recall, you\'d get a lethal radiation dose in *minutes* on the
surface of, say, Io. 

But they aren\'t a lot worse than a *major* solar flare. So if your ship
is shielded well enough that you don\'t have to retreat into a shielded
"storm cellar" in the center of the ship, you\'ll be ok (the storm
cellar is fine for riding out a flare for a few hours to a couple of
days, but you can\'t run a skimming operation from it).

But it\'s *angular* momentum you are dealing with. Anything that slows
down the rotating section speeds up the formerly non rotating section.
You\'ll reach zero *relative* rotation between the sections, but the
ship as a whole will now be rotating.

The "non rotating" frame of the flywheel was anchored to the earth.
Every time you sped up or slowed down the flywheels, you changed the
earth\'s rotation slightly.

People living at the bottom of a gravity well have a distorted notion
of physics.

(I\'d *love* to get to play around in a physics classroom in a zero g
section of a station, or on the ground using g-comp :-)

Try one of our local "light rail" cars during rush hour in the
*summer*. The windows don\'t open except for this tiny bit at the top
(safety reasons, which I do understand). And there\'s *no* air
conditioning (at least in the older model cars). 

So you\'ve got temps as high as 100 in the shade, people packed to
standing room only, an essentially closed box, and the sun beating down
while you wait for it to make it\'s way from city center to the areas
where the tracks don\'t run down streets (and thus where it can put on
some speed).

A biplane is designed for a certain airspeed range. It makes no sense
at higher speed ranges. So an improved engine will only make the plane
lighter, which will help the manueverability. Advanced materials for
the structure will make it stronger and lighter. Ditto for the wing
covering materials. 

But the *design* is restricted to the under 200 mph range. But it\'d be
nice to fly, tougher than hell, and make a wonderful stunt plane.

The TL-15 fighter is a problem because you don\'t say what *kind* of
fighter. If it\'s a ground support job, like the A-10 Warthog, then it\'s
designed to be able to go after low speed, manueverable targets. And
it\'ll eat the biplane for lunch. 

If it\'s a "aerospace superiority" fighter, designed to teach fighters
from an invading fleet to stay the hell away from the planet, then it
won\'t be able to do much to the biplane except by accident or luck. The
biplane flies at mach .25 and has a turning radius of *feet*. The AS
fighter flies at Mach 25 and has a turning radius of *miles*. 

And if it\'s some other sort of fighter, the effectiveness against the
biplane depends on the mission requirements the fighter was designed for.

True enough. But I bet that while "climate"" is "easy" to predict,
"weather" will be hard. Chaotic effects are quite likely to be at least
as important as in terrestrial weather. Which means there\'s a hard
limit on predictability of details. 

So I expect that they may be able to predict "expect light to medium
sunspot activity with 25% chance of large flares" for the upcoming week
or two, they\'ll still have much shorter warning periods for actual
flares. 

Also, the flare predictions would have to be good for *at least* two
weeks to do the players any good when jumping in. After all, the news
has to get to their *departure* point so they\'d know what to expect
when jumping in. 

I expect that being ready for flares is part of normal procedure on
exiting jump, unless the ships are protected well enough to not care.

Ok. The natives will *suspect* there\'s something odd if you let them get
close. Things like struts will look *far* too flimsy at first. And then
after they see you doing things that *should* rip the plane into shreds
from stress, they\'ll *know* something is fishy.

And yes, it ought to be able to absorb incredible amounts of damage
from the real TL5/6 planes. Heck, by TL-15, the "skin" on the wings and
body is probably tough enough to be impentetrable by .50 cal machine
guns, or anything short of a small to medium shell making a direct hit.
The open canopy will leave the pilot vulnerable though. 

And you\'ll be able to do things like make 3-4 g manuevers, which would
cause a regular plane of the era to collapse. You can\'t do much more
because of your low speed, and the lack of oxygen gear and g-suits.

If that supersonic fighter makes a close pass *while* supersonic,
you\'ll still get turned into guacamole, even if the plane survives
(unlikely). 

Close up the shock wave from a supersonic planes is as bad as a *large*
explosion. Quite similar overpressure effects occur.

The problem isn\'t power. It\'s unbalanced stresses. The wind loading on
the ship will vary in ways that thrust loads  and manuevering loads
*don\'t*.

But the thing is that it\'s not aerodynamically stable. That means that
in a wind, it\'s preferred orientation could be *anything*. And combined
with a thrust pushing it in some other direction the result is *not* a
drift. It\'s a *violent* tumble. 

Also, check out what the forces exerted by wind are. Even a "measly" 30
mph exerts *tremendous* pressures over large areas. Here\'s the formulas:

P = 0.5 D V^2 cos^2 A,

P = Pressure, N/m^2 (multiply by 0.000146 for psi)

D = Density, kg/m^3 (=1.225 for sea-level air on Earth)

V = Velocity, m/s (multiply by 2.24 for miles per hour)

A = Angle from perpendicular

So at 20 km/h, lets see what we get.

20 km/h = 5.6 m/s. 

That gives 18.9 N/m^2 for the wind blowing perpendicular to the
surface. Figure the cross sectional area of the various parts of the
ship (don\'t forget to figure them from different directions) and start
figure what winds from various directions will do. 

And remember that by the very fact that you are trying to keep your
airspeed low, you *can\'t* avoid bad weather which is approaching faster
than you can run away. 

You may not be *able* to avoid turbulence or bad weather. After all,
since your ship isn\'t *designed* to operate in atmosphere, it won\'t be
equipped with the sensors need to spot things like clear air
turbulence. Which can hit you with 50-100 mph winds.

The units are fine. The equation doesn\'t *care* what units you use.
It\'s just that, for example, if you have the speed of light in meter\'s
per second, and the mass in kg  then you *have* to use joules because
of the way the math works.

e = kg * (m/s)^2
e = kg * m^2/s^2
e = kg m^2/s^2

Thus the unit of energy your answer is in is kg/m^2/s^2 which happens
to be the *definition* of joules.

Close enough. My calculator gives 6.471017515e11

Way too complex. Especially since you *can\'t* convert joules (energy)
into poundals (force).

What you should have done is this:

E = .5 * m * v^2

That is, the kinetic energy of a mass travelling at a given velocity is
one half of the mass, times the square of the velocity. Thus:

E = 6.471017515e11
m = .001 * .9928 = 9.928e-4
v = ?

E = .5 * m * v^2
2 * E = m * v^2
2 * E /m = v^2
sqrt(2E/m)=v

v = 3.610525372e7

or about 12% of light speed.

Of course in any *real* device, you\'d never get 100% of the energy
applied as useful output.

Again, it doesn\'t work that way. Rockets work in very non-intuitive
ways. I suggest checking the sci.space FAQ, part 4 for useful constants
and formulas.

But in essence, the final velocity of a rocket depends on the exhaust
velocity, and the mass ratio of the rocket (the final mass versus the
starting mass). Simple formula:

delta V = Ev * ln(mass ratio). 

So a rocket with a mass ratio of e (2.718...) can change it\'s velocity
by an amount equal to the exhaust velocity of the engine. So it\'d have
to start out weighing 2.72 units and finish weighing only 1. That\'s a
*lot* of fuel.

It\'s in that faq, and it\'s *messy*. It uses hyperbolic functions.

From the FAQ:

	Classical rocket equation, where
	    dv	= change in velocity
	    Isp = specific impulse of engine
	    Ve	= exhaust velocity
	    x	= reaction mass
	    m1	= rocket mass excluding reaction mass
	    g	= 9.8 m / s^2

	    Ve	= Isp * g
	    dv	= Ve * log((m1 + x) / m1)
		= Ve * log((final mass) / (initial mass))

	Relativistic rocket equation (constant acceleration)

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(a*t/c)
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(a*t/c) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(a*t/c)

	Relativistic rocket with exhaust velocity Ve and mass ratio MR:

	    at/c = Ve/c * ln(MR), or

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(Ve/c * ln(MR))
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(Ve/C * ln(MR)) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(Ve/C * ln(MR))

From another section:

	299792458 m/s	  (3e8)  -- speed of light in vacuum "c"
	9.46053e15 m	  (1e16) -- light year
	206264.806 AU	  (2e5)  -- one parsec
	3.2616 light years (3)	 -- one parsec
	3.0856e16 m	 (3e16)  -- one parsec

Note that the speed of light is *defined* as that value. It\'s an exact
number.

Well, it depends a lot on how you run CG. Figure out where the CG "cuts
off" and then try getting a 1g, 2g, etc ship away from the gas giant at
that point. Try various sizes of GG. 

Also, you do have to be moderately deep *or* moving pretty fast to get
a decent "pressure" in the scoops. Take the wind force equation I
posted in another message and punch in various sjip speeds and
atmospheric densities to get the effective pressure in the scoops. One
of the astronomy types can likely tell us at what altitudes you get
various densities and what the normal pressure at those altitudes is
like.

And you don\'t even want to force me to eat crow and apologize publicly to
you for slamming you falsely. Not even for the satisfaction of seeing me

I\'ve no doubt that\'s the way you actually percieve reality. It\'s funny how
two different persons can participate in the same events yet percieve them
quite differently. As I recall it, mostly you and I start out with general
statements. At some point you make a response that contains an unproven
assumption or a false conclusion. I point that out to you. You respond
either by ignoring it or by restating your original position. Apparently
you feel that if you repeat the same statement often enough, it becomes
the truth. I\'m less mystically inclined. When you fail to refute one of
my points I feel free to regard it as likely to be true. And I also feel
free to bring it up again later in the debate. When I do, you usually
bring up the original fallacious argument once more and, when challenged
once more, claim that you have already answered it before. Which, in a
way is prefectly true. The answer just happened to be worthless as an
argument in a serious debate.

Well, that\'s not the way your arguments came across; the impression I got
was that the reason you opposed drop tanks was that they logically implied
developements in the canonical Traveller background that should have been
in evidence in previously published material, but were not. But I\'m glad
to hear you admit that this is not the case. And do you recall a while back
when I repeated the criteria I used to determine whether I thought something
in the Traveller canon should or should not be changed? (IIRC you even said
that you agreed with them.) IMO canon should only be changed if it caused
logical conflicts with other parts of canon and then as little as possible. 
That was one of my axioms. Another was that the fact that something is not
mentioned in any Traveller publication is not proof that it does not exist,
unless it would have been of crucial importance to the subject of the
publication. Since you didn\'t challenge the axioms, further debate indicates
that you thought that my logic was false; that the conclusion I drew from my
axioms was not correct. In other words, that drop tanks did conflict with
other parts of canon. Are you following me?

True. That\'s one of the points that has not, IIRC, been nailed down. Just
how do you aim a jump? If you aim for a specific bit of realspace (relative
to your own bit of realspace before you enter jump, I suppose), then the
time variation of +- a day will cause a big difference in your exit point
relative to a moving planet (and the moving star it orbits, I suppose...)
OTOH you may be aiming for a point relative to the planet (We know of at
least one real space phenomenon connected to a planet that affects jump
space, so its concievable that a jump exit point could be linked to the
gravity well represented by the planet).

Hmm... Now that I think about it, perhaps I\'m wrong and the point has
been addressed. I seem to recall an old JTAS article by Marc Miller where
he specifies the uncertainty of a jump in spatial terms. I don\'t recall
the figures, but I think they were too small to be the result of the
time uncertainty. If so, then a jump exit point would seem to move with
the time. I\'ll have to check that when I get home.

I remember when the US Navy tried to give flags to commodores (who were
captains in command of more than one ship (squadrons), but that made
them "flag rank" when the other services had to make 07 to get a flag. 
They of course did not like that so the plan went by the wayside....

Sure. No question. But do you think that it is realistic that the cost of

Sure, but how much of that extra burden is extra power consumption (which
is drawn from the ship\'s power plant) and how much of it is extra
consumables that must be replaced at the next port? (And what kind of
consumables do you use to deal with excess heat?)

How much? What would be a realistic figure?

In any case I am interested in the methods that use consumables, because I
_want_ the costs to be as close to the Traveller canon as possible. I just
don\'t believe in the Cr2000 figure. If you can persuade me to accept it,
then I\'d be pleased as punch.

If fast drugs have a decent shelf life, then I\'d prefer an emergency load
of them. Unfortunately Fast drug only costs Cr200, so even if it had a
shelf life of 14 days (which is, of course, ridiculous) they would only
add Cr200 to the life support costs.

OK, so are you saying that a life support system that use consumables is
LESS plausible than one that dosen\'t? Bummer!

And there remains the problem that a passenger and a crewmember costs the
same even though the passenger only burdens the life support system 2/3rds
of the time. Which might be ignored if the difference was smaller, but
1/3 of Cr2000 is a decent chunk of change. Multiply by 8-10 passengers
25 times a year and you\'re well on you way to have your annual maintenance
covered just by that saving...

You\'re right about Io. In fact, current theory is that the bombardment

is known for.

Now there\'s a good idea! I can see such a hardened area being
standard on solar research vessels.

Does anyone else have thoughts regarding protection against rad
areas? Would a nuclear damper be useful as a "flare shield"? Or how
about an electro-magnetic field from FF&S used as armor against
plasma weapons by vehicles?  Wildstar, you out there?

By the way, does anyone know of a mail/newsgroup which discusses

Under the CT rules this would be difficult, because the difference in power
requirements between, say, the ATV module (almost no power needed) and the
Weapons Module (power for a triple laser turret needed) is quite large.  It
would not be efficient to install the power plant capable of covering all
contingencies in the drive section, so I would say the power plant (or
batteries, or whatever) for module missions is more logically installed in
the module.

Most modules, on the other hand, will need life support.  Probably the
drive/bridge section will contain that, and enough excess power generation
to cover the module\'s inertial comp and artificial gravity, which is also
present in just about every module.

In our current adventure (which is safely restricted to MTU) a Gazelle
class close escort has refitted the drop tank fittings to carry 30ton
standard modules.  A weapon module on each side is currently the norm.
Since the presence of two more turrets would be a violation of the
hardpoint rule, these are only usable when "deployed" or ejected from the
CE and set to guard around or near a particular item in need of remote
protection.  Note that each module has a power plant, turret, a cabin for
the gunner installed, communications and sensors (altough it really relys
on the mothership for sensor info).  The CE was drydock modified to fit
extra \'crawlspaces\' and a couple of airlocks to allow access to the rest of
the ship from the modules.

Jo Grant came up with the idea, and I thought it quite a good one when
operating in an area or under circumstances where the additional fuel in
the drop tanks is not as useful.  Of course, I thought they should carry
more cargo.

Under the CT rules this would be difficult, because the difference in power

IIRC the Broadsword LBB did mention added power in the Weapons
Module. Considering that a triple laser turret and gunner\'s station is only
one dt under CT, the other 29 tons should allow enough power and fuel.
Depending on the design, it might be possible to leave the Weapons
Module in place on a planet (or in orbit?) as an independent weapons
emplacement. I recall there being a Quarters Module that could be
set up (or used in the hangar) as living space whether it was attached
to the Cutter or not.

I would venture a guess that the Cutter carries enough power to allow
G-Comp and Life Support for the whole craft, module included, but that
any power-hungry module equipment (research labs, long-term
habitats, sensor arrays, etc) would have to include their own 
power supply.

btw, regarding the Assault Module with the entrenching gear - 
someone in another post stated that these would be useless
in a TL 11+ battlefield. I would still call the Module useful for
a few reasons:

1) This is a Mercenary Crusier. It isn\'t designed for fair fights.
Many (or even most) of it\'s jobs will be in TL 8 or less
environments. I may be wearing combat armor, but I still
want a foxhole when someone starts peppering me with
automatic weapons fire.
2) In almost any situation where a squad of leg infantry
would still be useful, giving them a place to hide while
they sort out the situation makes them more useful
still.
3) Mercenaries usually act to supplement local forces.
The Assault Module Cutter might spend all day shuttling
local TL 6-8 forces around, giving each squad an instant
fire base when they are dropped off at checkpoints,
crossroads, or wherever.

  Given the care that seems to be going into this, I think the least we
can expect is a scale bar at the side (possibly in both yards/meteres -
<gag>) even if no grid at all is there to clutter the map. For most RPG
sessions that\'s the important thing. Odds are that blowing these up 3-4
times isn\'t practical for everyone, illegal or not. Perhaps there\'ll be
a profusion of G:T based deckplans on web-sites once they clarify amongst
themselves things like deck-orientation, space per stateroom, etc.

  What? "jump projectors"? How about the same system that takes
drop-tanks (as little as I like them) or even your hull into Jump?
What is it in HG, KCr 10 + 1/Dt? That\'s _dirt_ cheap. (off-topic,
too cheap? - hull tankage runs KCr 100/Dt!).

  Because Dulinor has a secret :> He knows any such system will be a
short and medium term liability, and can delay implementation with
some tripe about it being a further example of the ossifying trend
in the 3I - once off a trade route, forever off a trade route.

 No. Both the trader and the fleet will spend most of their time
in Jump, and will have great difficulty meeting (even with the
outriders of said fleet). Where a conventional freighter could
try and evade to odd systems, wait, or simply run and hope, the
"station fed" ships must simply collect at the bottlenecks formed
by destroyed links in the system (courtesy of FI\'s ranging out).

  Seeings as the "fuel stations" _are routes_, including almost all
major worlds, to refer to "knowing where they must attack" as any
real advantage is absurd.

>So you have a system of stations that you can jump in to replace

  Wait, you\'re simultaneously claiming that these stations won\'t
likely cost hugely to install (see other thread). Now they\'re all
Jump tankers, presumably the Navy\'s supply? This is the same society
that\'s too cheap to install customs officers or patrol boats? One of
us is desperately missing some point or other. Who pays for these
spare (standardized?) Jump stations? They could be Navy tankers, but
that implies that the Navy does without or that their supply has been
very greatly increased, and that in an Imperium that _won\'t_ spend
money on internal security issues?

...

  This is ridiculous. See your own posts on "concentration of force"
and why that "proves" that escort ships wouldn\'t be detached for use
in anti-piracy patrols in peacetime. You now have to defend every
point (or enough, anyway), with a fleet waiting for raiders?

  It\'s not contrivance if the background calls it history.
Is it contrivance that he Ziru Sirkaa didn\'t simply giggle
and absorb Terra ("the squish heard `round the universe")?

  Remember, I\'m against this technology, at least until
something fairly persuasive comes along. But I\'m still
going to address the implementation issues as accurately
as I can.

  Not never. As the technology matures, some stations would be
built in uneconomic locations, and rot (including their security
arrangements). The expense is unclear, but presumed to be high on
the same basis that establishing fighter or SDB bases in all systems
(which I disagree with - patrolling is better) would be extravagantly
expensive. That was your point on anti-piracy, IIRC. Stations in well
travelled corridors will need very moderate armament for anti-piracy.

  Correction. Sorry. In which case any armed ships at the station
are available, and the event will be occurring under the guns of
the station and any "(anti)-piracy communications satellites" that
have been emplaced, per the relevant hardware posts.

  Yes, if the Imperium effectively goes out of its way to allow
pirates, smugglers, spies, child-molesters and travelling salesmen
to operate at will, then hijacking (_not_ piracy) will be very easy.
Presumably another way around this would be to take over the ship
and then simply crayon a note authorizing it from Naval Intelligence.

  Again, under this admin regime _slaving_ is preferable, as you
simply load up your passenger, giggle, and sell `em off to bordellos,
organ-leggers, and telemarketers.

  The Imperium doesn\'t have to be Big Brother (OC, the insurance
companies will do that for them), but given their raison d\'etre,
you can assume that they take reasonable security measures.

  So customs inspections never occur IYTU? Do you suggest that
should be the background standard? In a more normal (canon?)
hijacking you have time at each end before dealing with the
authorities, or you may jumping to do GG refuelling, etc. If
you can reprogram before a jump you can meet cohorts to crew
and refuel the ship, and who can deliver any captives to the
authorities (thus avoiding guaranteed capital offenses).

  This is back to the piracy debate, which I\'ll be happy to 
launch into again. We might want to make these Jump stations
robotic, to avoid the presence of security personnel who might
otherwise inadvertently interfere with criminal activities.

  The lack of customs staff also removes any prospect of these
stations being used for trans-shipping (at least to the downport)
which goes against what is provably a highly economic short-cut
for (intended high turnaround) scheduled shipping.

That\'s the question, isn\'t it? Especially where the shady activities
of player characters are concerned...in a mileu where communication
is limited to the speed of the ship the authorities want information
about, what constitutes "reasonable security measures"? What kind
of authentication could you do that wouldn\'t require you to hold the
trader for a couple of weeks?

Considering how close to the wire some traders operate with regard 
to income vs ship payments, one or two customs stops to clear up
irregularities in the paperwork could put them out of business. 
A couple of traders moaning in a startown bar about how the "picky"
customs agents one system over cost them their ship would be enough
(for a world off the main trade routes) to make most of the other traders
stay away.

I\'ve considered imperium-encoded flight plans (you tell the starport
authority where you are going, they send you an encrypted authentication
code, you transmit this code at your destination) but I didn\'t like it - 
any code used so regularly, especially in such a tech-variable environment,
will be broken readily. I maintain the code on a TL-12 mainframe, some
trader jockey\'s TL-15 handcomp breaks the code in 30 seconds. 
I maintain the code on a TL-15 mainframe, a Darrian expatriot hacker
makes a killing amongst the shady information market.

I decided it met the laissez-faire (with respect to trade) feel of the
Imperium, and the needs of my campaign, to make anti-hijacking
the business of the starship crew and the starship manufacturer,
with a few hijacking gangs becoming notorious but hard-to-catch
criminals - much like the very mobile bank robbers of the American
Midwest in the 1930\'s, they would act before the local authorities could
respond and then move to another area ahead of the wanted posters.

I did to.  In any case, I am unable to find any such reference in
my version of book 2.  I don\'t see that this changes much.  The
passage described is hardly more of mention of notions about what
one might do and appears to be an after thought in some versions.
They are then mentioned once in an adventure and given no other
development.  Various rules in different versions give conflicting
answers on whether they are possible.  For those who consider them
as undermining the fundamental basis of the background (the slow,
difficult, and expensive communications) their seems no problem
with just eliminating them.

>Most modules, on the other hand, will need life support.
Actually, if you remember, the standard trick when designing a ship is to
include life support for the entire volume. So if you design a modular
cutter with the module bay as a 30t cargo hold you have already accounted
for life support for the area the module will be in. It is only if you are
designing a deployable module (like the laser turret module) that can exist
independant of the cutter, that you need to factor in Life Support.
  Of course, it is hard-wired into the spreadsheet I use so I guess all my
designs are overengineered with life support in both the cutter and
modules. Ah, well, it makes it a plesant departure from the under-supplied
Scout/Courier...
  Here are my re-designs of the standard cutter and some modules for it.
     Jo

Questions:

1.	How does one figure periodic maintenance costs for star ships (e.g.
FAR TRADER)?
2.	What are the different modes of propulsion (FTL, JUMP, Sub-Speed,
etc.)?
3.	What are the effects (speed, fuel, etc.) of said modes of travel
(see # 2). 
4.	How many T4 books do I "really" need?

I am fairly new refereeing T4. Even so, I have changed the background
completely from an Imperium to a Theocracy, Catholic to be precise (makes
for new social and scientific rules and very interesting Science Fiction).
But that\'s another story. 

Sooo... I am attempting to put together a group. The four of us play in
Seattle. At Wizards of the Coast. Once a month on RPG Tourney Saturday.
Usually around the 25th on each month (barring holidays). I am looking for
players or advice for drawing new players to the game (my game). Traveler,
although obviously having a very loyal following, I am having trouble
finding players in my area. Could use any advice...

Have tried the following:

Deck orientation doesn\'t bother me, I\'ve always operated on a case by case
basis anyway. Conversions form GURPS Vehicles are what I\'m looking at, for
displacement values, etc. I want to see if they are going to use straight up
GURPS values or tailored to Trav\'s historic values. Heck I already have a
hex grid build in Corel, just waiting for the info.

I think it is actually the only metric measure that is *not* defined that
way. I think the problem has something to do with measuring the number of
fundamental particles in a given volume. [a quantum effect?]

Jump Projectors was a bad term.  The point is that you need too
have the Lanthanum grid, and any associated hardware, around
the tanks.  So they will need at least a portion of a jump
drive.

Which secret are you talking about?  And, in any case, that secret
will still be propigated the old way and the system would never
be built fast enough to affect something that was already being
propigated through the Imperium.

One can\'t have it both ways.  If trade is easy to cut off because
jump stations are only present at certain worlds along certain
routes, then you also know where the enemy commerce raiders need
to go to attack it.  If you don\'t know where they will attack]
because jump stations are all over the place, then ships will
find it easy to find alternate routes.

No, I\'m saying they navy will have "jump tankers" as backups, like
the army has pontoon bridges in case the "real" ones get knocked
out.

Wait a minute.  I never said they were.  I said the cost of those
will depend on percieved need.  And it will.  

I also said there is the issue of profiteering and shortsightedness.
This may, or may not, happen.  However, if you want to assume
that something _can\'t_ happen then you have to deal with it.
OTOH, you can assume that is will happen to support something.
The fact that it can go either way makes firm predictions
that hinge around that impossible.

You don\'t.  You do have to concentrate force.  In situations where
one force wants to avoid confrontations (because it want\'s to 
attack traders which are easier targets) getting your concentration
to the same place as theirs is problematic.  If you have a situation
where you have a better idea of the places they need to go, things
are easier.

Well, it is.  You can contrive history to work out a cetain
way.  Some degree of that is necessary.  However, the more
you do it the more the history gets a "contrived feel".
You are better off with a few  key elements contrived
(Dulinor met an accident before he killed Stephon) than
with numours contrivances to try and stem the numerous
concequences of a new technology.

I don\'t disagree that these rationalization aren\'t better than
nothing if you are going to have the technology and aren\'t
going to let the natural consequences take effect.

OK.  I agree that it would make piracy harder.  I just have
doubts about "extinct".

Will the orbital motion of the planet (or station if you have it in
solar orbit) for a day (that is the variation
in jump period right?) coupled with the variation in the
spacial location of the exit point (which I think is
relatively small on these scales) not put the ship
out of range of a ship at the jump point.  I think
it will, but I haven\'t gone through the numbers.

I don\'t see not making sure that every ship has a some sort of
unfoolable document of every person aboard on every
jump that can be checked at the destination without
communication back to the starting point as "going out
of its way to allow pirates, smugglers, spies, child-molesters and
travelling salesmen to operate at will"

Lets stay away from snide remarks.  I made a valid point. Please
give me the respect I deserve.

[more of the same]

Yeah, but is your view of security measures the only
reasonable one?  If hijackings are rare (as I thing they would
be given there a number of serious obstacles, then having to
go through what it would take to make a system that would
be workable would be nontrivial.  You would basically need
to have a system that would make any forging of documents
almost impossible.  It\'s not clear if this is possible,
let alone reasonable.
(Even Imperial seals are verfied at least partially by
checking the serial number back with the number on record
for it, that won\'t work for screening ships coming in from
another planet).

>   So customs inspections never occur IYTU?

No, I said that it isn\'t certain that every jump station
will have custom stations.  There are no direct taxes
on Imperial trade and goods can only be taxed on the
world when they leave the starport.  (right?  taxes
never appear on any of the starships economics directly
and the Imperium has the sole right to tax interstellar
trade).  Even if it were, it isn\'t clear that there
will customs at _every_ station (you could take stuff
that owes taxes into Canada from the US without passing
through customs.  That was before the free trade pact.)

True.  That makes it more difficult.  I don\'t see that
it makes it impossible.

Why don\'t we just stick to the point raised here?  The
fact is that any claim that people will be posted, 
documents generated and checked, ships delayed, etc.
will OK simply because it might eliminate a problem
(at least until the other side finds a new way around
it) is incomplete.  Otherwise we would custom officers
on every road between the US and Canada).

Dunno.  HOw much ya got and how badly do you want to risk a misjump?

No FTL - Jump instead.  STL: Gravity Plate Thrusters, HEPLAR Thrusters.  I
think there are more somewhere.

That should be in T4 Rulebook.  Also FireFusionSteel2.

The Basic Rule Book (although you may want to ask for a copy of T4.1 beta stuff
(mostly chargen though).  The rest depends on the campaign you want to run.
Milieu 0 is worthwhile and interesting.  Emperor\'s Arsenal and Central Supply
Catalogue for equipment etc.  Fire Fusion and Steel 2 if you want to design
things, including ships.  Imperial Sqaudrons for large scale combat.  Pocket
Empires for star-system management/economics.  Skip Starships!  Alien Archive
is about the coolest T4 supplement that there is, but its usefulness is
entirely up to you.  It only details minor alien races, but they rock.

We are a new group who play T4 in Seattle, at Wizards of the Coast, once a
month on RPG Tourney Saturday (usually around the 25th on each month...
barring holidays). If you live in the Seattle area and are interested in
joining us for Traveler, drop me a line at: amarin@walldata.com.

I am also looking for advice on drawing new players to the game (my game).
Traveler, although obviously having a very loyal following, I am having
trouble finding players in my area. Could use any advice...

>Questions:

>1.	How does one figure periodic maintenance costs for star ships (e.g.
>FAR TRADER)?

Canon is 0.1% of ship costs per annum, done at a class B or better
starport. It takes the ship offline for 2 weeks.

>2.	What are the different modes of propulsion (FTL, JUMP, Sub-Speed,
>etc.)?

FTL is jump drive ... throw the switch, use the fuel, go into Somewhere
Else for 6-8 days and arrive.

Sub-speed is either thruster plates (pour in power, get thrust) or some
form of reaction engine (Heplar is pour hydrogen thru your fusion plant and
chuck it aft).

Etc is detailed in Fire Fusion and Steel *grin*

>3.	What are the effects (speed, fuel, etc.) of said modes of travel
>(see # 2). 

Thruster plates keep working until you run out of fuel for your power plant
or you get outside a star\'s gravity well (it\'s a game fix to stop people
accelerating rocks to a sizeable fraction of C and hitting enemy planets
with them).

>4.	How many T4 books do I "really" need?

T4 rulebook. Pocket Empires if you want to do economic development and the
clash of worlds. Fire Fusion and Steel if you\'re a gearhead. Emperors
Arsenal if your players are gunheads. Central Supply Catalog is good.

You two won\'t let it lie, will you?

I\'d ask you to bury the hatchet but I suspect it would end up between
someones shoulder blades.

You\'re not going to agree (dare I mention PIRATES for a previous example),
so please take this off the list if you must continue... at least we don\'t

Interesting isn\'t it? My FLGS sold a copy of Ringworld RPG for £ 120 UK
pounds (say $180 US) and shifted the same games\' companion for £40 last
EuroGenCon. And I have mint copies of both... I was tempted to sell but
thought better of it.

Agree...., but that rate can be minimised through judicious management of

Yep.. I kind of realised that towards the end of that rambling section. The
initial post was discussing storing the rotational energy, then moved on to
angular momentum. Personnally, I\'d spin down nice and slowly and use a
thruster to kill the spin of the main body.

Even with respect to physics at the bottom of the well... rotational bodies
do interesting things - in one case I know of, a series of failures in high
speed rotating bodies was induced by the effect of the neap tides shifting
the peninsula the units were on. Or at least, that was the only viable
explaination..

Actually, Io\'s volcanoes are caused by tidal forces (Io gets bent out of
shape by Jupiter, and it\'s resonance orbit with Ganymede and Europa keeps
it from setting into a single shape/circular orbit.)

The gas from the volcanoes does indirectly contribute to the general
Jupiter environment, though.

The radiation environment close to Jupiter is one reason there are no
closeup Io pictures from Galileo - it hasn\'t made a close Io pass since
arrival, since it picked up >50% of its lifetime radiation dose when it
passed near Io during Jupiter insertion. The Galileo Extended Mission may
end with an "Io Death Plunge", though.

I can accept streamlined, but *rhetorically* why hypersonic?  Surely,

Ian, that\'s not entirely fair!  We don\'t *know* that IG couldn\'t arrange to

And amarin, IG may be gone, but Traveller is still alive. Marc Miller is,
hopefully, looking for another publisher to produce his new version. In the

Hello,
  The answer? I don\'t know, but I would take stabs at a few of the
more obviously cost effective (or _necessary_) measures, and hope
that I figure out the most obvious dodges before theplayers did.

  Search, check for contraband, bullet holes and bloodstains, boxes
of spare nuclear det-laser missiles. Possibly nothing else. You\'d
at least want to file a complaint with the SPCA if you found an
undeclared hold of Vargr corsairs :)

  The near extreme variant of "detailed search of every ship at
range under heavy guns, etc., ad nauseum" (sounds like the TNE
Quarantine procedures) would be (IMO, and certainly undesirable
IMTU) impractical in the CT world of little traders flitting
about, unless you assume that the (suitably enlarged?) Marines
are effectively a Star Patrol surrogate (CHiPs from Hell?)

  Sadly, the debate on computers and encoding regimes is well beyond
me, and be well-represented on any TML searchable archives. 

>Considering how close to the wire some traders operate with regard 
>to income vs ship payments, one or two customs stops to clear up
>irregularities in the paperwork could put them out of business.
...

  I would shy away from measures that delay shipping significantly as
uncanonical. If you want to jump into a system* and meet a boat or drop
a cargo pod, so be it. You shouldn\'t be required to drop by the starport
for a search under those conditions. If an authenticated vessel with
the relevant authority tags you for a random search, the law would
specify that you pull over. Maybe the fine for jumping is worth it: only
an honest trader with a tight schedule would risk becoming a make-work
project for every tax and security agency in sight.

* - presupposes internal tankage - "jump stations" make the perfect
excuse for tightening up security - no jumping out from the vicinity
without clearance (presumably after a search).

  But a vessel will have to stop for fuel at such a jump station if
that is the transport mechanism. The single most cost efficient act
security agencies can take at that point is to conduct an on-site
inspection of your ship while fuelling goes on. If loading is going
on then you\'re _always_ going to have to deal with cargo inspections
by the receiving party at least - whoops! seal\'s broken on this box,
roll 1d d6 x10 minutes delay...

  If the ship is trading, then actual inspection is less likely to be
a problem than paperwork - like payment for your new spec cargo, and
insurance for the freight you\'ve contracted to your next port.

  There is the implication that real Imperial security concerns are met
by the state of the art; circa 1100 that\'s the same TL 15 of the Imperial
Marines. However, the issue is where is that deployed? It would be
reasonable to say all important Imperial facilities, regardless of local 
tech; we can assume that Norris facilities at Regina included TL 15
command and control hardware and the personnel to support them.

  It comes to referee preference. Again, this issue is also a computer
gear-head paradise.

>I decided it met the laissez-faire (with respect to trade) feel of the
>Imperium, and the needs of my campaign, to make anti-hijacking

  It remains to a ref\'s campaign needs: if I were to run something in
some backwater security would vary from system to system, and I\'m sure
that the PC\'s would develop an appreciation of what routes were best
for the "legal natures" of cargo they might have.

        Yours truly,

  Demountable (as opposed to drop-) tanks will need a portion
of the hull apparatus, which is sadly _very cheap_ in HG/TCS.
I would almost certainly change this in my own campaign, but
the apparent costings are in the two lines above your question.

  See below for a detailed analysis. If someone on the list knows
better, their help in discussing the issue would be appreciated.
As it is I shall see if I can get a naval hobbyist to take a look
at it by late next week.

  Jump stations all over the place either exacerbate the case 
discussed below, or become casualties in short order. I\'m not
happy with analogies in these cases, but the image comes to

  The Navy has tankers already tasked for fleet use, and presumably
near the levels needed for a real war. Are the "jump tankers" you\'re
referring to those ones the Navy already has or new construction? I
mentioned this in the post you replied to, but you cut it without
addressing it. It affects both the cost of system implementation and
is impacted by the entire Navy budget / internal security debate.

  Granted. However, you simultaneously claim that anti-piracy
patrols will be too expensive to implement - even though numerous
analyses of the canonical Trav Imperium have indicated otherwise
(none of which were sufficiently refuted) in the same Imperium
that will blithely build a huge new superstructure of jump tankers
that will have no real peacetime role?

  Anything can happen, hopefully when the PC\'s are in proximity.
For background purposes it\'s establishing the relative likelihoods
that\'s relevant, i.e., if misjumping were too likely then the
Imperium would look radically different if it existed at all, as
others have pointed out. Malfeasance and incompetence are the
refs friends, although Trav computers may be reliable enough to
remove some of the fun - it should be much easier for manual
mis-filing than for an automated system using your unique 3I-ID#.

  If I have a sectors worth of warships and appropriate attachments
of intruders and light raiders, and you have similar (see FFW) force
(including SDB\'s) then a meeting between battlefleets might be a
crapshoot, although it might take months to arrange (see the run-up
to Trafalgar). In those months you have to protect each J-station
against a raider force increment, using approximately that same
force increment _fixed to that system_. The invader can move about,
and if he chooses to, can concentrate X force increments (Fi)where X
is greater than 1. Doing so in one system at a time costs the invader
one Fi per time period, while meeting this new threat costs the
defender one Fi _per key Jump-station-system until the nature of the
war changes_. The number of such systems must exceed one per sector.
These extra forces must come from your fleet assets, presumably,
thus writing down your superiority for the battleline clash.

  One of us has a serious problem visualizing concentration of force.

  What if the new technologies consequences are intended? Again,

  You don\'t disagree (potentially agree?) that these rationalizations
are not better than nothing? I.E., they\'re worse than useless? 
Whatever.

  As for the tech, failure to allow the natural consequences of
something to take effect (barring further mitigating factors)
pretty much goes against what Traveller tried to stand for in
methodology. I believe in the consequences being allowed to evolve,
I simply _really_ don\'t like drop tanks consequences. 

  That said, there are some interesting arguments presented to
suggest that the 3I might not be thrilled about implementation,
and that it occurring to a great extent before 1116 is not a
given, except by individual referees decision.

Because of the speeds involved.  Surface gravities and escape velocities of 
gas giants tend to be pretty high, so you\'d want your ship to be moving pretty 
quick when it skims if you have a low-thrust manuver drive.  That way, you 
won\'t need as much delta-vee to get out alive.

Try and find a newsletter/RPG magazine locally, and run something in a

Then it\'s happened in the last couple of years, as I recall reading

I can see that explaining why there\'s so much sulfur coming off the

No. Remember, the damper affects the rate at which radiation is
emitted. But with a flare, the particles were emitted at the *star*. In
effect you are in the middle of a *huge* particle beam shot, but a
badly focused one.

The stuff from the flare is more diffuse, but higher energy. Mostly
protons moving at a fair fraction of c. Take a hell of a field to
deflect that. And you have to worry about *where* you are deflecting it
*to*. Remember, the field *has* to have "poles" which means that the
direction things get deflected depends on what part of the field they
hit.

I\'d think that any field that\'s good as shielding against flares is
going to be useful as at least *reducing* damage from particle beams,
as it\'s much the same thing.

And some flares will have an x-ray hazard as well.

Not directly proportional. But the facilities on a ship are a *fixed*
size. So that means that twice the load *will* take twice as much
energy/consumables/whatever. It\'s not like comparing two *different*
units each designed for the specific load size.

Not sure. Depends on what sort of chemical process you are using. CO2
will probably be done by something like lithium or calcium hydroxide.
The reaction converts the hydroxide to carbonate. 

Such canisters *are* used in some "life support" type situations on
earth. You may be able to find a price. But I\'m not real sure how
easily you can.

Activated charcoal for filtering out the "miscellaneous junk" isd the
other likely iterm. Though it\'s also possible to use a sort of
"catalytic converter" to burn most of them to water, CO2, and nitrogen.
But you will have problems with the traces of sulfur, phosphorus,
chlorine and other such elements present.

Slight problem. When you get that sort of misjump, who says that you

rather different.

Not less plausible. Just less flexible if there are problems.

Where do you get 2/3rds? Both are on board for a week (duration of
jump) plus the time from takeoff to landing. While on planet or "in
dock" at a high port, the life support costs for the crew are *highly*
variable, depending on the local conditions.

Look, as far as we know, Kenji is just a pen name for some mild-mannered
bureaucrat working somewhere within the bowels of the Department of
Transportation in Seattle.

Hell, if none of my pervert friends in Seattle can find anyone who seems to
correspond to Kenji (do you know much it costs in bribes to get pervert
bars to serve rum and sardine punch ???) and no-one has responded to the
ads for "I\'ve got a big PMPP, but I dont know how to use it" in any of the
local rags. 

However,  I did find the no-show of the featured speaker to the "Commodity
Fetishism and Exteremly Post-Modern D/s" lecture at a recent Society of
Janus meeting *highly* suspicious.

Oh yeah, that and the discovery of a paper at the NSF asking for funding on
"High-G deceleration experiments on Animal subjects (bovines)" lead me to
think Kenji may still be out there somewhere ...

Aren\'t we thinking two dimensionally here.  What\'s wrong with going over it

Lot F-1
Azhanti High Lightning
Traveller Adventure Aboard an Imperial Starship
GDW
Date: 1980
Condition: 
Box: the lid is a bit bowed and two corners are split, but no tape. 
There is some wear along the edges. It appears as if this game has been
moved around and stored a lot.  The bottom of the box is fine with one
small tear in one corner.
Contents: The maps are beautiful and look as though they have never been
opened, as do the rule booklets.  The counters are punched, but I doubt
the game was ever played as many of the counters are still attached in
rows of 4 and 5.
Minimum Bid: $40.00

  I\'m talking two dimensions in the sense that I\'m covering the surface area of
the federation.  Not a line but a screen.  Concidering that it only takes ONE
molecule to screw up subspace for quite a distance, a surface area border
wouldn\'t be that difficult. You can\'t go over or under that, but you can pass
through at STL speeds.

The main idea is that you are doing this not to gain a monopoly but rather
that your company is at the center of a expanding sphere of innovation. In
the short term you may not make as much money but in the long term you will
make a hell of a lot money and so will a lot of other people. Because you
have the tech database you can always stay a step or two ahead of the
competition in your core business and use the money made off of investments
to continually invest in companies that were founded with no help from you.

You could do this in a secret conspiracy manner but you could also do this
in a open conspiracy. You just have to pick the right place to start a place
that will protect your property rights.

Oh, well a high-tech replica is another thing entirely...right now, I
could make a very high performance (relatively speaking) biplane that
would superficially look just like a Sopwith Camel, but would perform
considerably better.

If you insisted that your own mechanics and pilots worked with the thing,
it would be hard for someone else to see you had Kevlar fabric covering
spun composite frame members bonded with high strength epoxy, and your big
radial engine was mostly aluminum. They might notice your high performance
prop looked a bit funny and you were really picky about the grade of
gasoline (though one advantage of a radial engine is that it\'ll run on
crappy fuel) but if you kept people from actually cutting away at the
thing, you could keep the secret under wraps.

So long as you stuck with contemporary weaponry, they might just think you
had a very well made plane. Of course, you stick a high ROF gatling on the
thing, you\'ll chew up just about any opponent you meet, but a) you\'ll run
out of ammo really fast, and b) people will notice, and may soon copy the
principle, if not the actual design, as a gatling _is_ a simpler mechanism
and has an inherently higher ROF than a single barrel machine gun...the
drawbacks, at that TL are the higher weight of the weapon, and the
percieved primitive design. (after all, those rotating monsters were real
_old_ tech at that point in time, with Lewis, and Maxim guns)

You know Bruce, you bring up some interesting points. What about all of the
engineering developements that went through a "stall" period, where they
were ignored for x length of time until they were revived with high tech
materials and found to be BETTER that the perceived "higher" tech
replacements. A couple that come to mind are the Cunard (sic?) wing
configuration and the Catamaran hull shape. Might be an interesting avenue
to explore for "alter"tech.

I did.  It may be that Hans\' attacks and name calling me did
provoke me to one more response than I would have.  But it
decided to make it my last response to him to end it and I
have.  I have not even read Hans\' response to my last post.
Let me ask that the best way to put a final rest to this
is for others not to wade in with posts on the subject.

I have already unilaterally stopped.  I did let Hans get the last word.

If a comerce raider is getting to systems all over, they
are stopping commerce no matter what.  In places where
the war has gotten bad enough that virtually every system
is being hit on a regular basis, you will have to convoy
anyway.  One could then just have tankers with the convoy.
Or they could hid under the protection of planetary
defenses until the convoy shows up.  Or there may be
other responses (surely we don\'t want to assume the plan
is for stations to wait statically till they are destroyed
and then just give up).

Also, I\'m not sure commerce raiding got that bad in
the Rebelion, but even then there would be advantages
of using the system in parts of the Imperium that weren\'t
being hit and use the old system in the hard hit areas.

I\'m refering ones that can be built with a portion of those
resources freed up by using the cheaper shipping method everywhere
to support those areas where shipping is being hard pressed.
Of course they also might be able to just move the stations
under plantery protection until the fleet shows up.  Or
hid them on the surface of asteroid.  The fuel tanks are
clearly going to be movable (to bring the fuel from the
source) and there is not reason than the actually fuel
mechanism will be big at all.  A fleet jumping in may
have a tough time finding them if you just hide them
on the surface of a small asteroid.

>>Wait a minute.  I never said they were.  I said the cost of those

>  Granted. However, you simultaneously claim that anti-piracy

I never claimed
piracy was, or wasn\'t, impossible.  I said it could go
either way, based on a number of factors.  One of these
is the frequency of patrols and for that the price of the
piracy they will suppress will be weighed against their
cost.   Similarly the price of having tankers for those
places where they needed can be offset by the cheaper
shipping everywhere.  (If you need to go to them
at all, they are only on possibility...)

Secondly, you are comparing wartime to peace time what
people are willing to bear in war time is different.
People are willing to pay more to keep trade routes
open in war time than they are willing to reduce
piracy from rare to non-existant.

Well, I said the piracy would be harder with jump stations.
It might even be eliminated.  But I don\'t think that it
is a sure thing.  There are a lot of things that could prevent
that from happening.  My _guess_ is that, at the most,
piracy will go through the sort of cyclical nature we
see in situations like this where it happens, resources
are beefed up, it becomes almost non-existant, over time
complacency sets in and budgets are cut, piracy reappears,
budgets are raised against, etc.

Only if you protect every single stations.  I see no reason why
anyone would need to do this.  You try and predict where the
force will go and intercept, sacrificing shipping along the
way.

It becomes a question about whether you want to go to
a background where commercial ships leave from installations
more like Babylon 5.

A good magnetic field might stop ions moving at a fair
fraction of c.  OTOH, then you have to deal with the
breaking radiation that emits.  My guess is that the
best shielding agasint solar flares will be to keep the
ship between you and the star.

Well, as I\'ve said all along...IMTU slow skimming is possible. But if you
have a low-thrust maneuver drive and CG doesn\'t work the way I have it
working IMTU then you have a point.

OTOH, if CG is negating 99% of surface gravity then that 10g GG is,
effectively, a 0.1g asteriod.  A fairly low-thrust maneuver drive could
provide plenty of thrust under those circumstances to boost a ship above
the atmosphere where its stutterwarp engines can kick in. ;->

While I wouldn\'t presume speaking for the powers that may be, I tend to 
think that IRIS will wither as a nonentity in the GURPS:Traveller 
timeline.  Besides, to many Traveller fans, the idea of IRIS was 
ludicrous in the extreme.

IRIS was rather amusing, if nobody called their bluff, you could pull off just
about *ANYTHING* in their name.  If you *DID* call their bluff, they either got
mondo-violent on ya or ran like hell.

Building a CG unit that\'ll negate a 99.9m/s accelleration is gonna be costly.  
Powering it is gonna be moreso.  Remember the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics, and 
that this *isn\'t* Trek.  <ducking>  Ain\'t no free lunches here...

Hum, let\'s see...FFS, p75 High Efficiency CG (12) -- 0.1MW/dt; 0.03Mcr/dt. 

So, a 200dt Free Trader\'s CG requires 20MW and costs 6Mcr.  The trade off
is with the lift only TNE CG you need another thrust agency in addition to
the CG.

[BTW, GURPS Vehicles gives similar numbers...a little more power, but
somewhat cheaper.]

I won\'t argue whether the numbers generated by FFS are, or are not,
accurate seeing as we don\'t have any working CG\'s to compare them against.
Anyway if your TU uses a different method of CG then more power to
you...pun intended. ;->

"Canard" wing. 

Would you believe that the point-contact transistor was patented around
1905? The inventor didn\'t know how or why it work, just that using
*two* "cat\'s whiskers" on a "crystal detector" set up in a certain way
worked *lots* better. Since they had no idea what was happening, it got
dropped when tubes were developed. (A radio magazine I used to read
printed part of the patent, which a reader had stumbled over).

Another one that\'s been brought up before is the things you can do with
lower tech tools and materials if you have higher tech knowledge.
Electroplating appears to have been *accidentally* discovered about the
time writing was a hot new invention. :-) And then lost again.

For example, while the Romans used concrete, there are a lot of things
a good civil engineer could teach them about *ways* to use it, and a
chemist could improve some on the *way* they made it.

And hot air balloons and gliders are well within the ability of Roman
craftsman, if you give them a design. Observation balloons would be a
*decisive* advantage for any decent Roman general. 

Teach them to make simple telescopes, and set up semaphore telegraphs
alongside the Roman roads. Suddenly messages can cross the Empire in
*hours* instead of weeks.

My apologies. I\'d intended that post as a spoof of some of the sillier
things we\'ve done on the list in the past. I had expected that (like
the last time the subject came up) there\'d be several *detailed posts

This reminds me of a paper my old Classics lecturer once wrote. His
specialisation was Imperial Roman military intelligence, and he wrote this
paper on Roman mapping, and it\'s effects on their military thinking. The
gist of it was that the Romans drew maps of their roads, with the towns
they past marked out according to how long it took to get from one to
another. This meant that they devloped a very linear thought pattern, and
often did not see opportunities if they meant leaving the roads. If they
had had good map making and good long distance surveying technology
availible they might have lasted longer. Certainly the medieval Europeans
could have done with it.

It has been shown that the only thing between the Roman Empire and
automatic firearms was a slight lack of chemical understanding.  The Romans
possessed the fine skill in metal working to produce a nice little
machinegun.

I\'d belive in a Roman Gatling type machinegun, but not a Maxim (recoil) or
gas oprated one. Their metallurgy was good, but not that good. They
would\'ve had real trouble making springs that were both powerful and
consistent enough to be useable. Mind you a handcranked gun such as a
Gatling would be better with blackpowder anyway, as fouling wouldn\'t affect
it as badly as it would affect a self powered weapon.

reported problems and the people who didn\'t. <sigh> Well, we had hopes.
After some consultation with some browser experts, the only conclusion that
could be drawn was that the user-variable configuration issues were what
was causing the problem - i.e., people using strangely-sized fonts that
were outside the "normal" set (the Dragonfire version of FT was guilty of
designing around one such font), or strangely-sized windows in their
browsers (FT should look OK in 640x350 or higher, with 256 colors - below
that, we can\'t make any guarantees, although 16 colors _ought_ to work). 

We did find out that there are some design flaws even in the current
version of Freelance Traveller - a lot of you complained about the blue
links on the black - rightly; they\'re tough to see.  We\'ve got some new
colors all picked out; the next update will reflect them.  We\'re also
adding a hit counter to FT; we\'d appreciate it if, rather than bookmarking
individual pages from within FT, you would bookmark the FT main page
itself, and then navigate to the page you want.

One other thing: With the next update, there will be an "invisible" page
with a modified appearance.  We\'d appreciate it if you would look at it,
compare it to the regular main page, and let us know which you think looks
better.  The test look _definitely_ avoids the encroachment problem that we
haven\'t otherwise been able to solve - but it comes with some drawbacks of
its own.  The URL will be
http://www.tightbeam.com/FreelanceTraveller/test.html, but don\'t expect it
to be available until after 10 May 1998 - which is when we expect to have
the next version uploaded for posting.  That version will incorporate some
of the old RICE papers, though no longer under that title.

Well, that may not be strictly true in practice.  He is, after all, the
Archduke of his domain; his appointment comes from the Emperor himself; and
it\'s likely that the details of implementing an Imperial order are up to
him.  In essence, within his domain, he _is_ the Imperium.  And it\'s quite
clear that this is exactly how he (and the other Archdukes) views his
position (as is revealed by subsequent events).  It would be quite easy to
delay implementation of such a system by "commissioning a study to
determine the most effective way to proceed", for example.

Touchy, at best - if the new system is that much more cost-effective, it is
likely to result in the shutdown of the old system over time.  If it\'s not,
it will take a long time for it to get a toehold.  Look at the way the
telegraph competed with and displaced the Pony Express, and how the diesel
engine for the family automobile _didn\'t_ displace the gasoline engine.

Not to mention that when you displace a technology that thoroughly, there\'s
hell to pay to get the old system back up and running (for example, suppose
electricity became impossible to employ.  How long would it take to get the
Pony Express - or some other method of delivering mail without using
electricity - up and running?).

What do you think?

1. Does the Imperium still incorporate worlds at its own option, or do the
locals have a say?

2. On a balkanized world, what happens if some nations want to be members,
and others don\'t? (N.B. this is not a problem in the Julian Protectorate,
according to canonical material.  But the JP is not the 3I.)

3. Let us assume that a balkanized world may be part member and part not.
Does the Imperium appoint an ambassador to each nation, or one to the
entire world?

4. Certainly, the extraterritorial starport will have a feed of important
interstellar news - the TNS.  What about local news?  Does the TNS have a
reporter/reporters on-planet to do it, or will they rely on local
organizations (with their potentially biased or censored feeds)?  Will such
local feeds include news about the non-member nations?

  [I\'ve hived off the naval strategy; what remains seems to be
the debate as to whether the jump-fuel-station technology (which
is a Bad Thing?) will be implemented fully or in a very big way
before the Rebellion (possibly because it may be very cheap or have
very few disadvantages) or might quite reasonably not have been
extensively implemented for various reasons (and thus not be any
real threat to canon for not being obviously present in MT), while
still being seen as a Bad Thing. Neither of us appear to be in
favour of B-5 type jump portals or facilities of similar effect.]

  I suppose. I don\'t know what an Archdukes powers are, but if
he can\'t even delay it (and some of his associates must have
been told at some point that a new Ilelish revolt might be in
the offing), then an Archduke seemingly has little power.

  Seeings as trade largely stopped outside the safes, then
_something_ was wrong. Someone with a better background in
MT would have to tell me if I\'m wrong in believing that
Wilds or long-distance trade was _very badly_ restricted.

  The Third Imperium is a socialist command economy? Megacorps

Tankers?

  That works only if the planet is ringed with enough firepower
to stop an Intruder (not light raiders) in the first place. Not
really cheap, but do-able. Still fails in a puff of logic if a
battlefleet passes through, however briefly: jump-link destroyed.

  Any ships jumping in needing fuel are now hosed. Also, 
hiding will be difficult if enemy scouts can hop around
your permeable peacetime internal security net. The jump-
station has by now clearly evolved into a tanker.

  Again, without delving too deeply into piracy, the lack of
an effective internal security regime (serving as a de facto
anti-piracy force) increases the vulnerability of a jump-fuel
station system. The costs that are weighed in these decisions
are also not strictly economic, as any observation of criminal
law and its enforcement would show.

  What societies are willing to pay in peacetime, or their
definitions of peace, vary widely by place and time. Some
of the previous runs at this issue have ignored that.

  The issue IMO wasn\'t non-existence but how rare, and I\'m
concerned about setting up the Imperiums (or a pocket empires)
internal security/traffic control policies deliberately such
that they won\'t operate efficiently or effectively against
piracy with a reasonable use of resources. Further, the Imperium
is not a democracy. People may be more willing to render unto
Caesar than to face possible consequences.

  Analyses using Traveller background info and approved (though
faulty in various opinions - certainly imperfect) economic stats
and models produced results indicating the level of Imperial
and Colonial Navy strengths. Even absurdly low allocations to
internal security patrols gave promises of exceptionally high
levels of success against stereotypical piracy. Choosing to
argue with the results is a failure to attempt to correct the
errors in the original model.

  Fixing questionable processes in TCS or Striker is a worthy goal.

  Sure. In a "permanently" peaceful environment you could end
up with anti-piracy policies and implementation that would
make Dilbert cringe. Certainly the Imperiums political life had
to be rotted out for the Rebellion to play out the way it did.

As I understood it, the real-life story behind IRIS is that it was
presented in CHALLENGE as a variant. Somebody didn\'t notice that and
used them in a TNS newsbrief. Ooops.

GDW handled that rather neatly in _Survival Margin_ where a quote from
Strephon\'s diary makes it clear that he had never heard of IRIS before.
In other words, in the main Traveller universe IRIS was the imaginative
creation of some world-class (galaxy-class?) con-men. Thus IRIS will not
(IMO) exist in the G:T universe. At least, not if the G:T universe don\'t
diverge from the main universe until Dulinor\'s accident.

Eris,

That isn\'t entirely true... IG is still there to sell the existing
material, but won\'t be producing any more. Let\'s at least give them a
chance to sell their remaining stock and pay the money they owe to writers
like Dave G and Andy L.

FWIW I\'m waiting for T4.1 eagerly too...

Incidently, I\'d recommend the following other books over what Ian said:

Milieu 0 Campaign (nice timeline and background material for the start of
the Imperium).
Aliens Archive - loads of well written Minor Alien races (shame that that
print is SO BIG! but the content is excellent).
Pocket Empires - Rules for running small empires as a game, and also as
background material for roleplaying (though the game rules dominate). BTW,
no one I know of has actually run this and mentioned it to the TML. It\'s
kind of an economics sim.

The following should be avoided IMO:

First Survey (unless bought in the M0 Campaign). Limited usefulness in
these maps as they didn\'t do referee\'s versions.... and some data clashes
with former GDW Traveller material.
Starships - SSDS is good, but you can get it off the internet in a revised
form. The deckplans are lousy.
Missions of State - two excellent adventures (by Joe Walsh and Martin
Dougherty) but the risk are poor to lousy.
The Annililik Run - a scenario conceived by Core and destroyed by James
Ward. Sort of AD&D in space.

Except that the rules do not mention anything about life support being more
or less expensive for various numbers of passengers. (NB. I don\'t have
FF&S2). But, OK, we could say that the rules assume that all PC ships are
roughly the same size...

BTW. there are some figures in an early JTAS (#3 I think; it was
about belt mining) that makes life support for spaceships less than for
starships. Go figure...

Oh, and the adventure _Annic Nova_ implies that life support costs is only
half for private vessels (What it SAYS is that being a private vessel, the
PCs can get away with Cr1000 per week rather than the standard [Cr2000/jump].
Since this is exactly the same amount, I surmise that there\'s a misprint
involved and that the author MEANT Cr1000/two weeks.)

Assuming the most expensive (In which case we must also assume that the
Imperium requires this for of life support if you want a licence to carry
passengers (that may explain the difference in costs mentioned above).

I missed this the first time around. Where is it established that a misjump
can keep you in jump space for four whole weeks? I thought you were talking
about the problems of misjumping into a fuel-less environment.

Once you realize you\'ve got a problem, you put all passengers and all
non-essential crew in fast trance, reducing the drain on life support
by 97%. A few crewmembers remain awake. When they exit jump and return to
civilization a dose of fast antidote will revive everybody regardless of
how long the trance still has to run. The extra Cr900 for the antidote is
a small price to pay compared to Cr1000/week. (Which is also the basis for
the "Fast Berth" I\'ve proposed that costs roughly the same as a Low Berth
(about Cr1,500 for a jump-1, which is the realistic price of a jump-1 Low
Passage), but is 100% safe (Indeed, if the passenger is prepared to forego
the antidote and sleep off the fast drug, the cost becomes quite a bit lower
than a Low Berth).

The rules does not mention food and lodging while at a starport as a
standard expense for running a starship. The implication is that crew
have the option of living aboard the ship while in port (And I\'m fairly
sure that I could dig up some adventures where that is also implied,
but I wouldn\'t swear to it without chacking first). Anyway, if you assume
that the figure is the same for both crew and passengers and that time in
port is extra, you increase the life support cost to Cr6,000/month which
only increase my incredulity.

According to Patrick O\'Brian a Napoleonic era commodore did have a flag
(a \'broad pendant\'), but he did not have the right to fly it when in the
presence of an admiral (The admiral might allow him to fly it as a matter
of courtesy).

So how about doing something constructive and try to work out how such a
system would propably be developed? Let\'s not discuss whether or not it
should be in the _main_ Traveller universe and instead look at how _a_
Traveller universe would look if drop tanks are a fact of life and perhaps
put some figures on it too.

If this is going to work, we\'ll have to agree on a set of basic premises.
Let\'s not discuss implications and ramifications until then. I\'ll start
out by listing the facts as they appear to me.
 
L-Hyd drop ships have been in service in the interior from some time
between 1090 and 1095 ["...for the last dozen years" according to a
newsbrief dated 097-1105].

General Shipyards on Regina begins making drop tanks in 1105. The tanks
are supposed to be used to support the special high-capacity liners of
Tukera.

A \'high-capacity liner\' is a liner with no interior tankage. It therefore
needs drop tank facilities to support all its jumps.

Drop tanks are not reusable. [This one I don\'t believe in myself, but it\'s
what the press release says].

In early june 1106 the 800 T liner TRIMKHANA-BRILLIANCE was lost with 217
lives (and 4 survivors) due to an explosion believed caused by the failure
of a drop tank to separate properly. Tukera lines suspended high-capacity
service to Regina for an indefinite period.

Drop tanks cost... whatever _High Guard_ says they cost (I forget).

Unefined fuel costs Cr100/T at the starport. Refined fuel costs whatever
is realistic. 

 How about it? Any takers? Any other basic premises I\'ve missed? Any of
mine you disagree with?

Maybe they could do gatling guns. But I\'d wonder about even that. You
see, they had iron, not steel. Except for damascus steel which is just
about the *worst* thing you could use for a gun barrel. (Yes, I know
they used to use it in shotgun barrels, but those can *only* use black
powder or you wind up digging shrapnel out of your face).

Heck, just teach them how to build a decent traverse mount for the
"automatic ballista" they actually *had*. It\'s problem was being *too*
consistent. It\'d hit the same point with every shot. So you\'d hit one,
maybe too men, they the rest would avoid going thru the point it was
hitting. 

But with a way to change the point of aim *easily* (or maybe even make
it traverse automatically back and forth) it\'d be a nice weapon. Battle
dress would stop it. But as I recall the lesser types of armor in Trav,
I think any of them would get you turned into a shish-kabob. :-)

I\'d say that the locals have a say. If a low tech world wants to be
left alone, it gets amber of red zone. If it doesn\'t want to join, but
is okay with contact, it\'ll eventually join, barring *major* cultural
conflicts with doing so. So the empire can *afford* to be nice.

Good question. I\'d guess that all the Imperium *needs* is somebody big
enough and stable enough that if they put in a starport it won\'t get
overrun by nasty neighbors. So for example on Earth, they\'d be willing
to put one in if the US wanted to join, and Russia and china didn\'t
actively object. If there were objections from somebody that
"mattered", they\'d likely wait until the objectors came around. After
all, why borrow trouble?

The Imperium doesn\'t appoint ambassadors *at all* to *member* planets.
To the Zhodani, to the K\'kree, and other multi-world starfaring groups,
yes. *Maybe* to independent planets. Ambassadors are appointed to
represent a sovreign state to it\'s "equals". Not to subdivisions of
itself. 

What the Imperium may do is appoint a consul or governor or some such.

I\'d say your best bet is to think: TNS=CNN

So they\'ll have correspondents all over the place and bb"bureaus" or
"branches" on most important planets, and at least "stringers" in the
"unimportant" places. They may accept items from local media, but
they\'ll do their own reporting. They may even use the video and supply
their own audio if the original is too biased (in their opinion). 

But most news is of zero interest off planet, and even when it is, it\'s
likely to be of less interest the farther away you get. I expect that
the news will be broken down into "sections" far more than it is now. 

Think of a "menu" structured like this:

1. Stories affecting multiple empires/goverments
2. stories affecting individual empires/governments
   a. local
   b. other
      (list)
3. Stories affecting regions
   a. local
   b. other
4. stories affecting worlds
   a. local
   b. other
5. "local" stories


And all the "other" choices would have appropriate sub-menus. 

So by default you\'d hear about stuff like Zhodani/Imperial trouble. And
about "Imperial" stories. Ditto for stuff in your "region" of space,
and the planet you are on, and local stuff on planet. But you can dig
up other stuff if you go to the trouble. Though the availability of
news is probably related to the size of the area affected, and how far
away it is. Trying to find out about the school board election in some
city on Regina while you are on the Solomani border is gonna take some
work.

I\'ll have to support David here. The one example of implementation of a
drop tank system we know of is in the Regina system, and that was solely
a matter for two private enterprises, Tukera and General Shipyards. Tukera
had one or more 800 T high-capacity ships serving some world within range
of Regina (but outside Regina Subsector) and contracted with General
Shipyards to begin building suitable drop tanks. Once tanks were available,
Tukera changed their schedules to have Regina included in the network.

>Touchy, at best - if the new system is that much more cost-effective, it is

Very true. But the operative words are \'over time\'. There is a pre-existent
fleet of normal ships which will still be worth something. While buying a
new high-capacity ship to replace a 40 year old normal ship is indisputably
cost-effective, the same may not be true if you have to dispose of a 
brand new ship. And remember that a high-capacity ship is only cost-effective
if you can find the cargo or passengers to fill it.

>If it\'s not, it will take a long time for it to get a toehold. 

I would suspect about 30 years for a complete changeover on the main trade
routes, but that\'s just a guess. BTW. if drop tanks are non-reusable (as
the canon states they are) jump-1 and perhaps jump-2 traffic will not use
them and the savings for higher-jump traffic will be somewhat lower. Only
trouble is, I find it hard to believe that drop tanks couldn\'t be made
reusable.

Pure passenger liners will be screwed in that event, but high-capacity
freighters will be able to install demountable tanks and function as
old style freighters for the duration.

	It probably depends on the domain. I do not think that a world close 
to Core would really have a say, but if a world in the Marches, close 
to the SW of the Zhodani decided not to belong to the 3I, forcing it 
in could cause an interstellar conflict, so no way. So, prebably 
there is no established Imperium-wide policy. Thus, you can find all 
sorts of in-between attitudes. One domain (or sector)  could 
rely in economic pressure, another in military action, another not 
care at all.

>2. On a balkanized world, what happens if some nations want to be
>members, and others don\'t?

	Uh... very good question. It raises even better ones. Suppose a 
nation is a member, and a neigboring one is not. And suppose these 
two nations wage war. If they both were imperial, the 3I would do 
nothing, except to care for the Imperial Laws of War. But, in this 
situation, the member nation could conceivably ask for assistence 
against an external threat...

>3. Let us assume that a balkanized world may be part member and part
>not. Does the Imperium appoint an ambassador to each nation, or one 
>to the entire world?

	That should depend on population. I recall a Challenge article about 
Law in the Imperium which stated that Minsitry of Justice agents were 
appointed in the following way: one per planet, plus one per 100,000 
inhabitants. It specifically stated that on Balkanized, not high-pop 
world, one agent could be responsible for several nations. This could 
be the way to proceed also por Diplomats.
	IMTU, there is usually an Imperial Ambassador, but if the planet is 
balkanized, each significative nation has an imperial Consul, all of 
them responsible before the Ambassador. Of course, if there are two 
big, important, rival nations, appointing one Ambassador to one and 
only one consul to the other could cause diplomatic problems. So, 
conceivably, under specific circumstances, there could be several 
Ambassadors to a single world (just imagine the two nations are at 
war!).

	As I understand it, the TNS is a private organization, that will 
care a lot about profits. And the profits of such "News Agencies" 
come from selling its services to the individual journals, 
newspapers, TV-channels and so on, i.e. the locals. The TNS will work 
as Reuters, Efe, and such agencies: appointing reporters to important 
worlds, sending reporters to where the news are, and so on. But, 
usually, you obtain the news from some middlemen: a journal, a TV 
channel... all of them would prefer there own reporters for the local 
news, is just that they cannot afford reporters for other places.
	And about the other way around, i.e. the TNS relying on local 
agencies... it seems likely, if it just happens that they have no 
reporter on planet.
	Example: In an out-of-the-way, Pop 7 planet, war erupts suddenly 
between two nations. The TNS has no permanent reporter there, but it 
sells the news  to local channels. So, the first news they get about 
th war are through this local channels, and that is what they rely to 
other worlds, immediately. But, afterwards, a reporter is sent, and 
they start relying their own news.
	So, probably the first news of a new event on a backwater planet run 
a certain risk of being biased, even the ones relied thorugh TNS... 
corrections by TNS in further reports could be likely.

I seriously doubt this. Even a Gatling type weapon requires the ability to
machine something to absolute tolerances ... and, without machine tools, the
Romans simply could not do this. No way. And that\'s not even discussing the
limited amount of high quality steel they were able to produce anyway.

Without something like a Steam Engine, well, no, its just not going to happen.
Even then, they are several steps away from the steps needed to make a
machinegun.

For example, it has been estimated that the Iron output of the entire Roman
Empire at its height was on the order of 2500-5000 tons per year. Steel would
have been a tiny proportion of that.

Then we need the machines to make the cartridge cases, the mercury fulminate
primers etc. No, not even close.

They would (as per De Camp\'s classic, "Lest Darkness Fall") be capable of
producing a cast bronze cannon easily enough, and gunpowder is even easier.
Muskets would be very crude, but a matchlock would not be beyond their
capabilities. A Flintlock would, though, I suspect ... either that, or it would
be *very* expensive.

A Star Encased in Diamond

April 29 - It\'s too early to know for sure, but astronomer Steve
Kawaler and his worldwide team of researchers may have found
a diamond as big as Earth. 
    The diamond, if it is one, is really a nearby star with a rather
dull name-BPM37093. 
    For several days now, large telescopes scattered across the
Southern Hemisphere have joined with the Hubble Space
Telescope in studying the star, which Kawaler believes is
encapsulated in a layer of pure crystallized carbon. 
    Here on Earth, diamonds are created deep underground by
intense heat and pressure, which crystallizes carbon atoms into
the gems adored by royalty and paupers alike.
    For three decades, scientists have theorized that a similar
process turns stars called white dwarfs into massive chunks of
crystallized carbon. That would make them giant diamonds, but
no one has been able to offer proof. 
    Kawaler\'s team needs at least a couple of weeks to analyze
their data, but "so far, so good," says the professor of physics and
astronomy at Iowa State University. Preliminary signals from the
star are just what the scientists expected if BPM37093 is in fact a
diamond. 
    "It\'s a little more massive than our sun, which is about a million
times more massive than the Earth, so it\'s quite a hunk," Kawaler
says.

Whatever the answer to this is, it\'s a pretty slow process around the beginning of the second millenium. Look at the Spinward Marches: Mora was settled in 60, and a lot of \'present\' Imperial territory was settled/occupied in the following couple of hundred years. Since then, nothing much has happened.

The \'1100\' Third Imperium doesn\'t seem very expansionistic - maybe because it\'s reached a critical mass.

Still, I think there\'ll be much local variation. Most planets may not be worth conquering, so the local populace have the final say. Some planets, though, may be very attractive and relatively safe to incorporate into the Imperium; in such cases I don\'t suppose the locals will have much say in the matter.

By 1100, I don\'t think there\'ll be many of these worlds left, as they will all have been absorbed by some large interstellar state, or exist as neutral in a balance of power between to large states.

IMTU a member of the Imperium is a state, defined in some way not further specified. A balkanized world will usually have several states recognized as being such, and so will be elegible as members of the Imperium. I see no reason why a complete planet has to a single member.

Another thing is this: As some facts indicate that the Third Imperium doesn\'t tolerate neutral worlds _within_ it\'s borders, it will probably neither tolerate neutral states on a balkanized world, if that world lies deep within the Imperium.

On the fringes, on the other hand, getting some states to join may eventually persuade a whole world.

On major worlds or places where current events justify this, TNS will of course have one or more correspondents. On backwater worlds it will probably contract with one or more reputable news agencies as a source of information.

Remember, seen from a cosmopolitan point of view, backwater areas are _per definition_ not interesting, so why have a correspondent there? You don\'t need to cover that world - you just keep an eye out for the occasional sensation.

That would only result in the new system being present in other domains

Well, in that case one would just adapt the new system to war affected
areas, which I feel is quite doable.

If you look at the map, the "safes" was most of the Imeperium.
Commerce raiding was in specific areas (to some degree the
areas where stuff was being brought to the front).  Nor do
I know of any quotes that say trade "largely stopped" (there
may be, but I don\'t know).  There was still logistics and,
in fact, ships being impressed for logistics probably would
have more to do with stopping trade.  In any
case, the idea that trade can be stopped by sufficient
commerce raiding wasn\'t the point.  If you have an area
where all trade is being suppressed, I will agree that
the non-existant trade won\'t be converted to use new
technology.

No.  The Imperium will use it as an excuse to raise taxes, or
require megacorps to support their own ships....

Commerce raiding is, by definition, not applying sufficient
force to actually take over systems or destroy planetary
installations.  If that was true then commerce raiding
would cause massive devestation on worlds and wouldn\'t
be presented as affecting just trade.

I don\'t think that a raiding fleet passing through is suficient
to even destroy areas under plentary protection.

I agree that all costs get weighted in.  But the precieved

Yes, I was right.  This is something that is a point of view
and not fact.  Many of the assumption that those analyses
were fundamentally based on were disputted.

The \'damascus\' used for shotgun barrels was made by a different technique
from the damascus used in knives and swords. The shotgun barrels were made
by coiling wire around a mould and hammering it until it heat welded
together. Knife steel is made by folding and hammering and folding and
hammering and ... \'Knife damascus\' is thus much better bonded than \'gun
damascus\', and would probably do OK for low pressure smokeless firearms,
though the barrel wear would be ferocious. Actually good iron would be OK
for a large calibre blackpowder gatling, but it would br very expensive to
feed. The Romans would\'ve had to hand-make all those little brass
cartridges, and even if they used the old laquered paper ones they\'d still
have to have made the brass bases by hand.

I imagine the Spinward Rush resulted in some worlds being hit with massive

repeated colony failures resulting in the fairly low populations seen in
the classic era.

Being hemmed in on all sides doesn\'t help.  Consider that the Zhodani have
achieved their objectives with all five Frontier wars.. keeping the
Imperium paranoid and out of Zho space.

For most interior worlds, it will be a fait accompli.  Surrounded by the
Imperium for dozens of parsecs, why not join?  On the edges, the question
depends on locality.  Worlds on the Solomani Rim will be under
extraordinary pressure to make a choice, whereas in the Marches or along
the trailing edge independence is a much more viable option.

Or be too small to bother with.  One thing I learned from playing 5FW was
that the vast majority of worlds are worthless.  Experiments with PE bear
this out.  They are too small to make more than a ripple in interstellar
commerce.  To put it another way, there\'s a reason why no US Presidential
candidate has ever made a campaign swing through Saipan and American Samoa.

I would think there is some low limit for what constitutes an acceptable
member "state."  IMTU, political entities with Populations of 6 or less are
not full members of the Imperium, but rather treated much like the US
treats it\'s possessions.

The reasoning behind this is economic survival.  A small colony is at the
mercy of the interstellar carriers.. imagine what would happen without some
oversight.  On a balkanized world, this would protect very small states
from abuse.  Picture what would have happened if the Chinese occupation
force in Tibet was met by the 789th Marine Regiment!

I\'m curious, which facts?  Other than the seeming lack of these worlds.
I\'d think that simple market pressure, coupled with the obvious advantages
of membership, would bring all but the most extreme xenophobic societies
into the Imperial fold.

As someone has pointed out, "ambassador" is the wrong word.  A Consul might
be appointed to each member state.  The long term goal would probably be to
forge a planetary union, since that\'s much better for business.

IMTU, the TNS acts like one of the wire services.  It purchases stories
from other organizations and freelance journalists.  Remember that the TNS
is the "USA Today" of Imperial news; a quick concise look at *major*
events.  A story that prompted riots and the fall of a planetary government
in the Hinterworlds might not even rate with the Spinward Marches editorial
board, whereas a more "local" (i.e., sector wide) information would be run.

>Remember, seen from a cosmopolitan point of view, backwater areas are _per

need to cover that world - you just keep an eye out for the occasional
sensation.

In Larry Bond\'s novel, "Vortex", a reporter is sent to South Africa because
of a screw-up.. where he is caught up in a US-Cuban-RSA conflict.
Sometimes the backwaters can become *very* interesting, indeed..

I think everyone\'s hanging up here (oddly enough) on the High-tech-ness
of the Gatling guns of the 1800\'s. 

Paper wrapped cartridges would be perfectly usable in a low ROF low tech
gun like we\'re speaking of, heck, you could probably even figure out a
way of having the mechanism cut off a small part of the breech end of
the cartridge to make the priming charge for a matchlock.

It\'s going to have a ROF of only a few shots per minute, and jam often,
but even that\'s a long ways beyond even the late 18th century.

The big trick is to figure out how to make efficient and usable
breechloaders, as muzzleloaders are far simpler to make, but _much_ more
time consuming to reload.

I think the hangup people are having here is thinking 

Roman era machinegun = bronze age Uzi.

The problem is that without the brass cartridge base the breech won\'t seal
properly, and the escaping gases will erode the breech area very quickly,
which would quickly render the gun non-functional.

Gatling used paper cartridges. It used a reall Rube Goldberg arrangement. Each
paper cartridge was placed in a steel container. This container also had the
nipple for a percussion cap. These containers were thrown into the hopper (I
assume with enough care to make sure the bullet end faced the breeches!). and
cammed into a barrel breech and the cap was ignited. The now empty container
was now cammed into the ejection port and spit out. Thus this container acted
as both cartridge case and breech. To work well, each barrel breech had to be
reamed out so that a slight misalignment would still allow a shot. Needless to
say, this weapon was a dog (although it still should have been adopted. I
shudder to think what Bobbie Lee would have done it each US regiment had one
or two tripod mounted support Gatlings). The brianics saw how much better
brass was (ala the Spencer, Henry, Burnside, etc.) and made the model 1865 a
brass cartridge weapon. This is the one we see in the cowboy movies (or it\'s
later cousins). Of course, this fine weapon was too late for the war.

One line of firearms that seemed to fall into a dead end (to move slightly
off of Roman machine guns) was a rifle design I saw in a magazine. It
appeared to be a revolver built into a long arm. I can\'t find the article so
if any of the firearms experts on the list have any infomation I\'d
appriciate hearing from you. This always seemed like a good possibility for
a "repeating" rifle at a slightly lower tech that the carbine. The revolving
pistol came out some time before the repeating rifle IIRC. A six shot rifle,
even if hand loaded black powder, seems like an advantage in my book.

Issue #33 has the article defining the background of IRIS.

I have some newbie questions. Since this is probably old news for all of
you, maybe private email responses might be better for all. The problems
surface due to misinterpretation on some of the sentences in the book. I am
writing from Spain.

Character creation process: getting into college or any other academy. The
book states that if the PC has two characteristics better by two points
than the requirements to enter a learning institution, the admission is
automatic. This number, is it the DM roll (5 or less for college, for
example) or the modifiers for high Intelligence, Social Status, etc. (such
as +2 to DM if Intelligence is 8 or higher)?

Can a PC attend college more than once? There doesn\'t seem to be an age
limit, as in the other institutions.

After the educational period is over, the PC goes into the workforce. In
our particular case, a PC chooses to become a Rogue. He passes the
admission roll and serves for a 4-year term. After that, he fails the
Continuance roll and decides to become an Agent, which he does passing the
Admission roll with the -2 MD modifier (for changing to a second different
career). However, he fails the Injury roll and only serves a three-year
term.

When he is an Agent, can he try rolls for Comission and/or Promotion or
must he serve the FULL 4-year term to be allowed those rolls?

After he is dismissed as an Agent, he chooses to become a Rogue again after
a three year lapse. Can he try to do that, or since he was not continued
three years ago, he may not choose that line of work ever again?

If he attempts to become a Rogue again, should he roll with no penalties
(as Rogue is his first career anyway) or must he roll with a -3 modifier
(since he is switching from being an Agent)?

Thanks in advance.

Hello,
  I have to agree with your assessment. Further, cannon would
be the militarily most important increment of this development,
as it wasn\'t until the late 1600\'s that firearms completely
replaced infantry melee arms.

  It would have been around `85 when I had the Shriekers (A:10?)
get the basis of this technology from a particularly corrupt
player/character (your pick). That would have had some interesting
repercussions eventually.

        Yours truly,

    'body' => 'Well, I did some work on the whole question of drop tanks systems (or high
capacity ships, as the TNS newsbriefs call them) last night, based on the
premises I posted yesterday, and here are the results so far:

First off, I wondered what kind of ship the TRIMKHANA-BRILLIANCE was. How
high a jump rating? To decide that I tried to decide what the other end
of its jump from Regina was. The 097-1105 newsbrief says that the new
service will link Regina with \'the interior\'. This implies a whole high
capacity route stretching back through Deneb, Corridor, and Vland. I think
it plausible that the link would enter the Spinward Marches at Mora
(admittedly, I haven\'t examined the route back through Deneb) and that it
would go from Mora to Rhylanor. That makes jump-6 the most likely, since
that would allow a ship to go the 10 parsecs from Mora to Rhylanor in two
jumps wia Natoko, another high-population world. A jump-5 ship would have
to go through Vanejen and Vanejen don\'t have the facilities to manufacture
drop tanks.

[Aside: A mail contract with this ship would improve on X-boat performance
between Mora and Rhylanor by 7 weeks, at least if one accepts the official
X-boat routes portrayed on various maps of the Marches].

Anyway, I decided to assume that the TRIMKHANA-BRILLIANCE was a jump-6
ship and design it using QSDS 1.5.

Calculations do not include revenue from the 24 T of extra cargo space
that is left over with the average load of High passengers.

By straight Traveller rules a Mid Passage would therefore cost Cr14,000
and a High Passage Cr17,500. This is cheaper (and faster) than going by
regular jump-3 ship _provided_ you can find 4000 people per year who
want\'s to pay more than a year\'s income for an average citizen to take
the trip.

The link from Rhylanor to Regina presents its own problem. It can be done
in two jumps, but none of the possible intermediate systems are capable
of building drop tanks (unless one assumes that a system can have a Class
C starport yet still be able to manufacture drop tanks; not an entirely
unreasonable assumption, since drop tanks are far simpler than complete
spaceships), nor do any of them seem likely to generate much traffic on
their own bat. IMO most traffic would be through traffic from Regina to
Rhylanor and vice versa.

[Another aside: The ship I designed have room for 148 passengers and crew.
The TRIMKHANA-BRILLIANCE was carrying 221 people at the time of the
disaster. Evidently Tukera allowed double occupancy of some of the
staterooms, which would give an \'Economy Passage\' costing Cr8,000.]

This came up on the Space:1889 list a while back. There\'s a *reason*
why these were never very popular. One fairly common "failure mode" of
percussion revolvers is for all the chambers to go off at once. Often
due to flaming gases and powder from the intended cahmber getting into
the others (remember, the cylinder didn\'t fit *that* tightly!).

On a pistol, this means one round goes down the barrel, two on each
side come out of the cylinders *beside* the barrel go off downrange
right next to the barrel. And the final round slams into the frame, but
doesn\'t really hurt anything, other than giving a rather sharp jolt to
the whole gun.

Now picture yourself using a revolving rifle when this happens.
Remember that your off hand will be holding the stock *in front* of the
cylinder...

Four bullets will really do a number on your hand, won\'t they?

One of the folks on the list was a re-enactor would actually had this
happen when firing a friend\'s revolver at a target. You couldn\'t *pay*
him to use a revovling percussion rifle.

And once you go to metallic cartridges, there\'s no advantage to a
revolver mechanism other than the gatling.

I\'m not so sure. The problem is that the stuff isn\'t *uniformly*
strong. And you can\'t really make a decent sized *cylinder* or "rod" of
it. Even if you could, what would you bore it with? And since the
layers *wouldn\'t* be concentric, but more apt to run across the width
of the barrel, that gives natural planes for it to come apart on.

Were they able to cast iron in that size chunk? If not, they can\'t make
a safe barrel. Cast bronze will do nicely for cannon though. And case
shot will deal nicely with charging barbarians.

(Trying to picture a Roman "turtle" formation that\'s hiding a couple of
brass or bronze cannons inside)

Oh yeah, most of us have no idea how to build *the* most important Post
Roman invention. The horse collar. That\'s *why* they used so much slave
labor. No way to harness the horses for the work. The "harness" for
chariots went across the horse\'s *neck*. Put a heavy load on, and the
horse chokes. That\'s why the chariots were so light, and they needed so
many horses to move them. 

Heavy wagons were moved by oxen, which are too slow moving for combat
(the way you harness *them* is different and won\'t work with horses).
I don\'t know how to design a horse collar (the insides are supposed to
be more complex than the outside looks), but I know that it\'s thought
to have developed from camel saddles.

Another big invention was the stirrup. That\'s why all the Romans used
horses for was scouts, officers mounts, and light lancers/archers.

I\'d expect the Imperium to have anticipated this when drawing up the
agreement admitting the nation(s) on the world to the Imperium. There\'d
be times when they\'d intervene (US defending Grenada against Cuba). And
times when they wouldn\'t (US *not* intervening in Czechoslovakia during
their revolt in the 50s/60s).

These fired what amount to heavy javelins. They were hopper fed(!) and
operated by a crank. One or at most two men on the crank.

I\'ve heard of a couple of designs that were used, but were clumsy (the
screw-plug breech loader used by Ferguson\'s men in the Revolutionary
war) and others are ideas that might work fine but would require a
*total* redesign of the flintlock mechanism, as they need to use the
space where it is. For example, if you can put wadding *after* the
charge, a bolt action would work. You\'d need to move the primer pan
forward and like I said, the lock mechanism would be a *mess*.

It\'s *not* the same amount. The passengers board the ship, it takes a
few *hours* to get 100 diameters out. They jump and emerge (usually) a
week later and take another few hours to get from the exit point to the
planet. Total, 1 week plus a few hours. Thus Cr2000/week.

The problem is that I don\'t know how *much* is needed. And I don\'t know
enough about how such filter cansister would have to be constructed
(and thus how much they\'d cost over and above the cost of the raw
materials).

In the misjump rules, you roll for jump duration. 1d6 weeks. At least
in CT. And I thought someone posted that MT was the same.

The other DGP material seemed not to be consistent to this one. I remember
the Megacorp logos in MT Journal #3, which had SuSAG and SH (Sternmetal

By the time, all physical units ought to be defined through physical
properties. But they\'re still related to the original standards, as you
try to express them by fundamental units. That\'s getting you still a error
difference.

Now for the Trav universe: Wouldn\'t it be better to use fundamental units,
such as the time light needs to cross an amount of space given by the
smallest amount found in subatomic? That would NOT be playable, but the
idea always came to me how you could exchange units with an other culture
without standards. Think of the Vilani - did they ever adapt the Solomani
units? You know HOW they are conservative ... and the Zhodani still don\'t
want to know about.

Another question came to me: if you build a ship hypersonic, how do the
scoops in that case work? I understand hyper- or supersonic hulls in a way
to avoid air friction, but the scoops would negate this effect, as they
have to collect the same \'air\' in this case?

Staying at the \'streamlining\' model, such a ship only has to be able to
fly through the atmosphere and collect fuel, not to fly at higher speed
than is useable for this task.

For some reason this sounds to me like a Vargr scientist. [Only a Vargr
would wear a diamond the size of a sun.] This implies a Vargr solution.
Scooping is right out, obviously. However, what would it take to induce a
solar flare? Maybe take a relativistic rock [sorry guys] and fling it at
the star? Maybe an anti-matter bomb? [Aren\'t all Vargr scientists capable
of synthesising anti-mattter? It\'s the only way they can get any respect.]
Maybe wait for one to occur naturally? [Do White Dwarfs flare?] If you
could induce a flare that that would, doubtless, fling enough diamond out
that they could enact a merry chase collecting it.
Slightly more drastic would be to attempt to induce the star to go nova.
You would have to wait a few years for the plasma to cool enough. Maybe the
Vargr sole (or thought he stole) a nifty Darrian item. Maybe the Darrians
are in league with him. Or maybe optical studies revealed that a nearby
white dwarf had this diamond corona and its _companion_ star was about to
go nova. He wants the PCs to jump in and play tag with the expanding plasma
(since it should have blown years ago as their observations are
light-delayed) and try to track down a diamond asteroid. Just hope it still
isn\'t superheated.
Another idea might be to take a iron-core asteroid and maneuver it into an
orbit that puts it on a close approach with the star. You know how there
are industrial processes to give a diamond coat to objects? Well if you put
this asteroid through a few highly eliptical orbits, then scrape off its
diamond coat.
Slightly more adventerous would be to send your ship, [or an empty hull,
for wimps] on a similar eliptical approach and diamond coat it. Gee, what
armour factor would that be? That also gives the connection to the
military-industrial complex that Vargr\'s seem to need to get anything done.

But, odds are it is going to be a helluva lot easier and cheaper to just
synthesise the damn diamonds (we can only improve on Cubic Zirchronium).
Not that this will deter anyone...

Um, how about conservation of angular momentum? Seems like you break at
least one natural law here.

Electric braking of spinning stuff on earth works by transferring the
angular momentum to big old earth.

I was wondering the same thing back in March, and also designed a version
of the _Trimkhana-Brilliance_ (see digest v1998.n270, March 12).  I made a
different assumption; that it was jump-4, same as the Long Liner (Tukera
supposedly ran routes along xboat lines; _Traveller Adventure_).  Ship\'s
complement was broken down as 24 crew, 48 high, 72 middle, and 80 low
for a total of 224 at full capacity.  Cargo was limited to that needed 
by high passengers. 

I also used QSDS with Book 5 drop tank rules, and the results seemed to
come out well.  I\'ve thought about making a second pass using only High
Guard or Book 2, but I expect that it\'ll work in High Guard at least.

The TNS article mentioned that the "port inboard tank" failed; so maybe
four tanks make sense?  :)  Just a thought.

It\'s hard to do this with mass - you can\'t measure the mass of any sort of
particle or atom accurately enough to make a real mass standard out of it,
at least not yet. The big-lump-of-platinum, awkward though it is, remains
the best bet.

Possibly...or a unit system in which the speed of light equals 1 (or a 
power of 10), which simplifies a lot of equations.

Another traveller question is what units Traveller technology needs that
we don\'t have yet. Someone on TTL suggested the "Hilbert" as the unit of
jump potential...there would be semi-fundamental units for induced gravity
fields and induced nuclear force, too.

The Royal Navy have recently reinstated Commodore as a one star rank to go
with the other services one star ranks.  If you want I can get the article
where the Admiral of the Fleet describes why in the Broadsheet.

The Elizabethans had cannon that were breech loading with a preloaded
chamber that was inserted and forced up against the back of the barrel by a
wedge, thus circumventing the seal erosion problem. They went out of favour
because of their limited power and short service life.

The thing is that none of these actions would work for a machinegun, though
some might work for a multi-barreled mount. I\'m far from convinced that
Roman metallurgy was up to making the springs for reliable flintlocks, either.

Modern barrels are made by forming them over a mold (mandrel?) often cold,
and then tempering them. It might be possible to do something similar with
hot iron. The reason I think that knife style damascus would be OK for
black powder muskets is that it is better than the shotgun style stuff.

You don\'t have to cast barrels, it\'s just safer. Cast bronze would probably
do OK for a musket or gatling, too.

Apparently a horse without a good collar produces about the same work for
the food it eats as a man does, and they\'re harder to look after.

Their horses wern\'t very good, either.

David Drake (\'The General\' series) postulates a very interesting way of getting
a gatling gun - like weapon, without having the industrial capacity that you say
is necessary.

However, getting the idea in the first place is the 90% of the work!

ObTrav: I\'ve always thought that there should be some advances (J-Drive is not a
bad example, as per Aslan) that requires a higher TL to create, but a lower TL
to produce and maintain. IMTU, I\'ve put this into some play by allowing 1-2 TL
drop in the required production TL in the TL 8-14 range), once the desired
device has been developed and introduced.  I also like to cobble up some
\'legacy\' devices on occaision - primitive versions of devices described in some
of the equipment books.

Perhaps, but the best engineers the Romans had were pretty friggin\' good. The
Pantheon is still standing, pretty much intact, over 2000 years later, and not
a single bit of rebar in it.

Gunpowder was easily within their chemical knowledge.

Well, there is the case of Nero\'s emerald monacle...

Legend has it that a master glassmaker presented a large transparent glass
bowl to one of the Emperors. When asked what made it special, the glassmaker
hurled it to the ground, picked it up, and _hammered out the dent_. The
emperor announced that this would put all the glassmakers out of work, and
there was enough unemployment as it was -- then had the craftsman executed.
 
Douglas Berry adds:

The (possibly slave) craftsmen at Alexandria that built Heron\'s stuff were
certainly up to the task (this is the same bunch that built the steam engine
toys everybodies heard about). They built a catapult that worked on
_compressed air pston/spring/shockabsorber thingies_  and a windlass-operated
magazine fed catapult that was rejected because it put all its bolts in the
same spot (a 20th century reconstruction actually split one bolt with another
fired from the same machine) and was thus considered only useful for defending
bridges. Of course, we are talking maybe a dozen really talented craftsmen,
who have no clue about interchangeable parts and mass production, building
each one as a one-off. 

With gunpowder, however, and the techniques used for bell/statue casting in
bronze, cannons and crude hand guns are not out of the question. And grenades,
petards, mines, etc. Would have made them even better at sieges then they
already were...

Leonard Erickson continues:
>Heck, just teach them how to build a decent traverse mount for the
>"automatic ballista" they actually *had*. 

They had a decent traverse mount. The problem was the notion of sweeping the
weapon back and forth as it was firing (a problem not limited to the Romans
BTW -- 
study the employment of 90% of the early 19th century machineguns why is it
that conservatism is inherent to the military mind?). The Romans had decent
steel (well, small quantities of it, anyway -- see any decent book on Roman
military equipment), BTW. They didn\'t know _why_ one batch was better than
another, or how to reproduce the good stuff consistently.

Re Stirrups: Read Equus: The Horse in the Roman World, by Ann Hyland. Nice
discussion of everything you can do _without_ a stirrup from horseback.

While this is plausible, it completely changes Traveller military and trade

I am designing a ship at TL-21 as an exercise and potential bait for may

enough output powerplan could provide enough energy in a short enough span
of time to remove the need for jump fuel.  My thought was having two power
plants, one for normal ship activities and one only for the J-Drive and
potential emergency situations.  Considering the volume to power output of
the higher end plants, would this be possible?

I have some calculations I made everal years ago base on the references to
the Black Globe energy sinks being the J-Drive sinks, and extrapolated how
many megawatts to the cubic meter, and then created a powerplant that could
generate that level of output within fifteen minutes to half an hour.  It
seemed to be possible due to the statement I read where a ship with the
jump capacitors full could make an emergency jump if necessary.

It probably had a lot to do with the Solomani conquering the Vilani and
then saying "You WILL use our systems of measurement."  The Vilani
probably complied with great reluctance.  Then a few hundred years later
the Rule of Man collapsed.  A few Vilani radicals then said "Hey, lets
change back to the traditional systems of measurement our ancestors used

Its *really* stretching things to call Hiero\'s engine a "steam engine" ... it

Nope, its a Mitrailleuse ... a bodgy French design ... and, if you have read the
series closely, you will note that there\'s one scene where the CO of the Arabs
(not the crazy brother, the general) is talking to the owner of a Gunmaking
concern that has been raided by the Byzantines (er, "Civil Government") ... and
he says that it will take months to replace the *MACHINE TOOLS*.

Its always a good thing to read a book *carefully*!

And, of course, the Civil Government Rifle is basically a Lee Enfield or Mauser
clone ... also requiring machine tools to make.

Sorry, your comparison doesn\'t stand up ;-(

>However, getting the idea in the first place is the 90% of the work!

Nope, having the right machines is.

In MT TLs above 16 gave a reduction in the fuel required.

TL    Fuel required
16    VD x 5
17    VD x 4
18    VD x 3
19    VD x 2
20    VD x 1
21+   VD x 0.5

where VD = the jump drive\'s volume. Rmember that MT/TNE jump drives have a
volume equal to: (Jump number + 1) x (ship\'s volume) / 100

I\'ve always assumed that this is because more and more of the energy
requirements could be met through the use of antimatter conversion, etc,
but I ahve no idea how that would work, and I notice that the reduced
consumption disappeared in FF&S1.

Me, I like the "for every 2 points you hit by, they get another bullet in
them" for multiple bullets into a target on burst fire, and "take a
difficulty level, and roll against everybody in a 30 degree field of fire"
for full auto.

Note that this makes combat exceedingly deadly. As it should be.

OK. As I have said before, Fernand Braudel is God.

Braudel, The Structures of Everyday Life : Civilisation and Capitalism vol
1 ( Collins, 1981) has a great discussion of sources of energy between the
15th and 18th century (the book should be in any half-assed university
library, and many public libraries).

Page 337 cites 75 N as being one manpower, with a horse as being 10 times
that.

Page 345 cites a horse being worth four slaves in Roman times, and having
the horse collar quadruple their productivity (incidentally whats the
current status of Lynn White\'s Medieval Technology and Social Change ... I
have heard rumours it has been almost totally discredited).

The only rider with using horses is you have to have food horses eat in
ready quantities (not good in very cold climates, for example). Humans are
also more flexible in the work they can do.

Because up until the Twentieth Century, the military men who were executed
tended to be executed for ignoring orders and/or doctrine, not for
following it.

Successful militaries also tend to fight the last war over and over again -
for example, look at how the USN is perfectly designed for re-fighting the
Pacific War over again.

It\'s suspected that it was used to plate cheap copper or brass jewelry
with gold. Thus it\'d be a secret, and when the artisans pulling off the
scam died out, the secret was lost.

They weren\'t *that* good. The reason their stuff is still standing is
that it\'s ridiculously overbuilt. They couldn\'t figure the stresses and
strains, so they just built as tough as they could afford to.

Remember how the Romans dedicated bridges. The chief enginner would be
in a boat floating under the centerspan as *heavy* wagons were driven
over the bridge. If it fell down, the engineer got clobbered. :-)

Probably *only* a legend, as malleability is a property of metals, and
metals *can\'t* be transparent (except for *very* thin films) has to do
with the electron shells of the atoms, and those are also what make it
malleable.

No, there are designs for hypersonic *jet* aircraft. The scoop designs
*use* the shockwaves to help compress the air going into the engine.

This has the potential to be interesting. 

I know from personal experience that CNN reports are biased. (Other
stations are too, mind you.) If you look at the stories covered by CNN you
can see a definate pattern, so using the TNS=CNN analogy gives you a
vehicle for quietly burying information. I could see TNS, for example,
never questioning the basic philosophy of Imperial government.

IMTU I would use the TNS=Reuters analogy more, though. CNN has it\'s own
stations, while I see TNS as supplying a news feed to local media outlets.

Sorry if I sounded condescending or whatever it\'s just that Pournelle made
a big point out of this fact (that oxen are more expensive than slaves
until a good collar is invented) in "King Davids spaceship".

(A good read BTW, if you buy the standard notion of Pournelle that soldiers
in general and especially soldiers with extensive knowledge in the history
of warfare are automatically superior in to others.)

The official X-boat lines or a plausible set of X-boat lines?

Yes, of course. Low berths is a more orthodox explanation than double
occupancy. I wonder why I never even thought of them? I think it\'s 
because I dislike low berths and routinely operate with double occupancy
IMTU. For the official Traveller universe I suppose low berths is the
way to go. (But I\'m still not using them much IMTU). As for the jump-4,
what route did you decide on for the ship to get to and from Regina?

Maybe. How do you envisage the arrangement of the four tanks? Is there a
port outboard tank and how does it fit with the port inboard tank? Four
tanks would increase the cost by Cr20,000 per set, which is not much
compared to Cr664,000, but there would still have to be a logical benefit
from such an arrangement.

The benefit could simply be in the cost of shipping the tanks from their
fill-up point to the liner. If it cost 20.000 less to do this with four
tanks than two bigger tanks.

The only benefit I can think of for a multiple-tank system would be
fine-tuning the fuel load - give the ship the ability to carry half as
much fuel, say if one leg of the trip required a short jump. This would
especially matter if the drop tanks weren\'t reusable.

It\'s a theory from 1931, originated by Richard Lefebvre des Noëttes.  There
is some current controversy, but up until 1977 or so, it was textbook stuff.

Here\'s a web reference for those further interested:
http://scholar.chem.nyu.edu/~tekpages/harness.html
The basic horse harness theory, with references
http://scholar.chem.nyu.edu/~tekpages/texts/harncont.html
"The Great Horse Harness Controversy" wherein noted medievalists and
classicists call each other idiots

In general, I recommend these pages on medieval technology, although author
Paul Gans does have is detractors...
http://scholar.chem.nyu.edu/technology.html
Another interesting debate that is only there mentioned in passing is the
Medievalists debate over Feudalism ("the term \'feudalism\' means many
different things to different people and its use often contributes more
confusion than light to a discussion.").  Facinating when compared to the
Feudal Technocracy debate here...

And one other thing.  It generally makes Medievalists see red when you
refer to their period as "The Dark Ages."  The term is considered highly
misleading.

Har! Right.

Right now the _entire world_, save one country, is metric. Even
the English have bowed and gone metric. But not the US. Why?

Industry - imagine trying to get the _entire_ US auto industry
(or any US industry) to go from 5/16" nuts (or whatever) to 4mm 
nuts. It\'s not just a question of stubbornness (well, it is a bit, 
but) - it\'s a question of spending several trillions of dollars 
changing everything.

Which, I suppose, might not be much of an impediment to the rather
conquest-crazed Solomani at the beginning of the RoM... maybe the
RoM fell because of an unsuccessful measurement system conversion
campaign.

Is everyone in the Third Imperium forced to use adjustable wrenches
I wonder?

Well, discipline is one thing, tactics is another altogether.  That\'s all
pretty moot, however.  They just didn\'t put the guns in the right hands.

This is a very good point, but I would say only somewhat correct.  The
Pacific War between the allies and Japan was basically a carrier war (yeah,
tell that to the Marines), and U.S. naval doctrine is, in fact, based
around the carrier battle group.  But without any other "serious" carriers
in potential enemy navies (in the past 40 years or so) the focus turned to
the carrier as the easily/well defended platform for action ashore.

Meanwhile, your diagnosis is essentially correct.  We\'re all set for the
big carrier vs. carrier battle which cannot happen, just as we were ready
for the decisive battleship encounter in WWII.

Now to bring it around to the list topic;

In Traveller, based on Milieu, it is quite easy to generate some parallels
and steal blindly from history.  Perhaps the Vilani Imperium, focussed on
their Big Battleship doctrine failed to realize the power of the small,
high manuverability fighter (maybe one that uses HePlaR rather than
Thrusters).  This is a great way to bring down the 2nd Imperium, stagnated
by traditional tactics as they are, making the same mistakes in every
battle.

Perhaps the Third Imperium at milieu 0 has a distinctive advantage of
tactics over the pocket empires of the nearby subsectors.  Not many battles
actually need to be won if the news spreads that Cleon\'s forces have bested
one of the more powerful pocket empires in the region ("Hey, they had a
bigger fleet than we did, there\'s no way we can stand up to that sort of
firepower").

It could be something as simple as arming ships with primarily energy
weapons (possible thanks to the better power source) rather than missiles.
Lasers dedicated to point defense could reduce the primary offensive
"punch" of most "barbarian" naval forces (as they might be referred to
among the Imperial Navy officers).

In my own favorite Milieu, 1110; after the Fifth Frontier War, before any
rebellion baloney, the Imperial Navy still believes in big battleships
carrying massive spinal mounts and tons of armor and secondary weapons in
balance (missiles and lasers) plus a large complement of fighters.
Fighters at that point (at least under MT combat) are inefficient use of
hull space, except as sensor platforms, and it is quite expensive, on a
per-weapon factor basis, to have all those hundreds of expensive fighters
rather than the equivalent in laser batteries mounted on the hull, with all
that armor around the computer (which, in MT, is the primary factor
affecting rolls).

It is possible that a force of non-fighter carrying raiders-perhaps in the
smallest spinal mount carrying vessel possible-could defeat in battle the
equivalnet tonnage Imp Navy ship.  Of course, and again in a parallel of
history as it relates to WWII, the Imperial productive capacity, if turned
against one enemy, could be overwhelming  to any enemy.

In fact, I\'ve been wondering lately at the presence of Fusiona nd Plasma
turrets; they cannot be used at far range or beyond, there is no factor per
weapon advantage, they are still subject to sand, use the same tables for
to hit and damage as lasers, and take up more space.  Perhaps their
presence is related tot eh doctrine of the Imperial Navy, which used to
mount these close-range weapons in a previous war, where the technology of
the respective vessels led to close range shootouts, and where the armor
was less effective against energy weapons.

Or perhaps the energy weapon manufacturing lobby has an inordinate amount
of power.

Ponts to ponder...

My message agreed with this view;

Pete said;

>to cover the module\'s inertial comp and artificial gravity, which is also

as I implied, I believe the inertial comp and artificial gravity would need
to be installed in the module (where desired).  I feel that these
components need to be distributed throughout the space where they are
effective rather than being concentrated in one piece of equipment in
engineering or somewhere.

So your design is basically a 50 ton ship with a 30 ton "Cargo Bay" to
represent the module?  The modules you sent out were quite efficient
enough, but there should be a savings in weight and volume of the hull of
the module that does not need to be installed on the bridge/drive section;
of course it is easy to argue that any such savings are consumed in the
structural members required to hold the module and allow operation of the
drive/bridge section independently, which are not easily represented in the
MT esign system.

By the way, the modular cutter (from the MT encyclopedia) bridge section
has no staterooms, just two adequate seats.  A long duration cutter might,
however.

I\'d say cultural differences are much more pronounced than in the western
world today. There\'s no global telecommunication in Traveller and the
percentage of the population that actually travel among the stars is IMO
much smaller than that of overseas travelling today. The spreading of
recordings and whatnot could alleviate this but as TL differs so much
between planets you\'ll never reach a majority of the Imperial population
without cumbersome conversion into lower TL media (I\'m not speaking about
CD to LP conversion but rather how to convert Quake into printed form etc).

All this makes fun roleplaying as the players cannot be shure on how
cultures think and act - Just say no to Yanks in space!

(The term Yanks in space is a widely used term for viewing the Imperium as
basically USA with Spaceships and blasters. Some people get really high
blood pressure when this term is used but as Zappa said: "I for one, care
less for them")

Actually, there are a couple things I\'d like to note.1. The pictures of the
cutter show a single slender hull section above the module connecting the drive
to the command section.  Clearly this would crumple without a module adding
reinforcement.  However, you could modify the design slightly with two sections,
one to either side.
2. A loading arm  would really help with the installation procedure. Since the
loading would be done in zero g\'s, a light arm could do the trick.  On planet
surfaces, loading could be done with large vehicles or the cutter could maneuver
over top the module for pickup.
3. You can square off the bottom of a cylinder module making a 38 dT hangar
shape. Combined with the cutter, the 8 extra dT is only a 16% increase in volume
which falls into the 20% leeway granted for drawing deck plans. This makes for
easy placement of buildings.

Not just the Romans.  During teh Industrial Revolution train bridges
collapsed at a fantastic rate in England: something like 1 in 4!

Funny thing that opposable thumb, upright biped thing ;-)

As for feeding \'em...one time in a D&D campaign, I decided to institute
realistic \'you have to feed your horses\' rule. They started calculating
what they needed to carry with them to mount an expedition deep into an
alipine setting.

We rapidly got into an infinite expansion of: to feed the horses you
need x mules carrying y*x sacks of grain, and then to feed the horses +
x mules you need x + z mules carryinx x*y + z*y sacks. Iterate until
they figure out they have to walk in with a few pack mules in tow,
eating the ones who carry the grain as you empty their loads.

That went by the wayside _really_ fast and we went back to magical horse
feed stations throughout the wilderness. ;-)

Of course realism never _did_ play a very large role in my D&D games.

No, I tend to see the Vilani using fasteners that have internal gripping
surfaces - and the specific tools that are used with each type of fastener would
have a specific range of torque that they could deliver to ensure correct
delivery of the required force to seat the fastener.

The VARGR, on the other hand, have a large variety of fasteners of different
types - not that it matters because you can get almost anything on with a \'vargr
speed wrench\' (pliers), at least once.  (The second time you get vise-grips)

There is a lesson from Travller in this.  Ancient (and in 
fact most) societies are suprisingly (to modern people)
unintersted in new ways of doing things if the old
ways are working OK.  (Why bother with machines whe
the use of slaves, seft, or whatever is doing just
fine?)  The modern concept of "progress for the sake
of progress", where new ways of doing things are
seen as goals in their own right is a new (and
perhaps transitory) phase of human development.

That makes a *little* more sense, but WRT your factors; at TL 12 a single
*turret* (as opposed to weapon) compares thus;

Type                Power     Volume      Weight     Price    Factor
Triple Beam Laser    750       13.5        15         3Mcr     2
Dual PG Turret       500       27          6          3Mcr 3.5 (between 3 & 4)
Dual FG Turret      1000       27          10         4Mcr     4

To express it a little differently I\'ll divide the vars. attributes by the
factor of the weapon;

Type                Power     Volume      Weight     Price
Triple Beam Laser-7  375       6.75         7.5        1.5
Dual PG Turret-12    143       7.7          1.72       .86
Dual FG Turret-12    250       6.75         2.5         1

Hmmm, that\'s a little different than I expected; they normalize pretty
comparably (aside from the range issue - which is pretty important).  Not
much difference in volume consumed (most important of these factors IMO),
fairly close price wise, power is quite a difference, but not enough to add
much power plant volume (volume of pp assuming large plant efficiency at
TL12 is 1 kl per 6 MW difference; 38kl btw the highest (Blaser) and lowest
(PG) consumers), and weight is a huge difference (but weight is hardly used
for anything when Manuver Drive units are used).

Having played a few MT combat sessions recently, we found sand to be very
effective against blasers, but that additional +2 is not going to make a
lot of difference.  The combination of the +2 and the better factor might,
however, and it just might be that there is a reason for carrying a few
"Fusion carronades" after all.

>  OC, played on a hex-grid using vector movement (there was a Dragon article

Right.

Now the next question.  should a single turret be allowed to contain
multiple batteries of weapons.  In other words, can a single turret with
multiple weapons attack a target (or targets) multiple times or is it
always no more than one battery?  (rules references would be helpful).  As
far as I can find, the MT ref\'s manual does not *specifically* allow or
disallow this, and some CT designs (ISTR) had a \'mixed turret\'
configuration which must have allowed multiple attacks.

In _Traveller Adventure_, Tukera ran along the official X-boat lines.  My
intention was to build a ship capable of running on an arbitrary xboat net
designed at jump-4.

> As for the jump-4,
> what route did you decide on for the ship to get to and from Regina?

The writeup I made assumed that travel was along the official xboat lines,
and claimed that the Trimkhana-Brilliance was headed to Roup, as that link
requires a large jump.  I forget if that\'s a jump-4; if it isn\'t, another
destination should be selected that is (to force the ship to drop all her
tanks).  I suppose it would make more sense if the _Trimkhana-Brilliance_ 
was headed the other way, into Lanth toward the interior.  If there were
an xboat line toward Rhylanor (as DGP added later, or as was supposedly
being constructed in _Twilight\'s Peak_) that would make sense, too.

Well, if there are four tanks, I think that the ship can drop one and
execute a jump-3 with the remaining three tanks and ship (1040 tons),
burning 312 tons of fuel (using most of the fuel in the retained tanks
as well as the dropped one).  A jump-4 would require all four tanks to be
dropped, leaving the ship (800 tons), and burning all 320 tons of fuel.
Or, you can only attach three tanks before executing a jump-3, and 
dropping all of them burn only 240 tons of fuel.  Or, you can operate
at jump-2 indefinitely by carrying three or four tanks and not dropping
any.  There\'s a few other variations. 

This means that you could execute a jump-3, dropping one tank, refuel,
and execute another jump-3, dropping the other three tanks.  This may
help improve the survivability issue, and help the ship\'s economics.
Suddenly, it becomes very important to figure out what will cost more,
burning extra fuel, or replacing dropped tankage (if tanks are really
non-reusable).

Making the tanks identical might be good for mass-production purposes,
and there might be other neat tricks to use them that I haven\'t thought
of yet.  (What can you do with a used 80-ton drop tank?)  :)

I have studied medieval history, and I chose to use \'The Dark Ages\',
because I was taught that it refered to the period before the High Middle
Ages, say roughly the Carolingian and Ottonian empires, through to about
the first crusade.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'ve seen several (20th century) space station designs using space shuttle
fuel tanks as building blocks.

Of course, the most obvious thing to do with a used 80-ton drop tank is 
refill it with fuel. If the drop tank isn\'t reusable for fuel, Many of the 
other interesting things you could do with it are probably impossible 
as well.

What would make an 80-ton drop tank non-reusable? Is it sucked into
jump space forever? Does it have power converters in it that are burned
out when you do the quick burn to get ready for jump? Or do the explosive
bolts simply crack it here and there so you don\'t trust it with high-pressure
jump fuel any more?

If the last were true, that would provide some ideas - orbital habitats,
scrap metal, hulls for really cheap (space gypsies?) system ships,
collect them up and recondition them...

"Come on down to Fnik\'s Salvage, where we have a full stock of 
Tukhera Lines reconditioned drop tanks! Each tank is inspected and
100% guaranteed not to stick to your ship like a leech and make
you explode messily..."

Hmmm...I was reading a module for the Star Wars RPG, it mentioned 
an interesting practice of their Imperial Navy. They kept their ships
scrupulously clean, even if that meant throwing out half-empty containers
of things. There were salvage ships that would eagerly zoom into the
garbage stream of departing Imperial vessels, sending out spacehands
and salvage droids to grab these goodies...many of which were 
consolidated, repackaged and (with complete legality) resold to the
Imperial Navy.

How does that space gruel taste after being dumped out with the
garbage once or twice? :)

Yes. I know on both points. I forgot about angular mom, but a later post

The original post was discussing needing somewhere to store *energy* and
suggested some kind of flywheel would be needed - I counter suggested
conversion from kinetic to electric energy. I did forget Angular momentum
though... you need something like an OMS to stop the whole ship spining.

High Guard (2nd. ed.) Traveller, Book 5

I see advantages and disadvantages to this. I feel that mixed turrets were a
holdover from CT book two (Starships) ship designs, and the boardgame Mayday
(which BTW suggested it could combine Mayday and HighGuard into one game, with
High Guard\'s mechanics and Mayday\'s Newtonian movement. I think this later
became Brilliant Lances and Battlerider). This allowed small ships with one or
two turrets to have missiles, lasers, and Sandcasters. I always tried when
gaming, to get my freighters or couriers armed with triple turrets containing
one each of the above. The down side of this is that according to High Guard,
one has to either a) have three gunners for each turret, since each weapon is
a separate battery, or b) the turret gunner can only fire one of the turret
weapons each turn. This has the effect of cutting firepower considerably. I
would suggest that ship designers try for homogenous turrets whenever
possible. I would rather have three turrets, one with three lasers, one with
three missiles, and one with three sandcasters, than three turrets with one
each. Thus I conclude that mixed turrets should only be used on VERY small
ships (those with one or two turrets).

Bingo! The first machineguns (the Requa Battery, the French
Milltreaiissleiuuse (sic) and to some extent the Gatling) looked like
artillery, so they were initially deployed and used like artillery.

Only by Medievalists. The argument has been going on ever since 1969, at
least, when I first heard two professors square off over: 

Resolved: The Dark Ages is the Process by Which the Romans Became Italians

An interesting period. Perhaps someone can explain to me (in Email -- no point
in clutering the TML) the intense fascination with the immediate post-Roman
period by a small group. Evidently the Post Roman/pre-Viking period has some
mystical significance that I (as an agnostic and follower of a different
"spirituality path") fail to grasp. It all seems to be tied up with
neopaganism, the Arthur legend, and the Sutton Hoo burial. Personally, I think
it has to do with the fact that primary literary sources are rather scarce, so
it\'s easier to make stuff up without being contridicted.

  They might also make for fairly kinky anti-KKM weapons, FWIW, particularly
if IYTU they can get detonation type plasma ammo (a la 2300 AD), thus not
having to worry about accumulators or PD power usage peaks.

  They also make small TL 13+ fighters really good against impromptu
armed vessels; one shot = one effective hit = 4 or 5 - X criticals,
where X is size stat from HG. Ouch. Yes officer, I\'d rather just stop.

  In HG a single (if the ship has <10 turret, p.30) turret can contain
multiple batteries of a single weapon of the appropriate type (within
the size limit of the turret) - typically a tri-turret with 1x each of
missile, laser, and sand. By TNE (and T4?) tech this should be disallowed
for lasers, and isn\'t relevant for other weapons if the CT hardpoint
limit has vanished.

  Apparently it worked out to be about six days range for large
ancient military expeditions before re-victualling, presumably
by meeting up with the fleet following them along the coast or
by settling down for some heavy foraging (so much for strategic
mobility there).

  I\'ve been waiting for this one to pop up. Why build any internal
Jump fuel tankage at all on new construction or large refits?

  The dedicated internal tanks on my Far Trader take up 40 DT of my
hull, which latter is (in HG) costed at MCr 0.1 per. Instead, I can
now build a 160 DT hull with drive capacity for 200 DT loadout, and
install 40 DT worth of tanks for MCr 0.05 complete. Unit cost reduced
by MCr 3.95, which means about another Cr 10,000 each month that I don\'t
have to earn (or, I\'ve got 10 tons of invisible cargo revenue on the
books).

  Heck, why install explosive bolts when dumping them will cost me cash?

1.  If you throw away the tanks after every useage, you *may* end up jumping 
into a system where you can\'t get new tanks.  That means, you\'re stuck there.  
Enjoy your stay.

2.  Drop tanks are not as heavy duty as a hull is, so it\'s easier to hole.  
Fuel runs out, and you\'re stuck there.  Enjoy your stay.

3.  Way I\'ve seen it played against me is, a shot at the ship is a shot at 
both the hull and the tanks.  If your tanks are 1/5 the size of the ship, you 
have a 1 in 5 chance of the other guy\'s shot hitting your tanks instead of 
your ship, holing it.  Fuel runs out and you\'re stuck there.  Enjoy your stay.

FWIG, the drop tank costs are for *one-shot* tanks.  Not permenantly mounted 
tanks.  I\'ve always played them that way because it makes *SENSE* to do it 
that way.  I\'m from the school of \'make the players work for an even break\'.  
YMMV.

  Well, yes, there\'s an economic logic that affects the length of
the implementation cycle. Part of this will replace quantity of
hulls with equivalent capacity (and fewer bridge crews). The big
question is when did it start?

>Pure passenger liners will be screwed in that event, but high-capacity

  The demountable tanks also beg the question why they\'re not standard
already, as they would allow a Far Trader doing J-1 (or in-system by
M-drive) to carry 20 DT extra.

  GURPS may partially address part of this for demountable by making
criticals easier (or reducing structure [?] ratings) for ships so
equipped. The current special damage rules for external tanks really
apply only to warships, and then not under all conditions.

Sorry. That wasn\'t a dig at you, it was a dig at the (presumably) randomly
generated X-boat lines in the official Traveller Universe. Random generation
is great as a springboard for further developement, but it sucks green pigs
when used uncritically. Case in point: When trying to decide on the route
for the Tukera high capacity liners, I noticed that on the X-boat network
Mora and Rhylanor are 9 links apart (Note: They are 10 parsecs apart).

Digression: I once came up with a way to construct a sensible X-boat network:
You first designate a number of worlds as primary nodes. Those are the worlds
that the network is designed to carry news to as fast as possible. IMTU that\'s
mostly Sector and subsector capitals and high-population worlds with Class A
starports You then connect all primary nodes with the fewest possible jump-4
links. Whenever you need to, you introduce secondary nodes between primary
nodes. When several alternatives for secondary nodes exists you choose the
system with the highest population/best starport.

Well, the TNS newsbrief did say that the liner would link the Regina
_subsector_ to the interior. That\'s why I didn\'t consider any system in
Regina as a possible destination. But going into lanth the next link on the
X-boat network is IIRC Dinomn, two parsecs away. I haven\'t done the
calculations, but I\'m pretty sure that using a jump-4 ship on a jump-2
route will pretty much wipe out the economic advantage you get from
using a high capacity ship.

No, I didn\'t mean deployment strategies. I meant the physical arrangement
of the drop tanks. If I was designing a ship with four drop tanks, I
wouldn\'t put one tank on top of the other. That is, I would propably
have port, starboard, ventral, and dorsal tanks, but I wouldn\'t have a
port inboard. Can you think of an arrangement that would allow inboard
and outboard tanks that didn\'t interfere with each other?

Sure. But would an inboard and an outboard tank be identical?

If it was economic to fetch them back, I\'d reuse them. If it wasn\'t, I\'d
let them float off into the great unknown.

Go to FF&S and try and design them for the cost they are suppose to have.
I think this would give them a to low a armour value to be used in space.
They would be punctured by micrometeroites.

But that means that the tanks need a jump grid on them and that the ship
has a jump drive that is made for taking at least three of the drop tanks
into jumpspace. That is going to increase the cost of the drop tank
system.

One other issue I\'m wondering about is the drop tanks survivablity in
space. Is it possible with say FF&S to make drop tanks that has amour over
the minimum level for space travel. A micrometeor is going to kill you if
this is not accounted for.

That would mean that you\'ll have to upgrade your jumpdrive to take 280
dton into jumpspace and that the drop tank would need a jump grid on its
hull. Not the way to go :-)

Yikes! Now you have life support costs up to Cr8,000/month! That\'s a LOT of
money...

Anyway, you\'re wrong. The Cr2,000 life support cost is expressly said to
cover a full two weeks. I quote:

"Each occupied stateroom on a starship involves an overhead cost of Cr2000
per trip (2 weeks) made."
         ^^^^^^^^^ 
"...double occupancy [...] requires twice the normal cost."

[_The Traveller Book_, p. 52; _Imperial Encyclopedia_, p. 89; _TRAVELLER,
The New Era_, p. 222; and _Marc Miller\'s TRAVELLER_, p. 97.]

And in connection with long term subsistence:

"Individuals living on ship-board have ordinary lodging and food taken care
of..."   [Book 3, p. 15]

"STARSHIPS: Passengers and crewmembers have their food and lodging provided,
with costs covered by the life support costs necessary for operation of the
ship." [_The Traveller Book_, p. 109;]

(T4 says exactly the same, although slightly paraphrased. I haven\'t found
it in either MT or TNE.)

And _Beltstrike_ has this to say about long-term real-space expeditions:

"In long voyages of this type [...] life support costs are paid as in the
TRAVELLER rules (Cr2000 per person per two weeks, or Cr1000 per week); 150
person-weeks of life-support supplies take up one ton of cargo space and
cost Cr150,000. [...] Life support supplies include food, air and water (to
replace leakage from the recycling process), and consumable elements of the
life support system, such as filters, CO2 absorbers, and so on." [Belter\'s
Handbook, Beltstrike, p. 3]

So Cr2000 will support one person for a full 2 weeks/14 days/336 hours. Yet,
as both you and I have realized, the average passenger dosen\'t spend 336
hours/trip aboard a ship. I used 2/3rds as a simple ratio, but it\'s actually
lower than that. On the average it will be less than 8 days (57% of 14 days).
Call it 60% to get a nice round number. That\'s a difference of Cr800/trip
between passengers and crew and is _not_ a trivial amount.

Now for the ANNIC NOVA. The text says:

"Ordinarily, staterooms require about Cr2000 per trip each. As a private
ship, the cost may be reduced for non-passengers. Figure on Cr1000 per
person per week to cover the costs for food, supplies, etc. Whenever
fitting out for voyages, the crew should lay in a certain number of supplies
whenever in port. One person-week lasts one person one week, costs Cr1000,
and requires 200 kg cargo space."
[_ANNIC NOVA_, adventure in JTAS#1, p. 31]

Cr1000/week is exactly the same as the rules mean by Cr2000/trip, so it is
_not_ reduced one little bit.

>The problem is that I don\'t know how *much* is needed. And I don\'t know
>enough about how such filter cansister would have to be constructed
>(and thus how much they\'d cost over and above the cost of the raw
>materials). 

OK. But can we agree that IF it costs Cr2000/man/fortnight, then it should
not cost more than Cr1200 per passenger/trip?

BTW. The cost of a meal in Rhylan Starport [on the airless world Dinom] is
Cr20 and a room costs Cr100 per day. That\'s a total of Cr160/day for life
support. Granted that Rhylan Starport must be considerably bigger than a
free trader or a subsidized merchant, it can\'t be all that much bigger
considering the amount of passenger traffic it must get (Dinom is _not_ a
major world) and these costs are what the starport charges, not what it
pays for consumables. In other words, the Cr160/day DOES include power
consumption, employee salaries, and profit and bank payments, which
starship life support costs expressly does not.

I couldn\'t find that in any of my CT rulebooks. You roll a die for direction
and 1DD for distance, but not, as far as I can find, for duration.

Well, as an engineer, I must submit that this is most always true.  In
those ages, when engineering was done by experience, rather than
analysis, designs tended to have rather large safety factors (though they
weren\'t quantified as such).  While a modern design might have a safety
factor of 2 or 3, an ancient Roman design would have a safety factor of
20 or 25.

  The dedicated internal tanks on my Far Trader take up 40 DT of my

IMTU, I made civilian drop tanks very vulnerable to battle damage, or
even incidental damage. Even things like abrupt maneuvers or gas giant
refueling could snap them right off their pylons. You could hang on to them,
but they were really designed to strap on once and then dump. I figured
that since the Gazelle would only drop tanks in an emergency, they were
more expensive custom military jobs that were tougher.

External demountable tanks I made tougher and more reliable - I 
figured that since it took facilities to remove them, they must be
bolted on very securely.

I don\'t have my books with me - wasn\'t there something in High Guard
or Megatraveller about any fuel hit destroying all drop tanks?

Used tanks might be refurbished and reused, much like the Shuttle SRBs
are reused.

As to jump grids, if your canon doesn\'t use jump grids, it is a non-issue.
In fact, if you consider the Gazelle CE, it has drop tanks, but they
are not normally expended, so clearly they "work". I recall a recent
note that Marc rejected jump grid in favor of the "lanthanum jump coil"
snternal to the jump drive. integrity to keep jump space out of the ship, but it

Our combined cultural experience is always a clue to what we can expect in the
Traveller universe.  For example, all of Hispano-America speaks Spanish, but
Argentines sound like Italians, words commonly used in Venezuela are
unacceptable language in Chile, about half of Paraguayan Spanish is really
Guarani (local indian tongue). At the airports, the traffic controller speak
English.

By extension, we would find that on every world, the deeper you go into the
world and away from the starport, the deeper you get into local culture and
language... and the greater the chance for adventure.

    'body' => 'Hiya,
     Having recently come into some money in the game I am playing in
(thanks Pete) I\'m brainstorming a shortlist of constructive ways to spend
it to give to the captain. Investment is an attractive option, as it covers
long term contingencies. The question is, of course, what is the likely
return on investment in Traveller?
     At first glance, there is no information pertaining to this in the
rules. But on second glance, I\'ve found two bracketing figures that should
allow for working out return rates.
     The first is shipping. We all know that to get a ship you need 20%
down and then pay 1/240th of the cost for 40 years. But that is as a buyer.
Looking at it from the other end, any sufficiently rich person can act as
the bank, finance the purchase of a ship for someone, and then be the
recipient of their payments.
     So, for example, if you decided to invest in a (MT) Free Trader, you
would have to put up 29.532 MCr, and would receive 153,813 Cr/month return.
For a Far Trader 32.8556 MCr with a 171,125 Cr/month return, and for a
Subsidised Merchanter 54MCr returning 281,250 Cr/month.
     Abstracting this a bit further, suppose you have an investment bank
whose primary investment is in shipping. Instead of you, personally, buying
a ship, instead you invest in the bank purchasing a ship. You can invest
whatever fraction you like. At this rate for every 1 MCr you invest, you
will gain a return of 5,208 Cr/Month. (Payback is after 16 years.)
     Now, of course, this payback has been calculated from raw trader
payments and does not include various overheads like admin, insurance, etc.
Call this, then, the upper bracket.
     The second example in the Traveller\'s Aid Society. It explicitly
mentions that they take your 1 MCr initiation fee and invest it. They pay
out to you 1 high passage every two months, which you can cash in at 90% of
its value. This works out as a return of 4,500 Cr/month for your 1 MCr
investment. (Payback is after 18.5 years.)
     Now this figure includes all sorts of overhead not only for admin but
also running all those little lounges in A & B starports everywhere. Call
this, then, the lower bracket.
     Together these give us a rangeband, from 4,500 to 5,208 Cr/month of
return on investment that fits in with existing stuff. Personally I would
just choose 5,000 Cr/month per megacredit as a nice round figure.

But that stil means that at 200 dton free trader with a 80 dton drop tank
needs a jump drive capable of carring 280 dtons into jumspace if it is
taking the tank with it. That is going to increase the cost of the ship.

I would say that they could be similar to drop tank on modern day
aircraft.  You have inboard and outboard tanks, but they are all ventral
mounts, under the wings.  Similar setup for starships, with them mounted
along one surface, inboard/outboard as in relation to the central axis
on the plane.  ??? Make sense?

Which reminds me of another way to get money back out of the ship on short
links; replace one or two of the tanks with 80-ton cargo modules.  However,
this assumes that the tanks are shaped in a way that makes this feasible.
You could add two cargo tanks, and drop two fuel tanks, executing a jump-1,
or add one cargo tank and drop three fuel tanks, executing a jump-2.  Now,
whether this makes sense depends again on what you\'re earning on the cargo
(probably speculative freight), and what replacing drop tankage costs.

You might be able to haul more freight if you used custom cargo modules that
had some internal fuel tankage.  For instance, you could execute a jump-3
with a custom cargo module and by dropping three tanks if the cargo module
contained 24 tons of fuel and 56 tons of cargo.  You could also carry two
of these custom modules in the jump-2 example above, dropping two normal
fuel tanks.

Of course, you\'ll have to decide if this is a legitimate way to use a drop
tank mount point.  I think this looks like a fun way for a ship to work, 
but the infrastructure requirements (remounting facilities, manufacture of
tanks and modules, getting fueled tankage where it needs to go, and so on) 
are fairly significant.

As I recall, again in _Traveller Adventure_, installing the tankage took
two weeks in port; time is money.  This is also a strike against the
collapsible demountable tank craze that swept THUDDD-1 (and my design was
one of the offenders in that regard).

Okay.  I think the deployment strategies drive the need for a four tank
system; more flexibility in deployment, but not so many tanks that it\'ll
be too pricey on the flat fee for each tank.

In terms of the physical arrangement, we don\'t know how the ship was 
supposedly configured.  Somehow, though we have two tanks on the port
side and perhaps two to starboard.  I think all four tanks need to be
able to be jettisoned individually, in rapid succession.  If they\'re
even roughly side-by-side (perhaps they\'re long and narrow), then one
will be farther to port than the other.  That one would be the "port
outboard" tank and the other to port the "inboard" tank.  The inboard
tank might be more ventral or dorsal than the outboard, but whatever
way the ship\'s configured, it\'s apparently in a way that the system
referred to in the TNS article is easy for the crew to use.

Using a real-world, 20th century model (the best available, short of making
something up) you must remember that the return on investment is roughly
proportional to the risk associated with that investment.

An excellent concept for investment, but individual ships are a pretty
risky investment in general (how many player groups have skipped out on
their payments), though specific individuals (who are acquaintances) may be
of lower risk, and background checks and barratry insurance could mitigate
the risk.

>     Abstracting this a bit further, suppose you have an investment bank
>whose primary investment is in shipping.

Actually, the bank (or firm) would organize the loans into a
pseudo-security, similar to the way that Genniemaes and Fanniemaes are
organized now; Genniemaes and Fanniemaes (sorry, meaning of the original
acronym is lost to me) are basically gov\'t backed loans bundled into groups
with a certain net worth, then the bundle is "sold" to individual investors
(usually mutual funds) as "shares" of the loan.  The cost is market driven,
the return is the rate on the loan, less a point or so shaved off the top
for the bank or firm who bundled the loans and is administering them.  They
are usually sold at somewhat less than their "face value" since there is
some risk associated with them (although the risk is low to begin with on
home loans, and failure of an individual loan is diluted by the \'bundling\').

> At this rate for every 1 MCr you invest, you

A return of about 6.3% if you hold the mortgage, after bundling and bank
fees, etc. you could probably get about 5% return.  A safe investment,
therefore not a very high return.  Risk varies, but goes up with a bad
economy.  I can see different "bundles", I\'ll call them "Shippiemaes" or
"Shippies" for short, having special attributes; A Core Shippie that has a
4% return but is more secure since the ships involved are all million ton
traders running between Core Area planets, a "Growth Shippie" which is for
more risky areas such as between the Imperium and Sword Worlds or
specializing in Ships trading with Vargr, or perhaps a "Shippie Magellan"
which tends to carry a mixture of Growth, Stable, and high risk ships for
balancing risk with return; around 8% is probably the best one can do.

Of course there are other tactics; these shares are bought and sold, and as
such they can be influenced similarly to other stocks; a tradewar (or
verifiable rumor of tradewar) will decrease the value dramatically of
regional shippies, a more conventional war would be even worse.

The securities can be thought of as having a maximum value equal to their
"face value" plus the total possible interest earned less inflation; so a
1000 Mcr Shippiemae with a 6% "coupon" (i.e. return of 6% per year for 40
years) would earn its holder Mcr 60 per year; total return Mcr 2400 - Max
sale price for such a "bond" would be the "cost" of the bond in terms of
inflation; at a 3% per year inflation rate the \'real\' rate earned is only
3% - so the biggest sale value would be (1000 * 3% * 40 = ) 1200 Mcr.  More
likely it\'ll be 2% since there is some risk so (1000 * 2% * 40) 1080 Mcr.

The Shippiemae would include this, but as an individual investor in a
specific ship these would need to be considered.

4.5%, a very safe investment, savings accout-like returns.

Well, *you* don\'t have to worry about that overhead, and I\'m sure the
membership fees for TAS, like the membership fees for, say, Diner\'s Club or
AMEX, only cover a fraction of their costs.  Other revenues would be
advertising, TAS Magazine sales, commission on ticket sales, and of course,
capital investements, which I bet they are making 8-9% at least, so that
your membership fee\'s interest can support the bimonthly ticket costs.

Sure, but that rate you can get at the bank in a savings account (well, not
quite, but you know what I mean).  The fact is, player investments of this
sort will not be pertinent on the scale of a campaign (which rarely lasts
more than a couple of years).

What I think would be good is a set of guidelines relating riskiness to
returns, and/or a bunch of specific investments which are role-played for
the players to choose from.  Such things as inventions to be marketed, game
companies with new products (ooh, that\'s a bit close to home), safe or
risky mutual funds and stocks, Lanthanum or Groat Bellies futures, bets on
Haggite races, etc.

So, without further ado;

Return       Investment          Risk   Factors affecting risk
 2-3%       CDs, Savings accounts 1%   General Economic Conditions
 4-6%       Blue Chips, Bonds     2%   General Economic Conditions
 5-8%       Shippiemaes           3%   Specific to Shippiemae, risk/rate
may vary
 5-12%      Individual Ships      20%  Captain\'s Trading skills, local economy
 10-30%     Wildcat stocks        25%  Commodity availability, economics, etc.
 10-100%    Inventions            30%  Invention viability, market
 10-200%    Futures & Options     60%  Commodity Availability, weather
 20-1000%   Gambling, Startups    90%  Dep. on business., or game.

a "90%" risk means one in ten of these investments fail, losing the capital.

This is just a guess, and anyone who can do better, should.

Hmm, I seem to recall a shareware or freeware game that was a stock trading
game out there somewhere.  It could conceivably be used as the basis for an
in-game investment strategy.

Well we\'re really talking apples and oranges here...the Gazelle has
\'dismountable external\' fuel tanks, constructed so as to be a normal
part of the hull, but which can come off in an emergency.

What we\'re talking about here are much more like the shuttle\'s external
fuel tank...designed to be a one-use disposable item.

Tanks designed for re-use (like those on the Gazelle) are going to cost
a lot more, be much better armored, and have considerably more
infrastructure, like pumps, grappling rings, etc.

Note, the fragile nature of disposable drop tanks may limit their re-use
under most circumstances..my example of a free trader strapping one on
would involve a great deal of fabrication to make it workable, like
adding additional armor to the tank (it needn\'t be much...a wrapping of
foil/kevlar, just enough for stop micrometeorites) and some more
permanent fuel fittings.

In HG there was a chance of a percentage of the fuel tanks getting damaged 
*OR* shattered.  2 different battle damage results.

IIRC, that referred to the internal fuel tanks of the ship. An analysis I\'ve
seen postulated that ships above a certain size were not good designs, as one
hit could crack their fuel tanks and make them immobile missile launch
platforms. The analysis determined that the minimum size ship that could carry
a spinal mount, armor and drives was the maximum practical warship size for
this reason.

I have no idea where I read this analysis - too many tidbits in my brain, I
guess... :)

  I get the message :) , but for a merchant between peaceful jump-points none
of these issues matter. For adventurers, yes, of course.

  The problem arises because the rules don\'t seem to be aware of any
differentiation between one-shot and multiple use drop tanks. Large
portions of this problem would go away if the difference were made
clear, but that now involves the "lanthanum as grid or coils?" issue.

IMTU, if it could happen in real life, it can happen during character 
creation. Promotions and commissions would not necessarily happen 
only at the end of a term, unless I\'m very much mistaken, so I don\'t 
see why it couldn\'t happen prior. Since there is a roll to see how 
many years of the term are served in the event of an injury,  I 
would institute a roll of some sort to see which year the commission 
and then promotion fell (obviously, the promotion could not happen 
prior to the commission, so this would have to be accounted for). If 
the roll came up year 4, you are out of luck.

Overall, I would think that the second time around would count as a 
third career with the modifiers that apply. As a GM, I might grant an 
exclusion for this under certain circumstances. A rogue career might 
be one of them if the player had a good character concept and 
presented it well to me. I would not allow reverting without penalty 
if I thought my player was just trying to \'beef up\' his character.

I see it as more an issue of durability.  You want to sell a one-shot product, 
you *won\'t* build it to last forever.  Gazelle tanks are \'dismountable\' tanks 
rather than one-shots.  They\'re built tougher.

IMO if you are going to be able to load up your drop tank spaces with cargo
modules you\'re going to have to design your ship with grapples, etc like a
RCES Clipper from TNE.

I see *ZERO* reasons why drop tanks or external dismountables should be immune
 to damage.  And IIRC, the shattered tank hit came from a BFG hit like a meson
 gun.  Lemme dig out my HG & check it, I\'ll get back to ya.

I don\'t follow this.  If 90% means a 1-in-10 chance of failure, then
logically doesn\'t 1% mean a 99-in-100 chance of failure?  It seems to
me that, based on your chart (which I *really* like, BTW) a 90% risk
means that 9-in-10 will fail, not 1-in-10.

In the original Gazelle designs from the same era as the TNS article,
I recall them being referred to as "drop tanks".  I\'m certain that 
the Gazelle was a 300 ton ship capable of jump-2 without the external
tanks, was jump-4 with the 100-ton tanks, *and* could use the tanks
as drop tanks and get jump-5.  The Fiery variant was streamlined and
did away with the drop tankage, I think.  Have to take a look.

If this is true, I\'d assume the same sort of tankage could be used in
the Trimkhana-Brilliance and similar ships.

The type of tankage carried by the Gazelles may have been changed in
designs of the ships for later versions of Traveller.  I don\'t know.
As I see it, "drop tanks" can be jettisoned, while "dismountable"
tanks, whether internal or external, have to be removed with tools.

Lets just say I find him and some of his views of the future a little hard to

(the early 70s, for those of you who are curious -- I got to see the show in

Another option was to conduct the campaign along a river, where you could be
resupplied by barge. See _Alexander the Great and the Logistics of the
Macedonian Army,_ and _Supplying War,_ both, I believe, by M van Creveld.

That is a different game.  Its called "Travelers" - with one L.  ;-)

I think these \'bracketing\' figures are useful to figure out the strength of the
market, assuming a stable market.  Of course, they don\'t limit the range for
investments and returns.  They do suggest that a 5% return is available for
very low risk investment, which is probably greater than you\'ll be able to get
in a bank since the market outperforms banks.

WRT Shipping Example:

I\'m not sure I follow your math here.  Looking at T4, it says the total
financed priceof the ship is 220%.  Since the buyers have to put up the 20%
deposit, that means
the gross return to the bank is 200% of the purchase price, a profit of 100%.
Thus, a 30 MCr loan for a Free Trader will generate 30 MCr in profits in 40
years,
after the principle is paid back.  And I think thats what is missing from your
example
above.  Roughly, your example gives a 5% return/year.

30 MCr * 1/240 * 12 Months = 1.5 MCr / year = 5.0% / year.
Over 40 years, this is 60 MCr.
But you need to subtract the value of the principle loaned, you\'re out 30 MCr
on day one.  It takes 30 MCr, to put you even.  After that is the return, the
profit.
Thus, the real returns should be divided in 2.  Essentially 0.75 MCr / year
return.
Thats about 2.5% per year.  Seems ridiculously low for such a, IMHO,
risky investment for a starship that might be incredibly difficult to find,
especially
since the money is going to be tied up for so long.  This is practically
charity.  For
this kind of interest rate, you usually are required to sign the contract in
blood and
commit future generations of your family.

Thats the real question, how risky should this loan be?

We don\'t have enough info to work this one out really.  For instance, can
youtake your money out whenever you want?  If so, then its not a bad
investment.

0.0045MCr/month * 12 months/year = 0.054 MCr/year
This comes out to a 5.4% annual return.

But if you have to wait, well, then its value to you depends on how long you
live.

As I mentioned, you need to deduct the principle from these figure to see
howmuch return you\'re really getting.  In the end it comes out pretty low,
which
suggests that these are very secure, low risk investment options, which is odd,

given the nature of spaceflight (I suggest that those numbers for ships were
designed
to make it affordable for players to afford a ship in the beginning of play).
They also
suggest that the interest in a bank savings account would be at least slightly
less,
because the market outperforms banks generally.  Thus, I\'d conclude that a good

savings account interest would be about 2%.  That indicates that the value of
money
is relatively low, i.e., not a lot of people are trying to borrow a lot of
money.

If I had cash and was looking to invest it in a Traveller setting, I\'d invest in things
that I can keep my eye on.  Real Estate.  Especially in keystone systems that link
mains and trade routes with Gas Giants.  Futures would be a potentially lucrative,
but with new worlds and resources being discovered all the time, extremely risky
given the difficulty of prediction.  Overall, you best returns are going to come from
industries that the economy of an intersteller community depends on: shipbuilding,
weapons, technology (of all kinds) and the resources those industries need. The
market should be able to provide these blue-chip industries for you.  Of course
the market will fluctuate, but given the examples above, I\'d guesstimate that
such stable but continually expanding businesses would return average low-risk
market returns of 5-10%.   I\'d invest in Anagathics, Fusion + and Jump Drive
Tech.

Of course, I get normally get about 25% with my mutual fund, but that East Asian
Market trouble took it down somewhat.  ;-)

Gambling is not that risky.  It depends on the game.  The Risk and Return
is proportional to the probability.  For example, in Craps, assuming you stick to the
pass line bet, the house only has a 10% advantage or so.


For game purposes:

Risk:   (A Trading Task)         Return %:
None                    12-            1d3 + Broker Skill                1-3%
Low                      11-            3 + 1d3 + Broker Skill          4-6%
Fair                        9-             3 + 1d6 + Broker Skill          4-9%
Moderate               6-             2d6 + Broker Skill                2-12%
High                       3-             (2d6 + Broker Skill) * 10      20-120%
Extreme Risk          0-             (2d6 + Broker Skill) * 100    200-1200%

These investments would require minimum duration of One year.

Since you can be sent to Officer Candidate School directly from Basic
Training,commission is not necessarily and end-of-term bonus.  Most promotions
have a
minimum time requirement.  However, since this double whammy of commission
and promotion can only happen once in a career, and happens at the lowest
commissioned rank, I think one year should be enough between commission and
promotion.  Thus, Commission happens during year one of a term, Promotion
during
year two.  Of course, the needs of the military may require an earlier
promotion.

I think Marc\'s view is that characters should have only one career.  While I\'m
noton board with that, I wouldn\'t allow a character to go back to a career
already
experienced, however minimally.  I would stop the character generation when
this
happens.  I\'ve stopped several characters after they were discharged from first

career and either didn\'t qualify or failed enlistment in any other, including
the draft.
I think thats a good idea overall, else you end up with a Traveller universe
crowded
with 34 year old ex-officers.

I think Fanniemae comes from Federal National Mortgage Annuities or
something like that.

There is another set of more macro economic data we have access to - the
investment rules in Pocket Empires. I think they deliver a slightly lower
real rate of interest than the above indidcates, but I havenet done the
exhaustive analysis on the numbers you would need to assess the reyurn on
investment on planetary infrastructure.

Me, I like 3% plus risk premiums as a nice round number - it\'s pretty close
to historical real rates of interest as well. Anything on top of that
should include risk premiums.

Other things to consider when investing in a ship are things like an
"Owners Representitive" on board - typically one of those big ex-Marine
types who is there to make sure the crew dont steal the ship.

Other options to minimise skip risk include finding jobs for the crews
family on your estate, or hiring the entire crew from one planet and having
a long-term relationship with the planetary government.

Slight error. The Bank only Puts up 80% of the purchase price so 
their return is actually 250%

Nope. The 30MCr loan will be for a 37.5 Mcr Ship, with a payback of 
75Mcr over 40 years, or 45Mcr profit. 

> And I think thats what is missing from your example above. 
> Roughly, your example gives a 5% return/year. 

I\'ve examined the situation from a overall point of view. If I 
as a single investor or company have enough cash to buy a ship 
outright, and I\'m expecting 5% return on my investment, how much do I 
need to charge per ton to get that return. I also assume that I want 
to amortise the price of the Ship over 40 years, so when it needs 
replacing I can replace it. 

Say I have a 100Mcr Ship (nice round numbers) with 200T cargo 
(nearly the CT stats for a fat trader). Assume 25 trips per year, 
assume 100% usage of capacity

5 Mcr to cover the profit expectations.
2.5 Mcr to cover amortisation,
 200x25 = 5000 ton-trips of available cargo space,

I need to charge 1500 Cr per ton just to meet my profit 
expectations. That isn\'t counting fuel, wages, lifesupport or annual 
maintanance. If I assume 75% usage of capacity the required profit 
per carted ton goes up to 2000 Cr.

This will vary quite wildly on the ship design. I\'ve seen some 
designed which were _very expensive_ with quite small cargo bays, and 
they would need to charge more to meet profit expectations.

I believe figuring a return like this would drastically change the 
sorts of ships that are economical, and indeed the cost of moving 
stuff.

I figure passage (low high and mid) at having to return their tonnage 
equivalent (x0.5 for low, x4 for high or mid in large Staterooms x2 
for small staterooms).

I\'ve started collecting starship designs to analyse this, 
particularly wrt to the difference between J1 and J2, but I\'ve not 
had enough time recently. It starts to look like a J2 ship will have 
to charge quite a lot per ton, sometimes more than twice a J1 ship, 
but then, it gets there next week, not next month.

Also turnaround time at port is dramatically important. If you can 
find a local trader who will hunt up cargos for you before you get 
there, cutting your turnaround down to a day or two to pick up cargos 
and passengers, rather than the normal week, then although your costs 
haven\'t dropped any, your number of trips has gone up, so your 
required profit per trip has gone down, meaning you can charge less 
and still make a reasonable return.

Has anyone else looked at this sort of thing? Is anyone else 
interested in it?

I get the impression that people have taken the 1000Cr per T as a 
base assumption and tried to figure out if a ship is profitable from 
there, whereas I\'m taking the profitability requirement as an 
assumption and working back to a required cost of shipping.

I\'m still trying to get my head around what the numbers look 
like if you expect 1 ship in 20 to be written off/destroyed before 
the amortisation period. Whether banks would require insurance, and  
the cost of insurance? I\'ve heard of people paying 110% premiums 
(i.e. for a helicopter worth 100K, they were paying 110K per year 
insurance, but then, they crashed about one a year...) but that 
depends on how dangerous the route is, what the chances of breaking 
something is, and what conditions the insurance companies would make. 
 "Hey captain, I don\'t think we should buy unrefined fuel, jump 
from inside 100D or miss our annual maintenance, the insurance 
contract is void if we do, and as for not meeting minmum crew 
requirements..."

I\'m not sure that this has a big effect on how you design your trader 
ships, but I think it should. Gimme time to think about it some more.

All totals following exclude the Spinward Marches.
From "Survival Margin" maps;  
  In 1119 around 7-8 sectors area are "safes" - a bit under
half of the Imperium*. Available shipping tonnage is down
to 80% of pre-war levels.
  By 1123 only about four sectors in area are "safes", in six
clusters (p. 38).
  By 1125 total "safes" are only about half of a sector. Total
tonnage available probably 45% of pre-Rebellion levels.

 * This doesn\'t include areas that have been heavily damaged but
are currently under effective control; thus, the effective zones
of undamaged commerce infrastructure are somewhat smaller still.

  My phrase, but by 1125 effectively true. As you point out the
large-scale requisitioning of much of the remainder for military
support would further reduce the stock available for civilian
purposes.

  The Imperium will raise taxes arbitrarily to buy new Navy tankers
to support the potential war-time demands of the civil economy?
Possibly, but the mega-corps are going to fight that tooth and nail,
and probably respond by not investing very much at all in the new
tech - putting implementation back by most of a ship life-time
cycle (i.e., switch-over only as ships wear out, and then only as
ships justify bringing new routes into the system). 

  This is also the same Imperium that can\'t or won\'t raise taxes
to pay for adequate internal security patrols by light warships;
again, economic analysis of the 3I data suggests that established
revenues are more than adequate, anyway.

>>>Of course they also might be able to just move the stations
>>>under plantery protection until the fleet shows up.  Or

  A warship with high G\'s of evasion has a radically unfair advantage
when engaging in a long range sniping duel with slow or stationary
targets. Thus, only ships (not stations or deep meson sites) can
participate; a slow merchant vessel that can\'t hide (by landing?)
is easily destroyed. Admittedly most of the combat systems in use
(although not currently in development) don\'t reflect this.

>I don\'t think that a raiding fleet passing through is suficient
>to even destroy areas under plentary protection.

  A raiding squadron with only a single heavy warship can easily
gut a station or high-port at little risk to itself. A lightly
or un-defended site (most systems - though not important ones -
by your own piracy debate opinions, however contested) can be
slagged by a single Gazelle equivalent, obviously.

  But how can you differentiate between anti-piracy patrols,
commerce/anti-commerce training missions, and other dedicated 
internal security operations? Isn\'t the relative guarantee of
an ability to control its territory a defining characteristic
of a government and crucial in establishing its legitimacy?

So, how does one go about defending your "stationary" starport? I would
venture a guess that an effective technique would involve making target
locks ineffective outside the range that the station could defend
itself.  i.e. Jammers and hiding against a much higher signature body.
From their hidden position, they could then draw the attacking ships into
a killzone.  Of course, once a ship gets a lock, they could back off and
"nuke em from orbit". By that time, SDB\'s could get to the primary
weapons platforms.

Everyone has to sleep sometime. Unless the Crew aren\'t prepared to 
whack someone to get the ship, this won\'t help much.

Buying a ship slow enough to outrun (J1) with Xboats, and giving it a 
limited Route (like a 5 planet loop or somesuch) is a reasonable 
pick, because they don\'t get far before they get noticed.

This is the best bet. Social ties!

  I\'m at a bit of a loss here, as I lack the background to figure
out how you can mask a downport or an immobile space station. I\'ll
assume that attackers are going to know where such a facility is,
although the most urgent targets may be star-freighters in orbit.

  The freighters are screwed, of course, even if they have 1-G drives.
Jumping from the planets far side within 100 diameters is probably
their best bet before the battlecruisers escorts mop them up or hand
off missiles onto them.

  As for a station, Det-laser missiles aren\'t a threat with moderate PD
(and power shouldn\'t be a problem with non-military systems shut down).
KKM\'s are, of course, a whole different debate, but active defense by
auxiliaries or counter-missiles may help a lot.

  However, a big capital class intruder (call it a BC in the Dreadnought
era sense) is going to hammer you with a really ugly spinal mount, and
against a stationary target, missing is effectively impossible. Even if
the target has similar armament, it will be largely unable to score hits
out at its effective performance (damage) envelope due to the targets
evasion (for meson weapons the odds are ludicrous)

  It\'s a bit like a fortress like Corregidor (sp?) - with guns it can
duel OK, but torpedoes without homing systems don\'t work worth a damn
against moving targets at long range.

  Others on the list can provide the target solutions more readily
than I. Mind you, the above ignores the turning issue, but even 
changes in velocity along the axis of thrust can lead to the same end.

  Now, going out with SDB\'s either to scrub secondaries and escorts
(if small) or take down the BC (around battle-rider class "SDB\'s")
makes perfect sense, as the defenders don\'t pay for fuel tankage,
jump drives, and the systems that are proportionally based around
those requirements.

Well, they have a stake in that civilian economy.  If their

They will if the savings in new tech are greater than the
taxes.

Don\'t put words in my mouth.  They won\'t raise taxes to
pay for internal security potrols that are seen as being
justified by the need.

It is not the absolute revenues.  Its they need.  If you
took that approach, you would find that there is an
infinite number of things that you could spend your money
on that you can "afford" if you look at them in isolation.

They don\'t sit in the open and try and run.  They sit under
protection and come out when the convoy shows up.

Well, there are a number of differences.  War time always
uses resources that are saved up during peace time, in
war time you control commerce in both time and space (with
convoys, protected routes, etc.) while peace time commerce
is more scattered, third, since the commerce raiding is
occuring more fequently than piracy, it _is_ seen as worth
more resources (if piracy was getting up the Rebellion levels
of commerce raiding, then you really would see the kind of
unquestioning investment in stopping it that people invoke).

That is an _opinion_.  If found them quite refuted.

It wasn\'t the assumption in the books, it was the assumptions
in the analysis.

Good point.

[snip the rest of the discussion about how much you need to charge for
cargo, etc.]

I can see the value of doing such research, but I think that ultimately, the
simplified approach in the Traveller rules are best.  Since, if we were to be
really honest, the idea of interstellar economies, with new planets and
resources and goods being continually discovered and exploited, the whole idea
of money is jeopardized.
What standard is there to base currency on?  Lanthanum?  And what good is a
currency like an Imperial Credit outside the Imperium?  All this makes
the viability of markets and currencies very questionable.

Better to not even go there.

I\'m afraid all this is wrong. It\'s been a long time since university, but I did some calculations about this several years ago and arrived at this concerning starship loans:

You can actually leave the 20% downpayment out of the picture, because these money are never borrowed - they are provided by the buyer here and now and never enters the loan as such.

Thus, the loan is an annuity, with payments per month equal to:

B=(Li(1+i)^M)/(((1+i)^M)-1),

where B are payments per month, L is the size of the loan, i is the interest and M is the number of months the loan is running.

This is the standard formula for annuities. When figuring returns of such loans, you have to figure in the present value of the payments - 1000Cr in 40 years are not worth nearly as much as 1000Cr today, hence the rather complex formula.

We can plug in the values B=1/120, L=1, M=480. If it was possible to solve an equation of the 480th degree, we would be able to find i. Although no analytical solution exists, an approximation gives i=0.33% per month, or cirka 4% pro anno.

This assumes a very stable economy, but fits pretty well with the CT era (maybe not in the Marches, though). A 4% REAL return on investment is not considered bad (not even in the real world). Interest is usually comprised of real return, risk premium and compensation for inflation. If the Credit is untouched by inflation, then only the risk premium remains to be subtracted from the four percent to arrive at the real return.

Maybe the Imperium has created a ship\'s loan guarantee foundation to keep investors risk free. Thus, the Imperium would bear all the risk, but this might be a good investment overall, as this keeps starship loans down and then allows for more interstellar traffic.

Such a foundation would then remove the risk element from the return, making the 4% the real return of investment.

Just a thought.

    'topic' => 'Early Vilani Cuisines, LONG',
    'body' => '	After much thought, and with no little trepidation I might add, I
thought I\'d take a stab at laying out the evolution Vilani cuisines.  BTW Loren
I am assuming that the info on Vland as laid out in the MT Vilani & Vargr book
is still canon.  So here goes... ;)

	Essentially the basic Shugilii processes were given to the early Vilani
by the Ancients for the use of those humans not part of the Ancient
settlements.  Thus Vilani culinary arts started with a unified core of
principles, concepts and processes that were then adapted and expanded on by
the pockets of isolated Vilani during the 200,000 years of Ancient War Machines
fighting the last remnants of the Final War on Vland.
	The First serious developments of an extensive agriculture and
civilizations first occured along the flood plain of the Degar River of the
Lugikad Continent.  Almost at once the new varieties of food sources and the
exploding population forced alterations to traditional Shugilii methods.  But
with new resources came something unusual for the Vilani of the time, wealth
and time.  Until this point most foods had been utilitarian at best, but with
time and wealth the demand for new and different food arose.
	This brought emphasis on fine dining brought about the first examples
of the now distinct Ashkige Cuisine as it is still known today.  Noted for it\'s
mix of mixture of tubers, grain derived noodles, preferance for fish over other
meats and the abundant use of seasonings from various trees and plants only
found originally in the Ashkige mountain ranges.  As the early population
expanded out from the Degar River flood plains the lack of created a
nutritional problem.  This was solved by early seashore settlements that
produced salt in large quantities, thus allowing for salting of fish for long
term storage and transportation.  Creating the final element, Ashkige Cuisine
requires that it\'s standard table not carry salt since the fish provides all
that is necessary.
	Seashore settlements and fish means boats and that leads to seaborne
exploration.  Inevitably as fishing ships followed the coastline they passed
the formidable Ashkige mountain range that divides the continent of Lugikad to
reach the fabled western half.  Settlement here ran into new plants and animals
and surprising lack of previously familiar types.  Also there were new sources
of seasoning and vast herds of edible land animals.  This coupled with the lack
of time (this originally was a frontier) created a new style the <Rob, Kenji: I
need something that stands for Western Desert> Cuisine.  Noted for the
predominance of grain based and baked foods, with large portions of meats and
grain based liquids with alcohol <Guys what the word for beer and/or wine?> due
to the original problems with pure waters supplies.
	With ships carrying increased amounts of goods and voyages of
exploration now yet another Cuisine developed based almost exclusively foods
drawn from the seas.  Ishimaga Cuisine, named for the sea in which it was born
relies heavily on fish and seafoods as it\'s base but then expands on them with
<name for a seaweed guys> which is a surprisingly edible surface growing plant
that moves with the wind and waves to provide a flour to make unleavened bread
and biscuts.  It was in fact from some unknown ship plying it\'s trade in these
waters that the effects of <this deserves a specific word guys> sodium
bicarbonate (baking soda which mimics yeast in making flours "rise") that
revolutionized the cuisine with it\'s baked fish loaves.
	These three Cuisines were what sufficed in the decades that followed as
exploration charted the coasts of the other continents and islands of Vland.
Yet around the time of the first settlements of Khii Eshkhima, specifically
towards the Edamar (huge fresh water inland sea) and the southern extents of
Kuragan\'s Jungle.  The development of the area produced enormous wealth and
demands for novel forms of food as a result taking advantage of the vast new
sources of foods.  Unfortunately as the Shugilii of the time investigated them
most proved to be worthless or lethally dangerous no matter how much processing
was done, though a great many new medicine did result from the experiments.
	The one thing the Shugilii did discover was harmless edible dyes from a
number of roots.  This lead to the development of Edamar Cuisine, noted for a
blending of Ashkige, <Western Desert> and Ishimaga Cuisines in novel ways but
with extraordinary emphasis on the presentation of the meal.  Edamar Cuisine is
noted for it\'s often stunning visual appearance.  Jokes about Edamar Cuisine
having taken the traditional and dressed it up in flashy new clothing are
heartily despised by Shugilii who specialize in this Cuisine since they\'ve been
old for the past 10,000 years!
	Expansion into the Dikaai desert (steppe truthfully) of the Khii
Eshkhima continent brought about a problem for the Shugilii there.  The travel
times were difficult and the food source not only limited but often of poor
quality.  The main sources were herding animals and various water retaining
deep rooting grasses.  Often bland or tasting just wrong in the mouth the
Shugilii here quickly began importing large quantities of spices and Dikaai
Cuisine was born, noted for it\'s highly spiced meats and stews along with
imported grains for unleavened breads and biscuts which are also highly spiced.
This lasted for almost a century until a Shugilii noticed that the milk the
herding animals gave could be fairly easily treated and then used.  This lead
directly to the development of cheeses which are now a hallmark of Dikaai
Cuisine.
	As settlement of Vland continued and technology progressed the blending
of Cuisines and techniques amongst the Shugilii began to erode the distinctions
between the various Cuisines.  Yet it was precisely at this point that two new
distinct types emerged and that the <need a word to signify a culinary
standards authority/committee> emerged.
	The first was on rural Uhshirud Kiigi, tropical even by Vland standards
the discovery by local Shugilii of <another name guys, a bean which when
treated gives a coffee/cocoa flavoring> and <fugus which works on rotten milk
to catalyze it into safe liquid base stock, thickness of which depend on
various factors> which when combined lead directly to Uhshirud Cuisine.  Noted
for it\'s bewildering variety of sweet unleavened breads and thick soups which
range from thin and bland to so severely spiced even those raised on Dikaai
Cuisine find them too hot!
	Then there was Alashad with it\'s cooler climate and extensive
settlements.  With so many people the Shugilii there found themselves unable to
maintain traditional and often time consuming methods.  It was here that a
great deal of the first scientific research was done into Shugilii practices,
nutrition and food sources was done.  The result was a more homogenized
Cuisine, noted for well balanced portions, specific formats of meals and a
blending utilitarian and convience.
	Thus as the <word for a culinary standards authority/committee> emerged
the following Cuisines existed and were codified into the standards which
Shugilii practice even today.


Ashkige Cuisine - Think noodles, lots and LOTS of steamed and boiled veggies
with fish like crazy!  Some other meats and boiled/treated grains together as
side dishes.  Remember, NO SALT SHAKERS!  The fish is salted to death. ;)

<Western Desert> Cuisine - Think biscuts, hard flat unleavened travel breads
with lots of roasted and other wise cooked meat.  Wine and beer are Standard
with every meal and the sauces to "dress" the meals are even mildly alcoholic.
Those grasses and plains veggies as the standard side dish but otherwise
smoked/cooked meats and sausages.

Ishimaga Cuisine - Hard tack and lots of unleavened breads with fish and sea
vegetables.  They are past masters at doing things with breads, putting things
into them and otherwise making the meal out of bread.  Though I didn\'t mention
it I presume some kind of alcoholic drink with each meal as well for safety
against bad water in the early days. ;)

Edamar Cuisine - Ultimate "thief" Cuisine it borrows and steals from everybody
and then dresses it up to look mouth watering. ;) When the first Terran Chef
showed up on Vland these Shugilii were the only ones to go out and talk to him
I\'d be willing to bet. ;)

Dikaai Cuisine - Think tex/mex with an attitude! ;) Then add in a French love
of cheeses and cream sauces.  Not spice it up some more with exotic flavoring.
These guys make the hottest Curries taste bland!

Uhshirud Cuisine - Big on soups and stews, very heavily spiced too.  They also
have great sweet drinks and sours.  Greatest range and variety of flavors and
tastes.  Side dishes are big on raw bulk type foods, especially for dipping
into the soups and stews.  These are NOT neat eating foods. ;)

Alashad - Think MacDonalds, but with a century or two to develop and extend the
menu.  It\'s all good for you, you could almost number the dinners, well
balanced, nutritionally sound, conviently packaged... and ultimately BORING!


	That gets it up to pre-spaceflight Vland.  Thoughts and comments?

	BTW you may have noticed I kept pointing out that the breads were
unleavened?  Bread is a Wonderful, one of the best ways ever discovered to pack
vital nutrients into the body.  But the Vilani don\'t have yeast ;) which means
they are fairly limited in what they can do with grains and flours.  Baking
soda only gets you so far you understand.

	I suspect the first Terran cook to set foot on Vland and show off
things like yeast, potatoes, corn, wheat and the like to the Shugilii is either
gonna get worshiped or tortured to death!  Which brings up a good point, the
Vilani ARE going to import these things onto the various worlds they settled.
Perhaps not by choice but the Terrans will bring them and that means they\'re
going to effect the 3I. ;)

	Somethings to think about hmmm?

I never actually said it was right in the real world.  I was using the figures
that are in T4. It says, total financed cost of a ship to the buyer is 220% of
cost.  The buyer pays 20% up front.  Borrows 80% of the cost.  Repays 200% of
the cost.  The bank loaning the 80% of the cost thus receives 250% return over
40 years (200%/80%).  If the banks loan was for 100MCr, it will receive 250
MCr.  This puts it in a position 150Mcr greater than when it loaned the money.
That is essentially equivalent to receiving 3.75 MCr/year in profit (3.75%).
(of course this whole discussion has assumed no inflation and a stable market).

My figure of 3.75% is close enough to your figure of ~4% that I\'ll take it without the annuities calculation.

I don\'t see that working.

I think the reason interest rate on starships is so low, is so that beginning characters can pool their resources to buy one.  Because of the inherent risk involved in starships, if it were my bank, the interest rates would be higher and I\'d require a much larger down payment.  Its just too easy for a ship to disappear.  They\'d also have required maintenance checks are part of the deal so that I could minimize the risks of a
misjump.  Heck, I\'d probably want to review the log each year to make sure the buyers weren\'t abusing the ship.  And not even the Imperial Marines would mess with my Repo Men.

Or better yet, I\'d make them carry a huge insurance policy.  There\'s the real danger: the Insurance Companies!  Fred Johnson: Interstellar Insurance Agent.  If there\'s evidence you visited an amber zone: extra premiums.  If there\'s evidence you visited a red zone: policy revoked!

My tendancy to Typos,  90% risk means a *9 in 10* chance the investment

Hrmph, they said similar things when the "Gold Standard" was dropped in the
1800s.  The almighty dollar still seemed to be worth something when I
bought my coffee this morning.  The value of an Imperial Credit is pegged
at the transportation of 1 ton of cargo one \'jump\', at least, but that is
not relevant.  The value of a credit is what you can get for it.
Individual services resources or goods may rise and fall in value relative
to teh credit, but the credit is still good for two cups of coffee (or
local equivalent) at the local diner.

There is great value in debating Imperial/Interstellar economics.  First of
all, its fun (for some of us) and second of all, we can "realisticize" our
traveller universes where it is practical.

The subject has been discussed a few times.  I\'m sending you some material
off-line.  Several folks (including me) will be happy to talk to you until
you really don\'t want to hear about it anymore.

Steve Daniels (aka Bloo) does have the right idea though.  You want to
avoid spending huge quantities of time figuring out exactly how much trade
and commerce a given planet conducts in a year with all its neighbors
within 4 parsecs just to figure out what cargos are avialable in the one
week that your players\' ship happens to land there, never to return again.
Unless, of course, you\'re playing solo and that\'s wat you are into.  Most
of us, however, want a practical, realistic answer to the question "What\'s
available to buy at this planet?" and "how much do we get for our cargo"?

It has been the same since CT, you *cannot* make a profit carting freight.

Jo Grant has a spreadsheet (in Lotus 123) that not only will design (MT)
ships, but analyzes their profitability based on freight and passenger
rates.  It basically tells you how much of the hold needs to be full to
break even.  That number often comes out to over 100%.

Rememer that high passengers have the additional cost of the steward to
figure in, plus his quarters, plus environment....

The only \'incremental\' cost that a jump 2 ship has is the fuel, which is
only a very minor component of operating expenses (which include berthing
costs, fuel, environment, salaries, mortgage, and payment ahead on the
annual maintanence).  There is also, of course, the loss of volume to
consider.  This varies with the design system used.

Yes, and Yes.  Ian Whitchurch\'s "Grand Unified TRaveller Trade Theory"
message will be forwarded to you (since the list has seen it before) along
with some more modest articles.  Jo Grant has a few recent messages
regarding the viability of longhaul trade where he uses, as a basis for
prospective trade, some standard items from the MT encyclopedia.

There is a great emphasis on Canon here and trying to make the theoretical
realities of traveller fit with the published facts.  1000cr per ton is the
published fact, if a theory of trade can be developed that will support
this then a minimum of "canon disruption" is caused, leaving the background
intact.  My own theory is that the Imperium dictates the rate, and most
traders make their money on prospective cargos, filling otherwise unused
space with freight.

Many player ships are not designed as freighters, but are pressed into
service as such.

Granted, if anything such external tanks would be *more* susceptible

There were a few fuel hits on the internal damage tables that would
erode your total fuel tankage, and a critical hit result that shattered your
internal fuel tanks altogether. In HG, critical hits were caused by hits from
weapons with a higher factor than your ship\'s size class, IIRC. These
were most often BFG\'s, but secondary weapons could do hits like these
to sub-1000 ton vessels - not that you\'d have much use for such things
in the line of battle.

Well, a completely immobile station IS pretty much screwed. All it takes is a
spy to record its position and get the information out to attackers. But, if you
have SOME maneuverability, like inducing drag to drop you into a lower orbit or
tugging the station with ships, this information gets volatile and is only
valuable for a short period of time before the base is out of position.

The next part of the equation is making long range sensor locks impossible. Its
easier if you\'re in the neighborhood of a gas giant. You can orbit sensor
platforms around the gas giant to pick up incoming jumpships. Also orbit weapons
platforms to engage anybody not sending the proper ID code.  Since jumpships
come out of J-space at 100 Diameters, the gas giant\'s gravity well can give you
a couple hours.  Then, you hide your base in orbit and spoof your weapons
platforms and sensor platforms to give off the same readings.  Now, the spinal
mounts need to find a speck on the sun and make sure its the right speck.
Meanwhile they\'ve got to dodge through the debris of rocks and small moons.

No. What needs to happen is us economics gearheads need to figure out how
it works in detail, then we need to build a simplified but still working
model that is usable and enjoyable for non-economics gearheads.

The Imperial Credit, by the way, is worth exactly what people think they
can buy with it - nothing more, nothing less (it\'s a fiduciary currency). I
can imagine an interstellar currency based on lumps of some useful metal
(eg lanthanum, which is used for jump grids), but the Imperial Credit
doesnt have such a base.

I disagree with you on almost everything here *grin*

Buying a starship is well beyond the resources of a starting starship-free
party. Even using every undocumented trick in the book (MCr40 stripped-down
ship built with 20% bulk-construction discount, with another 40% discount
for being built TL11 credits in a TL15 Imperium with a final 40% discount
for being 40 years old), you still get a deposit in the megacredit range.

Secondly, it isnt easy to make ships disappear, unless you assume that a
starship creates no paperwork.

But you are right, interest costs on a starship-sized investment are so
high as to make some pretty impressive security procedures worthwhile.

The best answer to these questions, in my view, involves another question :
"How far are you prepared to take the cargo ?".

I think we should get a big push on to get Traveller trade beyond
shuttle-runs from world to world, and into trading between worlds a sector
apart. 

Have someone approach the party with an option of half a dozen
only-one-owner TL11 grav tanks, and a red hot tip on a planetary government
30 parsecs away that might just be in the market for them ... he\'ll come
along for the ride, and assist with the paperwork ...

*gulp* does this mean I have to finish GUTTT with currency valuation effects ?

*thinks* if I ask really really nicely, I might be able to get someone else
to cut the code neccessary to do a trade matrix for the entire Imperium ...

Very-long distance trade is exteremly viable, once you drop the Cr 5000 per
displacement tons average cargo value, and jack it up to something more
realistic, like Cr50-500 000 per dton.

Of course, then the optimal moneymaking strategy becomes owning the cargo
and leasing the ship *grin*

Nope. Doesnt work. At all. All it does is turn what is in actuality freight
(ie cargo that is really owned by someone else) temporarily into
speculative cargo (you buy it off x for y, with the agreement you will sell
it to z for y+real freighting costs). You can thus charge real freight
costs, and evade the silly Cr1000 per jump mandated price.

Sort of. I am impressed by a lot of the trader ships that went into the

WOW! Well done!

One quibble:

Not having yeasts means either: a) no beer or wine, or any alcoholic
beverages or b) having a perfectly viable substitute, in which case you
get leavened bread somewhere along the line, _particularly_ if you\'re
brewing beer or wine in the vicinity. 

It\'ll happen by accident, someday someone makes a batch of bread and
doesn\'t cook it right away. They come back and notice it\'s a _lot_
bigger. But they\'re broke and bake it anyway. Then they spend a LONG
time trying to figure out how they did it because it tastes so good ;-)

This is hard from a signature standpoint - since stations are big, and
since they need navigation beacons and lights and stuff so people can 
dock with them.

Even if it was practical, it only works if the station has some 
capability to maneuver - otherwise one just notes down its position while
passing through peacefully one day, and then comes back three months later
and hammers the station. Non-maneuvering-targets are incredibly vulnerable
to long-range thruster-powered kinetic-energy weapons - even with good
point defence (which I\'m a strong believer in) you can use submunitions
deployed well outside of point defence range. (Sam\'s Giant Death Missiles -
whatever their limitiations against maneuvering targets - are Certain Death
for a space station with no maneuver capability.) 

I would say that therefore almost all space installations should have
a small maneuver capability - 0.1 or 0.01 G would be enough - and change
their orbit slightly every week or so. Even then, they\'re vulnerable to 
various forms of attack; space stations that even remotely expect to get
attacked should probably be built out of asteroids with lots of ability
to absorb damage. They should also have a fairly thick network of defensive
sub-stations a couple of hexes out for defence against kinetic energy
missiles.

Jo Grant might be willing.  He\'s already done PE stats for the entire

Working with Merchant Prince et al, filling the hold with speculative cargo
is not always possible becaus (1) the amount of cash on hand is
insufficient to buy up a full hold or (2) (on smaller pop worlds - like 3-)
there is not enough cargo to fill the hold available.  In situations of
this sort there is no reason not to rent hold space to the next destination.

This is base don one campaign and may not be applicable to a larger theory
of trade, but that\'s what I\'m doing.  Oh, and prices for purchasing cargos
in MTU are much higher than the 4000-8000 from Merchant PRince.

In any case, I really liked your work from before and look forward to the
next revision.

Grain Alcohol can be made by distilling, but is a much harder thing to
"stumble on to" than fermentation with yeast.  It also means that all
alcoholic beverages are "hard" liquor rather than a less potent wine or
beer analogue.

Are the critters in fermentation (yeast) related to the critters in our
digestive system that keep us alive by aiding our digestion of otherwise
undigestible things (bacteria - e. coli and such)?  If there is no
bacterial life, humans would have a hard time living, but just because some
bacterial life exists doesn\'t mean that specifically yeast does.

Pete, who has had great fun brewing beer.

Actually, you can always use "harbor" pilots out to bring ships in on inertial
navigation. You verify the ship is non-hostile, then send your pilot crew out
to the ship. Then you face your landing lights towards the gas giant which cuts
down on the EM signature. Alot of GG moons are tidally locked, which means you
can put your landing facilities on the GG side and big cannons facing out on
the other side. Then you\'ve got a big ol\' moon to sheild you. Of course this
would be a military base during wartime.  Its rather extreme during peacetime
in trade depots.

Orbital stations would require some thrusters to keep their orbit.  Launching
craft and taking on cargo WILL affect its momentum.  You do need SOME means of
recalibrating your orbit.

I\'m thinking that a GG would do very weird things to a kinetic energy missile
once it got into the gravity well.  I\'m not saying you couldn\'t calculate the
course, I\'m just saying that the precision necessary would make it mighty
difficult.  The slightest error would get magnified and likely suck the missile
off into the gas giant. For purposes of defending against asteroids, this orbit
position would already be calculated pretty well.

There are ways to defend them.  Area jammers, a not-so-small probe network.
Orbital weapons platforms... (just put a missle launcher in orbit, controlled
as an RCV from a ground station or put in a robot brain).  Especially Hi-pop
systems are going to have some mean sensor arrays and I\'m guessing some not
insignificant protection.  Monitors and SDBs mostly.  I\'d expect at least one
monitor per hi-pop system and several squadrons of SDBs.

KKMs ("standard" ones) will go easier than DETs.  The extraordinary ones have
yet to convince me of the economic practicality.  They\'d be used in instances,
but wouldn\'t be common at all.  At least IMO.

Thank you for your patience in advance.

OK, I would like to open the following thread/topic for discussion...
Please don\'t write me directly (unless you are responding to the PS).

I am very interested in running a campaign that centers around archeology
and adventure (always adventure). I must admit I\'m at a loss as to how to go
about this without creating a logistical nightmare for the players. They
like discovery, but I am finding that too much dice rolling and complex
computation place an inordinate drag on the game; yet I want the players to
become closely involved with some of the investigations, to create a feeling
of accomplishment. To balance these two, means that I need a handle on
what\'s important and what I can wing. Also an understanding of archeology in
the far future and what it might entail if the artifacts players uncover are
more advanced (and possibly forbidden) than their current society\'s.

(PS - the ever present advertisement for players)

We are a new group who play T4 in Seattle, at Wizards of the Coast, once a
month on RPG Tourney Saturday (usually around the 25th on each month...
barring holidays). If you live in the Seattle area and are interested in
joining us for Traveler, drop me a line at: amarin@walldata.com
<mailto:amarin@walldata.com> .

I am also looking for advice on drawing new players to the game (my game).
Traveler, although obviously having a very loyal following, I am having

Only for PC ships (who generally don\'t have to pay mortgages). I never
considered a design that needed more than 50% of its hold filled (with
freight) to be worthy of being called a trader. Unfortunately a recent bug
has come to light in my spreadsheet invalidating all my previous designs
(thanks Pete, grumble). I think I have to revise my number. But, with that,
lets look at some designs...

I\'ll concentrate firstly on freight. I can do similar calculations for
high-passage and low-passage designs if there is the interest. Taking
things to their limits, here is a TL12 freighter with a capacity for
100,000t.

 CrafID: Mega Freighter, Type A, TL 12, MCr 28555.247
   Hull: 134716/336790, Disp=149685 tons, Config=1SL, Armour=40,
         Loaded=2486868 tons, Unloaded=805420 tons
  Power: 3993/9983, Fusion=359370Mw, Duration=30/90
   Loco: 2694/6736, Maneuver=1, 2694/6736, Jump=1, NOE=160, Cruise=750,
         Top=1000, Vacuum=1200
  Commo: Radio=System
Sensors: PasEMS=Interstellar, ActEMS=Far Orbit, ActObjScan=Routine,
         ActObjPin=Routine, PasEngScan=Routine
    Def: DefDM=4
Control: Computer=6x3, Panel=Dynamic Linkedx75339, Environ=all
 Accomm: Crew=232.1, (Bridge=20.1, Engineer=154, Maint=18, Command=32,
         Steward=7, Medical=1), Staterooms=232.1, SubCraft=4t x 1
  Other: Cargo=100000t, Fuel=24552t, FuelPurify=24 hours, ObjSize=Large,
         EmLevel=Strong

This design breaks even when carrying 78% or more filled. Interestingly, a
large percentage of the expenses are for fuel. If you assume that it is
going to do wilderness refueling then it only needs to fill 52% of its
holds with freight. The effective cost per ton of cargo shipped is 783Cr
and 521Cr.

On the opposite end here is a freighter carrying only 200t of cargo:

 CrafID: Minimal Freighter, Type A, TL 12, MCr 76.835
   Hull: 277/692, Disp=308 tons, Config=1SL, Armour=40, Loaded=5600 tons,
         Unloaded=2218 tons
  Power: 8/21, Fusion=741Mw, Duration=30/90
   Loco: 6/14, Maneuver=1, 6/14, Jump=1, NOE=160, Cruise=750, Top=1000,
         Vacuum=1200
  Commo: Radio=System
Sensors: PasEMS=Interstellar, ActEMS=Far Orbit, ActObjScan=Routine,
         ActObjPin=Routine, PasEngScan=Routine
    Def: DefDM=2.5
Control: Computer=1.5x3, Panel=Dynamic Linkedx585, Environ=all
 Accomm: Crew=2, (Bridge=1, Engineer=1), Staterooms=2, SubCraft=4t x 1
  Other: Cargo=200t, Fuel=51t, FuelPurify=24 hours, ObjSize=Average,
         EmLevel=Faint

This design requires 99% usage for breakeven when buying fuel, and 72%
usage when skimming. The effective cost per ton of cargo shipped is 988Cr
and 718Cr.

Of significant note is that the majority of the cost of the ship (62%) is
in the maneuver drive/power plant. Someone convinced me that specialised
longhaul freighters can make due with engines that accelerate at only .05G.
Profits increase sharply if you do that (54%/33% and 537Cr/331Cr for the
100,000t model, 69%/48% and 693Cr/479Cr for the 200t model, but you\'d be
mad to run with a small ship that couldn\'t land on a planet). I can see a
model similar to X-boats where you had jump ships with no maneuver drive at
all.

Once I designed a refinery station, which was basically a big take with a
fuel purification processor and some tenders. I must do that again to see
how much it _actually_ costs to collect and refine fuel. Or design some
fuel tenders for the supertankers, since fuel is such a large part of the
running costs...

Anyway, in every system it has been possible to design profitable ships
running freight at 1000Cr/jump. I do not advocate even thinking of changing
the cost of freight. Rather the opposite, I think the idea of saying that
the value of the Imperial Credit is based on a fixed cost of trade to be
very plausible. It explains the similar prices, lack of inflation, and low
interest rates throughout the history of the Imperium.

Jo

Here\'s my outline for running an archaeological campaign;

First, I would establish some sketchy background information of several of
the local (to the subsector) pre-Imperial cultures.  These will include (in
the Spinward Marches for example) Darrian Colonies, Ziru Sirka failed
colonies, relics of many non-starfarers of human and humanoid races, and,
of course, The Ancients; probably I\'d roll 2d12 for each habitable planet
and place relics there on a roll of 1-2, then use a similar roll or set of
rolls to essentially create a UPP for each culture.  Many would predate
even the Ancients, some may be relics of a society still existant on the
planet.

These are a smokescreen.  My second step would be to create a spacefaring
culture which once spread across many planets in the area, but left just a
few clues to their existence.  The idea is to have a problem with clues
that need to be put together; Perhaps a star map on a storage media (a
durable one), but the players need to find an example of the reader to
reverse engineer, and they must recognize the reader when they see it.

This might lead the players to other clues...and so on.  Meanwhile there
would be a band of competing archaeologists or perhaps site poachers who
are trafficing in contraband artifacts (which happen to be fashionable on
Vland these days), or maybe a group who say they are decended from race xyz
whose site we are desecrating, or perhaps all of the above at different
times.

Now for what Ithink you questionis related to;  When actually looking for
artifacts there are two possible methodologies;

1). personally exploring the site and picking up random items,
photographing ruins, etc.  Takes a day or two.

There is very little chance of new discovery (barring a recent earthquake
or other plot device) but information can be collected, etc.

2). Running a full blown "Dig" complete with gravitic earthmoving, large
crews of Grad Students, etc.  Takes months or even years.

This is the "real" method of archaeology.  Cities are revealed, remains,
artifacts and other detrious are examined, tagged, stored, and information
and conclusions are published.

In my preparations for my \'planted\' culture I will make a bunch of drawing
of the pertinent artifacts, cuneiforms, structures, etc.  This is where the
\'puzzle\' will be buried (preferably among a lot of distractions), and it
will take the brains of the players to somehow figure this out.  Eventually
the puzzle will reveal itself completely, but by then it will probably be
too late; the players will be required to act on partial information
inorder to "win" in the planned fashion (which doesn\'t prevent them from
winning in an unplanned fashion).

There, that\'s enough.  I may want to play this myself at some point and I
don\'t want to give too much away.  (this much he\'ll figure out, right Jo?)

You already seem to be drawing on your Friendly Local Game Store for a
locale.  I suggest seeing if the nearest large University has a gaming club
mailing list and inviting any of those folks.

I also suggest seeing if family members (sisters/brothers, cousins,
uncles/aunts/nephews/neices) would find it interesting to "try out" a
session or two.  Don\'t limit yourself to experianced gamers - the  point is
to make experienced gamers out of inexperienced ones.  I had a great time
with a mixed group of older and younger folks - from 12 yo to 40 yo - I
made the younger folks play relatively younger characters (though not as
young as they were) and we did quite well.

	I have to disagree. The Imperial Credit is backed by the fact
	than any Imperial Subsidary Liner or Trader has to carry one
	displacement ton one jump for 1000Cr, and that is has to carry
	high, medium and low passage at standard rates. For this reason
	the IC did\'nt show inflation, even if local currencies did when
	a single government deceided to invent own lumps. Those government
	had gone back to IC based currency using the TL/StarPort conversion
	most times. Only Lancian governments had shown some the anti
	vilani tradition of having own currencies, and extrem tax when
	exchanging them to IC, until Arabelatra stoped them to do so.

	So the Imperial Credit is backed by the Imperial Fleet. And this
	is of course not only the trade fleet (subsidaries) but also escord
	and war fleet.

	Trolling: The US-$ shows a similar think. Its not backed by US
	production, but by US security. Overrating of the US-$ caused a
	financial collpase in the tiger states (japan, korea, ...) last
	year.

	BackToTrav: Perhaps similiar things also happens to low tech
	worlds, as the starport exchange table gives them the advantage
	in terms of trade (imho).

	The Rurevayn (Gushemege Trade Va^h^hEmpire) has 3 types of starports :

	- JumpPorts in size of 9000 - 750.000 tons. Those ports are perhaps
	  better called fabrication ships. The smaller ones jump with
	  the fleets and are able to host fregate to destroyer sized ships,
	  while the larger ones are only seen in central Rurevayn. The base
	  design is a J2 to J4 tanker. So if they are under attack, they
	  just jump away.

	- Astroid-HighPorts those are badly called maneuverable, but they
	  they are not sitting ducks. They have the advantage of huge
	  power plant, a meson screen bigger then the battleships guns,
	  and more solid rock than any particle accellerator can penetrate.
	  They have deep mount meson guns, and lot of missiles. And of
	  course they also have the sensor advantage because of a large
	  number of prelaunched sensor drones.

	- Subsidary-Downports those are the easy targets. Backwater planets
	  with a so called trade port. Most are not more than a shuttle, a
	  lake and a fuel purification plant. If they have an automatic
	  fabrication facility they are decleard B. If they also have
	  an technical university (that is building one 200dt TL:10
	  Yacht per term using an own AFF-10) its called Tl:A-Class:A.
	  Often the shipyard follows soon to justifiy this classification.

	  The base defense in the C package is HELL. HELL is translated
	  for high energy laser lauch, and of course classified civilian.
	  Its primary intended for launching sattalites between 20 and
	  90kg. But can also stop small frigate sized ships. Often the
	  shuttle is armed and also serves as a revenue cutter. Some
	  governments can also pay of pack of SDB\'s and orbital fighters.
	  The wealthier ask for a meson deep mount and sensor network.

	But the most important thing, is of course forward defense. The
	Rurevayn CruRons secure Trade within 15 parsec around Imaparlu,
	while the ScoutRons can be seen anywhere within Gushemege and
	parts of Vland. The human transponder doctrine and the body swap
	ensures that homocidal motivated awaken does\'nt have a chance of
	even getting near one of the valuable ports. At least not without
	warning.

Distilling from _what_ is the question. _All_ distilled beverages on
Earth start with fermented beverages. The alcohol comes from the
metabolic action of the yeasts just as in beer. All distillation does is
concentrate the alcohol to higher concentrations that that available
from fermentation alone (roughly 21% max IIRC). 

A friend of mine who brews regularly, tried a fruit beer that turned out
horribly...so he got the bright idea to cook it up in a still. He
managed to turn out a quite passable brandy-like stuff.

(BTW, yes, it _is_ legal in the US to distill up to (again, IIRC) about
a gallon of spirits per household per year for personal use, this under
the same laws that allow home beer and winemaking. You are not allowed
to sell it, or make more than the legal amount, which is where the
moonshiners so beloved of Southern folklore got into trouble with the
Revenooers.)

Nope. In fact, they\'re more closely related to US than they are to the
bacteria in our gut, (which makes yeasts nasty when they turn
pathogenic. Good thing, too, else we\'d get a helluva good buzz out of
your average high-carbo pasta meal ;-)

There _are_ some bacterial-based beverage fermentation processes (lambic
beer has at least one bacterial fermentation step, although I don\'t know
if that\'s the same step that produces the alcohol. There was a good
article on Lambic beermaking in one of last years Scientific American
issues), but the most reliable alcohol producing ones use yeast.

Of course, this doesn\'t mean that some native Vilani microorganism
doesn\'t make alcohol out of vilani carbohydrates, or whatever chemical
that Vilani based life uses.

We currently share one world of finite resources. Our economy is generally
based on the relative scarcity of resources.  Take away the scarcity and what
happens?  You might have lost your economy.

Ah, but what if the costs of producing a starship are significantly less on one
world, for whatever reason.  The costs of transportation are thus lower.  As
you say, its Canon.  Thats why I say, let sleeping dogs lay, as a practical
matter.  For the intellectual fun, have at it!

And what you can get for it is dependant upon a huge confluence of factors.What
is it worth to the world that doesn\'t trade with the Imperium?  Bupkiss.
Of course, you\'re speaking of cash, which is only one type of money.  Cash is
really debt.  In many ways, its a promise to pay.  To pay what?  Well, it used
to be a promise to pay gold or silver of a set amount.  But now?  I don\'t
know.  Some econ. wiz will have to tell us.  However, I suggest that whatever
that answer to that question is, it will be of doubtful application to the
interstellar environment.  With so many worlds, and gas giants, its seems that
you can\'t tie it to any resource.  I\'m certainly interested in any
suggestions.  (I\'m assuming that this whole conversation is non-Canonical, so I
hope there is a creative answer out there.  IMHO, the Canon on this, tying the
credit to transportation costs is a necessary fiat for playability, but fails
any \'realistic\' examination).

Sure debating is always fun.  I just fear that the ultimate conclusion will be
thatwhat we understand to be \'realistic\' economics and market theory, will
completely
fall in the interstellar context.

I really like what Peter Hamilton uses in his Reality Dysfunction and
Neutronium Alchemist novels.  He uses a "fuseodollar."  The fusion engines in
his story universe run on H3 (tritium) and it is available only from gas giants
(I don\'t know if thats scientifically accurate, but it works for me).  All of
the gas giants and the manufacture/containment/whatever of H3 is controlled.
Of course, it also may be unrealistic, but at least there is a nod to the
incredible complexity and dificulty of maintaining an interstellar economy.

I don\'t know about the effects on Canon, but I would only use the 1000Cr/ton,
and the whole trade system in T4, for "standard" cargos.  Thankfully, my PCs
aren\'t really into the freighting idea, but when they do, I try to jazz it up
with a specific product that has a specific price at the intended market (at
least it had one before the jumped there, it might have changed).  Of course,
weapons of the highest available TL are always good cargo, and usually ripe
with potential adventure hooks.

Id idn\'t follow the original thread, so I wasn\'t sure if we were talking about
civilian or military facilities...but even military (free-space, as opposed
to buried-on-a-moon) facilities are fairly easy to detect unless you spend vast
amounts of money on MilBlack coatings, etc. Even then, a 100,000 dTon object
lurking close to a gas giant is probably detectable by a medium-large sensor   
at a few million km.

True, but you need substantial accelerations (tenth of a G) to avoid
submunitions deployed at the ~100,000 km range.

>I\'m thinking that a GG would do very weird things to a kinetic energy missile
>once it got into the gravity well.

One would fire missiles with their own guidance capability and moderate
(a couple of G) acceleration.

Attack profile for a raider against a mostly-civilian station would be 
to jump in a few hundred million km away, pre-accelerated to several thousnad
km/s relative to the target station. You detect the (civilian) station with 
your sensors, adjust your position slightly for
jump error and lob a couple of dozen relatively cheap (HEPlaR-powered)
missiles at it; the missiles coast until they\'re detectable (at perhaps a 
few hundred thousand km), then fire up their drives, correct their course,
and deploy a few hundred 10-kg SuperDense rods. The station only has a 
couple of minutes warning.

In 30 seconds at 0.01 G the station can only move a hundred meters; for a     
big station most of the rods will hit. Point defence - unless it\'s fully
automated and very high tech - won\'t be able to catch most of the rods 
either. Each rod hits like a dreadnaught spinal mount. 

The defence is to have enough pickets with high-quality active sensors to 
detect the missiles and destroy them before they deploy their submunitions
(or really good system control sensors that spot the launching craft.) 

Military stations might be harder to pinpoint, which means the missiles have
to have their own terminal sensors and start maneuvering earlier, so you
get a more elaborate duel between active defences - but you can spend a lot
more effort and money, too, so big T-plate missiles become cost-effective.

Normally I\'m in the skeptic\'s corner on the effectiveness of Giant Death
Missiles, but against big fixed targets, they\'re very dangerous. Orbital
installations that aren\'t hidden on moons or deep inside asteroids are in
serious trouble if a war gets nasty. (Of course, so are civilian populations - 
civilians on a planetary surface are nearly undefendable too; civilian 
survival in wartime is mostly a matter of courtesy.)

We don\'t disagree.  However, I think the Imperial Credit must be subsidized, and
prices may even be fixed, because without such safeguards, inflation would be a
tremendous danger to the economy.

Sure, but acquiring that sum depends on the size of the party and whether they\'re
trying to puchase it day one after chargen or not.

Wait a second, I\'m not familiar with all these tricks.
Say the ship cost 30 MCr.
- -20% for bulk construction = 24 MCr
- -40% for TL 11 = 19.2 MCr
- -40% for 40 years old = 11.5 MCr.

A 20% down payment is 2.3 MCr.
8 3-term PCs with lucky cash rolls could afford this.

They\'re easy to blow up, misjump, float adrift, get stolen, etc.  I guess this

But If I expect to make a return of 5% off owning the ship 
(as a megacorp who bought it outright) and amortise it over 
40 years, then I need to get 856 Cr per ton/trip (at 25 
trips per year, 100% capacity) to cover the expected 
profit. If I get 78% capacity, I need to earn 1098 Cr per 
ton trip.
If I add on costs it gets worse - over 1000 per ton per 
trip at 100% (same assumptions). 

Drop the expected rate of return to 0%, but still amortise 
over 40 years, and the PROFIT per ton needed at 100% 
capacity is 285 Cr. Remember - this isn\'t counting costs. 
Why would a megacorp buy a trading ship that didn\'t return 
any money?

And this ship requires (at 0% return, but amortised over
40 years) 384Cr per ton trip Profit at 100% capacity. Add 
that to the costs you give, and it won\'t break even long 
term even at 100%

But haven\'t you already suggested that the TAS can get at 
least 5% return on money depositied with them as 
memberships? How do they do that? Investment? If normal 
investment returns in excess of 5% then why doesn\'t 
starship economics return similar amounts. If it doesn\'t 
then why do people invest in starships?

I mean, even if a jump 1 is fixed at 1000 Cr/ton, why is a
jump 2 exactly the same price? We know the costs are
higher (mostly for fuel, but it\'s also a more expensive
ship), If there is only a J1 ship, it costs me 2000 Cr and
takes twice as long to get my ton of cargo 2 parsecs- why
can\'t the J2 ship charge 2000 Cr with a promise of getting
it there sooner? At least that would be a start.

If my players end up running a trading ship, then I have to
have the economics make sense to me or my suspension of

The only thing an Imperial Credit is worth to a non-Imperial planet is 
something to buy Imperial goods with - or something to trade with 
someone who wants to buy them. If neither of those factors apply,
bring some trade goods to barter with (or sell for local currency), as
your Imperial Credits are about as valuable as banana peels.

If I were a TL-7 President, and some alien showed up with a hold full
of TL-9 medicines, anti-grav plates, and other wonderful things, I\'d be
happy if he paid me for my radioactives, artworks and such with 
banana peels - if he were willing to accept those banana peels for
the treasures in his hold. If all I had were the promise that other traders
might show up and offer me stuff for those banana peels, I\'d be a bit
more cautious - and probably go for barter.

I have a copy of the _Justifiers_ sci-fi RPG, it represents a corporate-
controlled society dominated by one of the megacorps. Trans-Stellar (I think) 
had a monopoly on the secret of Interstellar Travel, and managed (through 
murderous and secret commando raids) to keep others from discovering the 
secret. One day the board of Trans-Stellar proclaimed that they would pay 
for everything in Trans-Stellar credits that were worth such-and-such, and 
would only accept Trans-Stellar credits for things like FTL drives, parts for 
such drives, training in how to use them, etc. Almost overnight, the Stellar
was the only medium of trade. The game was set in a period of early
exploration, it didn\'t explore what would happen to this society when the
corporate state met another civilization that didn\'t need Trans-Stellar\'s
clunky FTL tech.

Archaeologically based - the Sky Raiders Trilogy from Fasa.

I think the key is, not to get bogged down in the actual archaeology part.
While the results are fascinating, the actual digging up of objects on site
is incredibly boring (I was planning on a career in Archaeology, until I
discovered this). I don\'t see how it would get any less boring in the
future, unless you use robots.

So, I\'d gloss over on the dig part, but highlight the objects discovered.
Try to think up some weird objects, and have the players try to puzzle them
out.  Have one of the objects seem to lead to some sort of legendary prize
- - a lost city (or planet) of riches, the fountain of youth, the secret of
Jump-10, whatever, and then the players try to track down the prize - by
looking at other ruins for clues and maps, tracking down grizzled old
explorers, etc.

Don\'t use dice for this (skill check or whatever), make a drawing of the
artifact, and show it to the players. If they are dense, use an NPC to
nudge their minds to a correct solution, or make them search for someone
that can decipher the artifact (but will need the players to do him a
favor).

Also play up the superstition angle - if there are natives of the planet
doing most the work, have them be frightened about the \'curse\' or
something...

You also need a nemesis, who is also looking for the big prize, but wants
to use it for evil purposes......and the characters will have to fight
against mainstream archaeologists, who tend to be somewhat narrow minded
when it comes to legendary prizes or controversial theories.

In other words, try to follow the Indiana Jones movies, or maybe even the
Dirk Pritt novels. They\'re not good archaeology, but they\'re exciting.

Firstly, being grossly undercapitalised is a good way to go broke in any
business. Personally, I find it very hard to believe that anyone with any
signifigant equity at all in a starship cannot borrow a couple of
megacredits for a couple of months essentially on request.

Secondly, if there isnt enough speculative cargo on hand to fill the hold,
why should there be enough freight ?

The big problem with this is the cost of trade, as denominated in Imperial
Credits falls as the Imperium becomes more technologically advanced.

This is because cargo is carried in ships that are themselves bought with
local currencies.

Imagine for a second that we have a trade route for which the optimum ship
is a jump-2 ship. In a TL11 empire, the ship will have to be a
state-of-the-art vessel, as good as anything used by the Navy. Now, lets
fast-forward a thousand years to a rich, happy and decadent TL15 empire ...
with a TL11 shipyard in it.

Now, this planet wants to earn hard currency so it can buy TL15 goods.
Therefore, it dicounts the price of it\'s ships by 30%, but only if you pay
in Imperial Credits.It does this, because who would buy a TL11 ship if it
costs the same as a state of the art vessel ?

A merchant wanting to do the jump-2 run could therefore borrow less money
(leading to lower ship payments) for a ship that could do the run. Since
his costs are lower, either his profits are higher (which will pull
competitors in when they notice) or she can lower her prices to get more
freight. Most probably, the second thing will happen in the long run.

See my above point about worlds with undervalued currencies building
starships whose earnings are in hard currencies.

They called it the \'Greenback Inflation\' & it\'s where we get the slang term

the passing of the Federal Reserve Act.

The content-heavy portions of my pages (the guns, the upcoming starships
and Lunion pages) are done in a more standard dark over light format.  It
is the ability to do spectacular things that makes the web so attractive.
I have  a huge mucking .GIF on my Traveller page, but most people love it.

98% of my visitors come in using some form of Netscape or IE.  I have to
design for the majority.

I always welcome feedback on my pages.. everyone has either a mail link or

Well, imagine my shame.  Why then is it in my head, and several texts, that it was
Nixon?
Perhaps he did something slightly different?  Perhaps, having to do with the
Federal Reserve Bank?  I\'ll concede the point for now, with apologies to Peter, but
I\'ll also do some research.

Ok, we\'re dealing with different \'Gold Standards\' here. Prior to 1912, US
currency was redeemable in gold, after in silver. In the 50\'s IIRC we went to
the current \'Federal Reserve Note\' backed, theoretically by the US Gold
reserves, but US citizens couldn\'t hold gold as currency, redeem the notes in
anything, and the dollar was pegged at $35/troy oz gold.

What Nixon did was to allow US citizens to buy gold again (as currency for
speculation) and float the dollar vs. gold, having the effect of putting the
dollar into the world money markets, where every currency has only a relative
value to other currencies.

This was in an effort to end the raging inflation and trade imbalances we were
facing.

It may have worked, but taken a long time. (like until now, and required a
merciless hand on the Federal Reserve Rate, may Saint Greenspan preserve us.
:-/ (sarcasm, guys, sarcasm!) Of course, now we\'re into a new economic model,
and all our theories are pretty well shot, so we\'re still shooting in the
dark, and don\'t know if we\'re in a unprecedented sustained boom, or at the
35th floor of a 60 floor building...as the jumper said "So far, so good!"

The relevance to Traveller really depends on what kind of monetary policy the
Imperium follows. From the fixed pricing of freight and passenger carriage, I
suspect that the Imperial credit _is_ pegged, at the shipping costs of one
displacement ton/one parsec. After all, it _is_ a mercantile empire, and rules
\'the space between the stars\'.

What I\'m not enough of an economist to say, (and was too young when the US
economy was run that way to remember) is what this does to local currencies
and balances of trade vis-a-vis the member states, and the long term effects
of this kind of monetary policy.

What happens, for instance, when the real costs of shipping go up or down? I
think you get either re-valuation of the currency, or uncontrollable
in/deflation of the currency, right?

to ask a question that\'s been bothering me since I first 
started playing Traveller. It\'s always seemed a little silly
for someone who could afford the 20% downpayment of a MCr30
item to actually part with all that cash just to knock
themselves out trying to make payments for 40 years. So the
question is:

Why *wouldn\'t* a GM want to knock a zero off the price of
any starship/spaceship?

This would still price the things out of the range of most
people while making it easier to make a profit off the
carrying of freight, not to mention the carrying of
supercargo. PCs would still be stuck with the payments,
etc., etc. After all, even a launch would still cost
MCr1.4 by dropping a decimal place. 20% of MCr1.4 is
Cr280,000, an amount most PCs don\'t have initially. A GM
could even alter the payoff period from 40 years to 30
or even 20 to modify monthly payments. Heck, let the PCs
*choose* from a number of amortization periods just like
we all can when taking out a car purchase loan.

Doing so would also help justify the existance of
smaller ships versus the massive ones currently
under discussion. Wouldn\'t banks be *lowering* their
risk by providing loans for many, smaller ships
rather than a single massive ship? Although I can
see the roll a massive ship can play under certain
circumstances, isn\'t it easier to fill a small ship
than a 100,000dton monster?

Has this been discussed before? Any thoughts?

IIRC, Nixon jammed through some legislation allowing American citizens to won 
gold bullion.  It *USED* to be illegal except for jewelry.

Makes sense.  After all, what kind of specie metal are you going to peg it to 
that can\'t be created at ridiculously high tech levels?  The instant the money 
supply expands, you get inflation.

SOT:  You guys ever read Schizmatrix?  They used a bunch of different 
\'currencies\' backed by all kinds of things, from gold to pharmaceuticals to 
sex.  Made for some interesting reading...

I remember reading about currency transports a few times in CT.  Plus, one 
adventure in the *OLD* JTAS talked about a shipment of cash for the qarterly 
payroll of some Imperial troups, lost in a lake on a Tech 7 balkanised world, 
right on the border of a country that was basically Nazi Germany and the other 
was the Soviet Union.

Fun stuff.  Especially when both sides had atomic weapons *AND* were 
xenophobes to the max.

Assume the monster freighters (over 20,000 dt) are on regular lines.  Most 
info I\'ve seen on freight lines under CT/HG use 5000 to 10000 dt hulls.  Bulk 
freighters are sort of like current freighters on Earth here, they carry 
standard cargo \'cans\' or holds that are basically tanks for liquids.  These 
carry the majority of cargo on the major lanes, which ties into the cargo 
rules in CT pretty good.  The \'leftovers\', odd lots, and speculative cargo is 
where the smaller (under 1000 dt) hulls start being profitable.  I\'ve *NEVER* 
run a CT ship and made payments & maintanance *WITHOUT* speculative trading.  
The rules are set up to keep the PCs a bit on the broke side, and rightly so.  
Broke PCs adventure.

Gotta *HAVE* alcohol there to begin with.  No yeast means no alcohol in the 
brew.  I\'m assuming there was a \'yeastoid\' critter somewhere on Vland that 
they tamed to make their booze with.  One thing they drilled into my head was, 
if there is an ecological niche to fill, *SOMETHING* will evolve to fill it.  
Of course, this \'yeastoid\' will be a closely guarded secret...

Nope.  Yeasts are more closely related to fungi, IIRC.  Different class of critter from bacteria.

Agreed.  Kind of like shooting through a bush to get the grunt behind it.  The

Which things?  The sub-1000 dt boats?  Sure you would, especially in TNE, 
where maintaining a BCB would be a *real* bitch.  From what I gather of the HG 
rules, *anything* that can produce an internal explosion, whether meson/paws 
or nuke, can hit tankage.

The way I\'ve handled external tankage is, you know the size of the boat plus 
the tanks.  If the boat itself is 80% of the total, it takes 80% of the hits.  
That\'s 4 of 5 for the mathematically challanged.  Throw percentage dice (left 
over from that Other Treehugging Game We Played As Kids Before We Knew 
Better), and anything over 80% hits the tanks.  Resolve it as normal, against 
an armour factor of *0* (CT/HG).

As per \'pressurised tanks\', I don\'t believe in them.  You can only compress a 
liquid so far.  Even a liter of water in the Marianas Trench has the same 
volume *AND MASS* as a liter that comes out of your kitchen faucet.  It\'s just 
under *humumgous* pressure because it\'s got a couple of *MILES* of water 
sitting on top of it.  Since LHyd is already as \'packed\' as it can be, there\'s 
no real reason for high pressures.  Thus the Factor 40 armour on MT tanks 
makes zero sense to me, assuming that you attach the tankage in orbit at a 
high port. It just has to get you to the jump point, and no special 
engineering would be needed as it would only be *just strong enough* to do the 
job.  Why overbuild it?

I *also* treat external dismountable tanks as *hulls*, since they have to be 
more durable.  YMMV.

The difference is between gaseous and liquid states.  At temperatures higher than 100C, the pressure required to keep water liquid increases dramatically.

In the case of LHyd, you\'ve got to keep it down near 0K or increase the pressure greatly.  Optionally, you could let the temperature go up and just let the volume increase as well.

  This is along the lines of what I was thinking, i.e., very complex processes at
work.  And not worth the trouble, for game play at least, but fun to think about.
Hopefully, we can solve this problem by the time we have a real need for
an interstellar economy.  ;-)

Because a ship costs a certain amount to produce.
If you want the PCs to get a ship, there are lots of ways to
do that.  But reducing the cost by a power of 10 would be
an unrealistic way of doing it, because that 30 MCr ship
costs that much for a reason.

My plan is

(a) get GUTT working. This will give us a static model of imports and
exports by type (cheap, moderate, expensive and military) for all worlds in
a trading area (once we link it in to PE, you can get a dynamic model). 

(b) analyse the trade patterns of, say, the Spinward Marches

(c) write up the major trade routes

(d) build trade tables for worlds based on their \'profile\'

(e) get people to playtest it.

Let me tell you a dark economic history secret. Inflation is the historical
norm, and is reasonably harmless to an economy. You can even survive
hyper-inflation. As long as the rate of price increase is reasonably
stable, you can discount against it easily.

Deflation, on the other hand, is a horror. We dont know if you can get out
by yourself, either - prolonged deflation has usually ended up in major
exogenous shocks (ie wars).

Making a decision to spend money on capital investment is a lot harder when
you know your money will be worth more tomorrow than it is today, and that
the goods your capital investment will produce will be worth less. Turning
money into less money isnt what capitalism is based on, after all ...

Maybe. But it isnt likely they will all be that lucky. Banks may also get
leery about lending money with a 40 year repayment schedule secured on a 40
year old starship.

BTW those tricks come out of the Mercenary "bulk buying" rules (ok, they
were thinking of buying 5.56mm rounds in bulk, not Far Traders *grin*), the
Striker local credit value rules and the traditional 10% per 10 years old
discount for old starships (which dates from Little Black Book 2, I think).

OK. This is off memory. Will someone near a University library please go an
look up \'Bretton Woods\' in a copy of the New Palgrave Dictionary of
Economics ?

In the 1930s, the world moved from having the UK Pound as the world reserve
currency to the US Dollar filling this role. This was formalised after WW2
with the Bretton Woods agreement, which fixed major world currencies
against the US dollar, and linked the US dollar to gold at a rate of $35 an
ounce.

The end of the post-war Long Boom resulted in many stresses to the Western
economies, and one of the results of this was President Nixon\'s decision to
de-link the US dollar from gold, and the adoption by almost all countries
of floating exchange rates (usually managed within a band by central banks).

Now, in the 19th century there was a similar process, except it involved
the demonitisation of silver rather than of gold. The US had traditionally
been a silver currency (see the silver dimes and dollars, as opposed to the
golden soveriegn of Britain), but in the late 19th century it moved to a
gold standard along with everybody else. This may have happened on or
around the American Civil War.

Now, to bring this ObTrav, I think we have 3 schools of thought

(1) the Credit is linked to the cost of transport

(2) the Credit is based on some physical good

and (3) the credit isnt based on anything.

I think a good compromise is that (1) applied in the First Imperium, (2)
applied in the Second Imperium (the Lanthanum Standard ?) and (3) applied
in the Third Imperium.

The deflation problem with (1) isnt really an issue in the technologically
stable First Imperium. 

The \'canon\' refusal of the Central Bank in -1776 to authorise a monetary
issue by a subsiduary that was the traditional start date of Long Night
could be explained by them refusing to authorise an issue by a bank that
didnt have the neccessary Lanthanum in stock. Hey, that even makes sense
*grin* - "We must maintain Hard Money at all costs".

The early Third Imperium traded a lot and had a technological advantage
over it\'s neighbours, so they presumably would be willing to accept
unbacked Sylean Credits. After a while, people just got used to the fact
that if you took a Sylean Credit to the Bank of Sylea, they would give you
back a nice, shiny Sylean Credit.

Does this make sense to people ?

Yeah, but we\'re talkin LHyd here, *NOT* water.  I can\'t remember the boiling 
point of LHyd, but I *do* know it\'s in the 10\'s of degrees Kelvin, *damned* 
close to Absolute Zero.

It really wouldn\'t be worthwhile to compress hydrogen to liquid.  Cheaper & 
easier to just cool it down & liquefy it.

Maybe install a \'heater\' in the \'bottom\' of the tank to boil off some LHyd at 
a reasonable flow rate to feed the reactors...

Umm... just how easy is it to chill something to near absolute zero?  Especially without something to dump the heat into?  Note that ships with purification
plants apparently do this often.  Skim gas giant at a temperature significantly higher than zero K (Gas Giants tend to radiate energy). Process the fuel in space
with no heat sink.  The only way I can see doing it is by compressing the gas into a liquid.

I think that is completely unnecessary.  IIRC, the LHyd is used as coolant for the fusion reactor.  That\'s going to heat SOME (sarcasm) of that hydrogen to a
gaseous state.

I did a little more research.  Hydrogen has a critical temperature of -240 C
and critical pressure of 12.8 atm.  Above -240 C, no amount of pressure will
liquefy hydrogen. At that temperature, it has to be under  at least 12.8
atmospheres of pressure. That means that you\'ve got to keep it under pressure
AND cold.

Note that water has critical temp of 374 C with a critical pressure of 218 Atm.
THAT is a lot of pressure.

I\'d have to agree with Keven here, against changing the prices that 
drastically.  My players are about to buy their first ship soon.  The 
fact that they need to come up with over 4 Mcr just for a down 
payment has _severely_motivated them to look for work (great 
adventuring), look for cargo (more adventuring), and save everything 
they can get their hands on!

However .... If you want your players to have a ship, look at using 
one of the standard designs (usually affording a 25% discount), or 
something used.  That might be a fun way to add adventure to the 
game.  I always think of the Millenium Falcon .... Han always having 
to kick it and pray it went into jump space just before the bad guys 
arrived!

You could also have a scout NPC that "happens" to have a ship.  They 
could then be hired on as crew, or simply use the ship to travel.  Of 
course, the expenses of running the ship are still there, just not 
the monthly payments.

Several steel sword blades have been recovered (maybe some armor as well).
Ref: _Roman Military Equipment_, (Bishop and Coulston, ISBN 0-7134-6637-5).
They could not _cast_ iron (contemporary Chinese could and did), but some
smiths could turn out crude steel. Several examples of the swords have
tempered edges welded to a nice, springy center (sorry for the lack of
technical terms here) and a couple were pattern-welded.

That said, count me among the "machineguns were probably beyond them" group,
(although Hero\'s craftsmen could probably have made a crude gatling-like
creation for show).

Starships are already shuffling megawatts of waste heat around and dumping it
out through their radiatiors. Running a refrigerator to liquify the hydrogen 
adds relatively little to this amount - just a bit more waste heat (plus
power for the refrigerator.) You don\'t need a heat sink per se - just
a place for heat to radiate away to, like empty space.

Compressing it to be a liquid is Bad - it would actually heat the 
hydrogen (depending on how you compressed it) and involve really, really,
really, really high pressures.

I would be very happy if somebody would post some errata, or point me to

  It\'s better to assume it\'s condensed, otherwise all those pretty "Fuel-1"
hits become Critical hits as tanks pop. That would be just a bit too exciting
to be around, although with advanced nanotech you might be able to unthaw
the engineering crew relatively easily :>

  I understand that they\'re both writing. William H. Keith, Jr., at least,

no idea as to whether anyone has contacted them about producing any of their

matter).

  AFAIK, they may or may not own the rights to their FASA or Gamelords

Anybody got a thermodynamics handbook handy?  How much radiator surface do you need to
dump that kind of waste heat? I know that real life nuclear power plants end up
dumping lots of heat into rivers or the ocean. I just can\'t picture dumping heat
through radiation. Its far too inefficient.  IIRC, steam turbines are like 10%
efficient?  Which means that you need to dump 10 times your electric power output in
waste heat.

Actually, I think they use the LHyd as the heat sink.  Soak the waste heat into the

Actually, I had email from Andrew Keith earlier today - they are both still
around and busy writing. You can easily track down their email address\' via
Yahoo if you have a pressing need to talk with them, but perhaps this is not
the best of times to do so - Andrew informed me that he and Bill lost both
their parents this last year - their mother less than two weeks ago. Like
me, I\'m sure you\'ll want to add your prayers and well wishes for both of
them at this time.

The current version is V0.96, this can be found at:

http://www.iinet.net.au/~mickb/software.html

I\'ve started work on V1.00 in the past few days.  New features include:

*	Native Linux support

Linux source and binaries will be available.  At this stage, I haven\'t yet
been able to port the graphics code to FPK Pascal (I\'m downloading GNU
Pascal to see if I cn use that instead).  

*	Windows 3.x based front end

At this stage, this will only be a front end to the DOS programs.  I may
produce a Win16 port in the future.

*	Improved error handling (esp. with non-standard format files)
*	Screen dumps to either PCX or BMP format  
*	Improved and rewritten documentation (HTML)


As always, any suggestions or comments are welcome.  Expect to see V1.00 in
4-6 weeks.

If they don\'t have yeast, then they don\'t have alcohol either.

It *is* possible to make alcohol via *destructive* distillation, but
that gets messy, and tends to produce methanol and a whole slew of
other nasties.

I\'ve heard tales of folks who drank some live yeast homebrew and then
had a big spaghetti dinner. End result? Some *really* wasted people.

Carbohydrates are sufficiently simple and versatile that they\'ll
probably be used by anything that evolves in a CO2 atmosphere with lots
of water around. 

There may be problems with handedness. But not all carbohydrates *have*
handedness. And ethanol *doesn\'t*, which means that if there are
yeast-like critters, they may provide a means of turning useless carbs
into something that provides some useful calories.

Actually, it can be (and likely *is*) a fair amount larger. And being a
fixed installation on a planetary surface, it\'s quite likely that they
use "long term lifesupport". In other words, plants and other goodies
to *recycle* things. A true closed cycle system rather than the open
cycle used on ships.

It\'s in "The Traveller Book". And I just dug out one of my sets of the
Little Black Books. Book 2, page 6, last sentence: "Finally, throw one
die to setermine the number of weeks spent in jump space before the
ship re-emerges at it\'s new location."

This is in chapter "Travelling", section "Starship Malfunctions",
subsection "Misjump".

Oh yeah, it\'s not 1D for distance. It\'s 1d6 *dice* for distance.

night\'s Traveller session.

The PCs were involved in a fight with some blade-wielding
tough guys who tried to rob them. The NPCs didn\'t know that
the PCs had guns (and combat armor, in one PC\'s case) when
the fight started.

However, in close quarters, a good knife is almost as good
as a gun, so the fight continued. During the course of the
fight, one of the PCs took a hit from a knife.

I play the MT rules, with some T4.1 rules mixed in. The PC
(my wife) took one MT hit, which translated to 1D6 points
of damage after the fight was over. She rolled 1 point:
a surface scratch, and not something to worry about.

Another PC, who has Medic-2, strolled over casually and
did a diagnosis roll. No problem. This particular PC was
full of confidence, because he had just save two other
PCs who were near death from knife wounds. 

He then does the roll to treat the wound and rolls
a 3D6 mishap. The patient takes additional damage. The doctor
rolls to re-diagnose successfully, but can\'t complete the
treatment in the time allocated before the wound gets more
serious. The patient takes 2D6 more damage, and her
Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance are now 002.

He finally manages to treat her without things getting 
worse. The patient is now under medical slow drug,
recovering from two separate surgeries.

My wife ain\'t amused.

When I said inflation, I really meant to include the idea of both inflation and

"Bretton Woods" rings a bell, but I confuse it with Yalta and Potsdam for some
reason. Never heard of the dictionary you mention.  (Successfully avoided all

Rentwise, the Boston area has a vacancy rate of around 1%.  Its a seller\'s

Whats a docking berth at a starport go for these days?  I\'d imagine that the
ports
at Sylea would charge a pretty penny.

Don\'t bother with GNU pascal unless you like hacking on C compilers.  The 
version I\'ve seen of it (about 9 months ago) was still pretty rough and 
involved hacking up gcc to work.  Plus, only about 70% of Turbo Pascal had

By non-standard, are you talking about Galactic-style data files?

I\'ve seen some interesting homebrewed AK47\'s cranked out by village 
blacksmiths in my time, so don\'t confuse primitive conditions with 
technological impossibilities.  A good solid reworked high tech copy of a 
lower-tech weapon could really ruin your day.  As far as machine tools go, it 
depends on how you define machine tools.  One \'lathe\' I saw was merely a tree 
branch and ropes wrapped around the part and powered by foot like an 1880\'s 
sewing machine, but the smith was turning out a pretty decent rifle barrel.  
So, from here, it looks like the Romans just needed gunpowder and decent metal 
to create guns...

Nugget:  About 20 years before, somebody carrying a TL12 copy of an AK47 got 
whacked on your TL4 backwater planet.  The local blacksmith took it apart to 
figure out how it worked.  Now there are a few thousand clones laying around...

I did manage to find a "livable" apartment in Manchester, for 575 a
month (includes heat/water/elect).  1 Bedroom, modern place, off-street
parking and close to route 93.  However it is still a "make do" since I
have insufficient funds to do otherwise.  The only thing I can think of
to do is go back to school and get some type of degree that will get me
into a job that can support me in that area.  I just have a real problem
doing the school thing.

When generating characters, we always assume they are confident
go-getter\'s who never have doubts about taking that next term of
service, or doing good.  While thinking this way speeds up the rolling
process, how realistic is it really?  Wouldn\'t some character types wash
out of service because they couldn\'t handle the strain of such
regimented living?  Would academy bound characters have to drop out
before finishing due to lack of funds?

Figure room-temperature superconductors at what, TL12 or so?  We can do low

You do *NOT* want gaseous hydrogen around!!!!!!!!!!  It\'s too explosive and 
too hard to contain because it can seep thru just about *anything*

  The "decent metal" is a big caveat. Given the empirical knowledge of
iron forging technology at the time, including the very poor understanding
(and availability) of quality smelted output, the result is more likely to
be a very expensive and inefficient pipe-bomb rather than a weapon that
you\'d want to use yourself. This assumes Roman conditions, and also that
I\'ve got the analysis right (it\'s been quite a while since I studied this
sort of stuff).

  I\'ll leave it to the experts, but cleaning out "smokeless" powder residue
is bad enough, and the gas wash is not going to be enough to operate the
recoil mechanism, I suspect, in addition to erosion problems (?) due to
metallurgical deficiencies. OC, even a semi-auto _rifle_ is going to be
really and truly awesome to have. OTOH, the cost of the hand-made brass
cartridges made result in your carrying some lower tech weapons for easy
targets.

  I still think that bronze cannon (to break up formations or gates) would
be the appropriate technology for early gunpowder applications. BTW, does
anyone know what the limitations would be on using (cast?) bronze for
shoulder-arms, besides cost?

I don\'t know about errata, electronic combat is explained on Page 8, in \'The
Vampire Highway\' section. The CV is the number of D6\'s to roll. High total
wins a round, If a puppeteer strain wins three consecutive rounds it has taken
control of the opposing system. A defending system may break off combat after
winning a round by \'firewalling\' a part of the system under attack. 

Note, this is soley for electronic combat...the ships also have norml weapons
which are resolved using normal space combat rules.

Also, playing out Virus vs. Virus encounters will probably be rare, unless the
PC\'s are trapped on one or somehow otherwise connected to the well-being of a vampire.

Finally, the only strain that will initiate electronic combat in this fashion
is the Puppeteer.

Ever see a real live AK close up?  Those puppies are *TOUGH*.  You can drop 
\'em in a swamp, run over \'em with a *TANK* fer chrissakes, and they *STILL* 
work.  And they come apart pretty easy for cleaning.  A bit of wood alcohol 
for solvent is good enough to clean \'em, & you can lube them with just about 
anything that\'s greasy in a pinch.  It\'s all in the design when you get down 
to it.

Weight.  To get a strong enough barrel uxing bronze, you\'ll have to cast it
pretty thick.  It\'d be a bitch to lug around all month.  Say, on the order of
10 to 12 pounds endweight of the weapon.  Not something you can run fast with.

In San Francisco, $575 gets you a walk-in closet and a chance to play
parking space roulette.  Dodging DPT (Dept. of Parking and Traffic, or more
often, Don\'t Park There) has become one of my roommate\'s major forms of

This is really up to the player.  I remember generating an Army Commando
who got out after three terms and didn\'t have the greatest combat skills.
I decided he had been a medic, and after his last assignment (a raid on
which he won a SEH and PH) he just couldn\'t take it anymore and resigned.
It made for an interesting character, since I played him as opposed to
deadly force.

It\'s up to the player and referee to interpret the dice to flesh out a
character.  The example in Classic of Jamison is perfect, as the dice roll,
we see a better picture of the man.  Also, remember Heinelin\'s story of the
Navy man who ended up a test pilot because that involved the least amount
of work.. be creative!

But it only costs that because when the game was originally 
designed those numbers seemed reasonable. If you wanted to 
justify cheap ships, you could, but it would alter the way 
the imperium works - all you need to do is have assumptions 
like "Lanthanum is cheap, and easy to work with an off the 
shelf auto-lathe", "High tech avionics can be built out of stock 
parts very cheaply", "Hulls can be made easily out of 
superdense created by robots using vast amounts of stunningly cheap 
power, because we have cheap plentiful fusion energy" And 
then you have cheap ships, which means cheap transport 
between the stars.

At a meta-game level you need to decide if you want 
starships to be plentiful and easy to get, or expensive and 
difficult to get. That affects whether you have privately 
owned starships, or just Corporation/govt owned ships.

Essentially, decide what you want out of your Universe, and 
you can justify it if you need to.

By self-insure, I guess you mean that they would expect a 
larger percentage return from a starship investment to 
cover the fact that the ship might disappear before it has 
paid for itself?

I\'m told that often large insurance companies will take out 
sub-insurance policies with other insurance companies for 
Very Large policys.Thus the risk is spread, so if they lose 
a super-tanker they don\'t go bust, they just get a little 
damaged, but so do all the other insurance companies 
they\'ve spread the risk to. (But then if it doesn\'t lose a 
super-tanker, they\'ve just spread the earnings around).

    This briefly popped up on the TravLang list a while back.  Thing here is
that I think you\'re thinking in terms of current day field archeology where you
spend a LOT of time in the dirt with tiny brushes and tweezers to dig through
hills.  Now this is going to happen in the Traveller universe but you\'re also
going too have a lot of high tech "ruins" and the like.  Not to mention
computer data records dating back ten thousand of years or more in the case of
the Vilani.  Imperial space has been fought over, jumped through, colonized and
generally been littered with stuff all tucked away in various places.
    FoEx, you could build an entire campaign around a bunch of scholars rooting
through the local sector AAB who run across a report of a TL12 merchant
carrying something of value that misjumped some thousands of years ago.  More
research and they find out the merchant was never found in all that time.
Putting together the pieces they rule out certain systems in the misjump range
and narrow it down to say five systems.  Hiring a ship they visit each of the
systems in turn and then discover the merchant in the asteroid belt of an out
of the way starport D, pop 5, TL 4 system.  Now they\'ve got to recover the
merchant and get it to the nearest "safe" port, where they become Instant
Celebrities and the local authorities are going to try and sieze every last
credit of value off of their find! ;)
    AnEx, the scholar in the group is browsing through the local university

    I\'d agree, however having the Ancients introducing yeast to the Vilani
environment really doesn\'t make much sense.  My thought was some local
equivalent that, while mildly poisonous if still active when ingested, I\'m
making the assumption that full brewing creates enough alcohol to kill off the
native vilani equivalent off.  The stuff floats to the top and can be skimmed
off leaving a potable, if alcoholic, drink. ;)

    Oh yeah, but again the problem is that it doesn\'t make sense for the
Ancients to have brought in anything so specific as Terran Yeast.  And if you
assume my Vilani equivalent then it makes the bread poisonous.  Though I assume
that the Shugilii discover/figure out baking soda fairly early on BTW.

    Good point, though with all the biochemistry the Shugilii are going to have
to figure out over time it\'s going to be easier for them than it was in Earth
history.  There\'s a couple of options here to make it fit canon after all.

    Nope e. coli would have been carried in the guts of the humans brought to
Viland and would have been dropped into the local water supplies with the first
shit they took. ;) I kid you not!  But to the best of my knowledge e. coli
isn\'t a fermenting bacteria.

    I\'ll take your word for it because I\'ve NEVER had to worry about how to
distill anything. ;)

    Thinking on this, with a strange and hostile environment to receive and
mutate the e. coli on Vland, those early humans must have had some truly AWFUL
plagues of this stuff.  It\'s probably settled down with 200,000+ years to adapt
before recorded history started.

    I vaguely remember reading about some experiments with artificial enzime
based fermentation.  Thus with yeast it would fairly much be a waste of time,
for the Vilani however... ;)

    That was my assumption pretty much as I stated above.  Alcohol is just too
useful for humans not to get around to inventing it if the opportunity presents
it\'s self.

Radiation is really the only option, though. Waste heat radiated per m2
of radiator = (6e-8 watts/m2)*T^4 for T in Kelvin; about 50 kilowatts per
m2 for 1000 K. The radiator numbers in FFS2 assume (at TL12) 90% efficiency
(not ludicrously implausible for using something sophisticated like MHD rather
than turbines; note that thermodynamically, efficiency goes way way up as
the temperature of the hot end of a heat engine increases, and a fusion 
reactor\'s hot end is tens of millions of kelvin) and a radiator 
temperature of 2000 K, which is not ludicrous for TL-12 material technology.
Overall they\'re somewhat generous assumptions, but that\'s necessiated by the
fact that Traveller power production and consumption tends to be unrealistically
high; radiator requirements have to be tweaked to make giant battleships
possible, but they\'re not tweaked completely out of shape.

This won\'t work for very long, both because the heat capacity of hydrogen
is low and for more subtle thermodynamic reasons (you don\'t want your heat
sink to be running at too high a temperature.) It also begs the question
of what a ship does when it wants to run its power plant but not its
HEPlaR. Radiators are much more practical (and pretty much a necessity.)
(After all, that\'s how the space shuttle keeps cool - big radiators in the
cargo bay. If they can\'t get the bay doors open they have to return almost
immediately to Earth. The energies and temperatures involved are much lower,
but that\'s TL-7 for you...)

Steve, I understand where you are coming from, but I don\'t quite agree.
Inside a stable Imperium a stable currency is *very* likely to exist. In
fact, inside any stable economy there is likely to be a currency of
exchange, not the same currency or with the same exchange rate, of course.

>What standard is there to base currency on?  Lanthanum?  

No more than the US or European economies are based on gold.  The Imperial
Credit would be based on the "strength and stability of the Imperium", and
ultimately on the *faith* of the imperial citizen that the credit has
value.  Why does the Canadian or US dollar have "value"? It\'s not because
of the gold in our vaults..it\'s *mostly* because the Canadian and US\'s
econonies are strong and robust, and maybe because of some political
reasons, but let\'s not get into *that* argument.  ;-> The point is US
citizens have faith that our currency will be accepted in exchange for
items of value..and so do Canadians.  A Canadian dollar won\'t buy much in
Kansas...but it isn\'t valueless there either, because we US citizens also
have faith that Canada will exchange that Cn$ for a US$.  You\'ll just have
to go through a bank to exchange it.

>And what good is a currency like an Imperial Credit outside the
>Imperium?  

Near the Imperial border the ImpCr is likely to be nearly as valuable as
within the Imperium because the ImpCr can be exchanged for items of value
and make its way back into the Imperium.  Aren\'t US dollars valuable in
Canada and Mexico...particularly near the border?  As you move away from
the Imperium\'s border and/or into strong rival empires the value of the
ImpCr is either going to be devalued significantly and, maybe, exchanged at
some fixed rate set by local authorities.  US dollars still have value in
France.  Sweden or Japan, but must generally be traded for local currency
before they can be exchanged for items of value...they *still* have value
just aren\'t as readily exchangeable, usually.

>All this makes the viability of markets and currencies very
>questionable. 

No, no!  It makes markets and currencies an *interesting* topic.  It also
makes for some nice adventure hooks. ;->

IMTU, there is no huge Imperium, read US, (Anders don\'t have an attack, but
the Imperium\'s economic influence would be similar to the US\'s effect here
on earth) to dominate markets and currencies.  Currencies of the various
powers (ie Zeristu Empire, Confederation of Argent Systems, Montrose
Collective, Muan Gwi) are exchangeable at rates fixed either by government
or private banking sources.  As you travel away from the borders of the
issuing authority its currency\'s value diminishes. Travellers often carry
their wealth in tangible forms (gems are common), as bank drafts or as
"Banking Letters of Credit."

Commercial Banks make private arrangements with their counterparts in other
systems forming "banking partnerships" to allow holders of "letters of
credit" to automatically open accounts with local credit available in the
amount of the letter.  The letters are then returned to the issuing bank
where accounts between the banks are balanced and currencies and other
items of value are exchanged to maintain agreed balances.  They also issue
"authorized bank drafts" that *guarantee* that one currency will be
exchangeable for local currency at any of their banking partners.  There,
of course, are fees involved in doing this, and risks of forgery,
counterfeiting and fraud, but it\'s a system that keeps the gears of
commerce greased.  It also gives some some nice adventure hooks.  ;->

Example:  Sir Jason is travelling to Muan Gwi from Argent.  He converts
20,000 Cr into gems, puts 20,000 into an authorized bank draft drawn on the
Bank of Argent, puts another 60,000 into a Letter of Credit from the Bank
of Argent to the Bank of Muan Gwi, and puts 5,000 cr into his pocket.  It
costs him 600 Cr to "insure" the letter of credit, and 300 Cr to acquire
the bank draft.  In route from Argent to Muan Gwi, Sir Jason can buy
essentials with his "pocket credits" while inside the CSA, but once he
leaves it he will have to exchange them for local currency, cash his bank
draft with a banking partner of the Bank of Argent, or sell some gems. 
When he arrives on Muan Gwi he can present his Letter of Credit to the Bank
of Muan Gwi where a 59,400 Muan Gwi credit account will be opened for
him..yes the local back will charge him a fee for the conversion and cost
of returning the letter to Argent.  If Sir Jason later decides to travel to
the Montrose Collective, he may want to buy a Letter of Credit with his
Muan Gwi credits drawable on the Central Bank of Montrose and/or get a bank
draft written on the Bank of Muan Gwi...and so on.

There are all kinds of "hooks" built into Letters of Credit, bank drafts,
and other financial instruments for that matter:  just how "negotiable"
these letter of credit and bank drafts are depends on how they are written
(can they be stolen and presented for payment by the theives..or not); how
easy are they to counterfeit; how are forgery\'s "prevented" (ha! ha!); how
do the exchanged letters get back the issuing banks (armed couriers?); how
does exchanged currency get back to the bank that issued the bank drafts
(armed guards?); dealing with currency brokers, government agents, and
bankers wanting a bribe to "expedite" a conversion and/or give a good rate
on a transaction; and who knows what else.

Personally, this is a topic well worth "getting into!"

By using mild black powder loads and wire-wrapping the barrel you should be
able to get a weapon that is no less safe than the big medieval arbalests
which had metal prods that were wrapped in leather and parchment to contain
the fragments _when_ they shattered. However IIRC Roman wire drawing
technology was not very advanced. It wasn\'t until the late middle ages that
waterwheel powered wire drawing was invented. Before that wire was mostly
hammered out.

The gas could be, because you\'d just use a weaker recoil spring. Fouling of
the gas cylinder and ports would be a real problem with black powder,
though. However a black powder charged straight blow-back SMG (like a sten
gun, or a PPsH-41) would work fine, and be really easy to make, especially
as rifling is an optional extra at typical SMG ranges.

AFAIK bluderbusses and pistols are about it, because after that the barrel
needs to be too thick to be practical.

This disscussion reminds me of something I could use some help with. IMTU
the prices of different goods on Hi pop worlds and the Imperium at large
are like those of the USA and other countries that produce (or can produce)
most of the products they consume, and lower pop worlds, backwaters, etc
are like here (New Zealand) in that anything imported and often anything in
demand overseas is fairly expensive compared to local non-export products.

However to illustrate this I need some concrete examples, so I can give
real world comparisons for my players.

Some example prices from NZ (in $NZ, $NZ 1.00 is about $US 0.55, thanks to
the Asian economy\'s karma rebounding):

1 Litre of milk                 $2.60 - $2.80
1 loaf of bread (600g - 700g)   $1.50 - $2.40
500g of mincemeat               $2.50 - $4.00
500g of beef fillet steak       $10.00

An average house in Palmerston North (a \'university town\', pop. 70,000),
probably with 3 bedrooms, kitchen/dining room & lounge.     $120,000

The same in Auckland (our largest city, pop. 1,000,000+)    $300,000

The rent on the average house in Palmerston North           $180 - $200 per
week

A bolt-action .308 rifle, new   $1,200

 Academy\'s are free. In fact, at the US Naval Academy, you get paid to go there.
Back in 87 it was about $6,000/year.

I\'ve always figured that all traveller education is free.  Essentially, you forego
the opportunity to make any money and that balances it out.

Any stable governement would probably have a stable economy (else it

governments and non-imperium systems that economy parallels break down.

It seems to me that many if not most transaction are going to ultimately

be barter.  And there would probably be little probability of the same

I think average US income is actually somewhat lower,
around $28,000/year or so.  The poverty line is somewhere around
$20,000 for a family of 4.

Just FYI:
Tuition/year at private second-tier professional school: $20,000.

Interesting concept!  If the Imperium bears the risk on starship loans,
then the Imperium\'s *enforcement* agencies will take the lead in seeing
that those loans are paid off. Loan jumpers, beware! it\'s agents of ImpeMAE
and its enforcers, the Imperial Navy on your case not just the Bank of
Regina!

Investors in England build the Empire on instruments with 1% real returns.

Yes, I agree with you. Just, please, don\'t forget some of us don\'t play our

available.

Humm, I don\'t really see an interstellar currency based on any sort of
specie. Isn\'t that the right term? What could be *that* rare? ;->  "Full
trust and credit", that\'s the trick.

I discount old ships a good bit more than 1% per year, but you are right
about normal downpayments being beyond the means of most adventuring
groups. If you want to get the dmpymts down to reasonable levels then the
cost of ships (new or used) is going to have to be a lot lower...and that
affects other parts of the game.

...if you *stay* inside the Imperium (or registering empire), yes it\'s hard
to make a ship disappear, but if you get the ship outside local authorities
might not be all that interested in where the ship came from...originally.

Hey, good topic!  I\'ve got an archaeologist character in my PBEM that just
about totally ignores any plot line that doesn\'t lead directly to a dig,
museum, or tour. So far his general reaction to everything else is "What\'s
to eat?"  Isn\'t that right James? ;->

Well, for one thing *don\'t* wing the location or contents of any sites your
PC\'s might discover. You need to plan out the sites, what they contain and
how all the pieces fit together. Do it in detail before the PC\'s get
anywhere near that part of the adventure. Plan out how the business of
archaeology works IYTU: if finders own what they find and if they can sell
artifacts/sites/data, and if they can who they can sell it to; are licences
required, from who, for what; what the restrictions local governments can
have and where do local authority and Imperial authority cross lines; and,
perhaps most of all, what kind of money are we talking about...ranges from
small amounts to break the bank fortunes...for finds. 

I put my party in a position to discover what could have been a major find
recently, but they were on a planet where the government owned all sites
"for the common benefit of the citizens" and the best they could hope for
was a minor finder\'s fee. OTOH, if a major Exploration Company had made the
find, they could have maneuved the government into giving them the contract
for the dig..big bucks. So, my smart archaeologist sold the site\'s location
to an Exploration Company for money down and a share of any eventual
contract between the company and the government. On the next planet where
they go exploring the rules *will* be different, and they *better* find out
what the rules are before they go exploring or they will be in big trouble.
;->

You know, I didn\'t really "wing" much of that encounter except for the
personal interactions between PC\'s and NPC\'s, but I didn\'t roll much
either.

>Also an understanding of archeology in the far future and what it might entail if
>the artifacts players uncover are more advanced (and possibly forbidden)
>than their current society\'s.

Ah, yes! I\'m not real likely to present my players with *that* kind of
site, but if I did it would be a *major* plot point, the culmination of the
adventure and, perhaps, the beginning of the next phase. What I\'m more
likely to do is present them with a series of sites where clues from one
lead to another and another, all moving toward some major discovery. Along
the way I\'d be sure to plug in dead-ends, false trails, misleading clues,
and if they do make it to the "grail" the discovery isn\'t likely to be
universe shattering technology, but more likely a piece of data that
refutes or confirms some archaeological/historical theory, or a piece of
technology that is broken, of unknown origin, unknown function, and unknown
value and discovering just what they found will occupy the next phase of
the adventure. Or if somebody else discovers they found it, hanging on to
it until they find out what it does, or they can unload it. ;->

Miltary academies in the States are funded under the Department of Defense, so 
the *taxpayers* pay for it.

I\'ve always assumed that since PC\'s are reputed to be the cream of the crop, 
their admission rolls meant that they won scholarships of some sort or other.  
Student loans picked up the rest of the slack, and the skills picked up in 4 
years at college were picked up at summer jobs & such.  Also, I assumed they 
paid off their student loans during their active careers.

Yikes!  That\'s too many sites for Ancients.  I wouldn\'t roll for that
anyway, Ancients sites are definite *placement* material.

I set my game several thousand years beyond TNE.  So far beyond that the
Imperium, Virus", the "Empress Wave" the "Dark Curtain", the Imperium and
even Terra are the stuff of shadowy myth and legend that might/might not
have any basis in what really happened those thousands of years ago. The
sites the PC\'s find are going to be from the "Old Imperium"...as far as
they know, but they could be from a failed successor state, a predecessor
state, the real Ancients, or something else.  Figuring out what\'s what and
when it all fits together is the real goal of archaeology, not grave
robbing goodies.

Yep, what we\'re talking about comes closer to "grave robbing" than real
archaeology.

One last idea, don\'t overlook the exploration of museums and religious
sites.  There\'s no telling what might be sitting there that was mis-labeled
or mis-understood.

Once upon a time some clerk was browsing through the back of the British
Museum when he came across a stone box that had been dug up from just
outside the ruins of the Library of Alexandria.  This box had been sitting
in the Museum for 50 years with no idea as to it\'s original
function...until that day when the clerk noticed the resemblance between
the stone box and the metal one he had used a couple hours earlier when he
bought the latest Kipling "penny-dredfull" at the train station.  The stone
box was an example of the first known vending machine, vending candles for
use inside the Library.  <----Ok, is this true or just an "urban-myth?"  I
don\'t know, but it is sure one heck of a story.  ;->

18.9 N/M^2 = 18.9 Pascal which is about .00274 psi which is very low.
A plate 20 feet by 100 feet will experience a total force of 789 lbs.
If this plate is 1/2" thick steel it will weigh 40,500 lbs for a net
acceleration of .02 g.  Most ships could handle this...  A ship will
probably be quite a bit heavier because it\'s 3-D not a sheet.  Someone
check my numbers, but the order of magnitude looks right.  The torque
on this sheet if the force is concentrated at one end is still not
going to be that bad.  I\'d fly this sheet if it had reasonable
thrusters on it...

I\'ve driven a full-sized full-length van (the kind that seats 15) at
80 mph in high cross-winds (say 30 mph) which were gusting and quite
unpredictable.  I had no problem staying on the ground and in my lane,
though I did have to correct for the gusts.

Also, keep in mind my assumptions:

1.  The ship has a generous thrust to weight ratio (significantly over
1 G).  If it doesn\'t, then you could have problems.

2.  The ship has maneuvering thrusters capable of nontrivial thrust
(ie that can roll the ship and rotate it around various axii) and
which are in balanced pairs.

3.  The ship is not an open frame, dispersed structure but is some
relatively compact shape like a sphere or a rectuangular solid or
a tight cluster of these.  This means more like a space shuttle or
free trader type body as opposed to a bunch of pods connected by
struts with things sticking out all over the place.

These ships should be able to maneuver as well as a big truck or
an unstreamlined helicopter or a dirigible.  Dirigibles have navigated
the skies quite safely for some time even though they are quite
flimsy and slow to move and maneuver.  They are somewhat aerodynamic,
but not strong enough to survive very high winds.

Also, there is some question about the use of the term "streamlined."
Aircraft are not just streamlined (able to cut through the air
efficiently) but are designed to generate lift.  Supersonic and
subsonic streamlining are quite different so a vehicle optimized
for one is not so good for the other.  A brick, on the other hand,
can generate lift... it will just generate so much drag as to
be unflyable and will not be easy to control at the speeds it would
have to go to generate lift.  At low speeds it will be easy to
control but generate no lift...

  Attribute whatever failings you might wish to a Soviet foundry, but their
output is going to be vastly superior in quality and _reliably so_ compared
to any pre-Renaissance metalworker. So a TL 4 artisan might be able to do
so, or maybe not. What the Romans had to work with would have been useless
for series production.

  IIRC, iron cannon for shipboard use in the age of sail were substantially
_heavier_, but cheaper. So it presumably isn\'t weight.

Well, no.  In addition to the assumption above, you have to assume
that the  inspections are so detailed as to make hiding the
crew more risky than someone willing to engage in such a
crime is willing to accept.  You also have to assume that
you can\'t simply threat over the head of the crew and get
them too cooperate.

I\'m not sure how this is done.  The hijacking would presumably
be done in jump space.  And if you are talking about message
sent to say "we are comming"  The way messages are carried
is by ship.

> a) Query - if such a jump fuel regime were adopted, would insurance

Stopping ship and searching it every time it arrives at every system
requires inspectors, ships to protect them, and delays for all
shipping.  If the cost of these exceeds the rate highjackings
then a rival company will simply offer insurance that, while
it is more expensive, in the long run saves money by not requiring
the inspections.

> b) Query - can a ship that can\'t provide proof of insurance coverage
>actually get freight and passenger contracts?

Why, if the captain doesn\'t think the likelyhood of his ship being
lost isn\'t worth the insurance there is no reason for a shipper
to require it.  If they feel their cargo need insurance, they can
insure it themselves.

Not top-10, but right up there.  Highly selective but not the most selective.
Harvard, Yale, etc. are the top tier.

Nothing to do with age other than it is post-graduate education, so entering
age
tends to be around 22-24.  A four-year Bachelor\'s Degree is required for
such professional schools (law, business, medicine, etc).

Yes, thanks. I think I\'ll have to immigrate - your utility & Petroleum

good stuff.

And I didn\'t write \'1D\'. I wrote \'1DD\' --  one die of dice.

Anyway, getting back to the subject, I admit that I can\'t prove that Cr4000
per month is excessive for life support, because I can\'t come up with any
cost examples, either Traveller or real-world, for the things (over and
about the food costs) that is absolutely essential. The food part can\'t
amount to much when you consider that Good Food costs Cr400/month. It\'s
true that that is for food bought over the counter and that prices may
be slightly higher because you have to buy food that can stay palatable
for weeks, but considering that this is easily and cheaply achivable by
TL7/8 level food preparation techniques, I just can\'t see it costing much
more than Cr30-40/day. But that leaves the CO2 removal and all the other
costs which is not defined and may possible amount to Cr100+ per day.

BUT, the cost of life support for space- and starships is demonstrably
broken in at least two aspects, to wit, the fact that passengers only
burdens the LS system for about 8 days per trip and should thus only cost
Cr1,200 and the fact that the cost is the same for High and Middle 
passengers despite Middle Passage food being described as inferior to
High Passage food. So there\'s a need for a fix anyway. And while we are
at it, we may as well think about whether we WANT life support to cost
Cr4000/month. That\'s a lot of money. I, for one regret that a starship
ticket costs the better part of a year\'s pay for the average citizen.
Logically this implies a very limited amount of tourist travel, which
is something I dislike. Also, it dosen\'t seem to jibe with the impression
I get of how most Traveller writers think of interstellar traffic. (And,
yes, I know that that is highly subjective and just an opinion. But when
you think of Mora Starport, do you think of the travellers there as 99%
official and commercial?)

Oh, and another question: How plausible do you find it that the life
support cost for someone travelling Mid Passage by tram freighter and
someone travelling High Passage by sceduled megacorporate passenger
liner is exactly the same?

    'body' => 'Several people have suggested that the value of the Imperial credit is
actually defined by the requirement that a ship must transport on DT
of freight for CrImp1,000. Leaving aside the little trick someone else
supplied for circumventing this requirement by the legal fiction of
turning freight into speculative cargo, I\'d like to know how you people
get around the fact that this definition results in about a dozen
different values for the Imperial credit? You get one value for each
TL from 9 to 15 for jump-1 ships, one value for each TL from 11 to 15
for jump-2 ships, etc. Even if you postulate that all jump-1 ships are
built at TL 9, all jump-2 ships at Tl 11, etc. you still get at least
six different values.

My own opinion is that the definition provided by _Pocket Empires_ is
quite useful: The average earnings of a citizen of any planet is defined
as Cr10,000; the Imperial credit is equal to the local credit on the
strongest (economically)  planets in the Imperium. To find the exchange
value of two currencies you compare the RU output of each planet (Mind
you, I\'d like the way RU production is calculated changed slightly, but
that\'s a different subject).

This idea originally came from the writings of Jack Vance who in most of
his books have currencies expressed as the hourly wage of an unskilled
laborer "under certain standard conditions".

Frankly, I think it is much better to cut to the root of the problem and
make the freight and passenger rates realistic. All you need is a table
with less than a dozen lines showing the typical prices for the various
jump lengths and the various travel classes (High, Mid, Low, and I\'d like
to suggest three more: Economy, Steerage, and Fast). And I\'ve even come up
with a way to keep the High, Middle, and Low Passages ALMOST as they were:

- ----
High, Mid, and Low Passages are not tickets. They are travel vouchers issued
by various Imperial institutions and a number of licenced private institutions
(mostly megacorporations). By Imperial law any High Passage voucher must be
accepted by any ship licenced to carry passengers as full payment for a High 
Passage ticket, regardless of the length of the jump. Likewise the Mid and
Low Passage must be accepted as payment for Mid and Low Passage tickets. The 
ship captain can then exchange the voucher for the price of the ticket at any 
Class A or B starport. For starships with a flexible attitude to ticket 
prices (ie. tramp ships) the law imposes a maximum reimbursement of 
Crimp10,000 for a High Passage, Crimp8,000 for a Mid Passage, and Crimp2000 
for a Low Passage, unless they can document expenses that warrants a higher
price.

Often a passenger who is about to use a ticket to take a jump-1 or jump-2
trip will try to sell his High or Mid Passage to someone who plans to take a
jump-3 trip. Such trades are technically illegal, but the Imperium usually
ignore it. The going rate is around Crimp9,000 for a High Passage and 
Crimp7,200 for a Mid Passage.

There\'s an old Q&A that states that a 40 year old starship is worth 25% of
original cost, so the "discount" is actually 75%. The TNE rules formalized
that to the original cost divided by the "wear value", which, since IIRC
the wear value of a staship was usually the number of decades it was old,
fits well enough and also implies that you can get a 100 year old
starship for 10% of new price. The problem with this in a non-TNE campaign
is of course that there are no rules that makes a ship more likely to break
down the older it is. Under the CT rules it is madness for anyone to sell a
40 year old ship, because now that it is finally paid off it, is is really
going to earn money. After all, the payments constitute a good half of the
operating expenses. The implications are clear: A 40 year old, paid-up ship
is NOT as good as investment as a new ship. A referee that allows his
players to buy a ship cheap because it is old should IMO take care to
impose the occasional astronomical repair bill.

Sure. Jump-1 ships. It gets even easier when you (as I do) postulate that
regular freighters and passenger liners can easily make a jump every 10
days (Actually, that should propably be every 8 days on the average for
freighters (6 day jumps balancing out the 8 day jumps) and every 9 days
for passenger liners). But try making a jump-3 freighter or a jump-4
long-liner that can break even with Cr1000/T or Cr8,000/passenger. It
just can\'t be done. Yet Jump-3 and jump-4 liners are canonical. Problem?
It certainly is a problem to me.

Plausible that you get a score of different values for the Crimp depending
on just which ship you use?

True for the maneuver drive, but you can\'t lose the power plant. A ship
needs a power plant factor of at least half the jump number in order to
jump. So a jump-2 ship needs at least a power plant factor of 1. (BTW.
the freight and passenger rates I posted a few months ago are slightly
wrong for jump-3 and above due to me forgetting just that little factor;
I\'ll repost the whole thing in a few weeks or months when I\'ve had time
to redisign all my ships).

The result I got to was that refined fuel wouldn\'t cost more than Cr300
because that was the point where it became more profitable for freighters
to carry an onboard fuel purifier plant and buy unrefined fuel.

Your figures are skewed because I\'m already including most of that in my
profit calculations. I was giving examples of how _individuals_ owning
ships could make a profit. A large factor is the mortgage involved.
Megacorporations owning ships require rather different calculations. They
aren\'t paying a mortgage, they are gaining a return on their investment.
The third column on my spreadsheet gives breakeven figures for running
without paying a mortgage, those are much, much, more favourable. I just
didn\'t quote them because they weren\'t relevant to a discussion on
individual trading ships.

I\'d be more than happy to post some long-haul designs with full statistics.
First, though, I have a hypothesis that I wish to prove. Basically, that
jump-1 ships are the most viable ships for facilitiating trading along a
main. I intend to do this by creating a suply and demand model of a main
and creating a computer simulation of it. Then, applying a number of
scenarios of ships and letting the computer work out optimal usage and
comparing the results. When I\'m done I\'ll probably post the pieces as an
applet on the web so other people can run their own scenarios.

>I mean, even if a jump 1 is fixed at 1000 Cr/ton, why is a
>jump 2 exactly the same price?
My hypothesis is that less than 1% of trade is at anything higher than
jump-1 because you can\'t service your demands any better by using higher
jump capactity ships. But I\'m not going to argue it till I can present some
data.

Inflation is what you get if the supply of money grows faster that the
real wealth of the society. One risk of paper money is that the issuing
authority is able to increase the supply of money at will. However, if
properly controlled, paper money is actually better than a metal standard,
because you CAN\'T control a metal standard very easily. An increase in
wealth that is not accompanied by new finds of the metal in question
will cause deflation, while a large strike will cause inflation as
surely as the most irresponsible of governments (OK, so the risk of
a significant strike will hardly be an issue in a 10,000 world economy).

A noble aspiration. I\'ve recently started running what might be described
as an Archaeological based D&D Campaign. (Scads of player info on
http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~jaymin/EnumaElish if you are _really_ bored, but
none of the good archaeological bits.) What a pity the two trained
archaeologists I invited to play have been unable to make it! (Pete & co
will just have to suffer through themselves :-)

As a campaign plot-device, I might suggest you use a hook from the 101
books I did. There is a firm of archaeological consultants called "Mayes,
Fitzpatrick and Pierce" presented there. The logic presented is that
Imperial Law requires a full archaeological report if any construction on
any planet turns up any artifcats dating from before the known colonisation
date of that planet. (Aftifacts after that date may also require
archeological reports, but that is up to local law.) This is often a
headache for local builders on worlds with particularly rich history. The
normal thing is to call in Imperial Approved Archeological Consultants who
are normally given far less time than they would like to assess a site and
make a reccomendation. These teams are often subject to pressure and
politics between local archaeologists, the local building industry, the
governmental board of tourism, and whoever the customer is that is having
their construction project delayed by their investigation.
[Much of this is based on laws and observed processes around digging up
bits of Dublin.]
  So, one campaign would be for your characters to be roving archaeologists
working for MF&P (or a rival firm). As a DM, you can set up a place and
scenario, have them win the contract, play out the adventure, and then move
them on to the next place when you are ready. It allows you to give your
campaign overall structure without imposing on player freedom.

>I must admit I\'m at a loss as to how to go
>about this without creating a logistical nightmare for the players.
  Well, unless you have any trained archeologists playing (sigh), you can
do much through simulation and puzzles. For example, one of the major plot
devices in my D&D campaign is a text written in a long dead language. Now
what I physically did was create the text, then print it out in an obscure
font. In short, what I have physically handed them is a simple substitution
cypher. I\'ve made this clear and indicated that, in the reality of the
game, it is much more complex, with foriegn grammer, etc, etc. They are
welcome, as players, to attempt to crack the substitution cipher and if
they do so, I will assume their characters have worked it out. But if they
choose not to, their players will be pursuing clues as to word elements or
rosetta stones that will help them translate.
  So, in your situation, you might do something similar. Present them with
a text/inscription from the site containing clues as to the date or origin
of it, rendered in an unusual font. Allow them rolls against their
archeology and for successes and/or exceptional successes give them
characters they have worked out. They can then either try to work out the
rest from context or else consult with other archeological firms ("I\'d like
to buy a vowel...").
  You can vary the difficulty by choosing a font that just maps single case
A-Z, or one that maps both cases differently, or one that maps the
punctuation to glyphs indistinguishable from letters. Or you can
pre-process the text by removing all vowels, changing all vowels to a
single vowel, removing all spaces, all punctuation, or converting it to
vertical writing. For an added twist you might use Alta-Vista\'s machine
translation engine to translate your text to, say, german. That way they
have to transliterate into a language they might not understand, _then_ run
it through their translator (give them access to Alta-Vista as an analogue
to their linguistic software).

>Also an understanding of archeology in

In the long-term Traveller I ran I had several pre-existing empires. Over
time they got to know about some through finding bits and pieces of their
artifacts in various junk markets. They never had any names for them or
even a clue about dates.
One empire was based on "Star Wars" tech. There was the odd light-sabre
kicking around. But most of the sub-components were either mundane or
unusable (how much use is a COM port card for a PC-XT to an Eniac?).
Another was based on Klingon "Star Trek" (the old series) tech. They
actually found a fully working D-7 Klingon ship. Unfortunately everything
on it from the engines to the disruptors required anti-matter to run which
was in rather a short supply. The tech was just _too_ different to be of
more than academic interest.

Anyway, I think that is enough ideas to get you started...

  OK. Upon reflection hiding the crew against a not very thorough
search shouldn\'t be too challenging. I fail to see how you might
threaten the crew, as once such an inspection is passed liquidating
them becomes a option again; if you could then anything can now be
justified, as the crew effectively act as accomplices in the
hijacking, willing or no.

  Covered previously (this is a summation); if anyone on board or
acting for them (or for the cargo), intentionally or not, sends a
message ahead of the ship (even by a couple of days) then any such
inspection will have a very obvious and simple thing to check.

  In fact, wouldn\'t an insurer (or the Captain, or the local officer
of the ships finance company) routinely send a message ahead while
the ship acquires cargo and passengers to its announced destination?
If so, failure to stop and unload the requisite passengers and cargo
(or simply failure by the Captain to debark and check in) would be
such an obvious red flag that successful hijacking of a ship so
protected would be ridiculously difficult.

  Well, this is in the context of a drop-tank/jump station fuel model,
so ships to protect inspectors aren\'t relevant (and trivial to begin
with), as ships are inspected as they approach such a station.

  The possibility is overlooked that such inspections might be demanded
successfully by the shipping community from the government, and thus 
added to everyones tax bill (but under-represented on their own). Thus,
inspection costs would not directly affect any insurer.

  Great, but what if I as the consignor try to put a cargo on a ship
that my insurance company considers unqualified? More to the point, I
assign the cargo to a local shipping broker - who is legally responsible
for my insured cargo - and he then makes sure that the cargo is carried
on a ship such that his insurer will cover him if something goes wrong.
Thus, any ship not so qualified won\'t get business from reputable sources.

  An uninsured ship can revert to the bank simply by breaking down,
mis-jumping, or suffering a fire, if cargo damage or non-performance
clauses are incurred against them while operating without insurance.
It seems very likely that any freight-hauler operating without coverage
would find it very difficult to get a freight cargo at all, probably
business passengers too, and that such status would be a good indicator
of an impending business failure.

  Would TNE discussions of these mechanics be useful?

As someone said, the U.S. is a Big place.  In New England (Northeastern
U.S.) $6.99 is the price for Guiness Stout, or a Good local Microbrew
(which are quite trendy these days).  Good old Budweiser (which I wouldn\'t
touch with a 10 foot pole) is much less.  Rolling Rock (which is a good
version of Bud) comes out at $4.50 per sixpack of bottles.

On the other hand, *all* the other prices on Eris\' list are lowballed for
Boston and vicinity.  Especially housing, which is low by a factor of two.

  Well, they expect to be able to survive any reasonable number
of mishaps in a given time span. This presumes that their physical
capitalization is somewhat evenly distributed; if you own an oil
refinery, you insure it, but if you own 500 gas stations (or 7-11\'s,
etc.) you don\'t bother, as the insurance coverage will cost you
the expected loss, plus admin, plus the profit for the insurer.

  If your company owns 5000 Imperial-Express package boats (at say,
500 DT, J-4?), then why insure them? The cost of insuring _will_
exceed the long-run cost of paying for any losses yourself. FWIW,
with (HG) 20 EP & comp 4 I\'d give the thing Agility-1 and a couple
of two-turret lasers (f-5) plus an f-4 sandcaster, all TL 13.

>I\'m told that often large insurance companies will take out 
>sub-insurance policies with other insurance companies for 

  Yep. The portion of their capital tied up in one policy
can\'t be too big, if they\'re being prudent.

You need to clarify this question.  There are four sets of rules, five
counting the Gurps:Traveller supplement, and many supplements pertinent to
each, all or none.

If you have a rules question, check the TML FAQ to see if its a "done to
death" question, if not, post your question.  Just don\'t expect one answer.

They did a pretty good job of monkey-copying them in Cambodia, too, especially
up in the highlands.  AK\'s are pretty easy to copy, they were *designed* to be
rugged as hell.  Now take that design philosophy up a few tech levels.  Slick
the design down to the point where you can de-evolve the design back down to
lower tech levels again for export to backwater planets.  Makes the seed of a
nifty lil nugget, I think.

This presupposes that there is sufficient traffic to permit advance
notice to be sent. If that particular pair of systems is served by enough
traffic to permit this, then hijacking is less likely to be productive.
On the other hand, if it is not feasible (due to low traffic levels) to
send advance word, this assumption fails to hold.

Yes, the US is a big place...here in Tucson \'Rolling Rock\' is considered
a \'premium\' beer and commands prices like $7-9 /six pack, while
Budweiser is typically avalable for $3.70-$4.50 /six, cheaper in
quantity. 

Beer pricing is also a weird thing. There is a Mexican beer, Corona,
which, to be charitable, _is_ yellow and fizzy, has been successfully
marketed in the US, particularly on the East Coast, as a premium import,
which is on the order of selling Pabst Blue Ribbon or Keystone Light as
a premium.

There is an excellent book I\'d recommend to anyone who wants to see how
marketing-driven industries are like. It\'s called \'Beer blast : the
inside story of the brewing industry\'s bizarre battles for your money\'
by Philip Van Munching,. whose grandfather started importing Heineken
beer into the US.

While it isn\';t extraodinarily related to Traveller, other than it\'s
connection to most players favorite beverage ;-), it is a good source
for some great adventure hooks. 

The PC\'s, for instance, come upon this beverage that seems wildly
popular, called, oh, what the hell, letz call it Zima for inztanze ;->
They stock up on a large shipment of it, and negotiate an import
contract for a port further on the line.

They get to that further port, hustle around to set up buyers for this
wonderful new stuff, and find that the people here have taste buds and
think this Zima ztinkz, it tastes like slightly alcoholic bilgewater and
want no part of it.

Do the PC\'s a) break the contract, taking a bath on the cargo and
whatever sanctions the first place will impose on a party unilaterally
breaking a contract. b) declare a loss and skip out on the contract
(never to return to Port A) or c) hire a marketing firm to generate a
market for the stuff?

A ferinstance. So-called \'light\' beer was first invented in the early
60\'s and was marketed as a healthier drink than regular beer, complete
with a stern doctor-figure hawking it and a serious advertising
campaign. It tanked, horribly. In the early 70\'s Miller brewing took
essentially the same stuff, called it \'Lite\', hired a few ex-jocks to do
ads on TV, and got itself the fastest growing market segment for beer
since the repeal of Prohibition. 

Lots of potential for comedic, off-the-wall adventures, replete with
colorful characters, and little or no gunfire. Of course, to keep it
moving you\'ll have to make it pretty cinematic in feel, so it\'s not for
everyone\'s game, but as a one or two evening romp it\'ll make a diversion
from the usual fare.
 
Play a game or two of \'You don\'t know Jack TV\' to get into it. ;-)

They still used a lot of bronze, partly because of the lack of consistent
iron, but probably also from habit and tradition.

One of the reasons the Romans took Spain off the Carthaginians was for its
tin mines, and by the late empire they were so deep that even using
expendable slaves and constantly pumping (with slave powered pump) air in
they had to close some of them. Those mines are a good example of what you
can do with TL1.

I, for one will be pleased if you were to do this. When I play Traveller,
it\'s in the TNE setting, so I can cheerfully ignore any fixed Imperial
price structures, etc. I see this as a fine opportunity to redo the
economic system, and starship costs without destroying too much canon.
However I have no economics expertise at all, so I have to rely on other
people\'s postings.

	I\'m new to your list, but I\'m an old Traveller player. I 
started with the first box set of three books and I still have it. I
have bought anything and everything I could over the many years 
regardless of what Traveller background. I have greatly slowed down
now, but I still enjoy this game the most.
	Now my comment and question is where have all the Traveller
players gone? The resource stuff always gets bought from the gaming
stores, but no one ever seems to play. I am a GM looking for some
older player (30+ years) in my area to look into starting up a new
gaming group. I live in Lower Bucks county Pa, in Bensalem PA.
	I\'m hoping to form a group in the area of about four players
that would be willing to play every other week for about 4-5 hours.
Are their any of you mailer folks out there in my area?

Take care,

Corona was marketed here as a premium beer in the mid 90s, but it didn\'t
last and it doesn\'t move much these days because it\'s still massively
overpriced. 

BTW what percentage alcohol do US beers run to? Here they used to be about
4.5% with some at 5%, but in recent years they\'ve dropped to 4% almost
universally. There are some low alcohol and lite beers around, but they\'re
not hugely popular.

Here, believe it or not, it is illegal to put the alcohol percentage on
the label. IIRC, and I may not, beer runs 3.5 to 5% roughly, with malt
liquors running higher, some of those go up to about 10%. Brewers on the
list can probably answer more accurately.

Fortunately, the microbrew revolution in the US has meant that US
consumers are slowly regaining their taste buds, and are able to buy
beers with flavor and character...sometimes too much of it. (I once
grabbed a Samuel Adams beer I thought said Porter on the label. It
did...Maple Porter. It was flavored with maple syrup. <shudder> A bottle
now sits in the medicine cabinet where the syrup of ipecac once
sat...this stuff is worse. Gaaahhh, I can still taste that abomination.)

If this took place in my campaign, the story might continue as follows: 
Wife\'s insurance company picks up the cost of medical slow drug and
treatment by competent staff at a professional medical facility, then
sues the doctor for malpractice on behalf of wife to recover these
costs.  

Doctor and wife are off adventuring again by the time this gets rolling,
and when they get back, doctor finds out that insurance company has
taken a default against him and is attaching his portion of the spoils
of the current adventure.  Doctor now can\'t afford a lawyer to take on
insurance company to get his money back (even though Doctor is probably
in the right, as he didn\'t have notice that he was being sued), and will
have to come grovelling to wife and the other adventurers for either a
loan of enough money to hire a lawyer to get his money back, or for
enough money to survive on until the next payday.  This should make for
some interesting role-playing, and sweet revenge for wife. 

Also, the medical licensing authorities are considering whether to
revoke doctor\'s license.  This may not make much difference to the
doctor, who doesn\'t have a regular practice where he needs to reassure
patients who don\'t know him that he\'s really a doctor ... of course, if
the adventurers ditch him for incompetence, he may have to go hang out a
shingle, and will want to protect his license.

This would be worse -- for a developer -- than putting together an

they might be bribed or threatened by the developer or its competition

	Depends on the area and where you buy it. Utah nothing stronger than
3.2% is allowed; likewise in Colorado grocery stores may only sell
3.2 beer--real stuff is restricted to liquor stores (and not
available on Sunday). A friend of mine brewed a batch of 10+%
recently ...

You could wander by Holomann AFB and see the Revenge of the Germans.  The

Anchor Steam (whose brewery is about 1km from where I work) had a clever ad
campaign designed to get San Franciscans to drink their native brew.  The
ads feature a stern looking bartender with the copy "Flavored beer?  What,
you from L.A.?"

For those not local, San Francisco and Los Angeles cheerfully hate each
other, with rivalries in sports and everything else going back years.  Of,
course, what can you expect but jealousy from a bunch of Angelinos who call
a dry concrete culvert a river.  :)

ObTrav:  Players run into such a rivalry while trying to sell a cargo.

Cool. Start with a hypothesis, then design an experiment to test it.

I completely disagree with your hypothesis, but hey *grin* thats
intellectual debate.

The factors that could affect the services are

(1) when do cargos become available. Are they random (if it\'s a good year
the planet exports fungi beans) or are they predictable (Ford\'s assembley
line turns out 200 export grav cars each and every month).

(2) are interest costs on holding the cargo signifigant ? Imagine a good
that costs a megacredit to own, and costs Cr 20 000 to ship 20 jump-1s over
6 months. If interest rates are over 4%, the cost of owning that good for
the 6 months will exceed the cost of shipping it ...

(3) where do cargos have to go ... is it random world to random world, or
do Ag worlds tend to export to Ind worlds etc ?

(4) what are transhipment costs like ? Imagine a "hub" system where goods
are exported to a world with a fast service, and then re-shipped down the
line, and then go onto a all-stops to the destination. If reshipping is
costly, how costly should it be (I dunno. Cr 50 per dton shounds about
right to me). 

(5) whats the value of the cargos. Hi value cargos are more frequently
worth shipping long distances fast.

We\'ll see what your experiment crunches out.

On a similar note regarding Heinekin, I\'ve had it up here in the States and its
pretty good. But then I went down to Costa Rica and had some down there.  It was
bottled down there but I\'m not sure if it was brewed there.  All I know is that
it stunk up the place... aweful... But the local Costa Rican stuff was pretty
good.

So, I gotta wonder, do they intentionally skunk the imports to boost domestic
goods?

The state of Texas currently requires this.  I\'ve a friend who used to work
for one of the local equivalents.  It\'s one of the few ways that
archaeologists get to hang out a shingle and still feed themselves outside
of academia.

ObTraveller: If there is a planet inside the contiguous (whatever that
means in space) borders of the Imperium or on the immediate frontier, the
Megacorps might in fact wish to keep it from joining in order to avoid
pesky regulations (this could be modeled on the Puerto Rico/Pharmaceuticals
industry relationship).

Here only liquor stores can sell beer and hard liquor, but supermarkets etc

That was a mistake. A second hand .308 in good repair of a modern model
costs about NZ$900. An old SMLE would cost $100 - $200 depending on
condition, because there are heaps of them around, most very beaten up.

Not here. Local Heinekin is brewed here, and it taste OK. We also brew
Guiness locally, and it was voted the best Guiness outside of Ireland. The
only downside is that it\'s expensive.

Hee! Of *course* they are. I live in the cheap south, you live in the
expensive northeast.  I\'m sure if we compared average salaries we\'d
discover you folks earn a lot more up there.   The example I can give you
is for public school teachers, about $35,000 a year for teachers with
Masters degrees and 20 years experience. Starting salaries are around 20k.

The same way you make people cooperate in sending the police

I guess I missed that.  The fact is that there won\'t always
be a ship leaving to right destination and you won\'t always
be in position where you know your destination days before
you leave.  You would have add the willingness to put up
with that to your list of assumptions.

How does the inspector get onboard before you reach the station?
And even if he did, how do you get the ship to surrender?  What
is to keep them from just demanding the fuel to flee with?

Only if the costs were within what was justified by the percieved
threat of highjackings.  What is going to happen is what happens
in all sorts of crime, measure are going to be instituted to reduce
it to a managable level, and then you can find the money for
further measures.  I see the problems of reselling the shipa
and getting by the ship\'s crew as already getting down to that
level.

Being insured doesn\'t make you more qualified and the measures that
can be instituted to make sure you are qualified can be used without
forcing you to take insurance you don\'t need.

Besides you don\'t base your trust on people carring insurance for
unlikely events.  You don\'t require bonded couriers to carry
life insurance to prove they won\'t die before they get to
their destination.

More generally, I think the proposals in various threads for
inspections of every ship, patrols everywhere, extensive
(and cross checked) records and permits, extensive commercial
airline safety regulations, untamperable transponders, extensive
flight control regulations to make sure ships can be watched, etc.
all fits better with our current regulated society with easy
communication than it does with what I see as a decentralised,
laisse faire, poor communications Imperium.  I just don\'t
see these kind of measure being in place to _totally_ eliminate
any crime (which is probably impossible if you realize that
history shows us that measures that are expected to totally
eliminate any crime almost always fail to do so).

A New Zealand High School (13-15 year olds) teacher, starting with a 1 year
Teaching Diploma and a Batchelor\'s Degree with Honours gets about
NZ$28,000. This is about 85% of the average wage, which from the prices
that have been posted seems to be a fairly useful comparison.

And let\'s not even discuss that Cranberry Lambic stuff.  They finally
dumped a lot of it by marketing a "Winter Gift Pack" with eight bottles of
four different types of Sam Adams, including the Cranberry, then marking it
down to less then a six-pack.

Funny thing is, a friend convinced me to try it on tap (at the "Sam Adams
Brew Pub" - living in Boston has it\'s advantages) and it wasn\'t half bad.

Oh, and avoid the Sea Dog flavor "Hazelnut Porter".  It tastes *exactly*
like cold fizzy hazelnut coffee.  Not a good juxtaposition.  I served one
bottle to six people in demitasse (read espresso) cups and we all agreed
that was just about the right amount ("now hand me an IPA").  A shame whn
Sea Dog makes so many other *good* beers.

ObTrav

Beer has followed humans throughout history, wherever they go.  Egyptians
codified beer brewing practices on their buildings and temples, Ancient
Celts, Romans, Greeks, Aztecs, all brewed this special stuff.  Pilgrims on
the way to Plymouth Rock almost panicked when the beer appeared to be
running out.  It is only natural that beer followed humans to the stars.

Some special cargos;

12 Tons of Genetically Engineered TL12 Brewers yeast
24 tons of premium mutant five-row barley
8 tons of specialty "Pixie Mountain" hops
100 tons of Beer. (Keep the crew out of the cargo bay).

Don\'t forget that it is customary and wise for the prospective cargo buyer
to get a sample of the goods being sold to them. :)

I think I\'ll come up with an adventure based around Beer, then brew a
homebrew to drink while we play.  I could almost use my current batch,
"Fusion Ale".

    'body' => 'Hello folks,

I use a slow moving drive system within my Traveller campaign setting.
The campaign is set in the Verge sector of space, but I don\'t use
the standard  Traveller game background.

Space travel is done by \'Star drive\' or \'Fixed Jump Gates\'. The 
Star Drive system requires the crew to go into Suspended Cold Sleep
for the trip. Usually it takes months to travel between what would
normally be a Jump-1. It all depends on the Drive system of the 
Ship thats using it\'s \'Star Drive\' engines to do the travel.

The \'Fixed Jump Gates\' are usually built within systems that are
both well developed and centrally located along the star lanes. In
my campaign it requires a lot of resources to build a \'Fixed Jump
Gates\'. Plus they are a point to point jump location.

Picture a Large thick Ring that has a very large Reactor built
within it to power the thing. There is a small crew on them, kind
of like Air Traffic Controllers. A ship moves to a jump point, and
contacts the Ring as they are called. Ring Core Command then asks 
the ship it\'s business, destination, and etc.

The Ring\'s crew then activates the Jump Gate and sets the destination
for the ship that is travelling. Then the ship maneuvers into the 
Ring and enters the worm-hole like tunnel to their destination. I 
state that the ship is in Hyper-Space at this point, but they are
travelling in a corridor with the end destination the next Jump Gate.

Now up until this point they were point to point Fixed Jump Gates.
This means that a jump-gate built in system X and then in Y was a 
single link only between x and Y.  Very recently it has been discovered 
through some advancements that depending on the power
of the sender jump-gate and other new technology that it is possible
for one jump-gate to send to other near by systems jump-gates.

Still to even build the jump-gate, takes a lot of resources and
time. So only the main travelled lanes have them. Then travel is
left to \'Star Drives\' travel. The bigger the power system, the
quicker the \'sleepers\' get to their destinations.

As to over all flavor and feel for the setting think of TV show;
Earth 2. You could also think of all of the Aliens movies, plus
Silent Running. 

The players are usually within either the Scouts or work for one
of the many corps like: PELL, Treckion, GTE . I guess one might 
say this is a pocket-empire, but I just don\'t deal with that issue
other to say that human life dates back a long time on their home 
world. Actually they were settled there by the Ancients, but that
is something in game to be discovered.

As to other races, well I have always liked them all but I perfer
to use the  Kaufers (spelling) from Traveller 2300. They are very
cool and so easy to have players hate. I also have some other races
that I\'ve designed, but don\'t all Gm\'s?

So this campaign was played for seven years with the same seven
players. I have to rebuild my gaming group again, and I want to 
reset and make some minor changes. I have non of my original players
so it will all be new for the new group, but I\'m looking for some
ideas and thoughts that some of this collective might have?

You may even say that there are six sets of rules. I\'m referring to what I
would call ET, "Early Traveller", the very first edition of the Traveller
rules. It has jump torpedoes, lack drop tanks, and life support costs are
fixed for each stateroom and low berth regardless of whether they are used
or not (Ie. Cr2000/jump with 0, 1, or 2 occupants!).

And, of course, Imperial Cruisers were a lot smaller...

Ahhh, this minds me of that old Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comic..to paraphase:
"Remember that five year supply of beer we had? (one week later) " ;-)

The only way to keep the crew out of that cargo bay will be to give them a few
cases for the trip.

This brings up another point, albeit obliquely...one thing that _isn\'t_
modeled in shipping and cargo rules are the ubuitiquos sticky fingers that
inhabit every port mankind has ever had.

Do any of you run a port like, say, Kennedy Airport at the height of John
Gotti\'s reign? (for those of you who don\'t know the details, John Gotti,
imprisoned erstwhile head of the New York crime families, and his crew got
their start stealing cargos from Kennedy International Airport. At one point,
losses were reaching staggering levels.)

Guarding your ship well isn\'t going to help much when the ground crew robs you
blind on the trip from your hold to the warehouse, or out of the customs
warehouse. Oh yeah, union rules say you gotta use the local ground crews to
move your cargo, or it doesn\'t get moved. Recalcitrant captains and brokers
will be convinced with baseball bats.

BINGO! I\'ve always disliked the rule that droptanks can\'t be reused because
I felt that it must be possible to use a decoupling system that didn\'t ruin
the tank. But I completely failed to realize the implication of drop tanks
being som much cheaper than interior fuel tankage. Obviously drop tanks are
of much more flimsy construction. So much so that they aren\'t safe to
reuse. I propose the following rule:

	If a drop tank is reused there is a risk of a malfunction.
	Roll 2D. On a 13+ something goes wrong. DM: +1 per previous
	use. Being carried along on a jump is the equivalent of one
	use.

With non-reusable drop tanks, jump-1 high capacity ships are more expensive
than standard ships and jump-2 HC ships are more or less the same cost;
considering the loss in flexibility, I don\'t think you\'d see many. If we
also postulate that most systems would require the user to clean up his
tanks after him (to eliminate a hazard to traffic), jump-3 HC ships may
even become somewhat iffy, depending on the cost of collecting and
disposing of the tanks.

REUSABLE DROP TANKS

What then about making drop tanks that really are reusable? Surely that
would be technically possible (and necessary to allow the _Gazelle_ class
to exist). The exact figures depends on precisely what assumptions you
make, but I\'d estimate that if the volume of fuel sold is high enough
(80,000+ T/year), reusable drop tanks won\'t add more than between 200 and
300 credit to the per ton cost of fuel. So unless there is some way to
cut down on the number of times a year you can use a reusable drop tank,
the basic problem still exists. In my estimate I allowed the tanks to be
used once every 24 hours. How long would you think it could reasonably
take? Here\'s the setup: You have a departing ship stop near your fuel
station at the jump limit. A crew of trained operators go out and mount
drop tanks on the ship. How long does that take? The ship use the tanks
and jumps. The crew fetches back the drop tanks. How long does that take?
Do the tanks need any treatment before they are ready to be used again?

A requirement that the tanks be brought back to a shipyard and have minor
repairs done on them would make them a lot less profitable, but is that a
realistic, or at least a not-TOO-implausible requirement?

Any thought? Opinions?

	How is this for a different start up character system.
Provide players with a pool of points to build character
stats and skills/levels. The players decide what stats they
want and what skills with corresponding levels they also want.
Then as long as they have the needed amount of Character Creation
points, then they can build that character.
	In my game this means that players have to really think
about what matters to them and what is more important. This makes
them think about their choices and work together in character
creation and it also helps to form a better team environment.
People decide what type of career their character really is
following, and build a workable one. Also the group each builds
a character that specializes in a specific set of jobs and also
they build in some lap-over jobs as well. 
	I also use a system for the design of the groups start-up
ship. The team gets a certain pool of Building points where they
spend them to buy a specific hull type, and then the various 
systems that the ship will have. This give the players to tailor
their ship for the type of missions and etc that they want to do.
	As a GM this gives me lots of room for little incentives 
or rewards to have the ship upgraded or refit if the team will
go on this mission or that. 
	I like to give my players total freedom of choice to choose
what they want or don\'t want to do. They can even make their own
issues and etc to pursue. The universe is a big place, and it is
out there for the players to freely explore as they feel is right.

This may be a radical idea, but you could just have one pool for ALL
characters and the ship. Then the players can haggle with each other to
gain more points for themselves.  But it does make a certain amount of
socioeconomic sense.  Presuming somebody is willing to pay to have some
mission done, they have a set amount that they can pay.  Then you just
go about all the applicants until you can put together a team in your
pay range. Kinda like an NFL team.

I had a similar system for a while.  I let the players roll their career
normally, and them they got to buy the skill they wanted off any of the
charts that were open to them that year/term.  I kept the feeling of the
Traveller generation system there, but still gave the players control
over their character.

	I tried that idea as well, but I found that players didn\'t
build the ship then. They would create supper characters and just
hire themselves out as a team. I\'d then have to provide them with a
ship anyway. So I made it two separate pools of points.

	Also in my game I give experience points and players cash
them in to build up their characters and the team gets team points
that allow them to pool towards adding to or upgrading their ship
or other stuff. The group got to decide how the team points were
spent.

	This system allowed me to keep a group together of seven
different players for over seven years. The game only stopped because
I got married, changed jobs, moved, and my son was born within a 
1.25 period of time. Plus I was tired of GMing and wanted to take a
rest and just play for a while.

	After twenty-four years of playing Traveller and GMing for
most of it that past system along with that group of players was
pretty darn good. I am very sad to say that more than half have moved
away, and all the rest have married, had children, bought that first
house, and have very time intense jobs. They like me don\'t have the
time to play any more.
	
	I\'m only lucky that my son is now old enough, and the rest
of my situation is set so I can start to game again on a regular
basis again.  Well I guess it is back to the same old gaming rules
that I have come up with, now to find the correct player base<g>!

Construction Times: Ship\'s of 5,000 tons or less can be completed in 36
months or less by any competent shipyard. Ships over 5,000 tons require
from 24 to 60 months to complete, based on conditions, volume of orders,
and the degree of haste desired by the ordering government.

I am currently working on a visual basic program to automate system and world

Multiplier applies to the mainworld, but do the Gas Giant and Planetoid Belt
numbers only apply to the main system, or the entire system.

Specifically, if you have a UWP that specifies a PGB of 422 (pop mult. of 4, 2
Gas Giants, 2 Planetoid Belts) in a system with a Primary and a Compainion, are
both Gas Giants and Planetoid Belts found in the Primary system, or are they
distributed between both?

My current interpretation is to distribute the Gas Giants/Planetoid Belts

Yep, fair cop. You got me there, however, I still think 
that my ROI calculations are not included in your setup. I 
suspect that I should do something more complicated where I 
consider the investment as the initial 20% and figure out 
the increase in capital vs the costs of interest, (Not to 
mention the decrease in capital for depreciation of the 
ship, which I take to be about 2% per year.)

True to a point. The individuals still have to make up 
their minds if the return is adequate on their investment, 
as I mention above. When I get some time I\'ll think about 
that some more.

> Megacorporations owning ships require rather different calculations. They

Everyone is seeking a return on investment. If after 40 
years you\'ve paid off you ship completely, including 150% 
in interest, and your ship is now worth 20% - 25% of what it used 
to be due to wearing out, then is it worth your while if 
you\'re only making enough to cover payments and costs? You 
haven\'t increased your capital much at all for 40 years of 
effort.

For my purposes those would be interesting, but I can 
probably figure them myself. Although, I\'d tend to charge 
more for port costs (In New Zealand at the moment it costs 
$20,000 per week to berth a ship at port. (In Sydney it\'s 
$40,000 Australian (about $50K NZ). I\'m not sure about how 
long you have in berth.

About twelve years ago when I worked briefly for a wool 
packing plant, it cost NZ$17,000 to ship a standard shipping
container to Europe. (That\'s why they spent big money 
packing wool bales, they could double the number of bales 
that went into a container). which is about 3.5 DispT, I 
think (though it weighed about 6 tons (plus container).

I believe you are correct as long as you assume that every

different.

I\'d expect it to be more like 20%, but that\'s OTTOMH. 
Again, I think your supposition might hold true if you 
assume that almost every J1 trip is worth making,

Think about NZ Lamb for instance. By the time we get it to
market in Europe, about 50% of the cost is shipping, and
we still undercut the local producers. It is still
profitable for us to ship stuff they can make in Europe to
Europe for 50% transport costs. I think trade is a lot
more robust than people think.

Disclaimer: I don\'t have any Traveller books which 
discuss the Imperium\'s overall economic policy.

The Traveller books plainly state that the Imperium is
at the limits of governability -- the distances from Core
to the edges are straining the 3I\'s ability to rule.

The books then imply that government is a bit lax, especially
toward the fringes; another implication, then, is that 
individual worlds may be left to fend for themselves to
a large degree.

Well then, where do you think tax distributions go?  How
are they doled out to the worlds, if at all?  I don\'t have
much material on how the Imperium is taxed; I assume that
since the people here on Earth are so hard to tax, that
a single interstellar government must have a pretty hard
time policing 11,000 worlds, 15 trillion people.

Alright, let me get down to the point.  How much money
does Tureded have to play with?  If the Imperium doesn\'t
have the desire to manage every little world, then why
would it give these worlds much money?  Are member worlds
taxed, or is there just some kind of trade + authority +
protection pact going on here?

Tureded: an up-and-coming world, an Ag world between two
major worlds -- Regina and Rhylanor (and Inthe, if you care).
It\'s still minor league, but it\'s growing.  Currently, it
has 4 \'C\' starports, equidistant along the equator.

Suppose Tureded wants to buy System Defense Boats.  The price
list might go like this:

System Defense Boats
	Cost (MCr)----
disp	hull	m-4	weapons	power		approx. total
200t	10	50	50	50		MCr150
400t	20	100	100	75		MCr300
600t	30	150	150	100		MCr450
800t	40	200	200	125		MCr550
1000t	50	250	250	150		MCr700

	Yearly costs (MCr)----
disp	Loan	Mtc	LS	Salaries	approx total
200	7.5	.15	.25	.1		MCr8
400	15	.3	.5	.2		MCr16
600	22.5	.45	.75	.3		MCr24
800	27.5	.6	1	.4		MCr30
1000	35	.75	1.25	.5		MCr38

I assume the defensive budget is distributed from the general
budget, which may receive income from tarriffs, taxes, the
local subsector government, and perhaps the Imperial government.

Now it\'s time for some guesstimating.  The yearly salary of
the average Tureded worker is Cr5,000.  There are 600,000 people
living there.  Tureded\'s law level is 0.  No taxes?
Assumption:

	Tax % = 5 + law level * 5.

So we have MCr150 to play with.  How much goes to defense?

	Def % = 5 + law level * 5.

So we have MCr7.5 per year toward defense.  You can just forget
about getting any SDBs.

Now enter the Third Imperium.  It takes 10% of the tax revenue
from Tureded (MCr15) and gives back what?  Probably a stop on 
a patrol route.  Why spend more, when it\'s only getting MCr15?
Moreover, who is going to get super rich exploiting such a
small world?  And who wants to make the effort?  Unless the
world is tactically or economically significant, there\'s no
reason to fill it up with ships.

A patrol route, by the way, could be well worth the 10% tax
charged by the Imperium.  A system getting 1000 tons of anti-
pirate action every few months could be sufficient deterrent
to keep the corruption levels reasonably low.  I assume that
0% corruption and 100% efficiency will never exist, and the
numbers may be more like 10% corruption and 70% efficiency.

Now enter alternate possibilities.  A 40-year-old SDB isn\'t
what Core wants to patrol its sector with; but it might be
just the thing for a marginal Spinward world.  Payments made
on an old but maintained 200t SDB would be only MCr4 per year,
which might well be affordable by a small world.


Now let\'s take Regina, UWP A788899-C, Rich and Subsector Capital.
Not only does she have SDB\'s, she has a Naval base which I take
to mean patrols all the time, for free.  How nice!

	Tax % = 5 + 9 * 5, or 50%.  Ouch, very steep.

Assuming the average salary is Cr10,000, and we have 700,000,000
people, then we have a budget of

	MCr 3500000, or
	BCr 3500, or
        3.5 Trillion Credits.

With a military budget of half that, or 1.75 Trillion Credits.
If you think that\'s high, then trim taxes down to 25%... you still
get TCr 1.75 budget, BCr 875 defense!  Wow!

Ok, for BCr875 we can buy a trillion credit squadron, or a buncha
SDBs.  Let\'s buy 1000-ton SDBs:

	875 000 000 000 / 700 000 000

Heck, Regina can BUY WITH CASH one thousand 1000-ton SDBs each year
if she so chooses.  This just doesn\'t seem "right" to me, but I
can\'t see how the numbers are wrong... that\'s 1 million tons of
ship built each year -- maybe shipyard capacity is a factor here,
since the rule is 1000 people per dT constructed, giving a 
theoretical ceiling of 700,000 dT.  That\'s still 700 SDBs max built 
locally per year in Regina (of course, real capacity may well be
less than half of that, but still, 100 SDBs per year is formidable).

The lab is spread all around town. You can look from the outside of
buildings, but the only place you can go in without knowing somebody
is the Bradbury Science Museum--kind of a vistior facility.

Sandia is on Kirtland AFB. The National Atomic Museum is there if
you wish to look at old bombs.

The VLA is worth the 2.5 hour drive from Albuquerque, though...

After Steven Hudson mentioned TCS had some detailed rules on optional fuel
tankage, I went and had a look at the "original intent" of the various 
types of tanks.  

One clear comment:  "Enough fuel for the power plant must be carried in
normal fuel tanks."

Collapsible tanks were bladders installed in the cargo hold.  They took up
only as much space as the fuel in them, but you could only use them for
storage.  Before jumping, the fuel had to be pumped into regular tankage
(about three hours).  When empty, they took up 1% of their displacement
when full.  Install at any A or B starport in one week at Cr 500/ton.

Demountable tanks came in two types, interior and exterior.  These tanks
take up their full displacement no matter how much fuel is in them, but
you could jump with the fuel in the extra tankage without transferring it.
Tanks could be built in 10 weeks at any A or B starport for Cr 1000/ton.
The crew could then install it themselves anywhere in two weeks, or a
professional crew could be hired for Cr 10/ton of tank to install it in
one week at any A-D starport.  Interior tanks take up cargo room.  For
exterior tanks, you pay another Cr 500/ton for exterior tank supports,
and the ship is unstreamlined as long as they\'re installed, and it adds
to the ship\'s displacement.

Drop tanks could also be built in 10 weeks at an A or B starport for 
Cr 1000/ton.  Tank supports cost a flat fee of Cr 10000 at time of
construction, or Cr 1000/ton of tank as an add-on.  Once built, the
tank is installed in minutes.  Streamlining is unaffected!  Whether
they can be refurbished and remounted is unclear.  Drop tanks are 
exterior tanks, and add to displacement.

All exterior tanks are unarmored and fragile.  TCS handled this in a
very simple way:  "Whenever a battle damage die-roll, unmodified by
armor, would produce a fuel hit, all exterior or drop tanks are 
destroyed."  In other words, if on that last hit, by ignoring your
ship\'s armor bonuses you\'d have gotten a fuel hit, the tanks are gone
in addition to other effects.

I could find no reference to storable internal demountable tanks (the 
ones that fold up when demounted) until FF&S.

For $7 it would be bottles of import or high-quality beer.  $7 will get you

One thought. Assumption: fuel can be kept at a slurry/liquid in a
hull-protected internal fuel tank using ship\'s power. Since a drop
tank\'s
external surface is exposed to direct starlight, how much more difficult
would it be to maintain fuel storage temperature with the tank surface
area being exposed to solar radiation? After all, solar heat is the main
reason the U.S. space shuttle and astronaut EVA suits are stark white.

Any tank-contained cooling system would probably need to be
replenished/refurbished after each use. Depending on the system, this
process could take *days* after the tank is transported to the replenish
site.

Thats true for many of the midwest and bible belt states.  Its a shame too,
because I just cannot get a buzz from 3.2% beer.  I know that in Oklahoma, you
can get the better stuff in the liquor store but only warm.

Have you tried the Raspberry Wheat Sam Adams?
It tastes like Crunchberry Cereal, one of the Captain Crunch flavors.

G\'day Robert. Welcome to the list.

One resource I think you need is \'Pocket Empires\', which discusses all this
stuff.

Sort of. One of the key features of the 3I in my view is that it doesnt try
to rule - it just keeps the space between the stars free and enforces a
couple of basic rules.

Fair enough.

I\'m not sure about linking defense specding to law level. I\'d be more
inclined to say 3% at peace, 6% outside the frontier or 9% if in a cold war.

Sort of. Greg Svennson built a TL12 13 dton Light Fighter that had a
sticker price of MCr 22 or so. It was decent - pulled about 4 gees, had OK
sensors and a 250 megajoule laser on it. Tureded could probably afford
three of them, giving it a minimal space defense capability.

Except for the fact that pirates could use it as a base to prey on

If you have an official policy of non-intervention, some Duke in Core might
\'adopt\' a planet, and have his \'pleasure yacht\' take a cruise by there, and
launch a \'hunting expidition\' (with local bearers and guides, of course)
there.

Big worlds dominate the Traveller universe. The scary bit is that Regina
isnt big - it\'s only pop code 8, and it\'s technology is nothing to write
home about either. Do the numbers for, say, Trin.

What becomes likely is that Regina can station a squadron of SDBs on
Turedeed (with local government consent), in order to protect Regina-ownded
starships from piracy.

In my view, this will answer the question \'How much civilian shipping could
the Imperium build, if it had to\' rather than the question \'How much
civilian shipping does the Imperium build normally\'.

The analogy I\'d use is shipbuilding in Britain between 1939 and 1945, which
was far higher than normal - in fact, they pretty much built as much as
they could build. Taking those numbers and applying them will give make the
British merchant marine far larger than it actually was.

Are they really that grim? Here at LLNL we have a visitors center with some
(admittedly boring) exhibits. I know LANL has a slightly different culture
from a security standpoint but didn\'t realize it was quite that severe.

Does WSMR have a visitors center? 

There are tours of the Trinity site every few months or perhaps once a year,
but I suspect you\'ve already missed this year\'s window.

This is a lot like the systems other games use (GURPS, Champions).  In
my recent T4 game, I had the characters generate the characters based
on the T4 rules (rolling for admission, successful completion of their
terms, promotions, etc.), however .... 

To create their physical attributes, 12 dice were rolled 
simultaneously.  Then, the player could pair these off to create the
type of character they wanted (or as close as they could get).  This
allowed them to match a couple of 6s together to get a really strong
character, but often led to a character weaker in another attribute.

Also, players were allowed to pick both the table and the skill they
wanted for each year in service.   Additionally, they could change
careers when they wanted.  I applied a -1 DM for the admission roll on
the first change, a -2 DM on the second and so forth.  

This seemed to work well and my players got to create characters that
they really wanted, while still maintaining the Traveller character
generation "feel."  

I also give experience points as per the T4 rules.  Usual 1 or 2 per
game.

     I seem to recall that there was a figure mentioned of how many tons of
starship different classes of ports could build at any one time.
     Second, somewhere in High Guard is given a figure of how many weeks it
takes to build a starship relative to the size of it. I need that figure.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

From p31 of TCS:

C=P x GM/1000

C is Shipyard Capacity in tons
P is population of the World (people, not population factor)
GM is Current Government Budget Percentage Modifier, from the following:

Type:  0    1      2    3     4      5      8     9      A     B     C      D
Peace .5   .8   1.0  .9   .85    .95   1.1   1.15  1.2  1.1   1.2    .75
War   1.5  1.4  1.5  1.2  1.45 1.4    1.2  1.2    1.5   1.2   1.5   1.5

Type 6 governments use the modifier of the government controlling
them, type 7 governments use the modifier of whatever 
government controls the shipyard.

HOWEVER: Due to this capacity being related to whether the
government is at war or not, IMO this capacity refers to 
military shipbuilding facilities only. How this relates to 
merchant shipbuilding is difficult to determine, as it 
would vary for each government type and economic
condition.

From page 33 of TCS:
Construction Time Table
Tons..................Weeks
50 or less...........24
80......................32

500000................232
1000000..............240

"For tonnages other than those given on the table,
the referee should round to the nearest number or
interpolate."

Speeding up construction:
Class: If ship is not the first ship in it\'s class, +40%
If double yard capacity is assigned: +40%
Every extra 10% of weekly construction cost
paid: +10%

Total all modifiers above, maximum +100%, for
each week of construction - for example,
if +30% applies, each week counts as 
1.3 weeks.

It may be that the class modifier for speeding
up construction only applies if at least one ship
of that class has been built in that shipyard, as
the modifier is due to construction crews becoming
familiar with the class - p20 of High Guard supports
this.

\'TNS Begins\'

VAWARD/OLD EXPANSES      Date: 151-1122
  Concern mounted in financial markets here today as the
headquarters analysts of Hortalez et Cie announced that
earnings had declined by 12% during calendar year 1121.
  While much of this assessment is based on algorithmic
projections (actual reports often taking years to reach
HeC\'s headquarters here on Vaward), market experts were
forced to concede that this estimate was probably
accurate to within 0.1%.
  When asked to speculate on what had caused this sudden
downturn, the experts almost universally cited Hortalez\'s
massive asset trade with the four Vilani megacorporations
which had been concluded on 090-1121.
  Although the trade had been conducted and conceptualized
with a great public show of amity, anonymous spokespersons
from Zirunkarish now speculate that Hortalez et Cie "had
little faith in the long-term viability of markets within
the Ziru Sirkaa -- a common mistake amongst financiers with
decidedly Solomani mindsets."
  When asked to comment on these various speculations, HeC
Senior Adminstrator Nils Petersen suggested, "People should
watch a little more closely and patiently, and speculate a
little less. From our (Hortalez et Cie\'s) standpoint,
everything is proceeding right on schedule and just as we
expected."
  Petersen declined to make any further statement that might
shed light on his enigmatic comments.

This goes without saying.  And it *IS* in the rules someplace.  And I\'ve

The Traveller Adventure had a subplot of the crew of March Harrier obtaining 
demountable tanks installed in the cargo hold of the ship.  This was to allow 
the ship to get off the Aramis Trace.  These tanks took up 50 DT space and 
were *NOT* collapsable tanks!!!

  That works for T4, and for drop-tanks in general. For High Guard
(which is admittedly geared towards warships rather than merchants)
the avoidance of the MCr 0.1 hull cost by using exterior demountable
tanks is still a broken design rule.

  Both attachment and recovery timetables might be best avoided
(in the real-world equivalent business sense) by simply warehousing
more tanks, attaching beforehand, and reconditioning them in time
provided by the spare stocks. Running three shifts 7/24 will be more
efficient (theoretically; in space, no one can hear you slacking off)
than worrying about angry customers, penalties, and O/T, D/T.

  Agreed.

  A good idea, especially if they wait a while (year or two?) to 
make it look a little less conspicuous. However, I think most of
the current discussion is in the context of jumping straight from
a 100-d limit refuelling (/drop tank regime) station, where taking
control of the ship before it\'s in jumpspace is effectively
impossible.

  I\'d be _really_ surprised if it weren\'t possible.

  What if the company buys back their ship and then passes their

  Yes, but a lot of the enforcement authorities are going to be very
difficult (if not impossible) to bribe. OTOH, piracy or the ship
disposal aspect of hijacking flows much more smoothly with a strategic
sanctuary (well, systematic piracy is probably suicidal without one).

  Also, if the pay-off is great enough there\'s real question as to 
why the hijack team (the most highly skilled and vulnerable players
here) would continue to play attrition roulette.

  Some adventures include coverage of what inspired corruption can
achieve, including the old WD "Sable Rose Affair".

  Come to think of it, that scenario is about a raid to collect evidence
to close down the pirate sympathizers in the planetary government...

  Yep. But by definition the majority of traffic will be through high
traffic systems, which presumably have many mail deliveries each day.
Certainly all regularly scheduled runs are covered, as can be any ship
that takes long enough to get a cargo, or plans far enough ahead (by
fluke in this case), or gets lucky with outgoing scheduling.

  It certainly combines to make hijacking of any but the most 
marginal of tramp freighters wildly impracticable.

Not possible. Gases have a "critical temperature" (different for each
gas). Above that temp, *no* amount of pressure will liquefy the gas.
The critical temp for hydrogen is pretty damn low. Probably around 100K
(I don\'t have references handy).

And the ships *do* have a heat sink. It\'s called "empty space". They
have to *radiate* the heat away. 

Standard method of liquefying gases with low boiling points is to
compress it, which heats the gas. You cool the compressed gas, and let
it expand thru a nozzle (which cools the gas). You circulated the
cooled gas back to cool the compressed gas. Several cycles of this gets
the gas cold enough to liquefy (I\'ve simplified the process). Each
"compression" stage is cooled by expanding gas from the next stage. 

You still have deal with getting rid of the heat from the other stages
in various ways.

Or, if you\'ve got plenty of time, anything exposed to "empty space" and
insulated from the heat the shiup is radiating will eventually wind up
at 3K. Hydrogen liquefies at 20k. So simply pumping hydrogen thru a
properly designed radiator panel will get you LH2. It\'ll just take a
while. 

That\'s also how you keep the tanks cold. Lots of insulation, and a
steady trickle thru a radiator to chill stuff down to well below 20K.

30 mph is not a "high" crosswind.

Ah! But they are balanced around the center of *gravity* (aka center of
mass) of the ship. In free space, you want thrusts balanced around this
point.

But wind forces will be balanced around the center of pressure which
*must* be in a quite different location (otherwise the ship would be
airframe or streamlined, etc).

This mismatch of thrust and sterring forces to the wind forces is what
will cause trouble.

Remember, we are talking about a ship of a hull type that the rules say
*isn\'t* allowed to land (I forget the exact names other than
"streamlined" and "airframe"). And that pretty much means that there is
*something* about the shape that makes it unstable in the presence of
wind forces. 

And other folks are even talking about trying this with "open frame"
ships. 

There are *lots* of shapes that meet your criteria, but that combined
with various mass distributions inside the hull, will make the ship[
wildly unstable in any sort of wind. 

What matters is the relationship between the center of mass and the
center of pressure as well as the direction the ship is moving. For
stability, you want the CP *behind* the CG by at least a couple of body
diameters. In that configuration, the ship will actually self correct
any deflecting forces.

If the CP and CG are in the same place, the ship will have no inherent
stability, and any deflection will be unopposed. 

If the CP is *ahead* of the CG, the ship will have *negative*
stability. Any deflecting force will be *amplified* by the ship, and if
under power, it will try its damndest to tumble wildly (due to the
relative airflow cause by the thrust combined with the actual airflow).

And since the thrusters are paired around the CG, their restoring
forces won\'t match the deflecting forces.

Sorry, but both dirigibles and helicopters *do* take CG/CP into
account. They are either airframe or that other clas I can\'t recal the
name of that is also allowed to enter atmospheres.

They are both aerodynamically stable (though the copter requires a
thrust to counter the torque of the main rotor).

Have that crew with the 100 tons of beer get their drive knocked out,
and be on a collision course with something, say an asteroid. They\'ll
be fine if they could only apply a few m/s of delta-V. Will they
realize that the beer can provide the required thrust if they kluge up
some plumbing and a proper exhaust nozzle?

At least two SF writers (Poul Anderson and A. Bertram Chandler) have
used this gag. It\'s also the subject of a Trek related filk song.

That\'s what ends fermentation here on earth. The alcohol level gets
high enough to kill the yeasts (unless there isn\'t enough sugar for
them to get that far).

No, but the "yeast" in "yeast infection" *is*. And that *could* get
carried by people easily enough.

For that matter, if the tribe Grandfather grabbed was from an area
where a lot of natural yeasts were floating around (say it was fall and
lots of fermenting fruit on the ground), the spores *could* get carried
along on people\'s bodies or hair.

On the other hand, there\'s a junkyard where LANL sends scrap from
projects. You can find the *damndest* things there. Chunks of exotic
metals, remains of instrumentation. All sorts of stuff. 

I\'d be tempted to drop by and ask if they\'ve got any lanthanum. :-)

If you look at medieval taxation it becomes apparent that taxes on goods
moving across boundries (city walls, rivers, national borders, etc) have
always been popular for this reason.

That may explain why I couldn\'t find it in any fluid mechanics book,

No, but the van was experiencing winds ranging from 80 mph to 85 mph
with the direction varying quickly.

Yes, but since they can vary their thrust, one can thrust more than
another to account for any unbalance.  Also, any rolling is going to
be about the center of gravity anyway, so the thrusters will be able
to counter i

If the ship is a cube and the center of gravity is in the center of
the cube then it will be in the same place as the center of pressure
since the whole thing is symmetrical and there\'s no way for anything
to be uneven.  Does Traveller define cubes as "unstreamlined"?

Maybe this is the problem... I\'m going with more general definitions
of "unstreamlined".  If "streamlined" means capable of entering an
atmosphere and operating with a reasonable chance of survival then that
would include a lot of ships which wouldn\'t be considered "streamlined"
by the ordinary definition of the word.

This would be a bad idea, I agree.  In addition to all the other
problems you\'d have, you\'d have wind rushing through your ship.

My assumption is that most ships will keep the center of mass near the
geometric center since it\'s much easier to build such a ship and the
maneuvering thrusters would probably make this assumption.  I would
cheerfully apply penalties to maneuver a ship with the center of mass
very far off from the geometric center in atmosphere *or* in space.

All of the above discussion seems to imply that the ship is moving
pretty fast.  Maybe if you define "center of pressure" in technical
terms that would help me.  You can send me a private email if you
think that that\'s not of general interest to the list.

You haven\'t commented on my analysis of the magnitude of forces.  To
me, that\'s pretty telling... the forces were so low as to not cause
any problem at all even if they are unbalanced.  Do you disagree with
my comments?  The inertia of most ships will be enough that forces
of the magnitude you described will cause it to wiggle a bit but
not enough to throw it out of control.

OK. With the caveat that I don\'t have the books with me and _may_ possibly
be mixing in my own interpretations, here is what I remember of what few
rules there are:

According to _Trillion Credit Squadron_ each world has an annual budget
for the fleet alone of Cr500/citizen. Army budget is not mentioned. Note
that TCS deal with pocket empires and that analogies to the Imperium may
or may not be valid. 

According to _Striker_, military budget ranges from 1 to 15%, with 1%
being after a _looong_ period of peace and 15% was full scale war. The
average was, IIRC, 3% for the peacetime Imperium. Of this money 30%
goes to the Imperium, who lets the subsector forces keep half and use
the other half for its regular fleets. Its unclear if the Scouts are
paid out of the this or whether their budget comes from elsewhere 
(They may even be earning their own upkeep for all we know). IMO the
Imperial Army and Marines also comes out of the 15% but the percentage
is small (6%). Of the remaining 70%, 40% (ie. 28% of the total) is used
for the planetary army if the main world has a breathable atmosphere,
otherwise only 6% (4.2% of the total) goes to the army. The remainder
is used for system defenses. How much of that, if anything, goes to
jump-capable ships, how much to system defense boats, and how much to
fixed defense is not defined.  
 
>The books then imply that government is a bit lax, especially
>toward the fringes; another implication, then, is that 
>individual worlds may be left to fend for themselves to
>a large degree.

The two-tier fleet system implies that the subsector fleets are available
for defense of the subsector\'s systems unless transferred somewhere else,
something that seems only to happen in a full-scale war.

The Imperium dosen\'t tax people, it taxes worlds based on the size of
their population. Collecting the loot is the planetary government\'s 
problem.
 
>Alright, let me get down to the point.  How much money does Tureded have
>to play with?

Tureded: 2414 C465540-9/6. 600,000 inhabitants. Tax base: 6,000,000,000
local credits. 3% of that = 180 MCr. 70% of that = 126 MCr. Less 40% for
the army leaves MCr75.6.

According to the quick system used in TCS, Tureded could support MCr756
worth of navy ships. This would cover all expenses, including crew,
logistics, ground support, pensions, and replacement of worn-out ships
(but not repairs and replacement of shot-up ships). However, this only
applies if Tureded builds and maintains the boats themselves. Which is
not allowed by TCS rules, but is allowed by Book 2 (or is it High Guard). 

If Tureded has to buy the boats or ships elsewhere, their credits will
have to be converted into local credits for the world that builds the
vessels and will buy less (Though the vessels they buy will fight much
better).

Why did the British fight for the Falkland Islands? That surely wasn\'t
cost-effective.

Tax base: 7,000,000,000,000 local credits. 3% of that = 210,000 MCr. Less
30% for the Imperium = 147,000 MCr. Less 40% for the army = 88,200 MCr.
For a system defense fleet worth 882,000 MCr.

If it takes three hours to pump fuel from collapsible tanks into the
regular tanks, then obviously they can\'t be used directly. But that really
begs the question. WHY does it take so much longer to pump fuel from a
collapsible tank than from a rigid tank?

Well, a water impact is a LOT worse than a land impact.  You hit in the ocean, 
the ocean keeps trying to come back in and cover the hole and gets boiled away 
some more, throwing *megatons* of water into the atmosphere.

At least they didn\'t try to say that it would throw radiation all over the 
place...

     First, big thanks to those who replied to me by e-mail with the TCS
rule I was looking for. [Thanks also to those who replied to the list but I
would also ask that, in future, you honour my stated request and send it to
me personally so as not to waste bandwidth.]
     The bulk of the analysis below comes from Christopher Thrash
(thrash@io.com) who applied it to the Islands Cluster. I do not agree with
all of his assumptions but I consider the bulk of them valid. In any event
I\'m including the base number so any of you can apply your own pet theories
and see where they take you. [If I\'m missing any numbers you need, let me
know and I\'ll send them on privately.] One should assume any deficiencies
in the analysis are mine, not his!


Summated values for the whole Imperium:
                              Number of worlds:                    7935
                             Total Population :      12,903,285,535,532
Peacetime Naval Revenue (TCS, Starport A only):  $1,596,550,999,319,370
     Total Shipyard Capacity (Starport A only):          32,959,453,188t


Using a logarithmic model based on the required construction time for the
number of ships at each tonnage class, you come up with 5000 tons (144
weeks/2.8 years) as a mean value.

Assume the following:
40 year lifespan for ships (based on mortgage period) = 2.5% per year * 2.8
years to build = 7%
Annual maintenance = 2% of total tonnage
New builds and unscheduled maintenance = 1% of total tonnage

Therefore, the total fleet tonnage (merchant and naval) = Capacity / 10% =
Capacity * 10.

To separate naval from commercial tonnage is more complicated:  Average the
per-ton costs of all the ships in Supplements 7 - Traders and Gunboats -
and 9 - Fighting Ships, to come up with the following figures.

Naval Vessels: Cr 500,000 per ton.
Armed Merchants:    Cr 250,000 per ton.
Unarmed Merchants:  Cr 200,000 per ton.

Using TCS rules you can calculate the naval budget.  Multiply this by 10 to
get total value of ships in commission; divide by Cr 500,000 to get tons.
Subtract naval tonnage from the total to get merchant tonnage.

NavBudget * 10 / MCr 0.5 = total tons of naval fleet

Total tonnage - naval tonnage = commercial tonnage

Once again using average values from Traders and Gunboats, merchant ships
are about 50% cargo (counting staterooms and low berths by their volume).

commercial tonnage * 50% = cargo capacity

cargo capacity * 25 jumps per year / 52 weeks per year = cargo carried per
week.

So, applying the above, the totals are:

    Total Ship Tonnage in service :  329,594,531,883t
   Total Naval Tonnage in service :   31,931,019,986t
Total Merchant Tonnage in service :  297,663,511,896t
    Hold capacity of the Imperium :  148,831,755,948t
           Cargo shipped per week :   71,553,728,821t
     Avg Cargo per world per week :        9,933,964t
   Avg Cargo per citizen per year :                0.29t

Here are some suppliers for lanthanum I got off the web:

from Stanford Materials Company
http://www.stanfordmaterials.com/la.html:
Lanthanum Metal     Purity: 99%      50kg lot      US$23.75/kg
La-Rich Rare Earth Carbonates  - Purity ~60%     1MT lot
US$2300/MT

from Haiku Trading Company Catalog
http://www.t-link.net/~htc/RareEarth.html
Lanthanum Metal     Purity: 99%      US$ - Inquire at htc@t-link.net


Also, I found this listing of uses for lanthanum at 
http://www2.shef.ac.uk/~chem/web-elements/nofr-uses/La.html.
Notice use number 4.

1) rare-earth compounds containing lanthanum are extensively used in
carbon lighting applications, especially by the motion picture industry
for studio lighting and projection 
2) 203La improves the alkali resistance of glass, and is used in making
special optical glasses 
3) small amounts as an additive are used to produce nodular cast iron 
4) hydrogen sponge alloys containing lanthanum reversibly take up to 400
times their own volume of hydrogen gas. Heat is released, therefore
these alloys have potential in energy conservation systems 
5) lighter flints 
6) alloys

Certainly no hijacker can know ahead of time whether his ship will arrive
two days before or two days after another ship that left at the same time.
If the route has a few ships per day going to the same destination, his
odds goes way down.

Still, hijackers have much better chances of actually taking over a ship
than pirates (Provided they can manage to smuggle weapons onboard. And can
get control of the ship\'s computer... if not they are just riding a
floating coffin on a rendevouz with Authorities With Big Guns). All in
all I think hijackers are bucking a severely stacked deck, but at least
not as stacked as the one pirates are up against.

Just my opinion, of course.

That seems an awful lot! But it works out as only .026t per citizen. I
wonder how the amount of shipping in the modern worlds compares.

>Total Naval Tonnage in service :   31,931,019,986t
>Total Merchant Tonnage in service :  297,663,511,896t
It is interesting, but it turns out that the proportion of naval ships to
merchant ships is about 1:10, exactly what I herd proffered as the ideal
escort:trader ratio.

>Hold capacity of the Imperium :  148,831,755,948t
Hmmm, who was calculating interest lost while goods were in transit? It
would be interesting to turn the above into how much a 1-week jump transit
is costing the Imperium. Imagine if even a fraction of that was spent
researching instantaneous travel?

>Avg Cargo per world per week :        9,933,964t
This tends to support the view that the bulk of trading is done by mammoth
supertankers on fixed contracts. And that the tables in the books only
reflect the leftovers that tramp freighters can scavenge. The normal
supertanker I tend to design carries 100,000t of cargo. The above implies
that nearly 100 of these pass through a week. Jeeez. Maybe I should start
assuming that a supertanker carries 1,000,000t of cargo. That\'s 10 per week
split amongst the various megacorps. That makes a bit more sense.
Backwaters will obviously see less traffic, nodes will see more.

>Avg Cargo per citizen per year :                0.29t
This is interesting, not so much for relating to the impact of shipping on
the individual, but more as giving a baseline for working out how much
cargo a world produces/consumes per year. Just multiple the pop by 0.29.


Now my assessment of the assumptions behind the calculations is that they
are a bit on the conservative side. Peacetime budget is used. The TCS
capacity figures are assumed to apply to both commercial and naval
shipping. The 40% discount for repeat ships is not applied. And a 40 year
life span is assumed [this is my biggest beef, like my car is going to fall
apart once the 3 year lease is up?]. But, since adjusting any of these will
just increase the results, and the figures are already staggeringly large,
I\'m happy to consider these numbers a _minimum_.

Another implicit assumption is that all shipyards are working to full
capacity. This may seem unrealistic, but having lived with news stories of
the various shipyards of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland agonizing
about closing it seems the average present shipyard either has its books
full, or it just plain closes down and goes out of business. Maintenance
and a 1% fudge factor built in as well. Now, you may say "but what about
all the _spaceships_", i.e. the non-jump ships. A valid point. But there
are still scads and scads of B starports that aren\'t figured into the
above.

On the cargo side, there is another assumption being made that all cargo
holds are full. This may seem optimistic. My knee-jerk reaction is to
assume that they run on 50% capacity. But, looking another way, why ship
empty space? _Anything_ you are going to make _any_ profit on looks good if
the alternative is transporting air.

More thoughts as they surface...

Another point to consider when calculating ROI on personally owned
starships is that the starship is your home too. You, and your crew, are
avoiding living expenses (and taxation?) on an expensive high TL world.
Unless of course you maintain homes as well (How many PCs do that?). If
you were maintaining standard business accounts you would have to
exclude the personal usage from your accounts. This would make ship
accounts look much more profitable. 

This would lead me to expect that personally owned starships are likely
to be quite often Family businesses with family partnerships
(Husband/Wife, Brothers/Sisters, in-laws, etc.). The partners would have
no fixed planetary home.  This keeps profits in the Family and leads to
strong commitment from all family crew members. Are there any
interesting examples of family owned ships out there?

This leads naturally on to:

Do the traveller books mention anywhere the effects of bringing up a
family on a starship? Does jump-space, artificial gravity or any other
ship-board field do anything to the growing process? Is it safe to be
pregnant in jump space or to be taking jump-drugs? Should a captain
refuse to take pregnant passengers or insist that all passengers sign a
pregnancy disclaimer (male and female)?

Heh-heh: this has gone to the top of my list of passenger mishaps.

OK, so the population of a system is spread all over the system.  That makes sense on some of the Red Zone population figures of the CT stuff when you convert them to MT.  It also allows for a \'fuel point\' to be staffed in interdicted systems, as long as they stay away from the interdicted planet itself...

There is an article about religion in the Two Thousand Worlds in one of the
original JTAS\'s.   I think it was the last one--24?

highly reflective coating (as noted previously). This will increase the
detection signature of the ship dramatically. 

A cheap design of semi-permanent tanks would be to make them double
skinned. Then refrigerate by pumping extra cold liquid hydrogen from the
main tanks around the outside of the tank. 

It may also be necessary to keep full tanks in the shade of the ship, as
much as possible, to minimize solar heating. Limiting maneuverability.

High G maneuvers are likely to be out of the question, when the tank is
full, as this may rip it free or rupture it. With internal collapsible
tanks this may also be a problem.

Very cheap drop tanks could be nothing more than reinforced silver
balloons (foamed plascrete?).  These would just contain extra cold
liquid hydrogen and must be used before the hydrogen can boil. These
tanks would have to be used quickly from fill-up to Jump time. This
gives a commercial advantage to the fueling station in that in order to
fill the tank quickly they would have to fill it with refined fuel (at
last - a use for it!). There would not be time for a ship to purify the
required volume of unrefined fuel before it would boil. To eject the
drop tank just pull the plug and let the residual hydrogen boil and jet
it away! 

Points arising:

How heavily is refined/unrefined fuel taxed?

In what other ways are starships taxed?

How far does planetary jurisdiction (and taxation) extend? 

Is everything beyond 100 Diameters "interstellar space" ?

If refueling stations are in interstellar space then there may be
competition to drive down the price of fuel. (i.e. filling stations get
raw fuel from nearest gas giant and transfer by low G tug(s) to 101
diameter point).

There was an article in Dragon magazine once upon a time that had a Clergy
career for Traveller and described a couple of religions. I do not remember
if there was a general discussion about religion or not, though.

Mark you need to talk to your friend again.

Folks, having been here at LANL for the past seven years, working with every
program from the ion beam to the PIT production line at PF4....there is a
Visitor\'s Center, called the Bradbury Museum that shows the history of the
Lab as well as a local Historical Society\'s museum.   Yes, there are
classified areas that you can get shot at if you cross the fences, but for
the most part the Lab is an open area.  The last time you had to check in to
get into town was 1972, IIRC.

Sandia/Kirtland AFB has the National Atomic Museum.  This acts for the most
part as the Visitor\'s there.  Here be mock-ups of most historical nuclear
weapons as well a examples of delivery systems.  There is an excellent
display on the history of the Polamar, Spain incident when the US lost four
live weapons.  That was a real Broken Arrow!

Say can anyone with Special Weapons experience recall the terms for Nuclear
weapons incidents/accidents??

Dull Sword, Bent Spear, Broken Arrow....What\'s the fourth?  and are there
more terms for other types of incidents?

If any of you really desire to see either museum and are in the area, drop
me a line.  Also, if you plan a trip in April or October, Trinity Site is
open to the public on one weekend in each month.

More telling than anything else in ths review, is a clear indication of
exactly what our priorities are on this planet...

"It is interesting that the complete Spaceguard survey could be
accomplished for the cost of either one of these films: Deep Impact or
Armageddon."

Given that these movies should easily recoup their investments (despite
what the public hears, and the public books say, most Hollywood movies
do make money) it\'s interesting (and depressing) that people are willing
to plonk down $7-$10 to watch a movie about what could happen, and
aren\'t willing to pay the same as taxes to have some warning about it if
it really does happen.

  Part of the original assumption was having anywhere from a day to a week
before leaving for the announced destination. There are still systems out
there where the ref is going to have a hard time believing in any scheduled
traffic whatsoever; in some of those all you need to be a successful pirate
is a _spaceship_ (non-Jump), a plan, some luck, and the brains to quit while
you\'re ahead.

  It depends on the circumstances, of course, but in a peacetime Imperium
the conditions for dedicated (i.e., career) piracy will be extremely hard
to come by.
        - strategic sanctuary (for construction, resupply, selling)
        - avoidance of armed patrols / intervention

  Strangely enough, I\'m not sure that wartime will actually improve the
situation, although the collapse phase for the losing side could be rich
pickings. The actual combat zone would resemble a lottery.

Hmmmm...

I\'d never even considered that.  (yeek)  The UWP for population is the entire

Makes sense I guess.  Gonna be a major pain when I get to coding that section of
system development tho\'...

Untrue. If the gov\'t spent the money it has better, it would easily have
enough to pay for Spaceguard.

When I priced them here I was surprised by firearms prices - The price of a
new centrefire rifle actually hasn\'t gone up as much as I thought. IIRC a
Ruger 77 in .243 Winchester cost my father NZ$800 - 900 about 15 years ago,
and the equivilent Remington costs about $1200 now. This give an average
inflation rate in rifles prices of 1.0 - 1.9% per annum over the last 15
years. As Inflation has averaged somewhere in the 2 - 3% range over the
past decade here this is pretty good - it\'s not even too bad when compared
to the average salary, IIRC it\'s risen by about 20 -25% over the last
decade (yes that does mean that the average income earner is poorer than
they were a decade ago).

What do you mean by that?

Our teachers have to have 3+ years of tertiary education and start off at
about $28,000 per year, IIRC. The average class size at high school is
about 30, I think.

Looking at Eris\' figures our teachers are paid more, compared to the
average wage than yours are (where he is, anyway).

This brings up a question - How much are Traveller taxed? And who collects
the taxes? 

If it is the Planet of Registry for the ship, we\'ll see worlds that are
like some countries today. They\'ll have no shipbuilding industry, and yet
have vast merchant fleets because they\'ll set their taxes and registration
fees nice and low to attact all that yummy Imperial currency.

I would think the only reasonable method of taxation in an state such as
the Imperium would be a sales tax on every item sold or every service
rendered.  For ease of play, I would think that the percentage would be
figured into the listed price as shown in the book or generated during
design.

As noted below, wind forces will cause rotations about the center of

But *why* would the CG be the center of the ship? For use in space, it
makes more sense to have the thrusters and power plant (and thus a
*big* chunk of the mass!) at the stern. That throws the CG *way* off.

Well, as I recall, there was a *third* category of hull that could
enter atmosphere. And that\'s where your "cube" would go.

As noted above, there are *good* reasons to have the CG quite a bit off
center. And in space, it doesn\'t matter. You either offset the
maneuvering thrusters so they can be the same "size" and still balance,
or you use bigger ones on the "heavier" side. And the computer would
know how to "balance" the thrusters. Which would cause some real
trouble in atmosphere as the forces wouldn\'t be centered where the
computer expects! :-)

The Center of gravity is the sum of all the moment arms due to *mass*.
That is, you take the mass of each component of the ship, and the
distance from some arbitrary point (say the nose of the ship), multiply
them together, and average them (I think, it\'s been a *long* time since
I did CG calculations by hand!). 

For CP you do similar calculations, only you use the cross sectional
area of the sections of the hull. For truly *accurate work, you have to
get into a whole bunch of stuff due to angle of attack and the like.
But for a *conservative* answer, you can quite literally take a piece
of card stock shaped like the cross section of the ship and find out
where it blances. (The fancy stuff takes into account things like drag
variations based on the differing curvatures on different parts of the
hull). 

This is why you see fins on the tail end of a rocket. The extra area at
the tail helps move the CP towards the tail.

I think CP is also used in figuring various things for aircrafty, but
I\'m only familiar with using CP/CG calcs to calculate the stability of
rockets. 

And CG/CP stability gets important at fairly low speeds. Remember, with
that van you were driving, you had the friction of the tires on the
road to help keep you stable. With a rocket or a Traveller ship, all
you have are thrusters. So it\'s like steering an airboat.

I think you are underestimating the magnitude of the forces. For one
thing, the reason dirigbles quit being used by the *military* wasn\'t
the Hindenburg accident. It was when in short order we lost two US Navy
dirigibles that got ripped apart by storm forces. They couldn\'t outrun
the storms, and they got mangled.

A starship is likely strong enough that it won\'t get mangled. But
anything that can take a modern airliner and *throw* it 10,000 feet in
less than a minute is something that a starship with CG/CP problems is
going to regret running into. 

Sure, you\'ve got a high thrust to weight ratio (by your assumptions).
But your thrust is along the ship\'s thrust axis. And the winds can
*change* that without warning. The thrusters have to play catch up to
get you pointed back in the right direction. 

You can try to keep your speed relative to the *ground* down to 30 mph
or the like. But trying to keep it to that relative to the *air* is
pretty much futile. There are regions where you\'ll have the wind speed
change by over 100 mph in a matter of yards. And I\'m not talking about
storms. 

Add in storms that you can\'t avoid (without moving fast enough to run
into stability problems) and things like clear air turbulence (that
your ship isn\'t equipped to detect) and it\'s going to be *real* hairy.

I believe the SAFE limit is 100 dT.  Since this is just a toy, you can just slap a
disclaimer on it and let it be unsafe.  However, since it probably doesn\'t have the
range to get it out past 10-100 diameters, you can\'t engage the jump drives anyway.
It does however violate the 2 kL minimum size for jump drives. At  1:100 scale, the
whole thing is only 1.4 liters.

That would be rather large 1:10? Which makes the Scout 3.5 meters long. About the
size of a corvette.

A force exerted on a body will cause the body to move (translate) if
the force is inline with the center of mass.  If the force is not
inline with the center of mass, the body will move (translate) and
rotate about it\'s center of mass.  The rotation is determined by the
moment (force applied times moment arm - perpendicular distance of
the force from the center of mass).

My guess is that the center of pressure is the point at which the
forces from wind are applied.  If this is at the center of mass, the
ship will be moved by the wind, but not rotated.  If it is not at the
center of mass, then, depending on the wind direction, the wind will
rotate the ship.  A center of pressure behind the center of mass means that
forces applied will tend to keep the ship pointing in the right
direction while a center of pressure in front of the center of mass
will tend to cuase the ship to flip around.

This only really matters if the ship is moving and the primary wind
pressure is due to the vehicle moving through the air (which is the
case of a rocket or airplane).  A ship which is moving slowly will
mostly be experiencing wind pressure from wind, not it\'s motion.

Assuming several thousand years of development, I\'m assuming that the
computer would compensate for unbalanced loads automatically.  In space
it makes sense to load the ship so that the center of gravity stays
in the same place or is in one of several places which the thrusters are
designed to work around most efficiently.  Assuming this, the thrusters
would compensate for any rolling.

This stability is only an issue if you\'re flying into the wind and the
forces are with respect to this wind.  If your ship is still or moving very
slow (<50 mph say) then the forces will be due to whatever wind is hitting
the ship.  The stability issue is only when the wind is coming from the
direction of motion and the ship has a preferred direction to fly.

Ceneter of mass (gravity) is the point at which mass is equially
distributed in all directions.  This means that any force through this
point will not rotate the object.  This also means that any offset
force will cause rotation about this point or an axis through this
point.

So CP will vary with the direction the wind is coming from?

Rockets will generally be moving much faster than I\'d expect an

But these strong forces which would move a ship 10,000 feet in a minute
would easily roll a van or toss it off the road.  Not only did that not
happen, but the van stayed in its lane quite easily.

I used the force that you calculated.  I didn\'t estimate it myself.
It ended up being fairly trivial, like .02 G\'s of acceleration on
a big metal plate without even a ship attached to it.  I think that you
are way overestimating the forces and your numbers back that up.

Avoiding bad storms is something airplanes do even today.  I\'m assuming
that anyone flying anything will avoid them.

Well, my assumption is also that starships have some vectored thrust,
both for maneuvering and to compensate for a shifting center of mass.

What is needed to detect clear air turbulence?

Also, any ship or airplaine or other vehicle moving through an atmosphere
is going to have problems with unexpected turbulence and storms.  I\'m
just saying that an unstreamlined ship will be able to operate in an
atmosphere relatively safely, just not as efficiently or safely as a
craft designed for that purpose.

I\'ve recently been designing FF&S1 warships, and when I looked at these I
thought that there had been considerable inflation since CT days (my memory
was that my ships were costing about MCr 1 per ton). However when I did
some serious analysis I found that the inflation wasn\'t as serious as I
thought.

Here\'s what I got (adj price is the list price adjusted for TL & Starport):

Class Disp    TL Price(MCr) Adj Price Price/DT Adj Price/DT
BD    1000000	15 508625.9   508625.9  0.509    0.509

Average                               0.595    0.565

The thing I found interesting was that the expense per ton seems to be most
closely related to the mass of armour as compared to the size of the ship,
though the BB & BCs are thruster ships and the others use HEPLaR, so that
is obviously even more important.

Without giving away too much, I\'ll answer your question with a few of my
own (and no, I don\'t actually know the answers to many of these):




How does one navigate an intercept course that takes you through the tail
of the comet where ice chunks (as big as houses) are hurtling past you?
How slow-moving and small would one of these fragments have to be to bounce
*harmlessly* off of your hull?

Does sunlight striking a comet\'s surface cause (nearly) instantaneous
surface eruptions of gas and whatnot?

How can 8 1 MT nuclear devices (planted 100 metres below the surface) blast
a comet "the size of Mt. Everest" into two dissimilarly sized pieces (about
10%/90%), while only 4 such warheads can blast the larger of the two chunks
(500 billion tons, IIRC) into itty bitty pieces that "will burn up
harmlessly in the upper atmosphere"?

Speaking of which, how can you possibly consider the rise in temperature
involving burning up nearly 500 billion tons of rock and ice in our
atmosphere as "harmless" (not to mention all that water vapour)?

Why would you detonate the first eight nukes when the spacecraft hadn\'t
reached a safe distance yet?

How can a government design and construct a craft like the one depicted in
the movie in less than a year?

Considering the measly 20 second delay in communications between the comet
and Earth at the time of the first nuclear detonation (ie: the eight
warheads), wouldn\'t *any* action at that distance be considered futile?
And why did it take the craft five months to reach this distance with a
state-of-the-art nuclear propulsion system?

How could the individuals chosen for the comet rendezvous be so
undisciplined and cocky (and young) if they\'re supposed to be "the best of
the best"?  Robert Duvall\'s character was the only level-headed character
aboard.

How does one prepare an underground dwelling for *one million* Americans to
survive in for two years in only a year and a half?




Don\'t get me wrong, many of the eye candy VFX shots are accurate, like the
waters receding away from the beach just prior to the tidal wave washing
ashore.  The only cheer that took place during the movie was by yours truly
when we found out that the larger chunk was due to hit somewhere in Western
Canada (a picture of myself holding up a tiny parasol a la "Wile E. Coyote"
quickly popped into my head).

  Given the 30% of 3% guideline, it might be simpler to say that the

  It would require a fair chunk of merchant tonnage to function as
their fleet train if they deployed at strategic range from their
homebases.

I bought Azhanti High Lightning just to plug the hole in my Supplement list.

Since they aren\'t mentioned  in T4 either, I\'m assuming that there is

This is a good idea, but is it really TL 16 ?  I suspect that getting an
operable 1/100 scale Scout/courier would be less than TL 16 as long as
you left out the jump drive and used ordinary gravitics rather than a
thruster plate.  Since these are going to be frightfully expensive toys
I suspect most owners will not try to jump them or send them very far
from their home planets so this won\'t be much of a limit.  In addition
you do not want to let your radio controlled model get much more than
30,000 km\'s away or speed of light lags will raise the risk of crashes
to too high a level.  In addition I suspect that using these things in
deep space would probably violate the Imperial Rules of Space Handling
and might be an Imperial crime.

Maybe Yaskodray made these for his children, I assume he had the TL
required to make tiny starships.  As smaller ships are cheaper, ceteris
paribus, he could have made more of them.

How about marketing real operable 1/10th scale Scout/courier grav cars
to sell to ex scouts.

Is there anyone out their who feels like designing one ?  Note that the
grav car will not have much headroom and might be best designed so that
the operator & any passengers are reclined.


Think about it if the ex scouts are going to be buying a grav car anyway
you might as well try and sell them one shaped like their old ship. 
Since the Scout/courier is an airframe design the scale model of it will
be one as well.  Since Scout ships are ubiqutous Imperium wide you will
not have to spend much, or any, money on a brand recognition campaign. 
If you play your cards right you may be able to get these things
liscensed by the Scout service or (better yet) you could give one to the
Imperial family as a marketing tool.  How many billions would you have
to pay for ads that would get as much air time as the "cute" spot of the
Emperors teenaged child flying her new grav car on the evening TAS news
?

Of course palace security will be having a coronary over the whole thing
but if you don\'t take a few risks as a teenager you are never really
going to grow up [This may have been Emperor Lucan\'s problem.]

Then the company will have no chance of getting back the next starship
that the hijackers steal.  You also risk the lives of that ships crew,
the morale of the crew of your other ships nad a vast ammount of money. 
Would you want to be the person risking _your_ career on the bet that
the authorities would find & punish the criminals.  If you are wrong and
the authorites fail to capture the criminals you may very well end up
fired about 100 nanoseconds after the company learns that the next
starship has been stolen - you have just cost them millions.  Of course
depending on your perception of the cultural norms of the Third Imperium
it may be that letting someone steal your starship and getting away with
it might be somewhat harmful to your companies image.  If Imperial
culture is macho enough it might even be viewed as emasculating.  It
would be a  "Hello. My name is Ingio Montoya.  You stole my starship. 
Prepare to die." sort of thing.

If you are going to play it that way you would be better of hiring a
repo man to get the ship back.  If you are going to be ruthless about
the whole thing it might be easier to just start torturing the families
of suspected hijackers to death until the hijackers realize they would
be better off stealing someone, anyone, elses ships.  [Insert plot
Idea]  I know that if I were running a Mega corp I would want my
entertainment division to run a line of films where the Dirty Harry
esque hero was the repo man who hunted down and killed people who stole
any of my companies starships.  Every film would end with the hostage
rescued and the terrorists dead.  This you make money on the films,
deter theft of your starships, and can film most of the movies on your
own starships providing free product placement throughout the movie.

I don\'t understand that comment. Wouldn\'t that give the forces of Law and

Weren\'t we talking about systems with enough traffic to make a drop tank
operation profitable?

>(non-Jump), a plan, some luck, and the brains to quit while you\'re ahead.

Not quite. We were over all this a few months ago. It\'s true that any
merchant ship that arrives at a system with no military patrol ships
are easy prey to any armed spaceship that is faster than it. It won\'t
have the fuel to escape by jumping and it will eventually be hunted
down. The trouble is that merchant ships are so expensive that it only
takes a single loss to outweigh quite a lot of prevention. So it dosen\'t
take much traffic to make prevention worth while. And in those systems
where prevention isn\'t worth while, the pirate will have to wait months
to get a shot at a victim; months during which his ship is not making
any money.

Hijackers have their own problems, but at least they don\'t have to use a
piece of equipment worth at least 10 times the prospective loot.

Agreed. Much depends, I suppose, on whether or not you believe a ship can
be disguised so much that it cannot be identified again later. I tend to
think not, but I admit that\'s just an opinion. I do think that if ships
cannot be adequately disguised, then captured ships _has_ to be moved to
another jurisdiction and never, ever come back to the original area of
operation. Starships are so expensive that _many_ manhours would be
dedicated to recovering them if such was possible.

Bear in mind that a good food and lodging can be had dirtside for Cr4,800/year.
Life support on a ship is supposedly Cr48,000/year, TEN times as much.

Taxes are not one of the operating expenses of a starship. If starships are
taxed it is through hidden taxes. It does not appear to be berthing fees,
because BFs seems absurdly low (averages out to Cr100 for the first six days
in port). It might be refined fuel (It costs about 5 to 10 credits to refine
a ton of fuel, so the price difference between unrefined and refined fuel
means that someone is making a HUGE profit (Except that unrefined fuel is
always available as an alternative and if refined fuel costs more than
Cr300/T it becomes cheaper for a starship to carry a fuel purifier plant
and refine its own fuel (the saving on fuel cost will outweigh the loss of
cargo/passenger space that the purifier takes up))).

I think Vland has been mentioned as the official home port of one of the
free traders in the Spinward Marches (the EMPRESS NICHOLLE perhaps?)
Somehow I don\'t see Vland as a tax haven, but that\'s just my opinion.

One of the ways I justify the very low Imperial pensions is by saying that
Imperial pensions are not subject to taxation by planetary governments. 
Perhaps the same applies to interstellar ships.

Yeah, we coined the term "Verhoen physics" to describe the various stuff
depicted in the movie. I especially liked to close encounter with asteroid
depiction - the director/scriptwriter shure has a firm grip on gravity

No. But you can figure out that it is very expensive. Figure a child takes
up half a stateroom and use up half the normal life support of an adult.
That will cost you Cr24,000/year for life support and the revenue of half
a stateroom, anything from Cr100,000/year and down, depending on how often
your passenger list is full up. That\'s assuming the spouse is doing the
job of a crewmember. If he/she is deadheading (if that\'s the word I want),
then it\'s costing you another Cr48,000-248,000. If they were living on a
planet, food and lodging would cost Cr2,400/year for a child and Cr4,800/year
for a spouse.

No it still matters if the ship is moving slowly and the wind moves
fast. That will tend to make a "stable" ship point into the wind (known
as "weathercocking" in rockets) and given an unstable ship pushes in
*very* odd directions.

But the computer program for a ship not intended to emnter atmosphere
is going to be programmed to assume that *all* forces go thru the CG.
The wind forces going thru the CP will produce deflection forces that
don\'t act in a way the computer is programmed to handle.

No, crosswinds and updrafts downdrafts can cause problems, *especially*
if they are moving as fast as the ship OR FASTER. And that latter is
just about inevitable in the process of trying to land *slowly* (under
50 mph)

The CP *can* vary (I think), but for most shapes it should be pretty
much the same. The quick & dirty method I gave assumes a wind from the
side (usually the worst case for deflecting forces), and it does
simplify stuff a lot. But I think the CP is generally as fixed as the
CG.

The rocket calculations were for some pretty slow rockets. Definitely
subsonic. And the effects are observable down as low as 30 -50 mph (the
cheap way to test models is hanging them out a window of a car!)

Try it on an icy road. I\'ve seen VW buses flipped and worse, and semis
pulling empty trailer go skating all over the place due to wind gusts.

The airplanes that avoid them are flying at 300 knots. That\'s a *lot*
faster than your "<50 mph". The storms move faster than that.

Some rather specialized sensors last time I heard. And they were to
*attempt* to detect it. Given some accidents in recent history, they
may not have worked. You have to be able to tell that *dry* air is
moving relative to other dry air, and neither radar nor IR get much of
a return off of dry air.

What I\'m trying to say is that you have to *expect* a certain level of
turbulence, and that it will affect the "slow", unstreamlined ship a
*lot*.

I think that it is likely to be about as "safe" as shooting rapids in a
canoe. It can be done, but it requires a lot of experience, and is
better done in a craft more suited to the task (a kayak or a raft).

Some years ago we had a driving student in the prosess of taking his

If this applied to people as well as for ships. Say all those paid by the
Imperial government or by businesses that \'Imperial\' as opposed to
\'Planetary\' in nature Travellers truely become a class apart from their
planet-bound fellows. You would have a whole class of people who are immune
to local taxation and who are paid in Imperial Credits, instead of local
stuff, regardless of the era of your campaign.

This could lead to some intresting business proposals coming the PCs way,
as loacl try to dodge taxes.

That\'s total shipyard capacity (hereafter shortened SC) available to the
government and dosen\'t say anything definite about the civilian capacity
(though I agree that there most likely is some correlation). Consider: By
TCS rules the total SC can lie unsused for weeks and months if you don\'t
have any new construction going on. Then a damaged ship can arrive and tie
up the total capacity for a few months whereupon the ship is fixed and the
SC can lie unused for further months whereupon the government can decide
to build some new ships and get the shipyards going in a very short while,
tying up the total shipyard capacity for the next two years with nothing
left over for annual maintenance or the civilian side of things.

Furthermore, the whole matter of maintenance and replacement of worn-out
ships (as opposed to shot-up ships) is hidden from the player in the TCS
rules.

IMO this can best be explained by a large hidden shipyard capacity (civilian
and naval routine work (maintenance and replacement of worn-out ships)) that
can, in emergencies, expand by a certain percentage (I don\'t know how big
a percentage) and take on unexpected naval work.
 
> Assume the following:
> 40 year lifespan for ships (based on mortgage period)

There are canonical examples of warships that have been in use for over a
century (_Azhanti High Lightning_).

>= 2.5% per year * 2.8 years to build = 7%
>Annual maintenance = 2% of total tonnage

As I mentioned above, all that is taken care of separately and does not come
out the 1T/1000 citizens shipyard capacity.

>New builds and unscheduled maintenance = 1% of total tonnage

Or almost none if there are no unexpected losses, ie. in peacetime.
 
>Using TCS rules you can calculate the naval budget.

Note that this gives a higher figure than using the _Striker_ rules. Cr500/
citizen would correspond to 5% of GWP and wouldn\'t include the army. The
Imperial worlds may only get 3% (in peacetime) and would use a slice of that
on the army.

In what connection? If in connection to surface shipping, then it is
propably not all that applicable to Traveller style space travel. Also
remember that 70% of the money goes to planetary defense and a fairly large
slice of those 70% (between 6 and 40%) goes to the planetary army. Of the
remainder, an unspecified, but IMO very large, part goes to system defenses
which cannot be used to escort ships outside the system.

In my calculations I usually assume 90% utilization on the average.

    'body' => 'Here is a suggestion for some slightly more detailed life support costs that
will allow referees to tailor them to fit individual situations.

REVISED LIFE SUPPORT RULES
==========================

LIFE SUPPORT: Each person living on a starship involves an overhead cost for
food, fresh linen, minor repairs at starports, occasional cleaning, tuning of
various equipment, and other sundries. The cost may vary, but averages out
over time to one of several different levels:

MINIMAL: Cr1,000/month. This entail the cheapest of food, using air and water
filters to the absolute limit, skimping on cleanliness, ignoring many minor
malfunctions, and gradually letting things slide. This can be kept up for
quite a while, but at the cost of letting the ship get seedier and seedier.
No one would willingly live like that unless forced by lack of funds.

BARELY ADEQUATE: Cr2,000/month. Somewhat better food, air and water filters
changed a bit oftener, occasional cleanups, occasional repairs. This is what
some of the seedier tramp freighters get by with, but makes it very difficult
to get passengers.

ADEQUATE: Cr3,000/month. Average food, reasonable cleanliness, repairs as
needed. This is what passengers travelling by tramp liners are resigned to.

GOOD: Cr4,000/month. Good food, filters replaced every trip, high degree of
cleanliness, all broken fixtures fixed asap. This is the level of comfort
expected by Mid and High passengers on regular ships (Except that High
Passengers usually get even better food (see below).

LUXURIOUS: Cr4,500+/month. The difference between Good and Luxurious lies
almost solely in the quality of the food. You can spend almost any amount of
money on food, but the extra Cr500 alone is enough for really good food and
corresponds to what High Passengers expect.

Passengers
==========

Because passengers only stay onboard ships for an average of 8 days or so,
life support costs for passengers are paid per jump and not per month.

True. But you are still avoiding paying both. Standard accounting would
still insist that the live-in owner(s) set aside a percentage as
personal use. 

Note also that under standard accounting the owners salary does not
count as expenses, but as an appropriation from profit. Again, this
makes you profit look even better - though of course you are no better
off - don\'t you just love accounting!?

IMO the Cr4,800 figure is very low.

Actually, with most of the ex-scouts I\'ve played and seen, they\'re more
likely to drive either grav racing bikes, the equivalent of a beat-up
old pickup with three different colored fenders and one missing one, or
the surplus air-raft that came with their scout-surplus starship (which,
come to think of it, sounds an awful lot like that beat-up old pickup
truck...;-)

A 3m wedge streamlined hull actually has a considerable amount of space
in it; check out the design for the military light recon vehicles on my
Infini-V page at

had in mind. I had forgotten that the AHL was considered "semi-streamlined".
It\'s quite obvious from looking at pictures of the ship that it IS NOT
hypersonically streamlined, yet, with risks it can perform fuel skimming.

The point I was trying for was the fact that a ship without the "smooth
skin" apparent in hyper sonic aircraft could scoop fuel and thus the typical
model of a rocket blazing through a GG\'s atmosphere is not IMHO accurate. I
beleive that the process is a slower, dipping action, very dependant on CG.

I have never thought tha an open frame ship (such as the ST Enterprise)
could perform this operation, however a ship of a configuration simalar to
the (ST) Voyager, which is an example of semi-streamlined, could, given
sufficient CG to counteract the GG\'s gravity.

I guess what I\'m really trying to get to is that any streamlined
configuration SHOULD be able to fuel skim, will appropriate additional
risks, and that this should include semi-streamlined hull shapes such as
Box, Sphere and possibly Close configured hulls.

How I have always played it, is that these configurations can skim, at
greater risk the further from and airframe configuration the ship is, but
probably shouldn\'t. Additionally, I typically concider the processing time
for the fuel to be purified, to be the defining factor in how long a ship
stays in atmoshere. My take on it is that the fuel goes from scoop to
purifier, where the none usable elements of the atmoshere are discharged
back into the atmoshere (most likely through a catalytic reaction) and the
usable "light elemental gases" are compressed and stored in the fuel tanks.

If this is not the case than the fuel tankage should be conciderably larger
for a ship using GG skimming. The volume stored in the tanks during skimming
would have to be large enough to produce sufficient fuel after it was
refined, Since the exact make up of each worlds atmoshere is different this
would be a real pain in the a#$ to calculate. Or the ship would have to make
mutiple runs with seperate tanks for "clean" and "dirty" fuel.

The CG of the ship will change depending on how full its tanks are,
cargo load, bits missing in combat, etc. The ship has to be programmed
to cope with this, so it should make a decent attempt at self
correction. Admittedly it would have to react very quickly.

Wouldn\'t a wind effect have the same effect as a thruster firing at that
point (or directly opposite point)?

The program has to cope with thrusters at different positions and angles
from the variable CG anyway, isn\'t this just one more?

Most of the *airframe* ship designs I have seen put most of the mass at
the back - drives, power plant, cargo. These should also have a tendency
to fly backwards!

A Dress (or suit) which is holographic, therefore reconfigurable using
different data chip inserts.

Just remember that the wearer is generally wearing very little underneath
(aside from the holographic projector, with vars. components worn over the
shoulder and on a belt).

Data Chips for the Dress;

- -A colorful \'waterfall\' which divides as the wearer walks, showing a
serious amount of "leg" according to setting.

- -Swirling tendrils of grey smoke, which *just* strategically cover vital areas.

- -A Fabulous gown of scraps of iridescent, airy fabric that lifts and
flutters as the wearer walks.  The pieces of fabric apparently unconnected
to the wearer or each other, but always fulfilling local "decency"
standards (barely).

There is a small (or not so small) problem or two with this dress.
Corrected by the item below.

The Gravitic Bustier; Ever need support but couldn\'t wear a visible garment
where is was needed most?  This narrow belt will project a small amount of
lift right where you need it, and can be worn under even the slimmest of
outfits.

Note that the devices above require batteries, batteries have a tendancy to
run out of juice at inconvenient times.

Other stuff:

ZapperShave; A quick-shaver that uses two lasers; one to measure the range
to your skin, the other to incinerate the hairs at the root.  Better than
an Atra or a Norelco!

StatClean; Place your fine garments in this innocuous looking box and
they\'ll be clean in seconds.  A small device passes a positive static
charge to the garments, leading them to repel small particles of dust and
skin, as well as most stains, a negative charge activates along the inner
surface of the box, pulling those particles away and drawing off the static
charge.

Gal Friday; The latest in handcomp personal assistant software from Ling
Standard Products has all the features you expect; Calendar organizer,
automatic reminder, expense report preparation, contact management, all in
the form of Friday, the holographic personal assistant.  She is projected
in full motion color, and at 25cm tall. is the largest handheld
holo-assistant on the market.  She, of course, still has the voice only
mode for use when having a handheld holographic woman appear might not be
appropriate.  Available with a variety of appearances, voices,
personalities, and sexes.

I stay away from fruit beers except in extreme circumstances, and wrt lemon
beer (such as Pete\'s Wicked Summer Brew).

I had five of a six pack in my fridge of Pyramid Apricot Lager that just
sat there for months...until Lesley Grant (Jo\'s wife, of 101 Cargos and 101
Plots fame) who likes such things came and finished it off, thank goodness.

Hmmm, gives me some cargo ideas.

That\'s why you incorporate, so your salary becomes an expense. The

It all depends on who will be reading the statement\'s prepared from the

For any that are interested, I have both, and with Marc\'s OK am willing

IIRC, in the adventure Broadsword it mentions that Broadsword is on the
planet\'s surface, yet the planet has an atmosphere.  Based on High Guard,
the spherical hull form is unstreamlined.  I would, IMTU, allow any
reasonably designed hull form to make planetfall, but not to "fly" in the
atmosphere.  Just a slow descent and ascent.

If you\'re roughly at rest relative to the head of the comet then the chunks
aren\'t moving *too* fast relative to you (since they\'re just accelerated by
radiation pressure and tidal forces; the big chunks in the tail would be 
moving very slowly.)

>Does sunlight striking a comet\'s surface cause (nearly) instantaneous
>surface eruptions of gas and whatnot?
To be honest, no-one knows. But it\'s a big step for a movie to realize that
comets do outgas in response to sunlight  (whether it should be instantaneous
or not...)

>[comet fragmentation]
Comets are (probably) very loosely held together - their self-gravity is 
weak and they have almost no mechanical strength (about the texture of snow.)
The exact scenario described does sound pretty unlikely, admittedly.

>How can a government design and construct a craft like the one depicted in
>the movie in less than a year?
I don\'t know exactly what it looks like, but I did read that Shoemaker 
suggested an Orion-type, which is a fairly plausible way to get a high delta-V
craft put together quickly. If I had to do it I\'d use the russian core module
being built for ISS, add a habitation module, and put a big Orion plate 
behind it.

>And why did it take the craft five months to reach this distance with a
>state-of-the-art nuclear propulsion system?
It\'s not just distance but velocity - you have to arrive at the same place
as your target at the same velocity, which for a high delta-V object like
an incoming comet is hard. Even an Orion has limitations (especially if
you want to come home afterwards.) Several months is probably a perfectly
plausible delay.

Anyway, except for the very ending, it still sounds like Deep Impact is a 
big step forward in comet movie technology - while Armageddon sounds like
a big step backwards. (The very fact that we\'re arguing about whether the
onset timescale for solar-pumped outgassing or the behaviour of an Orion-
propelled ship are realistic, rather than whether an "asteriod the size of
Texas" (Armageddon) could appear out of nowhere should tell us something...)

Gravity & a garden hose works pretty good, but it STILL takes about 4 or 5

I was thinking along the lines of a plague that has the effect on

Werewolves or Vampires into the traveller setting along with \'Magic\'.
	Think of all the different things you could get a group of
high tech junkies into having to deal with any of these nightmares?
I\'ve used the Vampire like plague before and the players way of 
handling the problem was to Nuke the planet with the problem and shoot
down any escaping ships. Well it worked but that wasn\'t the way I
had planned for them to solve the problem, but players being players
nothing ever goes as planned<g>!
	No as to a system for handling Magic well I was figured
that I\'d treat it like it was three skills.
	
	Magic Control
	Magic knowledge
	Magic Research
	
	Now I use a exp system and I would simple make these skills
into a percent(%) score and the player could add exp points to any
skill to raise their ability. I would base a player\'s starting roll
off their related stats, and then they could increase them as they
went along. Well this is just a idea how to handle this issue, what
I\'d like to hear is if anyone else has tackled this issue? If so
what did they do and etc?

In the same adventure, the ship description for the Broadsword says that
it can land, but only on worlds with Vaccuum or Trace atmospheres.  It\'s
not clear that the adventure writer remembered this (or else they were
too busy getting away from that Zhodani strike cruiser....)  The Keith
illo with the Broadsword grounded is almost certainly set in an airless

David Bischoff wrote two books that I have used as a mini campaign:
Nightworld, and Vampires of Nightworld.  They were set on a planet that was
originaly developed as a resort ala Westworld but with greatly increased
technology, tech 18+.  Due to the inevitable war or political turmoil it
was isolated and the monsters started to live out the roles they were
programmed for.  The world was developed to appear Victorian, ranging from
the 1880\'s to early 1900\'s.

By the time of the books, the monsters had become mostly free willed or
under the will of more powerful monsters.  Vampires, werewolves,
jabberwocks, and dragons were just some of the beasties listed.

I started the game with the players booking passage on a liner on behalf a
noble patron for one reason or another.  As the ship was getting ready for
jump, it is attacked and thus the inevitable misjump occurs taking our band
of heros and monster fodder into a decaying orbit around the planet.

The goal of the campaign was to get home, but after discovering some of the
background, they decieded to stay and sent one of the loyal npc\'s home to
collect the familys and friends and bring them back.  They are still there.

I like this idea that skimming time is derermined by fuel processor through
capacity. For most ships this means that it\'ll take several days, as
opposed to a few hours. It seems more atmosphereic having a ship blundering
through a gas giant\'s atmosphere half blind with the crew\'s stress level
steadily rising with every buffet the ship takes. Even if the task rolls
are no more difficult I think skimming will seem more dangerous if it works
this way.

This also applies to ocean refueling. With the current rules quite a lot of
ships full up in a few hours, and be gone with almost no risk of being
caught on a low pop world. However if they have to sit there for two days
while their purifier churns away things get much more exciting.

  This could imply starport duty-free stores, and a provision for ex-
Imperial services personnel to transport freely goods for personal use,
otherwise they\'d require huge amounts of paperwork to deal with getting
tax credits past the local VAT, if that consumption tax functioned
largely as the income tax.

  Sorry, an extra day to a week for the freighter to forward its itinerary
and manifest (the latter quite possibly incomplete); the higher the traffic
level the greater the chance of a suitable message-carrier being available.

  Yes, I\'m just stating that the conditions discussed shouldn\'t be
operant universally - although from a POV regarding traffic flows
the difference is negligible.

  We\'d best avoid this if we don\'t want to be hunted down by peasant 
villages with pitchforks and torches, buy rather than using a starship,
I suspect that using a small, possibly _very_ cheap spacecraft, for the
odd bit of informal acquisition might be somewhat different. I still
think that the numbers for career piracy are incredibly bad unless you
assume that enforcement is largely impossible and/or a very low priority.

  Yep. And computerised record-keeping can be extremely cheap to run.
Even if you forge papers, eventually the authorities may realize that
the same ship is claiming to be in two places at once; obviously you
issue two search and seizure warrants and start grilling the people
you acquire. The same goes for ID numbers on the truly expensive
components (from HG; PP, J-Drive, maybe the comp - nothing else).

Thunderstorms don\'t typically move very fast, usually something like
50-100 miles per day.  Austin, Texas is about 170 miles from Houston,
Texas.  I\'ve lived in both places.  Weather takes a day or two to
get from one to the other.  Winds in thunderstorms don\'t normally
exceed 30-50 mph at the *most*.  Above that and you have a tropical
storm, a storm of unusually high winds.  Winds of 75 mph and higher
are only found in hurricanes.

Now obviously turbulence can be more violent, but in my personal
experience from flying and the fact that planes generally don\'t
get turned upside down, such violent, random winds are relatively
rare.

This is the only atmosphere of any thickness that we know much
about.

  The alternative to not solving the problem may very well be risking
the entire companies existence as insurers (and thus cargo) and passengers
stay away in droves. What amount of compensation will it take to keep
hijacked passengers from suing or telling their story?

  How many hijacked (or missing, presumed dead) passengers will it take
before the authorities do something? There\'s no question of their being
fired for attempting to solve the crime; rather the opposite.

  Well, I can see pro\'s and con\'s to both informally re-acquiring your
ship, and being the meanest SOB on the sector Main. The bottom line is,
of course, the bottom line, and anything that substantially interferes
with the companies profitability cannot be allowed to persist if it is

Yeah, about 299 Megatons, but it depends on how thick you want the \'hull\' to
be. I don\'t know what the value of rock is as armour, but make it 100m thick
and you\'ve got 153 Megatons of space and a lot of protection from radiation
and stuff.

Er, pass. Seriously though, do you really want a \'sun\' inside your arcology?
You can have UV lights and stuff and plants will still grow (even in a
closet. hehe) You could spin the rock and have induced gravity saving on
grav plates (but limiting internal usable surface area). Docking probably
would be a problem with a thing spinning as fast as it would have to to
produce one G? Any of you physicists out there know how fast it would have
to spin? Maybe artificial G isn\'t such a bad idea, though you\'re going to
have to source the fuel and have a damn good recycling process so you don\'t
run out of essentials.

Digging out my old MT Ref\'s manual thingy I find "A Planetoid can only use
80% of it\'s volume: the remainder is unusable and must be left in place to
maintain structural integrity."
"Buffered planetoids can only use 65% of volume..." This gives Planetoids an
armour value of 50 and the buffered ones 56. Tunnelling out the thing costs
Cr 75 per kiloliter of hull (I assume this means the area you are using, not
the whole thing).

Anyway, sounds like fun, let me know what you come up with :)

      Anson.

  True, but there will be a close correlation between the amount
of traffic and the likelihood of that condition being trivially
easy. Scheduled ships in general can do this effortlessly. A
tramp could quite reasonably fall into the other category.

  Send a launch if necessary. With the ship coming to refuel and
unload prior inspection is only needed if anti-terrorist security
measures are being seriously enacted. Getting hijackers or pirates
to surrender probably comes under the heading of "cease and desist
or cease to exist"; given even modest power for daily functions the
station would still have plenty of loadout for offense and defense
against light units, particularly at close range.

  You do realize that in the real world certain "crimes" absorb
far more resources than makes sense under the oft-repeated (on the
TML, anyway, IIRC I\'ve never run across it anywhere else) model
above; drugs (as in "war on..."), murder, and state security issues.

  Actually, being insured probably is the major qualifaction, certainly
if the real world is any indicator. OC, if these other measures are 
enacted to make you safe then insurance would then be cheap.

   BTW, what other anti-hijacking measures do you propose that would
obviate the need for insurance. They would also appear to presume
that only hostile action results in losses, not accidents or carelessness
of any sort.

  Irrelevant. I certainly require insurance before I ship a box
of Traveller books to Alaska, miniatures to Ohio, or camera gear
up the Fraser Valley. Any business will require insurance on any
unit that represents a significant capital element, unless the
cost of doing so is sizable compared to the perceived risk.

  The Imperium has invented computers, yes? That takes care of most
of the ship records. Inspections and patrols are matters of customs
and internal security.

  "Tamper-proof" transponders are products of the background; I\'m 
fond of the Cymbeline chips, but not the boxes - suggestions about
correcting this problem are best directed to the game developers.

  You do realize that modern commerce isn\'t particularly heavily
regulated relative to our ability to do so, don\'t you? If you
want to see really stifling regulation, try any text on early
modern French internal customs, particularly the reform efforts
towards the end of the 1700\'s (where they documented their system
at length).

  I also don\'t recall anyone saying that any crime would be
impossible in the Imperium, with the possible exception of
assassinating the Emperor, say :)

Tonnage does not equal number of ships. Think of destroyers or even
heavy cruisers and then think of supertankers and you will see what I
mean. Sources indicate that over 70% of cargo ships are large bulk
carriers of some sort. This would imply more military ships than 1 in
10.

After looking up reference sources I find that current earth combat
tonnage to cargo tonnage is more like 1:20 (perhaps even as low as
1:25). Though perhaps this does correlate with a 1:10 number of ships.

>>Total Ship Tonnage in service :  329,594,531,883t
>That seems an awful lot! But it works out as only .026t per citizen. I

Current earth shipping tonnage per person is around 0.005 DT compared to
the postulated 0.026 for an interstellar empire. I find this encouraging
as it is only a factor of five out for what would be a low TL world (say
an average of TL7?) and  this excludes trans-continental road & rail
tonnage.

So the predicted figures look OK, perhaps even low. Though 40% of
current earth tonnage is devoted to fuel transportation that should
almost vanish with the advent of fusion. Also earth ships take
considerably longer than two weeks for the average voyage, so fewer
would be needed.

Does anyone have any figures for the historical growth rate of cargo
tonnage corresponding to earth\'s TL progression? Is it flattening out or
still growing exponentially?

IMO the base cost would be higher and the spread be closer. Say 500
apart. You might want to factor in using cheap labor from poor worlds or
"permanent" working passage labor as well.

T4 rules quote *life support* as an overhead cost of Cr2000 per TRIP per
stateroom. It also says that cargo has no overhead cost, even for
livestock, which can\'t have all that different basic life support needs.
So what this Cr2000 is, unless it is tax I don\'t know. 

The livestock containers cannot be totally self-contained, because the
rules talk about setting the environment on the cargo deck for livestock
transportation. 

Do the crew have to feed & muck-out the animals? I like the role-play
opportunities this presents :)

T4 also quotes an overhead cost of Cr100 per trip per low berth. What
does this represent?

Of course you would want to get an absolute minimum return on your
staterooms after overheads of Cr1000 per DT (i.e. Cr1000 for a low
berth, Cr2000 for a small stateroom and Cr4000 for a large stateroom).
Otherwise just gut the room and take cargo instead.

Note that T4 uses a transportation charges of Cr4000 per ton. So in T4
low berths lose Cr2100 per DT over shipping an equal amount of cargo,
mid-passage loses Cr1000 per DT, and high passage breaks even. Don\'t
even consider large staterooms and rip those low berths out now!

As long as you stick with "classic" gas giants, the main component of
the atmosphere of the larger ones (Jupiter, Saturn) *is* hydrogen.
Smaller ones (Uranus, Neptune) will have rather more hydrogen compunds
(methane, ammonia, water), but still have a *lot* of hydrogren.

The recently discovered "close" gas giants may have a lot more
compounds, but even there it\'s hard to make something that massive that
*isn\'t* mostly hydrogen.

Earth, Venus and Mars are essentially "gas giants with the hydrogen
removed" :-)

Actually, one of the jobs of a loadmaster on cargo planes, and of one
of the officers on a cargo ship is making sure that the cargo is loaded
so as to *not* cause any great shifts in CG! Stability is rather
important. And cargo holds and tankage will be arranged to *minimize*
the effects on the ship. With fuel tanks, you\'ll pump fuel between
tanks to keep things balanced. Though it\'ll be a rare occasion when the
ship is using fuel *that* rapidly *and* manuevering. Maybe while
dodging attacks *and* trying to charge the jump drive.

> point (or directly opposite point)?

Thing is, the CP (which is where the wind forces "appear" to be
pushing) is unlikely to be anywhere *near* a steering thruster. These
will tend to be paired (one on each side of the CG) and as *far* from
the CG as is practical (you get more leverage that way). 

So the wind will be creating a force at a point the computer doesn\'t
expect. And worse, as the ship moves relative to the wind, the force
*changes*. 

Sure, a computer can handle that. But a ship not intended to land won\'t
have the necessary programs. The ones it has, even the ones for
compensating for things like battle damage, will haver built-in
assumptions that are *wrong*. Dangerously wrong.

> The program has to cope with thrusters at different positions and angles
> from the variable CG anyway, isn\'t this just one more?

The computer *knows* where the CG is. And what effects various
thrusters and "possible" external forces will have on the ship. But the
wind forces don\'t follow those rules. And *that\'s* where the danger
lies. 

> Most of the *airframe* ship designs I have seen put most of the mass at

Sure, but being airframe ships, their design partially compensates, and
their computer has a *seperate* set of programs for atmospheric flight.

Note that *any* flight control software for free space *or* for
atmosphere is ship specific, as it needs to know things about the ship\'s
configuration. For both it needs to know the CG, thruster locations and
power, how "steerable" the main drive is, and how the ship is
"trimmed" (and how fast that can be changed). It also needs to know
what sort of stresses various parts of the ship can take. 

For atmospheric flight it also needs to know the CP, location of
control surfaces (if any), what sort of *aerodynamic* stresses various
parts of the ship can take as well as what sort of stresses various
speeds and angles of attack will generate.

The CG info will have a cargo plotting module that the Steward or
Loadmaster or Cargo chief will use to help balance the loading and to
let the program figure the CG shift.

The atmospheric FCS (flight control system) software will be *at least*
special order for non-"streamlined" ships. In many cases it\'ll be
*custom*. That is, you\'ll have to pay somebody to *write* it for you.
Sure, by then there will be a sort of "template" for such, but if the
guy forgets to enter *one* significant factor, or enters an
insignificant one as significant, you wind up in lots of trouble. And
getting the software *certified* is another mess (just like aircraft
now, *nobody* is going to let you use uncertified software to control a
ship!)

Heck, I suspect that there\'s a "borderline" class of ship where *if*
you had the software and some extra instruments (windspeed indicator,
some sort of sensor that can try to sense airflows far enough away that
you have time to react, that sort of thing) *can* land. But it\'s either
an option left off most of them, or the result of an expensive bit of
customizing. 

And all for the ability to take *hours* landing instead of just docking
at the highport. :-)

You can get them in other places. Anyplace that stays damp and moist,
and has "crud" for the yeast to use as food. It turns out that
sometimes when they treat a woman for a yeast infection, they have to
treat her boyfriend too. Men get them, they just don\'t get the

I agree, If you want big open space but "arclights" on top of the buildings
to illuminate the other side of the sphere.

I don\'t remember the formulae, but I do remember that the smaller the
radius, the faster the spin to create 1G, and I think you\'d be better off
using grav plates.  They\'re relatively cheap, as is energy, and a spinning
asteroid hull, unless it was perfectly spherical (probability of which I
will not discuss) there would be some "wobble" that might have an adverse
effect on the inhabitants and/or docking ops.

An occasional discussion of environmental technology on this list has
convinced me that a \'closed\' habitat can be viable with technology
available even at our TL now.  The problem is that it takes a lot of space,
but in this kind of planned habitat that space can be set aside and
optimized.  The one resource that needs to be resupplied on occasion is
water.  The quantity needed is small (since its only due to incidential
loss from accidential ventings of small amounts of atmosphere,
transferrence of mois tinternal air with dry starship air, etc.) but is
definitely there.  A nearby Icy body can provide years worth, assuming the
scale we are discussing.

Everything else, food, oxygen/nitroge/carbon dioxide for atmosphere, waste
recycling, all the environmental necessities are supplied by an internal
closed ecosystem.  Luxuries and other types of supplies are imported, of
course.

So the internal volume becomes (300 Million tons x 80%) 240 Megatons, times
13.5 is 3,240 million Kiloliters times 75 cr/kl= 243,000 Mcr.

I would add to that a few other things; .1G manuver drive (for orbital
correction), a bunch of airlocks, grav plates, inertial comp (which would
reinforce stuctural integrity), I would use three times the base numbers at
the design tech level for self-renewing environmental controls, add a
computer and some sensors (for traffic control), and, of course, a big
whopping fusion plant. (A lot of space can probably be saved by installing
solar panelling, but I am not going to figure out the surface area of the
thing right now).

Using TL14 and my MT Ship Design spreadsheet I get a crew of 163,000 to run
the facility, but that\'s OK because there\'s still about 180 million tons of
internal space left over, even after installing staterooms for the
"Physical Plant" personnel.

A lot of that internal volume is taken up if we visualize the "hollow
inside" type of habitat.  I would suggest that, rather than completely
hollow insides, there is a large park near the center with, say, 100 meters
to the other side of the inner sphere.  That will leave about 700 meters
deep of "Decks" from that point out to the surface of the asteroid for
homes, businesses, industry, More "park" space, ship docking bays, etc.

Altogether a nice place to live.  Lots of industry due to the ready access
to null-G and vacuum, plus the proximity of raw materials (asteroids are
usually found in belts), the ease of approach of merchant traffic (the 100
dia. limit is within walking distance, and probably the nearest GG is
closer too), plus no atmosphere to descend through or suttle down to,
altogether a recipe for success, and all you need is a few hundred million
Megacredits of Capital to invest.

Neither should CG as space time curvature is inside the sgip as well.

Yes, but not the kind you\'re talking about.  My players who were there still
bring up an adventure I ran some 7 years ago, where they were exploring a
tech 6 military base that was on the losing side of a war waged with clean
neutron weaponry.  Everything was silent, abandoned, and creepy.  The CO\'s
skeleton was still inside his uniform, in his chair, in his office, with a
long-evaporated bottle of whiskey on his desk and his service pistol on the
floor, where he dropped it... you get the idea.

By the time they discovered there was an extra elevator shaft going *down*,
they were thoroughly creeped out.  And when something MOVED down there (a
Zhodani war robot; the Zho had been feeding these guys "appropriate tech," on
other words, teaching them how to do stuff with tech 6 resources that is only
obvious in hindsight) even the hardened Marine panicked...

in 1979 and have *all* of the original TAS Journals, including

Traveller, my having all this stuff currently isn\'t doing any of you
any good, and gloating is rather rude so...

I\'d like to offer my services to the TML by providing information on any
original material you all may have an interest in. I\'d be happy to make
copies of any material *which won\'t violate copyrights*. In other words,
I won\'t copy items which are currently in print or are available online,
either at an online store or currently up for auction. I *will* point you to
the store or auction, though. Once the auction is over, though, we can
talk.

However, I\'d also like to offer copies to you, Marc, of any Traveller
material which I have access to and you don\'t. I\'ve about 98% of all
material published since 1977 and can provide info as to what topics
are covered, who wrote what, etc. within a specified publication.

BTW, by "Marc" I mean Marc Miller, not everyone on the TML named
Marc. ;-)

Now, the downside.

1)  I *do not* have a detailed database on my stuff (yet), just a .TXT
file listing of the items. I also don\'t have enough free time to play
Traveller, let alone do intensive research so requests need to be
detailed as to which item you all want info from.

2)  This email was sent from my jobsite but my Traveller material is
at home. Therefore, I can\'t do Traveller research while at work (my
boss won\'t allow it for some reason..go figure). Please do *not* send
any requests to the address on this email. Instead, use my home
email address of:

                          warlock@imagin.net

3)  Although I check my email as soon as I get home, I can\'t
guarantee any time frame. However, if you let me know if your
request is critical for some reason (i.e. you\'re taking part in an
auction), I\'ll jump on it ASAP and give you an idea as to when I
can get it done. Usually I\'ll be able to do it within 12-24 hours.

could hardly ably defend 10 super tankers, not would it make sense for a
battleship to escort 10 free traders.
So we are both in agreement with my statement, as it stands.

I am curious as to what sources you refer to? I have always beleived this
(actually I more believe that 99% of cargo ship, by tonnage, are bulk) but
I was never aware of any explicit references.

Actually if you consider the amount of tankage devoted to fuel on a
starship they are still hauling a lot of fuel around the place! But, yes,
that\'s kind of different.

Actually, I play weekly in two different games on IRC and its 
wonderful.  It helps to be on the same server to avoid most lag 
problems. 

There are at least three games going on IRC that I\'m aware of and I 
know someone who is planning to start a fourth in a few months.

Others have given, I think, the "T4" answer.  I will give the "DGP" answer
(from the Starship Operator\'s manual, a Megatraveller volume).

AFAIR, Thruster plates are mounted in the direction of *most efficient*
thrust.  Thruster plates could be used for "off axis" thrust, but they
would only be able to provide a percentage of their rated thrust.  Directly
opposite the design directiont the capacity was 10% of rated thrust.  I
believe that 90 degrees off axis was 40%, but I may not remember that
number perfectly.

Many ships, like the Subsidised Merchant, have a vague resemblence of a
lifting body, and presumably can land like a not-particularly well designed
airplane with a 1G drive oriented towards the tail of the craft.  However,
on a planet with 1G of gravity, they would not be able to "hover" over
their landing plot like a helicopter.  In fact, they could only behave like
a Vertical Takeoff or Landing (VTOL) craft by either standing on their tail
(which presents a few problems) or on planets with 40% or less of Earth\'s
gravity.

I wonder how feasable it would be to approach in a airplane-like manner,
kill all velocity as you approach the landing area, transitioning to a
"tail-stand" landing approach until all velocity is killed, then, 3 feet
above the tarmac, execute a \'flip-down\' landing on the landing gear.  I\'ve
always felt that there are "attitude thrusters" placed around the nose,
these could aid in keeping the nose gear from collapsing when such a
manuver is performed (in fact, I\'ve always thought they were just "reaction
thrusters" using L-Hyd for mass, so there would be this big cloud of vapor
spewing out the bow thrusters as the nose of the ship came swinging down
towards the landing apron).

It\'d be quite a thing to watch anyway, especially with, say, a ten-thousand
ton freighter doing the landing.

Just follow the FFS rules for asteroid hulls, and build a non-jump,

The real-word name is LIDAR; older Traveller editions sometimes used LADAR,
but in FFS2 we finally got tired of this misnomer and started calling them
LIDAR. The two words refer to the same thing. The masses/costs/etc. for
LIDAR/LADAR also changed in FFS2 as part of the whole reworking of the sensor
rules.

I can fail.  Clearly there is no "certain" way to do a
hijacking (if there were, every ship would get hijacked).
However, it is possible.  Even probable if you look at
history.  They don\'t know you are going to kill them,
and it isn\'t certain you will, and even if they were
pretty sure, most poeple will still cooperate to 
avoid getting killed now.  (This is why Nazi Concentration
camp inmates didn\'t all rust the fence.)

I don\'t see this.  Being on a schedule doesn\'t mean that
a ship is leaving two days before you.  (Unless you
are on a world where ships are leaving, without delay,
every day or so to every possible destination).  This
will occur on only the larger worlds.

Requiring more costs.  And of course, you have to make sure
they just can\'t take the inspector hostage to demand fuel.
Or hold a gun in his back while he radios "all OK" to the
station.  And even if you have them dead to rights, you
have the problem of them deciding to blow the inspector
(and the station if it\'s not guarded) away and trying
to escape in system (criminals do things like that..)

Not all crimes.  Some crimes get politicized and garner 
disproportionate resources while other languish.  One
could assume that hijacking is one of these.  However,
that would be just that, an _assumption_, that doesn\'t
prove they can occur.  In anycase, this wouldn\'t work
forever because political winds shift and a crime that
was high profile in one period is not in another.

All being insured means is that the money you spent for insurance
exeeds the potential losses times the probability of loss.  If
hijackings are uncommon, then this amount of money could well
be less than the measure you propose to eliminate it all
together.

I think tracking them down later when they try and sell the
ship would be be biggie?  So would shipboard security.  (Both
anti hihack programs and making sure nobody caries weapons
on board).

The invention of computers doesn\'t make record unfakeable (it
may do the opposite) and it doesn\'t make the communications
needed to cross check them easier.

And spending money on every possible inspection and patrol

Transponders are.  I don\'t know if they are explicitly
tamperproof.  If they are, that is pretty unrealitic.
Besides they are a later addition that was symptom of
simply assuming everything everywhere must work like
we in our Western society have decided to make them work.

Well, I have never argued anything except that it was
possible.  I have made several references to the fact
that I agree the piracy and hijacking can\'t be too
common...

For the record...

NASA has a program to find, catalog, and track asteroids that
have orbits that cross the Earth\'s.

For comets, it is not clear the the costs of a program
to do something about them is worth the low risk.  There
are proposals to have a rocket sitting ready on the 
launch pad in case a comet comes, but that is certainly
excessive.

T4\'s answer to Trillion Credit Squadron.  I\'ve found it useful in the PE gaming
I do, but not really with the general Traveller Campaign, although it does
provide some nice overview.

I don\'t have this one - didn\'t really plan on getting it until I heard IG went
down.  Now I\'ll get it to complete the collection.

NAM - only worthwhile if you will be doing your own deckplans.

I use it to flesh out the campaign with vehicle descriptions.  Has some
problems, but nothing that can\'t be overcome with a little GM initiative and
speculation (i.e. make it up as you go)

If you are only going to get 2, Emperor\'s Vehicles and Imperial Squadrons would
be the ones I suggest first.

  {
    'body' => 'Hello, All,

My name is Andy Gibson and, although I have been lurking here for a
while this is the first time I have posted.

This message is just to introduce myself and my campaign to you and to
make a couple of observations on the "Investments in the Imperium"
thread. I am particularly interested in this thread for reasons which
will become obvious when I explain the game I am running.

I am a chemical engineer by training but at the moment I am working as a
production/supply planner for a Group that makes and ships around 500
ktes a year of chemical product. I have played various roleplaying games
since about 1977 (first played Traveller in 1979), including sci-fi,
fantasy, historical, horror and superhero games, diced and diceless,
tabletop and LARP (when it was first starting out). I live in the north
east of England.

My current campaign is based in the Traveller "Milieu 0" universe and in
"Active Traveller Campaigns" parlance looks like this:

Location:  England, especially the north-east.
Founding date:  Somewhere around last new year, I suppose.
Group size:  Total 8 - 3 "younger generation", 5 "older generation" -
see below.
Number of referees:  1
Health:  Just starting out but looking good so far...
Predominant rules system:  Variant task system in T4-ish.
Campaign location:  Sylea, heading out into Fornast Sector
Campaign time:  Imperial Year 0 - 1
E-mail contact:  AndyGibson@yarm.demon.co.uk

The game is about an Imperial noble family which is, for various reasons
not entirely of its own making, not in Cleon\'s "charmed circle". I am
using Pocket Empires extensively and the family ("House Denesaar") has
decided to move into the Gashda (Fornast Sector, in fact) to seek a
better fortune.  The PCs are all memers of the noble house. The "older
generation" is being played by folk who live some way away and are
involved in making strategic decisions and diplomatic missions etc.
Local players play the "younger generation" and get to do all the dirty
work :-)  I was originally going to roughly sketch the family\'s
Federation/Imperial holdings and handwave my way to a set of starting
assets drawn from the PE tables, but now my players and I are more
attrated to the idea of fleshing out the actual process of uprooting
such a major concern and moving it into the wilds. This is why I am
interested in the "investment" threads.

I have roughed out a generic "investment" system designed to allow
investment in worlds and trade routes and to work in Resource Units (a
PE concept). I have worked on a 10 percent base return because tax has
to be taken into account and the rates of return so far quoted as
acceptable (4-5%) have been after tax if we take the real world as a
model. I have also considered treating each corporation as a corporate
government with a 20% "tax" level (itself taxed, as this is not the
world government) on all employees and required investment of twice the
combined income of all employees.

In general I think the best approach will be to work on simply paying
for a ship outright and running it for profit.  If this works out to
give a decent return all the other financial stuff will work itself out
one way or another - but the activity (in this case interstellar trade)
must be basically worthwhile to occur. The internal rate of return for
the ships in the T4 "Starships" book vary widely:

Free Trader           9%     (26%)
Far Trader           -2%(!)  ( 3%)
Secure Trader        -2%(!)  ( 4%)
Subsidised Merchant  13%     (43%)
Subsidised Liner      0%     ( 5%)
Large Armed Freighter 6%     (27%)
Luxury Liner          4%     ( 4%)

Figures for freight rates of 1000 Cr/te (4000 Cr/te).  A figure of ~15%
IRR would be required to be attractive.  As you can see a "Secure
Trader" is far from secure and a "Far Trader" will not get very far!  At
4000 Cr/te, however, it is hard to see why a Subsidised Merchant needs
to be subsidised...  It seems to me that this is strong evidence for
differential freight rates depending on safety and length of route.
Alternatively perhaps the designs in Starships! are so non-optimal as to
make these rates meaningless??  I have assumed (a) 100% full holds and
cabins and (b) refined fuel because if (a) were not so the ships would
go to another route unless they *were* subsidised and (b) makes little
difference, especially if refining takes any extra time. Also assumes 25
trips per year (perhaps a little low with refined fuel).

Well, sorry to have rambled so long.

Cheers,

Andy

Local geography can have a tremendous effect on these values.  I am also a
pilot, and I have been stationed at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs for a
total of four years now.  I have personally witnessed winds in clear air at
ground level in excess of seventy knots (tents blown away, antennae and
trees knocked down, etc.) on one occassion, and one or two incidents of
winds in excess of 50 knots every year - not including thunderstorms.  One
of the very few airline accidents in the past 25 years still listed by the
NTSB as "unsolved" occured at Colorado Springs airport: a 727 on short
final simply rolled completely over and crashed.  The black box was an
older type, and could only confirm the facts without giving an clue as to
why.  Best guess is a "horizontal rotor vortex" (I think that\'s the term) -
a volume of clear air turbulence that rolls like a giant log off the
mountains - that literally flipped the plane over when it was too low for
the pilot to recover.

I have also witnessed winds in excess of 110 knots on the ground on several
occassions in 1991 in Germany - the trees looked like they had been combed
flat, all in the same direction.  Fortunately, this followed a similar
incident at Fort Hood, Texas, that destroyed almost a billion dollars in
Apaches and Chinooks, so that we were in the habit of hangaring our
aircraft every weekend, or when the weather forcast called for any high winds.

Wind speeds on Mars, by the bye, can typically exceed 300 knots at ground
level, but are so thin that the fines barely move.

Ok! OK! :)

Stuart Dollar runs a game on Sunday nights, 8pm Central on Undernet. 
We usually use Springfield, but the server must have suffered a 
serious crash and has been down for some time. We have been using an 
alternate server that is not connected to IRC at large. Email me for 
details if you\'d like to lurk.  My husband might be looking for 
another player or two that are serious about playing regularly.

JD Burdick runs a game on Monday nigts at 7:30pm Central on the 
aforementioned alternate server.  This game has run for over a year 
and has only missed three or four sessions. At present there are no 
openings in this game.

Commander X runs a game, I believe on Tuesday nights and again on the 
alternate server (anyone spot a trend here? :> ).  I don\'t have many 
details on this one, but the game is centered around the mysterious 
Planet X and reports have it that it is more tech/gear-head oriented 
than the other two.

I have no details at present regarding the forth-coming game other 
than I will be running a quasi-NPC behind the scenes for it.  Feel 
free to email me your interest and I\'ll try to put you in touch with 
the GM.

Again, feel free to email me on any of the above or for more 
information about gaming on IRC.

This is correct. So far they\'ve identified about 5% of the possible

If the \'standard rate of profit\' is 10%, then the interest payments on your
average starship mortgage are going to be a lot higher.

Most people assume the Imperium doesnt directly tax income - how the
Imperium actually raises revenue is an interesting question (me, I think
they invoice planetary governments, and own large chunks of
megacorporations. I think to become a Limited Imperial Corporation you have
to cut the Imperium a block of non-voting shares). 

I\'d be interested in how you quantify interstellar trade - my GUTTT system
basically works from bottom up, and says for every Cr1000/dton you can make
on a run on average, 1% of the smaller planets economy will be dedicated to
that trade. Then I toss in higher-value cargoes than \'vanilla\' Traveller
supports (which leads to *very* long trade routes), which have relatively
smaller GDP impact (but trade with 20 planets of 0.2 percent of GDP impact
each turns into a big chunk of GDP).

The idea of rating Corporate interests on a planet as a planet for PE
purposes is interesting - to extend the idea, you could also have culture
etc ratings for each company.

Yes. The theory with a Far Trader was always it would go broke shipping
freight but it could make more profit than a jump-1 ship could shipping
speculative cargo (imagine two worlds 4 parsecs apart where you have a
expected specualtive profit of Cr 3000 per dton. A jump-1 ship gets a
revenue of Cr750/jump, a jump 2 ship Cr 1500/jump).

Frankly, I find fixed freight rates silly. Do you have a copy of Hans\'
Freight and Passenger table ?

Actually, a freight system that took into account the merchant\'s skills
would be nice.

>Alternatively perhaps the designs in Starships! are so non-optimal as to
>make these rates meaningless??  

Yes. Starships, as a product, is one of the reasons IG went broke. Their
quality control was just too inconsistent.

This about cancels out with 90% of capacity and 30 trips a year, which you
can easily do if you have agents on planets with warehouses to store cargo
until shipment.

How do they know how many they haven\'t found?

This reminds of the quote:  90% of computer security penetrations
go undetected.

I\'m thinking:  how do they know how many go undetected if they
haven\'t detected them?

Although the text says "4000" per  ton, the ship revenues 
table on page 113 says 1000 per ton. I\'m not sure which one 
is the typpo, but I\'m guessing the text.

Speaking of T4 typo\'s are the ship prices in there for 
real? 21 Mcr for a scout/courier?

You will have to check two other sources to find this out.  Emperor\'s
Arsenal details a few new combat rules, including autofire.
Guns!Guns!Guns! by BTRC, however, has a Traveller conversion section that
is far more complete.

In essence, use the following chart:

Rnds/Sec    Rnds/turn     Damage     ROF DM   Weapon Type
   4-          <30         1.5x        -1
  5-10        30-60         2x         +0
 11-20        61-120       2.5x        +1
 21-50       121-300        3x         +2        RF
  51+          >300         4x         +4        VRF

Autofire is based on a /sustainable/ ROF.  If a weapon runs out of ammo
during a six-second combat turn, it is not reloaded to get a higher ROF
(eg: a machine pistol that empties its 32 round magazine in 2 seconds still
fires at an *average* ROF of 5.33 rounds per second *during a six-second
combat turn*, for a +0 autofire DM).

Companion piece to PE.  War rules based heavily on Fifth Frontier War,

Nice deckplans, but some of the text is non-canonical or just odd.. like
putting ship gunners in clear blisters for visual (!) aiming.  This isn\'t a
book of complete ship plans, but elements.  Good for mining ideas. 6 out of
10.

>		Emperor\'s Vehicles

Not worth it.  The vehicles are so thinly described and poorly done it\'s a
joke.  They don\'t even have the tech level listed!  Not even worth getting
for the completeness factor.

How bad are The Annililik Run and Emperor\'s Vehicles?  If you must have
them, send me your address and I \'ll *give* you mine.  This from the guy
who grins at Traveller auctions because I already own most everything.

I have had a charecter on a ship that other [foolish] charecters took
into jump space from the inside of a pressurized bay on the planets
highport within .1 diameter of the planet.  They did this while
attempting to chase down another scout ship which was doing the same
thing.  But wait, it gets worse.

They put this ship into jump space inside the high port

_while_there_were_people_on_the_hull_of_the_ship_.

Fortunately for them the GM was using MT rules which, as written,
provide a drastic penalty for jumping within 10 diameters but do not
impose any further penalty for jumping from within 1 diameter, or within
0.1 diameter, or while in atmosphere.  They also state [SOM] that the
jump bubble forms 1 to 2 meters from the hull.  All the players on the
hull made their Dex rolls not to be cut in half by the jump field and
then came abord the ship as if nothing had happened.  My charecter was
the ships Engineer at the time (with good skill in Engineering, some
skill in Physics, and a high Education).  I could _not_ persuade the
other charecters, or the other players, how mind numbingly dumb they
were.  We came out of jump just fine, 14 days and 29 parsecs later,
IIRC.  This only encouraged the players to try further reckless
misjumps.

Just FYI, that would still violate copyright laws, or to be more
precise,that a copyrighted work is not in print or available online or otherwise,
does not give anyone the right to reproduce or otherwise the copyright
of the owner of such a work.  These factors are also not reflected in
the Fair Use doctrine.  So, you would have no defense.

Having said that, your generosity is welcomed.

I think you must be right.  (Good idea with the non-voting shares.  This
seemsreasonable since you the block of votes could be a very low percentage
but you make it up on volume of corporations.  Then, literally,
\'What\'s Good for Zhunastu Industries, Is Good for the Imperium.\'

It seems to me that the Imperium could probably work on a basis similar to
the United Nations, in terms of funding.  All member states pay a percentage
of their Gross National Product (might actually be Domestic, I\'m not sure).
The percentage is the same for all members.  Since the Imperium works on
a similar principle, i.e., not directly governing member states but the spaces
between the stars.

I never have seen _any_ MT stuff.

If someone would graciously post or send me the stuff on law school

    'body' => 'Follow-up to my previously posted message (See below) to answer questions
that were asked by most everyone that responded.

FIRST - The Software

1.  CU-SeeMe software allows people with a camera "broadcast" live images
over the net and be displayed by ANYONE on the reflector.  People who are on
just watching are caller "Lurkers" but any and all can type (chat) live and
everyone will see that.  You can also use a sound card and attach a
microphone and speakers/headset to do live voice.  This eats up a tremendous
amount of bandwidth and slows things down pretty bad.  The key is everyone
can see what I broadcast with my video and every can chat at the same time.
2. ICQ is a little program that lets you know when another person that also
uses ICQ gets on the I-net and you can send notes to them individually.  I
want to use this as a supplement to CU-SeeMe and possibly (if we have no
choice) a back-up means of communication.
3. Both pieces of software are free.
4. I have a very high speed line (cable modem) so I won\'t see much lag from
the players.  It\'s possible that the players will see some lag from me
because I\'m sending a great deal of bandwidth but generally if there is NO
change in the video that frees up the bandwidth and things will go pretty
normal.

SECOND - The Game
1. My intent right now is to use TNE (maybe T4) character generation in a
pre-rebellion CT/MT setting (just after the 5th FW).  The exact area is
still being decided but it will wind up in Zho space (passing thru the
Marches).  This keeps the TL up to 14/15 (which I like) and there is plenty
of published material available for any and all who still have it (I can
provide some).
2. I will put up a list of character professions/abilities that I need for
this assignment and the players will roll their own, bring one from another
campaign, I\'ll roll it for you, well you get the idea.  Final players will
get my seal of approval (just to keep some game balance) and we will head
out.
3. This is a subsidized adventure and a ship with NPC will be provided by
the sponsor.
4. Standard weapons and some combat materials will be provided also.
5. Initial setup will be done thru E-mail and I will keep records on my end
for the player characters.
6. Most other functions and the bulk of the record keeping will be
accomplished by the players.

The response was much larger than I first anticipated and if their are other
GM\'s who would be interested in running a game using this format please
contact me and I will help get you started.  There are a number of benefits
by doing it long distance:
1. Propping your feet up while you sip your suds and you don\'t have to drive
home afterwards.
2. Don\'t have to get the dining room table cleaned off to run the game.
3. No SPECIAL house cleaning for your guests (my wife likes this one, she
bought me the video camera when I explained how it would work <BG>).
4. You can keep secrets easier and not get that "I\'ll do what Joe\'s doing"
from a player that thinks he/she might have missed a hook that someone else
caught. (I especially hate this one)  This makes for better balance in my
way of thinking and it makes the players declare things much better.
5. You can have subplots running with players without getting someone else\'s
nose in it.
6. NPC\'s are easier to use in ALL ways.

I\'m sorry for intruding on the TML again but I put this back up because of
the type and quantity of the responses.  The Traveller world needs to get a
larger following.  I hope no one gets too upset.  I believe that this will
be my last post on the subject.

As always, please respond directly to me in private E-mail
thomharr@mediaone.net and I will do my best to reply to everyone.  To those
who have already replied, I hope this answers the initial questions you had
and will help you make up your minds whether to play or not.

Congratulations Steve!  I have the books for TNE and it isn\'t a large
write-up, I\'ll see if I can type it in for you or maybe someone who REALLY
can type has already done this I won\'t have to.  Let me know at
thomharr@mediaone.net and I\'ll see what I can do.

Asteroids can be assumed to be uniformly distributed in certain ways
(for example, spread out in azimuth around the sun); they\'ve examined
5% of the space in question deeply enough to be sure of seeing most
asteroids above some size threshold.

(For example, if asteroids were stationary and distributed over the
whole sky, you could think you\'d found 5% of them after you\'d imaged
5% of the whole sky.)

The real situation is more complicated because asteroids move, and
come in different sizes and albedoes, so you have to do some clever
statistics from the ones you have found - but unlike computer security
penetrations asteroids are well-behaved, generally. (For example, if
you want to know how many faint ones your wide-area survey is missing
you spend a longer-than-normal time staring at one small patch of sky
so you can see fainter objects.)

If the assumption of relatively uniform distribution is wrong, of
course, the 5% estimate will be wrong - there could be a zillion
asteroids with Military Ultrablack hulls on highly eccentric orbits
currently all piled up around the south celestial pole 20 AU out -
but it\'s unlikely.

I\'ve still got the original 3 books of Striker, but *not* the coverless one or
the errata sheet.

And it *wasn\'t* early signs of rampant gearheadedness, it *WAS* gearheadedness
to the maxx.  Looking it over & comparing it to MT, I can see where they got
the ideas for vehicle design for MT from...

Yes, I know. Especially since overheads (including bounty and such on
skippers) will have to be covered by any finance outfit as well. I
reckon about 1/84 rather than 1/240 per month for 40 years would be OK,
except that the ship owners would never make money...

TCS seems to say that they take 30% of each planetary governments tax
income. This is in ca. 1100 TI, of course, so I don\'t know how
applicable it is to other eras. If interworld trade and starship liens
*are* tax free it would make a big difference, but would still require
more "raw" profit to allow for overheads.

A better method IMO is to make one roll for each shot.  If you have alot of
dice, it\'s not a problem at all.  Is there any purpose to recoil in the T4
rules (i wouldn\'t know since I don\'t use em). If not, put a modifier based on
recoil. Therefore single shots have a greater likelyhood of hitting, but a
burst has a better chance overall (collectively).

Those civilian carreers (among others) are from TNE, not MT.  He added those

  Thanks, but the bar comes comes in July.  All I\'ve done so

Still, I thank you and the rest of the TML crew.

First off, I have no idea what\'s been said in cannon since all I ever
played was the original LBB traveller and I don\'t have much of a head
for trivia.  Given that, here\'s some ideas...  feel free to ignore
them:

1.  The easiest way for the Imperium to tax is to assess some tax on
each world or system and let them collect it however they want.  This
maybe a per capita tax, GNP tax, and/or a resource tax (10% of all
the tungsten mined or something like that).

2.  The next easiest would be some kind of VAT or sales tax.  Assuming
the Imperium is basically capitalist, taxing consumption is better for
the economy (it encourages people to save money, making more money
available for capital investment) it is also easier to collect since
it doesn\'t require anyone to report any income and doesn\'t try to
keep track of every penny everyone in the Imperium earns, it just
collects a percentage of each purchase.

I suspect that #1 is more likely given that the Imperium doesn\'t run
worlds, but #2 might be in place in starports and/or other Imperial
territory.

The problem comes in at what do you get out of doing it (apart from a warm
inner glow from doing your Imperial Duty, and two tickets to the Subsector
Duke\'s Annual Ball), or when you have to sign over the equity.

Now, we seem to know that tramp starships dont have to cut Uncle Cleon in
for 5%, so presumably it doesnt apply to all off-planet corporations.

The simplest method is to get one of the lawyers on the list (*hint*) to
come up with a form of words that forces every entity owning 2 or more
starships to cut the Imperium in for 5% of net profits. Data analysis on
starport route and declared cargo records can indicate when someone is
trying to dodge tax, although I\'m not sure they\'d worry with 200 dton Far
Traders.

If the Imperium doesnt have the problmm of one very big, very well-armed
member state disputing rulings it doesnt agree with, claiming it\'s ownn
laws have extra-territorial reach and refusing to pay it\'s bills on time,
then this isnt a problem. Except of course if some planetary government is
understating it\'s planets income for tax purposes (I can see all sorts of
fun and games after some schmuck Emperor agrees that certain expenses
should be tax-deductible). Hmmmm. Now *thats* a scenario for nobles ...

It\'s a DM for you to *miss* on your next shot if you try to get one off really

	As far as I know the imperium taxes domains, domains are taxing
	subsectors, aso. MegaCorporations and free traders can become taxed
	when leaving the extrality zone. Which is sometimes 100 diameters
	and sometimes sqaremiles free trading area around the downport.
	Megacorporations are of course more lucky than free traders as
	they own funds of imperial stock, and vice versa.

	I\'ve also done a trade router, send me a subsector in either DGP
	or GAL format, and you receive a list of lucrative and subsidary
	routes.

	The problem is that a tramp frighter is\'nt realy designed to
	live from subsidary trade. So it can not compete in the MCr/Jump
	price. Most tramp frighters also can\'t live from the typical
	MerchantPrince+KnigthFall rules. Think about that 200dt frighters
	are more like a yacht with cargo room than like a real economy
	horse. The crew has to be something special to bring it on profit.

Ahzhanti High Lightning is a GDW 1981 boardgame that is essentially a
humumgous version of Snapshot. They are both man to man combat games that take
place inside spaceships using 1.5 meter squares, and the mechanics are a more
detailed version of those found in Classic Traveller books and Mercenary (book
4). AHL comes with 14 large deck maps, counters, Supplement 5 (a history of
AHL cruisers and their mechanics), a rulebook, and a sheet of weapons data.
The ship is 60,000 tons displacement, and supplement 5 states that the ship
has 84 decks. It lists the desks in order, and tells you what type of deck map
to use. BTW the ship has its\' decks perpendicular to the direction of thrust,
so think of it as a skyscraper-put her on her ass pointing "up" and the people
will appear walking on her decks normally (90% different from most ship
plans).

Striker is a set of miniatures rules that are compatable with Traveller. The
scale is 1mm to a meter, and each vehicle, and heavy and support weapon model
represents one real one. Each model figure represents one person, and are
mounted on four figure 1inch square fireteam bases. Elite troops like recon
scouts, officers, and of course PC\'s (player characters) can be mounted
individually. The rules emphasise command control (command points, chain of
command, etc.), and have a great section on designing vehicles. This unlike
TCS, and HG (Trillion Credit Squadron,High Guard), has volume (14m3=1
displacement ton) and weight (metric tons). I suspect that this is the
grandfather of FFS (Fire, Fusion and Steel). There was a Striker II printed as
part of the TNE (New Era) series. It has TOE\'s (table of organization and
equipment) for units, and scenarios that Striker lacked. The game mechanics
use the Command Decison (WWI,II,80\'s WWIII) miniatures rules that GDW
decided would be their "house rules".

	I\'ve got a newspaper article dating back from before Milstar was
launched ... somehow this guy got hold of one of the high-powered
amplifiers, and was trying to hook it into his company radio system!
The OSI descended on him like a load of bricks when he contacted
Hughes to try to get some schematics and specifications. According to
some experts, if he\'d managed to get it working, he\'d have knocked
most radios & TVs off the air for a fairly large radius.

	I started to create a magic plug-in for the MT and TNE Task Systems
a while back, but lost my gaming group. Basically, I figured that
magic was an Impossible Task, modified by relevant magic skill and a
"Degree of Difficulty" for a given spell. The relevant characteristic
was "Mage Gift," and the degree of difficulty for a given spell
depended on various factors. Being a gearhead, I was basing my ideas
on the book "Fantasy Wargaming" which contains a fairly coherent,
detailed magic system. Different areas of magic included elemental
magic, energy magic, life magic, command, and divination
(Foresight/Farsight/etc.)

What you want to look for is "The Regency Sourcebook" by GDW for Traveller,
The New Era.  While it is TNE,a nd their are many changes, it is by far the
best place for collected data on the Marches, Deneb, and the other two
sectors that make up the Domain whose names escape me.

  For your edification, we presnt the possibility that this could be a

the evil Imperial authorities to help ensure capture intact for their

That\'s for NPCs, the work-a-day stiffs.  I was kept busy with;

   * currency speculation 

      Geee, who could have expected that awful tourist 
      problem on ZZZZZ?

      Damn, we knew that the trade-war between StarDreams
      and SleepyStars was going to be tough to control.
      If only we\'d gotten there sooner, we might have 
      able to buy off the mercenary contingent with
      options on the SleepyStars shares...

   * purchasing agent

      Yes, indeed, the standard fee for starship acquistion 
      on YYY is 3% of the cost of the ship.

      You know, it\'s a good thing he didn\'t tell me at the 
      start what he really wanted.  I would have told him
      the 1% rate that is a bit above average for

      You know, my Lord, when you invited me along for
      some very important negotiations, I thought they 
      involved the mining contract.  With the location
      of the mining colony, working out payment and
      bonds for the security aspects of this partnership
      was going to keep me tied up for most of a week.
      How long have you known that an Aslan second son 
      was going to claim the entire third continent for
      his own?  And that we were going hunting with 
      him?  Unarmed?



Any differences between this rendition and what happened during the
campaign may be blamed on loose case or morals brought on by
complemplating multiple LBOs simultaneously. :-)

I bet it\'s because of the demise of IG.  I remember when GDW folded, the
used games section of my local game store was flooded with all things GDW.
The same thing happened in the past few months:  the shelves are full of
used T4 stuff.  It\'s been sitting there for quite a while.

You\'d think it would be the opposite: that there\'d be a run on whatever
material is left.  Ah, well.

Being a gearhead, I was basing my ideas

I wonder if we\'re thinking of the same "Fantasy Wargaming" book - 
the one I have has a magic system that basically says, "wizards from
mythology don\'t have spell books. What they want to happen, happens".
The rules had the wizard say what effect he wanted, the GM pulled
a difficulty number out of his hat, then the player hunted around for
mystic signs, times of day, astrological sign-related stuff and such
to get the difficulty level down. It had plenty of details and coherency
in the astrological sign info (probably cribbed from any $2.00 new ager
star sign book), but the rest of the magic system had about as much 
substance as the Emperor\'s New Clothes.

It was very strange to see a Fantasy RPG that spent so much time
bitching about how unrealistic all the other games in the genre were... :)

Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram
The H-R diagram compares the brightness of a star with its temperature.
The diagonal line running from the upper left to the lower right is
called the Main Sequence. Stars lying on the Main Sequence are blue when
they are bright and red when they are dim. Stars in the upper right
(called Red Giants) are very bright, but still appear red. Stars near
the bottom (known as White Dwarfs) are white, but not very bright. This
diagram was developed independently by Ejnar Hertzsprung, a Danish
astronomer, and Henry Norris Russell, an American astronomer.

Luminosity class I is at the top of the chart and Luminosity class V is
at the bottom. Spectral classes are listed at the top.  As you move from
left to right within a spectral class the digit tells you how far.  So a
K0 would be a typical K class star while a K5 would be half way between
K and M.

    This is not a personal advertisement!  I don\'t get a kickback or
anything like that.

    I have been ordering a whole lot of out of print Traveller items from
this company and have had really good results.  He has most of the LLB\'s
(1-6 anyway) in stock all the time and great many items from the old
publishers, i.e. "The Judges Guild", "GDW ", "Paranoia Press", etc.  The
owner responds right away with order confirmation but unfortunately doesn\'t
take credit cards.  Even so, I usually have my items within two weeks from
placing my order.  He also has a number of the "Imperium Games" T4 books, I
just ordered "Pocket Empires" for example.

    Knowing from experience the difficulties of ordering on-line and thru
snail mail I thought I would give this guy a plug and at the same time help
out the members here on the TML find some of the harder to come by material.
Having spoken with him (in correspondence) several times I know that he is
willing to track down items too.  He\'s working on a couple for me right now.

    Well plug mode off.  I hope he can help you get that old book for your
stash!  The URL is:

I\'m forwarding this weeks  "weekly update" of things he\'s picked up.  Take a
look at the "Seeker" stuff plus some GDW books that are waaayyyyy out of
print.

I actually agree about the spread although I think the base cost should be
lower. But I\'m trying to stick as closely as possible to the canonical
figure of Cr4000/month (Which, IMO, is actually far too large; one of
these days I\'ll get hold of the life-support rules from FF&S2 and see
what they work out as). So as a compromise I kept the Cr4,000 but used a
large spread.

>You might want to factor in using cheap labor from poor worlds or
>"permanent" working passage labor as well.

Yes. Michael Koehne reminded me that after the Hard Times some starships get
along for months and years on their own resources. Frankly, I don\'t know
just how to account for that.

Nope. It\'s Cr2,000 per person, not per stateroom. And its quoted per trip
only because the rules assume that a ship makes two jumps per month (Check
the description of the typical trip). There is a rule in a CT publication
(_Beltstrike_) that makes it abundantly clear that life support costs are
Cr2,000 for two weeks, regardless of whether you jump or not. Also look
under the rules for long-term subsistence. They state that crewmembers have
their board and lodging while staying on a planet covered by the normal
life support costs. Which is exactly why passengers should not burden the
life support system as much as crewmembers.

>It also says that cargo has no overhead cost, even for
>livestock, which can\'t have all that different basic life support needs.

Interesting point. I hadn\'t considered that. But IMO that is an oversight
rather than deliberate. Hmmm... just how much should life support for
livestock cost? Weight in kg divided by 100 and multiplied by the cost
for a human?

>So what this Cr2000 is, unless it is tax I don\'t know. 

Several publications have explained that the cost is for life support and
that it is an average; sometimes the costs are less, sometimes they are
more, but they average out to Cr2,000/jump.

Btw. IF it was a tax then it should be stated in the rules since not every
campaign runs in the official Traveller Universe and and not every trip is
made inside the Imperium. In any case, it can\'t all be tax, since it
includes enough food to feed a crewman for 14 days.

 
>Do the crew have to feed & muck-out the animals? I like the role-play

More likely that the owner sends a groom along. If the crew has to do the
dirty deeds then they should at least charge money for it.
 
>T4 also quotes an overhead cost of Cr100 per trip per low berth. What
>does this represent?

I haven\'t been able to come up with any suggestion. Especially since a low
passage costs about Cr500 less than it logically should (assuming jump-1).
 
>Note that T4 uses a transportation charges of Cr4000 per ton.

That was a misprint (Officially declared so by an IG type person).

That depends. If you go by the rule that if two canonical bits of evidence
contradict each other then you should go with the most recently published,
then, yes, tamperproof transponders are canonical. If you go by the rule
that if two bits of canon contradicts each other then you should go by the
one that makes the most sense (or has the best roleplaying potential ;-),
then, no, they are not.

I am specifically looking at the Attorney, Technical Priesthood,

others would be of interest, too, of course.

Has anyone done this already?

If you have, or know of someone who has, would it be possible to send me

I would think that the size of an escort force would depend on the threat
it is guarding against and not the size of the convoy. Though I suppose
there would be some correlation (fatter targets attract more predators),
the correlation would be far from linear. 

>not would it make sense for a battleship to escort 10 free traders.

No, but that\'s because a battleship is of much more use elsewhere. If an
escort force were big enough to protect 10 free traders, it would IMO be
big enough to protect 50 free traders.

Keep in mind that money has no use value at all, only exchange value.
Money is valuable only because it can be exchanged for things that
really are useful. If the people of the frontier your PCs are moving to
don\'t have any significant trade with any Imperial planet, their credits
and solars are worthless out there. The only way to move wealth is to buy
stuff and bring it with you and hope that you can find someone who think
it is useful stuff (Unless the planets they are moving to happens to be
on some kind of artificially inflated metal standard, in which case
your PCs would be in luck).

Judging by TCS and _Striker_ defense taxes is propably assessed on the
planets based on population. As for the rest, some TNS newsbriefs from
the Rebellion Era directly mentions the revenues owed by the Vilani
Megacorporations to the Imperial Family. I once noticed that with one
single exception all the companies whose share distribution we know of
have a minimum of 2 percent owned by the Imperial Family. I think we
should establish that the price of an Imperial Charter is a flat 2
percent of the shares (The exception -- one of the Megacorporations, I
forget which -- is either a misprint or there is some sort of story
behind why the Imperial family sold their 2% -- something they usually
NEVER do!).

I don\'t see why it has to be non-voting stock. I mean, I suppose it could
be, but I see no real reason why it has to be.

Here\'s my take ...

The Imperium is a capitalist/trade-based empire  that  rules  the
space _between_ planets.  I think the issue of taxation would  be
dealt with several ways.

First:  a planet is allowed to run its own  economy  as  it  sees
fit, but Imperial Planetary Tax is levied based  on  interstellar
trade volume.  (If a planet wants  to  be  isolationist  and  not
trade with its partners thats fine, no tax to  pay  and  possibly
gains Red Zone status.  But if they want the expected  prosperity
that full participation in Imperial membership would bring,  they
have to pay their dues.)  Note that the inside of a  starport  is
beyond on exterality line and therefore Imperial \'space\'  ...  so
Imperial Tax Inspectors  can  easily  monitor  trade  throughput.
Ships moving cargo without going through the starport are  liable
to be impounded or blown out of the sky.  Imperial Planetary  Tax
is paid to the subsector government who passes on a share to  the
sector  government  who  passes  on  a  share  to  the   Imperial
government.

Second: a one-time levy against capital made when LIC  status  is
granted to any corporate entity.  Said levy to be  5%  non-voting
shares paid direct to  the  Imperial  family.  A  corporation  is
normally registered on one world  and  subject  to  that  world\'s
legislative and tax requirements.  However,  a  corporate  entity
can  re-register  into  the  Imperium  (gaining  LIC  status)  in
exchange for a) the _right_ to conduct interstellar business, and
b) immunity from planetary regulations of off-planet  operations.
(eg. if Acme LIC has branch offices on Rhylanor and Porozlo, then
only the Rhylanor office is subject to Rhylanor\'s rules and  only
the Porozlo office is subject to Porozlo\'s  rules  ...  both  are
subject to Imperial rules.)  Privately run trading vessels  below
1000 dt are exempt from requiring LIC to operate.

Third: revenue a LIC corporation receives that is not subject  to
any planetary taxation defaults to Imperial Corporation  Tax  (at
20% of net revenue).  This  is  calculated  by  subsector  unless
special dispensation  by  a  Sector  Duke  grants  a  sector-wide
calculation.  Losses are offset against revenue and can be rolled
over for up to 10 years (20 years if sector-wide).

There would be a myriad of additional minor revenue streams  from
permits and certificates ...  Cr100  safety  certificate  awarded
after each ship\'s annual maintenance, required for any  insurance
policy  or  loan  ...  Cr150  per  annum  subsector-wide   animal
livestock transportation certificate ... Cr75 per  annum  sector-
wide foodstuffs handling certificate ... Cr10 per  passenger  per
jump starport tax ... and so on.

Finally, a Sector Duke can waive any of these charges (in full or
in part) to help develope economically depressed  systems  within
his sphere of influence.

(Oh, and don\'t  underestimate  the  business  importance  of  the
"Subsector Duke\'s Annual Ball", or whatever the local  equivalent
is.   This  is  where  serious  business  deals  are  made.   The
distinction between business and politics is blury at the best of
times ... more so once it goes interstellar.)

Well, Imagine if you will an area in which it is fairly likely that an
unescorted vessel will be attacked.  Perhaps there is a high incidence of
Vargr Raiding going on, or maybe there is a tradewar, or a real war, and
merchants who wish to trade in the area are willing to give up a percentage
of their profits to pay for more firepower on a temporary basis.  It makes
perfect sense; a 400 ton Close Escort to shepherd a few fat traders, they
jump together, arriving within a few hours of one another at the
destination.  The merchants get a big defense boost without making a
capital investment in weapons, the CE gets a job. Generally raiders will
simply avoid escorted convoys in favor of unescorted targets anyway.

The question is, how many ships will feel safe escorted by one 400 ton CE?
Jo feels this question can be answered by a ratio of 10:1; up to 4000 tons
of vessel can be escorted by 400 tons of escort.  This is a balance of cost
and protection.  One 400 ton trader cannot make enough money (usually) to
justify the rental of an escort of its own, likewise, 40 traders will not
feel protected by one escort.  There is a balance point somewhere.  10 to 1
is a good place to put it without doing a lot of analysis.

>big enough to protect 50 free traders.

But would 50 free traders pay for that protection?  What value would they
place on it?  How big a ship would be needed to satisfy the merchant
captain\'s worries?  How does the escort\'s reputaiton figure in?

The numbers should work out thus;

A group of traders makes X in net profit per fortnight from a cargo run
(without escort).  The escort has expenses Y each fortnight.  X must be
enough larger than Y that subtracting Y will leave a satisfactory profit
(or not too high a loss).  Quesiton is what is a satisfactory profit/loss?

That is determined by several unmeasurables;  Safety of the area,
personality of the captain(s), reactions of the locals to any troubles (or
perceived troubles), reputation of the escort (if any).

Ok, I\'ll arbitrarily assign a rating of -10 to +10 to an area.  Core sector
(in say 1100) is a -10 (very low chance of incidents), Glisten, with its
high navy presence and hugevolume of traffic, is rated at a -2 (low chance
of incidents), a world one jump-1 away from Glisten is a \'0\', Mertractor,
on the Imperial border, near Aslan space and the Sword worlds, but still
pretty busy (on an xboat route) is probably a +2.  Aramanx, a busy world,
but near the Vargr border is a +4.  Middle of a real war zone is +10,
middle of a tradewar zone is +6.

Next the Captains.  most are out to make a profit, but know that there is
no profit in a burning wreck of a ship, or in a captured cargo and ransomed
or enslaved crew.  I\'d assign each a catiousness rating, then modify it
using the area code above and roll less on 2D to hire an escort.

So a cautious captain (rating 5) in a war zone (+10) will always hire (15-
on 2d6) an escort, and will occasionally hire an escort in a border zone
(+2, roll 7- on 2d6), and rarely in a \'safe\' zone (rating 0, roll 5- on
2d6)  while a foolhardy captain (rating -1) will regularly hire an escort
in a war zone (-1+10=9, roll 9- on 2d6), and never in a safe zone (rating 0
- -1 = -1 or less on 2d6).

Rating is affected by the captains personality and how well armed he is to
begin with.  A trader in, say, a converted Azhanti High Lightning (somehow
procured from the Navy with weapons intact) will have a -1 cautiousness,
while a 400 ton subsidized merchant with two single lasers installed is
likely to be more cautious.

Now, we all know that a trader values his profits.  Briefly a trader will
be willing (but might not need) to give up area rating^2 if over 0 or
2^Area Rating if under zero (and .9% if zero) in profits to get an escort
(once the decision is made to hire).  So a trader in a +10 area will give
up *all* of his profits (100%) to safely leave or cross the area.  I bet
he\'s not coming back soon though.

Here\'s the table;
Rating  Percentage
- -10	0.010
- -9	0.012
- -8	0.016
- -7	0.020
- -6	0.028
- -5	0.04
- -4	0.06
- -3	0.11
- -2	0.25
- -1	0.5
0	0.9
1	1
2	4
3	9
4	16
5	25
6	36
7	49
8	64
9	81
10	100

There are likely to be more than a few escorts available in busy, dangerous
areas that will be able to escort a specific craft, driving the price down.

This does, however, give us a ratio to work with to determine the ratio of
escort tonnage to merchant tonnage.  If we assume that warships cost and
require roughly twice the amount of maintenance as equal tonnage merchants,
then in an area that is rated \'10\' two merchant tons will pay for one
escort ton, if the rating is \'5\' it takes eight, and in a \'1\' zone it takes
200 trader tons (a 400 ton escort for an 80,000 ton trader?).  I would
arbitrarily guess that an escort *could* convoy twice that much tonnage
without upsetting the merchants, making a tidy profit.  Finding 80,000 tons
of ships leaving all at once is the excercise of the escort captain.

Negative ratings quickly make escort duty unprofitable.  Competition
effects I leave up to the referee.

I think that\'s non-linear enough to keep Hans happy.

A couple of problems with this. 1) Taxing consumption is not necessarily
better for the economy...look today at Japan...they\'re trying to
_increase_ consumption. Not much point in making any capital
improvements with all those saved up credits if the things you produce
aren\'t being bought.

2)It does require an enormous amount of bookeeping...it just transfers
it from the consumer to the vendor.

I suspect that the Emperor says \'Hey, Archduke so\'n\'so, your tax bite is
x gazillion credits this fiscal year.\' Archduke goes to his staff who
tell the dukes under him, \'Your tax bite is z share of x-gazillion
credits...\' and so on down the feudal chain to the tail end charlies,
those knights and barons, etc, telling their people that their income
taxes or sales taxes, or poll taxes, or however they decide to implement
it. That way all decisions of concrete implementation are handled at the
local level, where it\'s supposed to be, according to how the Imperium is
set up.

This is the entire point of a feudal system of governing...the _only_
place that any concrete implementation, rather than articulation of
policy is handled.

first of all: I4m not native Englisch-Speaking, so please forgive me my
wrong-spelling!

I think the only way to raise taxes in a modern, capitalistic world of
such dimensions is to introdiuce something called "Mehrwertsteuer" in
German. It works that way: A merchant wants to sell Bananas for 100 Cr.
The "Mehrwertsteuer" is 10%. (In Germany it is actually 15 %). So the
Merchant will ask for 110 Cr. and gives the 10 Cr. to the Goverment. The
same goes for services, like window-cleanig or whatever you like. This
system has some good effects, since not all of the people are
self-employed. This means, you do not need to tax everyone, which keeps
paperwork acceptible. The probibly best thing you get with this system,
is that you4re able to tax all these peole who are not registerd
somewere or who travelle too much through the galaxy to be taxed by one
goverment. This means most player characters!!! You will be able to tax
people whenever they buy anything!!
This system is not perfect, of couse, since a black-market would still
avoid this type of tax, but whenever one black-market-customer buys
anything else, e.g. bread, cloth, a car... you get to tax him.

Ok, thats what I thing that would work, please mail me any comments!!!

Both of these are so true. Also sales taxes and their equivilent tend to
assist the rich in getting richer and the poor in getting poorer. Unless
all the capital investment that is promoted expends the economy enormously
a sales tax will only help those with money to invest, and that threshold
will be higher because a sales tax drives up the cost of basic expenses.

If history is anything to go by this will produce all sorts of exciting
conflicts and corruptions. Tax farming is a very effective way of getting
your money without paying the overheads yourself, but it tends to be hard
on those who pay the taxes. It would also make being a Imperial Census
Auditor a very exciting job.

This is the same as the sales or VAT system mentioned in other posts. In
America a national sales tax has been advocated by people as diverse as
Frank Zappa to Dick Armey. As an entirely consumption-based tax it is
attractive in many ways, but the paperwork demands on small businesses
in particular can be extensive. 

Also, applied across the board, as a VAT, this leads to extremely high
taxes being levied on goods, since taxes accrue at every step along the
manufacturing and distribution process. A straight sales tax at the
retail level avoids this problem but includes a large number of others.
For instance, were we to do that in this country, I\'d immediately found
a business, and pay for my business license, etc. Presto, I can buy at
wholesale and avoid the taxes.

Also, these schemes typically exempt a lot of services and goods;
combined with the various \'My business owns my house and buys my food\'
loopholes, ends with the net result that the wealthy pay a far lower
percentage of their earnings in taxes than do the poor. 

That tends to piss off the masses.

I\'ve yet to see a \'national sales tax\' scheme proposed (at least here in
the US) that did a whole lot to eliminate, for instance, the problems we
have here in the US with taxes. (unequal tax burdens, a code riddled
with loopholes, and lots of tax evasion) A straight, evenly applied
sales tax on _everything_ no exceptions, would work, but hell, so would
a straight, evenly applied income tax.

Actually, all I said was the last time we walked this thread the general
list consensus was 1:10. I just noted that it was interesting that the
calculations I ran of the total number of ships in the Imperium also
produced this figure.

I\'m not sure this is the correct approach. An approach more in fitting with
how the real world works would be along the lines of risk assessment. The
important thing then is not how profitable the route is, but rather how
likely the ship is to be attacked. Which is pretty much how you have
structured your mechanics, although you don\'t call it that :-)

There are several problems with what I would call "Sales Tax", one is
double-dipping, that is, taxing a single product twice or three times in
it\'s lifetime, something currently avoided (in Massachusetts) by making
wholesale transactions tax exempt and charging tax only on finished
products sold retail.

Another problem is that the Imperium, canonically, has no real jurisdiction
at the planetary level.  I would say that the Imperium has no desire to
build a bureaucracy on each and every planet in the Imperium to implement
and enforce it\'s sales tax laws.

No, I agree with another poster.  The planetary governement(s) is told that
it must pay a certain amount to the Imperial government for taxes and that
it is up to the individual government how that money is raised.  The actual
amount should be formula driven based on population and either GWP, per
capita income, and/or the amount of interstellar trade.  By making it a
formula the Imperial Government is seen to trerat everyone fairly (and that
will get the tax through the moot).  In spite of this the Imperials may
exempt a world for a year or five in the case of economic disaster or
somesuch.

Hey! maybe the Imperium can do what New Hampshire does and raise all its
taxes by selling all the liquor in the state and running the state lottery!

Sounds good to me.   Of course, the nobles can always gather more taxes than
is due (and probably do), keeping the surplus.  

The Archdukes were out of the loop from the First Civil War until Strephon
reinstated their power (source: MT Imperial Encyclopedia).  Thus it probably
went: Emperor-Sector Dukes-Subsector Dukes-so on all the way to the Barons.
Knights aren\'t part of the peerage... It\'s just an honorific, isn\'t it?

	I can agree with the complete scenario. The Gazelle Close Escord 
	was not designed to escord 10 fat traders, but to act as screening
	and as a tanker for Chrysanthemum destroyers.

	If there is trouble in an area, traders will convoy each other.
	10 fat traders (one missile turret, one laser) have far more
	firepower, than a single Gazelle Close Escord. And even Vargr
	have to come with Foghawks (10kdt cruiser) to be a treat.

> the CE gets a job.

	Gazelle crew\'s dont need job\'s. They are belonging to imperial
	navy. If the trouble is to big, it\'s even vice versa. The
	Gazelle will ask Joe Average Trader to help in this screening
	job (its easy, just catch the missiles) as many traders are
	subsidary!

	For this reason traders are armed. If there is trouble they
	will jump in convoy. I single trade may be a simple prey, but
	a dozend of fat traders are a fleet in their own right.

	the best thing a planet can therefore have is the feudal
	technocracy with a wise lord to whom the planet belongs. He can
	deceide to invest in industry and to pay parts of the tax from
	his own money. He therefore would would offer a moderate tax
	and allows the planet to grow rich, and not to become slave
	of the Laffer curve. The wealthier lords can even pay their
	tax from the revenue of imperial stock they hold.

It would certainly be easier than the old clunky mailing list or web based
forum available now. 
I mean no disrespect, for what they are (tho outmoded technologies), they
work the way it\'s supposed to...
Be that as it may, it would be nice if the makers of Traveller would upgrade
to a more modern forum.
Email lists and web bases forums (that just append mail to a web page or
list) cannot compete with the responsiveness and convenience of a true news
group.

My second point is one I direct to Marc Miller\'s Marketing department. 

Now I can only speak for Western Washington State area, but there are
precious few locations that carry Traveller T4 products at this time.
Compared to the number of RPG\'s available in general, found at the multitude
of W. Wash hobby shops, T4 is virtually nonexistent. I\'m a RPG\'er from way
back (so I remember the small Traveller books/moduals) but have problem
finding other T4 players (any Traveller players actually, any age), I fear
we are a dying breed, smothered by better marketed games. I wondered if this
was a trend in other locations. If so, I feel it\'s a marketing blunder. Why
can\'t I find Traveller products in more locations. Currently, I can only
find the game for sale in two stores in the W. Wash area: "Wizards of the
Coast" and "Wonder World". This game\'s been out two years, according to the
inside cover, why isn\'t it more proliferated? This is a source of concern
for all of us, because if the game doesn\'t take off, it will (in time)
disappear or become to domain of a few die-hards. Science Fiction is really
big right now, this game should fly!

What do you think we could do to get Marc and Co. to upgrade to a
unmonitored news group?
What do you think we could do to get IGI to market more aggressively?
I would like to hear your comments, opinions, etc. If you too believe this
is a good idea, perhaps we can all write Imperium Games Co. and tell them
so.

Local geography can have a tremendous effect on these values.  I am also a
pilot, and I have been stationed at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs for a
total of four years now.  I have personally witnessed winds in clear air at
ground level in excess of seventy knots (tents blown away, antennae and
trees knocked down, etc.) on one occassion, and one or two incidents of
winds in excess of 50 knots every year - not including thunderstorms.  One
of the very few airline accidents in the past 25 years still listed by the
NTSB as "unsolved" occured at Colorado Springs airport: a 727 on short
final simply rolled completely over and crashed.  The black box was an
older type, and could only confirm the facts without giving an clue as to
why.  Best guess is a "horizontal rotor vortex" (I think that\'s the term) -
a volume of clear air turbulence that rolls like a giant log off the
mountains - that literally flipped the plane over when it was too low for
the pilot to recover.

I have also witnessed winds in excess of 110 knots on the ground on several
occassions in 1991 in Germany - the trees looked like they had been combed
flat, all in the same direction.  Fortunately, this followed a similar
incident at Fort Hood, Texas, that destroyed almost a billion dollars in
Apaches and Chinooks, so that we were in the habit of hangaring our
aircraft every weekend, or when the weather forcast called for any high
winds.

Wind speeds on Mars, by the bye, can typically exceed 300 knots at ground
level, but are so thin that the fines barely move.

serious crash and has been down for some time. We have been using an 
alternate server that is not connected to IRC at large. Email me for 
details if you\'d like to lurk.  My husband might be looking for 
another player or two that are serious about playing regularly.

JD Burdick runs a game on Monday nigts at 7:30pm Central on the 
aforementioned alternate server.  This game has run for over a year 
and has only missed three or four sessions. At present there are no 
openings in this game.

Commander X runs a game, I believe on Tuesday nights and again on the 
alternate server (anyone spot a trend here? :> ).  I don\'t have many 
details on this one, but the game is centered around the mysterious 
Planet X and reports have it that it is more tech/gear-head oriented 
than the other two.

I have no details at present regarding the forth-coming game other 
than I will be running a quasi-NPC behind the scenes for it.  Feel 
free to email me your interest and I\'ll try to put you in touch with 
the GM.

Again, feel free to email me on any of the above or for more 
information about gaming on IRC.

If the \'standard rate of profit\' is 10%, then the interest payments on your
average starship mortgage are going to be a lot higher.

Most people assume the Imperium doesnt directly tax income - how the
Imperium actually raises revenue is an interesting question (me, I think
they invoice planetary governments, and own large chunks of
megacorporations. I think to become a Limited Imperial Corporation you have
to cut the Imperium a block of non-voting shares). 

I\'d be interested in how you quantify interstellar trade - my GUTTT system
basically works from bottom up, and says for every Cr1000/dton you can make
on a run on average, 1% of the smaller planets economy will be dedicated to
that trade. Then I toss in higher-value cargoes than \'vanilla\' Traveller
supports (which leads to *very* long trade routes), which have relatively
smaller GDP impact (but trade with 20 planets of 0.2 percent of GDP impact
each turns into a big chunk of GDP).

The idea of rating Corporate interests on a planet as a planet for PE
purposes is interesting - to extend the idea, you could also have culture
etc ratings for each company.

Yes. The theory with a Far Trader was always it would go broke shipping
freight but it could make more profit than a jump-1 ship could shipping
speculative cargo (imagine two worlds 4 parsecs apart where you have a
expected specualtive profit of Cr 3000 per dton. A jump-1 ship gets a
revenue of Cr750/jump, a jump 2 ship Cr 1500/jump).

Frankly, I find fixed freight rates silly. Do you have a copy of Hans\'
Freight and Passenger table ?

Actually, a freight system that took into account the merchant\'s skills
would be nice.

>Alternatively perhaps the designs in Starships! are so non-optimal as to

Yes. Starships, as a product, is one of the reasons IG went broke. Their
quality control was just too inconsistent.

This about cancels out with 90% of capacity and 30 trips a year, which you
can easily do if you have agents on planets with warehouses to store cargo
until shipment.

How do they know how many they haven\'t found?

This reminds of the quote:  90% of computer security penetrations

Although the text says "4000" per  ton, the ship revenues 
table on page 113 says 1000 per ton. I\'m not sure which one 
is the typpo, but I\'m guessing the text.

Speaking of T4 typo\'s are the ship prices in there for

You will have to check two other sources to find this out.  Emperor\'s
Arsenal details a few new combat rules, including autofire.
Guns!Guns!Guns! by BTRC, however, has a Traveller conversion section that
is far more complete.

In essence, use the following chart:

Rnds/Sec    Rnds/turn     Damage     ROF DM   Weapon Type
   4-          <30         1.5x        -1
  5-10        30-60         2x         +0
 11-20        61-120       2.5x        +1
 21-50       121-300        3x         +2        RF
  51+          >300         4x         +4        VRF

Autofire is based on a /sustainable/ ROF.  If a weapon runs out of ammo
during a six-second combat turn, it is not reloaded to get a higher ROF
(eg: a machine pistol that empties its 32 round magazine in 2 seconds still
fires at an *average* ROF of 5.33 rounds per second *during a six-second
combat turn*, for a +0 autofire DM).

Nice deckplans, but some of the text is non-canonical or just odd.. like

Not worth it.  The vehicles are so thinly described and poorly done it\'s a

I have had a charecter on a ship that other [foolish] charecters took
into jump space from the inside of a pressurized bay on the planets
highport within .1 diameter of the planet.  They did this while
attempting to chase down another scout ship which was doing the same
thing.  But wait, it gets worse.

They put this ship into jump space inside the high port

_while_there_were_people_on_the_hull_of_the_ship_.

Fortunately for them the GM was using MT rules which, as written,
provide a drastic penalty for jumping within 10 diameters but do not
impose any further penalty for jumping from within 1 diameter, or within
0.1 diameter, or while in atmosphere.  They also state [SOM] that the
jump bubble forms 1 to 2 meters from the hull.  All the players on the
hull made their Dex rolls not to be cut in half by the jump field and
then came abord the ship as if nothing had happened.  My charecter was
the ships Engineer at the time (with good skill in Engineering, some
skill in Physics, and a high Education).  I could _not_ persuade the
other charecters, or the other players, how mind numbingly dumb they
were.  We came out of jump just fine, 14 days and 29 parsecs later,
IIRC.  This only encouraged the players to try further reckless
misjumps.

Just FYI, that would still violate copyright laws, or to be more
precise,that a copyrighted work is not in print or available online or

I think you must be right.  (Good idea with the non-voting shares.  This
seemsreasonable since you the block of votes could be a very low percentage
but you make it up on volume of corporations.  Then, literally,
\'What\'s Good for Zhunastu Industries, Is Good for the Imperium.\'

It seems to me that the Imperium could probably work on a basis similar to
the United Nations, in terms of funding.  All member states pay a percentage
of their Gross National Product (might actually be Domestic, I\'m not sure).
The percentage is the same for all members.  Since the Imperium works on
a similar principle, i.e., not directly governing member states but the
spaces
between the stars.

Striker was the large combat Traveller game. I never owned it but I belive

From: "Thom Harris" <thomharr@mediaone.net>
Subject: Re: CU-Seeme "Live" game. <longish>

Follow-up to my previously posted message (See below) to answer questions
that were asked by most everyone that responded.

FIRST - The Software

1.  CU-SeeMe software allows people with a camera "broadcast" live images
over the net and be displayed by ANYONE on the reflector.  People who are on
just watching are caller "Lurkers" but any and all can type (chat) live and
everyone will see that.  You can also use a sound card and attach a
microphone and speakers/headset to do live voice.  This eats up a tremendous
amount of bandwidth and slows things down pretty bad.  The key is everyone
can see what I broadcast with my video and every can chat at the same time.
2. ICQ is a little program that lets you know when another person that also
uses ICQ gets on the I-net and you can send notes to them individually.  I
want to use this as a supplement to CU-SeeMe and possibly (if we have no
choice) a back-up means of communication.
3. Both pieces of software are free.
4. I have a very high speed line (cable modem) so I won\'t see much lag from
the players.  It\'s possible that the players will see some lag from me
because I\'m sending a great deal of bandwidth but generally if there is NO
change in the video that frees up the bandwidth and things will go pretty
normal.

SECOND - The Game
1. My intent right now is to use TNE (maybe T4) character generation in a
pre-rebellion CT/MT setting (just after the 5th FW).  The exact area is
still being decided but it will wind up in Zho space (passing thru the
Marches).  This keeps the TL up to 14/15 (which I like) and there is plenty
of published material available for any and all who still have it (I can
provide some).
2. I will put up a list of character professions/abilities that I need for
this assignment and the players will roll their own, bring one from another
campaign, I\'ll roll it for you, well you get the idea.  Final players will
get my seal of approval (just to keep some game balance) and we will head
out.
3. This is a subsidized adventure and a ship with NPC will be provided by
the sponsor.
4. Standard weapons and some combat materials will be provided also.
5. Initial setup will be done thru E-mail and I will keep records on my end
for the player characters.
6. Most other functions and the bulk of the record keeping will be
accomplished by the players.

The response was much larger than I first anticipated and if their are other
GM\'s who would be interested in running a game using this format please
contact me and I will help get you started.  There are a number of benefits
by doing it long distance:
1. Propping your feet up while you sip your suds and you don\'t have to drive
home afterwards.
2. Don\'t have to get the dining room table cleaned off to run the game.
3. No SPECIAL house cleaning for your guests (my wife likes this one, she
bought me the video camera when I explained how it would work <BG>).
4. You can keep secrets easier and not get that "I\'ll do what Joe\'s doing"
from a player that thinks he/she might have missed a hook that someone else
caught. (I especially hate this one)  This makes for better balance in my
way of thinking and it makes the players declare things much better.
5. You can have subplots running with players without getting someone else\'s
nose in it.
6. NPC\'s are easier to use in ALL ways.

I\'m sorry for intruding on the TML again but I put this back up because of
the type and quantity of the responses.  The Traveller world needs to get a
larger following.  I hope no one gets too upset.  I believe that this will
be my last post on the subject.

As always, please respond directly to me in private E-mail
thomharr@mediaone.net and I will do my best to reply to everyone.  To those
who have already replied, I hope this answers the initial questions you had
and will help you make up your minds whether to play or not.

This isn\'t particularly true under most combat systems. Under High Guard
a military ship with a good comptuer and high evasion will never be hit by 
a civilian ship with a model/1 . . . and under Brilliant Lances and its
successors, civilian ships lack the sensors to attack military targets at
combat ranges - and also lack the MFDs to score hits at long range. An
attacker could sit outside an unescorted convoy\'s effective weapons range
and slice it to pieces. 

(Not to say that the Gazelle is a great escort either - a better niche 
ship would have lower jump performance but high maneuver, decent armour, 
and an all-laser weapons suite.)

Actually I had good luck using a supplement for Dark Conspiracy (don\'t

it was pretty seamless, and we got about six good evenings out of it.

I\'m afraid that Mr. amarin@walldata.com has made several classic newuser
blunders.  He included an entire 30K digest as part of a reply, and he
doesn\'t seem to have read the section on how to create a newsgroup in
the news.announce.newusers FAQ.  I suppose that we should be grateful
that what he did write was in plain text, and not in some illegible
binary-encoded attachment.

Now, who\'s going to break it to him that IG is out of business...?

It is not so much a matter of finding, as figuring out
orbits.  They have a "general" idea of how many asteroids
there are.  Also, when you look at successive areas,
the numbers can be taken as representative of what
you will find as you go along.

Well, as far as I know asteroids don\'t try and actively
avoid detection  :-)

No offense, but have you ever talked to a news administrator?  Here at UM,
where we have a pretty good computing environment, we still manage to drop
news posts on a fairly regular basis -- the email, on the other hand, always
gets through.  I think you have a skewed view of the reliability of these

It sounds more like a sales tax than a VAT.  I don\'t think the Imperium
would use either.  Both would be too intrusive on the worlds...remember the
Imperium controls the "space between the worlds."

>In America a national sales tax has been advocated by people as diverse as

That\'s true, the paperwork is a regular pain.  Thing is most states and
many local governments already levy sales taxes in the US, so adding a
national bite wouldn\'t add much to the paperwork..or it wouldn\'t *have* to. 
Of course, it *would* turn into a nightmare.

A National Sales tax has other problems, though, like being a
progressive tax that hits harder on the poor and middle class than the
rich.  Whether that\'s true or not and whether that bothers me or not isn\'t
the point, it\'s a political perception that will kill this kind of tax
right at the gate.

If you do that, and get caught, you\'ll go to the slammer.  I\'ve got a tax
number, here in Florida, and I can use it to buy goods with no sales tax,
however those goods *must* be used in my business, not for personal use. 
If the items are used by me personally, given to anyone else for use, or
sold I have to collect the sales tax from whoever I sell it to (or myself)
and report it on the proper forms, and there are agents out there who
*enforce* this law.  Not to say folks don\'t try it...a couple of regular
folks I know tried to play cozy with the tax laws and are now enjoying
public care...if you catch my drift.

>Also, these schemes typically exempt a lot of services and goods; combined
>with the various \'My business owns my house and buys my food\' loopholes,

Geeze, I *know* you\'d do time if you got caught trying that!  You *might*
get away with the "auto for business" ploy, but they\'re cracking down on
that here now.

As for exempting certain classes of goods, that\'s usually to "protect" the
poor by exempting the "necessities of life" from tax (food and medicine
usually).

In Florida, all services are exempt because they don\'t involve the trade of
*goods*, and that\'s what the tax is being levied on.  A service tax was
passed by the legislature a few years ago to raise money, but there was
such a public outcry from the public that the Governor called a special
session and the law was repelled before it even went into effect.

>That tends to piss off the masses.

Isn\'t that the truth.  ;-> National Tax Day for the US was last Friday,
wasn\'t it?

A flat tax on income from ALL sources is what I\'d prefer.  No tax on the
first XXX thousand, but no exceptions for *anything* else.  I\'m not holding
my breath. ;-> But back to Traveller...

Guys, you are thinking too Earthy.  In the Traveller universe the only
taxes the Imperium would directly levy would be import/export duties on
trade passing through the Imperially controlled Starports.  That\'s why the
Imperium *owns* the Starports, and why systems tend to have a *single*
starport...everything *has* to pass through Imperial customs where a cut
comes out.  Indirect taxes would be Feudal duties imposed from the Emperor
down to the Archdukes, to the dukes, to the individual system governments. 
That\'s the Imperium in MTU, anyway.

Me, neither.  I only took personal income tax, not any of the really
complicated courses relevant to the question at hand.  Anyway, we should
surely have the first few drafts done by the accountants on the list. 
They\'re the people who really know about taxes.

However, you are just slightly out of date. Mr. Miller and Traveller are no
longer associated with IG, so I would say that the chances of them producing
a newsgroups are rather slim. As  to why T4 isn\'t in more stores, well, I
can only think that since it isn\'t being produced anym more it will only get
worse.

But all is not lost! Marc has assured the List that he is still working on a
new and improved version of Trav and is in contact with several publishers,
negotiating for it\'s release. I have a great deal of faith that the new
publishers Marc selects will do a much better job publishing Traveller and
marketing it!

The more socially concious types might argue that this tax steals from the
poor, as fixed expenses consume a higher portion of their income.  This
would seem to drive those expenses still higher.  One could consider a
"local" tax for provable, documented residents of a locale, and an
"expatriate" tax - much as you describe - applicable to transients - those
who cannot prove residency in the locale...

This is interesting, considering the venomous attacks that occured on the
version of Traveller that you take your name from. I supported TNE then, and
I still support anyone\'s right to enjoy whatever version of Traveller they
choose.

Taxing interestellar trade will tend to discourage it, and the Imperium

The next question is what legal rights do Dukes, Barons etc have ? Does
your Subsector Duke have the legal right to tax a world ? Saying \'yes\' gets
you a truly feudal Imperium, but it seems to violate the \'Imperium doesnt

The final question is what infrastructure exists to support Imperial Tax

So howcome both you and Amarin had to quote the *ENTIRE DIGEST*?

Not unless they\'re canibals (which would have been an interesting partial-
solution for the problem of food on Vland). Of course this wouldn\'t have
worked for long.  : )  
Maybe if the Shugilli poisoned his tribe or whatever, he\'d get eaten by the
survivors. lol

Clone whatever they want.  From the book, i\'d suspect each vat is limited
(though maybe they can be "reprogrammed") to one kind.  Small ships (w/ a
limited # of vats) are said to have comments like "beef again? i\'d kill for
lamb" be heard.

I don\'t consider GURPS to be Traveller.  And it\'s not a canonical issue with 
me, it\'s the issue of game mechanics.  G:T is Traveller converted *TO* GURPS, 
not GURPS converted to Traveller.  It\'s a totally different look & feel.

Now, I haven\'t seen T4\'s rules yet (hell, I didn\'t even *KNOW* about \'em til 
IG stopped publishing them!!), and I pretty much stopped playing about the 
time of Hard Times/Survival Margin, so I\'m not too \'up\' on TNE rules, but what 
I\'ve seen since \'81 has been a pretty rational and reasonable evolution of 
rules.  GURPS comes from a different set of mechanics, from a different 
viewpoint.  It was designed so you could play *any* setting with some serious 
massaging.  And the massaging is the point of it all.

CT to MT conversions are relatively minor, more of a \'chroming out\' process.  
MT to TNE involved more \'chroming\' and tightening up of loose ends.

GURPS is a framework.  *EVERYTHING* has to be massaged to work with it.

Dunno.  But it reminds me of the \'carniculture tanks\' of H. Beam Piper\'s 
various books.  (Yeah, I miss H. Beam.  He wrote some good stuff.)

Worse, he posted the *digest* to the non-digest list.

But it *could* have been worse.  He coulda read it in Netflake & posted in 
HTML.

Methinks somebody already pointed that out to him.

Cloning would still require raw biomass to build from.  If you\'re going to store
biomass, you may as well extrude processed biomass into tubes, flats, or various
other shapes and add flavouring, color and texture.

Another thing to consider is what actually is the threat? Raiding
attacks during wartime will result in dead convoys, including the
CEs (if they are Gazelles). Piracy is a totally different story.
Pirates need to board and capture the target. A high-g military ship
that can jamm and avaoid damage while picking at them makes their
job impossible without killing the escort first. This could give the
civies time to escape. Even if the pirates nail a ship, the rest can
simply evade around an unchanging vector with their crippled friend,
and the escort can nail the pirate if it tries to board.

I\'m sorry, but this does not amuse me. I happen to like GURPS, and think
GURPS Traveller is going to be good. Moreover, I have played and run every
version of Traveller there is, and have been on this mailing list a long
time. Just because I look forward with enthusiasm to GURPS Traveller is no
reason for this kind of thing. I know what I want out of a science fiction
game, and feel that the universe setting is what\'s important, not the rules.
I simply think GURPS has better rules. I would not "shoot" someone who
disagrees with me and prefers to stay with CT, MT, TNE or T4, and I don\'t
think slamming people who like GURPS Traveller will be conducive to a
peaceful list. I went through all that acrimonious crap back when TNE was
around; I really hope we can all be more mature this time.

And the worst a planet can have is the same government run by a greedy
lord. Historically tax farming has resulted in massive taxes on those least
able to afford them. That said though, IMO this is the most likely form of
Imperial taxation. It can even fit the Striker rules on military spending
into it.

As I said earlier this form of taxation has all sorts of interesting
adventure possibilities built into it. For instance the subsector duke
wants you to do a quiet check on the census and GDP figures of one of his
worlds. Just a routine double check, of course...

When designing ships I carefully differentiate between convoy escorts and
fleet escorts, for this reason. No escort doesn\'t need a jump drive any
bigger than the ships it\'s going to escort, and as IMTU most merchant ship
have J-2 at most there\'s no point wasting capacity the way a Gazelle does.

Trojan Reaches and Reft Sectors.

The Regency Sourcebook contains data on all subsectors of Spinward
Marches and Deneb Sectors, 4 subsectors of Trojan Reach, and 9
subsectors of Reft Sector.  It is 96 pages, of small type, and contains
a great deal of good information of the Domain.  I also strongly
reccomend it, if you don\'t play TNE you can easily ignore the TNE parts
of it.  It was $20.

Since it is a more recent product it should be much easier to find than
the original was.  If you can\'t find it locally you may order it from
the game store I order for, Boscos.  Send email to mailorder@boscos.com 
to purchase it, it is $19.95 + shipping.  We have 2 or 3 copies if
anyone else is looking for it.

As would a per person head tax.  Everyone who lives in the United States
would have to pay Y thousand dollars in tax.  Anyone without a tax stamp

In New Zealand, it\'s set up so that everybody (businesses 
included) pays GST, and charges GST to the next person down 
the chain - The difference between the two amounts is 
forwarded to the government.
Thus if Wholesaler sells $100 thing to retailer, they slap 
on 12.5% tax, and the retailer pays %112.50. Then the 
retailer slaps on their markup so the price is now $200, 
and the tax on that is $25. Total price to consumer $225.
The retailer gets to claim back the tax paid on goods that 
are on-sold. Thus they pay tax on the goods that are used 
by the business. The Government gets 10% of the final 
amount that the goods are sold for. Nice neat system, only 
problem is that the compliance costs are huge i.e. how much 
time and effort does each retailer have to put in to make 
sure they are up to date with their tax receipts? Answer - 
lots.

Well if asteroids _did_ try to actively avoid detection they might well
be very sucessful, as long as they knew better than to make
unexplainable movements.  Besides that you know that some of the
"asteroids" out their are really Vilani spy ships :)

Naw.  IRS is the tax collectors.  BATF is Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, & 
Firearms.  2 different outfits, 2 different focuses.  BATF goes after 
smugglers who don\'t pay their taxes on their booze & tobacco and people 
running illegal guns in & out of the country.  IRS goes after the \'softer\' 
crooks -- tax evaders, mostly income tax.

It\'s a laser defense.  What it does is, when you spray it in the air, it 
disperses laser bolts shot at you.

See above.

A sandcaster can help cut down on the hits you\'ll take from laser or energy weapons because it throws a \'cloud\' of solid matter up around you for a few seconds.  Energy bolt hits the cloud and disperses.  Less of it hits *you*.

Easy there, khihe.  I come in peace.  Didn\'t u see the <g>?  lol.  I\'m
contemplating getting the GURPS:Traveller stuff if it looks good.  (And maybe
even if it doesn\'t, if I can find a way to fit it in my campaign that is a
dozen sectors away and 80 years ahead in an "alternate" timeline).  But then,
I also bought stuff set 1200 years before my campaign and a similar
distance... ; )  I supported T4 (some) and will probably support G:T (at least
some), too.

There is no flavoring.  You\'re making yourself a real slab of beef (or
whatever).  You might want ketchup and accessories, but that won\'t fill a
ships locker (and is negligible according to FFS2).  The raw biomass will be
necessary.  Even that, I think will be a very small number unless ones
stocking up for a long trip (months at least).  Remember u only clone what u
eat. No waste (unless u want a bone to chew on).

It\'s also a neat way for businesses and their owners to write off heaps of
things against tax, so it costs a fair bit in investigations and enforcements.

What I really like is the way GST is calculated last, so when our nice
government slaps a thumping great tax on something (say petrol) they then
get to take GST on their tax, as well.

Like I said before, I don\'t play GURPS.  The *only* thing I can see good about 
G:T is that it will expose more people to the Traveller gameverse and 
hopefully when Traveller goes back into publication, these people will come 
over to Traveller.  A \'one size fits all\' gaming system just isn\'t my cuppa 
tea, especially when I have to pick up the basic set and a bunch of expansion 
rulebooks just to have a playable system.

I\'m an \'old fart\', been playin Traveller since \'81.  Yeah, I bought 90% of the 
supplements when they came out, but I didn\'t *NEED* anything more than the 
original LBB\'s to have a viable game going.  Everything came in 1 box, just 
add imagination.  I bought MT when it came out, too, but held off on most of 
the supplements.  And I\'ve got Survival Margin, but not the complete TNE rules.

In my opinion, it\'s the setting *AND* the mechanics that make the game.  The 
setting creates the mood, the mechanics gets things done.  Change the 
mechanics, you change the way things get done.

And by the way, I never *did* specify who or what if anything gets shot.

    'body' => '	I see that, once again, some of us are discussing whether a given 
version of Traveller is or not the "right" one. First it was between 
CT and MT, then they both against TNE, and now it is against G:T even 
*before* it gets published.
	For me, G:T are *good* news. Why?

	1) SJ Games does support its games. I have just located a LGS in 
this country I moved in some months ago, and they have got some 
Traveller... a couple of Milieu Zero campaigns and some german 
translations of MT modules. Of course, no hope of getting anything 
that wasn\'t there. Then I asked about Gurps. You do not even need to 
ask for a supplement, if they do not have it, they order it 
automatically and you get it. And many other LGS act this way. SJ 
Games is not going to be out of business all of a sudden. "G: 
anything" is always a product of an active company.
	So, G:T is going to be there permanently. A version of Traveller 
will always be available, almost anytime and anywhere.

	2) For me, Traveller is the background. I prefer the MT rules 
myself, and I screamed when I heard about TNE using D20s instead of 
D6s, but you can play any Traveller setting with any core rules that 
have been given a little thought. I bet that people in this list is 
using a hundred different task systems, counting minor variations. 
G:T will still use D6s, and it is quite easy to translate a D6-based
task system to the Gurps Skill levels... in fact, it is easier than 
adapting MT to TNE!
	Thus, if Traveller books get published, the resource pool grows. And 
this can only be good. Whether this books are or not going to be 
Traveller because they *could* allow non-Traveller things as FTL 
communication, we\'ll see. Some of the IG products were\'nt Traveller 
at all, for similar reasons (yes, even FTL communications, in JTAS 
26!).

	The main problems between GURPS and Traveller are two. First, that 
GURPS: Space uses a setting with tachyonic communications, but I am 
sure that Loren will make sure that this is specifically ruled out in 
the book. Second, that the TL progression is very different in Gurps 
(see UIltratech, e.g.). But, I am also sure that the G:T book will 
say something about it... gravitic technology is far more advanced in 
Gurps than in Traveller, and the other way around with energy 
weapons, true... but it only takes a short chapter on "Technology" to 
fix it once and for all, applying to all future "Gurps Traveller: 
whatever" books.

I\'m sure there are VOLUMES of people here who will disagree with that

 GURPS comes from a different set of mechanics, from a different

From what I have seen (and a friend of mine is playtesting GURPS Traveller,
so i have seen it) it is taking far less massaging than some might think.
Also, having played GURPS since it\'s inception, with the notable exception
of superheroes, it works quite well for all the other genres I\'ve used it
for.


>CT to MT conversions are relatively minor, more of a \'chroming out\' process.
>MT to TNE involved more \'chroming\' and tightening up of loose ends.


This is inaccurate. TNE was not just a new edition of Traveller; it was a
porting of Traveller into the GDW House System, first used for Twilight 2000
and Dark Conspiracy. And as many will attest, it made some serious changes
to both the game system itself and the background and technological
underpinnings of the game. It eliminated reactionless drives from the
Traveller universe, for instance. (yes, they were in the original version of
FF&S1 as a variant technology, but they were replaced by HEPLar drives in
the "canon".) GURPS Traveller, for example, uses reactionless drives. It
uses, in fact, classic Traveller and Striker as the basis for it\'s
conversions of ships and technology, with a few minor exceptions.


I have no illusions about changing your mind about anything. but to say
"GURPS Traveller is not Traveller" is as annoying to me as saying "TNE is
not Traveller". It may not be Traveller to YOU, but it is to me. And there
are other people on this list running Traveller in other game systems (right
Doug?) is what they do "not Traveller"? Who are you to decide what is and is
not Traveller? Decide for yourself, yes, but not for me.

The Imperial calendar doesn\'t *have* months. Quoting from an old post:

> YEAR = 365 DAYs, numbered 001 to 365.  001 is a holiday, called

Frankly, if the rules refer to months, we have several choices:

1. 13 28 day months. This is a pain as dividing the year into 13 chunks
   is less than useful.
2. 12 months of 30/31 days. This is useful, as 12 is divisible by 2, 3,
   4 and 6. Tghis makes it easier dealing with sub-year time periods
   greater than a week.
3. Assume that the references are a mistake.

I find 2 & 3 the better choices. 

Here\'s a likely calendar for #2:

What with the news going on about the multistate Powerball lottery, I
got to thinking about what could happen given the number of worlds and
the length of history in the Imperium.

Picture a world that has a fairly normal lottery, and scrupulously
honest. But due to Murphy, or Fate, or whatever, the big prize has not
been won in *years*. This has all sorts of adventure possibilities.

People trying to hire the characters to fix the lottery. 

People trying to hire the characters to *prevent* someone from fixing
the lottery.

Best of all:

While passing thru one of the characters has one credit of local
currency left, and just to get rid of it, plugs it into a lottery
terminal, and stuffs the ticket in his pocket. Several jumps later, the
news catches up that there was a winning ticket to the drawing held
just after they left. And it was sold at the starport. 

Upon seeing this on the news, one of the characters will remember the
other character buying the ticket. Naturally this will start a frantic
search for the ticket. (Quick! Stop the recycler! :-)

When they find it, it might not be a winner. But if it is....

The jackpot is the sort of money that you could buy a *planet* with.
How trustworthy are your crewmates? How many people are have decided
it\'s worth tracking the ships that left port between the time the
ticket was bought, and when thedrawing occured. There could be a *lot*
of people keeping an eye out for one of those ships (or anyone recorded
as having been on them) returning.

First, don\'t include the *entire* TML digest in your responses.

Second, Imperium Games has dropped T4.  It\'s pining for the fiords.  Nailed
to it\'s perch as it were.  IG didn\'t even update it\'s website, what makes
you think they are going to run a news group for a game they don\'t support
anymore.

Third, the reason for a mailing list as opposed to a news group is to keep
the signal rate higher than than the noise.  Newsgroups are horribly noisy.
 Besides, these days you have to insert spam filters all over your posts
when you post to Usenet.  Mailing lists are harder for spammers to graze.

Newsgroups are not that simple.  First, Netnews is an organization in
itself.  To create a new group, you have to submit a Request For Discussion
to the applicable rec.games.frp groups and to news.groups.  After a 30 day
discussion period, you have to find a neutral person to collect the votes.
There has to be at least 100 more YES votes than NO votes.   I can tell you
from experience that it would fail because the people in rec.games.frp.* do
not like to create new groups.  Even if we got everyone from TML to vote
yes (about 500 people), there would likely be 600 NO votes from the general
public.  It took years and I do mean years (like 10) to get rec.games.frp
to create a hierarchy with rec.games.frp.dnd, rec.games.frp.misc, etc.  and
they were very clear at the time (about 3 years ago) that there would be no
further dividing.  You also have to generate at least 100 messages a month
(which isn\'t a problem for Traveller)

Newsgroups, like this mailing list have people who thing that sub-dividing
is good, and others who religiously believe that sub-dividing is bad
because a) they end up reading all the groups anyway,  b) fragmenting
hampers everyone from partaking, and c) most importantly, most messages get
cross posted and you end up reading things multiple times.

Newsgroups, while more open, are full of junk and spam.  Posters to news
groups will end up on SPAM mailing lists.  You get people who come in just
to muck things up and there isn\'t  JACK that anyone can do.  News messages
spread like the plague.  It increases traffic to sites that may or may not
want traffic.

Mailing Lists on the other hand, cater to the specific needs of a group of
people.   If some bozo starts causing problems, he can be unsubscribed or
blocked if really bad.  SPAM can be mostly eliminated.  Messages are not
propagated to sites that do not want them and the signal to noise ratio is
much higher on a mailing list.

I see you are on digest, which may seem antiquated, but you can also
receive individual messages.  Of course, we do not encourage using
attachments or rich text because it hoses the digests, which is a bit of a
restriction, but it is something we can live without.  We don\'t need red
text on yellow backgrounds to communicate.

I used to be of the mind set that a Traveller news group would be good, but
it got to a point where I could no longer read Netnews due to the sheer
volume of junk floating out there.  I though mailing lists was a dumb way
to do things, but I learned that I get more focused, targeted discussions
with mail.  With all the spam and junk in news groups they are antiquated
and loosing ground as the favored way to communicate.

A per person head tax is, ironically, the epitome of the term "unequal tax
burden".

In that scheme a person who makes $1 million in annual income would pay the
same amount of money as a person who makes less than poverty level and
supports her 4 children on that.  That dollar amount just would not be of
the same level of affordability to the two involved.

It has been said that even a straightforward percentage of income (as
opposed to the byzantine system of exemptions and deductions we have now -
and the "progressive" tax chart) is, in fact, a "regressive" tax, meaning
the burden on lower income people is greater-proportionally-than the burden
on poeple with higher earnings.

This all put\'s me in mind of the quote "Democracy is the worst form of
government...except for all the others."

I would suggest that the U.S. Tax Code in its "bare" form is the worst tax
code in the world, except for all the others.  It\'s a progressive tax that
increases in percentage as income goes up.  It rewards philanthropic
behavior and home buying.  It collects on capital gains (probably too much)
and gives a break on capital losses (probably too much).  The one problem
is that it is too complicated for the average American to prepare their own
taxes.

Of course there are some purists out there that probably think the tax code
is not the place to attempt to modify human behavior, but I would have
voted for it if I\'d had the chance.

I have no intention of starting a "my country tax code is better than
yours" thread (I don\'t know a lot about other country\'s tax codes) I just
wanted to point out the good things about the so called "progressive" tax
system we have here.

Now to Traveller.  I think the next convenient planet visited will be inthe
middle of a "Tax Revolt" where the player\'s cargo is taxed at point of sale
to a significant percentage of tha cargo\'s value, eliminating any chance of
profit on interplanetary trade.  Of course, there may be Imperial Commerce
Department (ICD) agents around who are trying to correct this matter, after
all, the Imperium wants trade to flow freely and taxing off planet imports
is just not the way to do this.

But the Imperials won\'t want to interfere too directly, so influencing the
characters to instigate some form of uprising in the starport or among the
brokers might be an option.  Hmmm.

Another possibilty with (or without) the above scenario is to involve the
characters in a smuggling op to avoid import tariffs...

Merchant escort in a war situation and anti-piracy actions call for
different responses. I\'m not going to address the war situation; it
needs bigger iron than I care to deal with right now.

Piracy (in my view) is a fringe mercantile activity, not a military
activity. As such, vessels engaged in piratical acts will not generally
be armed with "military grade" weaponry. The objective, after all is 
to have usable stuff to steal; too big a gun leaves rubble. Even a
specialized pirate ship will still be relatively lightly armed (for
some value of "relatively"). Pirates also will be reluctant to get
shot up, preferring easy pickings (in contrast to naval combatants
which are expected to go in harm\'s way and not necessarily come back).
Thus, a couple of free traders in arms travelling in convoy will 
present a serious threat to a single pirate ship.

I think of how sail powered merchant ships were often armed, even if
with relative pop-guns (4 pounder, maybe 6 pounder if extravagent). 
If the threat is in small craft, it\'s enough to ruin the pirates\' day
(with adequate gunnery). An unarmed merchant is limited to running away
and resisting boarding.

So why are there seperate entries for prismatic and anti-laser aerosols in
the Ref\'s Manual if they both do the same thing?

A few seconds? So how does the Trepid (for example) know when to throw up
the cloud? I mean, incoming fire is at the speed of light (in the case of
lasers), so any incoming attack will hit well before you can throw up the
screen. Or is believable that the sand can be maintained in a cloud through
some means (magnetically???) even in the face of gravity and atmosphere
efects?

More importantly (for my purposes, anyway) what are the *MT game effects*
of prismatic aerosol, anti-laser aerosol, and sandcasters on small
vehicles?

How fast do you go through ammunition during autofire? There is no RoF
listed for small arms. The only reference I can find to ammo usage is under
"rapid fire," where it states that all the ammo is used in one round of
rapid fire. And under the machineguns I find the sentence "Rapid fire uses
ammo at a rate 3 times that of regular fire." But since it isn\'t mentioned
what regular fire usage is for these weapons, this sentence is useless.

Now some of the big weapons in the Referee\'s Manual have a RoF listed in
the design sequence, and I assume that these are all per minute (as it is
stated under the starship weapons chart). So, I suppose I can divide those
numbers by 10 to get ammo usage per combat round (6 seconds). But it is
only listed for a few weapons, a lot of which don\'t run out of ammo anyway
(drawing off of a vehicle\'s power plant).

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

The Trepida was originally designed for MegaTraveller.  Under those rules, a
sandcaster can also be thought of as a giant shotgun; there\'s a table in the 
combat rules converting starship weapons for use as heavy weapons against
vehicles and people.

I\'m just talking about cold cuts. Like the processed turkey breast that gets
pumped into a sack, then cooked into a coherent shape. You can store the
precooked processed biomass in a tank. Then, when you need it, pump it into
various moulds,  adding appropriate flavor, color and texture to simulate the
real thing.

I think its probably the next step past the cloned meat. After you grow the meat
(which I suspect takes a couple  years at least), you then process it in some
way.  You can save on storage by just getting the processed stuff off the bat.

	I am new to this mailer and was unaware of the fact that
Mr. Miller is no longer with Imperial games. So then what is the

anymore. That would explain why so little of the T4 stuff has been
in the gaming stores over the past five months or so.
	When did this all occure? Was this the reason why the 
Traveller Journel was cancelled? What caused this all to happen?
So you say Mr. Miller coming up with yet again another version
of the game...oh great!
	I have been collecting this stuff over the past 22+ years
and I truly must say that I\'m sick and tired of this company or that
company dropping this, changing that, or coming out with new rules.
When will we end up with a stable game?

That makes for a convenient Tax Day/Accountant\'s Day. The day that everyone

Well, first of all this deals with private, hired escort ships whereas I was
under the impression that Jo was talking about the naval assets of the
Imperium compared to the merchant fleet of same. The two cannot be compared.

>The question is, how many ships will feel safe escorted by one 400 ton CE?

Just to avoid a potential digression: We\'re assuming that one 400 T CE is
thought sufficient to deal with the potential threat, right? I mean, I
might privately believe that you would need more than one ship to deal
with, say, two raiders acting in tandem (one to distract the escort and
to make a capture, perhaps). Or that you might need a 1000 T destroyer
and a couple of patrol boats. Or something else. But for the purpose of
this argument, one 400 T CE is thought to be able to deal with that pesky
Vargr Corsair that is thought to be out there, right?

Given that, I don\'t see why 10 ships should feel more or less protected
than 20 or 50 or 100.

>Jo feels this question can be answered by a ratio of 10:1; up to 4000 tons
>of vessel can be escorted by 400 tons of escort.

And I feel that it\'s not the number of ships escorted that\'s the crucial
question, it\'s the number of ships defended against.

>This is a balance of cost and protection.  One 400 ton trader cannot make
>enough money (usually) to justify the rental of an escort of its own,

Why in the world(s) not?

>>If an escort force were big enough to protect 10 free traders, it would
>>IMO be big enough to protect 50 free traders.
> 
>But would 50 free traders pay for that protection?

Why shouldn\'t they?

>What value would they place on it?

2% of the cost of the escort force.

>How big a ship would be needed to satisfy the merchant captain\'s worries?

Enough to deal with the percieved threat.

>How does the escort\'s reputation figure in?

Into a question that has already been dealt with, since I postulated that
the force is thought sufficient to protect 10 ships.

>The numbers should work out thus;

[Long analysis deleted.]
 
>I think that\'s non-linear enough to keep Hans happy.

Is that a crack? I\'m afraid I didn\'t get it ;-). Anyway, I didn\'t go through
your analysis so thoroughly, because I feel it is based on a false premise.
Instead of working out how much a given number of merchants could afford,
you should work out the size of the threat and the propabilities of falling
afoul of it, work out how much it would cost to guard against the threat,
and then see how many ships would be needed before they could afford to pay
the cost. That would be the minimum size of a convoy. The maximum size of
a convoy would depend on how much loss the individual merchants would
suffer while waiting for a convoy to assemble.

But the Trepida\'s sandcaster is a different beast than a starship
sandcaster -- it is listed under a separate entry in the Ref\'s Manual
vehicle design sequence. IIRC, it is a smaller version that the starship
device. Oh, and it is definitely considered a defensive device -- it\'s
listed in the Trepida\'s stats under Def.

If I were to start a "my country tax code is better than yours" thread I\'d
do exactly like you. The post had nothing to do with Traveller and (IMNSHO)
lacked other content as well.

OT Traveller taxation: I take it that each system is taxed based on
poulation/tech level asessments by IISS and performed by Imperial nobility.
The Domain Archduke sets the taxlevel for his Domains sectors, the sector
Duke sets fills this by setting the taxlevel for each individual subsector
and the subsector Counts(?) sets each individual systems taxlevel which the
individual system Noble (Baron, Marquis or Count) has to collect.

There is a lot of political squabbling at the subsector level where
representatives try to lower their share by downplaying TL advances, fiddle
with the census numbers etc.

bits of the Regency book without any of the TNE materials. I personally
think that the GURPS book will be an excellent reference for any campaign.
I\'m already using it in mine.

But then I\'m biased.

As for this business of sniping at GURPS fans... come now. Is this going to

different ideology but hey... at least they\'re not GURPSers.

Isn\'t this getting too silly for words? I mean, WHO CARES which version of
Traveller we play? It\'s Traveller: SF adventure in the Far Future,

is the definitive version\'. 

I\'d love a Unified Traveller Theory... but there\'s not going to be one
until about TL 12. Until then, I welcome any and all versions of the game.
You can play almost anything with Traveller - that\'s what makes it such a
great game. I DON\'T CARE which rules are used.

All this internal bickering and pretending to shoot one another simply
makes matters worse & breeds ill-feeling. I just use the bits I want and
disregard the rest. Or more likely; buy those bits too to mine them for
ideas.

A little mutual respect would be a fine thing.

No, it doesn\'t.  GURPS Space mentions FTL Communication as an option when
the GM is designing his universe.  Just as you choose what type of FTL drive
your campaign uses, you can also choose whether or not to use FTL Commo, and
how fast/reliable it is.  In the case of Traveller, we won\'t see FTL Commo.
It\'s just that easy.

Regarding using Traveller in other game systems...I am running a Morrow
Project Campaign using Traveller design rules for vehicles, and some
encounters.  It fits for me.

Regarding Gurps: Traveller.  I say more power to to them. While I have
never played Gurps, I know people who have and have seen the product.  It
was mentioned earlier that SJG supports its games, and that is exactly what
is needed.  GDW supported the game too, but since MT focused mainly on
background and not on individual adventures that were playable.  The
majority of the GDW published adventures in the MT/TNE settings placed too
much importance on the players actions with regard to the events on the
macro level.  

IMO, I would love to see a return to the LBB style adventures.

Later,

No need to be snippy.

Hmm, Perhaps the travness was slim.  I will try to refrain from posting
untraveller stuff in the future.  I have, however, posted a lot of On Topic
trav stuff to balance my occasional forays.  I also feel that there was
sufficient content of a useful nature, and your comment is spurious.  There

I did *not* intend to start a "my country tax code is better than yours"
thread, though, only to respond to a statement that was (IMO) not terribly
smart about charging everyone exactly the same amount of money for a tax.

In fact you\'re own country (Sweden) as I understand it, pays huge taxes
(relatively speaking) but also receives much better-and more
egalatarian-services in return than the U.S.  Of course, with one of the
highest per-capita incomes in Europe, you are a bit ahead of the game.

Wait, is the tax level set by formula or by fiat of the nobility?  Is a
system taxed by every level of nobility?  It looks like you mean to say
that each level of dominion taxes the level below it, but doesn\'t care how
that tax is collected within the dominion.

Perhaps we have found the key to why TL advance seems so slow in the
Imperium!  They are all retarding development in order to avoid higher
taxes!  I can just see the crowds roiling through the streets to the
University to tear it down to drop them another tech level, giving them all
a 10% tax cut.

change it too much. Even though, in my opinion, some things NEED a bit of
alteration because the state of the art in SF has kinda passed Traveller by
in some areas...but then, that might be part of the "charm". Power plants
have changed slightly; they use the GURPS model of a plant that doesn\'t need
refuelling for 200 years. Power plant fuel is such an infintessimal part of
the total fuel on a Traveller starship that this makes zero difference. and
they are using GURPS computer rules, which are MUCH better than what
Traveller has had in the past, that I can see. Those are the only
significant changes as I have seen in my recent perusal of the manuscript.

Totally understandable.  Unfortunately, in this instance it isn\'t even as
intelligent a discussion as "Should GDW have done what it did to the
Traveller universe/rules in TNE."  Rather, it sounds like people from
"Android\'s Dungeon and Comic Shop" making rude comments about people who
play a game system they don\'t happen to like, going about it in a childish
manner, and then saying, "Hey, relax!  My little <g> or :) makes anything I
say ok!"

One of the reasons I am drawn to this list is the high level of
intelligence/education present (hey, the same reasons I love Traveller!).
On many occassions I\'ve tried to convince my non-rpger friends that people
who play rpgs/ccgs aren\'t all socially retarded.  "Shoot the GURPS
enthusiasts" posts make me rethink my own position . . .

A very good point.  I\'m afraid I am guilty of jumping subjects.  The
original discussion awhile back related to merchant escorts, this is, as
you point out, only vaguely related to tonnage of military vs. merchant
vessels, if at all.  I am attampting to twist the subject matter to address
a question I need to answer in the near future in a continuin campaign.

Essentially, but see below.

As Jo pointed out in another post, he did not suggest this, only included

This piece of information is generally not that readily available.  A guess
can be made in some circumstances, but in practice there will not be a lot
of reliability to that guess usually.

In our recent tradewar scenario the players knew generally what type of
force is employed by the opposing party.  They did not know what extra
forces might be hired, bought, or imported from a distance.  When the ship
that made them want to run away finally came, it was not on the list of
"expected vessels".

In the case of traders on the Vargr border there will be a range of
possibilities that need to be protected against.

I think that a merchant would expect a certain amount of value for his
money.  By Value I mean the ability of the escort to protect his ship.
That ability seems to me to be diluted when more ships are being protected.


The threat being unknown, or imperfectly known, a larger group of
\'non-combatants\' will be harder to protect than a smaller group since they
will present a larger target, worthy of more \'pirate\' tonnage to capture.

>>What value would they place on it?
>
>2% of the cost of the escort force.

Precisely, yet perhaps they are willing to pay more than that figure for
protection.  If they can get *better* protection (meaning a higher ratio of
escort tonnage to merchant tonnage) they will probably buy it (if
available).

Your logic is sound, but I still think another maximum on convoy size is a
desired ration of escort tonnage to merchant tonnage, as I explained above.
This may not come into play in backwaters since, as you point out,
merchants will pay more rather than wait for a big enough convoy to escort.
That, however, depends on your view of how much shipping occurs in the
Imperium.  A topic I am not ready to discuss right now.

There are some fairly intelligent folks here. We just have a problem with
defensiveness on occasion. All of like Traveller, in whatever form. All of
us were fairly dissapointed with the most recent attempt. So we tend to
defend rather zealously our particular favorite version, because the one
really good version that will unify us all has not come along yet. maybe
T4.1 will do that (although at this point, it should just be called T5), but
somehow I\'m not optimistic.
    My ultimate version of Traveller would be closer to MT than T4, with
perhaps a better task system (the MT one is good but a bit overly complex),
a ship design system closer to QSDS than FF&S, ship combat rules more like
RPSCS, more skills for PC\'s than MT allowed (I thought T4 had that just
about right), No JOT skill (not needed when more skills and a default system
are used), and a straightforward combat system using an Initiative stat. I
would also like to see hit points separated completely from attributes, but
based on them. hit points equal STR +DEX +END, but do not reduce those stats
per se.  Vehicle Design should be as straightforward as possible. I\'m
leaning more in the direction of a system that worries more about game stats
than "real world" values; Volume rated in "spaces" where each space equals a
displacement ton on starship scale, something less in vehicle scale, and you
just plug stuff in to fill the spaces. Give the hard numbers for the
gearheads, but let me design stuff easily and quickly.  Put templates for
playing aliens IN the main book, not make me wait for a supplement that
never shows up. And finally, put two character creation systems in the book;
the random version for those who like that, and a point based build system
for people like me; I can still use the random system to create the history,
but I want full and complete control over what skills I have, what my
attributes are, etc.
    That would be the Traveller that would pull me back from any other
version I\'m playing.

To clarify: what I was suggesting was a  primary  tax  levied  on
planets but with the amount due based on trade volume.  Not a tax
on the traders themselves.  It is up to the local planet\'s rulers
to find a way to fund this (local income tax, sales  tax,  excise
tax, etc).  This gives an independent measure of a world\'s wealth
free of tampering (such as  by  hidden  populations,  fudged  GDP
figures, etc).

Yes, it might encourage a planet to try and limit off-world trade
but only  if  that  tax  burden  is  greater  than  the  cost  of
isolation.  I haven\'t done the figures but I suspect the  average
planet\'s Imperial tax burden to be quite light ...  basically  it
has to cover the cost of the  Imperial  Navy,  the  IISS,  and  a
relatively small  (if  dispersed)  Imperial  buracracy.  Starport
facilities  are  covered  under  berthing  costs  (plus  a  token
Starport Tax) and so are self-sufficient.  The Imperial  Army  is
composed of the off-world contingent of planetary armies  and  so
is not considered in  the  _Imperial_  tax  burden,  neither  are
planetary navies.

Sector and Subsector Dukes must have limited tax powers  ...  the
Fourth Frontier War was fought and concluded before  instructions
from Core could be received.  In the  event  of  wars,  etc,  the
local Imperial government must be able to raise additional  funds
as necessary.  Also, if a world suffers plague or other disaster,
then the local Imperial government must be  able  to  respond  by
temporarily easing an afflicted  world\'s  tax  burden.  This  may
mean just waiving taxes on humanitarian aid, or it may  mean  tax
breaks while the planet\'s economy is being  rebuilt  (depends  on
the generosity of the local nobility).  The Imperium has a policy
of not running a world\'s  _domestic  situation_,  but  its  trade
relations with other worlds is another matter.

Imperial Tax Policy is set by the  Emperor  in  broad  terms  and
worked out in detail by the Sector  and  Subsector  Dukes.  Trade
volumes are monitored by  each  starport\'s  local  SPA  (Starport
Authority) which files reports to  the  Nobility  via  the  IISS.
Smuggling is monitored by each starport\'s local SPA, backed up by
the IISS and the Imperial  Navy.  Anti-smuggling  operations  are
carried out by the Imperial Navy  units,  and  (in  the  case  of
corruption by the planetary  government)  the  JSB  (Ministry  of
Justice, Special Branch).  Survivors are prosecuted  by  the  MoJ
(Ministry of Justice) in Subsector Courts.

At least in theory.  In reality  Imperial  Tax  Policy  would  by
inconsistantly applied across the  Imperium.  Some  nobles  would
squeeze every last credit  out  of  their  worlds,  whilst  other
nobles  take  a  more  enlightened  view  ...  encouraging  local
economies to thrive.  Meanwhile, anti-smuggling operations  would
be complicated by inter-agency rivalry.

The problem with sand, is it wont float in an atmosphere, thus, aerosols.
 FFS2 doesn\'t mention it, so I\'m having to work up numbers on my own.

Ahh, but then you get into the real sticking point of Poll taxes (which
is what this is). This is utterly skewed to benefit the rich at the cost
of everyone else. 

I make minimum wage, supporting a family of three, for instance.  My
proportion of taxes are going to be much higher than a single CEO
making, say, 5 or 6 mill a year. Plus, that CEO is reaping far more
benefit from the tax burden on us all than the poor schlep making
minimum wage. After all the CEO will benefit much more from tax-funded
road improvements, transportation subsidies, diplomatic relations, etc,
etc. This is exactly the point and reasoning for the progressive income
tax: wealthier people benefit more from government spending than do the
poor. Politicians and demagogues rant and rave over \'welfare queens\' ,
but Archer-Daniels-Midland, and it\'s stockholders, has probably gained
more from government givaways than any thousand or so welfare
recipients...(for the non-US folk on the list, ADM is an agribusiness
megacorp; hell, they probably do a lot of business in your country too.)

They make enormous donations to both political parties, all tax
deductible, and recieve, astonshingly, and purely by coincidence,
enormous government contracts and subsidies. Who\'da thunk it??

As I recall, the anti-laser aerosol was a fairly low tech item.  It is only
effective against a specific range of laser frequencies.  Prismatic aerosol is
much high tech and has a correspondingly greater wavelegth coverage.  (as a
caveat, this is from memory - I don\'t have my books with me.)

Before the full strength beam comes, there will be the ranging/targeting laser. 
This is detectable, much like an alarm in a military aircraft cockpit when
sensors pick up a Fire Control radar, as opposed to a search radar.

Don\'t remember the specifics...sorry.  :(  I believe that it negates light (i.e.
man portable) lasers for it\'s duration, and introduces a significant reduction
in damage in others, but Striker/Striker II would probably be the source you
want to refer to, however.

Anti-laser aerosol is a lower tech item, something like talcum in a can,
which makes an opaque cloud that absorbs the energy from lasers. The
disadvantage, of course, is that it\'s opaque to the visual range as
well. In action it would act like a dense smoke screen between you and
the firing laser.

Prismatic aerosols are a higher tech version of the above that
selectively absorb the laser wavelengths, leaving the lower (visible)
wavelengths along, thus allowing you to still see through it.

That\'s the difference.

5) A squad of 30 reporters carrying everything from pencil and paper
   to TL 15 HoloCorders descend, bringing questions about previous
   donations, connections to local Solomani sympathizers, and 
   queries about the "suspiciously high transport costs" in the

   Of course, this is a bit more fun if the characters are already on
   the run, and trying to keep a low profile.  AWOL Marines tend
   to get particularly nervous in these scenarios...

I think it\'s a matter of pirate economics. If there are 
lots of targets, it\'s worth getting a bunch of ships 
together and attacking, so you need more defenders. If 
there are only a few targets, then although you could 
overwhelm them with a bunch of pirate ships, the outlay 
would not be repaid by the expected rewards.

At least that\'s the theory.

In a TU where the ships are worth as much as they are in 
CT, and assuming you can re-register them and sell them for 
a profit of say 30% of their original worth, then the ships are the 
primary targets, and getting a dozen pirate ships together 
to take out a single fat trader might even be worthwhile.

This is probably more true for Vargr, since all they gotta 
do is dodge the patrols on the way in and out, they don\'t 
actually have to live there.

Say 10 400t Vargr "corsairs" take a 400t Fat trader (worth 
about 100Mcr) get a profit of ~30Mcr, or 3Mcr each. How 
long can you pay your operating expenses with that?

   Gee Anders, somebody slip you what most American\'s think is coffee this
morning?

Ob Trav:  I always like the tax code write up I read in some old Traveller
publication.
No taxes, just lotteries.  Lot\'s of them.  Daily lotteries, weeklys,
holiday ones, etc.
Good citizens played several every day.  They would buy a week\'s worth of
daily\'s at a time.
The lottery tickets came with necklace loops.  You wore your color coded
lottery tickets out in public.
The more affluent citizens were expected to buy additional, more expensive
tickets.
If you didn\'t have an up to date set of tickets, you were socially snubbed.
 You couldn\'t get your waitress to take your order, taxi\'s wouldn\'t pick
you up, etc.   Player\'s landing on planet would have to shell out cash for
the right tickets before they could do any business.

Due to the vagaries of jump space they could arrive as much as two days
apart.

Aside: If your PC were in that convoy you just know that the GM is going
to have the escort drop out of jump last "to add to the tension" :)

So the escort would have to jump 2 days before the convoy to be sure of
being there to protect the first ship out of jump. 

And then of course any other trader who was aware of the agreement could
tag along without paying his escort dues. A free loader could jump a few
hours later and still benefit from the escort. Though he runs the risk
of then being taken for a pirate.

IMO an escort would only be of use when jumping to worlds where you
could not trust the system defense boats (SDBs) of the target worlds
(see below).


Has anyone done an analysis of the logistics of piracy/raiding? 

Case 1: Piracy on worlds with no (trustworthy) SDBs.

In this case the pirates hide out on the planet itself and intercept
close to the planet. As long as they have a higher G drive than you do
then they have you. They may have you anyway if you have to dip for
fuel.

So you need an escort for the entirety of the trading mission. You need
to stay together too, or else they can pick you off when you are
separated from the escort.

Case 2: Piracy on worlds with an imperial starport and SDBs.

The trader jumps to the target world and comes out as near to the 100
diameter point as possible. At 1G acceleration, with turnover, it runs
for the highport and makes it in just over six hours, on average.
Quicker if an excellent jump exit roll was made, slower if a poor jump
exit roll was made.

A 6G SDB, stationed at the highport or in orbit, can reach any point
within 100 diameters in 2.6 hours, with turnover. The SDB can do it in
half this time, 1.3 hours, if it does so without turnover, say to make a
strafing run. For a 3G SDB the times are under 4 and 2 hours
respectively.

Note: hiding out beyond the 100 diameter point means that you will be on
average 140 diameters from any jump point (using Pythagoras). 

A pirate hiding out beyond the 100 diameter limit has to intercept,
disable, and then match vectors with, any trader it wants to rob. It
must then rob cargo, etc., and get back out to 100 diameters and jump.
It must be able to do this before any military craft can intercept (i.e.
2 hours max.). Anyone lurking within the 100 diameter sphere is asking
for a visit from Cleons Finest.

To raid a ship jumping into the system:

You need a high G ship (at least 3G) and be within about 20 diameters of
the incoming ships jump exit to stand any chance of success (i.e. about
one in 250 incoming traders would be within range). Also the incoming
ship would have to have a relatively low exit velocity and have only a
1G drive - otherwise you play catch up for too long.  All in all not
very practical.

To raid a ship leaving the system:

You are going to find it very difficult to match velocities as a leaving
ship doesn\'t need to bother with turnover. A 1G ship can reach 100
diameters in around 3 hours without turnover, and is going to be going
very fast at the 100 diameter point (around 80 000 km/h). 

So there is very little hope of normal interception - and even if there
was the trader would probably jump inside 100 diameters rather than risk
capture. Your only hope is to remain hidden at the 100 diameter point.
Then when he is within laser range disable him with the first salvo
before he can jump. Ordinarily you would have to be very lucky to be in
the right place to achieve this. Much less than one in 250 ships will
come close enough for this. So only really practical if you have a
corrupt space traffic controller assigning the exit vectors. And the
authorities will assume this has happened afterwards and be grilling the
controller.

Even if you manage to disable the ship you then have to match velocities
and chase the ship down for nearly two hours (at 3G), unload it and then
jump immediately. 

Conclusion:

All this leads me to conclude that an extra G of maneuver drive is much
more useful than a second laser turret. Perhaps even more useful than
your first turret? A high G drive makes you much less attractive to
potential molesters than does a standard turret.

Well, everyone has games they don\'t like and I won\'t presume to question
Keven\'s likes.  I will point out that you don\'t need a bunch of
expansion rulebooks to have playable system.  GURPS Traveller will be
play just fine with just the Basic rule book.  You could even just
down load the free version of GURPS Lite to start (I would\'t be suprised
if you could get by with just that for quite decent length of time).
Heck, I _wrote_ an article a few years back on GURPS Traveller that
only relied on two GURPS Space and GURPS Basic (and I didn\'t really
need space).  What I got out of space (weapons, starship design) will
be in the GURPS Travaller book.

Here\'s where piracy becomes "reasonable".  The Starport is on a moon of
a large gas giant.  This moon is very close to the GG, perhaps only a
few diameters out.  Pirates hide on a different moon/asteroid.  When a
starship passes by, they snatch it.  Maneuvering at high speeds through
the orbital masses of a gas giant is dangerous.  If you come in too
fast, you may not be able to escape the pull of the gas giant.  Then
you\'re really screwed.

Actually, it IS possible to coordinate a jump so that the ships pop out
within hours/minutes of each other.  In one of the Traveller\'s Digests there
is an article explaining how this is possible.  If anyone is really
interested, I can look it up.

  So, you\'re saying that you\'re recombining the CO2 and the rest of the fiber
back into carbohydrates. TNSTAFFL. Yes, this can be done.  But I believe its
called plant growth.  It requires moderately large tanks relative to the size
of the creature its supporting.  It does however refresh your air and could
provide you with vegetable biomatter.

This actually brings up the question.  Once you\'ve got a biosystem going, how
much of a "garden" do you need to support one human indefinitely?  Including
carbon dioxide recycling and food.  Assume unlimited supply of energy (light)
and recycled water.

As I recall -- and I don\'t have my books with me, either -- lasers
change to x-ray above TL 13, so prismatic aerosols are needed to disrupt
them.  (or something like that)

IMTU, If you pick up a SOS/Mayday/Signal GK you must respond.  Until the
emergency is abated, your own ship is in peril, or a Naval/System Defense vessel
indicates that it has assumed control of the emergency.  By requiring all
vessels to respond, it prevents a pirate from signalling that it is responding
to the emergency.

Emergency signals are automatically entered in the ship log, and flagged. 
Subsequent actions are subject to review during routine ship\'s inspections.

This is mandated by Imperial Law, and is one of the reasons all ships are
\'permitted\' to have ship\'s weapons.

Its maritime law I believe.  Unless you work out the deal over the radio, anyone
responding may claim salvage rights.  That means that if you send out a request
for aid, respondants may claim your ship as payment.

I have my own hobby-horse, which happens to be the Islands Clusters.  I\'ve
had a campaign set there since TCS came out, but I only recently became
aware that the Regency sourcebook addressed the fate of those two subsectors.

My questions are these:  will the Sourcebook be confined to the Spinward
Marches per se, or will they encompass the Domain of Deneb, as the Regency
Sourcebook did?  if you are doing bits of the Spinward Marches Sourcebook
for GT, is anyone doing the Islands Clusters?  Who is in overall charge?
There are some serious inconsistencies between TCS and the Regency
Sourcebook that I\'d rather not see carried over to any new material.

Once again, I ask the list at large:  does anyone know how to contact B.
David Nilsen, who authored the Regency Sourcebook?  I\'d really like to ask
him whether the discrepencies I\'ve found were intended as corrections, or
merely in error.

Why have cold cuts when u can make yourself a real steak (it will need

There are "zoom wombs" that can do the cloning pretty fast.  It\'s a few weeks
to grow a full human body to maturity.  I suspect a sirloin would take far
less.

I meant using the same process they use for making cold cuts to make faux-steak.
You just process up a bunch of protein rich biomatter in a tank with
preservatives.  Then you extrude it out into the form, texture, and color you
want.  Voila!  Steak... or a reasonable facimile... well, reasonable for military
purposes.

"A few weeks" sounds awefully fast for a human body.  The natural method takes
about 2 weeks an ounce.  I really doubt that technology is going to improve that
by a factor of two to three thousand.  And you can\'t grow a "sirloin", you\'ve got
to grow the whole cow.  Just like you can\'t clone an arm or eye, you\'ve got to
grow the whole body then transplant.

  I think that depends on the type of weapon.  PAWs would probably rip the person
apart in the magnetic field. Meson Guns would do the same thing as they have to
accelerate the particals to get mesons in the first place.  I don\'t think that a
person\'s mass would be sufficient to cause a misfire though.  However, I think a
person\'s mass may be enough to screw up the ranging on a Meson gun.  In neither
case would it cause damage to the firing ship.

	Sounds like it. I wasn\'t going to grab straight out of it, of
course, but I like the idea of being able to model any desired effect
consistently. I always loathed, despised and abhorred the so-called
magic system in D&D. BTW, note that they never said nobody had spell
books. In fact, casting a spell somebody else has designed and
written down was easier than creating one from scratch, and casting
one you\'d mastered (succesfully cast several times before) was even
easier. I always assumed everybody had spells, but in a tight crunch
you might be able to come up with something new. And at least there
was none of this "you may only know one spell, and once you cast it,
you forget it until a day later" crap from D&D.

	It takes more than one pound of input to produce one pound of output
... at both stages of the process. One pound of beef into a passenger
comes out as less than a pound of "output"--and it takes more than a
pound of "output" into the food system to produce a pound of beef.
Sorry, you still gotta carry stuff. Such closed loop systems are
*only* really efficient at much larger scales and longer timeframes,
where you recycle the top of the food chain back into the bottom
(i.e. "soylent green is peepul!").

	Bzzzt! Not entirely correct. I believe that at *current* TLs we are
already capable of cloning certain tissues without growing the whole

figure out how much space is needed for crops to sustain a person
indefinitely in a closed system.  It turns out to be on the order of 350
square meters of planted surface per person. I figure that with half
meter tiers, you can squeeze that into about 175 kL (12.5 dT).  This
assumes a couple things.
1. Ship is properly equipped to maintain the crop.
2. Sufficient light can be maintained through the fusion plant.
3. Water is recycled through the ship back to plants.
4. CO2 is cycled through the plants thus refreshing the air.

The typical setup would involve high conversion algae in tanks to
convert the CO2. The Japanese have buildings with this feature now.  The
rest would be combinations of hydroponics and racks of plants under
controlled lights.  You would definitely need some sort of
farmer/botanist/dietician for this setup.  Eventually, you\'d also need
to resupply for flavouring and various other materials.  But, in theory,
you could go years with this setup without resupplying.

This setup would be common in vaccuum worlds, belter colonies,
exploration ships, etc. This takes up a sizable amount of a ship\'s
volume.  The 400 dT subsidized merchant doesn\'t have enough cargo space
to be converted for its crew of 9 as an example.

If anybody has better numbers, let me know.  I\'m sure we\'d all
appreciate it.

  The above (including all the snipped stuff) seems inarguable and

  This one (the low cost) has already caused non-reusable tanks to

  IIRC you conclusively modelled refined fuel as being unable to sell

  It looks sound. Would the next step be guesstimating the replacement
rates of tonnage by major corps, because those units would be the ones
most likely to switch to "high-capacity" format.

No the poverty level women would owe five times as much as the
(presumably childless) millionare as kids are not exempt from the tax. 
If the mother wished to avoid her children being sanctioned she would
probably choose to pay their taxes.  Naturally a lifting of unjust
restrictions on child labor would help the children to pay their own way
and a lifting of parental legal responsibility to care for their
children would ensure that parents who chose not to care for their
children would not have to.  [Implicit Darwinian premise - If you do not
want to care for your children, I want your children to die off before
they can breed as I do not wish to see these genes perpetuate
themselves.]

Children are a consumption expense of their parents, who gain the
hedonic pleasure of their company and the genetic value of ensuring that
their genes are passed on.  They do not benefirt me, I generally prefer
killing children over having to pay increased taxes because others pay
less due to tax subsidy of children.

I would prefer not to here arguments based on the notion that children
are our future.  The future has certainally never done anything to
support me and I see _no_ reason why I should support the future.

Yes, so ?

Government is, in economic terms, a good or service.  Few or no other
goods or service cost a percentage of income.  Why should government ?

Yes and this is one of its better features.  Not only is a percentage
system unjust when viewed as the purchase price of the good or service
of government but ensuring that the burden on the rich is less in a
better system anyway.  The poor, due to lesser human capital, do not
serve as efficient agents for the creation of wealth (which is how
societies become prosperous) but the rich do.  Ensuring that people keep
all of their earnings over Y thousand dollars is a pwerfull incentive
for people to make more money.  When people earn more, they spend more,
this increased spending is "A rising tide which lifts all boats"
including those of the poor.

So you can see that the system must have months and that 480 of them
make up 40 years.  I note that ship crew salarys are also paid monthly
and always have been.

Who says that the month is a way to subdivide the year.  It is as valid
to consider the month a way of grouping the day and the week rather than
of subdividing the year.  If the month has 28 days it will always have
exactly 4 weeks in it and each month will begin and end on the same day
of the year, every year. 

However since canon says that 40 years have 480 months in them I will
concede that each year must have 12 months in it.  Although I am tempted
to just increase the number of payments to 520, shorten the 40 year
morgage to 37 years, or rule that during the annual maintenance month no
starship payment is due (note that this ensures that the ship is more
likely to have the money for maintenance & therefore that maintenance is
more likely to occur, thereby protecting the banks multi million credit
investment from misjump, so this is not really the bank being
altruistic).

Yes if dividing the year is what you want to use your months for.

It could be argued that the use of months is a mistake but it has been
word for word consistent for 2o0 years now, so I am inclined to beleive
it is correct.

This is a nice calender for seperating the year up into quarters and 
(approximate) twelths but it does nothing to aggregate days and weeks
into consistent groups.

The obvious response is where the objective conditions make piracy
possible, you have a higher investment in escort forces.

The second point is dont gas giants have brutal electromagnetic fields that
make settlements on moons near them unlikely ?

Peter, have you read Swift\'s "A Modest Proposal" ?

First of all, debt is faster to raise than taxes. If, for example, the IN
needs a couple of dozen gigacredits to support a war, then it just writes
IOUs, which will be backed by the Imperium as and when time permits. It\'s a
lot easier than declaring the new tax, and then actually getting the money
off them.

With the big issue, I should have been a bit more specific ... what happens
if a world disputes their tax rates, claiming high level corrpution
perhaps, and wont pay up at the new rates ?

Wait a second ... smuggling implies the taxation and/or banning of
commodities. Off the top of my head, I can think of only nukes, slaves and
(perhaps) military weapons as Imperially Discouraged items of commerce.

Purely an accidental shot, I can assure you.

Yes. This process is commonly known as The Great Piracy Debate of 1997.

If you assume the IN takes a hard line against state-supported piracy, this
could get very unhealthy for the host planet very fast.

All true. Relativly cheap passive sensors in FFS2 have very long ranges,
and fighters are pretty cheap and even useful against ethically-challenged
civilians. Any ship hanging around with no real business gets a \'hello\'
from the Space Patrol in my book.

You also have the problem of response via 12g missiles from the starport,
but I havent done the numbers on this.

The risk is also there that they will turn him beforehand, and you will
find the intended victim to be rather better armed and armoured than you
thought.

True, but it leads me to the assumption that piracy just isnt going to
happen without the at least passive co-operation of the local government.
And this is damn unhealthy within the Imperium.
