More than a couple. There are at least 4 more that I don\'t recall at
the moment.

BTW, with regards to the "kobolds" thread elsewhere on the list, I
think Fuzzies would be a fun race to work up. They *may* be a bit less
intelligent than humans, but that\'s not a big handicap. 

They\'d make good scouts, and they\'d also probably like engineering.
They might not understand the *theory*, but they\'d be great at doing
maintenance and repairs. Especially given that they can work
comfortably in spots a human mechanic would be lucky to *see* into.

All changes in state of energy invlove entropic loss of some kind; ie: you
never EVER get out as much as you put in. The higher the entropy of the
source form, the more lost in converting it to a less entropic form, and
the more side effects produced in the conversion.

Yes, it is theoretically possible to convert heat to an IR laser, but the
by products will be some other form of radiation, and the laser will have
far less energy than the heat applied, and by the rules of entropic loss,
you\'re gonna have some other wierd radiations in the process, assuming that
since you\'re putting out IR as the primary, and forcing it to lase in a
chamber or crystal. Thus, you need to convert molecular motion into
electromag radiation (doable, as it is a low to very low order situation),
then lase it. So, you\'ll need a chamber which is either non-absorbtive of
IR (so it cannot convert back to molecular motion, ie heat), or is not in
contact with anything, and more than likely, the process will wind up with
the energy loss translating into a rapid degeneration of ther mechanism by
heating, or will result in other radiations or another very-low order
situation (and that laser will be a high order situation)

Damage is applied in the exact same manner as in vehicular combat, except
for meson guns.

In short, look up the pen and atten and damge stats from the MT PM pg 80.
Figure the damage taken just like you would for personal or vehicular
combat (keeping in mind that there is errata that says the hits
capabilities generated by the craft design system need to be multiplied by
10). So you check attenuation, find effective pen. Compare pen to AV  to
get multiplier:
	EfPen < AV= No (DmgMult 0.1),
	AV <= EfPen < 2x AV = low (Dmg Mult 0.5)
	EfPen >= 2x AV = High (Dmg Mult 1).
Find success level on to hit task to get success level mods
	Made by			 0    1   2   4   8
	DamMult			0.5   1	  2   4   8
	minimum final damage	 0    0   1   2   4

Multiply base damage by both damage multiples (from pen level and th task
success), and rais to minimum if needed. Note: Many choose to apply the
sequence slightly out of order: BsDmg x TH Multiple, raise to minimum,
apply pen multiple.

also, the weapons list for starhip weapons only shows certain key TL\'s
(which differ from the key ones in the design sequences), but can be easily
figured for the interveneing steps.

Meson Guns should use a much different result system. Increase to hit task
by one diff level.
	Roll made by:		  0    1    2    4    6    8   10
	Dice to roll for mishap:  -   1d   2d   3d   4d   5d   6d
In addition, all hits will do a proportion of the damage points. a minimal
hit (no dice to roll) should do about 1d6 dp per factor. For better hits,
roll on mishap table, using the indicated number of dice. on superficial,
1d6% dp loss.
Minor, 1d6 * 5% of DP lost. Major 1d6 * 10% loss (which with high rolls
will run you out of DP on a first hit), and Destroyed results get you 2d6 x
15%. All percentage losses are rolled per system with DP\'s anmd are based
upon total DP\'s (both sides of the slash) of the UNDAMAGED unit.

But the Oort Cloud discussion started with a pirate base out there, which
is (a) larger, and (b) must have pirates coming and going (or it\'s not
really a base, eh?).

A base, whether for a pirate band or just a supply dump for a single ship,
should eventually be discovered. The only question is when.

Bruce, I know this is a big favour, but could you crunch the numbers to
provide guidelines about how many visits a base could have before it was
probably detected? I suppose variables would be TL/size/wealth of
detecting navy, and signature of pirate base/ships. We\'ll also need a
reasonable assumption for the energy/frequency bandwidth of the jump flash.

Actually, long-term sensor use (strategic sensors?) woul make a nice
addition to the Definative Sensor Rules.

Thanks. George and I are proud of the Sydkai. Hm, as Roger hasn\'t paid us
for the article yet (we were waiting for DGP to publish AI), does that
mean we could resell it?  Bloo, any legal advice on who owns the copyright
to a commissioned work that was never paid for?

In one the the TNE novels (think it was Death of Wisdom), a character
refers to Kinunirs as Bombardment Cruisers. Apparently they were intended
to overawe and control small worlds without space defenses.

Remember that those deep meson sites need targeting data, and those

much have to be on or near the surface.  I think a heavily-stealthed

A great idea.  Anyone out there know, would ELF transmissions be 
sufficient to pass along targetting data?  I don\'t know.

IMO, considering the evidence presented in the books, the Fuzzies
may have been _more_ intelligent. Dropped in the middle of a planet
full of big predators and few usable food sources, the fragile little
fellows survived. Faced with a First Contact situation, they made
friendly relations and allies before the language barrier was even
broken. As adults, they learned an alien tongue - spoken at a
wavelength they generally don\'t speak in - with relative ease.
Add to that the complete failure of a professional psychiatrist to
cause lasting mental aberrations in a Fuzzy, no matter how he
tried. Longer term evidence of their inborn mental stability: they\'ve
been living for generations with horrible predators and a chemical
imbalance that makes most of their babies be horribly twisted
stillbirths, yet they still play, laugh and love each other.

They\'re sane, friendly and resourceful. Piper created a race
that I hope we encounter some day - because if nothing else,
Fuzzies seemed to have a talent for bringing out the best in
humans.

Hmmm, I think my enjoyment of Piper\'s "Little Fuzzy" books
is showing... <G>

Was the Sydkai the Anti-Piracy vessel published in MTJ#3 by several
authors, one of which was TML\'s own Rob Prior? I really found that
vessel to be interesting. I was also disappointed that the illustration
didn\'t seem to match the description. I seem to remember a revolving
small craft loading mechanism but didn\'t see that the drawing matched.
As I recall, it was a weak performance design, optimized for duration on
station.

younger?
***************
it should cost more....how much more will affect the prices of used ships
as well.



Some of the discussions on how a pirate supports himself are
relevant here as well. Can someone scrounge or improvise
cheap replacements for life support materials and maintenance
requirements?
*************
you would have to for this to work. If you are using GT you can do the work
yourself and only pay for parts.
that could cut the costs down to normal.


A Free Trader can easily hold three pairs of adults and a couple
kids for each pair. If it has no bank payment any more, the price
of running this ship for a year would be about Cr520000 for
life support, plus the cost of the annual maintenance, plus
any berthing fees at starports, plus any damage or unexpected
equipment failures - that annual maintenance on your jump drive
has never been described in canon as including a warranty.
*****************
if you are running GT the costs can be different...the big costs are
docking fees and annual maintainance

so for a free trader  20KCr each time she docks, and 28.8KCr for annual
maintainance so if you dock at a regualr starport every two weeks it is
about 550KCr a year....however if you spend most of your time on frontier
worlds and only hit a regular starport every 3-4 months your costs can be
under 10KCr month....These numbers assume you skim your own fuel.


if you look at the annual maintainance as yearly costs for food and housing
it is only 2400Cr a month. Not bad for a 10 bedroom house with food for 20.

295-1120 Vincennes/Deneb (1122-A899AA6-G)

X-TEK is proud to announce the release of the new XG-13 "Mega" Thruster.
This new technology was considered "classified" during the 5FW, but has
now been declassified by the IN.
The new thruster unit provides nearly 5 times the thrust power and reduces
size by 1/4.

But the Megathruster is not for everyone, yet.

As with all new technologies, the Megathruster is expensive.  X-TEK must
charge 6.25Mcr for its basic "powered" unit.
Also, Megathruster technology is very power hungry, even though the
thruster in the basic module is 4 times as small as its TL-12 counterpart,
the rest of the module is devoted to the fusion power unit.  X-TEK R&D is
currently looking for smaller and cheaper power units to use with this new
technology, with major research into Antimatter reactors.

Also, care must be taken not to install too many megathruster units, TL-13
technology can provide gravatic compensation for up to 7g\'s after that,
the pilot, crew, and passengers will feel the effects of high
acceleration.

So far the only place to upgrade to the new thrusters are on Vincennes.

Statistics:
TL-13 Mega Thruster (Powered)
500tons thrust;  5.75t;  6.25Mcr
Includes:
100cf of MegaThruster; 0.75t;  6mcr;   Requires 50Mw Power
200cf of Fusion Plant;  5t;  0.25Mcr
200cf of Power Plant Access Space.

TL-13 Mega Thruster (Unpowered)
2500tons thrust  3.75t 30Mcr 250Mw

Ships planed to be produced by X-TEK using this technology:
"Hornet-III" Space Superiority Fighter
"Silverbolt" Class Intruder Scouts
Fast Traders and Cargo Haulers.
Fast Troop Transports and Boarding Craft.
and many, many, more...

This concludes this press release from X-TEK Industries of Deneb, LIC.

Actually, I did read the Armageddon Inheritance, liked it,and recycled
it (sold it back) to pick up In Death Ground. Poor deal, maybe I should
try to get it back. It\'s tough trying to afford the current stuff with
spare change.

I can understand why such great condition used copies are easy to find.
After reading Weber\'s stuff, only about half is likely to be reread by
me. I\'ll keep the HR series.

The only SF regularly reread by me is  Piper, Anderson, Niven,
Pournelle, Asimov, Heinlein, Cherryh, Cole and Bunch (in approximate
order of preference).

I actually rather liked that. It was uncomfortable but more interesting
than the "Sten and Kilgour are dispatched to deal with the latest threat
to the Empire" plotline. That\'s a series I was sorry to see end. 

BTW, should I read In Enemy Hands out of order. I\'ve read 1,2,3,4
already. I guess I should say should I stop reading In Enemy Hands now
while I still can. ;-)

If it\'s just a wideband radio message, then yes, you can be anyone you want
to be, at least on your transponder.
If that\'s true, then why have a transponder at all?
**************8
because with the least effective sensors and a skill of 12 you can detect a
transponder on a 16 or less at 10,000 hexes. (just over one AU)...and a 10
or less at 100,000 hexes (about 11 AU).  A transponder will scream at
everyone

Not at once, but the Imperium had three in rapid succession in 979-1002.  
The 3FW in 979-986, a coup that forced the abdication of Styryx for his
son in 989, and the Solomani Rim War in 990-1002.

Arguably, the Imperium either lost or regained a chunk of its border in
this war, depending on your point-of-view.  (The Imperium considered the
Solomani Sphere an autonomous region from 740 to 940, even after the SAR
declared itself the Solomani Confederation in 871.  They revoked the SAR
charter in 940, but spent years trying to make a diplomatic solution.  
The SRW didn\'t even start until the Solomani started reabsorbing border
worlds!)

Two problems with that scenario:

1) How do you jump _in_ at the Oort Cloud? That\'s so far beyond the 100
dia limit it\'s not funny, like jumping into an empty hex. Can this be done?

2) If you\'re attacking, you _still_ gotta come in on maneuver drive,
which will take a long time, and get you noticed when you get in closer,
probably right about at the limits where you\'ld be pegged jumping
normally in-system, so detection time won\'t necessarily be halved.

The law of conservation of energy.  Heat in = some heat out + some
electricity out.  Total power in = total power out.  It\'s a non nuclear
process based on junction heating as in a thermal couple.  A comon every day
device that does this same thing.  There is no repealing the law to
thermaldynamic.  It proves it.  Efficency is not 100%.  Conducters of power
are also heat radiaters but total heat is reduced while total power is
maintained in verious forms.  It\'s the same process as steem generation of
electricity in a different form.  Body heat into electricity.  There is
waste throughout the system but it does reduce RADIATED heat which it the
goal.  Just as insulation does not decrease total energy it increases time
of change and decreases radiation at any given instant. 
 You\'re are over simplefyng the model.  Remember that molecular motion is
included in the model and can be used for work.  If this is engored quite a
few of the physical laws start to appear to break down.  If you egnore the
light emited, then a incadesent light bulb breaks thermaldynamics.  Power
takes many forms not all of them are readily apparent.

Read up a little on juction excitation.  As in thermal couples.  It\'s a well
known and docmented present day technology.  If the above were true then how
do you explain solar cells?  The device I am discribing is in effect a IR
tuned solar cell.  Again this does not break either consevation of energy or
thermaldynamics any more than solar cells do.  They convert one type of
energy into another type of energy at less than 100% efficency.  Power does
not come from nowhere nor does it go into nowhere.  I work with heat
recovery systems regularly, are you trying to tell me they to are imposible?
I did not ever say that the system way 100% effecient but with a difference
of 200-300k power out will be significant and heat radiated will be reduced
as system heat is reused to product elctricity that will then not have to be
drawn from batteries that then will not release heat.  The system will
quickly balence at some level of reduced demand from the batteries and total
heat signature will be decreased due to increased total efficency.  It will
not reach 0 but the reduction in radiation will make the ship\'s hull less warm.

Where do you see a problem?  I do not fathom it.  These devices exist today.
Power output and efficency (about 14% is bleeding edge for solar last I
read) are low just like solar cells but are improving (solar cells are
begining to include a similar technology in their newest designs to get more
power by using more of the light spectrum).

I design heat recovery system controls.  They cut power use in steam
generation.  They do not reduce it to zero.  Savings can be on the order of
20% in winter and 10-12% in summer.  Are you telling me that a 20%+
reduction in power use will not decrease heat signature?  Are you trying to
tell me that a heat gradiant or 300k is not enough to do usefull work?  I
work with a far smaller gradiant of about 80-100k.  If nothing else use the
heat to boil a gas like nitrogen or hydrogen to power a turbine to produce
power.  This would make a good single stage of heat recovery system for our
stealth ship.  Use the space between the hulls as you LHY tank an use the
pressure from heating to power that generater.  This reduces the power
needed to be drawn from batteries reduceing waste heat from the batteries.
Two or three layers of recovery will increase efficency dramatically which
will reduce total power use and signature plus slow the speed at which the
outer hull has to dump heat.

I do this for a living people.  Heat does not come from nowhere.  It is a
waste product of power used for doing work.  Reduce power use, increase
efficency, and you reduce waste heat.  A simple simi-closed system.  You
still have to draw power from the batteries to counter system losses but
those losses are less and those losses are your signature.  Lower loss=lower
signature.

So it would be easily visible in orbit?  Or would atmospheric condition make

"Not as well equipped or trained" does not mean "next to useless for anti
piracy." If the difference is TL 14 BBs v. TL 15 BBs (or cruisers, or
whatever), then I would say that the Colonial fleets are more than adequate
to deal with pirates. After all, Defense CruRon Regina (the SDB example in
_FSSI_) is a *CruRon*.

Nor are reservist or colonial units necessarily incompetent, which is what
the first statement above implies. They are simply not front-line units.
"Somewhat less training and experience" could be Gunnery 3 instead of
Gunnery 4, for example.

I thought this too at first, and was about to respond "Well Hans, that
could be 30 combatants and 20-170 auxiliaries."

However, since the 50-200 number was talking about squadrons within the
subsector fleets (the latter of which they defined as part of the
1,000-ship combatant sector fleet), it is reasonable to assume that this
number includes combatants only.

You\'d jump from there into the system. Say you have to do a J4 to
get to a certain system to attack. Do a J4 to their oort cloud, but
with tankers that can mine for fuel (the tankers are stretched out
for fuel, too, in this case). Refuel all the ships. Do a J1 into the
main part of the system. Attack, etc.

If the attack succeeds the tankers come in (a courier is sent to
bring \'em in system since the light lag is longer than a jump). If
the attack is failing, the ships still have plenty of fuel to jump
back out to the tankers, who can top \'em off for the J4 to friendly
space.

This sensitivity number, what are the units? lumins?  Color temp?  Or is it
a gaming number from the sensor rules?  I\'ve seen it now several times and
have yet to see a units notation.

Pricey!  Wonder what the resale value of that would be for a pirate...

Why steal a shutle with 2 250,000Mcr satalites just waiting to be grabed?
Or are they stations?  Crew rotation would take a jump capable ship for a
station but it\'s doable.  Say a 3 month on, 3 month off duty schedule with
one full spare crew to fill in for sickness or injury.

Not a bad idea.

This makes no sense. The ship is using 20MW, rejecting 80MW. That
means that all the wires and devices are (on average)20% efficient
(some more, some less as you\'d expect). You throw in a thermocouple
to get more electricity--but the assumption is that the whol;e ship
is already at room temperature. So *any* heat added to the system
(resistance in the wires, right?) brings the ship\'s temp up. Soon
room temp in the scout is 25C, then 30... The 80 MW has to be
radiated, even if you use it all first all 100MW of power must leave
the ship. All the time. You luck out if the majority of power use is
drives/weapons since they both project power out of the ship.
Anything that doesn\'t do this need to be radiated, regardless of
what you do with it for the short term (and meanwhile, the drive is
still pumping out 100MJ/s.

Basically, the radiated power is equal to the generated power,
period. Some radiates through the hull. Some from the actual
radiators, and some from devices that actually get rid of power
(drives, lasers, PAWs, etc.).

POwer generated must be radiated. Period. The problem in traveller
is that there is way too much power. There is a ton of handwaving
just to radiate all that is now.

Very amusing.

It probably needs a different name than "cutter" or "launch" (which I tend
to associate with things capable of longer indepndent operations - this
only has 16 G-hours of fuel, so it\'s incapable of interplanetary ops).
And I\'d put in a contra-grav so you can land it without setting fire to 
plants. Maybe "barge" or "skiff" is the right word.

Pity it got slightly too big to fit in the launch tubes...

I think I lack the time to explore all of the parameter space involved...
although I could try and do one case. You don\'t even really need me, though;
the rules are all in the DSR. A couple of issues to keep in mind...

- -the base itself, since it\'s attached to a Big Honking Hunk of Ice, is probably
pretty much undetectable (it gets all the bonuses for landed and camoflaged,
etc) unless it has gigawatts of power coming out (which it shouldn\'t)

- -the pirate ships will take a while to rendezvous with the base (since
thrusters don\'t work well out in the Oort cloud) unless they have HEPlaR 
aux engines (which would be surprisingly easy to detect), so the pirates
probably do have to spend a day or two at full power to do the rendezvous (opr
even a week, if thrusters work at 1/100 or 1/1000 that far out.) 

- -no-one has ever really defined for me how bright a "jump flash" is, or what
wavelengths it comes out at, which is why they aren\'t in the rules. I don\'t
like jump flashes that much myself - ships are easy enough to see as it is,
and I would like spies to be able to jump in and out without being instantly
detected . . . but if someone gives me numbers I can put them in. 

>Actually, long-term sensor use (strategic sensors?) woul make a nice
>addition to the Definative Sensor Rules.
A week\'s worth of searching adds about +1 (+0.5 for one-day scans, +0.5 
because you scan only 30 degree arcs.) (Oops - make that two weeks.) 
For simplicitly, you could instead assume that the sensor detects everyting
out to (sensitivity+signature)=0.0 with no modifiers if you don\'t want to have
to roll...

I can just see it now; the boat approaches the pirate ship and is queried
by the ship\'s security officer with a password to ensure the victim\'s
crew didn\'t take the ship\'s boat and are trying to board:

Security Officer:  "Leaping Chihuahua, ID check: \'Yo quiero...\'"

cept you\'re using gravitational force, not tidal force, and thus wind up with
jump distance proportional to the square root of mass rather than the cube

I belive you need to double the access space for long occupancy, and that

GVe 2ed 14 access space  powered propulsion systems and powerplants (unless

that matches exactly....

the regular thrusters (per ton) are

  FWIW, I\'m far from sure that Free Traders would be implausible in the
Core. Although the majority of trade would be in larger, scheduled ships
there may always be some left-overs in the larger trade volumes, and any
world that doesn\'t have such a ship leaving every day or two is a good
prospect for picking up some sort of urgent freight, passengers, or a nice
load on spec that the networks won\'t handle in time due to contracts and
routing. Of course, the further out you go the more such cracks there
should be.

  As for piracy, it\'s the concept of an on-going career in any region with
detectable trade flows that I\'m having trouble explaining credibly - if you
smuggle and cheat at cards but simply wait for the perfect chance (which
may never come) OK, but if you try and take a cargo every month or whatever
then eventually you\'re going to get nailed - and if you\'re not doing it far
from the trade nexuses then I don\'t believe you\'ll last long either.

Well, the jump flash properties could be features of the individual drives rather
than a law of nature.  Thus you could get "stealth" drives that have virtually no
jump flash, while cheaper drives lack the baffles and enter the system like a
supernova.  One could even presuppose that each ship has its own jump signature.

  I agree that the cash flow is there, although I suspect that the long
term risk from attrition is too high to validate a career. Thus I try
to figure out how they could grab a starship and sell it to retire.

  I\'m not sure that I follow the various Law O mentions (including 
someone else\'s assertion that you build your warships there - although
payment still hasn\'t been figured out); do low Law level worlds not
enforce Imperial law? Are they exempt from law-suits or criminal
prosecution for aiding and abetting pirates and murderers? If so, then
nukes are presumably available at fairly modest prices there.

True...I think I made the assumption that the jump flash is equal in brightness
to the amount of energy required to go into jump (one hour * power input of
jump drive).  Of course, given 20 minute turns that\'s really not all that
visible, though one might assume that stealthing doesn\'t apply to it.

Well, using TL 9 technology, I\'ll lay a fiber-O grid across the ocean
floor; and splice it up with sonar commo transducers. The ends go ashore
to a highly dispersed detection array (made up of mobile & fixed/hidden)
sensors.

Targetting info comes from the array, into the fiber-o grid and then by
gertrude to the subs. The subs are passive at all times.

In a word, no. As I suggested in an earlier message, use a seafloor grid
of communications stations if you want offboard targetting - or, as
another list memeber suggested - tow a buoy with a targetting system on
it.

CVX as a revolutionary platform has been canned. Instead, the USN is
going for an evolutionary design. Why? It\'s cheaper.

ObTrav: Note that the biggest proportion of ships in FSSI are
evolutionary designs.

  I was waiting for an inspection boat this small to be designed - if
you can do 6 or 8 ton fighters I don\'t see why not, for short hauls.
Admittedly, for SDB basing you might as well build bigger, more capable
units as the crew quarter requirement on the mother ship adds up a bit
too fast for economy\'s sake.

Looks like I didn\'t know the bit about vectored thrusters.  I was working
with G:Vehicles and Anthony Jackson\'s module system, but noticed that the
values were a bit different from those on the chart.  I did notice a
factor 1.5, and wondered what it was.  I corrected my chart accordingly
for weight and price, but not for volume.  Now I know what the problem
was, I didn\'t RTFM! (smacks forhead).  That\'s what I get for working late
at night. 

Also I knew about the access space for fusion plants, but not for
thrusters, makes sence I guess.  Looks like rule of thumb is take any
drive or PP and multi by 3 for volume.

I have only one last question, how did you derive the price?  I came out
with 4.5Mcr for the entire powered unit.

if 2500tons thrust =30MCr,  then 1ton thrust = 0.012Mcr
therefore 360tons thrust = 4.32Mcr

  Wasn\'t the failure of the Zho\'s to stop attrition to raiders behind
their lines in Regina listed in the FFW TNS as a big factor in the
resulting stalemate? If so then Imperial anti-commerce (and anti-sweep)
tactics seem fairly effective, and anti-piracy is much closer to those
function than battle line drill is.

  Grabted - it\'s just that there\'ll be a cut-off where an individual
carries the balance in non-negotiable instruments; a businessman might
carry Cr 2000 in cash, have a credit transaction for a local bank for 
KCr 100, and a inter-institutional document guaranteeing the down-payment
on the new mining/prospecting spaceship they\'ll need piggy-backed to
their own (lower-tech?) system. Carrying KCr 500 in bearer bonds is a
disaster if you even lose your luggage*.

  (heh - players are prepared for piracy - but how closely do they watch
their bags in starport bars? :> )

  I\'m not touching the banking bit except to say that luckily most
Imperials never leave their home systems, and that presumably the
banks computers will be capable enough to deal with most of the mess.

  Is there really much difference in practice between a HEPLAR and
CT-era "thruster" equipped ship? It was fairly rare for most ships
to try near-light cruises, and missiles (and small craft in Mayday)
already had burn limits.

Actually that\'s a fairly high energy density.  More than FM radio signals
that your car radio can pick up if it\'s any good.  The sun has a huge power
output in the visible light spectrum but even those power levels drop below
the threshold of detectability.  There are stars we know exist that our eyes
can\'t see.  They are below the thresshold of our eyes detectablity and no
matter how long you look at them, you will not see them.  That is what I

A scouts surface area can not radiate that kind of power.  The ship would
melt!  Space is the untimate vacume bottle.  Radiation is the only way to
get rid of heat and it is the worst way.  There is a limit to how much a
given area can radiate.  150MW would liquify tons of steel! or boil milions
of gallons of water.  Get real!  it take less than 100watts hours to boil a
gallon of water in 20 minutes.  Look at your electric bill for a month.

If the signal is less than the threshold of detection of a singal element of
the array no amount of intergration with improve the signal because it was
not detected.  Real world collides with theory.  Real world wins.  Sensor
threshold is a basic fact of applies science.

Not if the signal is less the the sensors threshold.  Period comma
exclamation point.  Like your radio, if the signal is to faint you can\'y
pick it up no matter how much to amplify.  The weak signal can\'t get through
the front end to get to the amplifier.

First figure out the surface area needed to radiate that 150MW contineious
heat output into space and the temperture of the radiater.  Cooked crew!
Remember to include that parralel radiater will loose efficency due to
absorbion of some of their neighbors energy.

A scout ship could not radiate 1MW with a living crew.

The habitable planet, no you\'d be spoted if you got to close.  The gas
giant, a moon, or the star yes.  And you do not have to get close to use the
planets or other bodies gravity field for help in stearing.  A little change
makes a bit difference over 1 ls.  I\'m not saying it\'s easy or simple I\'m
saying it\'s an option and a posiblity.

I\'m fishing for a way to get canon pirates back into logical posibility.
The pirates definately need a few breaks on the mail list.  They are taking
a terible beating from fleets of IN to .5Gcr sensor arrays.  Pour guys are

Spaceships in low orbit are indeed easily visible (look at the space shuttle,
which is about the size of a typical scout...) 6th magnitude stars are visible
from a good dark site with good eyes, so you could see even medium-high orbits.

>This sensitivity number, what are the units
They are gaming units from the FFS2/Definitive Sensor Rules. It\'s a log scale-
basically it\'s log(range/5km)+6   (the "5km" and "+6" are there for
obscure historical reasons) and the sensitivity gives the range at which you
can detect a "typical" target (a 100-ton 100-MW scout with no special
masking.) Unitless log numbers are much easier to work with than making poor
players multiply and divide in real flux units. The log numbers were
derived, though, from a real model of spacecraft emission and sensor
sensitivity, done in perfectly reasonable physical units like 
photons/m2/angstrom (I\'ve never liked "lumens" much - archaic concept.)

That was the example for a high-population world. The sensors are on
stations, somewhere at around 10 AU (so you can reach them with 
non-jump-capable ships), and presumably heavily armed and guarded...
the sensor array itself masses 50,000 tonnes and is spread out over a tenth 
of a square kilometer, so it won\'t fit in most pirate ships. 

I\'m restraining myself from getting into the thermodynamic arguments, so I
will ask only: "what happens to the electricity you generate with your
magic thermocouples?"

Ok, your solar cell converts some of photons into electricity and the
rest of them heat the solar cell and the parts around it. The
electricity goes down wires, heating the wires due to resistance, runs
an electric motor heating the parts of the motor, and does work
producing more heat. Now, where does all that heat go?  

> Power does not come from nowhere nor does it go into nowhere.  

Right! It *has* to go somewhere. On earth it is transferred to the
system, the air, ground and water. But the amount of heat energy
transferred to the "system" is *exactly* equal to the energy that
would have enter the system from that stream of photons if it hadn\'t
intersected with the solar cell. No more, no less.

A space ship doesn\'t have a planet for a heat sink, every joule it
absorbs or produces has to go somewhere. It either raises the internal
energy (temperature) of the ship, or is radiated into space. The
energy going into the system, from every source, has to balance with
the energy within it or radiated out. So, if you produce internally,
or absorb externally, 100 joules per second then your local system
will either radiate away 100 joules per second or increase in internal
temperature until, eventually, whatever heat sink you have in the

  OK - 400 Dt corsair (although you keep mentioning quite remarkable
vessels) at 10 tons/Dt = 4000 metric tons; 1000 kg of gas at 100 m/s
 - should give your ship a vector change of 2.5 cm/sec.

statements) or 25,000 seconds; 1/40th m/s for that time is _625 meters_?

  That\'s a really special pirate ship - although I can think of one way

One thing that I\'ve wondered about, but lack the knowledge to work out is
how much of a gravity wave pulse you\'d get from a ship entering or leaving
jump. I assume there must be at least a little because as far as this
universe is concerned the ship simply stops existing, or instanteanously
comes into existence and I can\'t see how this wouldn\'t make a fuss. If
nothing else it should be a distinctive siqnature, but how big would it be?

AFAIK CT didn\'t say anything much about maneuver drive until HG came along.
The Traveller Book (I don\'t have the LBBs) says that 10PN (10 times the
powerplant number) is enough fuel to power the powerplant and maneuver
drives for a month. This suggests some sort of reaction drive.

IMO the massive fuel consumption rates are from an attempt to use all this
fuel with the powerplant after having declared that the drives were
reactionless.

<snip>

Merrick, scenarios like yours are precisely why IMTU ships can only
jump to objects of stellar and near stellar mass. I don\'t want a fleet
bypassing systems by jumping from oort cloud, to oort cloud, to empty
hex, to oort cloud all the way to their enemy\'s home system half a
galaxy away, never running the risk of detection or combat as it
moves. Just as I don\'t want merchant ships jumping from 2 hours away
from a world to the next system\'s oort, refueling, then jumping to
within 2 hours of that system\'s main world.

If the places a ship, or fleet, can emerge from jump are limited then
defenses can be set up, traps can be set, choke points can be created,
and battles can be forced. So, I try to make the volume where ships
can jump in large enough to be challenging to the defense/ambusher,
but not *impossible* for them, and small enough to be dangerous for
the attacker/traveller, but not *impossible* for them either.  

IMTU, of course, YYMV.

Functionally, I don\'t suppose so there is *too* much of a difference, \'cept
MT reactionless thrusters let you keep going and going and going ...
(weren\'t CT drives fusion rockets?).

It was really more of a campaign-feel thing for me. Since all my MT games
to date have been Star Wars-style space operas set during the Rebellion (or
Hard Times), I preferred the cozy blue ion glow of thruster plates to the
plasma wash of HEPLAR. (I also hated the bookkeeping of fuel consumption,
I\'ll admit).

Not that I think thrusters are any more realistic than psionics (except for
electronic psionics via cybernetic implants) ...

P.S. I never understood the notation for missile burn limits, either. They
are not explained in the MT rules.

Actually, I did read the Armageddon Inheritance, liked it,and recycled

I can understand why such great condition used copies are easy to find.

I actually rather liked that. It was uncomfortable but more interesting

Mmm...  this is a nit, but both those ships have BB as their designation
inside Fighting Ships, Dreadnaught simply referring to the mainline BBs.
 
	Hehehe..a minor nit.  I use the designation DN for a large ship of the line
designed for no other glorious purpose than combat w/ similar vessels.  I see
BBs as a ship class roughly equivilant to the Scharnhorst or Gniesenau in WW2:
heavily armed, fast ships but lacking in the armor of a DN.  Both, however,
would be classified as BatRons in my TU.

> Squadron (CruRon, BatRon):  8 ships

This would ignore the explicit word in Fighting Ships, pg 9 that says CruRons
are 4-8 ships.  BBs would, if anything, average similar or smaller, not
larger.  The examples we have are hardly representative.  The mentions of
those two ships being in squadrons of 8 would fit the optimum (read: maximum)
number, doing all their propaganda justice.  ; )

	I see CruRons as having 8 units at normal strength...this does not mean that
this number can\'t be augmented as necessary.  In peacetime, however, there are
very few missions that would require a full-strength CruRon, so I see the
cruisers as spending most of there time operating in CruDivs or CruDets (solo
operations are not unheard-of as well).  During wartime, the Fleet Admiral
must balance the need to cover all his areas of responsibilty (splitting his
forces) versus being able to fight and win over an enemy force (concentrating
his force)  This is Hell\'s Half-Acre:  east of the rock, west of the hard
place!  :-)

<< BatRons are going to be enormously unnecessary in the Imperial core.  Only
on
 the fringes would they be necessary at all, though maybe in numbers out of
 proportion than the imperial core *would* have. >>

My take is that most warship construction takes place in-theater.  You build
your local fleets for the Spinward Marches in the Spinward Marches...not the
Glimmerdrift Reaches, for instance.  I keep meaning to sit down and work on
the numbers of TL15  Type A starports there are in the Marches...although the
Domain level might be a better choice (Comments??).  One potential bottleneck
I see relating to the TCS numbers and the sizes of the fleets they allow is
yard capacity:  Just how many tons can a yard be working on at one time?
Remember, construction is not instantaneous;  if you have a 1Mt yard cap, and
you are building a 1Mt ship, that yard is full for 5+ years.  Overhaul and
refit takes the same capacity as new construction...so that yard is "out of
business" so to speak.

What would be the purpose of a DesRon for the IN?  Destroyers (the Midu
explicitly) are supposed to be ecorts for cruisers and battleships.  Maybe for
small-time flag waving missions to impress inferior TL worlds.  Power
projection, but not actual presence.

	DesRons are almost always split into divisions or detachments. DesRons are
used as screening vessels for a Task Group or Task Force; they also serve as
pickets for systems (I use unrealistically short-range sensors IMTU <G>) A
CruDiv or CruDet usually has at least one DesDiv for it\'s screen as well.
Destroyers (and this is a generic term for me:  I consider Midu\'s, P.F.
Sloans, Rapiers, etc as making up DesRons) are the types of vessels that most
commonly are used on solo ops, or in very small groups.  Destroyers usually
carry a small number of troops; they are fast (normally), carry sufficient
firepower to cool down most situations that aren\'t already out-of -hand
anyway, and are extremely cheap WRT larger vessels (economy of force I believe
is the term)

NO!!! wait to get them in order... there is an overarching political
superplot that runs through volumes 5 and up of the sten series.

CANON universe doesn\'t require the 100 diameter limit to exit jump, merely
that you can\'t exit jump inside that limit, and attempts to do so result in
dropping out at the limit.

No, you can micro jump in. In fact from 1000 AU, it is possible for it to
take months to come in (under TNE, it is usually far better to take your
HEPlaR fuel and use it to microjump!).

Loath as I am to stifle on-topic discussions, I have to agree with Doug
here.  I have set my filter to send any email with the word "piracy"
directly to the Recycle bin.  Needless to say, I\'m suddenly getting a LOT
less TML traffic.  Unfortunately, since I\'m using MS Outlook, a few messages
still manage to get through.  :)

OH YEAH! Heplar burns fuel. CT/MT SHIPS and Small Craft do not use fuel for
maneuver (solely for power). So in CT/MT, as long as the PP holds out, you
can keep thrusting. Under TNE\'s HEPlar, your heplar fuel was often enough
for an extra jump-1, and only gave you a few HOURS of thust. Since T-plates
were in FF&S WITHOUT THE &%^%^* cutoff, and the TML\'ers (back when there
was XML for CT/MT players) "imposed" the cutoff. Since FF&S2 was
essentially TML written by a mostly TNE supporting crowd, it maintained the
imposed limits on thrusters.

A typical heplar ship has about 4-12 hours of thrust, assuming they don\'t
dip into PP or J fuel. As comepared to an MT design having 28 DAYS of
continuous thrust. Under MT, it is possible to design craft with crews of
10 or so, which can thrust for YEARS (which would get you a mre 99.9% C,
even tho by the accelleration formulae, you\'d wind up at supralight speeds;
the formulae do not include relatavistic effects).

According to the rules, it\'s not just plated all over the place, it\'s also the 
improved bracing & such.  And besides, \'worked\' metal is *always* more 
expensive than just sheet or ingot metal.  The more you play with it, the more 
it\'s worth.

When you look at it, yeah, it\'s expensive, but not compared to egines and 
such.  And the price applies *ONLY* to the armour; my SDB design I posted the 
other day has 80 dt of armour at a cost of 56MCr.  The hull ran 96MCr, and the 
power plant ran 576MCr.  Power plants don\'t get cheaper (relatively) until you 
hit TL14!

Dear William,

You misunderstood me, I changed the topic back to Honor Harrington. I\'ve
read the first four books of the series and now I have a later book "In
Enemy Hands" #7 or #8. I wanted to know know if I would ruin anything by
charging ahead. 

I\'ve noticed Weber\'s work usually follows a common arc. Begin with a
scene of the bad guys plotting, follow with cutesy treecat scenes,
receive new orders and begin ramping up the tension for the final
climax.

I just finished cutesy treecats so I can still walk away.

Bye

"In Enemy Hands" is Honor Harrington.  The Sten series, in order, are:

   Sten
   The Wolf Worlds
   Court of a Thousand Suns
   Fleet of the Damned
   Revenge of the Damned
   Return of the Emperor
   Vortex
   Empire\'s End

In the real world that I live in, I have often detected things in long exposures
or multiple images added together that were not detectable in a single or
short exposure. In the real world, because noise is random, as you take 
multiple samples or long exposures the noise goes up only as the square root
of the number of samples or exposure time, while the signal goes up linearly
with the exposure time, so with a good camera - one that isn\'t limited by
something silly like its analog-to-digital converters - by integrating long
enough you can see fainter and fainter. Your eye can\'t do this because your
eye doesn\'t build up  signal with time - it\'s like a camera always reading
out ten times a second - but better cameras can do this. I\'ve sent Charles a
private email with Actual Numbers which I can copy to anyone who cares; I\'ll
take the argument about whether longer integrations let you see fainter 
objects to private email and stop bothering all you nice people about it.

\'Federation\'?  \'4-Day Planet\' is bundled up with \'Lone Star Planet\' in my copy.

Of course they don\'t.  That\'s why an armed tramp freighter can make 25,000

My understanding it that even in the Imperial Core, most worlds
are low pop worlds.  I don\'t see piracy or free traders
implausible.

By "Sunbeards" you mean full time pirates operating out of pirate
bases?  That kind of piracy does seem unlikely to me, at least with
the kind of assumptions I use....

The question to ask is how the local culture impacts the PCs. 

I\'d certainly include an indicator for xenophobia/xenophilia,
which might be used as a "modifier to reaction rolls" on
interpersonal tasks.

Another possibility for an indicator might be
combativeness/conciliatoriness, giving an idea of the likely
reaction to insults, opposition, attitude in negotiation, etc.

I don\'t know what to call this next one, but it indicates how
seriously they take their religion\'s commandments/proscriptions.

TSR, at the time, had just released the second \'politically correct\'
version of the AD&D rules...you know, the ones where demons and devils
were replaced with taanarri, etc.?

Mayfair, assuming they still had the rights to publish AD&D material
(continuing from their Role Aids books for 1st edition) came out with
some supplements: Apocalypse, Demons, Demons II, ArchMagic. 

The Demons and Demons II got TSR into a tizzy, and they sued, pointing
out that the Mayfair license relations was overwith via the production
of 2nd Edition. Mayfair gave in instead of fighting the court battle
with TSR, selling off their AD&D properties to TSR.

City State of the Invincible Overlord was the only Judges Guild property
that I know of that was owned by Mayfair. Matter of fact, I know another
company later reprinted some Judges Guild products. Wish I could
remember who that was.

It was shortly thereafter, btw, that GDW became TSR\'s target, over
Dangerous Journeys, and thus the demise of GDW began.

Horses & wagons don\'t work so hot in big cities.  And you\'d need at least a 
*couple* big cities to support building stuff like jets, *unless* your tech is 
so high that your factoreis are highly automated.

But anyways, the TL of the planet is the TL of most readily availiable 
devices.  Lifestyle choices wouldn\'t enter into this.  If they have the 
capacity to build air rafts, who cares what they use to get to work?

I could see a planet where they have high tech and choose to make their 
availiable tech be fairly \'green\'.  Local transport would be \'skimmer pads\' 
(kind of like a gravitic skateboard, if you can get teh cost down) powered by 
batteries.  Long range transport would be by maglev tunnels.  All industry 
would either be in space or underground.  This planet\'s technologies would 
*not* be sustainable in event of catastrophe...

I\'ve noticed Weber\'s work usually follows a common arc. Begin with a

receive new orders and begin ramping up the tension for the final
climax.

I just finished cutesy treecats so I can still walk away.

Well, in CT it\'s reasonable to fudge the ridiculous fuel consumption of the
reactor as including the fuel consumption of systems powered off of it (i.e.
the drives); the result is fairly close to the performance of a total

Simple.

Pirates exist in the outsystem, among belters and similar scum.

Their stock in trade is mugging small colonies of belters, and selling the
loot to other belters.

They do not come *anywhere* near mainworlds, as mainworlds have sensors,
customs cutters, fighters, SDBs, traffic control and are listened to when
they complain to the Subsector Admiral.

If a belter colony is at all defended, then pirates dont go near it either,
except maybe as low-paperwork traders.

The corrollory of this is those in the Outsystem have to pay high freight
rates when they do want something. This makes the Outsystem profitable to
trade with, if you are prepared to take the risks (this also neatly
exaplains why planetary develpment in Traveller is overwhelmingly
concentrated at mainworlds).

Very occasionally, a pirate might come within the normal zone of operations
for legitimate merchants (ie the 100 diameter limit). But not as a career
thing.

Now, if the structure of the Imperium has broken down due to war or civil
war, or you are located on an \'open\' Imperial frontier (not a frozen,
militarised one like the Spinward Marches of the 1100s), then things are a
different story.

But, for me, the above explains piracy in the Third Imperium.

The question to ask is how the local culture impacts the PCs. 

I\'d certainly include an indicator for xenophobia/xenophilia,
which might be used as a "modifier to reaction rolls" on
interpersonal tasks.

Another possibility for an indicator might be
combativeness/conciliatoriness, giving an idea of the likely
reaction to insults, opposition, attitude in negotiation, etc.

I don\'t know what to call this next one, but it indicates how
seriously they take their religion\'s commandments/proscriptions.

It shows the advantage of TL15 Power plants sizewise. An Imperial version

I do not bring my traveller books to work.  It was a best guess bassed on
the assumetion that a full attack by a ships own weapons would badly damage
it.  If you want to nitpik everything to death then you\'ll need too start
footnoting everything you say as well.  I still have not gotten threshold
sensor numbers for these sensors yet.  No one has explained how a 100ton
scout can radiate 10MWs of heat per second as some say it does.  If you want
do carry on this discussion under the debating rules I can do that.  We will
both have to start by proving our primices.  Can you prove a 100MW power
plant has 10MWs of waste heat and a 100ton scout can radiate it without
killing the crew?

I can prove the concepts of sensor thresholds and noise numbers.  You can
test these consepts yourself listening to your car radio.  As for converting
heat to electricity by a solid state means check any thermalcouple reference
book or catalog for a very elementery form of this technology.

All aproaches from behind the planet to remain hidden for the examples below.

As for SFB 2 stingers 2 at range 0 on the front shield on a Fed. CA will net
about 20-30 internals (if memory serves). 12 stingers 2 = one CA in bpv.  At
range 0 more CA.

A CA on a CA (better example) at range 0 with just overloads will do 34
interals.  (16x4=64 30 box shield)  Add phaser for an extra 34 points.
Think you could win with 64 internals at WS0 or 1?  At range 1, about the
same.  At range 4, 25-35 internals including 2 trop and 4 phasers.  At
ranges 8 and average rolls, 10-15 internal including 1 torp and two phasers.

My CA has a speed of 12 yours 0.  Still like your odds?  

Personally I\'d prefer a Hydron hellbore crusier for that attack.  "What Fed?
I don\'t see no Fed?"  Do you really need to see the numbers for range
0,1,2,3,or 4?  A fussion cruiser at 0 with overloads and all phaser is not
that much beter though you may not blow up.

Or a D7k with 2 type 4 drones (48 points), full overloads at range 1 (32
points), and phasers (40 points).  Follow up with a second drone launch on
the next turn.  If WS 0 you\'d have to tracter them or eat them on another
shield.  Then I\'d Minza you to death with my higher speed or overrun and
kligon phaser hose you at range 1.  Two or three shields down, 2 or 3 torps
gone, 4-6 phazers gone, 10 or more power, and all hull.  If using power
balencing for damage this would get UGLY!

Good enough?  It\'s mostly from memory.  I\'ve played a lot of SFB.  The bpv
for the stinger is from my MSC I keep in my desk for the berg campain.

But the guns will be unmaned if the crew is standing down.  That was my
point.  You will not have everybody at their station all the time.  You just
agreed with me.  The pirate knows when he will attack an can have his crew
on station.  The SDB never knows when all hell will break loose.

Stop 50 missles on balistic targeting with no gunners in the turrets and 3

True, with jump it\'s easy and you lose your weight advantage over the pirate.

No, they need the maitainence, just like everybody else.  All I am trying to
do is come up with a way that the canon pirate can exist.  Life does not
have to be easy for them but systems that track every 10 meter object in a
system out to the ort cloud is less believable to me than the occassional
pirate.

For any historically-challenged subscribers to the list, HMS ROYAL OAK
was sunk in October 1939 by a U-boat (U-39?) that did just that: 
penetrated the main British naval base (Scapa Flow).

For those of you who were already aware of this (or surmised that

I know that but they would also cut the amount of power that had to be

Not that it matters.  You still get seen at the range you need to be at to
strike at targets.  Finally got all the numbers crunched.  Only one or two
questions to be answered by Bruce and I\'ll help you bury the piracy debate.
I was pro pirate due to canon but the reality check is coming due.

No need to bother.  I caught the part I was missing to firgure the situation
out.  Please read on while a ingest this crow I find before me. (Grin)  I
still have a question or two and I think you\'ll like hearing me admit my
errors.  There were several.

Oh, I\'ve had to go over this a few times with the aid of a reference book
and a calculater so this may get a little disjointed.  I think I\'ve finally
pull most of the data togethere form their various sources.

By the way, thanks for your help Bruce and your pacience while I worked this
out for myself.  I design computer control systems at the chip and board
level for a living.  Some of the mistakes I made were in very basic
assumption for my kind of work.  One of the draw back to linear thinking is
you sometimes miss the far more direct non linear answer while you are
crunching the numbers.

The smallest amount of energy detectable by the sensor as being present and
as being discrete.  This sets the low limit for detectability for a sensor
snap shot but having read the rest of the post I should qualify the qestion
by geting the answer as a function of integration time as it appears that in
this case it is very \'shutter speed\' dependent.  Most of my work requires
real time data so I had not thought about the integration time as a factor.
It threw off by understanding of the information you were presenting
considerably.

A bad case of flat head syndrom.  Or, "How did I miss that!"  As always one
small thing missed sets you way off course and scued the rest of the data badly.

So the sensor can detect a single photon as an individual or only as part of
a summing?

If this is correct just what is the limit to what can be seen?  Intergation
time?  Does a longer intergration time let do get a higher magification as
well as light level or is that still limited by mirror size?

That piece of information is the final piece I\'ve been looking for.

Could a scout ship in orbit around a planet a parsec away be detected?

This is due to the radiation constant having the absolute temp to the -4
power in the demominator isn\'t it?  

I knew something was fishy with that simplified formula.  I think they
assumed 20c as a constant background temp.  If so it explains the wierd
numbers I keep getting.

Can you tell me the absotute maximum amount of heat that a 20c black body in
planetary space could radiate per square meter?  The formula I have is
simpified and incomplete.  I do not think it is giving me the right numbers.
They look way to low.

I thought that telescopes today were built to recieve a fairly narrow part
of the spectrum.  Are there units that range from mid RF through IR in one
reciever?  That would curtainly be news to me.  What is the reciever made of
to recieve this ide a spectrum?

Also with the long integeration time, how long would it take to do a
spherical scan at 3 ls from a space born sensor and detect that 53k black
body?  This is my last hope to solve the pirate problem.  If the scan time
is short how do the pirates survive?  Or is it that scaner is real costly?
It\'s the pirate problem I have been trying to find a loop hole for.  If this
does not do it I guess I\'ll have to join the no pirate camp.  All the holes
are pluged for all but the commerse raiders in 100K ton cruisers.

Some of the holes I plugged on my own, others were pluged for me.
Detectability and stealth was my last concept for a solution.

This post is loaded with the data I was searching for in several areas!

I\'ve been pulling by hair out looking for the imission formula.  Someone
posted the idea that a scout was radiating 10MW of waste reacter heat into
space!  Anyway I figure it the crew gets cooked and the ship melted at that
power output!

So you could digitaly filter it out and still see a ship hiding by emiting
in that range.  Is this correct?

No, I ment that the inner vaccume would retain the heat and let the outer
hull cool down naturally.  If a real good IR reflecter were placed between
the inner and outer hulls then perhaps IR leakage could be reduced to near 0
and the outer hull could approach space normal tempertures.  This is fishing
also as I do not know of a 100% IR mirror though there are 100% laser mirrors.

Sometimes when I\'m answering these emails I brain storm.  Some of the ideas
work out but then some don\'t.  This one does not look promising.

No, I ran the numbers, at the speeds needed for a stealth attack run with 12
ls warning from the target, the vector would not be enough.  Slow down to
give the thrust time to accrue and you miss your target as he has time to
jump out.  The window isn\'t narrow it\'s non existant without at least a good
healthly fraction of a G thruster control at the very least.

That\'s originally what I was talking about but...not nearly enough power to
get the job done.

True, but a solid object would likely be warmed from the launch process to,
so you loose out that way.  Thrusters are the only real way but if you use
those you\'re spoted for sure.



Does not look good for the pirates.  I was trying to come up with a proof
for canon and ended up proving canon unlikely but at least I know why it is
unlikely and have worked out the proofs myself.  As the saying goes, I
believe little of what I hear or see...unless I can find proof for it myself.

Do not feel your effort was in vain Bruce.  I learned a great deal from this
discussion on matters outside my normal interests.  Knowledge is often it\'s
own reward, at least it is to me.  Learning is one of my favorite avocations
even when I have to do it the hard way.  Oh! for future reference, a fomula
is worth a lot of text in explaining some things to me.  Math is one of my
stronger suits.

Assuming there is a religion at all?

I thought about religion wrt a cultural extension, but think that
it should be left out of official Traveller materials, and left

You could use religion to explain a xenophobia rating

My view exactly (referring to piracy being neither practical nor
sensible).  I would, however, point out that piracy, like trying to
become a professional athlete to get out of poverty, need not be
profitable _on average_.  It must only be _thought_ to be profitable to
occur.  For every John Dillinger, there are countless unsuccessful bank
robbers.  It\'s the Dillingers that get the publicity, thus creating in
some minds the impression that a career as a bank robber is a fine
idea.  The thought of getting something for nothing is quite attractive,
and I can see some ships\' crews (and even some heavily-in-debt ships\'
owners) concluding that piracy would be an easy way to make a fast MCr
or 20.  Add in the occasional story about some pirate pulling off some
incredible stunt, with a gigacredit or two lost to this pirate, and you
have the recipe for some truly stupid behavior.  (Including [or
especially] on the part of PCs....)

Bottom line, IMO:  99.99% of the time, piracy is little more than a
quick ticket to the nomination round of the Darwin Award.  However, it\'s
the successful .01% that gets 95% of the publicity, thus attracting more
fools (and, admittedly, the occasional genius/lucky fool) to piracy as a
way of life.

True, but since MT, ships have generated *way* too much power--for
most applications. Drives are another story. Luckily you can say
that even t-plate drives have hot exhaust, it just doesn\'t do much 
of the pushing. That allows you to get rid of the lion\'s share
(technically, the Lion\'s share should be _all_ of it, right? But you
get my point :-) out the tailpipe.

Real wrold telescopes can catch things on the oreder of small
numbers of photons per hour and record it. So the TL8 baseline has
an amazingly high sensitivity. CCD cameras typically have quantum
efficiencies over 80%--that means you can get data from many events
that are A SINGLE PHOTON.

In other words we can detect on the order of 10^-19 Joules. Bruce
might have something better than converting 1-2eV (visible-IR
photon(other way around, actually)) into Joules :-)

This isn\'t an amplification issue. You are opening the shutter
longer, not running the signal though an amplifier. Film is very
inefficient (QE of about 2% if I remember right). That means you
need to hit a film grain with many photons before the grain leaves an
image (this is a pixel on film). If you open the shutter for 10
seconds, you get 1 photon to hit a grain, you get a blank picture.
If you leave the shutter open for an hour, you might get 5-10.
Several hours, and you get enough to leave a latent image. That is
what we mean when we say integration time. CCD cameras work the
same way. When Bruce said (and I parroted) that you can add frames
together, there *is* a signal to add. That is because the CCD (or
future traveller sensor which is also solid state) has such a high
quantum efficiency--it can detect a single photon. So as long a a
given image of an area has a single photon from the source, there is
data. Bruce explained why adding frames lets you get rid of noise
(which is random and changes from frame to frame).

> A scout ship could not radiate 1MW with a living crew.

Then don\'t play traveller :-) Traveller weapons require that they
deliver at bare minimum a couple MJ to a target per pulse (I think
it\'s around 2MJ to penetrate a cm of steel). That means traveller
ships that rae armed require at least some number of MW if they are
armed. Drives that do multiple gs are MW. Hell, there are plenty of
1MW PPs used *now*--that\'s only ~1330 horsepower (~0.75KW/HP sticks in
my head).

Most traveller power goes to the drives, so the power radiates
there. You have to assume that even a t-plate has a hot exhaust, and
that it takes a lot of the energy with it (that and whatever gravtic
energy is lost... a good handwave). Th Scout with the drives off
drops its power by about 100MW.

You forget that access space on ships that are designed for long occupancy
(IE starships) the access space requirement is DOUBLED.  (V2E p. 15, first
paragraph)

This means that your access space has to be THREE times the size of the
component, rather than two; this reduces the size of the thruster to 1/6 of
the 500cf space instead of 1/5.

Then why have transponders say anything other than that?  If you can record
anything you want on the transponder, then it\'s meaningless to have
anything there.

If I were in your campaign, I would set my transponder to say that I was an
Imperial Navy destroyer, at least when I was anywhere I thought I could get

Probably not... ELF is a very narrow bandwidth.  There\'s not much
technology could do to expand it, either... the frequency is just that long.

If it were me, I\'d use meson communicators (they exist in GT, dunno about
the rest)

Well, yes - but now that you bring up the point, the same kind of
prohibitions may exist culturally independent of religion
(although perhaps having their origin in religion).  Kind of like
"blue laws" in some areas of the US, where they really do
prosecute for transacting business on a Sunday.

Not necessarily; xenophobia may have nothing to do with religion

States since the mid-1980s.

Well, usually traffic control has some idea of what it _wants_ there, and may

Yah, you can set your transponder to claim you\'re a navy destroyer, though it\'s
common to have some level of encryption on IFF schemes, so you\'d probably need
a reasonable database.  However, you\'d better _look_ like a navy destroyer, at
least as far as your signature goes -- given that its known you can forge your
transponder ID, people won\'t automatically believe it.

The point of a transponder is to let your _friends_ know who you are.  If you
don\'t have any friends who you want to know who you are, you might as well just
turn your transponder off.

The traveller transponders are just as forgeable as a modern transponder. 
Modern transponders can be spoofed.  It\'s just that most people don\'t, because
it isn\'t all that useful in most situations, and tends to accumulate large
fines from the local authorities.

What would you do if you had just suppressed or destroyed the local

your \'Subs\' to be able to make the world useless to them for as long as

Then the ship MUST be doing SOMETHING with the energy besides radiating

everything.

So, therefore, there MUST be some kind of anti-entropic \'miracle heat sink\'.

And the whole debate about infrared and sensors has to be re-thought...

Both. Typically it might take two low energy photons, but if your
pixels are large, this isn\'t a problem (an advantage of detecting
vs. resolving a target). (BTW, while I don\'t do it for a living like
Bruce does, I\'m an astrophysics person by training (optical
astronomy, though I\'ve done a couple runs at the VLA).

Bruce assumed in DSR that quantum efficiencies go towards 100% as TL
increases. Traveller sensors are assumed to be something like phased
array radar receivers.

Telescopes (any light detector, basically, even a radio telescope)
are just buckets to catch photons. Longer integration time catches
more light--you see dimmer (or farther) objects.

Magnigfication has nothing to do with integration time. Resolution
(we never even talked about magnification other than the fact that
it doen\'t matter for anything (you can magnify a crappy image, it\'s
just bigger :-) on the other hand is important if you want to see
what the object is (otherwise you get a spectrograph as most of you
data on the little bright dot that is the target).

Resolution goes up with increased telescope diameter it goes as
k*wavelength/telescope_diameter. k is typically around 1.22 if I
recall. Low numbers are better since the resultant units are an
angle. For detection resolution doesn\'t matter at all.

> Could a scout ship in orbit around a planet a parsec away be detected?
 
If it were bright enough :-) It isn\'t. Besides, once it gets that
close to another body, the ability to split the scout from the
planet becomes an issue (here resolution would actually matter).

CCDs have a fairly large bandwidth. But nowdays they are typically
narrow. Bruce assumes for DSR (and is right to do so) that IR is
where the action is.

You don\'t scan at 3ls. You scan the sky. The sky is a surface to a
telescope--distance isn\'t a factor in scanning (other than the fact
that farther objects are fainter). I suppose you might ask "What is
the minimum integration time to detect a 53K BB at 3ls?"

I think that this has been blow out of proportion. In a backwater
system the question is can the planet send a ship that can beat the
pirate within weapons range before he loots his target. I\'m not sure
a pirate needs, or cares if he is detected.

I don\'t agree (I think DSR is great, but the trick is to figure out
how/where pirates could be given that). Military sensors in CT could
see out past 100D, and they had pirates :-)

A huge problem with all the ship design systems. We got kind astuck
with it. But in terms of drives and weapons, you need *tons* of
power to do what we expect/want traveller ships to do. It\'s no
accident that drives now (ion drives) that use little fuel and power
have accelerations that are thousandths of a g :-)

Yeah, when you add frames, you can subtract stuff that varies over
the frames (within some parameters you pick). The noise is random,
so it goes away.

We would take a "dark frame" with our CCD--a picture with the
shutter closed. This would provide a reference frame that had any
detector noise. We would subtracrt this from observation images.

You can do similar things with noise from the sky (just take
multiple images of your source so you have comparisons.

IIRC, transponders only respond to specific signals (based in concept, I
would suspect, on World War II-era IFF devices).  If that\'s the case,
then, unless the pirate had the current IFF codes for whatever force
he/she/it was trying to impersonate, the transponder wouldn\'t respond
appropriately to being interrogated by the IFF, and would therefore be
marked as hostile.

Much better to remain a "poor, lost circus performer" (or three!).

In GT, only weapons, drives, active sensors, and artificial gravity have
significant power consumption, and most of these probably dump a lot of energy
directly to space.  The assertion that a scout ship can\'t radiate a megawatt is
false, though -- it just requires a heat pump to a fairly hot radiator vane.

The GURPS Traveller fighters probably can take out capital ships, due to
the KK missiles they can use. This is not especially unbalancing: a
fighter costs more and takes up much more space in a ship than a missile
launcher...

Heyyyy!!!!

Wouldn\'t this be an excellent basis for those unforgeable transponders that
occasionally get tossed about?

If every set of jump drives has its own unique \'fingerprint\' similar to the
way bullets can be traced back to a gun, then you can keep accurate records

At least in GURPS Trav, you could do a lot of damage to a capship by
accelerating up to a nice high speed (say, 20) and launch your missiles
from 20 hexes out (this of course assumes that you\'ve got someone feeding
you targeting data) The missiles can then use their thrust to intersect the
target\'s path, and hit with a relative velocity of between 15 and 25...
that does LOTS of damage, if the bloody things get through.

Why?  Just because weapons are leading over armor today doesn\'t mean this

That\'s certainly the intended use, but the way you\'ve been describing them
you can easily use them for something else.

That\'s because the combat environment of the modern seas is completely
different.

In the Buccaneer days, pirates used to keep six or seven flags aboard, so
they could fly whichever one would get them what they wanted, akin to
changing transponders.

You\'re trolling, right? My gods - a piracy debate, virus debate, 
transpoder/encryption debate, and now fighters. The relativistic rocks
can\'t be far behind...

Take a look at the archives. In essence,modern fighters have advantages -
vastly higher speed, for example - over surface ships  that traveller fighters
lack; and speed-of-light weapons mean that a small, agile craft trying to
get close to a bigger craft is comitting suicide in a glorious fashion; and
even if it did get close, there are no weapons that require you to be close
and can take out a capital ship in a single blow the way a big bomb or
torpedo can.

(One should also note that even USN carrier-based aircraft are at best a 
system for extending the range of missiles vs front-line Soviet warships -
trying to fly over a former-Kirov to drop bombs is an invitation to certain
death, as any Harpoon player knows.)

Yes, they are, in the missile design sequence in the special supplement on
Missiles... All CT space-missiles (including nukes) are chemical rocket
10x100cm missiles, built from some standard components, IIRC. I do know
that they ARE chemical, even if ships aren\'t. (I don\'t recall ANY ct
references to just how MDrives worked, other than they took power from the
PP and no fuel (both bk 2 and HG require that your PP rating be sufficient
for the higher of the MDrive or JDrive.)

Actually, it has been a little over 6 months, and it isn\'t "Every 6 months"
that it crops up. It is a MAJOR cannon issue which reflects the whole of
the imperial canon, and how to interpret the OTU.

This is similar to my perceptions, but I assume that outsystems tend to be
fairly lawless, and often a GG subsystem may be almost a different
mainworld in many ways... there is a lot of turf around a gas giant,
between rings, major sattelites, minor sattelites, and Trojan Asteroidal
clusters. Lots of sources of minerals and metals, and lots and lots of
ices. Magnetic induction power can be quite cheap and effective considering
the ammount of magnetic flux one encounters orbiting some GG\'s... Plus some
are IR sources.... These sub sytems (other than the closest GG to the
primary, may be nearly independant, and are not included in the MW UPP\'s,
and in some cases, and extended system can ammount to more persons than the
mainworld.... but traveller lacks a "Realistic" world generation system -
There are no pop mods for habitability! Nor law mods, for that matter.
(Hmmmm... I\'m digressing, so I think I\'ll shut up now).

They are there to  notify traffic control and other vessels that a ship is present in the

planets, space ports, etc.) and through automatic monitoring of
transponder signals, makes it easier to respond to any problems
("traffic control reports Beowulf\'s transponder signal suddenly went off
the air -- something\'s wrong, send a cutter or SDB to investigate").

Of course, *because* your computers should be constantly tracking all
in-system
traffic, you can screen out a good portion of all non-starships since you
are *constantly* tracking them. So that just leaves the starships. Many of
them will be regulars -- while a determined smuggler or pirate can find
out who they are and mimic them, doing so does require extra work and
research, and doing it over many jumps can lead to mistakes that a traffic
control team can catch ("hey, didn\'t the SS Cantolope just jump in 4 days
ago -- no way they should be back this week!" or "hey, the Denebia
always used to come in at 2 G -- she\'s doing 1 G now?). Aside from that,
by screening out those transponder contacts that are normal insystem
commerce (planet to planet) and those that are "regulars" it\'s easier to
concentrate on strangers and anomalies who may be bogies.

Oh goody - a KKM debate to go with the fighter debate and the piracy
debate and the transponder debate...

"if the bloody things get through", of course, is the hard part - 
for reasonable laser technology
(let alone the really good lasers in GT or just-plain-T) hitting an
incoming kinetic impact missile is remarkably easy; certainly for the
space/price of a figher you can fit in a point defence laser that
can eat up many many times its weight in impact missiles (at least
in FFS2; but presumably also in GURPS - it\'ll be interesting to try
this once I get a copy of GURPS.)

	This is *exactly* why I love details such as the WBH law profiles,
religious profiles, etc.  I don\'t think I\'ve EVER created one
strictly by the dice. But it provides a good spur for my imagination
(which is sometimes a bit rusty and needs a swift kick to get it
going ...)

	Well, the positive ones are the ones I use, and the negative ones
are the ones I don\'t ... <g>


On a more serious note, I very much liked

	Technology Profile (WBH pp83-86; I\'m a gearhead, whaddaya want?).
Breaking up the otherwise monolithic TL into various areas goes a
long way to adding variety. THIS planet produces computer equipment
for export to THAT planet, which produces medical equipment for
export back ... despite the fact that they\'re both listed at the same
TL in a top-level UWP. Everybody pays a premium for NOrazi air/rafts,
but those guys/gals/things could build a decent stereo system to save
their gills. Solomani excel at Medical (genetics), while Hivers build
great computers.

	Parts of the population related details (WBH pp74-77) ... Social
Outlook (progressiveness, aggressiveness, extensiveness). Local
customs left me cold, except as a "menu" from which I could pick if I
wanted ... dressing habits, eating habits, living quarters, family
practives, miscellaneous customs ... nah.

	Government related details (pp78-79) was moderately interesting in
generating background flavor for me to get the mindset of a planet\'s
government, but I never extensively used it.

	Religious profile (pp79-81) was nice, but I never got around to
using it.

	Legal Profile (p82) was a very definite good idea.

	From the above you can obviously see I have WBH, and will survive if
none of it gets reused. I would argue, however, for keeping
everything but the "local customs." Instead of presenting that as
some kind of profile or table to be rolled on, you can just provide a
menu of ideas.

	Other useful extensions (not just cultural) to the UWP:

	Native life--is the local life as varied as earth (thousands of
species in all different branches of the kingdom--plants, animals,
insects, microorganisms, "none of the above"), is it more primitive,
maybe more sparse (ecotastrophe in the past cut the number of species
by a factor of a thousand?), is it more plantlike, is everything
mobile, etc., etc.

	Sentients--what\'s the distribution of sentient species? Distinguish
between spacefaring and native non-spacefaring, or major and minor.
Perhaps HVARKD-ABC would be
Human/Vargr/Aslan/hiveR/Kkree/Droyne-minorA/minorB/minorC, where each
digit represented the percentage of the total population represented,
and minorA, B, and C are minor species which would have to be spelled
out in the comments or details.

	Social mores--are people direct/aggressive (Americans) or
indirect/passive (Japanese)? Does the community or the individual
come first? Is honesty important? Is time important (i.e. the
American "time is money" concept or the idea that "today, maybe
manana, maybe next week")? Are group activities or individual
activities stressed? Is the culture implicitly or explicitly
stratified, and to what extent? Poor/middle class/rich, or a full
Hindu caste system? Is it based on wealth, appearance, heritage,
occupation? Any sexual dimorphism in the culture (i.e. male/female
roles)? Tolerance of those towards/beyond the fringes of the
culture\'s "normal"? Level of permissiveness (sexuality, intoxicants,
leisure, pleasure in general)?

	Simple thermodynamics ... they\'re utilizing a temperature
differential and extracting work from the heat as it flows from hot
to cold ... BUT the heat is STILL flowing.

	It is quite simple physics. Every single solitary megawatt of power
generated on the ship, REGARDLESS of how it is used in the meantime,
has to leave the ship somehow. Except for the fraction that\'s sent
out, say, as a laser beam, it ALL winds up as heat. And if you look
at the efficiency of lasers, you find that of every five or so MW
sent to them by the power plant, only one leaves in the beam itself.
The rest is waste ... heat. You *cannot* use up heat, only move it
around. Thermo 101.

	If you\'ve got a perfect block between the inner and the outer hull,
every watt of energy generated is building up inside the ship. How
fast, at 150MW, to reach infinite temperature? All the way back to
basics:

	Energy in a system = Energy generated less Energy lost

	Consider the ship as a system. The rate at which it emits energy
MUST equal the rate at which it\'s generated to keep the temperature
(=measure of random kinetic energy) constant. If the emission rate
drops below the generation rate, you start building up ...

It\'s a well

	Perhaps going back and reading up a little on basic thermodynamics
and how it specifically applies to the space environment will help
explain. ALL of the heat MUST go somewhere. Even if you use a
thermocouple, ANY kind of thermocouple, there are two basic facts:

	1. You MUST have a heat sink at a lower temperature than the heat
source. If you want to keep your spacecraft at a comfortable
temperature, you eventually wind up having to emit the heat from the
ship to space (background temperature: approx 3K). Heat moves from
higher temperature to lower temperature.*

	2. Conservation of energy still applies. With a 20% efficiency, the
20% you manage to convert to electrical energy is STILL in the
system. When you use it to do anything, it eventually winds up as
waste heat. You still have to get rid of it, along with the original
80% you couldn\'t convert in the first place.

	Bruce does IR sensor work for a living. I do satellite operations
for a living. Trust me, if we could generate energy for free, we
could. This is a very different environment, with a very different
mindset, than the one with which you\'re familiar. Part of the problem
may be getting the difference across.

* Well, you can "pump" heat from low temperature to high temperature
... but you pay a price in energy (which winds up as waste heat ...)
That\'s basically what starships do... the radiators (IIRC) are around
2000K. The fusion reactor obviously is higher than that, so you just
let the waste heat there run "downhill."  To keep lower temperature
regions (such as the crew quarters at around 300K) cool, you pump the
heat "uphill" to the radiator.

	The difference between the relationships \'twixt modern capital ships
(operating in and limited by the ocean environment) and fighter
aircraft (operating in and limited by a much different environment,
air), and space "carriers" and "fighters" both operating under the
exact same environment and limitations.

	A modern fighter has speed and maneuverability 20 or more times
higher than a modern capital ship. A space fighter has a minimal
margin in maneuverability over a larger vessel, and the disadvantage
of much less armor, power, and weaponry.

	Add in lightspeed weaponry, realistic detection ranges ...

	Don\'t compare AIR fighters and WATER capital ships, they\'re two
different things. Compare speedboats and battleships, and then tell
me which one has the advantage.

	Oh, and I wouldn\'t consider Wing Commander or any other video game
to be a reasonable source of reference when you\'re talking hard
science fiction. Space fantasy, maybe.

	Since I\'ve noticed a definite revival of old topics (which is GOOD,
frankly ... it means there are new people joining the list. Just us
old fogeys who\'ve heard it before), may I be the first to bring up
the idea of kinetic kill missiles? After all, why use a det-laser
that goes off thousands of km (or miles for GURPS geeks) away from
the target when you can apply a little E=1/2mv^2 ...

	Cheap disposable sensor buoys, packaged in dispersed dispensers (can
I say that?) all across the ocean floor. Once triggered, the
dispensers randomly spit out a buoy, which floats to the surface,
sees what it can see, and broadcasts targetting info for as long as
the buoy survives ... If you\'ve got data from a couple of these buoys
simultaneously, you should be able to get a fairly decent "blind" fix
and saturate a fair volume ...

	Slightly more expensive dispensers, with more expensive buoys. The
buoys are connected to the dispenser "base" by a fiber optic cable
(--minimal detectable leakage), and multiple fibers lead away from
each base to widely scattered terminal points. MesonSub snugs up to a
terminal point, activates the sensor buoy, acquires a target and
destroys it, then moves on ... or just keeps using that sensor until
it finally bites the dust, THEN moves on

	Combination pop-up det laser/sensor missiles from automated
launchers on the seabed--pop up and engage any target visible, while
simultaneously broadcasting targeting coordinates. Again, multiple
inputs give you a better chance of hitting something.

	Cheap passive/active sensor package on top of every single building
on the planet, all feeding into the global data net. Try degrading
THAT "very large array ..." Even if you don\'t like the idea of
millions of devices dumping sensor data onto the net, hook groups of
them together, and then make the consolidated data available. Think
WebCam ...

	Put an optical sensor on top of every single streetlamp. By
combining data from them, you can certainly detect anybody
reentering.

	Fire blindly ... if you\'ve got enough subs, you can blanket the most
likely approach corridors ...

		The scout MUST radiate that much heat, or the scout melts. Look at
your basic thermo textbooks. It\'s being generated, it HAS to go
somewhere. IIRC, the DSR assumed a radiator temperature of around
2000K.

	Yep. Realworld can detect single photon. Realworld wins. In case
you\'ve missed the repeated point, Bruce generated professional
simulations based on REALWORLD data to determine signatures and
sensitivities. The only extrapolation was in determining what size
sensors would be for a given sensitivity at different TLs.

	A scout ship that cannot radiate 150MW would not have a living crew.

Well, IMO, a transponder is never going to be able to "prove" who you are
and I thought saying they existed for that reason didn\'t work.

If they exist, I think they would be mostly to aid navigation (ships are easier
to track and you don\'t have to take time to call them up to find out who they
are).   It does have some benefit to security because it complicates some
situations because ships have to commit to sneaking up (since once they
are detected they have to explain why their transponders were off which
they may or may not be able to do).

That is why I think they exist.

  Actually they\'re lead by the Public Accounts auditor who\'s looking
into why the new ship class can\'t power it\'s fusion gun :(  You could
just install batteries in the spare space (although this shouldn\'t
really work in HG/Striker). 

  Alternatively, allow HG designs to be non-standard sizes (i.e., tonnage
may be any value of one or above - <1 would require scaling down output
per Striker) and simply enter EP\'s output, while listing the USP for damage 
purposes as Pn with all fractions dropped.

  Or just design the ship properly the first time...

  You could get around this by adding three lines (#1 listed as second set

it though, and it starts to screw with the HG simplicity concept.

  I appreciate that your powered maneuver duration is drastically reduced, but
is that a bad thing, and does it really affect how most ships behave in Trav?

  Given that the economics of ship financing have largely killed gas giant
refuelling IIRC (YMMV), at least for shippers in well-travelled areas, then
making M-drive cruises to the outer system longer hardly matters. It will
make some differences to ship designs, esp. for intra-system use, but it
may actually make certain activities easier out there.

  I hope that few CT ships went relativistic often; this also largely
solves the "near-C half-brick in a sock" routine, yes?

Oh, one other problem with heplars: they eat a large power chunk, in
ADDITION to needing plenty of fuel of their own. And MT/FF&S1 pp\'s (which
are basically identical) do eat a goodly ammount of fuel.

Check TNE, BL. G-Turns of thrust are 1/2 hour of 1G. I was a little low,
but the ships which need endurance lack it severely, and those which don\'t
have it.
looking in TNE Mk1 Mod 1
Scout: 80 G-turns with 2G, so we get 20 hours of max thrust
the far trader (Jayhawk A2) has 48 GT, 1G, so 24 hours of thrust
the free trader, 56 G-T, or 28 Ghours, and 1g
The Lord Baltimore Yacht: 32G-T with 4G, so 8 hours
gazelle 112 G-T, 3G With tanks 18h45m max thrust.
	77.6 G-T 5G without tanks  7h45m max thrust
Lab SHip: 96g-t 1G, 48 hours
Patrol Cruiser: 60G-T 4G; 7h30m at max burn
SDB: 112G-T, 4G; 14 hours
Fat Trader: 60G-T 1G; 30 hours
Donosev: 104G-T 2G; 26 hours
Subsidized Liner: 76 G-turns 1G; 38 hours
Merc Cruiser: 48G-T 2G; 12 hours

None of the above includes jump fuel. Low is 7h30m, high is 48.
Of the above, commercial craft (merchants & lab ship): low 24 high 48
Military (rest except yacht): low 7h30m high 26h

Total mission delta-v is usually measured in G-Hours... from launch to
refuel, whether that is far point or RTB. If RTB, that means accellerate,
coast, decellerate, do whatever, accellerate back, coast, decellerate, land.

Heplar may be more realistic, but it meant (IME) PC\'s taking running jumps
constantly, and spending about 3 times as long to get to/from jump points,
and GG\'s became accessable only via jump, as did the outter system. One
group of PC\'s nearly died off due to a misjump using TNE Rules, which put
them in the system, at several thousand AU. (T-Plates can get very tricky
on distances like these, because you run smack into relativity issures, but
with accelleration to 10PSL, 1000au becomes roughly (using an 8.5 lm AU,
not right,but fairly close)(8.5m x 10 x 1000) 85000minutes = 60 days. With
heplar, forget it... find a snowball and jump if you can. If you can\'t,
find a low berth, rig the PP to maintain the LB ONLY and run on as little
power as possible to maintain operation) and pray. Mind you, if the locals
like you, in 6 days they will know you exist, and may send help.

With T-plates, run as little as possible (LS, MD, computer, G-comps,
passive sensor for nav fix) till you hit 10 PSL. THen shut down sensors at
MD at 5PSL or 10PSL, and go to only one computer, and ration the food. (as
established before, water will be recycled if only to keep it out of the
machinery.) You can usually take your remaining (MT/FF&S1) usually 19 days,
and multiply by 5 (you can run at 20% or less often... I can see running a
plant stablely for as low as 10% output). With a T-plate universe, 1000AU
is reachable. Damned inconvinient, but reachable.

in a T-plate universe, the outer system is still a long trip, but is at
least doable with standard craft. In a Heplar (which is STILL
unrealistically efficient, IIRC) universe, a mainworld orbiting a GG is
barely going to have reasonable travel times in the GG\'s moon-system, and
going from planet to planet is much easier by jump in most cases.

(NOTE: I am NOT trying to encourage a Near-C rock discussion)
BTW, is there a formula for time-dilation effects that is simple enough to
use? (I don\'t do calculus, only simple algebra and statisics.)

  Yes, but the Terrier SDB is carrying (f4) 10% at MCr 0.7 /ton, while
the Rabid Poodle is maxxed out for combat at (f12) 26% at MCr 1.5 /ton.
At TL 12 they\'re presumably using superdense, which is KCr 14/m^3 in
slabs, so a D-ton should cost MCr 0.196 plus forming and engineering?
(which gives the 1000 Dt Poodle an armour allocation around 50,000 tons!)

  If the "2+2a" formula for armour in HG accounts for engineering and
compartmentalization with the fixed 2% of ship D-tonnage, then the "2a"
should be linear cost based on the material and its\' forming/installation
cost(?). If so, then the Poodle would pay ~2.6 times more its\' armour
(per D-t of ship) than the Terrier rather than the ~5.5 times it pays now.

  If installation is counted in HG\'s MCr 0.1 per Dt hull cgarge then the
armour could be re-assessed as "material value at TL plus % for forming",
thus giving a more rational (?) basis for costing armoured ships.

  I\'ll assume that they\'re built at shipyards? If you\'re playing in the
Imperium, then logically they\'d be shipyards under 3I supervision, with
instructions about building warships without end-user certificates, no
Scout Ships of Doom, maybe submitting paperwork to INI so they can start
by looking at vessel capabilities?

  I doubt that most campaigns (CT/HG) would allow merchants to buy missile
bays, PA barbettes, and meson guns.

Lets look at this

    L = 4*pi*sigma*R^2*T^4 is the luminosity 

Asume R = 25m, T = 53K

    L = 3513 W

The absolute magnitude is then 

    M = 62

Which at 3ls = 9.51E-08 ly = 2.92E-8 pc gives an apparent magnitude
of 
    m = 2 

which with a moderate sized telescope and a CCD would take under a
minute to detect. 

I have done detections of comets at distances of over 1AU using
30s exposures with the 2.5 Nordical Optical Telescope.

Well, IMO, a transponder is never going to be able to "prove" who you are
and I thought saying they existed for that reason didn\'t work.

If they exist, I think they would be mostly to aid navigation (ships are easier
to track and you don\'t have to take time to call them up to find out who they
are).   It does have some benefit to security because it complicates some
situations because ships have to commit to sneaking up (since once they
are detected they have to explain why their transponders were off which
they may or may not be able to do).

That is why I think they exist.

  You could get around this by adding three lines (#1 listed as second set

it though, and it starts to screw with the HG simplicity concept.

  Actually they\'re lead by the Public Accounts auditor who\'s looking
into why the new ship class can\'t power it\'s fusion gun :(  You could
just install batteries in the spare space (although this shouldn\'t
really work in HG/Striker). 

  Alternatively, allow HG designs to be non-standard sizes (i.e., tonnage
may be any value of one or above - <1 would require scaling down output
per Striker) and simply enter EP\'s output, while listing the USP for damage 
purposes as Pn with all fractions dropped.

  Or just design the ship properly the first time...

Oh, one other problem with heplars: they eat a large power chunk, in
ADDITION to needing plenty of fuel of their own. And MT/FF&S1 pp\'s (which
are basically identical) do eat a goodly ammount of fuel.

Check TNE, BL. G-Turns of thrust are 1/2 hour of 1G. I was a little low,
but the ships which need endurance lack it severely, and those which don\'t
have it.
looking in TNE Mk1 Mod 1
Scout: 80 G-turns with 2G, so we get 20 hours of max thrust
the far trader (Jayhawk A2) has 48 GT, 1G, so 24 hours of thrust
the free trader, 56 G-T, or 28 Ghours, and 1g
The Lord Baltimore Yacht: 32G-T with 4G, so 8 hours
gazelle 112 G-T, 3G With tanks 18h45m max thrust.
	77.6 G-T 5G without tanks  7h45m max thrust
Lab SHip: 96g-t 1G, 48 hours
Patrol Cruiser: 60G-T 4G; 7h30m at max burn
SDB: 112G-T, 4G; 14 hours
Fat Trader: 60G-T 1G; 30 hours
Donosev: 104G-T 2G; 26 hours
Subsidized Liner: 76 G-turns 1G; 38 hours
Merc Cruiser: 48G-T 2G; 12 hours

None of the above includes jump fuel. Low is 7h30m, high is 48.
Of the above, commercial craft (merchants & lab ship): low 24 high 48
Military (rest except yacht): low 7h30m high 26h

Total mission delta-v is usually measured in G-Hours... from launch to
refuel, whether that is far point or RTB. If RTB, that means accellerate,
coast, decellerate, do whatever, accellerate back, coast, decellerate, land.

Heplar may be more realistic, but it meant (IME) PC\'s taking running jumps
constantly, and spending about 3 times as long to get to/from jump points,
and GG\'s became accessable only via jump, as did the outter system. One
group of PC\'s nearly died off due to a misjump using TNE Rules, which put
them in the system, at several thousand AU. (T-Plates can get very tricky
on distances like these, because you run smack into relativity issures, but
with accelleration to 10PSL, 1000au becomes roughly (using an 8.5 lm AU,
not right,but fairly close)(8.5m x 10 x 1000) 85000minutes = 60 days. With
heplar, forget it... find a snowball and jump if you can. If you can\'t,
find a low berth, rig the PP to maintain the LB ONLY and run on as little
power as possible to maintain operation) and pray. Mind you, if the locals
like you, in 6 days they will know you exist, and may send help.

With T-plates, run as little as possible (LS, MD, computer, G-comps,
passive sensor for nav fix) till you hit 10 PSL. THen shut down sensors at
MD at 5PSL or 10PSL, and go to only one computer, and ration the food. (as
established before, water will be recycled if only to keep it out of the
machinery.) You can usually take your remaining (MT/FF&S1) usually 19 days,
and multiply by 5 (you can run at 20% or less often... I can see running a
plant stablely for as low as 10% output). With a T-plate universe, 1000AU
is reachable. Damned inconvinient, but reachable.

in a T-plate universe, the outer system is still a long trip, but is at
least doable with standard craft. In a Heplar (which is STILL
unrealistically efficient, IIRC) universe, a mainworld orbiting a GG is
barely going to have reasonable travel times in the GG\'s moon-system, and
going from planet to planet is much easier by jump in most cases.

(NOTE: I am NOT trying to encourage a Near-C rock discussion)
BTW, is there a formula for time-dilation effects that is simple enough to
use? (I don\'t do calculus, only simple algebra and statisics.)

Lets look at this

    L = 3513 W

The absolute magnitude is then

  I appreciate that your powered maneuver duration is drastically reduced, but
is that a bad thing, and does it really affect how most ships behave in Trav?

  Given that the economics of ship financing have largely killed gas giant
refuelling IIRC (YMMV), at least for shippers in well-travelled areas, then
making M-drive cruises to the outer system longer hardly matters. It will
make some differences to ship designs, esp. for intra-system use, but it
may actually make certain activities easier out there.

  I hope that few CT ships went relativistic often; this also largely
solves the "near-C half-brick in a sock" routine, yes?

  I\'ll assume that they\'re built at shipyards? If you\'re playing in the

instructions about building warships without end-user certificates, no
Scout Ships of Doom, maybe submitting paperwork to INI so they can start

  Yes, but the Terrier SDB is carrying (f4) 10% at MCr 0.7 /ton, while
the Rabid Poodle is maxxed out for combat at (f12) 26% at MCr 1.5 /ton.
At TL 12 they\'re presumably using superdense, which is KCr 14/m^3 in
slabs, so a D-ton should cost MCr 0.196 plus forming and engineering?
(which gives the 1000 Dt Poodle an armour allocation around 50,000 tons!)

  If the "2+2a" formula for armour in HG accounts for engineering and
compartmentalization with the fixed 2% of ship D-tonnage, then the "2a"
should be linear cost based on the material and its\' forming/installation
cost(?). If so, then the Poodle would pay ~2.6 times more its\' armour
(per D-t of ship) than the Terrier rather than the ~5.5 times it pays now.

  If installation is counted in HG\'s MCr 0.1 per Dt hull cgarge then the

  Actually they\'re lead by the Public Accounts auditor who\'s looking
into why the new ship class can\'t power it\'s fusion gun :(  You could
just install batteries in the spare space (although this shouldn\'t
really work in HG/Striker). 

  Alternatively, allow HG designs to be non-standard sizes (i.e., tonnage
may be any value of one or above - <1 would require scaling down output
per Striker) and simply enter EP\'s output, while listing the USP for damage 
purposes as Pn with all fractions dropped.

  Or just design the ship properly the first time...

  You could get around this by adding three lines (#1 listed as second set

Well, IMO, a transponder is never going to be able to "prove" who you are
and I thought saying they existed for that reason didn\'t work.

If they exist, I think they would be mostly to aid navigation (ships are easier
to track and you don\'t have to take time to call them up to find out who they
are).   It does have some benefit to security because it complicates some
situations because ships have to commit to sneaking up (since once they
are detected they have to explain why their transponders were off which
they may or may not be able to do).

That is why I think they exist.

Oh, one other problem with heplars: they eat a large power chunk, in
ADDITION to needing plenty of fuel of their own. And MT/FF&S1 pp\'s (which
are basically identical) do eat a goodly ammount of fuel.

Check TNE, BL. G-Turns of thrust are 1/2 hour of 1G. I was a little low,
but the ships which need endurance lack it severely, and those which don\'t
have it.
looking in TNE Mk1 Mod 1
Scout: 80 G-turns with 2G, so we get 20 hours of max thrust
the far trader (Jayhawk A2) has 48 GT, 1G, so 24 hours of thrust
the free trader, 56 G-T, or 28 Ghours, and 1g
The Lord Baltimore Yacht: 32G-T with 4G, so 8 hours
gazelle 112 G-T, 3G With tanks 18h45m max thrust.
	77.6 G-T 5G without tanks  7h45m max thrust
Lab SHip: 96g-t 1G, 48 hours
Patrol Cruiser: 60G-T 4G; 7h30m at max burn
SDB: 112G-T, 4G; 14 hours
Fat Trader: 60G-T 1G; 30 hours
Donosev: 104G-T 2G; 26 hours
Subsidized Liner: 76 G-turns 1G; 38 hours
Merc Cruiser: 48G-T 2G; 12 hours

None of the above includes jump fuel. Low is 7h30m, high is 48.
Of the above, commercial craft (merchants & lab ship): low 24 high 48
Military (rest except yacht): low 7h30m high 26h

Total mission delta-v is usually measured in G-Hours... from launch to
refuel, whether that is far point or RTB. If RTB, that means accellerate,
coast, decellerate, do whatever, accellerate back, coast, decellerate, land.

Heplar may be more realistic, but it meant (IME) PC\'s taking running jumps
constantly, and spending about 3 times as long to get to/from jump points,
and GG\'s became accessable only via jump, as did the outter system. One
group of PC\'s nearly died off due to a misjump using TNE Rules, which put
them in the system, at several thousand AU. (T-Plates can get very tricky
on distances like these, because you run smack into relativity issures, but
with accelleration to 10PSL, 1000au becomes roughly (using an 8.5 lm AU,
not right,but fairly close)(8.5m x 10 x 1000) 85000minutes = 60 days. With
heplar, forget it... find a snowball and jump if you can. If you can\'t,
find a low berth, rig the PP to maintain the LB ONLY and run on as little
power as possible to maintain operation) and pray. Mind you, if the locals
like you, in 6 days they will know you exist, and may send help.

With T-plates, run as little as possible (LS, MD, computer, G-comps,
passive sensor for nav fix) till you hit 10 PSL. THen shut down sensors at
MD at 5PSL or 10PSL, and go to only one computer, and ration the food. (as
established before, water will be recycled if only to keep it out of the
machinery.) You can usually take your remaining (MT/FF&S1) usually 19 days,
and multiply by 5 (you can run at 20% or less often... I can see running a
plant stablely for as low as 10% output). With a T-plate universe, 1000AU
is reachable. Damned inconvinient, but reachable.

in a T-plate universe, the outer system is still a long trip, but is at
least doable with standard craft. In a Heplar (which is STILL
unrealistically efficient, IIRC) universe, a mainworld orbiting a GG is
barely going to have reasonable travel times in the GG\'s moon-system, and
going from planet to planet is much easier by jump in most cases.

(NOTE: I am NOT trying to encourage a Near-C rock discussion)
BTW, is there a formula for time-dilation effects that is simple enough to
use? (I don\'t do calculus, only simple algebra and statisics.)

  I appreciate that your powered maneuver duration is drastically reduced, but
is that a bad thing, and does it really affect how most ships behave in Trav?

  Given that the economics of ship financing have largely killed gas giant
refuelling IIRC (YMMV), at least for shippers in well-travelled areas, then
making M-drive cruises to the outer system longer hardly matters. It will
make some differences to ship designs, esp. for intra-system use, but it
may actually make certain activities easier out there.

  I hope that few CT ships went relativistic often; this also largely
solves the "near-C half-brick in a sock" routine, yes?

  I don\'t know where ballistic targetting came into this, but I doubt

may be automation in PD functions, even at TL 6-7.

  Three seconds? Engagement range? d=1/2at^2? Show me, please.

  I\'ll assume that they\'re built at shipyards? If you\'re playing in the
Imperium, then logically they\'d be shipyards under 3I supervision, with
instructions about building warships without end-user certificates, no
Scout Ships of Doom, maybe submitting paperwork to INI so they can start
by looking at vessel capabilities?

  I doubt that most campaigns (CT/HG) would allow merchants to buy missile
bays, PA barbettes, and meson guns.

  Yes, but the Terrier SDB is carrying (f4) 10% at MCr 0.7 /ton, while
the Rabid Poodle is maxxed out for combat at (f12) 26% at MCr 1.5 /ton.
At TL 12 they\'re presumably using superdense, which is KCr 14/m^3 in
slabs, so a D-ton should cost MCr 0.196 plus forming and engineering?
(which gives the 1000 Dt Poodle an armour allocation around 50,000 tons!)

  If the "2+2a" formula for armour in HG accounts for engineering and
compartmentalization with the fixed 2% of ship D-tonnage, then the "2a"
should be linear cost based on the material and its\' forming/installation
cost(?). If so, then the Poodle would pay ~2.6 times more its\' armour
(per D-t of ship) than the Terrier rather than the ~5.5 times it pays now.

  If installation is counted in HG\'s MCr 0.1 per Dt hull cgarge then the
armour could be re-assessed as "material value at TL plus % for forming",
thus giving a more rational (?) basis for costing armoured ships.

Thing is, HG lets you do odd-sized hulls.  A size code 9 ship is anything from 
900 to 999 tons.  Just watch your decimal points.

That, too.

You\'re using some other stuff rather than straight HG.  Under HG, your hull 
costs the same whether it\'s mild steel or ferrocement or superdense.  Cost of 
materials is factored into it already.  If you\'re gonna evaluate a HG design, 
set your FS&S on the coffee table and take stuff right from HG.  I see the 
figures for armour bulk as reasonable for HG as it factors in \'inferior\' 
materials at lower tech levels.  The lower your tech, the more bulk you need 
to get the same armour protection on your hull and the more bracing you need 
because your \'state of the art\' is still under developement.

small items (125L boxes {25cm cubes}).

to a 1/2 ton pallet of icecream at the rates shown, moving the goods from
loose to a pallet 2m from the shelves, while in a -10c freezer. Moving the
pallet the 10-15 meters to shrink-wrap took another 2 minutes on average,
including opening and closing the 1/4-ton sliding door. Shrink wrap took
another 5 minutes, and then it was a fairly stable unit. The guys who
worked the wharehouse (I worked the co-located icecream plant) could load
and move faster than I could. BTW, a 1/2ton pallet of ice cream is about 2m
tall, and uses a 1.5x1.5m pallet which is about 7-12 cm tall it\'s self,
weighing about 10kg. Lined up pallets go on trucks at the loading-dock at
the rate of about 1-2 per minute, depending on skill and depth of refer
van, at least that\'s what I\'ve seen done. A full van can be unloaded to the
dock (which is level with the floor of the reefer van floor) in under 15
minutes for a fully palletized load in a 40\' trailer. And about as long to
get the load into the freezer, using about 5 men for each task.

Design by George MacLure, text be me (Robert Prior), editing by DGP (Joe
or Gary, I think). Given the amount of editing and feedback, the coauthor
status is appropriate. Illustration was down after I wrote my text, and I
was happy enough with it.

The Sydkai was intended to operate for months without resupply. Optimized
is correct -- George optimized that ship down to the cubic metre. We had
noticed that the standard naval designs had short durations and required a
fair amount of logistical support, so we came up with a vessel optimized
for patrolling and sufficiently armed for fighting pirates.

Perfect. Just what I was looking for. Many thanks.

So with one station, it takes about two weeks to scan the sky. A pirate
ship is detectable for about a day every rendezvous, which gives a 1/14
chance of being detected, about a 93% chance of being undetected. For two
rendezvous, the chance of remaining undetected is 93%^2 = 86%, and so on. 
If I\'ve done my math correctly, that means that after ten rendezvous there
is better than a 50% chance that the base has been detected. Hardly a
long-term proposition.

This also has implications for deep-penetration spy bases.

I like this idea. Could we assume that unbaffled drives are fairly bright,
getting brighter with age? "Jumpflash baffles" are extra equipment that
reducing the signature of the flash. (Let the gearheads define the
performance parameters.) 

As to jump signature, treat that like sonar signatures now: it takes a
skilled professional to discriminate. Most civilians won\'t even know how,
because they don\'t need to know, while experienced navy sensor ops can
sometimes tell you not only who you are but what brand of parts you used
in your last overhaul.

In game terms:

To identify a ship from its jump signature
Edu + Sensor Ops > Impossible
This task is one to two levels easier if the operator is familiar with the
target, one level more difficult of the operator has _not_ had military
training or experience.

Sorry, light is not my normal band.  It\'s been a few years sence my last
major optical design project.  Most things that can be done with light can
be done cheaper and easier in other ways in the areas that I work in at
least.  Most of my work requires real time data with loop times of a second
or less.

Yeow! Thats one big mother!  Just out of curiousty and as an adventure seed,
what kind of salvage could be gotten from such an array?  As in credit per
ton of the array or support equipment like computers salvaged?  What type of
computer would this base need to run the array?  The rest of the bases gear
would be standard stuff I would assume.  Say if one of these sensor bases
were knocked out with a bioweapon by an enemy spy during a war and the PC
hear a rumor and decide to collect the Credit and accidentally bring back
the bioweapon as well. (Evil grin)

Bruce they are not magic.  No more so that your photo integration technique.
Look in any Omega temperture catalog for simple examples.  They are called
thermal couples.  They do not absorb much heat they just produce electicity
in the presents of heat by converting the molecutar motion caused by heat
into electron motion.  It is a standard condition of dissimiler junctions.
You were right about your baliwick and I admited it once I had the hard
data.  Look at a thermal couple catalog and you will see their basic
operation is as I have discribed.  The why is real long and technical as it
gets into the nature of matter and was part of the theory I was taught 15
years ago in coledge.  This effect is being harness in the last few years to
produce solid state devices that can heat or cool and devices that when
exposed to a heat gradiant produce a decent amount of power, as compared to
basic thermal couples.  When just heated they produce less power.  There is
no magic.  The efficency of these devices is low in the power production
mode.  (less that 10% and varies greatly with type and designed for application)

As for the electricity it goes back into the system to allow a lower total
drain on the batteries.  I supposed a ship running only on batteries to cut
its signature.  The converters were to reuse some of the heat to limit
battery draw and the waste heat associated with battery discharge.  It would
be better to reuse the heat than just waste it.  In effect though you only
reduce the total signature by part of the theoritical saving as when the
heat signature drops, power from the converters drop as well and the power
used per second by the system for work would remain constant once
homeostasis is reached.  Depending on the performance curves of year 5000
thermoelectic devices the heat signature saving could be as high as half the
battery\'s waste heat.  If you insulated the battery compartment and lined it
with thermoelectrics you might see less saving at a considerable cost saving
over lining the hull.  Doing both would produce the best results but cost
the most.

Why do you find the concept fo thermoelectic devices so odd?  You already
work with one of their relatives the photoelectric device.  Thermoelectric
devices are just IR tuned solar cells in theory in practise their makeup is
simpler in some ways and different in others do to a much greater temperture
range.

The current market has been using thermoelectric cooler/heaters for the last
3 years that I am aware of.  Those warmer/ice chests that plug into your
cigerete lighter was one of the first consumer products to use this tech.

The cost/effeciency problem (like with solar cells) are keeping their market
presence low.  Until price per watt drops by a facter of 1000 or more you
are not likly to see these devices outside research labs or satalites.  Oh,
did I mention that one of the other variation on this theme is used in
nuclear batteries?  They are all basicly the same concept.  Some form of
energy is use to push the electron accross the potential barrier of the
junction and free it to flow as electricity.

Gurps is pretty much the same.  With a good gunners and tageting software
it\'s 1 laser one dead missle per turn.  The only way to get misile hits is a
large salvo that closes fast enough to overwhelm the defenses.  It is doable
but not very cost effective.  Those misiles are pricy.

I have my book with me so I looked it up.  I was just reading the space
combat section when this came up.

Do to turn limits in the combat situation you have to shoot a ship or a
missle but not both with each laser.  A scout with one triple laser turret
fired on by 9 missles from 2 seconds out will be hit by three missles if the
gunners involved do not miss.

1st second shoot three misiles  (likely but not curtain)  gunner skill 15 +
15 accuacy +4 aiming +10 computer (very good comp.) +2 active sensor +10
defensive fire  +4 rof =60 - 41 for range 1 = 19  You must role less the 21
on three d6 but 17 and 18 always fail.

With this you can have a 10 or less to kill a missle at 30 hexes.  The
problem is how fast are the misile moving 1g = 1 hex per second accel.
misiles have 6g/TL10 10g/TL12 and a 3 space combat turn duration.

2nd second shoot three missles and get hit by the other three. range 0 role
to hit = 21

3 missles hit if missle gunner role his success number.

missile cost 22kcr each.

Physiology

Unlike most known Human races, the Luriani are a discrete species (Homo 
luriani) and are not interfertile with other Humans. However significant portions 
of the Luriani genome were utilised by Rule of Man geneticists in the 
"construction" of the Scanians, thus the Luriani are interfertile with this branch 
of Humaniti. Matings with other branches of Humaniti will only produce sterile 
offspring.

Physiologically the Luriani are unmistakably human, but they do possess a 
number of unique identifying physical characteristics, however these 
characteristics are only apparent on a close physical inspection. The Luriani 
posses a transparent second eyelid which protects their eyes from pressure 
and irritants, as well as acting to improve their vision under water. They 
possess muscles that can seal the inner ear, protecting it at extreme depths. 
They naturally produce a number of body oils that protect them from cold and 
irritants. Both their feet and hands are webbed. However, their most notable 
adaptations are the fat cells they posses which store oxygen. This allows them 
to collapse their lungs and reach far greater depths (around 500m) than other 
Humans, as well as permitting them to remain in an oxygen free environment 
for up to thirty minutes.

However, distinctive as all of these characteristics are, they are not the most 
remarkable modifications to the Luriani. The most remarkable and influential 
adaptations in the Luriani are found in their brains. At least 93% of all Luriani 
are right brain dominant and their language centres are located in the regions of 
the brain more usually associated with music and singing. These modifications, 
coupled with their close ties with the aquatic environment have produced the 
distinctive features of the Luriani culture.

Culture

Luriani culture is strongly influenced by the right hemisphere nature of their 
brain. The Luriani are a creative, passionate and artistic people. The usual 
Imperial stereotype of the hotblooded Luriani artist does in fact have some 
basis in truth. Luriani music and art frequently reflects the emotional tension 
that lies beneath the surface of their society. Few Humans can fail to be at 
least slightly affected by the pulsating up-tempo bass rhythms of Luriani music, 
even more so when coupled with the sensual nature of Luriani dance. However, 
as with all stereotypes, this ignores the vast sweep of Luriani culture.

Many outside observers characterise Luriani society as being communal; in 
fact the Luriani are very strongly individualistic, but they utilise a form of group 
marriage in which a number of adults will form a distinct family grouping. Any 
children born into the family are regarded as brothers and sisters and all the 
adults will regard them as their children. Because of this, the universal Human 
incest taboo is slightly altered amongst the Luriani. It is accepted that some 
"siblings" will form relationships with their "brothers and sisters" during pubity. 
Such relationships are discouraged, but they are tolerated as long as the 
children do not share a biological parent. However, the relationships between 
the adults within the family are in a constant state of flux.

The Luriani believe in individual and family honour. The Luriani code of honour 
evolved as a mechanism to limit the negative effects of the Lurianis emotional 
nature. Luriani honour holds that effort and intent are far more important than 
actual results; Luriani mythology is replete with stories and examples of heroic 
failure. The three basic tenets of Luriani honour are protect your family; offer 
hospitality to all that seek it; and treat your foes fairly. Unlike many other 
honour codes, the Luriani code does not feature a physical duelling element, 
rather matters of personal honour are settled by "contests. In a contest, the 
two parties will attempt to complete some task or demonstrate mastery of a 
skill, usually artistic. As long as both parties have made given their best, there 
is no stain on ones honour for loosing such a contest. When it comes to 
warfare, the Luriani hold that this is a matter for nations and tribes, not 
individuals; thus war does not remove a Lurianis obligations on a personal 
level, even when serving in the military.

Art

Art is one of the most important elements of Luriani culture, outside of the 
Protectorate art is the most widely recognised aspect of their culture. Luriani 
art reflects the turbulent and restless nature of their society, very little Luriani 
art can be classified as static, the essence of their art is the movement and 
energy found in their culture. The most prominent Luriani art form is of course 
music, but they are also drawn to most other performance arts (dance is 
almost as widely practiced as music). Other art forms such as painting and 
sculpture are less common, but none the less are still considered noble and 
honourable professions.

Luriani music is distinctive and unique; the most obvious defining characteristic 
is its 10/8 time signature. However, it also possesses a number of other very 
distinctive characteristics. Virtually all Luriani music makes extensive use of 
the voice as an instrument; and slight differences in Luriani physiology has 
resulted their vocal cords being longer than the Human norm, contributing to 
the strong base tendencies in their music. Luriani singing also features a 
secondary voiced note when inhaling in addition to the usual note when 
exhaling, leading to a distinctive "breathy" sound (this effect is remarkably 
difficult for non-Luriani to reproduce, lacking the Lurianis internal independent 
oxygen source).

Fashion

Traditional Luriani clothing and appearance is almost as distinctive and powerful 
as their music. Many have likened their fashions to those of the Vargr. 
Traditional Luriani clothing is lightweight and lose fitting, intended to 
simultaneously functional and sensual. Luriani fashions are intended to be 
provocative and revealing, whilst maintaining a sense of mystery. The concept 
of utilitarian clothing that does not serve this purpose appears to be entirely 
alien to the Luriani. Thus, all Luriani clothing has to serve this dual purpose (the 
Luriani were scandalised by the Solomani and their "sack-like ship suits"). 
Luriani fashions do not use muted or subdued colours; their clothing features 
many irregular blocks of strong discordant colours with sharp dividing lines 
between them. These blocks swirl and interlock, with the intention of giving a 
sense of movement and energy. The intention of the designer is to draw 
attention to certain parts of the body and away from others. Likewise, the 
Luriani make extensive use of body decorations. Rather than using permanent 
forms of body markings such as tattoos, the Luriani use a variety of body 
paints and dyes to adorn themselves. The final result is that the average Luriani 
is a sight to behold; dressed in their vibrant clothing with their bodies painted 
and dyed in many bright contrasting colours and shapes; one can not fail to 
recognise them immediately.

The Luriani are a Human minor race transported to their new home by the 
mysterious Ancients some 300,000 years ago. Whilst the Luriani are 
unmistakably Human they have several unique and distinct characteristics 
which are a result of both natural evolution and genetic tampering by the 
Ancients. The Luriani are often referred to as "aquatic" Humans. This is not 
strictly true, for although they are far more at home in a water environment than 
most Humans these adaptations do not go as far as the Solomani geenered 
Scanians. Luriani have distinctively webbed hands and feet; certain fat cells 
have the ability to store oxygen which allows the Luriani to remain submerged 
for up to 30 minutes and reach depths of up to 500 metres without any artificial 
assistance. They possess a clear second eyelid under the first that greatly 
enhances their vision underwater. However perhaps their most striking 
modifications are not readily apparent at all. Unlike virtually all other Human 
races, the Luriani are overwhelmingly right brain dominant and their language 
ability is located in the centre of the brain which normally deals with singing 
rather than the classic speech centres. It would appear that these 
modifications were introduced to enable the Luriani to function well in a three 
dimensional environment. This has lead to further speculation that the Ancients 
intended to make the Luriani fully aquatic but the Final War intervened, leaving 
the Luriani "unfinished. Because of these modifications the Luriani are 
overwhelmingly (at least 93%) lefthanded, intensely creative and artistic, and 
have a strong tendency towards music and other performance arts.

Daramm (the Luriani homeworld) is officially classified as a waterworld, with 
only 5% of its surface being land. However, this is still 19.7 million km2. 
Daramm is a normal world with eleven continental plates, but these are mostly 
below sea level. Thus, Daramm is covered by a large number of continental 
sized island archipelagos surrounded by shallow (150m to 300m) seas. These 
"continents" are surrounded by deep (2000m to 5000m) oceans. It would 
appear that the Ancients initially deposited the Luriani on several islands in one 
of these archipelagos.

The semi-aquatic nature of the Luriani enabled them to utilise the shallow seas 
around their island homes for hunting and gathering, thus allowing for far greater 
populations and development than might have otherwise been expected. 
However eventually the restricted nature of their island homes started to limit 
their development. These growing pressures lead to the development of 
seafaring on Daramm far before the Luriani had even developed anything even 
remotely like civilisation. It is theorised that the creative nature of the Luriani 
brain played a crucial role in this. Thus in approximately -250,000 the Luriani 
developed seagoing vessels whilst they were still a primitive hunter-gatherer 
society. By -150,000, the Luriani had developed oceangoing vessels capable of 
circumnavigating their entire world despite still possessing only a TL0 culture. It 
was the possession of this maritime capacity that preserved the remarkable 
homogeneity of Luriani culture, despite being separated by thousands of 
kilometres of water, each Luriani settlement was connected by a web of 
voyaging ships. Indeed some Luriani lived out their entire lives at sea, only 
setting foot on land to gather supplies or build new ships.

Given this voyaging culture it was only natural that the Luriani should quickly 
come to the concept of trade and commerce, thus giving rise to the first signs 
of Luriani civilisation. By -100,000 the Luriani had developed a thriving world 
spanning barter economy. The huge nomadic voyaging ships travelling between 
islands, trading with the various island communities. However with the rise of 
trade came the rise of piracy and warfare. Both the seagoing nomads and the 
island dwelling settlements found a need for fighters to defend against the 
depredations of raiders, which would eventually evolve into the Luriani warrior 
class. Thus by -30,000 the Luriani had established a world spanning trading 
civilisation complete with organised warfare, despite the fact that they were still 
a TL0 hunter gatherer culture without any domesticated animals or form of 
agriculture.

Over the next 23,000 years the Luriani gradually improved their technology and 
culture. In around -28,000 the first signs of agriculture appeared on a number of 
islands, animals were domesticated around -25,000. Metalworking was 
achieved around -15,000. When Vilani influenced traders contacted the Luriani 
in -7500 they had advanced to a solid TL3. The Luriani were to prove to be 
extremely adept in absorbing advanced technology; and by -7200 they had 
achieved TL9 and were launching their first "voyaging" ships to the stars. By -
6000 they had established a vigorous interstellar culture encompassing over 30 
worlds (most located to spinward of Daramm). However the Luriani never 
grasped the concept of an interstellar state (much as they have never truly 
developed a world spaning government) and their worlds remained a loose 
grouping closely bound by their voyaging culture. However, this somewhat 
idyllic situation was not to remain.

In -5400 the Vilani began the Consolidation Wars. Initially the Vilani ignored the 
Luriani. Located far to trailing on the fringes of explored space, the Vilani 
regarded their independent worlds as a minor threat compared with the many 
organised interstellar states that they faced. This was to prove to be a 
miscalculation on the Vilani\'s part. When in around -4700 the Vilani began 
efforts to incorporate the Luriani they responded by rapidly forming a united 
front to face the common enemy. Early Vilani attempts to incorporate the 
Luriani by economic pressure failed and in 4582 the Vilani opened the Luriani 
Consolidation War.

The initial Vilani offensives were turned back with heavy losses in the face of 
determined resistance. The Luriani proved to be formidable opponents for the 
Vilani, the nature of their brains made three-dimensional combat second nature 
to the Luriani and their warrior class made very efficient fighters. However 
eventually the superior economic weight of the Vilani began to tell and one by 
one the Luriani worlds fell to the advancing Vilani fleets. In -4547 Daramm fell 
and the Luriani were defeated. Despite several revolts they were to remain 
under Vilani rule until the coming of the Solomani in 2223.

When the Vilani conquered the Luriani in -4547 they attempted to impose their 
culture on the Luriani; Vilani governors were placed in control of Luriani worlds 
and the Luriani were expected to conform to Vilani cultural norms. These efforts 
were less than successful, though the Luriani did remain firmly under the 
control of the Vilani, their culture remained largely intact, the Vilani were never 
able to stamp out the emotional and independent nature of the Luriani. Thus 
when the Solomani arrived in the Ley sector in -2223 they were greeted as 
liberators by the Luriani. They allied themselves with the Terrans and a number 
of Luriani units served in the Terran forces during their final drive on Vland, 
proving that they had lost none of their fighting abilities. With the final defeat of 
the Vilani in -2219 the Luriani expected that the Solomani would restore their 
independence. However they were to be sadly disappointed. Unlike the Geonee 
or Suerrat, the Luriani were not granted autonomy under the Rule of Man. 
Naturally this bred resentment with in the Luriani and in -2186 the Luriani 
rebelled against the Rule of Man. What followed was a tragedy for the Luriani. 
Isolated with only a limited production base, the Luriani faced an alliance of 
both Terran and Vilani forces. The Luriani hoped that the other minor races 
would come to their aid. These hopes proved futile and the Luriani were 
gradually worn down and in -2180 their final stronghold fell and in a cruel turn of 
fate, the Luriani again came under Vilani occupation. However under the Rule of 
Man, Luriani art and music found a wide audience amongst the Solomani; and 
this lead to widespread sympathy for the fate of the Luriani. Finally, in -1932 
Empress Juliana established the Luriani Cultural Region. With this, the each 
individual Luriani world was granted internal self-rule, answering to a Solomani 
planetary governor, with the entire region under the control of a military governor 
general.

With the collapse of the Rule of Man in -1776, the Solomani governor general of 
the Luriani Cultural Region found herself isolated and vulnerable. Admiral 
Martinez solved her problems by reaching an agreement with the Luriani. She 
transformed the Luriani Cultural Region into the Luriani Protectorate. Under this 
compromise, her fleet provided protection for the Luriani in return for support, 
while the Luriani worlds were allowed to retain their independence. The 
Protectorate continued to exist into the Long Night; the Protectorate gradually 
evolved into a unique government. The Solomani provided the much needed 
skills to administer a large-scale interstellar government, whilst the Luriani 
provided the necessary support facilities and their warrior class came to 
dominate the Protectorate fleet. Eventually however the Long Night claimed the 
Protectorate, by -1200 the Protectorate fleet had dwindled to just a handful of 
vessels and contact between the worlds had all but ceased. In -1183, Protector 
De Valine acknowledged that the Protectorate could no longer defend the 
Luriani worlds. The Solomani settled on the Luriani worlds and the Luriani 
Protectorate succumbed to the Long Night.

The situation remained unchanged until the coming of the Syleans. The Sylean 
Federation Scout Service reached the Luriani in -29. The arrival of the SFSS 
reawakened the Luriani\'s desires for the stars, Daramm had been able to retain 
TL8 throughout the Long Night, and the Solomani remained a distinct racial 
grouping. Given the prod of the Syleans arrival, the Luriani applied themselves 
to regaining the stars. It took the Luriani just 30 years to recover to TL9 and 
begin to reestablish the Protectorate. By 12, the Luriani Protectorate was a 
thriving interstellar community once more, encompassing most worlds within 5 
parsecs of Daramm. The Protectorate was a curious state, one that the new 
Imperium found hard to understand or deal with. The bulk of the population was 
Luriani by culture, but virtually all the higher levels of administration were 
provided by the Solomani Verasti (Protectors). Eventually the Imperium was 
forced to do something about the Luriani. Initially they tried to incorporate the 
Luriani through diplomatic means and initially this appeared to be a making 
progress, but negotiations stumbled on the Protectorate demand to be allowed 
to retain its identity within the Empire. It was then that Archduke Ishargi of 
Gateway made a huge error of judgement. Believing that a show of force would 
soften the Lurianis negotiating stance, Archduke Ishargi took a sizeable 
Imperial squadron and jumped to Rurur (an important frontier system inside the 
Protectorate). The result was a disaster. By sheer fluke, a substantial portion of 
the Protectorate fleet was conducting exercises in the Rurur system at the 
time. The Protectorate commander (Admiral Sherin) took this action to be the 
opening of an invasion and engaged the Imperial forces. In the resulting Luriani 
War (93-96), the Protectorate forces showed that the Luriani had lost none of 
their flare for three-dimensional warfare and inflicted several sharp defeats on 
the Imperial forces. Eventually cooler heads on both sides prevailed and a face 
saving negotiated settlement was reached. However the Luriani War was to 
leave a legacy of mistrust and tensions between the Protectorate and the 
Imperium remained high for many decades after the war.

With the end of the Luriani War Emperor Artemsus appointed an Imperial born 
Verasti, Duke Sirean of Dirir, as the new Archduke of Gateway (Archduke 
Ishargi had been killed at Rurur). Sirean chose to concentrate his efforts on 
incorporating the rimward portions of Ley sector, whilst attempting to repair 
relations with the Protectorate. Eventually this policy was to bear fruit. By 160, 
the memories of the Luriani War were fading and relations between the 
Protectorate and the Imperium were beginning to improve. However, by this 
time the situation elsewhere had changed. In the Domain of Antares events 
were moving towards the Julian War and securing the rimward flank of Antares 
had become a matter of some urgency. In 162, Archduke Acla reopened 
negotiations with the Protectorate regarding incorporation. These negotiations 
proceeded slowly as a considerable legacy of mistrust remained and had not 
yielded any positive results by the outbreak of the Julian War in 175. 
Throughout most of the Julian War the Protectorate chose to remain neutral 
until the Star Legion drove into Ley in 185. At this point, much to the surprise of 
the Imperium, the Protectorate offered an alliance and joined the War on the 
Imperial side. Though the entry of the Protectorate had little effect on the 
ultimate outcome of the war, Luriani forces were an important factor in halting 
and turning back the Star Legions drive into Ley. With the end of the war in 
191, negotiations resumed on a more positive note and in 202 the Protectorate 
was incorporated into the Imperium.

IIRC, transponders only respond to specific signals (based in concept, I
would suspect, on World War II-era IFF devices).  If that\'s the case,
then, unless the pirate had the current IFF codes for whatever force
he/she/it was trying to impersonate, the transponder wouldn\'t respond
appropriately to being interrogated by the IFF, and would therefore be
marked as hostile.

Oh goody - a KKM debate to go with the fighter debate and the piracy

"if the bloody things get through", of course, is the hard part -
for reasonable laser technology
(let alone the really good lasers in GT or just-plain-T) hitting an
incoming kinetic impact missile is remarkably easy; certainly for the
space/price of a figher you can fit in a point defence laser that
can eat up many many times its weight in impact missiles (at least
in FFS2; but presumably also in GURPS - it\'ll be interesting to try
this once I get a copy of GURPS.)

in the practice combat we ran for our TCS campaign, a 200DT SDB was hit by
8 missiles. 4 of them got through the point defense.  the vector was
small(only 3 hexes) and she had heavy armor (IIRC DR4000) so she was only
crippled.

If I were in your campaign, I would set my transponder to say that I was an
Imperial Navy destroyer, at least when I was anywhere I thought I could get
away with it.  That would keep the pirates away, now wouldn\'t it?  Even
better, if I were a pirate, I would put that on my transponder so that the
locals wouldn\'t mind me watching over their system for a few days from 3AU

For reference:

My friend Ian (a physicist) once calculated that his free trader starship
should be glowing red when running at full power. MegaTraveller starships
are really hot!  After verifying that I had given him the correct _gaming_
statistics, he then decided to lump it under the "suspension of disbelief"
catagory, and went off muttering about "scientific illiterates trying to
repeal the law of gravity" -- which is when i told him about contragrav :-)

The solutions are:

1) Lower Traveller power requirements to more reasonable levels, and keep
realistic sensor rules.

2) Keep power requirements, and accept the easy detectability of starships.

3) Keep power requirements, and lower sensor sensitivity as well to
maintain some level of ship stealth (same effects as 1, different
mechanism).

Possibly we should have a new geek code?

Yes, but the Grand Chamberlain or whatever the master of ceremonies is called
could hardly have expected that, now could he? As far as he is concerned,
Dulinor has asked for a formal meeting with the Emperor, precisely one where
it would be inappropiate to use a substitute. The Emperor is unavailable. A
few minutes after the meeting starts Dulinor can be expected to realize that
he is not facing the Emperor. Wouldn\'t you have told him in advance and
most humbly begged his pardon? I would.

OH, I forget, the Grand Chamberlain was not informed. (In fact, no one appears
to know that the impostor is missing from his usual appartment either). I
guess Iolanthe went to fetch the stand-in himself. Well, substitute Iolanthe
for the Grand Chamberlain in the argument above.

As a matter of curiosity I sat down and made a list of the fleets from the
map in _Rebellion_. As it is 320 lines long I won\'t post it, but anyone
who wants a copy can just e-mail me for it.
Summary: The following fleets are not shown on the map: 77th, 118th, 131st,
189th, 256th, 274th, 303rd, 315th, 316th, 317th, 318th, 319th, 320th.

Ignoring the four fleets mentioned in the text as constituting the Corridor
Fleet (presumably erroneously), the following fleet numbers are duplicated:
108th, 128th, 179th, 193th, 212th, 213th (triplicated!), 214th, 255th, 260th.

Also there are a number of subsectors with a sliver of Imperial worlds in them
that does not have fleets assigned, some of the slivers quite as big as those
of some subsectors that do have fleets. I didn\'t list them or try to go
deeper into that.

There\'s no shortage of people willing to try something stupid in order to
get rich. No argument there. But to rob a bank all you need is a $50 gun
(or a $5 toy gun). How many stupid fools that owns (or controls) a MCr30

With those odds you need 1000 fools with MCr30 tools for each successful

Media has played a large role in one of the games I am in currently, in 
the form of one very pushy reporter. He went from being the biggest 
thorn in our side to the only NPC in the game we trusted in fairly short 
order.

In other games, knowing how the media operates in conjunction/relation 
to the government is very important. For some reason we always check 
the news channels for information. Of course, if there is a great deal of 
censorship going on, or the media is all owned, overtly or covertly, by 
one source/political persuasion/etc. then that information is suspect at 
best and should be viewed as such.

I would say that this information is important.

Where? Not previously in that particular essay. Elsewhere we\'re told that
CruRons typically have 4-8 cruisers and we\'re told of some BatRons that have
8 battleships. And elsewhere we\'re told of some squadrons with 4-5 capital
ships.

Unless they\'re atypical. We have at least one example of an oversized
squadron.

But I\'ll back down and say that there are discrepancies either way, so your
interpretation is also possible. The real kicker is that it is difficult
enough to spend the canonical naval budget if we assume 2000 capital ships
per sector. If we assume only 1000 capital ships we either have to reduce
the budget drastically or see the number of auxiliaries go through the
roof (you can get hundreds of escorts for the price of ONE battleship.)

I know what you\'re going to say: Then let\'s reduce the budget. That\'s
certainly an option. Let\'s examine it: 

Let\'s take a look at the figure I\'ve been using to base the Imperial budget
on, an average of 3% of GWP on military spending.

First question: Is it canonical?

Answer: Yes. Despite what anyone may think, _Striker_ is no less canonical
than any other official source. And _Striker_, Book 2, p. 38 says:

"The average expenditure of a nation or world on its military is 3% of GNP;
on worlds where the state of international tension is high, this may range
as high as 15%; where little conflict has been experienced for extended
periods of time the military budget may be as low as 1% of GNP.
        The total military budget must be divided between the army and the
navy. The proportion allocated to the army averages 40% on most worlds, but
averages only 6% on worlds with vacuum or trace atmospheres. Planetary
defenses are jointly funded by the army and navy; the referee must decide
what effect this will have on the army budget.
        On Imperial worlds, roughly 30% of the total military budget goes to
the Imperium for maintenance of the Imperial military. On independent worlds,
the entire budget is available for local defense."

Second question: Does this figure conflict with other canonical material?

Answer: Yes, of course. That\'s why we\'re having this discussion. What
information we have about the Imperial Navy strength seems to indicate a
much lower figure. If the 1000 combat ship per sector figure is for the
regular navy only, then 3% appears to be 2-3 times too big; if the figure
includes the colonial fleets too, then the figure appears 4-6 times too big.
Unless the peacetime IN has a HUGE number of ships laid up in ordinary, that
is.

Also, the figure is low if compared to the figures that _Trillion Credit
Squadron_ and _Pocket Empires_ provide. TCS use 5% on the Navy alone, no
mention of the army; PE figures are fluid, but can reach 20-30% IIRC (I may
be a bit off here).

Q: Could the _Striker_ information be explained away as changed from the
correct one to enhance game play?

A: I don\'t see how. Does _Striker_ games work better if the armies are three
or six times bigger than the \'real\' armies? What possible reason could there
be for giving too high a figure? I can see why you may want to reduce the
forces involved to simplify game play (That\'s how I explain the forces in the
_Fifth Frontier War_ boardgame). But why make them too high?

Q: So is 3% of GWP unrealistic in itself? Can we dismiss it on the grounds
that no society could possibly afford such heavy expenditures?

A: No. Real World examples makes it abundantly clear that at least some
societies can survive with peacetime expenditures far higher than that. That
dosen\'t mean that someone laying down ground rules for the economies of high
tech or high population societies in his SF gameworld couldn\'t claim that
such societies are less able to afford military spendings. At least no one
could point to a Real World example of a TL 15 high-pop society and
contradict him. But that\'s not the case here. _Sriker_ says that high-tech,
high-population societies CAN afford it, and the Real World does not say them
nay. So we can\'t dismiss it as inherently unrealistic.

Q: Is it unrealistically low, then? During the cold war some societies spent
far more than that, and the Imperium is in two or three cold wars at the
moment (Confederation, Consulate, League).

A: Perhaps a little. But OTOH, the Imperium is bigger than both (or all
three) its cold war opponents together. Not much bigger, but bigger. So I\'d
be inclined to accept it, just to avoid making things worse.

Q: So why can\'t we reduce it to 1 or 0.5%?

A: That, as I\'ve had pointed out to me repeatedly, is not a question of
logic but of individual perception of plausibility. I for one have trouble
enough accepting the 3% as realistic, given the Imperium\'s history of
conflict with the Solomani and Zhodani, but I\'m quite aware that others
are... less sceptical. All I can say is that I do not accept that 0.5% is
so obviously far more likely than 3%.

Q: But adjusting the Imperial force levels would also create canon trouble,
wouldn\'t it?

A: Yes. Whichever way you resolve the discrepancy you get into trouble. But
on the one hand we have a general rule and on the other specific details. If
you settle on a plausible general rule and try to fix as many of the specific
details as you can, you end up with a basic system that works well. If you
change the general rule to something implausible then you wind up with a
system that does not work well, laying down problems for the future.

Heh. That could also mean that they are in better training than the idle,
slothful Imperial Navy ;-). But OK, I\'ll give you that. Only, whare does
it say that the training takes place in orbit around the high population
worlds?

Again, I\'ll grant you that. Now tell me, if the colonial spacemen serve the
same number of years and get the same training as Imperial spacemen, how can
this be true?

So it says. But does it make sense? Try this little thought experiment:

You\'re the Duchess Delphine of Mora. You and the IN Quartermaster General for
Mora have just pocketed two checks for this year\'s Imperial naval budget
split right down the middle (You\'ve also got a check for Mora System\'s
military budget, but we\'ll ignore that since you got that one wearing a
different hat). On your budget you have a post named "New ships: 25%" (25% of
10% is 2.5%; this will completely replace your fleet in 40 years). According
to _High Guard_ you may procure the ships from any shipyard inside the
subsector. Obviously you\'re also allowed to buy them from the IN. So you lean
across the table and ask the QM if he has any good bargains. "Why yes," he
replies, "As usually the Navy is getting rid of 1/40th of its ships. I can
offer you some lovely 40 year old TL 14 ships for 25% of original price. Of
course, you have to pay as much for maintaining them as if they were new.[*]"

[*] Propably more, but let\'s not open that can of worms.

So you have the choice between buying some obsolescent, 40 year old, TL 14
clunkers from the IN or to buy some brand new, top of the line, TL 15 ships
from your own shipyards. What would YOU prefer?

But let\'s say you are a glowing patriot or have some other reason to buy
from the IN. Let\'s also say that your need for different ship types exactly
match the mix the IN can offer you. Let\'s further say that none of the ships
the IN built 40 years ago have been lost since. You\'ve now spent one fourth
of your procurement budget. What do you do with the rest? Do you ask if you
can buy a few more ships from the IN? In that case the QM will regretfully
inform you that his colleagues have sold all the obsolescent ships of their
subsectors to your fellow dukes. There are no more ships to be had. So how-
ever reluctant you are to benefit your subsector with procurement orders, it
looks like you will have to order a few new ships from your local shipyards.
Of course, if you are lucky enough to have some TL 13 or 14 planets with
shipyards, you can avoid the awful prospect of getting TL 15 ships in your
navy. And if you really insist, I suppose you can get them to use old designs
so that the ship is obsolescent from the start.

From experience I know that there are people who don\'t recognize a _reductio
ad absurdum_ argument when they see it (I\'m not referring to you, but there
are some), so I\'ll be specific: The above scenario shows (IMO) that the
concept of a colonial fleet consisting solely of obsolescent IN castoffs does
not agree with the procurement rules. "But it says so right here in the
book!" I hear you cry. Yes it does. Another discrepancy. Is there a way to
explain it away? I believe so:

Some subsector fleets ARE exactly as the description has it, composed of
obsolescent IN castoffs. The Duke of Lunion, for example, would be happy to
buy obsolescent IN ships, because the best he can procure locally is TL 13
(I still think he\'d buy some local TL 13 designs, but maybe not). And dukes
of subsectors with TL 14 high-pop planets would still be interested in IN
TL 15 retirees. Even dukes with TL 15 planets would buy _some_ ships from
the IN. And those are the ships the public hears about. "DELPHINE BUYS
CLUNKERS! BUY LOCAL, SAYS UNION BOSS!!!" the headlines of the opposition
press and the yellow press will say, forgetting to mention that she is only
buying a few clunkers and many local ships.

What do you think? Generally I dislike "that\'s not the truth, that\'s what the
public thinks is the truth" explanations, but if they are the best one can
come up with I think they\'re better than nothing.

>...the 50-200 ship numbers do not specify if this is combatant only or
>non-combatants and combatants.

No, but it is quite likely. I\'ll grant you that they _could_ be speaking of
both kind. But just above the text has specifically mentioned that auxiliaries
are excluded. Later when they do begin to talk about auxiliaries too they
specifically mention them and even state that they are often ignored when
figuring ship totals.

>I would say this is both combatants and non-combatants, thus the average
>31.25 combatants per fleet would be a good number.

For reasons I\'ve stated in my reply to Gary, I disagree. 

>>the Imperial Navy propably have huge numbers of ships laid up and that
>>that is the reason the peacetime navy is so comparatively small?
> 
>The navy has huge reserves at the depots, but Norris did not have access

He had access to the Deneb Depot. And does the notion that the majority of
the Imperial reserves are stored at the Depots meet the reality check? Not
IMO. The proper place to store ships in ordinary is surely spread out around
the shipyards that are going to do the work of reactivating them, isn\'t it?
Otherwise you have a few thousand ships orbiting Depot and no way to
reactivate them.

Most of the calculations appear to be assuming that all of the energy is 
radiated uniformly in all directions from the hull in the form of heat. 
As has been pointed out, the energy has to go somewhere, but there are 
other ways of getting rid of it. One approach would be to convert the 
heat to another form of energy, say laser light or microwaves, that 
could be directed outward into interstellar space. The process would not 
be 100% efficient, but should reduce the signature of the ship 
significantly as seen from inside the solar system. Another ship further 
out passing through the radiated beam, however, would see a tremendous 
signature. A starting guess would be that, with improved technologies, 
90% or more of a ship\'s excess energy could be beamed away from the 
inner solar system. This would be a form of stealth and would require 
special equipment.

Since very few ships spend much time outside of the Oort cloud, it would 
be very unlikely that the beamed energy would be detected. 

Glad to be back on the TML!

I live in the Bay Area (San Francisco), and whenever there is ANY kind of
economic down-turn, the Latino immigrants are the first to be targeted for
scapegoating.  Right now, now that the economy is great, the "problem" is
ignored.  But I\'m SURE as soon as the job market takes a dive, we\'ll have
more anti-immigrant propositions on the ballot.  It\'s pretty disgusting,
really.

One can probably think of tricks to make the rendezvous harder to
detect. For example, put a big honkin tractor (TNE/T4) on the
pirate base to reel ships in without having them use any of their
own fuel...I also haven\'t really done the analysis for how far away
from the base you\'re likely to arrive due to usual jump errors (some
TU\'s would have jump errors be bigger that far from a big mass); 
maybe an ion drive or chemical drive could get you to the base.
(Using HEPlaR would be like writing "come and kill me" in big letters
even if you only used it for a few minutes...)

Dinky little radiators on the inside of the cargo bay doors (this is why

is that its life support and functions only require a few kilowatts - it
has much less heat to dispose of than a traveller ship. (In fact, sunlight
heat loading might be a major part of the problem.)

I\'m not 100% sure we can redo *everything* to the point where you only
need a little power and can get by with tiny radiators, though - weapon
power, for example, will probably always include 10% waste, and always

Gurps is pretty much the same.  With a good gunners and tageting software
it\'s 1 laser one dead missle per turn.  The only way to get misile hits is
a
large salvo that closes fast enough to overwhelm the defenses.  It is
doable
but not very cost effective.  Those misiles are pricy.
*****************
I agreee about the chances to hit,  in the game we ran one turret stopped 4
missiles (but 4 more got through)

I have my book with me so I looked it up.  I was just reading the space
combat section when this came up.
Do to turn limits in the combat situation you have to shoot a ship or a
missle but not both with each laser.
************
GT 169  a weapon may be fired in point defense even it it engaged another
target in the direct fire phase.



1st second shoot three misiles  (likely but not curtain)  gunner skill 15 +
15 accuacy +4 aiming +10 computer (very good comp.) +2 active sensor +10
defensive fire  +4 rof =60 - 41 for range 1 = 19  You must role less the 21
on three d6 but 17 and 18 always fail.
*************
I get: 15+15acc +10comp +2 active sensor +10pd +4rof -39 Range (PD fire may
only be taken against ramming attempts.) = 17 or less for the first missile
each additional missile engaged is a further -2 to hit. he does however
have 3 lasers so can roll 3 times on each attempt.  this gives him
17,15,13,11,9,7,5,3,1 that he needs to roll against for point defense...so
most likely 2-3 missile hits.


With this you can have a 10 or less to kill a missle at 30 hexes.
*****************888
the TL 12 lasers only have a range of 8 hexes.


 The
problem is how fast are the misile moving 1g = 1 hex per second
********************
per turn...not per second (turns are 20 min long)




3 missles hit if missle gunner role his success number.
***************
it is actually a contest of skills for the pilot of the ship and the
missile gunner this hapens before PD fire, and missile that miss can be
ignored for that turn (they may have enough Dv to loop around and come
back).


**********8
what Charles neglects to mention is the effects of velocity on damage...if
there is only a modest vector differnce between the ship and the missile
(say 5 hexes) even one can do massive damage to a scout....

the missile (best case only one gets through) will do 6dx500 (5). the scout
has DR 200, so effective DR is 40....assuming average damage for the
missile 3.5*6*500=10,500 -40 = 10,460. the scout has 15,000 Hp and so will
take 6 critical hits (6 rolls on the major damage table) almost certan to
be crippled, possibly a floating wreck....)

I guess the turret radiators could be facing away from the launch
side--you always know that at least the guy you\'re shooting at won\'t
see that radiation :-)

Drives are the other big culprit. Traveller TL15 military ships do
6gs. That\'s a lot of power.

Some subsector fleets ARE exactly as the description has it, composed of
obsolescent IN castoffs. The Duke of Lunion, for example, would be happy to
buy obsolescent IN ships, because the best he can procure locally is TL 13
(I still think he\'d buy some local TL 13 designs, but maybe not). And dukes
of subsectors with TL 14 high-pop planets would still be interested in IN
TL 15 retirees. Even dukes with TL 15 planets would buy _some_ ships from
the IN. And those are the ships the public hears about. "DELPHINE BUYS
CLUNKERS! BUY LOCAL, SAYS UNION BOSS!!!" the headlines of the opposition
press and the yellow press will say, forgetting to mention that she is only
buying a few clunkers and many local ships.

He had access to the Deneb Depot. And does the notion that the majority of

IMO. The proper place to store ships in ordinary is surely spread out

Otherwise you have a few thousand ships orbiting Depot and no way to

Even if you aren\'t within 100D of the star, you need to _miss_ that 100D sphere

the star in the way -- for earth, jumping to somewhere on the ecliptic would
require travelling a good part of an AU for about 5 months of the year.

For our worst examples, the spinward marches include a number of M II giants...
the concept of having to travel 5-10 AU to jump would be rather unappealing to

That\'s incorrect.  A single gunner controls a single _turret_.  If he wanted to
fire the three weapons separately (rather than as a battery) he\'d be at -4 to
all of them.  He gets one shot, with a +1 for the # of weapons (this is a
problem, it means triple turrets are useless because you get the same bonus
from a double turret, but...)

Funny you should mention the Gazelle; The text in Traders and Gunboats
(Supplement 7 of the LBBs) indicated that the layout of decks in the
Gazelle was *specifically* designed to seperate the enlisted crew from the
officers and provide the officers with a defensable bridge area in the
event of a mutiny.

Comments of others aside, and other factors affecting piracy
notwithstanding, I don\'t think its difficult for an undercrewed ship to
operate.  Like the sailing ships of old, military vessels are heavily
overcrewed due to the needs of combat and the desire for extra coverage for
watches and such.  If procedures are changed, maintenance schedules allowed
to slip, etc, a vessel like a Gazelle could be run with only 4 crewmembers
(out of 12) for most of the time (I\'m thinking two watchstanders, one in
engineering, one on the bridge, in rotating 8 or 12 hour shifts).

A British Frigate in the West Indies mutinied in the late 1700s over the
behavior of their captain (described in _The Black Ship_ I can\'t recall the
vessels name).  They did not turn pirate, but they turned themselves in to
a Spainish port, where some stayed awhile, but most dispersed themselves to
the four winds, some even returning home to England, several signed on
privateers or pirates, many went to America, and many simply were not heard
of again.  All the ones we know about were eventually hung.  Some, however,
seem to have successfully mutinied.

I believe that of the 130 or so on board, 30-50 were "active" mutineers,
60-80 were "passive participants" who obeyed orders of the mutineers once
the killing was over, and the remainder were either killed and thrown
overboard or just thrown overboard.  Several asked that they be considered
prisoners of war when they arrived in the Spainish port.  I think that with
treatment of the more professional Imp Navy personnel you would expect many
fewer to participate or allow a mutiny to occur, so I would not expect an
Imperial Navy vessel much larger than a Gazelle to be subject to a mutiny.

Other navies (local navies with SDBs) might be different.

Now, a British Frigate in 1800 could not, in the end, escape the British
Navy and remain on Earth, so there is not really a good analogy to an
Imperial Navy ship near an open border, like the Vargr Extents or the
Trojan Reach, where many local nation-states would pay nicely for a
Gazelle.  On the other paw, The Imperial Navy would do it\'s damndest (like
the RN) to hunt down and kill every last perpetrator of a mutiny in hopes
that this would discourage imitators.

In any case there is that reference to mutiny in LBB Supp. 7 which even
prompted a *design change* on a common Impy Navy ship.

No I did not, The thermalelectrics were ment to cut signature by
suplimenting the battery power so that less power would need to be draw from
the batteries.  Discharging batteries causes true waste heat.  Reusing power
by partial heat recovery does not produce any more waste heat than the heat
caused by the use of that power.  It is more efficient than battery power as
far as waste heat is concurned but because the system is loosing heat into
space you will need to replace that lost power from the batteries but not as
much as you would have to without the heat recovery system.

The idea is to reduce the heat signature too 300k or less by running only on
battery power.  No operating fussion plant.

One able to survive some rigorous treatment.  20000k is a lot of heat.  What
happens when this ship lands in water?  The vane will make a tempting target
for laser gunners.  No vane no power.  The ship would burn up without it if
the reater is running.  If you use those efficency numbers.

You know that is not posible.  I\'ve already eat my crow on this subject
thank you.  I do not care for left overs (Grin).

Seriously though I did learn a lot about current astrological tech. I did
not know.  It was worth the effort for that alone.  Now that I have the
background theory I makes sence.  I still am curious about the integration
time require for 3 ls detection of a scout ship.

Or you have a very vunerable very important \'super heat sink\' sticking out
the back of your ship at 20000k/m^2

Or fussion power plant would better than we think.

Or maybe it\'s cold fussion.

I do not have an answer.  But that high temp. heat vane worries me.  It\'s to
good a target.

Ok, sounds good, but what is your exhaust?  Very hot H2?

No targeting laser to give the attack away.  That\'s what balistic targeting

If the attacker speed is high (.5c) then 3 seconds is about all the warning
you get from c speed sensors.  Range is not that important, it rate of
closure that count.  If you close in three second for the detection point 3
second is all they get but this is a mute point anyway.  The sensor
discussion killed this type of pirate anyway.

True but what about mercinary companies?  Where do pirates start any way?

But that is mute.  The sensor discussion did it for me.  A system with a
good sensor array and a few well stationed SDBs out at about 50 dias. would
be pirate proof to all but a AHL class pirate making a full scale attack and
short of a really improbable mutiny that is not going to happen.

You win.  Pirate don\'t work in defended systems.

	I guess I\'ll rise to the bait on this one as well:  A Fed CA/CC is one of the
few starships in SFB to be able to withstand a full alpha strike on the #1
shield (no shield reinforcement assumed) by another CA/CC/DN and STILL be
combat-capable.  This ability is also shared by some Hydran vessels (the Cen
Hull hits for the Hydrans and the Labs for the Feds, acting as the "7th
shield").

	I have proved this (usually to everyones amazement) many many times; as for
credentials, I have been playing SFB since before the supplements came out
(the little books that is), as well as being a member of Battle Group Phoenix
(TFG playtest group for SFB) for 2 years and becoming a Rated Ace in 1994.

 If you want to nitpik everything to death then you\'ll need too start
footnoting everything you say as well.  I still have not gotten threshold
sensor numbers for these sensors yet.  No one has explained how a 100ton
scout can radiate 10MWs of heat per second as some say it does.  If you want
do carry on this discussion under the debating rules I can do that.  We will
both have to start by proving our primices.  Can you prove a 100MW power
plant has 10MWs of waste heat and a 100ton scout can radiate it without
killing the crew?

	Perhaps the best way to begin is for you to establish YOUR
credentials/qualifications.  You have made some references to your expertise,
but I have seen nothing to back those references up.  As for the debate, may I
respectfully suggest that you consider taking the question t the Trav-Tech
list and solicit thier opinions?  They are a fairly authoritative source of
info (and they will back thier arguments up w/ numbers and proofs...something
I have not noticed in your posts).  The subscription address is

Well, IMO, a transponder is never going to be able to "prove" who you are
and I thought saying they existed for that reason didn\'t work.

If they exist, I think they would be mostly to aid navigation (ships are easier
to track and you don\'t have to take time to call them up to find out who they
are).   It does have some benefit to security because it complicates some
situations because ships have to commit to sneaking up (since once they
are detected they have to explain why their transponders were off which
they may or may not be able to do).

That is why I think they exist.

As tough as it would be to do, I\'d vote for 1.

No, I don\'t think we could get the power requirements down to
*realistic* levels, but we could (and should) lower them to more
reasonable ones. As for weapons, of course, they are going to be
*very* power hungry, and that shouldn\'t change. Ships with beam
weapons are going to need big fusion engines. OTOH, we don\'t have run
those big fusion engines at full power 24 hours a day do we? Well, it
*seems* like we always have, but I\'ve never thought that was very
reasonable.

As a mind experiment, let\'s say a 100 dton Type S Scout has an 80MW
fusion engine that it can throttle back to 5% of maximum output, so it
will always be producing 4MW while it\'s running. 

When it is drifting through space with minimal life support, using
passive sensors and maintaining only a trickle charge to the drives or
weapons, let\'s say, it *requires* only 2 MW\'s. So maybe it turns off
the fusion engine and runs off of stored power (fuel cells, batteries,
powercells, etc) only occasionally powering the engine back up to
recharge the batteries, or, if your TU won\'t allow for turning fusion
engines on and off like gasoline engines (I wouldn\'t allow *quite*
that much leeway ;), runs the fusion engine at it\'s lowest possible
level (4MW) it can. Combined with a little stealthing shouldn\'t that
drop the range of detection *way* down?

Now, if our Scout uses it\'s drives, active sensors, or *heaven forbid*
it\'s weapons, it will increase it\'s power consumption, and have to
stoke the fusion engine up to higher levels. Suddenly, it\'s a "hotter"
object visible on sensors at a longer range, but not necessarily from
every direction. 

If the power is going mainly to the drives, and the drives dispose of
*most* of the extra energy in one direction..aft, then our Scout\'s
detection level might not go up much in any direction except from the
rear. 

IMO, active sensors should be like spotlights, in that where ever the
ship aims them it can resolve a target much better, but is also much
easier to detect. 

Beam weapons are a different case. I suspect they will never be all
that efficient, so a lot of the power they consume will have to be
dealt with separately. Putting special high-temp radiators on their
turrets, in their bays, and around their spinal mounts is probably the
best way to handle them, too.  In any case, a ship using beam weapons
should light up like a Christmas Tree, but that doesn\'t bother me in
the least. Once the firing starts all bets are off anyway.

Actually, I think he\'s referring to the growing anti-immigration (legal
and otherwise) sentiment, which is most often aimed at Latinos as the
most obvious, and most mentioned in the press. This is in contrast to
the _true_ situation...in NYC one of the largest groups of illegal
aliens are Irish. More to the point, it is disproportionately latinos
who are stopped and interrogated as to their citizenship status...I have
known people who were told they should carry their birth certificates
with them so they don\'t get deported. Deported to where I don\'t know,
since they were born here, like their parents were...

ObTrav: This is actually a great example of xenophobia rating in
action:"They look different, they talk funny, they must be ________
(fib)"

Consider it a cultural extension . . .

;)

Seriously, no, it\'s not Traveller. However, it could be.  How do GM\'s deal
with prejudice (economically induced or otherwise) in their games?  Say a
player wants to be a vargr in the time period directly after the 5th
Frontier War (or for any period, for that matter).  Do you have NPC\'s
actively harrass him/her?  Or do you use "minority" races/cultures in plots
to get your PC\'s riled up over injustice?

I ran a game in the Glisten subsector after the 5th Frontier war.  One of
the players was a baron, who had a maid who was a Sword-Worlder emigre.  The
players, most of whom were, at the time, unfamiliar with the Traveller
universe, thought she was just a bit of color with a funny accent, until
they saw how various NPC\'s reacted to her.  She became quite the divisive
issue, as the Baron and several others defended her honor, while a few
players began to wonder . . .

While the Traveller universe is wonderful for "boldly going," military
campaigns, and economic adventures, there\'s also LOTS of room for social
issues to create adventures.

No, the Aslan lesbians arose out of discussions of Aslan society and the
consequences of the high Female:male ratio of the race, the details of

it was such a good addition to the tagline that it\'s sort of stuck...

Gurps is pretty much the same.  With a good gunners and tageting software
it\'s 1 laser one dead missle per turn.  The only way to get misile hits is a
large salvo that closes fast enough to overwhelm the defenses.  It is doable
but not very cost effective.  Those misiles are pricy.

Sorry have to make some corrections.   I missed some things in sidebars ect.

I have my book with me so I looked it up.  I was just reading the space
combat section when this came up.

Do to turn limits in the combat situation you have to shoot a ship or a
missle but not both with each laser.  A scout with one triple laser turret
fired on by 9 missles from 2 seconds out will be hit by three missles if the
gunners involved do not miss.

1st second shoot three misiles: gunner skill 15 (above average professional)
+ 15 accuacy (limited to gunner shill) +4 aiming +10 computer (very good
comp.) +2 active sensor +4 rof =50 - 41 for range 1 = 9  You must role less
the 9 on three d6 but 17 and 18 always fail.

I assume here that you hit.

2nd second shoot three missles and get hit by the other three. range 0 role
to hit = 21  (including a +10 for point defense bonus and shorter range)

3 missles hit if misile gunner roles his success number for colition damage
plus explosion

missile cost 22kcr each.

Yep, caught that and corrected it and reposted.  (sigh, why didn\'t I catch
that the firsth time.)  Missed the pd completely though.

Damn!, missed that you can ingage different targets several times with the
same weapon.

I want a ROF 30 Gattling laser cannon for point defense.  No range to speek
of but +15 ROF fire bonus to swat misiles...lot\'s of missles.  Also good for
crowd control on planet. (Evil Grin)

not according to the table on page 173 1/2d = 10 or 13.  Max is much more.
Love that acc works out to max range.

Note: there is a miss print on the last page.  Hexes are 2000miles not 10,000.

This makes a ship with a high vector very dangerious.  His misiles move fast
and hit hard!

Misiles are nasty again in GT.

Note:  1 small nuke = radioactive gas cloud where ship use to be on a direct
hit.

I think your SDB may need some more armor.

I don\'t have my vehicle book with me.  Do you loose DR from an attack?  Only
on 6s?  How does this work?

Humm...Some extra E_banks in case you loose the reacter would be a good
design idea.  Plus a spare reacter of course.

Good point.  Misiles have gotten REAL nasty!  and the SDB need a lot more armor.

I hope to have a group up and running in a few weeks (first time I\'ll be
home) to test out some of this.

I read (I forget where) a theory that naval military technology since the
end of the classic period has been driven by the quest to find a decisive
ship sinking weapon like the ram was in the heyday of the trireme. The
argument is that until the invention of workable explosive shells ships
didn\'t get sunk (to all intents and purposes) in combat, instead after
hours of bettering they became incapable of resisting boarding parties.
Note that aside from subs and aircraft WWI and WWII BBs were in a similar
situation, though they did tend to sink in the end. Given that this state
of affiars lasted for over 1500 years, I can see no reason why it shouldn\'t
be able to exist in the far future.

IMO one problem Traveller ship combat has is that people want the feeling
that you get having mighty ship pounding away at each other like a WWI
slugfest, but they also want the quick thrill of the cat and mouse game of
fire and maneuver and these are two fairly incompatible desires.

IIRC MT fusion plants use about 0.05 kl/hr/MW, maybe divided by 3 because
of efficiency for 0.01667 kl/hr. FF&S1 fusion plants use about 0.1
kl/year/MW which is about 1500 times more efficient.

So what limit, if any, do you put on the distance from a gravity source
that a T-plate can be and still function? If it\'s 1000 or 2000 diameters a
misjump of more than a few hundred AU will kill a T-plate ship\'s crew far
more certainly than a HEPlaR\'s, especially as the HEPlaR fuel supply may be
enough to allow a jump.

  A common theory is that mercenary companies with the correct licences
could use higher-end gear - not unreasonably given the Imperial tendency
to use them as low political cost proxies within the 3I itself.

  As for pirates, to a large extent it\'s relative armament that counts -
a knife is enough when your target has only a sweaty brow...

/.../ Pirate don\'t work in defended systems.

  Actually, I suspect that it would be very hard to build a system with
anything like near-universal fast response defenses, unless it had very
few traffic nexi to protect, or very large resources. So, while a Pop 7
mainworld may be effectively inviolable the outer system defenses amy be
quite porous - which would make a good case for not using starships for
certain commercial missions.

  Likewise, a Jump from the (safe) mainworld to a large and well-protected
facility not within a 100-D effect would be quite safe.

I think that you misunderstood what he was saying.  Reservists by nature are
NOT out in the space lanes in their ships.  An example of Reserve activity
would be that they meet one weekend a month and go active for two weeks in
the summer.  This would then cause one to believe that the ships of the
Reserve Fleet are ALMOST moth-balled and would take some time to bring
on-line.  Reservists routinely take they active duty period fixing up there
"vehicles" and training to maintain their standards for going to war.  You
would see the occasional Reserve Ship out and about just so they can blow
the cob webs out.  Think for a minute, if you are only on active duty for
two weeks and a jump takes one week then you would only be able to take your
ship out and right back and be done for the year.

As Charles has pointed out, the Reserve Fleet is just that HELD IN RESERVE.
Reservists (by today\'s standards and I can\'t see why it would change at all)
spend two weeks on active duty a year.  They meet one weekend a month.
Reservists would probably augment the IN and the sub-sector navy when on
active duty for their two weeks.  They might possibly work on their ships to
help keep them up and ready for deployment.  Either way you look at it the
Reserve Forces are not there in ANY numbers that would be of any help to the
pirate interdiction role.

  This may not be that much of a problem for HG/Striker: 1 HG EP is 252MW
from Striker (@TL F, 14m^3 of fuser gets 6mw/cube x3 for volume efficiency
for 18 ea., or 252 total). Later you start to realize that energy weapons
are assumed to be firing continuously throughout every second of a combat
turn (and presumably so with spacecraft?) even though beam lasers only have
+2 to hit over a low ROF large bore CPR gun (and +1 of that should be long-
range accuracy over ballistic rounds).

  Thus, you could probably reduce fusion plant output by 75% and reduce
energy weapon ROF by a similar degree without too much difficulty. This
also makes batteries that much more practical for use in HG.

I had a dicsussion this summer with a TML\'er where we sort of agreed that:
  - we could deal with transmissions activating other SDG transponders.
  - it was internally consistent for "Virus" to spread itself physically
by etching additional circuitry to reach another system (see A:13 /GK).
  - it made no sense whatever for Virus to spread via fiber-optic lines
or broadcast transmissions to non-SDG components.
  : therefore, if common Imperial comp tech used linkages through which
Virus could physically spread, then that should have been stated.

  IIRC, neither of used Virus (or played TNE).

I dont think so, you\'re underestimating the quality of your own work :*>.

One of the things that struck me when I first saw your minor race generation 
tables was the utter logical nature of them. Your tables are pretty much self 
explanatory. The only thing I can\'t figure out is what are "components". Its not 
immediately obvious and I can\'t find it explained in the text anywhere. The other 
thing that could cause confusion is the Caste "Sport". Its not defined in the text 
and to a neophile I\'d imagine it would conjure up images of professional 
atheletes ("hey now theres a race that has a distinct biological gender devoted 
to sports"). but other than that the Minor Race Generation tables are fairly 
much self explanatory.

I didn\'t get them either, so if it\'s not the fonts, then there\'s two

Michael, could you include the scale for the deckplans.  Are the

Personally, where I live, I have noticed a slowly *improving*
attitude toward all minorities during the last 30 years.  I
certainly haven\'t seen strong anti-latino feelings since the
mid-80\'s.

Well now, maybe you mean the fact that many Americans don\'t like the
idea of aliens flooding across our borders?  If that\'s it, the
disquiet isn\'t specifically anti-latino, it\'s more anti-immigration,
especially illegal immigration, it just so happens that the mass of
the illegal immigrates come from Central American countries.  I
think this is more an economic issue than anything, but like most
things you can make it a racial one if you try.  

Xenophobia is something else.  It\'s an *unreasonable* fear of
outsiders.

Heck, if the base is on/in a really big ice chunk all the ship has
to do is fire a harpoon attached to a line into the iceball and
either the base or the ship can reel the two together.  No muss, no
fuss, low energy approach.

IMTU, of course, that base has to be near a brown dwarf or gas
giant.

Sure, but if you\'re shooting is any good your target is going to
know ding-dang well where you\'re at, so I don\'t see the reason for
hiding from your target once you start shooting.  ;-> Ok, I really
do, and having radiators scattered around the hull is a good idea.

No question about that.

My approach is to use a different technology for in-system maneuver,
but that only works for heretics like me ;-> For people that use
HEPlaR, or for that matter TPlates, a maneuvering ship is going to
be *very* detectable from at least one direction.  All I can suggest
is to postulate very good baffling to limit the area of exhaust
plume exposure.

That and being able to bank the fusion engine back to single digit
power levels when you aren\'t maneuvering or using weapons.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

I\'ve been experimenting on and off with rewriting gurps sensors in a way which
made more sense than what\'s in the standard rules; I\'m not very sure of all my
numbers, but I decided to post this so comments can be made -- so please, make
comments ;).  Much of the issue here was some straightforward reality checks --
I wanted to make it so you can see nearby stars, while spotting a person from a
mile away is pretty difficult even if you know where to look.
- --0-2078917053-909187425=:31899
Content-Type: TEXT/plain; CHARSET=US-ASCII
Content-Description: sensor.rules.gurps

I can\'t make too many promises about the accuracy of these tables, they 
are largely an attempt to generate sane results from the game system,
particularly in making sure that nearby stars aren\'t invisible, while a
person a mile away is hard to see.  Ranges are based on the standard range
tables, but extended to ranges which might be interesting in space.

1)  Converting Sensor Stats for these rules:
    If scan is 0-20, do not adjust.
    If scan is 20-36, halve and add 10 (round normally).
    If scan is 37+, divide by 3 and add 16 (round normally).
    Note that these are atmospheric scan values -- GT lists space scan
    values, which are 6 higher.  Subtract the +6 for space before converting.
    For reference, eyes have scan 10.  The relevant GT sensors are:
    Cockpit/10: passive (29/2+10)=25, active(33/2+10)=27, radscan(29/2+10)=25
    Cockpit/12: passive (31/2+10)=26, active(34/2+10)=27, radscan(31/2+10)=26
    Basic/10: passive (32/2+10)=26, active(35/2+10)=28, radscan(31/2+10)=26
    Basic/12: passive (32/2+10)=26, active(36/2+10)=28, radscan(35/2+10)=28
    Command/10: passive (33/2+10)=27, active(36/2+10)=28, radscan(32/2+10)=26
    Command/12: passive (35/2+10)=28, active(37/3+16)=28, radscan(38/3+16)=29

2)  Determining \'signature\'
*   Visual signature is equal to size modifier, plus chameleon surface.  In
    space, the black paint used in stealth coatings acts as a chameleon 
    surface -- subtract (TL-4) for basic, (TL-2) for radical.  Basic black
    paint reduces signature by 3.  A reflective or white surface adds 2.
*   Radar signature uses the normal computations and _halves_ them -- thus,
    base value is (size/2), subtract (TL-4)/2 for basic, (TL-4) for radical.
    For convenience, assume Lidar uses the Radar signature.  Note that a
    ship currently _using_ active sensors has a signature of (scan-TL) 
    and can be detected by a radscanner.
*   IR signature uses either the size modifier of the vehicle, _or_ a 
    function of power consumption and expected waste heat; this number is
    usually significantly greater (and is, in fact, probably higher than
    the numbers I use).  In any case, emissions cloaking reduces this,
    by (TL-4)/2 for basic, (TL-4) for radical.  The major power users on
    a ship are as follows:
    Artificial Gravity: 1 MW per 50 spaces or fraction thereof.
    Jump Drive: 10 MW per unit of J-drive.  Not usually very relevant, but
        important if a ship exits jump and then goes cold.
    Manuever Drive: 1 MW per 10 tons thrust.
    Weapons Fire: 16 MW for TL 10 laser, 18 for TL 12; 400 MW for bay
        PAW/meson, 19000 for spinal PAW/meson.
    Add up power consumption: signature is +8 for 1 MW, +9 for 2 MW, +10
        for 5 MW, and +3 per *10.  In situations where a ship\'s signature
        _changes_, IR signature will drop by 1 per 10 minutes (2/turn); it
        will rise essentially immediately (<1 turn).  Add +1 to IR signature
        per TL below 10 -- lower tech engines are less efficient (these
        numbers assume about 10% heat emissions).  A human has a base 
        emitted signature of +0.
    Example: a TL 10 merchant (size +8) has around 600 tons thrust (60 MW)
        and 4 MW for artificial gravity.  Signature is +13; drops to +9 if
        not using thrust, +8 if all major power shut off.
    Example 2: a TL 10 400tn raider (size +9) has 6000 tons thrust (600 MW)
        and 8 MW for artificial gravity, but radical EM cloaking.  Signature
        is +10 with drive active, +4 with artificial gravity online,
        +3 with all major power shut off.
*   Natural Objects: generally speaking, the size modifier of a natural
    object should be the negative of a range modifier equal to its diameter,
    +2 (natural objects are generally spherical).   Normal modifiers apply;
    signature will usually be within a point of the size modifier.
    A star has a visual signature of 76-1.2*absolute magnitude (70 for
    sol).

3)  Signature of \'Events\':
    Certain short-term events are reasonably likely to be spotted, most 
    notably weapons fire and jumping.
    An energy weapon firing has a signature based on its power output --
    use 10* its normal power requirement and compute based on that.
    Specifically, this works out to +12 for lasers, +16 for bay weapons,
    +21 for spinal weapons.
    Nuclear weapons have a signature of +14 for 0.001 kT, and +3 per *10.
    A starship jumping insystem has a signature of 17 + 3log10(# of J);
    this works out to 5+(size*1.5), +1 for J-3 or higher, and lasts
    for a minute (giving +2 detection).

4)  Detection Process:
    If this is initial detection, simply add up range, signature, and all
    relevant modifiers; if the total is less than zero double the result.
    Use this as a modifier for a sensor operations roll.

    If this is _not_ initial detection, use the above process, but you can
    usually assume that the bonus for field of view will be +5.

    Special case: resolving the shape of an object is very different from
    detection, at least in space -- it is, in fact, sufficiently different
    to warrant a completely different detection process.  For resolving the
    shape, apply _only_ the following modifiers:
        Time (maximum +2), Focus (maximum +2), Target Size, Range,
        Intervening Atmosphere, -2 if using thermal sensors or lidar, -6
        if using imaging radar.

    Special case: objects which are quite near each other.  Treat as per
    resolving the shape of an object, but use the size modifier for the
    distance between the objects.

    What you roll will determine what information you get:
    Success by 0-2: detection.
        For optical sensors, gives direction and relative brightness.
        For radar sensors, gives range and apparent signature.
        For thermal sensors, gives direction and relative brightness.
        For shape resolution, gives size and general shape.
    Success by 3-5: recognition
        For optical sensors, as above plus exact color.
        For radar sensors, as above plus exact velocity.
        For thermal sensors, as above plus temperature.
        For shape resolution, gives sufficient information to identify a
            class of vehicle or entity.  Battle damage will be visible, etc.
    Success by 6+: identification
        For optical/thermal sensors, spectral analysis may be performed, and
            a time-based brightness curve generated.  For objects which have
            known spectral lines, velocity to/away (to within 1 km/sec)
            may be determined.
        For radar sensors, a time-based brightness profile may be generated,
            allowing determinations about rotation and some sorts of shape
            computation.
        for shape resolution, gives sufficient information to identify a
            particular vehicle or person.

Initial Detection Roll:
    Add up all modifiers; if < 0, _double_ (this is a hack -- an expert
    operator (skill 18) shouldn\'t have 10x the detection range of a moderate
    skill (skill 12) operator.  This reduces it to about 3x, but the expert
    will be much more reliable).  Roll electronics/sensor operation at this
    modifier.

        For even the lowest-grade space sensors this means that an 
        object moving at orbital velocity around a planet an AU away
        appears to be moving, so this modifier usually applies to detecting
        ships.

    (2) modifier applies to signature based on size, but not signature
        based on power consumption; max -6 if object is warm enough for
        humans to survive.
    
Simplifications for space combat:
    In general, for space combat purposes, you will have a +12 for IR/radar
    in space, a +4 for turn length, a -2 for 360 scan, and a +2 for a
    moving object (negating this is quite hard, though not impossible), for
    a total of +16 to scan; this gives a TL 10 basic bridge a 42 passive, a
    TL 12 command bridge a 44.  This allows a ship which is mostly powered
    down to evade detection at reasonable ranges, but is significantly 
    better range than what GT normally gives.

Example:
    For a human to spot alpha centaurus (signature +71, range -97), at night:
    +10 scan, +71 signature, -97 range, +14 terrain, -1 atmosphere, total 
    -3, doubled to -6.  Probably not going to spot it randomly.  However,
    scan a 30 degree arc (+2) and spend 15 seconds (+1) and you\'ve got 
    a pretty good chance.

Example 2: for a merchant (scan 26 passive, net 42) to detect a pirate
    with no drives, but running artificial gravity (signature +4) at half
    the jump limit (2 light-seconds, range -51): total -5, doubled to -10,
    virtually zero chance.  The pirate, meanwhile, has a TL 10 command 
    bridge with scan 27, net 43, target signature +13, net +5 -- no problem.
    If the pirate kicks in his drives signature jumps to +10, for a +1 to
    scan -- depends on the alertness of the operator.

I\'m sorry. Recent evidence shows that the Royal Oak was scuttled by her

Me for one. My employer (Unilever) wouldn\'t take nicely to the volume of
traffic on this list, so I connect from home.

I know Nick Munn (those TML fogey\'s around will know the name) doesn\'t
connect as he works from the UK civil service and they tend to get a little
jumpy about usage, and topics like nukes, sensors, encryption etc. Shame -
I miss some of his comments.

You mean to support the T4 IG canon that the authors never get paid ;-)

Not funny when you talk to people like Andy Lilly et al. who did a lot of
work getting material out for IG with tight deadlines. And never got paid.

I posted something a fair while ago (12 months) that was a query in from
one of my games about how Aslan would consider casual sexual relationships.
It all happened at Dinomn when the Empress Nicholle got into port, and the
female Aslan engineer was bored with all the humans and disappeared... the
thread kind of degenerated after a few interesting posts (Wildstar\'s being
one of the most memorable).

http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/Kira.html

relates a little of the tale from another player\'s perspective.

MT does not have a limit on T-plate efficiency; My campiagns do not either.
I will not retrofit the T-Plate efficiency onto MT as I run it. IMO, it
defeats too much previous cannon (including TCS, to some degree), is ill
thought, and makes no sense. IMTU, True Recationless Thrusters push against
themost significant gravity wells, and thus the objects creating them, and
thus truly are not reactionless, but use the mass of planets, stars, dark
matter, interstellar gasses, etc., as reaction mass. Just like IMTU, a
repulsor CAN be used for fine maneuving in docks.

Since I don\'t run TNE anymore (the combat system is BROKEN, and I\'ve tried
dozens of fixes, and just don\'t like any of them), and don\'t  like T4
except for the Psionics rules and number of skills per term, my players
don\'t expect me to use "questionable" items from the newer canon. If I were
running T4, I\'d use the limits, and if T5 has the limits, when running T5
I\'ll use the limits.

TL 9 anti-grav-thrusters are limited to about 1000 diameters, and no full
thrust after 100 diameters, and I limit gravitic modules (vehicular type)
to 10 diameters for full thrust, and no thrust past 100 diameters.

This assumes the term reserves is used in the same context it is for the
United States: part time military personell.

I don\'t see this in the Imperium (it is canon for the solomani confed
tho... AM 6 IIRC). Rather the reserve fleets are used in the WWII european
sense: units not intended for first line combat assignments, but able
enough to respond as backups and reliefs to front-liners. Colonials woould
fill the same role for the reserve units.

Unfortunately, this is very common in the industry. I had to wait almost

Note that if you increase the number of lasers and missile proportionally
the lasers pull ahead (since each laser can engage each missile, albeit
at the increasing minuses...) If you manage the sequences right, X 
laser turrets will pretty much always stop 2*X missiles...

Is this really the way triple turrets work? This needs to be clarified.
I assumed that if a single gunner fires all three lasers in a triple
turret he/she made a to-hit roll independently, with no modifiers, for
each. Otherwise (as you note) triple turrets are near-useless.

Cold fusion is actually worse for percentage of waste energy than hot
fusion (basic thermodynamics.) 

To go with higher power plant efficiency (and the TL13-15
power plants in FFS2 are already up at about 99%), 
you also have to assume that all devices on the ship are very efficient-
that none of the power that goes into your maneuver drive, for example,
comes out as heat. (Since maneuver drives already create energy, maybe
this isn\'t a bad assumption.) You need superconducting cables everywhere,
etc...

One certainly can assume that the power plant radiators run at lower 
levels most of the time - non-combat, or landing, for example. One 
could also assume that they include air-cooling modes for operating in
an atmosphere (so you don\'t bake everyone below you...just blow very 
hot air above you.) (Another reason for ships to still use the 
"blast pits" seen on old starport maps...) 

Another way to get rid of excess heat would be to vent very very very
hot plasma (accounting for CT-style fuel consumption for power plants),
but that makes you incredibly easy to detect, since you can\'t 
baffle the plasma.

I think (in my Copious Spare Time) I may work on the "Conservative
Sensor Rules" - a rules set that assumes (somehow) lower total heat
production, and that sensor technology develops more slowly...

Ditto. After the second time my royalty check from ICE bounced I got a
little miffed. I did finally get them to cough up the money they owed me

#2 : These defenses will make piracy in and around mainworlds unprofitable.

#3 : These defenses do not extend to the entire system.

#4 : Most career pirates concentrate on the unsafe outsystems.

#5 : Shippers apply risk premiums to trade with either unsafe systems or
outsystems.

#6 : Merchant ships specialising in trading in unsafe areas tend to be
heavily armed

#7 : Merchant ships specialising in trading in safe areas tend to be
lightly armed or unarmed

#8 : The best markets for stolen starships and cargos are in other states,
however unsafe areas will buy commodities they know to be stolen at heavily
discounted rates

#9 : Pirate ships will tend to be converted merchants, as unsafe areas tend
not to be profitable enough to justify custom-built warships. Safe areas
tend to be too dangerous for even custom built warships to operate in for
long enough to defray their build costs. Pirate warships may exist from
mutinous or rebel crews.

A corrollory of #4 and #5 is that Outsystems will tend to remain
underdeveloped, as they cannot develop until they are secure, and they are
not worth securing until they are developed.

Now, are all the principals of the GPD happy with this so we can put this

I based my statement on US Reservists, i.e. 1 weekend a month and 2
weeks a year.
at this rate the ships would not be able to leave orbit and get the
crews back to thier regular jobs in time.  If the reserves work
differently IYTU then I made a bad assumption.

there are a few backwater worlds where coups and counter-coups may result
in divided crews. The captain supports the new regime, his first officer
is a loyalist, and so on -- an attempt at peacefully sequestering the
other side fails, and fighting rages through the ship -- and maybe even
several ships in a particular squadron. This would make a good scenario,
actually.

It could also justify an interesting kind of pirate: some of the ships on
the losing side (if they have jump drive) might decline to surrender or
fight to the finish, and instead depart for a life of crime to support
themselves in the hopes of an eventual return. Remember, it ain\'t just
Vargr who have coups...

Ok, I\'ve revised the fonts and attempted to imbed them. I\'ve also added the

Any way, please try the files again and let me know it they work all right.
I tried them on my lap top and they showed up alright on it so I hope
they\'ll be ok.

Thing is, HG lets you do odd-sized hulls.  A size code 9 ship is anything from 
900 to 999 tons.  Just watch your decimal points.

That, too.

BTW, you didn\'t answer my question.  <grin>

I have to disagree, 
I think there have been some interesting arguments this time around.
Although the Piracy theme will never be resolved, the discussion
is interesting nonetheless!

You\'re using some other stuff rather than straight HG.  Under HG, your hull 
costs the same whether it\'s mild steel or ferrocement or superdense.  Cost of 
materials is factored into it already.  If you\'re gonna evaluate a HG design, 
set your FS&S on the coffee table and take stuff right from HG.  I see the 
figures for armour bulk as reasonable for HG as it factors in \'inferior\' 
materials at lower tech levels.  The lower your tech, the more bulk you need 
to get the same armour protection on your hull and the more bracing you need 
because your \'state of the art\' is still under developement.

This table basically assumes times from ready on boards to loaded in cargo
or vice versa; times really should be doubled for moving ship to ship.
Times should be doubled for medium break-bulk (loose boxes and crates
instead of containerized or shrinkwrapped onto pallets) and times 10 for
small items (125L boxes {25cm cubes}).

* in vaccum assumes LD Vacc suit or tailored vaccsuit.
** assume SG 4 (4MT per 1Td) as a good average if you don\'t want to figure
out masses from traveller cargos yourself.
*** assumes pallatized loads that are secure on the pallet. Iv\'e moved up
to a 1/2 ton pallet of icecream at the rates shown, moving the goods from
loose to a pallet 2m from the shelves, while in a -10c freezer. Moving the
pallet the 10-15 meters to shrink-wrap took another 2 minutes on average,
including opening and closing the 1/4-ton sliding door. Shrink wrap took
another 5 minutes, and then it was a fairly stable unit. The guys who
worked the wharehouse (I worked the co-located icecream plant) could load
and move faster than I could. BTW, a 1/2ton pallet of ice cream is about 2m
tall, and uses a 1.5x1.5m pallet which is about 7-12 cm tall it\'s self,
weighing about 10kg. Lined up pallets go on trucks at the loading-dock at
the rate of about 1-2 per minute, depending on skill and depth of refer
van, at least that\'s what I\'ve seen done. A full van can be unloaded to the
dock (which is level with the floor of the reefer van floor) in under 15
minutes for a fully palletized load in a 40\' trailer. And about as long to
get the load into the freezer, using about 5 men for each task.

It has big radiators in the cargo bay that flip out as soon as it hits
orbit.  It also uses as little power as possible... the crew generate more
heat than the electrics.  They also use a lot of low-resistance wiring
(read: fiber-optics and pure copper) to minimise heat buildup from that
source.

Something else to consider is that there are presently computerised sonar
analysis programs... I was thinking more along the lines of a database of
registered starships, and their jump signatures.  Of course, this adds a
lot to the xboat traffic, but there you go...

Michael, they look good and printed out just fine.  It seemed like the size of the Twain.pdf file went way up, I might be wrong as I was downloading it through a dialup this time rather than a faster network connection.

I like this... it explains why systems where every planet is developed out
the wazoo.

Now the question is, how does a new colony get started at all?

There was some increase to about 652kb, from imbedding the fonts I believe,
still a reasonable size compared to the ~1.5 meg in the original Corel file
and much higher in JPEG formats. I\'d really like to suggest .PDF as a
standard, if the Acrobat package wasn\'t so expensive. I\'m a bit luck to have
it available on my work network, so I can dial it up and use it.

Yes, *in that particular essay.*  In the header, first paragraph... "At their

IMO, none of those are credible for disecting the economics of the Third
Imperium (or any polity of the OTU).  It\'s obvious GDW didn\'t use Striker or
TCS (or anything even remotely resembling Pocket Empires) in creating the
background.  All of them are made to be playable *games* (specificially games
for players to have pet "pocket empires" and polities and go to war w/ each
other) and to not simulate "reality" (such as it is) for the OTU.

By Sunbeard, I meant career pirate. "Sunbeard, Scourge of Seven Sectors.
Har!" Career meaning like 5+ term pirate.  I find it more than plausible the
odd merchant can\'t keep up w/ his payments, etc and decides to start preying
on his competitors, (or gets shanghaied), etc. Eventually he either gets
caught, "retires", or gets dead, though, even on the fringe.  And it\'s more
than possible that megacorporate raiders as well as the possible forces of the
brigandish member-world (soon to be visited by the IN), though the megacorp
raiders are likely to have an "out" in their contract.  To say nothing of the
foreign (Zho, Solomani, etc) raiders who are better described as privateer.

about jump drives, a significant number of jumps from inhabited worlds _cannot_

Any world in the life-zone for a K or M star will probably be within the 100D
limit for the _star_.  A world in the inner part of the life zone for a G star
will also be within 100D.

Even if you aren\'t within 100D of the star, you need to _miss_ that 100D sphere
around the star (at both ends).  If the planet\'s orbital plane is not
particularly inclined relative to the jump direction, for a significant
fraction of the year (depending on exact angle and size of star) you\'ll have
the star in the way -- for earth, jumping to somewhere on the ecliptic would
require travelling a good part of an AU for about 5 months of the year.

For our worst examples, the spinward marches include a number of M II giants...
the concept of having to travel 5-10 AU to jump would be rather unappealing to
most merchants ;).

Well, IMO, a transponder is never going to be able to "prove" who you are
and I thought saying they existed for that reason didn\'t work.

If they exist, I think they would be mostly to aid navigation (ships are easier
to track and you don\'t have to take time to call them up to find out who they
are).   It does have some benefit to security because it complicates some
situations because ships have to commit to sneaking up (since once they
are detected they have to explain why their transponders were off which
they may or may not be able to do).

That is why I think they exist.

MT does not have a limit on T-plate efficiency; My campiagns do not either.
I will not retrofit the T-Plate efficiency onto MT as I run it. IMO, it
defeats too much previous cannon (including TCS, to some degree), is ill
thought, and makes no sense. IMTU, True Recationless Thrusters push against
themost significant gravity wells, and thus the objects creating them, and
thus truly are not reactionless, but use the mass of planets, stars, dark
matter, interstellar gasses, etc., as reaction mass. Just like IMTU, a
repulsor CAN be used for fine maneuving in docks.

Since I don\'t run TNE anymore (the combat system is BROKEN, and I\'ve tried
dozens of fixes, and just don\'t like any of them), and don\'t  like T4
except for the Psionics rules and number of skills per term, my players
don\'t expect me to use "questionable" items from the newer canon. If I were
running T4, I\'d use the limits, and if T5 has the limits, when running T5
I\'ll use the limits.

TL 9 anti-grav-thrusters are limited to about 1000 diameters, and no full
thrust after 100 diameters, and I limit gravitic modules (vehicular type)
to 10 diameters for full thrust, and no thrust past 100 diameters.

This assumes the term reserves is used in the same context it is for the
United States: part time military personell.

I don\'t see this in the Imperium (it is canon for the solomani confed
tho... AM 6 IIRC). Rather the reserve fleets are used in the WWII european
sense: units not intended for first line combat assignments, but able
enough to respond as backups and reliefs to front-liners. Colonials woould
fill the same role for the reserve units.

There was some increase to about 652kb, from imbedding the fonts I believe,
still a reasonable size compared to the ~1.5 meg in the original Corel file
and much higher in JPEG formats. I\'d really like to suggest .PDF as a
standard, if the Acrobat package wasn\'t so expensive. I\'m a bit luck to have
it available on my work network, so I can dial it up and use it.

The deck plans look great, but theexploded view at the back just has funny

If you _did_ include the fonts, then I guess I need some help with Acrobat

You mean to support the T4 IG canon that the authors never get paid ;-)

Not funny when you talk to people like Andy Lilly et al. who did a lot of
work getting material out for IG with tight deadlines. And never got paid.

I\'m sorry. Recent evidence shows that the Royal Oak was scuttled by her
crew to prevent the German U-Boat crew boarding her, stealing her and
obtaining valuable information... ;-)

That\'s incorrect.  A single gunner controls a single _turret_.  If he wanted to
fire the three weapons separately (rather than as a battery) he\'d be at -4 to
all of them.  He gets one shot, with a +1 for the # of weapons (this is a
problem, it means triple turrets are useless because you get the same bonus
from a double turret, but...)

Yes, *in that particular essay.*  In the header, first paragraph... "At their
lowest level, Imperial ships are organized into squadrons (from three to 10
similar ships)."

IMO, none of those are credible for disecting the economics of the Third
Imperium (or any polity of the OTU).  It\'s obvious GDW didn\'t use Striker or
TCS (or anything even remotely resembling Pocket Empires) in creating the
background.  All of them are made to be playable *games* (specificially games
for players to have pet "pocket empires" and polities and go to war w/ each
other) and to not simulate "reality" (such as it is) for the OTU.

By Sunbeard, I meant career pirate. "Sunbeard, Scourge of Seven Sectors.
Har!" Career meaning like 5+ term pirate.  I find it more than plausible the
odd merchant can\'t keep up w/ his payments, etc and decides to start preying
on his competitors, (or gets shanghaied), etc. Eventually he either gets
caught, "retires", or gets dead, though, even on the fringe.  And it\'s more
than possible that megacorporate raiders as well as the possible forces of the
brigandish member-world (soon to be visited by the IN), though the megacorp
raiders are likely to have an "out" in their contract.  To say nothing of the
foreign (Zho, Solomani, etc) raiders who are better described as privateer.

Perfect. Just what I was looking for. Many thanks.

So with one station, it takes about two weeks to scan the sky. A pirate
ship is detectable for about a day every rendezvous, which gives a 1/14
chance of being detected, about a 93% chance of being undetected. For two
rendezvous, the chance of remaining undetected is 93%^2 = 86%, and so on. 
If I\'ve done my math correctly, that means that after ten rendezvous there
is better than a 50% chance that the base has been detected. Hardly a
long-term proposition.

This also has implications for deep-penetration spy bases.

Design by George MacLure, text be me (Robert Prior), editing by DGP (Joe
or Gary, I think). Given the amount of editing and feedback, the coauthor
status is appropriate. Illustration was down after I wrote my text, and I
was happy enough with it.

The Sydkai was intended to operate for months without resupply. Optimized
is correct -- George optimized that ship down to the cubic metre. We had
noticed that the standard naval designs had short durations and required a
fair amount of logistical support, so we came up with a vessel optimized
for patrolling and sufficiently armed for fighting pirates.

Heck, if the base is on/in a really big ice chunk all the ship has
to do is fire a harpoon attached to a line into the iceball and
either the base or the ship can reel the two together.  No muss, no
fuss, low energy approach.

IMTU, of course, that base has to be near a brown dwarf or gas
giant.

Me for one. My employer (Unilever) wouldn\'t take nicely to the volume of
traffic on this list, so I connect from home.

I know Nick Munn (those TML fogey\'s around will know the name) doesn\'t
connect as he works from the UK civil service and they tend to get a little
jumpy about usage, and topics like nukes, sensors, encryption etc. Shame -
I miss some of his comments.

Including those ship owners who find themselves facing ship repossession
due to default on the ship mortgage, and crews who think that mutiny and
piracy would, **_in their case_** (the odds being, of course against
them) be more profitable than their current wages, not many.  But a few.

One or two, per sector, per _decade_, pulling off a sufficiently
profitable heist might serve to inspire enough morons to give piracy a
shot.  Most pirates would quickly perish, but one or two _might_ succeed
in a newsworthy heist.  Those who perish quickly still count as pirates
during their (deservedly) short career.

I don\'t think that piracy (as distinct from commerce raiding,
privateering, etc.) is worth the effort.  I merely point out that, given
the vast number of starships out there in private hands, some folks will
decide that they can beat the odds, and succeed in piracy.  Whether they
succeed or not doesn\'t keep them from trying.

Subject: re: Fighters

Oh goody - a KKM debate to go with the fighter debate and the piracy
debate and the transponder debate...
"if the bloody things get through", of course, is the hard part -
for reasonable laser technology
(let alone the really good lasers in GT or just-plain-T) hitting an
incoming kinetic impact missile is remarkably easy; certainly for the
space/price of a figher you can fit in a point defence laser that
can eat up many many times its weight in impact missiles (at least
in FFS2; but presumably also in GURPS - it\'ll be interesting to try
this once I get a copy of GURPS.)
*************8
in the practice combat we ran for our TCS campaign, a 200DT SDB was hit by
8 missiles. 4 of them got through the point defense.  the vector was
small(only 3 hexes) and she had heavy armor (IIRC DR4000) so she was only
crippled.

Unfortunately, this is very common in the industry. I had to wait almost
2 years before Hero Games paid me for the Champions material I had
written for them.

ps. I will note SJG does NOT follow industry trend, and pays on time.
Thus, you should see more GURPS:Traveller material coming out in their

  This may not be that much of a problem for HG/Striker: 1 HG EP is 252MW
from Striker (@TL F, 14m^3 of fuser gets 6mw/cube x3 for volume efficiency
for 18 ea., or 252 total). Later you start to realize that energy weapons
are assumed to be firing continuously throughout every second of a combat
turn (and presumably so with spacecraft?) even though beam lasers only have
+2 to hit over a low ROF large bore CPR gun (and +1 of that should be long-
range accuracy over ballistic rounds).

  Thus, you could probably reduce fusion plant output by 75% and reduce
energy weapon ROF by a similar degree without too much difficulty. This
also makes batteries that much more practical for use in HG.

Then why have transponders say anything other than that?  If you can record

that is about all they do say...they come sealed, with regeistry info, but

If I were in your campaign, I would set my transponder to say that I was an
Imperial Navy destroyer, at least when I was anywhere I thought I could get
away with it.  That would keep the pirates away, now wouldn\'t it?  Even
better, if I were a pirate, I would put that on my transponder so that the
locals wouldn\'t mind me watching over their system for a few days from 3AU
out.

Ok, I\'ve revised the fonts and attempted to imbed them. I\'ve also added the
scale, 1.5 m per square (I\'m a traditionalist when it comes to deck plans).
Any way, please try the files again and let me know it they work all right.
I tried them on my lap top and they showed up alright on it so I hope
they\'ll be ok.

Note that if you increase the number of lasers and missile proportionally
the lasers pull ahead (since each laser can engage each missile, albeit
at the increasing minuses...) If you manage the sequences right, X 
laser turrets will pretty much always stop 2*X missiles...

Is this really the way triple turrets work? This needs to be clarified.
I assumed that if a single gunner fires all three lasers in a triple
turret he/she made a to-hit roll independently, with no modifiers, for
each. Otherwise (as you note) triple turrets are near-useless.

there are a few backwater worlds where coups and counter-coups may result
in divided crews. The captain supports the new regime, his first officer
is a loyalist, and so on -- an attempt at peacefully sequestering the
other side fails, and fighting rages through the ship -- and maybe even
several ships in a particular squadron. This would make a good scenario,
actually.

It could also justify an interesting kind of pirate: some of the ships on
the losing side (if they have jump drive) might decline to surrender or
fight to the finish, and instead depart for a life of crime to support
themselves in the hopes of an eventual return. Remember, it ain\'t just
Vargr who have coups...

Most of the calculations appear to be assuming that all of the energy is 
radiated uniformly in all directions from the hull in the form of heat. 
As has been pointed out, the energy has to go somewhere, but there are 
other ways of getting rid of it. One approach would be to convert the 
heat to another form of energy, say laser light or microwaves, that 
could be directed outward into interstellar space. The process would not 
be 100% efficient, but should reduce the signature of the ship 
significantly as seen from inside the solar system. Another ship further 
out passing through the radiated beam, however, would see a tremendous 
signature. A starting guess would be that, with improved technologies, 
90% or more of a ship\'s excess energy could be beamed away from the 
inner solar system. This would be a form of stealth and would require 
special equipment.

Since very few ships spend much time outside of the Oort cloud, it would 
be very unlikely that the beamed energy would be detected. 

Glad to be back on the TML!

Cold fusion is actually worse for percentage of waste energy than hot
fusion (basic thermodynamics.) 

To go with higher power plant efficiency (and the TL13-15
power plants in FFS2 are already up at about 99%), 
you also have to assume that all devices on the ship are very efficient-
that none of the power that goes into your maneuver drive, for example,
comes out as heat. (Since maneuver drives already create energy, maybe
this isn\'t a bad assumption.) You need superconducting cables everywhere,
etc...

One certainly can assume that the power plant radiators run at lower 
levels most of the time - non-combat, or landing, for example. One 
could also assume that they include air-cooling modes for operating in
an atmosphere (so you don\'t bake everyone below you...just blow very 
hot air above you.) (Another reason for ships to still use the 
"blast pits" seen on old starport maps...) 

Another way to get rid of excess heat would be to vent very very very
hot plasma (accounting for CT-style fuel consumption for power plants),
but that makes you incredibly easy to detect, since you can\'t 
baffle the plasma.

I think (in my Copious Spare Time) I may work on the "Conservative
Sensor Rules" - a rules set that assumes (somehow) lower total heat
production, and that sensor technology develops more slowly...

I had a dicsussion this summer with a TML\'er where we sort of agreed that:
  - we could deal with transmissions activating other SDG transponders.
  - it was internally consistent for "Virus" to spread itself physically
by etching additional circuitry to reach another system (see A:13 /GK).
  - it made no sense whatever for Virus to spread via fiber-optic lines
or broadcast transmissions to non-SDG components.
  : therefore, if common Imperial comp tech used linkages through which
Virus could physically spread, then that should have been stated.

  IIRC, neither of used Virus (or played TNE).

For reference:

My friend Ian (a physicist) once calculated that his free trader starship
should be glowing red when running at full power. MegaTraveller starships
are really hot!  After verifying that I had given him the correct _gaming_
statistics, he then decided to lump it under the "suspension of disbelief"
catagory, and went off muttering about "scientific illiterates trying to
repeal the law of gravity" -- which is when i told him about contragrav :-)

The solutions are:

1) Lower Traveller power requirements to more reasonable levels, and keep
realistic sensor rules.

2) Keep power requirements, and accept the easy detectability of starships.

3) Keep power requirements, and lower sensor sensitivity as well to
maintain some level of ship stealth (same effects as 1, different
mechanism).

Possibly we should have a new geek code?

Actually, I think he\'s referring to the growing anti-immigration (legal
and otherwise) sentiment, which is most often aimed at Latinos as the
most obvious, and most mentioned in the press. This is in contrast to
the _true_ situation...in NYC one of the largest groups of illegal
aliens are Irish. More to the point, it is disproportionately latinos
who are stopped and interrogated as to their citizenship status...I have
known people who were told they should carry their birth certificates
with them so they don\'t get deported. Deported to where I don\'t know,
since they were born here, like their parents were...

ObTrav: This is actually a great example of xenophobia rating in

Yes, but the Grand Chamberlain or whatever the master of ceremonies is called
could hardly have expected that, now could he? As far as he is concerned,
Dulinor has asked for a formal meeting with the Emperor, precisely one where
it would be inappropiate to use a substitute. The Emperor is unavailable. A
few minutes after the meeting starts Dulinor can be expected to realize that
he is not facing the Emperor. Wouldn\'t you have told him in advance and
most humbly begged his pardon? I would.

OH, I forget, the Grand Chamberlain was not informed. (In fact, no one appears
to know that the impostor is missing from his usual appartment either). I
guess Iolanthe went to fetch the stand-in himself. Well, substitute Iolanthe
for the Grand Chamberlain in the argument above.

Something else to consider is that there are presently computerised sonar

registered starships, and their jump signatures.  Of course, this adds a
lot to the xboat traffic, but there you go...

Some subsector fleets ARE exactly as the description has it, composed of
obsolescent IN castoffs. The Duke of Lunion, for example, would be happy to
buy obsolescent IN ships, because the best he can procure locally is TL 13
(I still think he\'d buy some local TL 13 designs, but maybe not). And dukes
of subsectors with TL 14 high-pop planets would still be interested in IN
TL 15 retirees. Even dukes with TL 15 planets would buy _some_ ships from
the IN. And those are the ships the public hears about. "DELPHINE BUYS
CLUNKERS! BUY LOCAL, SAYS UNION BOSS!!!" the headlines of the opposition
press and the yellow press will say, forgetting to mention that she is only
buying a few clunkers and many local ships.

IMO. The proper place to store ships in ordinary is surely spread out

Otherwise you have a few thousand ships orbiting Depot and no way to

I dont think so, you\'re underestimating the quality of your own work :*>.

One of the things that struck me when I first saw your minor race generation 
tables was the utter logical nature of them. Your tables are pretty much self 
explanatory. The only thing I can\'t figure out is what are "components". Its not 
immediately obvious and I can\'t find it explained in the text anywhere. The other 
thing that could cause confusion is the Caste "Sport". Its not defined in the text 
and to a neophile I\'d imagine it would conjure up images of professional 
atheletes ("hey now theres a race that has a distinct biological gender devoted 
to sports"). but other than that the Minor Race Generation tables are fairly 
much self explanatory.

  A common theory is that mercenary companies with the correct licences
could use higher-end gear - not unreasonably given the Imperial tendency
to use them as low political cost proxies within the 3I itself.

  As for pirates, to a large extent it\'s relative armament that counts -
a knife is enough when your target has only a sweaty brow...

>But that is mute.  The sensor discussion did it for me. 
/.../ Pirate don\'t work in defended systems.

  Actually, I suspect that it would be very hard to build a system with
anything like near-universal fast response defenses, unless it had very
few traffic nexi to protect, or very large resources. So, while a Pop 7
mainworld may be effectively inviolable the outer system defenses amy be
quite porous - which would make a good case for not using starships for
certain commercial missions.

  Likewise, a Jump from the (safe) mainworld to a large and well-protected
facility not within a 100-D effect would be quite safe.

As a matter of curiosity I sat down and made a list of the fleets from the
map in _Rebellion_. As it is 320 lines long I won\'t post it, but anyone
who wants a copy can just e-mail me for it.
Summary: The following fleets are not shown on the map: 77th, 118th, 131st,
189th, 256th, 274th, 303rd, 315th, 316th, 317th, 318th, 319th, 320th.

Ignoring the four fleets mentioned in the text as constituting the Corridor
Fleet (presumably erroneously), the following fleet numbers are duplicated:
108th, 128th, 179th, 193th, 212th, 213th (triplicated!), 214th, 255th, 260th.

Also there are a number of subsectors with a sliver of Imperial worlds in them
that does not have fleets assigned, some of the slivers quite as big as those
of some subsectors that do have fleets. I didn\'t list them or try to go
deeper into that.

#1 : Mainworlds with either signifigant trade or signifigant economies can
and will defend their space out to about their 100 diameter limits.

#2 : These defenses will make piracy in and around mainworlds unprofitable.

#3 : These defenses do not extend to the entire system.

#4 : Most career pirates concentrate on the unsafe outsystems.

#5 : Shippers apply risk premiums to trade with either unsafe systems or
outsystems.

#6 : Merchant ships specialising in trading in unsafe areas tend to be
heavily armed

#7 : Merchant ships specialising in trading in safe areas tend to be
lightly armed or unarmed

#8 : The best markets for stolen starships and cargos are in other states,
however unsafe areas will buy commodities they know to be stolen at heavily
discounted rates

#9 : Pirate ships will tend to be converted merchants, as unsafe areas tend
not to be profitable enough to justify custom-built warships. Safe areas
tend to be too dangerous for even custom built warships to operate in for
long enough to defray their build costs. Pirate warships may exist from
mutinous or rebel crews.

A corrollory of #4 and #5 is that Outsystems will tend to remain
underdeveloped, as they cannot develop until they are secure, and they are
not worth securing until they are developed.

Now, are all the principals of the GPD happy with this so we can put this
in the FAQ ?

I read (I forget where) a theory that naval military technology since the
end of the classic period has been driven by the quest to find a decisive
ship sinking weapon like the ram was in the heyday of the trireme. The
argument is that until the invention of workable explosive shells ships
didn\'t get sunk (to all intents and purposes) in combat, instead after
hours of bettering they became incapable of resisting boarding parties.
Note that aside from subs and aircraft WWI and WWII BBs were in a similar
situation, though they did tend to sink in the end. Given that this state
of affiars lasted for over 1500 years, I can see no reason why it shouldn\'t
be able to exist in the far future.

IMO one problem Traveller ship combat has is that people want the feeling
that you get having mighty ship pounding away at each other like a WWI
slugfest, but they also want the quick thrill of the cat and mouse game of
fire and maneuver and these are two fairly incompatible desires.

Gurps is pretty much the same.  With a good gunners and tageting software
it\'s 1 laser one dead missle per turn.  The only way to get misile hits is a
large salvo that closes fast enough to overwhelm the defenses.  It is doable
but not very cost effective.  Those misiles are pricy.

Sorry have to make some corrections.   I missed some things in sidebars ect.

I have my book with me so I looked it up.  I was just reading the space
combat section when this came up.

Do to turn limits in the combat situation you have to shoot a ship or a
missle but not both with each laser.  A scout with one triple laser turret
fired on by 9 missles from 2 seconds out will be hit by three missles if the
gunners involved do not miss.

1st second shoot three misiles: gunner skill 15 (above average professional)
+ 15 accuacy (limited to gunner shill) +4 aiming +10 computer (very good
comp.) +2 active sensor +4 rof =50 - 41 for range 1 = 9  You must role less
the 9 on three d6 but 17 and 18 always fail.

I assume here that you hit.

2nd second shoot three missles and get hit by the other three. range 0 role
to hit = 21  (including a +10 for point defense bonus and shorter range)

3 missles hit if misile gunner roles his success number for colition damage
plus explosion

missile cost 22kcr each.

There\'s no shortage of people willing to try something stupid in order to
get rich. No argument there. But to rob a bank all you need is a $50 gun
(or a $5 toy gun). How many stupid fools that owns (or controls) a MCr30
tool do you think there would be?

With those odds you need 1000 fools with MCr30 tools for each successful
pirate you get. Just how many successful pirates do you think that would
make for?

I think that you misunderstood what he was saying.  Reservists by nature are
NOT out in the space lanes in their ships.  An example of Reserve activity
would be that they meet one weekend a month and go active for two weeks in
the summer.  This would then cause one to believe that the ships of the
Reserve Fleet are ALMOST moth-balled and would take some time to bring
on-line.  Reservists routinely take they active duty period fixing up there
"vehicles" and training to maintain their standards for going to war.  You
would see the occasional Reserve Ship out and about just so they can blow
the cob webs out.  Think for a minute, if you are only on active duty for
two weeks and a jump takes one week then you would only be able to take your
ship out and right back and be done for the year.

I based my statement on US Reservists, i.e. 1 weekend a month and 2
weeks a year.
at this rate the ships would not be able to leave orbit and get the
crews back to thier regular jobs in time.  If the reserves work
differently IYTU then I made a bad assumption.

Gurps is pretty much the same.  With a good gunners and tageting software

a
large salvo that closes fast enough to overwhelm the defenses.  It is
doable

I agreee about the chances to hit,  in the game we ran one turret stopped 4
missiles (but 4 more got through)

I have my book with me so I looked it up.  I was just reading the space
combat section when this came up.
Do to turn limits in the combat situation you have to shoot a ship or a
missle but not both with each laser.
************
GT 169  a weapon may be fired in point defense even it it engaged another
target in the direct fire phase.



1st second shoot three misiles  (likely but not curtain)  gunner skill 15 +
15 accuacy +4 aiming +10 computer (very good comp.) +2 active sensor +10
defensive fire  +4 rof =60 - 41 for range 1 = 19  You must role less the 21
on three d6 but 17 and 18 always fail.
*************
I get: 15+15acc +10comp +2 active sensor +10pd +4rof -39 Range (PD fire may
only be taken against ramming attempts.) = 17 or less for the first missile
each additional missile engaged is a further -2 to hit. he does however
have 3 lasers so can roll 3 times on each attempt.  this gives him
17,15,13,11,9,7,5,3,1 that he needs to roll against for point defense...so
most likely 2-3 missile hits.


With this you can have a 10 or less to kill a missle at 30 hexes.
*****************888
the TL 12 lasers only have a range of 8 hexes.


 The
problem is how fast are the misile moving 1g = 1 hex per second
********************
per turn...not per second (turns are 20 min long)




3 missles hit if missle gunner role his success number.
***************
it is actually a contest of skills for the pilot of the ship and the
missile gunner this hapens before PD fire, and missile that miss can be
ignored for that turn (they may have enough Dv to loop around and come
back).


**********8
what Charles neglects to mention is the effects of velocity on damage...if
there is only a modest vector differnce between the ship and the missile
(say 5 hexes) even one can do massive damage to a scout....

the missile (best case only one gets through) will do 6dx500 (5). the scout
has DR 200, so effective DR is 40....assuming average damage for the
missile 3.5*6*500=10,500 -40 = 10,460. the scout has 15,000 Hp and so will
take 6 critical hits (6 rolls on the major damage table) almost certan to
be crippled, possibly a floating wreck....)

As Charles has pointed out, the Reserve Fleet is just that HELD IN RESERVE.
Reservists (by today\'s standards and I can\'t see why it would change at all)
spend two weeks on active duty a year.  They meet one weekend a month.
Reservists would probably augment the IN and the sub-sector navy when on
active duty for their two weeks.  They might possibly work on their ships to
help keep them up and ready for deployment.  Either way you look at it the
Reserve Forces are not there in ANY numbers that would be of any help to the
pirate interdiction role.

Thing is, HG lets you do odd-sized hulls.  A size code 9 ship is anything from 
900 to 999 tons.  Just watch your decimal points.

That, too.

IIRC MT fusion plants use about 0.05 kl/hr/MW, maybe divided by 3 because
of efficiency for 0.01667 kl/hr. FF&S1 fusion plants use about 0.1
kl/year/MW which is about 1500 times more efficient.

So what limit, if any, do you put on the distance from a gravity source
that a T-plate can be and still function? If it\'s 1000 or 2000 diameters a
misjump of more than a few hundred AU will kill a T-plate ship\'s crew far
more certainly than a HEPlaR\'s, especially as the HEPlaR fuel supply may be
enough to allow a jump.

You know that is not posible.  I\'ve already eat my crow on this subject
thank you.  I do not care for left overs (Grin).

Seriously though I did learn a lot about current astrological tech. I did
not know.  It was worth the effort for that alone.  Now that I have the
background theory I makes sence.  I still am curious about the integration
time require for 3 ls detection of a scout ship.

loose to a pallet 2m from the shelves, while in a -10c freezer. Moving the
pallet the 10-15 meters to shrink-wrap took another 2 minutes on average,
including opening and closing the 1/4-ton sliding door. Shrink wrap took
another 5 minutes, and then it was a fairly stable unit. The guys who
worked the wharehouse (I worked the co-located icecream plant) could load
and move faster than I could. BTW, a 1/2ton pallet of ice cream is about 2m
tall, and uses a 1.5x1.5m pallet which is about 7-12 cm tall it\'s self,
weighing about 10kg. Lined up pallets go on trucks at the loading-dock at
the rate of about 1-2 per minute, depending on skill and depth of refer
van, at least that\'s what I\'ve seen done. A full van can be unloaded to the
dock (which is level with the floor of the reefer van floor) in under 15
minutes for a fully palletized load in a 40\' trailer. And about as long to
get the load into the freezer, using about 5 men for each task.

One able to survive some rigorous treatment.  20000k is a lot of heat.  What
happens when this ship lands in water?  The vane will make a tempting target
for laser gunners.  No vane no power.  The ship would burn up without it if
the reater is running.  If you use those efficency numbers.

No I did not, The thermalelectrics were ment to cut signature by
suplimenting the battery power so that less power would need to be draw from
the batteries.  Discharging batteries causes true waste heat.  Reusing power
by partial heat recovery does not produce any more waste heat than the heat
caused by the use of that power.  It is more efficient than battery power as
far as waste heat is concurned but because the system is loosing heat into
space you will need to replace that lost power from the batteries but not as
much as you would have to without the heat recovery system.

The idea is to reduce the heat signature too 300k or less by running only on
battery power.  No operating fussion plant.

You\'re using some other stuff rather than straight HG.  Under HG, your hull 
costs the same whether it\'s mild steel or ferrocement or superdense.  Cost of 
materials is factored into it already.  If you\'re gonna evaluate a HG design, 
set your FS&S on the coffee table and take stuff right from HG.  I see the 
figures for armour bulk as reasonable for HG as it factors in \'inferior\' 
materials at lower tech levels.  The lower your tech, the more bulk you need 
to get the same armour protection on your hull and the more bracing you need 
because your \'state of the art\' is still under developement.

Where? Not previously in that particular essay. Elsewhere we\'re told that
CruRons typically have 4-8 cruisers and we\'re told of some BatRons that have
8 battleships. And elsewhere we\'re told of some squadrons with 4-5 capital
ships. 

>Then the minimum 2 squadron fleet (of even the max of 10 ships/squadron)

Unless they\'re atypical. We have at least one example of an oversized
squadron.

But I\'ll back down and say that there are discrepancies either way, so your
interpretation is also possible. The real kicker is that it is difficult
enough to spend the canonical naval budget if we assume 2000 capital ships
per sector. If we assume only 1000 capital ships we either have to reduce
the budget drastically or see the number of auxiliaries go through the
roof (you can get hundreds of escorts for the price of ONE battleship.)

I know what you\'re going to say: Then let\'s reduce the budget. That\'s
certainly an option. Let\'s examine it: 

Let\'s take a look at the figure I\'ve been using to base the Imperial budget
on, an average of 3% of GWP on military spending.

First question: Is it canonical?

Answer: Yes. Despite what anyone may think, _Striker_ is no less canonical
than any other official source. And _Striker_, Book 2, p. 38 says:

"The average expenditure of a nation or world on its military is 3% of GNP;
on worlds where the state of international tension is high, this may range
as high as 15%; where little conflict has been experienced for extended
periods of time the military budget may be as low as 1% of GNP.
        The total military budget must be divided between the army and the
navy. The proportion allocated to the army averages 40% on most worlds, but
averages only 6% on worlds with vacuum or trace atmospheres. Planetary
defenses are jointly funded by the army and navy; the referee must decide
what effect this will have on the army budget.
        On Imperial worlds, roughly 30% of the total military budget goes to
the Imperium for maintenance of the Imperial military. On independent worlds,
the entire budget is available for local defense."

Second question: Does this figure conflict with other canonical material?

Answer: Yes, of course. That\'s why we\'re having this discussion. What
information we have about the Imperial Navy strength seems to indicate a
much lower figure. If the 1000 combat ship per sector figure is for the
regular navy only, then 3% appears to be 2-3 times too big; if the figure
includes the colonial fleets too, then the figure appears 4-6 times too big.
Unless the peacetime IN has a HUGE number of ships laid up in ordinary, that
is.

Also, the figure is low if compared to the figures that _Trillion Credit
Squadron_ and _Pocket Empires_ provide. TCS use 5% on the Navy alone, no
mention of the army; PE figures are fluid, but can reach 20-30% IIRC (I may
be a bit off here).

Q: Could the _Striker_ information be explained away as changed from the
correct one to enhance game play?

A: I don\'t see how. Does _Striker_ games work better if the armies are three
or six times bigger than the \'real\' armies? What possible reason could there
be for giving too high a figure? I can see why you may want to reduce the
forces involved to simplify game play (That\'s how I explain the forces in the
_Fifth Frontier War_ boardgame). But why make them too high?

Q: So is 3% of GWP unrealistic in itself? Can we dismiss it on the grounds
that no society could possibly afford such heavy expenditures?

A: No. Real World examples makes it abundantly clear that at least some
societies can survive with peacetime expenditures far higher than that. That
dosen\'t mean that someone laying down ground rules for the economies of high
tech or high population societies in his SF gameworld couldn\'t claim that
such societies are less able to afford military spendings. At least no one
could point to a Real World example of a TL 15 high-pop society and
contradict him. But that\'s not the case here. _Sriker_ says that high-tech,
high-population societies CAN afford it, and the Real World does not say them
nay. So we can\'t dismiss it as inherently unrealistic.

Q: Is it unrealistically low, then? During the cold war some societies spent
far more than that, and the Imperium is in two or three cold wars at the
moment (Confederation, Consulate, League).

A: Perhaps a little. But OTOH, the Imperium is bigger than both (or all
three) its cold war opponents together. Not much bigger, but bigger. So I\'d
be inclined to accept it, just to avoid making things worse.

Q: So why can\'t we reduce it to 1 or 0.5%?

A: That, as I\'ve had pointed out to me repeatedly, is not a question of
logic but of individual perception of plausibility. I for one have trouble
enough accepting the 3% as realistic, given the Imperium\'s history of
conflict with the Solomani and Zhodani, but I\'m quite aware that others
are... less sceptical. All I can say is that I do not accept that 0.5% is
so obviously far more likely than 3%.

Q: But adjusting the Imperial force levels would also create canon trouble,
wouldn\'t it?

A: Yes. Whichever way you resolve the discrepancy you get into trouble. But
on the one hand we have a general rule and on the other specific details. If
you settle on a plausible general rule and try to fix as many of the specific
details as you can, you end up with a basic system that works well. If you
change the general rule to something implausible then you wind up with a
system that does not work well, laying down problems for the future.

Thing is, HG lets you do odd-sized hulls.  A size code 9 ship is anything from 
900 to 999 tons.  Just watch your decimal points.

That, too.

Sorry, light is not my normal band.  It\'s been a few years sence my last
major optical design project.  Most things that can be done with light can
be done cheaper and easier in other ways in the areas that I work in at

Yeow! Thats one big mother!  Just out of curiousty and as an adventure seed,
what kind of salvage could be gotten from such an array?  As in credit per
ton of the array or support equipment like computers salvaged?  What type of
computer would this base need to run the array?  The rest of the bases gear
would be standard stuff I would assume.  Say if one of these sensor bases
were knocked out with a bioweapon by an enemy spy during a war and the PC
hear a rumor and decide to collect the Credit and accidentally bring back
the bioweapon as well. (Evil grin)

Bruce they are not magic.  No more so that your photo integration technique.
Look in any Omega temperture catalog for simple examples.  They are called
thermal couples.  They do not absorb much heat they just produce electicity
in the presents of heat by converting the molecutar motion caused by heat
into electron motion.  It is a standard condition of dissimiler junctions.
You were right about your baliwick and I admited it once I had the hard
data.  Look at a thermal couple catalog and you will see their basic
operation is as I have discribed.  The why is real long and technical as it
gets into the nature of matter and was part of the theory I was taught 15
years ago in coledge.  This effect is being harness in the last few years to
produce solid state devices that can heat or cool and devices that when
exposed to a heat gradiant produce a decent amount of power, as compared to
basic thermal couples.  When just heated they produce less power.  There is
no magic.  The efficency of these devices is low in the power production
mode.  (less that 10% and varies greatly with type and designed for application)

As for the electricity it goes back into the system to allow a lower total
drain on the batteries.  I supposed a ship running only on batteries to cut
its signature.  The converters were to reuse some of the heat to limit
battery draw and the waste heat associated with battery discharge.  It would
be better to reuse the heat than just waste it.  In effect though you only
reduce the total signature by part of the theoritical saving as when the
heat signature drops, power from the converters drop as well and the power
used per second by the system for work would remain constant once
homeostasis is reached.  Depending on the performance curves of year 5000
thermoelectic devices the heat signature saving could be as high as half the
battery\'s waste heat.  If you insulated the battery compartment and lined it
with thermoelectrics you might see less saving at a considerable cost saving
over lining the hull.  Doing both would produce the best results but cost
the most.

Why do you find the concept fo thermoelectic devices so odd?  You already
work with one of their relatives the photoelectric device.  Thermoelectric
devices are just IR tuned solar cells in theory in practise their makeup is
simpler in some ways and different in others do to a much greater temperture
range.

The current market has been using thermoelectric cooler/heaters for the last
3 years that I am aware of.  Those warmer/ice chests that plug into your
cigerete lighter was one of the first consumer products to use this tech.

The cost/effeciency problem (like with solar cells) are keeping their market
presence low.  Until price per watt drops by a facter of 1000 or more you
are not likly to see these devices outside research labs or satalites.  Oh,
did I mention that one of the other variation on this theme is used in
nuclear batteries?  They are all basicly the same concept.  Some form of
energy is use to push the electron accross the potential barrier of the
junction and free it to flow as electricity.

Heh. That could also mean that they are in better training than the idle,
slothful Imperial Navy ;-). But OK, I\'ll give you that. Only, whare does
it say that the training takes place in orbit around the high population
worlds?

Again, I\'ll grant you that. Now tell me, if the colonial spacemen serve the
same number of years and get the same training as Imperial spacemen, how can
this be true?

So it says. But does it make sense? Try this little thought experiment:

You\'re the Duchess Delphine of Mora. You and the IN Quartermaster General for
Mora have just pocketed two checks for this year\'s Imperial naval budget
split right down the middle (You\'ve also got a check for Mora System\'s
military budget, but we\'ll ignore that since you got that one wearing a
different hat). On your budget you have a post named "New ships: 25%" (25% of
10% is 2.5%; this will completely replace your fleet in 40 years). According
to _High Guard_ you may procure the ships from any shipyard inside the
subsector. Obviously you\'re also allowed to buy them from the IN. So you lean
across the table and ask the QM if he has any good bargains. "Why yes," he
replies, "As usually the Navy is getting rid of 1/40th of its ships. I can
offer you some lovely 40 year old TL 14 ships for 25% of original price. Of
course, you have to pay as much for maintaining them as if they were new.[*]"

[*] Propably more, but let\'s not open that can of worms.

So you have the choice between buying some obsolescent, 40 year old, TL 14
clunkers from the IN or to buy some brand new, top of the line, TL 15 ships
from your own shipyards. What would YOU prefer?

But let\'s say you are a glowing patriot or have some other reason to buy
from the IN. Let\'s also say that your need for different ship types exactly
match the mix the IN can offer you. Let\'s further say that none of the ships
the IN built 40 years ago have been lost since. You\'ve now spent one fourth
of your procurement budget. What do you do with the rest? Do you ask if you
can buy a few more ships from the IN? In that case the QM will regretfully
inform you that his colleagues have sold all the obsolescent ships of their
subsectors to your fellow dukes. There are no more ships to be had. So how-
ever reluctant you are to benefit your subsector with procurement orders, it
looks like you will have to order a few new ships from your local shipyards.
Of course, if you are lucky enough to have some TL 13 or 14 planets with
shipyards, you can avoid the awful prospect of getting TL 15 ships in your
navy. And if you really insist, I suppose you can get them to use old designs
so that the ship is obsolescent from the start.

>From experience I know that there are people who don\'t recognize a _reductio
ad absurdum_ argument when they see it (I\'m not referring to you, but there
are some), so I\'ll be specific: The above scenario shows (IMO) that the
concept of a colonial fleet consisting solely of obsolescent IN castoffs does
not agree with the procurement rules. "But it says so right here in the
book!" I hear you cry. Yes it does. Another discrepancy. Is there a way to
explain it away? I believe so:

Some subsector fleets ARE exactly as the description has it, composed of
obsolescent IN castoffs. The Duke of Lunion, for example, would be happy to
buy obsolescent IN ships, because the best he can procure locally is TL 13
(I still think he\'d buy some local TL 13 designs, but maybe not). And dukes
of subsectors with TL 14 high-pop planets would still be interested in IN
TL 15 retirees. Even dukes with TL 15 planets would buy _some_ ships from
the IN. And those are the ships the public hears about. "DELPHINE BUYS
CLUNKERS! BUY LOCAL, SAYS UNION BOSS!!!" the headlines of the opposition
press and the yellow press will say, forgetting to mention that she is only
buying a few clunkers and many local ships.

What do you think? Generally I dislike "that\'s not the truth, that\'s what the
public thinks is the truth" explanations, but if they are the best one can
come up with I think they\'re better than nothing.

>...the 50-200 ship numbers do not specify if this is combatant only or
>non-combatants and combatants.

No, but it is quite likely. I\'ll grant you that they _could_ be speaking of
both kind. But just above the text has specifically mentioned that auxiliaries
are excluded. Later when they do begin to talk about auxiliaries too they
specifically mention them and even state that they are often ignored when
figuring ship totals.

>I would say this is both combatants and non-combatants, thus the average
>31.25 combatants per fleet would be a good number.

For reasons I\'ve stated in my reply to Gary, I disagree.

He had access to the Deneb Depot. And does the notion that the majority of
the Imperial reserves are stored at the Depots meet the reality check? Not
IMO. The proper place to store ships in ordinary is surely spread out around
the shipyards that are going to do the work of reactivating them, isn\'t it?
Otherwise you have a few thousand ships orbiting Depot and no way to
reactivate them.

Physiology

Unlike most known Human races, the Luriani are a discrete species (Homo 
luriani) and are not interfertile with other Humans. However significant portions 
of the Luriani genome were utilised by Rule of Man geneticists in the 
"construction" of the Scanians, thus the Luriani are interfertile with this branch 
of Humaniti. Matings with other branches of Humaniti will only produce sterile 
offspring.

Physiologically the Luriani are unmistakably human, but they do possess a 
number of unique identifying physical characteristics, however these 
characteristics are only apparent on a close physical inspection. The Luriani 
posses a transparent second eyelid which protects their eyes from pressure 
and irritants, as well as acting to improve their vision under water. They 
possess muscles that can seal the inner ear, protecting it at extreme depths. 
They naturally produce a number of body oils that protect them from cold and 
irritants. Both their feet and hands are webbed. However, their most notable 
adaptations are the fat cells they posses which store oxygen. This allows them 
to collapse their lungs and reach far greater depths (around 500m) than other 
Humans, as well as permitting them to remain in an oxygen free environment 
for up to thirty minutes.

However, distinctive as all of these characteristics are, they are not the most 
remarkable modifications to the Luriani. The most remarkable and influential 
adaptations in the Luriani are found in their brains. At least 93% of all Luriani 
are right brain dominant and their language centres are located in the regions of 
the brain more usually associated with music and singing. These modifications, 
coupled with their close ties with the aquatic environment have produced the 
distinctive features of the Luriani culture.

Culture

Luriani culture is strongly influenced by the right hemisphere nature of their 
brain. The Luriani are a creative, passionate and artistic people. The usual 
Imperial stereotype of the hotblooded Luriani artist does in fact have some 
basis in truth. Luriani music and art frequently reflects the emotional tension 
that lies beneath the surface of their society. Few Humans can fail to be at 
least slightly affected by the pulsating up-tempo bass rhythms of Luriani music, 
even more so when coupled with the sensual nature of Luriani dance. However, 
as with all stereotypes, this ignores the vast sweep of Luriani culture.

Many outside observers characterise Luriani society as being communal; in 
fact the Luriani are very strongly individualistic, but they utilise a form of group 
marriage in which a number of adults will form a distinct family grouping. Any 
children born into the family are regarded as brothers and sisters and all the 
adults will regard them as their children. Because of this, the universal Human 
incest taboo is slightly altered amongst the Luriani. It is accepted that some 
"siblings" will form relationships with their "brothers and sisters" during pubity. 
Such relationships are discouraged, but they are tolerated as long as the 
children do not share a biological parent. However, the relationships between 
the adults within the family are in a constant state of flux.

The Luriani believe in individual and family honour. The Luriani code of honour 
evolved as a mechanism to limit the negative effects of the Lurianis emotional 
nature. Luriani honour holds that effort and intent are far more important than 
actual results; Luriani mythology is replete with stories and examples of heroic 
failure. The three basic tenets of Luriani honour are protect your family; offer 
hospitality to all that seek it; and treat your foes fairly. Unlike many other 
honour codes, the Luriani code does not feature a physical duelling element, 
rather matters of personal honour are settled by "contests. In a contest, the 
two parties will attempt to complete some task or demonstrate mastery of a 
skill, usually artistic. As long as both parties have made given their best, there 
is no stain on ones honour for loosing such a contest. When it comes to 
warfare, the Luriani hold that this is a matter for nations and tribes, not 
individuals; thus war does not remove a Lurianis obligations on a personal 
level, even when serving in the military.

Art

Art is one of the most important elements of Luriani culture, outside of the 
Protectorate art is the most widely recognised aspect of their culture. Luriani 
art reflects the turbulent and restless nature of their society, very little Luriani 
art can be classified as static, the essence of their art is the movement and 
energy found in their culture. The most prominent Luriani art form is of course 
music, but they are also drawn to most other performance arts (dance is 
almost as widely practiced as music). Other art forms such as painting and 
sculpture are less common, but none the less are still considered noble and 
honourable professions.

Luriani music is distinctive and unique; the most obvious defining characteristic 
is its 10/8 time signature. However, it also possesses a number of other very 
distinctive characteristics. Virtually all Luriani music makes extensive use of 
the voice as an instrument; and slight differences in Luriani physiology has 
resulted their vocal cords being longer than the Human norm, contributing to 
the strong base tendencies in their music. Luriani singing also features a 
secondary voiced note when inhaling in addition to the usual note when 
exhaling, leading to a distinctive "breathy" sound (this effect is remarkably 
difficult for non-Luriani to reproduce, lacking the Lurianis internal independent 
oxygen source).

Fashion

Traditional Luriani clothing and appearance is almost as distinctive and powerful 
as their music. Many have likened their fashions to those of the Vargr. 
Traditional Luriani clothing is lightweight and lose fitting, intended to 
simultaneously functional and sensual. Luriani fashions are intended to be 
provocative and revealing, whilst maintaining a sense of mystery. The concept 
of utilitarian clothing that does not serve this purpose appears to be entirely 
alien to the Luriani. Thus, all Luriani clothing has to serve this dual purpose (the 
Luriani were scandalised by the Solomani and their "sack-like ship suits"). 
Luriani fashions do not use muted or subdued colours; their clothing features 
many irregular blocks of strong discordant colours with sharp dividing lines 
between them. These blocks swirl and interlock, with the intention of giving a 
sense of movement and energy. The intention of the designer is to draw 
attention to certain parts of the body and away from others. Likewise, the 
Luriani make extensive use of body decorations. Rather than using permanent 
forms of body markings such as tattoos, the Luriani use a variety of body 
paints and dyes to adorn themselves. The final result is that the average Luriani 
is a sight to behold; dressed in their vibrant clothing with their bodies painted 
and dyed in many bright contrasting colours and shapes; one can not fail to 
recognise them immediately.

Welll, the proximity fuse and detonator weren\'t on the specs, becuase it
was a blind command-controlled missile (sensors, even cheap LIDARs, are
expensive).

But Ditzie will check ...

Personally, where I live, I have noticed a slowly *improving*
attitude toward all minorities during the last 30 years.  I
certainly haven\'t seen strong anti-latino feelings since the
mid-80\'s.

Well now, maybe you mean the fact that many Americans don\'t like the
idea of aliens flooding across our borders?  If that\'s it, the
disquiet isn\'t specifically anti-latino, it\'s more anti-immigration,
especially illegal immigration, it just so happens that the mass of
the illegal immigrates come from Central American countries.  I
think this is more an economic issue than anything, but like most
things you can make it a racial one if you try.  

Xenophobia is something else.  It\'s an *unreasonable* fear of
outsiders.

    'body' => 'History

The Luriani are a Human minor race transported to their new home by the 
mysterious Ancients some 300,000 years ago. Whilst the Luriani are 
unmistakably Human they have several unique and distinct characteristics 
which are a result of both natural evolution and genetic tampering by the 
Ancients. The Luriani are often referred to as "aquatic" Humans. This is not 
strictly true, for although they are far more at home in a water environment than 
most Humans these adaptations do not go as far as the Solomani geenered 
Scanians. Luriani have distinctively webbed hands and feet; certain fat cells 
have the ability to store oxygen which allows the Luriani to remain submerged 
for up to 30 minutes and reach depths of up to 500 metres without any artificial 
assistance. They possess a clear second eyelid under the first that greatly 
enhances their vision underwater. However perhaps their most striking 
modifications are not readily apparent at all. Unlike virtually all other Human 
races, the Luriani are overwhelmingly right brain dominant and their language 
ability is located in the centre of the brain which normally deals with singing 
rather than the classic speech centres. It would appear that these 
modifications were introduced to enable the Luriani to function well in a three 
dimensional environment. This has lead to further speculation that the Ancients 
intended to make the Luriani fully aquatic but the Final War intervened, leaving 
the Luriani "unfinished. Because of these modifications the Luriani are 
overwhelmingly (at least 93%) lefthanded, intensely creative and artistic, and 
have a strong tendency towards music and other performance arts.

Daramm (the Luriani homeworld) is officially classified as a waterworld, with 
only 5% of its surface being land. However, this is still 19.7 million km2. 
Daramm is a normal world with eleven continental plates, but these are mostly 
below sea level. Thus, Daramm is covered by a large number of continental 
sized island archipelagos surrounded by shallow (150m to 300m) seas. These 
"continents" are surrounded by deep (2000m to 5000m) oceans. It would 
appear that the Ancients initially deposited the Luriani on several islands in one 
of these archipelagos.

The semi-aquatic nature of the Luriani enabled them to utilise the shallow seas 
around their island homes for hunting and gathering, thus allowing for far greater 
populations and development than might have otherwise been expected. 
However eventually the restricted nature of their island homes started to limit 
their development. These growing pressures lead to the development of 
seafaring on Daramm far before the Luriani had even developed anything even 
remotely like civilisation. It is theorised that the creative nature of the Luriani 
brain played a crucial role in this. Thus in approximately -250,000 the Luriani 
developed seagoing vessels whilst they were still a primitive hunter-gatherer 
society. By -150,000, the Luriani had developed oceangoing vessels capable of 
circumnavigating their entire world despite still possessing only a TL0 culture. It 
was the possession of this maritime capacity that preserved the remarkable 
homogeneity of Luriani culture, despite being separated by thousands of 
kilometres of water, each Luriani settlement was connected by a web of 
voyaging ships. Indeed some Luriani lived out their entire lives at sea, only 
setting foot on land to gather supplies or build new ships.

Given this voyaging culture it was only natural that the Luriani should quickly 
come to the concept of trade and commerce, thus giving rise to the first signs 
of Luriani civilisation. By -100,000 the Luriani had developed a thriving world 
spanning barter economy. The huge nomadic voyaging ships travelling between 
islands, trading with the various island communities. However with the rise of 
trade came the rise of piracy and warfare. Both the seagoing nomads and the 
island dwelling settlements found a need for fighters to defend against the 
depredations of raiders, which would eventually evolve into the Luriani warrior 
class. Thus by -30,000 the Luriani had established a world spanning trading 
civilisation complete with organised warfare, despite the fact that they were still 
a TL0 hunter gatherer culture without any domesticated animals or form of 
agriculture.

Over the next 23,000 years the Luriani gradually improved their technology and 
culture. In around -28,000 the first signs of agriculture appeared on a number of 
islands, animals were domesticated around -25,000. Metalworking was 
achieved around -15,000. When Vilani influenced traders contacted the Luriani 
in -7500 they had advanced to a solid TL3. The Luriani were to prove to be 
extremely adept in absorbing advanced technology; and by -7200 they had 
achieved TL9 and were launching their first "voyaging" ships to the stars. By -
6000 they had established a vigorous interstellar culture encompassing over 30 
worlds (most located to spinward of Daramm). However the Luriani never 
grasped the concept of an interstellar state (much as they have never truly 
developed a world spaning government) and their worlds remained a loose 
grouping closely bound by their voyaging culture. However, this somewhat 
idyllic situation was not to remain.

In -5400 the Vilani began the Consolidation Wars. Initially the Vilani ignored the 
Luriani. Located far to trailing on the fringes of explored space, the Vilani 
regarded their independent worlds as a minor threat compared with the many 
organised interstellar states that they faced. This was to prove to be a 
miscalculation on the Vilani\'s part. When in around -4700 the Vilani began 
efforts to incorporate the Luriani they responded by rapidly forming a united 
front to face the common enemy. Early Vilani attempts to incorporate the 
Luriani by economic pressure failed and in 4582 the Vilani opened the Luriani 
Consolidation War.

The initial Vilani offensives were turned back with heavy losses in the face of 
determined resistance. The Luriani proved to be formidable opponents for the 
Vilani, the nature of their brains made three-dimensional combat second nature 
to the Luriani and their warrior class made very efficient fighters. However 
eventually the superior economic weight of the Vilani began to tell and one by 
one the Luriani worlds fell to the advancing Vilani fleets. In -4547 Daramm fell 
and the Luriani were defeated. Despite several revolts they were to remain 
under Vilani rule until the coming of the Solomani in 2223.

When the Vilani conquered the Luriani in -4547 they attempted to impose their 
culture on the Luriani; Vilani governors were placed in control of Luriani worlds 
and the Luriani were expected to conform to Vilani cultural norms. These efforts 
were less than successful, though the Luriani did remain firmly under the 
control of the Vilani, their culture remained largely intact, the Vilani were never 
able to stamp out the emotional and independent nature of the Luriani. Thus 
when the Solomani arrived in the Ley sector in -2223 they were greeted as 
liberators by the Luriani. They allied themselves with the Terrans and a number 
of Luriani units served in the Terran forces during their final drive on Vland, 
proving that they had lost none of their fighting abilities. With the final defeat of 
the Vilani in -2219 the Luriani expected that the Solomani would restore their 
independence. However they were to be sadly disappointed. Unlike the Geonee 
or Suerrat, the Luriani were not granted autonomy under the Rule of Man. 
Naturally this bred resentment with in the Luriani and in -2186 the Luriani 
rebelled against the Rule of Man. What followed was a tragedy for the Luriani. 
Isolated with only a limited production base, the Luriani faced an alliance of 
both Terran and Vilani forces. The Luriani hoped that the other minor races 
would come to their aid. These hopes proved futile and the Luriani were 
gradually worn down and in -2180 their final stronghold fell and in a cruel turn of 
fate, the Luriani again came under Vilani occupation. However under the Rule of 
Man, Luriani art and music found a wide audience amongst the Solomani; and 
this lead to widespread sympathy for the fate of the Luriani. Finally, in -1932 
Empress Juliana established the Luriani Cultural Region. With this, the each 
individual Luriani world was granted internal self-rule, answering to a Solomani 
planetary governor, with the entire region under the control of a military governor 
general.

With the collapse of the Rule of Man in -1776, the Solomani governor general of 
the Luriani Cultural Region found herself isolated and vulnerable. Admiral 
Martinez solved her problems by reaching an agreement with the Luriani. She 
transformed the Luriani Cultural Region into the Luriani Protectorate. Under this 
compromise, her fleet provided protection for the Luriani in return for support, 
while the Luriani worlds were allowed to retain their independence. The 
Protectorate continued to exist into the Long Night; the Protectorate gradually 
evolved into a unique government. The Solomani provided the much needed 
skills to administer a large-scale interstellar government, whilst the Luriani 
provided the necessary support facilities and their warrior class came to 
dominate the Protectorate fleet. Eventually however the Long Night claimed the 
Protectorate, by -1200 the Protectorate fleet had dwindled to just a handful of 
vessels and contact between the worlds had all but ceased. In -1183, Protector 
De Valine acknowledged that the Protectorate could no longer defend the 
Luriani worlds. The Solomani settled on the Luriani worlds and the Luriani 
Protectorate succumbed to the Long Night.

The situation remained unchanged until the coming of the Syleans. The Sylean 
Federation Scout Service reached the Luriani in -29. The arrival of the SFSS 
reawakened the Luriani\'s desires for the stars, Daramm had been able to retain 
TL8 throughout the Long Night, and the Solomani remained a distinct racial 
grouping. Given the prod of the Syleans arrival, the Luriani applied themselves 
to regaining the stars. It took the Luriani just 30 years to recover to TL9 and 
begin to reestablish the Protectorate. By 12, the Luriani Protectorate was a 
thriving interstellar community once more, encompassing most worlds within 5 
parsecs of Daramm. The Protectorate was a curious state, one that the new 
Imperium found hard to understand or deal with. The bulk of the population was 
Luriani by culture, but virtually all the higher levels of administration were 
provided by the Solomani Verasti (Protectors). Eventually the Imperium was 
forced to do something about the Luriani. Initially they tried to incorporate the 
Luriani through diplomatic means and initially this appeared to be a making 
progress, but negotiations stumbled on the Protectorate demand to be allowed 
to retain its identity within the Empire. It was then that Archduke Ishargi of 
Gateway made a huge error of judgement. Believing that a show of force would 
soften the Lurianis negotiating stance, Archduke Ishargi took a sizeable 
Imperial squadron and jumped to Rurur (an important frontier system inside the 
Protectorate). The result was a disaster. By sheer fluke, a substantial portion of 
the Protectorate fleet was conducting exercises in the Rurur system at the 
time. The Protectorate commander (Admiral Sherin) took this action to be the 
opening of an invasion and engaged the Imperial forces. In the resulting Luriani 
War (93-96), the Protectorate forces showed that the Luriani had lost none of 
their flare for three-dimensional warfare and inflicted several sharp defeats on 
the Imperial forces. Eventually cooler heads on both sides prevailed and a face 
saving negotiated settlement was reached. However the Luriani War was to 
leave a legacy of mistrust and tensions between the Protectorate and the 
Imperium remained high for many decades after the war.

With the end of the Luriani War Emperor Artemsus appointed an Imperial born 
Verasti, Duke Sirean of Dirir, as the new Archduke of Gateway (Archduke 
Ishargi had been killed at Rurur). Sirean chose to concentrate his efforts on 
incorporating the rimward portions of Ley sector, whilst attempting to repair 
relations with the Protectorate. Eventually this policy was to bear fruit. By 160, 
the memories of the Luriani War were fading and relations between the 
Protectorate and the Imperium were beginning to improve. However, by this 
time the situation elsewhere had changed. In the Domain of Antares events 
were moving towards the Julian War and securing the rimward flank of Antares 
had become a matter of some urgency. In 162, Archduke Acla reopened 
negotiations with the Protectorate regarding incorporation. These negotiations 
proceeded slowly as a considerable legacy of mistrust remained and had not 
yielded any positive results by the outbreak of the Julian War in 175. 
Throughout most of the Julian War the Protectorate chose to remain neutral 
until the Star Legion drove into Ley in 185. At this point, much to the surprise of 
the Imperium, the Protectorate offered an alliance and joined the War on the 
Imperial side. Though the entry of the Protectorate had little effect on the 
ultimate outcome of the war, Luriani forces were an important factor in halting 
and turning back the Star Legions drive into Ley. With the end of the war in 
191, negotiations resumed on a more positive note and in 202 the Protectorate 
was incorporated into the Imperium.

Just a thought, but aren\'t colonial fleets like the reserve fleets of the
3I?

So if they are the reserve fleets of the 3I, maybe they are made up of
revervists who serve one weekend a month & 2 weeks a year, but by this time
it may be 1 week a month & 1 month a year...  I.e. all those characters who
are not in the military might be members of the colonial fleets, thats how
they got their military skills...

Also, many of the sector, sub-sector, & planetary fleets might also come
into this...  I.e. a colonial fleet might be made up of this sub-sector
fleet providing the CrusRon, this planet providing the DestRon, & the
reservists providing the TankRon...

Also another thought (I know this is kinda jumbled, but I am typing this as
I think of it), is that maybe the Navy starts off the characters in their
first active term in a colonial fleet to gain some safe experience, then
moves him over to a active fleet, then as he or she gets older, they are
transfered back to the colonial fleet to train new members of the fleet...

1. Maybe the 3I has the Reservists serve 2 days a months, not just one

weeks currently.

This would fix the problem many have with the jump in & jump out.

2.Or the 3I could have reservists serve one month out of every year & one
day a month.  This would have the same amount of days as the current plan.

3. Or someone else could come up with an another idea.

One can probably think of tricks to make the rendezvous harder to
detect. For example, put a big honkin tractor (TNE/T4) on the
pirate base to reel ships in without having them use any of their
own fuel...I also haven\'t really done the analysis for how far away
from the base you\'re likely to arrive due to usual jump errors (some
TU\'s would have jump errors be bigger that far from a big mass); 
maybe an ion drive or chemical drive could get you to the base.
(Using HEPlaR would be like writing "come and kill me" in big letters
even if you only used it for a few minutes...)

IIRC, transponders only respond to specific signals (based in concept, I
would suspect, on World War II-era IFF devices).  If that\'s the case,
then, unless the pirate had the current IFF codes for whatever force
he/she/it was trying to impersonate, the transponder wouldn\'t respond
appropriately to being interrogated by the IFF, and would therefore be
marked as hostile.

This assumes the term reserves is used in the same context it is for the
United States: part time military personell.

I don\'t see this in the Imperium (it is canon for the solomani confed
tho... AM 6 IIRC). Rather the reserve fleets are used in the WWII european
sense: units not intended for first line combat assignments, but able
enough to respond as backups and reliefs to front-liners. Colonials woould
fill the same role for the reserve units.

By Sunbeard, I meant career pirate. "Sunbeard, Scourge of Seven Sectors.
Har!" Career meaning like 5+ term pirate.  I find it more than plausible the
odd merchant can\'t keep up w/ his payments, etc and decides to start preying
on his competitors, (or gets shanghaied), etc. Eventually he either gets
caught, "retires", or gets dead, though, even on the fringe.  And it\'s more
than possible that megacorporate raiders as well as the possible forces of the

Dinky little radiators on the inside of the cargo bay doors (this is why
they have to open the doors within a few hours of launch.) I don\'t know how hot
they run, but probably only a hundred C or so. The shuttle\'s advantage 
is that its life support and functions only require a few kilowatts - it
has much less heat to dispose of than a traveller ship. (In fact, sunlight
heat loading might be a major part of the problem.)

I\'m not 100% sure we can redo *everything* to the point where you only
need a little power and can get by with tiny radiators, though - weapon
power, for example, will probably always include 10% waste, and always 
require lots of power. I suppose turrets could have their own dedicated
special high-temp radiators...

I guess the turret radiators could be facing away from the launch
side--you always know that at least the guy you\'re shooting at won\'t
see that radiation :-)

Drives are the other big culprit. Traveller TL15 military ships do
6gs. That\'s a lot of power.

No, the Aslan lesbians arose out of discussions of Aslan society and the
consequences of the high Female:male ratio of the race, the details of
which I remember only dimly...the debate was actually short lived, but
it was such a good addition to the tagline that it\'s sort of stuck...

The deck plans look great, but theexploded view at the back just has funny

If you _did_ include the fonts, then I guess I need some help with Acrobat

Ok, sounds good, but what is your exhaust?  Very hot H2?

Ditto. After the second time my royalty check from ICE bounced I got a
little miffed. I did finally get them to cough up the money they owed me
after quite a long battle. I think told them I needed to buy a kidney or

I\'d love to do work on Traveller, but I just can\'t get behind GURPS as a

You mean to support the T4 IG canon that the authors never get paid ;-)

Not funny when you talk to people like Andy Lilly et al. who did a lot of
work getting material out for IG with tight deadlines. And never got paid.

It has big radiators in the cargo bay that flip out as soon as it hits
orbit.  It also uses as little power as possible... the crew generate more
heat than the electrics.  They also use a lot of low-resistance wiring
(read: fiber-optics and pure copper) to minimise heat buildup from that
source.

I\'m sorry. Recent evidence shows that the Royal Oak was scuttled by her
crew to prevent the German U-Boat crew boarding her, stealing her and
obtaining valuable information... ;-)

Media has played a large role in one of the games I am in currently, in 
the form of one very pushy reporter. He went from being the biggest 
thorn in our side to the only NPC in the game we trusted in fairly short 
order.

In other games, knowing how the media operates in conjunction/relation 
to the government is very important. For some reason we always check 
the news channels for information. Of course, if there is a great deal of 
censorship going on, or the media is all owned, overtly or covertly, by 
one source/political persuasion/etc. then that information is suspect at 
best and should be viewed as such.

I would say that this information is important.

There was some increase to about 652kb, from imbedding the fonts I believe,
still a reasonable size compared to the ~1.5 meg in the original Corel file
and much higher in JPEG formats. I\'d really like to suggest .PDF as a
standard, if the Acrobat package wasn\'t so expensive. I\'m a bit luck to have
it available on my work network, so I can dial it up and use it.

Well, IMO, a transponder is never going to be able to "prove" who you are
and I thought saying they existed for that reason didn\'t work.

If they exist, I think they would be mostly to aid navigation (ships are easier
to track and you don\'t have to take time to call them up to find out who they
are).   It does have some benefit to security because it complicates some
situations because ships have to commit to sneaking up (since once they
are detected they have to explain why their transponders were off which
they may or may not be able to do).

That is why I think they exist.

I like this idea. Could we assume that unbaffled drives are fairly bright,
getting brighter with age? "Jumpflash baffles" are extra equipment that
reducing the signature of the flash. (Let the gearheads define the
performance parameters.) 

As to jump signature, treat that like sonar signatures now: it takes a
skilled professional to discriminate. Most civilians won\'t even know how,
because they don\'t need to know, while experienced navy sensor ops can
sometimes tell you not only who you are but what brand of parts you used
in your last overhaul.

In game terms:

To identify a ship from its jump signature
Edu + Sensor Ops > Impossible
This task is one to two levels easier if the operator is familiar with the
target, one level more difficult of the operator has _not_ had military
training or experience.

Yes, *in that particular essay.*  In the header, first paragraph... "At their
lowest level, Imperial ships are organized into squadrons (from three to 10
similar ships)."

IMO, none of those are credible for disecting the economics of the Third
Imperium (or any polity of the OTU).  It\'s obvious GDW didn\'t use Striker or
TCS (or anything even remotely resembling Pocket Empires) in creating the
background.  All of them are made to be playable *games* (specificially games
for players to have pet "pocket empires" and polities and go to war w/ each
other) and to not simulate "reality" (such as it is) for the OTU.

MT does not have a limit on T-plate efficiency; My campiagns do not either.
I will not retrofit the T-Plate efficiency onto MT as I run it. IMO, it
defeats too much previous cannon (including TCS, to some degree), is ill
thought, and makes no sense. IMTU, True Recationless Thrusters push against
themost significant gravity wells, and thus the objects creating them, and
thus truly are not reactionless, but use the mass of planets, stars, dark
matter, interstellar gasses, etc., as reaction mass. Just like IMTU, a
repulsor CAN be used for fine maneuving in docks.

Since I don\'t run TNE anymore (the combat system is BROKEN, and I\'ve tried
dozens of fixes, and just don\'t like any of them), and don\'t  like T4
except for the Psionics rules and number of skills per term, my players
don\'t expect me to use "questionable" items from the newer canon. If I were
running T4, I\'d use the limits, and if T5 has the limits, when running T5
I\'ll use the limits.

TL 9 anti-grav-thrusters are limited to about 1000 diameters, and no full
thrust after 100 diameters, and I limit gravitic modules (vehicular type)
to 10 diameters for full thrust, and no thrust past 100 diameters.

Since my first reaction to reading these comments was to jump in, I\'m sure
we could generate a nice volume of discussion on the topic.

Yep, caught that and corrected it and reposted.  (sigh, why didn\'t I catch
that the firsth time.)  Missed the pd completely though.

Damn!, missed that you can ingage different targets several times with the
same weapon.

I want a ROF 30 Gattling laser cannon for point defense.  No range to speek
of but +15 ROF fire bonus to swat misiles...lot\'s of missles.  Also good for
crowd control on planet. (Evil Grin)

not according to the table on page 173 1/2d = 10 or 13.  Max is much more.
Love that acc works out to max range.

Note: there is a miss print on the last page.  Hexes are 2000miles not 10,000.

This makes a ship with a high vector very dangerious.  His misiles move fast
and hit hard!

Misiles are nasty again in GT.

Note:  1 small nuke = radioactive gas cloud where ship use to be on a direct
hit.

I think your SDB may need some more armor.

I don\'t have my vehicle book with me.  Do you loose DR from an attack?  Only
on 6s?  How does this work?

Humm...Some extra E_banks in case you loose the reacter would be a good
design idea.  Plus a spare reacter of course.

Good point.  Misiles have gotten REAL nasty!  and the SDB need a lot more armor.

I hope to have a group up and running in a few weeks (first time I\'ll be

I posted something a fair while ago (12 months) that was a query in from
one of my games about how Aslan would consider casual sexual relationships.
It all happened at Dinomn when the Empress Nicholle got into port, and the
female Aslan engineer was bored with all the humans and disappeared... the
thread kind of degenerated after a few interesting posts (Wildstar\'s being
one of the most memorable).

Sure, but if you\'re shooting is any good your target is going to
know ding-dang well where you\'re at, so I don\'t see the reason for
hiding from your target once you start shooting.  ;-> Ok, I really
do, and having radiators scattered around the hull is a good idea.

No question about that.

My approach is to use a different technology for in-system maneuver,
but that only works for heretics like me ;-> For people that use
HEPlaR, or for that matter TPlates, a maneuvering ship is going to
be *very* detectable from at least one direction.  All I can suggest
is to postulate very good baffling to limit the area of exhaust
plume exposure.

That and being able to bank the fusion engine back to single digit
power levels when you aren\'t maneuvering or using weapons.

Gurps is pretty much the same.  With a good gunners and tageting software
it\'s 1 laser one dead missle per turn.  The only way to get misile hits is a
large salvo that closes fast enough to overwhelm the defenses.  It is doable
but not very cost effective.  Those misiles are pricy.

I have my book with me so I looked it up.  I was just reading the space
combat section when this came up.

Do to turn limits in the combat situation you have to shoot a ship or a
missle but not both with each laser.  A scout with one triple laser turret
fired on by 9 missles from 2 seconds out will be hit by three missles if the
gunners involved do not miss.

1st second shoot three misiles  (likely but not curtain)  gunner skill 15 +
15 accuacy +4 aiming +10 computer (very good comp.) +2 active sensor +10
defensive fire  +4 rof =60 - 41 for range 1 = 19  You must role less the 21
on three d6 but 17 and 18 always fail.

With this you can have a 10 or less to kill a missle at 30 hexes.  The
problem is how fast are the misile moving 1g = 1 hex per second accel.
misiles have 6g/TL10 10g/TL12 and a 3 space combat turn duration.

2nd second shoot three missles and get hit by the other three. range 0 role
to hit = 21

3 missles hit if missle gunner role his success number.

missile cost 22kcr each.

I have to disagree, 
I think there have been some interesting arguments this time around.
Although the Piracy theme will never be resolved, the discussion

You\'re using some other stuff rather than straight HG.  Under HG, your hull 
costs the same whether it\'s mild steel or ferrocement or superdense.  Cost of 
materials is factored into it already.  If you\'re gonna evaluate a HG design, 
set your FS&S on the coffee table and take stuff right from HG.  I see the 
figures for armour bulk as reasonable for HG as it factors in \'inferior\' 
materials at lower tech levels.  The lower your tech, the more bulk you need 
to get the same armour protection on your hull and the more bracing you need 
because your \'state of the art\' is still under developement.

 Think you could win with 64 internals at WS0 or 1?  At range 1, about the

	I guess I\'ll rise to the bait on this one as well:  A Fed CA/CC is one of the
few starships in SFB to be able to withstand a full alpha strike on the #1
shield (no shield reinforcement assumed) by another CA/CC/DN and STILL be
combat-capable.  This ability is also shared by some Hydran vessels (the Cen
Hull hits for the Hydrans and the Labs for the Feds, acting as the "7th
shield").

	I have proved this (usually to everyones amazement) many many times; as for
credentials, I have been playing SFB since before the supplements came out
(the little books that is), as well as being a member of Battle Group Phoenix
(TFG playtest group for SFB) for 2 years and becoming a Rated Ace in 1994.

 If you want to nitpik everything to death then you\'ll need too start
footnoting everything you say as well.  I still have not gotten threshold
sensor numbers for these sensors yet.  No one has explained how a 100ton
scout can radiate 10MWs of heat per second as some say it does.  If you want
do carry on this discussion under the debating rules I can do that.  We will
both have to start by proving our primices.  Can you prove a 100MW power
plant has 10MWs of waste heat and a 100ton scout can radiate it without
killing the crew?

	Perhaps the best way to begin is for you to establish YOUR
credentials/qualifications.  You have made some references to your expertise,
but I have seen nothing to back those references up.  As for the debate, may I
respectfully suggest that you consider taking the question t the Trav-Tech
list and solicit thier opinions?  They are a fairly authoritative source of
info (and they will back thier arguments up w/ numbers and proofs...something
I have not noticed in your posts).  The subscription address is
Majordomo@qrc.com and in the body send:

subscribe trav-tech prevattec@worldnet.att.net

>>As for converting
heat to electricity by a solid state means check any thermalcouple reference
book or catalog for a very elementery form of this technology.<<

	Perhaps you would be so kind as to post the names of these reference
materials or catalogs for the very technology that you describe?  Magazine
articles, program references, anything???

No targeting laser to give the attack away.  That\'s what balistic targeting
is for.

If the attacker speed is high (.5c) then 3 seconds is about all the warning
you get from c speed sensors.  Range is not that important, it rate of
closure that count.  If you close in three second for the detection point 3
second is all they get but this is a mute point anyway.  The sensor
discussion killed this type of pirate anyway.

True but what about mercinary companies?  Where do pirates start any way?

But that is mute.  The sensor discussion did it for me.  A system with a
good sensor array and a few well stationed SDBs out at about 50 dias. would
be pirate proof to all but a AHL class pirate making a full scale attack and
short of a really improbable mutiny that is not going to happen.

You win.  Pirate don\'t work in defended systems.

Funny you should mention the Gazelle; The text in Traders and Gunboats
(Supplement 7 of the LBBs) indicated that the layout of decks in the
Gazelle was *specifically* designed to seperate the enlisted crew from the
officers and provide the officers with a defensable bridge area in the
event of a mutiny.

Comments of others aside, and other factors affecting piracy
notwithstanding, I don\'t think its difficult for an undercrewed ship to
operate.  Like the sailing ships of old, military vessels are heavily
overcrewed due to the needs of combat and the desire for extra coverage for
watches and such.  If procedures are changed, maintenance schedules allowed
to slip, etc, a vessel like a Gazelle could be run with only 4 crewmembers
(out of 12) for most of the time (I\'m thinking two watchstanders, one in
engineering, one on the bridge, in rotating 8 or 12 hour shifts).

A British Frigate in the West Indies mutinied in the late 1700s over the
behavior of their captain (described in _The Black Ship_ I can\'t recall the
vessels name).  They did not turn pirate, but they turned themselves in to
a Spainish port, where some stayed awhile, but most dispersed themselves to
the four winds, some even returning home to England, several signed on
privateers or pirates, many went to America, and many simply were not heard
of again.  All the ones we know about were eventually hung.  Some, however,
seem to have successfully mutinied.

I believe that of the 130 or so on board, 30-50 were "active" mutineers,
60-80 were "passive participants" who obeyed orders of the mutineers once
the killing was over, and the remainder were either killed and thrown
overboard or just thrown overboard.  Several asked that they be considered
prisoners of war when they arrived in the Spainish port.  I think that with
treatment of the more professional Imp Navy personnel you would expect many
fewer to participate or allow a mutiny to occur, so I would not expect an
Imperial Navy vessel much larger than a Gazelle to be subject to a mutiny.

Other navies (local navies with SDBs) might be different.

Now, a British Frigate in 1800 could not, in the end, escape the British
Navy and remain on Earth, so there is not really a good analogy to an
Imperial Navy ship near an open border, like the Vargr Extents or the
Trojan Reach, where many local nation-states would pay nicely for a
Gazelle.  On the other paw, The Imperial Navy would do it\'s damndest (like
the RN) to hunt down and kill every last perpetrator of a mutiny in hopes
that this would discourage imitators.

In any case there is that reference to mutiny in LBB Supp. 7 which even
prompted a *design change* on a common Impy Navy ship.

Yeah, Traveller ships in all versions draw *way* too much power.

As tough as it would be to do, I\'d vote for 1.

No, I don\'t think we could get the power requirements down to
*realistic* levels, but we could (and should) lower them to more
reasonable ones. As for weapons, of course, they are going to be
*very* power hungry, and that shouldn\'t change. Ships with beam
weapons are going to need big fusion engines. OTOH, we don\'t have run
those big fusion engines at full power 24 hours a day do we? Well, it
*seems* like we always have, but I\'ve never thought that was very
reasonable.

As a mind experiment, let\'s say a 100 dton Type S Scout has an 80MW
fusion engine that it can throttle back to 5% of maximum output, so it
will always be producing 4MW while it\'s running. 

When it is drifting through space with minimal life support, using
passive sensors and maintaining only a trickle charge to the drives or
weapons, let\'s say, it *requires* only 2 MW\'s. So maybe it turns off
the fusion engine and runs off of stored power (fuel cells, batteries,
powercells, etc) only occasionally powering the engine back up to
recharge the batteries, or, if your TU won\'t allow for turning fusion
engines on and off like gasoline engines (I wouldn\'t allow *quite*
that much leeway ;), runs the fusion engine at it\'s lowest possible
level (4MW) it can. Combined with a little stealthing shouldn\'t that
drop the range of detection *way* down?

Now, if our Scout uses it\'s drives, active sensors, or *heaven forbid*
it\'s weapons, it will increase it\'s power consumption, and have to
stoke the fusion engine up to higher levels. Suddenly, it\'s a "hotter"
object visible on sensors at a longer range, but not necessarily from
every direction. 

If the power is going mainly to the drives, and the drives dispose of
*most* of the extra energy in one direction..aft, then our Scout\'s
detection level might not go up much in any direction except from the
rear. 

IMO, active sensors should be like spotlights, in that where ever the
ship aims them it can resolve a target much better, but is also much
easier to detect. 

Beam weapons are a different case. I suspect they will never be all
that efficient, so a lot of the power they consume will have to be
dealt with separately. Putting special high-temp radiators on their
turrets, in their bays, and around their spinal mounts is probably the
best way to handle them, too.  In any case, a ship using beam weapons
should light up like a Christmas Tree, but that doesn\'t bother me in
the least. Once the firing starts all bets are off anyway.

I\'ve been experimenting on and off with rewriting gurps sensors in a way which
made more sense than what\'s in the standard rules; I\'m not very sure of all my
numbers, but I decided to post this so comments can be made -- so please, make
comments ;).  Much of the issue here was some straightforward reality checks --
I wanted to make it so you can see nearby stars, while spotting a person from a
mile away is pretty difficult even if you know where to look.

Content-Type: TEXT/plain; CHARSET=US-ASCII
Content-Description: sensor.rules.gurps

I can\'t make too many promises about the accuracy of these tables, they 
are largely an attempt to generate sane results from the game system,
particularly in making sure that nearby stars aren\'t invisible, while a
person a mile away is hard to see.  Ranges are based on the standard range
tables, but extended to ranges which might be interesting in space.

1)  Converting Sensor Stats for these rules:
    If scan is 0-20, do not adjust.
    If scan is 20-36, halve and add 10 (round normally).
    If scan is 37+, divide by 3 and add 16 (round normally).
    Note that these are atmospheric scan values -- GT lists space scan
    values, which are 6 higher.  Subtract the +6 for space before converting.
    For reference, eyes have scan 10.  The relevant GT sensors are:
    Cockpit/10: passive (29/2+10)=25, active(33/2+10)=27, radscan(29/2+10)=25
    Cockpit/12: passive (31/2+10)=26, active(34/2+10)=27, radscan(31/2+10)=26
    Basic/10: passive (32/2+10)=26, active(35/2+10)=28, radscan(31/2+10)=26
    Basic/12: passive (32/2+10)=26, active(36/2+10)=28, radscan(35/2+10)=28
    Command/10: passive (33/2+10)=27, active(36/2+10)=28, radscan(32/2+10)=26
    Command/12: passive (35/2+10)=28, active(37/3+16)=28, radscan(38/3+16)=29

2)  Determining \'signature\'
*   Visual signature is equal to size modifier, plus chameleon surface.  In
    space, the black paint used in stealth coatings acts as a chameleon 
    surface -- subtract (TL-4) for basic, (TL-2) for radical.  Basic black
    paint reduces signature by 3.  A reflective or white surface adds 2.
*   Radar signature uses the normal computations and _halves_ them -- thus,
    base value is (size/2), subtract (TL-4)/2 for basic, (TL-4) for radical.
    For convenience, assume Lidar uses the Radar signature.  Note that a
    ship currently _using_ active sensors has a signature of (scan-TL) 
    and can be detected by a radscanner.
*   IR signature uses either the size modifier of the vehicle, _or_ a 
    function of power consumption and expected waste heat; this number is
    usually significantly greater (and is, in fact, probably higher than
    the numbers I use).  In any case, emissions cloaking reduces this,
    by (TL-4)/2 for basic, (TL-4) for radical.  The major power users on
    a ship are as follows:
    Artificial Gravity: 1 MW per 50 spaces or fraction thereof.
    Jump Drive: 10 MW per unit of J-drive.  Not usually very relevant, but
        important if a ship exits jump and then goes cold.
    Manuever Drive: 1 MW per 10 tons thrust.
    Weapons Fire: 16 MW for TL 10 laser, 18 for TL 12; 400 MW for bay
        PAW/meson, 19000 for spinal PAW/meson.
    Add up power consumption: signature is +8 for 1 MW, +9 for 2 MW, +10
        for 5 MW, and +3 per *10.  In situations where a ship\'s signature
        _changes_, IR signature will drop by 1 per 10 minutes (2/turn); it
        will rise essentially immediately (<1 turn).  Add +1 to IR signature
        per TL below 10 -- lower tech engines are less efficient (these
        numbers assume about 10% heat emissions).  A human has a base 
        emitted signature of +0.
    Example: a TL 10 merchant (size +8) has around 600 tons thrust (60 MW)
        and 4 MW for artificial gravity.  Signature is +13; drops to +9 if
        not using thrust, +8 if all major power shut off.
    Example 2: a TL 10 400tn raider (size +9) has 6000 tons thrust (600 MW)
        and 8 MW for artificial gravity, but radical EM cloaking.  Signature
        is +10 with drive active, +4 with artificial gravity online,
        +3 with all major power shut off.
*   Natural Objects: generally speaking, the size modifier of a natural
    object should be the negative of a range modifier equal to its diameter,
    +2 (natural objects are generally spherical).   Normal modifiers apply;
    signature will usually be within a point of the size modifier.
    A star has a visual signature of 76-1.2*absolute magnitude (70 for
    sol).

3)  Signature of \'Events\':
    Certain short-term events are reasonably likely to be spotted, most 
    notably weapons fire and jumping.
    An energy weapon firing has a signature based on its power output --
    use 10* its normal power requirement and compute based on that.
    Specifically, this works out to +12 for lasers, +16 for bay weapons,
    +21 for spinal weapons.
    Nuclear weapons have a signature of +14 for 0.001 kT, and +3 per *10.
    A starship jumping insystem has a signature of 17 + 3log10(# of J);
    this works out to 5+(size*1.5), +1 for J-3 or higher, and lasts
    for a minute (giving +2 detection).

4)  Detection Process:
    If this is initial detection, simply add up range, signature, and all
    relevant modifiers; if the total is less than zero double the result.
    Use this as a modifier for a sensor operations roll.

    If this is _not_ initial detection, use the above process, but you can
    usually assume that the bonus for field of view will be +5.

    Special case: resolving the shape of an object is very different from
    detection, at least in space -- it is, in fact, sufficiently different
    to warrant a completely different detection process.  For resolving the
    shape, apply _only_ the following modifiers:
        Time (maximum +2), Focus (maximum +2), Target Size, Range,
        Intervening Atmosphere, -2 if using thermal sensors or lidar, -6
        if using imaging radar.

    Special case: objects which are quite near each other.  Treat as per
    resolving the shape of an object, but use the size modifier for the
    distance between the objects.

    What you roll will determine what information you get:
    Success by 0-2: detection.
        For optical sensors, gives direction and relative brightness.
        For radar sensors, gives range and apparent signature.
        For thermal sensors, gives direction and relative brightness.
        For shape resolution, gives size and general shape.
    Success by 3-5: recognition
        For optical sensors, as above plus exact color.
        For radar sensors, as above plus exact velocity.
        For thermal sensors, as above plus temperature.
        For shape resolution, gives sufficient information to identify a
            class of vehicle or entity.  Battle damage will be visible, etc.
    Success by 6+: identification
        For optical/thermal sensors, spectral analysis may be performed, and
            a time-based brightness curve generated.  For objects which have
            known spectral lines, velocity to/away (to within 1 km/sec)
            may be determined.
        For radar sensors, a time-based brightness profile may be generated,
            allowing determinations about rotation and some sorts of shape
            computation.
        for shape resolution, gives sufficient information to identify a
            particular vehicle or person.

4)  Determine Range.  This is an extended table of range modifiers, optimized
    for space.

Initial Detection Roll:
    Add up all modifiers; if < 0, _double_ (this is a hack -- an expert
    operator (skill 18) shouldn\'t have 10x the detection range of a moderate
    skill (skill 12) operator.  This reduces it to about 3x, but the expert
    will be much more reliable).  Roll electronics/sensor operation at this
    modifier.

        normal darkness modifiers.
    (2) if has an emitted signature, give +1 if = size-1, +2 if (size),
        +4 if (size+1), +6 if greater than size+1; this is in addition to

Target Behavior (only applies to initial detection)
    Target moving against backdrop      +2      +2      +2
        Means \'moving by normal resolution of sensor in one turn\'.  To
        determine this, take (range mod)-(size mod of distance)+scan.
        For even the lowest-grade space sensors this means that an 
        object moving at orbital velocity around a planet an AU away
        appears to be moving, so this modifier usually applies to detecting
        ships.

    (2) modifier applies to signature based on size, but not signature
        based on power consumption; max -6 if object is warm enough for
        humans to survive.
    
Simplifications for space combat:
    In general, for space combat purposes, you will have a +12 for IR/radar
    in space, a +4 for turn length, a -2 for 360 scan, and a +2 for a
    moving object (negating this is quite hard, though not impossible), for
    a total of +16 to scan; this gives a TL 10 basic bridge a 42 passive, a
    TL 12 command bridge a 44.  This allows a ship which is mostly powered
    down to evade detection at reasonable ranges, but is significantly 
    better range than what GT normally gives.

Example:
    For a human to spot alpha centaurus (signature +71, range -97), at night:
    +10 scan, +71 signature, -97 range, +14 terrain, -1 atmosphere, total 
    -3, doubled to -6.  Probably not going to spot it randomly.  However,
    scan a 30 degree arc (+2) and spend 15 seconds (+1) and you\'ve got 
    a pretty good chance.

Example 2: for a merchant (scan 26 passive, net 42) to detect a pirate
    with no drives, but running artificial gravity (signature +4) at half
    the jump limit (2 light-seconds, range -51): total -5, doubled to -10,
    virtually zero chance.  The pirate, meanwhile, has a TL 10 command 
    bridge with scan 27, net 43, target signature +13, net +5 -- no problem.
    If the pirate kicks in his drives signature jumps to +10, for a +1 to
    scan -- depends on the alertness of the operator.

In the case of the RN of WWII many reservists would be very good at basic
shiphandling, because after leaving the Navy (and joining the reserves)
they went into related jobs - fishing, costal trading, etc.

In the 3I this could well be the case, as well, with the reservists having
jobs on shuttles and in-system shipping. This means that while they may be
a bit rusty with the guns, etc their other skills will be pretty good.

I am too. I thought it was my mail program, especially as I chaecked it

Being possible dosen\'t mean that it is or isn\'t there. I think too many
people confuse possible/impossible with established/established not to be.
I think that is partly due to the fact that they are interrelated. But they
are not the same thing.

If something is impossible and the game author says it dosen\'t exist then
there is no problem.

If something is possible and the author says it exists then it exists.

If it is possible, but the author says it dosen\'t exist, then it dosen\'t
exist (but see below).

The problems all arise when something is impossible or almost so and
the author nevertheless says it exist and when something is inevitable
or nearly so and the author says it dosen\'t exist. That\'s when we get
all the discussions.

No, I forgot the most frequent source of controversy: When something is
possible and the author in one place says it exists and in another says
it dosen\'t... ;-)

[By \'author\' I mean the collective writers of all canonical material. I\'m
not dumping on Marc].

That wasn\'t why I wrote what I did. What prompted my comment was the way
many people (including myself from time to time, no doubt) make assumptions
based on the way things are now, assuming that that, for example the ratio
of armour to weapons will follow current trends. This is ignoring the fact
that most of these trends or ratios have been different in the past, often
for most of history, and could well (in fact IMO will probably be different
in the future).

What I\'m trying to say, I guess, is that the late 20th century is a lousy
place to be looking for examples to support any particular view on the OTU
in the abscence of any real canon.

Ouch! You mean that the discussion happened before last years one? Has

Acrobat is 130 GBP, which is cheap compared to the 400 Office 98, and
300 Illustrator 7.

However, you can get most of the functionality of acrobat by using Adobe
Illustrator, which produces pdf files, and allows you to open them back up.
You just can\'t optimise them (not in AI7 anyway, v8 might be better). Okay,
I know that would mean converting from Corel... I was lucky and got both my
copies of Photoshop 4 and Illustrtor 7 together for less than the price of
a single package...

The best thing is that the reader is free, and multi-platform.  (Only
downside is that you don\'t seem to be able to scale to fit a page to your
paper size under Windoze, something which the Mac version does happily.)

I agree. If you want cat and mouse (or \'hide and seek with bazookas\' which
is how Frank Chadwick described it IIRC) you should play 2300\'s Starcruiser
(I wish they\'d published a bugfixed version of the Naval Architect\'s Manual
though).

Traveller has always been giant slugfests at capital ship level - like the
big fleet action descriptions in Lensman, or Azimov, or Banks. The nearest
literary thing to both I can think of is Hamilton\'s _Reality Dysfunction /
Neutronium Alchemist_ books where KKMs and det lasers are standard.

Cat and Mouse only applies for really small ships....

You\'re right. I can\'t understand how I missed that. I looked it over
specifically to find it and still missed it. My brain must have tuned it
out. The human mind is a funny thing... and I don\'t mean funny ha ha.

>"At their lowest level, Imperial ships are organized into squadrons (from

Apparently I\'m not the only one whose brain tunes out things it dosen\'t want
to notice. Later in the same line you quote it says "(usually three to 10
squadrons per fleet)". Usually. Usually dosen\'t mean always. So the 50 ship
fleets could have unusual numbers of fleets. For that matter, although the
text says that squadrons at most have 10 similar ships, we have one canonical
example of oversized squadrons, so that isn\'t as set in stone as you think,
either.

That\'s your opinion, and you\'re welcome to it. My arguments are based on the
assumption that it is canonical.

>The econ stuff was obviously not thought through the background.  

Oh, you noticed that, did you? Only it is the other way around. That part of
the background that has the Imperium, an interstellar state surrounded by
several hostile states of the same order of magnitude as itself spending
about one third of what Canada does today on it\'s defense, is the part that
wasn\'t thought through. The figures in _Striker_ were thought through (well,
maybe not thought through, just taken from the real world). That\'s the true
problem with _Striker_ and _TCS_. Not that they say something inconsistent
with other parts of the canon, but that the other parts of the canon are
implausible. If I thought a defense budget of 0.5% made sense then I\'d be
the first to advocate lowering the _Striker_ figures to match the other
parts of the canon. I addressed that very point in another part of the
same post. Maybe your brain tuned it out?

Well, that settles it, I guess. You don\'t think they are credible. In that
case those of us who thinks they are credible should obviously realize that
your opinion is more valuable than ours and shut up. I see it all so clearly
now.

I suppose it would be too much to expect your Illustrious Savantcy to provide
us stupid morons with credible figures to base our future calculations on?

In other words, Gary, if you don\'t think the _Striker_ figures are credible,
then you obviously must have some figures that you think are. I mean, I can\'t
for a moment imagine that the only reason you don\'t think them credible is
that that would force you to acknowledge that the subsection of the Traveller
background you like has a few glitches here and there.

>It\'s obvious GDW didn\'t use Striker or TCS (or anything even remotely
>resembling Pocket Empires) in creating the background. 

Obviously not. If they had, the problem wouldn\'t exist.

>All of them are made to be playable *games* (specificially games for
>players to have pet "pocket empires" and polities and go to war w/ each
>other) and to not simulate "reality" (such as it is) for the OTU.

All of them were made to be playable games based on the Traveller background.
You may as well claim that each of the adventures were made to be a playable
adventure and not to reflect reality "such as it is" for the OTU. That rather
misses the point. The true value of the Traveller Universe to me is that I
can mine it for background material for my personal TU. As such the historical
background and adventures are important to me. And it is especially important
to me that they are mutually consistent. And that is why, as important as the
background is, the underlying rules and mechanics IMO are even more important,
because if they are in order, they will force _future_ Traveller authors
to produce stuff that is also compatible. Otherwise we get one author having
four KINUNIR class ships defending a whole subsector while the neighboring
is defended by several BatRons. We get planets with 50 inhabitants buying
50,000 T monitors, we get low population empires giving multi-billion empires
a hard time, etc. And, in the present case, we get authors who write an
adventure involving small mercenary actions calculating a world\'s military
forces from _Striker_ and getting one result and authors writing a smuggling
adventure getting the same figures from _FFW_ and getting two different
results.

Maybe you think that keeping a mismatched puzzle piece, thus ensuring that
the picture can never be complete, is preferable to losing one or two of
your favorite pieces. That\'s a matter of opinion. We disagree. Fine. But
when you berate me for advocating trimming some of the pieces to make them
fit on the grounds that a) They fit, only I am too stupid to realize that,
or b) they belong to a different picture, then I come close to losing my
patience with you.

It was a system in Pretoria/Deneb IIRC. Thanks for reminding me of that. It
is a datum about the Imperial Navy that I had forgotten. But it does show
that some ships are laid up outside the depots. So does _Arrival Vengeance_
BTW.
My own opinion is that there are a lot of ships in the Depots, but more
outside them.

	Why, I wouldn\'t know how to think about an interstellar society 
*without* lots of prejudice going on. Some examples OTMH:

	1) "Capital-guys": People from the mainworlds will always have 
prejudices against the "colonists" in other worlds. In the same way, 
citizens from the startowns will tend to have prejudices against 
people from the "countryside". And it works the other way. When the 
players leave the startown and head to another part of the planet 
during an adventure in an important, not-a-backwater world, iamgine 
their surprise when the inhabitants regard them as "stupid 
starpeople"... but it is logical, since the startown citizens treat 
them the same way.
	So, there will always be possibilities for a group of traders 
willing to land in some location of the world other than the 
starport... you know, why should we pay our taxes just to support 
those startowners whims?

	2) Races. Almost in any planet where you have a sizeable racial 
minority, economic problems may cause an increase in 
racism. Thus, if you visit ten such planets, you MUST see at least 
one case (and that is optimistic). But, which hi-pop world is not 
going to have a sizeable racial minority? A Vargr player arrives in a 
Hipop world, and suddenly he realizes that the local population 
accuses the Vargr minority of all the planet\'s problems. He will be 
actively harrassed, in some cases. A nice plot is always to help some 
members of a minority to escape their foreordained destiny as 
scapegoats for some Big Guy. Specially, when the minority has its own 
prejudices and is just looking for a bunch of stupid humans to accuse 
instead... either way, the Big Guy turns into a Big Problem for the 
rest of the campaign.

	3) Nobles. Do you really think that an imperial noble is going to be 
admired by the populace in any republican, democratic world? Of 
course you would always have examples like the democratic US, where 
the courts of *foreign* kings are much admired (<quickly 
ducking for cover>), but if you are a convinced democrat, one thing 
is admitting to form part of a distant Imperium that does not meddle 
in your planet\'s affairs, and a much different thing is to have to do 
a favor to that Imperial Knight who believes he is something just 
because he can prove his father was a Baron... so, allow one player 
to be a Knight. And, them, make him realize that it is not always 
wise to say so at the first opportunity.

A Soviet destroyer or cruiser attempted mutiny in the Baltic. They
*almost* made it to Swedish waters. And there are *strong* suspicions
about that Soviet sub that ran aground near Seden in the mid 80s. 

In the case of the surface ship, it was the *officers* mutinying (which
technically makes it "barratry"). This is *far* easier to get away with
once you set it up. It\'s just that in any society where the officers
would *consider* such a thing, it\'s gonna be hard to set up.

Pournelle has written (or is still writing) "Return of Space Viking"
(working title). He hasn\'t put a lot of effort into it recently since
it\'s not terribly salable right now. Maybe in another 10 years or so
(which is about when Piper will be "rediscovered" again). 

There\'s also a sequel to "Great King\'s War" (which was a sequel to
"Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen") written, but unsold. The editors don\'t
think they\'ll sell, so the manuscripts just sit there.

I remembered your comment while out book shopping today. Upon checking
the notes inside the few Weber books I could find (they sell fast!) I
think I found out *why* "In Death Ground" is the way it is.

According to the blurbs in one of the other books, that series is based
on a computer wargame. No *wonder* it\'s solid battles.

I\'d say you should. You\'ll spoil a few things in the books you haven\'t
read.

Close enough? Usual rules for increased skill at the cost of increased cost

Radio the base (use low power). They send out a tug. The tug uses mass
drivers. Load them with ice, rock, whatever. Fling it away at high
speed. The Isp isn\'t the greatest, but it\'s low signature and rugged. 

In fact, you can load the "buckets" on the mass driver with *powdered*
rock/slag/ice. This makes the exhaust spread out fairly fast. That way
if a later ship pops up in the path of your exhaust, it won\'t get hurt
(unless it pops up *really* close).

While *some* power requirements *are* out of line (communications, for

You keep missing the point. If your ship\'s systems use 100 MW then you
*have* to radiate 100 MW of "waste heat". That\'s in *addition* to any
inefficiencies in the production of the power being used. 

Waste heat is what happens to the energy *after* it has been used for
its intended purpose. 

A laser or particle beam will carry away energy in a form *other* than
waste heat. And to some extent, so does radio/radar/lidar. But the
power used by *all* other ship\'s systems winds up as waste heat *after*
performing its job. (Actually, so does the power going into the weapons
and radio, etc. It\'s just that they turn into waste heat elsewhere)

So if the manuever drive uses 50 MW, then it has to radiate away 50 MW
of *heat*. And any attempt to recover energy from that will merely
degrade the performance of the drive.

They don\'t even run *that* hot. Since the goal is to keep the inside of
the Shuttle at room temp, that means that the radiators are at room
temp or only a bit above. 

Remember, only in designs where you need to play games with stealth
will the radiators *not* be the lowest temp part of the system! To get
them *not* to be the lowest temp part requires running active
refrigeration, which greatly complicates things.

Also, they aren\'t all that "dinky" they cover the *entire* inner
surface of the bay doors.

Sunlight loading is a problem, but not a major one. Remember that
equilibrium temp at 1 AU is below freezing. The big problem is that the
crew, life support, and electronics pump out a *lot* of heat.

I kinda figure that the really high power systems have their own
radiators that operate at very high temps, partly because the extra
efficiency gained by having the "sink" end of things at a lower temp
isn\'t worth the increased area. 

So the power plant may well have small radiators that are *literally*
white hot. After all, that\'s only about 3000 K, and with the "source"
end at several million K, the diff between 300 K and 3000 K isn\'t worth
the hassle.

Weapons and possibly thrusters would maybe have red-hot radiators. And
life support would have ice-cold radiators. But the majority of the
signature would be from the red-hot and white-hot ones.

Actually, you can do the same thing if you restrict the really high

No, try a setup where long range transport is little used (with high
tech communications, you don\'t need to move *people* around very fast,
and materials aren\'t in a big rush). And where folks are much more into
"appropriate technology". 

Sort of like the situation in the "Tinker" culture under the Peace
Authority in Vinge\'s "The Peace War". 

*No* heavy industry. But "cottage" electronics and related fields give
you a super internet, as well as all sorts of sustainable *very* high
tech, but low volume, low power gizmos. 

Picture a culture with a planetwide comm and computer net, much of it
using dedicated fiber lines (ie no signature worth mentioning), long
range transport mostly wind, water and muscle powered, with higher tech
vehicles scattered around, but limited to stuff that *can* be
maintained without a heavy industrial base.

So you\'d have sailing ships, dirigibles, some aircraft, some CG
vehicles (after all electronics *can* be maintained with "light"
industry, and the structural stuff can be kept to "blacksmith" level.
The "engines" are the hard part). 

Likewise, large "heavy" weapons would be uncommon, but personal and
"squad" level weapons would be as good as any in the galaxy.

Basicly, think of the tech as limited to what a "garage" level machine
shop (or electronics fab) can handle. With several of each in every
village. 

Population centers would be limited to village/small town. And there\'d
be a *few* places building larger items. 

Such a setup could maintain a very high tech level. They\'d just be
*lightly* industrialized. They might be able to produce a starship of
as much as a few hundred tons. But that\'d require doing some tooling up
at the larger towns, and the rate of constructiion would be low. But
the smaller the item, the easier it\'d be to build locally.

As far as *small* items, treat them like Afghani gunsmiths. Hand a
local "techsmith" a weapon, or electronics package, and in a week or
two, he\'s likely to hand you back *two*, and you may have trouble
determining which is the original. 

ps. I know it\'s not as *efficient* to have a "backyard" size chip
foundry. But it *is* doable. We just don\'t have the incentive. Another
culture might be willing to go with the higher costs as a valid
trade-off for keeping things locally supportable.

It\'d be a *weird* culture from our point of view. And it\'d be *damned*
hard to conquer. Probably more trouble than it\'s worth. Which may be
the whole idea.

As others have told you, the Imperial Reserve Fleets are not that kind of
reserves. The term is confusing and I suggest using \'colonial\' instead.
Colonial fleets are raised and supported at the subsector level and not
stationed outside their subsectors except in emergencies whereas the
regular fleets are raised Imperium-wide and stationed wherever there is
need of them. That\'s the only difference. You can have as long and
illustrious a full-time career in the colonial fleets as you can in the
regular. And the same goes for the planetary navies, for that matter.
There does not even seem to be any difference in your chances of getting
a particular mission nor of getting decorations and promotions, though I
admit that that is rather implausible and should propably be considered
a misleading effect of the CGS. 

Back when I was playing in a TCS campaign I did talk to my Referee about
just that kind of reserves, and we worked out several different levels of
preparedness for my ships. Unfortunately I can\'t recall the specifics and
my files are on some floppies somewhere. The lowest was mothballed (pumped
full of inert gas and stuck inside asteroids). That had an initial cost, I
forget how much (1%?), but no 1% per year upkeep. Reactivating took a
complete refit (25% of original cost). The 1% per year was sticking them in
a parking orbit with a caretaker crew and giving them an annual maintenance.
That needed the 10% refit from canon rules to get it going. Maintaining
reserves like you are thinking of (except they spent one month instead of
two weeks each year) cost, I think, 2%. They could be activated without a
refit, but still needed time to train a crew. Having  a full-time crew
working six identical ships two months each in rotation cost 4% but meant
that they could be activated almost overnight, with a 1/6th trained crew as
cadre for each.

It dosen\'t matter how they work IMTU. What I am trying to discuss is how

I\'m ignoring the two non-Piper books, and sticking with the three books
by Piper. BTW, the third Piper book when it was finally unearthed
(several years after those "sequels" to the first two) makes it pretty
likely that the Fuzzies are native (for that matter, certian biological
details in the first two books made it rather likely).

We actually have two *interesting* results in the third Fuzzy book.
You see, as part of the trial of the "fuzzy fagin" people from book 2,
it becomes necessary to show that Fuzzies can lie, otherwise it won\'t
be possible to veridicate them. 

Trying to teach Fuzzies to lie almost drives the human pyschs nuts, and
does come rather close to threatening the stability of a couple of
Fuzzies.

Well, I think they\'d be a great addition to Traveller. Of course, the
legal situation makes them unlikely to ever be official, but we can
have fun. I once started to work them up for my D&D campaign. Picture a
party of adventurers suddenly surrounded by a bunch of 2-foot tall
Fuzzies bearing the sort of "choppo-diggos" shown on the book covers.
:-) 

Oh yes, the original Hoka stories by Poul Anderson & Gordon R. Dickson
have been re-released ("Hoka! Hoka! Hoka!"). They are another race fit
to drive characters nuts. Having both Fuzzies *and* Hokas in the same
campaign might be a bit much. :-)

Getting back to Fuzzies though, I can see them mostly winding up in the
Scouts. They\'d make a great partner on a "one man" Scout. I\'m not sure
how they\'d do in Army or Marines. Navy is another possibility as is
Merchant and "Rogue".

For a truly *silly* bit of cross-threading, it occurs to me that a
standard "Free Trader" or "Fat Trader" could *easily* hold an entire
Fuzzy *clan*. Maybe the Fuzzies are the "Space Gypsies". It\'d be a
*lot* more practical for them, given that a 2 foot Fuzzy requires
1/27th the space, air and food that a 6 foot human does (actually,
given that they\'d need a higher metabolism to maintain body heat, even
*with* their fur we might want to double or even triple those figures).
With automated cargo handling (pretty much a given) their size wouldn\'t
be a handicap.

I also like the interesting possibilities during negotiations:

Captain: Yeek! {He expects us to think *this* junk is valuable?}
Steward: Yeek! {Well, we *do* have those synthetic sunstones we\'ve been
                trying to unload for the last year...}
Broker: Excuse me?
Captain: Sorry, we just saying you got much good stuff here.

:-)

Also, going by stuff from Piper\'s books I expect to see a lot of
Fuzzies in education and medicine (especially nursing and pysch rehab
work). 

Hey! That\'s it. Fuzzies in the Army/Marines are combat medics. They can
get to wounded more easily, and being small doesn\'t matter for most
first aid. 

They\'d do good in civilian rescue work too. They can get into places a
human can\'t, and they\'d be great for reassuring kids (how tend to get
into places adults can\'t). 

Other Fuzzy things to design:

.22 caliber "rifle" and "pistol".
??? caliber "heavy rifle"

I figure a .22 rifle and pistol would be normal weapons. The .22LR is
useful, and standard. I can\'t really think of any other round that
*could* be used in a "pistol" for them. A rifle in the same caliber (a
*very* cut down carbine) is still quite useful. 

The "heavy rifle" would be the Fuzzy equivalent of the 600 nitro or the
like. A standard caliber, but picked to be the heaviest that an
"average" Fuzzy can safely handle. Needed to keep them from becoming
"snacks" for the local lion equivalent. 

Fuzzy comm gear would be slightly non-standard (and more expensive)
mostly because it needs to be smaller and lighter *and* it needs to
have three "settings": normal audio, ultrasonic only, and both at once.

The ultrasound only would be useful for stealth operations. Normal only
would interoperate best with standard comm gear. And "both" would allow
for carrying on both normal and ultra communication at the same time.

<snicker>

I just had this *lovely* image pop into my head. A Fuzzy DI teaching a
survival course. During the portions of such training where you get
dumped in the wild to practice your skills, he\'s notorious for popping
up unexpectedly. Usually immediately after you\'ve done something
*stupid*. First indication you have is the Yeek! followed by some pithy
comment in pidgin (Fuzzies *can* speak proper Standard, they just don\'t
see the point except on formal occasions). 

"You think animal dumb? *Blind* animal see this is trap!"

"Oh! Maybeso you bait trap with self? Very smart... Not!"

This gives him quite a reputation, and is annoying as hell. On the
other hand, it does show that he\'s paying attention. :-)

How would this affect sensors. Could the plasma be used to fill up the 
pixels in a passive sensor and therefor help the ship hide in a combat 
situation where it has already been detected and the enemy has no active
sensors.

I wonder if we need a GTL "Gurps Tech List" for these technical 
issues? I suppose such a thing already exists on io.com/Pyramid, but
I\'m damned if I\'m going to pay money for the sake of helping improve
their design...

Anyway, for the background-limited case (which starship visible and
IR sensors are), sensitivity (in the sense of "faintest object that
can be detected") only goes up as the square root of the time you
spend looking. Hence to get a +3 in GURPS terms (target 3.3 times
further away and hence ten times dimmer) you need to scan 100 times
longer, not 10-15; to get a +6 you need to scan 10,000 times longer.
The field-of-view modifiers are complicated too...
The human eye, on the other hand, is not background-limited (and
short exposures from visible-light sensors might not quite be
BG-limited either). It\'s hard to make a system that models both the
scaling laws for human eyes (which can\'t really integrate, have
aberration-limited resolution, and moderately low efficiency) and
staring infrared arrays hooked up to big telescopes...

    'body' => 'Luriani Subcultures

Two distinct subcultures exist within Luriani society: the Verasti Dtareen and 
the Mmarislusant. Both of these subcultures are the result of the incorporation 
of non-Luriani humans into Luriani society. The Verasti Dtareen are the 
descendants of Admiral Martinezs fleet and Solomani settlers from the Rule of 
Man era. Whilst the Mmarislusant are the descendants of the Vilani colonists 
planted amongst the Luriani during the Vilani occupation.

The Mmarislusant

The Luriani word Mmarislusant literally translates as victims of history. During 
the Ziru Sirka numerous Vilani were settled on the Luriani worlds in an attempt 
to assimilate the Luriani. These attempts proved to be fruitless, but the 
colonists remained when the First Protectorate was formed and presented a 
unique problem for the new state. The solution adopted is an interesting 
example of the Luriani Code of Honour. While the Luriani bore (and continued to 
bear even into the late 3rd Imperium) a grudge against the Ziru Sirka, the 
Luriani could not hold these individual Vilani responsible for the actions of their 
government. Similarly, the Tenets of Hospitality required that while they were 
not regarded as citizens, they had to be treated as honoured guests. Thus, the 
Protectorate went to considerable lengths to ensure that these Vilani were able 
to continue their lives as before. State funded Vilani schools were established 
and great efforts were made to encourage the Vilani to retain their distinct 
identity. As a result the Mmarislusant preserve much of the original culture and 
language of the Ziru Sirka and are closer to it than most supposedly traditional 
Vilani elsewhere.

Over time, the Mmarislusant came to be valued members of Luriani society, 
well respected for their bureaucratic and diplomatic skills. In 1372 citizenship 
was extended to them and they were gradually incorporated into the 
administrative structure of the Protectorate. By the founding of the Second 
Protectorate in 8, they had come to regard themselves as members of Luriani 
society and had become an important part of government and corporate life 
within it. It is interesting to note that with the incorporation of the Protectorate 
into the Third Imperium, the Mmarislusant have resisted all efforts to reintegrate 
them into mainstream Vilani culture.

The Verasti Dtareen

The term Verasti Dtareen is usually translated as Terran Protectors or 
Protectors from Terra. Unlike the Mmarislusant the Verasti Dtareen were 
regarded as members of Luriani society from the founding of the First 
Protectorate. The Verasti Dtareen provided the Protectorate with the vital 
administrative skills required to manage an interstellar state. Initially they also 
formed the bulk of the Protectorates military forces. However, as the 
Protectorate evolved they were gradually replaced in this role by Luriani, but 
they came to form the administrative core of society, providing it with a stability 
and focus it had previously lacked.

The Verasti Dtareens culture is an intriguing fusion of Luriani and Solomani 
traditions. Exposure to the Luriani has resulted in their adoption of many Luriani 
cultural norms (such as group marriages and the Luriani Code of Honour). In 
many ways the Verasti Dtareen are a less extreme version of the Luriani. They 
are prone to displays of emotion that most Solomani would feel uncomfortable 
with, they are strongly drawn towards music and the arts, and they hold to the 
Luriani precepts of honour. However they are also expected to behave with far 
greater restraint than would be expected of a Luriani, and retain many cultural 
rituals from their Solomani heritage.

That would be, at a minimum, a violation of the Traveller trademark.

Umm... You are aware that the $15/year subscription to Pyramid is more than
a chance to improve SJG products, right?

In the three-odd months I\'ve been reading Pyramid on-line, I\'ve gotten
dozens of ideas for my game, decided to buy two products based on the
reviews, and been amused by John Kovalic\'s Murphy\'s Rules.

Hell, _Surpressed Transmission_ is worth the subscription cost alone.  Add
in that it\'s updated weekly, and you get a gaming magazine for 28 cents a
week!  I rarely even bother with the message boards, since I don\'t play
GURPS.

	Or that the IN has a large number of ships that are of a lower TL than
15!!

	Most people seem to assume that the entire IN is made up of TL 15
vessels, but this is not at all true (Book 5 High Guard) :"The Imperial Navy
may procure ships of up to TL15, although it also procures vessels at TL 10 thru
14".  As is very obvious from both HG and MT, lower TL ships are considerably
more expensive than thier higher tech counterparts.  But there is no TL
adjustment for the budgets.

	It is also difficult to build highly agile warships below TL15 (esp in MT)
At TL13-14, you need twice the space for a power plant as you would at
TL15...and it\'s 3x at 10-12.

	After seeing this post, I seem to remember having read this in the book "Sink

utilized my memories from having read 2 very good books:  The one mentioned
above (which was written from the RN perspective) and the book (whose title
escapes me at the moment) written by Baron von Mullenhiem-Rechberg, who was
the 4th Gunnery Officer and senior surviving officer.

	I do believe that an order was given to scuttle the ship...most likely just
as the combat began.  There was no doubt among the crew that this was a lost
battle from the get-go; this is confirmed by the German account.  An order to
scuttle would prevent the British from possibly boarding:  I realize this
statement seems somewhat silly from the perspective of gaining useful
info...but don\'t underestimate the value that raising the White Ensign on the
Bismarck would have had on public morale, esp since the Bismarck had days
earlier sank the pride of the RN!!

I think this may help....

                        Minutes per metric ton
Equipment Used          0-G     Vacc 1-G Air
Battle Dress (or equiv) 4       2       2
5 man in VaccSuits      4       3       3
5 man in clothes*       3       2       2
1 man with LRTP\'s       2       -       -
1 man w/Pallet Jacks**  -       3       2

If you suppose this is the time it gets to load/unload one pack of one
metric ton,
then you should simply multiply this time with the number of such a pack
(one-ton
weighted).

If the packs are less than one ton of weigth, then simply multiply the
time by the
fraction of weigth...

As i don\'t explain well, here goes an example:

Lets say you have 30 packs of 100 kg each, then it would take 5 men with
clothes in
1-G air :
2 minutes*30 packs* (100 kg/ 1000 kg) = 6 minutes to load/unload them.

I believe you can find this information in "Supplement 7 - Traders and 
Gunboats".

PS The cargo module size was 4 tons.

You\'re misinterpreting an ambiguous word. The reserves in Corridor are
the regular ships stationed in Corridor. What you call the mothball fleet
(ship in ordinary) is something else.

What I meant was that you have to start the run in before your intended

How did you get the higher initial speed if not by accelerating? And before
you cliam that you built up the speed before you jumped into the system,
that means your timing problem becomes even bigger.

A freshly arrived ship and one that is outbound is have very different

One explanation (not canonical, but compatible with canon) is that jumpspace
navigation lets you aim for a spot relative to any sufficiently large
gravity point source.
  
>Jump time = 168 hours +- 10%

Well, the rules differ slightly from version to version. Another version is
7 days +- 1 day.

>dia limit of any object over 1 mile.

I think that is right in at least one version of the rules (maybe more).
OTOH this effect is totally ignored in other versions. I don\'t think it
has ever been mentioned as part of the background events.

Sometimes they are and sometimes they\'re not. Subsector fleets are sometimes
used for both kinds of numbered fleet, both the regular and the colonial.
But in other cases it is used for that fleet which is raised and maintained
by the subsector, and that is the colonial or, as it is also sometimes
called, the Imperial Reserve fleet.

Right. Individual planets pay 30% of their military budget to the Imperium.
The subsector government retains half of that and turns over the other half
to the regular forces.

Certainly _Striker_ simplifies the matter. It says "roughly 30%" which
indicates that there may be variations in that figure or that it is not
exactly 30%. Maybe the true figure is 29% or 31%. My point is that it is
certainlynot going to be 5% or 10%.

>I\'m looking for a source other than striker to confirm the numbers.

Well, _TCS_ says Cr500 per citizen (which works out as 5% under my
assumptions) for the navy alone. So _Striker_ gives a lower figure than
TCS.

>I do not understand this comment.

Sorry. That was a bit snide. What I should have said was: The 10% maintenance
figure is a simplified one that applies to a whole navy consisting of ships
of all ages. It\'s an average. So although old ships surely cost more than 10%
to maintain, the newest ships of the navy will cost correspondingly less to
maintain.

Also, the actual physical maintenance seems to be the least of the 10%
figure. Far more goes to ship replacement, personnel, pensions, support
structures, bases, training camps, etc. So the difference is propably
not all that great.

Let\'s see. HMS Rodney had a battleship\'s guns (16"), a BB\'s armor, and
a BB\'s speed  for the time (21 knots). I know of no historian that
would consider Rodney anything but a battleship. 

The same goes for Bismarck. She had the guns, the armor, and better
speed than a contemporary BB. Just because she had more speed than the
ones before her doesn\'t disqualify her as a BB, any more than Prince
of Wales or North Carolina wasn\'t a BB.

Not really.  The only list I\'m aware of is a general one, it gets

and replying.  That\'s *supposed* to change..we\'ll see.

No, you shouldn\'t pay for the subscription for that reason.  Not
unless you *want* to, of course. ;->

What Doug said.  There is a lot of value here, whether you play
GURPS or not.  In the last few months, there have been two *very*
good Traveller articles.  The archives have a number of general
adventures that can be adapted to Traveller...one that really
interested me was aimed at a 1930\'s adventure in Central America,
but set it on a jerkwater planet in the Deep (or Marches) and it
would work just as well.  Then there are the product reviews, news
and...

Well, almost.  ;-> Ken Hite\'s column is good, but I\'m not sure I\'d
pay $15 a year *just* for that.  However, it does contribute to the
worth of the subscription.

I don\'t bother with the message boards because I can\'t read and
reply offline.  ;->

I never make it to the weekly "chats" because of my work schedule,
but I enjoy reading the transcripts.  You know there have been
several chats about non-SJG games, the new Star Trek game comes to
mind.  I bet SJG would be happy to arrange conferences where
Travellerites could discuss things Traveller.  Maybe Marc could tell
us about T5 at one.

Hum, well speaking as a total layman...I know you couldn\'t put
Traveller in the title, but does it require a license to produce a
fanzine *about* a trademarked game?  If the fanzine acknowledged
trademarks and didn\'t use copywrited material, wouldn\'t it be legal

Leif,

There are 2 possible places you could have seen the 400 sdt "Fat" Trader,
either in Suppliment 7 Traders and Gunboats, or the Traveller Adventure,
large format book. The standard cargo container is 3.85 tons and typically
measures 6 x 3 x 3 meters. I have a page of these containers (suitable for
cut out and use in a 1/2 inch scale) included in my Cargo Master class Free
Trader deck plans found at my web site (address in sig.)

It depends a bit.  At the least, is smells of trademark dilution via
sponsorship confusion.  I.E., it might appear to be sponsored
and the consumer might think its official or authorized by the
trademark owning party.  Thats called trading on the goodwill
of the mark holder, exactly what trademark is about preventing.

Having said that, very, very clear disclaimers might help.
As does the non-profit nature.  But in the end, its going to depend
on the exact nature of the fanzine.  If it was all Traveller stuff, its
probably going to violate trademark without a license.

IMO, better in this situation to get Mr. Miller\'s blessing than
to try to get forgiveness later.

This raises some interesting ideas. If you think about it for a
while, it makes the idea of popping in-system at only 100D from
Mainworld kind of unlikely (a good thing, IMHO).

I did a Q&D sketch at http://www.rt66.com/~merrick/jumpglop.html to
show what I mean (easier to draw than try to do it in ascii :-)

The bottom line is that there are many times when you might well
have to spend a few days in normal space to jump. Also, if pre-jump
velocity is conserved, then you\'d want to break at least a little be
fore jumping (instead of accelerating straight for 2 days, then
jumping).

Lets assume we have 2 worlds, one TL15 and one TL12, and a Navy that needs
some real warships and some tankers. Now, TL12 warships suck, when compared
to TL15 warships, but jump-3 TL12 tankers arent too bad.

So the Navy commissions the tankers from the TL12 world, and has them built
there (leading to nice \'Imperium Signs Massive Defense Contract with Us !\'
headlines and lots of dinner invites for the Vice-Admiral in charge of
procurement). The real warships get built at the hi-tech shipyard.

It is pushing the analogy a bit, but modern militaries do build new
contruction of obsolescent designs for reasons of economy (how long did the
A4 and A6 gets built for, anyway ?).

I did a couple of worlds like that a decade ago, for my Twilight\'s Peak
campaign. They break from canon, in that I placed the giants where I
wanted them for plot purposes, rather than where the Spinward Marches
sourcebooks say they should be, but then it\'s MY Traveller universe :-)

One had the primary belt being well inside the jump interdiction zone
(what I called it). The system used solar sails to boost refined ores out
to the jump limit where they were picked up by merchants.  The culture was
actually pretty reasonable, but didn\'t bother explaining things to
strangers because everyone knew that _everyone_ knew how things worked
(belts get very few tourists, so most of the belter hadn\'t met anyone from
outsystem before).

Well, IMO, a transponder is never going to be able to "prove" who you are
and I thought saying they existed for that reason didn\'t work.

If they exist, I think they would be mostly to aid navigation (ships are easier
to track and you don\'t have to take time to call them up to find out who they
are).   It does have some benefit to security because it complicates some
situations because ships have to commit to sneaking up (since once they
are detected they have to explain why their transponders were off which
they may or may not be able to do).

That is why I think they exist.

MT does not have a limit on T-plate efficiency; My campiagns do not either.
I will not retrofit the T-Plate efficiency onto MT as I run it. IMO, it
defeats too much previous cannon (including TCS, to some degree), is ill
thought, and makes no sense. IMTU, True Recationless Thrusters push against
themost significant gravity wells, and thus the objects creating them, and
thus truly are not reactionless, but use the mass of planets, stars, dark
matter, interstellar gasses, etc., as reaction mass. Just like IMTU, a
repulsor CAN be used for fine maneuving in docks.

Since I don\'t run TNE anymore (the combat system is BROKEN, and I\'ve tried
dozens of fixes, and just don\'t like any of them), and don\'t  like T4
except for the Psionics rules and number of skills per term, my players
don\'t expect me to use "questionable" items from the newer canon. If I were
running T4, I\'d use the limits, and if T5 has the limits, when running T5
I\'ll use the limits.

TL 9 anti-grav-thrusters are limited to about 1000 diameters, and no full
thrust after 100 diameters, and I limit gravitic modules (vehicular type)
to 10 diameters for full thrust, and no thrust past 100 diameters.

Freelance Traveller is 
(1) My web site 
(2) A resource for Traveller players and referees 
(3) A webzine for Traveller players and referees 
(4) Fan-supported - If fans don\'t write and send me stuff,
Freelance Traveller doesn\'t survive 
(5) Located at http://www.tightbeam.com/FreelanceTraveller and
mirrored at http://w3.execnet.com/jeffz (although the mirror will
be moving soon).  Why not give it a visit?
(6) Highly acclaimed (but only by those who think highly of it)
(7) All of the above - this ain\'t a multiple choice question!

  A common theory is that mercenary companies with the correct licences
could use higher-end gear - not unreasonably given the Imperial tendency
to use them as low political cost proxies within the 3I itself.

  As for pirates, to a large extent it\'s relative armament that counts -
a knife is enough when your target has only a sweaty brow...

>But that is mute.  The sensor discussion did it for me. 
/.../ Pirate don\'t work in defended systems.

  Actually, I suspect that it would be very hard to build a system with
anything like near-universal fast response defenses, unless it had very
few traffic nexi to protect, or very large resources. So, while a Pop 7
mainworld may be effectively inviolable the outer system defenses amy be
quite porous - which would make a good case for not using starships for
certain commercial missions.

  Likewise, a Jump from the (safe) mainworld to a large and well-protected
facility not within a 100-D effect would be quite safe.

  There\'s a reasonable basis for the belief that training is more

Ditto. After the second time my royalty check from ICE bounced I got a

Firstly, there tend to be lots of worlds and moons in a system. This is

Secondly, there tends to be multiple refuelling points per system, even
ignoring the Oort cloud. Most systems have at least one planet with some
water, or an asteroid belt (ice asteroids) or multiple gas giants. It is
still most cost-effective to fuel up at the starport (time is money), but
this isnt your only option.

Has anyone done an entire subsector using extended system generation ?

It has big radiators in the cargo bay that flip out as soon as it hits
orbit.  It also uses as little power as possible... the crew generate more
heat than the electrics.  They also use a lot of low-resistance wiring
(read: fiber-optics and pure copper) to minimise heat buildup from that
source.

			Minutes per metric ton**
Equipment Used		0-G	Vacc 1-G Air

5 man in VaccSuits	4	3	3
5 man in clothes*	3	2	2
1 man with LRTP\'s	2	-	-
1 man w/Pallet Jacks**	-	3	2

This table basically assumes times from ready on boards to loaded in cargo
or vice versa; times really should be doubled for moving ship to ship.
Times should be doubled for medium break-bulk (loose boxes and crates
instead of containerized or shrinkwrapped onto pallets) and times 10 for
small items (125L boxes {25cm cubes}).

* in vaccum assumes LD Vacc suit or tailored vaccsuit.
** assume SG 4 (4MT per 1Td) as a good average if you don\'t want to figure
out masses from traveller cargos yourself.
*** assumes pallatized loads that are secure on the pallet. Iv\'e moved up
to a 1/2 ton pallet of icecream at the rates shown, moving the goods from
loose to a pallet 2m from the shelves, while in a -10c freezer. Moving the
pallet the 10-15 meters to shrink-wrap took another 2 minutes on average,
including opening and closing the 1/4-ton sliding door. Shrink wrap took
another 5 minutes, and then it was a fairly stable unit. The guys who
worked the wharehouse (I worked the co-located icecream plant) could load
and move faster than I could. BTW, a 1/2ton pallet of ice cream is about 2m
tall, and uses a 1.5x1.5m pallet which is about 7-12 cm tall it\'s self,
weighing about 10kg. Lined up pallets go on trucks at the loading-dock at
the rate of about 1-2 per minute, depending on skill and depth of refer
van, at least that\'s what I\'ve seen done. A full van can be unloaded to the
dock (which is level with the floor of the reefer van floor) in under 15
minutes for a fully palletized load in a 40\' trailer. And about as long to
get the load into the freezer, using about 5 men for each task.

Funny you should mention the Gazelle; The text in Traders and Gunboats
(Supplement 7 of the LBBs) indicated that the layout of decks in the
Gazelle was *specifically* designed to seperate the enlisted crew from the
officers and provide the officers with a defensable bridge area in the
event of a mutiny.

Comments of others aside, and other factors affecting piracy
notwithstanding, I don\'t think its difficult for an undercrewed ship to
operate.  Like the sailing ships of old, military vessels are heavily
overcrewed due to the needs of combat and the desire for extra coverage for
watches and such.  If procedures are changed, maintenance schedules allowed
to slip, etc, a vessel like a Gazelle could be run with only 4 crewmembers
(out of 12) for most of the time (I\'m thinking two watchstanders, one in
engineering, one on the bridge, in rotating 8 or 12 hour shifts).

A British Frigate in the West Indies mutinied in the late 1700s over the
behavior of their captain (described in _The Black Ship_ I can\'t recall the
vessels name).  They did not turn pirate, but they turned themselves in to
a Spainish port, where some stayed awhile, but most dispersed themselves to
the four winds, some even returning home to England, several signed on
privateers or pirates, many went to America, and many simply were not heard
of again.  All the ones we know about were eventually hung.  Some, however,
seem to have successfully mutinied.

I believe that of the 130 or so on board, 30-50 were "active" mutineers,
60-80 were "passive participants" who obeyed orders of the mutineers once
the killing was over, and the remainder were either killed and thrown
overboard or just thrown overboard.  Several asked that they be considered
prisoners of war when they arrived in the Spainish port.  I think that with
treatment of the more professional Imp Navy personnel you would expect many
fewer to participate or allow a mutiny to occur, so I would not expect an
Imperial Navy vessel much larger than a Gazelle to be subject to a mutiny.

Other navies (local navies with SDBs) might be different.

Now, a British Frigate in 1800 could not, in the end, escape the British
Navy and remain on Earth, so there is not really a good analogy to an
Imperial Navy ship near an open border, like the Vargr Extents or the
Trojan Reach, where many local nation-states would pay nicely for a
Gazelle.  On the other paw, The Imperial Navy would do it\'s damndest (like
the RN) to hunt down and kill every last perpetrator of a mutiny in hopes
that this would discourage imitators.

In any case there is that reference to mutiny in LBB Supp. 7 which even
prompted a *design change* on a common Impy Navy ship.

This raises some interesting ideas. If you think about it for a
while, it makes the idea of popping in-system at only 100D from
Mainworld kind of unlikely (a good thing, IMHO).

I did a Q&D sketch at http://www.rt66.com/~merrick/jumpglop.html to
show what I mean (easier to draw than try to do it in ascii :-)

The bottom line is that there are many times when you might well
have to spend a few days in normal space to jump. Also, if pre-jump
velocity is conserved, then you\'d want to break at least a little be
fore jumping (instead of accelerating straight for 2 days, then
jumping).

It depends a bit.  At the least, is smells of trademark dilution via
sponsorship confusion.  I.E., it might appear to be sponsored
and the consumer might think its official or authorized by the
trademark owning party.  Thats called trading on the goodwill
of the mark holder, exactly what trademark is about preventing.

Having said that, very, very clear disclaimers might help.
As does the non-profit nature.  But in the end, its going to depend
on the exact nature of the fanzine.  If it was all Traveller stuff, its
probably going to violate trademark without a license.

IMO, better in this situation to get Mr. Miller\'s blessing than
to try to get forgiveness later.

Lets assume we have 2 worlds, one TL15 and one TL12, and a Navy that needs
some real warships and some tankers. Now, TL12 warships suck, when compared
to TL15 warships, but jump-3 TL12 tankers arent too bad.

So the Navy commissions the tankers from the TL12 world, and has them built
there (leading to nice \'Imperium Signs Massive Defense Contract with Us !\'
headlines and lots of dinner invites for the Vice-Admiral in charge of
procurement). The real warships get built at the hi-tech shipyard.

It is pushing the analogy a bit, but modern militaries do build new
contruction of obsolescent designs for reasons of economy (how long did the
A4 and A6 gets built for, anyway ?).

I suspect it is more that the mass of obviously different immigrants
(legal and not) comes from Latin America.

I\'ve noticed up here that, even though I\'m an immigrant, everyone assumes
I was born here, while many of my friends get asked when they arrived
(when they were born here). Sadly, the assumption seems to be that if you
aren\'t white, you immigrated.

This is why I\'d never vote Reform, BTW: they either want to kick me out
because I\'m really an immigrant, or most of my friends because they aren\'t
white.  I\'m offended either way.

ObTrav: There should definately be a characteristic for how offworlders
are regarded. This would range from "Kill on sight" through "Some of my
best friends but I wouldn\'t want my daughter to marry one" and "People
like us" to "Godlike beings with infinite knowledge and wisdom".

You\'d still need to lower the power plant output. Traveller power plants
are actually 100% efficient, in that we\'ve always assumed that they
produce exactly as much power as the ship consumes. This is _not_
accurate, and everyone knows it, but that\'s "canon". Thus, a ship with a
150MW power plant is actually a ship who\'s systems _consume_ 150MW. If you
add in the true inefficiencies of power plants then it would need a larger
power plant.

Take a look at the power requirements of various ship systems in MT, TNe,
or T4.

I did this when playing Dream Park with my kids. I made equipment cards
for every piece of equipment, with the name and  apicture on front and
name, description, and game stats on the back. Any equipment on hand (ie
ready for use) was set upright in front of the player (using little
stands). This meant I could easily see who had what ready, and the kids
could easily see what their gear could do.

I extended the idea to stuff from Space: 1889, but didn\'t actually make
the cards--lack of time and less need, that group being all adults with
better memories and longer attention spans.

Used equipment sheets with MegaTraveller. In fact, many of those published
by DGP were my designs: grashfalt, cargo container...

weeks currently.

This would fix the problem many have with the jump in & jump out.

2.Or the 3I could have reservists serve one month out of every year & one
day a month.  This would have the same amount of days as the current plan.

3. Or someone else could come up with an another idea.

Welll, the proximity fuse and detonator weren\'t on the specs, becuase it

This will happen. I PDFed a bunch of assignments so kids could download
them from home, and file size went from 12k to 138k! I started using fewer
fonts after that.

Then the ISP deleted the web site by mistake, and hasn\'t resurrected it
yet, while the official web site is not available (even though we\'re
paying for it) because the central office managers are busy playing power
games instead of making learning happen. (I work for the school board.)

I agree. If you want cat and mouse (or \'hide and seek with bazookas\' which
is how Frank Chadwick described it IIRC) you should play 2300\'s Starcruiser
(I wish they\'d published a bugfixed version of the Naval Architect\'s Manual
though).

Traveller has always been giant slugfests at capital ship level - like the
big fleet action descriptions in Lensman, or Azimov, or Banks. The nearest
literary thing to both I can think of is Hamilton\'s _Reality Dysfunction /
Neutronium Alchemist_ books where KKMs and det lasers are standard.

Cat and Mouse only applies for really small ships....

Just a thought, but aren\'t colonial fleets like the reserve fleets of the
3I?

So if they are the reserve fleets of the 3I, maybe they are made up of
revervists who serve one weekend a month & 2 weeks a year, but by this time
it may be 1 week a month & 1 month a year...  I.e. all those characters who
are not in the military might be members of the colonial fleets, thats how
they got their military skills...

Also, many of the sector, sub-sector, & planetary fleets might also come
into this...  I.e. a colonial fleet might be made up of this sub-sector
fleet providing the CrusRon, this planet providing the DestRon, & the
reservists providing the TankRon...

Also another thought (I know this is kinda jumbled, but I am typing this as
I think of it), is that maybe the Navy starts off the characters in their
first active term in a colonial fleet to gain some safe experience, then
moves him over to a active fleet, then as he or she gets older, they are
transfered back to the colonial fleet to train new members of the fleet...

Being possible dosen\'t mean that it is or isn\'t there. I think too many
people confuse possible/impossible with established/established not to be.
I think that is partly due to the fact that they are interrelated. But they
are not the same thing.

If something is impossible and the game author says it dosen\'t exist then
there is no problem.

If something is possible and the author says it exists then it exists.

If it is possible, but the author says it dosen\'t exist, then it dosen\'t
exist (but see below).

The problems all arise when something is impossible or almost so and
the author nevertheless says it exist and when something is inevitable
or nearly so and the author says it dosen\'t exist. That\'s when we get
all the discussions.

No, I forgot the most frequent source of controversy: When something is
possible and the author in one place says it exists and in another says
it dosen\'t... ;-)

The deck plans look great, but theexploded view at the back just has funny

If you _did_ include the fonts, then I guess I need some help with Acrobat

There was some increase to about 652kb, from imbedding the fonts I believe,
still a reasonable size compared to the ~1.5 meg in the original Corel file
and much higher in JPEG formats. I\'d really like to suggest .PDF as a
standard, if the Acrobat package wasn\'t so expensive. I\'m a bit luck to have
it available on my work network, so I can dial it up and use it.

Cold fusion is actually worse for percentage of waste energy than hot
fusion (basic thermodynamics.) 

To go with higher power plant efficiency (and the TL13-15
power plants in FFS2 are already up at about 99%), 
you also have to assume that all devices on the ship are very efficient-
that none of the power that goes into your maneuver drive, for example,
comes out as heat. (Since maneuver drives already create energy, maybe
this isn\'t a bad assumption.) You need superconducting cables everywhere,
etc...

One certainly can assume that the power plant radiators run at lower 
levels most of the time - non-combat, or landing, for example. One 
could also assume that they include air-cooling modes for operating in
an atmosphere (so you don\'t bake everyone below you...just blow very 
hot air above you.) (Another reason for ships to still use the 
"blast pits" seen on old starport maps...) 

Another way to get rid of excess heat would be to vent very very very
hot plasma (accounting for CT-style fuel consumption for power plants),
but that makes you incredibly easy to detect, since you can\'t 
baffle the plasma.

I think (in my Copious Spare Time) I may work on the "Conservative
Sensor Rules" - a rules set that assumes (somehow) lower total heat
production, and that sensor technology develops more slowly...

I had a dicsussion this summer with a TML\'er where we sort of agreed that:
  - we could deal with transmissions activating other SDG transponders.
  - it was internally consistent for "Virus" to spread itself physically
by etching additional circuitry to reach another system (see A:13 /GK).
  - it made no sense whatever for Virus to spread via fiber-optic lines
or broadcast transmissions to non-SDG components.
  : therefore, if common Imperial comp tech used linkages through which
Virus could physically spread, then that should have been stated.

  IIRC, neither of used Virus (or played TNE).

Personally, where I live, I have noticed a slowly *improving*
attitude toward all minorities during the last 30 years.  I
certainly haven\'t seen strong anti-latino feelings since the
mid-80\'s.

Well now, maybe you mean the fact that many Americans don\'t like the
idea of aliens flooding across our borders?  If that\'s it, the
disquiet isn\'t specifically anti-latino, it\'s more anti-immigration,
especially illegal immigration, it just so happens that the mass of
the illegal immigrates come from Central American countries.  I
think this is more an economic issue than anything, but like most
things you can make it a racial one if you try.  

Xenophobia is something else.  It\'s an *unreasonable* fear of
outsiders.

For reference:

My friend Ian (a physicist) once calculated that his free trader starship
should be glowing red when running at full power. MegaTraveller starships
are really hot!  After verifying that I had given him the correct _gaming_
statistics, he then decided to lump it under the "suspension of disbelief"
catagory, and went off muttering about "scientific illiterates trying to
repeal the law of gravity" -- which is when i told him about contragrav :-)

The solutions are:

1) Lower Traveller power requirements to more reasonable levels, and keep
realistic sensor rules.

2) Keep power requirements, and accept the easy detectability of starships.

3) Keep power requirements, and lower sensor sensitivity as well to
maintain some level of ship stealth (same effects as 1, different
mechanism).

Possibly we should have a new geek code?

Actually, I think he\'s referring to the growing anti-immigration (legal
and otherwise) sentiment, which is most often aimed at Latinos as the
most obvious, and most mentioned in the press. This is in contrast to
the _true_ situation...in NYC one of the largest groups of illegal
aliens are Irish. More to the point, it is disproportionately latinos
who are stopped and interrogated as to their citizenship status...I have
known people who were told they should carry their birth certificates
with them so they don\'t get deported. Deported to where I don\'t know,
since they were born here, like their parents were...

ObTrav: This is actually a great example of xenophobia rating in
action:"They look different, they talk funny, they must be ________

This assumes the term reserves is used in the same context it is for the

I don\'t see this in the Imperium (it is canon for the solomani confed
tho... AM 6 IIRC). Rather the reserve fleets are used in the WWII european
sense: units not intended for first line combat assignments, but able
enough to respond as backups and reliefs to front-liners. Colonials woould
fill the same role for the reserve units.

Something else to consider is that there are presently computerised sonar
analysis programs... I was thinking more along the lines of a database of
registered starships, and their jump signatures.  Of course, this adds a
lot to the xboat traffic, but there you go...

Some subsector fleets ARE exactly as the description has it, composed of
obsolescent IN castoffs. The Duke of Lunion, for example, would be happy to
buy obsolescent IN ships, because the best he can procure locally is TL 13
(I still think he\'d buy some local TL 13 designs, but maybe not). And dukes
of subsectors with TL 14 high-pop planets would still be interested in IN
TL 15 retirees. Even dukes with TL 15 planets would buy _some_ ships from
the IN. And those are the ships the public hears about. "DELPHINE BUYS
CLUNKERS! BUY LOCAL, SAYS UNION BOSS!!!" the headlines of the opposition
press and the yellow press will say, forgetting to mention that she is only
buying a few clunkers and many local ships.

IMO. The proper place to store ships in ordinary is surely spread out

the shipyards that are going to do the work of reactivating them, isn\'t it?
Otherwise you have a few thousand ships orbiting Depot and no way to

I dont think so, you\'re underestimating the quality of your own work :*>.

One of the things that struck me when I first saw your minor race generation 
tables was the utter logical nature of them. Your tables are pretty much self 
explanatory. The only thing I can\'t figure out is what are "components". Its not 
immediately obvious and I can\'t find it explained in the text anywhere. The other 
thing that could cause confusion is the Caste "Sport". Its not defined in the text 
and to a neophile I\'d imagine it would conjure up images of professional 
atheletes ("hey now theres a race that has a distinct biological gender devoted 
to sports"). but other than that the Minor Race Generation tables are fairly 
much self explanatory.

	Why, I wouldn\'t know how to think about an interstellar society 
*without* lots of prejudice going on. Some examples OTMH:

	1) "Capital-guys": People from the mainworlds will always have 
prejudices against the "colonists" in other worlds. In the same way, 
citizens from the startowns will tend to have prejudices against 
people from the "countryside". And it works the other way. When the 
players leave the startown and head to another part of the planet 
during an adventure in an important, not-a-backwater world, iamgine 
their surprise when the inhabitants regard them as "stupid 
starpeople"... but it is logical, since the startown citizens treat 
them the same way.
	So, there will always be possibilities for a group of traders 
willing to land in some location of the world other than the 
starport... you know, why should we pay our taxes just to support 
those startowners whims?

	2) Races. Almost in any planet where you have a sizeable racial 
minority, economic problems may cause an increase in 
racism. Thus, if you visit ten such planets, you MUST see at least 
one case (and that is optimistic). But, which hi-pop world is not 
going to have a sizeable racial minority? A Vargr player arrives in a 
Hipop world, and suddenly he realizes that the local population 
accuses the Vargr minority of all the planet\'s problems. He will be 
actively harrassed, in some cases. A nice plot is always to help some 
members of a minority to escape their foreordained destiny as 
scapegoats for some Big Guy. Specially, when the minority has its own 
prejudices and is just looking for a bunch of stupid humans to accuse 
instead... either way, the Big Guy turns into a Big Problem for the 
rest of the campaign.

	3) Nobles. Do you really think that an imperial noble is going to be 
admired by the populace in any republican, democratic world? Of 
course you would always have examples like the democratic US, where 
the courts of *foreign* kings are much admired (<quickly 
ducking for cover>), but if you are a convinced democrat, one thing 
is admitting to form part of a distant Imperium that does not meddle 
in your planet\'s affairs, and a much different thing is to have to do 
a favor to that Imperial Knight who believes he is something just 
because he can prove his father was a Baron... so, allow one player 
to be a Knight. And, them, make him realize that it is not always 
wise to say so at the first opportunity.

I read (I forget where) a theory that naval military technology since the
end of the classic period has been driven by the quest to find a decisive
ship sinking weapon like the ram was in the heyday of the trireme. The
argument is that until the invention of workable explosive shells ships
didn\'t get sunk (to all intents and purposes) in combat, instead after
hours of bettering they became incapable of resisting boarding parties.
Note that aside from subs and aircraft WWI and WWII BBs were in a similar
situation, though they did tend to sink in the end. Given that this state
of affiars lasted for over 1500 years, I can see no reason why it shouldn\'t
be able to exist in the far future.

IMO one problem Traveller ship combat has is that people want the feeling
that you get having mighty ship pounding away at each other like a WWI
slugfest, but they also want the quick thrill of the cat and mouse game of
fire and maneuver and these are two fairly incompatible desires.

Gurps is pretty much the same.  With a good gunners and tageting software
it\'s 1 laser one dead missle per turn.  The only way to get misile hits is a
large salvo that closes fast enough to overwhelm the defenses.  It is doable
but not very cost effective.  Those misiles are pricy.

Sorry have to make some corrections.   I missed some things in sidebars ect.

I have my book with me so I looked it up.  I was just reading the space
combat section when this came up.

Do to turn limits in the combat situation you have to shoot a ship or a
missle but not both with each laser.  A scout with one triple laser turret
fired on by 9 missles from 2 seconds out will be hit by three missles if the
gunners involved do not miss.

1st second shoot three misiles: gunner skill 15 (above average professional)
+ 15 accuacy (limited to gunner shill) +4 aiming +10 computer (very good
comp.) +2 active sensor +4 rof =50 - 41 for range 1 = 9  You must role less
the 9 on three d6 but 17 and 18 always fail.

I assume here that you hit.

2nd second shoot three missles and get hit by the other three. range 0 role
to hit = 21  (including a +10 for point defense bonus and shorter range)

3 missles hit if misile gunner roles his success number for colition damage
plus explosion

missile cost 22kcr each.

Physiology

Unlike most known Human races, the Luriani are a discrete species (Homo 
luriani) and are not interfertile with other Humans. However significant portions 
of the Luriani genome were utilised by Rule of Man geneticists in the 
"construction" of the Scanians, thus the Luriani are interfertile with this branch 
of Humaniti. Matings with other branches of Humaniti will only produce sterile 
offspring.

Physiologically the Luriani are unmistakably human, but they do possess a 
number of unique identifying physical characteristics, however these 
characteristics are only apparent on a close physical inspection. The Luriani 
posses a transparent second eyelid which protects their eyes from pressure 
and irritants, as well as acting to improve their vision under water. They 
possess muscles that can seal the inner ear, protecting it at extreme depths. 
They naturally produce a number of body oils that protect them from cold and 
irritants. Both their feet and hands are webbed. However, their most notable 
adaptations are the fat cells they posses which store oxygen. This allows them 
to collapse their lungs and reach far greater depths (around 500m) than other 
Humans, as well as permitting them to remain in an oxygen free environment 
for up to thirty minutes.

However, distinctive as all of these characteristics are, they are not the most 
remarkable modifications to the Luriani. The most remarkable and influential 
adaptations in the Luriani are found in their brains. At least 93% of all Luriani 
are right brain dominant and their language centres are located in the regions of 
the brain more usually associated with music and singing. These modifications, 
coupled with their close ties with the aquatic environment have produced the 
distinctive features of the Luriani culture.

Culture

Luriani culture is strongly influenced by the right hemisphere nature of their 
brain. The Luriani are a creative, passionate and artistic people. The usual 
Imperial stereotype of the hotblooded Luriani artist does in fact have some 
basis in truth. Luriani music and art frequently reflects the emotional tension 
that lies beneath the surface of their society. Few Humans can fail to be at 
least slightly affected by the pulsating up-tempo bass rhythms of Luriani music, 
even more so when coupled with the sensual nature of Luriani dance. However, 
as with all stereotypes, this ignores the vast sweep of Luriani culture.

Many outside observers characterise Luriani society as being communal; in 
fact the Luriani are very strongly individualistic, but they utilise a form of group 
marriage in which a number of adults will form a distinct family grouping. Any 
children born into the family are regarded as brothers and sisters and all the 
adults will regard them as their children. Because of this, the universal Human 
incest taboo is slightly altered amongst the Luriani. It is accepted that some 
"siblings" will form relationships with their "brothers and sisters" during pubity. 
Such relationships are discouraged, but they are tolerated as long as the 
children do not share a biological parent. However, the relationships between 
the adults within the family are in a constant state of flux.

The Luriani believe in individual and family honour. The Luriani code of honour 
evolved as a mechanism to limit the negative effects of the Lurianis emotional 
nature. Luriani honour holds that effort and intent are far more important than 
actual results; Luriani mythology is replete with stories and examples of heroic 
failure. The three basic tenets of Luriani honour are protect your family; offer 
hospitality to all that seek it; and treat your foes fairly. Unlike many other 
honour codes, the Luriani code does not feature a physical duelling element, 
rather matters of personal honour are settled by "contests. In a contest, the 
two parties will attempt to complete some task or demonstrate mastery of a 
skill, usually artistic. As long as both parties have made given their best, there 
is no stain on ones honour for loosing such a contest. When it comes to 
warfare, the Luriani hold that this is a matter for nations and tribes, not 
individuals; thus war does not remove a Lurianis obligations on a personal 
level, even when serving in the military.

Art

Art is one of the most important elements of Luriani culture, outside of the 
Protectorate art is the most widely recognised aspect of their culture. Luriani 
art reflects the turbulent and restless nature of their society, very little Luriani 
art can be classified as static, the essence of their art is the movement and 
energy found in their culture. The most prominent Luriani art form is of course 
music, but they are also drawn to most other performance arts (dance is 
almost as widely practiced as music). Other art forms such as painting and 
sculpture are less common, but none the less are still considered noble and 
honourable professions.

Luriani music is distinctive and unique; the most obvious defining characteristic 
is its 10/8 time signature. However, it also possesses a number of other very 
distinctive characteristics. Virtually all Luriani music makes extensive use of 
the voice as an instrument; and slight differences in Luriani physiology has 
resulted their vocal cords being longer than the Human norm, contributing to 
the strong base tendencies in their music. Luriani singing also features a 
secondary voiced note when inhaling in addition to the usual note when 
exhaling, leading to a distinctive "breathy" sound (this effect is remarkably 
difficult for non-Luriani to reproduce, lacking the Lurianis internal independent 
oxygen source).

Fashion

Traditional Luriani clothing and appearance is almost as distinctive and powerful 
as their music. Many have likened their fashions to those of the Vargr. 
Traditional Luriani clothing is lightweight and lose fitting, intended to 
simultaneously functional and sensual. Luriani fashions are intended to be 
provocative and revealing, whilst maintaining a sense of mystery. The concept 
of utilitarian clothing that does not serve this purpose appears to be entirely 
alien to the Luriani. Thus, all Luriani clothing has to serve this dual purpose (the 
Luriani were scandalised by the Solomani and their "sack-like ship suits"). 
Luriani fashions do not use muted or subdued colours; their clothing features 
many irregular blocks of strong discordant colours with sharp dividing lines 
between them. These blocks swirl and interlock, with the intention of giving a 
sense of movement and energy. The intention of the designer is to draw 
attention to certain parts of the body and away from others. Likewise, the 
Luriani make extensive use of body decorations. Rather than using permanent 
forms of body markings such as tattoos, the Luriani use a variety of body 
paints and dyes to adorn themselves. The final result is that the average Luriani 
is a sight to behold; dressed in their vibrant clothing with their bodies painted 
and dyed in many bright contrasting colours and shapes; one can not fail to 
recognise them immediately.

    'body' => 'History

The Luriani are a Human minor race transported to their new home by the 
mysterious Ancients some 300,000 years ago. Whilst the Luriani are 
unmistakably Human they have several unique and distinct characteristics 
which are a result of both natural evolution and genetic tampering by the 
Ancients. The Luriani are often referred to as "aquatic" Humans. This is not 
strictly true, for although they are far more at home in a water environment than 
most Humans these adaptations do not go as far as the Solomani geenered 
Scanians. Luriani have distinctively webbed hands and feet; certain fat cells 
have the ability to store oxygen which allows the Luriani to remain submerged 
for up to 30 minutes and reach depths of up to 500 metres without any artificial 
assistance. They possess a clear second eyelid under the first that greatly 
enhances their vision underwater. However perhaps their most striking 
modifications are not readily apparent at all. Unlike virtually all other Human 
races, the Luriani are overwhelmingly right brain dominant and their language 
ability is located in the centre of the brain which normally deals with singing 
rather than the classic speech centres. It would appear that these 
modifications were introduced to enable the Luriani to function well in a three 
dimensional environment. This has lead to further speculation that the Ancients 
intended to make the Luriani fully aquatic but the Final War intervened, leaving 
the Luriani "unfinished. Because of these modifications the Luriani are 
overwhelmingly (at least 93%) lefthanded, intensely creative and artistic, and 
have a strong tendency towards music and other performance arts.

Daramm (the Luriani homeworld) is officially classified as a waterworld, with 
only 5% of its surface being land. However, this is still 19.7 million km2. 
Daramm is a normal world with eleven continental plates, but these are mostly 
below sea level. Thus, Daramm is covered by a large number of continental 
sized island archipelagos surrounded by shallow (150m to 300m) seas. These 
"continents" are surrounded by deep (2000m to 5000m) oceans. It would 
appear that the Ancients initially deposited the Luriani on several islands in one 
of these archipelagos.

The semi-aquatic nature of the Luriani enabled them to utilise the shallow seas 
around their island homes for hunting and gathering, thus allowing for far greater 
populations and development than might have otherwise been expected. 
However eventually the restricted nature of their island homes started to limit 
their development. These growing pressures lead to the development of 
seafaring on Daramm far before the Luriani had even developed anything even 
remotely like civilisation. It is theorised that the creative nature of the Luriani 
brain played a crucial role in this. Thus in approximately -250,000 the Luriani 
developed seagoing vessels whilst they were still a primitive hunter-gatherer 
society. By -150,000, the Luriani had developed oceangoing vessels capable of 
circumnavigating their entire world despite still possessing only a TL0 culture. It 
was the possession of this maritime capacity that preserved the remarkable 
homogeneity of Luriani culture, despite being separated by thousands of 
kilometres of water, each Luriani settlement was connected by a web of 
voyaging ships. Indeed some Luriani lived out their entire lives at sea, only 
setting foot on land to gather supplies or build new ships.

Given this voyaging culture it was only natural that the Luriani should quickly 
come to the concept of trade and commerce, thus giving rise to the first signs 
of Luriani civilisation. By -100,000 the Luriani had developed a thriving world 
spanning barter economy. The huge nomadic voyaging ships travelling between 
islands, trading with the various island communities. However with the rise of 
trade came the rise of piracy and warfare. Both the seagoing nomads and the 
island dwelling settlements found a need for fighters to defend against the 
depredations of raiders, which would eventually evolve into the Luriani warrior 
class. Thus by -30,000 the Luriani had established a world spanning trading 
civilisation complete with organised warfare, despite the fact that they were still 
a TL0 hunter gatherer culture without any domesticated animals or form of 
agriculture.

Over the next 23,000 years the Luriani gradually improved their technology and 
culture. In around -28,000 the first signs of agriculture appeared on a number of 
islands, animals were domesticated around -25,000. Metalworking was 
achieved around -15,000. When Vilani influenced traders contacted the Luriani 
in -7500 they had advanced to a solid TL3. The Luriani were to prove to be 
extremely adept in absorbing advanced technology; and by -7200 they had 
achieved TL9 and were launching their first "voyaging" ships to the stars. By -
6000 they had established a vigorous interstellar culture encompassing over 30 
worlds (most located to spinward of Daramm). However the Luriani never 
grasped the concept of an interstellar state (much as they have never truly 
developed a world spaning government) and their worlds remained a loose 
grouping closely bound by their voyaging culture. However, this somewhat 
idyllic situation was not to remain.

In -5400 the Vilani began the Consolidation Wars. Initially the Vilani ignored the 
Luriani. Located far to trailing on the fringes of explored space, the Vilani 
regarded their independent worlds as a minor threat compared with the many 
organised interstellar states that they faced. This was to prove to be a 
miscalculation on the Vilani\'s part. When in around -4700 the Vilani began 
efforts to incorporate the Luriani they responded by rapidly forming a united 
front to face the common enemy. Early Vilani attempts to incorporate the 
Luriani by economic pressure failed and in 4582 the Vilani opened the Luriani 
Consolidation War.

The initial Vilani offensives were turned back with heavy losses in the face of 
determined resistance. The Luriani proved to be formidable opponents for the 
Vilani, the nature of their brains made three-dimensional combat second nature 
to the Luriani and their warrior class made very efficient fighters. However 
eventually the superior economic weight of the Vilani began to tell and one by 
one the Luriani worlds fell to the advancing Vilani fleets. In -4547 Daramm fell 
and the Luriani were defeated. Despite several revolts they were to remain 
under Vilani rule until the coming of the Solomani in 2223.

When the Vilani conquered the Luriani in -4547 they attempted to impose their 
culture on the Luriani; Vilani governors were placed in control of Luriani worlds 
and the Luriani were expected to conform to Vilani cultural norms. These efforts 
were less than successful, though the Luriani did remain firmly under the 
control of the Vilani, their culture remained largely intact, the Vilani were never 
able to stamp out the emotional and independent nature of the Luriani. Thus 
when the Solomani arrived in the Ley sector in -2223 they were greeted as 
liberators by the Luriani. They allied themselves with the Terrans and a number 
of Luriani units served in the Terran forces during their final drive on Vland, 
proving that they had lost none of their fighting abilities. With the final defeat of 
the Vilani in -2219 the Luriani expected that the Solomani would restore their 
independence. However they were to be sadly disappointed. Unlike the Geonee 
or Suerrat, the Luriani were not granted autonomy under the Rule of Man. 
Naturally this bred resentment with in the Luriani and in -2186 the Luriani 
rebelled against the Rule of Man. What followed was a tragedy for the Luriani. 
Isolated with only a limited production base, the Luriani faced an alliance of 
both Terran and Vilani forces. The Luriani hoped that the other minor races 
would come to their aid. These hopes proved futile and the Luriani were 
gradually worn down and in -2180 their final stronghold fell and in a cruel turn of 
fate, the Luriani again came under Vilani occupation. However under the Rule of 
Man, Luriani art and music found a wide audience amongst the Solomani; and 
this lead to widespread sympathy for the fate of the Luriani. Finally, in -1932 
Empress Juliana established the Luriani Cultural Region. With this, the each 
individual Luriani world was granted internal self-rule, answering to a Solomani 
planetary governor, with the entire region under the control of a military governor 
general.

With the collapse of the Rule of Man in -1776, the Solomani governor general of 
the Luriani Cultural Region found herself isolated and vulnerable. Admiral 
Martinez solved her problems by reaching an agreement with the Luriani. She 
transformed the Luriani Cultural Region into the Luriani Protectorate. Under this 
compromise, her fleet provided protection for the Luriani in return for support, 
while the Luriani worlds were allowed to retain their independence. The 
Protectorate continued to exist into the Long Night; the Protectorate gradually 
evolved into a unique government. The Solomani provided the much needed 
skills to administer a large-scale interstellar government, whilst the Luriani 
provided the necessary support facilities and their warrior class came to 
dominate the Protectorate fleet. Eventually however the Long Night claimed the 
Protectorate, by -1200 the Protectorate fleet had dwindled to just a handful of 
vessels and contact between the worlds had all but ceased. In -1183, Protector 
De Valine acknowledged that the Protectorate could no longer defend the 
Luriani worlds. The Solomani settled on the Luriani worlds and the Luriani 
Protectorate succumbed to the Long Night.

The situation remained unchanged until the coming of the Syleans. The Sylean 
Federation Scout Service reached the Luriani in -29. The arrival of the SFSS 
reawakened the Luriani\'s desires for the stars, Daramm had been able to retain 
TL8 throughout the Long Night, and the Solomani remained a distinct racial 
grouping. Given the prod of the Syleans arrival, the Luriani applied themselves 
to regaining the stars. It took the Luriani just 30 years to recover to TL9 and 
begin to reestablish the Protectorate. By 12, the Luriani Protectorate was a 
thriving interstellar community once more, encompassing most worlds within 5 
parsecs of Daramm. The Protectorate was a curious state, one that the new 
Imperium found hard to understand or deal with. The bulk of the population was 
Luriani by culture, but virtually all the higher levels of administration were 
provided by the Solomani Verasti (Protectors). Eventually the Imperium was 
forced to do something about the Luriani. Initially they tried to incorporate the 
Luriani through diplomatic means and initially this appeared to be a making 
progress, but negotiations stumbled on the Protectorate demand to be allowed 
to retain its identity within the Empire. It was then that Archduke Ishargi of 
Gateway made a huge error of judgement. Believing that a show of force would 
soften the Lurianis negotiating stance, Archduke Ishargi took a sizeable 
Imperial squadron and jumped to Rurur (an important frontier system inside the 
Protectorate). The result was a disaster. By sheer fluke, a substantial portion of 
the Protectorate fleet was conducting exercises in the Rurur system at the 
time. The Protectorate commander (Admiral Sherin) took this action to be the 
opening of an invasion and engaged the Imperial forces. In the resulting Luriani 
War (93-96), the Protectorate forces showed that the Luriani had lost none of 
their flare for three-dimensional warfare and inflicted several sharp defeats on 
the Imperial forces. Eventually cooler heads on both sides prevailed and a face 
saving negotiated settlement was reached. However the Luriani War was to 
leave a legacy of mistrust and tensions between the Protectorate and the 
Imperium remained high for many decades after the war.

With the end of the Luriani War Emperor Artemsus appointed an Imperial born 
Verasti, Duke Sirean of Dirir, as the new Archduke of Gateway (Archduke 
Ishargi had been killed at Rurur). Sirean chose to concentrate his efforts on 
incorporating the rimward portions of Ley sector, whilst attempting to repair 
relations with the Protectorate. Eventually this policy was to bear fruit. By 160, 
the memories of the Luriani War were fading and relations between the 
Protectorate and the Imperium were beginning to improve. However, by this 
time the situation elsewhere had changed. In the Domain of Antares events 
were moving towards the Julian War and securing the rimward flank of Antares 
had become a matter of some urgency. In 162, Archduke Acla reopened 
negotiations with the Protectorate regarding incorporation. These negotiations 
proceeded slowly as a considerable legacy of mistrust remained and had not 
yielded any positive results by the outbreak of the Julian War in 175. 
Throughout most of the Julian War the Protectorate chose to remain neutral 
until the Star Legion drove into Ley in 185. At this point, much to the surprise of 
the Imperium, the Protectorate offered an alliance and joined the War on the 
Imperial side. Though the entry of the Protectorate had little effect on the 
ultimate outcome of the war, Luriani forces were an important factor in halting 
and turning back the Star Legions drive into Ley. With the end of the war in 
191, negotiations resumed on a more positive note and in 202 the Protectorate 
was incorporated into the Imperium.

	Or that the IN has a large number of ships that are of a lower TL than 15!!

	Most people seem to assume that the entire IN is made up of TL 15 vessels,
but this is not at all true (Book 5 High Guard) :"The Imperial Navy may
procure ships of up to TL15, although it also procures vessels at TL 10 thru
14".  As is very obvious from both HG and MT, lower TL ships are considerably
more expensive than thier higher tech counterparts.  But there is no TL
adjustment for the budgets.

	It is also difficult to build highly agile warships below TL15 (esp in MT)
At TL13-14, you need twice the space for a power plant as you would at
TL15...and it\'s 3x at 10-12.

	After seeing this post, I seem to remember having read this in the book "Sink
the Bismarck"  I am not sure about the hits, however.  In making the post, I
utilized my memories from having read 2 very good books:  The one mentioned
above (which was written from the RN perspective) and the book (whose title
escapes me at the moment) written by Baron von Mullenhiem-Rechberg, who was
the 4th Gunnery Officer and senior surviving officer.

	I do believe that an order was given to scuttle the ship...most likely just
as the combat began.  There was no doubt among the crew that this was a lost
battle from the get-go; this is confirmed by the German account.  An order to
scuttle would prevent the British from possibly boarding:  I realize this
statement seems somewhat silly from the perspective of gaining useful
info...but don\'t underestimate the value that raising the White Ensign on the
Bismarck would have had on public morale, esp since the Bismarck had days
earlier sank the pride of the RN!!

I wonder if we need a GTL "Gurps Tech List" for these technical 
issues? I suppose such a thing already exists on io.com/Pyramid, but
I\'m damned if I\'m going to pay money for the sake of helping improve
their design...

Anyway, for the background-limited case (which starship visible and
IR sensors are), sensitivity (in the sense of "faintest object that
can be detected") only goes up as the square root of the time you
spend looking. Hence to get a +3 in GURPS terms (target 3.3 times
further away and hence ten times dimmer) you need to scan 100 times
longer, not 10-15; to get a +6 you need to scan 10,000 times longer.
The field-of-view modifiers are complicated too...
The human eye, on the other hand, is not background-limited (and
short exposures from visible-light sensors might not quite be
BG-limited either). It\'s hard to make a system that models both the
scaling laws for human eyes (which can\'t really integrate, have
aberration-limited resolution, and moderately low efficiency) and
staring infrared arrays hooked up to big telescopes...

On that same floorplan is a detail showing the (rough) dimensions of a

Radio the base (use low power). They send out a tug. The tug uses mass
drivers. Load them with ice, rock, whatever. Fling it away at high
speed. The Isp isn\'t the greatest, but it\'s low signature and rugged. 

In fact, you can load the "buckets" on the mass driver with *powdered*
rock/slag/ice. This makes the exhaust spread out fairly fast. That way
if a later ship pops up in the path of your exhaust, it won\'t get hurt
(unless it pops up *really* close).

While *some* power requirements *are* out of line (communications, for

Pretty much the way I see it.

Arghhhh. I have seen this argument so often and it annoys me every time.
Their

That wasn\'t why I wrote what I did. What prompted my comment was the way
many people (including myself from time to time, no doubt) make assumptions
based on the way things are now, assuming that that, for example the ratio
of armour to weapons will follow current trends. This is ignoring the fact
that most of these trends or ratios have been different in the past, often
for most of history, and could well (in fact IMO will probably be different
in the future).

What I\'m trying to say, I guess, is that the late 20th century is a lousy
place to be looking for examples to support any particular view on the OTU
in the abscence of any real canon.

Acrobat is 130 GBP, which is cheap compared to the 400 Office 98, and
300 Illustrator 7.

However, you can get most of the functionality of acrobat by using Adobe
Illustrator, which produces pdf files, and allows you to open them back up.
You just can\'t optimise them (not in AI7 anyway, v8 might be better). Okay,
I know that would mean converting from Corel... I was lucky and got both my
copies of Photoshop 4 and Illustrtor 7 together for less than the price of
a single package...

The best thing is that the reader is free, and multi-platform.  (Only
downside is that you don\'t seem to be able to scale to fit a page to your
paper size under Windoze, something which the Mac version does happily.)

I think this may help....

                        Minutes per metric ton
Equipment Used          0-G     Vacc 1-G Air
Battle Dress (or equiv) 4       2       2
5 man in VaccSuits      4       3       3
5 man in clothes*       3       2       2
1 man with LRTP\'s       2       -       -
1 man w/Pallet Jacks**  -       3       2

If you suppose this is the time it gets to load/unload one pack of one
metric ton,
then you should simply multiply this time with the number of such a pack
(one-ton
weighted).

If the packs are less than one ton of weigth, then simply multiply the
time by the
fraction of weigth...

As i don\'t explain well, here goes an example:

Lets say you have 30 packs of 100 kg each, then it would take 5 men with
clothes in
1-G air :
2 minutes*30 packs* (100 kg/ 1000 kg) = 6 minutes to load/unload them.

It was a system in Pretoria/Deneb IIRC. Thanks for reminding me of that. It
is a datum about the Imperial Navy that I had forgotten. But it does show
that some ships are laid up outside the depots. So does _Arrival Vengeance_
BTW.
My own opinion is that there are a lot of ships in the Depots, but more
outside them.

You keep missing the point. If your ship\'s systems use 100 MW then you
*have* to radiate 100 MW of "waste heat". That\'s in *addition* to any
inefficiencies in the production of the power being used. 

Waste heat is what happens to the energy *after* it has been used for
its intended purpose. 

A laser or particle beam will carry away energy in a form *other* than
waste heat. And to some extent, so does radio/radar/lidar. But the
power used by *all* other ship\'s systems winds up as waste heat *after*
performing its job. (Actually, so does the power going into the weapons
and radio, etc. It\'s just that they turn into waste heat elsewhere)

So if the manuever drive uses 50 MW, then it has to radiate away 50 MW
of *heat*. And any attempt to recover energy from that will merely
degrade the performance of the drive.

In the case of the RN of WWII many reservists would be very good at basic
shiphandling, because after leaving the Navy (and joining the reserves)
they went into related jobs - fishing, costal trading, etc.

In the 3I this could well be the case, as well, with the reservists having
jobs on shuttles and in-system shipping. This means that while they may be
a bit rusty with the guns, etc their other skills will be pretty good.

One can probably think of tricks to make the rendezvous harder to
detect. For example, put a big honkin tractor (TNE/T4) on the
pirate base to reel ships in without having them use any of their
own fuel...I also haven\'t really done the analysis for how far away
from the base you\'re likely to arrive due to usual jump errors (some
TU\'s would have jump errors be bigger that far from a big mass); 
maybe an ion drive or chemical drive could get you to the base.
(Using HEPlaR would be like writing "come and kill me" in big letters
even if you only used it for a few minutes...)

Michael, they look good and printed out just fine.  It seemed like the size of the Twain.pdf file went way up, I might be wrong as I was downloading it through a dialup this time rather than a faster network connection.

Good sketch.

Most of a local year inner planets are going to be occluded by the
primary\'s hyperlimit.  This will mean ships will spend a good bit of
time travelling insystem irregardless.

he/she/it was trying to impersonate, the transponder wouldn\'t respond
appropriately to being interrogated by the IFF, and would therefore be
marked as hostile.

Including those ship owners who find themselves facing ship repossession
due to default on the ship mortgage, and crews who think that mutiny and
piracy would, **_in their case_** (the odds being, of course against
them) be more profitable than their current wages, not many.  But a few.

One or two, per sector, per _decade_, pulling off a sufficiently
profitable heist might serve to inspire enough morons to give piracy a
shot.  Most pirates would quickly perish, but one or two _might_ succeed
in a newsworthy heist.  Those who perish quickly still count as pirates
during their (deservedly) short career.

I don\'t think that piracy (as distinct from commerce raiding,
privateering, etc.) is worth the effort.  I merely point out that, given
the vast number of starships out there in private hands, some folks will
decide that they can beat the odds, and succeed in piracy.  Whether they
succeed or not doesn\'t keep them from trying.

I\'m sorry. Recent evidence shows that the Royal Oak was scuttled by her

They don\'t even run *that* hot. Since the goal is to keep the inside of
the Shuttle at room temp, that means that the radiators are at room
temp or only a bit above. 

Remember, only in designs where you need to play games with stealth
will the radiators *not* be the lowest temp part of the system! To get
them *not* to be the lowest temp part requires running active
refrigeration, which greatly complicates things.

Also, they aren\'t all that "dinky" they cover the *entire* inner
surface of the bay doors.

Sunlight loading is a problem, but not a major one. Remember that
equilibrium temp at 1 AU is below freezing. The big problem is that the
crew, life support, and electronics pump out a *lot* of heat.

I kinda figure that the really high power systems have their own
radiators that operate at very high temps, partly because the extra
efficiency gained by having the "sink" end of things at a lower temp
isn\'t worth the increased area. 

So the power plant may well have small radiators that are *literally*
white hot. After all, that\'s only about 3000 K, and with the "source"
end at several million K, the diff between 300 K and 3000 K isn\'t worth
the hassle.

Weapons and possibly thrusters would maybe have red-hot radiators. And
life support would have ice-cold radiators. But the majority of the
signature would be from the red-hot and white-hot ones.

Oh goody - a KKM debate to go with the fighter debate and the piracy

"if the bloody things get through", of course, is the hard part -
for reasonable laser technology
(let alone the really good lasers in GT or just-plain-T) hitting an
incoming kinetic impact missile is remarkably easy; certainly for the
space/price of a figher you can fit in a point defence laser that
can eat up many many times its weight in impact missiles (at least
in FFS2; but presumably also in GURPS - it\'ll be interesting to try
this once I get a copy of GURPS.)

small(only 3 hexes) and she had heavy armor (IIRC DR4000) so she was only
crippled.

Perfect. Just what I was looking for. Many thanks.

So with one station, it takes about two weeks to scan the sky. A pirate
ship is detectable for about a day every rendezvous, which gives a 1/14
chance of being detected, about a 93% chance of being undetected. For two
rendezvous, the chance of remaining undetected is 93%^2 = 86%, and so on. 
If I\'ve done my math correctly, that means that after ten rendezvous there
is better than a 50% chance that the base has been detected. Hardly a
long-term proposition.

This also has implications for deep-penetration spy bases.

Heck, if the base is on/in a really big ice chunk all the ship has
to do is fire a harpoon attached to a line into the iceball and
either the base or the ship can reel the two together.  No muss, no
fuss, low energy approach.

IMTU, of course, that base has to be near a brown dwarf or gas
giant.

Design by George MacLure, text be me (Robert Prior), editing by DGP (Joe
or Gary, I think). Given the amount of editing and feedback, the coauthor
status is appropriate. Illustration was down after I wrote my text, and I
was happy enough with it.

The Sydkai was intended to operate for months without resupply. Optimized
is correct -- George optimized that ship down to the cubic metre. We had
noticed that the standard naval designs had short durations and required a
fair amount of logistical support, so we came up with a vessel optimized
for patrolling and sufficiently armed for fighting pirates.

Me for one. My employer (Unilever) wouldn\'t take nicely to the volume of
traffic on this list, so I connect from home.

I know Nick Munn (those TML fogey\'s around will know the name) doesn\'t
connect as he works from the UK civil service and they tend to get a little
jumpy about usage, and topics like nukes, sensors, encryption etc. Shame -
I miss some of his comments.

Unfortunately, this is very common in the industry. I had to wait almost

written for them.

ps. I will note SJG does NOT follow industry trend, and pays on time.
Thus, you should see more GURPS:Traveller material coming out in their

You know that is not posible.  I\'ve already eat my crow on this subject
thank you.  I do not care for left overs (Grin).

Seriously though I did learn a lot about current astrological tech. I did
not know.  It was worth the effort for that alone.  Now that I have the
background theory I makes sence.  I still am curious about the integration
time require for 3 ls detection of a scout ship.

Not really.  The only list I\'m aware of is a general one, it gets
quite technical at times, but isn\'t like TTL, it\'s more like
TML...only with a *very* broad range of topics (and a low signal to
noise ratio, IMO).  It\'s a free list, btw, not part of Pyramid.  

The on-line boards that require a Pyramid subscription aren\'t
particularly interesting to me because they only do online reading

No, you shouldn\'t pay for the subscription for that reason.  Not

What Doug said.  There is a lot of value here, whether you play
GURPS or not.  In the last few months, there have been two *very*
good Traveller articles.  The archives have a number of general
adventures that can be adapted to Traveller...one that really
interested me was aimed at a 1930\'s adventure in Central America,
but set it on a jerkwater planet in the Deep (or Marches) and it
would work just as well.  Then there are the product reviews, news
and...

Well, almost.  ;-> Ken Hite\'s column is good, but I\'m not sure I\'d
pay $15 a year *just* for that.  However, it does contribute to the
worth of the subscription.

I don\'t bother with the message boards because I can\'t read and
reply offline.  ;->

I never make it to the weekly "chats" because of my work schedule,
but I enjoy reading the transcripts.  You know there have been
several chats about non-SJG games, the new Star Trek game comes to
mind.  I bet SJG would be happy to arrange conferences where
Travellerites could discuss things Traveller.  Maybe Marc could tell
us about T5 at one.

Don\'t get me wrong I liked the illustration well enough, I just couldn\'t
see where the revolving loader was loacated. Ever do deck plans for that

One able to survive some rigorous treatment.  20000k is a lot of heat.  What
happens when this ship lands in water?  The vane will make a tempting target
for laser gunners.  No vane no power.  The ship would burn up without it if
the reater is running.  If you use those efficency numbers.

  This may not be that much of a problem for HG/Striker: 1 HG EP is 252MW
from Striker (@TL F, 14m^3 of fuser gets 6mw/cube x3 for volume efficiency
for 18 ea., or 252 total). Later you start to realize that energy weapons
are assumed to be firing continuously throughout every second of a combat
turn (and presumably so with spacecraft?) even though beam lasers only have
+2 to hit over a low ROF large bore CPR gun (and +1 of that should be long-
range accuracy over ballistic rounds).

  Thus, you could probably reduce fusion plant output by 75% and reduce
energy weapon ROF by a similar degree without too much difficulty. This
also makes batteries that much more practical for use in HG.

Then why have transponders say anything other than that?  If you can record

If I were in your campaign, I would set my transponder to say that I was an

Ok, I\'ve revised the fonts and attempted to imbed them. I\'ve also added the

Any way, please try the files again and let me know it they work all right.

No I did not, The thermalelectrics were ment to cut signature by
suplimenting the battery power so that less power would need to be draw from
the batteries.  Discharging batteries causes true waste heat.  Reusing power
by partial heat recovery does not produce any more waste heat than the heat
caused by the use of that power.  It is more efficient than battery power as
far as waste heat is concurned but because the system is loosing heat into
space you will need to replace that lost power from the batteries but not as
much as you would have to without the heat recovery system.

The idea is to reduce the heat signature too 300k or less by running only on
battery power.  No operating fussion plant.

Thing is, HG lets you do odd-sized hulls.  A size code 9 ship is anything from 
900 to 999 tons.  Just watch your decimal points.

That, too.

Note that if you increase the number of lasers and missile proportionally
the lasers pull ahead (since each laser can engage each missile, albeit
at the increasing minuses...) If you manage the sequences right, X 
laser turrets will pretty much always stop 2*X missiles...

Is this really the way triple turrets work? This needs to be clarified.
I assumed that if a single gunner fires all three lasers in a triple
turret he/she made a to-hit roll independently, with no modifiers, for
each. Otherwise (as you note) triple turrets are near-useless.

By Sunbeard, I meant career pirate. "Sunbeard, Scourge of Seven Sectors.
Har!" Career meaning like 5+ term pirate.  I find it more than plausible the
odd merchant can\'t keep up w/ his payments, etc and decides to start preying
on his competitors, (or gets shanghaied), etc. Eventually he either gets
caught, "retires", or gets dead, though, even on the fringe.  And it\'s more
than possible that megacorporate raiders as well as the possible forces of the
brigandish member-world (soon to be visited by the IN), though the megacorp
raiders are likely to have an "out" in their contract.  To say nothing of the
foreign (Zho, Solomani, etc) raiders who are better described as privateer.

Yes, *in that particular essay.*  In the header, first paragraph... "At their

IMO, none of those are credible for disecting the economics of the Third
Imperium (or any polity of the OTU).  It\'s obvious GDW didn\'t use Striker or
TCS (or anything even remotely resembling Pocket Empires) in creating the
background.  All of them are made to be playable *games* (specificially games
for players to have pet "pocket empires" and polities and go to war w/ each
other) and to not simulate "reality" (such as it is) for the OTU.

I like this idea. Could we assume that unbaffled drives are fairly bright,
getting brighter with age? "Jumpflash baffles" are extra equipment that
reducing the signature of the flash. (Let the gearheads define the
performance parameters.) 

As to jump signature, treat that like sonar signatures now: it takes a
skilled professional to discriminate. Most civilians won\'t even know how,
because they don\'t need to know, while experienced navy sensor ops can
sometimes tell you not only who you are but what brand of parts you used
in your last overhaul.

In game terms:

To identify a ship from its jump signature
Edu + Sensor Ops > Impossible
This task is one to two levels easier if the operator is familiar with the
target, one level more difficult of the operator has _not_ had military
training or experience.

I posted something a fair while ago (12 months) that was a query in from
one of my games about how Aslan would consider casual sexual relationships.
It all happened at Dinomn when the Empress Nicholle got into port, and the
female Aslan engineer was bored with all the humans and disappeared... the
thread kind of degenerated after a few interesting posts (Wildstar\'s being
one of the most memorable).

Sure, but if you\'re shooting is any good your target is going to
know ding-dang well where you\'re at, so I don\'t see the reason for
hiding from your target once you start shooting.  ;-> Ok, I really
do, and having radiators scattered around the hull is a good idea.

No question about that.

My approach is to use a different technology for in-system maneuver,
but that only works for heretics like me ;-> For people that use
HEPlaR, or for that matter TPlates, a maneuvering ship is going to
be *very* detectable from at least one direction.  All I can suggest
is to postulate very good baffling to limit the area of exhaust
plume exposure.

That and being able to bank the fusion engine back to single digit
power levels when you aren\'t maneuvering or using weapons.

I will not retrofit the T-Plate efficiency onto MT as I run it. IMO, it
defeats too much previous cannon (including TCS, to some degree), is ill
thought, and makes no sense. IMTU, True Recationless Thrusters push against
themost significant gravity wells, and thus the objects creating them, and
thus truly are not reactionless, but use the mass of planets, stars, dark
matter, interstellar gasses, etc., as reaction mass. Just like IMTU, a
repulsor CAN be used for fine maneuving in docks.

Since I don\'t run TNE anymore (the combat system is BROKEN, and I\'ve tried
dozens of fixes, and just don\'t like any of them), and don\'t  like T4
except for the Psionics rules and number of skills per term, my players
don\'t expect me to use "questionable" items from the newer canon. If I were
running T4, I\'d use the limits, and if T5 has the limits, when running T5
I\'ll use the limits.

TL 9 anti-grav-thrusters are limited to about 1000 diameters, and no full
thrust after 100 diameters, and I limit gravitic modules (vehicular type)

Gurps is pretty much the same.  With a good gunners and tageting software
it\'s 1 laser one dead missle per turn.  The only way to get misile hits is a
large salvo that closes fast enough to overwhelm the defenses.  It is doable
but not very cost effective.  Those misiles are pricy.

I have my book with me so I looked it up.  I was just reading the space
combat section when this came up.

Do to turn limits in the combat situation you have to shoot a ship or a
missle but not both with each laser.  A scout with one triple laser turret
fired on by 9 missles from 2 seconds out will be hit by three missles if the
gunners involved do not miss.

1st second shoot three misiles  (likely but not curtain)  gunner skill 15 +
15 accuacy +4 aiming +10 computer (very good comp.) +2 active sensor +10
defensive fire  +4 rof =60 - 41 for range 1 = 19  You must role less the 21
on three d6 but 17 and 18 always fail.

With this you can have a 10 or less to kill a missle at 30 hexes.  The
problem is how fast are the misile moving 1g = 1 hex per second accel.
misiles have 6g/TL10 10g/TL12 and a 3 space combat turn duration.

2nd second shoot three missles and get hit by the other three. range 0 role
to hit = 21

3 missles hit if missle gunner role his success number.

missile cost 22kcr each.

small items (125L boxes {25cm cubes}).

*** assumes pallatized loads that are secure on the pallet. Iv\'e moved up
to a 1/2 ton pallet of icecream at the rates shown, moving the goods from
loose to a pallet 2m from the shelves, while in a -10c freezer. Moving the
pallet the 10-15 meters to shrink-wrap took another 2 minutes on average,
including opening and closing the 1/4-ton sliding door. Shrink wrap took
another 5 minutes, and then it was a fairly stable unit. The guys who
worked the wharehouse (I worked the co-located icecream plant) could load
and move faster than I could. BTW, a 1/2ton pallet of ice cream is about 2m
tall, and uses a 1.5x1.5m pallet which is about 7-12 cm tall it\'s self,
weighing about 10kg. Lined up pallets go on trucks at the loading-dock at
the rate of about 1-2 per minute, depending on skill and depth of refer
van, at least that\'s what I\'ve seen done. A full van can be unloaded to the
dock (which is level with the floor of the reefer van floor) in under 15
minutes for a fully palletized load in a 40\' trailer. And about as long to
get the load into the freezer, using about 5 men for each task.

Actually, you can do the same thing if you restrict the really high

No, try a setup where long range transport is little used (with high
tech communications, you don\'t need to move *people* around very fast,
and materials aren\'t in a big rush). And where folks are much more into
"appropriate technology". 

Sort of like the situation in the "Tinker" culture under the Peace
Authority in Vinge\'s "The Peace War". 

*No* heavy industry. But "cottage" electronics and related fields give
you a super internet, as well as all sorts of sustainable *very* high
tech, but low volume, low power gizmos. 

Picture a culture with a planetwide comm and computer net, much of it
using dedicated fiber lines (ie no signature worth mentioning), long
range transport mostly wind, water and muscle powered, with higher tech
vehicles scattered around, but limited to stuff that *can* be
maintained without a heavy industrial base.

So you\'d have sailing ships, dirigibles, some aircraft, some CG
vehicles (after all electronics *can* be maintained with "light"
industry, and the structural stuff can be kept to "blacksmith" level.
The "engines" are the hard part). 

Likewise, large "heavy" weapons would be uncommon, but personal and
"squad" level weapons would be as good as any in the galaxy.

Basicly, think of the tech as limited to what a "garage" level machine
shop (or electronics fab) can handle. With several of each in every
village. 

Population centers would be limited to village/small town. And there\'d
be a *few* places building larger items. 

Such a setup could maintain a very high tech level. They\'d just be
*lightly* industrialized. They might be able to produce a starship of
as much as a few hundred tons. But that\'d require doing some tooling up
at the larger towns, and the rate of constructiion would be low. But
the smaller the item, the easier it\'d be to build locally.

As far as *small* items, treat them like Afghani gunsmiths. Hand a
local "techsmith" a weapon, or electronics package, and in a week or
two, he\'s likely to hand you back *two*, and you may have trouble
determining which is the original. 

ps. I know it\'s not as *efficient* to have a "backyard" size chip
foundry. But it *is* doable. We just don\'t have the incentive. Another
culture might be willing to go with the higher costs as a valid
trade-off for keeping things locally supportable.

It\'d be a *weird* culture from our point of view. And it\'d be *damned*
hard to conquer. Probably more trouble than it\'s worth. Which may be
the whole idea.

I think that you misunderstood what he was saying.  Reservists by nature are
NOT out in the space lanes in their ships.  An example of Reserve activity
would be that they meet one weekend a month and go active for two weeks in
the summer.  This would then cause one to believe that the ships of the
Reserve Fleet are ALMOST moth-balled and would take some time to bring
on-line.  Reservists routinely take they active duty period fixing up there
"vehicles" and training to maintain their standards for going to war.  You
would see the occasional Reserve Ship out and about just so they can blow
the cob webs out.  Think for a minute, if you are only on active duty for
two weeks and a jump takes one week then you would only be able to take your
ship out and right back and be done for the year.

    'body' => 'Luriani Subcultures

Two distinct subcultures exist within Luriani society: the Verasti Dtareen and 
the Mmarislusant. Both of these subcultures are the result of the incorporation 
of non-Luriani humans into Luriani society. The Verasti Dtareen are the 
descendants of Admiral Martinezs fleet and Solomani settlers from the Rule of 
Man era. Whilst the Mmarislusant are the descendants of the Vilani colonists 
planted amongst the Luriani during the Vilani occupation.

The Mmarislusant

The Luriani word Mmarislusant literally translates as victims of history. During 
the Ziru Sirka numerous Vilani were settled on the Luriani worlds in an attempt 
to assimilate the Luriani. These attempts proved to be fruitless, but the 
colonists remained when the First Protectorate was formed and presented a 
unique problem for the new state. The solution adopted is an interesting 
example of the Luriani Code of Honour. While the Luriani bore (and continued to 
bear even into the late 3rd Imperium) a grudge against the Ziru Sirka, the 
Luriani could not hold these individual Vilani responsible for the actions of their 
government. Similarly, the Tenets of Hospitality required that while they were 
not regarded as citizens, they had to be treated as honoured guests. Thus, the 
Protectorate went to considerable lengths to ensure that these Vilani were able 
to continue their lives as before. State funded Vilani schools were established 
and great efforts were made to encourage the Vilani to retain their distinct 
identity. As a result the Mmarislusant preserve much of the original culture and 
language of the Ziru Sirka and are closer to it than most supposedly traditional 
Vilani elsewhere.

Over time, the Mmarislusant came to be valued members of Luriani society, 
well respected for their bureaucratic and diplomatic skills. In 1372 citizenship 
was extended to them and they were gradually incorporated into the 
administrative structure of the Protectorate. By the founding of the Second 
Protectorate in 8, they had come to regard themselves as members of Luriani 
society and had become an important part of government and corporate life 
within it. It is interesting to note that with the incorporation of the Protectorate 
into the Third Imperium, the Mmarislusant have resisted all efforts to reintegrate 
them into mainstream Vilani culture.

The Verasti Dtareen

The term Verasti Dtareen is usually translated as Terran Protectors or 
Protectors from Terra. Unlike the Mmarislusant the Verasti Dtareen were 
regarded as members of Luriani society from the founding of the First 
Protectorate. The Verasti Dtareen provided the Protectorate with the vital 
administrative skills required to manage an interstellar state. Initially they also 
formed the bulk of the Protectorates military forces. However, as the 
Protectorate evolved they were gradually replaced in this role by Luriani, but 
they came to form the administrative core of society, providing it with a stability 
and focus it had previously lacked.

The Verasti Dtareens culture is an intriguing fusion of Luriani and Solomani 
traditions. Exposure to the Luriani has resulted in their adoption of many Luriani 
cultural norms (such as group marriages and the Luriani Code of Honour). In 
many ways the Verasti Dtareen are a less extreme version of the Luriani. They 
are prone to displays of emotion that most Solomani would feel uncomfortable 
with, they are strongly drawn towards music and the arts, and they hold to the 
Luriani precepts of honour. However they are also expected to behave with far 
greater restraint than would be expected of a Luriani, and retain many cultural 
rituals from their Solomani heritage.

You\'re using some other stuff rather than straight HG.  Under HG, your hull 
costs the same whether it\'s mild steel or ferrocement or superdense.  Cost of 
materials is factored into it already.  If you\'re gonna evaluate a HG design, 
set your FS&S on the coffee table and take stuff right from HG.  I see the 
figures for armour bulk as reasonable for HG as it factors in \'inferior\' 
materials at lower tech levels.  The lower your tech, the more bulk you need 
to get the same armour protection on your hull and the more bracing you need 
because your \'state of the art\' is still under developement.

I based my statement on US Reservists, i.e. 1 weekend a month and 2
weeks a year.
at this rate the ships would not be able to leave orbit and get the
crews back to thier regular jobs in time.  If the reserves work
differently IYTU then I made a bad assumption.

I think we are talking different time frames.  and I agree that one

it is actually a contest of skills for the pilot of the ship and the

what Charles neglects to mention is the effects of velocity on damage...if
there is only a modest vector differnce between the ship and the missile
(say 5 hexes) even one can do massive damage to a scout....

the missile (best case only one gets through) will do 6dx500 (5). the scout
has DR 200, so effective DR is 40....assuming average damage for the

take 6 critical hits (6 rolls on the major damage table) almost certan to

	I guess I\'ll rise to the bait on this one as well:  A Fed CA/CC is one of the
few starships in SFB to be able to withstand a full alpha strike on the #1
shield (no shield reinforcement assumed) by another CA/CC/DN and STILL be
combat-capable.  This ability is also shared by some Hydran vessels (the Cen
Hull hits for the Hydrans and the Labs for the Feds, acting as the "7th

	I have proved this (usually to everyones amazement) many many times; as for
credentials, I have been playing SFB since before the supplements came out
(the little books that is), as well as being a member of Battle Group Phoenix
(TFG playtest group for SFB) for 2 years and becoming a Rated Ace in 1994.

 If you want to nitpik everything to death then you\'ll need too start
footnoting everything you say as well.  I still have not gotten threshold

scout can radiate 10MWs of heat per second as some say it does.  If you want
do carry on this discussion under the debating rules I can do that.  We will
both have to start by proving our primices.  Can you prove a 100MW power

killing the crew?

IIRC MT fusion plants use about 0.05 kl/hr/MW, maybe divided by 3 because
of efficiency for 0.01667 kl/hr. FF&S1 fusion plants use about 0.1
kl/year/MW which is about 1500 times more efficient.

So what limit, if any, do you put on the distance from a gravity source
that a T-plate can be and still function? If it\'s 1000 or 2000 diameters a
misjump of more than a few hundred AU will kill a T-plate ship\'s crew far
more certainly than a HEPlaR\'s, especially as the HEPlaR fuel supply may be
enough to allow a jump.

As Charles has pointed out, the Reserve Fleet is just that HELD IN RESERVE.
Reservists (by today\'s standards and I can\'t see why it would change at all)
spend two weeks on active duty a year.  They meet one weekend a month.
Reservists would probably augment the IN and the sub-sector navy when on
active duty for their two weeks.  They might possibly work on their ships to
help keep them up and ready for deployment.  Either way you look at it the
Reserve Forces are not there in ANY numbers that would be of any help to the
pirate interdiction role.

No targeting laser to give the attack away.  That\'s what balistic targeting

If the attacker speed is high (.5c) then 3 seconds is about all the warning
you get from c speed sensors.  Range is not that important, it rate of
closure that count.  If you close in three second for the detection point 3
second is all they get but this is a mute point anyway.  The sensor
discussion killed this type of pirate anyway.

True but what about mercinary companies?  Where do pirates start any way?

But that is mute.  The sensor discussion did it for me.  A system with a
good sensor array and a few well stationed SDBs out at about 50 dias. would
be pirate proof to all but a AHL class pirate making a full scale attack and
short of a really improbable mutiny that is not going to happen.

You win.  Pirate don\'t work in defended systems.

You\'re misinterpreting an ambiguous word. The reserves in Corridor are
the regular ships stationed in Corridor. What you call the mothball fleet

What I meant was that you have to start the run in before your intended

How did you get the higher initial speed if not by accelerating? And before
you cliam that you built up the speed before you jumped into the system,
that means your timing problem becomes even bigger.

One explanation (not canonical, but compatible with canon) is that jumpspace
navigation lets you aim for a spot relative to any sufficiently large
gravity point source.

Well, the rules differ slightly from version to version. Another version is
7 days +- 1 day.

I think that is right in at least one version of the rules (maybe more).
OTOH this effect is totally ignored in other versions. I don\'t think it
has ever been mentioned as part of the background events.

Sometimes they are and sometimes they\'re not. Subsector fleets are sometimes
used for both kinds of numbered fleet, both the regular and the colonial.
But in other cases it is used for that fleet which is raised and maintained
by the subsector, and that is the colonial or, as it is also sometimes
called, the Imperial Reserve fleet.

Right. Individual planets pay 30% of their military budget to the Imperium.
The subsector government retains half of that and turns over the other half
to the regular forces.

Certainly _Striker_ simplifies the matter. It says "roughly 30%" which
indicates that there may be variations in that figure or that it is not
exactly 30%. Maybe the true figure is 29% or 31%. My point is that it is
certainlynot going to be 5% or 10%.

>I\'m looking for a source other than striker to confirm the numbers.

Well, _TCS_ says Cr500 per citizen (which works out as 5% under my
assumptions) for the navy alone. So _Striker_ gives a lower figure than
TCS.

>I do not understand this comment.

Sorry. That was a bit snide. What I should have said was: The 10% maintenance
figure is a simplified one that applies to a whole navy consisting of ships
of all ages. It\'s an average. So although old ships surely cost more than 10%
to maintain, the newest ships of the navy will cost correspondingly less to
maintain.

Also, the actual physical maintenance seems to be the least of the 10%
figure. Far more goes to ship replacement, personnel, pensions, support
structures, bases, training camps, etc. So the difference is propably
not all that great.

No, I don\'t think we could get the power requirements down to
*realistic* levels, but we could (and should) lower them to more
reasonable ones. As for weapons, of course, they are going to be
*very* power hungry, and that shouldn\'t change. Ships with beam
weapons are going to need big fusion engines. OTOH, we don\'t have run
those big fusion engines at full power 24 hours a day do we? Well, it
*seems* like we always have, but I\'ve never thought that was very
reasonable.

As a mind experiment, let\'s say a 100 dton Type S Scout has an 80MW
fusion engine that it can throttle back to 5% of maximum output, so it
will always be producing 4MW while it\'s running. 

When it is drifting through space with minimal life support, using
passive sensors and maintaining only a trickle charge to the drives or
weapons, let\'s say, it *requires* only 2 MW\'s. So maybe it turns off
the fusion engine and runs off of stored power (fuel cells, batteries,
powercells, etc) only occasionally powering the engine back up to
recharge the batteries, or, if your TU won\'t allow for turning fusion
engines on and off like gasoline engines (I wouldn\'t allow *quite*
that much leeway ;), runs the fusion engine at it\'s lowest possible
level (4MW) it can. Combined with a little stealthing shouldn\'t that
drop the range of detection *way* down?

Now, if our Scout uses it\'s drives, active sensors, or *heaven forbid*
it\'s weapons, it will increase it\'s power consumption, and have to
stoke the fusion engine up to higher levels. Suddenly, it\'s a "hotter"
object visible on sensors at a longer range, but not necessarily from
every direction. 

If the power is going mainly to the drives, and the drives dispose of
*most* of the extra energy in one direction..aft, then our Scout\'s
detection level might not go up much in any direction except from the
rear. 

IMO, active sensors should be like spotlights, in that where ever the
ship aims them it can resolve a target much better, but is also much
easier to detect. 

Beam weapons are a different case. I suspect they will never be all
that efficient, so a lot of the power they consume will have to be
dealt with separately. Putting special high-temp radiators on their
turrets, in their bays, and around their spinal mounts is probably the
best way to handle them, too.  In any case, a ship using beam weapons
should light up like a Christmas Tree, but that doesn\'t bother me in
the least. Once the firing starts all bets are off anyway.

You\'re right. I can\'t understand how I missed that. I looked it over
specifically to find it and still missed it. My brain must have tuned it
out. The human mind is a funny thing... and I don\'t mean funny ha ha.

Apparently I\'m not the only one whose brain tunes out things it dosen\'t want
to notice. Later in the same line you quote it says "(usually three to 10
squadrons per fleet)". Usually. Usually dosen\'t mean always. So the 50 ship
fleets could have unusual numbers of fleets. For that matter, although the
text says that squadrons at most have 10 similar ships, we have one canonical
example of oversized squadrons, so that isn\'t as set in stone as you think,
either.

That\'s your opinion, and you\'re welcome to it. My arguments are based on the
assumption that it is canonical.

>The econ stuff was obviously not thought through the background.  

Oh, you noticed that, did you? Only it is the other way around. That part of
the background that has the Imperium, an interstellar state surrounded by
several hostile states of the same order of magnitude as itself spending
about one third of what Canada does today on it\'s defense, is the part that
wasn\'t thought through. The figures in _Striker_ were thought through (well,
maybe not thought through, just taken from the real world). That\'s the true
problem with _Striker_ and _TCS_. Not that they say something inconsistent
with other parts of the canon, but that the other parts of the canon are
implausible. If I thought a defense budget of 0.5% made sense then I\'d be
the first to advocate lowering the _Striker_ figures to match the other
parts of the canon. I addressed that very point in another part of the
same post. Maybe your brain tuned it out?

Well, that settles it, I guess. You don\'t think they are credible. In that
case those of us who thinks they are credible should obviously realize that
your opinion is more valuable than ours and shut up. I see it all so clearly
now.

I suppose it would be too much to expect your Illustrious Savantcy to provide
us stupid morons with credible figures to base our future calculations on?

In other words, Gary, if you don\'t think the _Striker_ figures are credible,
then you obviously must have some figures that you think are. I mean, I can\'t
for a moment imagine that the only reason you don\'t think them credible is
that that would force you to acknowledge that the subsection of the Traveller
background you like has a few glitches here and there.

>It\'s obvious GDW didn\'t use Striker or TCS (or anything even remotely
>resembling Pocket Empires) in creating the background. 

Obviously not. If they had, the problem wouldn\'t exist.

>All of them are made to be playable *games* (specificially games for

All of them were made to be playable games based on the Traveller background.
You may as well claim that each of the adventures were made to be a playable
adventure and not to reflect reality "such as it is" for the OTU. That rather
misses the point. The true value of the Traveller Universe to me is that I
can mine it for background material for my personal TU. As such the historical
background and adventures are important to me. And it is especially important
to me that they are mutually consistent. And that is why, as important as the
background is, the underlying rules and mechanics IMO are even more important,
because if they are in order, they will force _future_ Traveller authors
to produce stuff that is also compatible. Otherwise we get one author having
four KINUNIR class ships defending a whole subsector while the neighboring
is defended by several BatRons. We get planets with 50 inhabitants buying
50,000 T monitors, we get low population empires giving multi-billion empires
a hard time, etc. And, in the present case, we get authors who write an
adventure involving small mercenary actions calculating a world\'s military
forces from _Striker_ and getting one result and authors writing a smuggling
adventure getting the same figures from _FFW_ and getting two different
results.

Maybe you think that keeping a mismatched puzzle piece, thus ensuring that
the picture can never be complete, is preferable to losing one or two of
your favorite pieces. That\'s a matter of opinion. We disagree. Fine. But
when you berate me for advocating trimming some of the pieces to make them
fit on the grounds that a) They fit, only I am too stupid to realize that,
or b) they belong to a different picture, then I come close to losing my
patience with you.

Sorry, light is not my normal band.  It\'s been a few years sence my last
major optical design project.  Most things that can be done with light can
be done cheaper and easier in other ways in the areas that I work in at
least.  Most of my work requires real time data with loop times of a second
or less.

Yeow! Thats one big mother!  Just out of curiousty and as an adventure seed,
what kind of salvage could be gotten from such an array?  As in credit per
ton of the array or support equipment like computers salvaged?  What type of
computer would this base need to run the array?  The rest of the bases gear
would be standard stuff I would assume.  Say if one of these sensor bases
were knocked out with a bioweapon by an enemy spy during a war and the PC
hear a rumor and decide to collect the Credit and accidentally bring back
the bioweapon as well. (Evil grin)

Bruce they are not magic.  No more so that your photo integration technique.
Look in any Omega temperture catalog for simple examples.  They are called
thermal couples.  They do not absorb much heat they just produce electicity
in the presents of heat by converting the molecutar motion caused by heat
into electron motion.  It is a standard condition of dissimiler junctions.
You were right about your baliwick and I admited it once I had the hard
data.  Look at a thermal couple catalog and you will see their basic
operation is as I have discribed.  The why is real long and technical as it
gets into the nature of matter and was part of the theory I was taught 15
years ago in coledge.  This effect is being harness in the last few years to
produce solid state devices that can heat or cool and devices that when
exposed to a heat gradiant produce a decent amount of power, as compared to
basic thermal couples.  When just heated they produce less power.  There is
no magic.  The efficency of these devices is low in the power production
mode.  (less that 10% and varies greatly with type and designed for application)

As for the electricity it goes back into the system to allow a lower total
drain on the batteries.  I supposed a ship running only on batteries to cut
its signature.  The converters were to reuse some of the heat to limit
battery draw and the waste heat associated with battery discharge.  It would
be better to reuse the heat than just waste it.  In effect though you only
reduce the total signature by part of the theoritical saving as when the
heat signature drops, power from the converters drop as well and the power
used per second by the system for work would remain constant once
homeostasis is reached.  Depending on the performance curves of year 5000
thermoelectic devices the heat signature saving could be as high as half the
battery\'s waste heat.  If you insulated the battery compartment and lined it
with thermoelectrics you might see less saving at a considerable cost saving
over lining the hull.  Doing both would produce the best results but cost
the most.

Why do you find the concept fo thermoelectic devices so odd?  You already
work with one of their relatives the photoelectric device.  Thermoelectric
devices are just IR tuned solar cells in theory in practise their makeup is
simpler in some ways and different in others do to a much greater temperture
range.

The current market has been using thermoelectric cooler/heaters for the last
3 years that I am aware of.  Those warmer/ice chests that plug into your
cigerete lighter was one of the first consumer products to use this tech.

The cost/effeciency problem (like with solar cells) are keeping their market
presence low.  Until price per watt drops by a facter of 1000 or more you
are not likly to see these devices outside research labs or satalites.  Oh,
did I mention that one of the other variation on this theme is used in
nuclear batteries?  They are all basicly the same concept.  Some form of
energy is use to push the electron accross the potential barrier of the
junction and free it to flow as electricity.

As others have told you, the Imperial Reserve Fleets are not that kind of
reserves. The term is confusing and I suggest using \'colonial\' instead.
Colonial fleets are raised and supported at the subsector level and not
stationed outside their subsectors except in emergencies whereas the
regular fleets are raised Imperium-wide and stationed wherever there is
need of them. That\'s the only difference. You can have as long and
illustrious a full-time career in the colonial fleets as you can in the
regular. And the same goes for the planetary navies, for that matter.
There does not even seem to be any difference in your chances of getting
a particular mission nor of getting decorations and promotions, though I
admit that that is rather implausible and should propably be considered
a misleading effect of the CGS. 

Back when I was playing in a TCS campaign I did talk to my Referee about
just that kind of reserves, and we worked out several different levels of
preparedness for my ships. Unfortunately I can\'t recall the specifics and
my files are on some floppies somewhere. The lowest was mothballed (pumped
full of inert gas and stuck inside asteroids). That had an initial cost, I
forget how much (1%?), but no 1% per year upkeep. Reactivating took a
complete refit (25% of original cost). The 1% per year was sticking them in
a parking orbit with a caretaker crew and giving them an annual maintenance.
That needed the 10% refit from canon rules to get it going. Maintaining
reserves like you are thinking of (except they spent one month instead of
two weeks each year) cost, I think, 2%. They could be activated without a
refit, but still needed time to train a crew. Having  a full-time crew
working six identical ships two months each in rotation cost 4% but meant
that they could be activated almost overnight, with a 1/6th trained crew as
cadre for each.

It dosen\'t matter how they work IMTU. What I am trying to discuss is how
they work or at least may mork in the OTU.

I\'m ignoring the two non-Piper books, and sticking with the three books
by Piper. BTW, the third Piper book when it was finally unearthed
(several years after those "sequels" to the first two) makes it pretty
likely that the Fuzzies are native (for that matter, certian biological
details in the first two books made it rather likely).

We actually have two *interesting* results in the third Fuzzy book.
You see, as part of the trial of the "fuzzy fagin" people from book 2,
it becomes necessary to show that Fuzzies can lie, otherwise it won\'t
be possible to veridicate them. 

Trying to teach Fuzzies to lie almost drives the human pyschs nuts, and
does come rather close to threatening the stability of a couple of
Fuzzies.

Well, I think they\'d be a great addition to Traveller. Of course, the
legal situation makes them unlikely to ever be official, but we can
have fun. I once started to work them up for my D&D campaign. Picture a
party of adventurers suddenly surrounded by a bunch of 2-foot tall
Fuzzies bearing the sort of "choppo-diggos" shown on the book covers.
:-) 

Oh yes, the original Hoka stories by Poul Anderson & Gordon R. Dickson
have been re-released ("Hoka! Hoka! Hoka!"). They are another race fit
to drive characters nuts. Having both Fuzzies *and* Hokas in the same
campaign might be a bit much. :-)

Getting back to Fuzzies though, I can see them mostly winding up in the
Scouts. They\'d make a great partner on a "one man" Scout. I\'m not sure
how they\'d do in Army or Marines. Navy is another possibility as is
Merchant and "Rogue".

For a truly *silly* bit of cross-threading, it occurs to me that a
standard "Free Trader" or "Fat Trader" could *easily* hold an entire
Fuzzy *clan*. Maybe the Fuzzies are the "Space Gypsies". It\'d be a
*lot* more practical for them, given that a 2 foot Fuzzy requires
1/27th the space, air and food that a 6 foot human does (actually,
given that they\'d need a higher metabolism to maintain body heat, even
*with* their fur we might want to double or even triple those figures).
With automated cargo handling (pretty much a given) their size wouldn\'t
be a handicap.

I also like the interesting possibilities during negotiations:

Broker: Excuse me?
Captain: Sorry, we just saying you got much good stuff here.

:-)

Also, going by stuff from Piper\'s books I expect to see a lot of
Fuzzies in education and medicine (especially nursing and pysch rehab
work). 

Hey! That\'s it. Fuzzies in the Army/Marines are combat medics. They can
get to wounded more easily, and being small doesn\'t matter for most
first aid. 

They\'d do good in civilian rescue work too. They can get into places a
human can\'t, and they\'d be great for reassuring kids (how tend to get
into places adults can\'t). 

Other Fuzzy things to design:

.22 caliber "rifle" and "pistol".
??? caliber "heavy rifle"

I figure a .22 rifle and pistol would be normal weapons. The .22LR is
useful, and standard. I can\'t really think of any other round that
*could* be used in a "pistol" for them. A rifle in the same caliber (a
*very* cut down carbine) is still quite useful. 

The "heavy rifle" would be the Fuzzy equivalent of the 600 nitro or the
like. A standard caliber, but picked to be the heaviest that an
"average" Fuzzy can safely handle. Needed to keep them from becoming
"snacks" for the local lion equivalent. 

Fuzzy comm gear would be slightly non-standard (and more expensive)
mostly because it needs to be smaller and lighter *and* it needs to
have three "settings": normal audio, ultrasonic only, and both at once.

The ultrasound only would be useful for stealth operations. Normal only
would interoperate best with standard comm gear. And "both" would allow
for carrying on both normal and ultra communication at the same time.

<snicker>

I just had this *lovely* image pop into my head. A Fuzzy DI teaching a
survival course. During the portions of such training where you get
dumped in the wild to practice your skills, he\'s notorious for popping
up unexpectedly. Usually immediately after you\'ve done something
*stupid*. First indication you have is the Yeek! followed by some pithy
comment in pidgin (Fuzzies *can* speak proper Standard, they just don\'t
see the point except on formal occasions). 

"You think animal dumb? *Blind* animal see this is trap!"

"Oh! Maybeso you bait trap with self? Very smart... Not!"

This gives him quite a reputation, and is annoying as hell. On the
other hand, it does show that he\'s paying attention. :-)

Yep, caught that and corrected it and reposted.  (sigh, why didn\'t I catch
that the firsth time.)  Missed the pd completely though.

Damn!, missed that you can ingage different targets several times with the
same weapon.

I want a ROF 30 Gattling laser cannon for point defense.  No range to speek
of but +15 ROF fire bonus to swat misiles...lot\'s of missles.  Also good for
crowd control on planet. (Evil Grin)

not according to the table on page 173 1/2d = 10 or 13.  Max is much more.
Love that acc works out to max range.

Note: there is a miss print on the last page.  Hexes are 2000miles not 10,000.

This makes a ship with a high vector very dangerious.  His misiles move fast
and hit hard!

Misiles are nasty again in GT.

Note:  1 small nuke = radioactive gas cloud where ship use to be on a direct
hit.

I think your SDB may need some more armor.

I don\'t have my vehicle book with me.  Do you loose DR from an attack?  Only
on 6s?  How does this work?

Humm...Some extra E_banks in case you loose the reacter would be a good
design idea.  Plus a spare reacter of course.

Good point.  Misiles have gotten REAL nasty!  and the SDB need a lot more armor.

I hope to have a group up and running in a few weeks (first time I\'ll be
home) to test out some of this.

When I did "Dark Star" (issue #3 of which will hopefully come out "real soon
now" <sigh>) all I did was send a copy to Imperium Games and Marc Miller (who
actually requested a copy through the TML before his reached him!). There were
no legalistic mutterings at all. I think Eris\' comments are 100% spot on.

I am too. I thought it was my mail program, especially as I chaecked it

That would be, at a minimum, a violation of the Traveller trademark.
You need a license from Far Future Enterprises to put the Traveller
name on it.  This will apply to the whole \'zine and not just the title.

I did a couple of worlds like that a decade ago, for my Twilight\'s Peak
campaign. They break from canon, in that I placed the giants where I
wanted them for plot purposes, rather than where the Spinward Marches
sourcebooks say they should be, but then it\'s MY Traveller universe :-)

One had the primary belt being well inside the jump interdiction zone
(what I called it). The system used solar sails to boost refined ores out
to the jump limit where they were picked up by merchants.  The culture was
actually pretty reasonable, but didn\'t bother explaining things to
strangers because everyone knew that _everyone_ knew how things worked
(belts get very few tourists, so most of the belter hadn\'t met anyone from
outsystem before).

How would this affect sensors. Could the plasma be used to fill up the 
pixels in a passive sensor and therefor help the ship hide in a combat 
situation where it has already been detected and the enemy has no active
sensors.

A Soviet destroyer or cruiser attempted mutiny in the Baltic. They
*almost* made it to Swedish waters. And there are *strong* suspicions
about that Soviet sub that ran aground near Seden in the mid 80s. 

In the case of the surface ship, it was the *officers* mutinying (which
technically makes it "barratry"). This is *far* easier to get away with
once you set it up. It\'s just that in any society where the officers
would *consider* such a thing, it\'s gonna be hard to set up.

Well, the one I\'d like to see would be the Near-C rocks one. I loved the

Pournelle has written (or is still writing) "Return of Space Viking"
(working title). He hasn\'t put a lot of effort into it recently since
it\'s not terribly salable right now. Maybe in another 10 years or so
(which is about when Piper will be "rediscovered" again). 

There\'s also a sequel to "Great King\'s War" (which was a sequel to
"Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen") written, but unsold. The editors don\'t
think they\'ll sell, so the manuscripts just sit there.

I remembered your comment while out book shopping today. Upon checking
the notes inside the few Weber books I could find (they sell fast!) I
think I found out *why* "In Death Ground" is the way it is.

According to the blurbs in one of the other books, that series is based
on a computer wargame. No *wonder* it\'s solid battles.

I\'d say you should. You\'ll spoil a few things in the books you haven\'t
read.

"Security and Anti-hijacking

	"The ship comes with electronic locks. Consider installing after-market
intruder defenses (including digital cameras, motion sensors, and weapons)
and a high-security alarm system (Cr 3,000; effective skill 20). If the

Close enough? Usual rules for increased skill at the cost of increased cost

Hum, well speaking as a total layman...I know you couldn\'t put
Traveller in the title, but does it require a license to produce a
fanzine *about* a trademarked game?  If the fanzine acknowledged
trademarks and didn\'t use copywrited material, wouldn\'t it be legal
to publish fan originated material?

Umm... You are aware that the $15/year subscription to Pyramid is more than
a chance to improve SJG products, right?

In the three-odd months I\'ve been reading Pyramid on-line, I\'ve gotten
dozens of ideas for my game, decided to buy two products based on the
reviews, and been amused by John Kovalic\'s Murphy\'s Rules.

Hell, _Surpressed Transmission_ is worth the subscription cost alone.  Add
in that it\'s updated weekly, and you get a gaming magazine for 28 cents a
week!  I rarely even bother with the message boards, since I don\'t play
GURPS.

Leif,

There are 2 possible places you could have seen the 400 sdt "Fat" Trader,
either in Suppliment 7 Traders and Gunboats, or the Traveller Adventure,
large format book. The standard cargo container is 3.85 tons and typically
measures 6 x 3 x 3 meters. I have a page of these containers (suitable for
cut out and use in a 1/2 inch scale) included in my Cargo Master class Free
Trader deck plans found at my web site (address in sig.)

Let\'s see. HMS Rodney had a battleship\'s guns (16"), a BB\'s armor, and
a BB\'s speed  for the time (21 knots). I know of no historian that
would consider Rodney anything but a battleship. 

The same goes for Bismarck. She had the guns, the armor, and better
speed than a contemporary BB. Just because she had more speed than the
ones before her doesn\'t disqualify her as a BB, any more than Prince
of Wales or North Carolina wasn\'t a BB.

Dinky little radiators on the inside of the cargo bay doors (this is why
they have to open the doors within a few hours of launch.) I don\'t know how hot
they run, but probably only a hundred C or so. The shuttle\'s advantage 
is that its life support and functions only require a few kilowatts - it
has much less heat to dispose of than a traveller ship. (In fact, sunlight
heat loading might be a major part of the problem.)

I\'m not 100% sure we can redo *everything* to the point where you only
need a little power and can get by with tiny radiators, though - weapon
power, for example, will probably always include 10% waste, and always 
require lots of power. I suppose turrets could have their own dedicated
special high-temp radiators...

I guess the turret radiators could be facing away from the launch
side--you always know that at least the guy you\'re shooting at won\'t
see that radiation :-)

Drives are the other big culprit. Traveller TL15 military ships do
6gs. That\'s a lot of power.

No, the Aslan lesbians arose out of discussions of Aslan society and the
consequences of the high Female:male ratio of the race, the details of
which I remember only dimly...the debate was actually short lived, but
it was such a good addition to the tagline that it\'s sort of stuck...

Media has played a large role in one of the games I am in currently, in 
the form of one very pushy reporter. He went from being the biggest 
thorn in our side to the only NPC in the game we trusted in fairly short 
order.

In other games, knowing how the media operates in conjunction/relation 
to the government is very important. For some reason we always check 
the news channels for information. Of course, if there is a great deal of 
censorship going on, or the media is all owned, overtly or covertly, by 
one source/political persuasion/etc. then that information is suspect at 
best and should be viewed as such.

I would say that this information is important.

to post the details unless someone beats me to it. 

The same concept could be applied to jump travel in Traveller. Our three 
dimensional universe is a surface in some n-dimensional universe. Jump 
travel involves "digging" a tunnel between two points in our 3-D would 
through the other dimensions. Some force, the equivalent of gravity, 
causes the ship to travel between the points in the same length of time, 
regardless of their 3-D separation.

If the scales are likert (isn\'t that the word) then a xenophobia

That is unfortunately all too true.  Maneuver and weapons shouldn\'t
going to go down in energy consumption, but life support and
electronics can (and I think) should be reduced.  I also think the
idea of running the fusion plant at lower power levels is a good
one.

Guys, it doesn\'t much matter now if space aliens sank the Bismark
does it?

My question has always been Why?  Why, did Bismark sorte out from
it\'s harbor? The German\'s *must* have known the whole British Navy
would go after him.  They couldn\'t have thought they could take the
whole shebang on with a single ship!

Wormholes haven\'t yet been proven to exist, because they haven\'t been
observed. Blackholes have been pretty much proven, because objects which
are easily explained by black hole theory have been observed.

If you accept current theory about wormholes, and wish to postulate that
in the future larger, stable, wormholes will be able to be made, and if
you feel wormholes are a better method for interstellar travel, then by
all means use wormholes.

BUT... there\'s no need to throw Traveller Jumpdrives out the window,
just explain them using "wormhole lingo". Nobody knows how long a trip
through a wormhole would take, nor how much energy it would take to
create one. So there\'s no reason to change the way interstellar travel
in Traveller works.

Here\'s an example of wormhole theory which agrees with most Traveller
conventions:


TRAVELLER JUMPSPACE WORMHOLE THEORY
- - ----

Wormholes connect two places in realspace by "tunnelling" through an
alternate space which we call "Jumpspace". Natural wormholes have been
too small and transient to be used for interstellar travel, and were
never thought to be a viable method for travel over interstellar
distances. The discovery of Jump Drives changed that.

There are three steps necessary for a ship to create a wormhole to
travel over interstellar distances:

Firstly, a course must be plotted through jumpspace. So far,
calculations of beyond 6 parsecs have been found impossible to solve.
Though it has not yet been proven insoluble, mathematicians made it
their "holy grail" ever since Fermat\'s Last Theorem was proven.

Secondly, a jumpspace field is created around a ship in order to allow
it to enter the wormhole. Matter not within a particle field in
resonance with the wormhole cannot enter. A certain mass equivalent to
aproximately 100 displacement tons or greater is required to enter the
wormhole. Nearby gravitational masses cause the wormhole to become
unstable. As a rule of thumb, distances beyond 100 diameters from large
planetary bodies are relatively safe.

Thirdly, the jumpdrive "drills" the wormhole by creating a massive
energy pulse of exotic particles. These particles are most commonly
created through the fusing of hydrogen; the exact catalytic and doping
process is poorly understood by even the most advanced of Imperial
physicists. The particles are neutrino-like, and pass through most
matter, so building a weapon from a jump-drive is impractical at best.

TRAVEL
- - ----

The ship enters the wormhole, and travels to its calculated destination.
Since the wormhole has been plotted to the destination before entry, the
destination cannot be changed once the ship enters jumpspace.

Time to travel any distance through the wormhole is relatively
invariant, being 168 hours +/- 10%. A ship entering the wormhole is
acted upon by a constant "acceleration" to the midpoint of the trip and
a constant "decceleration" of the same magnitude from the midpoint to
the destination. The "acceleration" varies from wormhole to wormhole,
but has never been found to cause a greater than 10% variation in travel
time.

(Note: Quotes are used because acelleration is only an analogous term.
In a strict sense, the ship isn\'t acted upon by any force. As an
analogy, imagine a trip through a frictionless tunnel connecting two
points on earth. A trip of any distance would take the same amount of
time)

A side-effect of this property of wormholes is that a fleet using
tight-beam communications to synchronize calculations can use the same
wormhole for travel, by ensuring that their jumpspace fields resonate at
the same frequency. This means that the fleet arrives at its destination
at the same time, whatever the uncertainty in the 10% happens to be.
Each ship must generate its own "portal" to the wormhole, however. 

"Jumpgates", or the external drilling of wormholes, has been found to be
impractical with current Imperial technology because it is imperative
that the drilling process originate from *within the jumpspacee field*.
In other words, once the source generates the wormhole, it *must* enter
the wormhole.

MISJUMPS
- - ----

In general, misjumps occur due to two reasons:

1) Disruption in wormhole stability

Generally caused by gravitational disturbances. The creation of a
wormhole entry point too close to a local planet, for example.

In this case, either the course of the wormhole is altered, and the ship
ends up in a completely undesired location, or, if gravity is strong
enough, the gravitational tidal forces act as a lens, constricting the
wormhole and forcing it to be smaller than intended. In this case, the
ship ends up at its destination in slightly smaller pieces... a
meatgrinder works in a similar fashion.

2) Disruption in jumpspace field intergrity

Generally caused by poor jumpdrive maintenance, using impure fuel, or
damage to the Lanthanum Grid.

If the disruption is relatively uniform, what can happen is the
frequency of the field can shift in mid-course. The ship in jumpspace
"skips" from its intended wormhole to another wormhole matching its new
field frequency. Since millions of these "virtual wormholes" are created
every second, the ships new destination is impossible to predict.

I leave the effects of a partial field-frequency "shift" as an exercise
to the reader...

By the way, Grandfather, at TL-21+, was noted for his "trans-jump
drive", which allowed him to adjust his field frequency while in
jumpspace. Legends state that he had the technology to predict wormhole
destinations and by choosing when and at what point to "skip wormholes",
he could not only break the current jump-6 limit, he also wasn\'t limited
by the 1-week travel time.

Most of the campaigns I saw when I started playing Traveller were heavily
influenced by Star Wars, so I hardly think portraying the Imperium as the
"Evil Empire" is going to come as much of a surprise to many players.

On the contrary, in fact. The "Evil Galactic Empire" is such a staple in SF
that I find few players are able to accept the notion of a hereditary
ruling class as fair and benevolent. Look at the published adventures: most
time the players are portrayed as ethically-challenged merchants,
mercenaries, or outright criminals. I\'m not saying that\'s bad, but people
like this tend to rationalize their anti-social actions as "resistance to a
corrupt state" whether they\'re machine-gunning imperial stormtroopers or
selling heroin cut with rat poison to children.

I don\'t think it\'s accurate to generalize the whole of imperial society
based on the published adventures; they are heavily slanted toward
providing exciting conflicts for social misfits. Again, not that there\'s
anything wrong with that.

However, I feel a setting with clearly-defined "good guys" and "bad guys"
is less interesting dramatically. This was one of my complaints with the
Star Wars RPG; the Empire was just so ludicrously evil that every single
adventure I saw for the game (not many, I admit) boiled down to "the only
way to save the helpless victims is to exterminate every Imperial on
sight". The books include the phrase "sneering officer" so often that I
began to think it must be some kind of command position akin to
"communications officer".

IMHO the Third Imperium is plenty large enough for brutal Imperial
overlords, benevolent and incorruptable nobles, and everything in between.
Claiming that the entire Imperium is a single monolithic entity is not
realistic or a good setting for adventure.

still most cost-effective to fuel up at the starport (time is money), but

Just a thought, but aren\'t colonial fleets like the reserve fleets of the
3I?

So if they are the reserve fleets of the 3I, maybe they are made up of
revervists who serve one weekend a month & 2 weeks a year, but by this time
it may be 1 week a month & 1 month a year...  I.e. all those characters who
are not in the military might be members of the colonial fleets, thats how
they got their military skills...

Also, many of the sector, sub-sector, & planetary fleets might also come
into this...  I.e. a colonial fleet might be made up of this sub-sector
fleet providing the CrusRon, this planet providing the DestRon, & the
reservists providing the TankRon...

Also another thought (I know this is kinda jumbled, but I am typing this as
I think of it), is that maybe the Navy starts off the characters in their
first active term in a colonial fleet to gain some safe experience, then
moves him over to a active fleet, then as he or she gets older, they are
transfered back to the colonial fleet to train new members of the fleet...

I agree. If you want cat and mouse (or \'hide and seek with bazookas\' which
is how Frank Chadwick described it IIRC) you should play 2300\'s Starcruiser
(I wish they\'d published a bugfixed version of the Naval Architect\'s Manual
though).

Traveller has always been giant slugfests at capital ship level - like the
big fleet action descriptions in Lensman, or Azimov, or Banks. The nearest
literary thing to both I can think of is Hamilton\'s _Reality Dysfunction /
Neutronium Alchemist_ books where KKMs and det lasers are standard.

Cat and Mouse only applies for really small ships....

This will happen. I PDFed a bunch of assignments so kids could download
them from home, and file size went from 12k to 138k! I started using fewer
fonts after that.

Then the ISP deleted the web site by mistake, and hasn\'t resurrected it
yet, while the official web site is not available (even though we\'re
paying for it) because the central office managers are busy playing power
games instead of making learning happen. (I work for the school board.)

I did this when playing Dream Park with my kids. I made equipment cards
for every piece of equipment, with the name and  apicture on front and
name, description, and game stats on the back. Any equipment on hand (ie
ready for use) was set upright in front of the player (using little
stands). This meant I could easily see who had what ready, and the kids
could easily see what their gear could do.

I extended the idea to stuff from Space: 1889, but didn\'t actually make
the cards--lack of time and less need, that group being all adults with
better memories and longer attention spans.

Used equipment sheets with MegaTraveller. In fact, many of those published
by DGP were my designs: grashfalt, cargo container...

You\'d still need to lower the power plant output. Traveller power plants
are actually 100% efficient, in that we\'ve always assumed that they
produce exactly as much power as the ship consumes. This is _not_
accurate, and everyone knows it, but that\'s "canon". Thus, a ship with a
150MW power plant is actually a ship who\'s systems _consume_ 150MW. If you
add in the true inefficiencies of power plants then it would need a larger
power plant.

Take a look at the power requirements of various ship systems in MT, TNe,
or T4.

I suspect it is more that the mass of obviously different immigrants
(legal and not) comes from Latin America.

I\'ve noticed up here that, even though I\'m an immigrant, everyone assumes
I was born here, while many of my friends get asked when they arrived
(when they were born here). Sadly, the assumption seems to be that if you
aren\'t white, you immigrated.

This is why I\'d never vote Reform, BTW: they either want to kick me out
because I\'m really an immigrant, or most of my friends because they aren\'t
white.  I\'m offended either way.

ObTrav: There should definately be a characteristic for how offworlders
are regarded. This would range from "Kill on sight" through "Some of my
best friends but I wouldn\'t want my daughter to marry one" and "People
like us" to "Godlike beings with infinite knowledge and wisdom".

I get to read a restart in the fighter debate the two digests before my

About the TL16 RoM - I thought you offered to prove from existing published

Ouch! You mean that the discussion happened before last years one? Has
anyone ever plotted the postings on each of these touch topics on a time

It depends a bit.  At the least, is smells of trademark dilution via
sponsorship confusion.  I.E., it might appear to be sponsored
and the consumer might think its official or authorized by the
trademark owning party.  Thats called trading on the goodwill
of the mark holder, exactly what trademark is about preventing.

Having said that, very, very clear disclaimers might help.
As does the non-profit nature.  But in the end, its going to depend
on the exact nature of the fanzine.  If it was all Traveller stuff, its
probably going to violate trademark without a license.

IMO, better in this situation to get Mr. Miller\'s blessing than
to try to get forgiveness later.

This raises some interesting ideas. If you think about it for a
while, it makes the idea of popping in-system at only 100D from
Mainworld kind of unlikely (a good thing, IMHO).

I did a Q&D sketch at http://www.rt66.com/~merrick/jumpglop.html to
show what I mean (easier to draw than try to do it in ascii :-)

The bottom line is that there are many times when you might well
have to spend a few days in normal space to jump. Also, if pre-jump
velocity is conserved, then you\'d want to break at least a little be
fore jumping (instead of accelerating straight for 2 days, then
jumping).

Yes. I did a sector a while back for a game in which the players WERE

No, 50 MW of ENERGY must be radiated out. The canonical Cerenkof radiation
will account for some of the 50 MW, as will the magnetic fields, and other
EMS radiations carry energy out of the loop WITHOUT HEAT.  So that 50 MW
MDrive must radiate out 50 MW of Energy, of which we can assume at least 1
will be that blue glow of Cerenkof\'s. (I\'d assume more than that for MTU).
And then the losses to non-IR EMS from power running through circuts, as
well as the magnetic energy, should pull another 10% of that out, so the
Heat is 44 MW...

etcetera. Now, those radiations may generate some heat in the materials
around them, but again, not at 100% efficiency, so we bouce that up to 48MW
(assumes 50% conversion of non-heat losses into heat).

I\'m just pulling efficiencies out of my arse here, but the theory is
important, not the numbers.

Likewise, gravitics are going to leak some of the energy converted as
gravitic emmissions, rather than heat.

Just for reference, one of the neat bits about electronics is that a good
portion of electronics entropy losses are non-heat: waste EMS(Radio
subspectrum) is a major portion, which, BTW, induces both electric flow and
heat in other nearby metals... hence a phone line running next to home AC
picks up the 60 hz humm of induced signal. A radio tower can burn you by
heating up your keys in your pocket (especially if you have insulated
footware...) as most of the energy gets trapped as heat when the atempt to
induce current fails due to nowhere for the current to flow to. Magnetic
fields are another common waste effect fo electronics. Semi-conductors are
far less so than non-solid-state,IIRC, but still generate EMS and magnetc
energy as part of their entropic loss accounting.

Like the 3rd Imperium doesn\'t use part-time soldiers in the IN, IMC, or
Scouts.
Like every canon reference to "Reserves" WRT the IMPERIUM makes no
references to part-timers, but merely uses the term "Reserve Fleet" to mean
2nd line, and Colonial Fleet to mean 3rd Line.

The Solomani, now, they use part timers, according to the Solomani AM of
CT. And it is pointed out that this is different from the imperium in the
MT S&A (DGP).

IMTU, the are no RESERVISTS in the Imperium, only regular IN cremen in
assignments to Reserve Fleets. Usually because they didn\'t score as high on
the last sector-wide Gen&Spec SQT. The bottom of the scores get sent to the
Colonial Units... which often have a lot of system and subsector naval
transferees as well....

Local (system) navies might use part-timers... on a world by world basis.

You\'re placing meson-gun equipped starships into the planet\'s oceans for
the purpose of denying the enemy access to the planet\'s facilities, without
actually destroying them.

I thought everyone knew you had to use TL 0 weapons such as sticks &
stones against Imperial Stormtroopers.  I am sure machine guns would not
work, not even if they were crewed by small cute furry creatures....

Don\'t think of it as selling heroing cut with rat poison to children
think of it as ensuring that your product is specially designed for each
market niche.  I am pretty sure that this must be what Vilani & Vargr
meant when they said that Vilani MegaCorporations make sure to target
their products to each niche market.

After all by cutting it with rat poison you ensure that the little
brats, er customers, do not OD (thereby hurting your future market),
reduce your actual costs for real heroin(thereby raising profits), give
the users that nice special strychnine tingle which is especially suited
to marketing to children, as adult users may be able to tell the
difference & may be in position to do more dammage if they do.

Marketing is such a great field to work in.  :)

[Peter - who is picturing the company rep Burke, from Aliens, as a
shining example of what young Vilani corporate types can aspire to be.]

You made a bad assumption above. Since the 100 diameter rule has to be
a *useful* approximation of the mass-based rule for "rocky" planets
(planets with approximately the same density as Earth) then the mass
based rule has to be based on the *cube* root of the mass. The mass of
a sphere of a given density is directly proportional to the *cube* of
the radius (or diameter).

It goes like this:

size	dia	mass	100 dia	mass^(1/3)
- ----	----	----	----	----
1	1	   1	 100	 1
2	2	   8	 200	 2
3	3	  27	 300	 3
4	4	  64	 400	 4
5	5	 125	 500	 5
6	6	 216	 600	 6
7	7	 343	 700	 7
8	8	 512	 800	 8
9	9	 729	 900	 9
A	A	1000	1000	10

As you can see jump limit goes up in step with the cube root.

And by a strange coincidence, tidal forces (the rate at which the
strength of the gravity field changes) are *also* based on the cube
root. They fit quite nicely.

The tunnel bit has to do with the weird but true fact that *inside* a
spherical *solid* body, the gravity drops off linearly from the surface
to the center.

The effect of this is that an "orbit" inside the solid sphere takes the
same time regardless of its radius. The calcs are a bit weird, but I do
recall doing them back in high school. 

So a "ballistic shuttle" also takes the same time for any trip. These
are essentially a gravity powered "subway" that runs in tunnels that go
*straight* from point A to point B.

Back in the mid to late 80\'s I did the entire Spinward Marches.  What
struck me was how
sparcely the systems were populated for a steller culture.  I a
character had the resources
there were thousands of places to hide.  Using the 100 diam. jump limit
on stars ,there were many main worlds within that limit, causing
freighters using 1G to take from 1 day
to almost a week in real space for the planet - jump point trip.

So the Navy commissions the tankers from the TL12 world, and has them built there (leading to nice \'Imperium Signs Massive Defense Contract with

The Navy may be taking in all these TL10-TL14 MegaCredits that it

that system\'s TL15 shipyard may not have the capacity to build

m is mass of the spaceship in kg, rho is density of the gravity source

that of the Earth, and radius is the radius of the gravity source also

that of the Earth.
Tidal Strength is the rate of change of gravity force
along a radius vector from source

That is an hiperbolic sharp line. Now the problem is setting a jump
distance limit, and looking the shape of these functions (f(x)=-1/x^3)
there is something like a "plateau" (it approaches zero for x->infinity)
at some distance. So now, we just set an arbitrary restriction to set
jump distance based on tidal strength.

I\'ll make some more calculations, and then i\'ll post them, to reach a
workable restriction, but as a hint i\'ve calculated that at 100
diameters (distance=200r , radius in meters) the tidal strength is
1,5696e-9 times the gravity field at that point, calculated in Terra.

Tidal strength is K times the gravity force at a point, where 

K = 1/(100*r)   where radius is the radius of the gravity source in

The "whole shebang" at the time was Hood & Prince of Wales (one an old
ship, the other a brand new one), King George V and Repulse (one a
VERY brand new ship, the other an even older one) with the Home Fleet.


All the other battleships were off on other missions.

The Germans correctly figured that if they could sail through the
British picket line without being detected or shook the pickets off
later, they would disappear into the North Atlantic.

They never intended to get into gun battles with the Royal Navy unless
it was absolutely necessary.

The last row is the 100 diameters distance\' tidal strength of Earth, i
wonder how a medium sized (200 ton) ship could detect such a low gravity
force rate of change as 7,7e-8 Newtons/meter. A 200ton cylindrical ship is
about 34 meters long, so gravity change along the ship would be (again at
100 d distance of Earth)  2,62e-6 Newtons only !! A very sensitive device, i
think :)

Another question now is : which is the least tidal strength below that a
jump is safe?

I believe this effect (gravity wells blocking jump routes) is mentioned in
one or more canonical essays (though I can\'t recall right away just where),
the rules have always ignored this and assumed that ships jump straight
from planetary jump limit to planetary jump limit.

You can certainly justify such blockage and it would certainly be a big
help to pirates, but before you get too enthusiastic, you should consider
that it will complicate the hell out of the jump rules nad it will change
the economic realities of the TU drastically. I imagine that mostly you
could forget about getting 25 jumps per year out of a ship for starters.

That very question may be the reason pilots and astrogators use the \'100
diameters\' rule of thumb.  OTOH, in the 1100+ era Imperium, these values
have probably been measured and calculated for every significant body, and
they probably don\'t change much.

I\'m not sure what you are getting at. As far as I can see Ian is talking
about just that: the IN procuring less-than-TL 15 ships from less-than-TL 15
shipyards. To the original poster I\'d like to point out that I actually
assume that a lot of that goes on. It would reduce the Imperial fleet as
much as possible if one did assume that it only bought TL 15 ships (because
a lot of the tax base is less than TL 15 and will therefore be worth less
when buying TL 15 ships).

Almost right. "Reserve fleet" and "Colonial fleet" are synonymous.

While you are right about it limiting the number of jumps, it might
be useful to look at the main jump routes in a given sector--you
might well assume that the occasional backwater in the midst of a
good set of jump routes is a backwater for just that reason--it
exists in a system that makes it a bad stop for merchants.

As is typically the case with traveller, wierd inconsistancies
usually make for interesting stories. Why is doesn\'t anybody live on
this otherwise really nice world, and in the next system they
massively populate a world with a crappy atmosphere? Why is is world
so economically backwards while being in the midst of a buch of
other worlds? Sounds fun to me :-)

Strange, my copy of GT says "From the beginning, Traveller was a game of
secrets... We have another one building in GURPS Traveller, but you\'ll have
to wait to find out what it\'s going to be" on page 81. I must have a
different printing.

The continuing storyline in CT was one of my favorite things about the
published adventures, and I hope SJG continues in this tradition.

The danger with continuing storylines is the tendency later writers have of
trying to outdo everything that had been published before. IMHO this was a
big problem with TNE, and turned Thieves\' World into a joke. Let\'s hope
Loren et al are more interested in creating a dynamic and interesting story
background than playing \'king of the hill\' with Marc.

 So the Navy commissions the tankers from the TL12 world, and has them built

 headlines and lots of dinner invites for the Vice-Admiral in charge of

	I can see a case for this...but just how many high-tech shipyards do you
have??  This is an often-overlooked point:  you only have so many tons of yard
capacity at each TL to build new ships and maintain old ones.

I\'ve done that - works well, especially when you\'ve got a group of

Two ships - the Prinz Eugen was with her as well. They separated after the
Hood was sunk IIRC (I\'ll have to dig the naval history books I\'ve got out
if you want to know when). Not that it changes your point.

Perhaps the point is exactly that - if the whole RN (Atlantic fleet) was
tied up chasing the Bizmarck, the U-Boat actions would be less well
defended against. The Bizmarck was (arguably) more successful in its sorte
than the Graf Spee was.

Within Acrobat Exchange you can strip out the fonts you aren\'t using - it
depends on the machine what you can drop. However, you can assume that Macs
have Helevetica and Times, and PCs have Arial and Times New Roman. It just
means you end up tailoring the file to a specific audience.

I will need new artwork, as I was not an artist for DGP and thus don\'t own
the copyright to the art.  At the moment the sheets just have a blank for
the artwork.  I\'ll see what I can do tonight after finishing some tests.

Actually, I\'m working on an FFS application now. It will be for Mac _and_
PC. Infini-V was just a \'test run\' that kinda grew :-)

As soon as I get the time to finish off IGS and Metator (already paid for
by a couple of people, so I am honour bound to get them out the door
next), I will serious work on FFS3. (OK, I\'m also kinda waiting for Marc
to confirm whether FFS will be official for T5.)

In this case, highly-developed worlds might put way stations where
interstellar traders could deliver or sell their goods, in orbits that are
180 degrees (or 120 and 240 degrees) from the mainworld, so that they could
get in and out quickly.

IMC, however, the \'path\' needn\'t be straight, and it only hits another jump
limit if the astrogator fails a skill roll.

Well, to me, it seems like a waste of a major resource.  OTOH, I
guess they figured that it was better to "roll the dice" and risk it
than make it a "port queen."  

I\'m certain if they had been able to get Bismark out into the
shipping lanes it would have disrupted things much more than Graf
Spee had and would have tied up a big hunk of British naval assets
hunting it down.  It just looks like a bad bet it was a bad be, to
me.

Bear in mind that it is canon that the IN can procure TL14/15 ships at
lower tech worlds. The Kinuir was built at Regina. I suspect that the lower
tech shipyards act as assembly facilities (much like Aerospatiale(*) does
for the Airbus Consortium), and brings together higher tech components
procured off world.

The production facilities at Rhylanor (for example) concentrate on the
leading edge and bigger ships, and at the same time the factories ship out
components to other systems (eg Regina). This bypasses the production
bottleneck, and gives the Imperial own bulk transports something to move in
peace time.

Take a look at her sister ship the Tirpiz.  She was made a target and never
really got to sortie as I recall.  It makes a lot of sense to risk getting
your ship loose to be a commerce raider rather than let it sit and get
bombed.
If you get free, you will run amok and really screw up allied shipping.  At
the every least the RN will have to search the ENTIRE Atlantic for you and
hope they have the resources to get the job done.
Or you let your beautiful ship sit there and rust.

Forgive me if this is an answered question (just got back into the mailing
list today after being out for a year), but is there something similar to
the Extended World generation system for T4 yet?

BTW, was writing a program to do extended world generation on computer, and
ended up calculating that I\'d need about 40meg of space (uncompressed) for
all the data. Anyone come up with a similar figure?

I did a quick chart of travel times to Sol\'s 100d limit:

Time to Sol\'s 100d limit (running jump)						
G\'s		1	2	3	4	5	6
Time (s)	166853	117983	96333	83427	74619	68118
Days		1.93	1.37	1.11	0.97	0.86	0.79

Time to Sol\'s 100d limit (standing jump)						
G\'s		1	2	3	4	5	6
Time (s)	235966	166853	136235	117983	105527	96333
Days		2.73	1.93	1.58	1.37	1.22	1.11

For the purposes of this chart I assumed that on average a ship going from
a world inside the 100d limit would need to travel a distance equal to the
100d limit. However even if the average distance is twice that the time
needed will only go up to 1.41 times those listed.

Obviously the number of jumps will probably drop for Free Traders and
others who don\'t have agents on world who can start arranging sales as the
ship comes in, or warehouses where they can just dump the cargo. In fact
this could well result in a standard service at all C class or better (or
even D+) starports - you send your manifest ahead to a broker who starts
selling the goods as you come in. Of course then we have pirates again, as
they\'ll know which ships to hit and will have much more time to do it in.

Bear in mind that only the jump drives must be installed at a type "A"
starport (and in TNE they were installed at a "B" port by workers from an
"A", but the "B" port was being upgraded, so this doesn\'t count, IMO). The
rest of the ship can be built at a "B" port and shipped to an "A" port for
final drive installation (assuming the ship is smll enough).

If Bismarck could have snuck through the picket line and made it out into the
Atlantic, the combination of U-bouts for scouting and 15" guns would have
messed up your average convoy.

Or you might have found a justification for only 25 jumps per year, rather
than 35 or 40. If this is the reality, it places a premium on LASH and
jump-tender designs and pre-arranged deliveries for large commercial shippers.

That is, the jump geometry that would force an exit on the far side of the
stellar primary would be well known in advance. Using a pre-arranged
schedule, lighters or tugs would have to wait at a rendevous point at most
37 hours before meeting the freighter, swapping cargoes, and returning to
the main world. Of course (as you say), this is much more convenient for
pirates of several stripes, but only really applies on trade routes with
enough traffic to justify the overhead (and therefore the expense of
escorts, convoys, etc.).

Interesting.  Very interesting.

You can drop the mass off the ship from the equation. Tidal "forces" are
measured in units of acceleration, not of force. What you are looking
for is the rate at which the acceleration changes with distance from
the planet or star.

The equation for tidal accelerations is:

A = (G*M/R^3)*L

A = acceleration
G = gravitational constant
M = mass of planet
R = distance from planet
L = distance from center of mass of object experiencing tidal forces

That last item requires some explanation. If you are in orbit, then at
the center of mass of your ship, there *aren\'t* any tidal forces. As
you get farther away from the center of mass, the tidal forces
increase. 

At L from the center of mass (CoM) in a direction perpendicular to the
line joining the object and the planet, the acceleration is A *towards*
the CoM. 

At L from the CoM *along* the line joining the object and the planet,
the acceleration is 2A *away* from the CoM.

Thus, if you were at the CoM with your feet pointed towards the planet,
the forces would be squeezing inwards at your waist, at pulling
outwards at your head and feet.

I agree. Anything that increases the use of in-system spacecraft is
a good thing IMO. The variability it adds to any traveller universe
seems pretty cool. It also provides a whole class of in-system boat
pilots, tugs, etc. Neat.

As for warfare, it makes that more interesting, too. Resupply
becomes trickier--and actually gives SDBs something to do. Now we
just need to make fuel skimming worth the trouble :-)

I think somebody mentioned that military vessels can coordinate their jumps so
that they all come out within an hour rather than the two day variable normal
jumps have.  If you assume commercial liners use this same tactic, the prearranged
tugs don\'t need to wait long, and they can quickly report any delays.

  Supposedly they initially ignored the possibility of a sub having done

PMI, but why isn\'t fuel skimming worth the trouble?  Does it cost you more
in time than it gains you in fuel expenditures?

Isn\'t that within an hour OF EACH OTHER, not some preset time?

The coordination to which you refer applys to squadrons/fleets jumping
_together_.  They still have a variable time of exit, but the entire
fleet (at least, that portion of the fleet that jumped from a given spot
at the same time) exits jumpspace at the same time.  This doesn\'t do
anything to improve the predicatability of arrival time, it merely
ensures that a fleet that jumped together won\'t come straggling in over
several days.

I got to thinking about the comment below and it started running through my head
that there is probably a limit on how many ships can be built per year in the
Imperium./...   .../ Anybody out there got about two weeks and all the research
material to calculate this figure?  Good Luck, and I hope you have plenty of

Some Numbers About Piracy, Trade and Imperial Budgets

Summary: The Imperium is BIG, and it\'s WEALTHY. It\'s requently hard to grasp
just how big and how wealthy, because the numbers are usually astronomical
(and I hope you\'ll pardon the pun).

     To try and inject hard numbers into the current piracy debate, I went
into my
archives. The size of the Imperium and it\'s armed forces, the amount of
inter-
stellar trade, and the possibility (or not) of piracy has appeared the TML
before.
The whole time I\'ve been a member (and as a resident old-timer on the list,
that
means a long time), the thread keeps coming back.

      Also relevant to the piracy debate is the shipbuilding and maintenance
capacity
of the world\'s shipyards. The shipyards of the Imperium\'s Class A starports
have
an aggregate capacity (all tech levels) of 5,098,672,838 displacement tons
for
vessel construction. Its Class B ports have an additional capacity
4,367,049,593
displacement tons for the repair and annual maintainance of starships. The
table
below shows the tech level breakdown for the Imperium\'s Class A and B
starports.

My hat\'s off to Derek!!!!  I had started working on the numbers but quickly
became
saturated with data.  If I could beg a favor, I would dearly love to get my
hands on the
info/raw data and see what Derek used for his figures.  I didn\'t come up
with numbers
indicating the range to be in the billion\'s of tons.  I ASSUMED it was much
higher than
what I had, but I couldn\'t get enough hard data from the canon material that
I own.  In
other words, I petered out in my research after not being able to remember
where I had
read what. You can just send it as an attachment to a personal e-Mail to me
if you\'d like.
I put this on the TML in case someone else sees this msg and would like the
data too.
Thanks LOADS in advance, its really appreciated.

I\'ll give you two possibilities, neither of which everyone is going
to like.

1.  Do like I do and require that ships emerge from jump space near
a gas giant or larger mass.  If a ship is going to emerge outside
the star\'s jumplimit, it has to do so at the jumplimit for a gas
giant.  No, jumps to truly empty hexes, little ice balls in the
oort belt, or to within spitting distance of a planet.  Doing things
this way means that there will be some systems where the preferred
jump point is going to be around a gas giant, and that might be
where the system\'s "Up Port" is located, even if the main population
is several AU away.  If you often jump to gas giants then skimming
them for fuel will be worth the trouble for some people.

2.  Say that skimming a gas giant is something only done in special
cases.  In some systems, there will only be gas giants where you
*can* refuel.  On the frontier there won\'t always *be* a local
refueling facilities on an inner planet.  If you are passing through
several systems on the way to a destination, and you can jump
directly to a gas giant of a system along the way then you can
refuel by skimming there and immediately jump for the next system.

In a word, yes.  In several words, in most people\'s TU, yes.

If you can jump directly to the main world, and you don\'t refuel
there you\'ll have to travel to a gas giant to refuel.  Even for
MTU\'s fast stutterwarp ships, that\'s 3 or 4 days.  If you jump
directly to the gas giant then you have to travel in to the main
world from there.

Actually, it could very well be that the ship building yards on Regina are
at TL15 while the BULK of the planet\'s production is TL12.  This is only
slightly inconsistent with Traveller canon.  It is mentioned in several
texts that areas around a starport could easily be a higher tech level than
the rest of the planet. This COULD equate out that the starport ship
building facilities themselves fall in that catagory.  Just a thought, there
isn\'t any proof of this as far as I know.

It\'s frequently true of commercial jumps, but I was alluding to the
military aspects. Securing the gas giant tends to not be worth the
effort.

Interesting. Dunno if it changes much from the military side, though
(you may have to jump in at a GG, but why risk the fleet skimming
when you could just grab the main world?). It is neat though. You
could allow TL advances to get smaller ansd smaller mass limits as
well--actually, isn\'t that the jump cascade point idea from JTAS?

It was that you rate the system\'s masses in decending order, J1
would force jump exit at the largest mass limit, J2 at the second
largest, and so forth.

Another addition to a given universe might be the idea that
different _quality_ (not j-number) drives might exist. High
(military) quality drives would cost more, and could control exit
better. Lower quality drives might pop you out anyplace at the
precipitation mass limit. Merchants would be popping out all over
the place :-)

That\'s the wauy it is in traveller in general--a special case. I was
thinking more of the basic "high guard" notion (literally, not the
Book 5 rules :-) The implication that GGs are actually important in
a strategic sense.

LOL.  I don\'t think anything\'s set in stone.  That\'s just the "typical"
squadron/fleet sizes.  Your psi skills are faulty.     ; )  Far from it, I
hold to a deliberate undefining of specifics for both referee leeway and

Is there any evidence that it\'s canonical for the economics of any of the
polities of the OTU?  Nope.  On the contrary, in fact, by the basic storyline.

It is true that Striker was published before much of the background.  It only
shows the value the games designers have placed on it as a resource to do what
you have.  I maintain it was never the intention to make Striker (or any other
product) all-defining for the economics (and thus the militaries and defenses)
of the Third Imperium (or any other polity in the history of the OTU).  

Traveller\'s background has grown alot... from the handful of Kinunir
"battlecruisers" that could defend the Imperium from the "Barbarians" to
pretty definitive works by DGP and HIWG.  Especially considering the original
setting of Traveller (which is a far cry from the 3I of 1116 presented in
Megatraveller and TNE (and presumably of G:T)).  That growth stepped on alot
people supposedly...  I believe we can talk to the resident professional
Heretic about this one...   What you want to do is an order of magnitude worse
IMO.  It effectively invalidates over 10 years of Traveller support.

Nope.  I simply don\'t consider Striker (or anything else) as a valid resource
for dissecting the economics of the OTU.  IMO it\'s too overdefining, it
stifles too much Ref creativity and forces everyone into far too narrow
parameters (as well as invalidating the official storyline of "historical"
events, which I consider inviolable).  YMMV as may YTU.  It\'s just a happy
coincidence the OTU hasn\'t been dissected to the level you (amongst others)
would have it.

As far as sensible defense budgets...  Any subsector can draw on far greater
resources than *any* nation-state on balkanized Earth can in AD 1998.  Their
percentages simply don\'t need to be as large to maintain proportionally
respectable forces.

lol.  It probably would. ; )  "Our" future calculations?  I think you should
be a game designer when you grow up.  Then produce some "credible figures" and
"future calculations" along w/ a little bit of imagination and *validate* the
storyline of the Official Traveller Universe, instead of discarding the things
you don\'t like.

I think you\'ve got it.  I value the storyline of the OTU.  It\'s the only
reason I have any desire to hear a single word you say.  *Reconcile* the
"glitches," don\'t make the products and campaigns of 10 years of Traveller
support invalidated because of your dislike for the official background
(especially based on the figures in a minatures game which you hold sacred).

So you agree TCS and Striker don\'t have a foundation in the OTU.  What you do
in YTU is your business (as if I could do anything about it anyways).  I might
even enjoy hearing about it, but I value the storyline of the *OTU* above all
things, especially in this mixed rules-mechanics company that is the TML.

Well that is what each of the adventures was made for, silly goose, especially

This is a mixed mechanics company, Hans.  You may not like it, but original
Traveller rules are not the underlying assumption anymore.  TNE isn\'t either,
to my chagrin.  High Guard, Striker I, and TCS are as dead as Battle Rider,
Striker II and the World Tamers Handbook, as far as the underlying assumptions
of the OTU are concerned.  The assumptions for T5 may well be entirely
different.  Most likely they\'ll not be to the level of detail you\'d probably
like.  We\'ll see just how comprehensive and "ground-up" T5 is...  TNE was far
more so than original Traveller or MT.  Until I see something equally so, I
will continue to use TNE.  I have considered GURPS...

I don\'t think the puzzle should be pieced together to your level of
satisfaction, no.  It\'s a level of detail like that stifles flexibility,
creativity, and plain fun and will do nothing to gain new players to the game.
Canon is a liability rather than an asset.  TNE was attempting to amend
this... too bad GDW had to go the way of the dodo.

Don\'t be so sanctimonious.  They do fit, but the puzzle itself should always
retain quite a bit of "fuzziness," nor should the "pieces" be as rigidly
defined either.   In other words, you\'re putting light on things meant to stay
in shadow.

mmm...  it was second hand from someone who talked w/ you at DragonCon.
Basically saying you said the timeline wwould be set around 1120 (around
Strephon\'s Golden Jubilee) and that there would be *a* plot, developed through
TNS entries, etc, but there would be no "major plotline" as in TNE (which
expanded upon MT events/info).  It is possible you were misinterpreted.

Like I said, i\'d be happy to learn i\'m wrong (as well as eager to purchase
anything that might be convertable to TNE).

BTW, I was going to buy the G:T softback, but both copies at my FLGS had the
binding coming undone.  Is this common or did my FLGS somehow get mangled
copies? After the M:0 Campaign thing, I swore I was never going to buy another
rpg supplement like that w/o a discount.  I certainly haven\'t experienced
anything like this in my two other GURPS books...

Did you ever happen to catch Saturday Night Live when Paul Reiser was on a
little while ago? They had a skit called "Mad About You Aliens"...

They had the intro from the show (all the still pictures around NY), but
Helen Hunt was replaced with an alien. Words don\'t do the humor justice. The
"apple cart" picture had me rolling (Paul and Alien at apple cart, Paul
Smiling widely, alien "smiling" with sucker/tongue sticking out).

Why is it that the two funniest SNL skits ever had something to do with
Aliens? The skit with E.T. and the space marines was hysterical as well.

	In the interest of contributing facts, or fact-based speculation,
there\'s an article by Tom Ligon in the Dec 98 issue of _Analog_
titled "The World\'s Simplest Fusion Reaction ... and How To Make It
Work."  Kind of interesting reading, in that he goes away from either
magnetic confinement or inertial confinement. I\'ll admit I lack the
in-depth physics background to thoroughly vet it. He even gives
instructions for building your own ... literally, within the reach of
a (well-off) high-school science project.. Miles away from breakeven,
but according to the article you *can* detect fusion byproducts.

  So the idea is that by having a capital ship (or for that matter, a
warship of any capability) available to attack convoys, then all convoys
would need (potentially) to have an effective counter-measure available
able to deal with the highest class of warship that they might meet? And
that thus, the Bismarck had to be eliminated to prevent Allied heavy surface
combatants in the Atlantic from largely being tied up indefinitely to protect
convoys from sorties from the French coast?

I have the same problem with my copy of G:T and the similar discrepancy with
older GURPS products.  While G:T has only been in my possession for a couple
of weeks and delicately handled, pages are beginning to separate from the binding.

Slipshod "perfect binding".  I guess I\'ll have to get a harcover to archive and 3-hole
punch the soft one for putting in binders, once the pages finally give up the ghost
of the glue on the spine.  Yet, older GURPS books I have hold of very well to
prolonged usage.

Its just my instincts as a former bookseller, but I think the problem is actually
that G:T uses a higher quality and heavier weight paper.  Its beautiful stuff
and holds the artwork really well.  But since it is a little more rigid, I\'m guessing
it doesn\'t take as well to the glue used in the perfect binding process.
Although, it may be the glue and not the paper.

And looking at the spine right now, I can see that the entire spine is about to
split.  :-(  If I was still selling books, this would get a 10-15% markdown.
And I have paid extra care to keep the book in mint condition. (big fatalistic
bibliophilic sigh).

Anyone have the hardcover yet?  I want to be assured it has no binding
problems.

The fleet in being has a lot to recommend it, look at the efforts and resources 
the British had to expend because the Tirpitz was sitting in that Norwegian 
fiord. Look at the fate of convoy PQ 17, destroyed when it was ordered to 
scatter in response to an unfounded rumour that Tripitz had sortied.

This is interesting and IMHO very relevant to Traveller. The Bismark had (or was 
intened to have) all the features that would be required in a Traveller commerce 
raider (Scharnhorst and Gniesenu were better IMHO but thats neither here nor 
there). Firstly the commerce raider is only going to have a brief time to engage 
its target (just about how long it takes to the 100D limit), also even the 
slightlest damage to the commerce raider is going to be fatal or force it to 
abandon its mission. Therefore the commerce raider has to have the capacity 
to overwhelm (not just defeat, crush in short order) any escort. If you don\'t kill 
the escorts quickly you will likely take damage sufficent to force you to return 
to base (which is what happened to Bismark) or allow the mechants to scatter 
(jump out in Traveller). Killing escorts may look good, but its the merchants 
which are the war winner.

Not quiet, all the escorts need to do is slow down the raider long enough for
the convoy to scatter OR inflict sufficent damage to force the raider to break
off and run for home. Even slight damage to a raider will force her to return to 
base. Thus to combat a battleship you need a heavy cruiser and a few 
destoyers (enough that the battleship can\'t afford to ignore them).

Yes. The responsible party was setting up a MSExchange server utilizing a
POP3 converter, which, since he was on the redirect mode, rather than the
digest mode, header-stripped and resent all the messages back to the TML.
He asked me to apologize on his behalf, and has dropped the TML until he
gets a handle on that bug.

I discovered the problem two days ago, when I got a "Too many hops" alert
from his mailserve, e-mailed him, and he\'s trying to figure out
specifically what went wrong.

Not so.
Fusion plants consume 0.1 cubic metre LH2 per MW-year over these
TLs.
This is 0.1 X 0.07 tonnes, or 70kg.
Theoretical mass fraction converted to energy by
proton -> Be-6* -> He-4 chain is about 1X10e(-3).

energy = 1X10e(-3) X 70 X (3X10e8)^2, from Einstein
       = 6.3 X 10e15 J per year

one MW-year = 10e6 X seconds in one year
            = 3.16 X 10e13J, to 2 decimals

So roughly 200MW-years available from fuel mass, with perfect
efficiency.

The listed 0.5% efficiency is unlikely.

A more reasonable baseline value is 50% (fusion->electricity), assuming
synchotron radiation and X-rays are minimally recaptured. (implied
magnetic confinement and substantial shielding - plant
energy density MW/m3 OK as written to simulate this)

Then 100MWe-years are available from fuel mass assuming complete burnup
is possible. This is unlikely as the helium is \'ash\' which would inhibit
further fusions.

IMTU, the fuel figure is for a twenty year supply of power ;
a burnup rate of 1% fuel per year at TL 13. This endurance figure is an
arbitrary one ; higher TLs should permit higher burnup rates.
Helium obtained is either vented or condensed and collected.
The annual refuelling requirement is therefore quite small
(0.7kg/MWe-year generated).

It may be more effective to use the plasma to heat more LH2. Robert
Bussard wrote a paper on fusion rockets (presented in Progress in
Astronautics 1994?) which outlined systems with Isp\'s up to one million.
Is a diluted fusion product drive equivalent
(synonymous) with HePlaR??

I agree that Traveller spacecraft burn too much power.
i. Change power plant (fusion/fission) fuel consumptions,
ii. Cap reaction drives to Isp\'s of about one million (unless antimatter
is readily available in your TU),
iii. decrease life support and commo power requirements by ~100X (except
gravitics),
iv. encourage the use of batteries and accumulator banks, and
v. enable reactor \'idling\'.

The problem is one of simple harmonic motion.
The force between the centres of mass of the falling object and the
planet varies as the inverse square of the distance between them, i.e.

F=GmM/R^2, G the universal gravitational constant, m and M the object
masses, R the distance of separation.

We assume that \'falling\' implies movement along a chord or diameter
of the sphere.

The acceleration of the falling object is given by GM/R^2 (#1). (F=ma)
The effective mass of M varies as we approach the centre of the sphere.

We can model the sphere as a large number of concentric shells of
density p, thickness dr.
The value of M for a given distance x from the centre of the sphere
is equal to p X (4/3) X pi X (x^3).
(mass = volume X density ; volume of sphere = (4/3) X pi X r^3).

So the acceleration at any instant = (4/3)Gp X pi X x, substituting
into (#1, above).

Solving this differential equation with respect to time t yields a set
of trigonometric functions of general class :-

x = Asin(wt+h)
where A is amplitude (maximum displacement from point of zero
acceleration) and w and h are phase constants.

The time taken to travel between surface points is equal to the time
taken to travel a distance equal to 2A, which is a function of w.

Since all paths start and end on the surface of the sphere, the time
taken to fall *must* be the same for all paths of this type for a given
m, M and R.

I\'m sorry if I have mystified things.

I\'ve bought about thirty softcover GURPS books over the years, and about
twenty percent of them have come apart within six months.  The rest don\'t
start coming apart until five years or more.  I\'ve heard that things are

The gas giant is more difficult to secure than some other source of fuel,

What if Jump _really_is_ the process of falling through a tunnel between
two points on the surface of a sphere?

Picture it this way:  Jump Space is the dimension in which all the
places one might wish to go to are all on the outside of a really big
sphere.  When you enter jump space you fall through the tunnel at one
end and out at the other.

However the inside of the jump space sphere you are falling through is
not the same.  Like a planet, as you go deeper into it it changes. the 
A jump 1 goes only a very small way into the sphere, a jump 2 cuts a
slightly deeper chord into the sphere and so on up to jump 6.  When you
open up the tunnel (enter jump space) you tell the sphere where you want
to exit.  Jump 6 is the longest jump you can make without going deep
enough to encounter the next layer (To continue the planetary analogy
for our jump space sphere Jump 1 through Jump 6 take place in the
equivilant of the crust.) 

The inside of the sphere undergoes a phase transtion slighty deeper in
the sphere than you go in a jump 6, this phase transition does things to
your ship which cause it to no longer be able to control where it is
going.  Think of the jump field as having a field effect on jump space
(akin to magnetism or gravity).  When you get deep enough into the
sphere of jump space the charge on your ships hull is no longer strong
enough to guide you to your destination & you pop out in a random place
within 36 parsecs.

No jump can ever be more than 36 parsecs because a little deeper in the
jumpspace sphere (as deep as the chord of your jump would have to be if
you wanted to do a controlled jump 37) the nature of the inside of the
sphere changes again.  It becomes strong enough to destroy any jump
ships travelling through it.  This is why there can never be a jump 37
because to travel that far in jump space the chord of your route will
take you deep enough to destroy your ship.  This is what a "destroyed"
mishap in jump _is_ a jump that takes you deep enough to destroy your
ship.

So to simplify & restate this theory - Jump space is a giant sphere with
all normal space points on its putside.  When you enter jup space you
actually enter a sphere.  The farther you travel in jump space the
deeper into this space the chord of your jump takes you.  If you go
farther than 6 parsecs you enter an area where the charge inside the
sphere is stronger than the charge generateds by your ship which is
guiding it to its destination.  Without this charge your destination is
random and you misjump.  If your journey through jump space is a little
longer (over 36 parsecs) you go a little deeper into jump space and it
destroys your ship.

This theory explains why jump duration is relatively constant, why
controlled jump over jump 6 is impossible (except perhaps with Ancient
level technology), and why any jump over jump 36 is impossible.  This
feels right to me as it ties all 3 phenomenon together.

I disagree. Scharnhorst and Gniesenau were not heavily enough armed to
challenge old battleships escorting important convoys. They had to
turn away several times when they found old "R" class BB\'s with a
convoy. It was hoped that, if Bismarck found one of these convoys, she
could deal with the escort while Prinz Eugen attacked the merchant
ships.

Bismarck never found any convoy. She fought a naval group searching
for her (Hood and Prince of Wales), and later was sunk by yet another
naval group.

So maybe Burke from Aliens is descended from the baby on Mad About You. 
He went back in time to ensure that he would be born by becoming his own
ancestor.

Helen does indeed seem nice but it is called acting for a reason, while
I have never heard that she is not nice we probably should not assume
that she is nice.  That is not Burke that is Paul Reiser.  Paul Reiser &
Helen Hunt are only acting.  [Of course if you believe some of the
rumors going around Helen Hunt and Hank Azaria who "date" in real life
are also only acting but that is, shall we say, a Vargr of another
color.]

I disagree (:*>), Scharnhorst and Gniesenau broke off from the three convoys

Bismark and Prinz Eugen were forced to abandon their mission due to the 
damage inflicted in the engagement with Hood and PoW. After Hood had been 
sunk, PoW scored a below the waterline hit on Bismark and contaminated her 
fuel oil tanks. This reduced her range and made her incapable of effectively 
raiding (witness the extreme vulnerablity of a raider to a minor hit) in addition to 
providing the tell tale oil slick which enabled the RN to find her. Even an R 
class escorting a convoy could have easily inflicted sufficent damage to force 
Lutjens to abort the mission.

Even an old R class could have inflicted sufficent damage to Bismark to force 
her to break off, while the DD\'s could have threatened Prinz Eugen with 
sufficent damage (torpedo attacks) to allow the convoy time to scatter. 
Scharnhorst and Gneisenau both were more cost effective, better protected 
(they used an all or nothing scheme) and less prone to engaging targets which 
could have hurt them. The important thing to remember is any significant 
damage will be fatal to a raider (or at the very least force her to abandon her 
mission).

I was just about to start a analysis like this one as the first step in an
appraisal of the jump masking thread, when I thought, "I wonder if anyone
else has done this before?" Thanks to Harold Hale and the HIWG CD-ROM, I
just saved beaucoup hours of preliminary work.

Okay - Harold, did this list include information from Imperium, or was
there a good reason not to?  I found the following while comparing the map
from Imperium with the one from Supplement 10. I haven\'t done any further
analysis and therefore don\'t yet pretend that these comments make sense:

Imperium calls this one "Shulgiili" (M2), and gives the companion as
"Allamu" (M2).  Probably therefore Groombridge 34.

Imperium has Markhashi (M3) and Epsilon Eridani (K2) both on the map;
Supplement 10 (p. 28) says that Epsilon Eridani becomes Shulimik.

I\'m up to 1-2 megs now, with no compression and no maps. This is for an
extended Scouts-style system with WBH data and real-world stuff (like
pressure tables).

A slightly more intelligent system would really save me space, and might
not complicate coding that much.

My point was that it probably isn\'t a matter of choice for the IN whether

IIRC, it was based on the fact that in a gravity field of uniform
strength, a pendulum  has the same period, no matter the length of it\'s
path (The basis of Grandfather clocks...)

Ooooh a Gramps reference, I like it...

How about this...in a bizarre turn of cosmology, jump space can be
visualized in newtonian physics more than einsteinian. A ship travelling
through jump seems to be following a curved path through jump space.
While the path is shorter for jump 1 than jump 6, both curves have the
same radius, and like a pendulum, have the same period, no matter how
long their path. Jump 6 ships are traveling \'faster\' through jump space,
and need the extra energy and fuel to raise their potential, or kinetic
energy in jump space.

Their preciptation out of jump space is triggered by coming to rest in
jump space, and their _location_ in this universe is triggered by the
presence of a specific gravity potential. This is where astrogation
comes in, a major part of determining the path and vector and setting
the handwavian dials on the jump drive is setting the path to intercept
that gravity potential in real space. This is why misjumps can take you
so far out of the way or destroy you...they can be visualized as lateral
perturbations in the \'jump pendulum\', the more violent the perturbation
the more extreme the result.

Of course, in the TU jump scientists haven\'t yet reached this
conclusion, and have all sorts of weird ideas, like wormholes, Ancient
telegraph devices, or Pre-Ancient bad guys from the core...

This does _not_ rule out jumping into \'empty\' hexes; this simply means
that there has to be something to generate a gravity field in that hex.

I don\'t know if we\'ve tried this one before, but it came to me this
morning on the ride into work.

Speaking of which...I\'d really better get to....

One way of compressing space is by storing the random number seed used to
generate the system. Since computerized random numbers have the same
patterns if generated from the same seed.

The problem with this is that if you insert a dice roll in the middle of a
series of rolls then the rest will come out differently. 

To make searching more efficent you can store the generated search data
(like upp and hex numbers) along with the seed. When the user clicks on
the world for more details then the seed is used to generate the complete
info.

Love that acc works out to max range.

Note that if you increase the number of lasers and missile proportionally
the lasers pull ahead (since each laser can engage each missile, albeit
at the increasing minuses...) If you manage the sequences right, X
laser turrets will pretty much always stop 2*X missiles...
*****************88
depends on the gunner skills, but I think 4*X is closer.  remember tho, a
missile turret has 3 missiles, and a bay has 50! working out to 3*X and 5*X
respectivly

Is this really the way triple turrets work? This needs to be clarified.
I assumed that if a single gunner fires all three lasers in a triple
turret he/she made a to-hit roll independently, with no modifiers, for
each. Otherwise (as you note) triple turrets are near-useless.

correct one roll for each.

If you fire against three different targets, yes. If you target one laser
against one target and two against the other, it would drop to -2, etc.
You could say this simulates running your Multi-Target program instead of
your Predict (CT computer rules reference).

can a naval vessel operate from a source of supply, and how far can
a naval vessel operate from a source of repair/refit/maintenance. 

Note that Supply and Refit/Repair resources will differ in peacetime and
wartime. In peacetime, force levels will be those supportable from active
Navy Bases. In war, forces will be those supportable from Navy Bases,
Scout Bases, requisitioned civilian facilities, and supply convoys - though
I\'m not sure I see effective resupply coming in from out of theater assets.

2> How many ships (or how much aggregate displacement) can
a support base effectively service? A Navy Base vs a Navy Depot?

The second question looks to me like the larger handwave source.
How many planets exist with a Navy Base, a Class A starport, and
a population of only a couple hundred? The usual explanation for such
planets is that the couple hundred are permanent residents, and that 
a transient Navy Base population in the thousands will exist. If that
is the case, then planet population codes are no help whatsoever
in determining how big a Navy Base is.

I\'m trying to imagine a situation where the population code is taken
as accurate - a class A starport with a population of forty, or four.
I can\'t imagine all the services of a Class-A starport being handled
by four people. 

"Yeah, we build starships here. Finished one last year, a replica
Suleiman-B, Faertho series. You know, the mail order kit? Took us
eighteen months to bolt all those pieces together. And the shipping!!"

Speaking of shipbuilding - does maintenance and refit compete with
shipbuilding for shipyard capacity? "We can\'t build you a new
_Tigress_ now, we\'re busy fixing a _Plankwell_." If you\'re using all of
and area\'s yard capacity for maintaining the fleet, you\'ll get no new
ships or replacement ships.

This is not to mention the civilian usage of shipyards - significant, as
it appears that most navy builds are performed at civilian yards under
contract. Does the Navy maintain Repair/Maintenance/Refit yards
at the Navy Bases (and thus not be dependent on civilian yard capacity
for these tasks), but only have shipbuilding capacity at the prototype
yards at the Depots? Does the Navy use up some of the civilian shipyard
capacity for repair/refit at smaller bases through civilian contractors?

How many tons of ships are moving in the Spinward Marches? Is this
more or less than the yard capacities can support?

Hmmmm...I wonder, how much civilian shipping can the civilian
infrastructure support?

Ach, too many questions. I need to go find/make up some numbers,
probably based on the stuff from TCS...

Is this really the way triple turrets work? This needs to be clarified.
I assumed that if a single gunner fires all three lasers in a triple
turret he/she made a to-hit roll independently, with no modifiers, for
each. Otherwise (as you note) triple turrets are near-useless.
*************
correct one roll for each.

If the laser fire rate is lower than the rate at which the fire control can
engage and the turret can slew, I can see a triple turret being useful
in a point-defense role - much like a multi-barrel autocannon\'s
increased effective fire rate.

An E cell is a 20 lb battery, holding 50 * (TL-6) KWH if unrechargeable, half
that if rechargeable.  It costs $2000; it should be mentioned in space and is
mentioned briefly in Vehicles -- it is simply a 20 lb energy bank by Vehicles
standards, and has identical stats.  Btw, a D cell is 5 lb and 1/10 the energy,
a C cell is .5 lb and 1/100 the energy, a B cell is .05 lb and 1/1000 the
energy; the weight gets inconsistent past there, but every reduction in type is
1/10 the energy.

The intent wasn\'t to fight stand-up battles, but to trash some convoys and then
head home (ideally to the French ports, where they could be more of a 
threat on sudden sorties, rather than the out-of-the-way Norwegian ports.)
It was also intended (if I recall correctly) that either the two fast 
battleships stuck in French ports (Schnar. and Gneis.) or the pocket battleship
Admiral Scheer (sp?) would sortie simultaneously. (I\'ve gamed the former 
situation in Avalon Hill\'s old Bismark game - it\'s unpleasant.) If the Bismark
had survived and made it back to a French portm the British would have had
to keep more of a fleet-in-being in British waters, keeping important
ships out of the Mediterranean...

The mere threat that the ship MIGHT sortie keeps at least three comparable
ships on-station at all times. They\'re effectively out of the war. If you
build a good set of flak defenses you can also cost the enemy a regular
dribble of aircraft and pilots. Meantime, you have the option of a sortie. 

It was the terror of Tirpitz that sank PQ 17. Tirpitz raises steam and
everyone panics... convoy scatters and gets nailed by minor forces. If
Tirpitz had come out she might have been damaged (HMS Glowworm vs the
Hipper?), whereas if she stays in harbour she has the option to sortie any
time. Once she\'s out and crippled that option is lost, and it is by being
\'in being\' that she causes the most damage. 

After all the enemy HAS to take the threat of sortie seriously. Any time he
does not then he suddenly has one of the world\'s finest battleships running
amok in the shipping lanes, and this is not fun.

Tirpitz did more damage to the allied cause without leaving port than she
would most likely have done before being caught and sunk if she\'d come out.
She WOULD have been caught and sunk eventually, and while she\'d do
considerable damage (maybe cripple or sink a couple of capital ships,
several other war  vessels and a truly scary amount of merchant shipping),
her loss would free elements of the Home Fleet for other tasks and remove
the Battleship Threat. She\'d benefit the allies more by making that heroic
sortie than by sitting in port.

Just ask any of the survivors of PQ17 how much damage the Tirpitz did.

Immense inanimate blobs of fusing hydrogen do predict the future. They

This, IMNSHO, is ridiculous.

So the fleet disposition of the Imperial Navy is a
"thing-man-was-not-to-know," eh?

To me, anyhow, it is far more valuable to have an "overdefined" setting
than one that is "fuzzy." When presented with an overdefined setting, I can
take it and change it to my tastes (if I want to do the work), or I can
play the setting as-is. When I am presented with a fuzzy setting, then I am
*forced* to do the work.

As to the question of who\'s canon is more canonical -- I suppose it\'s going
to require a prerequisite header on every post:

"Disclaimer: The comments made in this post assume that the following
resources (books, maps, etc.) are canonical: ... All other resources are
heretical and should be burned."

Bring on the Inquisitors! :-/

A lot of the discussion in this Fall \'98 issue of _Piracy FlameFest_ have
been disagreements based in different underlying assumptions of what
sources are valuable and what sources aren\'t. There\'s little point in
arguing if there is no common ground for debate.

ObTrav: And now for something completely different. Once again I was
hypothesizing about an a pacifist machine race contacting the 3I. When I
brought this up a week or two ago, several people brought up a planetbound
machine race that appeared in some "official" publication (the name of
which escapes me at the moment). Several other people postulated on the
possibility of using the machine race as warriors. From this, I draw the
conclusion that those responders believe the 3I would see the newly
contacted race as a threat, either to be defeated or to be targeted for
conquest/enslavement.

What, no peaceful coexistence? Have you guys been reading Greg Bear again?

Let\'s assume that this machine race (let\'s call them the Krraaang!) are
pacifists. Let\'s assume that the Krraaang! are aware of organic lifeforms,
and don\'t want to eradicate them, exterminate them, experiment on them, or
make war on them. They mainly interested in social contact -- exchanging
art, music, science, and other forms of knowledge. Let\'s pretend the
Krraaang! personality construct is such that they experience emotion, but
only "positive" emotion -- happiness, attachment, joy, etc. Things that
would bring about negative emotion in humans do not in the Krraaang!. Think
of them as AI buddhas, with Asimov\'s Three Laws (or some facsimile of them)
as deeply ingrained in them as the survival instinct is in humans.

Now, imagine that a Krraaang! scout misjumps (or intentionally jumps) into
Imperial space. Two questions:

1) Would this be possible? The Imperium seems buffered on pretty much all
sides by other interstellar political entities. If it is possible for the
Imperials to have first contact, where would it occur?

2) If it does occur, do you imagine that the reaction of the Imperium would
be hostile (as per the defeat/conquest/enslavement model above)? The 3I
seems pretty robophobic (is that a word?), and considers robots
non-sentients. Would this view be extended to an entire race that initiated
contact on its own?

Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. Comments from all flavors of the Imperium are welcome, although I see
mine as a mostly benevolent (if impersonal) government that rules it\'s sea
of stars.

It\'s curious, that the coyns supposedly portray races that discover it

What this implies to me is either Gramps is diddling with time to make

where he\'d expect these races to find them, which means that _nobody\'s_
truly \'discovered\' jump drive from first principles. This is good...it
explains why no one really knows why Jump works, why those six races are
portrayed on the coyns, even when we know they didn\'t all discover
it...NO race truly discovered it, they just found devices seeded around
their home systems by Gramps; the reason they\'ve all gotten away with
being called Major is no one caught them copying it.

One thing that\'s lead me to this conclusion is that they all seem to
\'discover\' the principles while prospecting/doing research in their
asteroid belts.

This implies that there\'s still a Grandfather-made prototype laying

True.  I work it out and it\'s not a likely senerio.  The window is very

  IIRC, the downside of scattering in WWII was the horrific losses that
unescorted freighters could take from U-boats; although this doesn\'t have
a direct parallel in OTU, there is the possibility that these ships would
then be subject to attrition (esp. if a hurried jump is less likely to
deliveer them accurately to a safe harbour) by lighter enemy units lurking
in the rear areas but unwilling to clash with other small warships.

  An example might be an AHL scattering a Zho convoy, and hoping that the
small auxiliary supply vessels therein would then suffer losses from eventual
encounters with SDB\'s, Gazelle types, etc.

  Still, even a few AHL\'s being operational could require a proper cruiser in
each important convoy across several sub-sectors - a non-trivial re-allocation
of vital resources.

The best answer to this in terms of canon is to talk to Trillion
Credit Squadron players. This is kind of a FAQ, but here is the
short answer:

Taking the GG could result in casualties.

Subsequent attacks on the main world are then at reduced strength.

It\'s better to just attack the mainworld at full strength--since if
you attack the GG, _then_ the main world all you\'ve done is expose
your forces to danger, and given the enemy knowledge of your
intention to attack.

You\'re correct, they would have to come through non-imperial space to
get to the 3I, so likely other races would have contacted them first.
The Hivers would probably welcome them with open tentacles, and have no
problems with Sentient computers. Whether the Hivers told us about them
or thewm about us, is another thing entirely...they  might just throw us
together to see what happens; if they can create a 3I more receptive to
AI\'s as sentient beings, they might be able to sell more software and
automated systems to us. And _that_ brings up all sorts of interesting
things, if I sell an AI program is that slavery? Or Indentured
servitude...two very different things; one\'s allowed and one\'s not.

Hmmm...you think the TML Great Piracy Flamewar is bad...imagine this on
a 3I scale. They\'d have to quadruple X-boat construction to carry all
the to-ing and fro-ing.

ObTML ;-) Wonder what would happen if some automated system barfed and
started reflecting X-boat traffic back out to the system...I would
_hope_ they\'ve moved beyond sendmail to keep the data flowing, but it
certainly makes for interesting fodder for thought...those reflected
messages would carry duplicates of signed, authenticated messages...

Sounds like a buch of servant/companion robots run amok. 

(Scary thought of encountering the ones running remnants of the
"entertain children on planet-wide television" personality programs.)

Can a race thrive enough to go interstellar if they have no negative
emotions? Will they even develop a survival instinct if they never get
wired (literally, in this case) for things like fear?

If they are a built race - say, a race of mechanical companions that
somehow outlived their high-tech creators - then the above questions
are less relevant. 

If the Kraang were encountered, IMO the Imperium would treat them
as a race of escaped robot servants (whether they were or not), keep
looking for the live aliens behind the curtain and never treat them
as sentients.

  This is awkward to quantify, not least because it\'s not clear just
what a Trav warship needs and in what quantities.

 1) Fuel - L-Hyd resupply is local; with more recent (& superior, IMHO)
interpretations of power generation requirements passive operations are
essentially indefinite.

 2) Crew & consumables - the crew should outlast the ship on a campaign,
with some replacements for heavy battle damage that fails to eliminate
the ship. Crew supplies (assuming recycling of water) of 2-5 kg man/day
should be negligible - an AHL could pack a years supplies for the full
complement at 5kg/day into ~80 Dt (14m^3 @ rd =1).

 3) Munitions - missiles, basically. Usage will depend on TU, but could
easily be quite high, requiring a fair chunk of tonnage for resupply. 
OTOH, it\'s hard to see why the associated wastage rate of fighting ships
wouldn\'t be of greater strategic importance.

 4) Maintenance - as straight "wear and tear" the application of supplies
by skilled personnel would likely require the stowage for parts around
0.05 to 1.0% of the value of the ship. Clearly this need not require a
full port except for small ships without the needed staff.

 5) Battle Damage - lacking FRD\'s (wrong universe!) warships appear to
need to go back to a port to repair damaged systems. Actulally, "tugs"
and FRD\'s are implied by the fact that ships with destroyed systems aren\'t
regularly abandoned. This is not a strict "endurance" issue, of course.

Some caveats, of course:

1: Seige. Some mainworlds aren\'t going down without taking half
your fleet with them, and won\'t go down at all without specialized
assault ships, troop landers, etc. You may need a fuel source
*now*, so your ships aren\'t blockading the main world with empty
tanks when the relief force shows up.

As TCS does nothing with planet-based defense systems, you won\'t
often see this in a TCS campaign.

2: Desert Worlds: Some mainworlds don\'t have any fuel supplies
on them, or only have what\'s in the starport reserve tanks. Unless
the mainworld has some strategic benefit - mineral resources,
heavy industry, etc - you can pretty much ignore it.

3: Raiders. If you don\'t secure the GG of your frontier worlds, an enemy
fleet of commerce raiders can bypass your frontier defenses easily.
The GG may not be worth taking, but it still must be defended.

Now THIS is genius! The "All Minor Races" theory is not new of course,
although it is by far the most plausible theory of how everyone managed 
to develop basically the same very complex method of interstellar 
travel, but this is a great twist. It would make for an awesome 
adventure if fully fleshed out too - a journey to the Aslan homeworld
and the discovery of an unknown ancient base. Cool.

But there\'s another possible twist... the Hivers had their "inferior" 
jump drive for quite a while before discovering the "real thing". I
wonder whose jump drive they stole or why their planted drive wasn\'t 
put into their home system... ?

A quick note. I was unclear in my meaning with "negative" emotions in this
case. By "negative emotions" I mean motivations that would cause one to
take actions that are against Asimov\'s Three Laws (or facsimile thereof) --
things like prejudice, hatred, etc. (I am not as strong a writer as I would
like, and I am having a hard time stating this clearly, I think).
Irrational fears would fall under this category, but rational fear (e.g.,
"that 200-ton free trader is heading at a near-c trajectory towards our
homeworld") would not.

I have in mind a high-tech race with something of a "do as little harm as
possible" attitude towards the universe (and organic life in particular).
Not really protocol droids run amok, but more like "Grandmother\'s"
children.

What, you didn\'t think that Grandfather was the *only* omnipotent being in
the Milky Way, did you? :-p

There is a short story that I hold in my hazy memory of the end of the
human race. According to that particular vision, humanity became well-nigh
gods, saw all that there was to see, and checked out of the universe,
leaving their robotic servants behind. ...

Ahem. What\'s an FRD? :-)

If it is a mobile shipyard (or dock), then they do seem to exist in the 3rd
Imperium setting -- I think. When I was reading through the _Rebellion
Sourcebook_ during the Fall \'98 Pirate FlameFest, I seem to remember
noticing a paragraph dealing with fleet auxiliaries which mentioned them.
I\'ll have to check and make sure when I get home, though.

BTW, since I don\'t have FFS2, what is the upper limit on ship sizes now? I
know that Death Star scale things are right out, but what about a
Jump-capable mobile repair facility, the equivalent of a jump-capable class
B or C highport, suitable for use as a force projection tool? Something
like a huge battle tender, capable of holding a couple of BBs or several
smaller ships for repair/reconstruction.

Hmm. I just (*finally*) got a copy of GT ...

Another issue is maintainability.  For instance, in the Spinward
Marches, maintaining TL15 ships is more difficult than in sectors closer
to Capital, since there are fewer TL15 planets.  Therefore, to ensure
the local availability of spare parts, some IN ships may well be built
to lower TLs.  IMTU, the TL standard for ships constructed in the
Spinward Marches (circa 1100) is TL12, with higher TL ships being built
when capabilities (such as jump capability higher than J-3) warrant. 
TL15 ships tend to be BBs, heavy cruisers, and other
capital/near-capital units.

actually, IIRC, there is no upper limit in FFS2 on ship sizes...

He was right, for once. The 11" guns on S&G could not have seriously
damaged the heavily armored "R" class BB\'s unless they closed to
seriously dangerous (for them) ranges. The 15" guns on the "R\'s" were
dangerous to S&G even at long ranges; look what happened when Renown
hit one of them during the Norway cruises.

Certainly, except that it was thought the risk to Bismarck was minimal
against one of the older BB\'s escorting convoys. Their rangefinding
and crew skills weren\'t up to the level of the first class ships in
the RN, after all.

Sure. And a torpedo could get a one in a million hit on Bismarck\'s
rudders, jamming them so the Home Fleet could catch up to her.

War is about risk. The Germans were willing to risk Bismarck convoy
raiding (what else were they going to do with her?).

I understand this. It\'s hardly cost effective to have to run away from
every escorted convoy, either. S&G could not have seriously hurt an R
battleship without getting heavily damaged in the process.

I agree. Real world examples see to bear this out (although not necessarily
in starship building ;-) ). I can\'t remember exactly what the fields were
but the WBH used to allow variable TL under a general TL. Personally, I am
assuming the the yards at Regina can handle TL15 assembly and repair, with
limited construction of components as the local infrastructure isn\'t at the
same level.

Of course, the other answer could be that the original stats for Regina
reflect the 2nd Survey in 420? and the later (TL12?) stats reflect the
changes in the ensuing period as surveyed in line with _The Imperial
Fringe_ in CT\'s Deluxe Box.

as a much larger ship and classified then as a Battlecruiser, and was
cut down under the Washington Treaty.  I can\'t remember the original
Battlecruiser names, but I think they were going to be "I\'s", eg
Inflexible - the C Turret was to be placed aft of the bridge rather than
before it.  The latter being a move to reduce the amount of area needing
the maximum thickness of armour.  There was also a Battleship version of
the Battlecruiser carrying 9x18" on 32 or 34 knots called the St Andrew
class, again this did not survive the Washington Treaty.

If my memory serves, the Bismarck was classified as a Schlats-schiffe
(apolgies to anyone who can speak German this is my guess at the
spelling), literal translation being "Butcher-Ship".

Note that this is more true for "shallow" or "small" wars - everyone within
a jump or two of each other - than deep ones; if you\'re trying to get a
Zho battle fleet to Rhylanor, you\'re going to need to skim a few gas giants

is a better place to refuel (skimming leaves you much less vulnerable than
floating in an ocean...)

This depends somewhat on viewpoint, of course - classical TCS campaigns
don\'t worry a lot about long-term issues like retaining your fleet, 
retaining trained crews, risks of overwhelming enemy forces suddenly 
showing up, etc., and hence under-rate the value of (essentially) securing
your lines of retreat...

****************************************************************************

I think we have the framework of a deal on the Great TML Piracy debate of
1997-8.

#1 : Mainworlds with either signifigant trade or signifigant economies can
and will defend their space out to about their 100 diameter limits.

#2 : These defenses will make piracy in and around mainworlds unprofitable.

#3 : These defenses do not extend to the entire system.

#4 : Most career pirates concentrate on the unsafe outsystems.

#5 : Shippers apply risk premiums to trade with either unsafe systems or
outsystems.

#6 : Merchant ships specialising in trading in unsafe areas tend to be
heavily armed

#7 : Merchant ships specialising in trading in safe areas tend to be
lightly armed or unarmed

#8 : The best markets for stolen starships and cargos are in other states,
however unsafe areas will buy commodities they know to be stolen at heavily
discounted rates

#9 : Pirate ships will tend to be converted merchants, as unsafe areas tend
not to be profitable enough to justify custom-built warships. Safe areas
tend to be too dangerous for even custom built warships to operate in for
long enough to defray their build costs. Pirate warships may exist from
mutinous or rebel crews.

A corrollory of #4 and #5 is that Outsystems will tend to remain
underdeveloped, as they cannot develop until they are secure, and they are
not worth securing until they are developed.

Now, are all the principals of the GPD happy with this so we can put this
in the FAQ ?

Decreased radiator area with increasing tech level - more efficient

In a word, yes.  In several words, in most people\'s TU, yes.

If you can jump directly to the main world, and you don\'t refuel
there you\'ll have to travel to a gas giant to refuel.  Even for
MTU\'s fast stutterwarp ships, that\'s 3 or 4 days.  If you jump
directly to the gas giant then you have to travel in to the main
world from there.

Bear in mind that while Graf Spee was well over his official 10,000 ton
displacement (more like 15,000 tons, IIRC) there were three cruisers, two
6-inch gun and one 8-inch gun cruiser, HMS Exeter which was in the 10,000
ton range herself. Not only that, but these was an aircraft carrier rapidly
closing on the engagement.

What the action showed is that ships like Graf Spee that are optimised for
anti-convoy work don\'t do very well in an action against more formidible
foes, especially when outnumbered. Graf Spee\'s armament of two triple 11
inch gun turrets was excellent for safe anti-convoy work, as they outranged
eveything except a real BB or BC\'s guns, however against the RN cruisers
having only two turrets meant that Graf Spee couldn\'t effectively split his
fire and engage more than one of his opponents at a time.

Both these ships were to have given twin 15" turrets in place of their
triple 11", but the war intervened and the work was never done. If this had
happened it would\'ve been somewhat different.

  One advantage to riders (or any ship able to fill rider slots on a large
enough tender) is that they can be carried to their repair slots. Further,
not only should spare tenders occur in the normal course of events as riders
attrit, but trips to the rear to deliver neutralized units to ports could
also serve to bring forward _heavy_ SDB\'s (ideally designed to be nearly
identical with the line IN riders).

True enough.  I guess I should see if that ever comes up--I played
FFW a few times, and we always seemed to grab systems as we went.
That could be an artifact of our lack of skill though. Some were
bypassed, though.

The surprise aspect can still work in a way--jump in, fight a little
at the GG, then refuel. Now jump--but are you going to this system\'s
mainworld, or another one? Of course SOP would be to send a courier
out from any system that sees significant enemy forces at a GG to
any system within enemy jump range. If you\'re lucky, your courier
might get in system a few hours before the enemy :-)

This is a very good point. Of course *securing* your lines of
retreat means leaving fleet elements there. A reason why I\'d expect
some SDBs to be SDStarships. They would monitor enemy forces left
in-system and report to the nearest naval units. Hey, this is an
actual reason for SDBs to go off and hide! (assuming any are large
enough to even be a bother for fleet escorts)

IMHO:
I suspect that RPG\'s will still be around in some aspect, as they arre
extensions of the childhood LARPS like Cowboys and Indians, Cops and
Robbers, etc. However, my players seem to avoid having characters who would
play such games (I think this is because so many gamers are so insecure). I
also suspect that aslan are likely to enjoy RPG\'s, provided that it remains
clear the difference between character and player... something about aslan
honor!

Hivers are also likely to Role-play.

I\'m not sure a heavy cruiser could survive even a short exchange
with a battleship, but everything else you wrote I agree with.

Commerce raiders haven\'t been especially effective since the middle
of the 19th century.  The CSA\'s raiders (like the Alabama) weren\'t
all that effective and neither were the german raiders of either
war. At least, it doesn\'t seem that way to me.

I think that Humans would like it, the Vargr would love it, the Aslan would

As for the K\'Kree, I can see them playing a lot of LARPS...

To me, roleplaying is roleplaying whether done face to face or by

good as roleplaying with people, either on or off line.  ;->

>it\'s Collectable Card Games on the computer!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRGGG!!!

Hey, I\'ve just got to tell ya\'ll.  I was looking for something to
watch on TV this weekend and found that ESPN 2 was broadcasting the
"Magic:  The Gathering World Championship."  I\'m *serious* two guys
flipping cards complete with hushed play by play by an announcer and
a color commentator.  They even had an "up close and personal"
segment on one of the finalists.  And from what they said, this was
just the culmination of a World Tour of tournments...sheeze!  Then
there was the money, $40,000 to the winner with $16,000 to, like the
5th place guy...double sheeze!!!

Can you belive it!

to limit or even cure the various afflictions that fall upon them during
their lifetimes.

The ability to recognise injurious agents and prevent or treat their
ill-effects improves with increased technological capability.

Definitions :-
*Diagnostics :- the art or science of determining which disease
processes are taking place in a patient.
*Investigations :- laboratory, imaging or surgical tests used to
confirm or challenge the provisional diagnosis.
*Therapeutics :- the art or science of treating disease. This is
arbitrarily divided into \'medical\' (use of pharmaceuticals) and
\'surgical\' (use of instruments).

Developments by Tech Level :-

TL 0. Knowledge is accumulated by trial and error and transmitted
from family member to family member. Mysticism is inevitable.
Apart from a few plant and animal-based remedies, there are no effective
medical treatments. Surgery is restricted to splinting and bandaging.

TL 1. The development of agriculture permits towns and cities to arise,
and further division of labour.
* The training and conduct of medical practitioners are regulated by
authorities, either within the group (college/clerical hierarchy)
or by the prevailing ruling structures.
* Theories of disease arise. Potential for competing schools of thought
exists.
* Clinical diagnosis is quite sophisticated.
* Anatomical dissection begins.
* A large pharmacopoeia arises, but the utility of most agents is
doubtful at best.
* Limited surgery develops : removing bladder stones or squares of skull
to relieve raised intracranial pressure (trephining) are the
pinnacle of technique at this stage. Setting of simple fractures,
removal of superficial foreign bodies, draining boils and abscesses and
suturing are commonplace.

TL 2. Key physiological concepts, such as the circulation of blood,
are discovered.
* Anatomical knowledge improves, as does clinical diagnostic skills.
* The first tentative attempts are made at amputating limbs and
transfusing blood. Survival rates are predictably low.
* Prosthetics are crude (eg. Tycho Brahe\'s nose or a wooden pegleg), but
plastic surgery (skin flaps only) is possible.

TL 3. The discovery of the microscope reveals ubiquitous bacteria.
Microscopic anatomy - histology and embryology - begin as sciences.
* Sanitation (sewers, drains and clean water) is recognised as a vital
health promoting device.
* Vaccination against certain diseases is experimented with. Success
rates are highly variable.
* Surgical technique is hindered by inadequate pain relief, blood loss
and post-operative infection. Abdominal surgery is possible, but rarely
attempted because of these factors.

TL 4. Industrialisation accelerates rapidly, as does the development of
chemistry and physics.
* Germ theories of disease are proposed. Physiology and pathology
become important clinical sciences. Endocrinology develops. Thyroid
extracts and insulin are used clinically, for example.
* Psychology and psychiatry arise.
* Certain volatile liquids are demonstrated to have anaesthetic effects
eg ether, chloroform.
* Antisepsis is employed in surgery, dramatically decreasing the
incidence of post-op infection.
* Hypodermic needles are developed.
* Surgery\'s scope extends to abdominal and neurosurgical procedures.
* Laboratory investigations become well established (blood grouping,
microbiology).
* The discovery of X-rays revolutionises diagnosis.
Early radiotherapy is attempted.

TL 5. Attempts are made to treat the more disabling psychiatric
disorders eg. insulin coma, electroshock therapy, psychoanalysis.
* The pharmacopoeia is expanded with the development of antibiotics,
synthetic steroids and analgesics.
* The complexity of the immune system becomes apparent, as does the
structure of DNA.
* Intravenous anaesthetic agents are developed, as are muscle relaxants.
The \'anaesthetic triad\' of anaesthesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation
therefore becomes possible.
* Surgery on the heart is attempted, to correct congenital abnormalities
and valvular disease.
* Disposable intravenous cannulae and catheters are developed, as are
crude prosthetics (eg jointed plastic arms with hooks or claws).
* The damaging effects of radiation are recognised ; X-rays are used
less frequently and more carefully!
* Mass immunisation for certain diseases is commonplace.

TL 6. Ultrasonography is developed and used clinically.
* Effective psychoactive drugs (antipsychotics, antidepressants and
sedatives) are developed, but these are not without side-effects.
The pharmacopoeia continues to improve.
* Invasive monitoring and telemetry techniques are developed.
* Acute care (coronary care and intensive care) units are formed.

TL 7. Transplant surgery (heart, kidney, skin, cornea), cardio-pulmonary
bypass (heart-lung machines) and renal dialysis are developed.
* Reconstructive surgery is well-developed.
* The merging of the computer and X-ray machine yields the CT (computed
tomography) scanner.
* Methods for manipulating the DNA of bacteria emerge ; biotechnology
becomes a booming field.

TL 8. The scope of transplantation expands to include lung, liver,
pancreas, bone marrow and segments of intestine.
* Laser and endoscopic surgery become commonplace.
* The first automated surgical assistants are developed towards the end
of the period.
* Early anti-viral drugs are introduced, as is gene therapy for a few
conditions.
* Nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scanners are developed.
* \'Nuclear medicine\' arises as a speciality with refinement in gamma
cameras and radiopharmaceuticals.
* Improved computer processing power permits 3D reconstruction of X-ray,
MR or ultrasound images.
* A spinoff from silicon chip technology enables blood analysers
(haematology, biochemistry) to become hand sized.
* Recominant viral vaccines (eg. against hepatitis A and B) are
developed.
* Cloning via nuclear transfer techniques is successfully demonstrated.
* Polymerase chain reaction or PCR techniques offer a way of detecting
very small amounts of (biological) material.

TL 9. Portable bacterial and viral analysers developed.
* Nerve refusion uses matrices of an inert substrate impregnated with
cell signalling factors.
* Tissue culture technology allows organs to be regrown, facilitating
transplant and reconstructive surgery.
In vivo regrowth (eg. regenerating digits) becomes possible, but is
expensive and prolonged (requires hospital inpatient care).
The artificial womb is a variant of these technologies.
* The first protein micromachines are developed as a result of advances
in biotechnology and molecular computing.
Stability and longevity problems restrict their use to the lab.
However, rapid protein and DNA sequencing techniques become available.
* Homologous recombination - directed gene insertion - becomes possible
with humans and other multicellular organisms. Prior to this, genes were
inserted at random by the viral vector.
* The serendipitous development of slow drug spawns a new medical
speciality : that of low metabolism and its disorders.
* Hibernation medicine\'s domain includes that of the newly discovered
low berth (low-temperature vitrification and reanimation are
demonstrated for the first time at this TL).
* Medical expert systems are incorporated in portable ICU level
stretcher capsules built for retrieval/battlefield situations ; the
first \'automeds\'.
* Modern prosthetics and bionics become possible due to advancements in
materials science, electrical and computer engineering.

TL 10. Growth quickening of tissue becomes possible. Malignant cells are
destroyed by surveillance protein machines.
These are also used in medical oncology.
* Broad spectrum vaccines become possible with nanotechnology. However,
protection is conferred only for about a standard year, as the machines
aren\'t stable and can\'t reproduce.
* The development of relatively efficient antiproton traps leads to the
clinical use of antimatter for diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy.
Antiproton CT requires much less radiation to get a better picture than
X-ray based CT.

TL 11. The pocket medical scanner is developed. Utilising advanced
ultrasound and superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID)
technology, it can :-
   determine heart rate from ECG ;
   measure cardiac output (volume of blood pumped per unit time) via
Doppler ultrasound of the aortic root (probe must be placed on chest) ;
   and monitor other vital signs (blood pressure, blood oxygen
saturation) and measure appropriate biochemical and haematological
parameters with appropriate peripherals (a multichannel arterial cannula
would suffice).
* The medical computer is a medical scanner connected to an expert
system - effectively a diagnostician in a box. A microbiology lab
module is included with the computer but not the scanner.
* Improved understanding of the neurophysiology of vision leads to
the development of artificial eyes.
* Low berth medicine is made much safer with the development of
gravisonic refrigeration techniques.

TL 12. Synthetic vision, and advances in robotics lead to the
development of modern automeds. Depending on legislation, automeds can
perform functions from bandaging to resuscitation. Regardless, they are
an invaluable tool for medical personnel.
* Psionic shields develop from an improved understanding of
neurophysiology.
* Improvements in nanotechnology enable broad-spectrum \'vaccines\' to be
developed which enable recognition and neutralisation by the host\'s
immune system of almost all infective agents, tumour cells and some
toxic substances (the latter in low blood and tissue concentrations).
Stability is still a problem : about five year\'s protection is
conferred.
* Advances in materials science lead to the development of
pseudo-biological prosthetics.

TL 13. Growth quickening technology peaks at a 100:1 quickening rate.
* Advanced regrowth techniques permit outpatient care. For limbs, limb
buds are covered with a template insert which is shed when regrowth is
complete.
Internal organs can only be regrown in this way if they are paired,
(i.e. a functional original present) unless a portable life support
system is used (heart/lung/liver/machine!), which are available, but
EXPENSIVE.
* Newly dead persons can be revived with a combination of nanomachine
based cell stabilisation and repair, agressive nutrition and growth
quickening.
The only requirement is an intact brain and brainstem.
* Radiation poisoning (not acute brain syndrome) is amenable to
treatment with repair machines, stem cell acceleration (in particular
blood and gut lining) and surveillance nanites to eliminate malignant
cells.
* Neural activity sensors are a refinement of psionic shield technology.
They are large and very short ranged.

TL 14. Computer-brain interfaces are possible. At lower TLs, switches
and other electrical devices are implantable, but nothing as complex as
a computer.
Implantable computers to exploit this breakthrough become available.
It becomes possible to read memories and alter them as a result.
However at this TL reading is non-selective and destructive, writing
proves near-impossible.
* Genetic engineering (uplift of embryo, germ cell transmission of new
characteristics).

TL 15. Brain transplants become possible, as does treatment of
radiation-induced acute brain syndrome.
* Anagathics are developed. These are a combination of repair and
surveillance nanites. Stability problems necessitate a course of
tablets, injections, etc. (choose delivery system).

Beyond the common TLs....
TL 16. Crude memory transfer (non-destructive read)

TL 17. Immune system augmentation with \'active screen\' nanomachines.
Stability problem solved.
Infection, poisoning, aging and malignancy are not possible.
* Selective memory erasure or alteration.

TL 18. Partial memory transfer (non-destructive)

TL 19. Biostasis :- no freezing or drugs : nanomachine induced metabolic
arrest. Preservation time is a function of nanomachine failure or
mutation rate.
* Advanced bioengineering :- living organisms can be directly reshaped
with nano editing of their genome and growth acceleration.

TL 20. Minds can be transferred to computers or other sentients....

Comments and constructive criticism are always welcome.

No, but there is one called something like "Across the Bright Sea"
that I invented for the game I\'m running.

One of the characters in my PBEM, picked it up, accidentally,
thinking it was a entertainment disk at the local Data-Mart.  Once
she opens it and finds the little cubes with dots on them, and vids
the instructions, I wonder what she\'ll do.  Will she try to organize
a game to entertain the crew and passengers during one of the long
boring jumps.  ;->

Does the Major/Minor race thing *have to* apply to jump drive?  That\'s how the
Imperium defines it, but is that how Grandfather did?  Especially seeing how
the Ancients used stargates.  

Maybe there\'s something else particular to those Six Races?  Also note that
mention of the Six Races has appeared \'independently\' in Aslan, Vargr, and
K\'kree literature.  The hand of Yaskoydray?

W/o getting into the time travel thing, could it be these races have some...
drive... to dominate the stars where others lack it?  Maybe some sort of thing
vaguely comparable to Grandfather himself versus the rest of the Droyne... a
passive-aggressive sort of thing?

I was talking about the *economics* of the OTU.  The fleet dispositions of the
Imperial Navy are pretty well described in the Rebellion SB.

Or you can play it as is, simply inserting some assumptions on your part
(inserting some from Piper, Foundation, et al), leaving the subsector GDP and
the number of spacehands in the 112th fleet for grognards.  Your argument does
have some merit *if* it applies to overdefinition from the beginning.  In
Traveller\'s case, this overdefinition would hypothetically happen decades
after the fact and most likely invalidate at least some previously published
material.

Exactly!  : )  The underlying assumptions have always been vague and rather
undefined.  There are a few bits of definition, but not nearly enough for any
one side to be "right," as far as canon is concerned.  It basically comes down
to how pervasive the Imperium is in one\'s TU.  In the OTU, piracy happens...

I think coming from the Rim would be the best option... seeing how Charted
Space is the less detailed in that direction.  Maybe skirt the edges between
the Solomani Confederation and Hive Federation.  Being unnoticed the whole way
is probably unlikely as they\'re bound to run into *someone.*

Not necessarily.  The Imperium was always rather pragmatic IMO.  Of course, if

How bout the dead one?  ; )  There are no (major) polities to worry about in
the New Era...  Maybe the Hive Federation, but any others are Pocket Empires
at best...  How would these robots deal w/ Virus, seeing how TL16-17 is AI
anyway?  I should think they should have an electronic combat value of their
own...

  It\'s hard to say - both the CSA and Imperial German surface forces
were very weak compared to the forces they had to evade in executing
their missions. OTOH, commerce raiding by U-boats was at times very
effective because (even with their poor tactical capabilities) they
could operate with some freedom.

  Those German warships that did operate in distant waters early in 
WW I could have been quite significant if they had possessed safe
bases at which to resupply or wait out battle groups hunting them,
or if the need to concentrate in home waters had forced the British
to further strip their overseas posts. In the event British overall
naval superiority allowed them to handle all of these eventualities
at once, and the Germans lacked the needed bases. In WW II the UK was
again able to prevent sustained sortying.

  A better comparison might be to consider the potential outcome of a
British-French naval conflict, presumably prior to 1905.

Yep.  I\'d agree with that.  If the pirates are smart.  Stupid pirates,

How does this affect the little guy, the free trader who goes from port
to port in the backwater systems?  Away from the main shipping routes I

If they can afford it, sure.  Those free traders just starting out take
their chances and hope for the best.  The unarmed will probably pay more
attention to the anti-shipping activity reports broadcast by the IISS. 
Unless they have good reason, they\'ll probably steer clear of systems
with reports of piracy.  Good reason includes, but is not limited to,
speculative cargo that might bring a high price.

Yes.  Though there will be exceptions.  Cultures with a high regard for

True.  But IMTU the Imperial backwaters are potential pirate markets as
well.

IMO, most pirate ships are going to be the result of mutinous crews. 
Merchant ships are, IMTU, more often the subject of mutinies than naval
vessels (mostly due to the fact that the Navy has steady pay) and
therfore you\'ll find more merchant vessels going on the account.

I think it would vary from system to system and there are so many
systems in the 3I....  

One quick note before I go.  I base most of my notions on my
understanding of the piratical modus operandi from the late 17th and
early 18th century, since I am a student of that era.

The CSA raider that continued her attacks after the war ended
(Shenendoah?) was credited with virtually destroying the US Pacific
whaling fleet single handedly. CSA Alabama created havoc in New
England by driving the shipping insurance rates up to unbelievable
levels.

The German raiders were limited in effect individually, but
cumulatively they worked. While the larger ships were out at sea the
Royal Navy had to use resources well over the impact the raiders could
have created themselves. Convoys were stopped completely while
Bismarck was at sea, and while S&G were patrolling convoys only left
if they had heavy escorts.

IMTU, some cultures talk about the Ancients.  Others talk about \'The Enemy\'.  
A couple of the minor races talk about a big struggle between the \'Forerunners 
and The Enemy\', but a lot of them have been shown to be the Vilani and the 
Saie or other minor race the Vilani went up against during the First Imperium 
period.  Nobody knows what happened to the Ancients IMTU, but there are 
archeological records of a few starfaring races dating back almost 15 million 
years.  The Ancients are considered the \'new kids on the block\' at a mere 
300,000 years ago.

Commerce raiders always are "effective" in that the cost (in resources, ships, 
time etc.) required to stop them is always far greater than their own cost. What 
distinguishes a truely effective raider is that it can survive and make another 
cruise. The German surface raiders (other than S&G) in both the world wars 
failed to be truely effective because even though it required a huge investment 
in naval power to stop them, they were stopped and thus those resources 
where available for other missions. The double bind of sea denial is that when 
you are able to deploy sufficent resources to conduct a potentially war winning 
anti-commerce campaign, you usually have also got sufficent resources to 
challange for sea control which is a far more valuable prize.

Guerre de course is always the resort of the weaker naval power. If one looks at 
what I think are the best commerce raiders ever built (The USN monster 
frigates of the 1812 war) and compares them with their opponents you can 
clearly see how it works. The RN had to go for sea contol and thus had to build 
large numbers of cost efficent warships for that role (the classic 32\'s and 36\'s). 
Where as the USN did not have to meet this requirement and had the luxury of 
building a small number of ships which were individually far superior to the RN\'s 
frigate force.

There is a much simpler explanation. _Secrets of the Ancients_ says that
Grandpop tours Charted Space every once in a while and that he has revised
the coyn set several times. The last time he visited our universe was
around -1000. That was after the Aslans made it into space. There\'s no
reason why Grandfather shouldn\'t have added a Aslan to the coyns at that
time (Hmmm... I wonder what he removed to make room...)

BTW. \'Around -1000\' could extend to -924, couldn\'t it? Personally I don\'t
like the \'Grand Conspiracy\' background for Traveller, but those of you that
do might speculate that The Big G had a hand in the _Maghiz_ because the
Darrians were getting too clever for his liking. You might further
speculate how long it will take before he notices those Imperial TL 16/17
planets and what will happen to them when he does...

_TCS_ claims that each world with a Class A or class B shipyard have shipyard
capacity equal to 1 T per 1000 inhabitants. This is modified by the government
modifier, which also modifies the amount of money spent on the navy.

This is the capacity available for new construction and repair and refitting.
What Derek didn\'t consider are the two very important activities that are not
included: Maintenance and construction of replacements. You can utilize your
full shipyard capacity for new construction and your ships will still be
maintained. This function is invisible to the TCS player. And replacements
for worn-out ships also happens without the TCS player noticing. (The last
isn\'t conclusive; it might be argued that in a normal TCS campaign, ships
don\'t have the time to wear out naturally before they are blown to bits ;-)
But that\'s the interpretation I prefer.

So the capacity is SPARE capacity, available for previously unplanned
activity: new construction, repairs and refits. I think that makes more
sense in view of the mechanics. Consider: You can have a shipyard with,
say, 100,000 T of unused capacity lying idle for months and years. Then
one day a shot-up squadron arrives and immidiately repairs begins. For a
few months the full capacity is utilized. Then the squadron is repaired
and immidiately the whole shipyard capacity lies idle again.

I think that the shipyard isn\'t idle at all. It is busy performing scheduled
maintenance and construction of replacement vessels. When an unexpected
repair job appears, the shipyard hires temporary extra workers and authorizes
some overtime. Once the repairs are done, the shipyard reverts to business as
usual.

This does mean that strictly speaking a new construction job should expand
spare capacity gradually as the new workers become more skilled. IMO this
is a complication that is real enough, but best ignored.

As for Imperial shipyard capacity, the 1 T per 1000 inhabitants is for a
naval budget of Cr500/citizen. Since the Imperium has a smaller naval
budget, their shipyards are presumably smaller too.

I\'ve also made starship tickets more expensive. I don\'t want that. I want
star travel to be as cheap as possible, in order to make it more plausible
that the patron is willing to pay starship fares for the PCs to go fetch his
runaway daughter. The 35 jumps per year was one way to do so.

I think that Live-Action Role-playing is going to be big. Can anyone here
think of how a live-action Traveller game would be run (Scenarios,etc).
Generally live-action have a lot of players (20+) so the scnarios need to

Perhaps these kind of RPGs can be mastered by a computer, programmed
correctly. Look at the \'holodeck adventures\' of Star Trek: What else are
they if not an ultra-tech advanced Roleplaying Game?

If we get this one down some tech levels, we could imagine a 3D-animated
holographic adventure for perhaps one to eight players.

Live-action games can be considered a more \'traditional\' way of this,
perhaps with only some of the fantasy requisites, the rest being
imagination.

It depends on what the players like most. the most conservative players
will even roll the dice instead of letting the hand computers roll ...

"Free" is the chance that any point on the mainworld 100D limit will be
free of the jump masking by the primary. The formula is:

Free = Sqrt(1 - (R - r)^2 / a^2), where R is the 100D radius of the
primary, r is the 100D radius of the planet, and a is the orbital radius
(semi-major axis) of the planet.

The last column is designed for GT.  Roll twice:  once for origin and once
for destination. [Optionally, add +1 to the target number for a mainworld

The basic problem seems to be that you don\'t have the imagination and
creative flexibility to work inside a logical framework. It only
invalidates a few scattered bits here and there. Most of the Traveller
canon can still be accomodated. And in exchange, future products will
be consistent from the start.

It dosen\'t interfere with the Referees at all. You\'re still free to play
in your fuzzy version of the TU. All it does is help those of us who likes
internal consistency in our game universes.

I don\'t see what your problem is. If the OTU becomes to overdefined for your
taste, you can just ignore it. But if the )TU remains fuzzy, those of us who
want it sharper has to do all the work ourselves.

Proportionate to what? I don\'t know if you are being deliberately obtuse or
just obtuse, but as I\'ve already tried to make you understand several times
before, a sensible defense budget depends on what your opponents are
spending. If you feel comfortable assuming that the Zhodani and the
Solomani spends far, far less than they can afford on their military, then
go ahead, but I don\'t think that is reasonable.

"That rather misses the point. The true value of the Traveller Universe to me
is that I can mine it for background material for my personal TU. As such the
historical background and adventures are important to me. And it is especially
important to me that they are mutually consistent."

I don\'t want to preserve any particular rules set. I just want future writers
to use one that ensures that new background material is self-consistent and,
as far as possible, backward compatible.

"And that is why, as important as the background is, the underlying rules and

It may stifle whatever flexibility and creativity you happpen to have, Gary,

[Theory snipped]

Another possiblity is thaat he is Precognative and knows ahead of time
that these races will discover jump drive so he puts them on the coyns.

Cannon states that Yaskodray is a strong Psionic [IIRC he is described
somewhere as Psi 15].  Canon indicates that Precognition is a possible
psionic power.  Canon indicates that psionic individuals can develop new
psionic powers in adulthood [AM 4 Zhodani].  Canon indicates that some
Ancient had sufficient understanding of Precognition to create an
artifact with this power (The one driving the Zhodani Core
expiditions).  Canon indicates that Yaskodray is over 300,00 years old. 
Canon indicates that Precognition may be one of the factors at work in
Droyne casting ceremonies.  Is the notion that Yaskodray was
Precognative such a difficult one?

I like the notion that Yaskodray developed Precognition as an adult and
started the Final War at least partially because he had Seen that he
would be fighting it.

IMTU, the Major/Minor distinction refers to power. (Think of the Great
POwers in 19th century politics.) The Jump Drive distinction is just
propaganda, rather like Christianity or race was during the 19th century.

And for what it\'s worth, I use the term "species" to refer to alien
species, reserving "race" to refer to different subgroups within a
species. Thus Solomani, Zhodani, and Vilani are all races of the species
Humaniti. Helps keep the biology straight, and also stops new players
wanting to play Aslan-Human hybrids. (Most players who want to do that
recoil at the idea of \'making it\' with a chipanzee - which is precisely
the point I\'m trying to make.)

Don\'t know about getting together to play, but my former scout,

Not strictly true - while HMS Renown had a `zone of immunity\' against
the ugly sisters, they *could* have split, and fought the same kind of
fight that the RN cruisers fought against _Graf Spee_. The original post
is most accurate - Hitler was not keen to lose capital ships, having
very few; and they were ordered to avoid contact with Allied heavy
units.

Battleships were rarely part of the close escort for a convoy. The
destroyers that were, however, posed a threat to Bismark - they could
torpedo her. A mass attack by a small group of destroyers could inflict
crippling damage on a BB.

Let\'s look how much damage two of the newest and best RN units did to
Bismark - The fast battleship HMS Hood and HMS Prince of Wales didn\'t do
a whole lot.

Fleet in being? Use her to threaten the Artic Convoys, along with
Tirpitz. indeed, the two of these together could probably overwhelm the
*distant* escort of an Artic Convoy, let along the close escort.

The WWII canonical example is Convoy PQ17, which scattered because of
the threat of an attack by a German capital ships (TIRPITZ). The convoy
was decimated by submarines, small craft and air attacks. Not a good
day.

Of course, Artic convoys usually had a distant covering force of heavy
ships - and it was this arrangement that eventually led to the demise of
the battlecruiser Scharnhorst - sunk by the covering force comprised of
the battleship HMS Duke of York; some light cruisers & some destroyers.

This would seem a good parallel for Traveller - a system probably
doesn\'t have enough heavy ships to provide escort for every group of
freighters that are in system - maybe it can spare a a handfull of
smaller craft to meet each group of ships, with the promise that the
heavies will come running.

Do you want to make sure we aren\'t missing anything by sending twice or is
it just a test to see if all our mailservers are up to the traffic burden?

Maybe you really are close to that old gaming farts home.

ObTrav : Xboat routes are a medium of multiple duplicate messages
travelling along different routes to reach their destination.  There must
be a complex routing system behind there to make sure the end-users do not
receive many duplicates of that data from Far Away, with "delete message"
flags chasing the message around well after the first copy has been
received.

I envision a huge, unique alphanumeric code (or set of identifying
elements) assigned to each message in the great sea of data known as the
"X-Net" with origin and destination info subsumed in it.  Once the message
has reached its destination a "receipt flag" is set at the destination\'s
routing handler which will eliminate any duplicates received by the same
station.

Of course, if you are worried, you can set the parameters of the message so
that the receipt flag is ignored, causing your recipient to receive from
two to two-thousand copies of the same message in their \'inbox\'.  You see,
the farther away the origin and destination are, the more possible routes
are available which *might* be faster, given the right combination of
arrival and departure times, and the more duplicates of the message are
sent along that different branch just in case the first copy is wiped or
redirected, or the xboat is late arriving.

Of course, if the \'ignore receipt flag\' is set *and* the message "bounces"
due to a wrong address or somesuch, imagine the amount of data space a
single transaction could take up with exponentially duplicated "Bad
Recipient" messages whose "ignore receipt flag" is also set.

No wonder those X-Boats have such big data storage computers.

SOme of both. (Note that more efficient conversion is what I meant by
efficiency, not the overall (terrible as we all know) conversion of fuel
into power.) The T^4 dependence for radiated power with temperature T means
that a moderate temperature increase can dump a lot more power per square
meter...presumably with improving materials tech at TL13-15 comes an improvement
in melting point of the radiators.

I think you need to look at the word \'significant\' and judge for yourself
what that means.  As a compromise document, Ian\'s proposal is subject to
individual interpretation.  When I see a word like "significant" without
any numbers I see the \'out\' for those who only agree somewhat.

Also, take the stated principles with the word "usually" inserted at
strategic intervals.  No statements apply to all of humaniti, never mind
other races, with perfect uniformity.

He said "the entire system" not "Gas Giants, Asteroid Belts and Comet belts".

That said, Supp. 7 does not mention how effective SDBs are in this role
against this opponent.  SDBs are primarily for system defense against alien
invaders.   Police patrol our highways, but I speed nonetheless and rarely
even encounter them.

As a generalization you can expect exceptions to the rule, but our own Oort
Cloud is dramatically immense on a traveller scale, as is the asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter (and any asteroid belt around the primary will be
similarly huge in terms of space occupied).  Gas Giants are more
debateable, but the point is that they *tend* to be lightly patrolled or
not at all.

Each transaction represents a marketing balance between fee and risk.  Each
trip may be to a point where the ship may be in danger, and if that were
the only factor affecting price, risk and price of transport would be
perfectly proportional.  As it is, as in Real Life(tm), there are many
other factors affecting price; Nature of the Cargo, assets of each party
involved, age or nature of the equipment of the vessel, etc. etc.  In
general, though, a ship hired to carry something will charge more to carry
it into an "unsafe" area than into a "safe" area.

I feel that way too, particularly because I see a high-tech Navy as being
much more professional than its 18th century counterpart, and the
likelyhood of a situation where mutiny is possible is much more remote.

The average sailor in the 18th-19th century could barely write his name.
The average Navy rating in the 1100s Imp could probably disassemble a
fusion reactor, and some could even put it back together safely.

Indeed, but as a trend or generalization, its valid most of the time.  It
also provides a little explanation for a few of the good worlds
(Mainworlds) on the canon lists that are not developed.

An excellent place to start, especially in view of the fact that many of us
have compared the RN of that period to the IN of the Third Imperium.

Weren\'t they sometimes referred to as the "Cherry Tree Class", as in "Cut
Down by Washington"?  Or was that the American class equivalent.

Incidentially, I think the Bismarck was also supposed to meet the
Washington limit of 35,000 tons, but the designers said they had committed
a transposition error as it came in at 53,000. (Again, I may be remembering
another vessel\'s story).

Like the Germans were going to make a math error (hmpf!).

I\'m not sure why this would be true (although if you\'ve read an article
suggesting that it is true, I\'d be interested to hear the underlying details.)

A couple of other advances in radiation therapy might include the use of 
damper fields to do precise radiation work (using a positive (=decay-accelerating)
damper node focused on a tumor, and a beam of fast neutrons, so that the 
neutrons only decay in the tumor...) Meson-gun type technology (which is much
more precise than modern meson treatments) might come into use at TL11-12.
Efficienct TL11 neutrino sensors, combined with dampers and meson microprobes
could also be used to map out bodies.

Thread over.  When both of you resort to insults, and are arguing from
entirely different world-views, it becomes obvious that there is no way
that this going to be settled.

Hans, Gary, you *both* have completely valid images of the Imperial Navy
FOR YOUR GAMES.  "Game" is the important word here.  The Third Imperium is
a fictional setting with incomplete and sometimes contradictory data.  If
you want the Imperial Navy to be a huge and powerful force, capable of
stationing entire fleets in every system, you can back it up with
references.  If, on the other hand, you prefer a smaller, overtaxed force,
you can also make it work.

Actually, I see it not so much as leaving prototypes around, but leaving
some sort of telepathic "trap."  Once the target race got close enough, it
detonated, sending the seed of the jump drive idea throughout the system.
Most people would simply have an odd dream, but to the correct scientists

*OR*...

The thought of jump drive could have been encoded into the species\' genetics and when the species gets to a certain phase of its developement, *bang* comes jump drive.  There\'s a *LOT* of unknown DNA strands all through the human genotype.  Who\'s to say?

Not to pick a nit, but according to _Secret_of_the_Ancients_, they used
transfer portals to teleport between locations on the ship and back and
forth to the pocket universes.  The ship still used jump drive and
performed no better at jumping than any other jump capable ship.

Stargates did not appear until FFS1.

Yeah, that could be interesting. While I\'m not a huge fan of TNE or Virus,
it would lead to some interesting interactions.

The Krraaang! would be in a bad way to contact a post-Virus Shattered
Imperium. I have a hard time imagining any of the known races accepting
them without conflict, considering what they had been through in the last
80 years. Like you mentioned, perhaps the Hive Federation ... but even that
would be iffy. Even more than than the 3rd Imperium of the past, humaniti
would be robophobic to a fault, with hostility the norm.

I\'m pretty sure Virus and the Krraaang! wouldn\'t play nice. On the
assumption that Virus is psionic (some weird form of computer
empathy/posession), it would likely be lethal to the Krraaang! If Virus
IYTU is simply a physical thing, then it probably couldn\'t infect Krraaang!
at all.

  The armour multipliers in High Guard mesh moderately well with Striker
(the same TL groupings are used as for Striker materials) although the 
fit below the TL 12-13 group isn\'t perfect. While HG doesn\'t differentiate
by _hull_ material type (a simplification, and probably a desirable one)
it clearly does do so by _amrour_ material type; it just doesn\'t tie cost
directly to material, and has the truly odd sky-rocketing marginal cost
per armour factor (at a given TL, with increasing mass for added armour,
why would it follow that Armour Factor "n+1" would be composed of a
different _material_ from Armour Factor "n"?).

I think I got hung up on the "can and will defend."  Some government

Roger that.  Explained in this way, I agree with #5.

Good point!  I think they would still happen onboard Navy vessels, but 
not as often, and then usually on smaller vessels that operate under 
harsh living conditions (CEs, SDBs).

For another contrast, the average sailor in the 18th century had to 
contend with the cat o\' nine tails.  I won\'t mention the barely edible 
food.  Even with its social stratification, I don\'t imagine life in the 
Imp Navy is particularly degrading or demoralizing.  As for the food, 
refrigerators really are an amazing invention as I\'m sure the crew of 
Dewey\'s flagship USS Olympia can attest (I seem to recall she was one of 
the first vessels thus equipped).

Regarding the corollary to 4 & 5.

It might exist as a trend, but I\'d be willing to bet there are many 
exceptions.  As an example the big belt strike comes to mind right away.

Thanks.  I got to wondering about the late Victorian era as I was

You would store any modified entries along with the seed. The logic would
go like this

Read in data (seed and mods) into Temp Data Structure
Make Data Structure
Generate the system according to the seed
put into Data Structure
Overwrite the data in the Data Structure with the modified entries.

The worst case scenarios is you modify every entry you can then you are
storing the whole thing. But on the average you don\'t modify everything.

To store the data you will need something like

Seed
NumberOfEntries
EntryTag (To identify the Entry)
Data

You may want to store some of the generated entries to quickly search and
index the data

I use this approach in a extended system generator I wrote using Visual
Basic 5/6. 

For Each World in Sector
Generate Seed
Make Temp System Object
Generate System with Temp System
Find MainWorld
Throw away Temp System Object
Store Seed
Store Mainworld
Next World

Then when I read in the data file I delay the cost of the extended system
until the user says he wants to view the extended system.

I am still working on the full blown editor that can store every edit and
I will be glad to share that with you when I am done. It looking that I
will store the seeds by world rather than by system.

BTW suppose you generate a system is there a algorithmic way of picking
where the mainworld goes? The way I do it now is 

Already generated mainworld

Generate system and all world and moons and their physical characterisics.
Generate the Tempature of each orbit (based on LBB 6 Scouts)
Compare size of mainworld with the planet already existing in orbit. If
mainworld is small enought to be it\'s moon then make it the moon of that
world otherwise replace that world with the mainworld.

Generate pop gov law TL for the rest of the system.

No generated mainworld
Generate system and all world and moons and their physical characteristics
Generate the Tempature of each world (based on LBB 6 Scouts)
The world or asteriod belt with the Tempature closest to 15C gets to be
the mainworld
Generate Mainworld Pop, etc
Generate System Worlds Pop, etc

The inspiration for deferring creation comes from the programming book
"Design Patterns Elements of Resuable Object-Oriented Software". In this
book they have a Proxy pattern which describes how to defer the creation
of objects so you can quickly load and unload massive objects. (In their
example it was a word processing document, I used to make a data file that
had all the imperial sectors stored in it.)

	This does not exactly do justice to the RN...Vice Adm. Holland on the Hood
was not the most competent line officer in the RN.  He initially engaged the
Prinz Eugen and ordered  Prince of Wales to do the same (Prince of Wales soon
realized he had misidentified the Prinz Eugen and shifted fire on his own).
Also, the RN ships were approaching the Germans bow-on in a effort to close
the range ASAP (this was most likely due to Hood\'s vulnerability to plunging
fire...which was dramatically demonstrated in short order); however, this
reduced thier effective firepower by 50% as well.  I believe that the
engagement was not well though out on the British side; but I think the Hood,
at least was a fair match for the Bismarck (Prince of Wales had just been
commisioned...they still had civilian contracters working on board during the
battle!!)

HG armour factor and Striker armour are *different*.  There\'s a conversion factor in one of the old JTAS\'s, but I don\'t remember offhand which one it is, & since I\'ve been up for about 44 hours now, I think I\'ll pass on looking for it today.  <grin>  And no, HG does *NOT* differentiate between armour *material* type in ship calculation, it merely makes you use up more space for armour at lower tech levels.  The material differences are *implied* not *stated*.  My take on it is the \'+1" would be the \'tabs\' and such needed to put the armour on the ship.  Mounting flanges & such.  Ask me when I\'m awake & I might have a better explanation...

IMTU, all outgoing X-mails have either a single destination, or are listed
in terms of "Saturation distance" from origin, either in jumps or in
parsecs. A 10kb data/text X-mail goes for Cr10 per jump. Broad saturation
stats at Cr100 per parsec. Jumps saturation has costs of Cr50 per jump from
source.

Targeting of mails is by eithername of ship, name of person, or local
address or comocode. So, forex, I\'d be
[aramis@gci.net]@terra/sol/solomaniRim, and upon arrival here, it would be
logged in, and my local -email address stripped out of the addres, and the
message forwarded to my local address. If a signature was required
(Electronic Funds Transfer, forex), they\'d e-mail me telling me where to
pick it up.

Multiple copies of a mail don\'t go out IMTU, save to multiple destinations.
In those cases, the routine verification checksums arrive via the next
X-boat with a kill order.

All batches have a checksum file FOR EACH TARGET System. If the messages
don\'t match the checksums in the CS file, the next X-boat/TyS going back
carries back the resend message numbers ___.

Message numbers IMTU are generated as alphanums. ForEx: Hamford sends a
message from RegniDowns X-mail station (Stn #2, IMTU) to a friend on
Psaydi, on 123-1104. The messagenumber will be a local messagenumber for
that date, the date, the local station number, the system abbreviation, the
SS abbr, and the sector abbr, domain abbr. So the message header might be
something like:
   XMS-Origin=546.123.1104.2.Rg.Rg.sm.dd		Message Number
   XMS-DestStn=1.Ps.Ar.sm.dd			scout XMS dest. station
   XMS-DestLoc=[hold for Adm Mason Ferrarri]	local address
   XMS-Expires=001.1105				date that it gets erased
   XMS-ARecptNm=Mason Ferrarri			Auth Recipient Name
   XMS-Meth=POR					says to print on recovery

Having had players hack the XMS in all possible configurations, I figure
also that all stations use a twin-key encoding system, double encoding
(Encode with sender\'s private, then encode that with recipient\'s public).
major stations may have separate keypairs for all other stations within 2
hops. EFT\'s will be even more secure...

Also, a lot of X-mail goes by scout/courier to the worlds off the mains...

And, to prevent clutter, if a delivery notice is desired, it must be paid
for when the original is sent. X-Mail doesn\'t arrive "Postage Due". Also,
failed deliveries simply sit in the office til they expire, and are then
deleted.

IMO, a sudden motherlode - such as a big beltstrike - might be a
pirate\'s dream. Here you have a situation where trade and wealth are

can be bought, built and/or hired. Perfect for pirates: things worth

Capital ships as commerce raiders: probably not. But submarines -- consider
the U-boats in the Atlantic in either world war, or the American (mostly)
submarine war against the Japanese in WWII. These were tremendously
effective on a tactical level, and arguably came very close to achieving
their strategic objectives as well. On the balance, the Atlantic war was
extremely costly for the Germans after September 1943 (?), when the Allies
got their act together.

IMTU, there is a race that around the time of Virus had achieved AI, TL17
(and early 18) robotic brains. I had them be resistant to Virus. During the
time of RCES, this race (a human species, actually) is quite feared because
of its robotic servants, and the rampant robophobia that exists in the
remnants of the Imperium.

Much similar to the way the Kraaang! would be treated, I suppose.

Indeed.  After a fashion, it reminds me of one of the incidents Captain
Charles Johnson cites in "General History of the Pyrates."  In 1715, the
Spanish Plate Fleet was lost off the coast of Florida.  The Spaniards
located the wrecks and began recovering much of the lost treasure.  It
was being stored in a blockhouse on shore, guarded by 60 men.  A bold
group of "adventurers" decided to relieve the Spaniards of the booty. 
They swept in, the guards ran, and they made off with the goods.

True, but if you wanted a yardstick on how to build one or how they

The cost of a force needed to secure a system out to 100 planetary
diameters against 1000 tons of raiders is pretty damn low. 0.5% of GDP for
an Australia-size economy will do it, assuming military infrastructure
costs 10% of fleet build cost per year.

A planet that is grossly underdefended may actually get raided - why mess
around with free traders when you can land on the capital, loot the
Treasury and steal the paintings in the Planetary Museum ?

Yep. I\'ve crunched a lot of numbers - comet belts, around gas giants and
asteroid belts is a *lot* of volume. You need far too many SDBs to provide
control of the system outside 100 diameters. Denial of control (especially
if planetary defenses have been flattened by an invader) is easier.

If it\'s backwater systems, then by definition you will be charging what the

Remember, firepower can be rented. I strongly suspect that most starports
have a couple of third-line fighters for rent, designed to fit into a
standard shipboard launch\'s bay.

Signifigant firepower is fairly cheap as well.

Ditto. The big difference is shore guns in Traveller go out to 100 diameters.

absolutely :-| 3I maps have a very humanocentric view of \'empty\',
meaning \'nothing we can breathe, live on, eat, mine, drink or use for
fuel\'. Stellar roach motels: "They can jump in, but they can\'t jump
out!" (presuming you\'re coming in with empty tanks) I\'d suspect, even,
that many \'empty\' hexes may have stars, phaps even rockballs, but no GGs
or habitable planets.

Of course, now that you\'ve gotten your GM Mitts on the idea I can fully
expect it to come back on me in spades...;-)

Now come on, HMS Hood was hardly the newest or best (being a spritely 21

her 4x turret jamming? Admittedly, she was a lot newer...

I\'ve had both GT and the new WH40k for a while (3 weeks, 2 weeks) and been

Because he didn\'t want to lose them, because they were vulnerable to
15" shellfire. Renown, the lightest armored BC the RN had, still
inflicted significant damage on S&G and from some reports more damaged
by the storm than the shell hits she suffered.

For important ones they were. HMS Rodney had to divert from escorting
a convoy to chase down Bismarck. "R" class BB\'s kept S&G from
massacreing the merchant ships.

There were never a lot of fleet destroyers escorting convoys; the
escorts were made up of ships ranging from old US lend lease DD\'s to
smaller frigates, auxiliary rescue ships, and ancient worn out DD\'s. I
hardly think they practiced much with torpedo firing, much less mass
attacks against battleships.

This accomplishes nothing in knocking Britain out of the war, which in
1941 was the German Navy\'s prime objective. The Murmansk convoys
didn\'t start until 1942 anyway.

>Does the Major/Minor race thing *have to* apply to jump drive?

I am of the camp that it is more than a coincidence that the definition
of major races included everyone with a powerful state.

If the fact that the Aslan didn\'t "invent" jump drive becomes widely
established, I expect the definition of major race will evolve to include
them.  (Or be replaced by the a new term)  Otherwise, if the term is
only of accademic interest (is a race that has taken half your
territory and is the greatest military power a "minor" race, no matter
how they got jump drive?).  My guess is that it will be assumed that
"discovering" jump drive include reverse engineering it from a ancient
artifact (much as the Imperium "discovered" black globes).

A question, if I may.  IYTU, how do you handle the overall feel of the

My reason for asking, IMTU, TL 15 is uncommon, while TL 10-12 is more
common.  The way I handle TLs mirrors the spread in the Spinward Marches
circa 1104.  There are a few (4, I think) worlds at TL 15 or higher. 
Most are lower, some much lower.  The average for District 268 is 7;
Lanth and Aramis average 8.5.

Mostly, yes, but there are some exceptions!
I really liked the ultimas up to 6, i am playing exile 3 now, which i also

Fallout is a pretty good adaptation, too. Oh, yes, and Entomorph.

Its true that these games dont allow the same degree of interaction a

Hm...actually, that\'s incorrect.
The distance to a point not masked by the star can be determined from the angle
(relative to a line between the two stars) of offset for the mainworld, which
will be R - a*sin(angle) if on the far side of the star, and will be R-a if on
the near side.  If we assume that the destination star is on the ecliptic for
the planet, it will be masked for a portion of the year equal to asin(R/a)/pi
- -- so for the earth (with a jump limit of 0.93 AU) it will be 38% of the year. 
If the target star is off the ecliptic, the masking effect will be less -- at
an arc of 69 degrees off the ecliptic the sun will _never_ mask the jump. 
Resolving probabilities there is an exercise in spherical geometry which I\'m
not terribly interested in solving -- I suspect it works out to something like
(asin(R/a)/pi)^2 * 2, or about 28% for earth, but someone else is free to do it
correctly.

    'month' => '10',

    'body' => 'Definition :
Trauma is any injury arising from the application of
mechanical energy.
Other agents (heat, electricity, laser radiation, plasmas, etc.) have
additional effects, which I will discuss in a later post.

Pathophysiology
When objects collide with each other, their kinetic energy is dissipated
in several ways - sound waves, heat, and deformation
or disruption of the objects\' internal structure.
It is this deformation which leads to tissue damage.
The more dense the tissue, the greater resistance it offers and thus the
damaged sustained is worse.
Example tissue densities in humans :-
Tissue      Density (g/cc)
Lung        0.4
Fat         0.8
Muscle*     1.0
Skin        1.05
Bone        1.11 to 1.4
* and solid organs

a. Ballistic and Penetrating Trauma
There are three primary mechanisms of injury caused by projectiles.
1. Crushing/laceration - the missile track through the target.
2. Cavitation - pressure waves generated by medium and high velocity
missiles (see definition below) disrupt tissues remote from the
projectile\'s path. The missile track can also be widened
by tumbling bullets.
3. Fragmentation - primary - pieces of missile ; secondary - anatomical
structures that are shattered and displaced.

Different ammunition types have different energy transfer
characteristics.
Armour-piercing rounds transfer a lesser percentage of their energy
to a target (blowthrough), while hollow points, fletchettes and shot are
designed to transfer nearly all their kinetic energy into a target.

**Proposed combat variant :-
Ammo type    Damage multiplier
AP, APDS           0.5
HP, fletchette     0.9
shot               1.0
HEAP               0.5 of velocity component of energy
HE                 1.0
Damage is sustained only if armour is breached, unless armour is
flexible ; see blunt trauma, below.

Velocity Definitions
The speed of sound is about 1115ft/s (340.3m/s) at sea level at one
atmosphere pressure and 15 degrees Celsius.
    Low-velocity  < 1000ft/s   (304.8m/s)
    Medium          1-2000ft/s (304.8 to 609.6m/s)
    High          > 2500ft/s   (762m/s)
    Hypervelocity > 5000ft/s   (1524m/s)
Cavitation and fragmentation effects predominate at higher energies
(medium to high velocity).
Hypervelocity missiles produce crater-like wounds. The differences
between blast injuries and high velocity missile injury decrease with
increased missile energy.

For reference :-
Objects moving faster than 150ft/sec (45.72m/s) will penetrate
skin.
Objects moving faster than 195ft/sec (59.44m/s) will fracture bone.
This is regardless of surface area or shape.

Forensic aspects :- (How far away was the gun from the victim??)
Rifled weapons :-
   Muzzle abrasion - point blank
   Gases present in victim\'s clothing, etc. : 1-3" (2 to 7.6cm)
   Burned powder grains, soot : 1-3"
   Unburned powder grains : 1-2\' (30-60cm)
Tattooing and abrasions ensue from the above.
   Metal fragments (bullet, primer) : <=6\' (1.8m)
Shotguns :-
   As above, plus :-
   Single entry wound < 2m
   Wound < 1" in diameter <=18"
   Wadding in wound 2-6m
Entry wounds will be clean holes beyond about 2 m, except with close
range shotgun and hypervelocity missile wounds, which are almost
indistinguishable from blast (massive tissue destruction).
Exit wounds are usually irregular without an abraded perimeter.

Blades :
A blade is sharp because the edge (tip) has a very small surface area.
The force applied in cutting may be small, but the pressure at the
points of contact is enormous (pressure = force/area), so the surface
being cut yields.

(Note that while ballistic cloth will stop bullets, it doesn\'t stop
blades without special reinforcement eg. mesh underlay or ceramic/metal
inserts).

Forensic aside : Stab wounds (depth > width) or incisions (cuts, width >
depth) look different from chopping wounds. All such injuries are well
demarcated with sharp edges.
Nerves and blood vessels may bridge a chop wound (higher tensile
strength than skin) ; they will not be present in a stab wound or cut.

b. Blunt trauma
An example :-
Motor vehicle accidents are a significant cause of death in the
Real World (ca. 50000 road fatalities in the U.S. last year).

Energy transfer to vehicle occupants is enormous :-
At 55mph (88.5km/h or 24.6m/s), a 180lb (81.6kg) person has
a kinetic energy of [ 0.5 X 81.6 X (24.6)^2 ] or 24690J - more than the
muzzle energy of a .50 machine gun round!
This is dissipated very rapidly in a collision.

Injury is sustained because of the development of pressure waves
radiating from the points of impact through the victim.

Some key structures eg. the aorta, portal vein, spinal cord, and
oesophagus will resonate and rupture, with enough energy. Bone shatters.

Velocity (m/sec) %blunt trauma/fracture    %lethality
2.6              >1                        -
6.6              ~50                       >1
17.0             99                        ~50
44.5             -                         99
This table assumes impact with a relatively rigid surface.
(Real World data, TL 7-8)

Considering Traveller combat :- flexible armour offers some protection,
but some energy will be transmitted to the target (eg. the extensive
bruising+ sustained when one is shot in a Kevlar-protected area).
** roughly as per T4 : one point of damage per dice penetrates flexible
armour to simulate this.

Forensic aspects : Lacerations occur when enough blunt force has been
applied to disrupt the skin. They are typically irregular in outline
with edge abrasions. Nerves and vessels may bridge wound.
Abrasions are usually secondary to being dragged. Skin tags usually
identify the direction of dragging.
A yellowing bruise is at least two days old. Bruising must be
differentiated from lividity (caused by dependent pooling of blood in
the recently deceased) and marbling (which is due to bacterial action on
blood pigments and doesn\'t appear for two to three days after death).

c. Blast
Explosion injuries can be considered to be a mixture of blunt (blast
overpressure) and penetrating (fragment) trauma.
Air-containing tissues are quite susceptible to injury.
Lung damage and eardrum rupture require relatively little overpressure
to produce.
The human body is surprisingly robust, however.

Peak Overpressure (kPa)  Effect
3 to 7                   window glass shatters
10 to 38                 concrete shatters
20 to 60                 brick shears apart
> 69                     lung damage will occur
90 to 130                50% chance of eardrum rupture
160 to 230               1% chance of death
230 to 400               50% chance of death
400+                     100% chance of death
One atmosphere = 101.3kPa, 7kPa ~1 psi.

I see a MASSIVE interstellar incident building there.

A megacorp finds a shipful of Kraang somehow and declairs them salvage,
ignoring the claims of self awareness and independence of the crew. One of
the crew manages to deploy a log bouy which is found by the Kranng\'s Hiver
allies and the message gets passed to the Kraang "homeland".

I recall something similar as one of the causes of the War of 1812.

Her actual displacement weight was 50,700 mtons.  The Hood weighed in at
48,400 and the Rodney was 41,000.  These are the "fully loaded" weights.
Bismarck had 8x15" guns, Hood had 8x15" guns and the Rodney had 9x16" guns.
Two other "players" were the Prince of Wales and the King George V. and they
weighed in at 44,400 mtons each sporting 10x14" guns. All other ships were
in a support role as far as I\'m concerned.

They all may have the same type of interstellar travel, but this isn\'t
nescessarily a hint of influence by higher beings as much as it is a fact
that the laws of physics govern all races, and if jump is the only method
of FTL travel in the Traveler Canon, then everyone has to use Jump.

Hovever, if after careful comparison it can be shown that all the jump
drives have the same layouts, ie same cooling tecniques, power
distributions, etc., then that is evidence of influence.

Maybe Grandpa missed :). Even Grandpa can misjump.

Repair ships don\'t nescessarily have to be huge, just large enough to hold
all the machine tools and part assembly areas to overhaul the vessle. You
don\'t need to be able to hold an entire battleship to overhaul the jump
drive, just maybe enough space to hold the drive, crane it over to the
tender if nescessary, or just have one built on the tender or shipped in
and swapped. Also, you could have 2 or 3 working on one ship or one tender
working on 2 or 3 ships. In all reality the upper service limit is more of
a function of how much work needs to be done per system to be repaired.
Someone with some time on their hands could come up with a repair points
system to govern this.

From: DustyLV769@aol.com <DustyLV769@aol.com>

 This does not exactly do justice to the RN...Vice Adm. Holland on the Hood
was not the most competent line officer in the RN.  He initially engaged the
Prinz Eugen and ordered  Prince of Wales to do the same (Prince of Wales
soon
realized he had misidentified the Prinz Eugen and shifted fire on his own).
Also, the RN ships were approaching the Germans bow-on in a effort to close
the range ASAP (this was most likely due to Hood\'s vulnerability to plunging
fire...which was dramatically demonstrated in short order); however, this
reduced thier effective firepower by 50% as well.  I believe that the
engagement was not well though out on the British side; but I think the
Hood,
at least was a fair match for the Bismarck (Prince of Wales had just been
commisioned...they still had civilian contracters working on board during
the
battle!!)

DustyLV769@aol.com

I tend to agree with both Dom and Dusty.  The battle was enjoyed for barely
3 minutes when Hood blew up and sank.  Some time during the initial attack
on the Prinz Eugen the PoW swung her guns around on the Bismark and opened
fire. Both the Prinz Eugen and the Bismarck concentrated their fire on the
Hood with the results as stated.  The PoW fired several more salvoes at
Bismarck even though stunned by the Hood\'s disastrous demise. ONE of the
rounds struck the Bismarck at or below the waterline opening up a fuel tank
and allowing the fuel to be contaminated. What\'s really wierd is on the 21st
of May the Bismarck had an opportunity to top off her tanks but didn\'t take
it. The Prinz Eugen did. If she had, she would have had enough fuel to make
a run to South America but instead had to circle back toward Europe and the
rest as they say is history.

One other point, the Hood was launched Oct. 22, 1918 and commissioned Mar.
5, 1920.  Technology had swept past her in the ensuing 20 years. She had
been scheduled for a full refit and would have had her decks strengthened
but that was put on hold BECAUSE the Bismarck sailed. The PoW did indeed
have civilian "yard workers" on board when the battle commenced and this was
also because she had been activated by the Bismarck\'s sailing. A number of
things went wrong with the PoW during the engagement only one of which was a
turret malfunction.  After being bracketed by salvoes from both the Bismarck
and the Prinz Eugen she turned tail, poared on the smoke and disappeared
from the battle. She later returned and picked three survivors from Hood.

Ocean-bound comerce raiders (with the exception, perhaps, of deep diving
submarines) didn\'t have a ready means of unpursuable escape like jump
engines. Commerce raiders could come in deep with enough fuel to jump out,
drift in and pick targets, and when the heat got to hot, leave. This would
not only have the affect of hurting commerce, but weekening front line
forces by drawing off other heavy assets to cover against such hit and runs.

[snip

IMTU, TL=$.  I have always applied liberal price modifications to
technologically superior items.  I do it somewhat capriciously,
jacking up prices for high tech stuff the further the adventurers are
from high tech worlds.  For instance, when a particular group was in
need of some laser weapons for an extermination project, they found
that they were three jumps from the closest world capable of producing
the weapons in bulk.  Obviously, the players squawked about having to
pay five times the listed NEW price for USED laser pistols, but they
paid.

I never let the players take tech for granted.  I\'m sorry, but there
aren\'t going to be any TL-12 wrist comm repair technicians on a TL-8
agricultural world.  Unless a ship owner/operator specifically
purchased an ultra-light TL-13 vacc suit someplace, he\'s going to have
to expect to be clunking around in a TL-8 or 9 surplus suit during
combat aboard.

On the other hand, smart merchants can make a bundle by making a few
runs with high tech mining equipment in exchange for ore at a belter
colony ten parsecs away, too.  But fair is fair!

It\'s also likely this misconfiguration was responsible for the

I\'ve never thought Virus was psionic in any way... (what was that gave you
that impression, i\'m curious?)  There would need to be some vector for
infection though, other than the physical "commando chip" style...  Do the
Krraaang! have any data sockets or other way to directly interface w/

How would an artificial race use computers, or just plug one of themselves
into the "ship?"  For that matter how were the Krraaang! created?  Kind of
like the Mrmrnmhrm from Star Control (which were created by the "Precursors")?

mmm...  MT Ref\'s Companion seems to mention them... "At tech level 21, the
Jump6 barrier is finally breached with the appearance of starship-sized matter
transport portals."  Maybe they weren\'t designable for ships until FFS...
that\'s just because there\'s no \'alternate tech\' of any kind.

Yes, I can, but then again, ESPN & ESPN 2 would whore for anyone with

Well, at least "The Fifth Frontier War" survived is some form...

Actually I did, but I made an error along the way -- I lost a factor of 1/2:

The probability that a mainworld\'s jump limit (as seen from all angles) is
masked is proportional to the solid angle (in steradians) subtended by a
disk equal in radius to the primary\'s jump limit minus the mainworld\'s jump
limit, at the mainworld\'s orbital radius, as a fraction of 4*pi steradians.
This neglects parallax, but for the distances involved all lines of
sight/flight are essentially parallel anyway. (Cases where parallax is
important -- microjumps -- are left as an exercise for the interested
reader.) To find the solid angle, divide the area subtended by the disk by
the area of a sphere of orbital radius. Hence:

Area (disk) = 2*pi*a*h, where a is orbital radius (semi-major axis), and h
= a - sqrt(a^2 - (R - r)^2), and R and r are the jump limits of primary and
mainworld, respectively.

Area (sphere) = 4*pi*a^2.

Masked = 2*pi*a*h / 4*pi*a^2 = h/2a = (a - sqrt(a^2 - (R - r)^2))/2a
					  = (1 - sqrt(1 - (R - r)^2 / a^2))/2.
										^^^
Free = 1 - Masked.

Revised table follows:

Spec.	Dia.	100D	100D	Habit.	Free	Free	Free
Class	(Sols) (au) 	(orb)	Zone	(Sz 0)	(LGG)	(3d)

Effects on Trade and Commerce:

Using CT Book 6 (Scouts), p. 28, for spectral class frequencies (whether
accurate or not), and looking only at main sequence (size V) stars, only
21.4% of all jumps on average will be to or from unmasked mainworlds, most
of those around class F primaries:

Spectral 	
Class		Free(%)	Stars(%)	Total Free
B0		100.0%		0.0%		0.0%	
B5		99.2%		0.0%		0.0%	
A0		98.6%		1.4%		1.4%	
A5		97.6%		1.4%		1.4%	
F0		95.1%		8.1%		7.7%	
F5		85.8%		8.1%		7.0%	
G0		60.6%		6.6%		4.0%	
G5		0.0%		6.6%		0.0%	
K0		0.0%		8.2%		0.0%	
K5		0.0%		8.2%		0.0%	
M0+		0.0%		51.3%		0.0%	
						21.4%	

Assuming that jumps may freely begin and end *beyond* the 100D limit, the
maximum distance required to clear the primary\'s jump masking is equal to
the primary\'s jump limit radius; such a jump skims the edge of the
primary\'s jump sphere on a tangent line. Distances and travel times (at 1G)
are given below:

Spect. Dia. 	100D 	Run 	Stand 
Class	(Sols)	(au)	(hrs)	(hrs)	
O5	18.00	16.84	199.1	281.5	
B0	7.40	6.92	127.6	180.5	
B5	3.80	3.56	91.5	129.4	
A0	2.50	2.34	74.2	104.9	
A5	1.70	1.59	61.2	86.5	
F0	1.30	1.22	53.5	75.7	
F5	1.20	1.12	51.4	72.7	
G0	1.05	0.98	48.1	68.0	
G5	0.93	0.87	45.2	64.0	
K0	0.85	0.80	43.3	61.2	
K5	0.74	0.69	40.4	57.1	
M0	0.63	0.59	37.2	52.7	
M5	0.32	0.30	26.5	37.5	
M8	0.13	0.12	16.9	23.9	


The weighted average maxima, including free jumps, are +25.8 hours (running
jump, at 1G) and +36.4 hours (standing jump, at 1G). These apply equally at
origin and destination. Average times are +21.7 hours and +30.6 hours,
respectively.

Conclusions:  Even worst case, jump masking adds (on average) at most a day
to a day and a half to each end of an interstellar jump.  This reduces
canonical port time from 6-1/2 days to 4-5 days: well within the capability
of most freight liners to discharge and load. Minimum possible turnaround
time (arrival to arrival), using conventional (non-LASH/tender) designs,
goes up from 8-1/2 days (41 trips per year) to 10 days (35 trips per year).
This is closer to the canonical value of 14 days (25 trips per year). Free
traders may have a harder time making 25 trips a year, but who said life
was fair?
