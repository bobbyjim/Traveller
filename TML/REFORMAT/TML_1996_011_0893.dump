        That\'s the whole point I\'m trying to make -- THE STATISTICS WILL BE
THE SAME! For the non-gearhead, you take a chart of standard systems and
plug them in, just like the original Traveller Book 2. But those standard
systems were designed using the GH rules, and GearHeads can _add_ to those
standard systems by designing their own. So _nobody_ is hosed!

        Let me repeat that ... standard materials published by _anybody_
WILL BE THE SAME FOR GEARHEADS AND NONGEARHEADS! The user (you) neither
cares nor needs to know the details. Whether the starship or whatever was
built using off-the-shelf systems or lovingly handcrafted by somebody who
enjoys it, its use in gaming will be the same. Don\'t shut out the gearheads!

>Sorry, give me a 200 ton hull, the engines that go J2 2G and let me get busy

        That\'s exactly what people have been suggesting! And if somebody
comes along and wants a 225T hull, he can design it and it will be
completely consistent with everything else.

        More than slight exaggeration. All the considerations of
foot-pounds, Joules, etc. are done by whoever designed the weapon, even in
TNE. All you need and get is "4 dice of damage, with a penetration of x."
Not very difficult to say "his armor absorbs 2 dice, so you do 2 dice of
damage." In fact, what you do get is exactly:

        I don\'t see how you _can\'t_ do this using TNE. I have.

        Since there are many people who _want_ more detail than you seem to,
I would point out one thing

                It\'s easier to consistently _REMOVE_ details than
                it is to add them.

        So if you go with the low detail, the more detail people ARE hosed.
But if you go with the moderate detail, the low detail people can quite
easily extract what they need and ignore the rest. Don\'t you already do that?

Please find below some suggested RSB errata further to or correcting
those in TML Digest 545. Most points stem from Alvin Plummer noticing
the wandering Zhodani naval base at Zircon (on David Golden\'s WWW pages,
in http://www2.csn.net/~goldend/traveller/Errata/RSBErrata.html).

page 35, Notes for Regency UWP Data.
Base Code \'J\' (Non-Imperial Naval Base) should be added to those listed
and the appropriate map symbol should be added (it was an open Five-
Pointed Star in the good old days).

page 37, Jewell Sector Map/UPP Listing.
Zircon should have a type J base and not type Z, and the map should be
changed to the appropriate symbol (per the map included with MTJ1 and
listings in MTJ3).

page 44, Daryen Subsector, Map/UPP Listing
(Replaces my previously suggested errata).
The simplest method of reconciling the bases shown on the map and on the
UPP listing for the Darrian Confederation with past data (MTJ 1 and 3)
is as follows.
    1. Replace all type N bases with type J.
    2. Retain all type M bases unchanged.
The UPP listing incorrrectly shows Nonym as having a type M base in
1117, this should be corrected as type J (per MTJ1 and 3). Whether Nonym
should have a type J base isn 1202 is moot. One possible reasons for the
downgrading of the base at Nonym is the great weakening of Sword Worlds
strength and a move to a more all-round defense strategy by the Darrian
Confederation Navy.

Of course, the type J base may have been intended to be consigned to the
dustbin of history. If so, all of the foregoing bases should be type M
without exception. However, the varying symbols employed rather suggest
a mistake rather than any sort of plan.

page 50, Glisten Subsector, Map.
Crout (2232) is shown as having a naval base. This is probably an error
as the UPP listing does not show it, nor did it previously have a naval
base in any official source.

page 62, Usani Subsector, Map.
Liran (1923) should be shown as a High Population world (upper case) AND
the starport is incorrectly shown as B instead of A.

page 64, Gulf Subsector, Map.
Tuwayk (0339) should be shown as a High Population world (upper case)
AND the starport is incorrectly shown as B instead of A. Lucifer (0436)
should have a B type starport (not D as I suggested or X as per the
map).

page 66, Pax Rulin Subsector, Map.
Ktaofilr (2102) should be shown with an A starport, not B.

I shall try and muster the energy to construct a consolidated errata and
post it to the list.

Why so? I don\'t know what the debate on these lists over Virus was like, but
I have not met one person in the gaming scene locally who thinks Virus is
anything but a laughably ridiculous piece of ****. Regardless of whether
*you*, dear reader, agree with this summation or not, the point I\'m going
to make is valid ...

Why assume that anything is inevitable? Why not have CTrav and MTrav era
settings now republished as part of a *new timeline* for all those long-
term players who were totally pissed off by the bad joke that was Virus?
Have an alternative ending for the Rebellion ... and let the players work
their way through it, don\'t just jump 70 or 80 years into the future!

This in no way invalidates the TNE future ... keep on developing that
separately, assuming that Virus happened the way it did. Let the sales
of the assorted gear sort out the problem.

This leaves room for a lot of common ground ... the basic system (whatever
Marc Miller chooses that to be) will be the same for both, gear design will
be the same for both. Only the background will be different ... and the
CT/MTrav era stuff that is republished will have a lot of crossover value
for TNE era stuff anyway ... as "history".

Solves the problem neatly! Keeps everyone happy ... the "one true way"
supporters on *both* sides excepted, of course!

time of MTrav, is its mania with rating things in *real world* terms. As
we have seen, the "advanced" tech of MTrav has been replaced in many
instances with *different* "advanced tech" of TNE simply because of real
world developments.

Now, I know this is going to be controversial, but as a Designer myself,
I do *not* design design rules which use real world values! Why? Simple,
they are inevitably (and sooner than you think, *always*!) going to be
found too be incorrect (either too optimistic or too pessimistic).

The real success of CT Starship Design as laid out in Book #3 Starships and
Book #5 High Guard was that there was no crossover with real world values.
Everyone could happily design Starships without the least concern that they
may not live up to realistic values - there was simply no way to compare!

This should apply for *all* vehicles. As for other equipment, yes, even guns!
there should be *no* design sequence per se, perhaps some rules for having a
weapon *customised*, but no more. There is no realistic way that you can
do it and not be caught out ... look at the whole Traveller/Twilight 2000
/2300 AD universe. Look at the "advanced" turretless tanks of TW:2000 - never
got beyond the drawing board; the G-11 and Caseless ammo weapons, still not
in production (and given Bundeswehr funding cuts as result of unification,
seemingly never likely to, either), and likely not to be, ever; and now the
latest "fad" technology of FF&S, "electro-thermal combustion" rounds. In all
likelihood these, too, will fall by the wayside in a year or two - and FF&S
will have to replace them with something else "you beaut" that, in turn, will
have to be replaced soon down the track.

Nope, just give us some advanced weapon designs for each TL (after doing some
serious hack and slash surgery on the curreny TL rating system\'s idiocies)
and GMs will be happy enough to create new weapons based on what "seems
reaonable" compared to existing designs. After all, how in the hell do you
think CT Weapons (and MTrav weapons, of course) were "designed" - by the
"seems reasonable" rule, of course!!!

The rest is a mere chimera. Most players and GMs (as a number of people
have noted) have neither the time nor the desire to go through the design
rules as they exist, anyway. And for ghu\'s sake, make it possible to design
a spaceship as it was in CTrav ... step by step, with no having to cut and
fit step 13 before you can do step 3 as in MTrav and TNE!

Huh?  Assuming that you use plug-in weapons, etc. (admitidly hard to do
in FFS as it was published) a FFS ship is still pretty step by step.  HG
forces you to reserve space for about the PP you want, then fit it in
once you really know what size you need... thus leaving an iteritive
process in the system (unless you don\'t bother to optimize the design).

The real problem is the order (or lack thereof) that they have you do
stuff, not the actual system.  Make hull.  Put required stuff in (all
volume based----drives, LS, EMM, fuel, etc.).  Put extra stuff in.  Check
PP vs. space left (same as HG).  Done.

And as for there being no way to base the technologies on present
systems, I don\'t buy it.  It doesn\'t say that caseless ammo is *the*
ammo of whatever TL.  So what if we never end up using it here, some
other world of similar TL might (the caseless ammo company was owned by
the defense minister on that world, so even though it was found to be
not a really good idea one place, it got used there anyway).  And
besides, I think that some of the technical information helps give
useful information to some players.

Say the PC is a pilot... highly trained, must know a fair bit of
physics.  If the actual player is an insurance adjuster (like my friend
Tom :-) it might be interesting for him to know about the way his drives
work (energy in, energy out, etc.).  Or if he\'s military how much energy
per cm^2 it takes to bore holes in his ship.  Any number of things that
the detailed designs can/could give.

Of course this is all only true when the system is at least
consistant----and easy to read/use.

You can wargame while roleplaying or just roleplay with TNE.
The game mechanic are better to use because there are fewer
gape in the rules then before. Once you get going the rules become
easy almost simple to use.

This game Is about details, Its not a space opera, its about going
out there and doing it from the nuts and bolts and up.

  I have been role playing for four years. I have only played

Anyone out there who bought Hard Times? Examine it again! By 1126, the
Imperium had been reduced to a complete mix of order and chaos, high and low
tech, controlled military societies through to worlds lost due to lack of
trade, tech, whatever.

* A perfect mixed environment - any adventure you could want from merchant
trading to rediscovering lost worlds.

* And in the _near_ future, so you could still use the same characters from
CT and MT games. The same major players were still around. All that history
built up in CT and MT still _meant_ something.

* No Virus needed to cause the disruption - it had already happened! The
Virus has caused so much controversy, e.g. pitiful excuses about maintaining
anti-Virus patrols over boundaries that were billions of times too huge in
the 2D mapping system, let alone considering 3D!!!!

The only reason I can see that GDW went for the Virus was because they
needed a new setting to go with their new rules system in their "unify and
get back the rights from DGP" approach, and \'dark and dismal\' seemed to be
the order of the day (and still is, judging by the better selling current RPGs).

I\'m quite happy with the RC setting, but it didn\'t need to be the _only_
bastion of hope (apart from the "oops, better leave somewhere with high tech
to stop the CT/MT fans getting p*ssed off" Regency).

In the Hard Times setting groups such as the RC could have sprung up in any
of the Wilds areas. They would still have had the same adventure
opportunities and when they expanded to meet the still surviving power
bases, just think of the possibilities for battles, diplomacy, etc. that
could have occurred without each such event over-turning the _whole_ of the
Imperium setting.

Anyway, hopefully Marc is listening...

        I think the biggest problem was not with the rules, but the setting.
Many people reacted violently to the whole Virus setting, and since they
didn\'t like the setting decided they didn\'t like the rules ... hence never
got going. Which is why I think it critically important that any new rules
be as divorced from a specific setting as the original Classic Traveller
rules were.

 No, I never worked up any sort of stats for the dragons.  Take the
 little bit of information about them that\'s there, and dilute
 liberally with "supercow" from H. Beam Piper\'s "Lone Star Planet"
 (pub. as "Planet for Texans" in some magazines and areas).  Then,
 draw your own conclusions.

    Of course these designs won\'t necessarily be as efficient as specialty

    And hopefully different design considerations for the different races too.

Granted a lot of people did not like the virus. However in order to
devorce the back ground from the rules there would have to be more
then one background to choose from. it is possible but resorce
hungry. Games like rolemaster have this with different sorce books
for different backgrounds.

Althoe now that I think about it, This seems to be a good Idea for
this game. That way more people could be happy with there preferred
background and not tied to just one.

After a time one would likly come out on top but the choices would
still be there. Making the modules nonspesific would be hard, but it
has been don in battletech. One module could be used with all of the
rule sets from Roleplaying to strategic gaming.

I have to disagree with this. I think that the ability
to rate things in Real World(tm) terms is one of the
best things in Traveller.

Design rules are the only way to make plausible

and weapons.

I would be highly surprised if the caseless .223 Uzel
bolt-action rifle would prove to be nonexistent of "not
in production", and vanish from gun cabinet.

The "seems reasonable" (or "MuTu method") can easily
lead to glaring reality problems. I ran into this
problem when I took part in weapon damage research
project in 1992-93, when I was stationed in Finnish
Defense Forces medical school in Lahti. The project is
called "Small high-velocity projectiles effect on
living tissue", and it examines the relations between
projectile properties and caused tissue damage. Though
this project is not unique (there were similar projects
in Sweden, US and Russia), it uses very large database
and tissue damage is evaluated by pathologist. In some
popular weapon damage studies, the damage was evaluated
by "seems reasonable" method, and these studies are
considered to have only limited scientific value.

In some other roleplaying games, the weapon damage
values appear to be generated by "shake the numbers out
from your sleeve" method, and touch the surface of
reality only by accident. The same thing can happen
when a GM, with no knowledge of real weapon design,
generates new weapons for his games.

"This is tachyon interference pistol. It has ROF 50,
DV 25, PEN 1/500, no recoil, unlimited range, and fires
10000 shots when powered by two AAA cells."
"How it works? Well, I don\'t have the slightest idea..."

Yes. The current FFS rules are just a framework, upon
which one can build more. Some parts of design rules
are oversimplified (vehicle speed formula), too complex
(hull size table can be expressed as single formula),
or unclear (warhead mass table is nonlinear).

They do to an extent.  In the Regency Sourcebook they describe
Callibration Points--Artifically created stations in deep space for
Military use.  In this case, they are used as alternate paths across
the Great Rift and require something like J5 or J6 ships to even reach
them.

As for CPs/Way Points inside settled space, they could certainly
exist, but the need would have to be great.  They take considerable
time to construct and would be expensive to maintain--It would
probably be cheaper to build a small fleet of high-jump capable ships.

Just adding to the TNE/MT/CT and FFS debate -

Basically, TNE is the best rules set of the three (and YES I have used
them all). It is the only one that is comprehensive and developed enough.
The character generation is fine, combat rules are fine, the task system
works well etc, etc.

I do agree that the timeline used to reach the setting that was used was
rediculous, and it was that IMHO that is the root of most of the problems
anti-TNE types have with it. MM\'s proposal of having a universal rules
set with several different backround is perfect, it keeps everyone happy.

Quite why anyone wants to go back to MT I don\'t know (and as for CT, are
you MAD?). TNE is by far the most complete rules set of the three. I
believe that the majority of debate concerns the setting, which with MM\'s
plans is no longer a problem.

Now, as for FFS. Personally I think it is bloody good. OK, it has a few
problems with it and needs a few things tweaked, but the principle is
amazing. As was very well argued by someone (sorry, I forget who), don\'t
not publish an FFS style book just because some people find it too
complicated or cannot spare the time to use it fully. I you don\'t want
all that detail, DON\'T USE IT! Just look at the final stats (range,
damage, pen or speed, duration, and weapons etc, etc). Some people LIKE
the detail.

If you are just need a ship that the players are taking a passage on, you
don\'t need to design it with FFS anyway - all you need to know is size,
jump, maneuvre, staterooms, and weapons. Who cares what it\'s weight is
to the nearest metric ton? The same for weapons. If all you want is the
final stats, that all you need to use. Other people like the detail, and
anyway, the detail (ME etc) is only used IN ORDER TO find out the final
stats. They are only a means to an end.

Personally, if any new Traveller rules set does not contain a design
sequence as detailed as that in FFS, then I shall stick with TNE and just
buy a few of the new background supplements.

So there - all those who don\'t like FFS, don\'t bloody well use it, and
don\'t dictate to those who do like it what they should or should not use.

1.  I have a question for the more experienced of Travellers.  I\'m about to
begin a campaign that contains a Vargr NPC.  The grandparents of this Vargr,
along with a couple other Vargr families, were stranded during the wars that
followed the rebellion(CT/MT traditionalist forgive).  This Vargr has been
raised in a human society.  My question is this, would it be possible for
this Vargr to be more "Domesticated" than "Wild"?  I mean most Vargr display
a tendency to stay in Packs with a constant CHR "battle" over who the leader
will be, much like the wild canines they descend from.  However, a Vargr
that was raised in a post-imperial human culture, IMO, would exhibit more of
the tendencies of a domesticated canine(ie, loyalty).  The Vargr in this
campaign (as I have it planned thus far) is a loyal companion to the leader
of the PC group.  It would detract from the campaign to constantly worry
about CHR issues.  Is this possible, or is the CHR "battle" of the Vargr a
instinctive response?

2. I haven\'t had the benefit of experiencing CT; however, I did play MT for
a short period of time(thanks Jim, Bobby, & Bret if you\'re listening).  I
enjoy TNE now though.  I understand some of the gripes about TNE, but I
still like it.  Much of the original TNE work seems to be "tongue-in-cheek"
and a big joke. (RCES - "arses",  Ithklur, Virus, etc.)  The attempts to
"make up" with Traveller failed miserably(sp) and so did GDW and almost
Traveller.  I think Mr. Miller has already been thinking about the best
possible solution, a collection of various eras.  My lack of experience
prevents me from making intelligent comments comparing the rules systems,
but I can speak to the history.  I would hate to lose the TNE era as much as
others would hate to lose the CT & MT eras.  I would also like to see other
eras of both history and future.  Finally, I think the most important
information any of us can give Mr. Miller is our pledge of support.  I know
that if I do lose the TNE era and Mr. Miller chooses an alternate resolution
to the rebellion, I will still buy Traveller.  The CT history is set and
from there it grew into the TNE history, but it is still Traveller (dispite
what the "TNE is not Traveller" groups say), and Mr. Miller, barring extreme
changes to the storyline, I will still buy Traveller.

The turretless tanks did show up as a few prototype-only models; I think there
is one in front of the big tank plant in Michigan (can\'t remember the location,
but I had seen it there about three years ago).  The G-11 is in production on a
customer-order basis, as far as I know; I have seen several working G-11s being
fired at some defense industry shows.  In both cases, somebody had a neat and
potentially-viable idea, but the cost-effectiveness of the idea left something
to be desired.

As for weapons design rules, the "slugthrower" rules seem to be the ones that
most annoy people from a reality standpoint; the artillery rules come out
fairly well, and I think most people who use FF&S are happy enough with the
energy weapons rules (especially after energy weapons were strengthened by
GDW)  There is still some controversy about laser power, but even the laser
rules seem to be accepted.  The lack of rules or guidelines for creating wapons
was a significant weakness in CT and MT.  The multiple versions of some of the
starship heavy weapons helped, but I always found the generic definition of
lasers and missiles to be ridiculous, and the very limited list of personal and
support weapons to be somewhat sad.

Not everybody wants to go through the effort of designing detailed weapons
system, but the sales and usage figures for FF&S show that there are plenty of
people that do.  I have no objection to people not using such rules, and I do
think there should be a large list of "pre-built" components that allows High
Guard-like quick ship and vehicle designs.  However, it is foolishly
self-limiting to insist that just because something is inconvenient to some
people, it should be removed.   If you can provide a consistent, simpler
alternate path for those who don\'t want/need detail, that is the better
solution.  It is better to cater to both markets instead of just mindlessly
alienating one of them.  The Virus/Reformation Coalition example should be
proof of that.

Bad idea.  You\'re looking at this more from the perspective of a TNE hater,
which apparently you are.  Though theoretically this pleases both sides, what
you\'d end up with is the anti-Virus, anti-TNEers, slowly trying to burn the
bridges to the New Era stuff so that eventually the canon becomes this vision of
playing out the next 70-80 years.

Traveller should have _one_ timeline, not several.  At least the official
version.  Otherwise, you risk fragmenting and ruining one of the game\'s best
features:  it\'s rich historical background.  If individual refs want to develop
their own post-Rebellion eras, more power to them.  But none of the official,
published, canonized timelines should fragment or otherwise degrade what has
been published to date.

I have another solution:  Traveller 1999.  Create a series of sourcebooks and
other collateral in which you scoot the Trav timeline ahead another 800 years to
the _next_ era, in which the Imperium and surrounding states have metamorphosed
into the 4th Imperium, or whatever.  It won\'t exactly be the 3rd Imperium, but
at least civilized space as we know it will once again be recognizable.  Virus
can be reduced to nil or made a part of society.

I was pissed, too, when I found out about the extent of Virus and all that.  But
I think it\'s ridiculous for people to complain about the canonized version when
they can just as well create their own.  Also, Phil, you mentioned never having
heard anyone say they thought Virus was a good idea.  I think you probably just
didn\'t _listen_ to those who did.  For the record, you\'ve now heard someone say
it.  Virus was a good idea.  Now the RCES and the single storyline GDW tried to
compel us to use, that\'s another story entirely!

>>The single biggest problem that faces Traveller, increasingly from the time of
MTrav, is its mania with rating things in *real world* terms. As we have seen,
the "advanced" tech of MTrav has been replaced in many instances with
*different* "advanced tech" of TNE simply because of real world developments.<<

I read your first post on your problem with the tech levels some weeks back
about how it\'s completely unworkable, etc.  Now it\'s _my_ turn to say I\'ve never
heard someone say something before.  Sure the TL system ain\'t perfect, but it
makes do.  And I haven\'t heard much in the way of complaints to the contrary
other than your own.  It puts Traveller in terms we can more or less understand,
even if it is based on the designer\'s egocentric view of current (TL-8) tech.
The system has enough ambiguity, however, that it can be molded to incorporate
new tech as it\'s discovered.

CT\'s computers with "programs" for things like "anti-hijack," "navigation," etc.
were based on late 70s, early 80s DOS- or Apple II- style computers.  Sure it\'s
anachronistic, but we\'ve done away with that.  Now we\'ve got holodynamic
displays and synaptic interfaces.  As the tech is discovered, the rules are
modified.  Also, nothing\'s to stop you from adding your own wrinkles.  If Trav
is anything, it\'s flexible.

Plus, things like the TL tables in Book 4 were terrific at outlining what sort
of technology military units at various TLs would have.  Without that, I\'d be
completely lost.

Now, I don\'t know you, Phil, but are you sure you\'re not subconsciously (or
consciously?) trying to mold Traveller into Space Opera?

This is an example of a list maintainer\'s worst nightmare.  Where do you
draw the line between censorship and trying to maintain a reasonably a list
that is for the most part not offensive to anyone.

At this point, I am not going to sensor anyone.  The few questionable
content messages are few and far in between.  If it becomes a problem then I
may have to take measures.

For those posting to the list, please try to refrain from using language
that would offend others out of a courtesy to the other Traveller fans out
there.  Please try to avoid flaming others and use alt.flame for those types
of messages.

The Traveller Mailing List and the X-Boat mailing list are both good lists
with a high signal to noise ratio and I would like it to stay that way.

Besides Emperor Strephon never flamed anyone on this list.....

Rob

    'body' => 'Recently, there has been some discussion about production times of
starships.  I thought I might attempt to shed some light on this subject.  I
am a purchasing agent at a marine shipyard and we are working on a barge
that will take us just over two years to complete.  This vessel has an
approx. steel weight of 3,000 tons.  It is constructed out of Std steel
(FF&S mass # = 8).  This barge is approx. 360\' x 90\' x 9\' or in metric 110m
x 27m x 2.7m.  This totals just over 8,000 cubic meters of displacement.
>From the Hull Size Table in FF&S this is just under 600 displacement tons.
It will take us close to ten months of actual steel construction (Welding,
fitting, erection, etc.) and nearly 18 months of outfitting(passenger
accommodations, electrical systems, water systems, painting, etc.).  Of this
time approx. 4 months will be overlap (ie. painting the midbody while we
erect the bow & stern) giving us a total construction time of 24 months.
This is a barge (ie. no internal drive mechanism), and we are one of the
most productive facilities in the small vessel marine industry.  This vessel
will be on trials for nearly six more months before it is delivered to the
customer.  The reference to the 747 must refer to tons of mass not to
displacement tonnage.  Even if it does displace 170 tons, that probably
refers to water tonnage not liquid hydrogen.  The rate numbers in FF&S are
displacement of liquid hydrogen (14 cubic meters/metric ton) not water (1
cubic meter/metric ton). A big difference.

So lets assume a 747 displaces 170 metric tonnes of water.  This would mean
170 cubic meters of volume or a rate (from the Hull Size Table) of 12 or so.
If we take the numbers at a glance and look up a rate of 170 tons on the
Hull Size Table in FF&S we get a volume of 2,380 cubic meters.  This is the
same as 84,000 cubic feet(20\' x 100\' x 42\', or a cylinder with a 10\' radius
and 267\' long) I don\'t think that\'s the same as any 747 that I\'ve seen.  I
think that even with advances in technology as they are listed, 3 years is a
quick construction time for a vessel of 4400 displacement tons.

I hope this helps clear up the water a bit.

I suppose that everyone here has seen Andy House\'s enormous map
"Imperial Scout Service Guide to the Universe" at
http://eeyore.lv-hrc.nevada.edu/~indy/sectors/sectors.html

Does HIWG formally recognise this map and the info (ie all the sector
names) in it?  Or is it done only by Mr. House\'s initative?  It seems to
have quite a but of "unoffical" information here, ie. the "Psivak",
"Brimdelish", "Dedrey", "Uuntrergab", "Hlygaash", and "Trakmani", all 2-6
sector governments/races rimward of the Aslan\'s and Hiver\'s.

If this isn\'t offical, pergapse HIWG want\'s to make it so?  I don\'t
recall any of these races in any Traveller literature...

BTW, Andy\'s email address is andyh@magnet.com.  If you\'re reading this
Mr. House, let me complement you on your remarkable work here!

Yes. The NPCs are PCs from a *current* campaign. It is set at the time of the
5FW (a different 5FW to that of GDW, for eg. the Zho 40th were wiped out by
PC\'s with an Ancient\'s weapon - Twilight\'s Peak, anyone?). I have modified our
campaign details to be a little more palatable (read "believable") for
everyone.

For example, "Count Leto" is actually _Duke_ Leto _Atreides_ - I\'m sorry, he
dates from 1982 when the player was a big fan of Dune. What else do you call a
Naval Duke (which is an easy Soc to achieve thru _High Guard_, BTW)? For the
RICE Paper, I knocked him down to a mere Count and we rolled up a Vilani surname
using the excellent LANGUAGE program available on the Net. As to his age - I
hope that the paper has left the _current_ Count\'s identity open. It may be
Leto, or a descendant. The current campaign certainly doesn\'t have all of that
"democratic" crap in it (to do with terminating noble lines, I mean); the
constitution of Tavonni (yes, Veronica, we _have_ created it!) assumes that the
"executive" arm of government belongs to the Count and his heirs, in perpetua.
The day-to-day "legislative" government is elected. I.e., the Count assumes a
similar role to the Australian Governor-General, with a few more powers and the
ability to use them (the real GG has "reserve" powers, but by convention doesn\'t
use them - except in 1975!). [OK, so I don\'t mind the feudal system in
Traveller. Look, direct rule is a very efficient form of government... as long
as you have the right "direct ruler". Cleon The Mad is _right out_!!]

"Michael B. Powell" is actually _Baden-Powell_ (does he have a first name, Mr
Traun??) - again, an early (1985) character, but what else do you call a Scout?!

The original owner of Menelvagor was Beowulf Heyerdahl, with his sister Heidi
Maria - these haven\'t been changed. Yes "Beowulf" came from "Free Trader
Beowulf calling...Help!" - the cover of the little black books. The surname
should be obvious to anyone who has read about Easter Island and the Kon-tiki
expeditions - a perfect name for an adventurer and traveller (which is what
Thor Heyerdahl _is_). It fits a Sword Worlder (Nordic/Germanic origin,
remember?) to a tee.

BTW, "Menelvagor" is the hobbits\'<tm> name for Orion, the "Swordsman of the
Sky" - lifted from _Lord of the Rings_. But what a great name for a SW company!

The date of the actual campaign (c. 1105-10) is the reason that early history
is more extensive, and 1130-1201 is patchy. The development timeline has been
extended to fit GDW\'s "real" history. However, I think that the really early
history, to do with the "buffer zone" idea, fits well into "real" history
without modification. It offers an explaination as to why the Vilis/Lanth
subsectors look like they do - esp. ITO the settlement patterns from _The
Spinward Marches Campaign_.

I can post the (revised) NPCs, if you like. Just let me get onto Andrew Madden
("Leto") and see if he can dig out Leto\'s stats.

Subj:New timeline?  No way!

Responding to Phil McGregor:

>>Why not have CTrav and MTrav era settings now republished as part of a *new
timeline* for all those long- term players who were totally pissed off by the
bad joke that was Virus? Have an alternative ending for the Rebellion ... and
let the players work their way through it, don\'t just jump 70 or 80 years into
the future!<<

Bad idea.    Though theoretically this pleases both sides, what you\'d end up
with is the anti-Virus, anti-TNEers, slowly trying to burn the bridges to the
New Era stuff so that eventually the canon becomes this vision of playing out
the next 70-80 years.

Traveller should have _one_ timeline, not several.  At least the official
version.  Otherwise, you risk fragmenting and ruining one of the game\'s best
features:  it\'s rich historical background.  If individual refs want to develop
their own post-Rebellion eras, more power to them.  But none of the official,
published, canonized timelines should fragment or otherwise degrade what has
been published to date.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I agree that Traveller should have one time-line but I also strongly feel
that the TNE stuff should be discarded. There is precedent; GDW has inval-
idated alot of the early licensed stuff that has been published, including
sector maps. (They generated new ones to replace the old ones). If individual
refs want to continue with the TNE timeline, "more power to them". Discarding
TNE doesn\'t fragment the timeline, it just changes it.

I was pissed, too, when I found out about the extent of Virus and all that.  But
I think it\'s ridiculous for people to complain about the canonized version when
they can just as well create their own.

That\'s easy to say when it\'s not *your* ox that\'s getting gored. But if it\'s
true then I\'d prefer that *you* create your own continuation of the TNE time-
line while MM supports the one *I* want.

        Been off the list for a couple of years and I see not much has
changed. People are firmly planted in camps around there favorite books. The
problem is each of us see Traveller as something different. I think all
versions have their contrabution.
        CT, at least for me, is like that first D&D game I played in the mid
to later part of the 70s. It was fresh and new. To quote someone on the list
it had " zen like simplicity". This is where many of us started and we still
hold it very dear to our hearts.
        MT showed us we like in achanging traveller world. Finaly something
big happened. This where those of us who are " gearheads" could express
ourselves. I know alot of people fail to understand why some of us create
"stuff". My friends all wonder and the reason is simple I get great
enjoyment and feeling of accomplishment when I get a really cool design
done. Thats one of the reasons I play Traveller and not Gurps or any other
system.
        TNE has given my players a chance to do something they never got a
chance to do with CT or MT. They can trully change the outcome of humanity.
In CT or MT the Imperium as a whole was so large even during the rebellion
players were not much of a factor. Sometimes they did important things but
they could not shape the way society operates. In TNE since they are dealing
with such a small scale they can shape the way their world interacts. For
instance in Vampire fleets players action will determine if the coalition
will remain solidly fighting the virus or will it have to take a harder look
at the virus as a sentient being with feelings and rights.
        I know alot of people grumble about the virus. Thats Ok there is
alot of hand waving and its not a great tool for change but it was the only
one that could affect the whole imperium at once. I don\'t like the virus but
it helped in roleplaying so I have accepted it.
        My suggestion is for tweaking TNE. The system is fairly solid and
covers all the bases. For those who don\'t like the level of technical
difficulty my suggestion is don\'t use what you don\'t want too. As someone
said before its easier to take out detail than put it in. Another suggestion
for Mr Miller is vehical and equipment guides for those who don\'t like to be
"gearheads". Software would also help in this area. I was under the
impression that Mr Miller was going to be covering a bunch of times in
history of traveller so everyone should be pleased with this.
        Last I know someone was complaing about cyberware, genetics and etc.
First of all trust me the cyberware in Traveller is no where the level in
most cyberpunk campaigns and it does make sence to have it. Genetic
engineering is here now so rest assured it will be better and more popular
by then. Unfortunately progress marches on and drags us with it.
        Well put my 2 cents in

You have misunderstood ... I said that I\'ve run into no-one *LOCALLY* who
likes Virus. They think TNE is OK, and much better than MTRav (most of them,
inlcuding me) as far as the actual rule system is concerned. It\'s just that
Virus sucks in a major way.

Sure, I can accept that other people like it, probably even locals (tho I\'ve
never run across any in Sydney, or even heard of them!). I just can\'t
*understand* why they like/accept such an internally flawed (I mean, it even
contradicts its own material in places!) and anti-canon development that
seems to be completely anti-logical and designed by someone who has no idea
of the real world at all regarding security requirements for financial
institutions etc in the face of hackers and the like. Sure, Virus might be
able to crack the IFF boxes, but it would be hard pressed to be as devastating
as is claimed. That aside, *no-one* in the local groups that I known of is
a liker of the idea.

As for trying to make TNE/Trav into Space Opera, you might note that SO had
a TL system as well! Not as detailed as Trav\'s, but it was there! My dislike
for the concept was something that has become stronger/developed over the
years since then as the idiocies that it leads to have become more and more
apparent.

I say it again, though, even tho the TL system is completely unrealistic,
there are ways of explaining why the Imperium uses it. I\'ve offered one in
my "secret histories" and what I call the "archaeology option" has also been
proposed, as well as those that assume that the Imperium is deliberately
attempting to restrain tech in different ways to these two. There is simply
no value in the current TL system *unless( you make certain assumptions
about why something so flawed is used by the Imperium.

As for FF&S being "realistic" ... that\'s what I was trying to get at. It\'s
what GDW would have you believe is *advanced* RIGHT NOW. Unfortunately, as
it\'s rated in real world terms, it can, and will, be superseded as new
and better developments and new and as yet unthought of theories come into
play. There is no reason why you can\'t have something as detailed as FF&S
with an abstract value rating system ... use "Energy Points" for rating
Power Plant output and Energy weapon power demand and the like. If *you*
really want to, *you* can assume that 1 EP = 1 Mw. The rest of us can
assume anything we like, and will not be worried when *your* ideas are
dashed by the latest scientific discovery or engineering development.

That\'s all I\'m saying, don\'t tie yourself down into the current reality too
tight ... that\'s what has made significant portions of TW:2000 and Traveller
obsolete over the years. Don\'t give details that byou can be pinned down on -
give *details*, by all means, but not in real world terms!

Now I thought that the only sector information that they redid was
stuff that was either published by someone other than themselves or
DGP.  Maybe the occasional glaring error, but other than that, nothing
else.

Now, you can say that they changed around some things like m-drives,
j-drive intrisics, etc..., but all that stuff changes nuances of game
play, not the game\'s actual history.  HEPlaR vs Grav Thrusters?
Brilliant Lances combat is a little harrier, but not much more.

I\'d prefer if Traveller just put itself back together.  All we know of

Welcome back!

The Virus setting is ok and I don\'t have a problem with it, though I
prefered the days after the Fifth Frontier War.

But you need to seperate the rules from the background.  There are two
totally seperate issues being discussed as one thread.  What rules do we
want Marc use, CT, MT, or TNE, and what era do we want any new Traveller
stuff developed in: Post 5th FW, Rebellion, or Virus.  You seem attached to
the Virus era, which is cool, but how to you feel about the rules.  Would
you rather use CT/MT and run in the virus era?

into the future:

As I said earlier, it would be hard if not impossible to go back and work
from any of the previous settings without disrupting others.  Going further
into the future is the only way.

What I would like is that this current era would become another Long Night,
like after the first Imperium crashed.  Marc could start the new Traveller
several hundred years in the future.  Here are some criteria that I would
like to see:

   Virus itself is gone.  I found that no matter how hard I tried virus played
too big a role in the campaign eventhough GDW had clearly ment for it to be
a backdrop and not a day to day occurance.  Lets say a cure for Virus has
been found, and all future electronic devices are immune to Virus.

   All dead bodys, ruined cities, bazillions of plasma rifles from the
lockers of the abandoned Navy Base are gone (ok there is an occasional ruin
to find).  This will eliminate a lot of the scavanging that goes on.  IMO,
TNE\'s virus setting was too soon, lets not make it a post-apocolyptic game.

   Expand the game to a point where the Domain of Deneb and the RC have met
and fought another series of Intersteller Wars.

   And include a major tech-level jump.  Maybe its time that harnessed
Anti-Matter drives for faster than J6 engines were in the game.  FTL
communications, while expensive are possible, bascially replacing the Xboat
routes with FTL hubs.  Communications from the FTL hubs to individual worlds
would still be by normal jump means.  Have transporters functional etc.

Advantages:
  1.  Traditional CT/MT type campaigns can be ran
  2.  Virus campaigns can still be ran in fringe areas
  3.  Gives people something fresh to play with (new tech) and makes TL16 real.

Of course people could still use the new Rules to play Virus era, Rebellion
Era, and Post War era campaigns, just as they do now.

Seems like a win-win for everyone.

travel within a single sector, or two adjacent sectors.  If we had 16-20

These could be a series of mini-adventures like the small books used to

                 Beta:  Jump-6 drives

That way, we can use these in our campaigns and remain canon with the real

. . .I have done some research (http://www.boeing.com/747.html). I have
discovered that the length of a 747 is approx. 232 ft. (or about 70.75
meters).  Each seat is about 30" plus 3-4" for armrest.  I believ a 747 is
situated seat, seat, seat, isle, seat, seat, seat yeilding an approx
diameter of 20 ft. (or about 6 meters).  Vol(in Cubic Meters) =
[(PI)*r(Sqd))*length (for a cylinder).  Plug in the numbers and you get 2000
cubic meters or a FF&S rate of 143.  Add in wing, tail, and engine volumes
and a displacement tonnage of 170 is not so far fetched.

The point?  Ah, Yes, the point. (I was going somewhere with this.)  I was
wrong in my last post and my apologies go out to all those whose ideas I
might have attempted to debunk.  It appears that 170 was the correct rate
after all.

I still have problems buying the starship-a-day theory.

and it doesn\'t seem that anyone is hearing the bells for the end of
the round ;-)

Generally, MT had a lot going for it (sorry, I haven\'t even *seen* CT
let alone played the game... maybe I missed out on some huge
formative experience?), but there were some problems.  Well, apart
from the errata.  From what I can gather people liked the CGen
system, though the vehicle design was a bit on the strange side, and
thought that everthing else was cool enough.  TNE on the other hand,
is "too complicted," or a wargamers dream... combat is over-complex,
character generation isn\'t detailed enough and concentrates on
military careers.  Oh yes, the Virus sucks...

Personally, I\'m in the TNE corner.  I like the rules system since
they offer a detailed system *should it be required,* with a simple
task resoltuion system and none of those pesky "hit points" that MT
and 2300 AD were so found of.  MT, however, had the simplicity to be
instantly "playable."

Isn\'t there any middle ground that can be found?  Everyone talks
about an FF&S "Lite," but what about a Traveller "Lite?"  Two levels
of complexity... if you want the detail, then take it.  Surely this
wouldn\'t be too hard to do. (Sorry if it brings up shades of
Dangerous Journeys/Mythus and it\'s Mythus Prime and Mythus Advanced,
but there we go.)

As someone said, it\'s the background that is important.  People seem
mostly disgruntled with the whole virus-thing, which was apparently
used just to add to the death, doom and estruction at the end of the
Rebellion (like, sure, it was needed after the Final War!?).  Maybe
just take it back to the Third Imperium?  Advance it to the Fourth
Imperium?  Has anyone heard from Marc Miller about what he intends to
do (with the system, background, etc) about this?  Surely that would
stop some of the muck that is flying at the moment?

I like the sound of being able to play in different time periods
(Ancients, Terran Confederation, etc.).  Just thought that I would
say.

Huh?  Last time I was on a 747 it was (S=seat, _=isle):

SSS_SSSS_SSSThe middle row of seats may have had 5, but I always go
for the window so I\'m not sure :-)  I\'d say you were thinking of First
Class, but 1st class is on the upper deck.  I\'ve been in 747-300 and 400
models, so it might not be the same for all.  Most of th4e changes
involve stretching the fuselage, though, not changing the cross section.

As a side note, I found the post on the actual construction times for the
barge very infomative.

That was the beauty of CT.  It had simple core rules.  They added
expansions, like more indepth character generation, more indepth ship
construction (Book 5 High Guard), more indepth wargame combat (Striker) a
more indepth trading system (Merchant Prince Book 7) and a more indepth
system generation (Scouts Book 6).  Want more character types, Supplement 4
Citizens of the Imperium etc.

We had a KISS (Keep it Simple Silly) set of core rules and we could extense
as we needed to.  Though some future supplements like Supplement 9 Fighting
Ships published their ships with High Guard stats, you could still pull the
core information out with ease.

MegaTraveller attempted to merge CT with the supplements into an all
inclusive system and along with the errata, this is where it got into
trouble.  Suddenly the game was more complex (though some liked it that way)
and it just wasnt the same any more.  Then along came TNE.

The discontent with TNE isnt just with a few.  A whole mailing list exists
for those who don\'t like TNE to continue discussing the older Traveller
products and that list has almost as many subscribers as the main list and
in many cases most are duplicates.  Why?  TNE just didn\'t do it for many of
the older Traveller lovers.  There were some good enhancments, like FF&S
(though some would argue that point), but it still left a bad taste with
many of us old timers.  I bought about every TNE product out there and I ran
a TNE campaign, but it was never the same.

So I think (IMO) that the Traveller Public would like to see a set of simple
core rules, with addon enhancments (but don\'t include them in the same book
please).  Come out with smaller and more frequent supplements and adventures
(and more cost effective).  Detail more aliens.  The Alien "Modules" were
one of the greatest additions to the game, just as we looked forward to each
quarters JTAS for a new "Contact" chapter.  FF&S is great, but don\'t make me
have to use it.

It\'s an interesting thought experiement to create a possible
future for the Traveller universe.  I\'d like to throw out some of my
thoughts on the matter.

I think the first step would be to make a list of all the major events
and trends occuring in the 1200 timeframe and extrapolate from there.

Events and Trends, circa 1200:

- The Reformation Coalition is aggressively seeking technology
  and expanding their territory.

- Virus seems to be settling down (slightly), due to
  destructive strains eventually dying out.  Lack of spare
  parts are a likely problem for Virus as well.

- A friendly Virus strain has been encountered and relocated
  to somewhere within the Reformation Coalition.

- The Regency is looking to make an outward expansion.

- Something is causing the Zhodani to flee their territory
  and become refugees within the Regency.

- The Vargr have become minor player, mainly due to the
  devastating effects of Virus infection.

- The Hivers, of course, are busy trying to manipulate
  everyone they can (including themselves).

- Pockets of civilization exist through the wildlands, with
  each being unique.

Unknowns:

- We have no idea what is causing the Zhodani to leave their
  territory, but it is likely to be something related to
  psionics.

- The Aslan.  We are aware of clans within the Regency,
  but I don\'t recall any description of how badly the Aslan
  were affected by Virus.  A general assumption would be they
  suffered as much as the Imperium.

- The Solomani.  We can probably assume they suffered like the
  rest of Human civilization.

- The K\'Kree.  We have no idea whatsoever, so we can again
  assume the worst.


To me, it seems that the most influential trends are the Zhodani
exodus, Reformation Coalition expansionism and the general tendency
for Virus to either die off or evolve into something a bit more
tolerable.  A lesser influence is the advancing ``Threat From the
Core\'\' that is causing the Zhodani to leave their space.

Given these, I can see the following happening:

- Regency society and politics will be increasingly influenced
  by the influx of Zhodani.  Given enough time, the Regency
  will no doubt incorporate elements of the Zhodani culture
  into their everyday lives.  In fact, if there are enough
  refugees entering the Regency, the very fabric of the
  Regency will change into something different indeed.   No
  doubt there will be the hardliners that distrust the Zhodani
  regardless of their actions.

- The Zhodani as they exist in 1200 are likely to be changed
  dramatically as they deal with their core-originated menace.
  If, as I suspect, the threat is psionic based, then the way
  they order their society around their psionic prowess will
  almost certainly have to change.  They may very well enter
  into full relations with the Regency in order to seek aid in
  turning back this threat.  The Zhodani Consulate will
  continue to exist, but perhaps be a little less eager to
  explore the galactic core, possibly bringing them into
  competition with the Regency for space to grow into.

- The Reformation Coalition is likely to have an explosive
  growth period as their anti-Virus technology improves and
  they decide to try to utterly destroy all vestiges of Virus.
  Of course, there will be those that feel that the
  cooperative strains of Virus should be accepted.  Naturally,
  this be a source of some internal strife.

- Virus will have to adapt if it is to survive, but it is
  unlikely it will thrive.  The region around the old Imperial
  Capital and areas of Vargr space will probably remain a
  bastion for Virus for a long time, but the awareness and
  determination of the Regency and Reformation Coalition to
  stamp out Virus will make it difficult at best for Virus.

- There will likely be a handful of moderately powerful
  governments to arise within the old Imperial space.  None of
  these will be as powerful as the Regency or the Reformation
  Coalition, but will no doubt be a factor.

Of course, there are faily general observations and over the week I\'m
going to explore this further (I was looking for a campaign idea and
this looks like it).  If there is interest, I can post information as
I develop it.

Finally, Rob had made a statement on technology that I\'d like to
comment on.

Rob had said:

We have to be careful with this.  Sure, it would be neat to have ultra
advanced technology, but if care is not taken, Traveller would turn into
something more akin to Star Trek.  (Don\'t get me wrong, I like Star
Trek, but Traveller isn\'t Star Trek).  For instance, if transporters
became available, the entire ship\'s boat concept would have to be
rethought.

But, then again, we can\'t say that the Regency and Reformation
Coalition _won\'t_ be doing research, either.  In this regard, the
Regency may have the upper hand, although the Reformation Coalition
could work in conjunction with the Hivers and be catching up quickly.

I for one wouldn\'t want the technology base to change significantly,
although Rob\'s FTL hub could be interesting (Rob, why don\'t you
elaborate on that for us?).

One idea I\'ve been bouncing in my head for a while is something I\'ve
been calling the \'Jump Squared\' (JS) drive.  Essentially, it\'s an
improvement in the Jump Envelope that reduces the time required by
creating a purer environment.  Time required in J-space would be
reduced by 25-50% (A purer environment reduces the amount of J-space
friction encountered).  For a TL16-like environment, I wouldn\'t let JS
drives go any further than two or three parsecs, and perhaps be a
little touchy to use.

Later,

I don\'t think there\'s any reason not to include the rules in the basic
book.  Part 1-basic rules, Part 2-optional rules.  It\'s that simple.

As for FFS, you don\'t have to use it.  I think that GDW\'s problem was
that they didn\'t filter the information correctly.  Everything that
was there, can and should have been presented in a simpler format.

The question is do we make simple core rules in one book and optional
ones in another, or do we publish everything in one big book.
Honestly, just because you got slapped in the face with TNE doesn\'t
mean that you should wish the same upon me with the new system.

Fact is that the little black books are dead.  If today\'s market
doesn\'t want them.  They want books with some meat to them, with nice
art, and that are complete unto themselves.  Don\'t believe me?  Look
at some of the top-selling games.  Anything by Vampire, Werewolf,
Shadowrun.  The core books for these systems have all the rules you
need.  Granted, each system also has 101 supplements, each of which
adds about 5gigillion new gadgets/races/powers/etc, and maybe two or
three new effects to combat or gameplay.

So what?  Traveller shouldn\'t be like the other games.  Nice idea.
However, if Traveller is to survive, it\'s got to attract new players,
not just make all of us happy.

Give me another big single volume like the TNE rulebook--just organize
it better this time.

TRANSSTAR
History:Transstar was the largest and only Solomani Megacorporation. It was
a subsidiary of the Solomani party, and served as a source of income for the
 party.  Founded in 875, it was originally established as a means to
foster trade and commerce between worlds of the Solomani Confederation.
 Throughout most of its history it derived most of its profit from
interstellar trade, but it did branch out, primarily into finance and
insurance.
        After the Solomani Confederation conquered the Old Expanses during the
early parts of the Second War for Solomani Liberation, they sent in fleets to
administrate the territory, they also sent in Transstar to shape the economy
of the new territory. As it was owned by the Party, Transstar ships were also
used as Naval auxiliary ships, and were pressed into service carrying troops
and supplies. Transstar bought up and otherwise acquired dozens of
former Imperial Corporations.  The thought was that if you controlled a person\'s
livelihood, you controlled the person.  Also, why let profits go to Imperial
Corporations and Imperial sympathizers when the profits could go to the Party.
        By 1130 Transstar had established itself as an integral part of the
Old Expanses economy.  When the Virus hit the Old Expanses in 1130 it
wiped out most of Transstar along with the rest of Civilization.  Fija
weathered the Virus better than most worlds.  It lost technological
levels, but remained rather calm.  From a base on Fija Transstar
continued to operate throughout the Short Night. Transstar maintained
several starships during the Short Night.  The starport on Fija was
unable to repair jumpdrives, so after a decade Transstar was unable to
keep the ships jumpworthy.  They mothballed several but kept two in
service.  They were the 2000 ton Pride of Terra and the 400 ton Hokka.
 In 1177 the Hokka was exploring the outer Fijan system and suffered a
catastrophic drive failure and the entire crew slowly starved to death.
 The crew kept up a live video feed throughout the entire disaster.
Millions watched the tragedy on live trivid. After this Transstar kept
the Pride of Terra close to Fija.  Transstar took great pride in that
they had the largest function spacecraft on Fija, and they let people
know about it in their advertisements.  When the Hivers contacted Fija
in 1192, they sold Transstar parts to repair the Pride of Terra.  The
first mission of the revitalized Pride was the recovery of the Hokka.
Transstar broadcast the recovery and turned it into a public relations
bonanza.  When they returned to Fija, the dead crew-people of the Hokka
were given a heroes funeral.
        Transstar slowly began to restart interstellar trade between Fija
and the other members of the Dawn League. By 1201 they run ships between
all the worlds of the Reformation Coalition. They have about a dozen
relic ships, and have several new ones on order from the KeeEEka
Strongwall shipyard on Aubaine.  They are also pursuing negotiations
with several Free Traders to purchase their ships and to hire the crews
on as permanent employees.  The Pride of Terra is still the flagship of
the fleet, and was recently completely refitted at Dawn Construction\'s
Shipyard on Trybec.

Corporate Strategy: Transportation continues to be the number one
industry for Transstar, but they are diversifying. The leadership has
instituted a major expansion. They realize that best time to expand is
while the Coalition is still in its infancy, this way they can gain an
early lead, and be in a position to squish future competition. Their
insurance firm on Fija insures 30% of the Coalition civilian starships.
 They have a minority interest in KruyterCorp.  They recently bought
the leading manufacturer of machine tools on Baldur.  Recently they
launched a hostile takeover of Standard Astronics, the owner of the
shipyards on Aurora, which will soon be the second most important
shipyard in the Coalition. As only it and Aubaine will be able to
produce jump-2 vessels. The leadership wants Transstar to be a
Megacorporation once again.
       Transstar does not condone illegal operations by its executives, like
so many Imperial Megacorporations seemed to.  Its corporate environment was much
more used to being the Law, as it was part of the government.  Outside of the
of the Reformation Coalition, its respect for local law is a bit less, but still
rather high for a Megacorporatioin.
        Technically Transstar is still owned by the Solomani Party, but as
no one knows if it even exists anymore, Transstar operates independently, it
reinvests most of its profits, setting aside a small fraction in case
the Solomani Party makes a reappearance.  Since it does not have to pay
dividends to shareholders, it has a small advantage over traditionally
owned corporations.   It has been putting this advantage to good use,
buying up and forcing opponents out of business, when ever possible.
This has caused a bit of a public relations problem as Transstar moves
into small markets, displacing local business.  For the largest part
Transstar has dealt with this by offering lower prices and better
services.  It figures it can operate on a smaller profit margin in the
short run to insure long term profitability
        Transstar has a very good relationship with its employees.  Transstar
pays very well and has a excellent benefits package.  In its entire history
Transstar has never laid off an employee, even through the Hard Times, and the
Short Night.  Transstar will spare no effort to avenge or rescue employees that
are captured by terrorists, rebels or others. In exchange for these benefits,
Transstar demands excellence, and 110% effort.  Transstar also believes
in advanced training  for its employees, and pays for them to get
advanced college degrees.
         Transstar is a fervent supporter of the Reformation Coalition; you
can\'t have trade without civilization.  Transstar supports the
Centralist position, they would prefer to build up the Coalition,
rather than admitting dozens of low tech worlds that would drain
resources from the core worlds.  They do want new members, but at a
slower pace.  They would also rather expand rimward, towards Terra.
But the Federalists seem to want to go towards the Imperial Core.
Transstar donates money to Centralist politicians and offers them other
favors, such as free trips on Transstar shipping.
        There are persistent rumors that Transstar\'s leadership still subscribes
to the Solomani Cause, and that they give money to various right wing
groups such as the League of the Imperial Way.  The leadership denies
these, but the rumors still persist.

Corporate Structure:  The current incarnation of Transstar is headquartered on
Fija.  It has a large complex located in the capital.  The
Transportation Division and the Finance Division are located here.  The
Transportation Division has local headquarters on each world in the
Coalition, and on several worlds in the Wilds including Lancer/Aubaine,
Kal/Oriflamme and Teldora/Oriflamme. These
headquarters are charged with securing cargos for the ships, arranging
passengers and other business.
        The corporation is headed up by a President who is selected from
20 members of a Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors  select a President
by ballot.  New members to the Board are selected by current members of
the Board.  Members serve until they retire.  The membership is not
responsible to anyone but themselves.  The Board meets monthly on Fija.
 Board members travel
throughout the Coalition making deals and furthering the corporation.
        Transstar doesn\'t have a large security apparatus.  It has a few
security consultants, who design security systems for the various corporate
facilities.  It does employ security guards to protect factories and plants
that require protection.  It doesn\'t have a private army, or
intelligence service. If a need arises, Transstar often hires reliable
Freelancers.  It has enough contacts inside the RCES to know who is
reliable and who isn\'t.

Adventure Ideas:
Hostage: A member of the Board of Directors has been kidnaped by
Guild/terrorist or other criminal group.  They threaten to kill the
member if not paid a ransom.
Transstar needs a reliable group of Freelancers to rescue her.

Rescue: A Transstar ship exploring new trade opportunities in the Wilds
is overdue and presumed lost.  Transstar requires a Freelancer group to
find out why the ship dissapered, and if possible punish those
responsible.  It could be the  standard Virus/TED/Guild villain or the
ship may have simply broken down and needs the players to get spare
parts for it.  Or it may have misjumped and no trace of it will ever be found.

Investigation: A dedicated reporter believes that the Transstar Board
of Directors is providing funding for Human Supremist terrorists that
have been attacking Schalli.  She wants the players to help her break
into the corporate headquarters on Fija, find evidence supporting her
claim, and expose Transstar.

Terra or Bust: Transstar wants to know the fate of Sol, and is mounting
an expedition. Several Transstar executives are heading up the
expedition.  Transstar is sending several armed ships. Together they
stand a better chance of survival in the Wilds. They are hiring
Freelancers to act as scouts and security.  It is possible that someone
on board doesn\'t want the expedition to succeed, and will attempt to
sabotage the expedition.

Executive action: A member of the Board of Directors disagrees with current
corporate strategy, and wants to replace the current President with himself.
He is hiring disreputable characters to assassinate the President and several
other Directors.  The Directors are vacationing at an island resort on Aubaine.
The players could be the assassins or catch wind of the attempt and try to
stop it.

Annoying passenger: A member of the Board of Directors needs reliable
transportation to a nearby planet, to close a deal. The next Transstar
ship won\'t leave for another week, and that isn\'t soon enough.  The
Director would annoy the crew with his questions about everything.  But
if the crew deals with the Director politelyand they manage to impress
him/her they might walk away with an subcontract to carry freight for
Transstar, which could lead to all sorts of other adventures.

Corporate Rival: A rival corporation has been resisting Transstar attempts to
take over its territory. A new corporate executive dealt with this by hiring
thugs to kill the head of the rival corporation. This worked fairly well, in
fact so well that the local authorities investigated. The executive fled
the area, but the local media has gotten a hold of the story and
Transstar\'s name has been besmirched, the Board of Directors wants the
executive found and brought to justice. This will show that Transstar
doesn\'t support his actions.

I beg to differ.  I have the TNE book in hand.  I can find no section of
that book that allows me to build a space ship, or customize the one that I
have.  Plain and simple, you have to use FF&S to build a Starship with TNE
rules.

The think is that there are 500+ people on list, which is a small percentage
of the Traveller market, and every one has an opinion on what Marc should do.

I could not agree more.  I like cool art, stories in the side bars, or as
inserted frames are cool, but I want to start on page n, and go step by step
through the {character/ship/world/trade/npc/alien} generation.  One of the
cool things about MT was the fact that it had a Players Book, and a Refs
Book.  A ref could let the players read the Players book with no problems.
Players could pick that book up alone and it would help the GM out.

The problem with MT\'s players handbook was it didn\'t contain enough
information.  I think that the equipment and "players" library data should
have come in that one book as well as a description of the combat system.  I
think it helps new players and GM\'s out if everyone is familiar with the
system.  (Example: TNE has the skill descriptions in the Referee\'s section).

Ok......

Basically, here is my FTL hub idea.  Scientists at the University of
Rhylanor discovered a way to project wave-form energy into J-Space.  Like
physicsal matter that is sent into J-Space, these energy waves preciptiate
out at predictable times and locations.  However the times were signficantly
less than physical matter.  100 KPH speed limit on cars, 300,000 KPS speed
limit on energy waves, go figure.... :-)

The scientists found that unlike matter, where the duration in J-space was
somewhat constant, i.e. 5-7 days, that wave energy had a duration of 3-5
days.  Thus the the Xboat could deliver data in 6 days, with the FTL system,
data could be delivered in 4 days, which is a significant increase.

There is however a trade off.  The cost of the FTL communication system is
very expensive, and the energy required is nearly double that of an Xboat
traveling the same distance.  However, the Regency feels that the speed
increase is worth it and has invested in a series of FTL hub networks that
based on J5 and J6 routes to connect major worlds in the Regency, and
letting the Xboat network, and regular mail carriers distribute out from the
hubs.  Thus a message from Jewell to Rhylanor has an average duration of 20
days, as compaired to the Xboat time of around 80 days via Xboat routes.

Communications along the FTL Net cost about 100 times that of Xboat rates,
and can only be used for electronic transfers.  Existing Xboat network hubs
have been retrofitted to also be FTL Receiver/Transmitter Units in key
locations along the FTL net.  New FTL only sites have been constructed in
key areas to allow J5 and J6 routes available.  The network is highly
regulated, with Regency business, intersteller banking, and military traffic
having the priority on the network.  Educational, Business, and Personal
traffic can be sent, but at a lower priority and may see an extra day per
hop delay because of the lower priority.

Jewell, Regina, Aramis, Lanth, and Rhylanor Sectors are currently served by
the FTL hub. Expansion to Lunion, Mora, and Glisten are planed as well as
expansion into the Deneb sector.  The Darrian goverment announced that its
scientists are close to completing a similar FTL net, but is slightly
incompatable.  A gateway is being designed to route traffic between the two
networks once the Darrian net is implemented though delays, lost packets,
and finger pointing will occasionally occur.  (Sorry couldn\'t resist that one).

What do you think?

A persual of the Regency Sourcebook discusses the frontier being
reopened, but not a general ``outward expansion\'\'.  (Although that is
a possible effect, I suppose).

I had also said:

I underestimated the effect the Empress Wave (``Threat from the
Core\'\', as I put it) was having on the Zhodani and could possibly have
on the Regency (and possibly the Reformation Coalition?).

It appears the Regency is in for quite a ride starting at 1205.

Finally, I stated:

> - The Zhodani as they exist in 1200 are likely to be changed
>   dramatically as they deal with their core-originated menace.

After re-reading portions of the Regency Sourcebook, I think that
``Changed Dramatically\'\' would be a bit of an understatement.  If
there is as much in-fighting as they describe, there may not be much
left.

Perhaps after the effects of the Empress Wave are dealt with, the
Regency would begin a slow expansion spinward into Zhodani space.

No, you have to use FFS to build an "official" TNE ship.  There are so

Now if your argument is that there should be rules to build ships (as

Hmm.  I can see where you\'re coming from as far as the separate books
are concerned.  However, having played Star Wars, I have to admit I
much prefer it when everyone has the same base rulebook.  Have a
player\'s section and a referee\'s section.  I think that cursory
Library Data that is open to all should be included in this, but the
hardcore, nitty-gritty, stuff should be saved for the supplements.  I
found the layout of the RSB (tiny-type withstanding) to be superb in
this respect.

Speaking of which, I also have to say that I loved the layout of the
RCVG as well.  Why?  Well, it wasn\'t 101 Vehicles.  It didn\'t just
give you the stats and a picture, it took you through the vehicles.  I
haven\'t seen a product this good (from a techie-side) since the
Starship Operator\'s Manual (and yes, I\'m talking about all the RPG\'s
that I play or like).

Time for a cheap shot here.  Rob, I just wanted to thank you for
taking the time to respond to me in a rational, intelligent, and
comprehensive manner.  I find that I enjoy bouncing these ideas around

I like it!  It\'s interesting.  I did something very similar.  Well not
too much so.

I had the Jumpspace Institute make a breakthrough and create Jump
Gates.  Yes, I felt like using the stargate rules from FFS.  However,
I postulated they found that by setting up permanent jump structures,
they could achieve distances like j-12 to j-15.  Of course the great
trade off is that this is very, very expensive, and your destination
is always the same place.  However, it does unify things a bit more.
And yes, since they\'re jump gates, it still takes a week to travel
through them.  I felt that this lessened their impact, since you still
have a one week lag.  Mostly they\'re used to try to bridge the ends of
the Regency together and also to set up CP and outposts in the Wilds
without making it very tough to cross the Great Rift.

I know that this isn\'t really your opinion, but that which you\'ve
gathered from postings from people who dislike TNE, so don\'t
take this personally, but I had to comment on the assertion that
I have seen several times about TNE being too combat
oriented.  In some aspects I would agree that this is the case,
but not, as I am sure I have seen others say, in the character
generation process.

I am pretty ambivalent over the great debate as I can see good
and bad things in both CT and TNE (sorry, can\'t comment on MT).
One of the bad things about CT, which is a good thing about TNE
is CT\'s  overemphasis on military careers.  I really like the fact
that in TNE there are many non-military careers, all presented
with equal weighting to the military ones.  In CT it always felt like
a non-military career such as Belter was an afterthought, tacked
on to the game in a supplement.  I think that the TNE approach
is much better.  I was surprised when I first bought it to see that
the old expanded system which described what you did in each
year of each term was gone, but when I actually started using
the system I found that I really didn\'t care.  If I want an in-depth
background for my character, particularly one which actually
fits into the background I am using, well I\'ll use my imagination
and make one up.  I find this to be of much more use than
trying to shoehorn a prearranged series of strikes and
counter-insurgency actions into the background of my
character.

Well, what\'s overlooked is that the space between star systems is *not*
empty. You\'ve got everything from proto-comets to "rogue" planets. And
even an *average* sized cometary body will make a great way station, as
it\'ll be a several km spheroid of "ice" and rock. It\'ll have *lots* of
hydrogen, and a fair amount of other useful elements. Carbon, Nitrogen,
Oxygen, maybe some rock and iron...

It\'d be nice if someone could dig up the current astronomical estimates
of size and distance distribution of such bodies and turn them into
some rough rules.

But in any case, I\'d imagine the method for setting up a way station
would be to jump into "empty" space in a ship that has enough fuel to
jump back, *plus* a *lot* of manuever fuel, and some long term
life-support consumables.

Better yet, use a *pair* of ships, trying to jump in a few hundred AU
apart.

Then you just deploy a one meter Schmidt camera or similar
astrophotographic rig, and start taking pictures of the full 360 degree
sphere. Then, you either wait a week or more and take another set, or
exchange info with the other ship.

Comparing the images will show that some objects are in different
positions. The size of the shift will give you the distance based on
either the distance between the ships, or the movement of the single
ship. Then it\'s just a matter of picking a "likely" target and either
sending out some automated probes, or checking it out with the ship.

I\'d recommend using probes, as you can have something that\'ll get there
in a reasonable amount of time (say a month :-) and thus let you check
them out without moving the ship. Then you move the ship over to the
best candidate.

If it checks out, you unload the contruction gear. First order of
business is a fuel refinery, a power plant, and life support. Then,
having the place made *livable*, you start on the communications setup
and navigational sensors and beacons.

Once you\'ve got a way to relocate the place, you can jump back (if you
were using two ships, you\'ve *already* sent one ship back). You leave a
crew onboard the station, and jump. They\'ll work on expanding it, and
stockpiling hydrogen, water, etc.

The ship reports the location and either it loads up on more
construction supplies and equipment, or an "engineering" ship is sent
out.

Either way, you\'ll have a base in a reasonable amount of time, with a
not *too* huge investment.Heck, it\'s even within reach of player
characters who have a ship capable of making two jumps without
refueling.

Not only are such way stations useful to traders, they provide a nice
place for a base which might be almost impossible to find.

Some interesting scenarios are possible.

1. finding old records of a way station that got "lost" during a war or
   the Long Night. Odds are that if it can be relocated, it\'d be
   repairable without too big an investment. It could be anything from
   merely a fueling base with life support for crew and transients up
   to a full fledged starport with dockyards and shipbuilding
   facilities!

2. misjumping and trying to find an icy body before lifesupport fails.

3. Pirates using an old way station as a base.

4. (TNE only) A virus running a waystation. If it\'s a full fledged
   naval base, things get *really* ugly unless it\'s "friendly".

5. Finding an "abandoned" way station (either by misjump or from old
   records) only to find that it is inhabited by descendants of the
   original crew. Say during a war, the records of the base could be
   lost, but if the station had limited ship repair facilities, they
   could keep their own machinery going, and hunt for more comets to
   get more materials. You could have quite a population after a few
   centuries.

6. A survey mission looking for a cometary body to build a station on
   finds something odd on the photos. Something too *big* (a rogue
   planet?) or something moving too fast (a generation ship? A
   "sleeper" ship? A near-light speed probe or ship?)


Also, the Scout service would be using similar techniques to locate
stars beyond the boundaries of the Imperium. With a 1 parsec baseline,
you can accurately locate stars a *long* ways off. Probably thousands
of parsecs.

For folks running in an era where there are still unexplored frontiers,
or in their own background, this allows the players to have maps of
star location and type, plus some info regarding *possible* planets,
but not have enough to kill the thrill of exploration.

I can see how this would be the case since there are fewer
high-value, low-bulk cargoes to be carried between low tech worlds.
However, I could also see that Transstar would have an interest in
developing business opportunities in the Wilds.  This is where the
players would come in.  An Office of Business Development attached to
Corporate HQ could serve a function similar to the RCES Long-Range
Planning people.  The difference would be that instead of doing silly
things like SAGs to recover relic weapons the OBD of Transstar would be
after truly valuable things, like hi-tech machine tools.  Also, in view
of their law-abiding approach, Transstar would approach things much more
subtly so as not to sour future business in the Wilds.
Lets say that Transstar has recently acquired a small company
which has been prospecting on one of the RC boneyard worlds.  The
opportunities on this planet were beginning to tap out, so they got the
company cheap.  The OBD wants to turn their talents to prospecting in the
Wilds and wants the players to serve as intelligence gathering and
security for these operations.  Adventures would include hunting down
rumors and following leads to promising caches, establishing premliminary
negotiations with local rulers to get access to those caches, and
providing security to the recovery team as they carefully remove the
relic equipment.  You could make it even more rewarding for the players
by having Transstar use each piece of relic equipment to produce a few
goodies for them (better ships sensors, more compact batteries for their
gauss rifles, etc.) so that they can see the results of their efforts.
Heres a good one:  The characters have spent several gaming
sessions tracking down a load of TL15 heavy industrial goods for making
electronic equipment.  They discover that the ship the goods were on
landed on this planet but never took off.  Further investigation shows
that the tools were traded for desperately needed repairs.  Some were
later destroyed but they have reason to believe that the merchant who
bought them saved some and took them out of the city to mothball them in
the hinterlands before Virus hit the planet.  The cany players track down
the goods but cant remove them with out a lot of fuss because theyre too
delicate and need to be carefully disassembled and prepared for transport.
They negotiate a deal with the local TED to swap the TL15 tools which are
too advanced for him to make use of anyway for some lower tech tools from
Transstars Balduri machine tool affiliate and extensive technical
assistance.  The recovery team brings in their special fat trader and all
their gear and is half way through the recovery when the RC decides to
pull a particularly bloody SAG raid on the planet.  Complications with the
local TED ensue. :-) Not only is this a much less military type of
adventure for everyone sick of those, but it should give the players a
much different perspective on the drawbacks to going in guns blazing like
the RC does so often.

CORPORATE RIVALS
This is one thing misssing from the Transstar piece.  Outside
the RC there\'s plenty of room for conflict with the Guild or with Free
Traders who feel like Transstar is taking away their business.  On the
other hand, Transstar could ally itself with the Traders and give them
financial and technical backing against the Guild.
Inside the RC you could have corporations from other worlds or
technarchs from Oriflamme who are competing against Transstar.  I\'ll
leave this for some other time, this post is long enough :-)

Once again, great job and great idea!

Actually I never played SO, but lurked over some of the discussion about it in
recent TMLs.  I understand your beef about putting TL into real-world terms and
the problems that result.  See my reference to the CT computer "programs" that
were a reflection of early 80s DOS-based home computers.  But unfortunately, the
real world is the best anchoring point we have.

Not all of us have done the research or read every issue of Scientific American
and Omni for the past decade, so we don\'t know what might exist in the future.
Though it ain\'t perfect, the TL system does the job.  My players know when they
go from a TL-12 world to a TL-15 world that the differences extend beyond just
security troops carrying gauss rifles vs. fusion guns.  The TL system has
successfully established a certain feel to the Traveller universe.  Subtle
differences can be employed advances.

For instance, I just completed a Regency campaign merc adventure in which the
players were hired to guard Mora\'s gravball team for the duration of the Regency
Cup competition, held on TL-16 Vincennes.  I indicated that the playing field,
which is a tough plexi-glass type capsule about the size of a hockey rink, was
more advanced on Mora and Vincennes than it was on say, Rhylanor or Efate.  The
capsule didn\'t require bonded superdense struts to support it but was instead
supported gravitically by manipulator technology, available at TL-16.  There are
differences all along the way from TL-8 to -16 that provide a good framework.

As an exercise (and to go with some starship designs I\'m working on) I
tried to design TL 9- (TL 9 without contragrav) ground-to-orbit shuttles.
It mostly worked, without breaking the FFS rules more than slightly.
The only major difference in fact was that I used the real delta-V
formula rather than the simplified FFS one
(see http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/thrusters.html, especially the
article from cyhiggin@usa.pipeline.com, though her transfer orbit
formula looks wrong to me.) I did use FFS engines (see below.)
Ways in which the design changes with alternative rules, or CG, are also
discussed at the end.

TL-8 versions of these designs would look almost identical; if anyone is
really interested in the subtle differences I can post them.

The one major difference to published TNE rules is of course the delta-V
to orbit. The TNE rule-book number-of-G-hours to orbit, as has been noted,
are completely wrong. Delta V from earth\'s surface to a 150km orbit
is 8.00 km/s. (Not 0.64 G-hours, which is 22.5 km/s.) Getting back
from orbit requires much less delta-V, too; all you have to do is
change your orbit so it scrapes the atmosphere more, and then aerobrake
(like the Space Shuttle does.) This raises total delta-V to 8.04 km/s.
If you start near the equator delta-V goes down; 7.64 km/s is the figure
I used, appropriate for a 30-degree inclination takeoff.
For a size 9 world of normal density delta-V is 8.52 km/s, for a size 7, 6.72
km/s.

These are delta-V in a vacuum and assuming very high instantaneous
acceleration. Real atmosphere and gravity complicate this somewhat.
FFS talks about non-CG spacecraft using 1-g of their thrust to negate
gravity until they reach orbit, which is spectacularly nonsensical, even by GDW
standards. *Anything* that\'s moving is in an orbit; a thrown baseball is
in an orbit - just a *very* long and skinny elliptical orbit that
happens to intersect the Earth\'s surface. The trick for a rocket is to
make sure your orbit never actually reaches the ground. For finite
accelerations this means some amount of delta-V is spent going upwards as the
spacecraft lifts off, which is less efficient than a pure Hohmann
transfer orbit. In addition, you lose delta-V due to atmospheric friction.
Together these add about 1.5 km/s to the delta-V requirements for a classical
rocket, and require that the takeoff acceleration be significantly higher
than 1G.

The shuttle designs below are horizontal-takeoff designs which use their
airbreathing AZHRAE engines for takeoff and to climb to high altitudes
(and, in the case of the first design, for some extra delta-V.) This is similar
to the (now-cancelled) X-30 Aerospace Plane. This approach has been pretty
much abandoned in the real world, but FFS makes it easier to design than
most other single-stage-to-orbit designs (see below.) It also means that
the acceleration required of the engine is only 1G (or even less.) I\'ve
allowed 0.6 km/s delta-V for remaining atmosphere drag (8.1 km/s round trip
to 150-km orbit from 30 degrees latitude), which is typical for the Pegasus
air-launched rocket. There\'s a huge range of operational parameter space for
these vehicles depending on the atmosphere, density and diameter of the world
they\'re operating on; I\'ve designed for an Earthlike world.

Terminology for those who don\'t have FFS: AZHRAE is the acronym
for a combination turbojet/ramjet/rocket engine. HRF is hydrogen
rocket fuel. HCD is hydrocarbon distillates (petrochemical fuels.)
EAPlaC is the incredibly efficient solid-rocket-like TL-9 engine in FFS,
normally used in missiles.

Notes/operating mode:
  The shuttle takes off and lands like an aircraft. It uses 4 minutes of
turbojet fuel to take off and climb, then fires the ramjets for 2.2
minutes, accelerating to 0.64 km/s and punching through most of the
atmosphere, then firing the rockets for the rest of the trip to orbit.
It de-orbits with a brief rocket burn (0.05 km/s), aerobrakes like the
shuttle, glides most of the way to its landing sight, then activates
the turbojets for the last part of the landing. Enough turbojet fuel
is available for four minutes of full thrust at landing, but since it
weighs much less while landing and doesn\'t need to run the engines at
full thrust it can run for more than half an hour at 350km/h during
landing, a comfortable safety margin.

  Operating costs are dominated by fuel (HRF costs Cr 1000
per m3.) Cost to orbit for commercial service would therefore be around
Cr 10,000 per tonne of cargo and 2,000 per passenger (possibly somewhat
less if there is enough traffic that shuttles always fly full both to
and from orbit.) Compare to the EAPlaC disposable discussed below -
shuttles would probably only be used for people and fragile/urgent cargoes.

Notes:
This version is designed for field operations on unexplored worlds.
It\'s VTOL-capable (Using the VTOL aircraft rules, this adds 10% to the hull
material volume, and requires a minimum acceleration of 0.5G, which the
turbojets satisfy.)
The AZHRAE engine burns hydrogen in its airbreathing modes rather than
hydrocarbons. Since hydrogen is so bulky, it\'s no longer efficient to use
the AZHRAE engine for any delta-V beyond that needed for takeoff and landing,
but this makes the shuttle completely field-refuellable.

The shuttle normally starts in orbit, carried by a starship. It de-orbits
(0.05 km/s delta-V) and aerobrakes, then glides towards a carefully pre-
selected landing site. It activates the turbojets for 5 minutes at
0.1 G (350 km/h) to find the landing site, then 3 minutes of hovering at
0.5 G for landing. Vertical takeoff uses another 2 minutes of 0.5 G, then 5.5
minutes of full thrust are left to climb to altitude before firing the rockets.

For field refueling the shuttle would carry down a fission reactor
(60 tons) and then a fuel refining plant, modified to refine both
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, and several fuel storage tanks.
Using some of its HRF tanks, and the cargo hold, for  plain liquid hydrogen
the shuttle can carry 295 m^3 to a 150-km orbit.

Operating purely as an aircraft (with the HRF tanks full of hydrogen
for the turbojet) it has an endurance of about one hour, plus a margin for
vertical takeoff and landing.

Since it only has one electronics operator, it can only operate a total of
two sensors or communicators at any time.


Notes:

FFS engines have low thrust-to-weight but also lower fuel consumption than
the Real World. This is actually an advantage for craft like this one which
have quite low accelerations. Using more realistic engines (see the URL
above) bites heavily into the payload; designs are available if anyone is
really interested.

One can argue that craft that aerobrake should have higher armor values
than normal craft, but one can also argue that AV=1 and especially the
internal structure is far heavier than real world craft needed, so I\'ve
just left it at AV=1.


EAPlaC:

   These designs don\'t use EAPlaC for a variety of reasons:
(1) I started with the exploration shuttle, which needed to be completely
field-refuellable.
(2) I wanted them to be basically practical at TL-8
(3) I wanted the commercial shuttle to emphasize rapid turnaround, thinking
that this would decrease operations costs. (I was wrong.)
(4) Even though the rules implicitly assume EAPlaC rockets can be turned off
and re-ignited (unlike solid rockets in the real world), they\'re still a
type of solid, and no-one in their right mind uses solid rockets on a
manned vehicle. (The NASA Space Shuttle is a case in point.)
(5) EAPlaC is poorly-explained magic, not extrapolated technology.

   However, EAPlaC has an *incredible* ISP. It\'s very tempting. If the safety
considerations don\'t apply, TL-9 shuttles would probably at least use
expendable strap-on EAPlaC boosters. A shuttle that gets part of its delta-V
4 ton (28 m^3) strap-on EAPlaC boosters can carry 390 tonnes into orbit at a
fuel cost of MCr 1; commercial shipping charges would be about Cr 2500 per
tonne.

   Additionally, pure EAPlaC unmanned rockets would almost certainly dominate
the bulk cargo market, where safety is irrelevant. A 100-ton unmanned
disposable EAPlaC cargo carrier can carry 1280 tonnes into orbit, and costs
MCr 0.42! It\'s so cheap - dominated by fuel costs - that it\'s not even worth
reusing. Commercial cost to orbit would be about Cr 500 per tonne.




The Real World:

   In the real world, SSTO\'s are unlikely to look like this. Partially this
is because we don\'t know how to make an AZHRAE engine, and partially it\'s
because of various details like landing gear that FFS doesn\'t model.
Without AZHRAE engines horizontal takeoff has no advantages and in fact
is a net disadvantage, because you have to design the wings and landing
gear to lift the whole loaded weight of the spacecraft, not the empty weight.

   Current SSTO paper designs are either VTHL (vertical-takeoff/horizontal
landing) rocket takeoff/glide-landers, kind of like the Space Shuttle with no
external  tank or boosters, or VTVL (vertical-takeoff/vertical landing) craft
which look a lot like 1950s science fiction and hover/land using thrust from
rocket engines (the DC-X and proposed follow-ons.) See sci.space.policy
and s.s.tech for perpetual debates as to which approach is better.
Neither works well with FFS engines. Also, a VTVL doesn\'t work very well
for a shuttle that starts in orbit - it has to land/hover while carrying
all the (heavy) fuel it needs to get back into orbit. Realistic rather than
FFS engines are better for these high thrust-to-weight designs, but they\'re
still very hard to do (I suspect because the interior structure mass in FFS is
too high for small craft.)


Contra-Grav:

   At classic TL-9 (contra grav, fusion rockets, but no HEPlaR), altitude is
free but delta-V is expensive. My guess is that easiest orbits to reach (in
delta-V terms) are highly elliptical, with apogee of thousands of km and
nearly skimming the planet (150km) at perigee. A CG shuttle would climb out to
meet a starship at apogee, where it\'s moving very slowly. There\'s a tradeoff
in apogee height, though, as the shuttle has to spend more delta-V to
reach this distance in a reasonable time. For an Earthlike world, limiting
total travel time to three hours, the optimum orbit has a 18000km
apogee; delta-V to reach this orbit with contra-grav is 4.28 km/s.
The shuttle turns on its CG, leaves the atmosphere at a few hundred km/h,
accelerates a little more to 1.7 km/s, coasts for 3 hours with the CG on
to an altitude of 18000km, then kills it\'s outward velocity and
accelerates to 2.6km/s, which puts it in a 18000km/150km orbit.
(There may be more exotic trajectories with lower delta-V, but they\'d be
much harder to calculate.)

   I can post the full CG version of the shuttles if anyone is interested.
The commercial model costs MCr 19.97, has an acceleration of 0.5 G, and can
get 170 tonnes of cargo to this elliptical orbit. Cost to orbit would be
about Cr 6000 per tonne. EAPlaC versions have so much delta-V that they can
go to any orbit they like, with costs in the 500 per tonne range.
Still, TL-9 starport owners are probably best off investing in an imported
TL-10 HEPlaR shuttle.

Leigh, I suggest you read your incoming mail a little more carefully. Nobody
was complaining about cyberware, genetic engineering etc. If fact it was
said there should be more of it in Traveller. What was being complained
about was the Cyberpunk game itself and overflow of cyberpunk style BS into
the Traveller environment. The last thing we want to see in Traveller is the
"chrome and gloss" that is painted all over the Cyberpunk game like a \'80s
hangover.

    'body' => 'The discussion of MT/CT rules vs. TNE rules seems to have been going in
circles, and we are not going to reach agreement. I have all three rule sets in
some form or other, and I think it would be difficult to decide which rule set
is best. MT combat seems faster, but TNE\'s initiative rounds are a lot easier
to handle than interrupts in MT. Likewise task systems are both very good, and
yet very different. Still, in my opinion, neither is anywhere near perfect, and
as long as whatever Marc Miller produces is better than any rules set produced
to date, I\'ll buy it. A superb rules set could be produced from the evolution
of MT or TNE, or dare I say it, a compromise (dirty word on this list of late)
between the two?

As for the timeline, I\'m at a loss as to why the CT/MT camp want to discard the
TNE background. They say they want the Rebellion to end, and then Hard Times to
pass without the release of virus, but then the Imperium will return to what?
Basically Classic Traveller again, so if that is the game they want to play,
why can\'t they just play it in the CT part of the timeline, and leave the
future for people who want to do more than just return to the status quo. The
coherent background is an important part of the game, and while GDW may have
issued revisions in the past, discarding all the material published for TNE
would be a great waste. Given the importance of background however, I did feel
that TNE was lacking in conveying this history, and I hope future editions
include an Imperial Encyclopaedia section to demostrate the richness of the
setting to newcomers.

The virus may have caused all sorts of reality checks in the game, but it did
solve the problem of avoiding needing to choose a winner for the final war.
Hard Times may have appeared to signal an end to hostilities, but considering
the sizes of the \'safe\' areas even late into Hard Times, the major powers would
have had little trouble resuming Black War scale hostilities within a decade.
When this happened, as it inevitably would, given the stubbornness of the
factions involved, the wilds and frontiers would be slowly pounded into dust
far faster and far more completely than by virus. With hindsight there are many
more elegant solutions than Virus, but it worked, and it has no effect on you
if you play in the past, as much effect as you want on the present, and who
knows what will happen in the future. The fact remains that if you don\'t want
to deal with virus, then you can relegate it to history, even in TNE (Sandman
is virus-proof given the strength of peacemaker systems, and sandman should be
able to clear out virus infections fairly easily)

There has been discussion of taking the timeline 300, or even 800 years further
into the future, and I think there is some validity in wanting to do this, but
at the same time, I think it would be premature. There are still several very
major questions which need to be resolved in the TNE present before we can even
guess at the shape of the future -

1/The fate of Virus - Wipe out almost all of the malicious virus sure, but
please leave Sandman and similar strains, which I think bring some much needed
life into the Traveller computers - \'Yes, you too can have an AI computer at
TL12\'
2/The Empress Wave - This is too big a plot hook to leave unresolved, see the
comments on \'secret enemy\' backgrounds below.
3/RC/Regency relations - Not another war, but maybe skirmishes in the wilds
until they join forces against a threat from...
4/Behind the Black curtain.

I feel that a good future background for Traveller would be a \'secret enemy\'
plot, ala Babylon 5. This allows small actions, such as those of the players,
to have profound implications (eg understanding the conspiracy/threat, only
you can save the world), but at the same time minimal physical effects
(information gathering is more important than open war, you avert the
disaster before the general population realises what\'s happening, and the
conspirators cover their tracks). This would mean that the plot could be
ignored by referees who don\'t like it, but that it is always there to help
provide adventures if needed. In fact, ignoring this aspect of the
background, what remains would be a setting very close to classic
traveller, which would help please everyone. Also, this background tends to
lend itself to more interesting adventures than straight shoot-outs, with more
investigation, character interaction, plot and all those other things which
people complain are missing in The New Era (although I can\'t see it myself).
These are just personal opinions so no flames please (my asbestos suit is at
the dry-cleaner\'s)

>From my perspective on the game, I have two concerns with the new game
picking up where Virus left off.  First, it took a Sci-Fi game and made it
post-apocolyptic game out of it.  We may as well play TW2K, Aftermath, or
GammaWorld instead.  The point is the adventuring area was not Traveller
anymore and that is what upset a bunch of us.  Secondly we were dropped into
a region of
space that we were unfamiliar with.  Sure they left us with the Regency as
an alternate setting, but RC was definatly the thrust of the game.  Again,
it wasn\'t Traveller any more.

Most all of the previously released material, most of the events that shaped
the game from the onset through MT was based in the Spinward Marches.  Now
maybe GDW decided that that area of space had been over developed and they
were looking for a fresh start.

The next issue is this Star Trek "canon" term.  I like to run a reasonablly
canon game.  That way, I can utilize the TNS entries, the mini-adventures from
the magazines and other such normalities, while also contributing my own
ideas and adventures.

Today, I can still adventure in the CT or MT settings, I just wont be
getting anything new.  I can also adventure in the TNE setting.  But in the
end Traveller is Traveller.  Leave the post-apocolytpic setting in the
history for
those who want to adventure there (on a side note, how many people have gone
back and run a "Long Night" campaign?) but for us who don\'t like Virus, give
us a time of high adventure.

In my ideal advancement, systems are virus proof, but fringe areas are still
subjected to it.  There is also no reason why there can\'t be an new alien
race spring from this (thoughts of the Cylons or the Borg come to light),
they could be hostile or not, but this might be something to come from
behind the black curtain.

I dont know how many years it should take to get though the second long
night, but put together a fourth imperium, and have another grand survey done.

a heavy emphasis on on Computer related ideas. Refereeing a Traveller
campaign in High School got me into Computers 20 years ago and there\'s
still a lot of potential to be explored there.

   o Clarification of the legal issues around distribution of
     software that I create. Specifically, if I write a program that
     generates traveller subsectors/characters/etc can I put it on an
     ftp site for all traveller players to use. I realize that the
     creation of some software would de-value the Copyrights on
     Traveller especially if such programs were distributed as source
     code but we should be able to reach some consensus with MM/LW

     Comments?

   o After the clarification - release of a public domain program in
     source code to generate systems, subsectors, sectors. The program
     would generate this data in a common flat file layout so anyone
     could then plug the data into whatever database they wanted to
     use.

   o A program to generate NPCs from the CT book 1 "Characters and
     Combat" or Supplement 4 "Citizens of the Imperium" tables. Same
     as above on the layout, flat file ascii so you can plug it into
     Paradox, Access, Oracle, Lotus or foobarbazDb.

   o A program to generate NPCs from the CT books 4, 5, and 6 systems
     or the MT Detailed tables. Same layout rules as above.

   o A body of Public domain traveller Reference material available
     via lookup on the Web or on CD-ROM with a suitable lookup
     program. If this was appropriately hyperlinked it could be a
     great source book of adventure creating material. Some sort of
     access control would be needed so the referee could get more
     information than the players but that could be accomplished in
     the browser. The information presented here in the RICE papers is
     exactly what I\'m talking about but with an index over the top of
     it so I can find it on my laptop.


The first two are simple as a matter of fact I wrote both of
these while running a campaign at Lehigh University in 1983. But
the source is lost to me because back then it wasn\'t as easy as
it is now to bang ascii files from platform to platform. (If
anyone from that campaign is reading this list I\'d love to hear
from you).

The third is considerably more difficult but I\'ve sketched out a
design for such a program in my head. It would be a matter of
putting the design on paper or whiteboard and then implementing
it.

    'body' => ' At the Illuminati Online FTP site, there is a set of guidelines for running
a GURPS Space campaign using the TRAVELLER universe. These rules are mainly
oriented towards the Classic Traveller/MegaTraveller style of background.
They have some neat things, like new Advantages, skills, weapons stats for
Traveller weapons in GURPS, even alien race stats for Aslan, Vargr, Hiver and
Droyne. One thing it does not include is detailed ship construction rules,
although there are notes. I have put together the following information for
those interested in possibly using the GURPS system to run TRAVELLER.

TRAVELLER JUMP DRIVES work differently from those in the GURPS SPACE rulebook.
Figuring the size of the drive is the same as for regular Traveller; take the
Jump number, add one, and this is the percentage of the ship\'s volume taken up
by the jump drive. (NOTE: GURPS SPACE rates ships in cubic yards of volume. A
TRAVELLER displacement ton is 18 cubic yards.) The drives mass 30 tons per 18
cubic yards, and cost 3Mcr per 18 cubic yards. The fuel requirements are also
the same; 5x the volume of the drive, with the fuel weighing one ton for every
14 cubic yards.

TRAVELLER MANEUVER DRIVES use the TL11 Reactionless Thrusters, as given in
GURPS Space. (The ones in GURPS Vehicles will also work.)

TRAVELLER POWER PLANTS differ significantly from the Fusion reactors listed in
GURPS Space. My solution is to use the stats as listed, and impose a fuel
requirement of 0.2cy per MW output of the plant per year.(This could be
shortened to 30 days if you want to make the characters worry about fuel more.)

TRAVELLER SHIP HULLS are best simulated by using the most expensive version
found in GURPS Space for TL 11. If using GURPS Vehicles, they would be
considered Advanced Heavy materials. In SPACE, civilian ships would have a
DF of 0. Military ships would, of course, be higher; one system I\'ve seen
says +1DF for every 3% of the ship devoted to armor. This is a sort of \'by feel
thing.

  The article was written by a gentleman named David P. Summers. Perhaps those
of you with TRAVELLER web pages might contact io.com and see about getting
permission to distribute this to the TML, if this hasn\'t already been done
at some point.

  I\'m also interested in extrapolating GURPS values for HEPLar drives, so they
could be used for a GURPS TNE game.

  Maybe this will give us something to talk about instead of this tiresome
"old TRAV/newTRAV" discussion.

    'body' => '     Fellow Travellers
     I have always felt that the gas giant refuelling is a little too pat.
     Evidence: Ship enters system. "Well, gollee Captain! There\'s the gas giant.
     Let\'s scoop up that there free fuel!" Twelve hours later, the ship is
     sloshing out of orbit with a full tank of fuel that would cost them tens of
     thousands of creds at the starport...

     Has anybody thought of making this process a bit more
     realistic/interesting/plot related? Why the hell does anybody bother
     selling unrefined fuel? (BTW, that was a rhetorical question. I don\'t
     really want an answer to that question - PLEASE!)

     Here are some of the notes I took when I saw a program on Jupiter last
     night:

     Gas Giant refuelling would be a dramatic process. The atmosphere would
     shade from dark through sky blue to grubby brown colouring the deeper you
     go, becoming pitch black at greater depths. You would have a subjective
     sensation of your date hanging out above the biggest damn cookpot in the
     universe; huge storms would be screaming past below you as you descend.
     Phenomenal lightning storms would fill the radio spectrum with white noise
     - bad news for comms and radar. Ever wonder how those SDBs stay hidden in a
     gas giant?

     GG refuelling would be pretty damn dangerous too. If you wanted a nice safe
     refuelling (eg merchants, warships on routine missions), you would:
     a) Seek out clear, storm free areas on the GG (I imagine this would be an
     interesting task on Jupiter; and will the area stay storm free for long?)
     b) Make a number of slow skims at high altitude to minimise the effects of
     atmospheric turbulence

     If you wanted to refuel FAST (warship entering hostile system, suspected
     enemy SDBs in the GG, merchant being chased by corsairs...) you would:
     a) Hook into a stormy area so the gas hits the ramscoops at high speed
     b) make a single, fast, deep entry to try to get it all in as few passes as
     possible
     c) Hang onto dem luckydice and say plenty of prayers to whatever deity
     oversees complete idiots.

     All this seems to justify why many people would want to buy unrefined fuel
     from a starport; it would also justify why the gas giant \'Wildcatters\'
     could expect to be paid for the stuff. Running costs, insurance, doctors\'
     bills ("Sorry, you say were struck by a bolt of lightning the size of the
     Earth? Please excuse me a minute. <bzzzzt!> Hello, Security? ")

     While you\'re doing this (refuelling, not being locked up in psycho ward),
     your High Guard could be playing hide & seek with the enemy amongst the
     moons and ring system, using the magnetosphere to mask enemy sensors.

     Last note: I gather that gas giants are what give the solar system a great
     big hoovering & keep them damn comets from landing on our heads every
     couple of years. I\'d guess that a system without a GG would have heaps of
     debris like comets, meteors, screwdrivers, coke cans, uneaten felafels and
     other such crap floating about, slotting dumb Belters through the faceplate
     every now and then. Meteor impacts etc would be very very common in such a
     system.

     Tell me if I\'m wrong.

Check out "Secret of the Anchients", a CT adventure by GDW. (I think it was
12). It includes Gates, but they lead to alternate realities (pocket
universes). However, they can be set up so as to make stargate systems.

    'body' => '"Why a non-virus end to the rebellion?"

1)      Virus, in many people\'s opinions, is just plain unworkable, idiotic,
        and annoying.
2)      DGP had worked it out (at least a basic timmeline), and so it could be
        done with not too much work.
3)      It would not be the same as the classic imperium. The Ziru Sirkaa would
        probably be fiercely independant, and isolationist. Brzk (Bzrk? Brzrk?)
        might come back peacefully, when there was a clear emperor.The solomani
        have retaken the sphere. The civil populace have far less faith in the
        system. The attitude, especially after hard times and "The second
        night", would be a lot different. Much of RSB could be used unchanged.
4)      It would appease a major section of the "Traveller Amateur Historian"
        types, who reject virus.
5)      RC & RSB settings could be produced as a separate product sub-line.
6)      MM has already said repeatedly that there WILL be multiple setting books
7)      the TNE settings would not be in any real direct competition with
        Post-Hard Times (The Second Dawn?). The buyers would overlap, but would
        appeal to two different mindsets

"Why a rnadom/semi-random Skill Aquisition System?"

Because TNE, in my experience, and that of many other GM\'s I know locally,
like GURPS, Hero System, and all GDW House system Games, allows players to
"stick to a character" in multiple incarnations, by choosing the same basic
skills over and over.

CT and MT both had players choosing what types of skills they would get,
but being strongly encouraged to get different types of skill mixes for
every character. The MT Short Term Rule (an option under CT, the default
under MT, look it up!) provides for the fact that INJURY as opposed to
RIFs, Poor performance, or bad politcs ending a career, and also allows
aquiring Purple Hearts.

And "Survival" is easier than "Injury Avoidance" for tables. It also ios a
legacy of CT.

My ideal CGen would have the following lines for the left side (CT/MT
tables were term procedure on left side, skills tables on right side) would
have the following lines:

Enlistment              Same as MT, but add more carreers (make about 24)
        DM+1            and add some of the oddballs that existed.
        DM+2
Injury Avoidance        Failing indicates term skills only, and out in
        DM+2            1d6/2 years, rather than MT\'s 2 years.
Commission              As per CT/MT
        DM+1
Enlisted Promo          MT needed this; A good idea from TNE
        DM+1
Officer Promo           as ever
        DM+1
Special Duty            as per MT; flat rate chance for career.
Decoration              Add it to basic gen. Reduce the margins a little.
Contacts                Just like TNE
Re-enlistment           as per CT/MT

Allow Career changes (two enlistment attempts then draft for term 1, two
chances or done for 2nd and later, automatic DM-2 if changing due to Failed
Re-enlistment roll)

Also, I want a return to a purely d6 system, or migrate to a pure D10 or
pure d20 system.

----===----

And in response to somebody claiming that TNE did away with "hit Points",
look again! TNE not only uses hit points, but it also makes the average
(666666-x-6) grunt able to take more damage in the torso than ANY NPC who
isn\'t written up as a PC. Then add the fact that NPCs have but one set of
Hit Points, where PC\'s have 6!

MT\'s Hit Points was a quick method of dealing with damage, to resolve the
details of survivability later. MT\'s hits were a measure of how much damage
before you were no longer combat effective, and then before you appear to
be dead.

Responding to Phil Pugliese:

>>There is precedent; GDW has inval-
idated alot of the early licensed stuff that has been published, including
sector maps. (They generated new ones to replace the old ones). If individual
refs want to continue with the TNE timeline, "more power to them". Discarding
TNE doesn\'t fragment the timeline, it just changes it.<<

The key word is "licensed" stuff.  This was GDW material, much of which was
produced by people who have been with the game since the beginning.  Not shoddy
Judge\'s Guild stuff.  Just because a few folks don\'t like the canonized
material, I don\'t think they should ruin it for those of us who do.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^6

Nope. The keyword is "invalidated". GDW\'s "shoddy stuff" should be just
as easy to invalidate.
======================

>>That\'s easy to say when it\'s not *your* ox that\'s getting gored. But if it\'s
true then I\'d prefer that *you* create your own continuation of the TNE time-
line while MM supports the one *I* want.<<

Don\'t take this the wrong way, Phil, but your Ox has been riding along the
non-canonical path for some time now.  Why stop now?  Chances are, whatever new
development comes out won\'t meet with what you\'ve done either.  I still think
the answer lies in going ahead another few hundred years and making a Trav
universe in which we can all live.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It\'s GDW\'s (& your) ox that\'s gone astray & the demise of GDW shows how
far astray that ox has gone. Traveller did best with the original back-
ground & that\'s where it should return if it wants to survive.

Let\'s be frank here. It\'s obvious that you don\'t care much about what I
want bcause it\'s not what you want. Well, the feeling is quite mutual &
is one of the reasons GDW is gone. They told too many old-timers like me
that they didn\'t care about us anymore & we reciprocated. Obviously there
weren\'t enough people like you to sustain the comp. w/o those like me.
The question is whether or not the lesson has been learned. I have hope
that MM will make it possible for me to support Traveller once again.
We\'ve already seen what MT & TNE can do & neither of them cut it. Hopefully
this will change now. Hopefully.

  This is a supplement for the MegaTraveller game system.
It outlines 25 ships produced by the Arnelia Lines (a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Arnelia Credit Corporation)
in use at the time of the Imperial Rebellion. Each ship line
is accompanied by a full colour graphic and animated fly-by.
  This supplement is available on-line via the web on
http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/travaid. One ship line is free
but the cost for the remainder is 0.04 cyber-cents per ship
and for the fly-by.
 The whole supplement is available in a ZIP file for 1.20.
Arnelia Credit accepts only Digicash\'s trial currency system.

For me CT had a Space Opera feel to it much like Star Wars, Flash Gordon, and
the John Carter of Mars stories. As to Space Opera the game I have seen the
rules and they where only loosly related to Traveller in that they where both
a Sci-Fi Game and thus had some similarities. When I say I would like Traveller
to regain it\'s Space Opera feel I am reffering to the literary form and not
the game.

  Yes I would like traveller to return to it\'s old story line prior to Virus.
I would like to see a simplification of the rules or at least a basic rules
set. The current TNE system requires access to the net to find the modules
to plug and chug into your equipment, or you will have to do it all your self.
Time like silence is golden, why waste it trying to figure out a complicated
rule system when there is a simpler one that is just as much fun.
How many teenagers do you know, are so dedicated to a NEW game that they are
willing to do all the computations required to build a small ship, when they
are unwilling to do their math homework?

  We have to compete with TV, video games, and a great many other fun
distractions.  If we fail to get very many new young traveller fans then we
can kiss traveller good-bye forever. Eventually those of us who have played
traveller for 15+ years (I started in \'79) will ourselves fall to the old "I
barely have enough time to change diapers let alone do the computations to
build a starship" syndrome. Eventually all of us will stop playing traveller
at all, this time could be sooner or later. Keep the rules for construction
and combat simple and Traveller (IMHO) will survive.
  Either way if you fail to cater to the young teen crowd, you will not survive.

ok sorry, I got off my original subject.

genre depicts a world where technology has run rampant: the moral and
social implications of one piece of technology has not yet been
discussed before that technology is being replaced by a superior
version.

It does not have to be this way in Traveller, though!  In the
governments portrayed in Traveller - i.e., sort of feudalistic - the
controlling body would have a greater amount of control over
scientific progress.  Or at least, that seems kind of logical (flame,
flame).  Would they not have been able to control the disemmination
of "trouble" techs?  If so, then you would not necessarily have the
"chrome and gloss" of the cyberpunk genre, but you still would have
the high-tech that these fields would allow.  For examples of
high-tech see basically anything by Greg Bear (Eon, Eternity, Blood
Music, Moving Mars, etc)... this may not be exactly the direction
that people would want Traveller moving in, but it does indicate a
"top of the level" tech, or the kind of stuff that the Ancients would
have been able to achieve.

Of course, there would exist plants where the government did not have
as much control over the dissemination of technology... these coud
lead to places much like the Gibson view.  Imagine what worlds would
be like after the Final War/Virus would have been like?

How did you determine how much delta-v was appropriate to come
from each source?  I tried to design AZHRAE shuttles a while ago but gave
up because I didnt know how much delta-v I needed in HRF vs. HCD.  How
much delta-v can you use up by aerobraking?

I\'d be very interested to see your more realistic designs.  Please

What would be the extrapolated technology version of the HEPlaR
shuttle?  I know that HEPlaR produces more energy than it consumes, but
if this problem were fixed does it work?  And would it be practical for
atmospheric flight?  Does it help if I add air intakes?

    'body' => 'Earlier this month there was a rather interesting debate on the Traveller
system of Tech levels and it\'s major weaknesses/possible interpretations.

Rather than getting into that debate, it occurred to me that it should be
possible to come up with a "dependent" chart of technological advances
which would allow a GM to determine just how far a specific culture (one
worth the work involved) has come and what technologies are
(indigenously[sp?]) available.

This chart would strongly resemble the advances chart for Sid Meier\'s
Civilization, with advances allowing certain components (i.e. gravitics
allowing grav vehicles, Internal Combustion allowing Automobiles, etc)
with a hearty set of "alternate" technologies which may have never
appeared on Earth or perhaps only as curiosities.

the point is, rather than specific tech levels being required for the
presence of certain items, it is the prerequisite inventions which are
required.  This means that, as one arguer seemed to be saying, some
inventions may appear well before the TL of introduction.

By building such a chart and associating rising rules of probability for
each time period after the invention of all prerequisites, it may be
possible to get a good picture of a cultures technological history to
work with.

This chart would be unlike the Civilization chart in that "cultural"
advances would be purged; is religon really a prerequisite for anything?
can it be said to appear at any particular time or have prerequisites?
(ability to build temples maybe?)

Reaction? Suggestions? Volunteers?

: "Why a non-virus end to the rebellion?"
:
: 1)      Virus, in many people\'s opinions, is just plain unworkable, idiotic,
:         and annoying.

But it happened.  You can\'t just forget about it now.

:  2) DGP had worked it out (at least a basic timmeline), and so it
:     could be done with not too much work.

DGP propossed some events.  Most of them had to do with adventuring in
Hard Times and dealing with the "Baddies From The Core" rather than
solving the Rebellion.

:  3) It would not be the same as the classic imperium.  The Ziru Sirkaa
:     would probably be fiercely independant, and isolationist.  Brzk
:     (Bzrk?  Brzrk ?) might come back peacefully, when there was a clear
:     emperor.The solomani have retaken the sphere.  The civil populace
:     have far less faith in the system.  The attitude, especially after
:     hard times and "The second night", would be a lot different.  Much of
:     RSB could be used unchanged

I wouldn\'t consider the Ziru Sirkaa fiercely anything.  It\'s not
Vilani style.  As for Bzrk, well, he\'s taking the great dirt nap and
chasing his tail in puppy heaven.

: 4)      It would appease a major section of the "Traveller Amateur Historian"
:         types, who reject virus.

And upset the rest of those you may actually like it, or at least want
the last $200+ that they spent on TNE to actually mean something.

: 5)      RC & RSB settings could be produced as a separate product sub-line.
: 6)      MM has already said repeatedly that there WILL be multiple setting bo
oks
: 7)      the TNE settings would not be in any real direct competition with
:         Post-Hard Times (The Second Dawn?). The buyers would overlap, but wou
ld
:         appeal to two different mindsets
:
: "Why a rnadom/semi-random Skill Aquisition System?"
:
: Because TNE, in my experience, and that of many other GM\'s I know locally,
: like GURPS, Hero System, and all GDW House system Games, allows players to
: "stick to a character" in multiple incarnations, by choosing the same basic
: skills over and over.

This is not the fault of the system.  This is the fault of the
players.  If that\'s all they want to play, or that\'s all they\'re
interested in playing, then you can\'t fault the rules.  You really
need to start playing with some more creative people.

: CT and MT both had players choosing what types of skills they would get,
: but being strongly encouraged to get different types of skill mixes for
: every character. The MT Short Term Rule (an option under CT, the default
: under MT, look it up!) provides for the fact that INJURY as opposed to
: RIFs, Poor performance, or bad politcs ending a career, and also allows
: aquiring Purple Hearts.

There\'s no reason why you couldn\'t bring back the survival roll.  The
problem here is that you\'re comparing apples, oranges, and bananas.
The CT and MT basic character generation systems are almost identical
to the TNE one.  GURPS, FUDGE, and HERO are all points-based.  But
what you\'re asking for is the CT/MT advanced, which I\'m sorry to say
has nothing in common with either of the aforementioned types of
character creation.

: We\'ve already seen what MT & TNE can do & neither of them cut it. Hopefully
: this will change now. Hopefully.

Let\'s be really frank here.  If Traveller goes where you want it to,
it will die a quicker death than TNE.  CT as a game has absolutely no
appeal in today\'s RPG market.  You don\'t believe me?  Look at the crap
that does sell.  Am I saying turn Traveller into crap?  No, I\'d rather
see it out of print than done badly.

However, the attitude you\'re taking is no better than the one GDW
took.  You would prefer to displace all the TNE people because quite
simply, it\'s what you want.

MM has already propossed the solution to this problem.  Allow multiple
settings at different parts of the timeline\'s history.  It works!
It\'s simple, it\'s elegent, and many other companies do it.  Alas, all
the CT people seem to hate this idea.  Why?  Is it because they know
the future?  So what, set your adventure in 1050 and your characters
will never see the Rebellion.  Play in the Regency in 1202 and never
have them leave it\'s borders.  Play in the future ``restored
Imperium\'\' timeline.

The problem here is that you\'ve all become so self-indulgent that you
would all rather destroy the opposition rather than create a workable
solution.

Funny, we\'ve created our own fractionalized Rebellion.  Let the
history of 1116-1132 teach us something.

I think that about says it all.  I find it amusing that there\'s this lunatic
fringe out there that wants to ruin the party for those of us who moved forward.
 I have news for those folks:  CT and MT were not God\'s gift to RPGs!

CT, with it\'s "zen-like simplicity" was a fine system, but in sore need of
evolution.  That evolution came in the form of MegaTraveller, a hastily thrown
together, but not altogether unworkable system, and more recently in TNE.

TNE, no matter what you think about the background, has a very good, very
playable rule set.  I don\'t think the dissidents even gave it a chance.  They
just let hysteria take hold and fester over the years.

Just like any rule system, it takes time to get used to.  Now that I and the
players in my group are accustomed to TNE, we conduct combat sessions in just
slightly longer than it took us to do them in MegaTraveller.  Yeah, it\'s
different from CT and MT, which is not a bad thing.  But the basics are still
there.  Some people on this list make it sound like they threw out the whole
thing.  We still have skill levels!  We still have UPPs!  We still have a task
system!  The mechanics have been improved for combat, but TNE\'s essentially an
improvement and a natural evolution of its predecessors.

What\'s done is done.  We\'re talking GDW-canonized material here, not the shoddy
_decanonized_ Beyond and Vanguard Reaches JG materials.  I loyally stuck by GDW,
despite whatever misgivings I had about the Virus and Collapse and moved
forward.  Despite what some of the dissidents may think, the TNE background and
rules are not half bad.

Throwing out the timeline in favor of the static status quo of CT would be the
single _worst_ thing that could happen to Traveller.

Check out the latest on Jupiter:

GALILEO PROBE SUGGESTS PLANETARY SCIENCE REAPPRAISAL

    Preliminary analysis of early data returned by NASA\'s
historic Galileo probe mission into Jupiter\'s atmosphere has
provided a series of startling discoveries for project scientists.

    Information on the extent of water and clouds and on the
chemical composition of the Jovian atmosphere is particularly
revealing.  Probe instruments found the entry region of Jupiter
to be drier than anticipated, and they did not detect the
three-tiered cloud structure that most researchers had
postulated.  The amount of helium measured was about one-half
of what was expected.

    These initial findings are encouraging scientists to
rethink their theories of Jupiter\'s formation and the nature of
planetary evolution processes, according to probe project
scientist Dr. Richard Young of NASA\'s Ames Research Center,
Mountain View, CA.

    "The quality of the Galileo probe data exceeds all of our
most optimistic predictions," said Dr. Wesley Huntress, NASA
Associate Administrator for Space Science.  "It will allow the
scientific community to develop valuable new insights into the
formation and evolution of our solar system, and the origins of
life within it."

    The probe made the most difficult planetary atmospheric
entry ever attempted, according to probe manager Marcie Smith
of NASA Ames.  Entering Jupiter\'s atmosphere on Dec. 7, 1995,
it survived entry speeds of over 106,000

mph, temperatures twice those on the surface of the Sun and
deceleration forces up to 230 times the strength of gravity on
Earth.  It relayed data obtained during its 57-minute descent
mission back to the Galileo orbiter more than 130,000 miles
overhead for storage and transmission to Earth.  The orbiter is
now embarking on a two-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.

    "The probe detected extremely strong winds and very intense
turbulence during its descent through Jupiter\'s thick
atmosphere.  This provides evidence that the energy source
driving much of Jupiter\'s distinctive circulation phenomena is
probably heat escaping from the deep interior of the planet,"
Young said.  "The probe also discovered an intense new
radiation belt approximately 31,000 miles above Jupiter\'s cloud
tops, and a veritable absence of lightning," he noted.

    The composition of Jupiter\'s atmosphere offered some
surprises, according to project scientists.  It contains
significantly lower than expected levels of helium, neon, and
certain heavy elements, such as carbon, oxygen and sulfur.

    The issue of the colors of Jupiter\'s atmosphere has been
much-debated, but no consensus has developed from probe data to
date.  The probe encountered no solid objects or surfaces
during its entire 373-mile (600 km) journey.  This was as
expected for a gas-giant planet such as Jupiter.

    What are the implications of these findings?  Most
scientists believe that Jupiter has a bulk composition similar
to that of the gas and dust cloud of the primitive solar nebula
from which the planets and our Sun were formed, with added
heavy elements from comets and meteorites.  The probe\'s
measurements may necessitate a re-evaluation of existing views
of how Jupiter evolved from the solar nebula.  For example, the
lower-than-expected helium and neon levels on Jupiter relative
to the Sun influence scientific understanding of the process of
fractionation, the "raining out" of helium and neon during
planetary evolution.

    During the probe\'s high-speed, atmospheric-entry phase,
deceleration measurements high in the atmosphere showed
atmospheric density to be much greater than expected.
Corresponding temperatures were also much higher than
predicted.  The high temperatures appear to require an
unidentified heating mechanism for this region of the atmosphere.

    Following probe parachute deployment, six science
instruments on the probe collected data throughout 97 miles
(156 km) of the descent.  During that time, the probe endured
severe winds, periods of intense cold and heat and strong
turbulence.  The extreme temperatures and pressures of the
Jovian environment eventually caused the probe communications
subsystem to terminate data transmission operations.

    Earth-based telescopic observations suggest that the probe
entry site may well have been one of the least cloudy areas on
Jupiter.  At this location, the probe did not detect the three
distinct layers of clouds (a topmost layer of ammonia crystals,
a middle layer of ammonium hydrosulfide, and a final, thick
layer of water and ice crystals) that researchers had anticipated.

    Some indication of a high-level ammonia ice cloud was
detected by the net flux radiometer.  Evidence for a thin cloud
which might be the postulated ammonium hydrosulfide cloud was
provided by the nephelometer experiment.  There was no data to
suggest the presence of water clouds of any significance.  The
vertical temperature gradient obtained by the atmospheric
structure instrument was characteristic of a dry atmosphere,
free of condensation.  Only the one, distinctive cloud
structure was identified, and that was of modest proportion.

    The latest analyses of data from the Voyager spacecraft
that flew by Jupiter in 1979 have suggested a water abundance
for the planet of twice the solar level (based on the Sun\'s
oxygen content).  Observations of the propagation of
atmospheric waves across Jupiter\'s cloud tops from the Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts implied that Jupiter might have a
water content of ten times the solar level.  Actual probe
measurements, while subject to scientific debate, suggest a
level near that of the Sun.  Scientists are left to wonder,
"where is the oxygen?," "where is the water?," and to
reconsider their interpretation of the S-L 9 impacts.

    Scientists had expected to find severe winds on Jupiter
ranging up to 220 mph.  However, the probe appears to have
detected winds far greater, perhaps up to 330 mph.  The winds
remained fairly constant as the probe descended deep into the
Jovian atmosphere.  This suggests that Jupiter\'s winds are not
caused by differential sunlight at the equator versus the poles
or by heat released by water condensation as on Earth,
according to project scientists.

    "The origin of Jupiter\'s winds appears to be the internal
heat source which radiates energy up into the atmosphere from
the planet\'s deep interior," Young said.  "This impacts Jupiter\'s
climate and circulation patterns, and suggests a jet stream-like
mechanism rather than swirling hurricane or tornado-like storms."

    The probe found that lightning occurs on Jupiter only about
one-tenth as often as on Earth.  This is puzzling, but
consistent with the absence of water clouds.  A virtual absence
of lightning reduces the probability of finding complex organic
molecules in Jupiter\'s atmosphere, particularly given its
hostile, predominantly hydrogen composition.

    Scientists caution that results obtained to date, while
dramatic and exciting, are only preliminary and subject to much
further analysis and refinement.  Data transmission problems
associated with solar conjunction between the Earth and
Jupiter, the need to refine estimates based on probe and
orbiter trajectories, the presence of higher than anticipated
instrument temperatures, and the need for improved calibration
all require a cautious approach to these early findings.

    Additional information will be forthcoming over the next
few months as scientists continue to evaluate the wealth of
data obtained by the probe and to cross-compare results of
individual scientific instruments.  Further information and
images about the Galileo mission to Jupiter can be accessed on
the Internet through the following three URLs:

While I understand that there is a valid

and I understand the part about wanting
to play in a cannon universe, I feel very
uncomfortable about removing a pice of
history, that like it or not, (and you
might not like it, but that is the real
world, things exist which we don\'t like)
the TNE history is a part of the history
of Traveller.  Changing TNE history would
be just as wrong as changing MT or CT
history.

I believe that the best thing we can do is
throw Traveller forward into the future
where the Virus is a almost forgotten memory,
much like the black death is to us today.

Idealy we can divide the known area of space
into CT level tech, MT level tech and Really
High Level tech, to allow several playing styles
as long as each is supported equally.  Otherwise
someone will probably be unhappy, but on the
other hand that is the real world. (see above)

There was a group mentioned in the Hitchicker\'s

preservation of REAL TIME.  Preserve our time

not be a timeline left, once you start cutting.

I liked the normal traveller universe, and I liked the megatraveller =

The entire Virus history TNE setting is actually an alternate reality.  =
The other
reality on the other side of the gate is the normal traveller universe =
without the
Virus events, and both universes are going to be available within the =
campaign for the characters.  (Especially when I get more information on =
the normal traveller universe).

In my campaign, this virus history universe has an explanation for the =
"implausibility" of the Virus event:  At the time of the Virus "release" =
no virus was released, instead, yet another gate to a truly alien =
universe/reality was opened, a literal Pandora\'s box.  In this universe, =
the force unleased manifested as the "virus", although it was in =
actuality something alien, so much so that it was as some dark magic out =
of fantasy.  In my campaign, I worked out a semi-hard sci-fantasy =
explanation for Virus, which resulted in the same end result, but was =
more palatable than the inconsistancies of the virus described in the =
TNE book.

I created a nice summary table (for my own GM screen) listing combat =

 Is it possible to jump *inside* a operation black globe?
 If it were, you get a way station and mount a black globe and put a

outside for sensors and commo(they would relay data -via- a 10MJ commo

 Advantages:
 Impossible to find(well, might as well be)
 A fairley cheap investment(Compared to warships!), it should be under

 Defensible
 Disadvantages:
 Need a self-contained power source
 If you knock out your drones outside the globe, your blind as a bat

        So now you want Marc Miller to make the same mistake, and piss off
those of us who like the new stuff? Let\'s see, we\'ve alienated many of the
"old fogies," many of whom probably won\'t be back anyway. Let\'s see if we
can drive away the people who still like what we\'re doing, and then avoid
attracting new people! Then Traveller will well and truly be dead, and we
won\'t have anything left to argue about.

        Explain to me again why you\'re unable to run any kind of campaign
you like? Others seem to have no problem running non-virus campaigns ...
Sounds to me like you\'re one of those people who won\'t be satisfied with
anything MM decides to do if it strays even slightly from your Holy Writ.

        Because there are customers who like the detail and don\'t think the
"simpler one" is as much fun ... and by doing it right you can support
_both_ the detail and the non-detail people. See the suggestions people have
made for a "Non Gearhead" design system, which is a plug-and-chug
_compatible_ subset of the full-up system (without needing to surf the net
to find modules).

        One of the biggest gripes I have about this ongoing debate are the
number of people willing to shut out others simply because they don\'t like
the part of the game others like. The "gearheads" have been supporting a
simple design system in the basic game, but the simple people have been
shouting "away with the detailed system! We don\'t want it, so nobody
should!" Likewise, the anti-TNE fanatics have been shouting "Down with the
Evil Virus! We cannot abide it, and neither should anybody else!" ignoring
the fact most of the New Era folks have been SUPPORTING multiple settings
(including, BTW, Mr. Miller).

        Folks, how about a little tolerance for other people\'s interests?
It\'s quite possible to compromise and make _everybody_ at least a little happy.

Three places to look for details on gas giants & refuelling:

1. _Secret of the Ancients_ - a GG is explored. may be helpful i.t.o. temp,
winds, etc.
2. _Arrival Vengance_ - the first chapter, "Smoke Test", involves the Vengance
creaking and groaning through a GG refuel. A later chapter has a fuel shuttle
colliding with a "Roughneck" fuel harvester.
3. _Assignment: Vigilante_ gives full details on the "Roughneck" fuel harvester
(and probably a scenario? - I haven\'t read it for a while).

You may also sneak in "Wrong Way Valve" (Challenge 30-something??), if you want
a fuel line to leak or simply to have been reconnected wrongly at the last
maintenance overhaul (don\'t you hate it when mechanics wire up the reversing
light to your gearbox back-to-front?!)

Liked your descriptions - I may use them next time to hassle the PC\'s (who get
it far too easy!).

Jerry, for the record, I\'m a CT/MT proponent, despite having given
TNE a chance.  I agree with you, however, that trying to backpedal and
"erase" the Virus era is a bad idea.  For one thing, Virus does not strike
me as such a bad concept.  (Am I the only one on this list who likes the
background of TNE but not the mechanics?)  For another, it\'s just not
necessary (see below).

For those of you who are worried about playing in an earlier era
with the shadow of a pre-determined apocalyptic future hanging over you
heads, I have one simple solution: ignore it!  I don\'t mean "just don\'t
think of it", I mean: "allow the players to make a difference and prevent
it" or "adjust historical events so it doesn\'t happen".

When Marc Miller publishes the sourcebooks for the various
historical eras, I hope he includes a note explaining that these books
represent a _suggested_ timeline and that individual refs should feel free
to modify it at will.  In terms of supplements and background material, a
referee playing in the "Imperial Golden Age" will be just as well
supported if he chooses to ignore the rebellion as he will if he allows it
to happen.  The reason:  both general environments are supported.  If you
want an Imperium without a rebellion, you just have to make up your own
set of events to replace it. This kind of creativity is what being a ref
is all about, isn\'t it?  (The same goes for those who want a rebellion,
but no Virus).

Please everybody, stop TYPING IN ALL CAPS and *starring* all your
comments.  And for crying out loud stop about the ox, will ya?  :-) This
is supposed to be fun!  (yeesh, I\'m really sounding like a psycho-logist
here, aren\'t I?)

(doubling the price, etc).  I really only got GEnie for the Traveller and
GDW roundtables, and those seem to be somewhat moot now.

So, anybody know if the files in question are all available elsewhere?
Pardon the somewhat frenetic note; I just got back from two weeks in Japan,
and this seems to be a bad year so far:  GDW passes on, Marvel comics has a
major flake-out, GEnie begins to disintegrate, Babylon 5 moves to another
local station without telling me, etc.  Gaaaahh....

Here\'s something I\'ve been toying with for years, I never really wrote
much of it down before, so it might be a little dis organized.

A rationale for the 2d universe as presented in traveller:

The traveller system uses a 2d starmap comprised of sectors and subsectors.
Many people have expressed a desire to have a 3d universe, and have even gone to
some lengths to prepare statistics on how it would change the game universe.
Suffice it to say that it will radically change the universe under most schemes
posted to the TML.

My solution is one that is based on a traveller campaign I ran years ago.  While
I used a pre-FFW, Spinward Marches area, I wanted to have more unknown worlds--a
true frontier.  We assumed that Mdrives were blowtorches (fusion rockets in FFS
terms), but I also assumed that they weren\'t unlimited delta-v for various
rock/ship throwing reasons.  This new version would prefer a TNE-like limit on
total delta-v (even if it were raised a bunch).

Why 2d mapping?  Well, the maps used aren\'t actually maps of normal space,
they\'re maps of jump space.  This is why you don\'t see too much detail on the
large scale poster map of the Imperium.  The Sector and Subsector notation
evolved as as way to express large scale distances between worlds across
the width and breadth of the Imperium.

A bit of history may help.  Most of us are used to the "jump 1 is a distance of
one parsec" notation for Jdrives.  This isn\'t actually true.  When the Terrans
discovered jump drive in 2087, they started to explore the region around the Sol
system.  The first jumps were frequently misjumps, and until the nature of J1
space was established, the use of Jdrive was somewhat unpredictable.

What they began to notice was that they could make controlled jumps of about a
parsec.  Now a parsec is a measure of paralax equal to 1" of arc using the half
angle of a triangle using the star in question, and the Earth 6 months apart in
it orbit----a rather odd coincidence for the Jdrive to actually work in this odd
unit.  It turns out that what was limiting the jumps wasn\'t the normal space
distance, but their ability to calculate jump solutions, as well as their lack
of understanding of the way jump worked.  It boiled down to them trying in
typical "small steps" without even trying bigger ones.  The fact that the near
Sol area of the galaxy had physics that forced many J1 transitions didn\'t help
matters :-)  By the time they had figured this out, the term "parsec" had been
coopted by the Jdrive engineers, and since the histories we read are in english,
the terminology sticks.

So what\'s really going on?  It turns out that many systems are unreachable to
J1-6 drives.  This has to do with the complicated nature of jumpspace.  A J1
transition can actually produce a jump of many parsecs.  As it turns out (in our
spiral galaxy) the jump solutions have a tendency to form sheets more or less
along the orbital plane of the stars in the arms.  The situation in the core is
as of yet unknown.  These sheets are thinner than the thickness of a spiral arm,
but are still tens of parsecs thick.  Transitions between sheets are an area of
major study and appear to be possible if the J6/7 barrier is ever broken.  As a
result, the z-axis of the galaxy is folded into the jumpspace maps to simplify
the representation of the present accessible worlds for most sectors.  Several
sectors of the Imperium (the unpublished ones :-) are represented by stacking
maps with subsectors on top of each other.  Unfortunately the jump physics that
forms these "vertical" blowouts in the jump-sheets also creates barriers to J1-6
transitions along its margins (for all practical purposes a wall).

The jumpspace map demonstrates the relative positions of worlds with J1-6
transitions, as well as numerous empty regions that happen to have J-transitions
to them.  The actual distance between worlds has nothing to do with the map
position, those distances are for calculating the number of jumps required.
Major "landmark" features are actually in the large scale Imperial map, and the
features are actually in the subsector in the x,y coordinates, but the z
directions are subsumed into the j-routes.

This changes nothing about the history except that there is a sense of the
incredible resources just out of reach in the "Hidden Worlds" (as they are
sometimes called).  Misjump accidents have resulted in hidden world transitions,
but they are dependent upon the unpredictable initial conditions of the misjump
(although the documented hidden world misjumps are an area of intense research).

A fair number of sublight probes have been sent to the hidden worlds throughout
the Imperium, and the Scout service maintains a continuing survey of these
worlds, but it is slow work, and requires immense sacrifice on the part of the
explorers.


Possible uses:

Use a misjump as a start to the exploration of a totally unknown system...

a. The system is a "magnet" for certain types of misjump transitions and
is a graveyard of trapped ships that couldn\'t find the conditions for a planned
"misjump" back out.

b.  Potential for new races (who can\'t have Jdrive since the physics of
their system doesn\'t allow it to be used).  They\'d be know by radio, etc.
detected by astronomers (as they would know about _us_).

c.  Where\'d the Ancients go...

Want a hard-SF setting?  Take a slow-boat to the Hidden Worlds in a low-berth.

It\'s kinda fun, and adds a ton of invisible worlds to go to when you get bored
:-)  The only trick is getting back... anyone read "The Gripping Hand?"

From: That Computer Guy <darkstar@chopin.udel.edu>

: Let\'s be frank here. It\'s obvious that you don\'t care much about what I

 Let\'s be really frank here.  If Traveller goes where you want it to,
 it will die a quicker death than TNE.  CT as a game has absolutely no
 appeal in today\'s RPG market.  You don\'t believe me?  Look at the crap
 that does sell.  Am I saying turn Traveller into crap?  No, I\'d rather
 see it out of print than done badly.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It\'s not the rules that killed TNE & it wasn\'t the rules that made CT.
It was the background. How long did TNE last? <snicker> Yeah, it was
a real winner wasn\'t it. Now let\'s look at the CT background. No com-
parison. Traveler will stay dead unless MM get\'s back to the background
that made Traveller a winner & that wasn\'t MT or TNE, it was CT.
================================================================

 However, the attitude you\'re taking is no better than the one GDW
 took.  You would prefer to displace all the TNE people because quite
 simply, it\'s what you want.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funny how you object to the same attitude you have when it show up
in others. You\'ve already demonstrated that you have no concern about
my displacement yet you object when I show the same lack of concern
about yours.
============

 MM has already propossed the solution to this problem.  Allow multiple
 settings at different parts of the timeline\'s history.  It works!
 It\'s simple, it\'s elegent, and many other companies do it.  Alas, all
 the CT people seem to hate this idea.  Why?  Is it because they know
 the future?  So what, set your adventure in 1050 and your characters
 will never see the Rebellion.  Play in the Regency in 1202 and never
 have them leave it\'s borders.  Play in the future ``restored
 Imperium\'\' timeline.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maybe because we can\'t see why Traveller should continue to drag TNE\'s
dead weight behind it?

There\'s no way I can see that MM will be able fully support multiple
timelines. The new operation will undoubtedly be on a shoestring. The
competition is to see which gets to go first because whichever does,
if it fails, will probably end Traveller for good. TNE has already had
it\'s shot & has failed. Trying it again will only repeat that failure.
MT ran the system down. CT was the only background that was a success.
=====================================================================

 The problem here is that you\'ve all become so self-indulgent that you
 would all rather destroy the opposition rather than create a workable
 solution.

 Funny, we\'ve created our own fractionalized Rebellion.  Let the
 history of 1116-1132 teach us something.

       --Jerry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Well all I can say is that we\'re just acting the same way you are.
We are interested in products that fulfill our desires & not interested
in those that don\'t. Perhaps you should stop indulging your own TNE
habit before you criticize my CT one?
It\'s time to give the CT background a shot at saving Traveller.
And (as you\'ve already stated to me) you can always just make up your
own timeline.

Subject: Returning to the status quo

>>As for the timeline, I\'m at a loss as to why the CT/MT camp want to discard
the TNE background. They say they want the Rebellion to end, and then Hard Times
to pass without the release of virus, but then the Imperium will return to what?
Basically Classic Traveller again, so if that is the game they want to play,
why can\'t they just play it in the CT part of the timeline, and leave the
future for people who want to do more than just return to the status quo.<<

I think that about says it all.  I find it amusing that there\'s this lunatic
fringe out there that wants to ruin the party for those of us who moved forward.
 I have news for those folks:  CT and MT were not God\'s gift to RPGs!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

They both were a *hell* of a lot better than the travesty that was TNE.
I\'m amused myself by the "lunatic fringe" that wants to continue beating
the dead horse of TNE.
======================

TNE, no matter what you think about the background, has a very good, very
playable rule set.  I don\'t think the dissidents even gave it a chance.  They
just let hysteria take hold and fester over the years.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TNE background is what killed Traveller. Or at least it didn\'t save it,
that\'s for sure. It\'s time to get back to the background that was a success.
And that was the CT one.
========================

What\'s done is done.  We\'re talking GDW-canonized material here, not the shoddy
_decanonized_ Beyond and Vanguard Reaches JG materials.  I loyally stuck by GDW,
despite whatever misgivings I had about the Virus and Collapse and moved
forward.  Despite what some of the dissidents may think, the TNE background and
rules are not half bad.

Throwing out the timeline in favor of the static status quo of CT would be the
single _worst_ thing that could happen to Traveller.

--Chris
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nope, that would be the single best thing that could happen. The worst thing
has already happened & it was the TNE background. Let it die. And then it
would be "done" with & I could say, "what\'s done is done" back to you.

        So now you want Marc Miller to make the same mistake, and piss off
 those of us who like the new stuff? Let\'s see, we\'ve alienated many of the
 "old fogies," many of whom probably won\'t be back anyway. Let\'s see if we
 can drive away the people who still like what we\'re doing, and then avoid
 attracting new people! Then Traveller will well and truly be dead, and we
 won\'t have anything left to argue about.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nice try, but no cigar. How about "Let\'s drop this loser TNE background,
which not enough people supported anyway, & replace it with one that
had enough support to make GDW prosperous". As I said, each of us is
supporting the position that will deliver what each of us wants. We can
come up with all the arguments in the world but you aren\'t going to sup-
port something that doesn\'t give you what want & neither will I. That\'s
what it really all boils down to.

        Explain to me again why you\'re unable to run any kind of campaign

 Sounds to me like you\'re one of those people who won\'t be satisfied with
 anything MM decides to do if it strays even slightly from your Holy Writ.

I\'ve done these for Windows although using the MT tables and also supporting
all the advanced character generation systems (except Flyers I think). The
program includes full Vargr, Aslan, etc. generation as per the DGP books,
Zhodani as per the CT alien module, a flexible rules system (i.e. you can
cheat if you want), you can change between careers, you can roll the whole
character automatically or go through a roll at a time, altering those that
you want (using Brownie points, etc.).
I\'ve seen other programs as well with this sort of stuff in (though not, to
my knowledge, as comprehensive as mine).
Only problem is the first point you mentioned, i.e. (c) et al. I did put an
old beta test version of the program on the ftp.engrg.uwo.ca server some
years ago but I think this had a dated protection system in it, so it won\'t
work now. There was insufficient interest to cause me to update it further
and with the potential for a new rules set coming out, there seems no point
now, although I would be quite happy to use it as a core for any new rules
that do come out.

FUEL SKIMMING

Michael.Barry@FINANCE.ausgovfinance.telememo.au then made some comments on
Gas Giant Fuel Skimming...

Well I refer you too to Jo Grant on jo_grant@crd.lotus.com - he issued some
stuff on TML some months back, including a short story and (I think) some
fuel skimmer designs.

WEB MATERIAL

Go have a look at Jo Grant\'s web pages: http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/travaid
and give him some feedback. Hopefully it will also encourage others to make
the same sort of material available (i.e. including things like the animated
fly-bys).

TNE VS. CT/MT

Ok, it\'s clear we all have our views on this. Couldn\'t we resolve this to
some degree, perhaps by the following methods:

GDW has often \'gone back\' on previous \'canon\' material. Examples include:
* the re-characterisation of the \'Star Vikings\' into caring, considerate
technology enthusiasts...
* the re-characterisation of CT\'s evil Zhodani into caring, considerate
types who would never scan your brain without asking and who were only
defending themselves against the expansionist Imperium...

Ok, so let\'s say there\'s a precedent. How much of the 1200s Imperium has
_actually_ been covered in detail by the new TNE rules. Pretty much zippo, yes?

So we\'re all assuming that everywhere is hugely devastated, yes? Isn\'t there
the plausible excuse that the TNE stuff only presents this concept because
the books (including the rule book) are clearly all written from the
viewpoint of the RC, who have no contact with anyone outside them?

Is it therefore not possible that the Virus was not actually as devastating
as was thought, but that perhaps many areas survived much like the Regency.
Again, drawing upon a few minutes reading of Hard Times, one can quickly see
that interstellar trade and travel was already minimal (except in the major
centres of power) by 1126... yet the Virus was supposed to have spread like
wildfire on all this interstellar traffic... that wasn\'t there.

A COMPROMISE CANON UNIVERSE

So I would like to suggest to everyone (INCLUDING MARC MILLER) that it would
be quite possible to support the current TNE background but to have many of
the major power bases from Hard Times still in existence with quarantines or
alternative procedures having neutralised the Virus problem totally.

Why haven\'t the remaining power bases expanded to make a new Imperium? Well,
some might have joined, but others may have had 70 years to build up a real
hatred. History books tell of the oppressors from [insert faction] who
caused the downfall of the Imperium and who should be destroyed on sight.
Perhaps other factions have realised that to rebuild their economic base
they _have_ to cooperate. Yet expansion after war takes a long time. And
resources can\'t be wasted on exploring Wilds areas which might be very
hostile or neighbour the Virus or any one of a billion biological weapons,
automated defences, etc. used by the factions during the Rebellion. So the
return of the Imperium would be slow but the whole of the Solomani
(spinward? I can never get the directions right!) side of the Imperium could
have reformed pretty much without altering the history of the Regency or RC
and pretty much ignoring the Virus.

Comments please (to the list or privately)?

Sorry this doesn\'t solve the rules dispute, but BITS _is_ working on it...

Its not backed up at MPGN.  Though we would like to do so.  If Marc agrees
and Loren or some other GEnie subscriber (and I guess this needs GEnie\'s

I don\'t like the virus at all, but we can\'t erase it, we need to move beyond
it. That way people who like that setting can stay there, just as I prefer
to stay in 1110.

Its kind of intersting.  I have a friend who is going to start a Traveller
campaign soon.  He owns TNE, and borrowed all my CT/MT stuff.  He is coming
into this as a neutral party so to speak.  He is leaning to using the MT
rules set because it is advanced enough to allow detail without overburding
the system.  He hasn\'t said what time line he is running, but I suspect it
will be around 1205 shortly after the Regency re-opened its borders.

Actually we have beaten this dead horse to death.  We just have to wait for
new products and see what we get.  A previous message was saying to not
alienate the existing TNE fans because the "old-fogies" were already turned
off.  I don\'t think the old-fogies are turned off to Traveller, but turned
off to the shoddy editing in MT, and Twilight 5000 (ish).  Believe me,
whatever Marc puts out will be bought by new and old alike.  I own
practically every GDW Traveller product put out (ok, I\'m missing JTAS 1-5,
and a couple of MT adventures, and three TNE supplements) and I will buy
probably everything that comes out again

Lets move on to more helpful threads.  Lets start an TNS system going.  Lets
share world and NPC descriptions (like the RICE papers that have been
published here in the past).  Lets see some "Contact", "Ships Locker", and
"Amber Zone" style articles.  Time to help each other out instead of bashing
each other.

Not once did I say "WE MUST" I did say "I WOULD LIKE" when referring to a
particular rules set. I WOULD LIKE to see traveler return to the MT period.
I did not say "WE MUST get rid of the Virus piece of crap."  I could have
but having been on this earth for nearly 30 years one thing I have learned
to live
with is CHANGE. Traveller is about to change. Like it or not it will happen.
I have not shouted anyone down, I will try not to. I do feel however that since
Marc Miller is most likely reading this list that we should post our feelings
about Traveller. If multiple setting are to be supported then I put my vote in
for supporting pre virus first. ( this is called expressing my thoughts with out
 saying anything bad about the Virus period.
 There are a few good things about the virus period I like but I do not care
to game in that period. Also I do not like the TNE rules when ever I attempt
to play BR or BL it always seems to revert to a discussion of how the could
have done the rules better by making it simpler/less confusing. FF&S I took
three looks at it, and shelved it (it\'s still there). some of the ideas
where really good. I always go back to High Guard for my starships and I
only use
the old CT standard designs for vehicles. Boring? maybe do I enjoy it YES!
Will this debate continue? most likely. I suggest you prepare your self for
a long discussion about the various Travellers (CT, MT, TTNE, ?T) as many
people have many things to say, and the man who holds Traveller in his hands
is listening. That is why I said I would like to see traveller return to the
period prior to the virus and not WE MUST return the pre-virus.

Thank you for listening and don\'t worry I wont shut you out.
So don\'t shut me out

Whoa!

I wasn\'t suggesting adopting the chart of advances itself!  Nor do I
think the combat system is terribly nice (although I would note that
North Vienamese soldiers were (very rrarely) shooting down A-6s with
small arms fire, showing that a rifleman can in fact "kill" a bomber.
that doesn\'t explain why I had an ironclad attack a Phalanx and die,
though.)

I was only suggesting the method of making advances dependent on
prerequisites that are specific and defined, thereby allowing one path od
advancements to exceed another where they are not related - giving such
interesting combinations of technology as mechanical "computers" in
Napoleonic Europe, or perhaps Electricity usage in a roman empire
setting.  I am not sure exactly what is possible or reasonable,but the
implications seem far fetched.

This, of course, would be for building a culture that was independent of
the imperium or other cultures in its development.  It could also be used
for "wilds" planets that have \'come back\' to some extent.  Like some
other posters, I think that Iperial member worlds\' tech levels are a
reflection of the local tech ability to produce.

Can we all stop bickering about what Traveller should be like, and discuss
the current game as is?  I hope so, because I\'d really like to get more
answers to this post than I did to my Vargr question!

I\'m wondering (and forgive me if I\'ve missed out on the initial discussion)
what everyone\'s opinion is of the Empress wave.  What is it?  Why is it
coming?  What caused it and what are it\'s effects.  I have some thoughts,
but, as a New Traveller, I would rather hear from some of the More
experienced Travellers about their opinion before I commit to anything.

IMHO, Virus is killing itself off.  Everyone is complaining that it is
unworkable.  I can agree with that to a certain extent, however as the
Regency and RC continue to expand and while Virus continues to be self
destructive Virus will shortly be a problem in small pocket areas (The Black
Curtain, Etc.).  I reread something in the TNE book (page 97) last night
that supports this...

                "Most strains of Virus died out after a single generation,
and so         it is uncommon to find active strains of it anywhere."

        ...

        "...many remaing vampire fleets [and presumably individual ships as
well] are no longer jump-capable and instead locked in a single star system..."

These ships could be part of an adventure if desired, but "Most strains of
Virus DIED OUT [emphasis added].  IMHO this is why the RQS was so
successful.  It has nothing to do with success, it was luck.  It has already
been mentioned that a quarintine over that much area would be nearly
impossible, the RQS was lucky to be in the right place at the right
time(Rape of Trin excluded).

IMHO, The major issues are the coming Regency/RC conflict, the Empress Wave,
and just plain expansion.  The Regency/RC conflict could amount to little
more than minor skirmishes or it could be a full fledged war.  (BTW, The
recent discussions on the effects of Tech Level on wars has been
interesting.  This could be a major factor in the who would win an all out
war.)

The Empress Wave could be a major changing point in the entire Traveller
universe (although after the obvious effect Virus had on some people, I
personally would advise MM to avoid any sweeping changes from the Empress Wave).

Finally, The expansion of the RC and the Regency into the wilds should be a
major issue.  There\'s a lot of space out there to be retaken, and somebody
has to do it.  Correct me if I\'m wrong, I never had the privelege(sp) of CT,
but wasn\'t CT about expanding into areas where the players knew little to
nothing about what they were getting into.

In fact, the RC has everything you could want with regards to expansion.
You want a blood bath, have an S&G Raid.  You want deep thought, Try a
bootstrap or colonization project.  You want ethical issues, again the
bootstrap or colonization or even the rebellion on Spencer.  You want
players to know nothing, The system data on where they are going cannot be
located.  You dont want a new subsector to play in ("Mom said I can\'t leave
the proverbial safety of the backyard.") do any of the above in the RC.

This doesn\'t include the potential of espionage, starting in the wilds,
military service, freelance trading, etc.  I\'ve been reading a lot lately
about how blood and gutsy TNE is.  It doesn\'t have to be that way.  Sure
that\'s the Easy way, but if we wanted an easy hobby, we would have opted for
homemade nuclear reactors.

I know three things will happen because of what I said here.  Some will
praise me, some will flame me, but most will forget me.  But for pity sake
lets stop bickering.

I have played Traveller since its release.  I have owned, or still own
every item ever released by GDW or DGP, along with many of the FASA,
Seeker, Gamelords, etc., products.  Hell, Traveller is my handle on a local
BBS!  I feel qualified to respond to this.. gentleman.

Classic Traveller was a good game.  Please note the use of the word "was".
The system used was quite good for the late seventies, and should be
remembered as a milestone in RPGs.  Now as for background, the Imperium got
a 2-line mention in Book 4, and a vague definition in The Spinward Marches.
 Most of the Imperial feel came about late in the CT period, after about
1982, with JTAS articles and Supplements 8 & 11.

I have been accused of commuting between reality and the Traveller
universe, so please rest assured that I was among those most concerned by
the Rebellion, and later, Virus.  However, I saw these as good things,
advanceing the storyline.  No longer could the players comfortably hop from
system to system, secure in the knowledge that the Imperial Navy,
Travellers\' Aid Society, and all the other trappings of Imperial culture
were there to protect them.  They had to deal with the knowledge that
society was ripping itself apart, which made for wonderful adventuring
oppurtunities that went beyond the traditional "patron at the startown bar"
stereotype.

With Virus, we have redefined the Traveller Universe.  This is not post
holocaust role playing, it is gaming on a frontier, trying to rebuild what
has been lost.  For those of us who prefer the traditional Traveller
setting, which includes myself, the Regency provides the most detailed
sector in SF-RPG history, The Spinward Marches.  Nearly 20 years of
development has gone into that area, and it shows in the Regency
Sourcebook.

As an aside, my current campaign involves the crew of a Jayhawk-class free
trader in the Lunion subsector.  No mention has been made of the RQS,
Virus, The Collapse, or any other "New Era" convention, with the minor
exception that one of the crew is a Zhodani refugee.

All the information is in place if you wish to play a campaign set in 1104.
 If you want, have a member of the IISS Imperial Bodyguard Detail shoot
down Dulinor as he goes for his pistol, or have Iphengia live, or
whatever.. it is YOUR campaign, do what thou will shall be the whole of the
rules..

Simon\'s (hopefully) humorous comment aside, I think your best bet to get started
with Traveller is to hold out until Marc Miller\'s FarFuture Enterprises releases
Traveller, 4th ed., probably some time this summer.

That way, you\'ll be on the ground floor when the next, and hopefully _last_
incarnation of the game for awhile, hits the stands.

You\'ll have multiple historical backgrounds and media options to choose from.

If you want to immerse yourself in a bit of Traveller lore to get yourself ready
to conduct a campaign, I recommend the following products from each of the
game\'s incarnations:

>From Traveller: TNE:
--The Regency Sourcebook (excellent resource; the bible of my campaign)
--Path of Tears (if you like the idea behind the RCES campaign, this is your
tome)
--The TNE main rulebook

>From MegaTraveller:
--The Rebellion Sourcebook (a must have)
--Imperial Encyclopaedia
--Starship Operator\'s Manual
--Both DGP alien modules (Vilani & Vargr, Solomani & Aslan)

>From CT:
--Both Library Data Supplements (A-M and N-Z)
--Books 4, 6, 7 and 8
--Supplement 3, The Spinward Marches
--Supplement 10, The Solomani Rim (where Terra is)
--Any of the Adventures, but I wouldn\'t recommend any of the Double Adventures,
except maybe "Divine Intervention/Night of Conquest."

I tried to keep the list small so it won\'t hit your pocketbook _too_ badly if
you decide to use it, but there are multitudes of other great Traveller
materials out there.  This list really only scratches the surface.  The above
should get you at least partially up to speed on Traveller and give you a good
idea where you\'d like to go and what you\'d like to do once you begin a campaign.

Alvin Plummer asked how to deal with an extremely luminous star which, if

faced a similar problem in "The Mote in God\'s Eye" -- they needed (for
plot reasons) a very large, very bright red giant star closer to Earth
than any such actually are.  Their solution was to hide it behind the
Coal Sack Nebula.  You might be able to do something similar...a few
lightyears of relatively dense interstellar gas and dust along the line
of sight to your star would effectively hide it from our view.

Actually, this fits with the logical progression of things (I was pretty
upset at GDW as well).  Traveller\'s story line is very close to that of
Asimov\'s Foundation series.  Down to the PsychoHistorians and Project
JumpStart (JumpStart caches are basically "Foundation").  Expect Avery back
as the Mule after the Emperess Wavefront gets done with him.  "Collapse and
Rebuild" that is the story.  We are at the end of a collapse and time for a
rebuild.  My point is I want to play a bit more positive game, like
Traveller was -- High Adventure, the times of Heros, not so dark,  looking
to just survive.

I think GDW realzied too late that the players wanted the Regency area more
than the RC.

FarFuture\'s bests interests are to better the Traveller System.  I don\'t
think that there are just a few remaining players of a time held over.
There are two many Xboat\'ers for that.  The CT gang have said the same thing
about why MM should appease the few TNE players out there.

No, I\'m not taking your attitude.  You\'re saying that we should do
away with TNE altogether.  I\'m saying that you should try to
accomodate them.  I\'m not sorry to say that our attitudes have nothing
in common.  You don\'t believe me.  Fine, I attribute it to the fact
that you can\'t stand me attacking your position.  But your position is
to kill one facet of the Traveller universe.  Mine is to allow all of
them to be supported.  I\'m all for CT era products, and I sure hope
that they reprint many of the originals and come out with new ones
since the dearth in my Traveller collection is from that particualr
era.

: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

: dead weight behind it?

See, that\'s what I\'m talking about.  To you it\'s dead weight.  To many
other players it\'s not.  However, you refuse to even allow the
possibility of their happiness.

: There\'s no way I can see that MM will be able fully support multiple

: it\'s shot & has failed. Trying it again will only repeat that failure.
: MT ran the system down. CT was the only background that was a success.

Why not?  CT was the only background that was a success with you.
Many people like all of them.  Many people like the Rebellion.  Making
a sourcebook for each era isn\'t going to weaken anything.  Instead of
providing something for everyone, you would rather provide something
for yourself.  And you said I was the same as you?

: Well all I can say is that we\'re just acting the same way you are.
: We are interested in products that fulfill our desires & not interested
: in those that don\'t. Perhaps you should stop indulging your own TNE
: habit before you criticize my CT one?
: It\'s time to give the CT background a shot at saving Traveller.
: And (as you\'ve already stated to me) you can always just make up your
: own timeline.

No, we\'re not acting in the same way.  What you\'re proposing leaves
many Traveller players out in the cold.  If you\'re asking for products
that fulfill desires then you will need to cater to everyone.
Granted, some timelines may deserve more products than others.

Also, let\'s get something straight real quick Phil.  I\'m not bashing
your indulgence of CT.  What I am bashing is your attitude that says
to do away with everything but.  You assume that because I said your\'s
is a very poor, limited, and self-indulgent attitude that I am all-for
TNE and nothing else.  Take the blinders off and see what I\'m really
saying please!

Just so you don\'t misconstrue me again, here goes:  Support all
aspects of Traveller!  Period.

And just so you know, I prefer to play in the Rebellion!

Oooh, this is eerie. Rob (the list maintainer) and I were discussing
the Empress Wavefront just before we ate lunch.

It\'s really hard to say what it is and even harder to say what
caused it, because the references contains so little information.  It
is, I believe, possible to extrapolate a possible effect it will have
on the Regency based on what we do know:

1)  During their core expeditions, the Zhodani angered,
    betrayed, injured, annoyed or insulted someone or
    something.  Whatever the triggering event was is
    irrelevant, it\'s coming and we have to deal with it.

2)  It seems very unhealthy for Zhodani.  It is unclear
    whether all Zhodani are affected, or only the Nobles and
    Intendants.

3)  Somehow, the coreward Longbow stations were affected by
    it, so it is unlikely Zhodani-specific.

4)  The Regency as a whole isn\'t destroyed by it (There are
    \'quotations\' from Regency citizens dated after the Wave
    entered the Regency in 1205).

The obvious observation is that it affects psions, possibly by
inducing paranoia, megalomania or some other mental illness (or
illnesses).  It can be argued that the effect is stronger in Zhodani,
because they are much stabler mentally due to the ministrations of the
Tavrchedle [my spelling may be off] and are basically unprepared to
deal with this kind of trauma.  It\'s doubly damning when you realize
that the very people responsible for clearing up this mess are being
affected by it (I\'m having images of maddened Tavrchedle wreaking
havoc by claiming to be \'curing\' people).

Inside the Regency, psions are being affected by the wave, but not
quite as severly for a handful of reasons.  First, they\'ve had plenty
of warning by observing the Zhodani and could have developed some
defenses against it (drugs to reduce psi sensativity during the danger
period, placing psions in low passage, relocating rimward ahead of the
wave, self-imposed isolation, psi shields and so on).  This isn\'t to
say nobody in the Regency succumbed to the effects of the Wavefront,
just that they were better prepared (and taken care of quietly, to
avoid scaring the general public).

Why didn\'t the Zhodani try these measures?  Well, I\'m sure that they
did (they\'re not stupid, after all), it\'s just that there are so many
more psions within the Consulate that the problem basically became too
big to handle and their society collapsed.

(BTW, this also explains why the Longbow posts went offline.  They
were isolated and unprepared, totally caught off guard.)

As I see it, the only major effect it would have on the Traveller
universe is the disruption of the Zhodani Consulate.

They won\'t be gone, though.  With 30+ billion refugees in the Regency
(and that\'s in 1201!) they will most certainly want to return home and
reclaim their territory.

My guess is that it\'s probably some psionic race from the core.  The
Zhodani piqued their interest and now they\'re probing this region of
space.  More than likely, the Wave only really messes up psions.  I
know that this smacks of DGP\'s baddies from the core, but it does all
seem to tie together.

I read the stuff that there.  They echo a lot of the sentiments felt here,
but no flaming.  I suspect thats because you can\'t "quote" others.  They are
also averaging less than a message a day.

Most of the stuff being posted here is not garbage.  Its a strong debate
that has turned a bit bitter.

There are two camps that while light years apart on what Traveller they
like, agree that they want it to continue.  Marc has definite plans in mind
for what he wants to do and he wants our opinions on things.  We are giving
him that, but not quite in a civil manner.

To that I ask the list to try to avoid arguments, flames, and personal
insults. Comments like "You are a close minded gear head" don\'t help much.
Lets try to keep this as rational as possible.  If Marc is reading these,
and I suspect that he is, he is going to consider comments from Rational
posts more than comments from irrational posts.

Now on to other things.  This "what to do with Traveller?" question is going
to be around for some time.  We don\'t need to argue about which rules
setting or which era is going to be used.  Marc has made that decision
already.  Its going to be Classic Traveller updated for the 90\'s, and
multiple (5-12) eras are going to be supported including the Long Night, and
Virus.  Everyone wins.

I think that the things we need to be telling Marc is the following:

   a) what kind of supplements we want
   b) what format do we want
   c) what kind of tech changes would be cool


We thank you for your support.

Well, the one example of commercial gas giant refueling that I can think
of off hand is in the K\'kree book.  It definitely shows the down-side of
refueling.  A K\'kree merchant performs a wilderness refueling operation,
and then spends *six days* maneuvering in-system to get to the military
frigate that they were there to resupply....  Not terribly efficient,
but they couldn\'t refuel in the mainworld\'s oceans because the frigate
was on Interdiction duty over the mainworld.  That\'s one good reason why
big commercial ships don\'t all have one-gee drives, like the K\'kree ship
did.

I think another example was in _Signal GK_, but I don\'t recall the exact
details of the situation.  In a case like the Regina system, where the
mainworld is the moon of a gas giant, I\'d think it would be a lot more
tempting, and would encourage a lot more commercial traffic due to the
cheap fuel supply.  I vaguely recall that MT had a task for wilderness
refueling hazard avoidance, but I forget where it was.

        I might be able to live with that, depending on the result. Do you
know if he intends to provide something along the lines of a detailed
technical architecture like Fire, Fusion & Steel? That\'s the only part of
the New Era rules I\'m really hard over about, that and where it interfaces
with the rest (damage, etc.).

        These seem like mostly intelligent, mature discussions to me.
There\'s a lot of people who\'ve invested a lot of time, energy and money into
Traveller, of all versions. They\'re naturally upset and uncertain. Perhaps
if Mr. Miller were to provide some feedback here as well, people would
settle down. Right now nobody knows anything, and they\'re trying to make
sure their concerns get heard.

Let us not make Marc Miller into a piece of rope to tugged toward each
individual(s) taste/opinion of what direction he should take in Traveller.
If you like/prefer a particular version/revision of Traveller, then point
out the errors that it has and try and point some positive way(s) to improve
it without suggesting going to the next version/revision. If you do not like
a particular version/revision also point the things that detract from play.
There should be enough players of that version/revision to present ways to
correct it. Let us present to Marc Miller the errors in each
version/revision of Traveller and possible solutions from different angles
(Gearhead and non Gearhead especially) that will correct the errors. That
way he can evaluate each version/revision on it\'s merits and what will be
needed to make it more playable to wider group of players. He just might
take all of the information that we all have gathered/created and make
atleast three different sources for backgrounds. That way "to each his own"
can occur. If needed why can\'t we have three different mailing list for each
area ie Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, and Traveller New Era. In that way
we will not have so many feverant opinions being displayed with very little
value to the rest of the readers. We could also have a list for those that
just like "nitpicking" for every verison/revision. What we can try and do is
to maintain a listing of the errors/problems/nits that each version/revision
has and a list of possible solutions. All of this is because if all we do is
get embroiled into fruitless discussions over opinions then Marc Miller will
not take us seriously at all. He will then listen for the input that he
wants to hear and then go that way , ignoring anything that does not agree
with what he wants. If you want you can look deep into the archives on the
Net and on Genie and can see what happened last time when GDW made the change.

As to which verision/revision that I prefer well "The Thing Speaks for Itself"

PS Flames will evualated for techniques and originality all other will be

I am going to avoid getting directly involved in the which-era debate.
I would merely point out that Marc\'s plan to support multiple eras
and have a core rules system seems to solve everyone\'s dislikes of
part of one setting or another, and that thus you\'re all arguing
over a moot point.  8-)

Regarding 3d maps, I have done some work on them in the past.
I did a 5x5x5 subsector map at one point and done some universe
building in it, getting some interesting results.  In retrospect
I think I want to shift to 6x6x6 maps, so that you can never
jump 2 subsectors from your current one, but the general idea
works reasonably well.  You cannot try and apply this to
the existing Imperial setting and play map; it does not work.
But a new setting could go 3-D fairly easily.

..informed us that Marc Miller has opened a discussion area on AOL to
discuss the direction that Traveller will take.  She also implied that the
reason Marc may have done this (as opposed to participating in discussions
on the TML) is to avoid the uncivilised debate that is occurring.  She also
thinks that Marc has made up his mind on certain issues already.

Rob Miracle...
..then explained, to Susan, the difference between garbage and heated
debate, but agreed that rational discussion would be more constructive and
encouraged all to observe netiquette during discussions.  He then supported
Susan\'s statement that Marc has already made up his mind on certain issues
and encouraged us to start addressing more relevant questions in light of
this.

It is my opinion...
..that discussions degrade into diatribe when focus on the issues at hand
is lost.  Since the job of maintaining such a focus normally falls on a
moderator, and since the TML has no such moderator, that this should have
happen was merely a matter of time.

   Marc\'s reluctance to participate has not helped.  He, if anyone, could
have moved discussion along by, every-so-often, informing the list of what
decisions *had* been finalised and requesting discussion to move onto new
topics that still needed debate.

   It is a well documented developmental ploy, used by many, to decide on a
direction and *then* invite public comment which is subsequently ignored.
The developer gets his or her way, and the public *think* that they have
had input on the subject, and everyone is happy (or at least they think
they are).

   The most positive thing Marc could do is compile a list of decisions
that have already been made and make these publicly available.  He should
make it absolutely clear what is up for debate and what isn\'t.  If the
entire issue has already been signed, sealed, and all but delivered, then
he should do the Traveller community the courtesy of letting us know so
that we can get on with with our lives and put this issue to rest.

   If, twelve months down the track when the next reincarnation of
Traveller emerges, it is *exactly* as described in Marc\'s original
"directions" letter, then we will know that this entire affair (of inviting
comment) has been nothing more than a public relations stunt.  I, for one,
am sick of being treated like a lemming.

: It\'s not the rules that killed TNE & it wasn\'t the rules that made CT.
: It was the background. How long did TNE last? <snicker> Yeah, it was
: a real winner wasn\'t it. Now let\'s look at the CT background. No com-
: parison. Traveler will stay dead unless MM get\'s back to the background
: that made Traveller a winner & that wasn\'t MT or TNE, it was CT.
=====================================================================
:  However, the attitude you\'re taking is no better than the one GDW
:  took.  You would prefer to displace all the TNE people because quite
:  simply, it\'s what you want.
: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:
: Funny how you object to the same attitude you have when it show up
: in others. You\'ve already demonstrated that you have no concern about
: my displacement yet you object when I show the same lack of concern
: about yours.

No, I\'m not taking your attitude.  You\'re saying that we should do
away with TNE altogether.  I\'m saying that you should try to
accomodate them.  I\'m not sorry to say that our attitudes have nothing
in common.  You don\'t believe me.  Fine, I attribute it to the fact
that you can\'t stand me attacking your position.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can attribute \'it\' to whatever you want but we both know that
what really got you going was that you can\'t stand to see someone
stand up for CT, isn\'t it?
==========================

But your position is
to kill one facet of the Traveller universe.  Mine is to allow all of
them to be supported.  I\'m all for CT era products, and I sure hope
that they reprint many of the originals and come out with new ones
since the dearth in my Traveller collection is from that particualr
era.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OK. TNE can have the same support that non-TNE has been getting.
=============================================================

:  MM has already propossed the solution to this problem.  Allow multiple
:  settings at different parts of the timeline\'s history.  It works!
:  It\'s simple, it\'s elegent, and many other companies do it.  Alas, all
:  the CT people seem to hate this idea.  Why?  Is it because they know
:  the future?  So what, set your adventure in 1050 and your characters
:  will never see the Rebellion.  Play in the Regency in 1202 and never
:  have them leave it\'s borders.  Play in the future ``restored
:  Imperium\'\' timeline.
: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: Maybe because we can\'t see why Traveller should continue to drag TNE\'s
: dead weight behind it?

See, that\'s what I\'m talking about.  To you it\'s dead weight.  To many
other players it\'s not.  However, you refuse to even allow the
possibility of their happiness.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OK. They can have the same support non-TNE has been getting.
To be specific TNE moves to the end of the line.

: There\'s no way I can see that MM will be able fully support multiple
: timelines. The new operation will undoubtedly be on a shoestring. The
: competition is to see which gets to go first because whichever does,
: if it fails, will probably end Traveller for good. TNE has already had
: it\'s shot & has failed. Trying it again will only repeat that failure.
: MT ran the system down. CT was the only background that was a success.

Why not?  CT was the only background that was a success with you.
Many people like all of them.  Many people like the Rebellion.  Making
a sourcebook for each era isn\'t going to weaken anything.  Instead of
providing something for everyone, you would rather provide something
for yourself.  And you said I was the same as you?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Money is the reason. Where is all the money for all this simultaneous
support going to come from? Somethings going going to have to go first
& somethings going to have to come last. In light of it\'s dismal perfor-
mance I believe TNE should come last. I also fully expect that TNE will
never get to the head of the line due to the same financial constraints.
If the initial products fail then I think Traveller will be dead for
good. If they succeed then there will be pressure to build on that success.
In other words, whichever goes first will be what Traveller will become.
Now, since you don\'t seem to subscribe to this then I assume you won\'t
mind putting your money where your mouth is, so to speak, & put TNE at
the end of the list & then we\'ll see how much TNE stuff gets produced.

: Well all I can say is that we\'re just acting the same way you are.
: We are interested in products that fulfill our desires & not interested
: in those that don\'t. Perhaps you should stop indulging your own TNE
: habit before you criticize my CT one?
: It\'s time to give the CT background a shot at saving Traveller.
: And (as you\'ve already stated to me) you can always just make up your
: own timeline.

No, we\'re not acting in the same way.  What you\'re proposing leaves
many Traveller players out in the cold.  If you\'re asking for products
that fulfill desires then you will need to cater to everyone.
Granted, some timelines may deserve more products than others.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You claim that non-TNE folks won\'t be left out in the cold but putting
TNE first is the same thing in my book, so I don\'t see any difference.
It\'s like saying\' "You can have whatever is left over but since there
isn\'t anything leftover, well, too bad!".
=========================================

Also, let\'s get something straight real quick Phil.  I\'m not bashing
your indulgence of CT.  What I am bashing is your attitude that says
to do away with everything but.  You assume that because I said your\'s
is a very poor, limited, and self-indulgent attitude that I am all-for
TNE and nothing else.  Take the blinders off and see what I\'m really
saying please!

Just so you don\'t misconstrue me again, here goes:  Support all
aspects of Traveller!  Period.

And just so you know, I prefer to play in the Rebellion!

       --Jerry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fine, then let\'s put it to the test. Put CT first, then MT, then TNE
& let\'s see how much support each gets.

really began actively playing when MT came out.  I stopped playing when TNE
came out for several reasons: 1)I did not like GDW\'s house rules (from what
I heard, these are owned by Frank Chadwick anyway); 2)I did not like the
fact that other than pulling a Rip Van Winkle, you could not integrate a
current campaign into the new system; 3)I have a very intense dislike for
the "Virus"; 4)To me it looked like the only reason that GDW rewrote the
system was to cut MM out of any royalties.  Now that MM has regained control
of Traveller, I am again looking forward to playing Traveller after a 4 year
hiatus.

The arguing going on on these two lists seems pointless to me in light of
what MM has stated that he plans to do.  He has plans to publish support for
several different eras of known space history, thus covering past eras, CT
era, MT era, TNE era and (future?) eras.  He also has stated that he is
going to use updated CT rules (hopefully including the task system).

What we need to do on these lists is not to argue over which system is
better, but to give ideas that can be used by MM to make the new rules
better than any of the preceding rules sets.  As someone else on the list
stated (I can\'t remember who), we had better work together to give MM
constructive ideas before they are published, or else we again are going to
be rebuilding the rules after they are already published.

Jimmy Simpson
Lurker below

P.S. One suggestion to MM: as the rules are designed, publish them to the
internet for beta testing.  With all these fans out here, any bugs in the
system will be worked out within a matter of days.  Personally, even if I
got copies of the rules this way, I would still buy the rules as they come
out because: 1)I hate having my rules books in binders and unindexed; and 2)
most importantly, I will buy them to support my favorite game.

P.P.S. See if you can get the Andrew and William Kieth back where they
belong, writing for Traveller (along with their other books).

"The smallest Jump Drive possible, at any Tech Level, is 2 cubic meters in
volume."

Hmm, that\'s only slightly larger than a 2 ton Jump Torp requiires for J6!

So, it seems that even GDW agrees that Jump Missiles *are* possible ... which
means all those that oppose them as "non-canon" or because they allegedly
invalidate the XBoat system should, perhaps, reconsider their arguments?

It seems that they are *not* non-canon. It therefore seems that some of the

ships to be streamlined in all versions of Traveller if they wish to make a
planetary landing on a world with an atmosphere?

Or, to be more accurate, as seems to be the case in all versions of Traveller
*except* TNE.

What am I getting at here? Well, consider this, in CTrav and MTrav, Maneuver
Drives are basically reactionless thrusters and Contragravity lifters. They
enable spacecraft to reach fairly decent speeds in atmosphere, if they are
streamlined. But why should this be the case? From what we know of these
drives, they have no "stall speed" (none is mentioned anywhere) ... no minimum
speed at which they have to move the craft or it will fall out of the sky.
Ergo, even if the craft is shaped like a (large) housebrick, then the only
limitation on its ability to maneuver in atmosphere should be the maximum
speed it can achieve before it starts taking friction/heat damage. In other
words, if you *had* a spacecraft the shape of a housebrick, then why can\'t
you simply de-orbit at, say, 100 mph? So it takes an hour to land, so what?

Obviously, no-one from the design team ever considered the implications of the
matter! Even the argument that the unstreamlined vessels do not have the
internal bracing to withstand the gravity of a world they land on obviously
cannot hold water, as they are capable of withstanding at least 1G moves with
whatever they use for MDrives!

And if you look at CG Lifters (FF&S page #75), then you\'d note that the
description there even notes that CG lifters allow a craft to simply "float"!
This means that even Gas-Giant refuelling is possible to completely unstream-
lined vessels. They simply waft down into the upper reaches of the atmosphere
and pump fuel aboard (rather than make a high-speed skimmer type pass through
the atmosphere)!

Isn\'t it wonderful how you can break the rules apart when they give too much
detail!

Why isn\'t/hasn\'t it been done? One possibility is that it may require some
higher than normal degree of piloting skill ... unlikely, as any decent
computer should be able to handle something that simple. Worse, on most
civilised worlds they would presumably even have some sort of ground based
assistance for controlling the approach of such vehicles.

So, no longer need civilian craft be streamlined to land on a planet!

I\'m sure this will cause various people to spit chips and rant that it isn\'t
Traveller "canon" or that it shouldn\'t be allowed because it\'s not what GDW
meant. For the former, sorry, it *is* canon, whether you like it or not! For
the latter, sure, I\'ll even agree that it isn\'t what GDW meant, but so what?
It\'s what the damn fool rules and explanations of same *allow*!

IMHO i think that the virus is the best thing to have occured.
OK so all your old characters can\'t be played anymore and you are
*restricted* to lower TL ships, items and weaponry.
However there is now a challenge to upgrade your ships, make money
and make your reputation.
Before its
" Oh we\'ll just drop by XXX and pick up a few MFD\'s etc.."

Now, a good referee can turn the rack on the group for a long time.
The main moan seems to be that all the advantures seem to be combat orientated.
Well- design some other scenarios your self.
There no longer is a law governing the whole of known space.
But I would like to see some other *sectors* of space now and again.

Recap
IMHO I enjoy the virus idea.

From: That Computer Guy <darkstar@chopin.udel.edu>

: You can attribute \'it\' to whatever you want but we both know that
: what really got you going was that you can\'t stand to see someone
: stand up for CT, isn\'t it?

Oh yes, you\'re oh so right.  What\'s got me going is the fact that
you\'re supporting one of my favorite games of all times and not your
argument of reverse-discrimination.

: OK. TNE can have the same support that non-TNE has been getting.

Uhm, are you talking about the support that non-TNE has been getting
from me or from GDW.  I am not GDW.  Do not attribute their inability
to listen to what their customers want to me.  I was one of the first
people to blast GDW for releasing TNE and refusing to support any
other period.  I faulted them for not allow submissions to Challenge
for anything but TNE.  And I most assuredly told them off when they
decided to release all of those RCES products and sit on the Regency
stuff!

: OK. They can have the same support non-TNE has been getting.
: To be specific TNE moves to the end of the line.

Once again, please realize that I\'m not GDW.

: Money is the reason. Where is all the money for all this simultaneous
: support going to come from? Somethings going going to have to go first
: & somethings going to have to come last. In light of it\'s dismal perfor-
: mance I believe TNE should come last. I also fully expect that TNE will
: never get to the head of the line due to the same financial constraints.
: If the initial products fail then I think Traveller will be dead for
: good. If they succeed then there will be pressure to build on that success.
: In other words, whichever goes first will be what Traveller will become.
: Now, since you don\'t seem to subscribe to this then I assume you won\'t
: mind putting your money where your mouth is, so to speak, & put TNE at
: the end of the list & then we\'ll see how much TNE stuff gets produced.

Hmm.  I don\'t think that TNE will head the line either.  But this is a
completely different argument then what you first presented.  The best
solution would be for MM to release three sourcebooks, one for each
era, and then concentrate resources on the era that sells the best.
Speaking of which, what are you going to do if an era other than CT is
the big seller and CT has to be put on the back burner.

Just so you know, this would be good business practice (tm).
Something that if GDW (with whom I have no affiliation whatsoever)
did, would not only still be producing Traveller products, but
Traveller products we want to see.

: You claim that non-TNE folks won\'t be left out in the cold but putting
: TNE first is the same thing in my book, so I don\'t see any difference.
: It\'s like saying\' "You can have whatever is left over but since there
: isn\'t anything leftover, well, too bad!".

I NEVER said that TNE should come first.  You said that CT should be
the only version of Traveller supported and everyone else should suck
the pipe.  I said that this position is no better than what GDW did
and that all the timelines should get some form of support.  Uhm, I
never mentioned which particular timeline should come first or what
era should get the most support or anything like that.

: Fine, then let\'s put it to the test. Put CT first, then MT, then TNE
: & let\'s see how much support each gets.

No, let\'s put them all out at the same time and see which one sells
the best and then put the most support into that.  If for no other
reason than to cheese you off. 8)

        I am writing in reply to a couple of statements made on here. First
let me begin by explaining that I have been playing Traveller from the
beginning. I dont have all the judges guild stuff but have just about
everything else put out for traveller. I also was up till recently a game
store owner.
        TNE was not the cause of the fall of GDW. While it did not sell as
well as some games that tends to be the trend. See games go into trends
there was the cyberpunk trend then the tragicaly hip vampire trend.
Unfortunately for traveller it didn\'t hit a sci-fi trend. This coupled with
the coming of the magic craze it took many dollars that might have went to
traveller and gobbled them up. This was a double edged sword since many
distributors wanted to fill their warehouse with cards. At Origins Frank
Chadwick told a bunch of us that cards were one of the real problems they
were having. I think GDWs problems were a little more than just a those who
were displeased with TNE.
        Now for a look at the cold hearted reality. What ever MM does with
Traveller it probably wont look like any of the three editions of Traveller.
The reasons are economics and rights. First if MM produces something that
looks like the earlier versions many wont buy it because people will already
have it. So he will have to present something new that all sides will grow
to like. The irghts to Traveller went to MM what about TW2000 or Dark
Conspiracy all are based on house rules of GDW. Whoever owns them could make
knock offs of traveller products.
        My suggestion to MM if he still bothers listening to this fighting
is this list. First a basic rules book that only covers the game mechanics.
Make it smaller more digestable. In this book change the game mechanics. It
wont be that hard I have a couple of different versions of game mechanics,
I\'m sure MM will come up with one. Second step is redo FF&S do it in three
books instead of one. Currently there are so many errata that it makes it
hard. I would also try to make this more comprehesive. Third start pumping
out era source books. Give  each time period its own book that way everyone
can play in a time period they enjoy most. Lastly pump out support material,
like aliens, equipment and software. One problem GDW had was it was slow
getting stuff out.
        Anyway it\'s my humble opinion and not ment to put anyone down.

Traveller. I personally like the idea of the virus and gives the game an
added dimension for referees to work with.
I am reminded of an article that was in OMNI magazine some years ago in
which a geneticist discribed his theory that the human form was just the
latest vehicle for the carriage and survival of DNA (the source coding of
life). He believed that while humanity would continue to evolve, and each
step of that evolution would be encoded, humanity would also pass on its DNA
coding to self-replicating intelligent machines more adapted to survival in
harsh environments. The source coding for these intelligent machines would
then become an addition to DNA. These machines would then have become a new
carrier of the source coding of life (DNA) in its electromagnetic form.
Frightening.   Elaborate on this a little, by supposing that the next stage
in the evolution allows for the transmission of the source coding into other
machines and hence the expansion the carrier body, and one has the Virus of
TNE.  Frightening more.

Another thing I am interested in getting feedback on is synthesised Psionic
attacks. Its seems to me that if a certain technology (I can\'t recall which
level) makes available Psionic Sheilded Helmets then surely the
understanding of the physical nature of Psionic attacks was sufficient for
them to be synthetically reproduced. Can anyone tell me whether or not there
exists such a thing as a "Psionic Disruptor" or such like in Traveller to date.

Well, the "chart" needs to be designed rather differently. To use your
example, you can build automobiles with internal combusion engines, but
you can also build them with lightweight steam engines. The inportant
part is the power-to-weight ratio :-)

So (just like in the real world) there are *multiple* ways to do just
about anything.

"Inventions" is a poor term. Techniques and materials probably fits
better. And it makes it clearer that the item can be supplied from
outside rather than being "home grown".

"Cultural" type stuff *does* have place. Especially for the cases where
the technology is "home grown". It\'s arguable that monotheism is a
prequisite for the idea that there is *a* set of rules that describe
how the world works, for example.

>Reaction? Suggestions? Volunteers?

We\'ll need to have *several* "classes" of item. As an example:

Computers (ie ability to do complex calculations):
1. brute force
abacus/adding machine, with *lots* of clerks
2. "pushing the limits"
Babbage & difference engine
3. crude, but usable
Eniac, etc
3. "works well"
everything from early transitor based systems thru
early desktops
4. "special bonus"
the point where you can throw the item in to compensate
for the lack of something else (ie building in a
microprocessor just to compensate for the fact that a
device is difficult to control at the current "state of
the art") Most "fly-by-wire" systems are like this.

Note that the "Babbage engine" is using machining at a "special bonus"
level just to be able to function...

At the moment we\'ve got several "computer" technologies that are
somewhere between class 2 and class 3. Fluidic computers, optical
computers, TIMMs, etc.

BTW, note that class 1 and class 4 are opposites of a sort. Class 1 is
not *having* the "tech", and finding a way to get around the lack at
huge time and money. Class 4 is just the opposite. It lets you do
something so well you can compensate for lacks elsewhere.

A space shot requires some extensive calculations. You *can* do it by
the "army of clerks" method, as long as you understand oribital
mechanics. On the other hand, if you have microprocessors, but *don\'t*
understand orbital mechanics, you could build a ship that kept making
course corrections until it reached the destination. Maybe even one
that would figure out how to "optimize" the corrections by noting what
earlier ones did. It wouldn\'t be as efficient, but it *would* work usably.

So the "rules" need to allow for the possibility of "getting around"
the lack of an "imortant" item, if you have something else to
substitute. At the same time there *may* be items that can\'t be worked
around.

I have a feeling that doing this *right* could be a rather complex task.

what Marc Miller does with the game.  I\'ll buy whatever he publishes, and
I\'ll learn to like it.  I have loved all three incarnations of the game
so far, and as long as the next game bears any similarity to what I\'ve
learned to love, well, my wallet will be open.

  The only essential central theme will be the Traveller history - as
long as Marc includes that, I\'ll be happy.  The rule system is not really
important - if rules were important T$R would have gone broke long ago.
Every one of us has tweaked things to make them work for us, and I\'m sure
any future edition will generate a chorus of suggestions as how to make
it "perfect."  The best thing we can do is buy, buy, buy - that will keep
the game alive.

  So, as someone else said, stop complaining, and start posting some fun
stuff!

Pardon?  Maneuver drives were HEPlaR (High-Efficiency Plasma Recombustion)
drives the last time I looked.  These require reaction mass.  Hence, they
require fuel.  They have *always* required fuel.

ContraGrav is separate and used *mainly* for landing and docking
procedures, where more precise maneuvering is required than can be mustered
by the maneuver drive.

You can, I suppose, lump them together - but they are distinct units with
distinct functions.

ContraGrav drives are inefficient in areas where there is little gravity to
"contra".  In orbit, there is less gravity than there is on the surface of
a planet.  What this means is that if you drop from orbit, your ContraGrav
will probably not be able to stop you from accelerating *well* beyond
100mph.  Streamlining becaomes very important at this point, because not
only will it stop your hull from over-heating on re-entry (and turning you
into a crisp), but it will allow you to maintain navigational *CONTROL* of
your vessel.  In a maneuver such as making or breaking orbit, control is
extremely important.

ContraGrav and all of the maneuver drives in the universe won\'t do you a
scrap of good if your craft is out of control in a three-dimensional
tumble.

Oh, I think they did.

>Even the argument that the unstreamlined vessels do not have the

If a fighter loses control and starts plummeting toward the earth at a
constant acceleration of 1G, it\'s speed will increase until terminal
velocity is reached.  At this speed, momentum and moments of inertia are
all important and generate stresses on the craft well in excess of 1G.  The
pilots, strapped in a flight chair and wearing pressurised flight suits,
can experience in the vicinity of 10G in an uncontrolled tumble.  Key
structural points can experience forces *orders of magnitude* greater.

1G of constant one-dimensional (up-down) acceleration is totally different
to 1G of three-dimensional (uncontrolled) acceleration.

>And if you look at CG Lifters (FF&S page #75), then you\'d note that the
>description there even notes that CG lifters allow a craft to simply "float"!

Since you are in control (and barely moving), this would be a trivial exercise.

The deal with gas giants is that they have extremely volatile atmospheres
with sustained winds at *hundreds* of kilometres per second.  Yes, it is
theoretically possible to sit in one place and pump what you need on board.
However, not only would this be much, much slower, but you would be
constantly fighting extreme (essentially chaotic) atmospheric conditions in
the process.  You would be exposing yourself, and your ship, to extreme
risk for a protracted period of time in a chaotic environment.

Compare that with a quick, high-speed, controlled, pass with fuel scoops.

You have a point here.  It is possible, theoretically, although I\'d huess
that the modifiers on the Interface/Grav skill would be horrendous.  So
bad, in fact, that sane individuals wouldn\'t even consider it a viable
option.

>So, no longer need civilian craft be streamlined to land on a planet!

Until they think of a way to stop a falling brick from going into an
uncontrolled spin without adding stabalisers, I think it would be in the
best interests of the craft , the crew, and the cargo, to stick with
accepted aerodynamic principles and practice.

Um, I won\'t comment on this except to say that we use logic over-rides in
our campaign.  If you are more interested in the letter of the law rather

Phillip McGregor made some excellent points on the pointlessness of
atmospheric streamlining for spacecraft.  In summary, he points out that
if you can hover in a g-field using CG, you can re-enter at 100 mph, waft
down gently, and not worry about what shape your vehicle is.

I\'ve always thought exactly the same thing!  Especially during the CT/MT
"thruster plate" era, when delta-vee was practically free and limitless
(ah, those were the days...), I could never understand why pilots of
unstreamlined craft didn\'t just match speeds with the upper atmosphere,
then drift "straight down" (in the rotating planet\'s frame, of course) at
some nice, gentle speed for a soft landing.  Unless starship exteriors are
made of spun sugar, I can\'t imagine typical atmospheric stresses on an
essentially motionless object being a problem.  Now, land in a hurricane,
and you\'re in trouble -- but that\'s probably true for streamlined craft,
as well.

Now, if you go to limited delta-vee but *without* CG, you have a reason to
streamline ships...it costs way too much reaction mass to do a slow
powered landing (or takeoff) on a sizeable world.  You use streamlining to
get fast ascents to orbit, and aerobraking-assisted descents...because
you\'re watching every gram of fuel.

However, add CG into the equation, and this logic breaks down.  Decelerate
to a halt in the upper atmosphere, turn on your CG...presto, you\'re a
zeppelin.  Waft down at a nice lazy pace...CG is *cheap* to run,
energy-wise, and eats *no* reaction mass.  To slightly misquote Douglas
Adams, "it hangs in mid-air in much the way bricks don\'t."

Now, if you\'re a *military* vehicle, "hanging in mid-air" is equivalent to
"upcoming cloud of expanding plasma."  So for fighting craft,
streamlining, even airframing, make perfect sense.  You want atmospheric
maneuverability if folks are lobbing weapons at you.  But for merchants,
shuttles, liners, and virtually every other civilian spacecraft,
streamlining makes no sense.  Even if you want to get from point A to
point B on the same planet, it makes more sense to return to space, travel
to a point over your destination, stop, and drift gently down again.  If
you absolutely *insist* on atmospheric travel, I\'ll bet all but the
strangest unstreamlined hulls could still manage a couple hundred kph in a
standard atmosphere without shedding antennae and such along the flight
path.

So, what gives?  Anybody have a good explanation for the Traveller rules
on this subject?

chose not to.
    I like the TNE rules IN COMPARISON to the CT and MT rules mainly due to
the enhanced options for character creation. While I don\'t see the combat
rules as being all that "wargamey" (I\'ve been gaming since 1979; I\'ve seen
MUCH more "wargamey" combat systems...), there are things about them that I
don\'t like. Realizing that the next version of TRAVELLER will likely look
more like MT than TNE, I\'ve embarked on an experiment; I\'m porting over the
things I like about TNE to MT. Unfortunatley that does NOT include FF&S; I\'m
not that mathematically talented. But it does mean things like Background
Skills, Secondary Activities-giving characters more skills to start with. It
means looking for ways to bring over things like HEPLAR drives, and the
whole TNE background.
For me, the TRAVELLER UNIVERSE is the focus of my interest; the rules, as
long as they are playable and reasonably "modern" in design (which MT is)
are secondary.
        I\'m really looking forward to WHATEVER Marc Miller decides to do
with the game!

: You can attribute \'it\' to whatever you want but we both know that
: what really got you going was that you can\'t stand to see someone
: stand up for CT, isn\'t it?

 Oh yes, you\'re oh so right.  What\'s got me going is the fact that
 you\'re supporting one of my favorite games of all times and not your
 argument of reverse-discrimination.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Just a note about "The Way Things Work"; If you insult me, (the little
gem you so carefully editted out) then I will reciprocate. So if you
want to throw mud you can expect to get some thrown back.)

So Traveller is one your "favorite games"? Well considering
this venue, that\'s no big deal. I also assume that the moguls at GDW
said the same thing. It didn\'t keep them from messing it up, did it?.
=====================================================================

: OK. TNE can have the same support that non-TNE has been getting.

 Uhm, are you talking about the support that non-TNE has been getting
 from me or from GDW.  I am not GDW.  Do not attribute their inability
 to listen to what their customers want to me.  I was one of the first
 people to blast GDW for releasing TNE and refusing to support any
 other period.  I faulted them for not allow submissions to Challenge
 for anything but TNE.  And I most assuredly told them off when they
 decided to release all of those RCES products and sit on the Regency
 stuff!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
But *I* am talking about GDW. And, I\'m also talking about reviving
Traveller. That\'s where we differ. Now we already know that the TNE
rules system is history. The question is how much support will be
diverted to a background that had so little support, esp. considering
the limited resources MM will have to muster. There isn\'t going to
be a flood of supplements. Initial production will have to be limited.

: OK. They can have the same support non-TNE has been getting.
: To be specific TNE moves to the end of the line.

Once again, please realize that I\'m not GDW.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 See above. It seems to me that your proposal will lead to the same results
 that GDW produced. There simply aren\'t going to be enough resources to
 fully support everything. So, I say drop TNE. I *could* say, we\'ll just
 lower it\'s priority but I would consider that dishonest since I don\'t be-
 lieve there will be enough to resources to supprot it. But, if it makes
 you happy, I\'ll say it. Of course, you can always support it yourself, as
 you have so often stated.

: Money is the reason. Where is all the money for all this simultaneous
: support going to come from? Somethings going going to have to go first
: & somethings going to have to come last. In light of it\'s dismal perfor-
: mance I believe TNE should come last. I also fully expect that TNE will
: never get to the head of the line due to the same financial constraints.
: If the initial products fail then I think Traveller will be dead for
: good. If they succeed then there will be pressure to build on that success.
: In other words, whichever goes first will be what Traveller will become.
: Now, since you don\'t seem to subscribe to this then I assume you won\'t
: mind putting your money where your mouth is, so to speak, & put TNE at
: the end of the list & then we\'ll see how much TNE stuff gets produced.

 Hmm.  I don\'t think that TNE will head the line either.  But this is a
 completely different argument then what you first presented.  The best
 solution would be for MM to release three sourcebooks, one for each
 era, and then concentrate resources on the era that sells the best.
 Just so you know, this would be good business practice (tm).
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Well I don\'t see any reason to pretend that support well be there for TNE
when I don\'t believe it will.
Do you really think MM has the resources to put out 3 quality sourcebooks
plus the new rules set, all at once? I don\'t.
==============================================

: You claim that non-TNE folks won\'t be left out in the cold but putting
: TNE first is the same thing in my book, so I don\'t see any difference.
: It\'s like saying\' "You can have whatever is left over but since there
: isn\'t anything leftover, well, too bad!".

 I NEVER said that TNE should come first.  You said that CT should be
 the only version of Traveller supported and everyone else should suck
 the pipe.  I said that this position is no better than what GDW did
 and that all the timelines should get some form of support.  Uhm, I
 never mentioned which particular timeline should come first or what
 era should get the most support or anything like that.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I believe I said Traveller should get back to where it was successful.
Funny how that seems to have agitated you so much. But, ok, if it\'ll
make you happy, then I\'ll change it to; Traveller should get back to
the CT background where it had so much success. If there are enough
resources to spare, which I don\'t believe for one second, then MT &
lastly TNE could be supported.
==============================

: Fine, then let\'s put it to the test. Put CT first, then MT, then TNE
: & let\'s see how much support each gets.

 No, let\'s put them all out at the same time and see which one sells
 the best and then put the most support into that.  If for no other
 reason than to cheese you off. 8)

       --Jerry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Really pisses you off to see someone stand up for CT doesn\'t it?
You\'d have MM support all three even if it risks putting Traveller
under for good. Either that or you must think MM is independently
wealthy or has loads of venture capital beating down his door.
Fragmenting the initial effort will ensure a disaster. GDW made
their decisions based upon financial constraints the same constraints
MM faces. Problem was, they screwed up royal whne they decided what to
produce, squandered their limited capital & went under. I don\'t want to
see the same thing happen again. Forget about initially trying to support
everyone/everything. That can come later, although I don\'t believe that
Traveller will ever get that strong again, if it ever was.

Lower the power requirement, reduce the size of the needed power plant AND the

But you have never said that you don\'t think TNE will not be
supproted.  You have said that you don\'t want TNE to be supported.
Please don\'t go back on your original argument now.

As for MM\'s resources, we don\'t know what resources he has available.
The argument isn\'t one about viability, it\'s about your attitude to do
to other players what GDW did to you.  Pardon me if I tend to find
that hypocritical.

No, I believe that you said that TNE should be axed completely.  I
believe you said that there were a ton of reasons that you prefered CT
over TNE and that\'s what made you judgement okay.  If I thought you
were making a logical argument originally, do think I would keep

No, it doesn\'t bother me to see someone stand up for CT.  I truly
believe that people should play and stand by whatever version they
like the best.  What bother\'s me is your poor attitude.  You would
rather have Traveller pander to you and leave others in the cold
rather than even think of making as broad an audience as possible
happy.

You want to talk about resources and capital.  That\'s real easy.  If
Traveller comes out in any form reminicent of ANY previous release, it
will be dead with the initial rulebook.  Why?  There is one hell of a
stigmata that hangs over the Traveller line.  Shops are weary to carry
it and players don\'t think that it compares to today\'s games.  Look at
the top selling sci-fi games of today.  Star Wars, Battlelords of the
23rd Century and Battletech.  Traveller has nothing in common with any
of them while they all have that space opera feel to them.  Go to a
gaming shop and ask people why they would rather spend their money on
these products than anything that ever carried the Traveller moniker.

The fact is that your version of Traveller will only appease those of
us (and yes, I am part of that us) that GDW angered and left high and
dry.  We are not enough of a market to support Traveller.  Players
today are looking for different things in their games.  Look at AD&D
with it\'s multiple game worlds and settings.  Look at all the
"Universal Systems" out there.  Gamers nowadays don\'t want to be
locked in to anything in specific.  They want generality.  They want a
sourcebook a month.  They want variability.  Plain and simple.  Your
vision of Traveller does not give them that.

You want financial logistics.  Fine here goes.  MM needs to create the
games and find a publisher for them.  He will not be producing them
himself.  At least that\'s what he\'s said.  So, whoever is going to
publish them is going to have to be willing to support them.  All the
material for the new version does not need to come from MM.  Remember
the heyday of Traveller when great companies made great supplements
for the game?  That\'s a very viable solution to this problem.

You shouldn\'t be so worried about which version of Traveller all of us
here have panned and all of us have raved about.  You should be
worried about the new markets that need to be tapped that won\'t be if
we create yet another closed version of a game where all of the good
source material that is necessary to the story-line is over 15 years
out of print.  No one new will buy into that version of Traveller.

With reguards to "Virus is rare", you need to analyze the tables in TNE, 1
in 36 wilds encounters will be a virus ship. (Maybe more, but I KNOW it\'s
at least 1 in 36). So the "Virus is Rare" theory is not supported by
existing rules material. Especially since a single system requires 2-5
encounters on normal ops.

I think the empress wave is a stupid idea thought of to promote sales and
force the Zho\'s to collapse, so that the regency could afford to go
reconqer the corridor. Probably Psionic. Probably never gonna be developed
the way it was origionally envisioned, due to GDW folding. 80-120 years
past my gaming settings; I gave up on both the new era Rules and Settings.
(If you\'ve paid attention, I\'ve griped about these a lot, so I will spare
you now.)

Mr Berry:

Virus more than reshaped the traveller universe; It also reshaped the link
between versimilitude and traveller, and in many people\'s opinions, snapped
said link. Virus operated in illogical ways, and came across as "GDW
blindly destroying the Imperiaum and Rebellion cause they couldn\'t keep up
the quality anyway" or the staff at GDW going "We don\'t like Traveller, so
lets shovel it off into T2K".

By definition, the virus is a holocaust! It more than decimated (which is a
mere 1 of 10 dies), and in many areas supposedly wiped out whole systems in
a day or two. And it spread by non-existant trade! (check Hard Times, the
traffic wouldn\'t have spread the virus the way TNE/Survival Margin/RSB
indicate. Not enough of it.)

Since the virus is a holocaust, of interstellar scale, the TNE Setting is
by definition a post-holocaust, unless you look at the tables, and then
it\'s a intra-holocaust setting, as the virus is alive and well in the
desolate wilds by the charts.


Other:
For those who think the Jump Torp is a good idea: fine! But it should never
have been allowed by GDW in the first place. It will reshape the XBoat
network. Then again, it predated a firm concept of the imperium. Allowing
it for TNE was simply a stupid idea, breaking the links down between TNE
and CT/MT even further.

TNE vs CT/MT: They don\'t play the same way, the attitude of both players
and GM\'s is much different, They are not easily convertible, and they have
a totally different backdrop. a Bad move. To quote a friend of mine (a 15+
year traveller player) "When I want to run Space Operas in flaky variant
settings, I run TNE; when I run real traveller, I use Mega!"

To those who blame the game system:

Tunnels and Trolls is STILL in print, never having changed their rules to
"modern" styles. Same with AD&D and D&D; they are slowly evolving. TNE was
not a modern system either, but a late 80\'s system stretched to do
something else. GDW seems to have had a thing for invulnerable PC\'s and
massive warfare; everything since T2K 2nd Ed has had that kind of feel.
Mega had war, but not invulnerable PC\'s.

I will support MM whichever way he goes. But dont even try to stop me from
campaigning for a divorce of Virus and the RC/RSB timelines from the
"Historical" ones. I don\'t want it out of print; I just don\'t want it
called "Mainstream Traveller" There will be room for two settings in the
timelines, and many fine TNE unnacceptable. Either as a ruleset or as a
background, and many for both.

I actually think that the stations reported as being destroyed at the
start of Survival Margin have to be Zhodani stations of some sort, maybe
core expedition support stations. They can\'t be Longbow stations, as the
RSB identifies Longbow as large baseline Radio/EMS Telescope occupying a
Depot solar system in the Imperium. The confusion probably arises because
GDW mightn\'t have been clear on what Longbow and the Empress Wave were
exactly when penning the piece put in Survival Margin.


My ideas on the Empress Wave is that Zhodani colonists in the Chitterabl (?)
sector revolted against the focus the Zho Govt put on the Core expeditions,
to the detriment of their sector\'s development. Chitterabl sector is 250
parsecs coreward of the Consulate, and was, in my opinion, initially developed
to support the coreward missions.

So the sector revolts, some time in the distant past. The Rebel leader recovers
an Ancient psi-amp device (or Grandfather drops it in her path), and fires off
a psionic blast in the direstion of incoming ships. A blast which continues
to propagate rimward.......

What does the wave do? Kill psions? Rob them of their powers? Who knows?

One way out for some Zho Nobles and Intendants could be to use a starship to
\'jump\' over the wavefront, and become the new rulers on a coreward Zho world.
We know that Jumpspace is very different from Normal Space, so maybe the
Wave doesn\'t affect people in jump.

        That\'s the way I\'ve always played it. As long as you kept your
airspeed down low, it didn\'t matter how streamlined you were. Granted, in a
hurricane you don\'t have as much control over your airspeed ...

        Yup. For me, unstreamlined craft have been able to _land_ on most
planets. Maneuvering (or wilderness refueling) was a different story.
Maximum speed would have been under 100kph in an "earth-normal" atmosphere,
going down in higher densities and up in lower densities.

        As for the "Contra Gravity," I was never able to "suspend my
disbelief" for that. "It magically cuts the weight of everything within the
field by 99%" -- I ditched that real quick and assumed that the
ContraGravity generators could generate a force parallel and opposite to
gravity, and proportional to the local gravity (i.e. low gravity -- low
force. High gravity -- high force). That way, they couldn\'t be used for
horizontal propulsion, which stayed consistent with the way CG actually
worked in TNE. I never got around to figuring out details for how much force
it could exert. I just waved my hands and said each ship\'s CG was sized to
exactly counteract the ship\'s local weight and no more. So ships could hover
or land under CG, but needed thrust to go higher or move horizontally.

While we\'re on the subject of what MM should keep in the upcoming
"Traveller:  The Even Newer Era," let me put my *strong* vote in for
retaining FF&S.  To my way of thinking, FF&S, even with all its warts, is
one of the most remarkable pieces of gaming technology ever developed --
and a lot of people have put a great deal of time and effort into using
and extending it.  Note that with its "alternate technologies," FF&S
could (for example) easily support a conversion back to CT/MT "thruster
plate" M-drives.

Note that I also support a modular shipbuilding approach for all the
non-gearheads out there, but this approach should be compatible with (a
proper subset of) FF&S, with published designs in FF&S terms for the
modular subsystems.

Well thats not quite the way it works.  You see Marc pays AOL his 10.95 +
usage like every other AOL person.  The original poster did not explain where
this was.  In the gaming area under game developers there is a thread of
messages that was started I think by the forum manager about the demise of
GDW and What would happen to Traveller.  He had sent mail to Marc and was
posting his interpretation of Marc\'s response.  Marc posted the same letter
that he posted here (Jan 7th I think) as well as a complete listing of all
Traveller products published by GDW (which was kinda neet).  The rest of the
commentary is provided by AOL subscribers who are Traveller fans.

The point is:

   a) Marc did not open the forum
   b) It is not a Traveller Specific forum, only a Traveller thread
   c) I doubt he is getting paid, but rather suspect that he is paying...

Baring in mind that only workaholics would design YARS from scratch and
that genius would simply steal the best bits from the previous systems,
here\'s my suggestions for what to steal from where for Traveller 96.

A few introductory discursions ...
At base CT, CT + the DGP Task System (as per pre-MT TDs) and MT are
roughly the same excepting the personal (really only H-t-H) combat and
starship/design rules.

TTNE has no roots in previous incarnations of Traveller and is an alien
invader from the T2K/2300 universe. This particular alien should be
deported back to whence it came. Bear in mind that MM and the new
Traveller company, not being responsible for T2K or DC, have no vested
interest in supporting this rules system (commonality of basic system
being touted as one of GDW\'s reasons for TTNE having this particular
rules system).

Basically, I would prefer the rules of CT/MT with the following
exceptions.

1. Starship Combat : Brilliant Lances and Battle Riders are vastly
superior to anything in the CT/MT eras. Whatever system we get, can we
please keep BL/BR. Obviously they aren\'t perfect, but don\'t throw the
baby out with the bath water.

2. Skills and Tasks : Megatraveller\'s task rules were written to be
incomprehensible. Could we have the Digest Group CT/MT task system
(where simple means simple, routine routine, et cetera, rather than the
completely random TTNE task system) written in plain english (or even in
plain murkin). However, there ought to be a thorough clean up. MT had
too many skills - perhaps the TTNE cascade idea could be profitably
introduced. The substitution of one skill for another (e.g. Liaison for
Streetwise) should be cleaned up or removed as in TTNE.

3. Character Generation.
TTNE comes out ahead with a greater variety of careers and the same
level of detail for each. At least everyone won\'t be from the Navy, Army
or Scouts (well, I never did have Merchant Prince) if a TTNE-type system
is used. The increasingly middle-aged like myself can testify that
reducing skill gains over time is not unrealistic !

4. Ground Combat, Large Scale.
Striker II was a nice system and it would be nice to see something like
it for Traveller 96. As Greg and Frank are supposedly continuing to
develop the CD series, there should be plenty new ideas appearing to
steal for/incorporate in Striker 97 ! Mind you, like BL/BR it needs
tyding up. Without the benefit of huge experience I\'d say that HiTech
forces are not as good as I think they should be (in many ways even CDII
has more ways with coping with (relatively) HiTech forces).

5. Ground Combat, Small Scale.
Those who have only seen TTNE\'s risible combat system will be surprised
to learn that in the good old days combat was actually quite risky. And
so it should be. Bring back a system where you can be injured (or even
killed) by a .22 calibre pistol. But don\'t bring back MT\'s hand-to-hand
system, and don\'t bring back interrupts. The TTNE initiative system (my
sources tell me) works much better than interrupts with MT, and players
find it simpler to understand (although I\'m told it wasn\'t much fun to
try and calculate initiative for long-running characters).

6. Design Sequences.
Please don\'t have a design sequence for <small> arms. At the level of
detail of CT/MT, one gun is much like another. It might weight a half a
kilo more or less, but otherwise it\'s the same - seen one BFG, seen them
all.

I don\'t imagine that I can predict what\'s going to happen next week, let
alone by 5700. So, please, no irritating smugness over <scientific>
design sequences. I don\'t care if lasers can\'t penetrate armour; it\'s a
game. I don\'t care if Dave Nilsen doesn\'t believe in Thrusters (I don\'t
either); it\'s still a game. The risk of presenting an SFRPG as
scientific is that people with too much time on their hands (say 10
minutes on past experience) will pick holes in it.

All the same, I\'d keep FFS, albeit in some sort of Lite/Diet form. Lots
of it is quite nice. But we can\'t just turn the clock back to thruster
plates, not now that power plants use believable amounts of fuel. Is
HePLAR here to stay, and should we care ?

Whatever we get, can we have plenty of predesigned ships and vehicles,
clear worked examples of how the thing works and plenty of standard
packages of weapons, sensors and all to plug into home-brew designs. The
Internet is the ideal place to put this part of the system together.

7. World Generation.
What\'s to say ? TTNE had the MT system complete with some really obvious
old blunders. The Scouts/MT/TTNE system is here to stay, but why not
incorporate the very basics of World Tamers/World Builders too. And
let\'s have some ideas (stolen from Striker and TCS) on the likely sizes
of the local economy, armed forces and all.

8. History.
I didn\'t like Virus. I used to thing that Even Harder Times would have
done, but it occurred to me that that would have meant (Solomani Civil
War and all) a universe dominated by Toons. Certainly there\'d be no more
Steak and Chips in the Gateway, et cetera.
So we are stuck with things as they are. But MM\'s multi-era suggestion
offers the hardline anti-New Era folks the chance to do their own thing
and offers everyone the chance of a change from time to time. Way to go.

All opinions are mine alone (except for the ones I stole from my brother
who actually referees Traveller as opposed to my own calling as an
armchair critic).

CT is a MM product, at that time MM, in a way WAS GDW.

MT, and it\'s history, is for the greatest part, the work of DGP. Only
when GDW decided to publish TNE, it took over total control over
Traveller!

Now MM is the old and new controller of Traveller, and it should be
his choice on how to go on!

I feel, that we CAN go back and although TNE is not BAD (i find the

   Wrong Phil.  Unstreamlined ships may not enter a planetary
atmosphere greater than very thin even with contragrav.  In fact
installing contragrav on your unstreamlined ship is a bit like installing
screen doors on your submarine.  This is according to the rules (FF&S
and Brilliant Lances) and not just well considered opinion.

   As an exercise in logic, truly unstreamlined ships are built in orbit,
and take advantage of the airless, near zero-G environment to build
structures that would otherwise not be possible planetside.  Determining
whether or not your particular unstreamlined ship could *actually* hold up
to the stresses involved in making a soft landing would required the use
of a *really* good calculator, a knowledge of Physics and Engineering
that most Traveller players do not possess, and a series of formulas
that will cause the Liberal Arts majors among us to have math anxiety
seizures.  Not to tell you your business, but don\'t you have better things
to do?  I know I have.  But what the hell, knock yourself out.  In the
meantime, the rule is still the rule.

   As for the rest of your analysis, mildly interesting, but irrelevant.

   Well you go away for a few days and WW III breaks out.  Well since
I\'m apparently so late to the battle that my post would consist of a lot of
``me too``s and the pointing out of errors which by now somebody have
been slammed a couple of times over, I just give you my general
impressions.

   I am a solid supporter of TNE--that much is probably clear from my
previous posts to TML (assuming that anyone remembers what I had to
say on the subject of CT vs. TNE).  I also am a fan of what has now
become the historical settings of Traveller.  I came to the conclusion
that the Rebellion concept was pretty much a bad idea from the word go,
and though there are many things I like about the TNE storyline (I\'m
currently running a campaign using a homemade TNE setting), there
are some things I don\'t as well.

   It would appear that those of us who want to keep the TNE game
mechanics around for the FarFuture Enterprises version of Traveller
will not get their way.  Yes, it is still possible that certain aspects of TNE,
such as the Brilliant Lances combat system will be retained, but much
of what we know about how to play Traveller will be going out the
window when FarFuture Enterprises releases ``MegaTraveller 2`` or
``Traveller: From the Ashes`` or whatever the new version will be
called.

   Those who are CT fans should in no way be smug with victory.  The
fact is that not only will Virus still be a part of Traveller orthodoxy, but
the CT game mechanics will not be used either.  The new Traveller
will in all likelihood be something that is not entirely compatible with
any of the previous systems, which means that if you want to continue
your CT era campaigns using the new FFE Traveller, you\'ll have to buy
a new set of books and learn a new system anyway, just like the
TNE supporters did back in 1993 (TNEers face the prospect of
purchasing yet another rules set--the second in three years--MM faces
an uphill battle marketing to these people, even the writers and
collectors among us).

   So really you already have the answer as to who will win the ``TNE
vs. CT`` debate--everyone loses.  To my fellow TNE supporters I would
say at this point, continue to lobby for those concepts in TNE you most
want to keep (i.e. the idea of FF&S, if perhaps we won\'t see a FFE
reprint of the original, etc.).  To the CT supporters I would say, you
wanted to kill TNE, and you got your wish.  What happens when you
don\'t like FFE\'s Traveller either?  For what\'s cliche is still true--no matter
how hard we try, we can never really go home again.

We are not smug because we havent won anything yet.  Virus is here, and
probably wont go away, but new material will be out if I want to run a "Long
Night" campaign, or fight the "Nth Intersteller Wars".  MM is giving us
options on the background.  This is cool.

The rules set?  From what I can tell from MM\'s comments is whatever we get
will be compatible with CT.  While the combat system, the task system, and
other things will most likely be entirely different, if vehicals and
characters and equipment are somewhat standard with the CT rules, then the
$1000 of stuff I have collected can still be used and I will only be out
about $150 of TNE stuff. I guess thats what ticked me off the most about TNE
was the change in character creation.  Suddenly none of my NPCs were valid,
none of my Characters worked without a concerted effort to convert them, and
even then, my CT Pilot-4 had different probablilites than my TNE Pilot-4.
So to me any retreat to the rules of CT that allows me to use that JTAS #5
that I paid $30 for is a good thing.

I think that a FF&S type book would be great to have as long as it meets
three key criteria:

    a) I don\'t have to use it and an alternate simple system is in place to
       create vehicals and ships.

    b) The rules are clear and straight forward.

    c) You don\'t need a degree in Physics or Chemistry to use it.  You can
       measure a lasers out put in MegaJoules if you want, but I want a clear
       and concise game mechanic on that that means i.e. 36d6 of damage or
       a 40 penentration value.

The other thing that I really want to see is more Aliens and more worlds
described.  This along with the history and tid-bits of things like project
LongBow are great to build an adventure on.

GDW did a very good job at preserving the world information between systems
(though some would argue that changing the government types may have broken
the system).  Had they preserved the characters then the system may have
been workable.

Something else that I think would be a good product to put out is offical
sector data in an electronic form with a subscription to receive updates so
that when things like the "removed for the Communications Decency Act" of
Trin occur, the sector data can be updated.

Any way, I have talked too much on this subject and I am going to go back to
being a quiet admin.

In HG no ship of less than 100 dTons could carry a jumpdrive and thats it.
There was never a clear explanation to this but it was definately "canon".
Why rules covering j-drives in FF&S was so skimpy and loopholed is probably
because the designers didn\'t like jumpdrives and preferred stutterwarp
(notice that there is more rules about stutterwarp than J-drives. If one is
capable of building something weird in FF&S doesn\'t make it "canon", what\'s
canon comes from the history and sociology of the Imperium.
BTW Leviathan had jumptorps but that was done by Games Workshop and doesn\'t
count in my opinion.

The first point is already true of FFS, you don\'t _have_ to use it :-)
The second point is quite true.

>     b) The rules are clear and straight forward.

I would say that most of the stuff in FFS is actually straight forward,
but the whole of it isn\'t... ummm, the sequence to make things is kooky
frequently, way too much jumping around, but the "6MW/kl" to build a PP
isn\'t at all complicated.

This is already true, the final product is a damage value with no
units... this also means that we could make another conversion from
discharge energy to any other "factor" we wish... doing this with an end
result of a USP value would\'ve been a great addition IMO, and would also
have made conversions from HG designs easy.

system; they take place in the same universe. But when GDW decided to ditch
the Traveller game system, they didn\'t provide enough solid info on porting
over things from the old game. (The conversion system given in SURVIVAL
MARGIN bites.) With the new game (IF a good conversion system is provided to
bring TNE characters into the game), older campaigns can adapt quickly. It
was probably a mistake changing to the GDW House System. I liked it IN
COMPARISON TO Classic Traveller because of the greater control players had
over their characters and
expanded skills, but that could have been done in a more Traveller-like system.
I really hadn\'t had much experience with MT. I have now gone back and read
it, and am surprised at how clean a system it actually is! I\'m porting over
some theings from TNE, such as background skills and the Initiative system
(I hate Interrupts), but all-in-all I like it. And the characters we create
WILL be adaptible to the new game when it appears with a minimum of fuss.
What I don\'t want to lose from TNE the most is the BACKGROUND, which has

playing since Traveller was first published - pre-JTAS days!), my wish-list
includes:

- Good design rules (ie. FF&S, although I like the scale efficiencies in MT),
with either modular designs or lots of published designs for non-designers.
Nothing wrong with detailed design sequences if there are enough predesigned
items out there.  (In Space 1889, which has a simple sequence, people are
always tinkering with the rules to add some variety.)

- Limits on robot skills.  In MT you could easily get robots with really high
skill levels to run a ship - much cheaper than a live crew.  The Virus (for
all its faults) at least provided a reason for using human skills rather than
robots.  (My MT solution was to impose significant reaction penalties for
emergency situations.)

- Good world-gen rules.  World Builders Handbook, with the colonization stuff
from World Tamers, integrated into an expanded CT trade goods ruleset.

- Good task system, integrated into the combat rules.  Either MT or TNE would
do me.

- Nice starship combat sequence.  I actually like Brilliant Lances best, once
I figured the rules out.  Filling in the ship forms was harder than playing
the game!  Still, it felt more like a space battle than any of the other
sequences.  Same with Battle Rider.  However, there should be a simpler
abstract system for groups that don\'t like gaming out space battles.
(Something like the old abstract system from CT Mercenary, maybe.)

- Possibly the best solution for combat is to provide some simple systems in
the basic game with add-on games for more detail (rather like BL, BR, and
Striker II did for TNE - although the personal combat was more detailed than
strictly necessary, I thought).  Similarly, the basic ruleset could include
the modular design sequence, with the detailed sequence being a separate
product.  (I suspect this will basically be an economic decision - how best
to package the system for maximum market penetration).

- A variety of adventures, _quickly_.  I think TNE suffered from an early
concentration on covert ops/military adventures.  (So did Traveller, at
first.)  I\'ll admit they are easier to write, but I think a nice selection -
some military, some merchant, some exploration, some colonization, some
scientific... - will help the new Traveller gain a broader following.

>From a practical standpoint, I think the best thing we fans can do (other
than buy the game), is to start writing adventure material.  If everyong on
this list was to put together their favourite game (from any setting) as an
Amber-Zone-length adventure then when T4 comes out there will be a reasonable
supply of adventure material.  One of the reasons that D&D is so popular in
high schools is not the rules, it\'s all the adventures TSR cranks out.  The
kids can play D&D every lunchtime and never run out of published adventures -
and they keep TSR in business!

In CT and MT, the rules had gravitic based thruster plates; Delta-V was
free of reaction mass (you used the whole stellar system) and limited to
power supply durations (also much different under TNE.

Under CT/MT the rationale for streamlining is to allow for maneuvering in
atmosphere, gas giant refueling, and bracing the hull for "power-off"
situations. Since any USL design is set up and braced so as to push the
rest of the thing forward, not keep it from sagging sideways (one of the
effects of sitting in a gravity well, especially in an atmosphere).
Somewhere there is a reference to it in a published cannonical or
semi-cannonical (TD or a DGP adventure) source, it IS possible to do it,
but way to risky for the average pilot to accomplish, and way to risky for
routine useage.

Under TNE, where Delta-V is expensive, CG is separate, efficient, and easy,
USL designs should be allowed to land. A small 0.1G constant thrust when
you are effectively in micro-gravity (courtesy of CG) will get you to orbit
in no time at all. In atmosphere maneuver becomes limited to parking,
military ops, and eccentrics. Also, CG takes minimal power by comparison,
and you can keep it powered for upwards of 6 months, as TNE uses a 1 year
PP Fuel baseline, as compared to CT/MT\'s 1 month.

This change has had several fundamental changes in how players (and NPC\'s)
must operate in the game universe.

1: Frontier refuelling is now often several WEEKS of travel by thruster,
most of which is now coasting time. It used to be constant thrust, and it
dook mere days to get from a mainworld to a GG. For example, in the
Terra/Sol system, a 2G craft could get to jupiter in about 4-6 days travel
from earth; under TNE it takes upwards of 2 weeks due to fuel limits.

2: Frontier refuelling is now more hazardous. Most ships trying it are low
on reaction mass anyway. Having the limited fuel is a double pain, as if
you fail now, there is no "burn up and try again"; it has become do or die.

3: In system trade needs J-1 drives to be practical for any but the most
desperate systems; the time-related costs (LS, Food, Crew Pay, mortgage
payments, taxes) overwhelm the value of trade in system.

4: Mining of Planetoid/Asteroid belts is now far less practical; travel
times within the belt now point towards using J-drives more for in system
travel, and belts require lots of it. As miners have always been portrayed
as being on a boom-bust cycle, minersa now cannot afford the thrust that
they had free under CT/MT; their loiter time is greater, but their ability
to maneuver is severly cut. And thus so are their profits.

5: travel to jump and in from jump is now somewhat longer, thus longer
turn-around times.

6: With CG, Streamlining is no longer needed at all; the Zepplin effect,
while it slows the thing down, is quite doable, and much more practical
than atmospheric powered flight for space vessels.

Having just done a quick look-through of the DGP Task System for CT, it IS
the MT task system. No significant differences. (Page 2 of Grand Census) MT
had it spread out more, but it was the same system.

And it was always easy enough to just drop the time increment bit
completely, thus streamlining tasks quite a bit.

: Well I don\'t see any reason to pretend that support well be there for TNE
: when I don\'t believe it will.
: Do you really think MM has the resources to put out 3 quality sourcebooks
: plus the new rules set, all at once? I don\'t.

 But you have never said that you don\'t think TNE will not be
 supproted.  You have said that you don\'t want TNE to be supported.
 Please don\'t go back on your original argument now.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spare me. It\'s typical that you would want things to stay frozen.
I\'ve already stated that, to me, putting the TNE setting lower in
priority than the CT ot MT one is equivalent to no support so please
try to pay closer attention.
=================

 As for MM\'s resources, we don\'t know what resources he has available.
 The argument isn\'t one about viability, it\'s about your attitude to do
 to other players what GDW did to you.  Pardon me if I tend to find
 that hypocritical.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Well the feeling is quite mutual. If the TNE setting was viable then
GDW would still be around. But it failed & it\'s time to get back to
what was successful. Your impractical, "let\'s support *everything*
with limited resources", strike me as somewhat hyposcritical inasmuchas
*that* would be the fastest way to put Traveller under for good. That
doesn\'t sound like "supporting traveller" to me.
===============================================

: I believe I said Traveller should get back to where it was successful.
: Funny how that seems to have agitated you so much. But, ok, if it\'ll
: make you happy, then I\'ll change it to; Traveller should get back to
: the CT background where it had so much success. If there are enough
: resources to spare, which I don\'t believe for one second, then MT &
: lastly TNE could be supported.

No, I believe that you said that TNE should be axed completely.  I
believe you said that there were a ton of reasons that you prefered CT
over TNE and that\'s what made you judgement okay.  If I thought you
were making a logical argument originally, do think I would keep
flooding people\'s mailboxes with our trite?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Now. Now. How in the world could have missed so much of what I posted?
 Do you seriously mean to say that you never saw any text from me con-
 cerning getting back to what worked? Really?

: Really pisses you off to see someone stand up for CT doesn\'t it?
: You\'d have MM support all three even if it risks putting Traveller
: under for good. Either that or you must think MM is independently
: wealthy or has loads of venture capital beating down his door.
: Fragmenting the initial effort will ensure a disaster. GDW made
: their decisions based upon financial constraints the same constraints
: MM faces. Problem was, they screwed up royal whne they decided what to

: see the same thing happen again. Forget about initially trying to support
: everyone/everything. That can come later, although I don\'t believe that
: Traveller will ever get that strong again, if it ever was.

 No, it doesn\'t bother me to see someone stand up for CT.  I truly
 believe that people should play and stand by whatever version they
 like the best.  What bother\'s me is your poor attitude.  You would
 rather have Traveller pander to you and leave others in the cold
 rather than even think of making as broad an audience as possible
 happy.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So I\'m standing by CT. And you\'re upset. I also find it strange that
I didn\'t see you jumping up in protest when all those "if you want support
than provide it itself" msgs came out when myself or anyone else expressed
a desire to see more than TNE stuff before GDW went under. Maybe time for
the \'H\' word again?

So you can\'t accept that there won\'t be enough money to support everything.
Fine. Just don\'t expect me to buy into it.
======================

 You want to talk about resources and capital.  That\'s real easy.  If
 Traveller comes out in any form reminicent of ANY previous release, it
 will be dead with the initial rulebook.  Why?  There is one hell of a
 stigmata that hangs over the Traveller line.  Shops are weary to carry
 it and players don\'t think that it compares to today\'s games.  Look at
 the top selling sci-fi games of today.  Star Wars, Battlelords of the
 23rd Century and Battletech.  Traveller has nothing in common with any
 of them while they all have that space opera feel to them.  Go to a
 gaming shop and ask people why they would rather spend their money on
 these products than anything that ever carried the Traveller moniker.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If it\'s not "reminescent" of earlier versions then it won\'t be "Traveller"
any more than \'2300AD\' was. Which means in name only. This is what you
call a desire to support Traveller? The stigmata that Trav carries is
carried by the name. Stores will be reluctant to carry it no matter what.
Your strategy will just repeat GDW\'s previous mistakes. They\'ve already
tried it, twice, & it failed both times. I said I wanted "Traveller",
not something "that has nothing in common" with it but the name. It may
as well just be dead it that case.
==================================

 The fact is that your version of Traveller will only appease those of
 us (and yes, I am part of that us) that GDW angered and left high and
 dry.  We are not enough of a market to support Traveller.  Players
 today are looking for different things in their games.  Look at AD&D
 with it\'s multiple game worlds and settings.  Look at all the
 "Universal Systems" out there.  Gamers nowadays don\'t want to be
 locked in to anything in specific.  They want generality.  They want a
 sourcebook a month.  They want variability.  Plain and simple.  Your
 vision of Traveller does not give them that.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You statement about "not enough of a market", is just speculation.
All we know for sure is that CT had enough of a market while MT had
less & TNE didn\'t for sure. Which one sounds to you like it has the best
chance of reviving Trav? "A sourcebook a month"! That\'s never going
to happen. You must think MM is independently wealthy or somesuch.
Forget it. It\'s never going to happen. We\'ll be lucky to see one era
supported adequately & that doesn\'t mean a sourcebook a month. Maybe
every 6 months. Maybe.
======================

You want financial logistics.  Fine here goes.  MM needs to create the
games and find a publisher for them.  He will not be producing them
himself.  At least that\'s what he\'s said.  So, whoever is going to
publish them is going to have to be willing to support them.  All the
material for the new version does not need to come from MM.  Remember
the heyday of Traveller when great companies made great supplements
for the game?  That\'s a very viable solution to this problem.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the "stigmata", as you put it, that Trav carries I don\'t see this
happening except on a limited shoestring basis. Too much risk. Remember
what DGP said about producing license work before they dumped MT? It
was a mistake all right but such reasoning isn\'t uncommon. And then you
still have the "trashy license productions" syndrome that has been re-
cently been posted in this thread. That\'s yet another stigmata.
===============================================================

You shouldn\'t be so worried about which version of Traveller all of us
here have panned and all of us have raved about.  You should be
worried about the new markets that need to be tapped that won\'t be if
we create yet another closed version of a game where all of the good
source material that is necessary to the story-line is over 15 years
out of print.  No one new will buy into that version of Traveller.

       --Jerry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to drop your grandiose dreams of a resurgent Traveller that
will exceed even it\'s own Golden Years. It\'s not gonna\' happen. The
time for that is long past. GDW tried your "new markets" scheme twice
& it failed, twice. This strategy will only bury it for good. Traveller
needs to go back to what worked for it previosly & then build from there.
Otherwise it may just as well be, "Traveller - AD&D", "Traveller - The
Clans", or something else that wouldn\'t be Traveller at all.

Its good to have a BL/BR type space combat system, but there needs to be a
simple combat resolution that doesn\'t get into forms.  I would like to be
able to resolve a A2 Far Trader vs. Corsair combat in less than 5 minutes
from the start of the event until the finish.

I felt the MT task system was quite easy to work with:
   3+ for an Easy Task
   7+ for an Average Task
  11+ for a Difficult Task
  15+ for a Formidable Task
  19+ for an Impossible Task (on 2d6 + DMs)

There was simple addition and a dice roll.  Compaired to TNE\'s Task System:

     (Skill + Stat + DMs) {*/} difficulty. on a D20 and then
       Compare the roll to the task value and to +- 10 for critical
       success or failure.

While Multiplication and Division are simple math functions they still are
more time consuming.  Don\'t get me wrong, the TNE task system is a workable
system, but it is more time demanding than the MT task system.  I didn\'t
care for the MT concept of Skill/5 as an additional DM on the roll as it
started to induce unnecessary math (as you stats started dropping due to
injury you had to recompute your DMs)

Please point me to the TNE rules that lets me build or modify a starship
without using FF&S.  You are the second to say that I don\'t have to use
FF&S, but I don\'t see a way around it.  I can find no design squences for

I hope I missed something.

Hear! Hear!  That was the beauty of CT.  The core system was simple.  If you
were into resolving detailed combat, there was Stiker.  If you wanted to
resolve Fleet Actions there was High Guard (as well as an advanced design
sequence).  A given Ref could pick and choose which complexities to add to
his game without being forced into any one by itself.  This is something I
really want to see in the next version.  I don\'t want anyone to not have the
detail they want.  You want to have space combat with realistic movement, go
for it, just provide a way to do it in a simple "Bang! your dead" fashion as
well.

We have over 500 unique addresses on the two lists.  If 10% were to produce
one Amber Zone, and another 10% were to produce a minor alien or other life
form, think of the detail we would add to the game.  But lets not stop
there.  The RICE papers were execellent, but only a few people contributed
them.  If everyone one the list just did one planet, we would completely
describe the Spinward Marches (or any other selected sector).

But why stop there?  Submit events from your game in a Traveller\'s News
Service style article.  Then every GM on this list would have little
tid-bits to fill out their game, and their tid-bits would fill out your
game.  Its called collabrative gaming.  We have the tools and the
Technology, but we don\'t use it.
Would it help to have a third list that was not for disucussion, but simply
for fan generated stuff (it certanly would make archiving it to ftp.mpgn.com
easier).

Hmmmmm.....

        In my core expedition campaign, Core Wars ends when the last
        remaining Khelda warlord hooks up an recovered Primordial psi
        amplifier to anti-matter battery, in desperate attempt to stop
        Zhodani retribution strike.

        The psi-amp is overloaded by AM-battery, and when it explodes it
        sends an energy wave that has similar effects as the Primordial
        psi-amp found in Shimmering City (See Knightfall, Shimmering City
        area 16, Nugget 5). The immediate effects of psi-amp is that the
        target\'s latent psionic powers will be temporarily awakened, and
        his psionic strength is permanently raised to 12.

        As in Knightfall, the target of psi-amp has strong psionic
        powers with no skill to control them. This means that he may
        accidentally kill other people or himself with random thought
        patterns. A strong psion with uncontrollable pyrokinetic powers
        can be extremely dangerous.

        The Empress Wave is likely to lose power as it travels towards
        rim, but its effects on Zhodani society will be devastating.
        As the Zhodani social status depends on psionic strength, and
        everyone (including nobles and proles) who survives the wave
        will have PSI-12, the whole basis of society will collapse.

        Of course, this effect will last only for one generation, but
        during this time, there will not be any real difference between
        nobles, intendants and proles.

Well, yes, on page #10 of FF&S, column #2, second paragraph it *does* say that
"unstreamlined hulls may do neither" ... i.e. neither skim gas giants as
streamlined hulls nor land on planets with an atmosphere as aerofoil hulls.

But my point is, *so what*?! There is information elsewhere that makes that
statement a nonsense. The two key points -

* F&S, pg. #16, Section #8: Atmospheric Speed = notes that spacecraft with
contragrav lifters (or Thruster Plates, which were canon for more than twice
as long as cg lifters) "may fly NOE" and that safe NOE speeds are limited by
avionics and their safe maximum speed ... but that even craft with no NOE
avionics may fly NOE at 40 kph.

Assuming that you accept this as canon - and, gee, Chadwick and Nilsen have
said it in FF&S, the "holy book", haven\'t they?! - then it makes it quite plain
that craft with Thruster Plates (CT/MTrav) and contragrav lifters (TNE) have
a "stall speed" of less than 40 kph!

Ergo, they do not need to be streamlined. There is *no* connection in FF&S
between streamlined/aerofoil hullforms and contragrav lifters/thruster plates.
Perhaps there *should* have been ... perhaps *you* will insist *non-canonical*
changes that make such a link. Fine. OK. I can live with it. But on purely
logical grounds, *based on what is actually SAID in FF&S*, the statement that
USL hulls cannot enter an atmosphere is obviously untenable. *Completely*
untenable.

Even the smart alec argument of the last digest to the effect that, so it was
implied, I was an idiot and had not even read FF&S, because it was obvious
that the lack of control a USL ship would have over thrust even on cg-lifters
would be enough to bring disaster is not valid *at all*. If a ship *with no
avionics at all* can do 40 kph in NOE, there seems no obvious (or possible)
justification for saying that a USL ship with cg lifters would lack such
control!!! This may be against everything that the designers intended, and it
seems fairly obvious that it is, but so what? *They* left the loophole, *I\'m*
just pointing it out.

(NB - This is a perfect example of my comment that it is a *bad thing* to do
what FF&S and MTrav did with Starship design {or *anything* design} - and use
real world values and attempt logical explanations. We are not talking about
"real worlcd" science in Traveller, so attempting to give real world type
explanations of how it works is going to inevitably lead to just these sorts
of problems. It\'s simpler to say simply that, cg lifters or thruster plates,
USL ships simply can\'t re-enter atmospheres. I could buy that. But give the
detail MTrav and FF&S does, and I\'ll rip the guts out of any inconsistency.

2) FF&S, pg. #75, Chapter #10: Lifters / Contra Grav = It is noted here that
CG lifters are the standard for the TNE "Imperial Space" campaign, and thus,
it is implied, not relevant to USL craft. However, note that it points that
they are used by grav vehicles! And, right from way back, air rafts (forex)
have always been listed as being capable of making orbit! And they are not all
aerofoils!

It also notes how CG lifters work - and there is no indication that they have
any stability problems. There is, in fact, a note that they can allow vessels
to float in dense atmsopheres! Even with what I regard as non-canon newcomers
in the way of HePlaR drive, there is (when noting the information re NOE speed
above) no way that you can *not* allow USL craft to re-enter at low speeds
quite safely.

3) As for the "hard science" justification of all this, well I commend to you
the quite reasonable "Torch of Honor" by Roger Macbride Allen (reprinted in
"Allies and Enemies", Baen PB, June 95) where he explains how such a thing
could be achieved with even "harder" science than Traveller.

As a final note ... I may have weird ideas, but never assume that I don\'t
know the rules that I\'m talking about. I really object to people who obviously
haven\'t bothered to read everything that I said commenting on it and talking
down to me as if I am their idiot brother when it is obvious that *they* have
not read fully what the rules actually say. Not what they *wish* they would
say, or what they would *like* them to say, but what they *actually* say. In
this case, it\'s obvious that *logically*, *based on what we are told in FF&S*
there is *NO REASON* why USL ships cannot have cg lifters and why they cannot
re-enter atmospheres.

As an exercise in logic, consider this. We have a USL vessel, built in orbit,
with 6G Maneuver drives. Are you seriously telling me that it is going to be
less structurally sound than one built on a planetary surface? The forces
acting on it when it makes those 6G burns (if using HePlaR) in space are going
to be the same! We are not talking about stupid ion drive ships where such a
factor is important. We are talking about *real spaceships* here.

Even a ship capable of only 1G burns has to be constructed to higher tolerances
because under some circumstances to vector changes (say in a slingshot around
a planet or gas giant - or even the sun) may be greater than 1G. Tidal stresses
also need to be taken into account in some areas, I suspect.

You might also note, if you bothered to read FF&S, that all hulls are (to start
with) constructed from 1cm thick hull plates (yep, see pg. #12, Hull Form &
Configuration, under MVM note ... "volume of 1cm thick hull plating for a hull
of corresponding mass and configuration"). You might also note that this table
points out *quite* specifically that an airframe hull types increase the hull
*shell* material volume for a given hull type, but *not* the *INTERNAL
STRUCTURE*. Also note that the MVM note specifically states that the volume
indicated is to determine a hull internal structure stressed to 1G! Get your
facts right.

Seriously, if the USL ship can make 6G then it can certainly land at low speeds
on a 1G standard imperial sort of planet. *That\'s* an "exercise in logic". And,
yes, I *had* thought through all of your objections ... better than you have,
so it seems. I would suggest that if you\'re going to be a smart alec that you
at least get some semblance of logic working for you.

> As for the rest of your analysis, mildly interesting, but irrelevant.

As for your comments, it would have been nice if you\'d actually *read* the
relevant sections of FF&S before putting pen to paper, or foot in mouth. (I
apologise to some degree here, the guy with the smart alec comments yesterday
really annoyed me and you\'re getting his share of the blast as well).

Look, believe anything you want ... discount what it says in FF&S if it is
contradictory to what you want. Doesn\'t worry me! But do *not* assume that
I have written some ill thought through garbage ... the facts are there, and
they support my position, not yours! Sorry.

I have to admit, I prefer the relative simplicity of the MegaTraveller
starship construction rules to Fire, Fusion and Steel.  Why not have a
sub-set of construction rules in the base Traveller 4th edition set?
Leave out the high-end weaponary and defense systems, essentially make
it possible to design scout and merchant starships and grav vehicles
with the basic rules and leave strike cruisers, battleships, grav
tanks and fusion guns to a separate supplement.

And I agree, plenty of pre-designed equipment is essential.  There
should also be price lists for standard items as well (How much is a
meal, a standard set of clothes, a trained pet and so on).

> - Good world-gen rules.  World Builders Handbook, with the colonization stuff
> from World Tamers, integrated into an expanded CT trade goods ruleset.

Something I\'ve always found a bit irksom with the system generation
rules was the fact that all orbits have pre-defined radii.  For
instance, all planets in the 6th orbit are 5.2 AUs away from their
star.  I\'d like to see something that allows the orbits of planets and
belts in AUs instead of orbits, or at the very least allow for
fractional orbits (Fixed orbits are a little too neat and tidy for
me, I suppose).

While I think adventures are good, I think more focus should go on
reference material.  I\'m not saying don\'t do adventures, just that
it\'s more useful to have material to create adventures from.

Let\'s take the Annic Nova as an example.  If it were a supplement and
sufficient detail about the ship and the race that crewed it were
available, multiple types of scenarios could be created, i.e. First
contact, salvage, diplomacy and who knows what else.  Instead, as an
adventure, the referee is strongly encouraged to use it solely as a
mystery/salvage operation--Not terribly useful if that group enjoys
political intrigue or combat.

(Hmm, interesting side tought:  Could the race that built the Annic
Nova be the same people responsible for the Empress Wave?  Inquiring
minds would like to know....)

   You mean you can\'t see the plot possibilities as a party of player

Uhm no.  That\'s not what sparked this discussion.  Please recall, if
you will that you said to do away with TNE.  Afterwards you said to
just give it low priority which would achieve the same effects as no
support.  I have been paying attention.  Please check the archives if
you must to make sure that we\'re talking about the same thing.

Oh god no!  Do you have any idea what the gaming market is like right
now.  From your post it would seem not!  Your rationalization is so
way off it\'s ridiculous.  First, if you really think that TNE was the
only reason GDW went under, then you\'re absolutely crazy.  Look at the
gaming market.  In the past month, one major player (GDW) has gone
completely out of business, another has cut their entire line of RPG\'s
(Wizards of the Coast), another company which is relatively successful
(White Wolf) laid-off a bunch of people, others are selling off rights
to some previously popular games, smaller companies have had to revise
their entire release schedule and pare it down (BTRC, Grey Ghost, even
WEG), and still others have gone on hiatus until this trend dies.  And
then there are still the slew of distributors that are going out of
business weekly and defaulting on what they owe the gaming companies.

Or how about rising paper and printing costs?  Just last week Omni
magazine announced that it will have to suspend publishing in a paper
format for the time being.  Look at comic books.  2.95 to 4.95 per?
Hell, I still remember the great debate about raising them to 65
cents!

As for my impractical "let\'s support everything" attitude, please
realize it\'s only based on the trends in the gaming market and not
what I feel.  That\'s the difference between your argument and mine.
Think I\'m wrong, look at what\'s selling and what\'s not.

better than what GDW did. You THEN said give it zero priority support
which in effect is similar to no support.  I then said, give it a
fighting chance with at least one sourcebook and see how it does.  You
then said that this is silly because even though you obviously have no
grasp of business markets that this would stretch resources that we
have no idea about.  I then said that you need to pick up a textbook

I\'m not upset that you\'re standing by CT.  I\'m missing what you\'re
trying to say with your second sentence, so I\'ll take a guess.  You\'re
telling me that you find it hypocritical that I didn\'t say release
more than TNE stuff.  Man where the hell have you been.  I argued for
that stuff years ago!  Do you know what the answer that I got was?  Of
course you do.  GDW said to me "No".  We don\'t plan to, we don\'t
appreciate you arguing with us about our position on the matter, etc.
So when did I become a hypocrite, before or after you started paying
attention to what I post?

:  will be dead with the initial rulebook.  Why?  There is one hell of a

:  of them while they all have that space opera feel to them.  Go to a
:  gaming shop and ask people why they would rather spend their money on
:  these products than anything that ever carried the Traveller moniker.
: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: If it\'s not "reminescent" of earlier versions then it won\'t be "Traveller"

: call a desire to support Traveller? The stigmata that Trav carries is
: carried by the name. Stores will be reluctant to carry it no matter what.

: tried it, twice, & it failed both times. I said I wanted "Traveller",
: not something "that has nothing in common" with it but the name. It may
: as well just be dead it that case.

I didn\'t say that this was my position.  No where in the above do I
attribute this as my plan for Traveller.  Phil, stop confusing facts
about the Real World (tm) with what I personally believe.  When I tell
you something is my opinion, you will see words like "I think, I
believe, it appears to me, etc..."  Plain and simple, what I said is
look at what sells, look at what shop owners and distributors believe,
look at what people are and aren\'t buying.

I agree with you that I want Traveller.  Which rules?  Doesn\'t matter.
If I prefer one set of mechanics over another, I\'ll use them.  If I
want to use GURPS or FUDGE, I\'ll use it.  Do I still want the basic
system to look and feel like Traveller?  Hell yes!  Do I think that
the original black books should be reprinted verbatim?  Hell no!  Do I
think that there is a good middle ground of CT/MT that can be molded
and massaged (until the bugs and typos are gone)?  Definitely.  Do I
think that it will sell?  Not in today\'s market.  Maybe in a year or
two, but not until CCG\'s die and RPG\'s start to have an upswing.

:  The fact is that your version of Traveller will only appease those of
:  us (and yes, I am part of that us) that GDW angered and left high and
:  dry.  We are not enough of a market to support Traveller.  Players
:  today are looking for different things in their games.  Look at AD&D
:  with it\'s multiple game worlds and settings.  Look at all the
:  "Universal Systems" out there.  Gamers nowadays don\'t want to be
:  locked in to anything in specific.  They want generality.  They want a
:  sourcebook a month.  They want variability.  Plain and simple.  Your
:  vision of Traveller does not give them that.
: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: You statement about "not enough of a market", is just speculation.
: All we know for sure is that CT had enough of a market while MT had
: less & TNE didn\'t for sure. Which one sounds to you like it has the best

: to happen. You must think MM is independently wealthy or somesuch.
: Forget it. It\'s never going to happen. We\'ll be lucky to see one era
: supported adequately & that doesn\'t mean a sourcebook a month. Maybe
: every 6 months. Maybe.

Oh pardon my speculation.  I only based it on what sales figures look
like.  I also based it on the diminishing RPG market.  Man, I should
really stop doing my research because it seems that it\'s just not
sitting well with you.  A sourcebook a month.  That sounds funny to
you.  Well, let\'s see.  How many people complained about how slowly
things came out for TNE?  The problem is that gamers want their game
to be supported.  You think I\'m being silly.  Fine, I won\'t even
bother to tell you how many people blindly pick up supplements that
have their game\'s logo on them.  Don\'t let us, the discerning few,
stop the automotons that actually support the RPG market.  Players,
want consistent, timely, and (usually/hopefully) well-written
supplements.

As for MM.  As I said before he said that he is looking for a
publisher to release the game.  That means that the publisher will be
paying for this stuff to be released, not MM.  Will MM need to front
some capital and pay writers/artists/etc?  Probably.  But the
specifics of the deal are left of to MM and publisher.  No where did I
mention nor do I believe that MM should do this out-of-pocket.

: You want financial logistics.  Fine here goes.  MM needs to create the
: games and find a publisher for them.  He will not be producing them
: himself.  At least that\'s what he\'s said.  So, whoever is going to
: publish them is going to have to be willing to support them.  All the
: material for the new version does not need to come from MM.  Remember
: the heyday of Traveller when great companies made great supplements
: for the game?  That\'s a very viable solution to this problem.
: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: With the "stigmata", as you put it, that Trav carries I don\'t see this
: happening except on a limited shoestring basis. Too much risk. Remember
: what DGP said about producing license work before they dumped MT? It
: was a mistake all right but such reasoning isn\'t uncommon. And then you
: still have the "trashy license productions" syndrome that has been re-
: cently been posted in this thread. That\'s yet another stigmata.

Did you like DGP\'s work?  Why does Paranoia Press\' Traveller stuff get
such rave reviews?  I think that licensing could work quite well.  It
has before for Traveller.  There are many ways, from a clause that
allows MM to refuse to allow a product to be released to forced
rewrites, etc.  It all boils down to not allowing crap to be released
(and when did anyone find any DGP products crappy?).

: You need to drop your grandiose dreams of a resurgent Traveller that
: will exceed even it\'s own Golden Years. It\'s not gonna\' happen. The
: time for that is long past. GDW tried your "new markets" scheme twice
: & it failed, twice. This strategy will only bury it for good. Traveller
: needs to go back to what worked for it previosly & then build from there.
: Otherwise it may just as well be, "Traveller - AD&D", "Traveller - The
: Clans", or something else that wouldn\'t be Traveller at all.

It\'s not my new market scheme.  While Traveller - The Clans sounds
like a nice idea (trust me, I\'m being sarcastic), I don\'t think that
will happen.  My ideas aren\'t to recreate the game from scratch.  Nor
are they to try to appease people who played the game 20 years ago.
There is a middle ground.  You just refuse to accept it.  You won\'t
even acknowledge anything I\'m saying.  GDW forced a major revision
with no questions asked, no quarter (or support) given for what they
just revised.  That\'s the last thing I\'m proposing.  And that\'s the
basis of our debate.  You\'re saying screw everyone but the CT players
and I\'m saying that that isn\'t a viable answer in today\'s gaming
market.  You mistake words like "today" as meaning "produce crappy
systems, that are internally inconsistent."  When I say today, I mean
produce a Traveller for today\'s market.  What does that mean?  Quite
simply you will need to provide source material that people are
looking for.  Does this mean we can\'s use CT/MT based rules?  Of
course not.  Go to those rules, publish them.  But make sure you pay
attention to what the trends are.  Like I said enough of us have so
much Traveller stuff we don\'t really need more.  Especially if all it
is just a reprint of what we\'ve already got (which in essense is what
you\'re suggesting).  Like I said, we need to feed everyone, not just
the privileged few.

If I am just going to make it up on my own, then why do I need the rules at
all? Its kinda catch 22.  Regardless, the whole point here is that with CT,
I had a simple ship building method and I had an optional more advanced
method.  With MT, they only gave you an advanced method and TNE is the same.
At least with MT, ship building was still in the Core Rules.  With TNE you
have to have a seperate supplement to just build ships.

I have to disagree here.  While I agree that non-streamlined ships can
do this, I disagree that "USL" ships can do this.  There is actually a
diffenence although it\'s subtle.  I have assumed that by virtue of
designing an Unstreamlined Hull you are saying that the craft is
incapable of operating in an atmosphere by definition.  A SL hull might
look exactly the same as a given USL hull, it is just braced for
operations in an atmosphere.  I would say that the SLing is less wind
tunnel stuff than it is bracing (the internal structure is only bracing
along the thrust axis and doesn\'t count for this).

This works with the canon, and still allows zepellin type ships if you
wish, you just pay the extra CRs for "streamlining."  All you need to
clear up is the definition:  "Streamlined (SL) hulls are those braced
for operations in significant gravity wells, or that require bracing for
g-loads off the thrust axis."  and, "Airframe (AF) hulls are hulls that
meet the requirements for SL hulls, but which also either generate lifting
force with their hulls (or wings) and/or are capable of X relative
velocity through an atmosphere."

Sorry, but I don\'t have FFS in front of me to make the AF definition
clearer.

I don\'t allow CG on USL hulls since they aren\'t braced for the loads.
That\'s my few credits worth, anyway.

Rob,

There was a :-) in there, no?  I meant that you could just use published
designs.  I was not really serious, hence the smiley.

Any small arms design will be complicated, I made Striker
vehicles a long time ago, and they were as hard (in memory) as FFS
designs.  Ships are indeed easier in HG, but not that much once you
figure out the order to do things in (which is a major problem with FFS
IMHO).

Mdrive, Jdrive, CG, Fuel, and Life Support are all simple volume based
numbers just like HG (well, the LS/CG is subsumed in the hull I guess).

PP is an iteritive thing, but it kinda was in HG as well since you can\'t
put in the PP til you know what you\'re powering :-)

Anyway, it isn\'t all that bad, it just isn\'t well organized.

Returning to CT, which admittedly I don\'t really know anything about,

system that had its "Golden Age" because, from what I can gather, it

TNE is the "Bronze Age," if I am to believe what is going on.
Recapturing the "glories" of the past just doesn\'t seem to make it,
IMHO.

The system *is* going to change, the background isn\'t.  Unless MM
lets everyone know just what is going to be included in Trav4, which

Exactly!  Thats the point I have been trying to make.  Produce core rules
that are KISS based (Keep It Simple Silly), and provide more detailed rules
on various aspects of the game.  How would TNE have been accepted if the
only section on world building would have been a "World Builders Handbook"
that was a supplement, and the only description of published UWP\'s were a
micro-print strung together series of one line descriptions (see TNE pg 366
StarShip listings for the little intro at the top of the Scout/Courier page
for an example that is equipment related) like they did for StarShips in TNE.

Instead of an FF&S Lite, I would just like some simple tables for common items.

      Jump  100 Ton      200 Ton       400 Ton
TL12   1    5 tons/23mcr 10 tons/46mcr 20 tons/92mcr
TL13   1    4 tons/15mcr 8 tons/30mcr  16 tons/60mcr

Ok that 400 ton J2,M2 ship costs blah blah blah Mcr.

Just another RL example.  I lost my outdrive on my boat.  Instead of coming
up with a complex specification for the outdrive, I went and ordered a
"Lower Unit for a MerCruiser 165".  The dude at the Marina said "Ok, that
will be $1500 bucks".

In Traveller terms, I cant go to TNE (and somewhat so with MT) and say to
the players "Ok that Pirate took out your Jump Drive, you need Xmcr to fix
it" without doing work that will typically break the flow of the adventure.
Nothing hurts a role playing session more than the GM stopping to spend 5
minutes looking up a rule or a spell or whatever.  Mean while the players
start talking about other things, and then it takes a while to get the game
going again.

The way I see it, we are all pretty much in the same boat:

     We want to maximize our investment in old Traveller Stuff
     We want a rule system that is simple but extensable (i.e. simple core,
        complex supplements)
     We want more background stuff

Thanks for the advice.  I did analyze the tables (last night, so forgive me
if the math is incorrect:)) and in the Wilds, any ship encountered with the
exception of a Naval Type ship has a 1 in 6 (16.67%) chance of being a Virus
ship.  a Naval Type ship has a 5.7 in 6 (95.00%) chance of being a Virus
ship.  This by itself would put an end to the "Virus Is Rare" theory I
posted, but consider two other points:

1.  The chance of having an encounter in the wilds is so slim that that
negates the fact that the chance for an encounter being a Virus is common.
I think it works out to be 1 in 60 chance of having an encounter AND the
ship encountered bieing a Virus ship.  Even if you follow the rules to the
letter (see number 2 below) that is only a chance of 1 in 10 systems.  If
players jumped into every system in a subsector and either
                a) refueled at a Gas Giant only,
                b) landed on a world only, or
                c) docked with an orbital facility
they would encounter Virus ships only 3 times (assuming an average subsector
has 30 worlds).  This means only 48 systems in a sector will have a Virus
ship encounter.  By my count there would be fewer than 1000 Virus ship
encounters in the whole of the Imperial wilds.

2.  The rules for starship encounters specifically states that "These
starship encounter tables are an aid to the referee\'s imagination." (TNE,
pg.228)  The above numbers are an estimate if you follow the rules to the
letter (ie, roll a ship encounter at every pass).  If your referee
imagination sticks with the guidelines in the description of virus, then "it
is uncommon to find active strains of it [Virus] anywhere." (TNE, pg.97)

I still stand by my opinion that Virus is rare.  Virus will be more abundant
around the RC because of the Vampire Highway, but I still don\'t think it is
a major threat anymore.  (I would agree, though, that TNE is a post holocost
era.)
I\'m not trying to say that Virus is dead, and that you CANNOT have it in
your campaign, I\'m just saying that it is common to enter the Wilds and
never encounter Virus.

All of the above percentages above are based on the TNE main rules book.  If
there are other ship encounter tables for TNE and Virus, I would like to know.

(P.S. - The TNE Rulebook may contradict itself about Virus.  Page 97 states
that "surviving Virus is most common in the Wilds."  I interpret this to
mean most commonly encountered in the Wilds, but that is not supported by
the Starship encounter tables on page 228.  The encounter tables give a
higher probability of virus being encountered in the RC & Pocket Empires.)

This is what I thought of. (If this is an impossibility because of CT/MT
cannon, forgive me as I didn\'t "get on the bandwagon" until late MT and TNE.)

The Zhodani core expiditions were getting too close to Grandfather, so he
hit them where it would hurt, the glue of their civilization.  When the
Ancient\'s War was over, Grandfather retired to the clean environment of the
core(compared to the devastated area of known space).  There, with
specimines of all the major and minor races he could collect as well as many
animal specimines, he continued his genetic experimentation until he saw
(heard, sensed, whatever) the Zhodani\'s coming coreward, and getting rather
close to some of his experiments.

At this point my idea has changed with what I thought originally.
Originally, I thought He would design a Zhodani specific weapon, but further
thought (And Rob\'s post) led me to believe that He wouldn\'t spare the time
to make the weapon that specific.  He would have designed a weapon that
disables psionic powers.  We don\'t know what is behind the wave nor do we
know how long the wave will last.  My guess is that it will last only
seconds, but the effects will be permanent.  I think it will disable all
psions by destroying the portion of the brain that allow psionics.  This
would not alter the Zhodani genetic code and therefore not altering the
ability to give birth to psionic Zhodani children; in essence the effects
would only last one generation.

The fighting observed in the coreward sectors of the Zhodani consulate is
fighting over the one thing that will save a psion -- a psionic shield.  The
very nature of Zhodani society leads me to believe that psionic shields
would be illegal items and only high nobles would own one.  The last of the
Zhodani core expiditions (I think its seven or eight) jumped into a system
shortly before the Wave hit.  One of the Nobles had brought along his
Psi-shield and was showing it to his pals when the wave hit.  He was the
only one left with any psionic powers after the wave passed.  This knowledge
was quickly (as quickly as possible) carried back through the wave to the
Consulate.  The effects of the wave were leaked out (how many government
secrets can you keep in a psionic society) and the infighting started over
the few available psi-shields.  As the wave closes in on an area the
fighting gets more fierce.

Closer examination of the ships logs showed that the passive EMS sensors
were blacked out during the wave passage.  This would explain why the
Longbow coreward stations were not responding.  They were blacked out during
the Wave passage and the signal couldn\'t penetrate the wave to get back to
the Regency.

The Exodus is an effort by Nobles to gain access to Psi-shields in the
Regency without having to fight other Nobles for the shield when the wave
got closer.

Note: Unborn children couldnot be shielded, and therefore would be effected
by the wave.

If this violates Cannon let me know.

Don\'t you mean Attribute/5, Rob?

Remember MT Tasks

Success: 2d + Skill Level +(Att/5)
Time:   {3d - [Skill Level + (att/5)]} * TimeIncrement

Success targets of 3+/7+/11+/15+/19+ for the five difficulty levels.
Hasty: halve final time, increase difficulty +1 level (Effectively a DM-4)
Cautious: Double Final Time, decrease difficulty -1 level (Effectively a DM+4)

Yes, thogh it  needed 5d6, it worked. My personal preference was to use the
D10 & 3d6 system from 2300 (It works identically, but you use a d10 rather
than 2d6 on the success check.)

TNE Tends to confuse even some veteran (15+ year) math-phobic gamers;
everyone in my group currently relies on calculators or pre-figured
difficulties. (I\'m currently at 360-1082, and they\'re in vland about to
cross the rift.)

The players like the CGen, but most are neutral about the task system (TNE
is simpler, but not as easy on players.) We had to switch to D10\'s for
damage, as TNE isn\'t lethal unless you do.

   They are specifically referring to spacecraft that can enter an

-   No, what is plain is that if a vehicle or vessel with no NOE avionics
is limited to 40 kph, for they go any faster, they will go out of control and
crash.

   Ergo one of your basic premises is shot down and your conclusion
false.

   Of course not.  On the other hand, to do what you want to do, you will
have to take into account:

   The speed of rotation of the planet at the point you wish to enter the
atmosphere, the speed of the atmosphere itself, any atmospheric
turbulence--including so-called ``jet streams``, ability of certain external
devices such as antennas to withstand the additional stress placed on
them by friction--something you don\'t have to account for in space,
electrical or magnetic disturbances that may effect critical components--
can you say ``giant lightning rod``?, heating of certain surfaces
regardless of how slow you ooze into the atmosphere, the effects the
additional atmospheric pressure will have on certain areas of the ship,
and well anyway you get the idea.

   I did read the relevant sections, and stand by what the rules say.
If you want to allow unstreamlined ships to sink into the atmosphere, go
ahead--I\'m not the Traveller Orthodoxy Police.  Besides, I don\'t think the
U.S. - Australia extradiction treaty covers trivial disagreements over
currently out-of-print science-fiction role playing games.

   Lighten up.  Smile, it\'s summer where you live while I\'m current stuck

I like this.  Most of Transstar\'s intrests lie in the RC, so the OBD
would be a small operation, probably underfunded, operating on a
shoestring.  That way the players wouldn\'t have tons of support, and
would be on their own at times.
If you want to write up something on the OBD that would be cool. If you
don\'t I\'ll write up something, but it will be after a few other things.

 Muir wrote about an adventure Seed for the  OBD.
This was pretty good.  Another twist would be to have the RCES come in
on a smash and grap, and actually grab the thing that the players were
negotiating for. Preferably after they had paid off the TED, but before
they loaded the goods into their ship.  The players would have to
decide whether to fight the RC in court, attack the ship in orbit which
just launched the SAG, or to just give up and go home.  Yeah right, how
many players will just give up. :)

I was reading Hard Times last night, some of the adventures in there
could fit in nicely with Transstar and the OBD.  The first adventure
has the players recovering some manufacturing equipment for an
abandoned factory.  Another has them dealing with workers who resent
Hortz de Cie taking over their jobs.  With a few name changes and bit
of fiddling they could easily be New Era adventures.

  Having Transstar deal with TEDs, raises all sorts of questions.  I
don\'t think Transstar would sell weapons to TEDs this would run
contrary to RC intrests.  But if they sold machine tools, these could
be used to make weapons, so its a pretty grey area.  I like playing in
the grey areas, there are all sorts of role playing possiblities.

  An idea that popped into my head was to have a corporation actually
buy a planet in the wilds.  They could offer a TED 100Mcr and a villa
on Aubaine in exchange for the entire planet.  They would set up a
puppet government, or maybe just rule it themselves.  They could then
structure the laws for maximum profits.  They could allow merchants to
sell salvaged items, without taking the 50% cut that the RC does at its
official auctions.  RC wouldn\'t be too happy about this, might send in
a decapitation strike.  Of course the natives might not like being
bought and sold, and try to revolt.  On the other hand they might like
the new influx of technology and money.  The planet would have plenty
of oppurtunities for player involvment.
 This doesn\'t really sound like something Transstar would do, but
another company might.

I agree.  Looking through Path of Tears, and Star Vikings I saw a few
minor comments about corporations, such as Kruytercorp, Trybecorp and
the various shipyards.  But nothing else, that is one reason I wrote up
Transstar. We need more corporations, but I\'ll leave that up to someone
else for now.

I came up with an idea for the Transstar logo. A large blue T outlined
in silver on a starscape.  There is a stereotypical rocket ship on the
upright part of the T, with a smoke trail swooshing around the T.  (I
don\'t know if that really conveys the idea or not.)  Transstar ship
crews and cargo handlers wear jackets with this embroidered on the
right breast.  Its also emblazoned on the back. The logo  is also
painted on the outside of the ships, big and bright so everyone can
see.  The company colors are red and blue.

   Brilliant Lances.  It also uses pregenerated weapons, which cuts
down significantly on your design time.

>I can find no design sequences for vehicals except those in FF&S.

   True, there is no vehicle counterpart to Brilliant Lances, perhaps there
should have been.  On the other hand there was no vehicle design
system that was the counterpart to High Guard in the CT era--you used
Striker or you were out of luck.

The Jump drive table is pretty clear.  Given the choice between a page
of premade weapons or sensors and a page that has a table to calculate
2% of hull (then various hull sizes)
3% of hull ("")
etc., I\'d take the former.  The latter would take about a half an hour
for all TLs (I can post one after I get home to FFS if you wish).

I know you mean for more than that example, but it really isn\'t any
different than the HG system.  Besides, FFS Light would have the
eqivilent drives to the Book 2 stuff :-)

Hmmm, when my car stops running I have no isdea what it costs to fix til
I either look at it (more than 5 minutes) or have it looked at (much
more than 5 minutes).  My point is that they\'d need to take time to
assertain the damage, and while they\'re doing it you do
0.03*200*MCr(from table)=cost, not too hard (*much* worse for a PEMS,
though :)

One idea would be to keep the design document for any PC ship, then
you\'d know all the subcosts all the time.

I see your point, but given limited pages being made I\'d rather get the
rules to make a widget consistant with the universe (crucial point) than
a small list of widgets.  Preferably I\'d like both, though.

Hi fellow 2300ADers. Here\'s something I saved from a long time ago which
I found in rec.arts.sf.science.

Thought some may find it interesting, even if you don\'t live at Libreville.

I did a lot of calculations about this a few years back; here are
some results that might interest you.  Here\'s the apparent strength
of gravity as you go up the elevator, allowing for both the earth\'s
rotation and the 1/r^2 field:

    0 km9.8 m/s^2 2500 km5.0 m/s^2
  350 km9.0 m/s^2 3400 km4.0 m/s^2
  700 km8.0 m/s^2 7500 km2.0 m/s^2
 1200 km7.0 m/s^210500 km1.0 m/s^2
 1750 km6.0 m/s^218500 km0.5 m/s^2

Weightlessness comes at the Clarke point, of course, 35950 km up.
Above that, there is a centrifugal effect, and the earth appears to
be \'above\' you----but you would have to be nearly 200,000 km up before
the apparent gravity reaches -1.0 m/s^2.  In practice, no one would
build it out that far; you just want to go far enough to keep the
center of gravity at the Clarke point, plus a bit more to put the
lower end of the elevator in tension.  A big mass just slightly
above synchronous orbit is probably the way to go.

Midway Station, the lowest point where you go into an elliptical orbit
instead of hitting the ground if you jump off, is 23450 km up, and has
a tiny apparent gravity of 0.29 m/s^2.  The total energy cost from
ground to the Clarke point is just over 13 kW-hr per kg lifted, which
means $100 a ticket at today\'s energy prices, minus savings for energy
generated by the \'down\' cars, plus (rather large) financing charges on
the capital investment.

Next come strength-of-materials considerations.  We need a material
with the highest possible (breaking strength)/(density), which is a
tough sell, because Kevlar, good piano wire, and nearly everything
else has essentially the same optimum value for this parameter.  They
all have breaking strengths of a \'few\' billion Pa, and a density of
a \'few\' thousand kg/m^3, where \'few\' is the same number in both cases.
The strongest high-tensile materials are the heaviest, by and large.
Exotic materials like spun sapphire or diamond do better on the micron
scale, and buckytubes get close to the theoretical limit (the strength
of the chemical bonds themselves).  In principle, such materials
should be anywhere from 40 to 120 times stronger than the optimal
value above, which I shall call \'1x piano wire\'.  But Griffith theory
teaches us that the length of the \'critical\' crack (one that releases
enough energy to drive its own spontaneous propagation) goes down as
1/(stress)^2.  So even if exotic materials can be machined in gigaton
lots, we may find that they are unusable at the huge stresses we
need.  The first woodpecker that comes along may bring the whole
thing down if the critical crack is a few microns long.

But let\'s assume we can cope with this issue, if necessary with
nanobot inspectors checking for micro-cracks, or simply a sheath of
unstressed material around the structural members.  The tension is
essentially zero at the bottom:  if we wanted we could leave the
cable hanging loose a foot from the ground.  (We want _some_ tension
there, of course, when we build an actual elevator, or the dynamic
oscillations will kill us.)  At the Clarke point, where the stress
is largest, the stress depends on the weight of the tower below,
which depends on the strength of the material.  It\'s like rocketry,
ironically enough:  the \'fuel\' for the upper stages is \'payload\' cost
for the lower ones.  In this case, of course, it\'s upside-down:  we
have to keep the _lower_ part of the tower as light as we dare, so
that the _upper_ part doesn\'t have to be exponentially heavy.  And a
high-tensile steel tower, like a rocket powered by Wisconsin butter
(happy now, Senator Proxmire?), just doesn\'t have enough juice.

Assuming each wire has to take a thousand tonnes of tension at the
bottom (add wires as needed, depending on what you want to send up
the tower...), we get a minimum thickness profile like this:

strength/density5000 km    10000 km    Midway    Clarke orbit

 6x piano wire      r = 16 cm      34 cm      72 cm       86 cm
 7x   9 cm      21 cm      36 cm       39 cm
 8x   8 cm      14 cm      22 cm       24 cm
10x   4 cm       8 cm      11 cm       12 cm
15x   2 cm       3 cm       4 cm        4 cm

These have _no_ margin for error, so in reality you would need a
material 20 or 30 times stronger than the best steel wire before you
could even think about the 6x scenario.  And the figure I used for
\'ordinary\' piano wire is itself way out at the bleeding edge of
1990s metallurgy; we can\'t produce such wire in suspension-bridge
lots yet.  The 6x version is already at the point of exponentially
diminishing returns:  we need a 5-foot-thick steel cable at the top
to run a two-inch cable to ground.  For 1x piano wire, a cable
*fifty* feet in radius will carry a thousand tonnes only down to
about 11000 km, and will have to taper to dental floss at 0 km.

In short, the prospects look pretty bleak:  we need a smaller planet,
or one with a faster rotation rate, in order to do this with any
known engineering materials.  The mass of my kT-load cable is 1.4 MT
for 15x, 2.9 MT for 10x, 8 MT for 8x, 25 MT for 7x, 95 MT for 6x,
580 MT for 5x, and over 500 GT (!) for 3x----that\'s right, lowering
the breaking strength from 5x to 3x multiplies the weight of cable
a thousandfold.  I don\'t even have the heart to calculate 1x; the
cable would weigh as much as a moon.  For real fantasy, at 100x, the
cable only weighs 6 kT, a few times its \'payload\', and we are finally
in the regime of conventional engineering, where supporting the
structure\'s own weight isn\'t the sole concern.

If we want the upper end of the elevator to sling payloads into deep
space, we need to run it up about 11000 km beyond the Clarke point,
but when you consider the cost of construction, it might be simpler
to just take a conventional rocket engine up the elevator in pieces,
and launch it from geosynchronous orbit.  Other arrangements are
possible:  Robert Forward has done some interesting calculations
involving \'skyhooks\' that don\'t quite touch the ground.  You get a
considerable advantage, because it\'s only the bottom thousand km
that are under anything like one gee.  Also, you avoid weather.  You
can land on the bottom platform of such a skyhook with a very
low-tech suborbital rocket----a V2 or a Scud-B gets that high.  Even
more interesting is the idea of lowering the platform from a
non-geosync orbit, thus greatly reducing the weight of cable, and
spinning the cable end-over-end at a speed that leaves the lower
end almost stationary each time it swings into the earth\'s atmosphere.
If the rotation period and the orbital period are commensurate with
each other and with 24 hours, you can have regularly scheduled pickup
points at fixed (ocean!) locations.  Many such solutions are within
reach of 2x or even 1x cable, but again you must allow a (5-fold?)
safety factor before you apply for a permit.

   What say we cut the level of pure bullsh_t around here folks?  You

        I didn\'t say it "counteracted the gravitational force" or nullified
the object\'s weight. I said it generated its own force. To simplify using
existing designs, I simply assumed that _my_ style generator had to be about
the same size as the canon generator to generate enough force to lift the
ships. That way I don\'t have to redesign every single ship and vehicle.

        If you\'ve got the "canon" generator, which creates a field which
nullifies 99% of the weight of _anything_ in the field, you\'ve got serious
problems.

        1. Just keep piling stuff in the field. No matter how much mass you
pile in there, it still draws the same energy. No conservation here.

        2. Put your asteroid in a close approach orbit to a star. As it
falls in it gets faster and faster, but slows back down the same amount as
it moves away from the star. But wait! I turn on my CG at the point of
closest approach -- now since 99% of the gravity is _not_ acting on me
anymore, I don\'t slow down! Free Energy! Pick my orbit right and I\'ll split
any planet in a bazillion pieces.

        3. Put on my grav belt, which generates a field around it. 99% of my
weight magically disappears. Stick my arm outside the field. Now everything
up to my elbow is only feeling 0.01G. Everything beyond my elbow is feeling
1G. *SNAP* *RIP* Now I don\'t have anything past my elbow.


        To repeat, I didn\'t say mine "nullified" gravity or change an
objects weight. It uses the input power to create a force, which acts upon
the generator and is then transmitted structurally to the rest of the ship,
just like a thruster. This force is simply in the direction of gravity. If I
put a small generator in my big ship, it only generates a small force not
enough to lift the ship. I just waved my hands and said that for existing
ships the designers had sized them to be able to generate enough force to
lift the ship. That way, I could use existing designs without having to
swallow the "magic field." And yes, I know, antigravity is just as magic as
"ContraGravity." But I can see it happening a little more easily.

One point I forgot to clarify in my previous post...

Obviously a 6g USL ship could use CG lifters to decend along the thrust
axis, rockets down.  Then the arguements about aerodynamics, etc. would
still apply, but there\'d be no reason the CG wouldn\'t work assuming you
have CG installed.

I also though of an example.  A 747 can pull g\'s (more positive than
negative (a point to note)), right?  So that means that it can stand on
one wingtip, right (assuming it was balanced to do so without falling
over)?  Wrong, it isn\'t stressed to do this.

Remember that FFS _adds_ streamlining sub-options compared to HG.  AF is
"Streamlined" from HG.  SL is "Partial Streamlining."  USL is
"Unstreamlined."  The addition is that an SL ship with CG may do
anything that an AF may do.  Since FFS is vague on this, it is open to
some interpritation.  I would say that we need to read it in such a way
that it matches the canon as closely as possible, not that it should be
read to the opposite effect.

Just my 2Crs again...

In my campaign, the Annic Nova is a hand-built Droyne starship from
somewhere like Candory or Andor. OK, so it was a long way to the
Regina subsector - the went the back way. ;-)

Yes, I know the thing has been declared non-canonical (the solar collector
cannot, apparently, collect enough energy to power the jump drives) but I
said "Why not?" After all, it takes the damn thing 2 weeks to power up -
that\'s a sufficient enough reason not to use the idea commercially, and
let it go at that.

After all, at one stage you could use the energy absorbed by a _black globe_
to power your jump drives - this was rated as non-canonical by none other than
MM himself. However, you can still allow this rule - it is YOUR game, after all.

This is also an important point for people who insist on canon vs non-canon
rules: _everyone_ I know has "house rules" for their game, no matter what system
they are playing (AD&D, Traveller, Cthulhu, GURPS, whatever). Reasonable GM\'s
realise that rules don\'t cover everthing, for example. In their game, they may
well ignore rules that other GM\'s insist are "the core of Traveller, it\'s just
not the same without it".

BTW, I *personally* don\'t like rules changes that alter the _background_, such
as giving ships of less than 100t the ability to jump, or realistic rules that
alter manoeverability from high tactical/low strategic to low tactical/higher
stategic, or _chrome_ "jump exit flashes" that people suddenly decide should be
visible to sensors. But always remember that this is just *my* opinion, and
others have no problem with some of these things.

Hmm, interesting comments.  Got me thinking about CG.  The assumption of
CG (anybody with better ideas jump on in :-) is that at TL9 (!) where it
appears one can control the gravitational force.  I guess CG allows
enough control to prevent the exchange of whatever particles
(gravitons (presumed)) moderate gravitation.  It basically makes a black
globe-like screen that flickers at 99% and only blocks gravitons (or
reflects them or something magic).

At TL10, we get AG.  AG allows the creation of such exchange particles
without having to have mass around to do, just some juice.  Wow.

Now the CG does, indeed, create some interesting problems.  A possible
solution that has the added bonus of making sense of the streamlining
issue is to change the assumption of the way CG works slightly.  What
you\'d do is not say that CG blocks 99% of all gravitons that come by,
but to actually say that CG blocks X gravitons for Y MWs.

Above X, Y blows up big time to the point of being impossible (as it
says in FFS).  The field is power for radius of effect (displacement),
just like CG in FFS.  You\'d have to add something like the
15*displacement rule for Mdrives----beyond such and such a ship mass, you
don\'t get as much negation (flux of gravitons having to do with the mass
of both ship and world).

What happens then is that you make a field that would block all the
exchange particles for worlds below a certain size (mass), and you\'d get
less and less benefit from CG as the size went above this.  The asteroid
problem Dave mentioned wouldn\'t happen, and CG wouldn\'t really help for
fuel skimming since gas giants are so massive.

This is, of course, all hand waving, and I was never a particle person,
but it seems to make more sense than FFS has CG.

 Uhm no.  That\'s not what sparked this discussion.  Please recall, if

Funny how you missed the context (as well as the "get back CT" part.
Well just to jog your memory try
to recall that I was illustrating my point by making a concession &
then demonstrating that it made no difference anyway. Guessed you mis-

TNE background altogether & moving it so far down the list that it gets
nothing anyway. Either way TNE gets nothing, so what\'s the difference?
So as I said; Go ahead & put TNE at the bottom of the list. I think it\'ll
get about as much support there as the DGP canon,(remember the \'Sparklers\'?)
that GDW chose to disregard, did.

 Oh god no!  Do you have any idea what the gaming market is like right
 now.  From your post it would seem not!  Your rationalization is so
 way off it\'s ridiculous.  First, if you really think that TNE was the
 only reason GDW went under, then you\'re absolutely crazy.  Look at the
 gaming market.  In the past month, one major player (GDW) has gone
 completely out of business, another has cut their entire line of RPG\'s
 (Wizards of the Coast), another company which is relatively successful
 (White Wolf) laid-off a bunch of people, others are selling off rights
 to some previously popular games, smaller companies have had to revise
 their entire release schedule and pare it down (BTRC, Grey Ghost, even
 WEG), and still others have gone on hiatus until this trend dies.  And
 then there are still the slew of distributors that are going out of
 business weekly and defaulting on what they owe the gaming companies.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All of which just makes your scheme even more impractical than when you
first presented it. Talk about "crazy". I guess you muct think that money
literally grows on trees & that MM just has to pick the \'leaves\' off to
get the capital to get Traveller going again.
=============================================

 Or how about rising paper and printing costs?  Just last week Omni
 magazine announced that it will have to suspend publishing in a paper
 format for the time being.  Look at comic books.  2.95 to 4.95 per?
 Hell, I still remember the great debate about raising them to 65
 cents!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Just more reasons why your grandiose scheme can\'t work. The new Traveller
will definitely have to be a limited operation. Anf that means that there
*won\'t* be enough to go around for everything that MM has proposed.
=====================================================================

 As for my impractical "let\'s support everything" attitude, please
 realize it\'s only based on the trends in the gaming market and not
 what I feel.  That\'s the difference between your argument and mine.
 Think I\'m wrong, look at what\'s selling and what\'s not.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sure let\'s look at TSR. Hey, let\'s be like them! Ooops! Where\'s all
the MONEY going to come from? Uh-oh.
=====================================

 I didn\'t miss so much of anything that you\'ve posted.  Please read
 what I said.  You said to away with TNE for good.  I said that\'s no
 better than what GDW did. You THEN said give it zero priority support
 which in effect is similar to no support.  I then said, give it a
 fighting chance with at least one sourcebook and see how it does.  You
 then said that this is silly because even though you obviously have no
 grasp of business markets that this would stretch resources that we
 have no idea about.  I then said that you need to pick up a textbook
 on economics and another on marketing.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You make the silly suggestions that you have & then accuse me of not
knowing any business concepts? Don\'t make me laugh. Spreading oneself
too thin with limited resources, as you propose, is one of the most
common business errors. You also don\'t seem to understand the idea
of "maximizing return" by concentrating on what sells the best.

 I\'m not upset that you\'re standing by CT.  I\'m missing what you\'re
 trying to say with your second sentence, so I\'ll take a guess.  You\'re
 telling me that you find it hypocritical that I didn\'t say release
 more than TNE stuff.  Man where the hell have you been.  I argued for
 that stuff years ago!  Do you know what the answer that I got was?  Of
 course you do.  GDW said to me "No".  We don\'t plan to, we don\'t
 appreciate you arguing with us about our position on the matter, etc.
 So when did I become a hypocrite, before or after you started paying
 attention to what I post?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So, was your protest to them as vociferous as the one you making to me?
Or do I only have to say what they said to get you to back down?
================================================================

 I didn\'t say that this was my position.  No where in the above do I
 attribute this as my plan for Traveller.  Phil, stop confusing facts
 about the Real World (tm) with what I personally believe.  When I tell
 you something is my opinion, you will see words like "I think, I
 believe, it appears to me, etc..."  Plain and simple, what I said is
 look at what sells, look at what shop owners and distributors believe,
 look at what people are and aren\'t buying.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go back and read the sentence "If Traveller comes out.........release".
You posted that didn\'t you? And now you say that you didn\'t really
mean it? It\'s not you position? Sounds to me like it\'s you who are getting
a little confused here. & changing your story to boot. The very same thing
you\'ve recently been accusing me of doing.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 I agree with you that I want Traveller.  Which rules?  Doesn\'t matter.
 If I prefer one set of mechanics over another, I\'ll use them.  If I
 want to use GURPS or FUDGE, I\'ll use it.  Do I still want the basic
 system to look and feel like Traveller?  Hell yes!  Do I think that
 the original black books should be reprinted verbatim?  Hell no!  Do I
 think that there is a good middle ground of CT/MT that can be molded
 and massaged (until the bugs and typos are gone)?  Definitely.  Do I
 think that it will sell?  Not in today\'s market.  Maybe in a year or
 two, but not until CCG\'s die and RPG\'s start to have an upswing.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I believe that Traveller has only one shot left. It\'ll be a bootstrap
operation & whatever comes out first will be what Traveller becomes.
If it comes out trying to pander to current fads, like TNE did, then
it won\'t matter to me whether it fails or not because it won\'t be Travel-
ler anymore, & I won\'t support it.
==================================

 GDW forced a major revision
 with no questions asked, no quarter (or support) given for what they
 just revised.  That\'s the last thing I\'m proposing.  And that\'s the
 basis of our debate.  You\'re saying screw everyone but the CT players
 and I\'m saying that that isn\'t a viable answer in today\'s gaming
 market.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TNE was a major mistake. Perpetuating that mistake is not the way
to preserve Traveller. The TNE people have already been screwed by
GDW. (Welcome to the club) That can\'t be undone.Right now *everything*
is dead. There\'s no way I can see that
it will ever be possible to revive it all. So, I propose that what
was successful should be what gets priority. And that\'s won\'t be TNE.
================================================================

  You mistake words like "today" as meaning "produce crappy
 systems, that are internally inconsistent."  When I say today, I mean
 produce a Traveller for today\'s market.  What does that mean?  Quite
 simply you will need to provide source material that people are
 looking for.  Does this mean we can\'s use CT/MT based rules?  Of
 course not.  Go to those rules, publish them.  But make sure you pay
 attention to what the trends are.  Like I said enough of us have so
 much Traveller stuff we don\'t really need more.  Especially if all it
 is just a reprint of what we\'ve already got (which in essense is what
 you\'re suggesting).  Like I said, we need to feed everyone, not just
 the privileged few.

       --Jerry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You keep bringing rules to discuss while I\'m talking about backgrounds.
The rules don\'t matter, IMO. The background is what made CT great & when
MT shredded it & TNE finished it off, Traveller(tm) went down the tubes
right along with it. TNE *was* "Trav. for today\'s market" & so was MT. Or
at least that\'s what GDW thought. Let\'s not make that mistake again. Put
Traveller back where it flourished. With the background that allowed it
to prosper. W/o squandering limited resources on backgrounds that have
already failed.

   What say we cut the level of pure bullsh_t around here folks?  You
hate TNE and everything it stood for, you\'ve made that abudantly clear
AD NAUSEAM--that doesn\'t mean that the TNE storyline deserves any
less support than any other aspect of the Traveller background.  This is
not an episode of ``Dallas``, Strephon will not be walking out of the
shower to let everyone know the Rebellion and the Collapse didn\'t
happen.  Perhaps if we all put as much effort in figuring out how to end
the story of the Post-Collapse Era as we did griping for this or that era,
Marc Miller would have a large sourcebook on the subject ready to
publish as soon as FarFuture Enterprises gets off the ground.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Face it Harold. TNE died not because I don\'t like it but because
it failed to generate the necessary support. So, as you said, cut
the bullsh*t & admit that you don\'t really care how little support
TNE garnered, you just want it because it\'s what you want. Nothing
wrong with that but don\'t expect me to agree to squander limited
resources on a scheme that\'s already failed. And, yes, it\'s failure
*does* mean it is entitled to less, quite a bit less.

I\'m a recent addition to Traveller, having only joined since the

MT task system as recently posted:

> Success: 2d + Skill Level +(Att/5)
> Success targets of 3+/7+/11+/15+/19+ for the five difficulty levels.

is awkward, cumbersome, and time consuming, where as the TNE system:

Skill Level + Attribute, double or halve (rounding down) until it just
exceeds the d20 roll to find level of success.  If you\'re interested
in criticals only then do you need to work out how much the dice roll
exceeds the level of success.

is faster and easier to understand, particularly to new players with
experience in other games.

I\'d rather see a new system based on TNE, than one based on the (roll
some dice, add some numbers, compare to (target with modifiers
applied)) that seems to be the MT system.

Look, it\'s obvious we disagree fundamentally on this. I am looking at the
logic of the situation and the logic is that there is no fundamental reason,
regardless of what is stated in some sections of the rules, why USL ships
cannot make a *slow* atmospheric re-entry. The systems provided in FF&S are
detailed enough to contradict the statements to the contrary. As you well
know, however, the 4mm Gauss Pistol cannot *logically* do 20d6 damage. There
is nothing anywhere in the rules that I can think of offhand that justifies
this. If you cannot see the difference between the two cases, then there
is obviously no point in continuing to discuss the matter as there is no
possible basis for any agreement on the matter.

Yep, but, again, so what? The rules elsewhere make it quite plain - see page
10 of FF&S - that there is no structural mass difference between a USL, SL,
and Aerofoil Hull. They all mass the same, their internal structure all
masses the same. All these structures are modified by the G Rating of the
(presumably) HePlaR engines in the same way. They can perform maneuvers that
will stress the hull in a variety of different ways that will make the simple
act of sitting on a planetary surface in a 1G gravity well seem completely
inconsequential. Given that there is no mass difference between the different
hull types, and that the hulls need bracing to meet the same maneuver elements,
then there seems little likelihood that the hull would be unable to stand up
to gently floating down on cg lifters at around 40 kph. We\'re not talking
high speed re-entry here.

Yes, but you deliberately ignore the point that they *can* make the 40 kph.
Given that the major problem in re-entry with USL vessels is *not* hull
structure or bracing (see above), then the only possible difference is going
to be in shaping the hull to reduce aerodynamic friction heating effects -
and the extra cost is almost certainly going to be in the form of special
materials to coat the hull to reduce these effects (like the tiles on the
space shuttle). Thus, as long as the vessel can make the 40 kph it can make
a controlled "re-entry" ... after all, if it can do NOE, it must be capable
of being controlled to as fine a degree as a re-entry would require of a
SL/Aerofoil hull vessel.

Well, sez you. I believe that I have shown why my premise is the case and
that you have failed to do so on any basis other than to say "the word of
the rules is law - even when contradicted by internal logic". Well, that\'s
what I see, anyway.

Hmm, yes, but with CG lifters these are much easier to control ... you have the
6G (or whatver) thrust you just don\'t use it to do more than a couple of
hundred kph *relative*. Especially if you install computerised controls - yep,
NOE computers on a USL vessel! That should provide the fine control needed -
after all, flying NOE at the high speeds possible in Traveller means that the
presence of much less forceful winds at NOE altitudes, and the ability to make
nanosecond implemented course corrections should make USL re-entries child\'s
play. In any case, consider that the USL vessel could be under ground approach
control and brought down to avoid the worst weather patterns ... and could
probably detect them from orbit in any case. Less flexible than SL and Aerofoil
vessels who can land without ground control and in all weathers, but, hey, it\'s
a cheap alternative.

Sure, but there is an implication that antennae etc. are built to be retract-
able regardless of streamlining or lack of it. There is a note that space and
jump-vessels need to have armour equal to 10 x G Rating to allow for hitting
micrometeors and other space garbage. Ergo, it is logical that Sensors would
need to be protected when relatively high density dust clouds (for the speed
of travel) and the like are being passed through ... in other words, they
need to be able to be retraced!

This seems quite ridiculous. You are not getting any significant friction
heating at 40 kph, or even at 140 kph, re-entry speeds. As for the effects
of atmospheric pressure. The hulls of all ships *and* their internal bracing
is specifically stated as being *identical* in mass - and given that their
performance in space is identical, you can reasonably presume that it must be
doing *something*. I would suspect that for all except Open Frame hulls that
the external armour would be more than enough to make the effects of any
normal atmospheric pressure irrelevant. In any case, aren\'t you missing
something obvious here? As long as you are re-entering a planet with a
breathable atmosphere, you are entering a planet where the external pressure
is the *same* as the internal pressure ... so, *what* "additional" pressure
are you waffling on about? Think it through!!!

OK, so you *might* be talking about gas giant refuelling. However, note that
the proposal was that the vessel simply float down to its natural bouyancy
level and then *pump in* rather than scoop in the gas. At this level, the
pressure is, I presume, not going to be much higher than 1 atmosphere? Any
engineering types out there who can say yea or nay? OK, at worst, it reduces

You still haven\'t read through FF&S or what I said. But, like I said, that
doesn\'t worry me. DO things any way you want - but the facts are, as I have
pointed out, quite conclusive in overturning the simple statement that USL
ships cannot do re-entries. You may *wish* it were otherwise, and obviously
do, but so what? The facts are that the FF&S rules are so contradictory that
they can be used to prove damn near anything you want them to! Too much damn
detail!

Like I said, sorry for being so sensitive, you were getting part of a blast
aimed at someone else who was even more offensively smug on even less basis
in the "facts". Anyway, I\'ll trade the weather with you, hey? I always did
prefer to head north for the southern summer ... no sweaty, sticky, beaches

I\'ll ship the humid sticky weather we\'re having!

Let me see If I have this straight.  1G of force acting on
eveything below my elbow would come out to about 7 pounds of
force.  This would be the same as the force that is
currently being applied to my arm by gravity! OH MY GOD!

Also regarding ContraGrav, Unstreamlined Ships and
Planetfalls, I believe its is not only possable but
allowable to have Unstreamlined Ships land on worlds with
atmospheres provided they do so slowly.  Streamlining in
FF&S and all versions of Traveller is mostly about how
aerodynamic a ship and not how structural sound it is.
Remember that an Unstreamline Ship can enter a gravity well
and land every bit as easily as any streamlined ship can
provide that there is little if any atmosphere.  This means
that unstreamlined ships will not collapse under their own
weight.  Also FF&S states that the capabilities of
streamline can be modified if the vessel is equiped with
someform of weigth compensating drive, such as contra-grav
(FF&S page 10, 2nd column, 2.97 inches from the top of the
page).  That pretty much tells me that you can land an
unsteamlined ship with contra-grav on a planet.

        OK, I was exaggerating for effect. The point is, there is going to
be a discontinuity in force applied over the limb resulting in a _shear_
force at the interface. It\'s not the net magnitude of the force that might
cause a problem, it\'s the shearing force. For something as short and stout
as your arm, it won\'t cause any more trouble than laying the upper part on a
table and sticking the forearm out. But for larger or more fragile objects
it will.

        Can we all save our breath and bandwidth? Marc Miller has already
stated he _won\'t_ do this. So Traveller IV is going to have TNE as part of
the canon. If that bothers you, feel free to ignore it. Let\'s move on to
less partisan discussions ...

   The problem is this--do you now abandon any attempt at advancing
the timeline so that you can spend eternity delving into the past?  Even
if you said, ``OK, it\'s now X years later, and this is a brief summary
of what happened in the interim,`` that would be better than just leaving
everything hanging.

   That\'s my major concern in all this.  OK fine, MM thinks the TNE game
mechanics don\'t work for Traveller--his game, his rules.  You still have
to advance the timeline at _some_ point, whether you do that in detail
from 1202 or 2000 is irrelevant.  The story has to continue.

   This of course begs the question, ``why did it fail?`` and I think the
answer is more complicated than ``TNE sucks.``  Remember, GDW was
on a downhill slide in revenue long before TNE was introduced.  You\'ll
find that collapse of GDW caused the failure of TNE, not so much the
other way around.

FF&S is clear enough; here is a very direct paraphrase: USL hulls cannot
land at all, SL cannot land if atmosphere is thin+; Only AF hulls can land
in any atmosphere of note. CG can modify this. (FF&S, p10)

On page 75, it makes no references to streamlining in the text on CG. It
simply allows a ship to float down. It still takes thrust to get back up.
So one CAN land that way. In BL (mk1md1) it clarifies that SL hulls can
land in atmospheres of thin+ only if they have CG (BL, mk1 md1, p. 1)

>
>-Merrick

Note: Under Mega, all vehicles except for "Aircraft" aircraft (Helo\'s,
Blimps, planes, and ballons) used a configuration and streamlining code.
Many ground vehicles had code 4usl (box, unstreamlined). They obviously
could land in atmosphere.

Also, under MT, the following quote applies:

"Streamlining: Any ship of configuration one to six, regardless of
streamlining, can land on a world with an atmosphere of zero or one; for
all other worlds, streamlining is required. Irregular structures and
planatoids cannot land on any world."
(MT Referee\'s manual, pg. 58.)

For reference, the codes are as follow:
0       open frame              5       sphere
1       needle                  6       dome/disk
2       cone                    7       irregular
3       cylinder                8       planetoid
4       box                     9       buffered planetoid


So, since all designs done with book 2 under CT were in that 1-6 hull type
range, they can all land on planets w/o significant atmosphere.

I belive this is the basic answer to the origional question. (Phil\'s
diatribe not withstanding.)

This isn\'t always true.  It is along the thrust axis.  All the g loading
is along the thrust axis.  Well not always.  The total acceleration
applied over a time interval is x gs.  It is either from one axis of
thrust, in which case my comment applies, or it has several rockets that
push in different directions and to get the full x gs, it rotates them
to the same direction serially to apply their thrust.  In that case the
g loading in the non-prefered thrust axis is x/#rockets gs (since it\'s
braced for the total possible).

For most ships this means a prefered thrust axis.  The others have
several thrust axies all braced to their share of the load.

So you could land the sucker on its tail if you bothered to put the CG
on there as long as the surface gs aren\'t more than the hull is rated at
along the axis in question.

As for the "gently floating down" concept, I guess I keep thinking this:
If the CG lifters are discreet, then they apply forces to the hull where
they are (as if they were little rocket motors).  Can the USL ship
cantelever mass from those points where the CG is?

I still (personally) tend towards the definition:

Any ship that can\'t land is USL.

A ship that can only land with CG is SL.

A ship that can fly (land without CG) is AF.

Then all you do is pay the extra few % on the hull cost, and don\'t worry
about it, since the only thing that\'ll change is adding/removing a U on
your ship form :)

I agree that FFS isn\'t clear about this and that you could prove damn
near anything with lots of it.  I saw the point in the rules that said
landing ability could change depending on the installation of CG, but it
never says exactly how.  I think it\'s reasonable to interpret the rules
in such a way that the designs published make sense with the canon, and
there are ships that can\'t land in traveller.  Of course I never used
AG/CG on anything larger than an APC in my universe (ot thruster plates
for that matter).

Grandfather\'s hidey holes, and eskaloyt, are located in the spinward
marches, according to supplement 12: Secrets of the Anchients.

Sorry Paul, but you\'ve just run against a cannon wall... Yaskodray
(Grandfather) is alive and well in the marches, where you can find access
to his pocket universe, if you know were to look. And yes, he took more
than one system with him when he hid. Including the Anchient\'s homeworld.

If this is the case then does it need to mention it?  Page 10, USLs
can\'t land, period.  Page 75, here\'re the CG rules (implied: use them as
long as it doesn\'t contradict other rules).  CG on a USL, sure.  Land
with it... hmmm, see page 10.  No.

I don\'t see any paradox here.  Saying there is is like saying that
"sure, I can put a 6g drive in any hull, the Mdrive rules don\'t mention
hull types."  Then you make a hull to the 1 g specs. Whatever bracing is,
USL forms are those that don\'t meet the requirements to land by
definition.  I\'d tend to let them land if they are set up for it, but
make accidents very nasty indeed and control would be non-trivial in
many cases.

Wind would be interesting, too.  You\'d decend Mdrive down, and any cross
winds would have to be corrected for with attitude thrusters (assuming
you don\'t use flywheels for this).  If the wind is too strong you have
all the control of a balloon.

Difficulty numbers were fixed; no modifiers to them were ever involved
under DGP/MT task system. All modifiers were to the dice rolls.

Wereas, under TNE, both difficulty level chances and direct additions to
asset exist. (look up Hand Computer in TNE).

I don\'t see this.  I see new boundries for the Imperium, with The
Marches as the center of it.  At least for the time being.  Granted,
there could be a time in the far future (pardon the pun) when the
Imperium is back to it\'s former glory.  But there\'s no reason to
assume that it can\'t achieve a little bit of its old self in the near
future.

Bravo to Jerry.  Thank you for showing some maturity.  Don\'t stop discussing
the subject, though, just don\'t argue.

Anyway, IMHO, TNE didn\'t kill Traveller.  I agree with a point I think you
made.  Shop owners were skeptical to carry TNE after the MT flop due to poor
proofing.  I know if I were a shop owner, I would be leery(sp) to carry it
(and I like it).  With so many other professionally done games, it doesn\'t
make sense for a shop to waste valuable shelf space with a second rate
product(Not that TNE was second rate, but after MT, I\'m sure many end
consumers weren\'t willing to take the chance).

I also agree with Phil.  MM will likely not have initial investments enough
to produce multiple historical settings.

So, If you are listening Mr. Miller.  My wish list is as follows:


  - TRAVELLER 4: A main rules book that includes:  basic character
generation         (human and alien) for multiple careers (at least ten),
basic world/system         gen charts, basic starship/equipment/vehicle
design sequences (FF&S extra         lean and lite :*), basic trade
guidelines, basic combat guidelines, lots         of
equipment/vehicles/starships, basic task resolution, a major detailed
timeline (including maps of the imperium at such&such a date), a short
write-up about each of the main time periods available, and at least
three mini adventures (one for each of the three main time perions:
CT/MT/TNE and any new time periods you want to include).  The size of
this book would be along the size of the TNE book, but must be well
organized, well proofed, and readable.  I know this is a major work, but
it may be the only way to at least soothe everyone. (300-500pgs(possibly
in a 3-ring binder))

  - CONVERSIONS - A complete rules book to transfer all characters,
equipment/vehicles/starships, and any other items to the new system.
This book must be fair and easy to work.  Everything ref\'s and players
currently have must be transferrable(sp).  (30-50pgs)

  - ADVENTURES 1 - A booklet of two (one regular/one mini) adventures for
each           time setting you choose to support initially.  (6-10
adventures in 60-100         pages)

These first three books should come out at the same time, or relatively
close to one another (within two months.)  The rest of these would be
Printed as resources become available.

  - EQUIPMENT GUIDE - One equipment guide for each time setting.  Any new
settings books would need more equipment than already published settings
(the equipment from previous settings can be transferred usine the
Conversions book).  The newer settings would also need a section
detailing the general guidelines for equipment/vehicles/starships from
that setting (Main Tech level, Main uses of equipment, etc).(25-35pgs for
old settings/50-75 pgs for new settings)

  - "TIME PERIOD" SOURCEBOOK - One sourcebook for each time period.  This
would          include details about each time period.  This would become
the main              reference guide for the time period covered.
Includes:  Main Regions            (ie, TNE: RC & Regency),  Main people
(ie, MT: Dulinor, Lucian, Norris,          Strephon), Corporations,
Adventure hooks, Aliens known, Etc.  (50-100pgs)

  - ADVENTURES # - One book of 5-10 adventures for each time period.
Include all         types of adventures:  Hack-n-slash, Diplomacy/Spy,
Colonization, Trade,         Others.  (75-100 pgs.) (Multiple Books)

  - ALIEN SOURCEBOOK - A detailed book on each of the major races, and one
book         to cover multiple (2-4) minor races.  This should include:
Advanced Char         Gen, History Timeline, History Time Period Write-ups
(To run alien         campaigns in alternate time periods), small
equipment/vehicle/starship         guide, physiology, psychology, other
relevant info.  (75-100pgs)

  - REMBERANCE - A Reprint of CT/MT/TNE out of print material.  Three or
more         seperate books.  (For the benefit of people like me :) who
didn\'t get on         the bandwagon until too late.)

  - FF&S LITE - As has been discussed here often.  (More gearhead oriented
than         the Basic rule book, but not as much as the current FF&S (If
you want the         detail of FF&S use FF&S and convert the
equipment/vehicle/starship.))

  - CAREER SUPPLEMENT -  Rulesbook for advanced char gen for the main
character         types (Does construction worker fall in this category?  :)
)  Include         modes of operating for military/business, NPC generation
in this field,         Main employers in this field:

         - Trader Guidebook - includes major companies, modes of business
operation, etc.
         - Naval Guidebook - includes major race navies, Standards of
Operating,                 etc.

        Each book would help players and Ref\'s Flesh out character
backgrounds         (could include detailed background rules) as well as
give players and         ref\'s an idea of what type of life the character is
used to.

  - OTHER - Miscellaneous other supplements.  IE, Virus, Coyns, Etc. Others
as         Requested/Desired/Necessary.

  - DETAILED RULES - Detailed rules for World/System building, Large scale
ground         combat(Striker), Small scale Ground Combat, Small Scale
Starship                 combat(BL), Large Scale (Fleet) Starship
Combat(BR), Etc.  (Multiple         Books)

This is nearly my complete wishlist.  This is also nearly a complete product
line and would probably not be completed for a decade or two.  I hope this
is what you wanted to hear.  I like your Idea of multiple timelines, and I
think the best way to support them is jointly at first (ie ADVENTURE 1
above).  The only other products I would like to see are Novels and
Promotional Items (Shirts, Posters, Pins, Ties, Etc.).

I also am prepared to offer my services as writer on a commission basis.
Please let me know if you are interested, I would love to help keep
Traveller alive.

PS.  I almost Forgot.

  - REFEREE QUICK GUIDE - A reference for Referee\'s including the most
useful            tables (ie Encounter, NPC gen, Etc)  and a master index to
all Teaveller         products.

The following is the result of the NYPD underemploying me.  I had
to at least _look_ busy...  Comments/Criticisms welcome.  Flames to
/dev/null, please.
====================================================================

Introduction

Starports tend to take on a certain importance to a frequent Traveller.
They are a focus for certain necessary activities, and they provide
services that Travellers of all types find desirable.  However, the
typical Universal World Profile provides only for a single-character
descriptor for a starport - the familiar A, B, C, D, E, X ratings, and
the ratings for spaceport types F, G, H, and Y.  These ratings give
enough information for routine activities - they answer the questions
"Can I get fixed here?" and "Can I get fuel here?".

There are other activities that take place at a starport - Quarantine,
on the Frontier and inter-polity borders is one such activity; cargo
loading and unloading is another; and various kinds of services,
including tourism-related services, will be available.  The following
system will allow for an extended profile to give the Traveller
information at a glance about the starport and its suitability for a
particular purpose.

The Universal Extended Starport Profile

The format of a Universal Extended Starship Profile (UESP) is as
follows:

A-AAAAAAAA
| ||||||||
| |||||||+---- Tourist Facilities                             (TF)
| ||||||+---- Business Facilities                            (BF)
| |||||+---- Live Cargo Handling                            (LC)
| ||||+---- Non-living Cargo Handling                      (CH)
| |||+---- Fuel Availability                              (FA)
| ||+---- Dock Size                                      (DS)
| |+---- Ship Repair Capability                         (SR)
| +---- Ship Construction Capability                   (SC)
+---- Overall Rating - this is the code from the UWP (OV)

Each character has a specific meaning, which, when combined with the
ratings in other areas, gives an overview of what to expect at the
starport.  Note that no distinction between orbital ports and ground
ports are made; it may be assumed that ports with an OV of A or B have
orbital components; C ports may or may not, and all other ports are
ground-based only.

Ship Construction Capability

This code represents the ability of the starport to construct
spacegoing vessels.

Numeric codes larger than 0 represent an exponent of 10 that denotes
the displacement of the largest starship that can be constructed at
the port.  A 0 means that the starport is known to construct military
starships of classified displacement, but is not known to construct
civilian ships.  Letter classifications represent an ability to
construct non-starships of displacements in hundreds of tons, with
the ordinal position of the letter in the Anglic alphabet, omitting
the letter X, representing the multiplier.  Thus, a ship construction
rating of 4 indicates that the port can construct starships
displacing tens of thousands of tons, while a rating of Z represents
an ability to construct non-starships of up to 2500 tons
displacement.  The code of X represents an inability to do any ship
construction.  Note that a starport with a starship construction
rating can also construct non-starships of similar size, but no
larger.

Ship Repair Capability

A starport can automatically perform annual maintenance and
structural repairs on any ship that it could construct.  This rating
represents its ability to repair ships that are larger than it can
construct, up to a limit of the port\'s dock size.  Codes are one of
the following:

        S - Structural Repairs: Replacement of load-bearing members
            and hull sections
        M - Annual Maintenance: heavy maintenance needed once per
            year, including replacement of drive components
        H - Heavy damage: similar to annual maintenance, but
            availability of parts may not be immediate, as it is in
            annual maintenance.
        L - Light damage: drive parts are unavailable, but
            adjustments and remanufacturing of old components is
            possible.  Parts for other systems easily available.
        C - Cosmetic damage: adjustments and refinishing possible.
            Replacement parts generally not available.
        X - Repairs to large ships not possible.

Dock Size

This code is interpreted the same as the code for Ship Construction
Capability.  Letter codes are not used, except for X, which refers to
a port that has no docking facilities.  The 0 code is used for
starports that permit only military craft to dock.

Fuel Availability

This code represents the type of fuel available, and, in the case of
unrefined fuel, the method of availability.

        R - Refined fuel available from starport facilities
        U - Unrefined fuel available from starport facilities
        D - Unrefined fuel available through "dipping" under control
            of starport authorities
        W - Unrefined fuel available through "dipping" with no
            restrictions
        X - No fuel available

Non-living Cargo Handling

This code represents the level of loading and unloading services for
non-living cargo available from the starport.

        M - Massive:  Virtually any starship can be loaded into the
            cargo hold of a sufficiently larger ship.
        H - Heavy: Hundreds of displacement tons can be loaded in one
            operation.  Special Packaging (radioactive, biological,
            special environment, etc.) available.
        L - Large: Cargos not requiring cranes or heavy antigrav can
            be loaded.  Special Packaging other than special
            environment available.
        N - Normal: Special Packaging other than Flammable, Gas,
            Corrosive, Radioactive not available.  Maximum loadable in
            one operation 100 displacement tons.
        S - Small: As Normal; maximum loading 75 displacement tons or
            less.
        P - Portable: Manual loading only.  Antigrav not available.
        C - Crew: Facilities available, but no stevedore service.
        X - No cargo handling facilities available.

Live Cargo Handling

This code represents the level of loading/unloading and life-support
services for living cargos.  Note that these codes apply only to
broadly terrestrial-compatible life forms.  The capability drops
based on the need of an ungeneered human to survive in the required
environment as follows:  If a human needs a class C environment
suit (basically thermal clothing and/or filter masks), life forms
from that environment can be handled at the indicated level.  If a
class B suit (pressure differential) is required, life form handling
is at one level lower.  If a class A suit (protection from corrosives
or extreme pressure differentials) is required, life form handling is
at two levels lower.  Note that these codes assume that all life forms
involved are for a single cargo, and are all of the same type.  Many
starports are able to handle several live cargos at once.

        H - "On the hoof": Herds of large herd animals can be
        maintained for up to one week.
        S - Single large animals can be maintained for up to one
        week.
        P - "Packs": Groups of medium-sized animals (dog or
        cat-sized) can be maintained for up to one week.
        K - Kennel: Single medium-sized animals can be maintained for
        up to one week.
        C - Contained: Small animals (caged or otherwise contained
        [e.g. aquaria, terraria, et cetera]) can be maintained for up
        to one week.
        X - No live cargo maintenance available.

Business Facilities

This code describes the ability of the shipowner or operator to
conduct business without leaving the starport.  It includes
availability of brokerage services, legal assistance (both barristers
and solicitors), obtaining permits and clearances, and other
business-related services.  Note that the absence of any particular
service implies that higher-level services are also not available
(e.g., no solicitors implies no barristers and no Consular/Diplomatic).

        A - All activities can be managed without leaving the
            starport.
        C - Consular/Diplomatic services cannot be obtained at
            starport.
        B - Barristers are not available.
        S - Solicitors are not available.
        T - Trans-shipment of cargo to the planet\'s surface/nearby
            cities is not available.
        K - Brokers are not available.
        P - Permits/Clearances are not available.
        X - Public communications facilities are not available.

Tourist Facilities

Most planets consider it advisable to make it easy for tourists to
visit - tourism, after all, brings in offworld money, which makes it
easier for the planet to engage in offworld trade.  Nevertheless, there
can be a wide variation in the quality of service that an incoming
tourist can expect to experience.  This code provides a guideline on
what to expect.

        A - Every courtesy is extended to tourists; any service
            requested is likely to be available (perhaps at a price)
        R - Transient residential facilities (B&B, hotel, etc.) are
            available.
        S - Shopping (usually duty-free) and dining facilities are
            available.
        B - Baggage/Package transfer to the planet\'s surface/nearby
            cities can be arranged
        L - Live communication to the planet\'s surface/nearby cities
            is available
        M - Recorded Message Transfer to the planet\'s surface/nearby
            cities is available.
        C - Customs/Health/Immigration and Frontier Quarantine (where
            applicable) only.
        X - The port does not have provisions for incoming tourists.

Standard Expectations

As was indicated earlier, the single-character starport/spaceport code
allows you to assume a certain level of facilities at a port.  The
table below shows the minimum and "normal" facilities levels in UESP
format for each single-character port type.

Minimum                 Normal
A-5M7RLXBB              A-6M7RHSAR
B-ZM4RLXBB              B-4M5RHPAR

 I came up with a new career for a RC campaign.  Its a variationon the
standard marine career. Its an elite regiment of Oriflamme Marines.  I
based it on the Special Forces career, because they are both require
prior service in a military career.  At the end are four marines that I
rolled up to see how the new career compares with a standard marine,
and one who entered the Special Forces.  They all have about the same
number of skills levels,  the Special Forces has the most with 31, and
the standard marine has the least with  25, both members of the THIRD
have something in the middle.
  This career does uses cyberwear from FFS, I am not trying to turn
Traveller into a Cyberpunk game, I just think this shows how the
Oriflamme Technarchs will use any possible tool, to accomplish their goals.

  This career could be used in a non Coalition campaign, by changing
the names.  One of the Sworld Worlds might have such a unit.

Third Armored Infantry Regiment Oriflamme Marines

        The Third Armored Regiment is one of the elite groups of
Oriflamme Marines, its history traces all the way back to settlement of
Oriflamme during the Rule of Man. Most military  organization have
fanciful nicknames, the Third Armored Regiment is simply the THIRD.
During the Solomani Rim War an Imperial Army General called them "the
Devil\'s own Regiment" for their forceful resistance of the Imperial
invasion.  This saying is the unofficial slogan of the THIRD.
        Before the Civil War the Regiment  was equipped with battle dress.
The Collapse made the upkeep of large amounts of battle dress difficult, by
1153 the THIRD was forced to come to the conclusion that within 3 years it would
no longer be able to field enough battle dress equipped troops to make
up an entire Regiment.  The Generals in charge decided to go with
cybernetics. Oriflamme was able to produce TL-9 cybernetics and some
TL-10 devices.  Most members of the THIRD possess two to four
cybernetic devices.  Now that Oriflamme has joined the Coalition, it
has access to battle dress that was produced off world.  The THIRD has
been fully equipped with this, but still uses cybernetics. The THIRD
also equips its troops with various types of Slow and Fast drugs.
        The THIRD is an elite unit, and only admits marines that have already
proved themselves in service to Oriflamme.
        The THIRD is used as an assault unit. If there is a piece of ground
that the Generals need, they send the THIRD.  They are never used for
garrison duty, or peace keeping.  The unit is often dropped behind enemy lines
and into other dangerous positions, without adequate support.  Their tactics
tend to emphasize speed and destruction.
        The THIRD is only a Regiment, as such it is commanded by a Colonel.
There can only be one Colonel in the THIRD at any time.  If the existing Colonel
rolls for a promotion,  to take it he must revert to the standard Marines.
Most THIRD officers are too proud to transfer to an ordinary unit, and that is
why the THIRD has such a high promotion roll.

Motivations:
  Queen of Spades: Force Commander Treste is the epitome of the ruthless
Oriflamme marine, she will do anything to eliminate the enemy and destroy
their will to fight.
  Eight of Diamonds:Treste is possessed by greed, but not for herself, but
for the Oriflamme Technarchs.

 Treste was born on Oriflamme in 1168, to parents who worked for the newly
formed Daishow Trust.  They raised her to be dedicated to the Trust.
When the Trust started to raise a unit for the Oriflamme Marines, she
joined up.  The Marines recognized her talent, and commissioned her as an
officer.  She specialized in counter-insurgency and guerrilla warfare.
After the conquest of Spencer she was promoted and sent in to eliminate
resistance.  She has instituted draconian measures designed to eliminate
support for the rebellion.  Her efforts have proven effective, rebel activity
has fallen by 45%.

his superiors over orders.
  Five of Diamonds: Rashid likes luxury.  He likes finely made clothing,
beautiful art, good food and other niceties.

Rashid was born one of the Orbital Arcologies that survived the Short Night.
He always dreamed of being a great hero, and saw the Marines as his chance
to be that hero.  Soon after joining he began to butt heads with Marine
officers.  This didn\'t do his career much good.  After one term he transfered
to the Oriflamme Special Forces.  He served three terms specializing in security
for high ranking officials.  He can often be found as the bodyguard for a
Technarch who is traveling through the Coalition or beyond.

Motivations:
 King of Clubs: Lieutenant Kircher is a brutal thug.  He enjoys watching
others suffer.  He is a total boor, who most people despise on sight.
 Four of Hearts: Kircher does like people, he doesn\'t understand why
people don\'t like him.  He usually takes out his frustration on his victims.

Kircher\'s parents were both killed in food riots in the early 70\'s.  He was
assigned to state run orphanage.  Here he learned that he had to be strong to
survive, any sign of weakness was seized by the other orphans. At eighteen he
was turned loose, after a few months of wandering, he joined the Marines.
Here he found an outlet for his violent tendencies. In fact the Marines
encouraged them.  He was commissioned and after distinguishing himself on
an assault on a Raider\'s base deep in the Oort Cloud, he was offered a position
in the THIRD.  He jumped at the chance.  He served with distinction, gathering
a Purple Heart in the assault on Spencer.

She knows just what to say to put people at ease.  She has hundreds of friends
and can count on their help.
 Four of Spades:Trinka would like to be more than a corporal, but she seems
to be too lazy, to actually rise much farther.

Corporal Dobson was raised in a fairly average family, in a fairly average
small town.  She and a group of friends went to the big city, one weekend
when she was seventeen.  She doesn\'t remember much of that weekend, but
at the end of it she and three of her friends woke up at an Oriflamme Marine
bootcamp.  Her friends fought the enlistment without success, but Dobson
found that she actually liked the marines.  It finally gave her life some
direction.  She served with distinction, and was given a chance to join
the THIRD, she leapt at the chance.  A RAM grenade cost her her arm on Spencer.
She simply had it replaced.

        But they\'re not discrete, nor applying a force. They are defined as
creating a field in which 99% of gravity is blocked. So nothing\'s cantilevered.

Face it Harold. TNE died not because I don\'t like it but because
it failed to generate the necessary support. So, as you said, cut
the bullsh*t & admit that you don\'t really care how little support
TNE garnered, you just want it because it\'s what you want. Nothing
wrong with that but don\'t expect me to agree to squander limited
resources on a scheme that\'s already failed. And, yes, it\'s failure
*does* mean it is entitled to less, quite a bit less.

  To say that TNE died because of \'not enoufgh support\'(Talk about a
generic term!) is incredibley simplistic.
 There are a multitude of factors as to why GDW folded
1: The RPG industry has been hurting as a whole, even WW is laying off
people.
2: Dangerous Journeys
3: Several failed games on the part of GDW(Cadillacs.. Dangerous..)
4: TNE not having *any* suppliments for about a year.

 And for all I\'m concerned, unless I get hard statistics from GDW, TNE
did not die. You are making a big assumption there.

1.      STREAMLINING

>From Merrick:
>I still (personally) tend towards the definition:
>Any ship that can\'t land is USL.
>A ship that can only land with CG is SL.
>A ship that can fly (land without CG) is AF.

Not a bad version of the definition. Now for some related questions:
1. What is the LARGEST ship that can enter atmosphere?
2. What is the largest ship that can land in water?
3. What is the largest ship that can land on land?
(all assuming a 1G world).

My (arbitrary) answers are:
1. 100,000 tons (allows criusers but not battleships)
2. 20,000 tons
3. 5,000 tons

Comments? Also, does anyone know the equivalent tonnage for a
supertanker (relevant to Q2 above)?

2.      ANCIENTS

I have posted my Yaskoydray data to Paul Walker.

3.      STARPORTS

Jeff, you have hit one of my areas of interest. I used Striker (#1) to work out
how to build a TL 15 starport for Tavonni, armouring those buildings that needed
it, and trying to cover all requirements for the \'port.

If you like, I\'ll post all the references I found (eg. "from Port to Jump-point"
by Leroy Guatney).

Under CT, one could purchase "jump Tapes", which had the course all ready
and waiting; a ship without a navigator could use them for travelling via
jump. THey were for jump only.

1> the regency is a parliamentary republic (RSB)

2> the regency is at the limit of timely responsiveness (Several sources;
implied in RSB, but not explicit.)

3> The regency is phasing out the nobility
3.1> the nobility are what allowed the imperial gov\'t to operate on the
scale it did.
3.2> the nobility and rules for them gave a feel that is intentionally
different from the 3rd imperium.
3.3> the lack of top-driven authority breaks republican and parliamentary
governments historically; so why should it be different in Traveller?

4> What\'s in the "Black Curtain"? WHat is the "Empress Wave"?

5> What about those lurking viruses? The ones that are out there are
obviously NOT self-destructive; even in the wilds, the base chance of
encounter is 1/3, modified for starport types; assuming the usual 2 checks
per system per trip (1 at jump-in, 1 at arrival at planet, and same on way
out) even 1 in 36 chance makes for a lot of viruses left throughout the
wilds. [this is really poor game design, not a background issue, but the
two factors ARE linked].

summary: Virus permanently changes the TNE universe so that a traditional
"imperial" type gov\'t will not rise again. Hidden fears, paranoia, and
xenophobia are problematic.

If you really want to land with an USL ship to a planet with atmosphere it\'s
OK to me, but you have to take care of wind speed and atmospheric
conditions. Those ships can\'t manouver and so they are very vulnerable to
sudden wind changes. And if wind speed is high enough it would cause heat
damage to USL ship. Its IMHO not economically sensible to risk a valuable
spaceship in landing if it can handle its business from orbit. And if they
aren\'t any orbital stations then they most times aren\'t any ground control
either (spaceports A, B and some C have orbital stations).
Because were are talking about merchant ships here, were have to consider
economical factors: the much more time needed to land and get off from
planet, risks to ship in atmosphere, stress to crew, price of CG, smaller
cargo capacity if ship has CG, etc.
These are the reasons why in my campaigns USL ships don\'t land on planets,
although they can do so if absolutely necessary.

Hey, remember TSR\'s repackaging of their old AD&D modules into single
volumes?  T1:Village of Hommlet thru to Q1:Queen of the Demonweb Pits all
got thrown together as one (or two?) much larger volumes which contained
all 8 thru 12 or so original adventures.

Well...

It would be pretty cool if the entire JTAS series could be republished
(verbatim) in a few, large (that is, normal-sized) volumes.  48(?) A5 pages
per issue would translate to 24 A4 pages - allowing a full year (produced
quarterly, right?) to occupy a single 96 page volume.  If we want the best
of the best, then just collate the Best of the JTAS!  The same could be
done with the A5 Supplements/(Double) Adventures and what have you.
Limited (re)runs for those still using CT/MT.

I don\'t know about the legalities.  I don\'t know about the economics.  All
I know is that I would happily shell out the big-bucks for a complete set
of (The Best of) JTAS without even flinching.

    'body' => 'Jump Drives, Improved Performance & Tech Levels

The standard Traveller Jump Drives are *allegedly* available from the pseudo-TLs
of 9-5
and, basically unchanged from CTrav, require (1 + JNo)% of Hull Volume for the
actual Drive and (5 x Drive Volume) for fuel. These are obviously *not* really
"new" TLs as they all cost 0.3 MCR per ton and mass 3 tons per cm to TL/13,
2.5 tons at TL/14 and 2 tons at TL/15. Only the latter two levels could really
be regarded as "new" TLs. Now, bear with me for a moment --

                    Maximum Drive
Jump Value          Mass    Fuel Mass       Mass/J1    Fuel/J1

J1                  2    10                 2           10
J2                  3    15                 1.5         7.5
J3                  4    20                 1.33        6.65
J4                  5    25                 1.25        6.25
J5                  6    30                 1.2         6
J6                  7    35                 1.16        5.8

(All figures are as a % of Hull Volume)

Obviously (and it confirms this in MTrav and TNE) the fuel requirements go down
for 1 Parsec Jump whenever a "new" TL of Jump Drive becomes available . . . but,
we are asked to believe, even a TL15 world capable of producing a J6 drive, can
only produce a TL9 equivalent *efficiency* J1 drive. In other words, that TL 15
world, capable of producing a 1 Parsec jump for 1.16% of Hull Volume in Drives
and 5.8% in fuel can only produce a standalone J1 Drive as inefficient as a J1
TL9 unit!

Surely they *should* be able to produce a J1 unit @ the reduced volume (and,
thus, reduced mass and cost) and reduced fuel requirement, as *should* be the
hallmark of any real improvement in technology? After all, at the higher TL,
they are more efficient art producing the effects of low tech and low tech
equivalent equipment with their hi-tech industrial base!

Again, it seems completely against all logic that "improved" technology is so un
realistically limited. It\'s like trying to get us to accept that a 1996 technolo
gy produced Maritime Steam engine would have the same hp/wt ratio and cost
the same in relative terms, not to mention having the same fuel efficiency, as a
n 18th century Newcomen & Watt Beam engine! In a word, unlikely! Seems to me tha
that you\'ve either got to accept that the TL rating system is seriously stuffed
in a purely
practical sense in that it cannot (well, *does* not) allow for these sorts of
improvements *or* you\'ve got to admit that J1 (and other J ratings less than the
current maximum) *should* reduce mass/fuel requirements as noted above.

Of course, those who treat FF&S (or MTrav, or CTrav) as "holy writ" won\'t come
at *either* idea -- after all, the "rules" state that J1 Drives are *always* 2%
Drive and
10% fuel *regardless* of the logical holes that the rest of the system punches i
into that -- or *has* punched into *it* as a result!

Sort of like Galileo and Copernicus refusing to believe that observable facts sh
owing that
the sun was the centre of the solar system just because the Pope\'s "rule book"
stated that teh earth was!

Sure, we\'re talking SF "pseudo-reality" here rather than the "real
world". but don\'t we have a right to expect some sort of system that *seems*
more real than Traveller allows.

OK. We accept (as someone noted recently) a number of "suspensions of disbelief"
to allow the game to work -- that is, gadgets or game system rules that are
completely ridculous (like the flat, 2d universe to make mapping workable) when
one
stops to think about them, or which are impossible according to our current
understanding of the universe (such as JDrives, CG lifters and Thruster Plates,
HePlaR drives, and Psionics). But the *rest* of the game system and background
has to have some semblance of corresponding to reality *or* we find our
boundaries of belief are strained beyond the point of credulity!

So, why should we accept, say, that a TL7 Portable Airlock (as described in the
Imperial Encyclopaedia, IIRC) is the last and final word in Portable Airlock tec
even at TL15-16 ... or at higher TLs? Are we to accept that such devices can
*never* be made more cheaply, of lighter but still as strong materials, or less
bulky materials? No! Nor should we, by this reasonable standard, assume that
JDrives never improve their efficiency and size for *old* models as *new* models
are introduced.

Well, that\'s my 2c worth anyway.

   The problem is this--do you now abandon any attempt at advancing
the timeline so that you can spend eternity delving into the past?  Even
if you said, ``OK, it\'s now X years later, and this is a brief summary
of what happened in the interim,`` that would be better than just leaving
everything hanging.

   That\'s my major concern in all this.  OK fine, MM thinks the TNE game
mechanics don\'t work for Traveller--his game, his rules.  You still have
to advance the timeline at _some_ point, whether you do that in detail
from 1202 or 2000 is irrelevant.  The story has to continue.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Well, there\'s always the "multiple timeline" suggestion that someone else
has already made. It would be possible to start from, say, 1110 or so &
advance a timeline that wouldn\'t necessarily lead to the same results that
DGP produced in their CT/MT transition. Alternatively, it would also be
possible to advance so far that any part of the \'past\' could be dismissed
as fable. Either way, it would, for all intents & purposes, discard part/
parts of what the "story" is now. If earlier eras are *really* going to
be supported I think it will eventually become necessary to establish
alternate timelines so that players won\'t feel \'trapped\' by the already
established future.

But wait a minute. As someone pointed out (thanks *very* much for doing so
and getting us away from all the trees so that we can see the forest as a
whole!) the variable here is *planetary atmosphere* NOT, and I repeat that,
*NOT - NOT - NOT* Gravity. A USL vessel can land on a planet *as long as the
planet has no atmosphere*. The GRAVITY is irrelevant ... as it notes quite
specifically in *all* the Traveller material ... see FF&S page #10 for a
start, "In general, airframe hulls may enter any planetary ATMOSPHERE to
land on the surface or skim fuel; streamlined hulls may skim gas giants
but may not land on planetary surfaces with ATMOSPHERES of greater than
Thin; and unstreamlined hulls may do neither."

Interesting, hear that hissing sound? It\'s the argument that several people
have been using to counter my comments to the effect that USL hulls cannot
stand the gravitational stress of re-entry. Or, to put it another way, bzzzt!
Sorry, wrong answer ... FF&S (and all previous Traveller stuff IIRC, and I\'m
pretty certain here) states that it is the ATMOSPHERE that is the problem.
And implies (states negatively, in fact) that USL vessels can land on a 1G
(or 6G, for that matter) planetary surface *as long as it does not have an
ATMOSPHERE*!!!!!

Ergo, the active factor they are presuming would make this impossible *cannot*
be gravity. It must be, as I have pointed out, atmospheric resistance - or
aerodynamic heating ... so this means that, since we know (as I have pointed
out) that vessels on CG lifters can float/power down at 40 kph, they can, quite
obviously also make atmospheric re-entries. The gravity has no effect!!!

Or are you going to seriously tell us that atmosphere has some mysterious
magical effect that negates only spacecraft mounted cg lifters, but not (say)
Grave Tank or Air Raft cg lifters? Get real!

Face it, FF&S and all the other Traveller stuff may *say* that USL ships
cannot enter atmospheres, but the technology descriptions make it plain that
this is *NOT* the case.

Nice try guys! But no banana!

(And, yes, *I\'m* being insufferably smug at this point!).

Jeff, this is a pretty good peice of thinkin\', but I do have a few comments

If you are going to break ship construction out of the OV (when the
description of that class star port describes the construction anyway) then
you should break out the orbital component as well.  And what Kind of orbital:

     Geo-stationary
     free-orbit
     lagrange point?

Some planets the whole starport may be orbital (which would explain some of
these worlds were the population is 5, but has a type A starport and a Navy
Base present), or the Orbital facility may refuse to handled streamlined
ships due to limited capacity.  As a GM looking for assistance, describing
the differing orbital/down components is an area where I would like some help.

I would prefer that these (particularly numeric codes follow the Traveller
standard.  I would rework this to be:

      digit = tons of displacment exponent
      0 = No Construction Capabilities
      1 = 1-10 tons (can build a launch)
      2 = 11-100 tons (ships boats, and other non-starships, + scouts)
      3 = 100-1000 tons (basic Traveller Starships)
      etc.
      9 = REALLY BIG SHIPS

You could then use letter codes (A-F) to represent exotic features like
Military Only, etc.

Your idea here is great, but the code system seems negative.  In your
previous examples, the letter \'H\' for hooved animals indicates a presense
of.  Now \'B\' -- Barristers not available is an absence.  Maybe this would be
best a numeric lookup code like Law Level or Goverment Type.


Keep up the good work!!!

I think the idea around CG is that they displace not all of the displacement
of the ship, so any ship can float down to a 1G surface.
Howver, getting back up without suffering damage would be a problem
for any USL or SL in dense atsmophere.
So yes CG will support your gentle floating down, but the atsmophere and
buffeting of the laminar/high altitude wind flow an speeds IMHO may
cause a bit of a problem with an USL ship, don\'t you think.
Not to discount the weather.

So IMHO any ship can land using CG\'s, the question is would it survive
intact, as by definition any USL ship would be at the mercy of the planet\'s
weather systems and as would SL in dense atsmopheres.
"Woops, there goes our antenna".

AF would be able to withstand any *normal* atsmopheric effects.
By normal I mean an average day where the spacecraft was built.
I would look forward for publication of:
" Table 1.1 random events per 100 meters descent of a USL space craft.
  Table 1.2 random events per 100 meters descent of a SL spacecarft landing
        in a dense atsmophere.
  Table 1.3 random disasters per 1Km descent of a spacecraft with respect
        to atsmopheric conditions, just to spice the adventure up a bit."

Example:
You try lowering the voyager probe say at a very small rate of descent and
tell me that it would be unaffected by atsmopheric conditions as it takes
ages for it\'s USL body to hit the earth.  CG\'s would slow descent in order
to prevent friction.  However as it isn\'t streamlined, external conditions
would buffer the probe.

It is a known fact that wind speed near the ground is only a fraction of
wind speed further up.  Plus electrostatic charges, particles, aerosols
and the odd frozen chicken fired at the spaceship would cause a little
pitting of any protusions.

I see where you get a 1 in 3 chance, but this (as you pointed out) must be
modified for Starport Type.  The chance is as follows:

        Type            Chance          Percent
         A              4 in 6           66.7%
         B              3 in 6           50.0%
        C&D             2 in 6           33.3%
         E              1 in 6           16.7%
         X              0 in 6            0.0%

The chance of finding a starport above E in the wilds is slim.  When you add
to that the chance of an encounter being a Virus ship (I think I figured it
out to be 1 in 60) the possibility of running across a Virus ship is rare
indeed.

This says nothing about the fact that the encounter tables are for points
when the referee\'s imagination is lacking and not a dictate of storyline.

I would agree that Virus limits the possibility of a future Imperium ever
rising to the magnatude that it existed before Strephon\'s murder, but that
is due to othe facts, not its current rampant existence.  Virus effects the
future possibilities because it:

        1. Destroyed all (Regency excluded) of the areas of civilization
left untouched by the Rebellion.  A different ending to the Rebellion would
have at least left large pockets of untouched civilization. (I believe the
arguement about the mass destruction and change describer in Survival Margin
is null as well.  Survival Margin was a TNE GDW product.  Note the Product
number and the section on converting characters.)
        2. fundamentally changed the TNE areas of civilization.  The RC is
vehemently against ideas (ie, nobility, secrecy) that the Imperium stood
for.  They even look at technology differently.  The Regency has mutated
into something that would severely frighten a Imperial citizen of say 1108.
Psionics are accepted and even used for the military.  Nobles no longer
control the government.  The Aslan & Vargr invaders have been assimilated
rather than fought off.  The evil nasty Zhodani are not only our friends,
but we even let them move onto our planets.  All of this is directly related
to the Regency closing its borders which happened because of Virus.

Basically, I believe that the rules support the facts that A) Virus is
currently rare, and B) the effects of Virus are severe.

True enough.  I still stand by a caveat to your use of CG.

They must use CG along the axis they are braced for.  They may not land
on worlds with a larger surface gravity than they are braced for.  I
would let SL ships land on larger sized worlds, and AF hulls land on
worlds larger still regardless of the internal bracing (AF hulls are
more braced than the others----the MV is multiplied by an additional 1.3
when doing the actual hull).  Besdies there has to be some benefit to
SL+ options.  This is a gravity effect, not an atmospheric one.

Having said all this, what do you think is a good solution to the
problem?  What problem?  Well, I _like_ having different types of ships
with trade-offs on what they can and can\'t do, so I\'d like to see USL
ships that can\'t land.

Maybe there is a simple interpretation of CG that\'ll allow us to require,
say, a closed hull form for CG lifters to work.  I\'m waving my hands
right now, but you get the idea.  A simple rule that adds to the design
rules as an option would be a good thing... it also wouldn\'t void canon
since I seem to recall ships that can\'t land on worlds.

Hmm. Actually I\'d prefer to see this in two books, the two totalling 3-500
pages. The first book containing all the rules, and the second containing
the background (separated into the three time periods, natch). The books
available together or separately.

This would allow those people who don\'t actually use the
Imperial/Rebellion/Hard Times/Virus backgrounds to continue with their own
campaigns and it would allow the diehard [insert whichever Traveller rules
set or variant you actually use] referees to use the background (or at least
the parts they agree with) without having to sully themselves buying/reading
through a complete new rules set. :-)

Rob. At the risk of starting another ruckus, is it worth having a poll to
see which eras (or even separate backgrounds) people are playing? [no flame,
no flame, it was just an idea.....]

Finally. To whoever asked about the Vargr (sorry, I can\'t find the original
question under all the bile :-0 ), the simple answer is that Vargr already
are \'domesticated\' (that\'s probably not the right word though). The
differences in behaviour between a Vargr raised in Vargr society and a Vargr
raised in a predominantly Human society would be minimal. The Vargr would be
used to the more stable Human society and his relatively unchanging charisma
in relation to it and would be less prone to the sort of \'high charisma
gain\' actions that Vargr in Vargr society would take for granted.

If you want to mail me the original question again (straight to me at
dave.elrick@ps.co.uk) I\'ll try to be a bit more specific.

Kind Regards

I want Player and Equipment stuff in one book, and ref oriented stuff in a
seperate book.  It was reall tough trying to get characters created and work
on flushing out a world when there is but one book.  GM\'s will invariably be
putting final touches on their adventure just before it starts, and if the
players are busy passing the book around, it becomes difficult.

I would like a players book that has:
    Intro  Story
    Character Generation
    Skill Descriptions
    Character Improvement
    Equipment (Standard, dont waste space on building items here)
    Core Task/Combat System (personal, ground, and space)
    Players Map of the a few of the campaign areas
    Library Data (Players Version)
    Psionics (Player Info)

Then in a Refs Guide
    FF&S ultra-light
    World Building
    Trade
    Psionics (refs info)
    How to run an adventure
    Character Improvment from the GM\'s standpoint
    NPCs & Patrons
    Animals
    Aliens (Non-Player types for stocking unexplored worlds etc.)
    Library Data (refs version)
    History from Era A to Era Z

Then have each era represented in a seperate Era Book.

I thought about it, but it would probably end up with the same debate and
flaming going on.  Marc already knows what he wants to do and I suspect that
he is looking for ideas like this message thread presented (types of books
and content) rather than CT/MT vs. TNE or Pre Rebellion vs. Rebellion vs.
Virus.  So do a Poll if you want, though the results may not be of any use.

however "man" would still have to tolerate certain strains of Virus and their
personality traits/disorders
to exist in their operating systems.  Perhaps somehow "man" has imposed the
three laws of robotics
upon the logical circuitry of Virus computers and subjugated them to "man\'s"
will.

At least this explains the TNE past, bridges past it, opens up new
technological fronts, and makes man
once again dominant.  Which seems to be the major point of disatisfaction with
TNE that Viruses seem to run the show.  The setting could take place as short

seem unnecessary to prolong the Short Night (a phrase I have heard coined that

 I don\'t think it\'s construction capability should be based on ship size,
as if your in 0-G, why do you have to build inside the starport at all?
Why not just have a ship being built "200 KM spinward"? out of the lines
of traffic.
 Rather, IMHO, it should be based on the capability of the starport to
manufacture -vs- import the nessicary components for the ship and the time.

system can\'t be used to run a Pre-Collapse or Pre-Rebellion campaign.
  I\'ve long considered Traveller, in all its incarnations, to be the best
SciFi game ever made.  Bar none.  I\'ve also considered the players of
Traveller to be among the most intelligent in the gaming community.  You
have to be, after all:  it takes a lot of work and imagination to make such
a free-form, relatively limitless system work.  For the discussion over
which direction it should take in the future boil down to a bunch of people
bickering and shouting about oxen gone astray and calling each others\'
babies ugly is truly a sad turn of events.
  In my opinion, MT and TNE are both excellent products and reasonably
logical extensions of the Traveller timeline.  Empires do fall, after all.
There\'s no reason we should have expected the Imperium (or any of the other
Major Sophont Empires, for that matter) to last forever.  To those who
don\'t like it, I say LIVE WITH IT.  What\'s been done is done.  It may not
be pleasant, or even good, but it\'s REALISTIC (well, somewhat).  We
shouldn\'t waste time arguing over whose version of history is the "true"
one.  TNE has been published, therefore it is part of the "canon" that so
many people seem to be obsessed with these days.
  So, what I\'d like to see done is to have the timeline taken _forward_.
About 100 to 150 years or so, enough to get us past the rough rebuilding
period after the Collapse and the Longer Night.  By then, the RC and the
Regency should have met each other, with probably unfortunate consequences.
The Coreward threat to the Zhodani should be closer to materializing.  The
other major races will have recovered nicely (or nastily).  And, probably
most frustrating to "old fogies", NEW COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY will have been
developed to combat Virus!  I kind of envision a "Dune" type atmosphere,
where computers are used only when necessary and humans are trained as
"mentats" or "savants" or some such thing.  But maybe I\'m being a bit
presumptuous.
  The point, of course, is this:  Quit wasting time arguing about who\'s
right and who\'s wrong and get back to the real business at hand:  plaing
Traveller and writing information and adventures for it.  Write it in
whatever format you use.  Those of us with too much time on our hands will
convert it into the format we use.

What I usually assume is that:

a)  The profit margin on these items is too low to be worth the high
tech planets to bother with (Sort of in the same league as the VW Bug
only being made in S.A. because it would requre Japan and the U.S.
car makers to down-grade equipment to make it ... not worth the
effort).

b)  Any higher tech item (like the airlock example) can and is made,
but is specialized and costs alot more.  It is much lighter/more
efficient/less bulky and similarly more expensive.

Thanks

Regarding Jdrives annd efficiency:

Phillip argues that a TL15 J1 drive should have the same fuel costs,
etc. as the J6 drive possible (BTW, I agree with examples like the
airlock he mentioned) at the same TL.

Jump is one place where I don\'t think this kind of arguement is
airtight.  What if size/cost/fuel use is based on different
_qualitative_ probelms associated with J-space.  To do a J1 requires a
drive unit of some size (2% of total field volume (read 2% of ship:)).
It also takes 10% ship\'s volume in fuel... regardless of TL.  The tech
is the same, or near enough that the improvements get lost considering
the MCr level of cost.

To do J1 with the efficiency that the J6 drive does, you have to build
the J6 drive, then put in fuel for J1.  The drive is bigger, but you
neeed the bigger thing-a-ma-whatzit to access the J6 area of Jspace.

The other systems with a TL of introduction, then no improvements are a
little odd though.  The problem with Jdrive is that it\'s so far out
there, any one of us could make up a plausable arguement why whatever we
want is true.

in the amount of "detail" in the MTrav and FF&S design systems is a *BAD*
thing. There would be no doubt in my mind that USL ships could not land in
CTrav ... there\'s no explanation of how contragrav or thruster plates work
at any significant level beyond the simple fact that they exist. For that
reason, while I might (it\'s a *long* time ago!) have thought it silly, I
never objected as, after all, I had no idea what the reason for the prohibition
was!

But MTrav, then FF&S *INSISTED* on giving us all sorts of unnecessary chrome
- and *that* is where the rot set in! Not necessarily the "chrome" per se, but
the way in which it seems to have been just slapped in there with no playtest
at all (not to mention no proofreading!) ... surely a simple logical look at
the new chrome in MTrav and TNE would have revealed the logical flaw in this
(and other!) areas? The real problem is that no-one really gave the thing a
thorough going over by someone not intimately involved with the design (having
done some of this for SJ Games and BTRC for some stuff, I can speak with a
degree of experience here ... not to mention designing stuff myself, FWIW) -
of, if they *did* they ought to sue!

How do I explain it away? Well, you really *cannot* do so without modifying
the rules. The simplest method, I would suggest, is to look at the NOE rules.
AFAIK there is no indication anywhere (please point it out if there *is*)
as to what *height* NOE speeds apply to ... in other words, is there a minimum
altitude to go with the maximum safe speed. This could be manipulated easily
(and logically enough) to require vessels that have no avionics to remain
at "high" altitudes on the understanding that cg lifters cannot be tuned to
the fine control tolerances needed for safe *very* low altitude maneuver (NOE)
without special extra controls (the NOE Avionics, in effect). This doesn\'t
really stop USL ships from landing. but it *does* explain some things about
them.

As for your argument that USL ships are braced differently and so cannot land
on a planetary surface. Again, you have ignored *completely* what was written.
A USL ship *can* land on a planetary surface ... it just cannot land on the
surface of a planet with an ATMOSPHERE! In other words, if you have a standard
Terran planet with 1 standard G, a USL ship (according to statements in Trav)
cannot land ... but a similar 1 standard G world with *no* atmosphere, and,
well, it *can* land! THIS is the problem that shoots your comments completely
down in flames.

Ultimately, the solution is to not try to be so superdetailed (or be a *hell*
of a lot more careful about it!) as FF&S was. Then there will be no basis on
which an argument such as mine could be supported. In other words, ditch
FF&S *completely* IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

NO, I do NOT mean ditch it forever and a day, but do a COMPLETE rewrite that
involves *NOTHING* of FF&S as it exists. Go back to the roots of CTrav and
work forward from there. If you end up wanting some of the ridiculous non-canon
changes of FF&S/TNE (such as HePlaR drives), well, include *them* too, but
do it from the basis of CTrav\'s technology base, NOT from the butcher jobs that
MTrav and FF&S did to it (of which the current argument is a case in point!).
That way there will be no problems such as we have here! This is the best
possible solution, stop trying to make a silk purse out of the sow\'s ear of
FF&S.

You know the thing that *really* pissed me off about FF&S (I was *already*
pissed off by HePlaR replacing 15 years worth of Thruster Plates and changing
*every* important factor about Space Travel and Space Combat)? It was the
inclusion of *non-Traveller* tech to pad it out. I don\'t *care* about 2300AD
stutterwarps, nor do I want Dean Drives or Subspace Sensors. I wanted standard
Jump Drives, Maneuver Drives, Sensors and the details needed to work with
them. Even the inclusion of tech of levels higher than max Imperial (16+) such
as Matter Transmitters and the like) I regarded as a waste of space. It was
never going to appear as something the players would interact with as more than
"passengers" in a deus ex machina in any campaign I ran, so design parameters
were pointless to give!

Anyway, another 2c worth!

(though I doubt it :-).  This may be similar to something Wil Hostman (or
someone else?) wrote earlier, in which case I apologize in advance for
stealing his thunder.

The idea is this:  you allow J-Torps, but make them highly unreliable.
Specifically, they get a +5 to the misjump roll (if using CT.  For TNE,
the person launching the torp must roll a formidable test of engineering).
This gives the torp a high chance of misjump (41.66% using CT), and a
small chance of exploding (8.33% using CT).

Why is this a good thing, you ask?  Because such a torp, if reasonably
expensive, could not replace/marginalize the X-boat network, but it could
still be used to send out emergency messages (if they don\'t arrive where
you want them to go, they might at least arrive _somewhere_) and as
lifeboats.  This also minimizes the problem of J-torps being used as a
weapon (again, assuming relative expense).

One could justify this unreliability by saying that the 100 ton limit is
the limit for safe jumps and that objects below that volume have
problems.  For instance, one might say that objects from 50-99 tons
have a +3 DM to misjump and that anything below 50 tons gets a +5 DM.  These
figures are fairly arbitrary, but you get my drift.

Phil, before you quote FF&S again, I realize it puts no lower limit on
the size of jump capable ships, but that could be for any number
of reasons.  FF&S was supposed to be a technical architecture for all
sorts of backgrounds, and GDW may have wanted to allow the possibility
of small jump-capable craft in backgrounds other than the standard
Traveller one. Also, it may simply have been an ommision.  There are lots of
CT/MT sources which state the 100 ton limit, so I\'m going to take it as
canon despite the lack of mention in FF&S.

Finally, I would like to point out that the idea of an unreliable j-torp
is not incompatible with Leviathan.  The description in Leviathan is as
follows:

Jump Message Torpedoes:  Consists of little more than a jump drive, fuel
and a recording unit.  \'J-torps\' are used to send messages by
automatically broadcasting  a pre-recorded tape at the conclusion of
their jumps.

It says nothing regarding their reliability, and one could assume that
they are included as emergency messengers (yes, I\'m playing with
semantics, but it\'s a minor point :-).

Of course, one can play around with the DM/task difficulty to make the
j-torp more/less reliable.

contain.

I get the feeling from reading these threads that there seems to be a large
group of people ( not necessarily players or refs ) who seem hell-bent on
turning what was once a really enjoyable game into a hard-science simulation of
a possible future ( despite the conjecture which surrounds such
vapour-technology ). Such an approach generates volumes of rules designed to
cover every possible situation ( doomed to fail since this is a moving target -
but great for third party publishers ) and changes the referee from a person
responsible for running fun adventures, into either a nervous wreck or a
techno-engineer.

Sure new timelines and campaign backgrounds are a great idea when used to
provide stimulous for adventures. And there\'s nothing wrong with Traveller ( as
a wholistic product line ) catering for those who\'d rather get their numbers and
rules right than play the game. There will always be those who prefer designing
things to playing with them, or wargaming with miniatures or other non-personal
techniques, and good for them.

But Traveller ( The Roll Playing Game ) is not about that ( in my opinion ). It
is about a group of intelligent, imaginative, enthusiatic players getting around
a table with some dice, paper, pens ( and only the minimum amount of rules ),
and having a memorable experience. After all, Roll Playing is about experiencing
an alternate reality for a while, through the medium of the referee, and the
environment created by the Traveller Universe ( or whatever game you\'re playing
). It\'s about fun, not rules.

I\'d like to see a LOT more space dedicated to letting new players know HOW to
roll play in the far future ( we do want new players don\'t we ? I know a lot of
us have been around for a while. Could we be feeling a bit jaded with our
campaigns perhaps ? ). After all, there should be enough experienced players out
there by now to know what makes a good campaign. How about condensing that
experience, and sharing it.

I remember my first few campaigns. I couldn\'t figure out why it was so hard to
translate my vision of life in this future universe to my players. I\'d bought
ALL the books ( at that time ), had no previous roll playing experience, but was
 really enthusiastic about Traveller. Here was the game for me. However, I
expected the books to tell be how to roll play, and how to run a fun campaign,
but the books were simply full of rules, so I tried to use the rules to explain
the universe to the players using numbers, and short descriptions. It was pretty
bad.

And be honest. How many of you get more of a kick out of rolling up a character
than actually playing it ??

I suggest Mark spends a bit more effort helping new ( and maybe not so new )
players and referees understand how to enjoy the game, and less time generating
new volumes of intimidating rules and tables.

I thought T2300s Task system was a terrific way of replacing large numbers of
specific rules with a simple "handle anything" resolution system. It\'s easy to
learn, and only lacks a couple of pages of gaming examples to be the perfect way
to play.

Which brings me to the idea of writing a rule book which reads more like the
story of a group of adventurers ( and their referee ) and explains the rules in
the context of the adventure, rather than as a bunch of cold facts and tables (
sure, use the publishing package to make the facts stand out for easy
reference... ).

OK, Maybe two bucks worth rather than two cents, but thats what I think...

A few quibbles with the Transstar write-up:

You say Transstar became a major shipping and
economic force in Old Expanses by 1130, but that
seems to be based on the assumtion that:

1) the Solomani took Old Expanses (which they did); and
2) they KEPT it (which, for the most part, they DIDN\'T).

The Old Expanses sector government surrendered to
the Solomani (thanks to Lucan stripping their defences),
but at their height, around 1118, the Solomani only
effectively controlled about 75% of the sector.
     On top of that, they were pushed back about 10 parsecs
by campaigns from Margaret\'s Domain, so by 1120 they
only controlled about half.
     Things stabilized there for a couple of years, but by
1123, the economic effects of the Hard Times began to
be felt in a major way, and Solomani control deteriorated rapidly.
     [what are now] Aubaine and Oriflamme subsectors were
"frontier" zones, officially "Provisional Members of the
Solomani Confederation", and dangerously close to Wilds
regions in Diaspora and elsewhere in Old Expanses.
    These weren\'t exactly high times for commercial shipping,
which is what Transstar primarily did.

Let me suggest an alternative:

Transstar set up provisional offices on Fija to handle the new
provisional territories, and kept them open even though
traffic was way, way down from initial expectations. (After
all, things can only get better, right?).

BTW, bravo for choosing Fija, its about time we heard from
someplace other than Aubaine and Oriflamme.

Another quibble:

Isn\'t Transstar\'s fealty to the Solomani Party a little out of
place in the RC? After all, this is the place where \'breaking
with the corrupt past\' is a big thing, all the planets rename
themselves, people spit on \'Imperials\', etc. And I don\'t think
the RC government would be too keen on having one of
their major shippers even theoretically beholden to an
outside power. Even if they keep the \'Transstar\' name,
just make them a _Fijan_ company.

I have only been a subscriber for a short time, but as I have a congenital
death wish, I will post a germ of an idea I thought of as I read the last
digest. If this thread has been addressed before, I apologise. Gentlemen,
start your flamers!

I think that Mr. Pogue\'s post is a good stab at one possible thread of
post-Virus Traveller. What has struck me about all the supplements to date
is the willingness for everyone out there to use pre-existing computer
technology, basically unchanged from pre-Virus days. All the computers in
the Galaxy are still open to infection from Virus. Some are more  or less
shielded, but a smart Virus can still infect any computer out there.

I would put forth, as another possible thread of the future, that Anti-Virus
feelings are much stronger than portrayed by TNE. In fact, a movement will
arise whose goal is the eradication of all comuters (cf. the "Butlerian
Jyhad" in Herbert\'s Dune series). Work is being done (in a Pocket Empire?,
in the Zhodani Consulate?) on techniques that allow minimal or no use of
computers for star travel (or in general, for that matter). Some form of
psionic precognition will be needed to navigate starships (the "Guild
Navigators"), some psionic super-memory and analysis disciplines will have
to be developed (the "Mentats"), and etc. If this was to be your time line,
many years would have to pass before this new paradigm could be entrenched.
Of course, you would also move your campaign away from more or less "hard"
science and more into "fantasy" science, but if you allow psionics in the
first place, this could be a viable option.

I have just come up with this, and I am not advocating it as in any way
fully-baked (in fact, it hasn\'t even gone in the oven yet), so please
remeber that when you comment.

Thanks,
John A. King

I\'ll just throw in my two cents from the other end of the spectrum.  I
can see and agree about your argument for HEPlaR replacing Thrusters.
That was a change that was obviously put in to energize BL combat via
the threat of Bingo Fuel et al.  Dumb idea?  Maybe not.  Should it
have been a mandatory change?  Probably not.  Bring back Thruster
Plates?  Yeah.

However, I must admit that the one thing I did like about FFS was that
it did present alternative technology.  Just because some people don\'t
deviate from the "standard" Traveller campaign doesn\'t mean that there
aren\'t others out there that wouldn\'t like to do something different.
Even if it\'s just once-in-a-while.  I really thought that alt tech was
one of FFS\'s strong-points and I hope it stays in the next version
too.

As for TL16+ those are kinda necessary for constructing Ancient
artifacts.  And making the other occasional TL18 lost civilization in
some far-off sector isn\'t too bad too.

I dont think that it was intended to say "within the starport" as much as
that main world\'s ship construction capabilities.  Where isn\'t mentioned,
but the capacity to build.  The orginal post had values that had X meaning
no capabilites, 1-9 was the tons of displacement exponent, 0 ment military
construction.  I was just suggesting that to follow the Traveller standard
where 0 means no capabilities, 1-9 appropriate size, A-F used for Exotic
situations, such as Military Only.

Depending on the system, the ship construction facilities may be at a
lagrange point, while the trading docks are at another.

: Specifically, they get a +5 to the misjump roll (if using CT.  For TNE,

: This gives the torp a high chance of misjump (41.66% using CT), and a

Many people have mentioned this.  I think this is the best solution
and probably the most plausible.  It explains why they\'re possible but
not feasible to use for regular runs.

Now, I\'m not sure so please correct me if I\'m wrong.  The reason that
FFS doesn\'t impose a 100 ton limit was to make it fit in with some
original CT stuff.  I always assumed this to be j-torps and the like.
I clearly remember the 100 ton limit being in MT, but I don\'t remember
it being explicitly stated in CT.  Granted, CT is the only era that I
don\'t have everything for, so I may be missing something.

As for the standard Traveller background.  In TNE, there are under 100
ton j-capable starships.  They can all be found in the RSB, and the
most notable one would be the jboat.

[other snipped for digest people]

Of course I always thought reactionless drives were goofy, so, since it
isn\'t mentioned in CT (HG, etc., though maybe in a JTAS----not all of
those articles are canon, BTW, Loren wrote a letter from the editor
about it once in JTAS) I never even considered the drives to be
reactionless.

Your basic point is (correct me if wrong) that detail provides too much
of a focus on things that should not be looked at too closely.  I agree
with that to some degree.

I disagree that all of FFS should be thrown out the window, however.

My solution is to ditch the bad, fix the ugly, and keep the good.  You
mention a simple fix regarding the NOE speed rules.  Great!  It\'s
simple, write it out in a clear way, and throw it out here for the rest
of us to use.  One down, you\'re perceptive enough to find and fix a
bunch more, so just fix \'em.  The really bad problems you throw away.
You\'ll find that you\'re preaching to the choir regarding the lack of
playtesting, BTW, I think we all agree about it :-)

True enough, but then again you need a high rms velocity on your
atmosphere atoms to not have an atmosphere on an earth size planet :-)
But you\'re right, this is an oversight in the rules.  But all rules have
broken bits in \'em.  Fix them.

What about rock-throwing?  I don\'t wanna start the super KE weapons
thing again, but you either limit CT rules in an arbitrary way, or any
nut with a lifeboat can kill your planet.  My point is that all such
rules are broken to some degree.

I totally agree.  Fix FFS, and be careful.  Playtest the extremes so
that it still fits the universe we play in.  If you mean by "in its
current form" that if anything is wrong, then we toss the whole thing, I
disagree.  Keep what isn\'t broken, trash the rest that can\'t be fixed
(and a lot can with not much more than clarifications, IMHO).

A lot of FFS makes sense.  There will be physics limits on most tech.
You need x amount of energy delivered to a unit areea to burn a hole.
Period.  Non-FTL sensors will obey EM physics, so those are physics
limited.  Etc., that\'s a good thing about FFS.  I think that a rewrite
is required, BTW, and a major one at that, don\'t get me wrong.  Funny, I
think we actually agree about most of this :-)

I could also live without a bunch of the alternate stuff.  Much of it is
useful for the reasons Jerry mentioned, though.  And the higher TL stuff
gives some neat ideas regarding what research is being done in the
Imperium, etc..  The key is that the higher TL stuff needs to fit with
the plans for future developements in the universe (something the I
doubt was thought of----they designed the rules for FFS, then applied the
higher TLs to the RSB.  They needed to know what the Regency would look
like, etc., then do the higher tech.)

see that FFS basically quantifies what information was presented in

 It can only hurt other infantry. So this thought line continues, and you
come to the conclusion of why not just make all tank and drone units?
 Against the pathetic vehicles in the RCVG, infantry can do something
with it\'s missiles(but the tanks can just fly over them:P), but against a
properly armourd TL-15 vehicle(av410 all around), infantry cannot hurt them.<<

It\'s already that way.  Infantry in Traveller is useful for the same thing
infantry has been useful for since time immemorial:  holding land.  No cordone
of starships or tank squadron or whatever can do what a large fighting force can
do:  hold land.  It takes the tanks, planes, starships, etc. _to_ take the land,
but the infantry must then hold it.

Shortly after I posted my original wish list (I think it was as I drove home

I would rather see this in one book at least initially.  This helps
alleviate the problem of which era to start publishing with.  The three time
periods already published have lots of materials for support already.  The
most important point is to bring the old profiles into the new system.

Virus is not all that widespread.  I have a rough spreadsheet worked up (if
anyone wants a copy, I can clean it up) and the probability of encountering
a virus ship in the Wilds is about 1.7%.  Consider six encounter rolls per
system:

1. Travel from 100 Diameters to 10 Diameters,
2. Travel from 10 Diameters to Orbit,
3. Travel from Orbit to Landing(Docking or Skimming),
4. Travel from Landing(Docking or Skimming to Orbit),
5. Travel from Orbit to 10 Diameters, and
6. Travel from 10 Diameters to 100 Diameters

And you increase your percentage to 10%.  This works out to be 3 systems in
a subsector, 45 systems in a sector, and 1800 systems in all of charted
space(TNE, pg. 13, 40 sectors Wilds, 6 sectors Spinward States, 3 sectors
RC/Rift/Hiver).  This is not all that much people.

Let\'s not worry about how widespread Virus is.  The facts are it isn\'t.  In
addition, the advent of the Fer De Lance ("Snake") and Peacemaker Virus
strains will further weaken virus stands.

In conjunction with this I am working on a short term timelinefor the
immediate future(25-35 years) of the RC and Regency.  I\'m at a loss as to
the Empress Wave though (it seems my original theory wasn\'t cannonical.
:)).  If anyone has any suggestions I\'d love to hear them.  I\'ll post my
ideas in a few days(after I have some weekend time to work on them.)  Thanks!

I think so.  The Alien Books were written more to the culture of each alien
race.  Vargr society behaves like the book details, but an individual Vargr
does not have to.

If you look at various Spinward Marches materials, they have many references
to the one lone Vargr (The Traveller Adventure for example).  Pack oriented
CHR fighting had little to do with any thing.  Your Vargr is in a Human
Society and will behave with Human tendancies.

Run him like a human, just has cool looking fur.  Just dont make him "Go Fetch".

I was working along the same lines and learned quite a bit by studying
the quotations scattered throughout the TNE books.

For instance, there\'s a quotation from a Regency officer making
comments about the Reformation Coalition dated 1206 (!).  It seems
they are going to meet very, very soon indeed.

There\'s also strong indications that the Star Vikings and their
tactics aren\'t used very long by the Reformation Coalition.  I can\'t
remember exact dates or references, but if I remember correctly, there
is a reference dated on or about NE44 (1244) discussing the Star
Vikings in the past tense.

Of course, don\'t forget the very end of Vampire Fleets.  There is a
one-page section that gives all kinds of tidbits of information.

    'body' => 'Well...the gored oxen seem to have mostly crawled away to die, so we
can get back to posting real stuff...

This is my first weapon design with FFS, so bear with me.

Background:

I wanted to figure out something like the gun the alien used in
the first Predator movie. From appearances it\'s some sort of energy
weapon, but nothing in FFS fits...there\'s no way, for instance that a
fusion or plasma gun can be built at that size, so I designed it as a
gauss gun...which can be done with minimal bending of FFS.

FFS describes armor similar to the armor in Predator as appearing at
TL-15; my guess is that by TL-16 it will be improved to the point
described in the film.

The other break in FFS is the utter lack of a \'smart-gun\' type
tracking system as in the movie.  An aiming system appears at TL-10
(described in the cybernetics section); again by TL 16, I\'ll assume
that the system works as in the movie.
----
Tukulliya\'a Industries \'Predator\' smartlinked Gauss gun

Tukulliya\'a is a small Aslan weapons design firm that produces
limited production, and custom weapons systems for, mostly, private
clients.

The predator was designed for hunting in the arboreal forests of
Tyuar, an aslan-owned garden world, maintained as a safari reserve by
the A\'Aiehkel clan.  Tyuar is earth-like world with a southern continent that 
is a
gigantic forest.  These forests make the Amazon Rainforest look like
a sparse alpine meadow...there are four very distinct ecosystems in
the forest.  Of interset to the Aslan is the mid arboreal system.
This is the part of the forest, high enough in the forest to get
continual sunlight, but below the tree tops, and is as close to a
three-d environment one can get to on dry land.  Most  the large anmals
that live in this zone are brachiating quadrupeds, along with
some hexapods.

One of the latter is a fast, vicious predator, called the IyaTakh.
The IyaTackh is probably the top predator of the Tyuar forests. The
IyaTackh is a solitary predator, whose closest mammalian analog on Earth would
be the leopard.

Even for the superior Aslan reflexes the IyaTackh is a difficult
prey, so the A\'Aiehkel commisioned the \'Predator\' Gauss gun system.
The weapon is mounted on a harness and sits on the shoulder of the
Aslan, with the controlling batteries, and computer system in a fanny
pack type arrangement. The aiming is done via a head mounted HUD that
tracks the movement of the eyes, and shows the aim point of the
weapon.  The harnes includes an inertial compensation frame which
absorbs most of the recoil.

Other than this is it a fairly standard, short-barreled 10 mm Gauss
carbine.

The A\'Aiehkel will rent this weapon as part of the safari package;
part of the standard Tukulliya\'a contract for custom designs is that
the firm has licence to produce the weapon for other customers; they
have made it in other calibers.

Moderately, OK.  I didn\'t fall in love with MT when it came out,
but I used it.  I didn\'t fall in love with TNE (mechanics) when
it came out, but I\'ve used it.  Personally, I don\'t think the
mechanics matter as much as the feel of the game.  CT *feels*
open and fast.  MT *feels* complex and restricted.  TNE *feels*
even more complex and restricted.

Yes, there was that.  I\'ve *never* been able to completely
convert to MT.  I thought it was me, turns out half the book was
screwed up. ;->

Do you remember the sticker shock?  I do, vividly!  I left and
returned 3 times before I could bring myself to plunk down $30
bucks.  Of course, the $50 for TNE was just as bad.

I agree about survival rolls, dump them.  I don\'t use \'em anyway.
More skills, just run 2 year tours instead of 4 year ones...with
the same number of skills per tour.  Give us multiple character
construction paths:  build in place from points; grow over a
number of years; quick career templates with embellishment..that
kind of thing.

One change nobody but me seems to want involves the basic
Attributes.  I want to break Dexterity into two parts:  Agility -
balance, body awareness and movement; and Dexterity - fine
manipulation of objects with the hands.  I\'ve known highly
dexterous people..watch makers, jewelers..who had two left feet,
were old and fat.  I\'ve also known people with excellent
balance..dancers, running backs..who were all thumbs.

That\'s my take on it anyway.

Ahhh. But why do you need such a "complex" computer? I have begun developing
a program for my calculator. (A Texas Instrument TI-82.) And although I\'m
not sure weather I\'ll ever finish the program or not, I\'ve found that it can
do most of the things you need it to. OK, I wouldn\'t want use it to keep
track of the players in space and such, but the calculator is quite capable
of doing the NPC rolls, keeping track of health and such. Not to much
though, and this is the real drawback, as it\'s memory is quite limited. It\'s
hard to program it when you are dealing with such a limited number of
variables. Enough wining from me ;-) A program like this can be made. But it
would require some time.

Anyone else tried this BTW? Anyone interested in a finished program?

How does CG slow descent, In BL p15 states"CG lifters do not provide thrust and 
so cannot
physically lift a ship. Instead, they neutralize most of the gravitational 
attraction of a world
(approx. 99% of Gravitational froce. This combined with atmoshere pressure, 
will provide buoyancy
in VERY DENSE ATMOSPHERES eg like a Gas Giant. Think of a submarine, it 
displaces its own
weight of fluid(liquid or gas), therefore it will sink to when the amount of 
fluid displaced is
equal to the weight of the sub.  By fill the tanks with compressed air it 
reduce its displacement
volume and rises. The US Ohio class SSBN Displacement: 16,764tons and 18,750 
tons dived and took
3years to make.

What i am trying to say here is if a USL ship enters to atmosphere it would 
have to sink a long
way before it reaches its buoyancy level (the bigger the ship more it displaces 
and this my be
modified by surface area of ship or Density of fluid),if a object is 1 ton or a 
hundred tons they
will still Sink or fall at the same rate and increasing to maximin speed(this 
my be modified by
surface area of ship or Density of fluid),  the USL craft would have to have 
its thruster pointed
towards the gravity well to arrest its desent (or a parachute which the voyager 
deployed after
releasing its heat protection which protected it through the thin upper 
atmosphere.

As for Grav craft using CG, it states on p23 step2 Suspension in FFS that" CG 
allows light lift
vehicles to be buoyant on worlds with sufficiently dense atmosphere.  Howeve, 
all congtra-grav
vechicles are assumed to have vectored thrust agencies to hold them up the 
remaining faction of
their weight, allowing them to hover.

This my interperetation of the rules!

It\'s already that way.  Infantry in Traveller is useful for the same thing
infantry has been useful for since time immemorial:  holding land.  No
cordone
of starships or tank squadron or whatever can do what a large fighting force
can
do:  hold land.  It takes the tanks, planes, starships, etc. _to_ take the
land,
but the infantry must then hold it.

5MCr is a bunch of money :-)

Also, what about combat Ops in areas that aren\'t free fire zones?  How
does it tell a local from a target?  BTW, it\'s a robot, not a drone
since it can function on its own, right?

I\'d think that for many uses you\'re right, robots would be used, but
grunts still have uses in complicated situations.  The Zhos use robots
as I recall.  Maybe only in non-Zho space so the killing locals bit
doesn\'t matter.

That sucker is nasty, though.  The fuel is 12 g-hours?  Its usefullness
without refueling will be scaled to planet size then, but still...

This is a nitpick on FFS, not your critter, but HEPlaR should have a
huge sig IMO.  At the very least we\'re talking as much of a sig as any
big engine.  My grunts will have fire and forget heat seekers :-)  And
maybe some left around the perimeter as mines.

I wonder what the cost of killing your drone would be, combined with
training the soldier...

     Different folks, different strokes. I _LIKE_ the increased detail.
In fact, that\'s probably the biggest reason I even bought TNE. Take it away,
and you probably lose me. That\'s bound to be true for others as well. Don\'t

        Just because you don\'t like it doesn\'t mean others don\'t as well. If
Traveller 4 is to have a chance it\'s _got_ to attract _all_ types. Don\'t
like the detail? Don\'t use it.

For smart, mobile military tech, that\'s relatively low.  Consider that a
top of the line laser guided bomb costs about a million dollars (like the
one they used to plaster that bomb shelter in Iraq).  So, if the tactical
value of this drone is high enough, that\'s a cheap price tag.

Why not plop Friend-or-Foe device in it.  Let it interogate it\'s target
with a request for a passcode (pretty damn complex one).  Granted, that\'s
not the tightest of security measures, but these things are supposed to
work WITH flesh-and-blood troops, so there would probably be a human
component in any situation that not everything is a target.

Ever wonder how they mute the exhaust from the engines of the B-2?  I
sure do.  Could find application here.

Yes, but all three books were available separately (something today\'s =

more chaotic than humans, and just look at us!  On one little planet we
have hundreds of philosophies which differ radically.  Any rules you try
to put down about Vargr are there to be broken.

Bottom line: if you want to have a Vargr who is more "Domesticated", by
all means do so.  I don\'t even think he/she would be particularly
unusual.  He might be considered by more "Wild" Vargr to be something of

Hmm.  I can think of two reasons why this may not work.  First, it
definitely breaks any type of compatibility between old and new
characters (at least CT/MT and TNE characters were only a point off).
Also, I think that adding more attributes would just make the
mechanics more cumbersome.

A better solution might be to create a lists of advantages and
disadvantages.  Yes, this smacks of a GURPSism and I\'m sorry.  But
looking at an old issue of TTC (number 2 or 3), there is a system for
having such things.  Simple things like some extra dough, to some
extra noteriety to just being clumsy.

This will allow effects like this to be achieved on a per character
basis, but yet doesn\'t add any more complexity to the rules  Some
things like task resolution should be simple.  Generic DEX and CON
allow this, while breaking it down will just allow leeway for the
players to bicker that they should be able to use the other similar
skill.

With WW\'s point/dot system this is almost workable.  Also, I think
their system is a little unyieldy.  As for simple, complete,

Funny, but all prices had gone up at about the same time as MT; AD&D was
$45 to get into (19.95 for PH, 24.95 for DMG). So I didn\'t feel any sticker

I don\'t like the "Skill slaved to attribute", and today\'s most successful
games DON\'T slave skills to attributes: Vampire/Werewolf/Mage/Faerie/Wraith
don\'t,  Battletech/Mechwarrior II slaves skills to figured characteristics
derived from stats.

I think of MT\'s solution as excellent, but it could be improved. I
preferred to use division by four, as this made the occasional alien 16
stat really special. Many people I know ran using division by 3. So it
limits skill equivalencies; that is a GOOD THING, not a bad thing. I have
players pulling off unskilled jump navigation, 1000 AU comm Tight-beams,
etc under TNE rules. Under MT, they don\'t have the chance.

It boils down to a realism question: is raw talent enough to allow people
to fly starships and plot jumpcourses without the computer? If you think
so, then TNE is better for you; otherwise, MT is the better task system.
2300\'s task system was fairly close to MT, and based upon an attribute
range of 1-20.

if we really want to, we could break everything down and have 3 dozen stats-

with any of the other situations.  The UPP stats should just serve as a very
loose guideline to the character\'s Endurance, or Dexterity, or whatever as
measured against some arbitrary Imperium-wide standard.  Don\'t be a slave to

 Compare that to the cost of intensive training eliete troops(that\'s what
it\'s skill levels are at) and equipping them. IMO, you\'d break even.
 Compare that to the cost of the Norris grav-tank, wich it _equals_ if
not surpasses as a weapons system(No joke! If this thing gets the first
shot, 200pen on the Norris while the norris can only do a 150ish). 2 of
these would take out a Norris no question, while only costing half as

 Ya, I just called it a drone cuz I like the way it sounds better :)

 Note, they have a 300KM meson commo. This would be used to refer to a

 Or if this is during the New Era, just use a friendly virus strain.

 24g-turns is limited interplanitary movement. And even not, it\'d be
_wicked_ for intercepting orbiting ships(ha, think of 5 of these taking
on a MCr100ish patrol cruiser... No contest for the cruiser if it

 They better be big heat seekers, as all the ones listed in the RCEG are
anti-aircraft/no armour vehicles.
 Yes, these do have weeknesses, but I had to make certin trade-offs
between speed, cost, and protection.

Here\'s a question, and I don\'t know if it comes up in any of the New Era
sourcebooks----I didn\'t see it directly states in the Regency Sourcebook:
How big is the Regency\'s standing Naval and Quarantine fleets.  Given the
Regency "reserveist" military attitude, I wouldn\'t think that their
standing force would be too large (enough to cover all the quarantine
districts--but not huge).  The feeling I get from the Regency Sourcebook
is that these fleets patrol for Virus intrusions, pinpoint them, and then
call out the heavy hitters to deal with it.  This would explain how the
Virus managed to penetrate deep into Regency territory a couple of times,
but was defeated efficiently (excluding Trin).  The RQS could possibly
use something like the United States Naval tactics in the Pacific in
WWII--a relatively small force that appears big by moving around quickly
and appearing to be everywhere.  Still, I would find it interesting to
know the exact extent of the Naval/RQS forces, and the size of the
reserves held in the Regecy NavInacShipFacs.  Anyone have any ideas about
how to extrapolate the size from any of the information they have?

Hmmm.  Using jump navigation as an example, why shouldn\'t it be
possible?  As I see it it would be as hard as moving a cursor to the
desired destination on the holo-starmap, and letting the computer work
:-)  I think the automated nature of a lot of tasks is glossed over to a
large extent.

I doubt that the guy doing the 1000AU tightbeam is eyeballing the maser,
as well.  For anything that needs a computer to actually perform the
task, sure, why not let anybody have a crack at it?  Anybody with no
skill level in computers must be able to use them just to read mail, do
their banking, etc. at the point in history we\'re talking about.  I also
can\'t think of a reason that they\'d purposely make an interface so
arcane that somebody could plug along and figure it out.  Of course the
jump made might not have the subtlety of a "good" jump... maybe you
jumped to a less than optimum ditance from the destination world based
on the initial conditions (there\'s the skill, IMHO), but it\'s still a
jump.

Of course I would argue that some of these things aren\'t possible,
period, without a computer.  I don\'t think the Jdrive has analog levers
on it for when the computer is down----you are either using the computer,
or you can\'t try til you fix it (IMO).

"Piloting" a ship/craft without a computer is also a non-issue, IMHO.
The only non-computer control I can imagine would be some rigged up way to
turn the drives on and off.  Maybe the vernier thrusters might just be
fly-by-wire with no computer input (or have that capability as a backup)
----but a fusion PP with _no_ functioning computer?  I\'d assume that all
such sub-systems have imbedded computers and that they all have at least
some normal kind of interface (why not?).

Now something like _building_ a Jdrive, that\'s a different story :-)

I can see your point at extremes, though... could someone who never even
saw a computer before attempt jump using TNE?  I guess that those kinda
things need to be handled case by case (first tasks to figure out how to
turn it on... then to figure out how to make it work a little, etc..  In
effect, teaching yourself a skill level.).

Or it\'s solidified, stagnant background...it just depends on how
you look at it.  I don\'t *hate* TNE.  I don\'t even hate the
concept of Virus..I can see running some interesting campaigns
along this timeline.  What I *hate* is "the one true way!"  Open
ended, flexible and nimble that\'s the way to grow the game.

I\'ve said it before and I\'ll say it again, the way to handle this
is to institutionalize *several* timelines and let them develop
into their futures independently.  Pick major turning point
events, the assassination attempt on Strephon comes to mind, and
send the future down more than one track:  he dies, he lives,
there is a rebellion, there isn\'t (whatever).  If some of the
branches become popular, feed them with sourcebooks, adventures,
etc.  If some don\'t then let them die off.

The rules should be general and open ended.  The timeline
material should be flexible and open ended.

That\'s my opinion...for today.

a full treatment of starports, ALL of the above articles have something to
contribute.

2.RULES VS BACKGROUND

Although it makes some sense to divorce rules from the background (eg. GDW\'s
"House Rules" or GURPS, useable in multiple genres), you may be interested
to know Marc Miller\'s POV back in 1981 (MM), when interviewed by Craig
Johnson (CJ):

"(partway thru interview) MM: You have to remember that from 1972 until 1977,
I designed one science fiction game and 20 historical games...

"CJ: It seems as though you prefer politically oriented games.

"MM: I think that one of the problems is that a tactical level game, especially
in science fiction, means very little. It\'s just random rules put together to
make something happen. _Mayday_ gains from that. If there were no Traveller_,
_Mayday_ would not be a very popular game. But, because there is a _Traveller_,
_Mayday_ means a lot when you actually look at what the counters are, and what
it means and how its played. The rules continue to deal with the same things
_Traveller_ does. _Warpwar_, for example, or any other small tactical games (I
think _Vector 3_ from SPI) really have no greater history around them that
helps you understand what the game is.

"CJ: It appears that they feel like making up a game, but instead of using real
vehicles, they just make them up.

"MM: I think you hit it right on the nose there. Anybody can put together a
bunch
of rules on how to do something. The problem is, can he put together a bunch of
rules that mean something in a greater context? _Vector 3_, for example, doesn\'t
do that. But _Warpwar_ seems to have so much more potential, but it\'s not there.
It hasn\'t been done is the basic problem.
There is an important concept in game design. I think the fact that I designed
20 historical games, and had to make them fit what history said, means that
_Traveller_ and all other science fiction games I\'ve designed are done in that
same approach. Not, "here\'s a rule; what does it mean?" but, "Here is a much
greater idea of what the future is going to be like. What rules do I need to
fit that?" I have to write rules to fit the future history rather than make up
the history after the game is designed. many designers fall into that problem."

High Passage, Chicago, IL, USA, 1981, p 40.

3.PLAGUE OF DUSKIR

(please note I am only up to #570; these points _may_ have already been made)

Phil\'s point that the "Vilani should have known about the possibility of disease
due to the effect on the Droyne" is misplaced - it was the _Zhodani_ who had
Droyne on their homeworld, and it was these Droyne who were wiped out by the
Ancient\'s  old biowarfare. The biology of Vland was so different from the
Vilani they needed special food preparation just to eat! Presumably, Vland\'s
bacteria had a similar problem the other way.

Also, the bit about the Solomani Hypothesis: they _did_ do onsite research.
Sure, it was "first proposed by Magis Sergei haut-Devroe (64 to 141)", but when
Terra became part of the Third Imperium (588) "a small historical research
mission verified much of haut-Devroe\'s work" (_MT Encyclopedia_, p 38).

Also, although the Vilani were at TL 11 i.t.o. jump drive, they had _not_
reached it in weapons tech (yet another reason to adopt DGP\'s tech breakdown
as official rules :-). The Sabmiqys article states that the Terrans
developed the starship-mounted meson gun. When Vilani ships began to explode
internally "the Vilani were horrified". It was just like the old legends about
the Gashukubi ("Certain Death") system - now known as Sabmiqys. The meson gun
became a terror weapon, and "did much to break the Vilani will to fight"
("The Sabmiqys", Joe Fugate, _Challenge_ #28, GDW, Bloomington, IL, USA, 1987,
p 31).

4.      LEVEL OF DETAIL

I am puzzled at the return of this thread. In the digest\'s I\'m currently up to
(approx #570), most people have agreed that an "FF&S Lite" would be a good idea.
In fact, I have not (yet) read a negative view to this idea. Surely this is the
solution - if you want "Lite" detail, use the plug-and-play rules; if you want
gritty, in-depth, calculator-intensive detail, use the full thing.

I think that a compromise should end the flogging of _this_ dead horse, at
least.

You wouldn\'t have read Midworld by Alan Dean Foster, would you? It\'s one of
my favourites, before he went commercial (Spellsinger...Yekh!) Had to do
with a 750 metre high rainforest, seven levels of arboreal terror, starting
at the \'upper hell\' and descending to the \'lower, or true hell\'.

Would make an interesting adventure... Especially for the rescuers! Heh Heh
Heh...

Responding to Bri@teleport...

>> I\'ve noticed something... In TNE, infantry is useless.
 It can only hurt other infantry. So this thought line continues, and you
come to the conclusion of why not just make all tank and drone units?
 Against the pathetic vehicles in the RCVG, infantry can do something
with it\'s missiles(but the tanks can just fly over them:P), but against a
properly armourd TL-15 vehicle(av410 all around), infantry cannot hurt
them.<<

It\'s already that way.  Infantry in Traveller is useful for the same thing
infantry has been useful for since time immemorial:  holding land.  No
cordone
of starships or tank squadron or whatever can do what a large fighting force
can
do:  hold land.  It takes the tanks, planes, starships, etc. _to_ take the
land,
but the infantry must then hold it.

 --Chris
 ----
 How would this infantry possibly defend against a tank or a drone?
 ----

This problem again????

This is a problem that has existed in all versions of trav.
Most infantry is used in close terrain where civilians etc must be dealt
with as well.

In CT the imperial infantry was equipped with tacnukes for dealing with
tanks that other weapons couldn\'t.

Most of the actual firepower of infantry units is derived from their
supporting artillery anyway.

Consider a unit of Imperial marines or jump troops equipped with chamelon
surfaced battledress, fusion guns, tacnukes and grav belts. Fireteam leaders
carry lasers and additional commo/sensor/ecm gear and spot for artillery and
ortillery.
Mechanised units are carried around in MICV\'s equipped with rapid fire
fusion guns and tacnukes.
The troopers cost about 1.5 MCr, the tacnukes only tens or hundreds of
kCr.....

Plenty of firepower to there I would think!

Django.

However, and lets not get into a flame war over this again, TNE was so
wonderful that GDW is still in existence, not!

Look, Frank Chadwick is a great *wargame* designer ... I\'ve got all his
Command Decision stuff (1st *and* 2nd Edition) and a fair few of his
boardgames as well, and I enjoy them thoroughly. I also enjoyed TW:2000
for what it was, a combat "role playing" game ... with the emphasis on
the *combat*. However, look at his failures ... Space 1889 (I really liked
this, but the 1d6 based system *obviously* based on miniatures wargames
rules, as confirmed when he released the miniatures combat rules!) sank
(and I hope Steve Jackson picks it up, at least he can design *role playing*
games ... perhaps not super-wonderful, but not at all shabby!); Traveller
2300/2300 AD sank (all you could really do was *boring* exploration a la
the infamous "Energy Curve" or kill Kafers); Dark Conspiracy ... neat idea
(I really liked the concept), but it was really Call of Cthulhu with guns
but no brains ... Shub-Niggurath appears - no probs! Just hit it with a few
LAW rockers!; and TNE went the same way. Sorry, but look at the supplements
for it, most are combat oriented. All the real roleplayers want *roleplaying*
stuff, not combat stuff. OK, gearheads like you liked it ... but it wasn\'t
enough to save the company, after all, was it? And the Trading Card caused
slump in the RPG industry isn\'t valid, as all the other dogs died pre-TC
games.

Sure, if they don\'t go into superdetail, they\'ll lose you. But you weren\'t
enough to save TNE and GDW anyway -- the loss of confirmed roleplayers was
hat put the final nail in its coffin. I have most of the CTrav stuff (it
wasn\'t always easy to get in Oz, and being posted in the country for 3 years
in its heyday meant that I missed a lot), I have most of the MTrav stuff
(excepting some of the DGP stuff, because DGP had truly *terrible* distbn
in Oz) and some of the later MTrav stuff from GDW which seems to have been
almost unavailable *anywhere*; I have TNE Base Rules, FF&S, RefCol Equipment,
and the Regency Combat Vehicle Guide (which I regret buying). I did not buy
any of the RefCol books other than the equipment guide -- too combat
oriented and, being based on Virus, too ridiculous; I didn\'t buy the Regency
Manual for much the same sort of reasons.

*Blunt Hairpins* and *CattleCarriers* (the boardgames) I regard as entirely
non-canon as they have HePlaR. Fine. *You* like it. Wonderful. If Frank
Chadwick wanted to design a Space Boardgame with reaction style thrusters,
I can live with it ... I\'d probably have even *bought* it *if* it had been
non Traveller. But to argue that Thruster Plates, good enough for the whole
what, 15 years to date in 1992, were suddenly "unrealistic" compared to
HePlaR ... which is *also* admitted to be unrealistic! ... is like saying
being a little bit pregnant is worse than being a little bit pregnant! As
for Thruster Platers being "less believable" than HePlaR, well, people had
accepted then for 15 years without demur! In any case, after the absolute
*Fantasy* (and I wouldn\'t even dignify it with a "science" in front of it)
of *Virus*, it was garbage to expect us to accept the massive change from
Thruster Plates to HePlaR.

Fine, you liked the changes. I\'ve been with Traveller for the long haul, since
1977 ... one of the reasons we designed Space Opera was because we wanted to
do it "right" (sincere admiration!) ... and I\'ve bought damn near everything
of CTRav and MTrav that was available. But TNE was a joke, and, so it seems
from the fact that GDW is no longer with us, it was one that too many people
like myself didn\'t find funny at all. In any case, it sounds as if MM is
going back to CTrav/MTrav for the "new" traveller ... or so the material
on the list seems to indicate ... so he may well not agree with you either.

What it boils down to, I suppose, is that we\'ll have to agree to disagree?!

Page 27: Increasing Attributes

Basically each character has a secondary activity that they can take each
term. Some careers have none, some have two.  The player can opt to improve
a stat with a 2D6 roll of 8+ (DM +1 per willpower level) the stat is raised.
There is a +2 level increase ceiling (pg 20)  This applies to STR, AGL, CON,
INT, EDU and CHR.

I assume someone else has already answered this, but here goes anyway.

Classic Traveller was issued in 1977 at a time when there were less than a
dozen RPGs available - and only one had any kind of detailed background
(Chivalry & Sorcery).

In the case of the sword & sorcery games such as D&D and T&T, background
really didn\'t matter - the entire world consisted of lots of dungeons and a
pub, where the survivors went to divvy up the loot.

When CT came out, it\'s only direct [sf] competitors were: Metamorphosis
Alpha and Space Opera. Metamorphosis Alpha was really only a giant dungeon
(albiet inside a generation ship) and didn\'t really need any background
since, if you found out it was a generation ship, the game was effectively
over anyway.

Both SO and CT gave the referees the necessary details to generate their own
background (I don\'t know about anyone else, but my players hung around my
one subsector until well after GDW issued any information about the
Imperium).

None of the games available at that time had much background, and referees
routinely made snap judgements where something wasn\'t covered by the rules
(this wasn\'t always a good thing as the famous \'I disbelieve this illusion\'
debate proved).

Fortunately or unfortunately, times have moved on. Roleplaying appeals to a
much wider market which mostly expects to be able to pick up a game and play
it straight away, with no generating your game world/background and little
or no having to make snap judgements where the rules don\'t cover something
(you only have to look at the kind of questions which appear in the \'Sage
Lore\' column in Dragon to see that!).

A \'standard\' background is also useful to someone like me who routinely runs
demo and participation games at shows. It allows people to sit down and join
in directly, without a great deal of explanation. In fact, this is the only
reason why I still use the Virus in any of my Traveller games (although I
have made some changes to the background - I still cannot accept the speed
with which Virus spread through known space).

What it comes down to is: a rules set without a background is just a
wargame. With a background, it *can* be something more (although some
so-called RPGs are just wargames - look at anything by Leading Edge for a
start).

To appeal to new roleplayers - and God knows, they\'re thin enough on the
ground these days - Traveller IV [Traveller: Voyages was just my little joke
 - please Marc, no!] has to be complete and playable out of the box (book,
tablets etched with letters of fire, whatever). Traveller without a
background would die on the vine faster than anything predicted by others on
this list.

Although the Vargr would always be aware of the relative charismas of the
group in relation to his own (such awareness being instinctual), he would
see the charisma of the members of the human group (including himself) as
being relatively static.

Charisma within the group, and the Vargr\'s place in the group, would only
become an issue in fairly extreme circumstances (the death of the PC leader,
for example).

However, the Vargr\'s charisma would be very important if the group were
dealing with a Vargr group.

Hope that helps

Hey David where you the one who told me and other people to stop shouting
other people down??

Why then are you allowed to do so? Phillip McGregor had some points to make
and you made some good critical answers to them. And that was ok, but then
the last thing you did was to tell the guy and every one else on the net
that he has never produced any thing worth while. Who are you to say such a
thing?

Grow up. And learn some manners.

By the way FF&S as well as TNE where not writen at all by Marc Miller, my
guess is that FF&S will have little to do with TRAV mk4. But this is just a
guess.

individual Vargr, or even a whole Vargr world, need not follow the
stereotypical chaotic behaviour pattern considered typical of them.<<

That\'s a good point and so is the rest of your argument, but I think letting the
player off by saying, "Just act like a human and we\'ll just suppose that\'s the
type of quirky Vargr you are," is a bit of a cop out.  I don\'t want to dictate
how other refs should run their campaigns, but playing aliens and trying to
emulate at least a portion of their unique personalities should be part of the
challenge.

Yes, there will be Vargr who are brought up in human society that will emulate
humans to a certain extent, but there are some things that are more \'nature\'
than \'nurture\' in all of us.  Some things are more instinctual for Vargr and
could not easily be extricated from their personalities no matter how much
exposure to human culture they\'ve had.

In my current campaign, the players are a group of Denebi mercenaries, including
several NPC Vargr.  The \'top dog\' (sorry!) is a sergeant named Tserok who has
worked long and hard to cement his position among the Vargr in the ranks as
"grand champion most-charismatic vargr."  Just recently, a player in the group
introduced a new character:  a Denebi Vargr cavalry officer.  The first thing
that happened was the NPC challenged him and subtly belittled him in front of
the rest of the platoon.

This sort of subtle infighting should be second nature to those Vargr who have
high charisma scores.  Humans may perceive this as antagonistic behavior, but in
truth it\'s the bread and butter of Vargr society.  Striving for the top is what
makes them a successful starfaring race.  Vargr of lower charisma probably
wouldn\'t even try to compete; they\'d just accept their roles and submit more or
less to the will of more charismatic people.

The above situation and other expressions of what makes Vargr unique offers
great roleplaying potential for a player to slip into his role and explore what
being a Vargr is all about.

        I think the whole point about what to do in a more _complex_
environment is what to do with _people_ ... are you going to put an IFF
device on every single human in a city you\'re conquering? How do you make
sure none of the resistance gets one? How are you going to hold and control
a city without infantry? Sure, you can nuke it if you don\'t want to keep it.
But you have to have folks on the ground.

        GDW published TNE. GDW is out of business. DEMONSTRATE A CAUSAL
CONNECTION! You can\'t. For all that can be proven, MT and later TNE kept GDW
alive for just that much longer. There are simply too many factors involved,

market others have mentioned.

        I\'m not disagreeing with you. I support a "simple" design system.
Yes, I like a detailed system. Doesn\'t mean I want to deny you what you
want. Yet by saying "I don\'t like FF&S, therefore kill it, because nobody
else should like it either" you aren\'t willing to extend me the same
courtesy. Fine. I\'ll defend my position and yours, without expecting the
same back.

        Further beating of this dead horse should be done direct to me via
e-mail, as the rest of the list is apparently uninterested.

Much of the advantage of Bri\'s drone vs. published tanks comes from the fact
that mass driver cannon are still so much better than fusion guns (does
a 3-cm mass driver really have a penetration of 504? Wheeg.) A tank with
the same gun could kill the drone, and victory would go to whichever one
shot/hit first; the drone gets an extra -1 DM to be hit, that\'s all,
but a tank could carry two or three slightly smaller guns with penetrations
in the 300 and perhaps higher ROFs. (Moral is mostly the paper-scissiors-stone
one that you can always design a custom weapon system to take out another
custom weapon system.)

One interesting option to make infantry more useful: allow fire control
systems on battle armor, that can apply their ranges and DMs to built-in
and carried weapons. (The fire control computer takes over the battle dress\'s
arms and aims the weapon accordingly.)

        I was not telling him he has never produced anything worthwhile. In
fact, I did not comment at all on on what he has produced. I commented on
what to me appeared to be an attitude that, since it wasn\'t worthwhile in
his campaigns, it shouldn\'t be worthwhile in anybody\'s campaigns. Once

        Perhaps. But even though TNE was not written by Mr. Miller, he has
stated it will remain part of Traveller. Whether he provides a detailed
design system a la FF&S remains yet to be seen.

        Further flames may be directed to me personally, to save the mailing
list.

Umm, no, laser guided bombs run $3k to $12k except for the GBU-28(29?)
which they custom-built to take out those deep bunkers.

A few of the long range standoff precision guided munitions cost
in the neighborhood of $1m (SLAM).  Most of them are under $100k,
with a few over that (JSOW, a few others).  Laser guided bombs
are dirt cheap.  Even Maverick missiles are pretty cheap...

(Try making one in FF&S, it\'s roughly accurage in the $1-2 per Cr
translation range 8-)

 True.  In any sophont species, I think there\'s going to be a lot
 of variation.  Even in SF stories where the society was
 genetically identical (a world of clones, IOW), there was some
 individual variation, most likely due to differing life
 experiences.  Heck, even identical twins have differing life
 experiences starting at zero seconds after the mind is capable pf
 perceiving its surroundings - if nothing else, they occupy
 differing positions in spacetime.

 True, but with a distinctly Vargr cast to them - A lot of the
 "wolfy" traits of domesticated canines of all species are pretty
 conclusively believed to be genetically programmed.  It\'s
 reasonable to assume the same for the Vargr, who are, after all,
 essentially Terran canines.

 Incidentally, has anyone noticed that the Old Norse word for
 "wolf" is "vargr", and that the modern Scandinavian tongues use
 variations of that same word for the same purpose even today?  Is
 Marc Miller perhaps a linguist, even amateur?

T::>Run him like a human, just has cool looking fur.  Just dont make him "Go

 Not quite, IMO.  More like, "run him as a certain kind of human" -
 the kind of human who is no more or less certain of his
 _capabilities_ than "normal" (for a human), but who has a somewhat
 stronger drive to do things for superiors that will earn their
 approval (_not_ necessarily their respect), and to do things that
 will emphasize his dominance over his subordinates.  Expect him to
 play "political/social dominance" games with his "equals" until it
 is clearly shown just what the relative Charisma between them is.

  To all those who have benefited from the data previously
  transmitted from the RICE Archives:

  Although the Regency Institute for Cultural Education is a
  quasi-governmental organization, we have been dependent on
  private funding to carry out the activities called for in our
  charter.  As a result, we have been somewhat limited in our
  ability to make the information in our archives readily
  available.

  This situation has been alleviated somewhat.  We have been using
  a private data service for our transmissions; this service has
  recently upgraded its capabilities with regards to allowing its
  clients to make information available (without upgrading the
  costs!).  Portions of our archives are now available directly on
  the Web, and as we are able to convert other information to a
  Web-acceptable format, more will become available.  We therefore
  invite researchers and travellers from all over the Regency, and
  the other Spinward States where Web access is available, to visit
  the Rice Archives On-Line.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is
  http://www.execnet.com/~jeffz/travellr.html (note carefully the
  spelling!).

  Currently, the RICE information that is available is in a
  somewhat crude format; we will be working to improve the
  presentation as time and resources allow.  To this end, we are
  requesting that any previously published RICE Papers that do not
  currently appear in our archives be sent to the Chief Archivist
  under separate cover (mailto:jeff.zeitlin@execnet.com); RICE
  Papers published in the future on the Traveller\'s Mailing List
  will be captured and made available.  For the record, the RICE
  Papers currently available are those on RICE itself, Deneb,
  Emerald, Glisten, the Iper\'mar Nomads, Menorb, Nutema,
  Persephone, and the Universal Extended Starport Profile.  The
  Glisten and UESP Papers have undergone recent revision; the
  revisions have not as yet been transmitted to the Traveller\'s
  Mailing List.

  We also would appreciate contributions of renderings, in GIF
  format, of planetary seals for planets for which RICE Papers have
  been published.  These may be sent to the Chief Archivist at the
  address above.

  We wish to thank those who have in the past assisted RICE in
  making this information available, and hope that they will
  continue to do so in the future.

Are you absolutely sure about that?  I remember reading that those
missles were indeed custom built (they hadn\'t even been fully developed by
the beginning of the "conflict") and I remember the pricetag being much
MUCH higher that $3000.  Also, the Phoenix missles that are standard
armament on the Tomcat cost a ton of money.  But that\'s the military.
The military is not into cutting costs, they spend a lot of money on what
they do spend it on because that stuff LASTS.  Granted, some of the stuff
has been flops (can you say SDI), but for the most part, the United
States military is an extremely efficient force (my hat\'s off to them).

"The parties herein have agreed to disagree" about your figures and mine
;)  I\'ll see if I can dig up anything official just for the sake of knowing.

Still, in favor of 5 MCr pricetag for the drone: the drone has increased
expendability, is cheaper than any human piloted craft, apparently does
more damage (watching the debate over it\'s armament), and, the most
important aspect----multiple drones can be overseen by relatively few
operators, giving infantry ground forces more bang (pun intended) for the
buck.  That drone looks like something the Marines would be drooling
over, what with their desire for high mobility (hopefully low
maintenance) weaponry.

You might ask the same question today.  The job of the infantry isn\'t to win
battles, it is to hold ground.  It is a tremendous waste of resources to
attack infantry with a tank, especially when that infantry have ATGMs,
artillery and air support on call, and are in prepared positions.

Picture this:  You are riding to victory in your multi-million ruble T-72
when WHAM!  A LAW rocket blows your right tread off.  Your war machine is
now a paper weight, and will soon attrack all sorts of attention.  I\'m
certain that the 57th Century groundpounders will have a complete bag of
tricks for dealing with pesky grav tanks.  (Example:  One shot fusion mine,
triggered by a CG field passing overhead in NOE)

Digression:  Many gamers and artists put *all* their troops in battledress
or some other type of sealed armor.  Take a look at the cost breakdown of
equipping an infantry divison (8-14,000 troops) with BD and fusion weapons.
Now see how many troops you could outfit with Combat Enviroment Suits and
Gauss Rifles for the same cost.  At a nearly 25:1 advantage, the more
"lightly" armed force wins every time.

The basic jobs of the combat arms:

Infantry: Take and hold ground
Armor: Close with and destoy the enemy
Artillery: Kill and supress the enemy.

That\'s a good point and so is the rest of your argument, but I think
letting the player off by saying, "Just act like a human and we\'ll just

I don\'t want to dictate how other refs should run their campaigns, but
playing aliens and trying to emulate at least a portion of their unique
personalities should be part of the challenge.

I could not agree more.  I was not implying that Vargr should be
played in any way desired at any time.  I was speaking to Paul\'s
particular situation (was it Paul who posted this question originally? I\'m
not sure.).  Most Vargr will have Vargr tendencies as spelled out in the
Alien module, but because of great variability, just about anything is
possible on an individual basis.  This is true of all races, and even more
so of the Vargr (IMO).

The challenge of roleplaying an actual alien with alien
motivations and an alien psyche is one of the best parts of Traveller.
But the Vargr were specifically made easy to roleplay by having them be so
chaotic that just about anything is allowed on an individual basis
(there\'s a quote to this effect in the Vargr module somewhere, but I don\'t
have it with me).  Still, your point is well taken:  carrying this sort of
thing too far leads to Vargr being humans in furry suits.

You can represent this by a level-0 skill, as used in MT. In MT char gen,
characters are given a set of level-0 skills depending on the
characteristics of their homeworld (eg. TL 8, Wheeled Vehicle-0: TL 10+, Grav
Vehicle-0, etc).

Totally unskilled charaters have the difficulty level raised by one (Simple
becomes Routine, etc). Level-0 gives you no bonuses, BUT the difficulty is
not increased.

BTW, my players have found that the MT system was OK, but the TNE system is
easier to use. In MT, you need to divide your stat by 5, add it to your
skill, then roll and add that number, then remember another set of numbers
for success (3-7-11-15-19) - 4 steps. In TNE, your asset is
already known: you just *2 for Routine and roll under it - 2 steps.

MT is more flexible - a skill is not tied to a stat - but TNE is easier.
It is also possible to succeed in an Impossible task (rolling a 1) which
is not possible AT ALL in MT.

In all the "is not!" - "is too!" debate over the canonical status of
HePLaR drives vs. thruster plates, I\'ve seen little discussion -- some,
but very little -- about the tactical and strategic implications of this
drive change.  It seems to me that moving from practically free (in
energy and reaction mass), practically limitless (months/years of
duration, regardless of use) drives to very energy/mass expensive, very
limited drives must have major military implications.  Here are some of
my musings on the topic.

First off, assume that a "standard" wartime fleet engagement consists of
an Intruder fleet (I-fleet) jumping into a star system and attempting to
control the mainworld -- where control might mean interdicting,
bombarding, landing troops on, or whatever.  Meanwhile, a Native fleet
(N-fleet) is attempting to stop this from happening.

Book Five, High Guard, took its title from a (formerly) canonical element
of fleet doctrine in such engagements.  Where possible, it was presumed
that the I-fleet would jump in-system near a gas giant, allowing immediate
refueling of tanks emptied by the jump -- thereby giving the I-fleet the
option of running away at need, important to any competent commander.
However, ships doing wilderness refueling at a GG are vulnerable -- in
atmosphere, deep in a g-well, etc. -- so other ships would orbit above
them, covering their refueling in the "High Guard" position.  Nice
concept.

Alas, it all starts to fall apart under HePLaR.  In the Good Old Days of
thruster plates, you could refuel at the GG, then burn in-system at max
gee, flip over at midpoint, then decelerate at max gee the rest of the
way, arriving with tanks still full at the mainworld a couple of days
later.  Try that in a HePLaR ship and your fuel gauge will be on E before
you\'ve cleared the GG\'s outer moons (okay, I\'m exaggerating -- but you
see my point).  Instead, you have to boost a bit, coast a *long* time,
then reverse thrust a bit, arriving at the MW with slightly low tanks,
but (hopefully) still enough to maneuver and jump.

Now, for a good healthy GG/MW separation, and using a typical ship, while
maintaining adequate fuel reserves to fight and leave, we\'re talking
*weeks* of travel to get to the MW!  Now huge amounts of canon --
including the game Fifth Frontier War, along with lots of other background
material -- are based on the military rhythm of one week jumping, one week
playing around in-system.  The whole pace of strategic action falls apart
if you spend a week tavelling between the stars, then most of the rest of
a month plodding around in your target system.

I see two extremes available to fleet commanders, with endless room for
optimization in between:

(1) Hypercautious: Jump to GG, refuel, then slide in *slow* to inner
system, arriving with tanks nearly full.
    ADVANTAGE:    Lots of options stay open as long as possible.
    DISADVANTAGE: Conflict is over before your first assaults take place --
and it didn\'t end in your favor.

(2) Hyperoptimistic: Jump directly to MW.  Win.  Refuel at leisure from
oceans or captured facilities on MW.
    ADVANTAGE:    Maximum pace of strategic advance...possible to jump
in, paste the natives, refuel, and be on your way to the next system in
just a day or two.
    DISADVANTAGE: You\'re in deep dudou (a noxious weed found on many
worlds in Lanth and Vilis subsectors) if the natives start winning.

My point is, if we accept HePLaR, we really need to take a serious new
look at naval tactics.  Anybody want to extend or refute my analysis? I
haven\'t even mentioned the interesting possibilities of in-system jumps
yet -- Douglas, you up to handling that?

First let\'s throw out, then forget the fact that limitless delta v makes
KE weapons really, really frightening.  That\'s a whole can-o-worms with
thruster plates.

[stuff about HG and GG refueling snipped]

Well, 2 things.  One, GG refueling as a "real" behavior (TCS players
jump in here) was always kinda dubious tactically, FFW mechanics not
withstanding.

Two, if this does take place, it\'s no safer jumping first to the GG
since the MW _knows_ they have to go there.  The GG is defended,
heavily, and why not?  The I-Fleet _must_ refuel, and you can wait and
cream \'em when they try.

[stuff about GG refueling not happening due to delta v limits on ships
under HEPlaR snipped]

Now, you\'re right, the jump, refuel, drive on in is trashed.  But when
HEPlaR I-fleets jump in they really need to refuel.  Badly.  They are
forced to fight if the fuel is defended, and they are forced to right
away since time is on the defender\'s side.  Given the so-so nature of GG
fueling in CT, it makes, if anything, more sense with HEPlaR!  It\'s much
easier to skim a GG than it is to land on the mainworld for fuel.  And
given either history the GG is heavily defended (under the assumption it
would really be used).

In CT, you may as well go for the mainworld right off:

Scenario 1
I-fleet jumps to GG.  GG heavily defended (everyone jumps to the GG,
it\'s important!).  I-fleet fights.  If it loses, they\'re dead.  If it
wins, they fuel. Then I-fleet attacks mainworld.  Same kind of fight,
but this time they can leave.

Scenario 2
I-fleet jumps to mainworld.  MW heavily defended (we can\'t lose MW!).
I-fleet fights.  If they lose, they\'re dead.  If they win, they can
fuel.  If they want, they can go fight again at the GG (why?).

TNE Scenario 1
I-fleet jumps to GG.  GG heavily defended.  I-fleet fights to fuel.  If
they lose, they\'re dead.  If they win, they fuel.  Jump to MW.  Fight
again.  It\'s a small jump, so they can jump back to GG if they need to.

TNE Scenario 2
I-fleet jumps to MW.  MW heavily defended.  Fight or die.  Ends up the
same as Scenario 2 above.

The problem is that if GG refueling is sooo important, then the GG will
be defended very well, and for good reason. In both cases the ships that
fuel up before tackling MW have more options than the direct attack.
GG attacks will warn MW regardless, but in the CT example they will be
heading to MW for sure (just watch \'em get bigger in the telescope).  In
the TNE example, you\'ll see them disappear on the telescope and wonder
if they\'re jumping to MW, or off to another system.

My few credits worth to be torn to shreds :-)

Are there any rules out there for in-system micro-jumps.

For instance, moving from orbit 7 to orbit 10 at a modest 15G-hours of
acceleration (necessitating 15g-hours of deceleration) it would take
close to a year (which reflects reality).  So how much fuel does a
micro-jump take for this distance (which is covered in only a week)?

pick off small enemy units without destroying the entire

allows the enemy to get their (perhaps weaker) anti-tank (or anti-robot?)

All such weapons have their place but they are not a \'universal\' solution.
It should also be noted that such high tech robots require high tech worlds

Lastly, I seem to remember that the Imperium (and hence perhaps the Regency
in TNE times) had quite strict laws about robots, i.e. any true AI robot had
the same rights as a living being, and also that (due to some trojan horse
robot exploding and destroying a major war vessel many years back in
Imperial history) there were limitations on their use and armament. I think
these are given in the MT Encyclopaedia - I remember researching them for an
Geneering/Robotics article for the Traveller Chronicle.

On the subject of the penetrations making drone/mass-driver/Trepida grav
tank such short combats based on who fires first wins, this is probably a
fairly accurate reflection of modern tank combat, as experienced in the Gulf

Iraqi tanks operational. Technology in modern weaponry really can be that

A good point. Surely the SSMM (Society for the Supremacy of Man over
Machine, an organisation traditional associated mainly with Solomani
supremacist groups) is bound to be one of the most powerful political
pressure groups in the Regency.
Mind you, given the traditionally ultra-conservative nature of the SSMM,
it\'s hard to visualise them suddenly accepting joyfully the need for
genetically engineered superbrains (especially with the SSMM\'s
traditionally Solomani background and the Solomani attitude to genereed
supermen as a result of the Gene War).
However, there are quite a few Megacorporations with a vested interest
in the continuing use of computers, as well as groups opposed to
geneering. It isn\'t quite as clear-cut as all that. And there are
religious pro-Technology groups like the Apostles of Clarke\'s Law.
I suspect that computers are here to stay in the Traveller universe.

The Empress Wave (EW) is an idea which we will have absolutely huge
difficulties reconciling with canonical information presented in sources
like Zhodani (GDW), Vilani & Vargr (DGP), Vargr (GDW) and others.

Facts about the EW are (per the RSB) ...
1. It is a light speed wave coming from the region of the galactic core.
2. It is supposedly responsible for the outflow of refugees from the
Zhodani Consulate to the Regency.
3. First signs of the EW are visible around 1115 or thereabouts.
4. The EW will arrive at the 1116 border in around 1205.

First, a few astrographical facts to screw up the EW.

Distances coreward from the old Imperial border :-
To Zhodani Chtierabl sector 300 pc
To Zhodani Itvikiastaf sector (coremost sector of main part of ZC) 80 pc
To coreward edge of the pro-Imperial Thoengling Empire 30 pc
To coreward edge of Varroerth Empire 90 pc
To coreward edge of Julian Protectorate 45 pc

At light speed, it takes over 3 years to cover one hex, 130 years to
travel from coreward to rimward across a sector. The EW should
therefore have begun impacting the above areas quite a while ago. The
approximate year that the EW should have reached various places is
listed below.
Coreward edge of Zhodani Chtierabl sector in 227 Imperial
Coreward edge of Zhodani Itvikiastaf sector in 944 Imperial
Coreward edge of Thoengling Empire (Gvurrdon sector) in 1107 Imperial
Coreward edge of Varroerth Empire (Knaeleng sector) in 912 Imperial
Coreward edge of Julian Protectorate (Trenchan sector) in 1060 Imperial
Lair planetary system in 1081 Imperial
Arrived in 2000 Worlds circa 1080-ish (Transrift outposts)

Now, call me an naive balding old dimwit if you like, but I think that
someone might just have noticed the apocalyptic events occurring (or
not) at Lair in the 1080s. Therefore, when (or if) the EW reached such
backwater unknown places as Lair and Gashikan, no-one noticed it. Hmm.

When the EW passed through the rimward parts of Gvurrdon in the 1150s,
no-one seems to have noticed it either.

Now, unless the arrival of the wave in Itvikiastaf triggered the 3rd
Frontier War and at Lair the 4th, I can\'t help thinking that this is a
piece of nonsense.

Given the general concurrence that the background of Traveller is a good
deal more important than the minutiae of the rules, this is probably one
of the bigger problematica in TTNE (Traveller : The Nilsen Era).

Well, if people "don\'t know a game" they mostly neither know rules nor
background. So they shouldn\'t bother. If they do, why do the take part in an
demonstration? Of course you could demo a game background without its rules
or do it the other way around. At isn\'t the main point, IMHO.

A common background helps to "unify" the players of a game, being the commom
part to talk about without long explanations. This is the base ground to
exchange experiences and adventures. Most people realize that rules aren\'t
that important and so background is the last (not least) common denominator.

>What it comes down to is: a rules set without a background is just a

I wouldn\'t subscribe to this. Is GURPS a wargame? Don\'t confuse the rule
system with only combat rules. They aren\'t that important. A game (or
gamers) without imagination become a wargame!

This, I would subscribe. I also would extent it to games published by GDW :-)

I would claim that a game with too much detailed background will kill
imagination and creatism and playing it becomes like watching TV. You
passively consume entertainment. It\'s fine, but I think it\'s too little and
I\'m expecting more from a rpg.

I agree, that no background at all will be the wrong decission, but
background info should challenge the players to think about and be become
creative and not to make them only to read one book after the other,
"eating" other people\'s ideas.

With CT there were great "blank regions" where players could add their own
ideas. This led to a lot of creative contributions to the setting.

With TNE, GDW refused any help, announcing to provide the whole, complete
story of their game, driving all players to the audience seats only. IMHO, a
bad move and wrong decission I hope which will not repeated with T4.

A statement, what parts of the background are up to the players and will
(probably) never offically developed by the publisher would be of more help
than some announcements of new supplements. Speculating what\'s about that
back curtain thing is, I think, more interesting than demanding yet another
source book about that matter.

To come to a point, have some background but not too much. Help the players
to become creative participants but no consuming audiance. Use background as
common denominator but don\'t explain every mystery away.

    'body' => 'Hi!

Although my problem isn\'t directly related to the official Traveller
universe, it might be interesting for some of you to tinker around with it.
I\'m looking for a practical procedure to enforce an interstellar neutral
zone, preventing ships to enter it.

My universe is quite similar to the official one, although a bit more
peaceful. My Imperium had no major conflict for to last four decades. (which
was an independence war which the Imperium let successfully happen.) The
last interstellar war was fought against the Estadh of Bezidhar
(reptilian-like creatures, a race unknown in Traveller) about 100 years ago.
It was the Bezidhann who offered peace, aborting their attack war against
the Imperium. They demanded a 10 parsec deep neutral zone of no-man\'s land
in the former war zone, prohibiting any further Imperial settlements in
these regions. It\'s up to the Imperium to keep it\'s people away from that
subsectors. The Estadh will patrol the other border, announcing a ninth war
if any kind of activity will be detected. They didn\'t want any further
contact to neither military nor civil ships of the Imperium.

At the time of the war, the Imperium lasted already for some 850 years. The
time before was the Long Night, which followed the decay of the great
Fwilani trading empire. The Imperium reached TL 14. The Bezidhann were at
TL15. They initiated eight attack wars against the Imperium (for unknown
reasons) with overwhelming forces. The Imperium could barely defend itself.
It was the Imperium\'s fortune that the Estadh\'s fleets always had major
problems with supply and could eventually fought off. The Bezidhann Wars
ended 885, at this time the Imperium also had access to TL15 technologies.
This didn\'t changed very much until now, which is 986.

One big difference to Traveller is jump time in my universe. It is depend to
ship volume. The larger the star ship, the longer the time.

Jh = log(t)^3 + 60 + 1D6
Jh: jump time in hours
t: ships displacement tons
1D6: a random factor

(ships with less than 10t are too instable to jump)

This makes a jump taking about 3-4 days for smaller ships. Larger ships with
more than 100,000t are slower as in Traveller and it\'s possible to overtake
a larger ship.

As a consequence, most Imperial war ships are about 1,000t - 20,000t.
Bezidhann ships were larger. The largest ship of the Estadh was the T-Rex
with a displacement of 80,000t. Their jump time will be calculated as
(log(t)^3)/2 + 60 + 1D6 and the lower limit is 20t because jump stress is
greater. The Estadh probably already reached TL16 at 986.

I\'m not sure if it should be possible to detect done jumps and if, how long
after the jump it\'s detectable. Should it be possible to determine the
targeted exit point and/or the jump distance?  If it\'s useful for explaining
the border blockade, I\'ll introduce such rules.

At 986, after 100 years, this former iron wall is full of hole as a
moth-eaten curtain. In the meantime, the majority of the worlds near this
border declared independent (which the empress let taken place), fought each
other or had other duties than maintaining a border patrol.  Only a handful
Imperial worlds and fleet depots keep the flag. However, officially they all
still respect the border.

I\'m interested in the beginning of that project to close a part of space, as
large as three (some 30 parsec high and 10 parsec wide) subsectors. Any ideas?

Thanks,
bye

I can see how stationary jumps would have some military value.  It would
be a very simple way to hide a large force in system.

I don\'t think that there is anything in the RSB which would suggest that
the Regency Navy is any more reliant on reservists than the Imperial
Navy. The old Imperial organisation called for one Reserve Fleet per
subsector made up of <<colonial>> (Reserve in the warm & fuzzy New Era I
think) squadrons based at HiPop EarlyStellar+ worlds. Based on the orbat
in Fifth Frontier War, the fleets in the Spinward Marches only comprised
one or two each of BatRons and CruRons, along with however many light
cruisers, destroyers and escorts. In the higher-threat environment of
the Virus threat, I would imagine that the average strength of fleets
along the frontier would be higher than in the lazy days before the
Fifth Frontier War.

FFW shows some sizes for SDB forces and for Colonial/Reserve units. Data
supplied on request.

I don\'t imagine that a defense in depth with mobile reserves, as
suggested here, would meet with much favour. The frontier would be
better being rigidly defended with large numbers of fighters, SDBs and
monitors/battleriders and static defences (deep mounts, mines et al)
deployed in all the systems in and near the frontier. The mobile fleet
units in the RQDs would, as suggested in the RSB, carry out offensive
sweeps into the Wilds looking for trouble. God (or maybe Dave Nilsen)
alone knows what the Swing Fleets and similar deep reserves are for.
Given the inevitable lags in communication, a mobile defense is (as
shown in the case of Trin) no defense at all. <<! No pasaran !>>, <<Ils
ne passeront pas>>, <<Not a Step Back>>, and all that sort of stuff.

There is no particularly good way to estimate the size of the Regency\'s
naval forces. The suggestion in TCS is that naval forces would be equal
to ten times the annual construction capacity of a world/state (IIRC).
This, if applied to the Regency, would result in billions upon billions
of UCP tonnes of starships. I doubt that sufficient crews could be found
to man them ! Alternatively, one could make assumptions about the amount
of money spent on the Navy and RQS using the rules in Striker, or about
the sophontpower strength of these forces using a WAG. One thing is
certain, if the Regency was short of warships in the 1120s, it\'s had 75
years to build all the ships that anyone could ever want.

Notes.
Extent :- this analysis includes ONLY HiPop worlds. The impact of all
other worlds in the Regency is assumed to be minimal.
Population :- this is the exact value of TPPG value * UWP Pop Value. To
account for all rounding errors in the TPPG value, 0.5 could reasonably
be added to the multiplier.
GPP :- in TeraCredits (millions of MegaCredits), adjusted for TechLevel,
trade classifications and starport as in (original) Striker. For TL-G
worlds a value of 1.1 was extrapolated as the exchange rate.
Yard Capacity :- as for Trillion Credit Squadron. The value shown is in
trillions (I think) of UCP tonnes capacity. No adjustment made for
government type and peace/war multipliers shown in TCS due to the
problem of balkanised government codes. The net effects of these
simplifications are probably minimal if you feel the Regency is in a war
situation. If not, reduce this value by 10 to 15 per cent.
TL :- weighted by population. Effectively the average TL of the average
Regency citizen.
Yard TL :- weighted by yard capacity. Effectively the average TL of
ships being built.

While formulae were supplied in the New Era (Path of Tears ?) for
calculating the strength of planetary forces, I feel that these give
absurd results for any <<civilised>> state. I suggest that the use of
those formulae is only reasonable for low technology (PreStellar or
less) worlds in the wilds, so I haven\'t included the results.
========================================================================
*** Stand Down *** Dull UWP analysis over.

As for the number of ships in reserve - huge. Think of the USN in the
1960s and 1970s with hordes of aging ships left over from the last big
war (or big rearmament push) and imagine the same thing with ship lives
extended and a far bigger navy !
Ships would be stored at the various depots (Macene, Pashus, Depot
Deneb) as well as the the ISFs at Moran, Trin and wherever else. TD7
states that the Dynam Depot ISF in Lishun had about 1000 ships in
reserve, and not just TL14 obsolescent ones. Arrival Vengeance and the
RSB suggest a huge number of ships at Trin (enough that losing a
60kiloton cruiser goes unnoticed). The Nail Mission scenario outline in
MT suggests similarly vast numbers of ships (to me anyway). IIRC there
are descriptions of depots in TD7 as mentioned, MT and the MTJ3 (Depot
Corridor).

Given that starships can and do last centuries when mothballed (cf
Azhanti High Lightning, Darrians), there are likely to be a awful lot of
ships in store throughout the Regency, an awful lot of which are all but
useless. The main problem will be finding trained crews to man them.

One way that big enough reserves of crews could be mustered is by a
system like the Solomani had, of a Home Guard of slightly trained
reservists. For TTNE the Home Guard could be represented by requiring
secondary activities in the 1st and 2nd terms to be used to buy suitable
military skills. That\'s suitable for the military, not the character of
course. Most Home Guard-type reservists would probably crew deep mounts,
sensor platforms and SDBs or serve in supply, admin or maintenance
units.

Which brings me to a question. Was the draft in CT/MT just a convention
of did the Imperium really conscript people into the Army, Navy and
Marines ?

This is something of what I had in mind.  Especially the

> who has a somewhat

part.  I thought the idea would be that Vargr from Vargr societies behave
like wolves in wolf packs, that is CHR dominated and some infighting between
close CHR\'s, and that Vargr from Human societies behave like domesticated
canines, that is devotion to leaders "owner" and somewhat of a protective
guardian.

With this in mind, I wrote a profile (as in Personalities of the RC) on the
particular Vargr in question.  While most of it is very rough, this is what
I wrote about the Vargr and his relationship to the PC leader.  The Vargr\'s
name is Grrath(open to suggestions) and the PC leader is Jason.  (Grrath is
about 12 years older than Jason)

        Personality:  Grrath is rarely seen apart from the Jason.  His feelings
        toward the Human are mixed.  He feels that He is indebted to
        Jason because Jason helped him find his parents murderers, and at the
        same time he feels responsible for Jason\'s wellbeing as he had been for
        so long when the two were children playing together.  These two forces
        combine to create an impressive tie of loyalty to the Jason.  Even
        through the bonds of loyalty, Grrath has a strong desire to be reunited
        with his race.  He often dreams that one day he might have the
ability to
        meet others of his own kind and learn more about what his people are
        like.

I appreciate everyone\'s comments so far and I have learned more about Vargr.
I would like to get my hands on some of the published materials available on
Vargr.  If anyone knows where I might get a copy cheaply, please let me know.

Thanks for your help everyone.

1) It\'s true that the gas giant will be defended, but will it be defended

especially if there are more than a couple of gas giants.  In the Sol
system, you\'d be spreading yourself thin to cover Earth and 4 GGs (not to
mention colonies).  In other systems, you\'d also have to cover any planets
or moons with appreciable water coverage.  Also, couldn\'t a large fleet
jump into the asteroid belt or Oort cloud, melt an ice-asteroid and dip
from it (just a thought, this may be full of holes)?  Basically, I
think covering all sources of fuel with effective numbers would be
difficult.

2) Refueling at the GG then jumping in system would require 1 whole
parsec\'s worth of fuel according to what I\'ve read.  I\'m not sure, but I
think Merrick was implying that a short jump in system would require only
a fraction of this.  Sorry if I misinterpreted.

   Once again Phil, you prove how wonderfully intelligent and articulate

   Everyone is *really* tired of the whole pile of BS, and in particular the

   As for the particulars of your comments:

   Perhaps, except for the fact that 2300AD wasn\'t exclusively
Frank\'s--Marc Miller had a major role in this project as well.

   As for the other products you mention, Frank had varying degrees of
involvement in all of them, but wasn\'t necessarily the primary author.

   No one supplement or publication will keep a game company in
business, otherwise GDW will still be living off the glory of their
Operation Desert Storm Factbook which made the New York Times Best
Seller List.  The fact that one particular supplement can\'t save a company
doesn\'t make it any less valuable to any one fan of the game.  Atlas of
the Imperium never sold particularly well, but if you want a head start
on creating sector stats, there is no substitute.

>And the Trading Card caused slump in the RPG industry isn\'t valid, as all
>the other dogs died pre-TC games.

   No two gaming industry experts agree on the exact impact of the
growth of the collectable card industry, but most agree that it did cause
many hobby stores to decrease the amount of other materials they
carried so that they could make room for more collectable card games.
Without question at least some money that consumers would have
spent on other things (like RPG supplements) went instead to buying
additional ``booster`` packets for CCGs.  Pinning down exact dollar
figures is tricky at best, but there was at least some impact.

   No one person will save any game, nor will any one special interest
group.  A RPG has to appeal to many different types of people to be
successful--yes, including the people who like to tinker.  The Chadwick/
Nilsen regime took a creative gamble in coming up with the TNE storyline.
That in no way invalidates the mechanics behind it.

>*Blunt Hairpins* and *CattleCarriers* (the boardgames) I regard as
>entirely non-canon as they have HePlaR. Fine. *You* like it. Wonderful.

   As did a *lot* of other people.  As for HePlaR, I liked the fact that it was
more realistic, but always felt uncomfortable with the ``gas mileage`` it
got.  I\'m sorry they cause you so much personal heartbreak.

>But TNE was a joke

   Maybe to people who concluded that Traveller died about 1987.  Which
makes me wonder why you even picked up TNE--habit perhaps?  There
had to be something about it other than the Traveller logo that made you
want to buy anything more than just the basic sourcebook, which
apparently you did.

   Or you, Phil.  It is quite likely the new Traveller will not be exactly what
anybody wants.  It is entirely possible that design sequences similar to
those in TNE will be included--probably not in the basic book, but later on.
After all, somebody at GDW felt it necessary to come out with Striker,
Mercenary, High Guard, Merchant Prince, etc. at some point.

>What it boils down to, I suppose, is that we\'ll have to agree to

   Roger that.  Honestly I don\'t know how you can expect to launch
missiles against TNE on this mailing list and not expect to get some
serious return fire.

above, then e-mail direct to hdhale@tasc.com  , don\'t bother people

<the rest snipped>

For a J3 or J4 starship, what is the fuel cost of an in-system jump from
the GG to MW? I would guess it is only as much as an old CT/MT ship used
in buring its thrusters for a week when PP fuel was a major consideration.

Also, how often is refuelling at the GG and then travelling to the MW the
actual scenario? I don\'t know, but I would guess that the number of
systems without a GG combined with the number where the MW orbits the GG
is quite large. In both these cases, there is no change to cannon.

So as for a lack of GG refueling with HEPlaR, and the speed of advance
slowing down:

1) use a micro-jump to get to the MW. It takes about the same amount of
time to get there as in CT/MT, and still leaves you with enough fuel to
jump out again.

2) refuelling at the GG is even more vital, so it is hardly going to
disappear. Anyway, in CT/MT weren\'t the GGs themselves the object of many
battles. As they are so vital to an attacking fleet, they are as heavily
defended as the mainworld itself.

I think that HEPlaR adds significantly to the realism of space combat in
TNE, and it doesn\'t call for any particular differences in starship
operation. The routine for the attcking fleet is the same as it always
has been:

1) you jump in
2) you fight to refuel at the GG
3) you travel to the MW with enough fuel to jump out if required (just
   uses a micro-jump instead of M-drives)
4) you fight for the MW
5) if you lose you jumpo out, if you win you wait for reinforcements etc.

Any other thoughts?

CHINA \'PIRATE\' SHIP HELD

The philippine Navy seized a suspected Chinese pirate ship and
its 20 crewmen over the weekend after they tried to ram a navy boat in a
gun battle north-west of Manila, Reuter reports from Manila.  There were
no casualties in the second sea clash in three weeks between the
Philippine Navy and suspected Chinese vessels off the Subic Bay free
port, an area notorious for pirates.
Two navy patrol ships and a gunboat engaged the vessel, driving
it back to land with heavy gunfire.  Capt Ernesto de Leon, who commanded
the navy force, personally briefed Presdient Fidel Ramos on the incident.

That is how ity was first released: as Man To Man, a cpmbat wargame with

As for the Epress wave, it definitely violates the "Traveller history must

This seems to be the I-fleet\'s most vulnerable point. The only options for
the I-fleet are win or die. If I was an Admiral, I would do whatever it took
to give myself some more options at this point.

However, the only immediately obvious solution is to have my ships built
with large enough fuel tanks to make the initial jump and also to jump back
in case a bug out is necessary. Assuming the I-fleet and N-fleet have
similar tech levels and similar Rated ships, I will get wasted since my
N-fleet counterpart can load up his ships with weapons, while I have to load
mine up with fuel. What you get is a "WWI" or "U.S. Civil War" situation
regarding tactics and strategy; it is almost impossible for a frontal attack
to succeed unless it has overwhelming numerical superiority (and even then,
the attackers\' losses will far outnumber the defenders\'). The attacker must
probe for weaknesses in the defense along a multi-system front, until
(hopefully) he finds a weakly-defended GG, and which point he hits it with
everything he has.

Possible solutions for this problem(?):
1. The "Drop Tank" option - Construct my ships with "drop tanks" that add
fuel without taking up space in the ship proper. This amounts to making
bigger (and more expensive) ships than my counterpart.
2. The "Battle Rider" option - Using the "Battle Rider" paradigm, and give
the tender the extra fuel, but not the carried ships. Your tenders will jump
in and can jump out, but can only bug out with the ships they can collect
before leaving. Sort of like carrier warfare in WW2.
3. The "Kamikaze" option - The first wave of ships aren\'t mean\'t to return.
They are suicide jockeys whose job is to take out the GG\'s defenses at any
cost. The main force will follow up the first wave at some later time,
assuming they win. As far as how I find out if they win or not, I\'m not
sure. Also, this suggestion is not entirely serious ;).

Well, this is my 2Cr. A very interesting topic, though, IMHO.

Regarding my previous "Butlerian Jyhad" post, I think that Mr. McLellean
mistook my post. When I said:

>In fact, a movement will arise whose goal is the eradication of all
>comuters (cf. the "Butlerian Jyhad" in Herbert\'s Dune series).

What I meant was that a movement would arise that insisted that all people\'s
homes be within walking distance of their place of work. This is also known
as the "Pedestrian Jyhad" :).

I, also, would be interested to see micro-jump ideas. Some of the tactics
posts have depended upon micro-jumps working.

I am designing an Ancient\'s starship.  This vessel is primarily used for
cargo transportation.  I have two main problems:

        1.  The Ancients used Jump Drives.  How advanced were they, and How
were
        they made.  I have two thoughts on this.  First, at TL-20, I don\'t think
        they would use a liquid hydrogen fuel for the drive, my guess is
that it
        would be run on antimatter, however; second, there is a good
arguement to
        be made that J-drives require the properties of the chemical
hydrogen to
        run.  In the first case, what is the size of the drive, and what is the
        amount of fuel required.  In the second case, How much hydrogen is
        necessary.  Some of the hydrogen is used to produce energy, this
could be
        replaced by antimatter.

        2.  The Ancients surely didn\'t use HePlaR.  I believe that they used
        thruster plates, but since thruster plates are no longer available
in the
        Traveller universe, what should this Ancient ship use for maneuver.  (I
        know there are strong feelings about this change in the universal
        absolutes, so to avoid arguementations, lets just say I don\'t want to
        violate the current (TNE) universal absolutes.) :)

I would appreciate some logical well thought out answers to these questions.
I\'m designing such a ship for an adventure, and any polite thoughts would
help.  Please direct all flames to mean2me@how.com?   :*)

 The Norris grav-tank costs MCr18.5, the Sprite combat drone costs MCr5.
The Norris grav-tank is 10dtonnes, the Sprite is .99(yea, for the bonus).
 So, for the cost of *one* Norris, you can have *4* Sprite\'s, and for the
storage space of *one* Norris(even more important in combat landings) you
can have *ten* Sprite\'s.

 Not much of a comparison if you ask me. The Norris is utterly and
totalley outclassed.
 Keep in mind also, the Sprite is small enoufgh for house-to-house fighting.

You might ask the same question today.  The job of the infantry isn\'t to win
battles, it is to hold ground.  It is a tremendous waste of resources to
attack infantry with a tank, especially when that infantry have ATGMs,
artillery and air support on call, and are in prepared positions.
--
 That\'s just the problem, in Traveller, armour has gone up
tremendousley(a factor of 5 at least) while missile damages have only
gone up by a factor of 2 at most.
 With the exception of tac nukes,(as I mentioned before) infantry
*can not* hurt properly armoured TL-15/16 vehicles.

Drones of the size and intelligence given in previous e-mails would not be
as suitable as normal troops for taking positions which you do not want to
devastate. When talking about combat in \'civilian\' areas, the massed
firepower of heavy fusion tanks (or robots) is useless if you are trying to
pick off small enemy units without destroying the entire
city/base/starport/whatever. Also, close-in combat within built-up areas
allows the enemy to get their (perhaps weaker) anti-tank (or anti-robot?)
weaponry so close to your tanks/robots that their armour suddenly doesn\'t
give them such a great advantage.
--
 That\'s just the thing, if you\'ll look at the drone I posted that started
this whole thing, it *dosen\'t* use fusion/plasma weaponry. It uses
mass-drivers, only slightley less precise then lasers(cept these won\'t
start fires in buildings).
 And if you show me man-portable, non tac-nuke weaponry that can take
this sucker, I\'ll be happy to aggree about urban combat.
 Even if you do, in a typicial fighter-like grav engagement, these drones
rule over previousley designed vehicles and tanks.
 As for Imperium laws about robots, you may be very well right. I never
said that these were full AIs, tho.

I\'m going to post some designs of mine at some point shortly,
to show some more FF&S inspired tank designs.  Not the good ones,
until I know for sure what\'s up with Steve Higginbotham\'s strategic
campaign, but some of the vehicles...

As a few general comments, the fusion weapons are about as bad a choice
as you can get for the main weapon.  I use (in mostly TL-10 designs)
a mixture of mass drivers, ETC cannons, lasers, and light meson cannon
(oh yes, life gets interesting... ;-).  Fusion guns don\'t cut it.
The standard background vehicles don\'t cut it either, they\'re lightly
enough armoured that you can pry them open with a TL-10 can opener.
I baseline a minimum of 500 for all around armor for tanks, if not 1000
or 2000.  Remember, in FF&S with gravitics, armor is basically free.
You just go slower.  You don\'t need supersonic tanks; honestly, doing
combat sims, my units can\'t deal with combat advances through hostile
terrain at faster than 200kph or so.  With that sort of speed, not having
all around armor kills you fast (because then you *do* run over and past
infantry in foxholes with AT missiles, who pop a shot into the rear or
belly and boom go the tank).  Not having armor 500 and up is exquisitely
poor planning... it\'s trivial to frontally penetrate the "book" TL-15
MBTs from the front with TL-8 and 9 and 10 weapons.

But in the CT universe, is it worth the protection?  Here\'s another
interesting monkey wrench to throw into the gears...

I need to do the math, but at turn-around what is the velocity of your
fleet zipping to MW with thruster plates gonna be?  MW will see you
coming (a single picket ship at each GG).  They will see you move, too.
There really isn\'t a good way to hide.  All they need do is throw some
missiles with clouds of small particles (sand, water, whatever) in your
path. Boom!

Yes, it would.  I haven\'t assumed better microjumps.  All military ships
are J3 at least.  That\'s 3 in-system jumps after they refuel.

Another tactic would be the use of tankers.  You jump to empty space 1
parsec from the target, top the tanks, then jump in with enough fuel to
bug out.  This is a good idea in either universe.

This presents interesting tactics:  you can commit all ships to GG
refueling for mutual protection (in which case none can jump to escape),
or you can send them in piecemeallll to smoke out the enemy.
Interesting.

fusion power, but at TL 16+, antimatter power becomes available.

  "minor" change - HEPlaR drives.

John King makes some very good points about how the new, extremely
  strict fuel restrictions reduce the dynamic fleet campaigns of
  the various Frontier Wars to static, bloody trench warfare.  Because
  an invading force is always at a disadvantage to the defenders in
  fuel (now even more vital than the famed deep meson sites), attacking
  is something you do as a last resort.  War becomes a matter of seeing
  who blinks first and thereby loses half their navy.

This is a radical change to how interstellar war is fought in Traveller,
  even more so if you believe the substitution of HEPlaR for thruster
  plates is retroactive.  Entrenched defenses and massive strike fleets
  (that take even more massive casualties) join the one-week lag of
  communications as a central, necessary element.

As I understand it, HEPlaR drives were introduced to make Traveller
  players worry about fuel in combat.  It did that, certainly - many
  players agonize more over G-turns than armament these days.  At the
  same time, it also rendered M-drives useless for in-system travel
  (easier to just make a microjump), extended the time PCs "waste" in
  flight from days to weeks, and (as we now see) completely redefines
  the strategy of interstellar war.

Something to consider when you talk about making "one little change"...

1.STARPORTS

I liked Jeff Zeitland\'s article. I believe that an extended UESP is a good idea
(at least it gets away from the idea of "B-" or "D+" starport ratings).

A few points:
a.I would prefer alphabetic ratings, as per all other "profiles", starting
at "A" and going from there.
eg. Starport Construction
RatingTonnage
A500,000 - 1,000,000
B100,000 - 500,000
C 10,000 - 100,000
D  5,000 - 10,000
E  1,000 - 5,000
F    500 - 1,000
G     10 - 500
XN/A
Z1,000,000+
Note: I consider "Z" \'ports to be a special case. These are RARE; not
many \'ports would build ships this size on a regular basis. I would
even suggest that there are *none* left in the Regency.

2.      ANCIENT SHIPS

Paul Walker asked how to design an Ancient\'s ship.

Firstly, define the TL. At a mere TL 17, for example, you would use
antimatter. However, at TL 21, you would use an energy sink coupled to
a pinched-off pocket universe, via portal technology. Fuel supply is derived
from a continuously-operational fuel refinery located on the seashore of the
world inside the pocket universe. Therefore, it is virtually infinite - you
could *even* use <gasp> HePlar without running out of fuel (can you tell
I\'m a fan of grav plates? ;-)

The ship is J6, 6G - heck, why not make it 20G, you can pump heaps of power
into your TL 21 inertial dampers and grav plates.

See _Adventure 12: The Secret of the Ancients_ for more details. In that
ship *each compartment* could be detached from the main ship and fly
around.

Its the Ancients, man - think *magic*!!

This is somewhat true.  Less so if the attacker bothers with logistics
(tankers, small jumps, etc.).  I don\'t really understand the idea that
insystem fighting is a quick and dirty thing with SDBs driving around
the oort cloud and all.

Well, not useless, just slower :-)  What about a month at 6gs and the
stray planet gets in the way of your boat (a consequence of unlimited
delta v)?  I\'m not saying that the point at which stuff goes bingo in BL
should stay that way in the future, but I do think that there needs to
be a limit on delta v.

Depending on the distance it was better to make microjumps in CT as
well.  BTW, a typical Earth/Jupiter run would be better jumped in CT
(slightly worse at closest approach for a couple months a year) even at
6g.

Also, if your fleet doesn\'t want to be killed by well placed water or
sand it\'ll need to keep the velocity down to dogleg the route a little.

> Something to consider when you talk about making "one little change"...

Agreed.  A major flaw with the new stuff, IMHO.  It wasn\'t well tested
against the history as I see it.  I happen by chance to agree with some
of the changes in the system, though.  It makes me look like a defender
of all that is new, when in fact more is my own predjudices.  I do
think, however, that the canon might have a few flaws in this regard as
well.  How do you make FFW attack factors from a HG design?  Was FFW
actually tested with HG battles?  It seems like nit-picking, but I bet
we could argue similar things and change it from CT vs. TNE to HG vs.
FFW----does this make any sense?

On a slight tangent----at what point do you (all of you) think that a
limit on Mdrive delta v is useful, but could be within canon?  Does
everyone agree that trying to pretend that a lifeboat isn\'t a
planet-killer in CT is harder than saying that there is actually some
limit on total delta v?  How many g-turns?  100 is too few it seems to
most.  1000?  Just curious.

        That\'s exactly the way to approach it. There is no way to provide an
"Ancients Design Sequence" because _each_ and _every_ one of Yaskoydray\'s
offspring (and the ol\' geezer himself) did things differently, often

next time.

        The only real reason for a detailed design sequence like FF&S is so
you can consistently design common items. Ancients aren\'t consistent, and
their artifacts should be extremely uncommon. So figure out what you want
the game effects to be, and wing it!

Dave\'s right, but I\'ll throw some ideas in.

If you use/like FFS, use it as a guideline for the directions things
head from a tech point of view.  Also, remember that some things might
be a big can of worms to open unless you\'ve thought out the
implications, and maybe some fallback ideas to hobble it should it
become too much to have around unlimited by something (vague enough?).

If you use HEPlaR, for example, you could have reactionless drives
happen at higher TLs.  Or add jumpgates.  Or jump-commo.  Or
stutterwarp, even.  Make up some new materials for armor/structure.

The magic part should be there, but not too unbalancing (and hard to
copy unless you want them across the Imperium in a few years :-).

Are you absolutely sure about that?  I remember reading that those
missles were indeed custom built (they hadn\'t even been fully developed by
the beginning of the "conflict") and I remember the pricetag being much
MUCH higher that $3000.

3-15k for the paveway style add-ons that have been around since Vietnam.
The special bunker busters were different.

  Also, the Phoenix missles that are standard

Not that it has anything to do with LGB\'s but....
Approx $3M a shot I think. I read somewhere they cost $0.5M in 1975 dollars
and that was before they were upgraded. It is this and the general aging of
the F-14\'s that is seeing a change to a greater proportion of F-18\'s and
using AMRAAM instead.

Remember to pay for the troops training and upkeep.

I see 3 "classes" of troops (assumed TL13-15):

mobility they can get in a limited space. BD, Fusion guns, nothing is too
expensive to use here!

2. Regulars. These are the Mechanised infantry and Armour etc. High
firepower and protection and mobility are needed for a reasonable cost.
Mobility can be provided by vehicles so infantry is usually equipped with
Combat armour and RAM GLs, lasers etc.

3. Militia. These are the security troops etc. Equip with CEV\'s and gauss
rifles. Carried in unarmoured vehicles or APC\'s.

[stuff about HG and GG refueling snipped]

Well, 2 things.  One, GG refueling as a "real" behavior (TCS players
jump in here) was always kinda dubious tactically, FFW mechanics not
withstanding.

Two, if this does take place, it\'s no safer jumping first to the GG
since the MW _knows_ they have to go there.  The GG is defended,
heavily, and why not?  The I-Fleet _must_ refuel, and you can wait and
cream \'em when they try.
 ----

Why not?
1. The I fleet ought to be more powerful than the N fleet, otherwise why
would you be trying to attack with it?
2. The N fleet is spread across all the targets in the system. If it
concentrates then other areas (eg GGs) get less protection.

 ----
[stuff about GG refueling not happening due to delta v limits on ships
under HEPlaR snipped]

Now, you\'re right, the jump, refuel, drive on in is trashed.  But when
HEPlaR I-fleets jump in they really need to refuel.  Badly.  They are
forced to fight if the fuel is defended, and they are forced to right
away since time is on the defender\'s side.  Given the so-so nature of GG
fueling in CT, it makes, if anything, more sense with HEPlaR!  It\'s much
easier to skim a GG than it is to land on the mainworld for fuel.  And
given either history the GG is heavily defended (under the assumption it
would really be used).
 ----

It seems to me that recon by light ships would be very important.
If the I fleet can get intelligence on the disposition of the N fleet then
it can plan to hit them where they are weakest.
Light forces could also be sent in to take a GG prior to the main force
arriving or to distract the main N force.
The skirmishing between light ships over GGs might even be the _major_
deciding factor in these battles!

 ----
In CT, you may as well go for the mainworld right off:

Scenario 1
I-fleet jumps to GG.  GG heavily defended (everyone jumps to the GG,
it\'s important!).  I-fleet fights.  If it loses, they\'re dead.  If it
wins, they fuel. Then I-fleet attacks mainworld.  Same kind of fight,
but this time they can leave.
 ----

Assuming only 1 GG and of course the defender\'s forces _are_ split up....

 ----
Scenario 2
I-fleet jumps to mainworld.  MW heavily defended (we can\'t lose MW!).
I-fleet fights.  If they lose, they\'re dead.  If they win, they can
fuel.  If they want, they can go fight again at the GG (why?).
 ----

To stop a relieving fleet using it as a secure base insystem.

 ----
TNE Scenario 1
I-fleet jumps to GG.  GG heavily defended.  I-fleet fights to fuel.  If
they lose, they\'re dead.  If they win, they fuel.  Jump to MW.  Fight
again.  It\'s a small jump, so they can jump back to GG if they need to.
 ----

See Scenario 1 response above

 ----
TNE Scenario 2
I-fleet jumps to MW.  MW heavily defended.  Fight or die.  Ends up the
same as Scenario 2 above.

The problem is that if GG refueling is sooo important, then the GG will
be defended very well, and for good reason. In both cases the ships that
fuel up before tackling MW have more options than the direct attack.
GG attacks will warn MW regardless, but in the CT example they will be
heading to MW for sure (just watch \'em get bigger in the telescope).  In
the TNE example, you\'ll see them disappear on the telescope and wonder
if they\'re jumping to MW, or off to another system.
 ----

You\'re forgetting one very important thing; there is normally _more_ than
one GG insystem! This forces the N fleet to disperse across 3-5 locations
while the I fleet can hit one all at once. As the N fleet must guard against
the MW being assulted directly most of the N fleet will be concentrated
there thus leaving the GGs with only light protection.

On the continuing discussion regarding changed fleet tactics when using
HePlaR vs. thruster plates:

Several posters seem to think that a microjump would cost less fuel than
a 1-parsec jump.  Alas, it\'s not so.  The 1-parsec fuel cost is the
minimum cost for any jump.  So jumping to the GG, refueling, then
microjumping in-system is a wash if you J-1\'d into the system, but does
offer advantages if you J-2+\'d in.

I think the general consensus that\'s emerging is that, under HePlaR, it\'s
harder on the I-fleet than it was under thrusters.  As someone pointed
out, most naval vessels aren\'t going to carry enough fuel for two jumps,
one in and one out.  Obviously, if you\'re attacking with a modern (J-4 or
more) fleet across a 1-parsec gap, you\'ll have plenty of reserve after
your J-1 for fleeing or moving on.  But a more typical scenario would be
a J-3 into the target system, given the typical stellar separations and
need to keep the assault moving into enemy territory.  After a J-3, most
ships will need to refuel to get home.

In the Good Old Days, you attacked a gas giant to refuel.  Now, as
was mentioned, the N-fleet is going to defend potential refueling points
as a matter of course; but as was also pointed out, many systems will
have several GG\'s, along with water-bearing worlds and asteroids other
than the MW, so the defender\'s necessarily going to be spread rather
thinly trying to cover all of them.  Note that this means that systems
with only one GG and no other fuel sources, and *especially* cases like
Regina where the MW orbits the sole GG, are going to be tough nuts to
crack for the I-fleet.  Cases with *no* wilderness refueling opportunites
really demand you bring in tankers or the like; you can\'t risk the
N-fleet blowing the fuel storage facilities when it\'s clear they\'ve lost.

Under HePlaR, though, your choices get more constrained.  Quite frankly,
I\'m starting to convince myself that the only viable option in most
"standard" cases (GG far from MW) is to attack a GG, top off the tanks,
then microjump to the mainworld.  You end up shaving off 1 parsec from
your strategic mobility if you decide to leave early, but you\'d spend that
much fuel or more powering in on M-drives in any reasonable length of
time.  In addition, the microjump gives you an element of uncertainty.
Scenario: I-fleet arrives, pastes defenders at small outer GG, refuels,
jumps out.  Did they move along to another system?  Or will they pop into
orbit over your head a week from now?  With an M-drive approach, the
N-fleet knows the whole way in who\'s coming and from what direction.
With the microjump, the N-fleet can never be certain.

So, I see a typical "rhythm of advance" for an aggressor fleet being:

- Jump to target system (1 week)
- Secure and refuel at GG (2 days (?))
- Microjump to MW (1 week)
- Secure MW (2 days (?))

Then either
(a) If possible, refuel at MW (1 day)
(b) Otherwise, microjump to GG and refuel there (8 days)

For a grand total of 19 to 26 days in the "strategic cycle" of a rapid
advance, as compared to around 14 under thruster plates.  Not a big
difference, really, but enough to modify some canonical descriptions of
system invasions.

I\'ve seen several problems brought up on the lists concerning the rules
governing jump drives.

Notably:

1. There is a 100t minimum size limit in CT & MT that is violated in CT Adv
4 with Jump torps and is violated in TNE by a minimum size of JD being set
as 2 m^3.

2. In TNE the larger the ship gets the more of it\'s surface area is covered
by jump drive radiators.

I propose that jump drive size should be (at least in part) proportional to
the surface area of the ship.
As volume is cubic and SA is squared the smaller the ship is the more volume
is taken up by JD machinery (and fuel) until at some size it becomes
impossible to fit a JD.
There is no upper limit to the size of ship that may be fitted with a JD.
Note that different configurations would require different JD sizes.
Note that it is compatible with the "canon" of jump grids in MT.

Possible formula:

JD Vol = 1% x Jn + SA/s

where s is a scalar selected to give the minimum size ship we want or a
reasonable size JD at some "standard" size ship.
I think s should be about 20.
Though this does allow ships as low as 20 tons to jump, they are limited to
J-1 at this small size.

Your comments on this non-arbitary system are welcome.

I\'m afraid that my UWP summary data posted to the list was a bit duff.

1. The yard capacity figures are in billions of UCP tonnes, not
trillions (I thought it looked a bit high ...).

2. The yard capacity shown is half of the correct figure (duh !), and I
should have noted that the figure shown was for starships (i.e. A
starports) only.

Oh, the joys of being stupid !

While I\'m at it, here\'s the data from Fifth Frontier War.

World       Heavy SDBs  System/Reserve Squadron
Jewell      120         BatRon, CruRon
Louzy       500         None
Vilis       100         None
Efate       150         BatRon, CruRon
Alell       10          CruRon
Feri        12          CruRon

Zivije      120         BatRon, CruRon
Rhylanor    200         None ?
Porozlo     1000        BatRon, CruRon, AssaultRon

These are the local (i.e. reserve and local) major space forces for all
of Jewell, Regina, Lanth, Vilis, and parts of Aramis and Rhylanor.

Let\'s try and expand this. The first line of Jewell\'s forces comprised
between 800 kilotons and 1.6 megatons of TL-11/12 battleships and 200 to
800 kilotons of TL-11/12 cruisers. Assuming that a heavy SDB is from 1
to 2 kilotons (Scorpion/Wasp class) or the equivalent in bigger or
smaller vessels, Jewell has around 200 kilotons of SDBs. That gives
Jewell, hardly a powerhouse of the old Marches, between 1.2 and 2.6
megatons of major warships, ignoring the sizable numbers of light
cruisers, destroyers, destroyer escorts, couriers and tankers which
support the major units.

And that\'s just one moderately important world which faces, even if
defeated by it\'s old enemy nothing worse than a few months-long
occupation followed by an evacuation come the peace (the Zhodani won\'t
keep Jewell). How much more firepower would a world like Jewell deploy
in the face of an inhumanly patient and ruthless enemy which seeks the
destruction or enslavement of every single sophont on the planet ? Would
you pay more taxes to save your world from being another Trin ? I would
and so would the good people of the Regency.

present day, and assuming that such an advancement took place in the
Traveller timeline, would not the computers take many of the tasks
*off* the user?  For a present-day example, consider the Microsoft
packages... they \'eat up\' quite a lot of space on most people\'s
hard-drives but, when compared to older packages, are far superior
since they allow the user to access functions which would take longer
using either manual devices (i.e. typewriters) or old packages.

In this case, would not - to use a previous example - an astrogator
be able to "place a cursor on the desired destination" and press
\'Go?\'  Surely the astrogator would not have to sit around punching
out numbers on a pocket computer to check whether the computer got it
right?  If so, then how far do you want to go?  Would this continue
with another crew member checking with *another* pocket computer,
then another one with a calculator, then another with an abacus?

This may be, as suggested, be represented in MT by 0-level skills.
However, upon the assumption that \'0\' indicates familiarity with the
object of the skill would it not therefore be logical to extend this
to other skills.  A High Stellar character may have Computer-0, but
why not Swimming-o (they can doggy-paddle), Hand Combat-0 (anyone can
punch), Fencing-0 (almost anyone can swing a sword)... etc.  There
are, of course, problems - yes, you may be able to swing a sword, but
can you do it effectively?  Yet isn\'t this the whole point with
level-0 skills.

In the TNE system, could not a similar "level-0" skill system be
implemented (if it is not already... I have not read the rules in
ages)?  Surely, having a level-0 skill would suffice.  If probability
is skewed heavily in favour of the character (due to high attributes,
or whatever), then would not increasing the difficulty of the task
suffice?  If not, then how about the GM considering the factors
involved in character\'s history, careers, etc. to determine a
standard target number for a single dice or successive dice rolls?

Why the I-Fleet have to refuel? I never would design or use ships with fuel
stores for only one jump.  As I understand, each standard TNE ship is able
to store fuel for at least two or three jumps.

As a consequence all I-Fleets have the option to retreat at will and
fighting for a GC is quite useless.

The standard 100t TL15 Scout/Courier as shown on p.366 in TNE, for example,
holds about 50t fuel.  Per jump-1, 100 * 0.03 * 5 / 6 = 2.5t of fuel are
needed. Ignoring fuel for heplar, it could jump up to 20 parsec.  It has
also a cargo space of aditional 11t which alone is enough for 4 more parsec.
(Please correct me, if that calculation is wrong, it seems very high)

The other way around, you could exchange 16,8 G-hours for one J2 if I
analyse the numbers correctly. This gives you 2x J-2 and still 23.2 G-hours.
Not bad.

In TNE it\'s the Heplar drive which is very fuel consuming. But why not use
this fuel for a emergency jump. So the new heplar design drastically changes
fleet tactics.

The same TL15 Scout designed with MT rules would need 3 jump units and
therefor 3 x 5 = 15t fuel per jump-2. However I don\'t own the MT player\'s
book which probably contain the other stats of the Scout/Courier. But I
think, 30t of fuel space should be possible and also in MT
multiple-jump-ships are possible.

The same TL15 Scout designed with CT rules would have an A converter and an
A jump drive needing 100 * 0.1 * 2 + 10 * 2 = 40t fuel for one j2 and 4
weeks running.

It\'s quite interesting that each Traveller version has completely different
rules of which only the CT rules enforce ship design with one-jump-tanks.

>Now, you\'re right, the jump, refuel, drive on in is trashed.  But when

No, they needn\'t. Also a MT I-Fleet probably need not.

Aside the question whether refuel is needed or ships contain enough fuel to
jump back, you could avoid problems in MT and TNE with tankers that refuel
jumped ships before the attack.  In CT because of the very high own fuel
consumption
tankers are impossible.

An observation of a demonstrable fact is ranting? GDW *is* no longer in
existence, and TNE (and its failure for whatever reason) to sell enough
copies to keep it afloat seems to be the reason. My information from local
stores is that CTrav sold well, MTrav sold well, and TNE sold (comparatively)
not at all well. Someone mentioned that they could never get MTrav stuff at
their local store ... perhaps because people were always buying it as fast
as it became available (that was the experience locally) and they also noted
that they could always get TNE ... perhaps because no-one was buying it (again
I am advised this was the case locally). If that\'s a rant, well, so be it.

Well, granted that my Traveller 2300 stuff is downstairs, so I can\'t check
right now (it\'d take some digging out, which I don\'t feel like doing at
23:28 local!), but, IIRC (and I\'m sure that you\'ll correct me), Miller\'s
involvement was mainly with the gaming that created the background? If I am
wrong, then I stand corrected.

An interesting analogy. My information is that the Desert Storm Factbook was
a money *loser* for GDW ... or, at least, not as big a money winner as they
thought. I have been told by usually reliable sources that *orders* were
really good, but that *returns* were enormous as well ... they were, after
all, making sales to bookstores (and chain ones at that) on the usual book
rates applicable (i.e. sale or full refund return), and there were, so it
goes, many returns. If you know different, I\'d be interested to hear it.

Agreed, one supplement cannot save a game company ... but it was more than
one in the case of TNE. A series of less than optuimum sellers.

Yes, but, as you fail to address, the failures that put GDW in such a parlous
position (so it seems) that TNE was a do or die effort were *before* the TC
boom.

Not by itself. However, the fact that they failed (and, OK, you won\'t *agree*
that they failed, fine. Doesn\'t worry me. Some agree with both of us - and we
both think the facts stand for themselves) and that they did so because they
pissed off most of their established audience in pursuit of a new one had a
lot to do with it. Sure, some people liked the changes, but, again, I argue
that they were so successful that the whole thing failed. Maybe I\'m wrong, it
really doesn\'t matter ... the thing is, a lot of old customers were annoyed
enough to stop buying (or stop buying everything that was released ... that\'s
what I did; others of my acquaintance have bought no TNE stuff at all ... but
still scour the convention auctions for CTrav and MTrav stuff). That was lost
sales.

I can live with the fact that you like it. But they\'re still non-canon insofar
as they complete disagree with 15 years of Thruster Plate *canon*. They are
also one of the major turnoffs for established fans ... to adopt them would
invalidate and make worthless *everything* connected with Space Travel in all
previous material. Sort of reminds me of my dad ... used to be a keen amateur
movie maker (on old 8mm home cameras ... pre-video), even the President of
the local Australian (NSW) Amateur Cine Society. Then the makers of all the
gear - cameras, projectors, film, splicers etc. etc. decided that they had a
wonderful new moneymaking idea ... they\'d replace Standard 8mm with "Super
8mm". They\'d stop supporting *all* the old stuff and stop making the film for
it. *Everyone* would have to dump their old gear (hundreds of Pounds worth
in the 60\'s - a *lot* of money) and buy expensive *new* gear that was, as
far as the technology was concerned, identical except for size of the film it
took (and the quality of the pictures were arguably not better, perhaps even
slightly worse). Guess what? A lot of people were so pissed off that they
simply dropped their interest ... my Dad certainly did. Of course, home
movies being what they are, it didn\'t make a lot of difference to the bottom
line because the demand was inelastic to a degree ... in the case of RPGs,
the demand is much more elastic, so such a strategy is *very* risky. My point
is that the evidence available points to it being a partial failure - and, on
top of all the other runaway *not* successes preceeding it, it was enough to
sink the boat.

Actually, if you read carefully, you\'d note that I think that Traveller
died, effectively, in 1992. I didn\'t like the MTrav game system or the
useless vehicle design system, but I *did* like the background and a lot
of the support material. World Builders Handbook is, as far as I am concerned,
the best single Traveller supplement ever produced ... despite its many flaws.

Yep, and if you read what I wrote, you\'d note that I rather liked all the
above. They had their problems, but none as severe as those of MTrav and
*certainly* not in the earth-shatteringly awful league of TNE!

Possibly I should have written that paragraph a little more clearly. I ran
demonstration games of TNE at shows in the UK for a year before TNE came
out, for people who wanted to see what it was like (and I also endured a
seemingly endless stream of airheads whining that "GDW had murdered
Traveller"). I also ran demonstrations of CT for many years.

When people who don\'t know a game sit down to play a demonstration, it is
usually because they are trying to decide whether it is worth buying the
game and learning it. In this instance, of course, the background could be
anything from \'Alice in Wonderland\' to \'Virus kills Third Imperium\' as long
as the game is fun and it gives the prospective purchasers an idea of how
the game plays.

I prefer to run participation games, rather than demos, for people who come
to a show and want to play their favourite game with a different GM (or,
more commonly, in a different playing style to the one they normally play at
club). In this case, a common background - as you stated later in your post
 - gives all the players a common reference point, which can only be a good
thing.

> Most people realize that rules aren\'t

denominator.

Properly done, the rules should not get in the way of the suspension of
disbelief which is necessary to allow players to play the game. I have
always subscribed to the view that one of the GMs main tasks is to make the
rules as unobtrusive as possible and allow the players to immerse themselves
in the story.

>>What it comes down to is: a rules set without a background is just a
>>wargame.
>
>I wouldn\'t subscribe to this. Is GURPS a wargame?

No, GURPS is not a wargame. There are currently about 25 backgrounds in
print for GURPS (and probably that many again that are no longer in print).
However, if you meant \'Is the GURPS rulebook, alone, a wargame?\', then the
answer is probably yes (I went home and looked out my copy of the GURPS
rulebook last night - it is about 250 pages long, of which 177 are purely
character, skills and combat information. There is no background presented
in the basic rulebook.).

Let\'s not start all that again, eh? :-)

This was one of the main criticisms of MegaTraveller. In order to be able to
use the background as presented, you had to know about all the different
factions of the rebellion, which in turn meant the reasons for the
rebellion, etc. etc. (I\'m paraphrasing Dave Neilson\'s comments in an
interview he gave to RPI magazine).  I\'m sure that, between us, we could
come up with any number of games where the background stifles the game.

However, that was not the point of my original post. I was replying to
someone (whose name I have forgotten - sorry, whoever you are) who was
arguing that, because CT had no background and sold well, and TNE had
background and sold badly, why did we need a background with T:4.

> I agree, that no background at all will be the wrong decission, but

But my point to that other poster was that there are people out there who
are happy (in fact they actually expect) to "eat" other people\'s ideas. The
original Dragonlance series of modules (for the AD&D game) sold so well that
they were repackaged as a trilogy of combined modules, just exactly because
people wanted to play through the plots of the books.

When I started roleplaying [this parrot sh*t\'s going to be the death of my
uniform :-) ] we were forced to be creative because nobody published
background material - and there were people then who were content to replay
their favourite films and books. One of my most successful CT campaigns from
that era was set in the background of the Dune books.

No. Although GDW announced that Virus had destroyed everything except their
published background, which seemed to cut off the possibility of setting up
your own little \'enclave\' somewhere else in \'known\' space, you always had
the option of having your own pocket empire (a cop-out possibly - I just
rewrote \'history\' so that Virus, although devastating, had not destroyed
everything which gave my players an illusion of hope).

We are both in agreement, but for not quite the same reasons.

I assume that\'s not a command. :-)

True.  I was operating under the worst case as a demonstration.  Combat
will burn fuel at 12gturns an hour though (evasion is _good_ :-) so
topping the tanks is still a good idea.

Well, again, I assumed a long jump in.  Then since they\'ll have 50gtuns
or so they could bug out even with the jump, but only if they don\'t try
to fight too much first (assuming they jumped from the closest friendly
world when they jumped in).

As fo the tankers, yeah, you\'re right.

To start beating the canon horse again----there are 3 different versions
of Jdrive now, which would be best to match history?  Or what
combination of the three?  This would be useful in making an FFS rewrite
to actually match canon.

HEPLAR becomes available at TL-9 (if I remember correctly).

Thruster plates become available (in my campaign) at TL-11.
Maximum thrust is 2 Gs at TL-11, 4 Gs at TL-12, and 6 Gs at TL-13 (higher
G-ratings at the appropriate TL\'s, if desired).

Thus, the mostly TL-12 to TL-15 Third Imperium *didn\'t* *need* to
worry about maneuver fuel, but the mostly TL-9 to TL-11 Reformation
Coalition and pocket empires *do* need to worry about in-system fuel (and
travel times).

The exact TL for thruster plates could be adjusted to better fit
"canon", but I hope you get the basic idea.  Hope this helps.

My vote goes to the MT grid model.  I would also probably clobber in
the multiple jumps that TNE allows.  If for no other reason than it
seems to be something many people wanted for a long time.  Maybe use a
formula like the one presented in either TD21 or MTJ4 (can\'t remember
which) where you would use a variable amount of fuel, but it would be
more than a fraction of your jump rating.  In other words, a j-3 drive
makes a j-1 jump.  The fuel usage is 1/3 the total j-fuel, plus a
little bit more.

0400 Bridge Report (Navigator Reporting):

Captain:
    "Why not?  We\'re scheduled to finish refueling the fleet in an hour!!"

greater during in-system jumps.

TL16 20-cm SEFOP IR homing missile has mass about 60kg (+30kg for launcher),
range 1km, PV 233. It\'s pretty hefty for non-powered infantry, of course...
but great for ambushing drones out of upper-story windows, especially since
the drone (lacking a turret) can\'t fire on the move. (It wouldn\'t do
much against a real AV500 tank, of course.)

There aren\'t any rules for hypervelocity KEAP rockets or missiles, but
with a little extrapolation one can come up with some. A TL16 5cm
KEAP rocket with a TL8 SF rocket engine can be designed with max range 400m,
penetration 2400 at that range (penetration 500 at 100m, unfortunately
drops rapidly at shorter ranges as the rocket needs time to accelerate.)
It weights 5kg and costs Cr32. Bad news for drones and tanks. (You don\'t even
want to think about the EAPLaC version. Trust me.)

Kinetic energy weapon penetrations need to level off at high muzzle energies -
something like PV=14*sqrt(energy) at energies above 12 Mj would work.

For comparisons between drones and tanks, Bri needs to do a version of his
drone with a person inside it, and see how much more it costs or how much
less effective it is.

Part of Traveller\'s niche, relative to (say) Space Opera or more recent SF
games, was that it tried to be (somewhat) hard-SF, with only a few
deviations from extrapolated physical laws. It doesn\'t do that perfectly, of
course, but it always seemed to be trying harder than most other games.

Thruster plates (or any reactionless drive) violate both conservation of
energy and conservation of momentum.  True, all SF breaks some physical laws,
but those are *really* fundamental laws; without them, you\'re only a few steps
away from inertialess drives, or Star Wars. Merrick\'s world-wrecking lifeboat
is a direct consequence of this - a tiny little fusion plant can use thruster
plates to put rather a lot of kinetic energy into a ship.

I know that HEPlaR bends conservation of energy (I prefer to assume that
some fraction of the HEPlaR reaction mass undergoes fusion, which brings it
back into energy balance.) Still, on the balance, I like it; I would imagine
it adds something to roleplaying by giving more detail to space travel.
I think T4 should keep it, possibly tweaked a little (decreasing FC values
with tech level would be my suggestion, as the fusion gets more efficient.)

Besides, it gives a reason for all the ships to have little exhaust nozzles
like all the deckplans show :-)

Bruce
P.S. Pop science quiz: which other physical law, just as fundamental as
CofE and CofM, do all versions of Traveller (including T2300AD) break?

 Not at all - unless you _want_ to discontinue!  The more places
 this stuff is available, the better; if nothing else, it prevents
 any one site from getting bogged down (not that this is likely to
 happen because of the RICE Archives, but...).  Also, the current
 Archives are limited to 5MB of data; upgrading beyond that will
 co$t me more.  Having you as a backup/mirror/overflow will allow
 for a relatively simple way of appearing to keep everything in one

 stuff I don\'t have room for! :)

 That _would_ be appreciated!  I can handle either PKZip or gzip; I
 can also manage lharc/lha and arj.  In a real pinch, Mac format
 files are possible, but they\'ll take me a few extra days to unpack
 and post.

 Also, while I think of it - Marc Miller, if you\'re reading this
 list (to be devoutly hoped), I\'ve "borrowed" the motif for the
 original Traveller books as the "banner" for the RICE Archives
 home page, and I\'ve stuck a disclaimer under it.  I\'d _really_
 appreciate it if you\'d give them a look-see, and let me know if
 there are any problems with what I\'ve done.  If there are, I\'ll
 make any reasonable changes I can - just do let me know...

not saying he wrong, he\'s actually right (large gasp comes from readers :)

reason why (though not an excuse) GDW choose to use the TNE background.

Simply put the Imperium is just to big, a very daunhting task for realitive
newbies or old hats alike.  And I know, just use a sector, but what if your
player all decide to head to Capital one day or like me your a complitists
and want to know all about the Imperium as a whole (hey that an idea, Mr
Miller, sir, can we have a Imperium source book, Please!).  Thats what the
new era try\'s (and maybe fails), by limiting the area the players have less
choice and the GM needs to now less, and going beyond the boundries can be
an adventure, as there going were no one (well at least in recent time) gone
before.

I agree with everything you say.  I was trying to comment on the Solomani\'s
plans, and it came out as history.  I\'ll make up a paragraph that explains
that Hard Times disrupted their plans. I\'ll include that in version 1.1
when I get around to doing that.

I disagree with some of this.  One the RC is a very loose government,
its only a few years old, and probably doesn\'t have laws carefully
regulating commerce and most aspects of interstellar life.  They are
making it up as they go along. So even if they didn\'t like Transstar, I
don\'t think the legal machinery is there to do anything about it.  The
obvious answer to this is why don\'t they make a law against Transstar.
Well Transstar has been on Fija for seventy some years, they have
gotten themselves wrapped up in its economy pretty well, so the Fijan
senators would fight to protect it.  Transstar also takes care of
Senators that it likes, not bribing them, but giving as much money as
legally possible.

  Also the current board of Transstar wasn\'t even alive when the
Solomani were around, if tomorrow a Solomani Party representive was to
show up on Fija and demand control of the company, the Board of
Directors wouldn\'t just hand over power to a complete stranger.  They
would start negotiations, whether they agreed to a merger, a take over
or eventually refused to yeild the company, I don\'t know, It\'ll have to
wait until it happens in my campaign.    Another benifit of maintaining
their link with the Solomani Party is that if they find some small
pocket of Transstar in the Wilds, they could take it over.  Alpha
Crucis Sector was always under Solomani control, and its rimward of
Aubaine subsector.  (If you want Transstar to be secretly Solomani
style human supremists, then they might want to be taken over by their
Solomani brethren. But I am leaving up to each individual referee)

     Another point, is that Fija is a very lawful society, laws and
order must be upheld.  Transstar\'s is legally bound to the Solomani
party, through what ever paperwork that talks about who owns a
corporation.  They can\'t just ignore that.  It would be the same as if
one of General Motor\'s division decided it wasn\'t going to be part of
General Motors anymore.  Of course, the Solomani Party doesn\'t exist in
any recognizable form right now, but that is what the law says, and the
law must be followed.   (This argument depends on the view I have of
the Fija culture, if you have a different view, it doesn\'t work as well.)

BTW, The reason I used Transstar and didn\'t create a totally original
corporation, was that there is a sense of history and connection to the
previous Era. This is what I\'ve always liked about Traveller.

Thanks for the comments.

has it ever occured to you that the reason that TNE fell through
might be because of the legacy of CT or T2300?
TNE was a good idea.

one slight moan about starship generation tables.
In future could you proof read it so that weight dosn\'t change from
wt/tonnage/kg etc through the book.
And a slight suggestion would be a full page calculation at the end
(4 pages one for a spaceship/ etc) that could be used like a flow
chart to spot any errors.

It should be:

This is enough for 6 jumps of 1 parsec.

    'index' => 'bb737',
    'month' => '02',
    'body' => 'One of the items I have noticed is that the change to HEPlaR from T-Plates
has had three noticeable effects upon the cannonical setting history:

1> It increased Jump mobility

2> It decreased in system mobility

3> It makes ship operations more expensive.

In the first case: No rule ever prevented one from having more fuel than
one jump of maximum range, AFAIK. I desigtned ships with multiple jumps
under all three editions. HEPlaR simply requires maneuver fuel, which,
being identical to the jump fuel in nature, is useable for an extra jump
(assuming enough remains). Most designs under CT/MT did not have this much
non-jump fuel around.

As for in system mobility, I am referring to N-Space mobility. Evan an SDB
under TNE would benefit from a J-Drive. J1 is all any SDB needs. But with
J1, you have plenty of spare maneuver fuel if you choose to use it that way
while on station (say, at the GG?). Under CT/MT, such vessels didn\'t really
benefit from having a J-Drive; the space was better spent on weapons, ammo,
and crew.

The third point is a key impact upon players: fuel costs (per kl), and ship
incomes, have not changed  in the transition. However, the fuel cost per
ship has gone up, as more fuel is used per ship. Which makes marginally
profityable PC Craft like the Fat Trader (Subsidized Merchant) even more
marginable.

Fuel fexibility has made up for much of the problem. It takes only 2-3
G-Turns for merchant craft to make it to jump. Most times, my players use a
total of 7 burns total on peaceful operations. When they have combat, they
run the Jump fuel dry fighting, then refuel.

There is one other major background change of MAJOR note in TNE:

POWER PLANT FUEL IS NOW A BASELINE OF 1 YEAR!

As opposed to the one month standard fuel of CT, and the "Reccomended" MT
minimum of 1 month. This also makes a big diference to long range military
craft. Under CT/MT, PP Fuel was a major consideration in in-system ops an
maneuver; no power = no LS + no maneuver + no weapons. While the equation
is still true, the fact is that TNE Ships don\'t run out of PP Fuel during
normal ops; while CT/MT ships could if they didn\'t plan thoroughly. Also,
it is possible to sacrifice much of the PP Fuel for 1 more Burn on many
craft.



Summary:

TNE\'s HEPlaR made jump drives more vital to all facets of space exploration
and exploitation, while also making the fuel factors LESS important for
jump operations. Its changes cause changes not just in military, but also
in merchant thought. The tactical and system operational timeframes are
expanded, and costs are higher. From a gaming standpoint, it also changes
the hooks available for adventure/plot possibilities around fuel (Which is
neither a good nor a bad thing).

So it invalidates much of the detail extant in CT & MT about the mainstream
history. The net effect on the overall is minor, but the minutiae are
immensly different,  and now invalid. (If HEPlaR is cannon).

"unskilled OK" system (difficulty remains the same even if person doesn\'t

practically the same as having level-0 skill, but it saves some
bookkeepping. Of course, the same people that could use ship\'s computer for

I suggest that you look at what moderrn naval vessels do. They\'ve got
the fancy GPS receivers, and other navigational aids. They *also* have
someone taking sightings with a sextant and "reducing" the sightings
"by hand" (calculators are used, but aren\'t all *that* necessary).

There are two reasons for this. First, it provides a vaulable check on
the more advanced systems. It\'s rumored that there\'s a mode where the
DOD can tell the GPS satellites to *lie* to everybody but folks with
special decoder rigs. And other "advanced" navigational aids can be
spoofed to one extent or another.

Second, if the fancy gear gets knocked out, that sextant, your watch,
and the *printed* tables in the Nautical Almanac may be all you\'ve got
to determine where the ship is.

Likewise, I expect that both military *and* civilian ships in Traveller
carry the gear for making star sightings, and printed tables of
planetary positions for various systems. It\'s cheap, doesn\'t take much
room, and just might save your ass in an emergency.

Sure, there\'ll be "point and shoot" interfaces available too. But
you\'ll find that they are *not* intended for laymen! A display or
interface that gives the experienced professional all the options *he*
wants is *not* going to be very friendly to someone who has no
training. There\'s an *inherent* complexity involved.

Example:
If you want to get from point A to point B inside the same
system, you\'ve got a *lot* of choices. You can burn a lot of fuel and
get there quickly. You can burn a little fuel and take a long time.
And, depending on your current velocity, and that of your destination,
you may just be able to get there "quickly" without much fuel use, or
have to use lots of fuel and *still* take a long time to get there. It
may not even be *possible to get from A to B with your ship. Or it may
be possible to get to another point, from which you can *then* get to
your destination.

Astorgation is *never* going to be all that cut and dried.

And since we don\'t really know much about jumps, we can\'t really say
*what* it takes to do jump navigation. But even with what we do know,
it\'s not going to be simple. An "easy" interface might let you try to
jump from the *surface* of a planet, because the *professional*
navgator had it set up to not argue with him in case he had to make
emergency maneuevers...

<sigh>

I wish I had thought to write down the author and title of a book I
once checked out of the base library. It dealt with astrogation and
space combat. That is, the author assumed no magic drives, no hand
waving. And then tried to figure out how you\'d fight and navigate.

He missed a few bets, as the book was written in the late fifties or
early sixties. So no lasers or particle beams. But the astrogational
calcs would still be valid, as would the weapons. They just wouldn\'t be
the *only* weapons.

something of an anomaly ... nothing like the USL problem (if only in terms of
absolute scale!), but still very significant ...

The problem is related to materials technology ... consider this, there is a
very specific developmental sequence for hull materials for spacecraft, with
a given mass becoming tougher and cheaper. Reasonable? I certainly see it
that way.

However, look at the Small Arms design sequence ... there is *nothing* like
this sort of sequence. The assumption is that all weapons from TL4 thru TL10+
are all made of materials that, for a given mass, always cost the same and
never become tougher. There is *nothing* in the design sequence that allows
for this. You can\'t even stretch existing things such as reductions in barrel
length (the barrels should still mass/cost less for a given toughness) etc.
The same sort of problem exists with Gauss Weapons, too.

This came up because I was thinking about Portable Airlocks - and someone\'s
statement that they are never improved beyond TL9 simply because they cannot
be! This seems quite ridiculous ... if hull materials are improved throughout
the TL system, then I can see no argument at all that a general improvement
in all materials do not occur.

So, consider this (based on the material in FF&S) -

TL      Relative Cost of Materials      Relative Mass for Standard Toughness

7       1                               1
8       0.76                            0.76
9*      0.7                             0.735
10      0.64                            0.71
11*     0.605                           0.66
12      0.57                            0.61
13*     0.57                            0.455
14      0.57                            0.3
15*     0.596                           0.27
16*     0.523                           0.24
17      0.5                             0.21

Taking TL7 as "1" and extrapolating those levels marked with an asterisk.
(Measured by taking a mass with the same Toughness - 4 - as TL7 Light
Composite)

Thus, a TL9 Portable Airlock rates as -

TL      Cost        Mass

7       1430        8.16
8       1086        6.2
9       1000        6
10      914         5.8
11      864         5.39
12      814         4.98
13      814         3.71
14      814         2.45
15      780         2.2
16      747         1.96
17      714         1.71

One could assume that similar cost and mass reductions would be possible for
smallarms and gauss weapons (or any other weapon, for that matter!) - though
the effect on existing designs would be enough in some cases to require some
redesign (for recoil purposes, mainly). Certainly there is no good reason that
such reductions in mass and cost *not* apply for, basically, *everything*
once it is introduced ... at least for future tech levels if not for previous
ones.

Just a thought.

    'body' => 'Ever wondered *why* you can\'t have a TL11 (say) version of a TL5 computer?
For example, Scout/Couriers have always had Model 1bis computers (TL6) - and
are normally constructed at TL11 (minimum for Jump2) ... but do they *really*
expect us to believe that a TL11 version of a Model 1bis is going to be
identical in mass, power requirements etc. to a TL5 one? Obviously they do!

But why *should* this be the case? No reason at all. Even now, you can buy
computers that come with varying capacities that, at our present TL, represent
everything from current "state of the art" to something that approximates the
computing power of one a TL or two (in Traveller terms) less in a laptop,
notebook, or even palmtop package at (in relative pricing, mass, and power
requirement terms) *much* less than they were produced at originally. It is
eminently reasonable to assume that this will continue to be the case in the
future.

Thus, using MTrav or CTrav (you can\'t really do it with TNE because the stats
that are required to make the calculations possible no longer exist in it), you
can simply divide the base model\'s Max CP input by the CP input of the lower
TL model required (or the CP multiplier, take your pick) and then divide the
mass, power required, cost etc by that factor.

Thus, a TL6 Model 1 bis masses 5 tons, has a volume of 20 displacement tons,
requires 0.03 MW power and costs 9 MCr (as per MTrav, Referee\'s Manual,
pg. #81). A TL15 Model 9bis masses 8.8 tons, has a volume of 35 displacement
tons, requires 0.02 MW power and costs 43 MCr.

The Model 9bis has CP Input of 500 million and CP Multiplier of 120; the Model
1bis has a CP Input of 7500 and a CP Multiplier of 15. If you use the CP Input
as the determinant, then the reduction factor for a TL15 Model 1bis
*equivalent* is 0.000015 ... giving it a mass of 0.075 kg. volume of 0.3 l,
power requirements of 0.0000004 Mw and costs 135 Credits! If you use the CP
Multiplier you get a reduction factor of 0.125 ... giving the TL15 model 1bis
a mass of 250 kg, a volume of 2.5 tons, power requirement of 0.00375 Mw, and
will cost 1.125 MCr.

Based on the fact that a TL11 Hand Computer (MTrav, Imperial Encyclopaedia,
pg. #56) which is stated as having the equivalent of a Model 1 (TL5) in
computing power costs 1000 Cr, masses 0.5 kg and has a volume of 0.2 liters
(even allowing for the fact that it may not have the same beefed up avionic
rating as aerospace computers and may have a slower CPU) I personally suggest
that the 135 Cr TL 15 Model 1bis massing 75g and being powered by batteries
is the way to go!

Of course, you can always declare the Hand Computer "non-canon" ... which
seems to be a standard excuse for some people. Its in the rules, it makes
sense on what we know and can reasonably project (and if HePlaR is more
"reasonable" than Thruster Plates, and so must be adopted, surely "realistic"
computers should be as well?

Excuses for ignoring logic are eagerly awaited!

I agree, the computers have always been goofy.  In the same way that one
might come up with an explanation for a crappy world UPP with huge
population, and a great world next door with near no population here\'s
my rationale for existing computers:

The computer volumes (certainly in CT) include all the wiring,
workstations etc. throughout the ship.  The actual CPU unit is hand
sized and could be powered by a battery (and is in emergencies).

In FFS you can\'t make this rationalization (note that this is a support
of Phil\'s arguement regarding detail and suspension of disbelief).  The
solution is to change the computer rules in the future so that either
the actual computers are smaller/cheaper, or that at least some of the
workstations are included in the computer volume.

I see a fairly simple fix to this, although I\'ll have to check it
against bigger ships to see what it does to existing designs...

We say that the computer includes the displays, etc. throughout the
ship, but only some certain number of displays per computer.  An
acceleration couch would be required for some of these stations, but
many wouldn\'t need more than a display (can you say "engineering staions
:-).  If your total wkstation requirement is more than you have with the
basic number of computers installed, you then add wkstations (which are
display units that plug into the network, and an acceleration couch).

The old rules making for making a bridge based on total volume would
actually supply the chairs/couches, etc..

I\'d like to see a way to make things like the hand computer as well.
Then a table for storage per volume, etc..  Then we add displays.  When
we\'re done we could make the crazy, huge computers in the table once we
require x displays, y storage, z cpus.

Thoughts?

Yeah, this is very different.  On the other hand, if your SDB is out in
the middle of nowhere, it\'d never get to the scene of the battle, even
in CT.  That\'s an odd thing about the CT/MT canon.  You have unlimited
Nspace maneuver, but it it is still much faster to jump in-system for
most trips.  Not most "trips" as listed in the little table, but most
real trips if you actually look at the distances (lists of distances
from the sun are useful, but you have to remember that all the planets

Yeah.  Of course I\'ve always thought that commerce was too marginal

Well, it\'s about 260 kl/yr in MT vs. 0.1kl/yr in FFS :-)  Of course the
MT value includes Mdrive uses.

There is a finite (and known) quantity of energy in a volume of
hydrogen, so having a real number on this isn\'t a problem, we just need
to check the math in FFS.

start is a flame war about Virus, but I thought you might be interested in
this.
I read in a December 1995 issue of the weekly magazine New Scientist that a
group of Swedish scientists have created a computer chip which is capable of
reproducing by etching copies of itself onto bare silicon wafers.
 Unfortunately, I don\'t have a copy of the magazine with me to give you more
information, and the person I borrowed it from went back to Australia.  New
Scientist is an Australian publication, so maybe one of our Australian
friends could look for it when they go to the public library and tell us
more.  The article was on the top of one of the left-hand pages when the
magazine is opened, and it had a picture from the SF show Blue Dwarf (? - an
Australian or British TV show?  I don\'t get it in Japan).  I looked on the
New Scientist web page but they don\'t seem to have an archive of magazine
articles available.
Anyway, when I read that article, I got a chill up my spine.  It made Virus
that much more scary.  If nothing else, this is very similar to the
Cymbeline chips (Virus homeworld - Signal GK adventure  CT) only not
occuring naturally.
I\'ve been reading the posts about HePLaR.  Very interesting.  This not only
affects military operations, but the merchant group of players as well.  At
least in my campaigns, players always want to get the free fuel at gas
giants where available.  If it takes months or longer to move to the
mainworld from there because HePLaR fuel consumption is high, then players
will be making many in-system jumps.  Not only will in-system jumps become
common in the campaign, but the players will want to know about how far the
gas giants are from the mainworlds in each system they visit with a gas
giant.  This information is not in the UPP information, but apparently it is
very important now.

I\'m designing a TL-20 Starship.  I need to know three things.

1)  How would a TL-20 J-drive be constructed?  Options:
    A) Is it necessary to use Hydrogen for the creation of the Jump buble
           (It has unique chemical properties that allow the Bubble to be
            created and maintained.)
    B) Or are jump bubbles maintained by energy only.

        In option A, some portion of the Hydrogen must be retained for the
creation and maintenance of the Bubble, but the MW could be more compactly
provided for with Antimatter.  In Option B(perhaps easier to figure out) the
entire J-drive could be maintained with Antimatter(this could be computed by
comparing Fusion reactor technology with the Fuel requirements for
J-drives.)  I lean towards Option A, but Option B is decidedly simpler.

2)  What Thruster (M-drive) technology is logically the next step from
         HePlaR?  Options:
     A) New Technology.  (Daedalus Drive, Bussard Rams, Etc)
     B) Improved HePlaR.  (Better Fuel Usage)
     C) Thruster Plates.  (Ooo!!  Aaah!!)

        My preference here involves a little tweeking.  As I understand the
History of the Universe, and correct me if I\'m wrong(like I have to ask),
Some to much of the Technological breakthroughs of the Imperium were the
results of coppied technology (they coppied Gramps\' J-drives, etc).  If this
isn\'t true, then this whole thought pretty much falls apart, but here goes.
What if Thruster Plates were based on coppied Grandfather technology.  They
would then be widely used in Imperial space and in the Regency.  The RC uses
Hiver based Technology.  If I remember correctly, the Hiver were not
originally on Coyns, implying that they were not part of Gramps\' original
guinea pigs, therefore didn\'t find/get Thruster plates (Their find of the
J-drive was an accident??).  This would invalidate some of the newly
designed ships (Regency sourcebook esp), and some of the redesigned relic
ships would be trashed in favor of the old designs.  The only real problem
is with the RC remnant and Relic technology (wether free traders or SAG
relics).  The solution here is that the RC (as a new technology) is still
researching how to copy the Thruster Plate.  Why didn\'t the Hiver convert to
Thruster Plates when they met the civilized Imperium, who knows, Hiver are
weird!!  I know that this is a lot of Hand Waving, and hand waving is
generally frowned upon, but It is the only idea that Came to me when I was
trying to figure out how to get back to Thruster Plates without totally
invalidating the rest of TNE.

3)  Where could a TL-20 Starship have come from? Options:
    A)  Ancients
    B)  Other Advanced Race

        This question wasn\'t in the original post, but some of the Responces
("Ancients are *Magic*!") led me to this question.  I need a Starship that
is going to be quirky for PC\'s to use.  The TL-20 is to create a Long term
Learning Curve to prevent them from mastering it quickly (As RC characters
their inherent TL is 9-12).  This ship is to be found at a secret Imperial
Research Station where, before the Collapse, it was being studied in order
to copy the technology.  Because the Study was ongoing, the ship is not in
complete working order.  While it will maneuver and Jump, most of it\'s other
systems are quirky at best, commonly inconsistent.  Combined with the PC\'s
low native TL, this will provide me with a variety of Wrenches to throw into
their Gears.  The ship is too great a find to pass up though.  This ship
CANNOT be a warship.  It can be fitted with TL-10 to TL-12 RC weapons, but I
don\'t want the PC\'s to have high TL Weapon power.

        Some other things I\'m considering are:
   A) A sentient AI(non-Virus) computer that has an ornery personality.
("How would you feel if people were tearing apart your insides for 15
years?")  This would create other problems for the PC\'s to overcome.
   B) A semi senile Anagathics enhanced researcher who is always tinkering
with the higher Tech components of the ship to "find out how they work."  Of
course this tinkering would be with the wrong system at the wrong time.

I would appreciate any thoughts anyone has.  I thank you in advance.

ships to reach 10^7 m/s velocity (I\'m assuming CT\'s 1000 second turns
here, and assuming a suicide run to zero fuel).  At that velocity, a 200
ton ship hits with approximately 10^19 joules (2 * 10^5 /2 * 10^7 * 10^7).
I\'m no engineer, so please forgive my ignorance here, but isn\'t that still
a huge impact?  Makes for nasty terrorist attacks.

On a similar note, a ship using thruster plates and accelerating at 4 g
for 250000 seconds (about 3 days), also achieves 10^7 meters per second.
If we use Merrick\'s suggested anti-intruder tactic of sending a cloud of
water vapor or sand at it, it would be in big trouble.  If it hits a
stationary particle or particles massing .02 grams, it takes 10^9 joules.
(2 * 10^-5 /2 * 10^7 * 10^7).  Again, I defer to those with greater
engineering knowledge, but one gigajoule should tear any ship to bits, no?

I think I\'d stick with about 100 g-turns of thrust.  This still allows
velocities of 10^6 m/s, making the impact energy 10^17 joules.

   This Is a short list of the tactics that a fleeting using HEpiar trusters wo
uld use.
   Shorter Jumps:  A fleet attacking a hostile system might not use it maxium j
ump capacity when entering the system.  For example, A midu-Agashuam destoryer
would make a J-3 instead of its maxuim of 6.  This would akkiw tge Nudy-agashua
m it full 50g of manuever and stil have 3-j of J-fuel to jump out of system.
   Tankers become more important:  Using Hepiar truster a fleet would be forced
 to use it tankers more.  A attackig fleet would jump into system with its
tankers.  The fleet then would refuel and drive into system with a fuel load of
 manuever fuel, and a fuel load of J-fuel for retreating.  Note, these "tankers
"  need not be dedicated craft they could be other ships with body stores, on
convererted traders.
   Hit the gas giant frist:  when a ttacking a system in which heavy restance i
s expected the attackers safest first move would be to secure a gas giant in sy
stem.  This gives the attacker a secure supply of fuel to draw upon which reduc
ing the main worlds defences.
    Home Court:  IN CT SDBs had the ability to go into the "outer system" and h
ide for an attacker.  Then the SDBs could act as a restancesforce, snipping at
the enemy.  With Hepiar truster the defender can still do this, all he has to d
o is set up a number of hidden fuel cashes into system.  This supply of fuel
would allow an SDB force to be a pain for the attacker fo exteded periods.
     lastly let me say I do not think changing to hepiar changes the military h
istory of the traveller universe, a great deal.  most history of war do not go
into small details like fuel usage, or logistices.

  P.S. I think one last thing has been over looked in in-system travell times,

No, the rule is that naval forces are based on 10 times the annual budget.
(Though Since both the budget and the construction capacity is based on
the size of the population (but with different modifiers) there would be
a strong correlation between the fleet size and the construction capacity.

It sure would.

Well, let\'s look at an average fleet unit like the  50,000 T _Ghalalk_
class cruiser (_Fighting Ships_ p. 30) It takes roughly 5.5 million
people to generate the tax needed to maintain it. It has a crew of 450
(marines included). That\'s about 0,008%. Similar calculations can be
made for any other fleet unit. The population base needed to pay for
any ship will have no problem coming up with the people to crew it.

You\'d think so, wouldn\'t you? But try asking the admirals in charge and
they\'ll tell you they need more. ;-)

It may be possible to explain all those silly worlds, if you assume that
the Imperium - careful to avoid overextending itself - overlooks most
instances of Ethnic Cleansing.  The poor losers, eager to get away to
anywhere, floods to the nearest world regardless of how ugly it is.

(and 1100 years of history gives LOTS of time for as much nastyness as
you want.)

Moreover, good worlds with very few people can be considered to be former
victims of a rock-throwing contest, or the personal property of a Very
Powerful local noble.

And if you\'re an attacking fleet, you would have used drop tanks to jump,
so that your ships arrived fully loaded. Anything else only if forced to
it by circumstances.

You never participated in a TCS campaign, did you? No admiral would want
to arrive anywhere with less than full tanks (though I grant you that he
might not have any choice).

Believe me, once you\'ve had your forces chewed up a fifth at a time trying
to defend your whole system, you\'ll concentrate your defensive forces on
defending the mainworld.

Probably the most effective g-turn limit is fuel.  Remember that a ship
will have to expend an equal amount of thrust in the opposite direction
to bring forward motion to a stop.  So considering that most of the ships
in the New Era system that I\'ve seen only carry at most 80G-turns worth
of fuel (that\'s including jump fuel), the maximum they can accelerate is
40G-turns----assuming they want to be able to stop.  One also has to
consider that interplanetary speeds are pretty damn fast, as reflected by
Mr. Collin\'s calculations below, so if  one wants realism (not the "SBDs
swooping around the Oort Cloud" image that someone else brought up) the
system works fine.

Ask the shuttle astrounauts----there\'s so much debris floating around in
orbit waiting for them to impact with at speeds approaching 35000mph (for
opposite trajectorys, assuming they both orbit at the same speed), they
oughta know the physics behind it.

Yep. But for 15 years one of the deviations was the \'you can go anywhere in
a star system on one tankful\' maneuver engine. That means that 15 years
worth of background and campaigns had those \'magic\' engines. In Traveller
they were not magic; they were a part of the laws of nature.

Those laws only apply when you\'re working with a closed universe. The
moment you introduce things like jump-space you can throw them out of
the window. What if thruster plates \'thrusts\' against an underlying
medium, a sub-space? Where\'s your conservation of momentum and energy
then? It will apply to N-space PLUS subspace, sure, but no longer to
N-space alone.

Maybe something else would be better if Traveller was just being designed,
just as I would use 3-D maps if I was starting a new non-Imperium campaign,
but that decision was made 20 years ago. Changing the physical laws of a
game universe, even if the new ones are more \'real\' is IMO an incredibly
bad idea.

        Not rumored at all ... it\'s known as "Selective Availability." And
it doesn\'t actually lie, it just degrades the signal so your accuracy goes
down. With all the money the DOD put into GPS to help the warfighter, they\'d
feel really stupid if it was also helping the enemy. Unfortunately, they
didn\'t expect it to catch on so big in the civilian world. Now there is some
serious question as to whether they\'d even be allowed to degrade the signal.

        My understanding (from where, I can\'t say at the moment) is that
part of the hydrogen was actually used for _cooling_ not power production.
So I would say

        C) The jump bubble is created and maintained by energy input, from
where is irrelevant as long as it\'s fast enough. Fusion, Antimatter, 2x10^27
gerbils on a treadmill. But you also need to keep waste heat from the
process out of the rest of the ship, so you need cooling. "Standard" drives
use convective cooling with hydrogen as the working fluid. Ancients may have
better methods.

>3)  Where could a TL-20 Starship have come from? Options:
>    A)  Ancients
>    B)  Other Advanced Race


        C) Misjump in time from the long past (one of Grandfather\'s robot
ships) or the future
        D) Misjump or equivalent FTL drive failure from another "reality"
(but the "Enterprise" in traveller would be just too cheesy).

        Both by having a different TL _and_ a physically different race, you
can add to this. Say, the original race was 3ft high by 8 ft long weaseloids
who liked blindingly bright blue lights, or dim red lights, preferred
2.718Gs, and breathed Hydrogen Sulfide. And the life support system is
geared to that (not to mention the 4ft ceilings everywhere). So the first
order of business would be to set up a "shelter" with breathable air inside
the ship. Then the crew would have to operate in vaccsuits. Next priority
would be to figure out how to adjust the life support system (or disable it...).

I thought that was my point :-)  That the same kind of creativity that
allows us to make sense of (at first glance) odd data can sometimes work
to our advantage.

You make a neat story to explain a world profile that seems odd, and you
actually add value to the thing----now it has a personality that it might
not if it fit your expectations.  We might try looking at some of the
odd technolgy the same way and see where it takes us.

Just a thought,

Peter Brenton\'s response is basically identical to the relationship
between size of ship and rank that the Keith brothers sketched out 
for command of ships in the Imperial Navy in the FASA products and
their JTAS articles.  It ran:

 Sublieutenant.  Up to 300 tons  (scoutships).
 Lieutenant.     Up to 1000 tons (escorts, corvettes).
 Lt. Commander.  Up to 10 ktons  (destroyers, fleet escorts).
 Commander.      Up to 30 ktons  (escort destroyers, light cruisers).
 Captain.        Up to 100 ktons or more.
 Commodore.      Might command a dreadnought or similar vessel over
                 100 ktons if operating in a small squadron where
                 an admiral and fleet captain are not present.

They also specified that in the IN, if all line officers were out of
action, command devolved to the senior specialist officer, with 
preference given to Gunnery, then Flight, then Engineering.  This
seems reasonable to me -- this precedence would tend to pass command
to officers able to direct combat, and maintain a vessel\'s fighting
ability for as long as possible.

A three officer (command crew) ship such as a _Valor_ missile corvette
is given as an example.  Such a ship is commanded by a lieutenant, with
a sublieutenant as Chief Gunner and a sublieutenant or ensign as Chief
Engineer.  From there you can divide the rest of the crew into petty
officers and spacehands in a logical manner.

As I see it, the IN will be very serious about the standards the 
officers must uphold.  This lieutenant, probably about twenty-six to
thirty years old, has control over forty nuclear missiles with a 
combined destructive power of twenty megatons of TNT, as well as an
expensive starship (also dangerous if mishandled) and a trusting
crew.

Absolutely; fervently seconded.  Lois McMaster Bujold is one of my favorite
authors.  Sometimes her science is a little funky, but (IMHO) she is the
premier storyteller in science-fiction right now.  Her characters are
interesting and multi-faceted (wait \'til you figure out everything about
Miles\' dad), her plots inventive.  Any referee would do well to emulate her
style of building layers of depth into a story, not to mention her sense of
pace and humor.  The Vorkosigan novice is directed to "Borders of Infinity,"
a collection of short stories featuring young Lord Miles Vorkosigan.  For the
more chronologically minded, start with "Shards of Honor," which details
Miles\' parents\' meeting and marriage; next "Barrayar," which deals with
Cordelia\'s pregnancy and Miles\' birth (key to the character, in many ways);
then "The Warrior\'s Apprentice," which is the story of Miles\' attempt to get
into the Service Academy;  then "The Vor Game," further adventures; then
"Ethan of Athos," which doesn\'t feature Miles, but gives further background;
then "Brothers in Arms," a personal favorite, outstanding examples of the
High Soc/Low Rank problem; and, finally, "Mirror Dance," Bujold\'s most
ambitious novel.  Also "Cetaganda," her newest book, is just out in
paperback, though I am expecting the hardcover for Christmas.  I believe it
is set before "Brothers in Arms," though not having read it yet, I\'m not
exactly sure when.  The stories in "Borders of Infinity" are set in between
the various books, so it\'s hard to categorize the book as a whole.  There you
have it.  Enjoy.

Military Chain of Command is based on the premise that one\'s superiors
are more competent/better informed than one is. To act otherwise is
insubordination. 

The problem with Miles\' "subordination problem" is that, in general, he is
right. He IS more competent, or better informed, or just quicker on the ball
than most of the officers put above him. (Which is why putting him on the
shortest chain of command possible works)
When Miles takes orders from a distant Simon, and Simon reports directly
to the Emperor, Miles in at his best. He _must_ work under his own
initiative, and the only people above him in the chain of command are two
of the people he respects (and wants respect from) most on Barrayar

Some militaries recognized this situation where a junior officer may have
a better grasp of the situation than a more distant superior. The most
famous is the Austrian "Maria Teresa" medal, awarded to a junior officer
who wins a victory by disobeying orders from a superior. The flip side
being that if you didn\'t win, you were court-martial material.

Miles, or someone like him would make a marvellous patron for a group of
Traveller characters. - If they didn\'t mind having the operation blow up on
them on a moments notice. To keep up with Miles, one must think fast -
and often NOT along conventional military lines.

No it doesn\'t. As I said, you have to lay out ships planning that you
*may* be operating with "gravity" towards the back of the ship. In
fact, you may be operating the engines at 6G acceleration. Nobody is
going to be walking around the engine room then, regardless of whether
the "floor" used to be a "wall" or not. In either orientation, you
would want to have "gravity" towards your back then.

> Also, you don\'t always have *warning* before an attack.

This is not really relevant. If the compensation fails, the engines
should kick off long enough to let people strap in (this is true
regardless of the orientation--you might be running at 6G, and are
likely to be maneuvering if in combat).

Rob,

I must have forgotten but what conversion formula(e) did you use for the MT
to T4 conversions? Remember that Greg Porter uses a different armor layering
method than Striker/MT. have you had a chance to look a the gamma version of
the Vehicle construction rules that he posted?

I used the conversion formula posted by Greg Porter and I get totally
different figures. ie

10mm Binary Autopistol design comes out with a Pen 3 and Damage 3 in MT
terms, but has a damage value of 4 in T4 terms?????!!!!???

A friend of mine, French Canadian, was GMing a group of players in Call of Cthulhu that 
included one or two players from France. 
At one point, while describing a bar, the GM used the phrase "dead bodies" (meaning empty 
beer bottles) and the French player had a look of horror as the GM described this bar with 
people casually drinking with dead bodies covering most of the counter. When the GM 
asked what was the matter, the player asked about the dead bodies, the GM replied "just like 
in any kinda seedy bar" The player at this point got an explanation about the local slang, but 
up til then, I think he was probably thinking that maybe this crowd was a little too rough for 
him (if they hang around in the type of bar were bodies on the tables are not worth noticing)

After running one of our products at work through testing to meet the General 
Motors environmental requirements, I find that the max acceleration rating of
a Traveller hull to be unrealistic.

Our product, a networked electronic engine controller, must continue to work
properly after being subjected to 40G\'s (in a big shaker) for over an hour.  I 
realize that a car doesn\'t ussually see these kind of forces except during a
collision, but even my Toyota Tercel was mostly intact after being t-boned by
a full size pickup at 45mph.  So I guess I\'d want to know how much damage
a Traveller starship hull would take when it crashes into the ground at say 
100mph?  Is everybody dead?  That\'s a lot more than 1G.  Or is the damage 
localized in the point of impact area on the ship?

Never heard of this guy, probably full of it otherwise he would have ID\'d
himself.

Tell him to go sue IG/GDW and everyone else who\'s used this without
paying the licensing fee over the last thirty or so years.  Tell him your
using it under the acceptable use clause, in relation to GDW & IG 
books.

Yes.

He must have been dead for the last twenty years not to have heard
of the game Traveller, and it\'s use of the term psionics.

>5) Anyone any idea if using a copyrighted word in a fictional setting

As I understand it, if something has been trademarked by someone, but
has been in general use by the public for a certain number of years, that
trademark is invalid.  On another track, if you can prove that the term was
in use before his stated trademark date, then you can use that as 
evidence against him, and might even get his trademark invalidated.  

Personally I don\'t think he has a foot to stand on.  He sounds like some 
kind of religious fanatic who is trying to get people to acknowledge his 
religion.  He\'s doing a very bad job of gaining converts.  If he wants to 
sue someone, point him in the direction of GDW and IG, they probably
have more money than you do.

Ask Mark Miller if he has ever heard of this guy.  He had to find the term
somewhere.  My guess is that you aren\'t in any trouble.

 =20
Zero-point-fluctuations or zero-point-field (ZPF) are the electric and
magnetic fields that result from virtual particles (having nothing to=20
do with VR ;).  Virtual particles are positive and negative particles
that appear out of nothing (apparently) and then meet, anhilating
each other in a matter anti-matter reaction (I\'m assuming here).=20
=20
Normally under Einstein\'s Relativity, particles,and therefore energy
cannot appear from nothing, since this breaks (I believe) the second
law of thermodynamics (energy can neither be created or destroyed),
but under the right circumstances, when two such particles appear and
then almost immediately destroy each other it can occur.  The only=20
thing that is left to react with normal space and reality are the=20
electromagnetic fields which can interact with other particles.

To go a little farther one would have to wonder where these virtual
particles come from.  I\'ve read that they are allowed to exist due
to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle also known as the=20
Indeterminancy Principle (that says you can never know both the=20
momentum and position of a particle at the same time to any=20
great degree).  I have however read an article by a famous=20
military strategist (Stefan T. Possony) in which he contends that
there are new kinds of weapons being tested by the Soviets that=20
use a "different" kind of physics.  He goes on to quote a book that
discusses work by David Bohm:

	Empty space ... is not empty at all; it\'s full,
 	an immense sea of energy on top of which matter as
	we know it is only a "small quantized wavelike=20
	excitation ... rather like a tiny ripple."

	The entire universe of matter ... is to be=20
	treated as a comparatively small pattern of excitation
	on the energy sea.

      In other words, the virtual particles and the ZPF they generate
are created when potentials in the energy sea line up correctly.=20
Gravity and inertia under Haisch\'s description is nothing more than
the resistance to acceleration put up by the energy sea (well at
least the inertia part, gravity works a little differently).

	Gravity under this description seems to work like the=20
early universe was described to me.  Particles are always oscillating
at specific frequencies, thereby giving off radiation.  The ZPF (energy
sea) is constantly creating particles and their anti-particles of a=20
wide range of energies (and therefore frequencies).  A particle under
this system damps the zpf around it, and when two particles near
each other, there exists a line between them that holds slightly=20
weaker zpf fields.  Particles will then tend to move toward each other
along this line.  This motion would be akin to gravity.

You could use this mechanism to establish a mechanism for artificial
gravity.  Simply lower the amount of Zero-Point-Fluctuations (creating =
an=20
area of negative energy) in say a grav plate and you have instant =
gravity. =20
If you want a one way grav plate, instead of one that attracts things to =
both sides, you might be able to shield the area underneath (cool =
gravitic shielding!  or an=20
inertial compensator).  This same method could probably be used
in tractor beams.

Anti-gravity on the other hand might be achieved in two ways.
1. Shield a vehicle, or part of a vehicle (like CG lifters) from all =
ZPF.
    This would serve to act much like Thruster Plates, with a decrease
    in thrust the farther you get from a massive object. (I don\'t
advocate shielding the entire vehicle completely due to possible=20
time dilation effects suffered by the occupants.)
	  =20
2. Create a volume of higher than normal ZPF, and shield it in
    every direction except the thrust direction.  This would essentially
    provide you thrust, however unlike the Thruster Plates,
    this effect will work away from planets & massive objects, since it
    pushes against the ZPF instead of another objects gravity.

Type 1 could be used for tractor beams, and type 2 could be used for=20
pressor beams.

I use type 2 to make my anti-grav drives work.  It makes ships much=20
faster, and combat _very_ different from classical traveller.  My drives
(I have two types) work in the following manner:  For type A the drive =
is=20
made up of two main sections in a cylindrical shape.  The foreward part=20
is a spherical hot fusion reactor (which burns prodigious amounts of =
fuel
to produce the power needed), and the aft section is the actual drive
mechanism.  The drive mechanism is made up of a number of type 2
partly shielded thrust chambers.  These chambers are mounted on a
spinning axis and all face aft.  The reason for spinning the thrust =
chambers
is to "slice" into an area of normal space across from the area of=20
"compressed" space (my term for increased zpf space).  This method
increases the velocity achievable by this method of propulsion.  It is =
akin to=20
a propeller pushing air backwards. Note that the spinning is not =
necessary
to get propulsion from this method, it simply increases the amount of
thrust the engine produces.

I call the engines "Spin Gravs", a term created by author Bill Baldwin
of the _Helmsman_ series of novels (great space opera\'s).

Well hope I answered your questions.

 Your conversion table doesn\'t seem to work. I used it on Laser pistol & rifle,

Well... yes and no. I understand your point; occasionally I have to slap down my
players who are refining their equipment to be the absolute bestest modernest
whizzies and get back the game. BUT, when I throw in the occasional ancient
doohickey, or, as in what was possibly my favourite campaign, the Borg, it\'s
nice to have some design rules for whangdoodle hitech stuff so\'s I can do the
backwork and emerge with a coherent set of stats for the artifact/bad guys that
correspond to the stats of the PC\'s kit etc so that the game runs smoothly.

Ok, so I also like designing Trek and Star Wars analogues into my game. As it
happens I\'m planning to dump my Traveller players on Endor via a space/time rift
next campaign (hope they\'re not reading this!) and I need the hitech goodies for
that.

I could never accept this. Repulsors are thingies which generate a field wot

But, in combat, ships presumably dance around like sozzled owls trying not to be
hit, yeah? So the acceleration vectors, normally cancelled by the I-Comp, are
all over the place. In the absence of comp, then, wherever you are, if you
aren\'t strapped in you\'re bulkhead stroganoff.

However, the I-Comp is a feature of modular grav plates, as I recall. So it must
be damn hard to "knock it out". The only way I can see would be a power plant
failure - at which point the ship stops changing vectors or accelerating, and
the problem disappears anyway.

What I end up with, then, is that this is a non-problem. Ship designs of either
type are equally valid.

My experience (from BITS) is that handling sales of stuff is quite a pain to
organise. It might seem simple to you guys, but it actually takes a lot of
time. I\'m sure Roger\'s stuff will be in the post soon.

Not that one shouldn\'t be wary of \'new\' traders in second-hand goods as the

Codeword f*nny to be used hereafter to avoid confusion, in accordance with
other code words:

b*llocks (bullocks - large cattle with horns)
b*stard  (bustard - endangered hunting bird)
b*llsh*t (ballshot - anti-personnel ammunition load)
f*ck     (feck - feckless, etc.)
sh*t     (shot - injection)
cr*p     (crop - cut off)

This will allow all such words to continue to be used without fear of
misinterpretation. For example, b*stards with cr*pped wings are f*ckless
unless fed b*llocks sh*t with tranquiliser b*llsh*t (because they can\'t hunt
for themselves).

Bustard Two, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to attempt to

AND NOW A CHALLENGE FOR YOUR BRAINS
*****
(WITH A PRIZE!!!)
*****

There is a race known as the Jgd-Il-Jagd (IIRC) which lives in gas giants,
yet they are supposed to have powerful fighting starships.

Who has kept up to date with the Jupiter probe mission data to know:

1. What their likely life chemistry is?

2. How they might have evolved in a gas giant?

3. How they might build a starship, and what from?

4. How their technology could have progressed from floating around absorbing
gases (or other floaters) to building starships?

5. What sort of weapons they might use (personally, and on starships)?

(Anyone mentioning Grandfather with regard to any of these questions
immediately forfeits their prize).

The prize? An entire load of b*llocks.

Seriously though, any ideas from all those scientists we have on the TML?

Cetaganda occurs *before* Ethan of Athos. In fact, a minor bit of
business in Cetaganda is responsible for the main plot of Ethan of Athos.

The Newest Bujold is "Memory", and is the "latest" in the timeline
(ie comes *after* "Mirror Dance"). Miles is 29 and having some problems.

Here\'s the latest version of the timeline:

Shards of Honor
Barrayar			Miles is born
The Warrior\'s Apprentice	Miles is 17
The Mountains of Mourning*	Miles is 20
The Vor Game			
Cetaganda			Miles is 22
Ethan of Athos			
Labyrinth*			Miles is 23
The Borders of Infinity*	Miles is 24
Brothers in Arms
Borders of Infinity		Miles is 25
Mirror Dance			Miles is 28
Memory				Miles is 29

As usual, I must throw a monkey wrench into Joe\'s latest IG Status Report!

As you all may know, I have been trying to get a resolution on some 
credit card charges ($25.00 and $30.00) that started appearing back in 
July. The earlier ($30.00) was apparently for the Journal--why they 
charged me in July for a magazine that has yet to appear is beyond me. 
The later charge ($25.00) was apparently for Starships, made in 
September. Noting that Starships is still not out and has been reduced in 
price, well they haven\'t shipped it to me and they haven\'t credited me 
the difference.

I\'ve sent them (to this date) five faxes, four telephone messages, one 
actual telephone call with the Famous Anne, and one e-mail. I haven\'t 
received any followup to indicate that they\'ve credited my charge card or 
shipped products or otherwise cleared the situation.

So, once again I warn you all: If you\'ve placed credit card orders with 
IG, keep careful track of what they\'ve charged you and what you receive 
in terms of product. It would appear that things got severly scrambled 
during their move and it would appear that the one person in charge of 
customer relations is still not up to speed.

And on an even more sour note: My Friendly Local Game Store (The Compleat 
Strategist in New York City) told me yesterday that they don\'t expect 
Starships until around Christmas. This I got directly from the gent who 
has managed the store since I first started going there--in 1977! He 
quite candidly stated that IG is having major startup problems...

Sigh.

Me too.
Ask yourself: Why are you playing scifi-rpgs, if you don\'t like highly 
developed technics? If some don\'t like it, then they could as well play 
AD&D (which I play an like, too), couldn\'t they?

Hmmmm....

As far as I\'m concerned, I\'m currently introducing organic computers 
(which I personally call "thinker") and other high developed stuff from 
the ancients. It gives my campaigns a real spooky effect.

They CANNOT interact with other particles. They do NOT break the
conservation of energy constraint. These spontaneous particle
generation/destruction occurs within the limits of Heisenbergs uncertainty
principle and are therefore undetectable. Hawking postulates that such
pairs appearing on either side of the event horizon of a black hole could
be detected as they cannot again annihilate each other.
Hawking combines quantum physics and general relativity, two theories that
are thus far NOT possible to use together and the black hole radiation
effects are of course not experimentally verifiable.

Conservation of momentum, charge and energy will prevail "forever" in
physics but other laws of nature will probably "change" as new discoveries
are made IMHO.

  "Society" describes whether a being is group or individually oriented.
  "Initiative" refers to the ability of an individual to take action when
  left on its own.
  "Intraspecies" refers to how well a being gets along with members of its
  own species.
  "Interspecies" refers to how well the species relates to other races.

  "Family or Clan" refers to a small group of individuals, all related,
with a 
  single "alpha" pair functioning as head of the group.  Breeding between 
  individuals within the group is limited to the dominant "parent" pair.
  External breeding is unrestricted.  Competition between groups is usually

  strong.
    Examples:  lions, deer, Aslan, Humans
  "Herd or Pack" indicates a large number of individuals of the same
species, 
  organized into several subunits, with a single "alpha family".  Breeding 
  between individuals within the herd is unrestricted but may be affected
by
  social standing.  
    Examples:  hyenas, wildebeest, K\'Kree
  "Hive" refers to eusocial societies where a a single breeding female
  controls all activity within a large group of creatures.  All males are 
  fertile and permitted to breed with the "queen", and all females except
the
  queen are sterile.  Competition for breeding among hive females may be 
  either high or low, depending on the age and strength of the queen (and 
  designer choice).

   "A.Friend" is probably hoping that the victim will become panic stricken
and try to work out some kind of "license" agreement to use the word.
 A.Friend makes some bucks, and you are out needless cash.  Unfortunately for
A.Friend, he picked on the wrong people.

   I was taking a nap, after which I hit some golf balls in my backyard.  I
don\'t know how I got this cut on my hand and don\'t know where the blood
stains in the Bronco came from, but I suspect that they were planted there by
the cops.

These credit charges all occurred under the previous management - Ken 
Whitman and the folks who are now Authority Publishing.  A lot of us 
were charged for the Journal in July, and Starships in October - 
including me.  Yet, nothing was shipped.  That was unethical.

Those who placed orders for Starships within the last week or so (since 
Sweet Pea took over the business) have not been charged until their 
books are shipping, from what I\'ve been told.  If that\'s not the case, 
let me know.

Ann and the folks at IG are trying to repair the mistakes made by the 
previous management.  They\'re hampered by the poor recordkeeping done 
from July through October.

IG is aware of the fact that customer patience has been worn to the 
bone by the previous management, and they\'re attempting to avoid trying 
the patience of customers any further.

As for your credit charge being corrected, I was told earlier this week 
that the credit card charge machine wasn\'t hooked up to the credit 
network until this week - it had to be transferred from Lake Geneva to 
California in the credit company\'s network.  So, although the physical 
device was in California, it was non-operational for a while.

Your FLGS may not be getting them until Christmas - I don\'t know about 
that.  But those who ordered them directly should be getting them shortly.  
Unless, by "around Christmas" he meant early December?

Anyway, time will tell about that one...

Ehm --
For which gamesystem did you make this? Rolls like "99" or "1d20+1" 
aren\'t quite possible with six sided dice, are they?
Maybe I have overseen something ...

The reaction speed of the material would be limited by speed of sound in
the boob=8A I mean tank and its ability to react to plasma shots or worse;
lasers seems unrealistic. Why a culture capable of nanotech bothers to
build tanks that can only protect themselves against low tech shells is
beyound me but they would probably scare the players a lot:
"The tank came crawling over the crest, and I DO mean crawling."

        I did not know that. In fact, I would like to know the source and

the mythic creatures, but I think they were not flyers. Source: V&V (?)
        I recall a wonderful story by Jack Vance which won the Hugo, called
"Men and Dragons" (can be wrong: I am translating back the spanish title)
where alien descendents were primitively "geneered"  and converted into war
machines by humans for centuries after a failed invasion. Later, the aliens
return... with human descendents "geneered" and converted into war machines.
        Anyway, hmmmmmm... at least for no high-G, dense atm. worlds, flying
creatures based on the mythic idea of a dragon could have been geneered as
scouts, but probably not created from scratch. Anyone knows of non-sentient,
dragon-like creatures suitable for this purpose. Both The Beyond and Vland
are very far away from the Solomani.

Oh yeah, like rope. It pulls, shouldn\'t it push too? The forces
of compression and tension are different for physical materials,
maybe they\'re different for gravity too. I mean, natural gravity
is all pull. Maybe artifical gravity is all push.

Someone once explained gravity to me like this: imagine if space
was 2-dimensional. You could model it in our 3d would with a
big sheet. Now, imagine that the sheet is made of rubber. Masses
sit on top of the sheet, pulling it "down" in the third dimension.
Well, except that the sheet-dewllers don\'t see it, they just sort
of perceive that things move towards other big things... The sun
is sort of like a big ball bearing curving the rubber sheet. A lot
of cool things like gravity bending of light can then be explained
by analogies in the curved sheet universe. Anyways, for artifical
gravity, imagine that we can only poke the sheet "up", thus pushing
things away from our AG source. This could nullify gravity, provide
thrusters, repulsor beams, etc. You could repulse things in any direction,
but, technically, you\'d never have a "tractor beam", as it
would imply pulling ie. curving the sheet "down". 

The effect of point sources of gravity vs. lines, planes, discs, etc.
is left as an exercise for those who dig calculus. (ie. similar to
point/line/planar objects with an electrical or magnetic charge).

I didn\'t make my self clear in the paragraph preceding the one you 
quoted.  I know that they can\'t interact with other particles, however
there seems to be a widespread opinion that the EM fields they
create do interact with other particles.  Supposedly the Cassimir (sp?)
Effect proves that these fields do interact with other particles.  
Whether or not this is the case, this entire line of reasoning is a 
great way to explain gravitics in the Traveller Universe (IMHO).

Oh sure this will prevail because it is true.  However you might still be able
to find ways of achieving (apparent) FTL effects in ways that don\'t disagree
with relativity.  I think we are agreeing here, but I\'m just saying it in a
different way.

I converted Striker penetration to its equivalent thickness of steel
plate. Then I converted steel-plate thicknesses to T4 armor. In Striker,
there is a one-to-one equivalence between armor and penetration; it
doesn\'t seem too unreasonable to postulate a one-to-one mapping of armor
and damage in T4.

The formula for Striker to steel plate is, for penetrations less than
10, 1 pen = 1/10th of an inch of steel plate. So a pentration of 10
will punch thru one-inch-thick steel plate. A pen of 5 will punch thru
half an inch, and so on.

For penetrations greater than 10, the scale becomes logarithmic, with
doubling every 8 steps. Pen 10 = 1 inch of steel. Pen 18 = 2 inches,
pen 26 = 4 inches, pen 34 = 8 inches, pen 42 = 16 inches, and so on.

So now I convert from thickness of steel to T4 armor. What\'s the
formula? Here\'s the one I used. To quote:

That\'s from a message that Guy Garnett (wildstar) mailed me a while
back. I don\'t recall whether he posted it to the list or not.

From that, I get 
		Armor = (Thickness in cm)^(1/3) * 6 .

In Striker, Frank Chadwick used the conversion 1 inch = 2.5 cm (rather
than the canonical 1 inch = 2.54 cm), which is close enough for game
purposes. I used the same conversion.

They do interact with other particles; that\'s how we can tell that they
are there. Virtual-photon exchange, for instance, is how electric charges
attract or repell each other. The electric force is made out of virtual

the strong nuclear force. These virtual mesons keep our nuclei from

I\'ll second that. Rodge has never been cavalier with my money in the
past. This last month, we (Rodge and I) have been having some minor
problems with the Post (very slow mail). If the trouble source has been
the Seattle post office (and not just the Pittsburgh one) that could
explain alot.

Rob,

From the "Vehicle Design Rules" gamma version posted by Grep Porter I get
the following:

((Thickness in Cm)^.33)*Thougness (results rounded down) same as yours
except the rounding down.

Your figures above are only off at most by one, probably not rounding down.
Your T4 table of values is close, but the MT to T4 is the one that appears
to be off. Also be aware that Greg uses different toughness values than used
in MT, ie superdense is a toughness of 11 not 14 in MT. This will have a
great effect upon some weapons in conversions.

I think this is starting too much like Albedo for my own taste... :-)

Joking aside, I think it is important to remember that only some species
were uplifter.  While I think this might be easy for Dolphins and Chimps
(or even Gorillas), I don\'t think this would be possible for other
species that would have to climb too high on the evolutionnary ladder. 
I think a limit has to be in placed that only species with near human
intelligence can be uplifted.  While dogs are great companions (and
wolverines show a lot of resourcefulness), they do not (IMHO) answer to
this criteria.

What I really wonder about is:

what exactly is different between the TNE setting and Meilleiu 0? 
Essentially nothing from what I can tell. Both are settings where humanity 
rebuilds after a collapse into a new empire.

So since the two settings are essentially identical, why did they bother 
coming up with a new setting? If Mark Miller really wanted to get back to 
Classic Traveller, why didn\'t he set things back in 1115, or whenever.

By the way, no one is holding a gun up against your head forcing you to use 
the Virus. If you want a united empire under Norris, JUST DO IT!

All you have to do is get a hit that cuts the power *to* the plates.
The power plant can still be working but if the wrong cable got cut,
you\'ll be without whatever that cable was powering.

Knocking out the drive that way doesn\'t work as well, because both the
drive and the power plant are in the engine room. So you\'d have to hit
the engine room, and then it really doesn\'t matter what you hit in
there (except for determining how long until you can fix it, if you can
fix it).

Well, without getting in to the Virus thing, which was beaten to death many
moons ago, already, it\'s all a matter of personal opinion anyway. The
module, Arrival Vengeance, gave a pretty good idea of what Norris was up
against in regards to the various factions. Here\'s how I see the 1130\'s
looking without Virus. 
Short of Norris attempting a military solution, I don\'t see that any of the
factions were that interested in reforming the Imperium, and Dulinor was
quite on his way to rebuilding a fleet and crushing or seriously maiming
Lucan\'s remaining power base. Dulinor probably would have come out the
dominant military power, and then he has to secure his border with the
Solomani before trying to reincorporate the regions controlled by Margaret.
Then there was the restored Vilani Empire, Strephon, the Vargr, and Antares
to coreward. Who\'s going to quell all of them? And how does Dulinor, should
he get lucky enough to beat Lucan and all the other claimants to power,
convince Norris, who still controls a large part of the old Imperial Navy,
that he should accept him as his new ruler? That\'s a lot of work to rebuild
a government like the Dulinor was aiming for.
Norris would have similar problems. That\'s a serious amount of territory to
invade, even if he had the fleets and economic base to support such an
invasion. Plus, would he have tried a risky rift crossing for invasion, or
would he push against the Vargr and Vilani to get at Lucan and Dulinor? Was
he that foolish?
As far as the other claimants, Strephon had pretty much given up, Margaret
was comfortable with keeping her little piece of the Imperium running, even
at the cost of a few common-types, the Vilani appeared to be happy with
their little corner, Brzk was dead, if you accepted that event, so Antares
was a shambles, Lucan was destroying himself through his own incompetence,
and then there are the other governments. 
The Solomani, Aslan, K\'kree, and Vargr all seemed to want a shot at or a
piece of what was left of the Imperium. 
Given all this, I\'m not taking issue with the mechanism that caused the
final collapse, Virus, because that\'s an issue that IMHO should remain an
individual campaign point and not the whole argument to what should have
come after the Rebellion. I don\'t see any quick fix. I don\'t see the
Imperial calvary riding over the galactic horizon to save the day from
Norris\' corner of the Imperium or Strephon\'s. 
It was going to take a long time to restore anything to anywhere near the
way things used to be. Maybe they never would be like they used to be. I
liked TNE because it gave the characters, maybe even relics left over from
the Third Imperium, the chance to make things right and to reform the
Imperium in some form or another. All the major players had to have time to
disappear or change their minds for their to be any real reconstruction.
Something had to wipe the slate clean, be it Virus, economic collapse, time,
whatever. 
Of course, that\'s just my opinion. :)

Well there are some interesting points I feel need to be made.

1. Gravitic Drives lose efficiency after 100 diameters.
2. Thruster Plates lose efficiency after 1000 diameters.
3. Heplar Drives never lose efficiency.

The above is take from the "canon" interpretations. If the above three are
"Canon" then Artificial Gravity and Inertial Compensation are derived from
gravitic technology do they lose efficiency at 100 or 1000 diameters, I feel
that they would lose at 100 diameters. So how much uncompensated G force can
a crew take before suffering permanent injury, maybe 2 G\'s. So at 1000
diameters or greater ships can not maneuver much at all.
So just shot at ships that are outside the effective range of their I-Comp
and they are toast.

Now here is a statement that I totally agree with, it was a major
disappointment when I realized that going back to "Classic" Traveller had
nothing to do with the familiar and much loved setting!  I have a strange
feeling that the Starships book could be what ends up making up my mind on
the new Traveller!

Is there any kind of word as to what the next books after the first six are
going to be?  I for one would really like to see the true "classic" setting
come back!

Probably, but not necessarily.  If the main drive is a reaction rocket it
could be gimbled so as to vary the direction of thrust, at least a little,
and there are certainly maneuvering thrusters to jink the ship.  For
non-reaction drives we don\'t *know* that the thrust *has* to be "*always*
along the same axis."  

OTOH, I\'d agree to *almost* always. <g>

One cable?  To *all* the Grav-plates?  Nah!  <g> A military ship (actually
almost any ship) will be heavily redundant.  They will have redundant power
conduits powering redundant Grav-plates.

You know, I\'ve thought about this aspect too.  On military ships, I can\'t
see putting everything into one room.  I\'d want several smaller power
plants scattered around the ship, at least have a main and auxiliary engine
room.  The drives should be as spread out as much as possible too...that\'s
harder of course.  <g>  

Compare a Traveller ship to a major ship from the WWI/WWII era. Ships had
multiple boilers driving multiple screws.  You could knock out one and the
ship could keep limping along.  As long as a ship could keep one boiler
running it had a *chance* to stay afloat and make repairs.

Post harvest, actually.

It\'s a day we Americans give thanks that we live in a land of
bounty, liberty, and freedom.  Here\'s hoping the place *you* live is
the same.

Now to bring this back to Traveller...
What kind of holidays would the Imperium have?  What about the Sylean
Federation?

He had already made a sort of peace with the Zhodani and had come to an
understanding with the Aslan.  In fact, he seemed to be doing a good job
of assimilating Aslan colonists and such into the regency.  One would
assume that they would be a tremendous asset if they served in the
Regency\'s military.

The Vargr are a big question mark though, but I think through a
judiciious use of military force and diplomacy (making agreements with
particular Vargr groups) Norris could keep the Vargr feuding amongst
themselves and neutralize them.

Thusly we can safely see that Norris didn\'t have to worry about a
multi-front war at this time, the bulk of his forces would have been
spared the vicious fighting going on between the other factions.  I
would also think that being as isloated as the Spinward Marches are,
Norris might have an easier time uniting his people (example: "we all
have to work together if we are to survive" stuff).  Historically, there
are certain sociological currents that run through the Marches that
could work to Norris\'s benefit.

Norris also had an excellent Intelligence apparatus, so when the Regency
learned that the other factions were significantly weakened, Norris
could have led a spear head right to the core systems and with any luck
sweep aside the other weakened factions.  I also believe that the Moot
would look favorably at Norris, although the real power of the moot
should not be overestimated.

In my own humble opinion.

Regarding getting the "classic" setting back - and the Rebellion, and the 
Virus Era - all we know is that Marc plans to have a variety of Milieu 
books - all the previous ones, plus many more.

As for when....who knows? :)

For the Imperium, I\'d say it\'s just Holiday.  Each world is going to have 
its own set of holidays, of course.  Adding a bunch of Imperial holidays 
on top of that would probably result in no work days left at all. [grin]

Sylean Federation - good question.  They might have held over all the 
Sylean holidays, or might have gone with no "federal" holidays...

Hi Chuck,

I can tell you something about it, but to avoid confusion (especially in 
terms - talking about "IG" gets confusing when the recent changes are 
forgotten) I\'ll start from the beginning.  

Disclaimer: This is told from the limited information I have - I\'m just 
an observer, and I didn\'t observe everything, I\'m sure.  But, I\'ll give 
you what I do know. (BTW, this is all information given in my various IG 
News postings, postings by Marc Miller, etc. - it\'s just never been 
presented together in one post before.)

At the beginning of this year, Game Designers\' Workshop closed its 
doors.  At that point, the rights to the Traveller product line produced 
by GDW reverted to Marc Miller, as per GDW\'s articles of incorporation.  
Marc formed Far Future Enterprises to take care of this property known as 
"Traveller."

Soon thereafter, Marc Miller looked around for a publisher for his 
property.  Eventually, he found Sweet Pea Entertainment, which had no 
experience in the RPG industry, but which was willing to finance the 
venture.  So, Marc and Sweet Pea came to an agreement.  But, they still 
needed someone to do the game design, production, and sales.

So, Marc got in touch with some of the heavy-hitters of the RPG 
industry- Ken Whitman, Tim Brown, Greg Porter, and the rest of the 
people we associated with Imperium Games - and asked them to do the 
design and whatnot for Traveller\'s fourth edition.

Ken became president of Imperium Games, the other people were given their 
various tasks (Tim doing Aliens, Greg Porter handling equipment, Don 
Perrin doing starships, and so on).  They got to work, and eventually 
produced T4. 

In the final stages of the process, it became apparent that game 
designers do not necessarily make the best business people.  We all know 
the problems with the main rulebook\'s launch, the credit charges, and so 
on, so I won\'t go into that.  Suffice it to say that things didn\'t go as 
planned, for various reasons.

By October, Sweet Pea decided to take over the business end of things - 
taking orders, shipping product, etc. - and let the group already in 
place do the design work.  

The agreement they all eventually reached was this:  Sweet Pea\'s 
employees would run Imperium Games; the people formerly associated with 
Imperium Games would become an independent company, Authority Publishing 
& Design.  AP&D would not only do the design work for Traveller, they 
would also pursue other projects.  These changes went into effect on 
November 15, 1996.

With things divided that way, it was no longer necessary for Ken to be 
president of Imperium Games - the folks at Sweet Pea were taking care of 
the business end, and "president" is a business function, not a game 
design function.

Ken was then free to pursue other projects.  In a phone conversation we 
had on this subject, Ken said, "I\'m the type who likes to create and 
move on."  Ken is very creative, and has a lot of great ideas, there is 
no doubt.  I\'ve heard him in action, and I am greatly impressed by his 
ability to come up with innovative gaming concepts on the spur of the 
moment.  He\'s also a great one to bounce ideas off of - he\'s good at 
spotting holes in a concept, and coming up with new ideas that improve 
upon the original idea.  Okay, sorry to blather on so much about his 
ability as a game designer. :)  Suffice it to say, he\'s good at what he 
does. 

Anyway, since Ken was now free to pursue other projects, that\'s just what 
he is doing.  He\'s working on Groo, and he\'s hinted about some future 
collaboration with Marc Miller on a fantasy RPG.  That\'s where Ken is now 
- - he\'s exited the Traveller picture.  That\'s what the news item on IG\'s 
web site means by "Ken Whitman is no longer associated with the Traveller 
product line."

As for the rest of the folks associated with Traveller, they\'re still 
there.  They\'re designing the Traveller products, and Imperium Games is 
printing and selling them.  If I recall correctly, Tony Lee is now doing 
the typsetting and editing functions that Ken used to perform.

It\'s a much more logical and effective division of labor.  IG is a 
business organization.  AP&D is a creative organization.  Each is doing 
what it does best, and is not hampered by attempting to do everything at 
once.

I hope this clears up any confusion about the subject.

Ah, yes.  Leave it to those Imperial swine to take a day off of work just 
because their precious Emperor is a year older.  It is little wonder our 
superior Solomani culture is dominant, and gaining power day by day.  We

Hmm . . . tasty food for thought to chase down the holiday feast, Eris.

Religious Holidays: Given that the Imperium is socially diverse and
tolerant, it won\'t have a single religious holiday quite like Christmas. I
imagine that the 14 days around  Day 001 of the Imperial calender  _might_
coincide with a solstice on Sylea (a holiday for earth-religion types)
and/or an ancient cultural tradition like the Roman Saturnalia . . . or the
holiday schedule might well be divorced from ancient influences of
planetary motion. 

In my game, it\'s the latter.

IMHO, virtually any or every day on the Imperial calender could be a
holiday for one or more religious minorities, but as far as "National
Holidays" are concerned, they would be pretty much like our own --
celebrations marking important dates in national history.

Two holidays are canonical in CT/MT/T4, one in TNE . . . .

Holiday: Day 001 is celebrated as both New Year\'s Day and as Imperial Day,
marking the founding of the Third Imperium. Federation Day, celebrating the
foundation of the Sylean Federation, does not coincide with Holiday.

The Emperor\'s Birthday: Lucan\'s, according to the _Rebellion Sourcebook_,
is Day 302. Within a noble\'s domain, the  birthday of that particular noble
is a good day for a celebration long on fun and short on symbolism.

In the Reformation Coalition, Holiday is replaced with Reformation Day.

Conjectual Holidays: I would imagine that many Imperial holidays are
extentions of those of the Sylean Federation.

I can think of but one holiday everyone can accept:  a holiday to remember
those who gave their lives.   

Rememberance Day: Celebrated to honor those who gave their lives in
Imperial service. I know Canada has one of these, and by the same name . .
. I\'m just trying to avoid applying too many damned Americanisms to the
Imperium (Happy, Michael Berry? :)).

I\'m also sure that the Imperial holiday calender has days added by Imperial
proclaimation, much like the way holidays are added to the modern American
calender by Presidential proclaimation or Act of Congress. An example of
the latter might be Empress\' Arbetrella (sp) Day, a day made a Holiday in
the 640s to mark the end of the Imperial Civil War and the establishment of
the Akhalaoli (sp again, damnit!) dynasty. You can bet that even 40+ years
after Archduke Norris\' death, his birthday is still celebrated as a
holiday.

I disagree. While superficially M0 and TNE are similiar in that an ongoing
theme is rebuilding, the atmosphere is vastly different. In M0, the
nobility is a significant factor, with a powerful interstellar government
already in place. In TNE, there is no interstellar nobility. Even in the
Regency, the one place in the Imperium not "collapsed" by Virus, the
nobility is _on the way out the door_. A second difference lies in the time
frames of the Long Night (1700+ years) preceding M0 versus the 75-year
"Short Nap" between Viral Release and the New Era. A star nation can do a
lot of recovering in 1700 years . . . but the RC hasn\'t had 5% of that

I think MM may have wanted to do something with enough Classical flavor for
the old-guard fans, but different enough to enspire creativity.

Well, I (obviously) disagree. While there certainly are differences between 
the two settings, I think the differences are what is superficial, and the 
similarity overwhelming.

I don\'t dispute word of what you wrote, but what real difference is it 
going to make to a Traveller player? None really.

FWIW, I\'m glad MM didn\'t go back to  1115. Pretty much any of the other 
Traveller settings have a certain, oh, I don\'t know, a certain excitement 
to them that the original CT setting lacked. Of course, this is very, very 
IMHO.

Norris really has little to offer the Vargr. We\'re left with the impression
in Rebellion that it is all he can do to keep the corsairs out. I do agree
that with the Aslan secured as an ally, and with a quick resolution with the
Zhodani (we\'re not going to extend your way if you don\'t extend our way),
Norris could have shifted his forces more to trailward. That and the fact
that even concentrated corsair attacks are of little concern to dedicated
fleet elements clearing a path. A return of a strong military presence to
Corridor would be required, but if he had the forces...

I still see where he\'s facing a potential two-front war assuming he can get
past the Vilani. Assuming they don\'t stalemate with him and he does break
out into the core sectors, he then has to contend with Dulinor AND Lucan.
Both of them attacked Strephon when he laid his claim to restore the
Imperium. Why wouldn\'t they both attack Norris? There\'s just a lot to
overcome to even come close to restoring the Imperium. Even with Dulinor,
Lucan, and the Vilani weakened, Norris would be fighting a multi-front war
in devastated areas two or more sectors away from his home base. Seems like
he\'d be overextending himself a little much wouldn\'t you say?

First, regarding the M0 vs. TNE campaigns, I never much cared for TNE,
particularly the core rules, though I rather liked FFS.  Just my opinion.  M0
certainly has more of the flavor of CT, so we\'ll give her a shot and see how
she holds up.  I recently was reading Tarsus again (truly outstanding
module), and was reminded of how special CT was.  TNE never seemed to have
that kind of feel, and T4/M0 is still a little rough around the (production)

Second, the whole Virus/Anti-Virus thread.  I wasn\'t here when that was done

Sorry, but I think you\'re talking apples and oranges.  

Canon has Artifical Gravity, and I-Comp, continuing to be effective at
beyond Grav-Drive ranges.  Shoot, your grav-plates continue to work in Jump
Space, and that\'s *way* beyond 1000 diameters!  <G> As I understand the
pseudo-theory, while grav-drives and grav-plates are both based on the
ability to control gravity the *technology* is very different.

Maybe you\'re right here. The fine distinctions matter most to those of us
on the TML and other rabid Trav fanatics; the players in my campaign can\'t
care less.

I have to agree here . . . CT was too "civilized" a setting, the Imperium a
society without open frontiers to explore. The Rebellion had the charms of
an open-ended war and a ripped-up society to play with, but I couldn\'t
really get into "supporting" a faction the way I could root for my favorite
_BattleTech_ House or merc unit. TNE has lots and lots of room for
exploring, lots of opportunity for combat action in the name of a good
cause. M0 is a mix of the open frontiers and small government of TNE with
the organization and color of the Third Imperium.

> who\'s favourite setting, though not rules, was from MT

 . . . but not here. My favorite setting _and_ rules are the RC and TNE.
Basically, it was TNE that dragged my gaming life  back from a death-spiral
into the twin pits of 90s roleplaying angst: CCGs and World of
Darkness-style "Dark" games. TNE gave me hope that the dark menace that is
WWGS would not grow to dominate the hobby; T4 gives me hope that sf is
making a gaming comback at last.

It has been brought to my attention that one or more web sites are
presenting data copied, derived or in some cases expanded from previous
Traveller material, stretching back as far as the days of White Dwarf (when
it used to cover Traveller, etc.).

There is clearly no problem with people copying a few sentences verbatim, or
with making significant additions to such material.

HOWEVER, IT IS POLITE - IF NOT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT IN SOME INSTANCES - TO
QUOTE THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE MATERIAL, INCLUDING THE AUTHOR(S).

I know we all love having web sites with as much stuff as possible on them,

a writer uses other people\'s work then submits it to someone else\'s web

        I agree with Eris on large enough ships having multiple power
plants: the 1000td TL-11 airframe disk megayacht (tentatively named the
"Caligula") I designed and whose deckplan I\'m going to finish off once
exams are over has three fusion plants rather than just one, and I\'m going
to be spacing the T-plates in a half-dozen locations in a circle around the
underside.

        Redundancy, redundancy, redundancy... redundancy, redundancy.

        Oh yes: the T-plates go on the underside, which means that up is
though the flat axis...  so with the TL-11 2g inertial comps running flat
out, it\'ll get the full 3g\'s out of its M-drive without inconveniencing its
passengers.

        Hm... maybe I should have put 4g plates on the puppy :).

        I think that I agree with Leonard on the orientation issue; unless
the function of the ship is such that it has to have down at right angles
to the M-drive\'s axis or suffer serious inconvenience, and/or the layout is
such that you have safety measures to prevent people falling long and hard
if you lose I-comp and the M-drive is so low-performance it doesn\'t matter
much anyhow, it\'ll be oriented vertically.

I found that the Imperium was just too big. Anything that could threaten
it had to be almost as big (the Zhodani, the Solomani etc). HUGE fleets
of HUGE ships. Massive travel times. There was also the fact that the
Imperium was no longer expanding, and that all of it\'s borders were
generally well explored. The scouts had become an internal survey and
messager service.
In order to find excitement my players generally ended up breaking the
law.
I ended up generating my own campaign backgrounds with much smaller
empires, federations etc.
This way I could bring the homeworlds of all thase interesting aliens
much closer. How can the K\'kree threaten the Imperium if there border is
so far away that conflict is very unlikely.

The rebellion was a good thing (it made sense too). It broke the Empire
into smaller more manageable chunks. It was also beginning to make
travel an interesting prospect, with the UPP of worlds being different
than
what was in the library data. Makes it more exciting if the starport you
expected is just a radioactive crater.

By 1130 the map looked quite nice, I would have liked it to stay that
way for a while, with no one faction prevailing. Perhaps having them
evolve into nations with outward expanding frontiers.

I liked the virus idea, the R.C. was a great basis for exploratory
adventures, but if I was to choose a faction, it would have to be 
the Solomani.

Why bother going to core? Make Mora the capital, that way it would be

Actually, the original article was aimed towards Traveller players, but I
suppose it could be used for just about any game system.  The charts are in
d100 format.

I toyed briefly with the idea of converting it to a "d66" system, to better
suit "real" Traveller players, but the mechanics were easier with d100.

Alrighty. That last line just forced me to respond. I take the exact
opposite view of what you say. The _similarities_ are superficial. In
fact, the only similarity I can think of is that both milieux have
interstellar societies that are trying to recontact isolated words and
build a larger society (read: empire). The differences are numerous, and
they are _not_ superficial, they _are_ going to be important to a
Traveller player-character.

M0: New tech devolps (fusion plus) helping to drive the rebuilding of
interstellar culture. The general attitude is favourable towards
technology, expansion and recontact. After the long night, in many but
not all cases, worlds are ready and willing to be recontacted. Nobility
is a strong unifying force.

Generalization: Diplomacy is more important than brute force in this
atmosphere.

M1200: Tech has been decimated. Levels are basically the same as M0,
except there are TL-15 relics scattered throughout space. General
attitude of the citizenry: Tech is evil, Tech is to be feared. TED\'s
oppress people. Nobility is reviled as the force which brought about the
destruction of the universe. Xenophobia is rampant.

Generalization: Diplomacy is impossible. The RC takes the view that
military action is necessary.

To illustrate my point, here\'s the typical M1200 "Star Viking"
player-character interacting with a civilian on a world in the wilds:

RC: We helped topple that Technologically Enhanced Dictator for you,
citizen. We will now assist in your rejoining the worlds of the New
Dawn.
Citizen: Forget it, bub. Just leave us alone. I\'m not going to be a part
of your Lucanic empire.
RC: Don\'t you want to be a part of a vast and glorious empire rising out
of the ashes of the old? Don\'t you want the benefits advance technology
brings?
Citizen: I just want to tend my field and raise my family. Get the hell
off my planet. Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I have to go milk my grobilt.

And now a typical Sylean talking to Joe Average on a recontacted world:

Sylean: Heyyyy... nice planet. Listen! Why don\'t you join our glorious
new Imperium?
Citizen: They told us about that Imperium thing in Ancient History
class. Sounds kinda neat. But what\'s in it for me?
Sylean: Look, I got this. <whips out his Mr. Fusion+ (tm) portable
energy plant> Feed it some water, and get virtually unlimited energy!
Citizen: Coooool. I\'m sick of refeulling my gravcar. My neighbor got one
of them Fusion+ thingies from a Trader. We can talk later about this
Imperium thing, but if you\'ll excuse me, the wife asked me to buy some
grobilt milk at the MiniMart.

On that theory you could say that the Napoleonic Wars and WWII were
viturally identical. Both featured short megalomanics who tried to invade
Russia and failed.

>I don\'t dispute word of what you wrote, but what real difference is it 
>going to make to a Traveller player? None really.

The difference is in the attitude.  TNE characters were rooting around for
the bits of high tech left untouched by Virus, seeing world after world
where untold billions had died, and still facing the threat that a Vampire
Fleet could destroy the whole thing.

Milieu: 0 is set at the dawn of a new age, when after two thousand years of
quiet mankind is stepping forth again.  The Scouts of the New Imperium
aren\'t going to have the 70-year old records the Star Vikings had, they\'ll
make do with rumor and legend, the merchants will be drooling over the new
markets, and the never-do-wells of 20 worlds will be heading for the
frontier as fast as they can to try to stake their fortune.

Remember that for the people of M:0, the Rule of Man is as remote as the
Roman Empire is to us today.  The odd ruin here and there, maybe a few
decaying orbital facilities, but for the most part, it has passed into myth.
How will people react when the PC\'s Type S burns down to land on Parliment\'s
front lawn to announce the Third Imperium?  Cheers?  A Parade?  Or perhaps a
lynch mob?  A lot can change in 1700 years.. A world that was once an
industrial giant may have been destroyed in a nuclears war, while what was a
small agricultural colony in -1776 might now be a TL11 industrial giant.

Someday, I\'m going to start a campaign in 1104 and take all the way through
the 5th Frontier War.  Set in my favorite subsector (Lunion), I\'ll play up
the whole hightening of tensions, border incidents, and have the PC\'s Far
Trader a little to close to the Sword Worlds border when the hostilities
start...

Milieu 0 gives you the same adventure potential as TNE, but coming from a
much more positive and wider ranging background, i.e. you can play highish
tech (Syleans, few pocket empires), medium tech (survivors of Long Night),
low tech (newly rediscovered planet natives, etc.). It\'s so much more
flexible than TNE and doesn\'t require suspension of disbelief over something
as argument-creating as the Virus.

The Milieu 0 book gives an interesting slant however even to the \'positive\'
side of Cleon\'s expansion, and there are so many adventure hooks in there
anyone ought to be able to create games for the period, for any class of
character. Plus there\'s the political power games of the Moot and the Nobles
to try out. I just hope it makes it to print soon!

Ok, so I would have liked to run a campaign like that also. I was just
pointing out the practicalities and problems of such an endeavor, not
wholeheartedly stomping on it. :) Norris and Strephon would have been an
almost guaranteed alliance. If Norris could win the Vilani over and let him
use their territory as a staging ground from which to attack Lucan and then
turn on Ilelish, well, then perhaps he would have had a chance. Still don\'t
buy Margaret. She would have required that Norris at least acknowledge one
of her heirs as the new emperor and would have wanted him to incorporate his
territory into her little government. Margaret was a bit too self-absorbed
to help Norris. Still, this is a game. Anything\'s possible. That\'s where
good dramas are born...and speaking of great drama...

>Desperate times call for heroic measures, that\'s what great drama is
>made of.

You want drama?
I ran a Rebellion campaign that required a group of ex-military, including a
couple of high-ranking Navy types, to get from the beseiged Solomani Rim all
the way to Deneb. They were just about to begin their retirement when news
of the Emperor\'s assassination reached them on Terra. They decided that the
Rim was not safe as it would be crawling with Solomani war fleets in no
time, and they correctly predicted that the sectors between Lucan and
Dulinor would turn into killing fields, and that the only safe haven might
be in Deneb, which seemed to be out of the main fight. So they had to make
an end run around both Lucan and Dulinor\'s realms, picking fights, helping
refugees, and sacrificing much of their personal properties and even some
friends, but they reached Deneb and some degree of safety, only to be
dragged in to Norris\' plans to try to feel out the rest of the Imperium for
possible reunification, and guess who he decided to pick to help out in that
mission...
Was that good enough? :)

And don\'t forget, the low tech planets may also be those whose
socities were so severely disrupted during the Long Night that they 
regressed severely.  Interstellar war, even when conducted among only a 
few planets, can have devastating effects on a society, to say the least.

Not to mention the interesting economic expansion plan laid out by the 
newly born Imperium.  Fans of economics and trade will definitely find many, 
many adventure hooks worthy of being expanded upon.  At the same time, 
those who take a more liberal view will find much to fight against.

Allright, we K\'kree have held our noses for long enough on this list. We 
had felt that Traveller list members were perhaps more enlightened than 
your average human barbarian, and we had planned to give you all the 
honoured position of kr\'rrir (subjects) of the glorious Two Thousand 
Worlds, after suitable rrab!ak (re-education) of course.

But not now. You are all hearby declared g\'naak, and you can expect a visit

Sure, small, marginal, colonies would either die off or end up loosing all

8-10 and stick there.  There was no devastating collapse where the
technological base of the Imperium was destroyed.  The Long Night was a

Going out to recontact a lot of TL 8-11 worlds sounds a lot more fun than

the Imperium\'s neighbours are limited to TL11, it would have been nice
to see some of the standard ship types like free traders and scouts
built at earlier tech levels so that you could use them as a basis for
Vargr or Zhodani vessels (which have little access to TL12 technology,
especially civilian craft).

Of course, if the Imperium has had TL12 for some time now (50 years
minimum, just to allow trader captains to own their TL12 vessels
outright prior to game play) this might be a moot point.  I know that
there are significant advantages to TL12 but it just seems strange to
me that civilian vessels have such easy access to what some might
consider "new technology".  If you add up all of the TL12 shipyards in
the Imperium, it hardly seems accurate that so many would be producing
civilian craft, especially with the Imperium in its current state of
expansion (ie: the need for military craft should take priority).

   When asked this question during the Traveller seminar held at Gen Con,
Marc Miller\'s reply was simply, "no Virus".  This drew a round of applause
from the classic and MegaTraveller fans in the audience, and grumbles and
evil glares from TNE fans.  I won\'t comment on Marc\'s lack of diplomacy
skills, but that is the short answer.

   The long answer is that the Milieu 0 setting takes place in an era much
later in relation to the collapse that preceeded it.  Thus, there aren\'t any
Remnants to tell you how artifacts work, and the working artifacts that
remain are much fewer and farther between.  There are probably more pocket
empires in the Milieu 0 era, though they are restricted to TL 11 or less.
 The atmosphere of Milieu Zero is suppose to be more "frontier-like", less
dark than TNE, though it should be said that the writers of TNE never
intended it to be as dark as some people made it out to be.  It should also
be noted that there is no TL 13+ equipment in Milieu Zero (at least none of
current manufacture available to the PCs), and your player-character\'s
actions are to a degree limited by historical events (yes, I know what IG,
Marc et al have said, but...), whereas the future in TNE is left pretty wide
open, and there is always the TL 16 sanctuary of the Regency to fall back on.

>So since the two settings are essentially identical, why did they bother 
>coming up with a new setting? If Marc Miller really wanted to get back to 
>Classic Traveller, why didn\'t he set things back in 1115, or whenever.

   I thought the best solution would have been to advance the storyline of
TNE up about 800 years and have the setting revolve around a new Imperium.
 Others have suggested solutions similar to yours, and some have even
advocated trashing canon storylines altogether.

   Ultimately, the decision was made to go back in history with T4 rather
than continue to advance the storyline, at least for now.  It was a creative
choice, made by people who have a lot more at stake professionally and
financially than we do.  It is up to you to decide if they made the right
call, and if so, buy T4 products.

>By the way, no one is holding a gun up against your head forcing you to use 
>the Virus. If you want a united empire under Norris, JUST DO IT!

   My solutions for a non-Virus, post-Rebellion Solomani Rim and Solomani
Confederation are hinted at in Traveller Chronicle #11.  Basically the Treaty
of Altair, which ends the Rebellion in this part of space, merely signals a
transition from Solomani vs. Imperial to Solomani vs. Solomani warfare.  The
coming Solomani Civil War is hinted at on several occasions in MT, and would
have effectively caused the Confederation to collapse at least in the short
term.  Ideally the Moderate and Liberal factions could have won the struggle
for control, and created a new Solomani Confederation.

   It is unlikely that Norris could have patched back together the Imperium,
Virus or not.  The Imperium was basically dead by the late 1120s, and Norris,
surrounded on three sides by hostile or potentially hostile forces, was in no
position to launch a crusade across the Great Rift to save the day.

   Not all stories have happy endings....

Regards,

Harold

What are you feeding the chirpers? And why can\'t the humans eat that
*instead*. 

Remember, if the humans *can* eat it, it\'ll support roughly ten times
as many people as feeding it to chirpers, then eating the chirpers will.

I really hated (passionately) the campaign setting of TNE.  I\'m not the type
of person who has a "Magic Happens" bumper sticker, but, for the love of God,
could TNE have been any more somber, morose, or self-righteous?  Toppling
TEDs with mortars, plasma weapons, grenades, and a few grav tanks is not, and
never will be, IMHO what made CT the game we all loved in the first place.  I
like war games.  I liked D&D for a long, long time.  I really liked
Twilight:2000.  But I loved Traveller.  Traveller was, and is, different,
because it\'s tone is so much more optimistic than any other RPG I can recall.
 It\'s players and their characters (in the best campaigns with which I was
involved) often put altruistic goals ahead of profits, for the sake of
furthering the story.  It is science-fiction at it\'s finest.  It is a view of
a better world, a better place.  (Why do I feel like the "hippie" counselor
in the film Heathers?)  Dave Nilsen once wrote in Challenge that certain
moral elements of TNE were emphasized because, "some things are just right,
dammit."  Unfortunately, he wrote this in response to the need to eliminate
TEDs (Although I do agree they should have been eliminated.  Better yet, they
should never have been created.)  I\'m not opposed to violence in RPGs.  I\'m
opposed to RPGs existing for the purpose of perpetrating violence.  (Except,
maybe, BattleTech.)  I actively encourage my PCs to avoid violence, in all
but extreme circumstances, because bullets and lasers will kill you.  I don\'t
mean for this to come across as a heavy-handed, moralistic sermon, however; I
simply believe violence in RPGs loses it\'s effectiveness as a storytelling
opportunity when it is the only story there is.  If you want nothing but
combat (which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing) break out one of the many great
war games that have been created (I still enjoy CT-Era "Invasion:Earth," the
story of the final battle of the Solomani Rim War.)  

Milieu 0, OTOH, strikes me as reaching for the sense of wonder, the sense of
story, the sense of awe, that only exists in the very best science-fiction
has to offer.  There isn\'t enough evidence yet to say that it always
succeeds, but, I\'m encouraged by the tenor of what has been published.  And,
there exists the mechanism for the inevitable gunfights, fistfights, chases,
and fleet battles that will arise.  When combat is used sparingly, the sense
of excitement and danger is enhanced, helping to drive the story.  Which is
my goal in refereeing Traveller in the first place.

has anybody tried using genetic algorithms to figure out which kind

also, as I understand, _massive_ population pressure on the two main Core
worlds of Sylea and Ordun. The kind of population pressure that can only be
relieved by a combination of an Exodus and/or prisoner transportation a la
Great Britain, the US and Australia.

A lot can change in 1700 years..

Yeah, a change from TL1 to the cusp of TL9,  the rise and fall of _several_
empires in the Western world alone: Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, British,
Spanish, French, Inca, Aztec, Persian, Arab . . . .

Traveler in Milleu 0, yet most of the ships listed in the T4 main
rulebook are built using the newest technology.  It seems strange to
me that there are so few TL11 (or earlier) ships mentioned.

Good point. In my game -- where an Imperium of 20 worlds has a potent and
active enemy on the same Main (the Ardin Star Empire, centered on Ardis and
Eneri), the Imperium\'s _only_ major advantage over the Ardins is the tech
edge (I reduced both Ardis and Eneri to Tech 11 at the start of my game).
The Ardins are more aggressive, more ruthless, a _lot_ more foresighted,
and finally, are not laboring under Sylea\'s delusions of military adequacy.

The Syleans must get tough and mean as well as smart -- and soon -- or the
Ardins will win.

If all of the Imperium\'s neighbours are limited to TL11, it would have been
nice
to see some of the standard ship types like free traders and scouts
built at earlier tech levels so that you could use them as a basis for
Vargr or Zhodani vessels (which have little access to TL12 technology,
especially civilian craft).

Sounds like a project . . . . ;)

Of course, if the Imperium has had TL12 for some time now (50 years
minimum, just to allow trader captains to own their TL12 vessels
outright prior to game play) this might be a moot point.  I know that
there are significant advantages to TL12 but it just seems strange to
me that civilian vessels have such easy access to what some might
consider "new technology".  If you add up all of the TL12 shipyards in
the Imperium, it hardly seems accurate that so many would be producing
civilian craft, especially with the Imperium in its current state of
expansion (ie: the need for military craft should take priority).

And it _does_. Right now, in my game, I have made TL-11 designs of all
Imperial Major Combatants (in my game-world, there is a techno-babble-based
limit of 5000 tons on starships . . . this lets me design all possible
ships with QSDS until a \'technological breakthrough\' makes it possible to
jump more than 5000 displacement tons through space). It\'s arbitrary, but
it works for me:)

The "classic" setting has been pretty thoroughly done.  It\'s a great time in which to 
set adventures (I set all of my stuff then), in part because it so rich in detail, but 
what more could be published?  DGP and HIWG have filled in all of the sectors.  The

Yes, that\'s just what they are -- the terrorists any referee is looking for.  

The Imperial authorities tended to lump together any anti-Imperial activism in the 
Spinward Marches under the rubric "Ine Givar."  This was largely Admiral Santanocheev\'s 
fault.  Santanocheev, we recall, was the Sector Admiral for the Spinward Marches, who so 
distrusted Imperial Naval Intelligence that he set up his own intelligence department, 
which reported directly to him.

Santanocheev\'s problem with INI was that its reports didn\'t match his own paranoia that 
there was a single, Zhodani-backed campaign to unseat the Imperium from control of the 
Marches (his own sycophants, of course, reinforced his paranoia).  He couldn\'t or 
wouldn\'t accept the fact that many independent groups, for varying reasons, were working 
- -- often violently -- to change the status quo in the Marches.  Certainly many of these 
movements were funded by the Zhodani or Sword Worlds, but there was no unitary plot, and 
the inspiration for these groups\' activities came from conditions within the Imperium, 
not from external sources.

Some examples:  The Tanoose Freedom League was trying to free Garda-Vilis from 
domination by Vilis. (Adventure 7, Broadsword.)  The Zid Rachele Society was a Vilani 
racist group trying to expunge Solomani influence from the Imperium (although mostly in 
Deneb Sector, and not so much in the Marches).  (Imperial Encyclopedia.)  

In answer to your question, however, there isn\'t much on the Ine Givar -- not even a 
library data entry.  I\'m not even sure how the name is intended to be pronounced.  Is 
the "e" silent or voiced?  Is the "g" hard or soft?
Ein Ghivar?  Inay Zhivar?  you pick

Many planets would probably celebrate a holiday like Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving  
commemorates the survival of Plymouth Colony after the "starving time" of the first few
years.  All of the North American colonies went through starving times when they were
first established.  Eventually resupply from Europe arrived, and, more importantly, the
colonists\' farms began to produce adequate crops -- or they finally succeeded in driving
the natives off the fertile land and relocating the colony\'s farms there.
 
Interstellar colonies would probably also experience hardship in getting established,
and then celebrate their success.
 
On another note, Rethe/Spinward Marches celebrates a holiday called "Festival",
characterized by three days of anarchy, much like in the Star Trek (Classic) episode
"Return of the Archons."  I think that it\'s in The Traveller Book, or the Traveller
Adventure.
 
As far as Imperial Holidays, we know of the Emperor\'s Birthday and Holiday (i.e., the 
first day of the year).

Well, your mileage may vary, as they say.  The CT setting often reminded me of England 
under Victoria.  Brave nobles and their private armies would go off to exotic locales 
for adventures, then return to the club or the Royal Geographic Society to regale the 
stay-at-homes with their stories.  That was neither too civilized nor too big for me.

It\'s also worth noting that the two astrographic regions that were the most developed in 
the CT era were the Spinward Marches and the Solomani Rim --  both border areas filled 
with tension and mystery.  

Even in the middle of the Imperium, there is so much diversity among member states that 
there is always something to surprise.

    'body' => 'Let\'s try this again.

I originally started to post these rules when I ran into a conversion 
problem.  I fixed it, and now I\'m posting my House Rules for any of 
you out there who are interested.

You\'ll find that my rules follow very closely those laid down in the 
T4 main book.  I\'ve supplemented them with rules that I\'ve liked from 
several magazines (JTAS, Traveller\'s Digest, etc.), all versions 
of Traveller (converted to T4, of course), and my own designs.

One of the main things I did was to make the critical hit rule (the 
one where the first hit must be taken off an ability at random 
allowing quick kills and the like) to only happen on a spectacular 
success.  I thought that it was not realistic to make each first hit 
a critical hit, and I also think that if a critical hit is possible, 
it must be possible on any to hit throw--not just the first.

So, my solution was to make spectacular success the critical hit.  
The chance that this will happen is much less likely than as 
described in the T4 main book (because it happens 100% of the time, on 
the first hit, as described there), and this pleases me.  It will 
keep the PCs alive longer in a fight, but still there is the chance 
that the critical hit will ocurr.  And this could be devestating if 
the character is already wounded.

So here\'s parts one, two, and three of my House Rules.

Kenneth.



		TRAVELLER

	        T4 BASIC COMBAT SYSTEM



I.  GENERAL NOTES.
 	1.  These rules, with some modification, are taken 
	from the T4 Main Book.

 	2.  To Hit Number.  This is determined by a character\'s
	 skill and base  attribute.  We will use the modified system 
	(called on the Traveller Mailing List KBv1.1) that I 	
	 designed.  That is--double the skill and add it to
  	half the attribute (rounding up).

  	KBv1.1 also alters the amount of dice thrown for difficulty.  
	Easy, Average, Difficult, and Formidable stay as is, but 
	Staggering is changed to 4 dice, and Impossible is 	 
	changed to 5 dice.

 	3.  Spectacular Success.  When this is rolled, the attacker is
 	entitled to a critical hit.  See the notes on spectacular success 
	on pg. 50 of T4.

 	4.  Spectacular Failure.  This is usually a fumble of some sort, 
	but also may be some other stroke of bad luck.  See the notes on 
	pg. 50 of T4.



II.  SURPRISE.	
 	1.  Surprise is covered on pg. 51 of T4.

 	2.  Surprise Procedure.  Roll 1 D6 for each party.  If one party 
	rolls at least 3 higher than the other, surprise has been achieved.  
	It is possible that neither party will achieve surprise, and if 
	this is the case, both parties are considered to be aware of 	
	 each other.	

DMs to the Surprise Throw				.
Battle Dress worn by any member		+2
  Highest Leadership skill			+ skill level
  Highest Tactics skill			+ skill level
  Highest Recon skill			+ skill level
  Military training (Army or Marines only)		+1
  Party includes a vehicle			-1
  Party has 8+ people			-1
  Party has 10+ animals			-1
  Party consists entirely of pouncers (animals)	+1

 	3.  Benefits of Surprise.  The party with surprise may elect 
	to avoid contact with the other party or engage in combat.  
	Melee strikes done with the benefit of surprise do 	 
	not count against the End limit for a character--see pg. 60, T4.

  	Surprise continues until lost.  Any alarm will automatically end
  	surprise.  An unsilenced shot can do this, as can a member of the
  	target party warning others in  some manner.  Any target that is
  	hit, but not immediately rendered unconscious, will generally make
  	sufficient noise to alert others.

  	Note that laser weapons, silenced pistols, and all guns in vacuum do
  	not make any (or minimal) noise when fired.

 	4.  Loosing Surprise.  If no alarm is raised as detailed above, there
 	is still a chance, each time an attack is made, that an unattacked 
	comrade of the victim will see him fall, or become alerted by 
	some other means, and give out warnings.

  	Roll 5- on 2 D6 for this to occur.

 	5.  Encounter Range.  This is covered on pg. 51 of T4.  The 
	GM will generally handle this.  

 	6.  Avoidance.  This rule is for parties that do not have surprise. 
 	Parties that have surprise can avoid contact with the other party 
	simply by stating it (and moving quietly).  If two parties 
	encounter each other, both without surprise, either may 	
	 attempt to avoid contact before combat occurs with this 
	procedure.		

  	Roll (3 + Range Number) or less on 2 D6 to avoid.



III.  THE COMBAT ROUND.
 	1.  Combat Round Notes.  This continues to be six seconds long.  
	The AHL Tactical Combat System splits these rounds in 
	half--resulting in two three second phases.

  	Within each round, a character is allowed to move and attack.  The
  	Initiative throw determines who goes first.  Generally, movement
  	is completed first, with the lowest initiative throw going first.
   	This allows characters with high initiative throws an advantage
  	because they are able to react to other\'s movement.  

  	Then combat is determined after everybody has had a chance 
	to move, but the high initiative characters go first to allow them 
	to shoot or strike first (and thus gain an advantage if they hit).  
	The GM may modify this based on the situation.

  	Combat Round Procedures.  In general, a combat round will play 
	out like this.

  	     1.  Initiative Throw.
  	     2.  Movement is done--lowest initiative throw moving first.
  	     3.  Combat--highest initiative throw attacking first.

 	2.  Initiative.    There are several ways to determine initiative--by
 	group size, by group roll, or by individual roll.  The specifics 
	on these are listed on pg. 52 of T4, but generally, we will be 
	using the individual roll method.  

  	Individual Initiative.  I\'ve made a slight modification to the
  	initiative rules to allow a 	 character to take advantage of his
  	Dex, Leadership, or Tactics levels.

  	Individual Initiative Throw:  1 D6 for higher dice.

  DMs to Individual Initiative Throw						     .
  Highest Leadership skill on character\'s side	+ skill level
  Character\'s Tactics skill (see note below)*		+ skill level
  Dex 5-9				+1
  Dex 10-14				+2
  Dex 15+				+3
  Minor Wound			-1
  Serious Wound			-3
  Critical Wound			-5
  Draw				-3
  Weapon Bulk			- bulk rating

  	Notes:  All ties mean that the combat is simultaneous.  If a
  	character uses any Tactics points in his initiative throw, he may
  	not use them in the Tactics pool.  Thus, a character with Tactic-2
  	could take both skill levels as a +2 on all of his initiative 	
  	throws throughout the combat, but he would not be allowed to
  	contribute to the Tactics pool.  Or, the same character could use
  	one point as a +1 to all of his initiative throws, but he could
  	only contribute 1 point to the Tactics pool.  The character could
  	also devote both points to the Tactics pool, but he would gain no 	
  	benefit to his initiative throw.  The character\'s decision for the
  	first combat will decide the use of his tactics points for the
  	rest of the round--meaning if he doesn\'t use one or some of them
  	for the Tactics pool the first time he throws for initiative, he
  	will not be allowed to contribute to the pool later in the combat.

 	3.  Movement Options.  This rule illustrates typical movement 
	actions.  Each round, a character has a movement status.  
	The effects of these are determined below.

  Walking 	A character can move approximately 15 meters per round. 
  	Walking leaves the character free to perform most actions 	
     	except aimed fire.  This is sometimes referred to as speed-1 or 	
     	S1.  Walking characters can perform ranged attacks (snapshots) 
     	at a -4 DM.  Attacks against walking characters are done at a -1
     	 DM.  Walking can be combined with the Evade action status to 	
     	increase this DM.  

  Running	A combatant can run about 30 meters per round, but this 	
     	prevents the character from making any sort of attack that 	
     	round.  However, the character may take other actions like going 
     	prone, standing up (and then running), or evading.  Every round 	
     	running counts as one fatigue point against a character\'s End.  	
     	Running is sometimes referred to as speed-2 or S2.  Attacks 	
     	against running characters are done at a -3 DM.  This can be 	
     	combined with the Evade action status to increase this DM.

  Crawling	Crawling characters can move roughly 8 to 10 meters in a 	
     	round.  The only other actions a character can take while 	
     	crawling is to go prone (to initiate the crawl) or to stand up 	
     	(ending the crawl).  A crawling character is considered prone for
     	 purposes of hand to hand and ranged attacks.

  Trotting	A trotting character can move about 20 meters in a round. 
  	The same restrictions for running apply here, except that fatigue 	
     	points are applied every 10 rounds jogging instead of every 	
     	round.  Trotting characters may perform ranged attacks 		
     	(snapshots) at a -8 DM.  Attacks against trotting characters are
     	 made at a -2 DM.  This can be combined with the Evade action 	
    	 status to increase the DM.

  Stationary	A combatant does not move, but stays where he is.  He
  	need not be standing--he could be kneeling, lying prone, etc.  		
     	Stationary targets are easier to hit, and there is a +3 DM for 	
     	attacks made against them.  The main benefit of the stationary 	
     	movement status is that stationary characters may conduct 	
     	aimed fire rather than snapshots.  This is sometimes referred to
     	 as speed-0 or S0.

  Riding	Characters in moving vehicles or on moving animals are 	
     	considered to be riding.  Characters on animals are restricted by
     	the movement status of their mounts.  The mount\'s running 	 speed
     	may be much faster than human running speed, but if the mount is
     	running, the character is restricted as if he were running. 
     	Characters in moving vehicles use the restrictions listed under
     	"walking" above.

     	(When firing at a mounted rider or target in or on a vehicle, the
     	 attacker must declare whether he is shooting at the rider or
     	his mount/vehicle.  For any missed shots, roll 2 D6.  On 11 or
     	12, the mount/vehicle was hit.  The GM may change this based on
     	 the situation.)

 	4.  Action Status.  Along with movement, a character may 
	normally perform one action each round.  These are the basic 
	types of actions.

  Go Prone	Characters can use this to initiate a crawl or drop to
  	their  stomachs in order to make a smaller target for ranged attacks.  	
     	Notice that this is a case where the action occurs before 	
     	movement, but this still counts as the character\'s action for the
     	 round.  Hand to hand attacks against prone characters are made
     	at a +3 DM.  Ranged attacks against a prone character receive 	 
	a penalty equal to twice the range number between target and 	
     	attacker.

  Stand Up	A prone character can use this action to stand up.

  Evade	This action can be combined with any movement status except 	
     	crawling or stationary.  This character is zigzagging and 		
     	attempting to dodge fire.  Attacks against evading characters are
     	made at a penalty equal to the range number between the target
     	and the attacker.  Evading characters may not make any attacks
     	during the combat round and may not use their weapons to 	 
	block or parry.  

  Strike	This can be used to make hand to hand or armed strikes
  	against an opponent in melee combat.  A character must be 
	at contact range with his opponent in order to attempt a strike.

  Ranged Attack	This includes gun fire, thrown weapons, arrow 
		shots, and even mortar fire.

 	5.  Held Actions.  A character may indicate that he is holding his
 	action until later in the round.  This could be used, for example, 
	if a character wishes to sight his rifle on a doorway and shoot 
	the first person to come through.  A character my implement 
	his held action at any time after his turn (determined by initiative), and the GM will 	 govern
  	the use of held actions.  Normally, a character using a held action
  	will go when the player indicates, but the GM will resolve special
  	situations.

 	6.  Multiple Actions.  A character may conduct multiple actions,
 	breaking the one action per round rule, by using this rule.  
	It is listed on pg. 58 of T4.

Don\'t forget the Emperor\'s Birthday! Each world may celebrate the day it 
joined the Imperium, plus any local holidays. The Solomani may still

My impression of this is as follows:
The Imperium (according to standard histories) will reach TL 13 in around 300, TL 14 in 
700 and 15 around 1000. So based on that, the Imperium has had TL 12 for less than 100 
years to keep tech increase in line with those numbers. In short, the Imperium advances 
about one tech every 300-400 years.
The Vargr ships I have posted have been TL 11. And the Zhodani are already TL 12. It is 
just that they advance about one tech for every 500 years (TL 12 in 0, TL 13 in 500, TL 14 
in 1000) which gives the imperium superior tech by the time there is full scale contact

I am not sure what you mean by genetic algorithm (bio-comp?), or your question, but a J-3 
is the overall best rating. It gives you access to the vast majority of worlds and doesn\'t turn

For great examples of this type of stuff, check out any of the nonfiction 
books by Noam Chomsky, by the way.  While his view of American economic 
agression may disturb you, there\'s no doubt it is good source material 
for an M0 setting...

Can I ask where this information can be found?  JTAS?  Challenge?

Anyone?  Anyone?  Bueller?

Just a thought - why does everyone assume that the Imperium must be  among 
the most advanced cultures in the universe? Remember that they are just 
coming out of a 1700 year period where no real technological advances were 
made. Don\'t you think they might have some catching up to do?

In building some alien (well, K\'kree) ships for use in M0, I was building 
them at TL 13. The K\'kree, and the Zhodani, and the HIvers didn\'t go 
through that 1700 year dry spell. The Aslan are very new on the 
interstellar scene (and probably not as advanced), and I just have trouble 
seeing the Vargr on the leading edge of technological development. Of 
course at some point in the future the Imperium will close that gap.

I have one question - wasn\'t the Rule of Man at TL 12? There is a reference 
in Alien Module 6 to the Solomani having jump-3 during part of the 
Interstellar Wars (and J-3 is available at TL-12. That would tend to make 
TL 12 vessels a little more common throughout the human controlled space.

        Ahem...  I think I can explain.  My friend Alan, before going on
vacation, set up his mailer to send that message in response to any
incoming mail.  It\'s a cute idea, but I guess he forgot about his TML
subscription... so he gets a digest, his mailer sends that message, he gets
the next digest, his mailer send sit again, etc, etc :).

        Please don\'t flame him; this sort of boneheadedness is extremely
unusual for Alan :).

Continuing my House Rules, here\'s ranged combat.

V.  RANGED COMBAT.
 1.  Ranged Combat Notes.  This section covers everything from thrown
 rocks to artillery fire.  These rules will be directed to the most common
  form of ranged attack, direct fire, unless otherwise noted (i.e.
  thrown weapons, indirect fire).

  Procedure.  Generally, ranged combat handled as indicated in these
  steps although  some of the alternative attack routines may alter
  this procedure.

  	1.  Determine to hit number and difficulty level based on skill,
  	ability, range, and attack routine.
  	2.  Apply any DMs.
  	3.  Roll on Hit Location Chart;  Check location for armor.
  	4.  Decrease damage dice for any armor used by defender.
  	5.  Roll and apply damage;  Check Hit Location Chart for 
	additional damage. 
	6.  Record ammunition usage.

 2.  Combat Range Table.  There can be some confusion when calculating
 range for a ranged attack because the range names sometimes refer to different
  distances.  The table below lists the base distances for each
  range category, and normally, this is the distance referred to
  when somebody mentions contact range or very long range.  Weapons,
  however, perform differently at a given range.  Therefore, a gauss
  rifle\'s contact range, with HE rounds, is up to 16 meters.  The same
  range names are used, but the actually ranges that they represent
  are changed from the base to allow advantage or disadvantage for a
  specific weapon.  

  For targets at a different altitude than the attacker, use the
  greater of the two distances--either horizontal or vertical.  

  Range Number	Range Name		Distance		Attack Rating.
   0		Contact		0-3 m			Easy
   1		Very Short		4-15 m			Average
   2		Short		16-45 m		Difficult
   3		Medium		46-150 m		Formidable
   4		Long		151-450 m		Staggering
   5		Very Long		451-1500 m		Impossible

 3.  Attack Routine--Snapfire.  Snapshots are those quick direct fire
 shots people make without taking the time to aim--just point and shoot 
quickly.  The main advantage to  snapfire attacks is that characters can move and
  shoot in the same combat round.  

  To make a to hit throw using snapfire, simply figure the range to
  the target and cross reference that on the weapon\'s sheet.  This
  will give you the difficulty.

 4.  Attack Routine--Aimed Fire.  When a shooter really wants to hit a
 target, he stops, braces himself, takes careful aim, and squeezes off a shot.  
This is basically snapfire except it is aimed and receives a bonus for doing
  so.  Each weapon chart lists a + DM for aimed shots.  Other than
  this, aimed fire is handled exactly like snapfire.  A character
  conducting aimed fire must choose stationary as his movement status
  for the turn so that he can aim.  The aim is disrupted if he is
  attacked in hand to hand combat or is hit by a ranged attack--even
  if he takes no damage due to armor.  If either of these two things
  happen before the character fires his shot, he cannot make the aimed
  shot (but could make a snapshot).  The character can try again, if
  he is able, next round.

 5.  Attack Routine--Snipe.  A character must take two actions aiming
 to conduct a snipe.  A snipe action is conducted just like aimed fire except, 
if the hit is successful, the sniping character can use his level of
 weapon skill to move the rolled hit location up or down the chart--in whatever 
direction the player wishes up to a maximum of the skill level.  In this way, a 
sniper can skew his hits to critical areas on his targets.  The GM may declare 
that the attacking character decide where he is aiming before the attack is
  made, then skew the shot towards that area on the hit location
  chart.	

 6.  Attack Routine--Autofire.  The biggest advantage to autofire is,
 since a character is firing more bullets, he gets more than one attack throw.  
This will increase the chance that a target is hit and provide for the
  possibility of additional damage.  Another benefit to this attack
  form is that the group hit rule is used--see below for details.  

  Autofire is handled like snapfire with a few exceptions. 
  Spectacular success with automatic fire results in automatic
  double damage (for the primary target only) after any subtraction
  for armor and/or cover, etc.  In this case, the maximum damage
  dice is also doubled to 6 D6--note this is an exception to the
  maximum damage rule.

  Weapons firing 4 to 5 rounds in a burst are allowed two attack
  throws per burst. Weapons firing 6 to 10 round bursts (or more), and
  weapons that are exclusively fired in the full automatic role
  (light machine guns, autocannons, VRF gauss guns,  etc.) are
  allowed three attack throws per burst.

  Any spectacular failure with automatic fire is considered a weapon
  jam.  Weapons used in the fully automatic mode cannot be used for
  aimed fire.

  Autofire Recoil.  Because of the recoil of multiple fired rounds,
  accuracy is an  issue.  Use a - DM on all autofire attacks equal to
  the range number of the target.  Due to this recoil, autofire
  cannot be aimed.

 7.  Attack Routine--Suppression Fire.  Sometimes a character may want
 to use automatic fire to interdict movement through a particular area:  a
  doorway, the mouth of an alley, the area between burned out
  vehicles, etc.  Suppression fire is a combination of the autofire
  and held action rules and can only be accomplished with 	 fully
  automatic weapons.  

  Basically, a character can designate a target area to conduct
  suppression fire against.  If anybody moves through that area, an
  immediate autofire attack can be attempted against them.  Use
  double the range number as a DM, but only throw one 	 attack no
  matter the burst size.  If a hit is achieved, normal (not double)
  damage is done.  Characters conduction suppression fire are
  allowed these immediate attacks as long as there is a target in
  their suppression target area (meaning that a character could get
  multiple actions in a round).  If more than one target moves through
  the area, standard group hits apply.

 8.  Attack Routine--Rapid Fire.  A character may wish to fire a
 continuos stream of  shots instead of controlled bursts.  If this is the case, 
increase the difficulty of the hit by one level but allow the character to
  designate three primary targets near each other.  The targets
  don\'t need to be adjacent, but they all must fall within the same 	
  45 degree arc.  Rapid fire may be used with single shot weapons, but
  when combined with fully automatic weapons, rapid fire allows
  characters to thoroughly spray an area with fire.

  Characters can use rapid fire for up to three pulls of the trigger,
  but the weapon must have enough ammo (single shot, burst) to fire
  these three times.  If this is not the case, then two targets can
  be attacked with rapid fire.  Also, rapid fire may be used against
  a single target.  Generally, rapid fire is not effective (and not
  allowed) at targets at greater than medium range.  Targets other
  than the first incur a -2 DM to the attack throw.  Characters
  using rapid fire also gain benefits associated with each attack
  throw--group hits and addition throws for autofire.  Think of rapid
  fire as a means for characters to perform multiple attacks in one
  round.

  Note that a character is limited to the number of targets he can
  attack in the same combat round based on his Dex.  See the
  changing targets rule below.

 9.  Attack Routine--Shotguns.  Shotguns are handled just like snapfire
 except that they also use the group hit rule.  Unlike most group hits, attacks
  with shotguns under this rule allows attackers three extra attacks. 
  Targets must be human sized or smaller, within range, and grouped
  closely together. 

  Shotguns receive a +2 DM when firing at flying targets.

 10.  Attack Routine--Thrown Weapons.  How far and how hard it is to
 hit a target with a thrown weapon is determined by a character\'s throw range.  
The skill used for throwing objects is Throwing.

  Throw Range.  Objects of 1 kg or less can be thrown horizontally a
  number of meters equal to Str x 5.  Throwing upward, this range is
  reduced to a number of meters equal to the character\'s Str rating.
   Heavier objects can be thrown for shorter ranges.  For objects
  weighing up to the character\'s Str in kg, halve the normal range. 
  For objects weighing up to double the Str rating, divide the normal
  range by 10.  Characters cannot throw objects heavier than their
  Str rating in kg.

  Thrown Weapon To Hit Table.  To find the to hit difficulty for
  thrown weapons, figure the distance to the target, make sure it
  does not exceed the character\'s throw range, and cross reference
  with the table below.

  Throw Range	Difficulty.
  0-3 m		Difficult
  4-15 m		Formidable
  16-45 m		Staggering
  46-150 m		Impossible

 11.  Attack Routine--Indirect Fire.  Indirect fire requires the use of
 a spotter or some kind of spotting device that is within sight of the target 
and can report firing corrections.  Acting as a spotter involves the use
  of the Forward Observer skill.  Indirect fire usually requires the
  use of the Heavy Weapons or Artillery skill.  

  To hit with indirect fire:  Difficult test of appropriate skill.

  Use the range number of the target as a penalty DM to this throw. 
  Because the 	 indirect fire procedure requires the use of two
  people--the weapon operator and the spotter--use the lower of the
  two skills (but the weapon operator\'s attribute) when making the
  to hit roll.  The best spotter in existence is helpless if the firer
  is inept, and the best of firers cannot hit a thing without
  accurate instructions from his spotter.

 12.  Attack Routine--Bow Combat.  Bow combat is conducted using the
 normal direct fire rules listed here, but generally, bows cannot hit targets
  beyond long range.

 13.  Group Hits.  Because of the spread of fully automatic fire (or
 other weapons that can attack more than one target), characters adjacent to 
targets of automatic fire are attacked as well.  After the attack is made on
  the primary target, roll to hit throws against targets within 1.5
  meters of the primary target.  (This area is called the weapon\'s
  danger space--some weapons have wider danger spaces.)  Use double
  the range DM on this attack, only roll one attack per additional
  target, and don\'t double the damage dice if a spectacular hit is
  achieved.  No more than two additional targets (this is with a 4-5
  round burst) can be attacked in this manner--choose the two
  closest the primary target (if a hit was achieved on the primary
  target, otherwise, roll randomly for all targets within range). 
  Weapons firing 10 rounds in a burst or greater are allowed attacks
  at four adjacent targets.

 14.  HE Rounds.  After normal hits are resolved, including group hits
 from automatic fire, blast effects may cause damage to individual targets 
adjacent to the primary target.  Roll a second time for group hits, but
  apply half damage.  These extra targets must be adjacent to the
  target character to be attacked.  Adjacent characters are those in
  the same 1.5 meter square as the target.

 15.  Flechettes.  All flechette rounds, fired at targets at long and
 very long range, use the shotgun rule for group hits.

 16.  High Energy Weapons.  All PGMPs and FGMPs, fired at targets at
 very long range, use the shotgun rule for group hits.  The danger space for most
  PGMPs and FGMPs is 4.5 meters.

 17.  Accessories.  There are a multitude of accessories that can aid
 ranged fire.  The most common are listed here.  

  Telescopic and electronic sights provide a +4 DM to hit at long and
  very long ranges.  Pistol shoulder stocks provide a -1 DM to hit at
  contact range but provide a +1 DM at very short, short, medium, and
  long range.  Rifle folding stocks use a -1 DM at very short,
  short, medium, long, and very long ranges.

 18.  Cover and Concealment.  An individual who is completely under
 cover cannot be attacked.  An individual who is in complete concealment 
cannot be attacked unless the firer has some reason to fire into that area
  (and the below DMs are used).  Use a -4 DM on attacks against target
  under partial cover.  Use a -1 DM against targets who are
  concealed.

  If a character, who is under partial cover, is hit by an attack,
  roll on the critical hit chart to determine location.  If the shot
  hit a location that cannot be hit because of cover, then the shot
  is a miss.

 19.  Darkness and Night.  Poor lighting conditions may restrict the
 ability of an individual to see and attack.  Attacks at targets greater than Short
  range suffer a -9 DM on the attack throw.  Vision is also
  restricted to Short range.  Partial darkness 	 (weak light sources
  like moonlight, distant illumination, etc.) allows visibility up to
   Medium range, and ranged attacks at greater than Medium suffer the
  -9 DM.  Electronic sights or nightfinder equipment may be used to
  eliminate these DMs and improve visual range.

  There is an improved version of these rules listed in the AHL notes.

 20.  Size.  Targets that are basketball sized or smaller are
 considered small--use a -3 DM against these targets.  Targets that are the size of a ground car or
  larger are considered large--allow a +3 DM to hit these targets.

 21.  Firing into hand to hand combat.  It\'s dangerous to fire into a
 situation where a friend is in contact range with your target.  Use a -3 DM on 
the to hit roll, and if the attack fails, choose a random person within
  contact range and roll an attack against him.  This new target may
  be friend or foe.

 22.  Drawing.  Drawing a weapon is an action, but the referee may let
 a character quick draw--meaning draw and fire in the same round. 

  To perform a quick draw:  Average test of appropriate weapon skill.

  If this is successful, apply a -3 DM to the drawing character\'s
  initiative throw.  Characters who also draw and fire at their next
  available opportunity use a -3 DM to hit.

  A special case occurs when two or more people draw against one
  another.  Use an opposed roll of the weapon skill to determine who
  goes first.

 23.  Reloading.  Reloading a weapon when its magazine is empty is an
 action and requires, normally, one combat round to complete.  Six seconds is
  still a short period of time to disengage an old magazine, locate
  and pull a new one, and replace the  spent mag in the
  weapon--especially if one is not well versed in the operation of his
  weapon.  To simulate this, the ref may require a check to replace
  the mag in one round.  If the check fails, it can be tried each
  round until the check is successful.

  To reload a weapon:  Average test of appropriate weapon skill.

  Revolvers do not take magazines, and therefore take more time.  The
  minimum time to reload a revolver is two actions.  If need be, half
  the weapon\'s ammo can be 	 reloaded in one action i.e. 3 bullets for
  a 6 round revolver could be reloaded in one combat round. 
  Revolvers assume 6 round cylinders.  If a weapon takes more  ammo,
  say 8 rounds, then use the individual ammo rule to see how long it
  takes.  Speed loaders allow revolvers to be reloaded in one action.

  Individual rounds, like loading a revolver or a shot gun, can be
  reloaded one bullet at a time.  Up to 3 bullets can be reloaded per
  action.

  Lasers do not use cartridges--they have power packs instead. 
  Replacing a spent power pack is treated like changing a magazine
  if another power pack is carried and readily available.  More
  likely, changing the power pack for a laser or other energy weapon
  will require 4 actions--one for each of these steps:  disconnect the
  power cable from the weapon, take off the power pack, put on the
  new power pack, and connect the cable to the weapon.

  Belt type magazines, as used in heavy machine guns, usually contain
  50 to 100 bullets, and these belts can be replaced in two
  reloading actions.  If the weapon has a two man crew, usually a
  gunner and a loader, then each operator can work together to get
  the weapon reloaded in one action.

  Cassette type magazines, those used in large self contained feed
  systems on vehicles and such, require 5 reloading actions to
  reload.  Thus, one person could reload them in 5 rounds, but 5
  people, given sufficient space with which to work, could reload
  the weapon in only 1 combat round.

  All of these loading times are minimum times and assume that a fresh
  magazine is at hand to reload the weapon.

 24.  Special Rule--Hand Grenades.  This rule modifies the hand grenade
 rule listed on pg. 59 of T4.  Roll a normal to hit throw as described in the 
thrown weapon rules, and a successful hit means that the grenade landed
  with the target in the primary burst radius.  A miss indicates
  that the scatter rules must be used--see below.  A spectacular
  success means that the grenade actually landed on the target when it
  exploded--apply double damage.  

  Concussion.
  Grenades have two values listed in their damage columns.  One
  designates the concussive force of the grenade indicated with a
  "C".  The number beside this indicates how many damage dice the
  grenade does due to concussion.  The second listing is a number
  with a "B".  This is the grenade\'s primary burst radius in meters. 
   Targets within this burst radius will be hit by fragments--how
  many depends (see below).

  Targets at greater range than the primary burst radius, up to twice
  the primary burst radius, are in the weapon\'s secondary burst
  radius.  Targets in this secondary burst radius will take less
  damage than those in the primary burst radius.  These ranges 	
  continue until no more damage can be applied to targets, but the
  damage rating of the grenade is reduced at each burst radius. 
  When the damage of the grenade drops below 1, the grenade cannot
  inflict any more damage.  Use the chart below to determine the
  damage a grenade does due to concussive force.  When applying 	
  concussion damage use the second column on the critical hit chart to
  determine location.

  Concussive Damage for grenades.

     Indoor or Enclosed Areas	Outdoor or Open Areas
  Burst Radius		Full damage		Full damage
  2 x Burst Radius	1/2 damage		1/4 damage
  3 x Burst Radius	1/4 damage		1/8 damage
  4 x Burst Radius	1/8 damage		1/16 damage

  Fragmentation.
  Characters in the burst radius will also be hit with fragments
  (given that the grenade is designed to throw fragments).  Roll on
  one of the charts below to see how many 	 fragments hit targets
  based on which burst radius they are in.  Each fragment in the 	
  primary burst radius will do 2 D6 damage.  Each fragment in the
  secondary (or  beyond) burst radius will do 1 D6 of damage.

  PRIMARY BURST RADIUS	SECONDARY BURST RADIUS

  D6	Shrapnel		D6	Shrapnel	
  1-2	No fragments		1-3	No fragments
  3-4	1 fragment		4-5	1 fragment
  5-6	1 D6 fragments	6	1 D6 fragments

  Deviation.
  If the to hit throw fails, the grenade will deviate.  Use one of the
  two charts below depending on which way the character was
  throwing.  Roll two dice.  The result will indicate which
  direction the grenade scatters before it explodes.  The center
  square indicates the target square.  ^ or \\ indicates the
  direction of the throw (pointing towards the 7).  Distance is
  calculated by rolling 2 D6 and halving the result.

  SCATTER DIAGRAM		DIAGONAL SCATTER DIAGRAM

  6	7	8	7	8	9

  5	^	9	4	\\	4,12
  2,10	3,11	4,12	5	2,11	3,10

  Other Notes for Grenades.
  	1.  The 3 D6 maximum damage rule does not apply to grenades.
 	2.  Handle fragmentation attacks just like slug throwers--armor 
	can block the frags. 
	3.  Concussion effects ignore armor. 
	4.  The concussive damage of a grenade can be ignored based on 
	the situation i.e. in a vacuum.
  	5.  There may be some protection from partial cover such as 
	crouching behind a vehicle or hunkering down in a foxhole.  
	The GM makes the final decision, but partial cover could afford 
	half damage from concussion.  For instance, this would be 
	the case if a character was lying prone in a foxhole.  Partial cover 
	may effect fragmentation damage as well.
  	6.  Characters in small, tight enclosures such as armored 
	vehicles, small concrete rooms, or narrow trenches suffer 
	automatic double concussion damage.

 25.  Pistol Recoil.  If a pistol is steadied by using both hands to
 brace the shot, pistol recoil is more easily controlled, and the weapon is 
more accurate.  One action must be used steadying the pistol, but the firing
  character receives a +1 DM to hit if he does so.  This can be
  combined with the aim or snipe actions simultaneously.

 26.  Two Weapons.  A character can use two weapons, like two pistols,
 if it is physically possible to do so, but generally only one weapon can be fired at a
  time with any accuracy.  Characters are considered to be using two
  weapons if they use more than one weapon in the same 6 second combat
  round.  Otherwise, characters are only carrying two weapons, and
  they can use one weapon for a full round then use the other weapon
  for a full round without penalty.  Check the below chart for to hit
  target number modifiers.  

  Character is		Left hand DM	Right hand DM.
  Right Handed	      -4		       -2
  Left Handed		       -2		       -4
  Ambidextrous	       -3		       -3

 27.  Changing Targets.  Through the use of the multiple action rule or
 some other method, characters may attack more than once in a combat round.  A
  maximum of 3 targets can be attacked during a round.  There are DMs
  applied to the to hit throw 	 based on the character\'s Dex.  Check
  the chart below for DMs and the number of targets a character can
  attack in a single round. 

  Dex	Max # of Targets     1st Tgt DM     2nd Tgt DM     3rd Tgt DM.
  0-4	1		 0            NA	                   NA
  5-9	2		 0              -1	                    NA
  10+	3		 0              -1	                    -2

IV.  HAND TO HAND COMBAT.
 1.  Procedure.  Generally, hand to hand and melee combat will be
 handled as indicated in these steps although some of the alternative attack 
routines may alter this procedure.

  	1.  Determine to hit number and difficulty level based on skill,
  	ability, and attack routine.
  	2.  Apply DMs for Fatigue, Weakened Blows, Defender\'s Skill, 
	and any other DMs. 
	3.  Roll on Hit Location Chart;  Check location for
  	armor. 
	4.  Decrease damage dice for any armor used by defender. 
	5.  Roll and apply damage;  Check Hit Location Chart for 
	additional damage. 
	6.  Calculate Fatigue.

 2.  Range.  In order to conduct hand to hand combat, an attacker must
 be within contact range with his opponent.

 3.  Short range melee weapons vs. long range melee weapons.  If a
 character with a dagger (a short range melee weapon) is fighting an opponent 
with a spear (a long range melee weapon), the character with the short
range weapon may not attack on the first round.  He may defend
though.  Note that this only happens on the first round of a
  combat.

 4.  Weapon Length.  Any weapon over 3000 mm is very clumsy and cannot
 be used against an individual at contact range after its first such use. 
  Any weapon of greater than 1500 mm requires care in use because of
  the size of doorways and hatches.

  In AHL Tactical Combat System, any individual carrying such a weapon
  must expend one additional AP when passing through a doorway,
  hatch, or iris valve.

 5.  Weakened Blows.  Characters can conserve energy in a hand to hand
 fight by using weakened blows.  Weakened blows do not count against a
  character\'s End pool, but a negative DM is applied on the attack
  throw.  Different weapons have different DM, depending on how hard
  they are to control.  These weakened blow DMs can be found, by
  weapon type, in the Weakened Blow Chart below.

  Weapon	Weak Blow	
 Hands	-2
 Club	-1
 Dagger	-2
 Short Blade	-2
 Foil	-2
 Cutlass	-4
 Sword	-3
 Broadsword	-4
 Bayonet	-2
 Spear	-3
 Halberd	-3
 Pike	-3
 Cudgel	-1


 6.  Special Rule--Special Strikes.  Situations where Str and End wound
 not be a factor, like attacks against an unconscious target, do not normally
  need a task roll and do not count against a character\'s End pool.

 7.  Improvised Weapons.  Weapons like a broken chair leg or broken
 bottle can be used to make an armed strike.  Any weapon like this should be 
given a negative DM to hit to reflect the fact that they are more
  clumsy.  A broken bottle, for instance, used as a knife, should
  use the Blade Combat (or similar skill) skill with a target 	 number
  DM of -1 or -2.

 8.  Armor.  The reduction of damage due to armor is described in the
 ranged combat section, but a note is made here about damage done to attackers 
who hit armor with their hands and other body parts.  Since slamming
  your fist against something hard does damage, apply 1 point of
  damage to an attacker for each hit he makes against rigid armor.

 9.  Pure Defense.  A character can concentrate on countering his
 opponents attacks rather than making any attacks of his own.  Attacking 
exposes one to a counter  attack, and this rule allows a defender to focus all of
  his energy on defending himself.  

  In such as case, the attacker and defender make opposed rolls
  against each other (see pg. 50 of T4) with the appropriate skills
  i.e. Brawling vs. Brawling, Blade Combat vs. Blade Combat, etc. 
  The defender must have a weapon to defend himself with if
  defending against an opponent with a weapon.  Neither character uses
  the other\'s skill rating as a negative DM in this case.  If the
  attacker wins, the attack is automatically successful.  If the
  defender wins, the attack is blocked and fails.

 10.  Attack Routine--Unarmed Strikes.  This is melee combat using your
 fist, foot, head, etc.  Damage is normally 1 D6.  Defenders can use their
  Brawling skill as a negative DM to the attack throw.

  To Hit at unarmed hand to hand combat:  Average test of Brawling.

 11.  Attack Routine--Armed Strikes.  This is melee combat with blades,
 clubs, swords, spears, chair legs or other makeshift weapons, etc.  
The appropriate skill for the weapon should be used i.e. Blade Combat, Fencing,
  Melee Combat, Dagger, etc.  The damage done is determined by the
  weapon.  Only defenders with weapons (to block with) can use their
  skill levels (with that weapon) as a negative DM to the attackers
  to hit throw.

  To attempt an armed strike:  Average test of appropriate skill.

 12.  Special Rule--Fencing.  Fencers use the same rules as listed
 above for armed strikes except they receive a special bonus.  If an armed 
strike against a fencer fails, the fencer is allowed a free, additional,
  and immediate attack in the same combat round even though it is
  not his turn to act.  This "return fencer\'s attack" is in addition 	
  to his normal action for the combat round.  Two fencers fencing each
  other could use this rule to make multiple attacks in the same
  combat round given that misses are made.  This rule can only be
  used following an unsuccessful armed attack.

 13.  Attack Routine--Grappling.  This is an attempt to pin and hold a
 target.  The  attacker may choose to cause injury with the grapple, in 
which case the pinned character takes 1 point of damage to his End each round
  until he falls unconscious or breaks free.  To break free from a
  grapple, the defender must roll an opposed Brawling test (see pg.
  50 of T4 for opposed tasks) against the attacker.  If the victim 	
  fails, he remains pinned in the grapple.  If he ties or wins, he can
  either break the grapple or grapple the attacker in return. 
  Brawling or Athletics skill can be used as a negative DM on any
  grappling attacks.

  To grapple someone:  Difficult test of Brawling.

 14.  Attack Routine--Tackling.  This is an attempt to tackle somebody
 to the ground.  The target\'s Brawling or Athletics skill can be used as a 
negative DM to the attack throw.  If successful, the target takes 1 D6 of
  damage, and the attacker takes 1 point of damage.  Armor does not
  stop any of this damage, and both characters end the round prone. 
  If the tackle is not successful, the defender remains unaffected,
  but the attacker still takes 1 point of damage and ends the round
  prone adjacent to his target.

  To tackle someone:  Difficult test of Brawling.

 15.  Military Rifle Skill.  Individuals with military backgrounds are
 trained to use rifles not only as ranged weapons but as melee weapons as well.  
This rule allows such individuals to use specific rifle skills (determined
  by the GM) as skill in melee combat (either with a bayonet or as a
  striking weapon).  For these weapons, use a  skill of one level
  lower when deciding melee attacks.

treatment, and misc.--KB)

        So does this mean I can call him a chronically unpunctual
goatee-wearing cocktail-swilling lounge-listening running dog of the yellow
gutter press that looks somewhat like Hugh Grant\'s evil twin?  Kewl!

        BTW, all of the above are largely true (\'cept for the chronically
unpunctual bit:  he has been more or less on time for the past few
games)...  and meant in the best of all possible ways  :-).

Imperial Date  TL  Comments
- -2210          12  Terrans discover Jump 3

- -1776          10  Syleans maintain minimal interstellar trade

- -650           11  Sylean Federation Established  

- -150           12  Robot manufacturing reestablished

 300           13  Vargr Campaigns taking place (210-348)

So, Sylea has had TL 12 for a while, it makes sense that most of their
ships are TL 12.  As for everyone else... Well, the Solomani likely have
TL 12 civilizations still going strong in some areas.  It makes sense that
the K\'Kree have at least TL 13, since they have a *very* conservative
civilization.  The Aslan are likely TL 10 or 11 max since they are so new
at all this, and I\'m assuming the Vargr are probably in the TL 11-12 range
simply because I\'ve always assumed that they got about as much of their
tech from borrowing as from independent invention. 

If I had to make a guess I\'d make Zhdant TL 13 and the rest of the 
Consulate TL 11 or 12.  Remember, the Zhodani are also very stable, the
Consulate has not grown since -1000.  From the data we have I\'d say that 
part of the reson the Zhodani advance technologically beyond this point 
is to be able to counter Imperial aggression.

The key to making all of this make sense is to simply assume that instead
of the Imperium being the technological leader during all eras, it was
simply the technological leader in its local area, until it got large
enough that it could handle smaller, slightly more advanced pocket
empires, and that is was at rough technological parity with most of the
other minor races when it finally contacted them.  

I\'d rule that in the Core, Vland, Dagudashaag, Lishun, and Fornast sectors
there is no one else who has TL 12 or above.  Beyond this region I\'d say
all bets are off.  Massila has the Geonee, who are likely TL 13, but they
seem rather non-expansionistic, so I would imagine they are not much of a
threat.

The Beyond was a sector booklet published by Paranoia Press way, way back, which
has been dismissed from Canon but recividists like m\'self still use. It was a
bare description of a roaring roistering frontier sector. It needed a lot of
fleshing out (anyone wanna see my I\'Sred*Ni alien module draft?) but had real
character. They also did the Vanguard Reaches, for which all this also applies.

There is a web page run by one of the two bods who did this (Don Rapp I think);
I\'ve lost the URL but if you search on Paranoia it should pop up. Max kudos,
he\'s still updating the sector!

If you can find a copy of Beyond good luck! Sword of the Knight or BITS might
have one.

As to detail on the system in question - nope, you\'d have to write it up
yourself. Shock horror! We can\'t do that anymore! Knickers. That\'s half the fun.

Auld bastard signs off!

the Shawshank Redemption are good resources for prisons in the presnt day 
or TED\'s dungeons. But what kind of technology would you use to lock 
people up in the Imperium. I suppose trackers would be one step and the 
fun remote control bomb is always another. Would there be any chance of 
escape once you get past a certain levl of tech. Would you even imprison 
people when they could be doing work. You could set paramenters of people 
movements if you have a city/planetwide tracking network.
Getting out of something like this or a cortex bomb would take some 
doing. I mean finding a surgeon who also knows something about bomb 
disposal would be an arse.
Robot Guards would also be quite difficult to bribe but they wouldn\'t be 
able to act as intelligently as a human and so could be outsmarted.
And theres always the possiblity of outside help, prisons are designed to 
keep people in not out. Theres an adventure for you PC\'s hired to break 
someone out of prison, just happens the prison is on an asteroid far out 
in the system with more missles and scanners than you can shake a pointed 
stick at.
Anyone else have any ideas.

Let me take a stab at this . . . 

Since Eris said awhile back that QSDS is based on FF&S\' infamous Ship Design Sequence, 
I\'m assuming that most of the subsystems are likewise based on FF&S. If I\'m wrong, I 
invite the Holy Trav Answer Team to descend upon my head :)

As I understand it, the "controls" section of QSDS is actually "computers." Military 
"controls" represent fiber-optic computers. This makes sense, since hits from nukes and 
PAWs do additional comp damage to non-fib ships. I took a look at FF&S, and the numbers 
look that way. BTW, these look like triply-redundant machines, too.

This seems to be the case because in the Hull step of QSDS, it says that standard hull 
costs include "controls." I assume this means the "controls" listed under electronics in 
FF&S, which makes some sort of twisted sense.

As for comp ratings: Max comp ratings are based on tech level -- the max comp possible 
at any given TL is (Current TL - 7), leaving a max of 5 at the putative M0 tech level of 
12. For campaign reasons, Imperial Intelligence has a level one higher, 
probably reflecting massively-parallel and/or crude Tech 13 comps. I\'d assume that 
shipboard comps are rated at 2 or 3 to 4, with almost all ships at the former and a few 
"very specialized" ships at the latter. In other words, a perscomm won\'t be able to plot 
a jump, the the popular Sylean vidshow "MacGyver" not withstanding <evil grin>. Heck, 
MacGyver can reprogram the global comm net with a broken videogame and a roll of duct 
tape . . . :)

Well, one idea that\'s quite workable is the one James White used in
"Escape Orbit". One side in a war handles the POW problem by picking an
undeveloped but habitable planet and dumping the POWs there. There are
some survielance satellites, but the main thing keeping people there is
the fact that get dumped with just the clothes on their backs.

There are several ways of getting prisoners landed in such a situation.
In decreasing degree of security:

1. dump them from low orbit in a "personal escape system"
2. dump them by parachute from medium altitude
3. Lower them from a hovering ship
4. land a heavily armed shuttle and kick them out the door.

If the surveilance satellites detect something suspicious (large
concentration of metal, etc) they "drop a rock" on it. 

Prospects of escaping are slim without outside help. And the outside
help had better be able to take out the satellite network!

Another method would be to infect prisoners with something like Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome. Not terribly infectious, but it\'ll render you
incapable of escaping, or even giving much trouble. At release, you
cure them.

Well, this is a pretty good analysis of the situation. I think your 
assumption about the lack of Imperial technical supremacy in 0 is right on. 
Although I don\'t know about any Solomani cultures at 12 - they are in the 
same boat as the rest of the former Imperium, so why should they have any 
higher a Tech level?

I have to ask why it makes sense that the K\'kree are TL 13 because they are 
very conservative? What difference does that make?

You also didn\'t mention the Hivers. I think we would have to put them at 13 
- - the same as the K\'kree

Oh, a fun K\'kree tidbit. In a previous CT campaign I had decided that the 
K\'kree actually had completely discovered all of the technology necessary 
for TL-16, but they wanted to wait another hundred years or so before 
implementing any of it, just to make sure it was safe.

We already have this.  A fellow I work with wears an ankle cuff that houses
a small radio transmitter.  If he travels beyond a certain range of his home
(fairly large area due to the nature of our jobs), a warning signal is sent
to the police that he has violated his parole.  If the anklet is tampered
with, same thing.  You could easily modify this to deliver shocks or tranq
when the parole parameters are violated.  Also, picture a "restraint order"
version; where if you approach a person or place you\'ve been ordered to stay
away from.. ZZOT! and the cops come calling.

Not if the local government uses them on a regular basis.  Of course, this
"doctor" might be of the same caliber as the people who provided back alley
abortions in the US prior to Roe v. Wade.

Exactly.  Make the machine work for you.  TL12 prisons are liable to use
many different sensors to track the inmates: visable light, sub-sonic sound
(track them by heart beat), IR, implanted transponders, even smell.  This
might make the humans in charge a little complacent.

In most prison breaks, the outside help is limited to having a quick change
of clothes and a fast air/raft waiting.  Prisons are designed like medieval
castles, they channel anybody trying to get in or out into kill zones.  Ever
see The Blues Brothers?  Joliet has several internal gates (guarded), a
double outer gate, and guards in mutally supporting posistions.  Add a
TL11-12 expert system that never sleeps, and you have a difficult job ahead
of you.

But nothing is impossible.  The Federal Pen on Alcatraz Island in San
Francisco Bay was considered escape proof.  It\'s defences:  1> A strict no
talking policy for the inmates, to prevent planning.  2> A minimal number of
egress points from the cell blocks.  3> A well-publicized shoot-to-kill
order.  4> 1.5 mile of very cold (48 degrees F average), shark infested
water.  At that temp, hypothermia is guarnteed unless you are in excellent
shape, and *any* blood will attract a few sand sharks, or maybe one of the
great whites we get.

One guy made it.  In 1957, six inmates escaped from the machine shop onto
the roof (bypassing #2).  They planned their escape for shift change, when
the guards were preoccupied (#3).  Upon reaching the water, down to four due
to alert guards, they covered their bodies with grease and put on two layers
of clothes (#4).  Alcatraz officials announced that all had drowned, but
years later it came out that the next day police had found one of the
inmates sound asleep on the north shore of the Golden Gate.  If he had
stayed awake, he would have made it, and the very fact that he made it made
the FBI quietly look into all the others who had "drowned" while escaping.

Why does a campaign have to involve a threat to the Imperium?  A threat to a single

Check the Traveller News Service articles in JTAS.  Fifth Frontier War 
collects TNS articles from JTAS 1-9, I think.  Then a later issue of JTAS 
collects another chunk of articles.

See also The Spinward Marches Campaign, which is set after the 5FW (page 
11).

    You are forgetting Strephon.
    Point in fact the reason Strephon gave up was that he couldn\'t win and that
fighting would prolong the bloodshed and kill more innocents.  IF Norris comes
roaring out of the Marches though... <GRIN> First off Norris has a forward base
in Strephon\'s territory and just the influx of the fresh forces Norris would
bring to bear would dramatically shift the balance of power.  Secondly with
such a powerful new player/force behind Strephon it\'s quite possible that the
Vilani qould happily cut a deal for peace and reinforcements of their own
against the Vargr.  Now you\'ve got THREE of the major Factions of the Rebelion
united, however loosely, and the other Factions would doubtless start to get
nervious.  Margaret would probably cut a deal, she was trying to preserve
civilization after all and Strephon returned with Norris\'s military might and
tact Vilani acceptence would be a formidable step in that direction.
    That leaves Lucan and Dulinor. <sigh> Okay you could presume that youd\'s
start seeing defections from Lucan\'s forces as soon as Strephon got that
powerful.  The knowledge that Lucan is stark raving mad is relatively common
knowledge rather early on into the Rebellion, certainly by the time Norris
would have been able to "jump" into the fray.  In fact you might even manage a
"Palace Coup" of sorts and remove Lucan altogether.  With Dulinor OC there can
be No Quarter, Strephon MUST destroy the man, he has no other choice.
    Now think of the next step, blooded and now unified Imperial Fleets would
be more then able to retake large chunks of territory the Solomani captured,
though not all of it.  That\'s the task for the next generation, the Aslan would
back down to some extent as well.  The Imperium would be back, unified and
looking very triumphant.  More to the point the Aslan would be satisfied that
their honor is avenged from Dulinor\'s murder of their Ambassador durring the
Assassination.  That was their pretext after all.
    So now you have a BADLY SHAKEN Imperium reunited.  What would the aftermath
of that be?  Well if Norris swept away the Nobility in the Regency... he\'s
going to be Strephon\'s MOST INFLUENTIAL COUNSELOR in the reunited Imperium and
he can push for similar reforms.  Also another thing to think of, the
population of the Imperium is going to have had a Really Good Taste of the Hard
Times and looking into the brink of a Long Night.  They extremist factions will
be muted by that and a more cooperative spirit will emerge.  Will that be
enough though?

I\'m thinking Terra and its environs might since that\'s where TL 12 was 
achieved during the Rule of Man.  They\'d have more records.

They\'re conservative enough that I\'m not sure 1115 years is enough time
for them to go from TL 12-TL 15.  It makes more sense to me that their
rate of progress is almost half the Imperium\'s (say every 550 years,
instead of every 350-400). 

>You also didn\'t mention the Hivers. I think we would have to put them at 
>13 - - the same as the K\'kree

Perhaps, the thing is the Hivers are very research and progress oriented,
and so having a rate of technological change lower than the Imperium\'s
might not make sense, I\'m not sure. 

It\'s interesting to speculate one the rate of Hiver and K\'kree progress.  
Let\'s see what we can deduce...

The Hivers and K\'kree first met in -2045 and the K\'kree technology was
notably higher (from Alien Module 7: Hivers) The Hivers only won the war
because they were able to manipulate several K\'kree worlds.  The Hivers
had discovered Jump 1 (TL9) in -4212.  Perhaps at -2245 the Hivers were at
TL 11, and the K\'kree were at TL 12.  Now, by Year 0 the K\'kree have
slowly moved up to TL 13 and the Hivers are also at TL 13.  Since they are
basically at TL 16 by 1115 this works as a reasonable rate of progress
(one TL every 300-400 years for the Hivers)

I don\'t necessarily need to see entire *modules* worth of detail - but a

interesting.

And if prisons are not meant to punish people but rather to keep them from
comitting crimes and/or making them get out of touch with the criminal
world why not freeze them? I think there are some short stories about law
and crime by Djingis Pournelle or whatever he\'s called ;) in a collection

I played Twilights peak a few years ago with my group and had one Ancient
Droyne escaping for parts unknown. Currently my players are helping this
Ancient to "recontact" his race. The real story is of course that he\'ll try
to kill Grandfather with the players helping unknowingly. One thing about
this child of Grandfather is that he has no reproductive organs, his cells
are harder than normal to clone and his mind is totally incapable of
thinking about genetics et c thanks to grandfathers meddling.

Yep, just finished Dark Star #2 - 24 pages this time - today. It\'ll be
completely run off tomorrow - far sooner than anyone is likely to get any
money to me :-)

What does *this* issue contain? Well -

* Logical Technology Ratings - an alternative way of looking at Technology
in Traveller (which, unfortunately, doesn\'t fit into the UPP system, but,
hey, it works!)

* Vilani Military Ranks - a companion piece to the *Vilani Noble Ranks*
article in DS#1. After all, a 6000 year old empire just doesn\'t "go away"
and become completely forgotten.

* Ila\'u Class Scout-Courier - a *modular* starship design that, with a
little changing around, can be <almost> all things to all people. Designed
to Tech 12, with background for use in Sylean service.

* Endeavour Class Survey Boat - a small craft (10 tons) designed for
deployment with some variants of the Ila\'u Class (and other vessels as
well, of course). Designed to Tech 12, with background for use in Sylean
service.

* Emergency Survival Systems - an alternative to expensive (in money and
volume requirements) Lifeboats.

* Medicine & Healing: An Alternative System - So now you can actually see
the difference between Tech 15 medical practise and Tech 0 medical practise
... instead of characters treated in each healing at the same rate! Some
other ideas as well - including how *many* units of medical supplies it
takes to heal a patient!

* Trader\'s Corner - Medical Equipment *and* the BookPad and \'Lectrograph
Paper.

* Rank & Retirement Benefits: Hmm, after 20 years, an enlisted person (E5
by the rules) and an officer (say an 06 Colonel) *both* retire on a pension
of 4000 Cr per annum? Do you seriously believe this? If you *don\'t*, then
this article offers an alternative system - and also offers some of the
*non-cash* benefits that accrue to military retirees.

Now for the bad news. Cost.

Issue #1 (of which I think there are three still available) went for just
the cost of postage and stationery. Unfortunately, unless I win the
Lottery, I can\'t afford to do this forever :-(

So, Issue #2 will cost US$7 (Cash, Postal Money Order, or International
Bank Draft in the equivalent A$ amount - no personal cheques, sorry) for US
readers. For UK readers, it will cost stg5 pounds (Cash, PMO, or
International Bank Draft in the equivalent A$ amount - no personal cheques,
sorry). For those of you in other countries, drop me a line and I\'ll work
out what it will cost *you*.

As soon as my backorder (it\'s been three weeks now :-} for Adobe Acrobat V3
is filled, there will be a .pdf version available - but this will still
cost (Acrobat isn\'t free, so I have to defray costs somehow), which will
just be the paper version stuffed into an Acrobat File (future issues will
make better use of the .pdf format, as I learn all about the program). I
haven\'t decided what, exactly, but probably US$4 or stg3. I\'ll make an
announcement when this version is available. Note that I do *NOT* have FTP
access, so you\'d either a) have to get it as an email attachment, and .pdf
files can be pretty large or b) get it mailed on disk (which would
obviously cost a little extra). There *may* be an html version - but, since
I\'ll be using Word 95\'s html converter, be aware that there will be no
graphics *and* that there are evidently some problems with the Word html
converter doing things the *microsoft way* rather than the standard way,
and that this (so I\'ve heard) *may* cause problems for those of you not
running under Win95. Again, this will cost, but should be small enough so
that email will not be a problem.

As soon as I get said backordered Adobe Acrobat I will convert DS#1 to .pdf
format and, when I get the time, I will also convert it to html format
(with the above noted proviso) and make it available on the net.

Or give them a geneered disease that is non-infectious but very fatal. It is, OTOH, 
completely treatable with your medicine. For example, a  prisoner is inflicted with an 18

Just a little question - does everyone here really hate Dulinor? I was 
always kind-of pulling for him in the Rebellion. Succession by 
Assassination is perfectly valid in the Imperium after all.

And as for the entire Norris+Strephon recapture the Imperium - well, I 
GUESS this could happen, but there were so many ifs in your hypothesis. 
Personally, I don\'t think Norris had all THAT many forces to begin with, I 
don\'t think the Vilani would be in any mood to talk, I don\'t think Margaret 
would come to any easy accomodation, Lucan may have been mad, but he was 
pretty good at killing all who opposed him, so a palace coup would be 
unlikely.

        Actually, White Wolf\'s "adult" division, Black Dog, put out a game
called HoL (stands for human-occupied landfill) based on such a setup.  The
PC\'s are all vile, unrehabilitatable criminals who get dropped onto this
planet that\'s used as a) a prison and b) a garbage dump, and spend their
time doing evil things, rooting through the great piles of garbage, and
ducking the junk falling out of the sky...

        It\'s apparently done more as a joke than as a game; the text is all
handwritten designers notes, and weapons include the Kitty Kitty Bang Bang,
which apparently is a nuke grenade disguised as a Hello Kitty doll.  I\'ve
raised the specter of trying it out with my group, but they all look at me
like I\'m nuts.

Actually, the Kitty Kitty Bang BAng is NOT a doll. It IS a small kitten with 4 sticks of 
dynamite strapped to it (the book says, IIRC, that it is not that the weapon is effective, it is 
the fact that there are a lot of sick SOB\'s around who have nothing better to do than strap 
dynamite on to cute kittens to blow them up)

Not if you have the team made up of Humans and Vargr.  With high-tech
disguise and plastic surgery it should be possible to disguise members of
almost any branch of humaniti as members of almost any other branch of
humaniti.  Fur dye and similar surgery and disguise should work on Vargr.=
=20

Any aliens on the team would be in-the-background surveillance-n-tech
types.  Heck, as long as the inhabitants of the planet are humanoid
high-tech disguise should allow some pretty fancy stuff.  TL 8 allows us
to do believable disguises for things as alien as B-5 Narn.  TL 13+ shoul=

allow lots more.  This won\'t pass medical exams or *really* close

Where did you get that idea?  Prisons *are* meant to punish

Why not kill them?  That would "keep them from committing crimes", etc,
much more cheaply and effectively.  <joking>

Liberal societies *desire* that Prisoners be "rehabilitated" during their
incarceration.  They don\'t just want them frozen away for a time and
released back into society with the same problems that lead them to crime
in the first place.  They want the Prisoners to *change* in prison, to
become a well adjusted and productive individuals...

...and secretly they want to *punish* the SOB\'s!=20

I\'m not saying Prisons do a good job at rehabilitating inmates. Actually,=
 I
think most of them do more harm than good.  I\'m afraid that a minor
villain, once run through most prison systems, will come out a *major*
villain.

For some good source material for this kind of campaign one only has to
look to the book "TaiPan" by James Clavell.   Good yarn and lots of
material for a Traveller campaign...

"re-education" directly into his brain. Then after training him out of hi=

anti-social tendencies, educate him into a socially responsible method of
making a living (other wise known as the Demolition Man method).

In Mona Lisa Overdrive, one of the characters had been busted for
pickpocketing. He was conditioned so that anytime he saw a trigger (a pie=

of any of D.C.\'s scenery) he had a violent reaction and a condition IIRC
was referred to as brain lock. D.C. essentially exported their problem.

Other than that, straight confinement, an eye for an eye type punishment,
lopping off limbs for crimes (e.g. a hand for pickpocketing or a head for
the second offense), or sell them into slavery.

Lots of thoughts. Humph, I gues I should have said "Here\'s 6 for you".

   Worse case scenario:

   The Aslan occupy most of the Marches, and what they don\'t occupy the V=
argr
pillage into the Dark Ages. Norris is forced to ask for Zhodani protectio=
n,
which he gets, but it costs him the entire Dominion of Deneb, which is
swallowed bit by bit by Zhodani "liberation" forces.  All this goes on wh=
ile
the bulk of Norris\' forces are pissed away fighting through the Vargr try=
ing
to round the horn around Vland in a vain effort to link up with what\'s le=
ft
of Strephon\'s forces.  Those that finally do make it are only just enough=
 to
enable Strephon to launch a modest offense, which in the end gains some
ground at Lucan\'s expense, but accomplishes nothing else of significance.

  The whole balance of forces in the Rebellion era is such that no one
faction can overpower the others, and alliances are formed only at the mo=
st
local of levels.  The exception to this is in the Rim, where there is com=
mon
cause against Solomani, but even there the amount of cooperation between
Daibei, Lucan (the Imperial enclave), and Margaret is limited and no part=
ner
has any qualms about boosting their own strategic position at the expense=
 of
the overall war effort against the Solomani.  The fact that the Solomani =
are
unable to conquer all the territory they lost in the First Rim War and th=
en
drive deep into the Imperium speaks more to their disunity and incompeten=
ce
than to the brave stand taken by those in the Imperial enclave in the
Solomani Rim and elsewhere.

   Norris\' forces are just too tied down in the defense of the Dominion o=
f
Deneb to worry about happenings on the other side of the Great Rift.  Whi=
le
Norris hoped that the Imperium survived (which is why he sent the Arrival
Vengence on its mission), he just couldn\'t spare the ships and manpower
required to do as you suggest.

Harold

I would think that he\'d be very cautious at first, not wanting another
fight with grandpa before he\'s ready.  A few possibilities come to mind:

a) Decides to get the hell out of the whole area - not good for anyone
in the way or possible witnesses.  Maybe cons some group into setting up
a long distance transport system (using their technology to prevent
grandfather noticing).

b) Builds up capability for a fight.  First step is to prevent tales
being carried by destroying all capability of carrying anything, i.e.
destroy all technology anywhere near own position, needs to make it seem
like some other cause.

c) Having sufficient resources, starts hitting any grandfather bases by
surprise.  This probably means a nova in every system that grandfather=20
has a base of any kind (wasn\'t there one in the Regina system?)

VI.  WOUNDS.
 1.  Damage Procedure.  Each weapon\'s stat sheet lists the weapon\'s
 damage rating.  When a hit is achieved, this is the number of dice rolle=
d to inflict
  damage to the target.

  	1.  Roll on Hit Location chart to find hit location.
  	2.  Check to see if that location is armored.
  	3.  Roll damage and apply to stats.

 2.  Hit Location Chart.  This is the primary hit location chart.  Roll
 1 D6 for both digits.  The chart is from head to toe, and the probabilit=
ies for each
  location are:  (for column one) 14% Head;  14% Arm;  51% Torso;=20
  20% Leg.  (for column two) 14% Head;  22% Arm;  40% Torso;  22%
  Leg. =20

  Roll on the first column for most ranged attacks--this table is
  weighted towards the  torso.  Roll on the second table for a more
  random distribution of damage (such as from explosions).  Use the
  column that corresponds to the current wound category the
  character has.  A hit location of incidental means that a piece of
  the character\'s  equipment was hit, and the character probably did
  not take damage.  Roll again on this chart to find location and
  pick equipment in that area or roll on the hit location  chart
  above.  If there is no listing below under the wound categories,
  then there is no secondary effect to the damage.

  Secondary Effects:
  #p/r	Character receives additional points of damage per subsequent
  	round until medical attention received.

  Drop Items	This might not be automatic.

  Stun	Stunned characters cannot attack or move for 1 round, longer
 	 in the case of more serious wounds.  Might require rest to recover.

  Fall	Might not be automatic.  Might incur extra damage, usually 1 =09
    	point, depending on situation.

  Frac	Fracture. =20

  Impd	Impaired function of limb, organs, etc.

  Conc	Brain concussion.  Either mild, causing headaches, or serious,
  	causing migraines, dizziness, seizures, etc.  Severity increases =09
    	if character loses consciousness.

  Lung	Lung puncture, causes additional damage. =20

  Throat	Throat wound impairs breathing, causes additional damage.

  Intl	Internal organ hit, causes additional damage.

  Brain	Partial or total paralysis, coma, speech impairment,
  	blindness, personality change, seizures, etc.  This will depend on swi=
ftness
    	 of medical attention and amount of damage taken.

  Spine	Almost always causes paralysis.

  Heart	Heart injury causes additional damage.

  Artery	Major artery hit causing additional damage.

  Amp	Potential amputation.  If large amount of damage received in a
  	single hit, character may receive additional 1-3 pts. of damage =09
    	per round until medical attention received.  Energy weapon hits =09
    	do not incur extra damage as the wound automatically 	=09
    	cauterizes.

 3.  Special Rule--Aimed Snapshots.  Characters may use their skill
 levels as a DM on this critical hit chart to skew it towards the head or=
 feet (use a
  negative DM to skew toward the head, a positive DM to skew towards
  the feet).  If all or some of a character\'s skill level is used
  this way, those skill levels cannot be used to determine the to hit
  number.

 4.  Optional/Additional Hit Location Charts.  These hit location
 tables will be rarely used, but they are presented in the case that it i=
s necessary to
  determine a hit location and the Critical Hit Chart is not
  appropriate.  One of these charts could be used, for instance, if
  a left to right hit location is more appropriate or an animal is
  hit.  Note that the critical hit chart should be consulted first,
  and that chart indicates a hit location.  For serious damage, roll
  twice on these charts.  For destroyed damage, roll three times. =20

 5.  Hit Points.  A character\'s hit points is the total of his physical
 stats--Str, Dex, and End.  Damage rolled against a character reduces the=
se stats and
  therefore negatively effects how a character functions.=20

  A player may decide which of these three stats to reduce due to
  incurred damage.  Let\'s say 2 D6 of damage is rolled against a
  character, and a 2 and a 4 is rolled.  The defending player has to
  reduce the total of his physical stats by 6 points, but the  player
  decides which stats to reduce.  The only restriction here is that
  each die of damage cannot be broken up i.e. a character could not
  split the damage by reducing each of his stats by 2 (for a total of
  6 points).  The player must take 4 points from a stat and 2 points
  from a stat--although he may take all 6 points from the same stat.

  This damage will, among other things, reduce the target numbers for
  all skills governed by that attribute.  Ever hit your thumb with a
  hammer?  Hurts, doesn\'t it, 	 and it\'s hard to use your hand for a
  while afterwards.

 6.  Critical Hit.  Some wounds may be enough to daze or even kill a
 character.  To simulate this, all of the damage from a spectacular hit i=
s
  distributed randomly against a target\'s hit points.  Apply the
  entire amount of damage sustained in the first hit to a random
  stat.  If a stat is reduced to 0 in this manner, but all of the =09
  damage has not been applied, then continue to roll randomly on the
  remaining stats.  In this manner, first blood can stun,
  incapacitate, or even kill.

 7.  Special Rule--Int and Edu Hit Points.  A character\'s Int and Edu
 can be reduced, just like the character\'s physical stats, if a hit effec=
ts the head.
   In this instance, the character is allowed more hit points than
  normal, and he can use these two stats to absorb damage points
  that would normally incapacitate him.  Allowing more hit points
  for the head is unrealistic, but this is one of those rules that is
  in the best interest of players by keeping their characters alive
  longer.  What this rule will do is skew head shots towards
  superficial grazes.  This evens out, as is indicated in the =09
  Healing section, because a character with a destroyed brain is not a
  candidate for healing.

  A character\'s Soc stat can never be used for hit points although a
  Psi rating, if the character has one, can be used just like Int or
  Edu (for head wounds only).

  Note that certain wounds, besides those that actually hit the head,
  could also effect the head.  For example, a major artery hit in
  the leg could conceivably restrict blood flow to the brain.  In
  this instance, if the GM sees it as logical, these extra hit points
   could be used.

 8.  Armor.  Armor may reduce the amount of damage a target suffers.=20
 The AV (armor value) of the armor indicates how much damage it absorbs b=
efore
  armor penetration has occurred.  For each AV point, subtract 1 D6
  from the weapon\'s damage rating.  If the weapon\'s damage rating is
  greater than the AV of the armor, penetration has occurred, and
  the remaining points are applied against the target as damage.  Note
   that penetrated armor should be repaired if it is to be used
  again.

  Targets still suffer blunt trauma damage if the armor used is
  classed as flexible.  Targets take 1 point of damage for every D6
  absorbed by the armor.  Blunt trauma is not applied to characters in
  rigid armor types.

  Helmets.  The Critical Hit Chart is specific as to where the
  character is damaged, but in cases where it is unclear (and the
  attacked character has a helmet on) use this rule.  If the head is
  partially covered, as in the case of an open faced helmet, roll 1 =09
  D6.  On a 1 or 2, the shot hit the unprotected area of the face or
  neck.

 9.  Maximum Damage.  Regardless of a weapon\'s damage rating, a
 character cannot have more than 3 D6 of damage applied to it.  This rule=
 should be
  considered a 	 general rule--note that some things, such as shotguns
  and autofire, break this rule.=09

 10.  Wound Categories.   Any damage taken by a character results in a
 superficial wound.  If a characteristic is reduced to 0, then the charac=
ter has
  sustained a minor wound.  If two characteristics are reduced to 0,
  the character has sustained serious wounds.  If all three
  characteristics are reduced to 0, the character is dead.

 11.  Unconsciousness.  Character\'s with minor wounds will fall
 unconscious from shock for 10 minutes.  When character\'s recover, the st=
at that fell to 0
  will be improved to 1, and the other stats will be improved to
  half way between their current level and their original, maximum
  level (drop fractions).

  Seriously wounded characters will also fall unconscious (and this
  may be a second time if they fell unconscious when they were
  minorly wounded, then recovered, then took more damage) from
  severe shock and coma from blood loss and injury.  These =09
  characters will recover after 3 hours, and all stats remain at the
  wounded level (except all 0 stats, which are improved to 1).

  Alternatively, a character with a minor wound may roll 1 D6 every 3
  minutes, and if a 6 is rolled, the character becomes conscious.  If
  a character has a serious wound, then roll every hour.

 12.  Stun Damage.  Some weapons are listed as doing stun damage rather
 than actual wounds.  Also, a character may indicate he is attacking to s=
tun,
  rather than kill, in a hand to hand attack.  There is a -3 DM used
  for this attack form.

  Stun damage is handled just like normal wounds, but characters
  recover from them much more quickly.  Return 1 D6 points to one
  stat per hour of rest, but roll the stat randomly.  Stats cannot
  be improved above their maximum level.

 13.  Disease.  Rules for disease are listed on pg. 33 of JTAS #13.=20
 Additional rules are also listed on pg. 44 of TD #20.

 14.  Poison, Acid, etc.  Rules for poison and acid are listed on pg.
 59 of T4.  Additional notes on poison can be found on pg. 49 of TC #9.

How about a liscentatious holiday -- hardcore partying like a Mardi Gras,
but purely secular in nature -- on a Law Level 2 world? Sounds like just
the kind of thing that would be popular on the Core Subsector world of
Ordun in my game.

If that assassination is sanctioned by the Moot -- _THAT_ was the precedent

And if it looked likely to happen, do you think thre Zhodani would be in
favor? Empress Wave or no, I say "no." Five hundred years of Zho foreign
policy toward the Imperium has been aimed at containing Imperial
expansionism, so the last thing the Joes want is a unified Imperium.

There\'s also the Hivers to consider, too . . . they just might encourage
Margaret to act as a trailing counterweight to Norris\' spinward

Again I refer to the truly outstanding CT module "Tarsus."  Perfect setting
for a campaign, lots of subplots, lots of angles and plenty of raw source
material begging to be exploited by the eager referee.  And although there
aren\'t enough people on Tarsus for billions to be put at risk, it has been my
experience that putting the players much-beloved characters at risk is all
the motivation that they needed to drive the campaign forward;)

Not quite correct. I re-read that recently...

The punishment for "involuntary bobbling" (putting someone in a long
term bobble against their will) was to bobble the offender in a bobble
calculated to last a while longer than that of their victim, and place
it, well marked, near the bobble containing the victim. 

In other words, they let the victim deal with it...

See if you can find a copy of the December 1996 issue of Analog and
read the cover story "A Replant Day Carol".

"Replant Day" (rep-lant, not re-plant) is a holiday on the colony world
and it commemorates the discovery of how to survive on the world. It\'s
not a "nice" story. But it\'d fit well on many a low pop colony world.
*Especially* a rediscovered one in Millieu 0.

The story makes you guess at most of the details, but if anyone can
figure them out, let me know, I think I have it figured...

  {
    'body' => 'Hi there

I think I may have contributed to the post-Rebellion era debate in a
previous incarnation, but here is my 2pen\'th on how to go into the
post-Rebellion era.  The basic premise is: Kill Lucan & Dulinor.  This
pivotal event is called The Death of Fools.  My idea is to reduce the
changes from the published news, etc. to a minimum.

THE DEATH OF FOOLS
==================

Dulinor "marches" on Capital with his new Victory Fleet, sweeping a
research station as he travels, and destroying it and its contents.
He fights and defeats several elements of Lucan\'s forces, finally
reaching Capital and capturing the Imperial Palace.  Lucan is arrested
by his own guard, and brought to the Imperial Throne Room as part of
an amnesty deal.  On worldwide holo-vid (also transmitted to waiting
courier vessels), Dulinor convenes a court, tries and convicts Lucan
of crimes ranging from fratricide to genocide, various shades of
treason, and a whole range of war crimes - the court sentences Lucan
to death, and Dulinor "demonstrates [his] willingness to hand down
justice" by personally and publically executing him there and then.
At this point, before Dulinor can proclaim his return to the Iridium
Throne, the Throne Room is entered, via passages normally reserved for
the Emperor and his family, by a platoon (or maybe a company?) of
Aslan.  These are a number of Assassins from the Hierate (acting in
revenge for the murdered ambassador - Aslan hold an honourable grudge
idefinitely) accompanied by members of the (disbanded & disgraced)
Aslan Guard, intent on cleansing their Honour (the Aslan Guard have
been able to provide access to the Imperial Palace for their Hierate
cousins).  While the Guard hold off Dulinor\'s troops in a suicidal
action, Dulinor is challenged by an Aslan assassin.  Instead of
agreeing to fight the Aslan in an honourable manner, he attempts to
shoot him, and is set upon by the remaining assassins, who disarm him,
give him one more chance to fight honourably, and when he refuses,
kill him, and then commit suicide.  A small explosive then destroys
the interior of the Throne Room, rendering any possible efforts to
save Dulinor impossible.  News of Dulinor\'s (dishonourable) death is
carried away from Capital only slightly slower than that of Lucan\'s
execution.  Lucan\'s forces fall apart, some commanders attempting to
control their little areas of space, others fleeing in fear of
military justice, and still others prosecuting vendettas while they
have the chance.  Some attempt to atone for crimes of the past by
resolving to defend the people local to their assigned positions.
When news reaches the Federation of Illelish, it initially remains
intact, but after a few months shatters when it is clear that none of
Dulinor\'s advisors has the charisma or vision to fill the void.  Lady
Isis (Dulinor\'s daughter) refuses to continue the "genocidal war of
revenge" started by her father, and eventually comes to rule
"Matriarchy of Dlan", a small state at the centre of the former
Federation.

The result of the Death of Fools is two fold: Firstly, with the
removal of the to main antagonists in the Rebellion fighting, the
genocidal war subsides, but at the same time the impetus to maintain
the Imperium virtually vanishes.  Secondly, coupled with the death of
Brzk at Antares, there is a swathe of chaos extending from Verge in
the spin-rimward region to Antares in the trailing-coreward region.

On one side of this we have Strephon (failed ruler or imposter,
doubting his own competency, and wallowing in guilt at the destruction
of his subjects), Duke Norris (cut off from the main Imperium region
by the Vargr incursions, and moving increasingly away from mainstream
Imperial politics to deal with Vargr and Aslan problems, and the Zho
threat - such as the acceptance of Psionics - a precarious border
province is not a good place to start a drive to a new Empire), and
the Ziru Sirkaa (an increasingly insular state viewing the destruction
of the empire with horror and impotence - unable to recognise Strephon
as the true empire, as that would mean that they had been wrong in the
past - unable to build a new empire due to the restrictions imposed of
their culture).  On the other side of the chaos are Margaret\'s Domain
(where the ship\'s still run, but there is a split between the coreward
worlds, increasingly relying on slave trade, and the rimward worlds,
which are exposed to the Hiver through trade), the Solomani (who are
split by internal divisions, and have lost much of the reason for the
Confederation - ie. the Imperium - so they fall apart, leaving the
rimward parts of the Imperium in a mess), and Daibei, (which bolsters
its defences, hires some Aslan mercenary/settlers, and prepares itself
for dealing with the results of the chaos surrounding it - it also has
the fall back of trade with Reaver\'s Deep and the Hierate, and looks
likely to be one of the survivors of the coming collapse).

The coreward sectors are under attack from Vargr incursions, with only
Vland, the Spinward Marches, and parts of Deneb relatively free.  In
some areas, the Vargr equivalent of order is being established, but
Lishun is spearheading raids into the newly opened Antares and Core
sectors.

The central regions consist of independent worlds, small defence
cooperatives, and minor empires ruled by warlords.  Small wars and
minor catastrophes are common - but on a scale that PCs can deal with
and influence.

Comments welcome.

A good stating place would be the Lunar Institute of Technology
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/lunar/sdhp.html).  Not only are there some
designs for "real" starships, but there is also has a library page
which may have some useful refencece and links to other sites.  Hope
this helps.

There are, in my opinion, 1001+ things that were never fully covered in
either the Classic Traveller era or MegaTraveller. Add in the opportunities
presented by the new T4 Milieu settings and I can\'t begin to list the number
of possible supplements and adventures possible. The CORE group is currently
overwhelmed with ideas just for Milieu 0 - what I\'m trying to do is sort out
a coherent strategy addressing our mission statements and fulfilling our
core values while focusing our proactive contributors towards our Traveller
vision. CORE/BITS never forgets that our customers are our strength. Or is
it our people? Perhaps our shareholders? Nope. Don\'t have any of those. Oh
well, there goes another core value.

with vaccuum fluctuations. Even in empty space, there are electromagnetic
fields. This energy can excite empty space to produce a particle and an
anti-particle that (usually) instantly annihilate each other. It takes a
mild leap of faith, but the energy *is* there in the first place.

Regarding anti-gravity:

I found a web page describing one theory that gravity is (or at least
can be) caused by some sort of "null-space" that does not contain any
particles. The web page says that even empty space is not really empty
but "null-space" is truly empty, so I guess it precludes even vaccuum
fluctuations. The theory goes on to say that our sun is really held
together by some sort of electromagnetic process that also generates
"null-space" and thus its gravity. I must confess it sounded rather
wacky to me. I haven\'t heard of any theories in which you could use
vaccuum fluctuations to counter gravity, though.

The most interesting anti-gravity claim I heard involved inducing a
current in a superconducting disk. I believe there were claims by some
famous scientists that you might be able to affect gravity by changing
the spin on particles (a superconducting disk could do this). But I
haven\'t seen this hit the news yet, so I\'m getting a bit skeptical.

        Chirpers and humans are the unique source of meat in this planet at
the moment of the Collapse... in the first months, there is just not enough
food for everybody to survive, so humans start eating everything...
including a few cannibalism cases. Most chirpers are going to die anyway,
because there is not enough food to feed them.
        Later on, the population has been reduced and everything
stabilizes... but the surviving humans have already eaten chirpers, and
chirpers are still the sole source of meat in the planet apart from humans,
so... there is no need to become vegetarians, continue herding chirpers.
Moreover, there are other pressures: most people oppose sacrificing the
whole population of chirpers, but food is still a constraint, so the only
way to keep them alive is making them productive.. and that means food.

        Does this sound convincing enough....?

I think the advantage to using Virus for the collapse is that it was 
quick and sudden as opposed to a slow meaningless meat-grinder.  The 
recovery could begin on a number of world quick enough that there were 
still people alive who remembered what it was like before.  If the war 
had continued without some kind of sudden death knell, whatever your own 
personal choice is, I beleive that the recovery would have been much 
slower, centuries in coming.

No offense, but....

	....They HAVE detected those "undetectable" interactions.  If you do it
right, You can interact with those interactions.

	Also, just some food for thought.....Conservation of mass, conservation
of energy, and Heisenburgs principle only work in 3-D.  Take it to 4+

Imperium (maybe under Norris) in an alternate setting, I have a couple of
things to say. First, it seems to me that the idea was that the Rebellion
was simply "too much", that everything was too disrupted, so that
re-unifying the Imperium would be imposssible after, say, 1122. IIRC, the
interviews with Prof. Kuligaan set the tone.
        But, just for fun, there is an alternate setting I considered some
time ago and that I never used. Please allow me to Cut & Paste here...

        ALTERNATE TRAVELLER 1150: HEIRS OF LUCAN

        By Carlos Alos-Ferrer

1116-1128 Rebellion, Hard Times: MT setting.
1128 A fully operative version of The Virus is complete and functional,
under Lucan\'s control. This Virus does not operate when introduced in a ship
wearing Lucan\'s adequately modified transponder\'s (a version of the Virus
itself), and includes a "safety code" in the form of a coded instruction
that allows high security personnel to disconnect it. Lucan\'s scientific
personnel have an excellent understanding of the Virus and their possible
mutations. Enough to guarantee that it is not going to backfire immediately.
1129 Lucan releases the Virus when Dulinor\'s Fleet is on the way. The Virus
sweeps through known space. There are some filtrations of the safety codes,
but the advance is so quick that all factions apart from Lucan\'s are
collapsed. One exception: "Domain of Deneb goes off the air immediately. We
Keep the Flame. Good Luck". Dulinor\'s death reported. Strephon vanishes.
1130 Lucan\'s empire effectively wins the war. The Core is still economically
viable (HT: Lucan has never been interested in economics.). Re-building of
the Imperium begins. Lucan orders to proceed to former faction cores.
1132 Birth of Lucan\'s son.
1140 A paranoid Imperium under the rule of Lucan covers a big area of space,
including Solomani Rim, Vland, Daibei, Ley, and everything in between.
Domain of Deneb (now The Regency) re-contacted. Norris opposes Lucan\'s
orders and Lucan orders massive attack. The Deneb War erupts.
1141 The Regency learns about the safety codes of the Virus.
1142 A small group of worlds re-found the Solomani Confederation after
discovering the safety codes of the Virus.
1143 First organized Resistance strikes.
1145 Lucan dies (circumstances unclear). Fleet Admiral Traianus becomes High
Regent after some minor fighting. Lucan\'s 13-year old son declared Emperor
as Lucan II.
1150 Lucan II is 18. High Regent Traianus becomes First Counselor.

        What do we have now?
        A paramilitary, paranoid, "Lucanian", oppresive Third Imperium still
badly shaken but economically recovering.
        An 18-year old "Lucanian" emperor taking advise from naval counselor
used to "Lucanian" paranoia.
        An interstellar undercover anti-imperial movement, the "Resistance".
        The Regency, waging war at the Imperium in Deneb and Corridor sectors.
        All former Imperium neighbours (Solomani, Aslan, Vargr, K\'Kree,
Hiver) trying to recover from the Collapse, with the Third Imperium growing
towards them, and mutant Virus still around (some of them unaffected by
safety codes).

(End Paste)

        Well, I suppose that a re-unified Imperium under Lucan was not what
the original poster was thinking about, but... isn\'t it the easiest way to
do the job? :-)

A fair number of people have been talking about how militristic a game
in the RC setting would be. This doesn\'t have to be the case.  I am
running a campaign and so far the players have only gotten into one
fight. Their next adventure should have a little more action, but not a
lot. They will have to fight some robots and blow up a power plant.
After that there will be a political intrigue mission inside of the RC.  

Sure if you want you can run a campaign based on a squad of marines
blowing away TEDs, but it doesn\'t have to be that way.  You could do
the same thing in CT, How many merc tickets were published in JTAS? 
Those were pure military adventures.

As for Milieu 0 and 1200 being the same, they are similiar, but they do
have a different feel, and that makes a large difference.  I think they
are similiar enough that some adventures can be used in both settings,
and the tech levels are similiar, so I look forward to Starships and to
Central Supply Catalog.

Just some thoughts

One way that the Imperium can be reformed is the introduction of
a very powerful new alien, intent on conquest of the Imperium. While 
the Virus was sort of a new alien, in reality it was too subtle. People
did not know it was coming until it was too late. 

If all of the factions knew that there was an alien of superior
technological capability, say tech 17 invading the Imperium, after
finishinng off, say the Vargr, all the factions would unite to fight
off the threat. 

If it is a very long protracted fight, say over the course of 25 years
or so, the faction leadership will probably change significantly 
enough that the division would not exist.

That\'s not strictly true. Marcy et al looked at around 200 stars, and
found half a dozen inner-solar-system giant planets. However, their senstivity
is such that they\'re pretty complete for such planets down to half a jupiter
mass or so. The radial wobble induced by close in giants is much higher than
their radial velocity errors...The only way a gas giant could have hidden from
them is by being in a face-on orbit. So they\'re probably 50-75% complete.
Ergo, about 1 in 20-30 stars has a close-in gas giant. Those could still have
habitable moons, of course...Hopefully when/if T4 comes out with a detailed
system generation system it will reflect this, but it isn\'t a big effect.

VIII.  SPECIAL CASES IN COMBAT.
 1.   Misc.  There are a multitude of special rules starting on pg. 58
 of T4 covering Leaping and Jumping, Unusual Environments, Mounted Combat,
  Explosives, and Vehicle Combat.  The GM will implement these when
  necessary.

  AHL and Snapshot have rules for breaching barriers, breaking doors,
  effects of gas and tranq, vacuum, grenade deviation, satchel
  charges, etc.

 2.  Called Shots.  Characters may make several types of called shots
 in combat.  These are listed below.

  Increase Damage to Hand to Hand Attacks.  Characters may focus their
  attacks to the vital body parts of their opponent.  This simulates
  breaking a rib and puncturing a lung or cutting a throat.  Attacks
  to cause double damage suffer a -5 DM.  Attacks to cause triple
  damage suffer a -9 DM.  This rule applies to tackling and grappling
   attacks as well.  Armor is subtracted from the damage rating
  before any doubling or tripling occurs.  

  Decreased Damage to Hand to Hand Attacks.  Characters may try to
  minimize the damage they inflict on their opponents by checking
  their blows.  Use a -3 DM if half damage is attempted (half dice).
   Use a -6 DM for minimum damage (only 1 point inflicted per die). 

  Called Shot.  This rule can be used to attempt a disarm or attack to
  a specific hit location.  Use a -6 DM.

 3.  Special Rule--Tactics Pool.  Total all tactics skill levels on a
 side of a combat encounter to calculate the tactical pool for that side.  These
  points can be used by any member of the group as a favorable DM,
  and any number of points can be spent at one time.  Players should
  talk amongst themselves as to who should use these points, because
  once points are used, the pool is reduced to that level for the 	
  remainder of the combat.  The character with the highest Leadership
  skill should have the final say in any disputes (if no leadership
  skill, then the highest tactical skill).  These DMs are applies
  before the dice are rolled.

 4.  Special Rule--Endurance Pool.  Combat is tiring and fatigue sets
 in fast.  This pool simulates hand to hand fatigue.  The pool is equal to a character\'s
  current End score, and each time a character attempts a blow, a
  point (called a fatigue point) is removed from the pool.  When
  the pool reaches 0, it automatically fills up again to the
  character\'s End (wounds do not effect this pool unless End was
  reduced in a 	 previous encounter), but all attacks are made at a -1
  DM.  When the pool reaches 0 again, it again fills up to a limit
  of the character\'s End, but all attacks are at -2 and so on.

 5.  Special Rule--Strength Pool.  This pool simulates an effort a
 character can make to use his strength to increase his damage in unarmed hand to hand
  combat.  The pool totals an amount equal to the character\'s Str. 
  For each point spent from this pool, the character is allowed to
  re-roll a damage die from a hand to hand strike (not an armed
  strike).  Any damage die may be re-rolled (many times, if the player
   decides), but the new value must be used.  When the pool reaches
  0, this is no longer allowed.  Note that the Str pool can never be
  greater than the character\'s Str at the start of the encounter
  i.e. wound damage does not reduce the points in this pool unless
  Str was reduced in a previous encounter.

 6.  Special Rule--Dexterity Pool.  This pool simulates the extra
 effort a character can put forth to defend himself in a hand to hand attack (either armed
  or unarmed).  The pool totals the amount of the character\'s Dex,
  and each point spent can be used as a -DM after the hit is rolled! 
  Thus, it an attacker needed an 8 to hit, but rolled a 5, the 	
  defender could spend 4 points from his Dex pool to increase the
  thrown number to a 9 which misses.  When the Dex pool is empty,
  this is no longer allowed.  Note that the Dex pool can never be
  greater than the character\'s Dex at the start of the encounter
  i.e. wound damage does not reduce the points in this pool unless Dex
  was reduced in a previous encounter.

 7.  Coup De Grace.  Any gun or blade may be used to administer a coup
 de grace and kill an unconscious or unstruggling individual at contact range in
  one combat round.  No die rolls are necessary.  A coup de grace
  may be administered with hands or brawling weapons using special
  blows, but die rolls must be made to hit.

 8.  Armor Equivalency.  It is sometimes necessary to figure the AV of
 a building, brick wall, starship hull, or other structure.  Use the armor equivalency
  table below to calculate an AV.  First, estimate how thick the
  structure is in cm, then divide that thickness by the listed
  number.  The result will be the AV for the structure.  This is 	
  also a good way to figure the AV of a vehicle--to see if a round
  could penetrate and cause damage to people inside.  

  Follow an example.  A stone wall is 30cm thick (about 12 inches). 
  Using the table (30 / 5 = 6), the AV for the wall is 6.

  Material		Armor Value 1 =.	1cm = 0.3937 inches
  Coherent Superdense	00.025cm
  Bonded Superdense	00.035cm
  Superdense		00.070cm
  Crystaliron		00.125cm
  Composite Laminates	00.167cm
  Light Composites	00.250cm
  Armor Plate		00.500cm
  Light Alloy Sheet Steel	00.600cm
  Reinforced Concrete	02.500cm
  Concrete/Bricks	03.300cm
  Stone/Packed Dirt/Wood	05.000cm
  Loose Dirt		25.000cm

  The table below shows some precalculated AVs for some common
  structures listed for easy reference.

  Structure				AV.
  Wooden wall, 20cm thick (8 inches)		 4
  Sandbag wall, 150cm thick (5 feet)		 6
  Brick wall, 26.4cm thick (10 inches)		 8
  Stone wall, 30cm thick (1 foot)		 6
  Starship interior wall,
   -light alloy sheet steel, 5cm thick (2 inches)	 8
  Concrete wall, 33cm (13 inches)		10
  Reinforced concrete wall, 37.5cm thick (15 inches)	15
  Heavy steel frame wall, 10cm thick (4 inches)	20
  Log and earthen wall, 120cm thick, (4 feet)	24
  Bunker concrete wall, 70cm thick (2.3 feet)	28
  Starship interior bulkhead,
   -light alloy sheet steel, 24cm thick (9 inches)	40
  Starship exterior hull,
   -Coherent superdense, 1.5cm thick (.5 inches)	60

 9.  Knockdown.  At times, it may be necessary to determine if a
 character is knocked down from the force of a blow.  Whenever a character takes damage of
  more than half his current points in an attribute, a check must be
  made.  The knockdown only applies to the physical stats of Str,
  Dex, and End.  		

  To avoid being knocked down, roll the effected attribute (full
  value) or less on 2 D6.  Boxcars automatically fail.  If more than
  one attribute is effected by a single damage roll, then the player
  may choose which attribute to make the check for.

  Characters who are knocked down may get up if they make the check,
  and the check can be performed once each round.  Characters down for
  longer than one round are winded by the blow.

 10.  Stun.  The procedure for a stun is exactly like a knockdown,
 except the character\'s mental stats (Edu and Int) are used.  

 11.  Gravity.  Gravity can effect a character\'s load and throw range. 
 Divide a character\'s load capacity or throw range by the local gravity in Gs.  This will
  result in an increased or decreased value for each statistic.

  If it is important to find the exact relative weight of an item,
  multiply its weight in kg\'s by the local gravity in Gs.  This will
  result in an increased or decreased relative 	 weight.  Be careful
  not to mix these two systems.  If using the first system above, all
  items should be calculated at their 1 G weights.  Otherwise, items
  will be compensated twice for gravity.

tactical combat system based on Azhanti High Lightning and Snapshot, 
and special rules for activities in zero-G/vacuum taken from

VII.  HEALING AND MEDICAL TREATMENT.
 1.  Procedure.  Healing can take place either naturally or at an
 increased pace by medical attention.  There are a variety of steps required for
  specific wounds based on their category.  See the specific
  sections below.  In all cases, Diagnosis must be performed first.

 2.  Diagnosis.  Before medical treatment can be applied, a diagnosis
 roll must be made.  The time it takes to make this assessment is 3 D6 x 2 minutes
  (DMs:  - Medical Skill;  -1 if Edu 5+;  -2 if Edu 10+;  -3 if Edu
  15).  This assumes the injuries are external--if character has
  internal damage, the time roll is 3 D6 x 4 minutes (same DMs).  If
  a TL 7-11 medkit is used, reduce the time factor to 30 sec for 	
  external injuries and 1 min for internal injuries.  If a TL12+
  medkit is used, reduce the time increment to instant.  This time
  increment becomes important to prevent further injury to the
  character due to no medical treatment.     

  To diagnose an injury:  Routine test of Medical skill.

  This task becomes Difficult if it is performed in the field.  If
  this task is failed, the GM will roll 2 D6 on the mishap table to
  see if a misdiagnosis occurred.  On a major mishap, the GM will
  apply an additional 1 D6 damage points from the misdiagnosis.

 3.  Superficial wounds.  Character has taken damage, but no attributes
 have been reduced to 0.

  Natural healing rate:  2 points per characteristic per day.  Healing
  can only take place while the character is convalescing--meaning
  that a character needs to be 	 home bound or on light duty during
  this period.  

  Treatment roll:  This roll simulates the cleaning and binding of
  superficial wounds to prevent infection.  Treatment requires the use
  of a first aid or medical kit.  If this skill throw is not
  successful, the natural healing rate must be used instead of the 		
  medical healing rate.  The time it takes to perform treatment is 3
  D6 x 2 min (use medical skill level and the Edu DMs listed in the
  diagnosis section as negative DMs on this throw).  Success on this
  throw allows the damaged character to heal at the medical healing
  rate.  This roll indicates that initial treatment has been performed
   and a treatment regiment has been prescribed.  The throw does not
  have to be performed more than once, and success indicates that
  the healing procedure has been accomplished.  The patient may be
  given some medication or bandages to administer by himself.  The
  time throw is that required for actual treatment and does 	 not
  include time for lab tests, etc.

  Easy test of First Aid or Medical skill  

  Medical healing rate:  All wound points are recovered in 24 hours. 
  This requires a skill level of Medical-2, First Aid-2, or better. 
  If a skill level 0 or 1 is used, then the natural healing rate
  must be used.  (Medical treatment from a 0 level or level 1 	
  skilled character still needs to be applied to avoid the wound
  deterioration roll.) Healing can only take place while the
  character is convalescing--meaning that a character needs to be
  home bound or on light duty during this period. 

  Wound deterioration:  If a character does not receive proper medical
  attention for 	 his wound in the specified time, there is a chance
  that the superficial wound will deteriorate into a minor wound. 
  Medical treatment must be applied in 2 D6 hours (the diagnosis
  must be completed and treatment must be begun), and if not, this
  roll must be made.  If this roll fails, roll 2 D6 on the mishap
  table and apply extra damage.  Failure on the wound deterioration
  roll indicates that infection has set in.  Repeat the 2 D6 roll on
  the mishap table for extra damage every hour until the character
  receives medical care or dies.  If successful medical attention is
  applied (or if the wound deterioration roll is successful but the
  time for medical treatment has expired), the character can recover
  at the natural healing rate.  

  Roll 7- on 2 D6 to avoid wound deterioration 

  Surgery:  Surgery is not required for superficial wounds.

  Replacement body part:  This is not required for superficial wounds.
  



 4.  Minor wounds.  Character has taken damage and one attribute is
 reduced to 0.

  Natural healing rate:  1 point per characteristic per day.  Healing
  can only take place while the character is convalescing--meaning
  that a character needs to be 	 home bound or on light duty during
  this period.  

  Treatment roll:  This roll simulates the cleaning, stitching, and
  bandaging of 	 minor wounds in order to facilitate healing and
  prevent infection.  Treatment requires the use of a first aid or
  medical kit.  If this skill throw is not successful the natural 	
  healing rate must be used instead of the medical healing rate.  The
  time it takes to perform treatment is 3 D6 x 3 min (use medical
  skill level and the Edu DMs listed in the diagnosis section as
  negative DMs on this throw).  Success on this throw allows the
  damaged character to heal at the medical healing rate.  This roll
  indicates that initial treatment has been performed and a
  treatment regiment has been prescribed.  The throw does not have to
  be performed every day.  The time throw is that required for actual
  treatment and does not include time for lab tests, etc.

  Average test of First Aid or Medical skill  

  Medical healing rate:  2 points per characteristic per day.  This
  requires a skill level of Medical-3, First Aid-3, or better.  If a
  skill level 0, level 1, or level 2 is used, then the natural
  healing rate must be used.  (Medical treatment from a 0 level, level
  1, or level 2 skilled character still needs to be applied to avoid
  the wound deterioration roll.)

  Wound deterioration:  If a character does not receive proper medical
  attention for 	 his wound in the specified time, there is a chance
  that the minor wound will deteriorate into a serious wound. 
  Medical treatment must be applied in 1 D6 x 10 minutes (the
  diagnosis must be completed and treatment must be begun), and if
  not, this roll must be made.  If this roll fails, roll 2 D6 on the
  mishap table and apply extra damage.  Failure on the wound
  deterioration roll indicates that infection has set in.  If a roll
  of 2 exactly is made on the mishap roll, a catastrophic trauma has
  occurred and the character dies immediately.  This reflects the
  fact that sometimes trauma 	 patients may seem okay, but suddenly
  die when a critical blood vessel ruptures or some other hidden
  damage takes full effect.  Repeat the 2 D6 roll on the mishap 	
  table for extra damage every hour until the character receives
  medical care or dies.  If successful medical attention is applied
  (or if the wound deterioration roll is successful but the time
  for medical treatment has expired), the character can recover at
  the natural healing rate.  

  Roll 7- on 2 D6 to avoid wound deterioration  

  Surgery:  Surgery is required for all minor wounds resulting from
  gunshot, fragment, blade, and puncture wounds.  It is not needed for
  minor burns from energy weapons.

  Replacement body part:  This is not required for minor wounds.

 5.  Serious wounds.  Character has taken damage and two attributes are
 reduced to 0.

  Natural healing rate:  Serious wounds cannot heal naturally. 
  Medical attention is required.  Serious wounds must be diagnosed
  and stabilized before any healing can take place.  

  Treatment roll:  Serious wounds require the use of a medical
  facility like a local hospital, aid station, or sickbay of a
  starship.  Treatment cannot be performed until the patient has
  been diagnosed and stabilized.  The time it takes to perform 		
  treatment is 3 D6 x 6 min (use medical skill level and the Edu DMs
  listed in the diagnosis section as negative DMs on this throw). 
  Success on this throw allows the damaged character to heal at the
  medical healing rate.  Note that Medical-3 or better is required
  to perform treatment on seriously wounded characters.  This roll 	
  indicates that initial treatment has been performed and a treatment
  regiment has 	 been prescribed.  The throw does not have to be
  performed every day.  The time throw is that required for actual
  treatment and does not include time for lab tests, etc.

  Formidable test of Medical skill  

  Medical healing rate:  1 point per day.  This requires a skill level
  of Medical-3 or better.  Characters of lower skill level cannot
  help seriously wounded characters.  This may be attempted once per
  day.  Roll randomly as to which characteristic this is applied to. 
  If the stat rolled is at maximum, no healing occurs that day. 
  Healing can only take place while the character is in the hospital
  or is convalescing.    

  Wound deterioration:  Medical treatment must be applied in 2 D6
  minutes (the 	 diagnosis and stabilization rolls must be completed)
  or the character dies.  If this is completed but medical attention
  at a suitable facility is not performed in the next hour, roll 3
  D6 on the mishap table and apply extra damage.  Serious wounds 	
  automatically begin to deteriorate at a rate determined by this
  mishap throw per hour until major medical treatment is received or
  the character dies.  Any roll of 2 6s indicates (of the three
  dice) a catastrophic trauma has occurred, and the character dies
  immediately.    

  Surgery:  Surgery is required for all serious wounds resulting from
  gunshots, fragments, blades, punctures, and burns from energy
  weapons.

  Replacement body part:  Roll a check to see if the body part is
  damage beyond repair.  The player chooses one of his character\'s
  stats that have been reduced to 0 and rolls the stat (undamaged
  level) or less on 3 D6.  If this roll is successful, no 	
  replacement body part is needed.  If the roll fails, replacement
  parts are needed before the limb can function again--or possibly
  before healing can take place.

 6.  Death.  A character who has received damage that reduces three
 attributes to 0 is dead, but, in the 57th century, these characters still may be
  helped.		

  Assuming the brain is not destroyed (and the torso is not crushed,
  etc.), a character can survive for 1 D6 minutes after the heart
  has stopped.  A character can be saved if he is placed in a low
  berth (or on life support at a TL9+ facility) within this time limit
  (requires Medical-2+).  During this time, the character\'s attributes
  remain at 0, and he will be vulnerable to any influence that
  interferes with his life support such as a severe jolt or
  depletion of needed supplies.  If the dead character is tended by
  a surgeon or other specialist (Medical-4+), he may be sustained in
  this condition indefinitely or until his life supports are
  threatened.  Otherwise, he can only be held in suspended animation
  for 2-12 months.  The character must then make a normal low berth
  survival throw.  The character can be treated at a facility of at 	
  least TL11, and requires a Staggering test of Medical skill
  (requires Medical-4+).  Use a DM of +1 for every TL over 13.  If
  this test succeeds, the character recovers in a comatose state with
  one point in each physical attribute.  Subsequent treatment will
  restore one point to one characteristic per week if a roll of 9+ is
  made on 2 D6.  Use a DM of +1 for each TL over 12.  The player
  must decide before each week\'s roll which attribute is to be
  restored that week.  If the character misses the roll, the chosen
  attribute is reduced permanently one point.  When stats reach 4 or 	
  the max level, whichever is less, the character may resume limited
  activity.  Up until this point, all healing must be done in a
  hospital.  At the restoration of 4 points, the character may
  convalesce and heal at a rate of one point per stat per day.  This 	
  must be rolled randomly, like for serious wounds, and points applied
  to maxed stats are lost.  

  Dead characters must be diagnosed, resuscitated, and stabilized
  before healing (or they are put in a low berth) can take place.

  Replacement body part:  Replacement body parts are absolutely
  required for dead characters before a limb can function again--or
  possibly before healing can take place. 

 7.  Surgery.  Minor and serious wounds from gunshot wounds and
 fragments require that the slugs and fragments be removed.  In all cases,
  tissue damage must be repaired.  Wounds from energy weapons will
  often require extensive surgery because their great heat will
  usually cause a steam explosion from the water in the tissues, and
  considerable damage to adjacent tissues from radiated heat.  Doctors
  in surgery must be assisted by at least one surgical technician of
  Medical-2+ and at least one anesthetist.  

  Because recovery from surgery is by no means certain, a wounded
  character undergoing an operation must throw a surgical survival
  and recovery roll.  Roll 2 D6 for 6+ for normal recovery.  A 2
  means death on the operating table, and a 3, 4, or 5 means an
  impaired recovery.  Use the DMs below on this throw.  For impaired 	
  recovery, throw 2 D6 of permanent damage to a character\'s stats. 
  These points may be distributed in any fashion the player decides,
  but the dice cannot be broken up.  If any characteristic is
  permanently reduced to 0, the character will remain in a permanent
  coma.

  Surgery Survival Roll DMs
  TL14+ facility	+2
  TL12+ facility	+1
  TL6 facility		-1
  TL5 facility		-6
  Surgeon\'s Dex 8+	+1
  Surgeon\'s Dex 10+	+2
  Medical skill		+1 for each level over 3
  Anesthetist 		+1 if Medical skill is 3+
  Surgical Tech	+1 if Medical skill is 3+

 8.  Post Operative Care.  Characters who undergo surgery require time
 recovering in a hospital and an additional period of reduced activity in
  convalescence.  Characters who have suffered minor wounds require
  2 D6 days in the hospital, and those who have suffered serious
  wounds require 1 D6 x 10 days in the hospital.  During this time,
  a character\'s stats will be halfway (possibly improved) between
  their wounded value and their max value.  For some wound
  categories, their are two healing rates listed--natural and
  medical.  Character\'s may heal at the higher rate given that they 	
  convalesce after their discharge from the hospital.   

  Characters with minor wounds may leave the hospital in half the
  indicated time provided they remain bed patients in the care of a
  Medical-1 nurse for the balance of their recovery period.

 9.  Convalescing.  A character may return to limited duty while he is
 convalescing as long as the work is not strenuous.  For example, a character may
  perform short hours for navigation or admin positions, but may not
  hunt or exert himself in a piloting (small craft) position. 
  Fighting may be done only in self-defense until the character is
  nearly or completely recovered.

 10.  Medical Costs.  Use these guidelines when deciding how much to
 charge for doctor\'s fees.  A character can use his medical skill as a positive
  DM on any of the dice throws below when determining cost.

  An ordinary trip to a physician (an office call), on average, costs
  Cr10 per medical skill level.

  The cost of treating a superficial wound is usually 1 D6 x Cr10 plus
  the cost of the office visit.  

  The cost of treating a minor wound is usually 2 D6 x Cr10 plus the
  cost of the office visit.

  The cost of treating a serious wound is usually 4 D6 x Cr10 plus the
  cost of the office visit.

  The cost of treating a critical wound is usually 8 D6 x Cr10 plus
  the cost of the office visit.

  Surgery on a minor wound typically costs  1 D6 x Cr500 plus the cost
  of treating the wound and any other costs incurred. 

  Surgery on a serious wound typically costs  2 D6 x Cr1000 plus the
  cost of treating the wound and any other costs incurred.

  Surgery on a critical wound typically costs  2 D6 x Cr1000 plus the
  cost of treating the wound and any other costs incurred.  

  Hospital care is typically Cr500 per day for first 1D-3 days after
  surgery, then Cr100 after that.

  Out patient costs for minor wounds typically run 2 D6 x Cr10 per
  week.

  Character\'s may wish to hire a home health aid or nurse.  Home care
  usually costs Cr25 per day per skill level of the care provider. 
  Hiring a home health aid will alloy the patient to recover points
  at the rate indicated for medical supervision.  

  Taking care of a patient in a near death situation (a character with
  a critical wound saved through the low berth or life support
  procedure) is very expensive.  This costs a minimum of Cr250,000
  for the treatment plus Cr5,000 per day of recovery in the hospital
  and Cr500 per day of outpatient therapy.

  Doctors receive all of the office call and minor surgery fees. 
  Private practice physicians typically receive 50% of the surgical
  fee with the balance going to the hospital and assistants.  Some
  doctors may be on retainer or salary (like when they are in the
  employ of a noble or hospital).  Typically, mercenaries have their
  medical paid for by the organization they work for.

  In addition to these, there is a cost associated with general,
  non-surgical treatment of a wound.  Miscellaneous medical items for
  the treatment of Superficial wounds costs 3 D6 Cr.  For minor
  wounds, this cost is Cr10 x 2 D6.  For serious wounds and above,
  these costs are included in the surgery and hospital costs.

 11.  Stabilization and Resuscitation.  Both serious wounds and
 destroyed wounds must be stabilized before healing can take place.  Dead characters must
  be resuscitated if they are to be healed.  Both of these tasks are
  based on the use of an automed (or in a hospital facility).  If they
  are attempted with a medkit, increase the difficulty one level and
  double the time increment.

  To stabilize a character:  Routine test of Medical skill.  
  (time factor 90 seconds)

  To resuscitate a dead person:  Difficult test of Medical skill.  
  (time factor 30 seconds)

 12.  Low Berths.  Rules for low berth usage is listed on pg. 115 of
 T4.  There are additional rules on pg. 40 of TD #21.

 13.  Replacement Body Parts.  There are rules for replacement body
 parts, prosthetics, bionics, regrowth, and cloning on pg. 35 of TD #12.  This is
  continued on pg. 32 of TD #13.  Additional pieces of equipment and
  drugs are listed on pg. 26 of TC #9.

 14.  Instant Healing.  Through use of drugs and medical skill, a
 medical provider can return hit points directly to a patient at the completion of initial
  treatment.  In order for this to occur, medical treatment must be
  successful and provided in the allotted time for each wound
  category.  

  For superficial wounds, return an amount of points to the injured
  character equal to the Medical or First Aid skill of the care
  provider.  Roll 1 D6 to apply each point (a result of 1=Str,
  2=Dex, 3=End, 4=Int, 5=Edu, 6=doctor\'s choice).  Points applied to 	
  maxed attributes are lost.  

  For minor wounds, care providers must have Medical-2, First Aid-2,
  or better.  Only one point can be applied, and it is rolled in the
  same manner.  If a 0 stat is improved to 1 in this manner, the
  character is no longer unconscious.

  Serious and critical wounds cannot be improved in this manner.

 15.  Medical Skill.  On pg. 45 of T4, it states that the medical skill
 is not only the study of medicines, but also the training to heal patients and maintain
  health of individuals.  The skill level represents steps in
  increasingly better ability to treat diseases and injuries. 
  Guidelines for the skill are listed below.

  Medical-1 signifies that the individual is a qualified medic.  This
  person can also obtain a license to serve as a medic aboard a
  starship.  A nurse, paramedic, medical student, or EMT would be
  considered to have medical-1.  

  Medical-2 indicates more advanced knowledge equivalent to a
  physician\'s assistant, nurse specialist, or last year medical
  student.  Medical-2 expertise or better allows a +1 DM when reviving
  low passengers.

  Medical-3 is the qualification for a person to be a doctor--whether
  he has a license or not.  A medical license allows a character to
  write prescriptions, handle most ailments, and communicate with
  other doctors on a professional level.

  Medical-4 is usually the minimum qualification for a specialist.

 16.  Surgeon.  To obtain a surgeon\'s license, a character must be a
 doctor (obtained medical-3) and pass the medical board exam.  The exam is a difficult
  test of medical skill (with Edu), and characters with a Dex of 8+
  receive a +3 DM.  If the character fails this throw, then he has
  flunked his exam but may try again after his medical skill is
  increased.  Only one try per level is allowed.

  Surgery skill throws use the character\'s Dex--not his Edu or Int. 
  Characters who try surgery without being surgeons do so at a
  negative DM equal to 12 - skill level.

 17.  Xeno Medicine.  Normally, medical expertise is considered to
 apply to the individual\'s own race.  Medical skill for humans is considered to
  apply to humans--whether vilani, zhodani, or solomani.  This skill
  also implies, to a limited extent, to the animals which live on
  human worlds and to the ones that live on the character\'s home
  world (or other world where he was trained an practiced).  

  Anyone with a medical skill can apply that skill, with a reduction
  of -2, to aliens.  If the alien organism is broadly similar to the
  race the skill was meant for (carbon based, oxygen breathing,
  water drinking, etc.), then apply a -4 DM to all medical throws. 
  If the organism radically different from the care giving race (for
  example, a creature that metabolizes ammonia or combusts in a
  oxygen atmosphere), then apply a -8 DM to all medical throws.  
  			

  One exception to his rule is human doctors and vargr patients or
  vice versa.  The only modification is that the skill level is
  reduced by 1.  Vargr and human physiology is remarkably similar.

 18.  First Aid?  This skill is described on pg. 42 of T4.  It can be
 used in the place of Medical skill for any task dealing with superficial or minor wounds.
   The skill can also be used to resuscitate a dead character or
  stabilize a serious or critically wounded character.

 19.  Treatment throws and environment for superficial and minor
 wounds.  		
  
Superficial and minor wounds can be treated anywhere as long as the
  doctor has a 	 medical kit.  If treatment is done in the field, use
  a -4 DM.  There is no DM if treatment is done at an average
  facility, like a sickbay in a ship.  When treating these wounds in
  a hospital quality facility, use a +4 DM.

 20.  Time rolls.  In many cases when dealing with medical recovery,
 time is of the utmost importance.  All time rolls are made the standard way by
  rolling 3 D6 and multiplying by the time factor to see how long it
  took to do a procedure.  Medical personnel can use their skill
  level as a -DM on this time roll to simulate their speed and
  experience.

 21.  Self treatment.  Characters with superficial wounds may treat
 themselves if they have the proper equipment available.  Characters with minor and
  serious wounds may treat themselves as long as they are conscious.
   Characters with a minor wound must make an End check on 2 D6 (at
  full End) to be able to treat themselves.  The check is made with
  3 D6 in the case of serious wounds.

 22.  Patient/Doctor Time.  Medical care takes time, and there is a
 limit to how much one doctor can do.  It may be necessary to see if a doctor has enough
  time in the day to treat patients if he has several.  Use the
  chart below as a guide to determine the doctor\'s work load by
  counting the number of wound levels (not patients) that he is 	
  treating and multiply by the time factor.  A physician with a heavy
  work load may have to prioritize which patients he treats. 
  Patient time refers to the time the doctor actually spends with
  the patient and any other time the doctor spends behind the scenes
  running tests, researching problems, etc.  

  WOUND LEVEL	PATIENT TIME
  Superficial		30 minutes (total), or the treatment time roll.
  Minor		1 hr. per week
  Serious		1.5 hrs. per day
  Critical		2 hrs. per day

Last session, the party split into two -- one of the fragments continued it\'s trek to 
the religious Gather in order to seek out those medicinal herbs, the other fragment 
diverted to deal with a encampment of offworld slavers that has been bedeviling the 
locals.

1. Slaver Blues: The party encountered more evidence of offworld slavers -- burned-out 
and abandoned villages and the occasional crossbow-armed sniper. One such sniper was 
subdued, and thinking he was  a captive of other slavers, resisted the PC\'s "We\'re 
friends-and-not-evil-offworlders!" shuck-and-jive. The sniper was turned loose, sans 
crossbow bolts, and warned not to trifle with the party again. He gladly ran away. 

Meanwhile, one of the slavers, a offworld mercenary who developed a conscience, was 
himself enslaved. This character, of course, is destined to be a replacement PC for the 
ship\'s tactical officer, who was killed last session. In the fullness of time, he 
escaped the slaver camp, stealing a weapon and a map detailing the minefields around the 
camp.

The anti-slaver party eventually encountered this escapee, who told his tale and joined 
the party.

The party found the camp, and in true blood-and-thunder style, took down the camp with 
lasers and RAM grenades. A few slavers managed to escape, but the majority didn\'t. The 
freed slaves scattered.

2. A Spiritual Journey: Baroness Lita continued her trek to the Gather. She continued to 
work with an increasingly diverse cast of characters, including a powerful Bard. With 
all this support, she is beginning to gain some measure of control over her psionic 
abilities. Along with the control, she is learning important aspects of psi ethics. The 
only major encounter along the way was brush with slavers. The slavers were defeated, 
but it was a  near-run thing . . . .

Next Week: Festival-tyme!

I don\'t know of any canon critters that fit the description, but there
is nothing to stop us from making up one and then uplifting it.  I
could easily see someone thinking creating a dragon would be a really
nifty idea. We could just put it on a planet in the Solomani Rim.
 
The other option would be to steal a page from Jurassic Park, and say
that the Solomani were able to reconstruct a few bits of dinosaur DNA,
specifically one of the petredon or terredactyl family.  The
probability of this technique actually being possible has been debated,
but we could allow it.

Someone complained that this was starting to sound like Albedo. I think
that this is something to watch out for.  The uplifted animals are not
common. Individual worlds probably fund the development of certain
animals and the animals exist on those world and a few nearby worlds,
but hardly anywhere else.  
Also the sentient animals are not humans with furry ears, but probably
still look like their presentient ancestors with different hands to
allow tool use and different jaws and throat structures to possibly
allow language use.  

Many people have mentioned David Brin\'s books as a source of
inspiration, and they are. Another good source is LOVELOCK by Orson
Scott Card and Karen Something. (I forgot)  It has animal companions
for very important persons.  The animal is part secretary and assistant
and also records the VIPs life for historical perspective.  The main
character is Lovelock and he is a Monkey, I believe the same type as in
the movie Outbreak.  There is also a pig and a parrot is metioned.  Its
a pretty good book, and gives another perspective on the uplift process.

campaign setting of TNE.  I don\'t expect to convince anyone who doesn\'t like 
the setting that they are wrong -- to each his own, after all -- and I 
certainly don\'t want to get into a pissing contest, but I\'d like to take a 
moment to explain why TNE is my favorite setting to date and address a few of 
the points he made.

First, there is variety.  With the RC, the Regency, and the whole of the Wilds 
to draw from, you can craft a setting pretty much to your liking.  If you like 
military stuff, the RC may be the place for you.  If that feels too cramped or 
you are longing for "the good old days," well, you have all of the Spinward 
Marches to campaign in.  And if you want something totally new, who knows what 
is waiting out in the Wilds -- maybe even another Regency.

Second, characters had a purpose (at least in the RC).  I can understand why 
the undercurrent of violence would be disturbing, but it was violence in a 
good cause (e.g., toppling TEDs).  How many people were involved in campaigns 
as mercenaries?

Third, TNE passed the novel test -- if this were a novel, would I be happy 
that I spent time reading it?  The answer was always yes.  I eagerly awaited 
each new release, because it was clear that the story was moving forward, and 
that that there would be inevitable conflict as the subplots came together.  
[Notice "conflict," not "violence."  Without conflict, there is no drama.]  
What was going to happen when the RC and the Imperium meet?  Both can be 
considered the good guys, but each is likely to regard the other as anathema.  
What about the Zho\'s and the Empress Wave?  The Black Curtain?  The other 
pocket empires?  The Hiver plot(s)?  [I really hope they do a wrap-up book.]

I always found CT to be colorless, and I passed on it when it first came out.  
MT was better, but not particularly original in approach. TNE caught my eye, 
though, because it was a good story in and of itself.  

One last point -- am I the only one who did _not_ find the TNE setting to be 
dark and depressing?  This wasn\'t T2K, despite claims to the contrary.  The 
disaster by this point was long past, and the setting was one of new 
challenges every day and new worlds to explore with every mission.  Yes, bad 
things had happened on those worlds once, but in the relatively distant past.  
If you don\'t like cemetary worlds, then don\'t campaign there.

I think it is funny that Tim Peter describes T4 in much the same way that I 
look upon TNE.  I, unfortunately for me (I guess), just don\'t see it in T4.  I 
don\'t see any evidence that the story is going anyplace we haven\'t already 
been for twenty years.  And, while the crash of the long night before Cleon 
may have been softer, I suspect we would see some of the same things -- TEDs 
and worlds where billions died as the political and social institutions 
disintegrated -- as we saw in TNE.

Only one prob with this, the Zhos have no intention of conquering the marches, they just 
want a stable neighbour who is not going to take all the best unclaimed worlds. In addition, 
the Zhos seemed to be in some sort of mess by 1120, with warships fleeing something in

Not bad, too neat though.

I don\'t think that Dulinor\'s daughter is any nicer than her dad, and if historical rulers are 
anything to go by, female monrachs are not nicer and kinder than their male counterparts.

I would rather Lucan fled, and a double got aced. Thus, a great villain survives, as he tries 
to gather his forces (probably towards the Solomani Rim, with the Vegans providing a solid 
core)

I think what you would end up with is a divvying of the Imperium into stable and relatively 
peaceful armed camps

With the breakdown in communications, it really wouldn\'t matter. So the Vilani come to 
Lucan and say "we\'re under attack", Lucan would say gimme my money and swear loyalty,

Europe and the Muslims refused to unite against the Mongols, and even tried to get them to 
side with their faction, even Europeans sided with the Mongols. The Spanish found 
Mexican allies easily to fight the Aztecs because they hated their traditional foe more than the 
new one. Methinks humaniti will never learn

I agree, but it does depend on the threat. But just about any threat to
a single world could be overcome by the massive power the Imperium could
bring to bear, either medical, military or economic. Large scale threats
as a roleplaying are out. Better to go with smaller scale threats.
Assaninations, local medical emergencies, disasters, etc.
I must also say that my players are always eminently sensible.
If there is a government body that can deal with the problem, thay will
hand off as soon as possible (sometimes), and escape to a less dangerous
area. That\'s the reason why I like to have a large scale threat occur
from time to time. (There\'s no where to run to guys, you had better try
to deal with it yourselves.)

Then again, maybe they wouldn\'t, the Vilani had decided that the Third
Imperiumwas over, they were beginning to get the Vargr under control.
Strephon was out the fight, so if Norris came storming through Corridor
(through Vargr states that he had made alliances with that WOULD resist
him), the Vilani could meet him head on.
The Aslan second sons were using the death of the ambassador as a
pretext (read excuse) for invading Regency territory, once Norris\'s
fleets became tied up elsewhere, you can bet those Aslan would start
pushing again.

I don\'t think so, Strephon had been discredited (no-one beleived it was
him), Norris\'s military might will be watered down by Guarding against
the Vargr and the Aslan, and lets not forget the Zhodani..
Margaret might wait to see what happens with the Vilani, and even
then....

I think all the defections that were going to take place had already
happened. Strephon was already a great power once, all the defections
had already happened , by the end his large force had been gutted by
constant attrition with Lucan and Dulinor.

I don\'t think so, for all his \'madness\', Lucan was a very canny
politition, he would probably have seen a palace coup coming, and done
something about it. Unfortunately, by the time Norris could have come on
to the scene, most of the figures of power would have so many war crimes
charges to be levelled against them, it would be in their best interests
to continue to support Lucan.
That leaves the Lucan as the strongest faction still. He would fight,
and fight hard (and very, very dirty)

That\'s right, and if you ignore the virus idea, Dulinor had just built a
huge fleet to go take the core with. Now, if Norris was lucky, Dulinor
would have already taken the capital and killed Lucan, this would mean
that there would be less ships all round (Dulinors ships, and those
remaining of Lucan\'s who decided to follow Imperial precedent and serve
the new Emperor)
If Norris was unlucky, Dulinor would take a defensive posture, and wait
until Norris had smashed himself against Lucan, and then clean up the
mess, or just send his fleet against Norris (That leaves Lucan smiling)
 

> The Imperium would be back, unified and

The Zhodani would probably step in before that happens. While the
Imperium was in tatters, they were safe, if it looked like reuniting,
then they might have to do something to prevent that. What I don\'t know,
the Fifth frontier war had left them in bad condition.

The Vargr would still be attacking, and the K\'Kree would probably jion
the fray soon too.

The Imperium had set it\'s borders by 1100, and just like the Roman
Empire, after that, there was nothing left to happen except for it to
fall to peices.


Then again, Norris could have swept away all the remants and crowned
himself emperor, all of the above is, after all, only my opinion.

of "orders" from the Imperial War Ministry Office of Troop Selection

My character was a 5-term Navy Captain, UPP 6C5798; Blade Cmbt-4, Gunnery-2,

I never heard any more of the GDW promotion; does anyone know what they had in

Here\'s the xmail library entry from the Traveller Adventure, written 
by Marc Miller.

xmail:  Messages sent by xboat.  Xmail carries information only;  
material objects may not be sent.  The message is digitally coded;  
xmail costs Cr10 per 20 kilobits  per parsec.  The message may be 
sent using a standard Anglic character set (about Cr10 for a 500 word 
message) or a picture may be reproduced in facsimile (Cr20 for a 
200x200 bit matrix).  The message is printed out at its destination 
and delivered by a world\'s local mail system.

Hope this helps.

                                        T4 HOUSE RULES:  ZERO-G OPERATIONS



I.  GENERAL NOTES.
 1.  These rules are intended to provide game mechanics for zero
 gravity conditions.

 2.  In an age of artificial gravity and other high-tech environmental
 manipulation, zero-G operations force Travellers to cope with the same unique conditions
  which complicated the earliest ventures into space.  A highly
  specialized set of reactions 	 must be carefully learned in order to
  accomplish the most basic tasks of movement, combat, and other
  activities undertaken in the absence of gravity.	

 3.  Skills normally associated with zero-G operations are:

  Battle Dress		The ability to operate specially armed vacuum suits 	
  (Dex)		designed specifically for combat, including all of the 	
      		sensors and weaponry built into such a suit.

  Individuals with Vac Suit expertise are also considered to have
  expertise in Battle Dress.  However, a number of highly
  sophisticated weapon systems are designed for use specifically and
  exclusively with battle dress, and only Battle Dress expertise 	
  allows use of the weapon systems without danger of damage to the
  system.  Rules governing Vac Suit substitution for Battle Dress
  are presented below. 

  This skill is based on Dex, since highly dexterous characters are
  best able to maneuver the suit and ready its weaponry to bear
  during combat.


  Environment Combat	The training to fight in unusual environments ranging 	 
(Dex, Int, End)	from zero to high gravity, and from vacuum to undersea.  
      
Without this skill, it is difficult to maintain position and 	
      orientation, and to wield weapons to best effect.  In low 	
      gravity, for instance, an unskilled character may fail to 	
      brace against the recoil of firearm, and consequently 	
      spin out of control.  In high gravity, he might injure 	
      himself by failing to place his weight correctly when 	
      moving.  In vacuum, he might pierce his own vac suit 	
      with his weapon, or be hampered by the fear of piercing 	
      his suit.  In liquid environments, he won\'t know how best 
      to deliver blow in close combat.

  This skill improves a combatant\'s ability to compensate for any such
  disorientation.  During combat in these or other unusual
  environments, the referee may ask players to make an Environment
  Combat skill roll to see how well their characters adapt to the
  situation.  Or he may require them to use the skill in place of some
  other combat skill.

  Dex is often the base characteristic for this skill, especially when
  quick reactions are important.  If a character has time to plan
  before making an attack or maneuver, Int may be used instead. 
  Occasionally, End can be used with this skill to combat exhaustion
  from fighting in unusual environments.


  Vac Suit		The training and experience in the use of the standard 	
  (Dex)		vacuum suit, including special suits for use on various 	
      		planetary surfaces in the presence of exotic, corrosive, 	
      		or insidious atmospheres.  With this skill, a character 	
      		can adequately gauge the amount of air and power 	
      		remaining to a suit, don it, check its seals, and 		
      		maneuver about in it without causing a tear in the fabric.

  Non-breathable atmospheres or hostile environments can be easily
  overcome with protective equipment, but the danger of minor
  mishaps becoming fatal remains great.  A roll may be needed to
  avoid danger when attempting any unusual maneuver while wearing a
  vac suit (including running, jumping, hiding, leaping untethered
  from one ship to another, etc.).

  This skill confers the ability to wear and conduct various
  activities in the many specialized suits designed for hostile
  environments.  Such suits include the standard vacuum suit, combat
  armor, atmospheric re-entry suits, environment suits, and powered
  battle dress, as well as suits intended for use in high pressure 		
  environments, such as high pressure atmospheres and beneath oceans. 
  The skill can be used as the Battle Dress skill (see that skill
  for details).  

  Dex is the primary base for Vac Suit skill.


  Zero-G Combat		The individual has been trained to fight in a zero-G
 (Dex)			environment.

  Dex is the primary base for Zero-G Combat skill.


  Zero-G Environment	The individual has been trained to work in a zero-G 	 
(Dex)		environment.  When any action is attempted in the 	
      		absence of gravity, problems of recoil and inertia can 	
      		handicap or render helpless individuals not trained to 	
      		compensate for it.

  Dex is the primary base for Zero-G Environment skill.


  Zero-G Weapons	The individual is trained in the use of accelerator rifles 	 
(Dex)		and snub pistols.

  Dex is the primary base for Zero-G Weapons skill.

 4.  Battle Dress Mishaps.  Each time a weapon (or peripheral piece of
 equipment is used) is fired, like a PGMP or FGMP, is fired by an individual with
  no Battle Dress skill, roll 7- to avoid a mishap.  Use a DM of -2
  for every level of Vac Suit skill over 1.  This is not necessary
  if the character has another skill, like High Energy Weapons, to
  govern the use of these weapons.

  If this roll fails, a mishap has occurred.  Roll one die on this
  table.

  Die	Effect								
  1	Roll Dex or less or be knocked down by the weapon\'s recoil.  If the 	
    	character is knocked down, he looses his next action, and then may
    	 stand up.  

  2	Automatic knock down

  3	The individual has suffered injuries (2 D6 damage points) to his
  	right (or left) shoulder resulting in a sprained and bruised shoulder (with
    	Dex -1 D6).

  4	The individual has suffered injuries (3 D6 damage points) to his
  	right (or left) shoulder rendering it useless (50% chance) or Dex is reduced
    	by 2 D6 (50% chance) until proper medical treatment is received.
     	These injuries would consist of numerous torn ligaments and
    	muscles as well as a broken collar bone, etc.    		

  5	The individual has suffered injuries (3 D6 damage points) to both
  	the right (or left) shoulder and upper chest.  Dex is reduced by 2 D6.

  6	The individual has suffered critical injury to the chest (4 D6
  	damage points) and right (or left) shoulder.  Dex is reduced by 2 D6. 



II.  ZERO-G MOVEMENT.
 1.  Movement in zero-G can be disorienting.  Newton\'s laws are most
 vividly apparent in the absence of a gravitational field, throwing off the normal
  reactions of a person accustomed to the constant presence of
  gravity.

  Movement in zero-G is particularly tricky.  It is possible to propel
  oneself in a given direction with a virtually unlimited range
  being achieved with a minimum effort.  However, two problems crop
  up;  first, once a character is committed to an action, it is very
  difficult to stop it;  second, control can prove difficult to
  maintain.

  When an individual commits to movement in zero-G, that movement will
  continue until the character can apply an equal, opposite thrust
  to counteract it.  This means that a character without a
  propulsion system or a tether line must continue a jump until it
  is possible to grab a passing handhold or use an obstacle to stop
  the movement.  This is one of the factors which make zero-G
  operations dangerous.  A propulsion unit which runs out of fuel
  before the character has completed an attempt to cancel out movement
  can lead to disaster.

  Control over movements in another important consideration.  A
  mis-timed or mis-applied jump can cause a character to miss a
  target by a considerable distance, especially when the target is
  at long range.

 2.  Procedures for Zero-G Movement.  Each time a character attempts to
 move in zero-G conditions, determine all the applicable factors in the
  movement from the zero-G activities chart below.  To stay in
  control of the movement, the character needs to make a saving
  throw of 10+, applying all modifiers shown on the chart.  

  This throw must be made for each change in vector made by the
  character.  Thus, for a simple move from one point to another, the
  character rolls first to stay in control of the initial move.  He
  must roll a second time to check the motion at his destination.

  If the character loses control by failing either of these two die
  throws, he will miss the target.  This will require the character to
  catch himself and attempt the maneuver all over again.  Catching
  himself would be another 10+ throw.  Inexperienced or unlucky
  characters can rapidly end up in enormous difficulty.

 3.  Orientation.  The zero-G activities chart uses "forward",
 "sideways", and "backward" as designations.  In space, this doesn\'t really apply;  the usage
  refers strictly to the character\'s orientation and movement.  A
  forward motion is made in the direction the character is currently
  facing.  A backward motion is the opposite of this.  Sideways is any
  other direction.  This usually comes into effect only in situations
  where the character is reacting to danger;  under ordinary
  circumstances there is time to achieve the forward orientation.

 4.  Speed.  Speed, in the chart, is given in normal Traveller speed
 categories.  S1 is walking speed of about 10-15 meters per round.  S2 is running speed
  of about 30 meters per round.  

  The speed chosen to use with the chart should be the character\'s
  constant speed until a change in vector occurs.  It is possible to
  build up a great speed using a propulsion unit;  all this speed
  must be checked before the character can come to a stop.  

 5.  Magnetic Grips.  Characters working on a starship hull or interior
 in zero-G can wear magnetic boot and glove attachments which grip the metal
  surface.  While using grips, the chance of losing control is
  greatly reduced, but the character is limited to speed 1, and
  cannot move faster without cutting the grips.

 6.  Encumbrance.  Characters not wearing vac suits and not encumbered
 by excessive loads can gain an advantage in control.  Certain high-tech vac suit
  types also avoid the encumbrance problem.

 7.  Regaining Control.  Once a character has lost control of movement,
 control must be regained before attempts can be made to correct the error.  One
  attempt to regain control is  permitted per combat round (roll the
  standard 10+ throw).  Until control is regained, the character
  cannot change vector, fire a weapon, or perform other tasks.



III.  ZERO-G COMBAT.
 1.  The zero-G chart shows the modifiers applied to the basic chance
 of maintaining control.  The 10+ throw must be performed each combat round, after
  the character undertakes combat activities (at the end of the
  round).  If the character fails the throw, control must be
  regained before further activities may be undertaken.

  Re-orientation roll must be made at the end of each round (or phase
  in AHL) in which a character fired a weapon or engaged in melee
  (either by attacking or defending).  

  If the roll is failed, the character is disoriented.  Drifting
  characters remain drifting, and stationary characters remain
  stationary.  Disoriented characters may not fire, make a melee
  attack, or change their movement.  

 2.  Direct fire notes.  If using a hand hold, and the weapon can be
 fired single-handedly, there is an additional -1 DM applied to hit and Dex
  is reduced by 4 for purposes of determining target number.  Gun
  combat is possible while in free fall.

 3.  Melee notes.  Characters may not make a melee attack if they are
 using a hand hold and a large melee weapon like a broadsword, polearm, bow, etc. 
  All melee damage is reduced to 1/2 damage while in a zero-G
  environment.  Melee is possible while in free fall.  All melee
  attacks while in zero-G are done with at a -2 DM to hit.

 4.  Zero-G/Combat.  Projectile throwing weapons, when fired in zero-G,
 do not lose accuracy with range to the same extent as normal.  Use this chart to
  find the correct difficulty when making to hit throws.

  Actual Range	Difficulty As.
  Contact		Contact
  Very Short		Very Short
  Short		Short
  Medium		Short
  Long		Short
  Very Long		Short

 5.  Vacuum Grenades.  Grenades will not produce concussion in vacuum. 
 If the grenade is in physical contact with a target (not just in the
  primary burst radius), the grenade will provide explosion damage
  (the same as the concussion damage) to the target.

  All fragments from a grenade exploded in vacuum will do 2 D6
  damage--no matter the burst radius.  Although there is no
  concussion, the burst radius of the grenade should still be
  calculated (based on concussion damage as normal) to determine 	
  fragmentation effects.  Although the grenade is not losing force,
  this will simulate the spread of the fragments, and therefore make
  it harder to hit individuals at great distance.



IV.  OTHER ZERO-G ACTIVITIES.
 1.  This general category of "other activities" takes in the entire
 range of work performance in zero-G conditions--prospecting, mining, external ship
  repairs, or whatever.  In any case where characters are working
  outside, the referee should require rolls to maintain control as
  the characters carry out their activities.   Generally, one roll
  is made per activity attempted, though the referee may decide to 	
  check once per combat round for long-term or complicated tasks.

 2.  One handed actions.  The basic 10+ roll must be made to avoid
 losing control.  Activities are usually considered two-handed, but a character may
  take advantage of the one handed DM to the control throw. 
  Attempting activities one handed requires a Dex throw to complete
  on top of the control throw (with the advantageous DM for hand
  holds).  Dex is considered reduced by 4 for this check and
  calculation of target numbers while using the hand hold.

 3.  Dangerous situations.  There is a last ditch saving throw for
 characters in dangerous zero-G situations--but this can only be given if there is
  some way of saving the character or there is another character
  near by that can help.  Roll 7+ with only these DMs:  +2 per level
  of vac suit, -4 if no skill. 



V.  AHL NOTES.
 1.  Use these rules when attempting zero-G activities with the AHL
 Tactical Combat System.  

  Action			Cost	Notes						
  Z-G Mvt (along wall)		4	per sq.
  Z-G Mvt (free fall)		3	3 APs initial cost.  Then 1-2 APs per sq. 
  				See rule p.10 Snapshot.
  Z-G Mvt (walking with grips)	2	per sq.  3 APs required for diagonal
  				movement. 
Regain Control		6	6 APs required before an attempt is
  				made.



VI.  DECOMPRESSION.
 1.  In any situation where internal pressure is lost, explosive
 decompression occurs.  

 2.  Individuals caught in a non-pressurized situation without a vac
 suit, combat armor, battle dress, or some other pressurized suit will take 2 D6
  automatic damage every combat round.  1 D6 of damage is applied
  every phase in AHL.

  The task to apply a patch to a breached vac suit, combat armor, or
  battle dress is a difficult test of the appropriate skill.  For
  instance, Zero-G Environment, Vac Suit, or Battle Dress could all
  be used in this situation.  This task can also be attempted at 	
  zero level with the appropriate skill (if zero level use is
  allowed).  At the player\'s option, a difficult test of Dex
  (halved) or Int (halved) can be used.  This simulates manipulation
  of the patch or keeping one\'s head in a desperate situation.  

  Only one attempt to put the patch on can be made each round, and it
  takes about 6 seconds to locate the patch, pull it from it\'s
  pocket, open the package, prepare the patch, locate the suit\'s
  hole, and apply the patch.  Keep in mind that this is done with
  bulky gloves in a desperate situation, and additional time should be
  added if the patch is not at hand.

  If the task to apply the patch fails, this means that the character
  is fumbling with the patch, trying to get it on the hole.  He may
  try again next round with no penalty.  The same roll is made if one
  character is applying a patch to another character.  It will 	
  probably take additional time for one character to reach the other
  (given that he is not standing beside the injured character).

  Some types of armor have a self seal option, and these may or may
  not be instantaneous.

  Many vacc suits are compartmentalized, so a breach in one section of
  the suit will provide some protection to other parts of the body
  for a short time.  When a breach occurs, apply only 1 D6 of damage
  for 1 D6 rounds, then apply the 2 D6 damage per round thereafter.

 3.  Iris valves, hatches, and other secure doors (normally not
 interior doors) have safety mechanisms which lock them in place when decompression occurs.  If
  there is a pressure differential, then these safety measures must
  be circumvented if the door is to be opened.



VII.  ZERO-G ACTIVITIES CHART.
 1.  The basic throw to maintain/regain control is 10+.  This should be
 made once per round, action, or as applicable.  DMs from each of the three tables
  may over lap--pick all that apply.

Damed right! If the players want to sling around RAM grenades and plasma
bolts, and I want to entertain them, then why the heck not?

Then again, the moral overtones in the RC at least make the characters
_think_ about what they are doing!

The "bright and hopeful" outlook of TNE was, as I\'ve said before, the
perfect anodyne to three-plus years of remitting "darkness" in roleplaying
games. With the RC background\'s low population numbers, an individual\'s
contributions means so much more to the society of which he is a part. PCs
can (and will) have a tremendous impact on the course of Coalition history
- -- and _that_ is as exciting for me to GM as it is for my players to play
in!

The scene for that story hasn\'t even been set yet. Give IG time, until the
M0 sourcebook comes out, to start telling the story. I\'ve hoped that IG
would use it\'s Web page to start laying the groundwork of the story behind
M0. . . but that hasn\'t happened. Has someone been detailed to develop M0
with the same strong and sure hand that Dave Nielsen did with TNE? 

Looking forward to developments, as always . . .

I could refer you to the section in "Starship Troopers" where "cruel

Not so incredible.  The "original article" that I was referring to was
published in July 1981 in Dragon Magazine.  Mine is a modified version of
it, with a few additions and details the original left out (and a few silly
ideas removed).

resurrect my plea for somebody to consider making a computer wargame for 
Traveller.  (I asked about it early this year, but no-one was interested.)

I think it would be great to have a computer wargame based on Fifth Frontier 
War with which we could simulate these "what if" scenarios for the end of 
the Rebellion, as well as any of the other interesting wars in Imperial 
history.  The playing area would have to be as big as the Imperium itself 
(depending on the scenario) and the game would have to allow players to edit 
and make their own units and scenarios.  I enjoyed the FFW game a lot, but I 
don\'t get any chances to play it anymore.  There aren\'t many games like this 
out there, so if Marc wanted he could soup up this concept enough to sell to 
the general public (and therefore promote interest in T4 of course).

The game could also include library data for the scenarios, pictures, and 
whatever neat graphics (videos etc.) that the software company/individual 
had the resources to make.

It would also be great to have computerized versions of Brilliant 
Lances/Battle Rider (or the T4 equivalent).  That would be really useful to 
people like me who don\'t have the time, space, and perseverance necessary to 
play the games as they are now (paper mode), especially with play by e-mail 
Traveller campaigns or with players who do not come from a wargaming 
background (and thus do not appreciate the detail and intricacy that makes 
these games last so long).  What do you all think?

Has anyone worked out the ranges of the Nuclear Dampers in FFS (and by
default T4), I probably could, but am too lazy.

Also, in the TNE adventure \'The Guilded Lily\', one of the ways of
stopping a starship from harming a starport was to aim nuclear dampers
at it\'s powerplant and shut it down. This makes a lot of sense, since
dampers affect the forces involved in nuclear reactions.

It occurs to me that this could be quite a powerful weapon. If you want
to keep a ship intact, and board it, shut down it\'s powerplant with your
nuclear dampers (and hope it doesn\'t have missiles).
Piracy is now a much more viable option. Since civilian ships don\'t seem
to have missiles in T4.
The Imperium now also has a MASSIVE advantage.

He was an idiot (or careless, or just unlucky - either way, it\'s a capital 
offence). Ignoring the fact that I don\'t agree that Strephon was a bad 
Emperor, if you try a stunt like that, you have to be 100% successful, or 
at least have enough backup (political as well as military) to deal with 
the situation if anything goes wrong. Otherwise, you\'re almost guaranteed 
to make things 1000 times worse. Dulinor failed on all counts: he didn\'t 
kill all heirs (hell, he didn\'t even kill the right Strephon!); he didn\'t 
have enough forces to hold even the Palace, let alone the planet; and he 
didn\'t have enough friends in the Moot to provide support.

Well, in defense of Dulinor (and I\'ll ignore the issue of Strephon\'s 
suitability for leadership too)

He certainly fell in the VERY unlucky category. If I remember correctly 
(and I may not, its been a long time since I read the Rebellion Sourcebook) 
Dulinor\'s troops on Capitol were only just discovered by a complete fluke, 
and Lucan only just barely survived. Dulinor\'s original plan was NOT to 
flee back to Dlan after killing Strephon.

Dulinor\'s original plan for the coup would have worked out quite nicely, 
with a minimal disruption to the Imperium. When it didn\'t, he relied on his 
Plan B - unfortunately that was The Rebellion

And for all the talk of alternate Rebellion endings, everyone should 
remember that if not for the Virus, all indications were that Dulinor would 
have "won" the Rebellion (although talk about pyhrric victories...). My 
personal conjecture on that topic is:


	Dulinor\'s Coronation fleet FINALLY takes Capitol, and kills Lucan. Dulinor 
promptly declares the Rebellion over (ignoring Margaret, Vland, Daibei et 
al), and tries to start rebuilding the Empire he controls (Ilelish, 
Zarushagar, Dagudashaag, Core, Gushmege) according to his original theories 
of more democracy.

	One of his first acts is to open negotiations with the Solomani, who have 
been bogged down for years. He gives them Solomani Rim and Old Expanses, 
and formally recognizes the Solomani Confederation in exchange for a true 
peace.

	Dulinor then opens trade negotiations with Vland and Margaret, both of 
whom are more interested in trade than war anyways. He leaves Daibei alone 
as a buffer with the Aslan (since the Aslan probably wouldn\'t abide by a 
Peace of Ftahlar with Dulinor as one of the signatories).

	Lastly, he sends the remnants of his fleets to stop any further Vargr and 
K\'kree incursions (although he can\'t take back any territory).

	And presumably after his reforms successfully take hold, in future 
generations the Reformed Imperium will be politically and economically 
strong enough for Dulinor\'s heirs to re-integrate the wayward pieces.

p.s. is there anyone who believes that democratic reforms in the Third

You know what they say - if you want something done, you have to do it 
yourself. So crack open a book on BASIC (or better yet, C/C++ or even Java) 
and give it a try yourself if you really want to.

I seem to remember reading that GDW had released, or planned to release, a 
board game based on the 5th Interstellar War. Does such a thing exist (and 
if so, does anyone know where I could get a copy)?

Oh dear, I hope not. If Sylea and Ordun is under that kind of pressure then
they are in deep, deep ordure.

The problem is that the economics of "exporting" people are such that they
can\'t possible relieve population pressure unless the people are sent to a
world fairly close to the home world.

As far as I can see, there are three ways for a settler to get to another
world:

The first is travelling on ships that are already going the same way,  ie.
trade  ships.  This is a relatively cheap way to travel if one is going by 
low berth.  The cost is Cr1000 per person per parsec.  Note, however, that 
the  cost of any supplies needed at the other end is not included in this.  
Note also that this method is limited by the availability of passenger
space.

The  second way is to build a dedicated people transportation ship and use
that  to  "export"  settlers to another world.  If the ship returns to the
home  world  and  collect a new batch of emigrants as soon as the previous 
one  has  been  delivered,  the  cost per settler can be quite low.  For a 
jump-1  ship going to a world one parsec away the cost will be about Cr750 
per  settler  (even  less  if  drop  tanks can be used at both ends of the 
jump, but drop tanks are not invented until late in the 11th Century). The 
price rises the longer the target world is away,  slightly if it can still 
be reached in one jump, drastically if it is several jumps away.  (In none 
of  these  cases  are the cost of supplies and the transportation of those 
supplies accounted for).  The  drawback to this type of transportation is 
that it requires a large initial investment for the ship and also a steady 
supply of a large number of emigrants to be worth it (A single 5000T 
Jump-1 transport  (QSDS design),  for example,  can carry 80,000 emigrants  
per year). Note that in the beginning such ships will be running empty on 
the return trip, but once the colony is established and begins to produce 
raw materials,  some of the cost can be offset by carrying them back the 
other way.  As the colony grows, ships will begin to carry manufactured 
goods out from the home world too, so Type 2 colonization will often turn 
into Type 1 in time.

Now, if Sylea or Ordun want to actually transport some of their people to 
some place in, say, a neighbouring sector, they have to go something like 
20+ parsecs. I used the QSDS to design a 5000 T Jump-3 colony ship capable 
of carrying 680 colonists in low berths plus their supplies (1.5 T per
colonist) which cost roughly MCr450. Assuming an average time for a jump 
of slightly more than 8 days, a ship can make 3 round trips per year and 
deliver 2040 emigrants. 

Assuming the world uses 10% of its naval taxes on transportation, such a 
ship takes the taxes of 900,000 people to support. This comes to 0.22 
percent of the population per year (But note that the cost of the supplies
are not accounted for in this figure). As you begin to ship your people
farther out the percentage drops further. Eventually the emigration turns
into the third type, which consists of building a colony ship and sending 
it off into the wild blue yonder with a single load of settlers. This type 
of colonization is by far the most expensive; the colony ship mentioned
above comes to roughly Cr660,000 per colonist. Once you\'ve accounted for 
weapons (or armed escorts) the ship will cost more and carry less.  
A typical Aslan _ihatei_ squadron, for example, consisting  of  two IHATEI 
Class transports and two WEAKHTO Class cruisers (plus two scout ships not
accounted for in the price), will cost MCr45,900 and carry 20,000 colonists 
and 760 crew, which comes to MCr2.2 per individual  (Megatraveller design and 
prices;  things will propably have changed somewhat with T4, but I haven\'t
done the calculations).

[Note  that  the price of such a squadron is equivalent to the naval taxes 
 of  91.8 million Aslans.  Assuming that a typical Aslan clan will use 90% 
 of  its  naval budget on defending the clan holding and 10% on outfitting 
 its  _ihatei_,  a  clan  can outfit one squadron per year per 100 million 
 members. This would account for 0.02% of the population per year...]

GDW released three strategic-level Traveller-based wargames.  they are:
1) _Imperium_:  Actually predates Traveller by a year, later reissued with an 
Imperial backgound history booklet.  Terran Confederation versus the First 
Imperium.

2) _Dark Nebula_: Modified _Imperium_ system.  Don\'t remember the combatants. 

3) _Fifth Frontier War_: Very heavily modified _Imperium_ system, about the 
(oddly enough <grin>) Fifth Frontier War.

My guess is that you are remembering an announcement regarding FFW.

The Solomani are divided among themselves. There is a large faction that
consider the Solomani Sphere the "natural" limit of the Solomani
Confederation and will not support agression outside it. There are also
various rivalries between member states.

Any scenario that has Norriss saving the Imperium _has_ to assume the
benevolence of the Zhodani. That is a bit iffy, but the Zhos appear to
have their own problems (they have been "consolidating" for 2000 years!)
and even a reunited Imperium will be unable to threaten them for centuries
to come. So perhaps they will leave Norris alone. And without them the
Sword Worlds are no threat at all.

>bits.

The Aslans and the Vargr are both much less of a threat than Megatraveller
implies. A lot of the stuff they are said to have done (like invading Tobia
and Glisten) is just plain impossible given the information we have about
their size, strength and technology. Actually, just the reserve fleets
are more than enough to deal with them.

The big problem is hooking up with Strephon and getting the Vilani to join
them. The Vargr argument cuts both ways: if they are not nearly the threat
they are portrayed as then they are not enough of a nuisance to the Vilani
to make them need Norris\' help either. It would propably at the very least
cost the establishment of a "Vilani Autonomous Region".

Your\'re wrong there, Harold. The worst case scenario is that the attempt to
restore the Imperium provokes the Zhodani into taking over the Domain of
Deneb. If they don\'t (and it\'s not a foregone conclusion that they will
(Norris\' problem here is that it\'s a strong possibility, so strong that
it is perfectly within his character not to run the risk, but in an
alternate world his sense of duty to Strephon might make him run it
(perhaps an unmistakably genuine order from Strephon could get him going)))
then the Aslans and the Vargr can be dealt with by the reserve fleets while
the regular forces goes a-battling.

Wether they would do any good at all is quite another matter. I think you\'d
need at least three factions cooperating before they\'d have a chance. If
Strephon had started out by going to see first Brzzk and then Margaret 
personally and convinced them that he was genuine, then gone to the Vilani
and sent for Norris\' forces then he might have been able to pull it off.

...although these *are* rough figures.  TL 13 isn\'t projected until 300,
but I\'ve seen some TL 13 items available at Dawn in T4 (Imperial-issue
body pistols, and I think some off-world NAS gear).  Of course, all tech

very very rare.  I expect that we\'ll be hearing some better answers as
the period supplements roll out and define the current official version

<A kinder, gentler rant follows>
No pissing contest here.  I agree with everything you said in the above
quotes 100 percent.  I did enjoy reading all of the TNE stuff.  It was an
entertaining drama, I just didn\'t like to play it.  It wasn\'t "Traveller-ish"
enough for me.  I found the rules set to be too concerned with issues of
combat, and too dark overall.  That\'s really the cornerstone of my (albeit
significant) problems with TNE.  There seemed to be no way to build a new
future without "Hot Recovery Operations," and "Smash \'n\' Grab" tactics.  I
played a campaign in a pocket empire and enjoyed it somewhat, but not near as
much as I had enjoyed my CT campaigns.  It seemed that expansion was limited,
if you chose to "obey" canon, due to the fact that you were bound to bump
into the RC or (even worse) Vampires.  The whole Vampire Fleet idea didn\'t
strike me as something that made travelling wise, and low tech levels made it
difficult to find a ship.  I have long believed that too many campaigns
revolved around jumping from world to world, without exploring the depth that
a single world has to offer (Star Wars Syndrome), but, the fear of
virus-infected ships lurking in every system took much of the wonder and
excitement out of emerging from J-space to find a new world to experience.
 Not to mention the effects the Final War may have had on that world.  It
seemed to me GDW was trying to incorporate something of the horror element
from Dark Conspiracy that was (IIRC) fairly successful for them.  As for the
Regency, well, it ain\'t the Marches, my friend.  Disenfranchised young nobles
who engange in violent or "depraved" acts while "cheating death," (Ghouls
from the Regency Sourcebook) doesn\'t sound like your father\'s Traveller.
 Maybe I\'m just nostalgic.  I hear that happens at a certain age.

For what it\'s worth, I didn\'t much care for the "Rebellion" much, either.  A
little derivative, and a very arbitrary way of cleaning up some of the
stagnation in CT (which certainly existed in several campaigns with which I
was involved.)  Please do not misinterpret my earlier post as an indictment
of the story of TNE (or those who enjoyed it; hey, it\'s only a game); I\'m
dying to know what happened behind the "Black Curtain,"  what the deal is
with the Empress Wave, how the Regency and the RC will get along when they
meet (not well, I imagine), as well as a host of other issues.  I just didn\'t
like it as a game.

If you were trying this Class 3 scheme, wouldn\'t you use old obsolete
ships, ones that had been fully paid for and just need to be upkept. 
That would lower the cost considerably.  It would be rather silly to
build a ship for a single journey.

Also, don\'t forget Invasion: Earth.  It featured the final battle of the
Solomani Rim War as a wargame.  It included a book of information on how to
base a campaign on Terra, particularly during the war years.  Cool!  Remember
thought that that war was fought nearly 100 years before the CT Era.  (c.

In other words, there\'s a big difference between the historical Terran experience in 
transporting colonists (willing or not) -- that being the difference between sea 
transportation (relatively cheap in historical times) and space transportation 
(definitely uncheap in Trav).

Thanks for your learned prespective on this, Hans.

The answer is:  "it depends."  Or, rather, it depends on the damper.  
Since I don\'t have FF&S (or the BL "Technical Supplement") in front of 
me, I\'m just guessing here, but here goes:  Shipboard dampers have an 
effective range of one space combat hex (30,000 km).  At that range they 
can tweak with the strong nuclear force enough to disable (or cause the 
premature decay of) fission and fusion warheads.

That was one heck of a lot closer than 30,000 km.

Staying away.  It occurs to me that the amount of strong nuclear force 
\'tickling\' that a space combat nuclear damper can put out at its extreme 
operating range, while just enough to monkey-wrench a nuclear warhead, is 
hardly sufficient for snuffing the fire of a fusion power plant.  
However, "the Gilded Lilly" offers the possibility that, if the distance 
between ships is a whole lot less, one could at least wreak enough havoc 
to cause an opponent\'s fusion plant to perform a safety shutdown.

"Keptin, we were gettin\' some verry strange fluctuations from th\' fusion 
 plant before she shut down...  I kinna start \'er back up in time!"

In my campaign, this minimum distance is very, very close-- a lot closer 
than ships typically get in combat.  In the absence of any \'canonical\' 
(there\'s that cuss-word again) statement of the conditions required to 
\'damper snuff\' a fusion plant, it\'s up to the referees to decide, I guess.

  VISA\'s own rules state that a merchant cannot charge the buyer\'s account

Otherwise, a merchant could very well ship a product only to find out later

Well, the idea was to give it that "aged" look.  They wanted them to look 
like artifacts dug up from an Ancient site.  I guess the effect didn\'t 
come of as well as they\'d intended.

I\'ve got a really dumb question, but it\'s been bugging me for about a 
dozen years now (I was just reminded of it last night as I was re-reading 
Belters), so I thought I\'d throw it out to you:

In a lot of the later CT products, the Traveller basic rules versions 
are listed (i.e., "This requires one of the Traveller rules sets.  These 
include...").  They list Deluxe Traveller (I know what that is - it says 
it right on the box), The Traveller Book (no problem there), and Starter 
Traveller (again, it says "Starter Edition" right on the box).  

The question comes when they list a fourth version: "Basic Traveller" - 
to what are they referring?  Which version of the Traveller rules was 
"Basic Traveler?"  

Was it the three little black books (the products that list these 
four are all from the era when TTB and the two-book (Rules, Forms & 
Charts) verson were dominant)?  I don\'t believe I\'ve seen a boxed set of 
the three black books that is designated "basic traveller."  Was there a 
third boxed set that I don\'t know about?  Or was this just something used 
internally at GDW, but not on an actual product box?


Thanks in advance for any info,

I must have misinterpreted what Dulinor was doing, I thought he was
after  having a greater control over local governments. I didn\'t think
it had anything to do with democratic reform.

(A very bad idea, how do you run a democracy in something the size of
the Imperium? Long live the Nobility!!!)

   Given the choice of watching the Spinward Marches collapse into total
chaos or helping Norris, the regional Zhodani leadership would have probably
opted to send warships to assist Norris.  This would have brought them into
direct conflict with the Aslan and the Vargr, and would likely result in a
long term military occupation of much of the Spinward Marches by the Zhodani
Consulate--that occupation would likely become permanent after it becomes
apparent that the Imperium is dead.

   I realize it may be difficult to imagine Sword World, Darrian, Imperial
and Zhodani warships fighting side-by-side, but with one human empire gone
and another experiencing severe trouble, suddenly those political differences
that were so devisive before suddenly seem less important with the existence
of human civilization in the balance.

>In addition, the Zhos seemed to be in some sort of mess by 1120, 
>with warships fleeing something in Zho space (see Survival Margin)

   Thus the regional Zhodani leadership has an ulterior motive for
intervening on Norris\' behalf.  By absorbing the non-psionic dependent former
Imperial colonies, they hope to add to their own stability.  Administrators
from the Marches can take over in areas affected by the Empress Wave, in much
the same way that Christians and Jews were recruited to run large portions of
the Ottoman Empire.

Harold

You\'d have to have some kind of representative democracy where
representatives were elected (planet-wide, perhaps?) and sent to
some legislative body.  Kind of like the U.S., where senators
can, in theory, be appointed or whatever.  It\'d be hard to have
a popularly elected president, though...

A system like that could work just fine, though the central
government would probably end up being weaker...

No, there was not a basic Traveller designation on the box, but the 
reference is to the little black books.

Here is a tactical combat system that I\'ve put together from the 
rules in Azhanti High Lightning and Snapshot.  As usual, I threw in 
some of my own twists and adapted the game to T4, but little 
conversion was needed.

So, if any of you can still find large grid paper on which to draw 
you deckplans and building maps, and you still have some counters or 
minitures, here is a set of tactical combat rules that you might me 
interested.

Even if you don\'t play tactical combat in your Traveller games (I 
have a mix of free form and tactical combat situations), you can use 
these rules to figure out how long it takes somebody to do something 
based on the rules present here.

Many of the "Special Rules" listed in the back of the MT Player\'s 
Manual were taken from these rules.  If you\'ve never used a tactical 
combat system before, it\'s easy.  Simply decide how many action 
points a character gets per round (note that these rounds are half 
the usual 6 second combat round).  In a tactical system, you are 
accounting for every action a character makes during the combat phase 
(unlike the regular free form system where characters are only 
allowed one attack per round).  The free form system allows average 
actions.  In the tactical system, you can attack several times in 3 
or 6 seconds depending on how many APs you have to spend (action 
points).

After you know how many APs a character gets for the phase, simply 
ask the player what he wants to do.  Each action will have a cost.  
Look this up on the chart below.  When the character runs out of APs, 
he can do no further actions that phase.

This tactical combat system uses 1/2 inch squares representing 1.5 
meters.  I use the 1/2 inch square die cut counters that came with my 
Snapshot set, but you can by blanks at the store or make your own.  
You can even use minitures if you want.

Kenneth.



TRAVELLER AHL Tactical Combat System


1.  How many action points do I get?  Calculation is:
   (Str + Dex + End + Int) / 5	(round up)

   This is the most APs a character can spend in an action phase.
   The cost of actions can be split between phases.

2.  Initiative?  When it doesn\'t matter, highest AP total goes first. 
When it matters, roll initiative as normal at the start of every
phase.

3.  Phase Sequence.			
	1.  Cover Fire		Each phase is 3 sec.
      	2.  Movement		
      	3.  Melee
      	4.  Aimed Fire
      	5.  Snapshots
      	6.  Throw

			It takes 6 phases before the lock can be entered.  6 APs, 	
      			in addition to the original cost, must be spent to close 	
      			the door.  The door is considered closed at the 		
      			beginning of the next phase after these APs are spent.  	
      			Another 6 phases are needed before the door can be 	
      			opened, and then another 6 APs are needed to open the 
      			door--which is opened at the start of the following phase.
Special situations	?	See this rule pg. 6 AHL.
Jump down 1 level	2	See this rule pg. 7 AHL.  2 APs are needed to

Sneaking		?	Triple cost of actions.  See rule pg. 6 Snapshot.

Z-G Mvt (along wall)	4	per sq.
Z-G Mvt (free fall)	3	3 APs initial cost.  Then 1-2 APs per sq.  See
			rule pg. 10 Snapshot.
Z-G Mvt (walking with grips)2	per sq.  3 APs required for diagonal
			movement.

5.  How many people to a sq.?  No more than 4 active characters. 
Several inactive characters can be in the sq.

6.  How many active characters to a side in a sq.?  No more than 2
characters can fire through the same side of a sq.

7.  Enter an enemy sq.?  Must cease all mvt. for the remainder of the
phase.

8.  Minimum mvt.?  A character may always enter any adjacent
accessible sq. at a cost of 6 APs, even if the normal cost to enter
that sq. is greater than 6 APs.

9.  Covering Fire allows an immediate attack at no additional cost
against any who move through the area covered.

10.  Field of Fire.  This is indicated on pg. 9 AHL.

11.  Range.  Count squares at 1.5 meters through the center.  Count
diagonal squares as 2.25 meters.

12.  Adjacency.  Regardless of normal sequencing, a character is
allowed to defend himself.  If an enemy character moves adjacent to a
character during the movement phase, an immediate snapshot is allowed
at the moving character.  To take advantage of adjacency, the
attacking character can not be moving in the movement phase.  The
number of snapshots made is only limited by how many action points the
attacking character has (the first snap attack has a cost of 0, but
the others cost as per normal).

13.  Corners, consoles, close machinery, equipment explosions, and
collateral damage are all covered starting on pg. 12, AHL.

14.  Scatter diagram on pg. 14, AHL.

15.  Melee.  A character can start melee with another character only if
that character is in a front sq. with respect to the attacking
character.  This goes for both sides.  Within a sq., all characters
are considered to be in the front sq.

16.  NPC Morale rules.  These are on pg. 16 of AHL and are listed on
pg. 58 of T4.

17.  Easy rules for damage from vacuum on pg. 19, AHL.  Iris valves and
hatches may not be opened if there is a pressure differential.  Also
see pg. 13, Snapshot.

18.  Darkness and vision impairment.  This rule replaces the one on pg.
57, T4, and it is specifically designed for close quarter combat.  For
darkness or vision impairment, apply a -1 DM for every sq. between
attacker and target.  Use the T4 rule as an upper limit DM.

19.  Structural damage is covered on pg. 19, AHL.

20.  Wall breaches.  See rule pg. 13, Snapshot.

21.  Weapon length effects pg. 13, Snapshot.

22.  Effects of gas and tranq, pg. 13, Snapshot.

This is the Aslan Border Wars.  Solomani versus the Aslan.  I own it,

I own this one too.  Great game.  Full of background detail about the 
war and very integrateble with the role playing game.  They even have 
rules for deciding the war as you play your role playing game.

Do you have a fix for the chirpers\' psionic ability not to be seen when
they don\'t want to be?  See Adventure 2, Research Station Gamma.  It\'s set
on Vanajen/Rhylanor.  Vanejen has a big chirper population, and there is a
fair amount of description.  Alien Realms has a later adventure set on
Vanejen.

Huh?  You are, I think, refering to the introduction of drop tanks by
Tukera & General Products announced in the pre-5FW news items.
However, Drop Tanks had been around longer than that, as they appear
on the TL 14 Close Escort design (the date of which isn\'t entirely
clear, but I would guess pre-Solomani Rim War - ie the 9th Century.) I
don\'t know if there are TL limits on Drop Tanks, but there was never
anything that suggested that the technology was especially difficult
or advanced.  It is just that the economic, strategic, and tactical
advantages are not very clear - ie. no one has bothered to do an
analysis (at least in the Classic Traveller setting) which has lead to
their widespread introduction.  I suspect they only make sense if they
are:

1) Reusable

2) Recovered

3) Readily available at all points on a ship\'s route

Hence, they may well be used by large merchant concerns.  To a large
degree, the military and other Imperial agencies would probably
consider the arrangement too vulnerable for heavy investment.
However, they do provide some vessels with a certain flexibility - the
Close Escort could retain its tanks to manage J-4, and keep with a
fleet, or drop them for J-5 if needed, and then manage J-2 until they
were replaced.  In my MT design, combined with "realistic" thrusters
(see http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~spe/Rules/Special/Thrusters.html), I
think my design could manage J-3 or J-4 without the tanks, so that it
became a relatively long-legged escort, perhaps capable of catching a
fleet, or being used as a reserve courier, or a fast-reaction vessel,
or a number of other possibilities.

Anyway, Drop Tanks are not exclusively 11th Century technology.

I\'ve a black box with the Free Trader Beowulf message on the front. It
included the first 6 little black books (Characters & Combat through
Scouts). It doesn\'t say "basic traveller", but I suspect this might be what
they mean.  It\'s what I\'ve always referred to as Traveller. Anything else

Well, let\'s see. First, you form the Imperial Senate, consisting of two
members from each member planet. You then add members at large for
non-human species and belters. That should get a nice sized unmanageable
mob. You then give them the power to enact legislation with an Imperial
veto possible. Give them the authority to confirm any Imperial appointment
and treaty.

Very important also is that campaign contributions not be controlled at all
and put a ten year term with no limit on the number of terms.

That should about do it. :)

Give it a hundred or so years and you should have an excellent mixture of
backstabbing, revolution, and corruption. PCs should love it.

Easy. There are any number of things that could be set up while a
damper is in effect that will go "boom" when it is turned off. So if do
that to me, I\'ll take you with me.

As an example, take a standard shipping container, place some *simple*
detectors in it, along with a bunch of subcritical masses of
fissionable material, all damped. If an *external* damper field
appears, the subcritical masses are brought together and surrounding
explosive charges armed. The charges will create an implosion to keep
the masses from scattering too soon.

When the external field goes away, then either immediately or after an
interval, the charges fire, and the internal damper switches to
*enhance* nuclear reactions. The result should be a blast that may
reach gigaton yeilds. 

Built a bit differently you\'d get the mother of all neutron bombs. A
radiation burst that\'d be lethal even through starship armor at
thousands of km.

You use the timer method as an anti-pirate measure. They take your
cargo, and after they get clear, the mother of all nukes goes off in
their ship.

As a self destruct, you don\'t use a delay, and you just blow the hell
out of both ships.

Also, there\'s the not so trivial detail that anything that\'ll
discourage fusion reactions will *encourage* fission reactions. So
emergency fission power units could be built that would only work if a
damper was strong enough to almost shut down a fusion plant. Of course,
Traveller ignores the reality of physics when it comes to dampers....

That is a road you really don\'t want to go down.  Yes, it is physically
possible, it would drop the required critical mass, and you could focus
it into the reactor of a starship, and it would go nova, or detonate the
missles early,etc,etc.

BTW, according to the space time metric tensor started by Riemenn, if
you have at least 10 dimensions in our universe, all the forces of
nature fit inot the matrix. You should be able to make an algorithm that
changes the Strong Force using only Electromagnetism.  hmmmmm...........

.....Actually, the Nuclear Strong force when amplified increases BOTH
fusion and fission, and when "damped" decreases BOTH.  Nuclear strong is
the force in ALL Nuclear Reactions.  Fuel Cells would work however, for
backup only, but they use LHyd also, so that would make it easier....

While romantic, its harder than hell to envision a democratic 
government whose communications range a couple of years from border 
to border becoming anything more than pure anarchy.  Perhaps concern 
about basic human rights on a local level would be a nice touch, but 
I can\'t see a democracy in the Western Civilization sense really 
working.

Precisely. According to FF&S, The designer is free to choose the range of
the nuclear damper.  A range of 30,000 km is needed to intercept incoming
missiles. Apparently the damper has only a single range: it\'s either full
effect or none at all.
The limitations are having a beam pointer with a short range equal 
to the range of the damper, and having enough power to operate it:
15 MW per range band at TL-12 (the earliest they are available), decreasing
at higher tech levels.

Indeed. FF&S does mention that "Higher" tech levels are needed to snuff
fusion reactions, but leaves it at that.

You\'re quite right and, in fact, the information we have tells us that Aslan
_ihatei_ does indeed use obsolescent ships. This would increase their number 
by some factor up to 10, but it is a bit tricky to calculate just how much, 
since the ships will have to be build and paid for somehow, so in order for a
ship to be available, the Aslans would have to need it for their clan fleets
in the first place. This is fine for the cruisers, but would a clan need
enough troop transports to furnish all the transports? I\'d guess that at
least some of the transports has to be built from scratch. Secondly, the word
is obsolescent, not obsolete, so the cruisers propably aren\'t 50 years old
(the usual active lifespan I calculate with for a warship; I can\'t remember
if I saw it somwhere or made it up myself). Instead the Aslans may release
their 40 year old cruisers to their _ihatei_ which will mean that the
_ihatei_ budget will have to cover 20% of the price instead of just the
maintenance. Thirdly, the 10% maintenance budget from TCS is an average; I
consider it likely that the newer ships have a lower maintenance figure and
the older a higher maintenance figure than 10%.

Also note that this dosen\'t make the _ihatei_ 10 times as powerful, precisely 
because their ships are old. However, the rules dosen\'t give any negative 
combat modifiers for old age, so it\'s impossible to say just how much weaker 
that makes them. 

>It would be rather silly to build a ship for a single journey.  

Indeed, and that\'s why the ravening _ihatei_ hordes descending on the
defenseless (ha!) Regency are so unrealistic. It would be much more
ECONOMIC for the Aslans to conquer a neighbouring clan and use the ship
to go back and forth carrying MANY _ihatei_ for the same price (And, hey, 
that would also explain the need for all those troop transports mentioned 
above!). 

Or, if treaties with the neighbours prevent that (which would, alas, mean 
that they won\'t need many troop transports), at least fill out the broad
belt of neutral worlds in the Trojan Reaches first, so that the transports 
can go back for more _ihatei_ without worrying about enemy raiders. One of
the things I would do if I was defending the rimward Regency would be to 
target the transports.

That\'s a good point.

I have another: The Imperium really is an organization of _independently
governed_ worlds. Does "democratic reform" on the Imperium\'s level
really affect local world governments? What\'s the point of world UPP\'s
otherwise? The Imperium just governs the "space between the worlds"
n\'est-ce pas?

Some worlds have UPP\'s which indicate a local democratic government,
others are oppressive. If I were an interstellar traveller, I\'d want the
starports to be ruled rather autocratically, with consistant laws and
regulations, to ensure my safety and avoid misunderstandings.

I\'ve thought about these nuclear damper thingies quite a bit, and it
seems to me that, as postulated, they are open to a lot of abuse.

So I came up with a quick fix.

I say (contra canon) that the dampers increase or decrease the strength
of /weak-force/ nuclear interactions (and not of strong-force nuclear
interactions). This allows them still to be used in their original
mission. The heavy nuclei in a warhead\'s fissionables undergo beta decay
and become less neutron rich; when the damper field remits, these nuclei
decay to stable (and harmless) isotopes via alpha decay. The advantage
of this new postulate is that it gets rid of some of the more err...
interesting spin-off technologies that would result from control of the
strong force.

Possible spin-off technologies resulting from weak-force control:

1) Cheap compact neutrino detectors. (Gee, those already exist
in Traveller!)

2) "Reactionless" neutrino rockets. (Gee, we already have reactionless
drives in Travller!)

3) Stable controllable pion beams. (Got \'em already in Traveller.)

4) Meson (and for that matter, neutrino) communicators. (Got \'em
already. Well, the meson ones anyway.)

5) Cheap, small, and long-lasting power sources (Fission Plus!)
which would become possible at, oh, TL12 or so. For that matter, you
could make fusion plus by causing hydrogen to beta "decay" into
neutrons, which would then combine with the ambient hydrogen to form
deuterium and release energy. An easy way to get over the Coulomb
barrier and make a colder sort of fusion.

So, waddaya say? Who votes that that the first reference to dampers in
Book 4 had a typo? ("Strong," when it should have been "weak.") You know
my vote. 8^)

Yes. I\'m not sure if demoncracy (oh, wow! wonderful Freudian slip 
there!) can work with something like the Imperium.

Problems:

1. How do you get 11,000 worlds to agree on how to implement it? (Just 
look at the problems the EU has, and there\'s only 15? of them!)

2. Since most of the worlds are non-democratic, how are they going to 
elect a representative?

3. With a travel time from frontier to Capital of >1yr, just how 
representative is it going to be?

TAS News Brief datelined 097-1105 in JTAS#2:

        "...L-Hyd drop ships have only been in service for the last
        dozen years in the interior,  being made possible by recent
        advances in the field of capacitor engineering..."

The problem with this that their economic, strategic, and tactical
advantages OUGHT to be perfectly clear to anyone who has had a few 
years to consider them. There are some very cute tricks that
can be done with drop tanks. For one thing, drop tanks allow double jumps 
between refuelling, which would make rifts much less of a barrier than they 
seem to have been. For another, drop tanks makes the logistics of 
establishing deep space fuel depots much easier, which would also help with 
the rifts and could be very useful on some trade and X-boat routes (An 
X-boat fuel station in hex 1508 of the Spinward Marches would for example 
cut weeks off the trip from Jewell to Regina). Also, if drop tanks are 
possible there seem no apparent reason why jump projectors (an idea of mine 
where you energize the jump grid from outside the ship and use the 
same grace period that drop tanks use to get the ship away from the jump 
engine, thus saving both the engine and the fuel tankage) shouldn\'t be 
practical (the last bit is assuming that jump engines still works the same 
way in T4 as in Megatraveller, of course). Yet such a device would 
revolutionize cargo transport. So why haven\'t anyone thought of these
and other dodges in the 10,000 years of jump travel?

The answer is that the reason why drop tanks aren\'t used to their full 
potential is that they haven\'t been available for very long! They must 
have been invented some time between 1080 and 1090, and their full 
potential propably hadn\'t been realized by the time the Crash
put a stop to further developement except in the Regency.

>I suspect they only make sense if they are reusable

The version used by Tukera isn\'t, but the ones described under the
Megatraveller rules surely must be. My theory is that the first
generation of improved capacitors dosen\'t allow reuse, but that
second generation capacitors does. I posted a long posting about this
on gdw-beta some weeks ago. If you like, I\'ll send you a copy.

Drop tanks are a god-sent to military agencies. Just ask anyone who\'s
played in one of Steve Higginbotham\'s TCS campaigns.

Oh yes, they are! ;-)

Although Dulinor\'s precise objectives were never gone over in great detail, 
I think it worked both ways - both increased influence by the Imperium in 
individual worlds, and increased influence by Imperial citizens in the 
Imperium.

You know, replace a few of the proper nouns, and you have almost an exact 
quote from present-day Chinese rulers (or in America a few hundred years 
ago, or Britain before that, or France in 1785, or...)

Also worth noting is that everyone in TNE (ie RC, Regency) seems to be very 
much opposed to the nobility. It seems they are agreeing with Dulinor 
without even realizing it!

Well, the Zhodani seem to be able to make it work. Okay sure, their 
franshice is a little bit narrow, the Consulate is a full-fledged democracy

The Solomani Confederation, while not completely a democracy, they are a 
partial. Each world or governmental unit selects representatives (some of 
them are elected) to the Solomani Secretariat.

Obviously the First Republic (successor to the Third Imperium) would be 
quite a bit different than a modern parliamentary democracy, but they could 
work something out.

Point 3: If you put chains on the Chirpers and put a simple electronic

I vote YES there was a typo as described
As a matter of fact the above was IMHO the best entry in any Traveller list
ever! Will incorporate into my camapaign pronto (the neutrino comms I
already have) and will discuss with my physicist player at next session.

This actually isn\'t a problem.  They don\'t need to elect a representative,
they could simply appoint one.  The Imperium is so large that it is
implausible, of not impossible, to monitor "democratic elections" on each of
the 11,000 worlds.  Which brings us to the next problem:

This is something I have wondered about for years.  Given the scale of the
Imperium, forget democratic reforms, how is diplomacy carried out?  Think
about this for a moment.  The Aslan Yerlyaruiwo ambassador is sitting next to
Strephon on the family dias when Dulinor decides to enact his "brilliant"
plan to "save the Imperium."  He gets caught in the crossfire and the Aslan
are understandably ticked off.  Well, ticked off once they hear about it,
approximately 7 *months* later.  (Assuming the message traveled at jump-6, no
less.)  So just how much authority must this, or any, ambassador have had?
 Can you imagine the negotiations?

   Strephon: "Well, we\'d really like the Aslan not to engage in fleet actions
in the Reaver\'s Deep sector."
   Aslan Ambassador: " I think that would be acceptable, I\'ll get back to you
on that in a year-and-a-half."

OK, I\'m exaggerating a bit to make a point, but, do you see the problem?
 I\'ve often felt that the Imperium only worked because the sector archdukes
must have wielded extraordinary power in their domains.  Dulinor, who I feel
was more foolish than evil, should have made sure that the other archdukes
would support him before trying to knock off Strephon.  After all, they\'re
the ones who would have been most responsible for dealing with their
neighbors and maintaining the status quo.  In fact, you would think that the
Aslan ambassador should have been calling on Duke Craig and Duke Norris.
 Especially since they seem to be the only significant leaders referred to
during the so-called Rebellion who appeared to have a clue.  Margaret got
"the trains running on time" (Maggie\'s Farm, anyone?); Brzk, after he got
over his delusions of grandeur, largely kept to himself; Strephon decided he
was more trouble alive than dead (George Bailey Syndrome, just in time for
the holidays);  and Lucan and Dulinor, who seem to be made for each other,
beat the holy hell out of each other, the other factions, the Imperium, etc.,
etc., etc.

Try imposing democracy, representative or otherwise, on this group, and it\'ll
make the Rebellion seem well-managed by comparison.  

No sir.  I don\'t buy it.  The Emperor, and his assassination, should have
made very little difference in the long run.  Core certainly was the
metropole of the empire, but the peripheries (the domains) should have been
stable enough, and important enough in their respective regions, that order
should have been maintained.  OK, the Zhodani thought, "Whoopee!  No more
Imperium!"  (Actually the Solomani probably thought that more than the Zhos.
;) )  Nevertheless, weren\'t several of the Frontier Wars won (ostensibly) by
the Domain of Deneb before orders (and ships and personnel and supplies)
could arrive from Capital?  The Domains could not have been less than the
strength of the Imperium.  Notice that no one Domain (which became the
various factions of the Rebellion) could dominate any one of the others with
any kind of success.  The Solomani couldn\'t even beat a divided Imperium.
 What does that tell you?  I know I am a vocal supporter of Classic Traveller
here on TML, but the likelihood of the war playing out as it did, or even
getting going for that matter, doesn\'t jibe with the picture of the Imperium
as a largely bureaucratic entity with fuedal chains of command centered at
subsector and sector capitals.  

Someone posted the other day that the Imperium was like the Roman Empire, too
big to sustain itself.  I agree, but the Roman Empire disintegrated into a
collection of smaller kingdoms, each concerned with maintaining the status
quo in their particular corner of the world.  I think, if you buy the
rebellion at all, the most likely endgame is similar to MT Hard Times, with
smaller safe areas ruled, or at least maintained, by their traditional
institutions (or those institutions co-opted by new faces)  and some less
friendly space in between them.

Whew, I really got rolling there, didn\'t I?  Let me know what you think.  And
Keep the Flame.

Who says the Imperium (or the Regency) wants that?  Remember, Jewell to
Regina is only two jumps at J-6.  I have always agreed with the notion that
the government would have ways of disseminating information more rapidly than
the civilians can get their hands on it.  Great way of keeping a step ahead
of the locals.  Can you imagine being able to put your spin on a news story
*before it breaks*!  Very useful stuff, indeed.  And who is to say that there
isn\'t a secret base there already?  Got to be some comets or something
floating around out there in deep space for the military to exploit.  In MT
Arrival Vengeance the AHL-class cruiser conducts comet-refueling deep within
the Great Rift.  In fact, I\'ve been curious as to how plausible that is.  Any
astronomer types out there know?  Let me know.

Ey! Dulinor wasn\'t nasty; he did what he genuinely thought was the right thing
for the Imperium as a whole. Unlike Lucan who looked out for No.1 and Margaret
who didn\'t want to go out of business.

This is, IMO, precisely right.  Just take a look at T4\'s introductory 
pages (I don\'t have my copy with me right now, so can\'t site paragraph 
and page) - it says something about individual representatives having 
extraordinary power, because they can\'t consult with the home office.  It 
says also something like, "This results in the home office accepting all 
sorts of wacky agreements" or something like that.


So, I\'d say, yes, the Imperium and the megacorporations operating within 
it are big believers in delegation.  I\'d also say that\'s a good reason 
for honor being an important aspect of life in the Imperium - especially 
for nobles.  Those who are known to be dishonorable will not be given the 
enormous power and responsibility that is available in such positions.  
Thus, if you want to get ahead in the Imperium (and in many megacorps) 
you\'ve got to show yourself to be honorable and loyal.

You know, I thought that the Reagan/Bush team was a horror.  Found them
abhorrent in every opinion and statement.  In 1986, I found myself face to
face with VP Bush, with a loaded M-16A1 in my hands.  So since *I* thought
it was "right", I would have been justified in shooting him?

Dulinor was an assassin, plain and simple.  Remember that he didn\'t just
kill the Strephon clone, he also shot the Empress, the Grand Princess, an
Aslan ambassador, and his agent tried to kill the Twin Princes.  God only
knows how many of Strephon\'s relatives died elsewhere to clear the path to
the Iridium Throne.

Lucan may have started the Black War, but Dulinor took part in the
destruction.  Lucan was a spoiled brat, Dulinor was an experienced Archduke!
For a man claiming to represent "the people", he sure incinerated a lot of them.

The leader I wanted to see come out of the Rebellion intact was Duke Craig
of Daibei.  A calm, competent man who withdrew into his borders and refused
to sentence his people to ruin because two madmen wanted the same shiny chair.

In my Imperium the real power is the subsector Duke.  Each subsector is
unique enough to make anything but the longest range planning impossible for
the Sector and Imperial offices.  The Duke\'s men handle the day-to-day
crisis management, taxes, and defence operations.

That\'s one of the big questions in astronomy right now, IIRC: just how
many cold, dark "brown dwarfs" and similar bodies are lurking out there,
invisible to our current telescopes and search patterns?  For that matter,
how many dim little red dwarfs dot the neighborhood -- they\'re almost as
hard to see!  Free comets and other planetismals are way below current
limits of resolution.

For that matter, Traveller\'s "Great Rift", "Windhorn Rift," et al. are a
bit dodgy under current astronomical knowledge.  The original explanation,
I believe, was that the Great Rift was an extension of the gap between
local spiral arms.  Then somebody realized just how big the galaxy really
is (I believe Goeran Damberg\'s web site has a nice graphic giving the
correct sense of scale), and it was explained as just a "region of low
stellar density."

The monkey-wrench in the whole thing is that even the areas between spiral
arms are not devoid of stars: it\'s just that the hot, bright, but short-
lived O and B stars that highlight the spiral arms don\'t live long enough 
to travel from those areas of star formation into the rest of the galactic
disk.  Remember those hard-to-see red dwarfs?  The "rifts" between spiral
arms are chock-full of \'em: they\'re just much harder to see next to their
more glorious cousins.  There\'s no particular mechanism for clearing such
a wide swath of space.

But it makes for a hell of a fun game, and some neat touches of
background.  ("Behind the claw," anyone? :-)

I *love* this idea, it clears up all sorts of possible problems.  However,
it has one big problem, it is of limited usefulness.  This type of ND
works great against fission warheads.  However, by TL 12 I would expect
there to also be various types of direct fusion warheads which don\'t
require a fission trigger.  Laser pumped fusion, some type of *very*
high-powered, short-term magnetic pinch...  A weak force ND would (as I
understand it with my decade-old knowledge of physics) have no effect on
such warheads. 

So, is there any way to save the weak force damper other than (to me)
unrealistic rulings that non-fission pumped fusion warheads are
impossible.

There\'s some argument about this; some models have the spiral arms being
significant overdensity regions (with more stars of all types, as well as 
all the blue stars), and some have them, as stated above, just being the
regions where star formation happens. Imaging of other galaxies is surprisingly
inconclusive on this matter.

Still, even the most creative density wave model still has plenty of stars
in between the arms. However, since most of these will be late-type stars,
one could argue that late m-dwarfs tend not to have planets or comets or 
oort clouds or anything that could be used for refuelling. (Current planet-d
detection results don\'t rule this possibility out - in fact, there do seem
to be fewer giant planets around m-dwarfs, though Marcy et al haven\'t looked
at as many m-dwarfs as g-stars.) So the "rifts" are full of stars, just
not stars you can refuel at, or find materials to build a base at, or anything
like that.

I agree.  In my campaigns the rifts are the result of the final war of the
Ancients.  The rifts are full of drifting stellar matter (and the
occasional Ancients artifact) left over from thousands of super-novae.

Makes sense to me.  The amount of power available to an individual 
increases as you go up the Imperial heirarchy.  At the same time, the 
amount of time it takes to bring that power to bear also increases as you 
go up the heirarchy.  So, while the subsector dukes don\'t have anywhere 
near as much power as, say an Archduke (let alone the Emporer), they are 
able to apply their power much more swiftly (and therefore, effectively).

Also, of course, as was mentioned before, these "lesser nobles" are going 
to have permission to take action without permission anyway - it\'s a 
necessity.  An emperor who insisted on micromanagement would bring the 
Imperium to its knees - if he wasn\'t assassinated first. ;)

 Somehow, it always looked like "EE-nay gi-VAR", except that I
 sometimes apply some strange (but reasonable) linguistic
 transformations to it.  On at least one world in my campaign,
 it was the "Ih-neh ki-PAR", pronounced as though it were one
 word - Inneckippar.

Thank you! At least I\'m not alone in thinking Dulinor was not either a complete imbecile or the devil incarnate.

While I\'m not sure I totally agree with his actions, what he did was:

A: motivated by the best of intentions (yeah, I know - the road to hell...)
B: in reaction to some very real and serous problems in the Imperium
C: even (somewhat) legal under Imperial law!

       Not quite: I was thinking of negating the force that holds atomic
nuclei together; so that the particles that make up the nucleus go flying
off, splitting neighbouring nuclei, which go on to split their neighbours,
and so on...  Basically, you aim, fire, and get a fission
explosion...atlhough if the same range limitations that apply to dampers
also apply to "enhancers", triggering massive nuclear explosions (like a
fission explosion with the whole of the target ship\'s mass as fissile
material) at close range might not be a good idea :).  Even if you don\'t
get a big boom, you\'d still get mondo radiation...

        Another alternative weapons system: if it\'s possible to manipulate
gravity, why not use it as a weapon: say simply hit the target with a
massive boosted g-field over a small portion of its surface... so that you
yank out or push through a core section of the ship...  or alternatively ,
just stress the hell out of it causing structural damage.

        What about rapidly alternating tractor/repulsor beams (Ok, ok, so I
ripped that one off from SFB: let\'em sue me).

Unfortunately, as I read Dulinor\'s plans, he did want the Imperium to 
interfere more in the internal affairs of individual worlds to promote 
greater democracy - indeed, he got into trouble in the Federation of 
Ilelish when he didn\'t do this.

Of course, Tim\'s answer is exactly how the Solomani Confederation 
Secretariat works - the various member states select their representatives 
in whatever method works for them (the democracies elect them, the 
dictatorships appoint them, etc.)

Oh, how soon we forget. Humanity certainly hasn\'t had instantaneous 
communications for all that long.

In some ways, the best historical example to the Imperium may be the 
British Empire. Remember, several parts of it were months away from London.

While I\'m a history buff, I haven\'t studied in any exacting detail. But my 
impression is that yes, local governors/military generals/ ambassadors had 
some broad outlines of policy set by London, but other than that were given 
a great deal of latitude.

Well, it SHOULDN\'T have made such a big difference. Remember the Imperial 
Civil Wars didn\'t make any big difference - the bueraucracy kept going 
about its business the same as before.

The problem was is that the combatants early on decided to make this a 
total war. They didn\'t just attack each others fleets - they attacked each 
others worlds, and citizens, and shipping. Instead of just the I.N. picking 
sides, EVERYONE picked sides.

This is probably true to a certain extent, but even the Sector Duke would 
be months away from a lot of the action.

There is no one real power in the Imperium.



Allright, since no one seems to believe a democratic Imperium could work 
(and everyone has ignored my example of the Zhodani consulate), here is one 
possibility, given only for the purpose of discussion:

Every world has some sort of world ruling council. This is easy enough to 
imagine.

Each world elects several representatives to a subsector-sized ruling 
council. These representatives home worlds would be one or two months 
travel away from the seat of government, allowing them to get back and 
touch base one a year or so.

Each subsector council then elects a representative to the Imperial 
Parliament. This could be for something like a 10 year period. The election 
would probably occur up to 2 years before the old representative\'s term is 
up, to give the new representative time enough to travel to Capitol. Once 
there, the representative would a great deal a latitude in his actions, but 
anyone elected to this position is going to be powerful enough, and 
responsible enough, not to go completely off the deep end.

And of course, the Imperial Parliament has very, very limited range of 
powers. Probably have authority over the I.N., foreign relations, 
interstellar trade and commerce, etc.

What about the Zhodani Consulate ? Their interstellar government IS a 
democracy and it seems to work just fine for them. (AM 4 Zhodani pg11) 
"The Zhodani Consulate is a democracy. Representatives (called consuls) 
are elected to ruling councils for a specific peeriod of time,with those 
councils responsible for specific responsibilities within the 
government....Each of the lowest councils elects two of its members to 
the next highest council...A hierarchy of councils extends all the way 
frim the local community council to the Supreme Council responsible for 
ultimately shaping Consulate policy."
	It is true that the Zhodani limit the right to vote to nobles 
only, but if you wanted to have a universal franchise you would only 
have to change 1 thing - who gets to vote for the lowest council - and 
the rest of the details would work themselves out. In their government 
councils serve until their replacement arrives.  While the Zhodani 
Consulate is overall somewhat smaller than the Imperium it extends much 
farther in one direction, Coreward, than the maximum dimensions of the 
Imperium "Chtierabl: Chtierabl includes Chrietabl sector, a single 
Zhodani sector located over 250 parsecs (8 sectors) coreward of Zhdant. 
Chtierabl is well-established and over 800 years old (circa 1100)." AM 4 
Zhodani pg10.  At Jump 4 and averaging 10 days per Jump (including 
refuling etc) it would take about 800 days to get from here to Zhdant 
but apparently the Consulate has been managing this just fine for 800 
years (and earlier when their TL was lower & they did not have J4 it 
took even longer) therefore we KNOW that democracy can work just fine at 
Interstelllar distances.
	It is possible, maybe even probable, that this system would not 
work for the Third Imperium becase the Consulate is much more culturally 
homogenious than the Imperium.  This does not mean that the system would 
not work at interstellar distances only that it would not work for THEM. 
I could easily see democracy as possible in a more stable culture.

	I am a long time Travellar fan who has only been on this list 
for a little while.  This is my first post.

I don\'t think that the Imperium can always bring its massive power to bear, and to bear 
timely, especially out in the marches.  There is still considerable room for 
role-playing, e.g., in carrying an appeal to the Imperial government at the subsector 
capital, and possibly competing with other emergencies (which may or may not be real 
- -- as your PCs\' problem may or may not be real; maybe you\'re trying to defraud the 
Imperial government in some way), or dealing with the emergency until the Imperials 
arrive.

Nevertheless, I do find

>smaller scale threats.  Assassinations, local medical emergencies, disasters, etc.

to be more fun to play and to referee.  For one thing, they\'re a lot more manageable.

Months, yes.  Years?  Not so much.  I don\'t object to, or disagree with, the
plausability of a lag of six months or so, but beyond that, government gets
fairly hard to administer.  At least not without people in positions of
significant authority along the way.

Exactly my point.  Strephon probably told Norris, "Don\'t let the Aslan run
all over the place."  After that it was up to Norris to see that he followed
that directive as best as he saw fit.  And Norris probably told the Duke of
the Trin\'s Veil subsector, "Hey, Strephon wants us to do something about the
Aslans.  Maybe you should try to negotiate something with them. If they start
shooting, shoot back.  Otherwise, try not to make \'em too mad."  The
subsector duke, meanwhile, must have a tremendous amount of authority to
negotiate treaties, veto agreements, and call in "the big stick," when
necessary, since Norris won\'t find out about it for a couple of months (at
best.)  This, BTW, is the crux of my problem with the Rebellion.  The
subsector dukes and admirals could not have been slouches at running the
show, given the latitude they must have enjoyed pre-Rebellion.  Why all of a
sudden did they automatically fall in line when this wet-behind-the-ears
little jerk we all know and despise as Lucan started barking out orders from
Capital?  \'Cause it came from the Iridium Throne?!?  I bet most military and
political leaders throughout the Imperium had a pretty good feel for which
orders required more adherence after years of dealing with the Imperial
bureaucracy.  Hell, Dukes Craig and Norris knew enough to take charge, and
had the resources to make it work, at least for a while.  So, while I agree
with the analogy to the UK to a degree, the sheer size of the Imperium, and
the travel times associated wit that size, relative to the UK just doesn\'t
equate.  If it took a year and a half for messages to get from London to
India, the kingdom would not have lasted as long as it did.  If anyone knows
the true travel times at the time of the British Empire, I would be curious
to know what they were.  I doubt they were as long as we\'ve come to accept in
the Imperium.

Not only are the "Joes" more culturally homogenous, they all think similarly.
 Anyone remember the Thought Police?  I\'m not suggesting that Zhodani are
programmed to believe everything the government tells them, but that the
government has less to fear from radical elements than would a government
whose citizens are all free to think about killing their leader (or
overthrowing the government, or seceding) without being "fixed" by the
Thought Police.  The United States, France, England, et al contained far
fewer individuals when they decided to give folks the vote than they do
today, yet now they rarely can acheive a majority on most issues.  I don\'t
know much about India, besides the fact that they are a republic, but here in
the States we\'ve only got a quarter billion people to contend with, but
acheiving a plurality, much less a majority, is turning into a major issue.

   Which if you read the entirety of my originial post is what I postulate
would happen.  I further stated, however, that this absorption by the
Zhodanis would be voluntary on the part of Norris, particularly if the
Dominion of Deneb were faced with the prospect of being destroyed by the
Aslan and the Vargr.  Think of it as the lesser of two evils.

>fleets while the regular forces goes a-battling.

   The Imperial reserve fleets in the region are no where near powerful
enough in this era to hold off simultaneous attacks by the Aslan and Vargr.
 The combined Imperial forces present (both frontline and reserve fleets)
were only powerful enough to keep the OutWorld Coalition in check until the
massive Cooridor Fleet could arrive and save day like the cavalry riding in
to save the town in the old American Westerns.  With the Cooridor Fleet off
fighting Dulinor for Lucan, and the frontline fleets off on a fool\'s errand
trying to rescue Strephon (as proposed), you\'d see a repeat of the blitzkrieg
the Solomani pulled in the Old Expanses early in the war.

   As the storyline was written, this simply wasn\'t going to happen.

   Remember, the only people who know Strephon is really Strephon is Strephon
and his closest advisors.  Pretty much everyone else outside of Strephon\'s
territory is convinced that he is a fraud.  It is unlikely that anyone would
meet with him, even if he could manage the journey.

   Actually Strephon\'s best bet would have been to surrender himself to the
Solomani.  By promising them territory, and rallying his supporters to the
Solomani banner (not to mention his ability to act as a neutral arbitrator
keeping the Solomani from serious infighting), he just might have been able
to pull off an upset.

Harold

Why? Really, what is the substantial difference in 6 months versus 24 
months?

Okay, we\'re completely agreed here. Of course, I don\'t think Strephon would 
have to tell anyone "Don\'t let the Aslan run all over the place." I think 
that would be assumed. And as well, if Strephon decides that Norris or 
anyone doesn\'t follow any of his objectives as well as he would like, 
they\'re gone.

Allright, here\'s where I disagree with you. You are comparing two different 
situations. Lucan told the various fleets "Get your butts over here to 
fight Dulinor". This is the same kind of strategic-level order as "Don\'t 
let the Aslan run all over the place". He doesn\'t tell them exactly when to 
get to Core, or what route to take, or what meal to surve for lunch. Thats 
for  the Fleet Admirals, or the Ships Cooks to decide.

The Imperium would have to grant a great deal of latitude in how to 
implement orders, some latitude in how to interpret them, and absolutely no 
latitude on whether to follow them or not.

And it seems like quite a few Imperial political leaders did decide to 
disregard orders. The Vilani, Craig, Brzk and Norris represent a good 
portion of the Imperial sector leadership. But you can\'t expect every 
single leader to disregard the man sitting on the Iridium Throne.

Don\'t discount "Cuz  it came from the Iridium Throne". Lucan had the power 
of tradition going for him. For 1100 years, when an order came from the 
throne, people jumped. Thats why so many Imperial subjects followed Lucan, 
even despite his increasing instability.

As I said, I\'m sure the travel times are longer in the Imperium. However, I 
still can\'t see the dividing line that makes 6 months viable, but not 24. 
It would just take a little longer, thats all.

I can answer this one 100%.  In my copy of the little box there is a one
page card that describes the various sets, supplements, books, etc.  The
little box is Basic Traveller.  Here is the description from the card.

301. Basic Traveller is a boxed set containing Book 1, Characters and
Combat, Book 2, Starships, and Book 3, Worlds and Adventures.  These three
books are the basis for all of Traveller and are essential.  Each book is
48 pages.  Boxed set.

Now my question is did anything come with Starter Traveller besides the two
books?  Also I\'ve got the first printing, and it has simple black covers,
like the little books.  Was there also a version with picture covers?  Did
it come in any kind of box or anything?  I found them a couple years ago
sold separatly in a used games box at a store, and have been wondering.

I have studied it in some detail.  The early European imperial period is not a bad model 
for this particular Traveller phenomenon.  Local governors -- whether conquistadores in 
South and Central America or colonial governors or military garrisons in North America, 
India, or Indochina -- often received detailed instructions that meant nothing in the 
field.  They had a lot of practical power, and were generally able to justify whatever 
they actually did -- after all, they were the ones on the scene.  

The good old days wound down as communication speeded up.  Sailing ships carrying 
the mail were replaced by steam, but then the telegraph allowed orders and reports and, 
more important, news articles, to travel instantaneously from remote regions.  Local 
colonial authorities became ever more subject to direct supervision.

No, my Vargr-Galanglic dictionary and audio chip clearly indicate "bre

My take on it is that it depends.  When I first started playing Traveller, I thought, 
gee, why wouldn\'t you just take your type-S scout directly to where the action is -- you 
can sleep aboard, you\'ve got bigger weapons than you can carry in the air/raft, etc.  
Surely this is just a plot device to get the PCs into more vulnerable positions.

Later, I started to see more gray areas.  A highly populated world, for example, 
might already have enough air traffic that it wouldn\'t want space craft in the traffic 
patterns, and would also have concerns about safety and pollution from offworld 
vehicles.  Similarly, a rich world\'s environmental concerns would keep offworld ships at 
the starport.  

In addition, the landing pads of ships must put a lot of weight on a very small area -- 
enough that a ship might get stuck if it set down on open ground (hence the bedrock for 
E starports).  There is also a lot of routine maintenance to do on ships, and, as long a 
port is available at which to do it, it should be done.  

Finally, it makes a great plot device to get PCs out of their shells and into the 
action.

Have you ever tried to run a business (let alone a government) with offices
scattered around the globe with today\'s technology?  Despite the ads run by
Microsoft, IBM, and Lotus, it ain\'t as easy as they make it seem.
 Information is usually time-sensitive.  A report from a "branch office"
indicating that the Zhodani have begun troop movements into the area of your
border may mean they are getting ready to attack, or it may simply be a
staging exercise.  Ask Jeff Kazmierski (who I believe is an intelligence
analyst) what impact data from 12-18 months ago would have on an analysis of
a tactical situation such as this.  My answer is none, since the tactical
situation either escalated into warfare nine months ago, or was simply an
exercise and went away all by itself.  One of the biggest problems with the
comparison to the British Empire is the speed of travel.  Since troops
couldn\'t mass in one place without it taking a bit of time for them to get
there, the BE\'s planners had a brief period of time to assess the situation
and plan their response.  If the Zhodani attacked Jewell, a courier would
jump out-system to the nearest naval base.  There the admirals and commodores
would begin preparing for a counterattack and alert other units in the
(general) area as to what was up.  Governments are hard to administer over a
greater area because of the limitation of the speed of communication.  Sure,
if there were a subsector-wide famine which threatened to wipe out half of
that subsectors population, the Imperium has the resources to throw at it to
prevent it.  But by the time those resources arrive ten, twelve months later,
it might be too late.  The "little longer" you refer to may be too long in
many circumstances.  The sector and the domain level governments must provide
many of the solutions, and if they can do that, why do they need the
Imperium?  And once your citizens start thinking that way, your government is
history.

The vargr have many different languages, so it could theoretically be 
pronounced a number of different ways based on Brzk\'s culture.

There\'s a Gvegh (Gu  veck) pronounciation guide in the Vargr Alien 
Module.  Since Gvegh, or some form of it, is spoken by 60% of the 
Vargr encountered in the Spinward Marches and Gvurrdon sector, I\'d 
hazard a guess that Brzk is pronounced:

Berzsk

I\'ve always played vargr language like it is hard for humans to 
nunciate (because it is).  I see (or, rather, hear) thier words as 
different forms of growls, grunts, yelps, whines, and so forth--like 
it came from a dog.

Given this, I see Brzk as a quick bark like noise, with a heavy 
accent on the "B".  A human could emulate it by attempting a cough, 
or a caught sneeze.

Berzsk! 

Bless you.

As the german language (as well spoken in Austria with quite an accent

have no trouble to speak it like it\'s written. :-)

I wasn\'t particularly thinking of the Constitution, besides I think that 
we have a similar thing over here.  I was simply assuming that the

particularly given the nature of the Imperial \'government\' was possibly a

Actually, for some of us, these two *are* of "as much interest".  (And

the opposite.  I\'m fascinated by both [1].  I even have a copy of the

king/lawmaker if my limited info is correct).

Did he really have his own eye gouged out because the punishment he\'d 
decreed for adultery was having both eyes put out and when his son was 
caught at it, to avoid blinding him but to fulfil the law, he put out one 
of his son\'s eyes and one of his own?

Can anyone provide a source for this story?

Hmmm, perhaps I should rewrite the above sentence.  Ah, what the heck,

Personally, I think Dulinor was the best choice for the new emperor; one
small problem, though, is that he failed. Strephon was really the REAL
strephon [Survival Margin], and strephon must now kill dulinor as a
traitor. Dulinor is a traitor not because he tried, but because he failed
to kill the actual strephon.

Data or Image, one page: Cr10 per page per hop.
 I\'ve seen this in several places. It works well in an are you have X-Boat

reach nearest point, then back to J-2. Multiply the number of hops by 9
days to get travel time of message.

normally. I do allow "Puretext" at 1cr/page/hop typed courier 10pt,

on-world delivery.

     And, in a similar vein, how much of what we learned in the post-Miller

Nope. If you check, you\'ll find that colonization efforts have *never*

Such rulings *aren\'t* "unrealistic". Any such setup could be used to
make smaller "pulsed fusion" powerplants. So you can\'t build a
non-fission triggered fusion device that is *smaller* than a fusion
powerplant of fairly high output.

This make non-fission triggering useless for missiles, as you can\'t
build them small enough. You could still build them for special uses,
but they\'d be more like a ship\'s boat than a missile.

This would also explain why "extrality" for the starports evolved.
There have been cases of people being arrested at airports for carrying
items that are legal at both the place they left and at their
destination. It\'s just that the airline routing made them change planes
at a location where they were unaware that they were illegal.

I figure that at some point, theres going to be trouble about this. And

Representative selection would have to be local option. Most
non-democracies would appoint someone. Heck, given that local autonomy
is pretty much guaranteed, I\'d bet that most *democracies* would treat
it as an appointive position.

How representative is the US Congress? Not terribly. As the number of
people represented goes up, the degree to which any *real*
representation can take place goes down.

Frankly, I expect that even the Moot, as described in existing
materials, is unworkable. 

What I\'d expect to be workable would be a multi-level setup. Subsector
to sector sized groupings of planets to deal with matters affecting
their area. Such regions would be what had Imperial level
representation.

My take (back when CT came out) was that you had to have this as the
fusion drive exhaust made too much of a mess otherwise.

But for all you "reactionless thruster" types, figure out what the ship
weighs. Then figure out how big those landing pads, or skids, or
whatever are. Divide the weight by the contact area, and you get the
ground pressure. 

It doesn\'t take all that much pressure to break things. Things like
animal burrows can be *really* bad news. Underground water flows can
undermine even "hard packed" ground. 

BTW, if grass grows there, it *isn\'t* "hard packed". *Especially* if
it\'s "natural" growth, as opposed to a lawn. You could drive a car over
it, but try a heavily loaded truck and watch the fun.

If the min size of a fusion plant is say 14 Kl then a fusion trigger at
same TL should be much smaller as you\'ll need no neutron shielding, no
power generator, no cooling, no allowance for wear and tear of parts et c.

I\'m saying that min size for non fission initiated fusion warheads is
related to min size of fusion p-plant but generally much smaller, say 10%
or something.

Who says they have any choice in the matter? Such a station is within the
means of any medium+ population world, any subsector-sized or larger merchant 
company and even any subsector-wide news service. In fact, there\'s propably
several billionaires on each high-population world that could make a profit
of such an arrangement back on the stock market.

Useful indeed, if you can get a monopoly. But even if we postulate that only 
the Megacorporations, the high-population worlds and the TAS would bother (a
very iffy proposition IMO), we still have over a dozen sources independent 
of the official Imperial networks.

BTW, those vicious claims that the jump-4 X-boat network was a symptom of
blatant cynicism on the part of the Imperium seems to be less than well
founded. Another news brief datelined 101-1105 stated:

        "...a  decision  has  been made to deploy Jump-6 L-Hyd drop 
        tank  express  boats  on all major express routes.  Initial 
        feasibility  studies  indicate  that  such  a  system could 
        average  jump-5.5  per week by executing maximum jumps when 
        possible,  and  leaving  current xboat units to disseminate
        information between the new major relay points.  The system
        is  expected  to cut communication time to the Imperial hub 
        to  under 25 weeks.  The Initial System Deployment Schedule
        indicates  that the Regina subsector can expect to be fully 
        integrated into the network within a decade."

Obviously the project ran into unexpected delays, but the intentions were
there.

Remember that in Classic Traveller Jump-4 was the best you could fit into
a 100 T ship thanks to the minimum size of 20 T for a bridge (And if that
really has been deliberately changed in T4, some important part of the
background has been invalidated. @#$%^&*()_+!!!

True, but in the Traveller Universe such black worlds must be very hard to
detect. There should be lots (I don\'t know if it\'s thousands or millions,
so I\'ll settle for \'lots\') of such interstellar debris in every "empty"
hex in the Traveller Universe, so if they were anything but incredibly
difficult to spot, bang goes much of the Traveller background. IMO such
bodies are only found as a result of misjumps and they become fantastically
valuable (I\'ve had plans to use one as a McGuffin, but never got around to
it).

Note that I don\'t argue that this is realistic in Real Life (tm) terms,
just that this is the way things are in the TU (Which does not, contrary
to what some people like to think, bear more than a passing resemblence
the real universe).

Isn\'t an offensive weapons grade Nuclear Damper a Disintegrator? About
TL 17 I think, in MT/CT.  Of course, this isn\'t the same as
strengthening the SNF, which I guess would lead to the implosion of
matter and little black holes.  It wouldn\'t go boom in a vacuum
though!  Would probably also have severe effects on the locality of
any battle - not that that has ever stopped the military.  A combat
zone marked off limits because of the chance of being sucked up by a
black hole - punishment duty for the navy is to be in the repulsor
fitted starships charged with keeping the black holes from straying
("...the trouble with black holes, you see is that they are black, and
space is black, so seeing the black holes is difficult...").

Well, no better than it does in Western Civilization.  Or Eastern or
Southern for that matter.  It depends if your model of "democracy" is
the narrow one of representative democracy, whih is the version the
dominant West is trying to foist on the rest of the world, or a wider
model of democratic accountability - ie. the leadership have to
account to their people for their actions and the consequences
thereof, if they don\'t they are removed.  Read Lois McMaster Bujold\'s
Vor/Barrayar series for a world which is moving towards democratic
power without bothering with all this election stuff.  Also,
C. J. Cherryh\'s Cyteen for a representative democracy with a radically
different method of deciding the representatives.

IIRC what you said was that the attempt would leave the Regency so weak
that the Aslans, Vargr, and Sword Worlds would wreak such havoc that the
Zhodani would interfere. That\'s wrong. What I said was that the attempt 
could provoke the Zhodani into stepping in. The Zhodani have the strength 
to defeat the Domain; the bit players do not.

The defensive forces of each world amounts to 70% of the naval budget. That
gives them 3.5 trillion credit squadrons per billion inhabitants. The
reserve fleets gets half of the rest and the regular fleets the other half.
Even with all the regular forces gone away, the reserve fleets are almost
as powerful on their own. They are supposed to be a TL lower than the
regular fleets, at least on the average, but I\'m not sure just how much
sense that makes. Even if that is true, they are still equivalent to the
Aslan clan fleets and a TL up on their _ihatei_ fleets and the Vargr.
Hell, Norris could send off the reserve fleets and all he would lose would
be the low and medium population worlds. The high-population worlds, which
accounts for 99% of the strength of the Domain, are invulnerable to any-
thing the Aslans and the Vargr can muster. And that is only if Imperial
regulations forbid single worlds to build starships; if 10% of the
defense forces of Tobia, Glisten, Mora, Rhylanor, Trin, Deneb, Vincennes,
and the rest of the high-pop, high-tech worlds are jump-capable then he
could propably defend the other worlds too, though I admit that now the
Aslans and the Vargr have a sporting chance. Until Norris gets the idea
to offer the _Ihatei_ land for fighting the Vargr, of course...

The Outworld Coalition included the Zhodani. In fact, the Zhodani must have
been 90+% of the Outworld Coalition. That made all the difference.

The Aslan _ihatei_ are handicapped by the fact that they are divided, using 
inferior ships, use a big slice of their budget for transport ships, wants
to settle down with their family in peace, and is at the end of a multi-
parsec supply line. The notion of rational being genociding a planetary
population and then settling their own family down as a nice big fat
retaliatory goal is really ludicrous. The Vargr are handicapped by the fact
that their raiding is (supposedly) a business proposition. But raiding
against an armed enemy is a losing proposition. Pirates make a profit
by attacking defenseless merchant ships, not planetary defense forces.
And their ships are inferior too. The Domain starts out with a 5 to 1
advantage from the TL difference between 15 and 13 to start with.

Brzz and Margaret are some of the people that Strephon could convince in a
face to face confrontation simply because there would be things Strephon
would know that even a duplicate wouldn\'t. These are people who usually
meet him personally. (It\'s rather strange that Dulinor wasn\'t informed
ahead of time that Strephon wasn\'t available; as an Arch-duke who must
have been close to Strephon on numerous occasions he\'d surely know the
score and rate the truth (It\'s also strange that he didn\'t try to make 
sure of the clones too)). Brzz appears to have been an honourable Vargr
and it would have been to Margaret\'s advantage to hook up with a genuine
Strephon, since she would propably have thought herself his natural heir.

Norris he could propably even convince with a simple letter once he heard 
about his "elevation" to Archduke. Who else but the true Emperor could be 
_sure_ that it was a sham? (Including a confirmation would be a good move ;-)

No, I think a Grand Tour of the periphery of the imperium while Lucan and
Dulinor battered each other would have been worthwhile. Imagine how many
more defections a Strephon backed by an Archduke and a close personal
relation would have inspired. The Solomani would be a problem in any case
and the Rim is propably irretrivably lost, but I think Strephon could have
put the rest of Humpty-Dumpty together again.

Well, if you really want to make that sort of agreement, you give your
ambassador a damn good briefing and plenipotentiary powers.  Such work
has been carried out with restricted and long communication lags for
most of the history of the major Terran Empires, prior to the 20th
Century.  Of course, who is to say that the Ambassador hasn\'t already
made agreements with say Duke Craig - but Craig is a vassal to
Strephon, so the Ambassador travels to see the Emperor to convey the
goodwill of his clan, and magnify the honour of both parties, and on
his return he is accompanied by Duke Craig to Kusyu to present the
Duke\'s credentials and assure the Aslan clan head of the Imperium\'s
good intentions.  Of course, the ambassador never got the chance to
make the return journey...

Just because the subordinates make the deals doesn\'t mean the heads
aren\'t involved, especially in honour-and-fealty bound systems like
the Imperium and the Aslan Hierate.

I take your point but I would have thought that the concept needn\'t 
necessarily be limited to democracies.  After all a religious 
dictactorship could be constrained by its \'religion\' and I\'m sure 
(every?) other government type could have exceptions like this too.  (If 
only I had time to think of them all!)

Perhaps another UPP could be designed.  A universal punishment profile.  
Obviously its generation would be linked to law level, government type 
and maybe even population.  It could detail (or give guidance to 
travellers regarding), length of judicial process, type of process, 
severity of punishment (which maybe entirely unrelated to law-level), 
types of punishment (e.g. only corporal, no imprisonment, small fines, 
etc.), portions of population it doesn\'t apply to, and so on.

While I appreciate the detail isn\'t always going to be necessary, if a 
\'generation\' procedure was designed, it would be handy on some occasions. 
 Certainly might scare the whatevers out of PCs if they\'re caught doing 
something illegal and think they\'ll get off lightly only to find that the 
world they\'re on has a complex legal system which will take years to 
resolve say, or uses some form of psionic mind adjustment however trivial 
the offence!

The possibilities (as ever) seem endless!

The original edition of Traveller (ie Basic Traveller) was a three book
set...
B1 Characters and Combat
B2 Starships
B3 Worlds and Adventures.
They came in a black box much like the original D&D set.

Even as a work-in-progress, that timeline is fantastic.  Everyone 
involved with making Traveller products should have a copy of it.

Thank you for putting it together, Don!

Your points sound reasonable.

My take has been that the obstacles to landing outside of a starport
are (usually) purely bureaucratic. The interstellar government wants
to keep control over interstellar trade. See the sub-adventure "Zilan
Wine" in the Traveller Adventure for example.

It is thought that when stars come near each other that they will
gravitationally eject comets from each other\'s Oort Clouds.  I even
read that some of the comets that we see from the earth might have been
from other star systems.  This all assumes that most stars have Oort
Clouds, an assumption that seems to be true in Traveller.  I don\'t know
hard numbers for how many comets there would be in deep space, but my
feeling is not very many. But this isn\'t my field of study so I could
easily be wrong.

Speaking of Duke Craig, does anyone know why in the Rebellion
Sourcebook instead of his picture there was a picture of a lizard? 
Never understood that

I just got a copy of "The Traveller Adventure".  I was reading the introductory 
material.  It specifies that you must have ".... or Basic Traveller" and then 
follows in parentheses a list of the first three books.

Oh, absolutely, 100 percent agreed.  My point was, more specifically, that
the subordinates *DO* make the deals.  The emperor lends credence to the
whole thing, but isn\'t terribly involved in the actual negotiations (if at
all.)  To give the closest thing I can relate from my experience, I worked
for a while in technical sales as a field rep.  My "office" was located right
here in my house in Phoenix, AZ.  The corporate offices are located in Texas,
and the national sales manager lived in Florida.  For a variety of reasons
Arizona doesn\'t follow daylight savings time (don\'t get me started), so for
half the year I was 2 hours behind the home office, and three hours behind my
boss.  In my experience, customers (and probably foriegn dignitaries) don\'t
like to get hung up waiting too long over "the fine print."  If a customer
called my at 4:30pm MST (long after my boss and the "home office" called it a
day) and wanted to place an order that was contingent on various provisions,
it was my call whether or not to accept them, in full or in part.  I always
had the ability to tell them, "No way.  It\'s against company policy," whether
it was or not, if I felt we (the company) weren\'t getting a fair deal.  Twice
per year, the sales manager would come out and glad hand my large accounts
(like the Ambassador going to see Strephon, except, for reasons of etiquette,
the "customer" goes to the "boss," rather than the other way around.)  When
he arrived, I would brief him on "company policies" I had created for certain
deals, and he just played along.  And I\'m only talking about a delay of a
couple of measly hours.  Imagine the power I would have needed to have if the
delay were weeks or months.  That\'s the point I\'ve been eating up bandwidth
trying to make for the last couple of days.  Duke Craig could probably say
with complete confidence, "The Imperium is unable to comply with your request
Mr. Ambassador," or something of the sort, and Strephon would probably agree
if called on it.  Why do you suppose it\'s brought up so often that nobles are
taught to serve.  Hell, you wouldn\'t need to teach \'em anything if everything
was set in stone or if there was someone they could ask.  Also note the
Imperial Encyclopedia entries (players and referees section) about Imperial
Stationary.  I bet the a duke or duchess could use it to write an "Imperial
decree" in the name of the emperor when absolutely necessary, for the
credence lent by the name.  Obviously, if this was abused, the emperor would
not be pleased and would likely remove the noble from office, but it\'s
possible (and probably necessary to effectively run the Imperium) for the
dukes to wield that power.  Divergent opinions welcome, but I (obviously)
feel pretty strongly about this one.

Example: The Roman Catholic Church claims to follow the teachings of the
Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ.  The RCC also launched the Crusades, the
Spanish Inquisition, and the complete destruction of the Inca when they
politely told the Spanish to go away.  Every Christian sect has this
problem; in the US we get people gunning down women\'s health workers in
God\'s name, the Ku Klux Klan claims to follow God, etc...  Just because the
priest says "love your neighbor" and "turn the other cheek" doesn\'t mean
that the Holy Office is going to go lightly on you if you commit heresy.

Minor point:  up until early 1117, the Duchess of Mora was Sector Duke..
Norris was "elevated to Archduke in recognition of his leader ship during
the FFW (yeah, sure!).

Exactly.  In 1990, George Bush gave an order to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
that amounted to: Get some troops to Saudi Arabia ASAP, follow on with the
heavy forces.  This filtered down through Army, Corps, Division, Brigade,
etc.., until you got to a Corporal getting his fire team on the damn plane.
The President didn\'t need to know the details, just that his orders were
being carried out.

And each of the faction leaders had a "dirty tricks" team to either
discredit or remove stubborn nobles.  The Baron of an Industrial world
claiming Lucan isn\'t the Emperor?  A few photos of his sessions with a
professional domme, revelations of wide-spread embezzelment by his staff..
he\'s gone.  Or he just has a "hunting accident".

When I was in the Army, Ronald Reagan was President.  I hated that man, but
if he gave the order, I would have gone.  Why?  I had taken an oath to do
just that.  And that\'s with 200 years of tradition!  GURPS Space has a nice
sidebar on why good people support evil empires; the gist of it is that
compliance is the path of least resistance.

Even stranger, the lizard is standing in front of Antares\' banner!  There is

but a great adminstrator.  I always wondered if he was funding the Verge
Seperatists to take some of Dulinor\'s attention off Daibei.

        What do you mean by "boarding"? I assume that you mean "boarding in
combat", pirate style. I do not know if there are rules on this, but I can
tell you what pirates, corsairs and military do in _my_ universe, when
attacking another ship with the objective of getting into it:

        Possibility 1: Kill & Take a look. If they are not very worried
about the contents (e.g., they want to steal raw materials, or the main
objective is not pillaging), they extensively damage the enemy ship, making
sure to kill (almost) everyone on board but avoiding to make the ship
explode or fall into pieces. E.g., a couple of lucky shots disbling the
power plant so that the ship is energy-dead, or a sufficient number of
impacts to make sure that the ship is a derelict. Then, they board the easy
way: make the two vectors equal and connect lock to lock with some flexible,
extensible "tunnel", or tend a cable between locks and open both to space
(of course everyone uses a vacc suit).

        Possibility 2: True boarding. Used when the attackers want to steal
the cargo and not break it into pieces, or to kidnap someone, or to capture
the ship. When the objective ship is damaged enough so as to not being able
to avoid the attacking equaling vectors, then a boarding party is dispatched
to make a break in the hull (or, more likely, to make some lock explode) and
go into the ship: personal combat!. As auxiliary boats tend to be quicker
and more maneuverable, it would take less damage to the objective ship to
make the boarding from such small crafts. If the combat has produced some
hull breaches, the boarding party could probably use them as well.

        There was, time ago, a very Traveller-like (for me) SF comic called
"Alien Legion" (Epic) which featured, in the first numbers, a "True
boarding". I used the scenes a couple of times to illustrate the point to my
players.

        What I\'m questioning (any physics wonks out there who truly grok
fission are invited to comment) is whether disintegration (target comes to
pieces on the atomic level), detonation (lovely big boom), or simply
massive amounts of radiation (slow glow) would occur if one tampered with
the force holding atomic nuclei together in the following manner:

        A field is created at the center of which the force holding the
nucleus together is completely nullified, causing the particles composing
the nuclei in the complete nullification zone to fly off at high speeds...
striking the nuclei farther out, where the force in question is
significantly weaker, whereupon these would be split, emitting more
particles causing more fission, etc.

<BLINK>  Harold, the *Solomani*?  Even if they were within fifty parsecs of
him, and Daibei and Ilelish weren\'t in the way, his own nobles would march
him out and lynch him! 

As it is, Strephon has already for all intents and purposes abdicated the
Throne.  Given a chance to sort out the situation, if the Moot is able to
determine that he *is* Strephon, they will force him to make this official.
(Styryx lost a few worlds to the Zhodani and kicked off the Rim War and was 
forced to abdicate -- but Strephon has lost entire *sectors* to foreign
powers, and has lost control over most of the Imperial military.) 

Lucan is dead, with no heir.  Strephon is out of the picture.  Margaret
inherits both of their claims.  For much of the surviving Imperial 
nobility, she is the One Clear Choice, dark IRIS and obvious Tukera
connections notwithstanding.  The other first-round claimants, Brzk
and Dulinor, are dead.  Does Dulinor\'s fleet (possibly commanded by his
brother, if he\'s alive) still control Capital, and will someone step
forward to claim the throne for Isis, for themselves "by right of fleet
control" (laughable, illegitimate, but precedented), or will they sue
for a cease-fire?

 Any more info on that?

Secondly,  XTech Industries(the Commander\'s Company) is looking for Techies

currently the main thrust, but XTech can accomidate other versions as well.

You ideas will be posted on my site, PlanetX, and you will be given full

Landing outside of an established starport, in my campaign, tends to be
much trickier.  Beyond what governmental regulations there are, there is
also pilot skill.  For example, establishing an orbit, or even landing at
the downport, is not very trying for the pilot.  Even a Pilot-1 can
handle the basic switch flipping (ie.  tell the on-board computer to
handle the landing by talking to the starport computer) involved there.
Landing without talking with the starport computer is more complex (requires a
routine roll), but is still facilitated by the telemetry supplied to the
ship by the starport (assuming, of course that they permit unassisted approach
and landing!).  \'Hard\' or solid surface landings,  with no information but
what ships\' sensors provide is a \'difficult\' roll.  Blind landings, with
no sensor data, (usually implying special circumstances) are taken case by case.

My campaign rule is that Class A Starports require ships  to
use starport computer-assisted landings.  This also implies that
ships MUST land at the starport!  Class B Starports support, but
do not require, computer-assisted landings.  Class C starports can only
provide telemetry to the ship.  With the amount of traffic supported by
Class C and Class B starports, the controllers will be very short with a
ship that does not respond to direction (ie. land where they tell them
too), and military response is very likely if the ship is detected trying
to sneak down! Class D and below do not provide information to the ships
computer, other than location.  As traffic control is, ahem, minimal,
there is a fairly good chance that a ship may land, if not undetected, at
least unremarked.

Some controls that I have in place are a requirement for starships to have
a licensed Pilot-1 or better aboard before they may leave a starport;
suspension or worse for pilots that endanger lives; orbital satellites
that record ship traffic; random ship boardings for inspections and to
check ships\' papers.

This is not to say that players cannot make covert landings, they just
have to plan them!

I picked up a Starter Traveller in a second hand thrift shop a couple of

1) A box (pictures on it)
2) the two black books
3) two adventures: Mission on Mithril/Shadows
4) a card with GDW\'s Traveller product line as of 1984 or so which mentions

Ummm, BZZZT.  Remember, tha tthe power plants include cooling systems,

My biggest fear (and the only reason I\'d not buy it) is if the book is little

I too have the thruster kick up dust, etc.  I just didn\'t see
it as making as much a difference.  (I never liked the switch
over to thruster plates.)

Dependes.  Praries and the like don\'t a generall "springier" surface.
However, the roots actually make the soil harder to break up.  Thus
the grass surface will give a bit but will be able to hold more
weight.  The only real difference will be if the grass holds in
enough water to keep the ground soft.

My Traveller Timeline (http://www.prairienet.org/~dmckinne/trav.html) needs
information on GDW products I don\'t own, and, if anyone finds the timeline
useful, please report any perceived or referenced descrepancies...

My goal is to eventually have all Traveller licensed and non-licensed 
products\' timeline info, as well as additions from various campaigns 
(please contribute, hint, hint).

The timeline basis is a Microsoft Works 3 database, with entries for
"Date (Imperial)", "Details", "Reference" (which is Publisher, Product and
Page Number), and "Priority".  All GDW products have a priority A, 
DGP products have a priority B, other licensees (except Judges Guild) C,
Judges Guild and HIWG documents D, and campaign contributions and 
discussion inferences E.  In the case of the last item, the "publisher"
and "product" will refer to the individual and origin - I can even include
IRC discussions in this format!

Oh - and for referees - the "starting dates" of all adventures I find
(including magazine adventures) are in the timeline as well!

Any way, that\'s the grand vision - and it\'s on the web, so EVERY Traveller
contributor can get to it.  However, I want to finish the classic Traveller
GDW materials first, and don\'t own the following:

Book 0		An Introduction to Traveller
Supplement 5	Lightning Class Cruisers
Supplement 10	The Solomani Rim
Adventure 0	The Imperial Fringe
Adventure 4	Leviathan (I did own this, it appears to have walked off...)	
		(and yes, I know some events in this may not be canon...)
Adventure 8	Prison Planet
Adventure 9	Nomads of the World-Ocean
Adventure 11	Murder on Arcturus Station
Adventure 13	Signal GK
Doub. Adv. 3	The Argon Gambit/Death Station
Doub. Adv. 4	Marooned/Marooned Alone
Alien Module 2	K\'kree
Alien Module 4	Zhodani
Alien Module 5	Droyne
Alien Module 8	Darrians
Rules Set	The Traveller Book/Starter Traveller
Game 2		Snapshot
Game 3		Azhanti High Lightning
Game 4		Fifth Frontier War
Game 5		Invasion: Earth
Module 1	Tarsus
Module 2	Beltstrike

all JTAS issues (I own all four "best of" books, but apparently there\'s
stuff in the individual issues...)

Now, again, the format for timeline entries is just like it appears on the
web page:

Date (Imp)	Details (who did what to who)
		Reference (Publisher, Product, Page #)

Thanks!


PS:  Why didn\'t I post the timeline to the list?  Its only 94K long,
already...  Ugh.

Apparently Shalom has received his (see his recent post for his

with the bulk of the U.S. orders delivered over the weekend/early next

years, linking all of the published GDW adventures together.  

Starting in 1105, with the Traveller Adventure, an unlikey group of 
individuals is cast into a caldron of intergalactic intrigue, action, 
and politics that will take them through the Fifth Frontier War, thereafter, the 
Rebellion, and into Hard Times.

Utimately, the adventurers will be the catalyst of the destruction or 
survival of the human race.

I am their chronicler.

With this post, I start the log of these events.  The Grand Adventure 
will be a mish mash of game information, short stories, NPC bios, 
notes, thoughts, and adventure ideas.  It will be a magazine of this 
epic story, told from many view points in many ways.  It is a sharing of one 
gamemaster to many others.

This campaign is a collection of adventures, both home grown and 
published, both official Traveller and from other games, fleshing out 
the backbone laid out by the pivotal adventures in Traveller history: 
 The Traveller Adventure, Beltstrike, Tarsus, Adventures 1-12, The Double 
Adventures, Knightfall, Arrival Vengenance, Hard Times, etc.

Est. Imperial Yr.	Campaign Title 				.

This has been written about in a novel, don\'t remember which one =

   I\'m thinking in terms of "what would Machiavelli do?", not in terms of a
man who may have had principles, but was not emperor material.  

   Let\'s face it, emperors don\'t go off secretly many light years away to
inspect what amounts to a glorified spy satellite--they have people (trusted
aides) who do that sort of thing for them.  Also, a true Emperor would have
rushed back to the Capital at the first sign of trouble, and told any advisor
who said different to get bent.  His place is own the throne or laying dead
beside it.

   As for Strephon\'s band of supporters in his stronghold c.1120, he\'s better
off without them, and they are better off without him.

   No, Machiavelli, seeing that he could no longer trust the vast majority of
nobles who supposedly gave allegience to him, would have recruited outsiders
to come in and restore him to the throne.  Seeing as how the Vargr can\'t be
controlled (they would loot first, then think about military objects), the
Aslan would require too much land as reward, and the Zhodani, Hiver and
K\'kree were too far away or would want to turn him into a puppet afterward,
that leaves the Solomani.  The Solomani can be controlled, would only want
few sectors as reward (territory that was originally theirs anyway), and
would leave him in charge after everything was over.  More importantly, by
the early 1120s, they have enough military might to do the job, were someone
charismatic in charge.

   Of course the sight of Strephon riding back into the Imperium at the head
of a large Solomani fleet might cause people like Dulinor, Margaret, et. al.
to temporarily forget their differences and unite to defeat him.  If so, he
still wins, because now the Imperium is united in common cause once
again--even if it is for the purpose of beheading him and sending the
Solomani back where they came from.

Harold

In addition, the larger the governing body, the less influence individual
members have. Again in the US Congress, most of the power is in the hands
of committee chairmen and party leader. Most bills are written by only a
few specialists, discussed only in committee, and rubber-stamped by the
majority. Only the most controversial bills are debated, and most of the
congressmen aren\'t listening to the debates: they\'re in committee working
on their own bills. That\'s even less representative.
A moot consisting of thousands of members would be either impotent or even
more dominated by its own government.

off a cliff. If your craft uses any kind of jets to land, you would also
prefer not to start a fire or blow clouds of dust into the air if you can
avoid it.
If you\'re in an unpopulated area, a good landing site can be hard to find
on the spur of the moment. If you\'re in a populated area, you won\'t win
friends and influence people by squashing the local\'s crops or blocking
traffic. If you\'re a merchant, you want to land where the locals expect a
starship to come to trade, rather than 2 or 20 or 200 km away.
So, the minimum requirements for a class E port are a spot that is a) known
to the interstellar community to be b) solid, clear, and level, and c)
reserved by the locals (if any) for the exclusive use of starships or
spacecraft. Obviously, not all worlds have such a spot. Not so obviously,
they may have several, and if there is more than one spaceport, the UWP
will give the best.

My thoughts were based around situations like the one in "Safari
Ship".  The adventure clear expects the PC\'s to land the ship
at the Class E "starport" and use just launch to get around when
they need to travel outside the range of the airraft.  However,
my PC\'s reactions was to want to just move the ship and have
both craft available.

I think it is likely that a government is going to impose additional
restrictions but my questions were cropping up on frontier worlds
(maybe because I didn\'t have the governmental restrictions to
fall back on).  I see similar situations arise, including the
fact that, even if they are "cleared off" the ISS has designated
bedrock  landing spots on even uninhabited worlds.

My game -- the Sunday Follies -- concerns the antics^h^h^h^h^h adventures
of the crew of a 300-ton ex- Vargr corsair. 

My characters have figured out that docking ship-to-ship just doesn\'t work
without the ships\' being able to match vectors, so what they do is "shoot a
line over" -- toss a magnetic or adhesive grapple line from the boarding
ship to the victi -- oops, _potential prize_, and hand-over-hand between
ships. Next, the boarding team either manually cycles the airlock or enters
through a hull breach large enough to board through (I assume that PA and
explosive missile hits that penetrate armor enough to cause  a
decompressive "man overboard" per the RPSCS have created a hull breach
large enough to board through . . . as can a creative use of a demolition
charge!).

The ship\'s boat is used to bring the marines close to the enemy vessel.
Smart boarders _do not_ bring their ship close to an unsecured enemy -- too
many _bad_ things can happen!

Use a 30t ship\'s boat to transport the marines (y\'know, you could use
grapples to lock the boat to the outside of the hull if space is a
problem).

Yes, there are references to this in Survival Margin: Norris writes
his Archduke patent on official Imperial Stationary, provided to him
by Strephon, saying "...why did he give it me if he didn\'t want me to
use it?" as part justification. He also notes that it feels a little
strange, nknowing that "...this time..." if ne screws up, Strephon
won\'t be there to fry him - I take the last time implied in this
statement to refer to his use of the Imperial Warrant during the 5FW.
In fact, as far as I can tell, an Imperial Warrant gives you
effectively all the powers of the Emperor, with the important
difference being that it is in the name of the Emperor, rather than
being simply the word and deed of the Emperor.  Whenever a noble acts
independently, s/he had better be damn sure that they get it right,
because the next person up the chain will act to stop you without
hesitation or restraint (if they are any good.)

Starter Traveller books were black and read and white; there were no picture

well.
