The above reminds me of *something* I\'ve read or seen. I can\'t quite
place it, but I think it would play something like this:

Player 1: See, I told you this was a good investment. It\'s guaranteed
to defeat alarm systems up thru the Mark 14.

Player 2(examining control panel of alarm installation): Oh $#!+. This
is a Mark *15*!

PA system: Come out with your hands up!

If you can accelerate the decay of radioisotopes, you can artificially
"age" items. That is, you can make them appear older whem various
radio-isotope dating systems are used. 

This presents an opportunity (at least in the early years of damper
tech) for a faked archeological site and faked artifacts.

Of course, when someone gets around to using one of the other dating
techniques (like the thermoluminescence test for pottery) the jig is
up. And depending on the details of the handwaving for damper tech, it
may be possible to detect that decay was artificially induced.

Volume of a sphere = (4/3)*pi*r^3
Surface Area       = 4*pi*r^2

So for a "unit sphere (ie one with a radius of 1) the volume is 4.19.
The area is 12.6. So the surface to volume ratio is 3:1. This is also
the *minimum* possible surface to volume ratio in euclidean space.

compare with a cube. Surface = 6 * L^2. Vol = L^3. So surface to volume
is 6:1.

It might be uranium as well.  I know that uranium has been used for such things,
albeit in very small quantities.  According to my dentist, the two plastic teeth
I have (yup, the two front uppers - I \'caught\' an aluminum baseball bat) have a
very small amount or uranium in them that make keep them whiter than they would
normally be for the material they\'re made out of (some not-too-tasty stuff
called prismolight - kind of like quick drying cement except you shine a laser
on them to finish the hardening).

Old glow-in-the-dark stuff (used most commonly in watches) used radium.
However, they don\'t use this stuff any more (in fact, I worked in the jewelry
trade for a number of years, and apparently a few years back some group...
maybe the EPA?  Was paying a lot of money to take these watches out of the
hands of collectors\' and dispose of them safely and properly).

One hour of "CD quality" audio is 44000 (digitization rate) x1 (bytes
per sample) x3600 (seconds per hour) bytes, or about 158 meg. One hour
of "telephone quality" audio is 4000 (digitization rate) x1 (bytes per
sample) x 3600 (seconds per hour) or about 14 meg. Both are for
uncompressed data.

Compressing at 100:1 *without losing data* may be difficult. But
assuming that you are able to do it, that gives a required data rate of
13 kbps (telephone quality) to 140 kbps (CD Quality). Both are going to
be rather noticeable usages of frequency spectrum.

About as subtle as a searchlight. *Current* technology allows
hand-sized units to switch frequencies as much as 100 times a second.
That\'s what I\'d assume these bugs would do.

This is the most likely mode. Though again, I\'d expect the data "burst
to change frequencies *just* as often as the "constant transmit" mode.

Another possibility is a .01 sec burst once a second. Of course, the
actual duration and spacing will *not* be constant. but vary using the
same sort of algorithm used for the frequency hopping.

Quite true. Spread spectrum ("frequency hopping") is detectable if you
know what to look for. Otherwise it looks like static.

Rather than encrypt the transmission, you use the frequency change
pattern, transmit interval pattern, and transmit duration pattern as
the "encryption". You have to match all three or don\'t get anything
usable. And it helps make the transmissions harder to spot. 

Again, this is *known* tech, merely projected about *2* TLs ahead.

Ok, here you run into *real* trouble. Current TV/VHS recording quality
video is about 200x400x256. Yes *200* horizontal resolution. Don\'t
believe me? Pause your VCR while playing a tape or uses a video capture
board. 

The "theoretical" resolution of NTSC video is better. But not a lot.
The new digital TV will have several resolutions. 640x480x256,
704x480x256, 1280x720x256, and 1920x1080x256. And video *doesn\'t*
compress as well as audio. Not when you have to compress it in
real-time. 

And *none* of these can be "blown up" to amazing levels. Try blowing up
a GIF or PNG file on your computer, and you\'ll see what I mean. There\'s
a *fixed* amount of data. And even digital enhancement isn\'t going to
get you that much extra. I\'d say that a 4 times blowup is pushing
things (at that enlargement, every pixel in the original image is now
*16* pixels in the blowup).

The bandwidth required for the video devices is *way* too extreme to
hide for long. It\'s going to take *megahertz* of bandwidth.

Better check out the minimum optics size required for that sort of

Any sort of *useful* video is going to use buffer at roughly 100 times
the rate audio does.

Again, frequency hopping that slowly is just about useless. Real gear

It is possible to detect receivers via leakage from the IF stage,
though it\'s far from conclusive. Fixed frequency receivers can be
detected via "resonance" effects, but that\'s not going to help with
frequency agile units.

Probably... ;-)

I\'d go for the accident route, cos it would really irritate the players if
they spent a long time chasing a supposed conspiracy and found out that D
was killed accidently, but there was another deeper conspiracy.

Actually, as you\'re at SJG now perhaps the Templars could be behind it
all.. ;-)

Germany company did it (IBG).

I have it (cost 115 UK sterling including postage) and it was worth it.

This was the shop I bought from (excellent service) only problem was that
they could only accept mastercard, not Visa.

It worked for me - I just aquired a copy of GURPS. However, having skimmed
it I will almost certainly be using T4.1 rules, but will end up buying GT
stuff for background . <sigh> I suppose that makes me an addict...

Second semi-serious idea. Set up a mailing list for the TNS flashes...
That\'d be really great having a TNS newsflash arrive....

How can this be true?  If I use a WAV editor in win95 to record from a
CD, it gives me at MOST 3-5 minutes on a 2.1 gig hard drive that is
mostly empty.  We\'re talking 16bit audio, stereo, at standard CD
sampling rates of 44,000Khz.

If there is a way around this, please tell me.

be a good bit cheaper than the equivalent paper product

For example, I put a novel out recently through an internet publisher, at
£2.25 for 100,000 words. Helf the price of the paperback seems fair when
you consider the lower overheads.

(the above was a plug. Apologies!)

Point is, you could use the lower overheads to allow you to publish large
numbers of adventures in a directory. Make a couple public as samples, then
charge for the rest.

I can see that working, and I\'d use it.

Thoughts, anyone?

Jo Grant\'s SYSGEN or LIBRARY program (i forget which - it may have been 
both) would generate speculative cargo based on the CT system.  I could 
never get Jo\'s program to run reliably on my PC, so never used the 
system in anger.

When I eventually finish writing my version of Galactic-meets-Metator 
it will allow you to find both freight, passenger and cargo 
availability from your current location to a nominated destination.

I think a trading utility would be a great idea - particularly if it 
offered more than one trading system
Classic
MT
TNE
CORE 101 cargos
Rob Prior\'s extended trade goods
etc

The trick here would be to see how one interface can cope with an 
arbitrarily designed trade system ... and this depends on what kind of 
program you were trying to write.  I was impressed by CHARCON (a 
character generator and charcter sheet printing program) because its 
sophiticated feature set mean that additional scripts and data files 
can be added to define the character generation method of almost any 
RPG - without needing to recompile the executable.  As it happens, the 
included RPG systems (FUDGE, CORPs) are not ones I want to play, but it 
shows what can be achieved if you set out to have a flexible program.

How extensive is the waiver for freelance material?
Its actual an mildly interesting from the legal point of view.
If you view the change in payment as a modification of the contract, then IG
would have whatever was transferred (presumably copyright).  But that would be a
stretch since the authors already performed by delivering their material.  It
seems to me that what IG is doing is compensating freelancers "off the
contract."  A very good idea, because thats probably the best the freelancers
could get if they sued, given the circumstances.  But it means the contract
wasn\'t performed.  Thus, the authors still have their copyright in the works.
However, if they use it without license from FFE, then they violate that
trademark.  And since IG is only a licensee of FFE, they can\'t make any of the
freelancers material licensed.   Authors who were compensated as agreed gave up
whatever the contract says.

Sorry.  Ob Traveller:  umm . . . make sure your mercenary/pirate/freelance
whatever crew has a good lawyer.

Actually, \'CD\' quality is 16 or more bits, not 8. Most CD player A/D
converters are 24 bit. At that rate an hour of \'CD\' quality sound is about
450 mb, or not so coincidentally, the recording capacity of a 60 minute
CD. 74 minute ones are 650 mb. These sizes are determined by the dominant
player in the CD biz, which is the audio industry.

Data compression is another factor entirely. There are fractal-based
compression schemes that can compress image data to astonishing levels
while retaing a great deal of image quality;  whether that same scheme can
apply to audio data, I don\'t know. I do know that the compression of the
data is extremely computationally intensive, but doable in reasonable
time, even today. With the gains in processor power and speed possible
with such things as optical rather than electronic based processors,
real-time compression of such data could be accomplished in small low
power packages.

Check out Iterated Systems for software you can buy today that
accomplishes this, with better results than JPEG or GIF compression.
http://www.iterated.com

Using a lossy first-gen image encoding scheme like .gif or .png as an
example is like precluding audio bugs because we can\'t get the vaccuum
tubes small or low power enough.

44.1 kHz 16-bit, stereo audio data is stored at 10 megs per minute.  If you\'re
only getting 3 to 5 minutes on a mostly empty 2.1 gig harddrive, then it\'s
time to go out and pick up a new Wav editor  :^)

Seriously though, I\'ve done a goodly amount of music and sound work on the
computer (an unproduced demo, and two songs for CD compilations, one of which
never made it to press), if you\'re only getting 3 - 5 minutes from over a gig,
then something is seriously wrong.

This is something I\'ve always wondered about, but was too lazy to check up

Yes indeed. As a poor student this is something I could maybe even afford,
and would probably buy if they were of a good quality. (good gods - I\'ve
just said something in favour of the commercialisation of the web! Argggh!
Shows how starved for decent adventures I must be.)
 
Having them on disk is useful, too because it makes them easy to edit, for
specific campaigns. Therefore I\'d be against .pdf format unless there were
other formats available - it\'s great for some things, but it\'s a pain for
gaming products that a large percentage of the market would want to fiddle
with.

	Does the WAV format include compression? A simple analysis shows the
following: 44.1kHz sampling rate, 16 bits per sample per channel, 32 bits
total (2 channels--stereo), 60 seconds: 44,100x32x60= 84,672,000bits per
minute, or nearly 10 meg per minute. So a 2.1G hard drive (neglecting file
system overhead and the inconsistency about whether mass memory capacity is
rated in powers of 2 or 10 ...), it seems you should get 198 minutes, +/-,
on the drive. That matches up fairly well with the capacity of audio CDs
(standard 70 min CD has around 660M of capacity, IIRC).

Standard storage medium is cryogenic liquid hydrogen. Also, it\'s

There *is* one other color that I\'ve seen. I have an old glow in the
dark religious statue I was given as a child. It glows a whitish blue,
tending towards violet.

The glow in the dark materials work by getting noloecules energized by
exposure to normal light, and then over time the molecules return to
the "ground" state by emitting photons of a *lower* frequency than the
ones that "charged" them.

> Is there any reason why a future technology might not be able to produce a

The trouble is that due to thermo dynamic and quantum considerations
the emitted light has to be lower frequency than the charging light.
And likewise it tends to decay expontentially (like radioactive half
lives). 

The higher the frequency of the emitted light, the *dimmer* the light
will be, simply because there\'s less likely to be as much "charging"
light of a high enough frequency to charge the molecules. (BTW, try
using a blacklight to "charge" the glow in the dark stuff. It\'ll do a
better job, faster in most cases). 

This is also why you don\'t get bright or "saturated" colors. 

To get what you\'d like there\'d have to be a power source *somewhere*.
The energy storage in the "glow in the dark" molecules is pretty lousy.
But if you make it too efficient, you either won\'t get the light back
out, or you run the risk of it releasing a bit more strongly than you\'d
like (fire or even explosion hazard).

No, but what you are doing there is selecting the *sampling rate*.
Which has a *direct* effect on the "quality"of the saved data. Any
frequencies above *half* the sampling rate have to be filtered out or
they\'ll cause all sorts of mess in the playback. As I noted in another
post, CD quality is 44k samples/sec, telephone is 4k.

But *realtime* compression (ie compressing the data as it is generated)
isn\'t as efficient as being able to run a compression program on the
"whole file". And the realtime nature of the bug is going to limit the
compression somewhat.

Except that *increases* the required bandwidth for transmitting the
data. And the more bandwidth required, the easier it is to stop the
transmission.

Alas, you may be able to expand it infinitely, but the resemblance of
your expansion to the actual scene depends *entirely* on how well the
generated "fractal code" for the image resembles reality. Thus you are
actually limited to the *actual* data transmitted. Fractal compression
is actually *very* lossy, it\'s just that the nature of the algorithim
fills in the missing data "plausibly". It\'s the *last* thing you want
for real, *important* data.

Sure, but yuou can do that by manipulating the data stream from *any*

Still both this and the previous technique are data limited. That is,
the match between the output and reality is limited by the amount of
relevant data in the input. So only "lossless" compression is any good
for use as input to them, and the quality of the results is limited by
the resolution of the input data.

I thinnk what he means is "spread spectrum" technology. That\'s where
the signal changes frequency according to a complicated algorithm
synched by clocks in both transmitter and receiver. If you do it *at
least* 10 times a second, and uses at least several dozen frequencies,
the output on any one frequency is effectively random noise (ie
"static").

And it only works because the signal is a minute fraction of the data
being transmitted. It won\'t work for covert transmissions, because to
get an effective data rate, you need the "basse" signal that you are
modifying to have hundreds to *thousands* of times the data  "content".
That makes the base signal *way* too "loud" for anything normal.

Won\'t work. That would require the receiver to know the characteristics
of the *unchanged* "noise". Which it *cannot* know. And as I noted, it
also requires *such* an *amount* of noise that it\'d be suspicious as hell.

AAgain, spread spectrum disguises the *fact* that there\'s a
transmission by spreading it over lots of frequencies. This is
*currently* used by the military for reasonably secure tactical radio
links. Hand held radios that are *very* hard to *detect* much less
listen to.

Real world implementations seem to favor using only one frequency at a
time, but changing rapidly and (apparently) randomly. Among other
things, this actually lets everal sets of users share the *same* set of
frequenciesd without anything more than an apparent increase in
background noise. 

Say you have 256 frequencies, That gives 8-bits to id the frequency. So
your "key" is a list of all 256 numbers well "shuffled" (ie scrambled
into a random order in which each number appears only once). 

Say the first dozen numbers in the list are:
1: 32
2: 167
3: 223
4: 187
5: 205
6: 19
7: 126
8: 117
9: 28
10: 244
11: 181
12: 137

so the transmitter will use frequency #32, then #167, then 223, then
187, etc. Each frequency is used for a fraction of a second. 

The way the clock comes into it is like this. Say each frequency is
used for .01 seconds. So the transmitter takes the current time in
hunmdreths of a second modulo 256 (ie gets the time, and figures out
what the remainder is after dividing by 256). It then uses that number
as the starting point in the list of frequencies. So if it got a
remainder of 8, it\'d start the transmission with channel 117, followed
by ch 28, then 244, etc.

The *actual* rate at which it changes frequencies will be something not
a bit more random (ie .009543 sec or .00123476 sec). Again, both ends
have to agree on the interval.

In this case the signal *is* being "added" to any existing background
noise. But unlike your idea of modulating the background noise (which
requires that both ends know what the *unmodulated* noise looks like),
this just relies on the fact that to anybody following the same shift
pattern, the background noise is "random", but the desired signal
*isn\'t*. Somebody using the same 256 channels and the same switching
interval but a different list order will not see any "signal" from you,
just static (and not as much of that as you\'d expect!). 

So not only is it hard to detect, it\'s quite secure too! The army\'s use
for tactical comms is based on the fact that while a *good*
multifrequency monitoring setup could record the channels, it\'d take
them hours to days to find the "key (the list of fequencies and the
order that they are used in). And by that time the info is useless.

For the bugs, the good part is that the transmissions are hard to
*detect*, much less decode. Detecting a spread spectrum unit will tend
to be about one TL harder than building a unit. That is, A TL 10 unit
can only be detectd by TL 11 or better.

That\'s the *standard* means of relaying phone calls in Alaska these
days. The standard commsats are too close to the horizon.

But it\'s not at all stealthy. It\'s just using the ionization trails to
give the signals something to bounce off of, so they can be relayed
over the horizon.

Actually, a second is *way* too long to stay on one frequency. You\'d
get recognizable bits of sound. That\'s why the real units switch dozens
to hundreds of times a second. With my example of 256 channels and a
.01 sec switch rate, you\'d get .01 sec of the sound every 2.56 seconds.
That\'s *not* going to be recognizable.

Heck even with say 32 channels and a 1/20 sec switch rate you get
1/20th sec of "signal" every 1.6 seconds. Not exactly recognizable,
unless you feed in a pure tone that\'s fairly loud.

Afraid not. The real world systems are already too complex to attack
that way. What you do is have your ELINT (ELectronic INTelligence) gear
lok for patterns in the static and correlations among different
frequencies. 

In the specific case of bugs, it gets easier. A constant transmission
spread spectrum bug can be detected by simply going into the area to be
checked and using a tone generator to generate a constant frequency
sound. Then you look for "noise" at that frequency on the multiple
bands you are monitoring. That gives you a list of *potential*
frequencies. That is, frequencies a bug *may* be using if there is
indeed one present. Then you change the frequency and see if any of the
frequencies still show a correlation. If so, you have likely found a
bug. Try a few more pure tones, and you\'ll have the channels *probably*
IDed. Next you try tones that vary smoothly, and with luck, that\'ll let
you pin down the order in which the channels are used.

Of course, the "burst" mode transmissions make this harder, as do
elementary precautions like doing a *simple* encryption on the input to
the transmitter so that the pure tone comes out scrambled. Burst mode
has a problem in that *because* it has "saved up" the data, it requires
more bandwidth, which makes it more likely that the "noise" wiull be
enough loudr than normal that someone will get suspicious.

But this is *not* subject to roleplaying, beyond the "sweep the room
for bugs" level. It\'s not anything that humans would be doing. They\'d
just be running the "sweeper" gear and seeing if it finds anything.

Heck, even if you can\'t *find* the bug, but you suspect that an area is
bugged, the classic trick is to feed some false data (or real data that
you canafford to compromise, but that the other side will "have to" do
something about) to confirm it. 

That\'s the trouble with intelligence gathering. Especially "bugs",
agents in place, and decrypting "secure" traffic. If you *use* the
info, you risk making the enemy wonder just how it was that you knew
the info. A few times they *may* decide it\'s "bad luck" but more often,
they\'ll start looking for leaks (even if there *aren\'t* any, which is a
great way to distract players. :-)

BTW, *Jamming* Spread Spectrum gear is effectively impossible unless
you are a government, and jamm so throughly that radio cannot be used
at all. The frequency hopping makes jamming *quite* ineffective. But to
get past *powerful* jamming, requires enogh signal strength to make the
transmitter obvious.

"Screening" (faraday cages and the like) can prevent signals from
leaving an area *totally*. It\'s just hideously expensive and
inconvenient.

But you can oull tricks like have noise that\'s related to to comon
"sampling rates" of audio gear such that it is merely annoying to
people but renders a digital recording useless due to aliasing effects.

Ahem. That\'s "next door", not "next store". :-). Bet the idiom makes
more sense now.

Acyually one of the simplest means of defeating high-tech surveilance
is also one of the easier ones. 

You\'be ugged the conference room of the uunderworld bosses, and you sit
there eagerly awaiting the first transmission. It comes thru and
everyone is sitting there is shock.... 

Not because of the content of the meeting, but because the bosses are
all speaking some language the players don\'t know! It could be as
"simple" as a regional dialect on the planet the organization started
on (think of the "Mafia" and Sicily/sicilian). Or it could be an
"evovled" form of some "thieves cant". Given the length of time the
Imperium has been around, and various other cvilizations, there\'s been
*more* than enough time for the slang/jargon ofa group to evovle into
an actual "secret language", and it doesn\'t even have to have been
deliberate.

Which is why one of the most foolproof bugs *known* is suborning

Also, their paranoia can work against them. Say they are trying to
smuggle something and a random ship encounter is with a customs cutter.
They may get suspicious right then. Have that trigger an extra thorough
search, and the players are quite likely to be *certain* that someone
talked. Especially if the GM uses some subtle nudges in that direction.

Suddenly a "random check" has become "evidence" that someone knows
their plans. 

Heck, I\'ve found that the hard part is keeping the players from haring
off on wild goose chases because of their paranoia to the detriment of
the adventure.

Well, that depends on what rules you want to use.

DGP had a trading program for the MegaTraveller rules (which are very
similar to the T4 rules).  I never got it, because I prefer my own
homebrew system. (Shameless plug follows)

I based my system on the Classic Traveller rules, where speculative trade
dealt in specific goods with varying proces and characteristics.  Not
liking being limited to just 36 goods, I created a modified system that
would let the referee generate a "Trade Table" for a planet, which
functioned like an Animal Encounter Table during game play.  You can find
the full details at
<www.interlog.com/~dmci104/GamingClub/Traveller/trade.html>

Noting that rolling up tables is boring, I expanded Metator to generate
trade tables as well as animal encounter tables. To make things as simple
as possible during the game, Metator has a one-page report giving the
referee everything he or she needs to handle a merchant: the die rolls for
freight and passengers, with DMs, local currency values (and both official
and \'street\' exchange rates), and the trade table.

This means that during a game the referee must make 6 dice rolls for
passengers and freight, with another dice roll for cargo _if_ the players
find some. In a way that\'s a lot of dice, but all the numbers are there in
front of you so there\'s nothing to look up, and you can preroll most of
them -- and fiddle the rolls for maximum adventures as well :-)

 Actually, check out Tommy Grav\'s website, and specifically his shipyard
files, at:

  http://www.ifi.uio.no/~tommyg/Trav/Trav_equip.html

 for his Anderson-class freighter. It looks rather like what you are
suggesting, though he uses 50-DTon containers.

  Speaking of Tommy Grav\'s site, I can\'t seem to find the deckplan
file for his Hawk-class liner. Has anyone seen this?

I\'m glad you liked it. I agree (going to a bookmarked site happens less

And if you want another idea.... publish and expand the 1105 to 1115 TNS
news reports as a referee\'s aid. My favourite MT supplement was a TNE one -
*Survival Margin*, the perfect referee\'s resource to get the players
feeling it\'s happening out there...

I discussed something like this with Andy Lilly a while ago - making the
101 books available over the web with a credit card order. However we
decided against it in the end due to the risk of piracy  of the material
:-< Even with passworded files it\'s too easy. Photocopying a book is much

Acrobat has many attractions - it\'s designed to publish material
electronically, it\'s cross platform, it compresses nice and small and most
importantly, it retains the original formatting. You *can* set it up to
allow cutting and pasting of text and graphics, or the addition of notes.
And it\'s really easy to generate.

I don\'t see what the difference is between a printed acrobat file and a
normal adventure book of the type we are discussing.

Rob, it\'s going to be a while before you make Metator available for the PC,
so in the interim shouldn\'t it be possible to do a quick and dirty
spreadsheet to generate trade tables using your method?  Something in Excel
or 123 format could be read (or converted into something usable) by most
people.

Having been the one that broached the idea, I\'ve held off on replying to
see what everybody thought, and it looks like there might be a market among
the core audience..if the price is kept low and the quality is kept high. 
The economics still might not work, who knows just how big the core market
is and if it would fly outside the core, but as someone mentioned test
marketing and further analysis is called for.

When I brought this up it was in the context of GURPS Traveller..ie
something SJGames *might* consider.  I know they are marketing one
sourcebook only over the net and have expressed an interest in getting into
electronic publishing.  If SJG was the publisher of these "Traveller Net
Adventures" there would be a built in expectation of quality...SJG has a
good reputation for giving good value for the price...so the problem of
"browse before buy" might be considerably mitigated.  They also have most
(if not all) of the needed online commercial infrastructure to run an
enterprise like this.  It might, or might not, be within their license with
Marc. 

For non-GT timeline works (and I rather suspect we\'d want some of the
adventures to be generic to any timeline) someone holding a license from
Marc would have to be incharge.  This could be Marc, but I doubt he wants
to actually *be* the publisher, so it would have to be a licensee. Whoever
this is could probably arrange to sell through Hyperbooks.com as their
online storefront.  Convincing the market to buy would be harder for an
unknown company, though.

I agree about pdf, but I worry about the distribution of a commercial
product that is *too* easy to modify, copy, and covertly redistribute. <big
sigh> OTOH, pdf is a pretty universally available format.  This would be
another area to be worked out.  It might be a matter of trying different
approaches and seeing what (if anything) works in the market.

Loren, I know you\'re new to SJG, but what do you think about passing on the
idea, and expressions of support, to Steve Jackson for his consideration?

Marc, what do *you* think about this idea?  Is there any likelihood you
would, or would license someone to, try out electronic publication of
Traveller material?

Yes, it\'s a concern of mine too. I don\'t think anyone has come up with the
answer to the copy and redistribute problem, and that is going to delay and
if we don\'t find an answer, probably, kill commercial electronic
publication. Of course, it\'s the same problem electronic distribution of
software has been facing. The ultimate answer might have to be trusting to
the honesty of your customers...says Eris the cynic.

BTW, BITS/CORE could still sell over the web through hyperbooks.com,
discountbooks.com, titan.com, etc. The books wouldn\'t be on electronic
media, they would still be paper and would be shipped normally, only the
commercial transaction would take place online.  That might be the only way
some of us get a chance to buy CORE material.

All true, and pdf is the best format I know of for something like this.
OTOH, I can see distributing supplementry files along with the main pdf
containing things like charts and tables in tab delimited ascii, maps in
jpg (or whatever), and maybe the player section for direct printing. 

>I don\'t see what the difference is between a printed acrobat file and a

Distribution and production costs, potential market coverage. Oh, you mean
after the material is printed. ;->  Not much...real printing still looks
better than the printer output most people have, but not much.

<snipped>

>Eris

I don\'t know, as one who was asking about adventures to begin with I think
the idea may have some merit. As far as piracy go, there\'s no way to STOP it
and still have the material availabel and cheap. However, in my experience
(not with piracy, with gaming) most Trav groups are somewhat isolated
anyway, and typically only the ref buys the adventures/supliments, so, if
the price could be kept low enough, (the $2-3-4 range previously discussed)
it would probabbly be easier AND faster to purchase them. Some sharing will
no doubt go on, as it does today with printed material, but it might be less
than suspected.

As far as PDF format, I don\'t know enough about it to have a valid opinion.
It looks good on screen and printed. It can be cut and pasted (with the
right options enable). Hey, maybe that\'s part of the answer! If it can be
set up for passwords to enable the options, you give the
adventure/suppliment away, but charge for the print/edit password? Don\'t
know if it can be done that way but it has some potential.

They are the traditional Vilani symbol for multiplication.

That\'s my story, and I\'m sticking to it.

If that is the case, then I\'m fine with PDF, as long as it\'s done that way.
I very seldom run adventures stright from the book these days, and it\'s be
annoying to have to write extra notes the old way, when it\'s all on disk
ready to be edited.

I\'ve not play CT in over 10 years, I came to TNE 4 yrs ago after playing
Runequest for a long time.  But that\'s beside the point.  While coding
the T&C utility today, I came across something that I would like
clarified.
On page 236 of TNE in the Trade and Commerce Flowcharts, it mentions
that if the market world is a RED zone then there is a -8 DM, and no low
or middle passengers.  Does this guidline hold true for steerage
passengers?

I don\'t know the details of payments for Intelectual material on the
net, but I would pay for material, even if it had to be sent snail mail,
and I had to send a cheque to the seller.  
This holds true especially if the material is for TNE or generic, so it
can be modified to suit TNE.

It should be. As I said, all the details are on the web site.  Feel free,
Eris.

I may be able to find me a 486 computer which will let me write Windows
software.  This may speed things up a bit.  

Failing that, it would make a dandy summer project using my Dad\'s
computer. So, although it\'s a sacrifice, if the TML demands that I visit
the West Coast again and suffer a surfeit of Mom\'s cooking while being
bothered by whales and eagles, and that damned salt tang with the bloody
breezes whispering through the cedars, well, I guess as a loyal Traveller
fan I\'d just have to go. :-)

Well, it\'s the same problem NON-electronic distribution of software faces,
and music, and videos and...and...and... Point is, we don\'t see _those_
kinds of publications being killed, do we? Piracy is a problem, but it
really isn\'t the crippling problem it\'s made out to be (after all, despite
huge problems of piracy, Sony Music certainly managed to make a
bucket-load of money last year...)

Part of the problem may be the way people look at the problem. People
copying such books are unlikely to be paying customers anyway, much like
software warez collectors, you know the 14-year old kids with 4 Gb of
software they haven\'t got a clue how to use or any desire to learn...it\'s
just another trophy in their collection. 

Being a _very_ satisfied customer of BTRC\'s electronic formats, I will say
I\'m quite willing to consider buying electronic forms of books and
supplements.

The advantages of electronic publishing are hard to beat: instant
gratification for your customers (or as instant as their modem lets them
be ;-), close to zero production costs beyond the original book layout (if
you\'re web based, your costs amount to printing the book to Adobe Acrobat
instead of a printer, and spending an hour or so setting up a web page).

The only cost you have to bear is paying the credit card companies their
cut, maintaining a secure web site, and the costs with actually producing
the content...which, in the case of books and the kinds of adventure
supplements we\'re speaking of here, are dwarfed by the costs of producing
and distributing a paper based product. (that\'s why I STILL can\'t easily
buy BITS products here in the states.) 

Y\'all at BITS might want to consider the fact that electronic publishing
will get you sales you won\'t get, anyway, in paper form, due to
distribution costs.

	I wouldn\'t go so far as to say it\'s ready to be edited. If the file is
created with the right options, you can copy straight text (losing the
formatting), or images, out of the file. It still won\'t be convenient for
full-scale rewriting.

    Yes!  This would be extremely useful!  I have an old Mac PowerBook I use to
hold all my written notes for my campaigns and such during play.  Having a

I meant that at least it\'s on the machine. Even with loss of the formatting
cut-and-paste is much, much better than hours of copy typing.

Absolutely. When someone copies a book, that\'s a book that the publisher
didn\'t get paid for. Lost sales mean the profit margin is slimmer, and result
in less money for other products. Take this to too big an extreme, and there
is a technical term for this that I learned at a Dogbert Business Seminar(tm):
"Death Spiral.

That\'s why all of us "Traveller Grognards" have been pestering you and Mr.

 MT Imperial Encyclopedia, page 94 has the following allegiance codes
 in addition or in conflict:

 As - Aslan New Lords
 Bw - Border Worlds
 Da - Darrian Confederation	[conflicts with Da = Daibei]
 Dr - Droyne World
 Fa - Federation of Arden

 TNE uses LI to indicate Lucan\'s Imperium - perhaps this idea could be
 reused for the Rebellion, ie,

 Di - Dulinor\'s Imperium
 Mi - Margaret\'s Imperium
 Si - Strephon\'s Imperium
 
 this would emphasise the "shattered imperium" nature of the rebellion
 era.

 as noted, Da is already in use for the Darrian Confederation, perhaps
 Db for Daibei?

I agree.  Either reprint the books so loyal fans can buy what they
missed, or shut up about circulated photocopies.

Exactly.  Let\'s look at it this way.  You/We/Whatever would be turning out
reasonably priced adventures to a very select group of people (Traveller
players).  They would have some cross genre appeal possibly, but it isn\'t like
everyone\'s going to be knocking down the door to pirate the thing.  In
addition, since this group of Traveller fans is probably a good portion of
the Trav fans on the internet, any attempt at pirating the software on the web
would come to somebody\'s attention at some point.

Other than that, you\'re not going to stop people from giving it to their
friends, and nor should you.  It\'s wasted time and effort.  People are going
to copy music CDs to tape, photo-copy useful articles from magazines, and give
software to their friends to copy.  Legal or illegal, right or wrong, it is
happening and will continue to happen.  Personally, I think that this idea is
fantastic and would like to participate in it, as an adventure or supplement
author or whatever.  I would also be willing to put up money to start the
business.  My money is meager, but I\'d really like to see this happen and get
off the ground.

J-Man,

I can understand your fustration, and I\'m sure Loren can as well. However,
this is a bit of over reaction IMHO. Loren is talking about the thing that
puts food on his tables. I can understand his point of veiw, and I think you
can as well, and he can understand yours (I beleive I read an article once
that talked about the original GDW group using photocopied D&D rules until
the books became available). This is no reason to be so abrupt to him
however. He has bent over backwards, far far more than many, in any industy,
to provide information to the members of this List, and should be thanked
for it, not snapped at because he can\'t take a very substabtial financial
risk to reprint books you and I would like to have, but are only (be
realistic now) valuable to a very small market.

Truth be told, there\'s been enough mention of piracy (of commercial
products) on this list that if he or any of the other authors wanted to
cause problems they certainly could!

On the main subject of this thread... What would it take to get a licence
for web publishing? Does the application go to Far Frointer Enterprises? or
to IG (considering their current unknown status, probably not, but...) and
what does such a licence cost and entail?

As far as a web re-print of Shadows (by the way Rob the graphics are great,
however...) this involves GDW the original author (I don\'t have the book any
more so I can\'t look it up), and any number of other tangles. I\'d think a
totally new adventure might be a better choice. Anyone out there got
something appropriate?

What I envisioned was large pre-packed containers being shuttled into

started to prepare for jump.

That\'s because your musical tastes don\'t include... The Ramones!

RAMONESmania (1988) is *76:03* long, and it plays fine on my Sony 10-disc
changer, Yamaha carousel, and Toshiba x4 & x24 CD-ROM drives (haven\'t tried
it on the HP7100 yet).  Anyone care to guess how many tracks?


Oh, and if you use Windows \'95, might I suggest grabbing a copy of
NotifyCD?  This little bit of *freeware* takes up a minuscule amount of
screen real estate (ie: it resides in your system tray just like the normal
Windows Audio Player) and includes an internet link capable of pulling CD
data from a library of thousands.  Just pop in a CD, connect to the net,
and it will query the nearest database.  If the data exists, NotifyCD\'s
library file will automatically be updated with album title, song titles,
etc.  The CDDB server gets over 400 new entries each and every day and I
haven\'t had to input my own data yet (and I listen to some pretty weird
stuff).

  As much as they need, as far as interstellar goes. Isn\'t that the

the appropriate politcial decision making level if you make sure the
muckrakers never get through your cordon. Security, right?

  Actually, I just read the JG adventure "Tancred" that I ordered from
Titan Games (www.titan-games.com) for the low price of $4 new, and it
has lots of the above elements in it. Planetary unrest, a political
scene where all is not as it seems, typos, terrorism, firefights, more
typoes (sic), miscellaneous gratuitous violence, and lots of opportunities
for exploring the limits of the Imperial Rules of War - like house to
house clearance supported by 120mm SP gun-howitzers. Order it - you know
you\'ll like it :)

Looks very much like I can (provisionally, of course ;-) say "I told you so."

I would suggest that the above communication suggests strongly that T4.1 will
never be published *by IG* ... and that, increasingly, the near term future of
Traveller will be with GURPSTrav.

You probably weren\'t around when Marc posted this, so I\'ve taken the liberty

From: CardSharks@aol.com
Subject: Re: Trade or Sell

Once upon a time, when D&D was still new, just about everyone at GDW made
aphotocopy of the basic D&D books because they were not yet available in
evnough volume for everyone to have their own copy.

Once the sets became available, we all went out and bought them and discarded
the photocopies... which were just inferior.

If someone makes a photocopy for his or her own use, that is called fair use,
as long as it\'s not the whole product, and as long as its not for resale.
That includes copying someone else\'s copy of the product.

That is especially true if the product itself is not currently available (ie
CT or Mt, probably not for T4).

When someone starts photocopying multtiple copies for others, then it gets to
be infringement.

Personally, if you want a specific work which isn\'t in print and you can get
a photocopy, I think that\'s OK.

My reply wasn\'t aimed at Loren, and perhaps I should have made that
clear.  My problem is with materials that are almost impossible to get a
hold of, which are never going to be re-released because of the reasons
you mention above.  Marc himself said that using photocopies was fine
with him, a few months ago when this topic came up last.

No one wants \'photocopies\' as a final result, but with a finite amount
of real copies floating around, some of us will HAVE to be satisfied
with them or NOTHING.  To me, "Nothing" is unacceptable.  Classic
traveller was done very well IMHO and I really didn\'t see any need to
change it or stop making it.  Those decisions were made by others and I
am powerless to change that fact.

I may buy new Traveller stuff like the upcoming T4.1, but only to use as
ideas for my own classic Traveller games.  I\'m sure others on this list
have their own preferences as well.

I am all for photocopies if real material cannot be had, I am NOT for
piracy, i.e. copying an author\'s hard work and selling it to others.  I
used to be a pretty heavy software pirate and hacker back in the very
old days (mid to late 80\'s) but since then have changed.  I firmly
believe that when an author has created a product people find extremely
useful, they have a right to be justly compensated for their hard work
and effort.

For example, who here knows of a Telecom program called "Telemate"? 
Back when I used to do the local BBS scene, I used this program
heavily.  It was shareware, but the author chose not to disbale ANYTHING
in it.  One could use it forever and never register it.  I found this
program so useful I felt strongly that I needed to compensate the
creator for writing such a useful program.  I paid the 35 dollars and
felt good about it.

I have used programs, however, that were not worth anything, and have
erased them.  Sometimes I found useful programs I liked, but because the
shareware version was handicapped, I erased the program and used
something else.  Certainly the author that does no cripple his software
takes a big risk, but rather than believing people are generally evil
and will not pay for things, I choose to think that the core of users
who do not pay are a small minority.

Well, I think I\'ve wasted enough bandwidth on this subject.  :)

Ahem. A little vituperative that. And unnecessary.

The context of the discussion was about BITS distributing books
electronically. The earlier discussion did mention CT in passing. And I
seem to recall Marc allowing people to copy CT/MT material if they can\'t
get hold of it on the basis that they will get it when they can. No-one has
slammed people obtaining copies of the out of print material for their own
use. The criticism has been directed at people copying/distibuting
currently available material, specifically with regards to the effects of
publishing current work electronically.

That\'s right - I\'ve seen whitish-blue stuff, too, now you mention it.

So I figured. Still, if there\'s bluish-white stuff, that\'s toward the high
frequency end of the spectrum, with the more-common greenish-white stuff
below that, suggesting to me that pale yellow, orange and pink stuff ought
to be possible - indeed they ought to glow more brightly, for longer
periods, if I understand you correctly.

Makes sense. This would also seem to suggest that my theoretical pale
yellow, orange, and pink stuff would actually be *brighter* than the green
stuff, if it existed. Hmmmm...

>This is also why you don\'t get bright or "saturated" colors. 

Gotcha. The stuff is gonna be pale, whatever the frequency.

>To get what you\'d like there\'d have to be a power source *somewhere*.

Right. Electroluminescent paint would be cool. It\'s canonical, too: on page
66 of T4 Book 1, under "Display Screens", Greg Porter nicely describes how
the "electrical conductors and luminescent elements are sprayed on in
layers." (Ghod I luv Greg\'s equipment write-ups.)

I just think the photoluminescent stuff is neat because it\'d be cheaper and
wouldn\'t require such elaborate application technology. Just a spray can.

Yikes. Good point.

I\'ve written up my conception of glow-in-the-dark "lightpaint", which I\'ll
be posting soon (along with a huge whack of other nifty gadgetry). I figure
that the half-life can be longer at higher Tech Levels.

>(BTW, try

More fun with blacklights: I knew a guy in high school who painted weird
and obscene graffiti all over the basement rec-room - graffiti his parents
couldn\'t see because he used UV paint. When the parental units were away,
he and his friends would switch on their UV lamp and smoke up, surrounded
by trippy graffiti. Some day someone\'s going to install a fluorescent lamp
in that room and get the shock of their life.

Thanks for the comments, Leonard, I knew you\'d have some coherent answers.

Well for the last couple of months Myself and a few others have been slowly
working on a sourcebook for the Spinward Marches in M:0 which is intended for
free electronic publication. It was always intended to include a brief
adventure in it. The adventure is only very briefly sketched, but it involves
a Luriani musician, the search for a lost colony, Imperial intrigue, Vargr
merchants and corsairs etc.

Bruce, this must be some usage of the word "lossy" that I am not
familiar with. Both GIF and PNG are zero loss compression formats.
JPEG, on the other hand *is* lossy.

So is Fractal compression.

Taking another look at my figures. I have *one* byte per sample. That\'s
8-bit *mono* sound. Also, the biggest WAV file I have is only a couple
of meg and plays for at least a minute (I don\'t have  sound card
installed right now so I can\'t check). I\'d try defragging the drive and
trying again. It\'s also quite possible that the recording software has
a stupid limit like that. 

Anyway, 16bit *doubles* the size. Stereo doubles it again.

A lot depends on the atmosphere. Without an atmosphere the level of
detail you can pick up is limited only by the size of the sensor array.

But here on earth, even from a low" orbit you aren\'t going to be able
to resolve details much less than a foot acroos. At the outside you\'d
be able to tell whether or not a car had a license plate, but not what
state, much less what the number was.

For IR, being underground or underwater helps. The deeper you are the
more spread out the resulting "hot spot" is.

Reality check: Middle Class (SL 7) would spend 7^2 * 100 = Cr4900 per

Cr200/month. So a middle class person would spend 4% on food, 4% on
accomodations and 92% on other things.

How about SL+2 * 50 as the minimum to keep up standards, with people
usually spending about SL*10% more if they have the money (With SLs 
above 10 completely outside this system, since people can spend an
enormous amount of money if they have it).

I agree that a fixed spending requirement for the highest social levels (above
SL 10 I\'d say) should either be much higher or (my preferred solution) very
much up to the Referee and the player, perhaps with a few rules of thumb in
the rule book. But I couldn\'t help noticing that you put Princess Diana\'s SL
at 14. This is a perfect example of a problem I\'ve brought up several times
before without getting any response. (At least, I think it is a problem).
How can a relative of the constitutional monarch of a single country on a
balkanized planet be one social level above the ruler of an entire world?
(an Imperial marquis is SL 13, right?). How many social equals do Princess
Diana have on Earth? We have between one and two hundred countires on Earth,
IIRC. I\'d guesstimate that close relatives of rulers of countries would run
to more than a thousand. Do you really mean that a planet, even a high-
population planet, could have more than a thousand peers of Imperial counts?
The Moot would get awfully crowded if they all attended, wouldn\'t it? And if
only a tiny fraction of SL 14s actually sat in the Moot (say, one in a
thousand) don\'t you feel that there would be a percieved difference in
importance between the 1 and the 999? And shouldn\'t an Imperial Marquis who
sat in the Moot be of a higher SL than a so-called SL 14 who didn\'t?

I don\'t see how you can possibly justify giving Princess Diana a higher SL
than 11 under the present system. Which I concede is completely inadequate,
but that\'s precisely why I think 17 social levels are too few to span the
huge gap between the Emperor and the lowest outcast in his Imperium.

I\'d suggest giving anyone who roll a 12 a fifty-fifty chance of improving
that to a 13; if he makes that, he get another fifty-fifty chance of
improving that to a 14, and so on until he either misses a roll or hits
whatever ceiling the Referee decides to impose ("I\'m not having Norris\'

I posted my suggested social scale just the other day, so I won\'t repost it
it right away, but I wound up with 33 classes (with the Imperial nobility
running from 24 to 33, of which several of the Imperial ones were made up
to make each of the official Imperial titles map back to the official SL if
you divided by 2 and rounded up.

Here\'s an excerpt from my article about nobles ranks:

"...problems arose when dignitaries of different planets came into contact
with the interstellar society of the Imperium and, through it, with each
other. How did one decide the precedence of the Grand Director of Vilis,
the Speaker for All the Tribes of the Grundish Steppe on Sorel, a Commander
of a Thousand Sails of the Southern Archipelagic Confederation on Overnale,
and the Lord High Syndic of Thorshavn on Marastan? And of course things got
even more complicated when the same titles were used for positions of
vastly different importance. The Duke of Troura, however sovereign a ruler
of his few thousand square kilometers on Tirem, was certainly not the
social equal of Duke Lionel du Nord, Regent of the Rheltan Highlands on
Caledonia, even though Duke Lionel was a vassal of the King of Caledonia;
and neither of them were the equal of the Duke of Deneb [...]

The Imperium had solved this problem by creating the Imperial Office of Arms
(IOA). This was ostensibly an Imperial department for the registration of
heraldic coats of arms and equivalent devices, but in reality their most
important function was to evaluate local titles, offices, and positions and
translate them into equivalent Imperial social positions. On the
recommendation of the IOA the holder of a given title, office, or position
automatically recieved a knighthood in an appropiate Imperial order. This
just as automatically gave him or her a fitting position in Imperial
society.

There were a large number of Imperial orders of knighthood. Some of these,
like the Most Valorous Order of the Emperor\'s Guard (E.G.), the Most
Courtly Order of the Starship and Crown (S.C.), the Most Illustrious Order
of the Arrow (O.A.), and the various orders of the domains were used to
reward individuals for service to the Imperium; they were not normally used
just to grade local planetary dignitaries. For this purpose the most
commonly used were the Most Excellent Order of the Third Imperium (T.I.),
the Most Distinguished Order of the Golden Sun (G.S.), and the Most Exalted
Order of the Star of Sylea (S.S.) (The last should not to be confused with
the Most Noble Order of the Domain of Sylea (D.S.))."

I would like to see them as well... since I don\'t clearly remember them even
being in the little black books.

Meanwhile, here\'s what I think they should be.

1. Identify all HiPop worlds in the sector with TL 9+.
2. Identify all Rich Worlds.
3. Trace routes of J4 or less connecting those worlds.

Each world should have no more than three routes going to it.
If connections aren\'t possible, trace through intervening worlds.

So the skills have been collapsed from the ones I expected, i.e. turret

The only problem this represents for me is; is there a seperate skill for
repairing and/or maintaining these items?  Or can a machine gun armorer

"Battlefield Armor" is (I would think) a tracked vehicle with a gun turret.

There are numbers in FFS2 on sensor resolutions. From orbit, most military-
quality starship sensors are pretty good - at the "read the newspaper over
your shoulder" level or past it. They can pick up "life forms" and
"energy sources" throug the infrared radiation they give off. 

That\'s not to say the sensor can find (for example) a particular individual;
there\'s a lot of area to scan/process. You really need to know where to look,
and make a good sensor roll.

TIA,

Below the water is probably the best; water is pretty opaque to these
sensors, and waste heat gets carried away by the water. Underground, the main
problem is hiding the exhaust vents (waste heat again...) but it would still
be very hard to find the target. Since this is all just light, thick enough
vegetation would work too (although active sensors would penetrate some
thickness of plants - active sensors are basically radar.) Again there\'s 
the waste heat problem - a big fusion plant will stand out unless you can dump
the heat into a really big river.

>genetically manipulated plants?

How about plants that store heat during the day and release it at night
so they look like a target on IR sensors?

There are also neutrino sensors, which can see a fusion plant through *any*
thickness of rock or ice - they\'re generally very short ranged, imprecise,
and expensive. There are rules for them on the FFS2 errata site.

T4.1 is the working name for the major revision/overhaul that Marc is doing
of T4.  He has been kind enough to post sections of the rules here for
commentary and critique, to try and avoid the problems we had with the
first T4 book.  

T4.1 isn\'t avalible yet, as it is still a work in progress.

You know, this gives me a fun idea for a scenario..  When the railroads
were pushing west, towns would compete vigorously to become county seats,
since that guarnteed that the railroad would come to them (bring lots of
revenue).  Picture the competition in Deneb to become one of the
intervening worlds in a long "dry stretch" of space.  Lots of oppotunities
for bribery, trade, and sabotage.

My original line of thought when I posed the comparison between Diana
and Sadam was,  does the amount of spending equate to greatness in
everyones minds ???  IMPO, I don\'t think it does. I quess I was off
topic when I posed the question. Sorry !!
 SL in Traveller then IMO becomes a question of luck of the draw (die
rolls). Not everyone who attains a *title* is or will necessarily be
deserving of the title.
This would apply to any era of the game, be it CT, MT, TNE, T2300, T4 or
any other version or cross version used.

I agree with all of the above. I have a lot of the old material (not
all) which I will share provided I do not set myself up for a law suit
in so doing. Thanks to many persons on line, access to *new* older
material is available out there. Thanks to Mr. Lindsay of Vancouver and
Sentry Box in Calgary, I now have purchased originals , Darrians, COACC,
Regency Sourcebook and MT Diaspora Sector. So persevere, and if it is
truly not available on the market, I\'m sure a copy will be allowed.

On an aside topic. If anyone has Darrians or is knowledgable on the
subject, I need some help. Under character generation cascade skills on
page 29 it shows Talent: ....., but nowhere in the MO, AS or High Guard
tables nor in the preamble have I read where that comes available. Was
there a misprint or did I miss it. And any who have used the module, how
did you treat it. I wasn\'t aware before now that the Zho\'s territory
extended so far rimward. I really have to get data on the Far Frontiers,
Foreven and Vanguard Reaches Sectors. Can anyone give me some leads??? 
Also there is a disagreement with regard to additional ship benefits in
the MO tables page 28, and the preamble on page 27, Material Objects:
Starships, last line.

Thanks for your help

I have seen it used in many colors, and it glowed very brightly to a
*black light* stimulant when other lights in the room were dimmed.
Otherwise it was not eveident unless pointed out by a knowlegeable
person. It was/is used by model railroaders to simulate night time
scenes on their layouts (worlds). To the best of my recollection, it was
first used and written about for the MR application by a chap in North
Vancouver. If you have a modeller close by, ask them.
As to what makes it work, those here have more knowledge than me.

30 would be the correct guess (based on an average of 2:30 per song).  They
do have one other CD with *32* tracks on it, so that CD might be even
longer than 76:03.

It depends on what you call \'good\'. Subscribe a try it out.

To subscribe send \'subscribe traveller\' in the body to: majordomo@mpgn.com
I think.

Let me know how you get on. There are a large number of traveller webs

You won\'t find "updates" there, but you can ask Marc nicely and he will

You just love to stir up the pot, don\'t you Phil?  I still don\'t see the
reasoning behind repeated pessimistic comments when IG hasn\'t done anything
wrong /in the last few months/.  You *still* seem overly pessimistic about
IG\'s survival to me (or do you *want* IG to fail?).  Let it rest.  IG needs
optimistic support now if it is to survive.

G:T will be the future of Traveller only for those people running campaigns
prior to 132-1116.  Here\'s hoping that another company (BTRC?) will acquire
the rights to continue supporting the Rebellion, Virus, and/or Milieu
eras...

SNIP

In combat terms we know that 10 SDB = 1 Attack factor, but cost more 
due to jump drives ... let us use a further factor of two for this.  We 
can either do the conversion based on CruRon Attack factors, or just 
use a standard conversion for any world:

CruRon basis
============
1 squadron = (P-2+M) x 10 SDB\'s


"Standard" conversion
=====================
1 squadron = 70 SDB\'s

So, going back to the example of Olny, it could trade in 1440 of its 
1500 SDB\'s to "buy" 16 more squadrons (90 SDB per Sq) - a total of 
80 extra AF (if CruRons) or 56 AF (if BatRons) ... which is around half 
the "combat strength" the SDB force represented.  This seems about 
right to me.

Now Olny has 21 squadrons, rather than 5, which is within spitting 
distance of the 25 Sq I wanted to give to a war-mongering pocket empire 
like Olny.  Excellent!


SNIP

I must remind Simon and Rob that the the conversion is for Defense Factors,
not Attack Factors.  This would reduce the above listed attack factors by
half.  
Forty (40) for CruRons and twenty-three (23) for BatRons.

Hmm. Thanks for the responses. What I was looking actually wondering was
the reverse of this -- I would like to figure base spherical length
(diameter) and surface area from volume. So if I understand this, and I
reverse the formulas correctly, would this be:

radius = (cube root of (volume/pi/(4/3))

... and since radius is 1/2 diameter, multiply this by two to get hull
length for a spherical hull. Then multiply this by the Length Modifier (LM)
to get a rough idea of the hull\'s length by configuration.

Is this correct? :-)

I also am a great fan of electronic publications.  The printing costs are
quite extreme for conventional publications, and distribution puts some
products out of reach.  There does have to be a way to get a printed copy
easily, but if electronic publishing takes off, I am certain we will see
people who are willing to turn your electronic file into a physical book
quickly and cheaply.  The economies of scale for a single book vs. a large
run change dramatically if the intervention of a human can be eliminated.
After all, publishing on demand makes a great deal of sense if the original
has been properly proofread, and makes it much easier to avoid IG-style
snafus.  Further, there are a lot of people who could make a go of it as an
author if a POD system existed where "direct to printer" versions of a text
could be downloaded and printed.

There are issues, such as an instructor duplicating textbooks for a class
that are problematic, but this has been an issue for a while, and Kinkos,
at least, has learned how to stop it.  Similar techniques will work for
licensing POD work - it is not hard to stuff an authentication key into the
electronic file that will tell Kinkos what kind of license the person has.

I note that I bought a piece of software as a present electronically, and
would not have done so if said software was not electronically distributed.
 It was just easier to do, and the instant gratification made it easier to
acquire and give.  I also order from Amazon, and from Land\'s End for much
the same reason - I buy when I want to, and when I know the product meets
my needs.

As far as piracy goes, on some level, you do need to trust your customers.
I do believe that you should not deliver product until the customer pays,
as this stops a lot of shareware problems, but I have seen about as many
photocopies as electronic copies of things that should not be duplicated.
You cannot prevent illegal distribution anyway, and might make a fair piece
of change from being able to sell a product for a lower price and via an
easier method.

Corps is a neat system, and I will likely buy the critter because it looks
neat enough to have some benefits.  I would be less likely to do so if it
were a paper book - I just do not need it for the extra cash it would cost.

Minor problem from the analysis I did - SS9 is one standard deviation above
the average, which leads to an income on the order of half again as much,
not 20% above.  Similarly, you get about a third the income when you are at
two SDs below the average, so SS 5, which leads to a 45% drop under the
proposed system.

BTW, this look much more reasonable if you expand the scale in the manner
which you alluded to in another post - if the range of social standings
runs from more than 2 to 10, linear additive factors would be a better
approximation.

It looks like a log scale is almost certainly needed, and we merely need to
fix the endpoints and increment properly.  (Such an analysis in the real
world would be publication fodder for an economist.  :-)  )

All numbers from memory and an analysis I did based on US earnings, as
reported in the last census.  Check out www.census.gov, IIRC, for the
original data.

Interesting, How many people make up adventures as they go at least once in
a while?

I pretty much only GM, and I have entered upon evenings of Traveller with
no preparation whatsoever and played amazing adventures, and likewise fell
flat on my face.  Other nights have seen me develop intricate characters
and settings, convoluted plot lines, and suprise endings, only to be
accepted as \'yeah, that was all right.\'  At other times such prep work
resulted in truly neat role playing opportunities.

The amazing happens when I blunder through an evening, taking twists and
turns and ending up in a completely unexpected place, and one of my players
says "That must have taken you a long time to prepare." When I\'d made the
whole thing up from top to bottom.

My own conclusion; Develop the background - governments, companies,
characters, settings, villians, patrons - and let the plot happen in these
venues.

Ditto.

I like having my Traveller books in paper, but when I go the loacl gaming 
club I could have everything with me on my portable if electronic versions 
were available.  I can see several occasions when I would find this very 
useful.  And just think, in another 20 years when someone tries to get hold 
of an out-of-print T5 book, we\'ll be able to smile and say "you can buy that 
from www.MarcMillerMuseum/archive/e-book.html - still only $10".

The ice deposits (if any) are *very* small. They are confined to areas
in polar craters that *never* receive sunlight. That\'s because ice will
*sublime* (go straight from solid to vapor) in a vaccum except at
*very* low temps. 

The ice deposits are likely a *lot* less than even 1% of the surface
area, making the Moon have a Hydro of 0.

If anything the rules would have been in Book 6:Scouts, since that\'s
where the X-boat service was described. I can look when I
get home...OTOH, Marc just gave a pretty good rule, and since "What he
thinks it should be" tends to be what is...I\'d go with that.

T4.1 is the "code" name for Marc Miller\'s Traveller, revised.  It, as yet,
has not been published, and in fact is a work in progress.

Occassionally, Marc drops us a tidbit; a table or chart, a chunk of text,
etc. that he asks us to review and/or approve, generating probably more
discussion than he intended and, hopefully, a few useful remarks and errata
checks.

You can get the "official" errata at;
http://imperiumgames.com/errata.html

Your best guess is as good as mine of the last time it was touched.

Joe Heck\'s site has some more errata (some the same) at;
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/errata/

the T4.0 errata is also maintained at the Not The Imperium Games website,
which I couldn\'t find the address for after searching for a half hour or so
(hey! get on the webring guys!).

I saw more errata around, but mostly it was either specific to some other
work besides the T4 book, or was specifically "errata from the IG website".

GURPS seems to get prominent shelf space in the four game shops (as opposed
to hobby shops) within an easy drive of my home - in the Wash DC area...
GURPS\'s wide (wild?) variety of source books, I\'m told by retailers here,
is one of their big draws.  I do Wild West occasionally - though I don\'t
play GURPS, I do have their Wild West book.  I wonder how their Traveller
book will do if it\'s presented properly - that is, as a complete source
book, not simply as an alternate history to somebody else\'s game...  Of
course, I suspect mention will be made of the "Original" Traveller, to draw
the grognards in, but if you consider how well developed the Traveller
universe is, a very attractive stand-alone book could be done, if the
author knows his stuff (which if Mr. Wiseman is involved, will certainly be
the case...)

Hello Marc and list,
  Just out of curiosity, how does an X boat actually work?  I have always
thought that an X boat is a information dissembler first.  Also, I always
figured that it was based upon the fastest the jump drive could go at the
imperial tech levels.  Anything that requires a jump 2 or less to get to
should be regulated to scout packets or regular mail packets.  Anything
above that could be regulated by local fast boats.

  Overall, if I were the Emperor - trying to shave off as much time as is
possible would be my goal for those x-boats...

Well, I think the assumption for spacecraft sensors is damn near
diffraction limited (if not actually at diffraction limit).

Seeing through the atmosphere *down* is much better than up. Bruce,
what is adaptive optics seeing at these days? Some fraction of an
arc second. I could see it being maybe an order of magnitude better
looking down--so maybe headlines, anyway :-)

A ballpark I just did says that 14 point print would require seeing
on the order of 0.004 seconds of arc from 200km up.

Well, take a moon like Europa, a water world with little (if any)
atmosphere.

Right, the Moon would have a hydro of 0. Of course, Hydro 0 doesn\'t mean
NO water, just less than 1%..or the way I\'d define it, less than 1/2 of
1%, anyway.

A planet, or moon, in the outer system could very likely be a nice big
iceball composed *mainly*, but not entirely, of water ice. So, what do
would we call its Hydro? 

IMTU, I include the ice as part of the world\'s Hydro rating. YMMV.

Ah, yep! AND that\'s what the Ic is used for. ;->

What I do is rate the Hydro based on the coverage by H20 (in any form),
and add the Ic code to indicate that the water in the Hydro rating
refers to ice rather than liquid.  For example, in my AKUS MOBY game the
PC\'s are about to enter the Beck system. The main world (a moon) has a
significant Hydro rating, but it\'s all ice. So, they can check the Hydro
rating, see that water will be available for refueling, then notice the
Ic and deduce that they will have to *melt* the water before the can
take it aboard for processing.

(Putting on his Shadow-proof asbestos suit)

Sometimes, Leonard, you need to allow a handwave is just a handwave and may
not be "possible" based on what we know today, that said;

Take your top-secret recon satellite (or TL10+ equivalent), peer down at
our non-allies (or allies if you are Mossad) standing on the grounds of
their test facility with the blueprints to a new technology of rocket laid
on the table infront of them, "snick" take a picture.

Now, the distortion of 100,000+ feet of atmosphere will distort the image
so that you will need to feed it through the chaotic-correction-fractal
generator fill in software, but with a little computer time and, maybe, a
couple of extra frames of the same image, you build a picture of the plans
laid out so that you can duplicate them exactly down to the scribbled notes
of the Chief Engineer saying "what the heck is HEPlaR?".

C\'mon, A little imagination here?  Urban Legend (and some not perfectly
believable sources like Tom Clancy) say that the NSA\'s best toys can read a
newpaper *headline* from orbit, why can\'t we take it to it\'s logical next
step, within limits of physics and maybe a bit futher.  This is science
*fiction* after all.

I do appreciate your \'touch base with reality\' comments on many subjects
(especially my own gadgetry), but I think you need to loosen you\'re collar
a little sometimes.

Try "Some girls wander by mistake" by The Sisters of Mercy. That record is
79 minutes and 20 seconds long!

The generally accepted maximum length of a CD is 74 minutes (at least
that\'s what every recordable CD says). I do own a few records 75 or more
minutes long, though. Most of these have a rather high number of tracks
(between 15 and 20).

This accords with my own experience as a GM of ancient experience. However
I think it\'s more important for a GM to find their strength and use that as
the base of their story-telling, rather than to dogmatically follow a
suggestion on what GMing \'ought\' to be.

My strengths are sudden inspiration and characterising NPCs. I fall down
often with following plots through, or avoiding plot inconsistencies. To
cover these weaknesses I do tend to plan at least a rough outline of the
story from A to B and use my shorter-term creative abilities to produce the
actual routes from A to B.

If you\'re not good at going with the flow, you need to plan your stories
somewhat more thoroughly. This is not a bad thing: the central duty of the
GM is to coordinate the telling of a good story, and you can\'t do that if
you\'re floundering. Certainly you should practice ex tempore skills to
cover this weakness the same way I try to plan things better, but I do it
sitting firmly on my seat of comfortable, powerful GMing rather than
risking disappointing my players through failing experiments.

Turbulence looking up is much worse than turbulence looking down (the
"shower curtain" effect.) Depending on the details of the atmospheric turbulence
spectrum I believe one can generally do quite well, limited only by diffraction.
To the extent that you can\'t, adaptive optics and/or speckle postprocessing 
will work just as well looking down as up.

The Keck AO system is supposed to reach a resolution of 0.02 arcseconds.
Looking down should pretty much be diffraction-limited. Possibly I overspokes
slighlty about reading newspapers - but a medium sized military sensor should
have resolution at the half-centimeter level from orbit, or better.

	Geez,
	I think we need something new added to the FAQ on this one, right behind 0.1c
rocks, traveller economics and trading, and and......

	For reprints of the old Traveller material. It\'s being done, right now it\'s a
slow tedious process (traveller players being picky, I presume you want no
errata). If you want it faster join the CD project and work on it.

	Traveller adventures on disk. There\'s a couple on the CD (including some
rough drafts). Not many yet, maybe by next year. Format is text, but you get
what you give.

	Forms, there\'s some old forms on the disk, I just need to remember to try and
reformat them to RTF. If someone wants to volunteer to do PDF versions, I\'d be
happy to see them.

	So far I\'ve had permission from the Keith brothers, Judges Guild (thanks to
Jim), and GW to redo their stuff on the CD, so as soon as I can get those
digitized (which depends on time/volunteers) they\'ll be on the CD. Probably
next priority on the list will be FASA.

	I\'ve got other projects in the works, which depending on my copious free time
will eventually get done.

	Basically it comes down to if you guys what it, it can probably be done, but
just talking about it won\'t get you anywhere. It\'s out up or shut-up time
(figuratively speaking).

	So what do you want? And what are you willing to volunteer to get it done?

	I\'ve GOT TIRED over the last 9 months of seeing problems with IG, lack of
Traveller support, so on etc.....

	So over this time I\'ve started the TWG list to help better playtest the
material in an environment with less bandwidth devoted to other subjects.
	I\'ve got a new HIWG list up and running with new features. HIWG is being
revamped with new focus. I\'ve been in discussion with Andy Lilly among others
on supporting Traveller fandom.
	I\'ve had the not-IG list set-up and have many notions on expanding it (given
time and material).
	IG suspended Citizens, I\'m reviving it slowly under HIWG. Details are taking

getting the least of my time), who\'s ultimate goal is to try and make
everything from at least old traveller available (you might say the initial
release is something of a test, as much as it could use more work and material
I feel).
	I\'ve co-opted the T-tech list and the TNE-list as HIWG guilds to support
those areas (you\'re next :) ).
	I\'m trying to revive JTAS in some form or another. Because I think Traveller
needs adventure support. I even have some new artists lined up.

	I know Traveller fans are a terrific group, and can come up with excellent

Yeah, I was wondering the same thing.  Is it like mail routes?  If so, do
they actually ship packages or do they gather up digital data, pack it into
computers and transmit once they get insystem? Do the ships just go back and
forth between two systems (transfering packages and mail through a router) or
does the X boat travel the whole route?

Well, since any mac which can access a CD-Rom should have PC Exchange on
it already (since it\'s a standard piece of System software since 7.0) that
should be no problem. If you\'re burning a straight ISO9660 disk, you
should have Foreign File Access (also system software) installed as well.
I think, however, that it supports only the lowest of the ISO9660 format
levels (8+3).

Actually, most do have a rather detailed life history like this. My favorite
is from another character I rolled up at the same time as this one...

At the Age of 45 You Question Your Sexual Lifestyle, Role, or Orientation
At the Age of 46 You Question Your Sexual Lifestyle, Role, or Orientation
At the Age of 47 You Are Publicly Accused with a Crime

I think this is probably one of the potentially "fun" programs for Trav yet!
It\'s fun just to see how the character comes out and what sort of "history"
it fits to him/her.

If the idea is to avoid distributing digitized copies of publications in a
portable format like PDF, then I have a suggestion: 

How about the amazon.com approach, in conjunction with a fast 2-sided
printer and any local binding equipment (a stapler or just 3-hole punched
paper will do in a pinch) you have access to?  That is: 

1.  	Somebody browses your online catalog and decides to order a
	publication.

2.	They fill out a form and submit it to you.  The form contains
	their order information and telephone number.  They keep a copy of
	the form, of course (in cache, in file, by printer, etc.).

3.	In a day or so (you\'re *not* amazon.com after all, so no 5 minute
	callbacks), you call them or they call you (need an 800 line, I
	think that SJG already has one, or at least the infrastructure
	to do one).  If the customer indicates payment by mail, you just
	sit and wait for it to arrive (skip to step 5).

4.	Over the telephone the customer gives you a credit card number,
	and you confirm payment.

5.	Once payment is in your hand, then print, bind (stack on an 8.5 x
	11" piece of card stock), wrap, and ship the product.  The
	required equipment should require no more than 100 square feet and
	a modicum of capital if not already available.  This part won\'t
	work for amazon.com, but it could work for a business that does
	low volume.

Of course, it looks wonderful in email, but making it work in an existing
organization that is used to doing things differently is a lot harder. The
figures are probably hard to balance.  Nevertheless, it would be a great
way to distribute OOP material that\'s already set up in electronic form,
as well as "marginal profit" support materials for current lines. For
gaming lines with die-hard fans, you can probably find someone to digitize
the really old stuff for free.  I think that the idea must be practical at
some level.

(I should calculate the cost for one minimum-wage person to make, wrap,
and ship printouts for 40 hours a week, and figure out how many printouts
that would be, then go through overhead, plot a volume:price profit curve,
etc.)

Comments?

  Here is an idea that I would like to try out and see if anyone has the
time and/or inclination to bother with designing...

  Using HG,MT,TNE, and FF&S2, design the smallest legal X-boat ship (read
that as cheapest) that can carry 2 tons of high priority physical mail,
carry large amounts of data, and transmit data via secured communications
information carried in digital form - using Jump 3 drives, Jump 4 drives,
jump 5 drives, and Jump 6 drives - each based upon the top technology
usable at the TL when the jump drive is being made?  By this, if Jump 3
drives are TL 12, the the TL of the x-boat is 12.  If the top level for
Jump 6 is TL 15, then the ship may be made with TL 15 limits.

  The purpose of this "think tank" exercise is to show the likely
criterion for the design of a mass produced specialty ship most likely
used for X-boat routes.  It is assumed that these X-boat routes are
maintained by the Imperial funds, and run strictly as an Imperial
Governmental function (which incidentally permits commercial traffic when
space permits).

  Concept: if each x-boat center contains two tenders, and 8 cheap
X-boats, it concievably could carry daily traffic.  One per day, with one
ship being maintained as a replacement should mechanical difficulties
arise.  Each "space station" x-boat center contains facilities for
docking, data storage, crew facilities, and so forth.  Each X-boat
facility permits authorized ships to pick up data/mail/physical objects as
needed.  It is assumed that each facility is in an area of space that is
off limits to non-authorized ships, and as an Imperial agency, exempt from
mandated emergency rescue laws of ships in distress.

  The whole Idea here, is to calculate the maximum number of X-boat routes
required to get the maximum coverage needed.

  Also, as a question to you all for debate purposes... why can\'t the
imperium maintain deep space X-boat stations?  Why not make X-boat
stations precisely 4 parsecs apart regardless of whether there is a star
there or not?  Supply ships/tankers can drop of hydrogen fuel and other
supplies needed.  PE suggests that this can be done, so why not use this
approach for X-boat centers?

  Anyone want to calculate the "new" required times for information to
reach the outer limits of the imperium?  <grin>

  Just a few thoughts to share with you guys

     In Los Angeles, i\'ve found GURPS in a total of 3 places in maybe a 100
mile diameter.  Same with IG.  1 of these has closed its doors (if they
relocated, they didn\'t leave a note on the door).  TSR, WEG, FASA... i can
find all of these at a Walden Books or B Dalton and comic shops (add
Palladium...ugh... to the comic shops).  GDW too, once upon a time.  The two
closest FLGS to me have not had GURPS or IG.  Most of my players have never
heard of it.  
     I was looking through the new Star Wars stuff ("2nd Edition, Revised and
Expanded.")  That\'s some pretty sharp stuff...  looks nice... full color art
...  I look at the Babylon Project (also available at my local stores but not
IG and not GURPS)... the same.  Just imagine what Alternity is going to look
like, if it\'s going to look anything like the new AD&D hardbacks.  I\'d
recommend some full color art (not 70s Foss!) and quite thorough proofing and
such for T4.1 if it\'s supposed to draw a decent share of the market. 
     GURPS is quite well written, but not flashy.  I don\'t think it has to be
since it doesn\'t market to newbies.  I generally like the content quality of
GURPS but it\'s always seemed kind of bland to me.  I expect it will be up to
SJGs usual quality standards, even though the underlying concept of G:T still
leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Hah!  *I* will tell you!  They cannot stop me!

FNORD:  Manufacturer of high quality autoduelling vehicles, very popular
in the Republic of Texas and with AADA members everywhere.  This term is
ubiquitous in SJG literature and probably has several other context
dependent meanings to the Inner Circle as well.  You would do well to mark
all uses of the term, you never know when the information will be useful.

Loren *has* been hanging around SJG now, hasn\'t he?  I wonder how much he
has *seen*...

Leonard,

I didn\'t catch this when I sent it to the list. I do suppose Paul will have
to make a change. I was just amazed at the over-all scope of this character
as an NPC, money, power, titles, an MD, a diplomat, trader. This guy\'s been
through it all. I\'m planning on working him/her in as a major patron in my
campaign.

With the background in place, the players start generating their own plots
through their motivations. This is when stuff like 76 Patrons, 101
Cargoes/Plots/Rendezvous/Travellers/Lifeforms are at their most useful. My
last campaign had some big themes (a low level corp war between LSP and
Interstellarms, the brewing of the FFW and Twilight\'s Peak) but these were
really the backdrop against which the players interacted and played their
petty (but important to them) games. The one time I really prepared a
scenario (Shadows) they bypassed it.

I posted a similar, though less detailed, idea a week ago that only got one response
(title: CT Reprint Possibility).  The last auction posted on TML was getting bids of
between US$5-15 for Books 0-5 (with an average of $12 or so).  How many would buy at
$5?  Or $3 (Plus shipping, of course)?  I should think several more.  I simply
suggested that whoever has the copyrights (GDW or Marc) go down to the local
photocopy shop, run off 15 or so copies of each and have them bound (a quick and
easy drop \'em off, come back in two hours operation) - and offer them in bundles,
i.e., you can buy all 6 books for US$30 (plus shipping) - throw in another US$5 and
maybe Marc will break out some more of those maps up in storage.  Then wait for the
checks to come in.  Then send them.  Filling out shipping forms would be the only
real labor involved.  If interest is high enough, run off 30 or 50 sets instead of
15.

As many others have said, I\'ll take photocopies.  Happily.  The sooner the better.

Hell, send the books to me, Marc or GDW, and I\'ll do the work for US$1 - for as many
orders as would come about between now and August.

In general, given how bad I am at writing plots, especially for rpg\'s where
the characters are that much less predicable I \'wing it\' more often than I
really prepare. This isn\'t quite as true for Trav, as it doesn\'t seem to
grab my players as much as fantasy or \'softer\' sci-fi (they Space Master
for some ungodly reason, dammit), so I need more prep.

Pretty much the same here.

That\'s been my philosophy ever since I noticed that my having written a
plot produced far too much temptation to \'railroad\' my players everytime
the moved away from the script.

I was preparing to run the opening of the Traveller Adventure (using David
Summer\'s rules for GURPS Traveller) for my group when the player who
supposed to play the Vargr canceled out because of car trouble.

Quickly thinking I set the beginning of the campaign to two weeks before
001-1105 (the opening of the campaign)) on L\'oeul d\'Dieu. I winged pretty
much the whole adventure off a three line description of L\'oeul in the
Traveller Adventure. The summary can be read at

This is a result from my "Life Events" character background generation
system, which Paul implemented as part of his Beginnings program.

The idea with "Life Events" is that you\'re supposed to use it to jog your
imagination. You don\'t just use every result as-is. "At the Age of 62 You
Have an Experience Which Changes Your Worldview" - well, that\'s quite
plausible, but pretty vague. What experience? How did your worldview
change? You have to flesh it out.

If a Life Event doesn\'t make sense, you can just throw it out, or interpret
it as something that happened to someone close to the PC -- the PC\'s
parents, or spouse, or kids, or whatever.

I don\'t have Paul\'s program (I\'m a Mac person), so this is the first output
I\'ve seen from it. It looks like it could be very useful, but of course the
results need a lot of tweaking.

I can\'t say I like the repetitious "Your homeworld is..."/"You experience
a..." format. Seems highly redundant and unnecessary, IMO. Otherwise good,
though.

SJ Games News: Return of the Traveller News Service

    Traveller fans will remember that one of the best features of the Journal
   of the Travellers\' Aid Society was the Traveller News Service. Written
   in the form of a newswire, it reported the ongoing events of the official
   Traveller universe.

   Well, it\'s back.

   Loren Wiseman has hit the ground running, and the first GURPS Traveller
   material will be posted for playtest soon. And he\'s also picked up TNS
   where it left off in 1987, when GDW ended the "classic" Traveller continuity
   and moved into the Rebellion Era of MegaTraveller.

   Since GURPS Traveller is set in the official alternate history where
   the Imperium didn\'t fall, we\'re restarting TNS. As it did for almost
   20 years, it will tell the ongoing story of the universe of Strephon\'s
   Imperium.

   But now it\'s on the web. Loren Wiseman will be updating it regularly,
   and you can check out current events any time.

   It sent a chill down my spine when I read Loren\'s first new TNS dispatch
   (which you can find under "Previous Trasmissions" at the TNS site).

   I hope you enjoy this revival of one of gaming\'s classics as much as
   I do.

By "record", I assume you are referring to "vinyl"?

There are also a few CR-Rs out there that claim 78 minutes (or 680 MB).  I
do not believe that today\'s CD-R/CD-RW writers can handle them, however.

Oh, more RAMONESmania trivia.  That 76:03 CD contains 668 MB of data.

Well, when I posted that material I _had_ the permission of the copyright
holder, and I complied with all the conditions (I included the copyright
notice, and I\'m charging nothing).

I\'ve actually got legal permission to copy out-of-print Traveller material
from all the major publishers except FASA (I had permission, but when FASA
sold the rights to Seeker they revoked it). 

I\'ve been assuming that Marc is satisfied with this agreement, and hasn\'t
changed it. At least, he\'s never mentioned anything to me. I\'ve sent him
copies of everything I\'ve done, including full-size colour printouts of
the Shadows deckplans (although I didn\'t mount them on cardboard, to save
weight and postage).

Glenn,

I sent the "raw" output from Paul\'s program to the list, again, mostly
because I was so impressed with the character, a Count with an M.D., etc.
etc. I fully intend to flesh out the Life Events in the final product for my
campaign. Actually the out put, as is can be very amusing when read through
as it is produced by the program, and does present a very neat, taylorable
history for the character.

In this case I continued to "work" the character long after I normally would
have for a normal PC, the rolls were there and I couldn\'t resist. Truth to
tell I\'m surprised at how well his attributes held up concidering his "age".
This is atypical after a fair number of runs.

Paul has said that the program, as is, is the back works for a windows
program, so I imagine that the final version will have a different printout.
I haven\'t sent email to him directly yet, since I\'m still playing with it,
but I would suggest something like the shareware GURPS character generator
I\'ve seen that allows (I think) editing of the final character sheet as well
as embedding of a .gif or .bmp(?) picture of the character, chosen from the
generic line drawings from the GURPS mainbook, or will accept a user
supplied file within the same size parameters. While this isn\'t, strictly
speaking, necessary, it\'s a nice feature. I hope he will allow some type of
similar editing to the Life Events section of the final Character sheet(s).

Seriously, this is good news in that it clears up the problems I forsaw,
with contacting the copyright holder, etc. Sorry to hear about the FASA
stuff, they had some good works in there.

IMHO, I would think that the reason why is the same one that drives all
commerce in the real world - cost. I would assume that a deep space
installation would have a substancially higher overhead than one within a
planetary system since it would be far more expensive to send personnel and
supplies to it. In the case of a deep space installation, any supply ships
would have to be jump-capable, and would have to travel interstellar
distances. If a facility is within a planetary system, many of the supplies
(including fuel) could be transported by interplanetary, non-jump capable
shuttles and tenders at a signifigantly lower cost. The lower overhead could
allow for lower x-boat "postage", and/or higher operating profits.

Just putting my two cents in,

NPR are the initials of National Public Radio, a publically-supported

I kinda figured that. :-) I just thought it was pretty humorous that he had
his thingy replaced when he was a wee lad \'o 13, got fired a lot, and was on

I end up doing it often, but not all the time. I run a "matrix" 
campaign. In other words, I create a basic framework for the campaign 
and plot(s) as a whole, and specific scenarios for the situations 
that I feel that my players will most likely be involved in during a 
night\'s gameplay. When the players do something unexpected, I 
wing it, using the basic framework as a guide. When the players 
do something REALLY unexpected, I wing it to a greater degree 
and modify the framework accordingly. Most of the time I do alright 
with "making it up as I go", allthough there have been a few times 
when I\'ve gotten "writer\'s block" and had to end a game night early.

Someone has kindly crossposted a message evidently from the HIWG list that
*seems* to make it blindingly obvious that IG *has* folded ... no new products,
*ever*. Loss of license, which reverts to Marc (great news that! now we may see
someone who *has a clue* get T4.1 ... where can I sign up for my advance copy?).

I don\'t think my doomsaying had anything at all to do with it, IG incompetence
can be said to be 100% to blame, I suspect.

I don\'t know how "official" the above is, but it is *evidently* "common
knowledge" in the right circles.

 For a dot map of the Core-Trailing quarter of Foreven, check my
(very small but still growing) website at:

 http://members.aol.com/gypsycomet/index.html

  and look in the Zhodani section.  As for an actual listing, Foreven
was set aside by GDW as a Referee\'s Reserve around the time TNE first
appeared. There is no official listing, just a dot map and seven named
worlds pulled from CT adventures.  See the sadly defunct Imperiallines
#1 for the article.

  Far Frontiers is an odd case. The Rimward half was done by several
parties (FASA, for the SkyRaiders trilogy; and Dale Kemper for
publication in Ares) in a piecemeal fashion. Dale\'s version saw
reprinting in the early issues of Traveller Chronicle magazine. The
Coreward half was done (by me, to be honest) much later and is
scattered through several issues of Traveller Chronicle. At this late
date I admit to being less than completely happy with my work, but if
you can stand some of my leaps of uh, creativity, it\'s all available from
Sword of the Knight Publications. My webpage will probably host some of
this material soon, as well.
  To complicate matters, Chuck Kallenbach extensively redid the
Vanguard Reaches after its publication by Paranoia Press (lo, these
many years ago), and his new version does not agree with the
FASA/Kemper version of Far Frontiers. His current version was available
on the website listed on IG\'s links page, but that page is dead at
the moment. My attempts to reconcile Dale\'s and my stuff with Chuck\'s
work were prematurely halted by a sudden onset of Real Life (tm) back in
late \'94.

Yes, our mass detectors loose 1 factor when the ship uses
floorfield/inertial comp and another when using gravthrust/thrusterplates.
The mass signature also icrease quite a bit for targets using the above.
Mass detectors are IMTU also the only sensors that can look straight at the
sun without detriment (I use an unrealistically large 45 degrees cone where
sensitivity goes down by 1000 (logged to my logscale of course)) in the
hospitable zone.

We (my Traveller group) just had this problem. They were searching for a
landed Corsair with a idlerunning p-plant doing 20 MW in a cold climate. I
argued that they at least wouldn\'t be able to pick it up from orbit as
water vapour would screen it but does anybody have some
figures/ballparks/wild guesses as to the detection range for a today
passive IR scope vs a 1 kW source, 10 kW source or whatever? Is the
absorption exponential (my guess) or what?

still managed to play our regular session on friday (her character has END

IG had NOT "folded"!  Why, pray tell, do you believe it necessary to tell
us that your predicted demise of IG may come true?

If it is *blindingly* *obvious* that IG has "folded", I am 100% positive
that Marc would have come out and said so by now out of respect for the
TML.  Since he hasn\'t, I will rightly assume that things aren\'t as bad as
you make them out to be (yet).

Maybe, but if they are honestly trying to get back on track, your tone
doesn\'t help things.  In the past few months the majority of your posts
have taken the anti-IG tone.  This is probably why you come across as being
overly pessimistic with regards to IG.  Are you in some way proud that your
earlier predictions regarding IG\'s downfall may be coming true?

> I don\'t know how "official" the above is, but it is *evidently* "common

But it isn\'t "fact" and it would be irresponsible for anyone to say
otherwise at this time.  Children say "I told you so."

How do you know that GURPS Traveller will be "the future of Traveller
only for those people running campaigns prior to 132-1116" ?

I have used both TNE and MT for campaigns set in the Classic Traveller
era.  Of the current Traveller systems my preference is for slightly
modified MT.  But of the current Traveller _settings_ my preference is
for the classic Traveller settings.

I do not see why you cannot use GURPS Traveller for Milieu 1084, Milieu
650, Milieu 0, Millieu 1128, Miliue 1201, or even Milieu -300,000
(although you will need a bit more than 100 point charecteres if you are
playing Ancients). 

Sure GURPS Traveller may be set up for Milieu 1116 and will quite likely
be so well done that most of its purchasers will want to play in 1116,
but the Continuity Gestapo are not going to come and break down your
door if you use it in a different setting.

I have a question for all those of you playing in a classic (pre 1116)
Traveller setting.  How do you "know" [other than by using "canon"] that
events describded in GURPS Traveller are not the correct ones, and MT
and TNE wont happen ?

For example _my_ answer to the question of to why Dulinor\'s ship blew up
is as follows.

My former player charecter Sir Sigrid Ottawa was psionic and posessed
precognition [TNE Arcana - Prescience TNE rules pg 258].  One afternoon
in 1083 while under the influence of Psi Special (ie at PSI 15) she
rolled a critical success at her Prescience task.  The referee used this
as an opportunity to forshadow every plot hook for the campaign, and
threw in the vision of (a much older) Dulinor shooting (a much older)
Strephon.  One of the other player charecters in that campaign, Captain
Sir Rueksdonneskhal Imperial Marines [yes he\'s a Vargr], happened to
read Sigrid mind a year later [a blatant invasion of her privacy] and
"saw" that at least five things she had foreseen had come true.  He had
no problem believing that this event would as well
_unless_someone_did_something_about_it_.  Now Sigrid ended up with a bad
case of dead before she got a chance to "take care of" Dulinor (probably
by "any means necessary") but I think that one of her shipmates
discussed the situation with someone who believed the story & started an
investigation.  This investigation uncovered Dulinors plan and stopped
it.  Thats my story and I am sticking to it.

I know Toast normal limits you to 8 levels of directories (unless you

I thought I had done it right?

48 AF\'s does an average of 18 damage
480 SDB\'s do an average of 19 damage (ignore TL mods)
this 1 AF is roughly equal to 10 SDBs in combat effectiveness.

CruRon AF = (P-2)/2+M
10 SDB = 1 AF in damage terms, but use 20 SDB = 1 AF in money

=> CruRon "cost" = ((P-2) + 2 M) x 10

I chose to adjust this to
CruRon "cost" = (P-2+M) x 10

A BatRon is twice the cost of a CruRon in Imperial Squadrons.  I could have 
based the conversion on BatRon attack factors, but that would have given too 
many sqadrons in my view.

why they have said they are not continuing.
Imperium Games is kaput. Gone. Dead. Will never publish again.
That isn\'t to say that IG2 won\'t be formed. But you can damn well bet that
it isn\'t going to be the same, debt inheriting, company.

  The comment about cost doesn\'t quite hold water to my viewpoint (which
can be wrong <grin>!)

1) fuel is needed for jumps right?  If the station ony deals with 7 100
ton x-boats - then we are looking at only 30/40/50/60 tons of fuel x 7, or
a range of 210 to 420 tons of fuel.  This is per week for just the
x-boats.  Add in another 420 tons for misclelanious usages for other
ships, and you should be able to keep the fuel costs down to reasonable
levels. 

2) food and other such supplies would be no more exensive than would be
required for other deep space installations.  Note that in PE, they give
an example of such a deepspace installation for their combat example and
attempted take over example.  Technically, it wouldn\'t be any more
expensive than having an X-boat system in a TL 4 or 5 world.  Both
"stations" need extensive resupply from other locations.

  All in all, I see no reason why such stations don\'t exist in the current
incarnation of Traveller other than "Because nobody has thought about it
as yet?"

Well, there is (was) a Finnish band, who first made covers of Ramones\'
song in Finnish, but later wrote their own material. I have one CD from
them. It has 39 songs, but I can\'t remember the length.

(BTW, 2:30 average for a song by Ramones is IMHo too long, try 2:00 B-)

The Travellers\' Aid Society Alien Encyclopedia.

IBR Productions, Hemmingen, Germany. ISBN 3-89505-001-6. 250 DM (+30DM P&P
to UK).
Comments by Dominic Mooney:
A while ago, one of the German Traveller Mailing List members (Volker) drew my
attention to the existence of this book, and recommended it. Physically, it
is very impressive - 35mm thick x 270mm deep x 210mm wide, it is hardbound,
covered in a black mock leather, with the kind of ribbon page marker that
you associate with large reference books. It is very definately a quality item.

However, it\'s the contents that interested me more. For a while I\'ve owned
both the DGP Alien Modules, and had started to hanker after the CT Modules.
This book contains all eight alien modules and \'alien realms\' (the scenarios
book) published by GDW. In addition, it contains the draft material \'Aliens
for Traveller\', an 8 page document originally from GenCon 1981. The alien
modules retain their original numbering, and are separated by colour plates
of the original covers. A few pieces of artwork have not translated well
(particularly those with greys on them) but everything is useable, and the
whole book is very tidy.

Those of you who want to know more about the modules are recommended to look
up Tim Collinson\'s \'The Traveller Bibliography\' which has entries on them
all (and is available from BITS).

Would I recommend the book? Well, it depends.

- - Yes, if you don\'t own the original modules and want them (the cost of the
book was approx £115 inc. p&p when I bought it) in a nice, well made format
that should last for a long time. The material is usable with T4 (especially
if you are willing to tweak the rules a little and increase skills handed out).
- - Yes, if you really want a limited edition (200 total) signed by Marc Miller.
- - No, if you already own the Alien modules....

The book was purchased through Fantasy En\'Counter in Germany. When I ordered
they could only accept Mastercard or International Money Orders, so I
suggest you have a look at their web page:

This has an e-mail address for Holger Willert, whom you can ask for more
details.

POCKET EMPIRES
- ----

David Burden, Stuart Dollar, Jo Grant, Andy Lilly and Joe Walsh, 101 pages,
£15, ISBN 1 57828 374 4. Ratings: BITS ****.

Going one step beyond any previous Traveller supplement, Pocket Empires
gives you the rules for running an entire empire - whether you wish to fill
in some background for a campaign, allow your characters to get involved in
interstellar politics, or play out the development of multiple pocket
empires. The book includes descriptions of how an empire is created from
scratch or how you can gain control through politics, coups or other means.
The use of high-level meta-tasks make it possible to run things at a macro
level, while still allowing individual character abilities and role-playing
to influence the game. At a more detailed level, the rules cover pocket
empire economics (resources, productivity, trade, taxation, etc.),
development (infrastructure, population, starports, technology) and conflict
(building interstellar forces for defense or war).

The basis for running a Pocket Empire is economics - a planet must have the
appropriate population, infrastructure and technology level to exploit its
resources. Only large population worlds will tend to be sufficiently
productive to make a major impact at the interstellar level. From a world\'s
production, a certain part is available to the government to spend on
developing the planet, buying military forces, or for use in various
military and non-military strategies with/against other worlds.

We worked hard to create a strong role-playing aspect in Pocket Empires.
There are thus large sections describing the types of rulership available
within a Pocket Empire (in particular the archetypal Imperial noble family),
and the multitude of adventures that can be based within a Pocket Empire
environment. For quick resolution of a Pocket Empire\'s actions - from
interstellar diplomacy to warfare - we have used a meta-task system. There
are also a set of simplified rules to allow more detailed play for resolving
interstellar warfare on a grand scale!

The book is laced through with two example Pocket Empires - one the new-born
product of a noble family heading out beyond the borders of the Imperium;
the other a long-established empire seeking to maintain its power through
back-stabbing powerplay.

The comments from one of the RPG newsgroups was:

"Apparently all the ranting and raving about T4 has paid off...Marc Miller
seems to have Imperium Games back on track with Pocket Empires. To quote
part of the back cover blurb:

"Pocket Empires presents complete rules for players to own and manage
worlds. Generate income from worlds, assessing each for resources, labor,
trade and technology, then allocate revenue to build infrastructure, space
fleets, and more! Set interstellar economics in motion.

"Empire-building comes to Traveller in a big way with this terrific
cross-milieu sourcebook. PE covers the development of a ruling corporate or
noble dynasty, establishment and expansion of empire, means to maintain
political and military control, development and exploitation of planetary
resources, plus military and diplomatic conflict between pocket empires and
the Imperium. Equally useful for Milieu 0, Long Night, and Rebellion-era
campaigning, this is one *wifty* piece of work. Fans of the MegaTraveller
supplement Hard Times will definitely *love* Pocket Empires, and I\'m certain
even detractors of Hard Times will find PE to be damn fine source- and
scenario material.

"All in all, this is a well-conceived, well-written and well-presented
product. Should Imperium Games maintain the momentum which Pocket Empires
will surely give it, this may be the book which rechristens the T4 line.
Without reservation I pronounce Pocket Empires a thoroughly wonderful,
useful (as well as wickedly fun) Traveller supplement."

Although written to a short timescale, PE seems to have proved very popular.
Nominally designed for the Milieu 0 setting, the rules are intended to be
sufficiently generic to run any \'empire\' in any setting, from a single world
to a large collection of planets.

We at CORE worked hard to refine the rules and make them as playable as
possible, but the lack of play-testing time may mean that we didn\'t have
time to resolve all the potential pitfalls. The original intention was a
system which didn\'t require the use of a calculator. I have to admit that in
the end we found a calculator was a *requirement*! Nevertheless, I think
this should be a useful book for anyone who is interested in developing
their own areas of space in Traveller.

Review by David Thomas:

Pocket Empires (PE) attempts a very ambitious feat: to provide a self
consistent model for interstellar trade, growth and development. The five
authors actually do this very well, which is highly commendable, and rather
more than many professional economists can claim. PE also features a fair
model for large scale conflict, but I would have penalised HEPLaR using
technologies more heavily when they meet reactionless thrust opponents.
There is also a short section of adventure ideas where the PE acts as patron.

Unfortunately, PE isnt a playable game. This is as understandable as it is
unavoidable. Macro economic activity simply isnt that gripping. The basic
algorithms in PE are fine, they just require an awful lot of variables and
hard work, along with some dice rolling. This is emphatically not the kind
of thing you can run at the table. PE would lend itself much better to a PBM
or PBEM, or it could be used by a dedicated Referee to regulate the
background to the players adventures.

As to the book itself, it has the usual IG hallmark of poor organisation.
Following the rules is quite hard as a lot of factors and variables are used
in calculations before they have been introduced to the reader, which
results in a lot of flipping back and forth and, in my case, swearing. That
said, once youve got used to it its fine, except for one thing. PE insists
that a hereditary nobility is an efficient, natural and sustainable form of
government. This is demonstrably untrue. Luckily, the rest of the book
stands without the noble family bit, which is a mercy.

PE is unusual amongst official Traveller products in being readily
exportable to other systems, especially SpaceMaster, Battletech/Mechwarrior
and Fading Suns, all of which have this kind of pseudofeudal devolved power
structure. Actually, PE could be used to model the economic activity in the
background of any SFRPG setting.

Summary: Macroeconomics: good. Strategic warfare: nice. Adventure Ideas:
fine. Hereditary nobility: bad. Usefulness: specialised but high.

In 3I times information got from Core to the outer limits at Jump-6. The X-Boat

You are still thinking too big.

I think the following approach is used for the "101" books (at least
initially and possibly throughout).

Prepare your document in \'digest\' form.

Solicit orders from the TML.

Print one copy, color cover, B&W inside.

Take it to Kinko\'s (sorry, U.S. storefront printer) have them make 100 copies.

Sell at cost of 100 copies/100 + $0.50 for printer supplies via mail order.

If desired, do another print run and contact FLGS\'s directly to distribute
(lord knows whether you can get into the U.S. Game distribution market
effectively - and who really cares?)

That\'s my own plan anyway.

That\'s true, but it would still cost more since you\'d have to have it 
carted in from surrounding systems. If your station is already within 
a system, most systems have "local" sources of fuel such as gas 
giants and planetary oceans that a station could use at lower cost.

That\'s also true, but the cost to transport them would be less since  
much of it could be hauled using non-jump capable in-system shuttles 
that would have lower operating overhead than jump-capable 
freighters.

I think you bring up a point that I\'d failed to consider here - tech. 
When I thought about this concept, I had considered just the basics - 
food, fuel, and personnel transportation. However, I guess that these 
costs would pale in comparison to what it costs to supply a station 
with higher tech items such as spare parts and maintenance. When you 
consider that, it\'s possible that the costs for the "basics" might be 
insignificant when compared to total operating costs.
Also, even though the cost for a deep space x-boat station might be 
slightly higher, I could see them being deployed in places where 
their strategic value would be more important than the added cost.

I think you\'re right on this one too, and on further reflection I 
think it would add an interesting facet to the game. In fact, I think 
it might be possible to take the deep-space installation concept a 
few steps further to include refuelling stations and military 
installations too. All it would take is an economic or strategic 
rationale for these facilities to exist, which would be easy to 
justify in many cases.

Well Hal, I guess you made a "convert" out of me. :)

The X-Boat system was a network of Jump-4 courier boats that worked much
like the pony express.  A X-boat jumps into a system, sends its encoded
data store to another X-boat waiting to jump to the next system, then
downloads the messages to the system\'s mainworld.

The Imperial court maintained a secret group of Jump-6 couriers, to insure
that the nobility would have advance notice of news and policies.  Norris
used his head start on the news of Strephon\'s assassanination to declare
himself Archduke of Deneb, claiming it had come from the Emperor.

Were there ever more than just the first of these?  Does any one have
copies they\'d be willing to loan me or copy for me so I can include the
contents in the sequel to the Traveller Bibliography which is intending on
covering periodical articles in a similar fashion to the books.

Yes, that\'s right, I said periodical *articles*.  I know I\'m mad.  I wish
I\'d never started!


While I\'m here, is there anyone\'s whose seen my bibliography that would be
willing to write a review?  I know it\'s been mentioned a couple of times
but a review would be nice.

OK. Now I have an idea why it has been so hard to find the data. My
interest in the Far Frontiers started with the Sky Raider trilogy but
only one sub-sector map came in the trilogy. Thanks again. I\'m off to do
research.

There are holes in the water vapour bands through which the atmosphere is

you get to radio waves.)

Atmospheric absorbtion is exponential (intensity goes down as exp(-tau),
where tau is the optical depth, which is proportional to distance), but
(as I said) at some wavelengths the atmosphere is pretty transparent (about
10% total absorbtion from space to the top of mauna kea at 2.1 microns, 
for example; perhaps 30-40% to sea level.) (Of course 2.1 microns is pretty
short IR.) The biggest loss in sensitivity is just due to background - the 
ground is pretty bright in the IR.

Personal experience - using an off-the-shelf 3-5 micron camera I can see
a light aircraft at about 10 miles easily, with no particular optimization
of the camera or image processing. The camera is about 10kg with a 35mm
lens. Dunno how many kilowatts a Cessna
puts out, though. Can anyone provide a number?

Yes, but good ol\' US Constitution is Supreme over the USMJ, so all First
Amendment rights are there.  I think they\'re subject to UCMJ by operation of
jurisdiction, i.e., military law on US bases.  Its like extraterritoriality.
Likewise, Imperium bases, embassys, military bases, etc. on member worlds will
be Imperium territory.  But will they control all of system space?  Thats a
broad interpretation of ruling "the space between the stars."  Perhaps they
need a legitimate reason (sort of like probable cause) to force ships in a
system to heave to.

My brother just came back from US Army wargames, they were trying out a new information system. Every platoon and vehicle commander had a field-rugged laptop, working off a transmitted data feed. On his screen he could call up maps of the area, see unit locations (both friendly and spotted enemy), and even zoom in on certain locations. When you zoomed in, you were fed real-time video from satellites - the resolution was good enough to make out facial expressions. It was kind of need seeing the surprised look on the enemy LT\'s face when my brother\'s team got the drop on him.

The opposing force had no access to satellite data, but they did somehow manage to hack the data feed - there was some confusion from that. Still, even though the "info-heavy" team was outnumbered 2-1, they inflicted astonishing casualties - opposing force captured two guys (later rescued), lost 80% + of their force.

TL 12+ battlefield and surveillance sensors will be even scarier than this.

>Well Hal, I guess you made a "convert" out of me. :)

  It isn\'t exactly my intent to make a convert out of anyone per se <grin>,
but to figure out the ramifications of what "man" would do if certain
things are feasible.  As another poster pointed out, military x-boats are
likely to be "state" secrets and not maintained on civilian charts (good
rationalization of why it\'s not on previous suppliments <wink>).  But these
secret installations would make sense actually - those jump-6 x-boats can
put into port there without being identified.
  With respect to the jump-6 ships being secret, I suspect that they aren\'t
a secret in the sense that people don\'t know they exist, but that they
don\'t know which ships aren\'t Jump-6.

  However, were I an enemy nation/corporation etc, I think I could find the
jump-6 ships given enough time, and enough patience.  Unless of course,
those jump-6 ships change names regularly.  But even so, their classes
can\'t be changed.

  You wonder How I would go about this?  Step one: get the listing of ship
arrivals and departures along with a date stamp.  Step two: correlate the
times from departures, along with distances.  Step three: find those
dates/times/distances that exceed the publicised information of the ship\'s
known abilities.

  Granted, one time specials would exist that exceed the normal class\'s
ability to function, but when you find many such examples of anomalies,
then you have an idea of what is what.

  Also, if you can get cargo handling information, fuel usage records, and
passenger manifests, it isn\'t hard to see that some merchant class ships
are not operating at full revenue generating ability.

  All of this assumes of course, that such information is available for
public use.  If the information needs to be stolen <shrug> then that is a
new ball game entirely...

apparently, not on the MS \'joliet\' format CD-Rom. (I have one I made in
that format, and it still shows up with 8.3 filenames, which is ISO9660

I do not know about higher levels of ISO 9660 support which does include
256 character filenames.

This is important, because I\'d like to be able to get long filenames on
the TML CD coming up.

And to give credit where it is due, let\'s all give our thanks and a big round
of applause to Glenn Grant for not only creating the Life Events system and
posting it on the TML, but for graciously allowing it to be included in my
program. Some of the coincidences between what happens in a given term
and what comes up in your "background history" is spooky...

Glenn, take a bow!

P.S. I\'m hoping in a future version to have a year by year playback of Life
Events and Skills earned, kinda like the old High Guard and Mercenaries
type of character gen (e.g., "Age 42, you get involved in a war or conflict:
Skills VaccSuit +1"). Right now you can only really correlate life events
and terms served. Of course, this is all dependent on my free time, which 
ain\'t a whole lot these days...

Marc Miller also sells them:  FarFuture@aol.com.  For people in the U.S.
that\'s probably easier than an international order.  Dom\'s comments are
good; I was worried it might not have been such a good purchase until I
actually had it in my hands, and then I was elated.  It costs a lot, but
if you don\'t have the stuff already, it\'s definitely worth getting.

By the charts, that\'s the way it comes up, Wet being merely a description
of the amount of H20 to distinguish it from Desert, Dry, or Water Worlds.
I know that the Ice-capped description is used in world generation, but
I was just inputting what the char gen rules had to say.

If y\'all\'d like, it wouldn\'t be difficult to just put in a little procedure
in the
next version that looks for a vacuum atmosphere and describes the hydro-
graphics as Water(Ice) or Wet(Ice).

(Of course, like my feelings on the chart to roll your birthday on, we could
have a little faith in the people buying the game to know that any water on
a vacuum planet would be frozen. I think the typical Traveller player has
a little more going on upstairs than, say, your typical TMNT player <g>.)

From supplement 7: Traders and Gunboats, p. 8:

"The express boat (also called an xboat) is a small, fast ship filled with a pilot compartment, message data banks, and jump drives. The fit is so tight that there is no room even for maneuver drives. Each is capable of jump-4 (four parsecs per week); it jumps, relays its messages to the station on arrival, and then waits to be picked up by a tender, to be refuelled and sent on its way with a new load of messages. The local station, meanwhile, accepts messages, encodes them, and transmits them to a tender at the edges of the stellar system. Messages brought by the arriving xboat and intended for further down the line are consolidated with the new data and all are sent on to another xboat already fuelled and standing ready to leave. The entire network operates like the pony express - messages are always moving at top speed. Transfer time for messages from one xboat to another can be as short as ten minutes, and is rarely more than an hour."

I think I can add to this:

Ordinary mail (packages and paper) is shipped with liners or subsidized merchants. The rules for trade (at least in MegaTraveller) states that a subsidized merchant can get a contract carrying mail back and forth between two or more systems. This is corroborated by a story told by the \'Old Timer\' in SOM p. 47.

Someone else on the list wondered why the Xboat network is only jump-4. Lots of theories have been posted on the list, but there is one _fact_ that explains this a lot better that theories:

The Imperial household controls a series of indepedent, but astrographically slightly overlapping transport lines (where Imperiallines is the most famous). They operate a lot of jump-2 Frontier Transports - some of them, though, are secretly jump-6 capable and serve as fast couriers for the Emperor (Imperiallines and the organization is described in the Traveller Adventure - stats for the ships can be found in the Rebellion Sourcebook).

It was by this route that Norris learned about the assassination of Strephon before anyone else. It enabled him to act against public knowledge at that time, proclaiming himself archduke by the will of the Emperor. This is a pretty good example of why it would be in the Imperium\'s interest to keep the xboat routes at jump-4 - otherwise they would lose the advantage of advance knowledge.

Paul,

I believe GNU World Games Ltd. in Victoria has a new copy of the above

Yes.  That is the general process of constitutional defenses.  Its an
affirmative burden and the defendant has the burden of proof.

Mark, I seem to remember in one of the MT books (3 boxed set) that Norris
was appointed Arch Duke by Strephon prior to the assasination.  Which is
collaborated in several of the other MT suppliments.  It seems to me that he
had been notified but not gone back for the ceremony when word was received
of Strephon\'s death.  Was this information in the TNE books? I just bought
the series last week and haven\'t been able to get caught up on everything
yet.  I might be drenched on this but I\'ll check out my books in a day or so
and see what I can find out.  As you might have surmised I got away from the
game for awhile and just recently got back.  Feels like a warm blanket on a

Yes, IIRC, it was detailed in the Regency sourcebook.  I think that Norris
knew that Strephon was planning on appointing him Archduke anyway, so he took
the ball and ran with it knowing that the Marches needed a strong (and legit)
leader.

It\'s in Survival Margin, and some other TNE stuff (I think). If you do some
check of infotmation propagation times for J-6 and J-4, I\'m pretty sure
that it works out in MT that his new title is granted after the J-6
assassination \'wave\' would\'ve reached him.

His appointment was confirmed by Strephon in Arrival Vengeance (there are a
few great lines in there, especially about Norris\' daughter).  The simple
act of appointing himself made him quite interesting as an NPC.  He could
have turned into a monster but was seen as a savior by the population.  His
act of appointing himself permitted him to gain power at a time where a

	Actually, the *only* place I\'ve seen this was on the GURPS TNS web
site ... the "alternate" history. In fact, IIRC, in Survival Margin,
Strephon tells Norris he did the right thing by forging his
appointment ...

released throughout the Imperium as a standard.  Many entertainment systems
are fleshed out with this option, and Makhidkarun\'s software and hardware is
of the absolute highest quality.  Systems of varying quality can be purchased
from other corporations, but true fans of "kaadmukim" (a Vilani word roughly
translated as "interactive music") swear by Makhidkarun\'s extremely high
quality InterAct units.

Kaadmukim becomes possible around the time that houses, businesses and
spacecraft become "wired", with either one central computer, or several
dedicated control systems.  In a wired household, room temperatures are
adjusted to a (usually pre-set) comfortable level when the room is inhabited,
lights go on when someone is about to enter a darkened room, and go off a few
moments after a room is left unoccupied.  Many household items are wired, so
that they can be found easily should they become lost or misplaced.  Doors can
be automatically closed or locked, depedning on the pre-sets, outside lights
can be turned on when it is dark, an outside pool can be heated from the
living room couch, if such a thing is desired.  Basically, the house is
\'smart\' and does a number of minor chores as needed, and can be interfaced
with any number of specially made devices and robots.  The above examples only
scratch the surface of what is possible in \'smart\' or \'wired\' homes.

The InterAct Music System takes this concept to another level.  Speakers are
placed around the house for optimum listening enjoyment in much th same way as
they are placed for more traditional entertainment systems, and all of the
signals that go to and from the house\'s computer are turned into \'music\'.
Pre-recorded sound and music tracks are recorded onto a kaadmukim cube, and
are played according to the digital signals that pump through the household.
Depending on the kaadmukim band\'s (or performer\'s) skill, the effects can be
amazing.  The cube is never heard the same way twice.  The tracks are played
in fashion that is apparently random, although is based on events that the
house computer is processing at the time.  As wired items are moved through
the house, seats are sat in, and appliances are used, the music will shift and
change according to the original band or performer\'s desires.  Kaadmukim
writing is an intense discipline in and of itself, because the performer has
to surrender much of the control and order to the \'chaotic\' demeanor of a
modern household.  The basic effect of many kaadmukim cubes is that of a movie
soundtrack, or piece of classical music.  Themes are repeated in variations,
all aspects of the music are changed by the literally countless tasks the
house computer is performing, while underlying elements stay the same.  Some
fans of the medium prefer performers who forego any attempt of masking the
randomness with order, and enjoy the chaotic sound of what has come to be
known as "gushiimukim" (roughly translated as "music from chaos"), the random
patterns of a household are transformed into sounds and snippets that are, in
and of themselves, random.  The effect can be very fascinating, but can also
be very disconcerting and sometimes frightening as well.

Kaadmukim of all forms is a very popular medium, especially at parties and get
togethers.  An "asha kaadmukim" (roughly translated as DJ, or disc jockey in
crude 20th century english) will usually have a special deck with the ability
to hold more then one kaadmukim cube at a time and with the ability to mix
them and change them as desired.  A highly skilled "asha kaadmukim" will be
able to "smack the cubes" (manipulate a deck) with an ability and efficiency
that can be downright awe-inspiring.  A popular dance scene, with a huge
number of off-shoots and mutations, has sprung up.  One such offshoot, similar
to 20th century rap, has performers improvising rhymes over top of the ever
changing music.  No matter what, the way that a master "asha kaadmukim" can
move a crowd should not be underestimated.

In the first century of the Third Imperium trade normalized to the point that
a high-tech standard of living was possible more or less everywhere.
Kaadmukim systems became available nearly everywhere.  As now, these units
were very popular in dance clubs, as they created a unique experience for a
crowd, and experience of oneness that cannot be recreated any other way.  It
was common for an asha kaadmukim to pick cubes in which the beat would speed
up based on the heat of the room or venue that the system was installed in.
This is where, at least according to popular legend, the term \'heat up the
beat\' came from.  This practice, however, turned out to be somewhat dangerous
to the dancers, and heat exhaustion became very common.  Some world,
subsector, and sector governments made this practice illegal.  In most areas
of the Imperium, \'heat up the beat\' has a meaning similar to \'get down\', \'rock
on\', or \'let\'s boogie!\'.  However, in some areas it has a shadier connotation
to \'heat up the beat\', such as to undertake a deal or action that is either
somehow illegal or not completely on the up-and-up.


Tech Notes:  InterAct/Kaadmukim systems vary in quality and can be purchased
for between Cr500 and Cr5000.  This is for the system alone, and supporting
hardware, such as speakers, must be purchased seperately.  Tech levels for
availability also vary, and due to standardized \'smart home\' hardware can be
manufactured on worlds with a technology level of 9 or better.  Systems for
asha kaadmukim use will be on the upper end of the scale, generally sold for
for Cr3000 to Cr6000.  They are large and bulky, and are made to be installed
in various locations.  They are in no way comfortably portable, although asha
kaadmukim units can be easily transported.  A number of attempts to create
lower-quality portable units have been tried, relying on digital information
gathered from a world\'s commnet and through sensor equipment built into the
system.  Most such attempts have failed for the marketers, as it seems enough
data for a truly engrossing experience can\'t be gathered easily.  These
devices are available and supported in some areas of the Imperium though.
InterAct datacubes can be purchased for between Cr20 and Cr100 new, or Cr5 and
Cr30 used.  The cubes are extremely durable, and due to the great length of
time these units have been in existence, there is a vast collectors\' market.

The recent future-of-media thread has prompted me to finally put down in
writing a whole swarm of Equipment write-ups I\'ve been thinking about for
some time. Many of these technologies already exist, at least in embryonic
form; I\'ve lifted a lot of stuff from the MIT Media Lab "current projects"
list, among other sources. I aim for technical accuracy, or at least
plausibility, but I\'m an SF writer, not an engineer or scientist, so no
doubt I\'ve messed somewhere. *Informed* technical critiques are most
welcome.

I\'ve tried to integrate these technologies as much as possible with T4
canon, in particular Greg Porter\'s CSC, and his Equipment chapter of T4
Book 1. I do not own any MegaTraveller or TNE books, so for all I know I\'m
re-inventing the holodisplay, as it were.

There\'s more to come, when I can get around to writing it. I\'d like to
write an article on the enormous social and economic changes brought about
by these and other technologies (you\'ll notice some cryptic references to
"media tribes", for instance) but that will have to wait, for now.

In the meantime, I hope you find this stuff useful.

Best,

"HaloCaster" infrared datahalo link - 9 

A "data-halo" is a feature of virtually any electronic device with an
infrared link, surrounding the device with an invisible "halo" of data
which becomes visible only when viewed through smartglasses, or other
heads-up display. (These figurative "halos" should not be confused with
"holos" or holograms, an entirely separate medium.)
     A personal datahalo usually manifests as a clickable icon, logo, or
hyperlinked nametag, floating over the one shoulder or superimposed on the
wearer\'s body. When clicked, it downloads to the viewer\'s smartglasses a
greeting, business card, curriculum vitae, personal ad, homepage, and/or
consumer profile. Business datahalo icons generally appear in a shop window
or near the shop\'s entrance, and provide information about the products and
services offered within. A restaurant\'s datahalo, for instance, will
display the menu, images of dishes, and reviews by both culinary experts
and average customers. Government datahalo icons hang off of lamp posts or
walls, clickable for maps, service listings, transit schedules, interactive
tourist guides, historical info, police alerts, multilingual translations,
and so on.
     Advertising halos are, of course, ubiquitous, and attention-grabbing
halographic graffiti is a common sight in virtually any TL 9+ urban scene,
viewed through smartglasses. Always eager to spread the word, religious
evangelists and political activists like to stick solar-powered halochips
virtually everywhere. Faced with this profusion of overlapping halo images,
smartglasses filter halospace for info of relevance to the wearer, and
eliminate anything else, especially ads, unwanted solicitations, offensive
graphics, viral attacks, graffiti, etc. 
     At TL9 and above, virtually all products contain cheap one-way
halochips, even non-electronic items such as chairs, luggage, and wine
bottles. A typical consumer-product datahalo will include interactive user
guides, help files, safety warnings, serial numbers, catalogs of other
products by the same manufacturer or retailer, cross-promotional ads, and
contact info for the product\'s user tribe. Home and office computer systems
interact with the datahalos of every object within their purview, to
schedule regular service, replacement and recycling of perishables, ensure
product registration and insurance coverage, activate anti-theft
encryption, and so on.
     In workplaces, personal datahalos are used for security, to locate and
contact co-workers, and (where not prohibited by law) to monitor the
activities of employees. Halos also find a variety of uses at home and in
public. Even while walking through a mall or sitting in a cafe, people are
interacting invisibly, usually anonymously, seeking potential dates,
business contacts, media-tribe fellows, a lift uptown, or simply
interesting halo-chat. The enormous sociological effects of this simple
technology are too far-reaching to describe here. (For a good historical
overview, see Enzo Fjermedal\'s documentary _Data Tribes/Halo Nations_.)
     HaloCaster chips add nothing to the consumer price of a product. They
are standard in most Zoetec consumer items, while HaloCatcher sensors and
filters are ubiquitous in all Zoetec computers. Most of the cost for the
manufacturer is in the software, graphics, and text, more than paid for by
the valuable ongoing interaction with the customer.
     Most halocasters have a comm rating of 0.5 (at best 1), to a maximum
range of about 10m, limited to line-of-sight except where bounced off
ceilings or walls.


soundpanel - 10                 50Cr per 1m^2

A thin sandwich of accoustically-reactive, piezoelectric and flexile smart
materials, capable of sensing and accurately reproducing sound. Soundpanels
are usually linked to homecomp and media systems via infrared datahalo,
fibre optics, or the household electric power circuits. They can also act
as microphones for voice interfaces or telecomms. Quality of sound
reproduction is excellent for most purposes. Generally, the bigger the
panel, the better the sound: the accuracy of bottom-end frequency
reproduction is mostly a function of the soundpanel\'s area.
     It is rarely necessary for soundpanels to cover an entire wall or
room; typically two to four panels on the walls or ceiling are sufficient.
Only fanatic audiophiles are likely to need more, in which case they will
probably shell out for an expensive dynamic phased-array soundpanel system,
covering part of every wall, and the ceiling, plus subwoofers bolted to the
floor. An audiophile system can cost anywhere up to 100 times the usual
price.
     Soundpanels can also vibrate to produce anti-noise, reverse waveforms
which cancel out continuous or repetitious ambient sound. For instance,
they cannot eliminate car horns and loud arguments, but are quite effective
against howling wind, rumbling motors and the noise of large crowds. When
employed only to produce antinoise, they are often called "hushpanels".
     Zoetec soundpanels can be ordered in any possible combination of
color, pattern, and texture. Soundpanels are common ceiling or wall
coverings in all but the cheapest homes and workplaces above TL 10.


location field - 10                     Cr50 per 1m^2 of active area

A standard feature of all Zoetec homecomp systems, this nanoamp
electromagnetic field interface allows the system to track the user\'s body
movements. Thus, if the user points and asks, "What\'s this?", the system
instantly knows what is indicated, either in the room or on a display. By
tracking the user\'s movements between rooms, the system can adjust the
lights, open and close doors, bring up the soundpanel volume, clear the
domestic robots out of the way, and so forth.
      Location fields are generated by a grid of fine polymer conductors
and detectors, usually hidden within floor and wall coverings. Fields with
a range of one meter are also standard features of all portable Zoetec
video and computer displays, for tracking the user\'s hand gestures.
     Able to measure body size and shape, the field interface can
differentiate between individual users, recognize household pets, and
distinguish unauthorized intruders. No home or business security system is
complete without a location field interface.


smartpaper/smartbook - 10       By the sheet: Cr5 per 1m^2
                                40 page 9x15cm booklet: Cr30
                                240 page 11x17cm book: Cr 250
                                240 page 15x24cm book: Cr 500

A dynamic form of erasable electronic paper that stores and displays text
or flat images. Actually a sandwich of polymers with paperlike texture and
thickness, each sheet of smartpaper contains a layer of "digital ink", a
control grid underlayer, a printed computer chip, and (when sold by the
sheet) a digital radio reception layer. Digital ink particles can flip to
form high-resolution pixels in white, black, or various colors. Power
requirements are minuscule, supplied by a photoelectric layer on the
smartbook\'s cover. Smartpaper is pressure-sensitive, so the user can click,
write, or draw with fingertip or stylus . All Zoetec smartbooks feature a
holocrystal slot, fibreoptic, radio comm, and datahalo links, voice
interface and fingerprint owner-identification.
     Zoetec smartbooks with glow-in-the-dark Lumatone inks cost twice the
standard price.
     As digital ink is dynamic, it might seem that a single sheet of
smartpaper is all a person would ever need. In practice, however, people
still prefer to store information in books. Books are one of the simplest,
fastest, most intuitive data interfaces ever invented. The reader can
quickly flip to the index, re-read a previous page, then return to the
current paragraph, often with less effort than scrolling or clicking or
commanding a display to change pages. Whatever data is dumped into a
smartbook, it will stay on the assigned page, where the user can find it
easily, until it is moved or erased.
     Smartpaper is completely ubiquitous in all TL 10+ cultures, appearing
on everything from packaging and posters to wallpaper and warning labels.
At first it can update moving images at 15 times per second at best, but at
TL 12 color video can be displayed at 30 frames per second. Note, however,
that smartpaper is a poor substitute for a real video display (such as
Zoetec\'s "ViewSheet" displays). Besides the sluggish refresh rate,
smartpaper is not luminous; images recorded in video formats tend to look
drab and flat when displayed on smartpaper.
     Prices listed are for full-color smartpaper. Black & white or
monochrome smartbooks are half the price; specialized smartpapers designed
to display the same images over and over, used mainly in packaging and
advertising, are much cheaper still.
     White-light reflective holographic smartpaper is available at TL 14,
costs ten times as much, and is about 2mm thick. Due to bandwidth and
processor power limitations, it can only display still holophotos.


"ViewSheet" video display - 10   30x20cm: Cr 50
                                 1m wide, by the meter: Cr200
                                 2.5m wide, by the meter: Cr1000

A standard polymer video display, about 5mm in thickness. Can be rolled up
for transport. Features multi-screen windowing, self-configuring software
and hardware, location field (effective range of 1m), as well as
fibreoptic, radio comm, and datahalo links. Cannot display holographic
media.

    'body' => 'holocinema display - 10       Cr60,000 + 4000 per m^2;  computer: 60kg

A large-scale venue for viewing holographic movies is known as a
holocinema, holotheatre or holodrome. These establishments are shaped by
the complicated nature of holographic media. A hologram is much like a
window onto a 3D scene (real or computer generated). As a small window
would make it difficult for more than one person to view the scene,
holodisplays must be quite large to provide a whole audience with an
adequate view. The images can be made to float behind or in front of the
screen, but never beyond the screen\'s edges (as perceived by the individual
viewer). Thus, holoscreens are usually large and hemispherical, wrapping
around steep tiers of semi-reclined seats. Home holotheatres are possible
at TL 10, but are extremely expensive and often require an entire room to
be built specifically for the purpose.
     As in live theatre, each audience member has a different angle of
view, something holomovie directors must take into account. The audience
can be fully immersed in the action, but an actor performing an important
emotional scene must be placed so that every viewer can see his or her
face. As a result, holocinema audiences are used to constantly shifting
their attention from the centre of the dome to the area seemingly beyond
the screen. They are also familiar with holomovie cuts, which can be quite
startling to the uninitiated, as 3D objects and people appear to leap into
existence right in front of the viewer\'s nose, and disappear with the next
cut.
     Holomedia require vast amounts of bandwidth and considerable
number-crunching power. Even with object-modeling and advanced data
compression, the typical fibreoptic line is inadequate for transmitting
anything but tiny holovid images, a few centimeters across. A Zoetec TL 10
holocinema runs high-resolution holomovies recorded on ultradense crystals
and decompressed by a dedicated rating-4 computer array. TL 10 holocinema
displays are non-portable and are usually custom-designed to suit the
theatre.
     Price listed is for a theatre-sized holodisplay system with integral
soundpanels. Seating, building structure, and so on, are extra.
     Home units are prohibitively expensive custom luxury items -- at least
until the advent of Zoetec\'s TL 12 "VistaFlex" hologlasses, and TL 13
"DeepView" portable holovideo display systems.


"ViewShades" smartglasses - 9   Cr200 to 1000

Smartglasses are spectacles which superimpose a digital display over the
wearer\'s view of the world. Zoetec\'s "ViewShades" are available in a
seemingly endless range of styles and capabilities. At Cr200, the most
affordable models function as display units for comps and vidplayers,
linked by bodynet, datahalo, or fibre optic. A motion detector tracks the
user\'s head movements, while a short-range location field tracks hand
gestures. Of course ViewShades are also excellent UV-protective sunglasses.
     In addition to these functions, a top-of-the-line model, at Cr1000 or
more, will feature image intensifiers that turn night into day, infrared
vision (displayed in color or in shades of red), protection from low-power
laser blinding, voice interface, integral Aide, and vidcomm unit. It can
also act as a stereo-image video camera, or targeting sight, with motion
stabilization and eye tracking. All ViewShades include photoelectric
surfaces for recharging their batteries.
     Where datahalos are common, smartglasses become a basic necessity of
life. To walk the streets without them is to miss at least half the action:
the otherwise invisible world of halospace.


"VistaFlex" holospecs - 12              Cr400-3000

"VistaFlex" holospecs combine the style and features of Zoetec\'s line of
"ViewShades" smartglasses with the best TL 12 holovid display technology.
The VistaFlex line offers a profusion of fashionable designs and a range of
new capabilities.
     Watching holovids through holospecs is a radically different
experience from sitting in a holocinema theatre, where every member of the
audience has a different view of the action. In fact, most holomovies are
now edited in two forms, one for cinemas, and one for holospecs. Directors
have learned to take advantage of the holospec viewer\'s consistent point of
view and complete immersion in a spherical panorama. And interactive media
for regular smartglasses pale by comparison to the absolute realism of
interactive holomedia.
     Users unfamiliar with immersive media are cautioned that discrepancies
between inner-ear and visual sensory inputs can result in temporary
dizziness, nausea and blurred vision. Most people who have grown up in TL
9+ societies, experiencing immersive media every day from an early age,
rarely suffer from these effects.


"DeepView" holovideo display - 13    Cr6000 + 1000 per m^2  computer: 7kg

A portable holovideo display system, consisting of a polymer screen, about
5mm in thickness, and a dedicated rating-4 computer system (rating 2 for
non-holographic tasks). Can be rolled up for transport. Features
holocrystal slot, voice interface, location field (effective range of 1m),
as well as fibreoptic, radio comm, and datahalo links. Soundpanels not
included.
     Mounted on one wall of a room, the DeepView display makes an excellent
conferencing system -- wherever there is a TL13 fibreoptic net, capable of
handling the necessary bandwidth for holovid (comm rating 4). For the full

"Esper" image processor - 13    Cr9,000 10kg

A highly evolved image processing system, the "Esper" is used by
investigators, scientists, and intelligence experts to extract the maximum
of information from visual media. Its scanner can digitize virtually
anything, from photographs to dynamic holoprints, at any resolution down to
the molecular scale (if necessary), while its file translation software can
parse a vast array of data storage methods, from long-outdated analog
videotape standards to hypercompressed holovid formats. Its dedicated
neural nets have a pretty good record of cracking even unfamiliar alien
media.
     The Esper boasts an impressive suite of powerful image analysis tools.
Given a dynamic holoprint, or even a flat photo still, it can construct 3D
models of the original scene. Extrapolating from reflections, cast shadows,
glare, and other cues, it can generate low-resolution views of limited
areas beyond the frame of the image. Employing every known enhancement
algorithm (such as edge detection, fractal expansion, false-color analysis,
and visual metalogics), the Esper can restore amazing amounts of detail to
digital mosaics, bring fuzzy subjects back into stunning focus, and
virtually eliminate motion blur.
     Provided with several frames of video or holovid, it can generate a
composite ultrahigh-resolution image of the non-moving parts of the scene.
The Esper can also stabilize a video clip, clean it up, break it down into
individual objects, extrapolate it in various directions, and apply dozens
of other manipulation techniques. Given a synchronized audio track, the
Esper can model acoustic conditions in three dimensions and identify likely
sound sources. Provided with a stereo-audio/video record of an
assassination, for instance, it could easily determine the number of guns
fired and their probable positions.
     Images are viewed and manipulated on the Esper\'s ultrasharp 1m
holoscreen, or other advanced holodisplay device. Like all Zoetech
computers, the Esper is equipped with an intuitive voice interface,
location field, bodynet interface and datahalo link.
     Computer rating: 4 for image processing, 2 for all other tasks.

"Lumacryl" lightpaint - 9         Cr10 per litre (1kg) [covers 30m^2 ?]

Photoluminescent acrylic-based paint; absorbs energy from sunlight or any
other bright light source, and emits it as a dim glow lasting several
hours. Glow-in-the-dark paint and plastic are common at lower tech levels,
but only in pale green and blue hues. At TL 9, new polymer design
techniques make possible a whole spectrum of stronger colors, from
UV-indigo through to deep red. When fully charged, the glow is bright
enough to read by, with a half-life of about an 30 minutes (30 minutes
longer with each higher Tech Level; at TL 12 the half-life is 2 hours, at
TL 15, 3.5 hours).
     Lumacryl lightpaint is commonly used on road signs, curbs, traffic
lanes, hazard stripes, warning symbols, runways, grav vehicle landing
zones, and a thousand other applications. Lightpaint can be a lifesaver in
the event of a blackout. (Warning: Zoetec strongly recommends against the
use of lightpaint as a replacement for powered street lamps and security
lighting.) Lumacryl paints and Zoetec\'s "Lumatone" glow-in-the-dark
printer\'s inks are commonly seen on outdoor advertisements everywhere.
      In some urban areas, the sale of lightpaint spraybombs is restricted
to adults, as graffiti that glows long after dark is even more intrusive
than during the daytime.
     Available in a wide range of tubes, cans, drums, and aerosol spray
bombs. Water-soluble until dry, then becomes permanent (can be dissolved by
Zoetec "Zymove-It" enzymatic cleaner).


"Lumilon" lightfabric - 9               Cr30 per 1m^2

Photoluminescent fabric, as popularized by Zoetec\'s line of fashionable
"Glo-Clothes" safety gear. "Lumilon" glow-in-the-dark fabric absorbs energy
from sunlight or any other bright light source, and emits it as a dim glow
lasting several hours. Available in an endless array of attention-getting
colors, textures, and styles. Though most commonly used in
hazardous-environment garments, tents, bags, ropes, and other gear, Lumilon
fibres can be woven into virtually any type of clothing (adding only about
Cr50 to the cost of a full suit).
     Many a lost traveller has been rescued thanks to Zoetec Glo-Clothes.
Also extremely popular among all-night dance clubbers.
     At TL 11, lightfabric can be electroluminescent, at no extra cost,
glowing for many hours from a battery or other power supply. Also available
at TL 11 is Zoetec "Vidlon" video display fabric, at Cr100 per 1m2. Vidlon
is a low-resolution video display made of optical fibres interwoven with
any other kind of fabric. When tailored into clothing, Vidlon is more of a
fashion statement than a useful video display. But it can be a worthwhile
safety feature when used in survival tents, glowing brightly and even
flashing messages if needed.

gene scanner - 10                       Cr2500  25kg

A diagnostic and security tool which scrapes dead cells from a person\'s
hand, extracts the DNA, and sequences it with a specialized molecular
manipulator array. At TL 10, a complete human genome takes 20 hours to
sequence, half that time at each higher Tech Level; thus 5 hours at TL 12,
and 38 minutes at TL 15. However, a full genome sequence is unnecessary for
identification purposes; a person can be identified to a high degree of
certainty within 1 hour at TL 10, 15 minutes at TL 12, and 2 minutes at TL
15. Where complete certainty is not needed, this time can be reduced
considerably.
     Most commercial identification scanners do not rely on actual gene
sequencing; metabolic scanners, for instance, use a variety of biometrics,
such as body size and shape, fingerprint, voiceprint, retina print,
brainwaves and various biochemical tags found in exhalations (cf CSC, p46).

     Ownership of gene sequencers requires a licence, as the potential for
abuse is considerable. Virtually all genetic indicators for disease
vulnerabilities and behavioral predispositions have been known for
centuries, as have effective gene therapies for most major disorders.
Genetic privacy laws have existed almost as long, and discrimination on the
basis of genetic profile is illegal. Unfortunately, abuses are difficult to
prevent where gene scanners are allowed to proliferate. Gene profile
databases are always heavily encrypted and carefully shielded against
electronic intrusion.
     Despite many legal challenges, insurance companies long ago gained the
right to require full genetic disclosure from potential clients. Where
health care is a social right, some governments have been known to require
gene therapies for individuals deemed to be at risk of certain diseases or
criminal behaviors. On some worlds, especially where the gene pool is very
small or population densities are critically high, eugenic programs have
been instituted, requiring gene scans and therapies for anyone seeking a
reproductive permit.
     AT TL 10, gene scanners are specialized by species, but above TL 14
they will function equally well for human DNA and the genes of most known
alien sophonts.
     Initially rather bulky, sensitive pieces of lab equipment, by TL 13
gene scanners are small enough to be included in a Medkit. They are
standard elements of any autodoc facility.

In MT Strephon did not appoint Norris Archduke in 1116.  He appointed
him Archduke in 1125, well after Norris fraudulantly appointed himself.
See Arrival Vengeance pg 23 for details.

The fact that in GURPS Traveller Strephon _did_ appoint Norris Archduke
in 1116 is strong eviedence that Strephon discovered Dulinors plot and
had him killed.  Strephon was presumably a bit shocked & hurt by this &
this caused him to start thinking about "the big picture" in the
Imperium.  He decided that some things needed changing & one of these
was to give Deneb its own Archduke.

Alternate scenario - In the canonical GDW MT universe someone in the
upper reaches of Strephons intelligence community did know about
Dulinors plot _but_ they also knew that the real Strephon was away from
Capital.  They did not have enough initiative (Don\'t you just hate those
darn Vilani sometimes ?) to take down an Archduke on their own so they
let the plot go foreward.

In the GURPS Traveller universe our hypothetical top level spook was too
hung over to come in to work the day Strephon was going to tell him he
was splitting for the Longbow site.  Thus our top spook thought the real
Strephon was still at Capital.  When he discovered this plan he let the
Emperor know about it (not knowing he was really dealing with one of the
clones).  The Strephon clone had Dulinor\'s shuttle destroyed & appointed
Norris Archduke.

That was just a polite way of saying that SJG will only be producing
"source material" to continue supporting the CT era.  It can be rather
difficult to continue playing a discontinued system if your referee prefers
to use published material appropriate to the era of his campaign.

There\'s nothing stopping you from using the GURPS *rules* to do this.  I
was referring to /published support material/ for the other three eras.
When IG first released T4, they mentioned possible support for a bunch of
milieus-- including some of the ones you mentioned.  SJG has made no
mention of this.

As for GURPS somehow magically convincing me that playing in their
Traveller universe is somehow better than anything GDW, IG, or myself could
come up with is a matter of opinion-- mine.

Sure, campaigns currently set before 132-1116 could conceivably move ahead
as if the assassination never happened.  There is no doubt in this and I
never said that it was an impossible future.  It is just a shame that a
long and extensive existing timeline won\'t continue to be used by SJG.

    Not having my copy of the original Book 6, Scouts handy this is from memory
but the whole J-4 xboat route system was established shortly after the Imperium
reached TL13 which allows J-4.  Circa 350??? I think.  Which makes sense
because the Imperium was expanding like crazy throughout Milieu 0 and continued
to do so through out the next Milieu towards the Rim.
    At some point it became obvious that without some system of pan Imperium
communications the Imperium was going to fragment.  Once the system was in
place it doubtless took decades if not centuries to put in place and then
refine for maximum efficency.  That also means there was an Enormous investment
in current equipment even as the Imperium\'s TL rose to allow J-5 and J-6
respectively.
    Figure that each "leg" or "jump" of the network needs a MINIMUM of four
couriers.  One in jump, one in system from jump and being recovered, one
recovered and being preped for the next jump and the fourth on station waiting
for a courier to jump in so they can jump out to the next system in the chain.
Add in a MINIMUM of two tenders, one to go get the courier and the other to
place it to be ready to jump and another facility to handle the tenders and the
couriers.  And this doesn\'t include any slack at all for problems or annual
maintenance and what not. ;)
    Now figure the costs of all that and start multiplying it by the number
systems serviced by the network.  This is NOT a trival sum even for the
Imperium!  More to the point by "freezing" the technology at TL13 it makes
local sources for spairs easier and doubtless cheaper to obtain.  Sheer inertia
would keep the system at J-4 because of the ENORMOUS investment of upgrading.
    Rather like the reluctance of local telephone companies to invest all that
money to rip out the copper wires and put in fiber optics.  Who is going to
foot the bill for this extremely costly upgrade for a modest performance
upgrade?  Is how the bureaucratic mind looks at it. ;)

    All that said, I forget the source (TNS??) but there were plans afoot in
the CT universe to actually start the upgrade to J-6 using drop fuel tanks for
the couriers.  I suspect the Imperial J-6 network was an MT add on.  Obvious in
retrospect, but still an add on STS.

The existence of a secret J-6 network was established in the CT days, 
as part of the Traveller Adventure (Imperiallines being the Spinward 
Marches part of the network).

I\'m working on a Library Data in Windows Helpfile-Format, and think of
doing the same to the TNS messages. I collected the ones from the IG
Website, but they only got until 1119. Does anyone have the later in text
format (Although they go to TNE)?

I put the libdata.hlp file on my Website. You can visit it if you want,
although I am working at it yet. You can find an early version of this
file along with a self-programmed Sector data viewer at

       http://www.uni-koeln.de/~acp82/Ancients

As I stated above, the site is still growing, so have patience.
The part already available is the humour page ...
Tell me if you have comments or problems with some details.

This is the beginning of alternate timelines expanding (Remember, in fact
every game master develops his own one.) A nice idea, as precognition also
fits to the Trav universe (I think the Zhos would do the heck to prevent
this ...)

I do not yet know into which timeline my group will get, as we still have
1105, i.e. two years before the 5th frontier war. I even think of letting
them visit BOTH via an ancient time portal ... but this is only an idea to
work out. There would be much alternatives to prevent the assassination.
The ancient artifact of the Zhodani Consulate (The one showing the Core
Missions) could also work. There are much possibilities to unfold the
future.

Whatever you want to play instead, it\'s your decision as a master.

It is in English, and a complete reprint of the original modules + alien
realms + aliens in Trav handout.

I was impressed with it. The shop needed a little prompting to post (mainly
because they were preparing for Germany\'s biggest con) but were very
helpful. It is one of those tomes that engenders a feeling of respect (it
feels really nice, and you can see this by the way the players gingerly
handle it).

I don\'t regret buying it (I only had the MT aliens stuff before this).
Apparently  K\'Kree warships look like the ships in Independence Day!!

Ha.  I guess it is kind of weird :^)

I had been promising a final draft to several people before I posted it, and I
finally got the time to hammer out the rough edges.  I wouldn\'t worry too much
though, as far as I know, I came up with the idea independently.

I was wondering how they dealt with scheduling.  Since it takes a variable amount
of time to jump (6-8 days), you can\'t be sure when the next Xboat will arrive.  If
you take off too early, the incoming message has to wait because the outgoing xboat
has already left.  This gets even more complicated at multi-directional nodes,
where you have 3 or more jump routes.

One solution to the scheduling problem is jumping every 9 or 10 days rather than
trying to skim off a couple days here and there. You assume the worst case 8 days
in jump.  Then another day or two for tending the ship (some larger systems may
require greater insystem travel time).

This gives a hard schedule to all the systems in the area, "Mail goes out every
10th day. Get it to the xboat station on time or you\'ll have to wait 10 more
days."  The number of ships required gets reduced to 1 Xboat per leg.  Likewise,
you can cut the time down by doubling ships.  Two ships per leg can manage a 5 day
schedule.

However, this doubled pace only helps once or twice (getting to the first Xboat
station an getting the message from the tail end). After that you multiply the
number of legs by 10 to get the days travelling. I don\'t think that it would be
economically efficient to try the 5 day schedule let alone the daily scheduling.

Wouldn\'t drop tanks become a travel hazard since you\'re using the same route
repeatedly?

Ah, but when the Arrival Vengence arrived at Trin, it carried a letter from
Strephon confirming the elevation of Norris to the Archduchy of Deneb.  So
it was legal all along.  I love power politics.

Minor quibble.  Strephon *confirmed* Norris\' elevation.  This minor legal
point makes Norris the legal Archduke of Deneb from the day of his
announcement.  The paperwork just got held up for nine years.

II. Asteroid Navigation
- ----

Suppose you wanted a breakneck dogfight in an asteroid field
a la Star Wars?  Here\'s what I thought might go into it:


Asteroid belts can be wide or narrow, dense or sparse.
The number of turns it takes to go _through_ an asteroid
field depends on width:

narrow  : 4 combat turns
moderate: 8 combat turns
wide    : 12 combat turns

To get through the asteroid belt, both the pilot AND astrogator
must roll once per turn to avoid belt debris.  The difficulty
is average if the belt is sparse; increase by one difficulty level
if it is moderately dense, or two levels if it is dense.  Likewise,
decrease the difficulty by one level if the crew is being careful
and slow, or increase the difficulty by one level if the crew is
being hasty (or in a dogfight).

Asteroid damage can be fatal, since they are generally just large 
massive objects colliding with your ship.  Let\'s say one impact
does 2d6 hits to your ship, and roll on the damage table.

Needless to say, small craft will get pummelled if they hit one
of these babies.

With these kind of odds, you better have a really good pilot/
navigator set.

I am working on a program to generate PostScript sector/subsector maps.
Right now, I have a rather hostile command line based one that reads data
in a somewhat arcane format, but it runs on Macs and PCs.

The current push is to put in a good GUI interface and implement in Java.
At this point, I can select the appropriate subsectors to draw, and it
generates most of the Postscript.  I need to fix a few other things before
it is ready for a first beta, but it should be done fairly soon.
(Depending on how my ever-present job hunt goes.)

As has been pointed out, the xboat system was one of the reforms that
Arbellatra Alkhalikoi instituted as regent immediately after the end
of the Imperial Civil War.  At that time, the highest tech level that
was generally available was 13, so the system was instituted at jump-4.

Prior to that, mail crossing the empire traveled through the regional
postal unions, which mainly operated at the county to subsector level.
These were operated by the member worlds, not by the Imperium, and were
one of the few interstellar associations worlds could have that the 
empire tolerated.  Many followed the general outline of pre-Imperial
pocket empires.  These tended to operate at average speeds of jump-2 
or below, as local technology and trade supported.  I get the idea
that after the xboat system is in place, they continue to operate as
feeder systems between member worlds and the nearest xboat nodes.

Besides Imperiallines and similar operations, there\'s another mention
of jump-6 xboat traffic in early Traveller.  Some TNS entries circa
1105-1106 mention the Imperium beginning to institute drop-tank equipped
jump-6 xboats on major links, supposedly to integrate Regina by 1115.
A similar project to build high-capacity liners for Tukera was plagued 
by problems at the General Products fabrication plant on Pixie, which
culminated in the Trimkhana-Brilliance disaster.  (Drop tanks failed
to separate cleanly on jump insertion.)  My reading is that between
the war and possible engineering problems, the project was set back
by years.  However, this would fit in with MT/TNE comments regarding
Strephon\'s interest in reforms to tie the empire together more closely.
I also get the impression that the Core-Marches link was considered one
of the more important segments, so if that part of the project got
derailed, it\'s no wonder we don\'t see much other evidence of its
existence.

Others have mentioned that the reason j4 is used for xboats is for military
and political reason -- i.e., knowledge is power, and the military and
government want that power. My question is then -- why was the xboat
network established at the maximum jump capable at the time? Surely the
people that instiuted it knew about the knowledge=power thing.

 I think what I will do later on tonight if I can, is look at the spinward
marches, and consider what it would take to create an X-boat route that
cuts time off from the amount of time it takes for information to reach
from one diagonal to the next...  At that point, when I do it, I will make
note of the "locations" of the x-boat routes and the "revised" routes and
see how well they compare.  I will also look at how long it takes for
information to reach high pop worlds...
  It does occur to me as well, that there can be "official" X-boats and
unofficial X-boats.  The unofficial boats are created by private
governments to link up to official x-boats in order to speed up their
turnaround times...

  Two answers to this question.  The first answer is "recycling".  If it is
commercially worth the effort - a simple radio beacon on the jump tank plus
an ordinary Manuevere ship can get those tanks easily enough...

 The second answer is "an object in motion remains in motion unless acted
upon by an outside force.  This means that the drop tanks are going away
from the "exit jump point" and eventually, if they have stellar escape
speed, leaving the system etc...

I would guess that the xboat network was established as the fastest
possible at the time.  As technology progressed, the xboat network
was left alone, maybe because it was too much trouble to upgrade the
whole network or maybe because the bureaucracy was just too sluggish
to change.   The military would, of course, take advantage of these
advances, and use J-6.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

IMO, it looks like Arbellatra established the system with a high vision
of rapid communication throughout the Empire. "We shall join the Empire
together with a system of communication, X-Boats, and they will have the
fastest jump drives our technology can create!" - once
you have an idea like that, it\'s hard to go with second best. Besides, there
were already swarms of Jump-2 scout/COURIERS plying the spaceways...
there weren\'t enough jump numbers to fit between "best available for secret
government stuff" and "Jump-2 ships everyone has" to allow X-Boats to not
be the best.

It was only later, as jump-5 and jump-6 became available, that Emperors
and their servants recognized the possibilities. The expense and disruption 
of upgrading the X-Boat system to Jump-5+ was a legitimate reason it stayed
at Jump-4, but not the only reason.

large the Vland and Sylean Jump 1 Mains are.

Vland Jump-1 Main cuts a largely diagonal swath from 1209 Lishun all the
way down to 0102 Ilelish.  It was a large concentration in the southern
sub-sectors of Vland (virtually all systems in subsectors
g,h,k,l,m,n,o,p and Lishun e, i, m.  It goes as far coreward as 1701,
1901 Vland (and possibly beyond - I don\'t have maps for other sectors).

Sylea Jump-1 Main is less regular in apperance.  It most easily though
of as three branches, roughly centered at 0622 Core  (this assumes you
don\'t consider Zarashugar).

From 0622 Core, it travels in an expanding triangle trailing to 2615
Core and 2625 Core.

From 0622 Core spin/coreward to 2412, 2512 Dagudashag.

From 0622 Core rim/spinward to large cluster in Subsector P Dagudashag
with 2437 Dag. as the most spinward system.  That branch then turn
trail/rimward to 1305, 1404 Masilia.

Interesting notes:
This gives the Sylean Jump-1 Main a rough semi-circle around the
Chanestin Kingdom.  It also seems to skirt much of the main systems of
the Interstellar Confederacy in subsectors A,B, C, E, and F of Core.

I\'ll do Antares next.

I greatly welcome any campaign plot elements this information might be
useful with regard to, especially circa Mileu 0.

Any requests for other mains?

It\'s also detailed in Survival Margin, in an excerpt from Norris\'
personal journal. That excerpt also says that this wasn\'t the first time
Norris had used a blank Imperial Warrant in this fashion...

" I commemorated Strephon\'s death today by taking his name in vain, and
tomorrow I will appear in public and lie, using his name again. Therefore
my first act as Archduke will be to confidentially issue myself a full and
complete pardon. Or not.

	It was a strange sensation. I\'ve done it before, of course, using
the warrant in Strephon\'s name to dispose of that buffon Santanocheev.."

SM, p10

Of course it could have been both: 

Rebellion Sourcebook, p56 says: "..one of Strephon\'s last official acts
was to elevate Norris to the vacant position of Archduke of Deneb..." 

But Norris had no way of knowing that once Strephon had been assasinated;
the official proclamation was probably sitting on some bureaucrats desk
when the chaos of the rebellion broke out.

comment made in both V&V and the AM on them about how their society is so
chaotic that their own historical records are fairly much a joke.  About the
comment that the Vargr must view Human societies as these monlithic ever
forward creeping structures...  And as the mind wandered making connection I
suddenly thought that the Solomani must apear to many of the other species and
societies in Known Space to be slightly less chaotic Vargr!
    Think about it.  The Vilani have managed to mantain a continuous culture
and social organization since pretty much about the time they invented writing.
The Zhodani are fairly much the same, as are the K\'kree, the Hivers, even the
Aslan can maintain that they have a social and cultural continuity that is
unbroken.  Yet the Terrans, and their successors the Solomani, appear to be
constantly changing Everything in a historical sense.
    The Terrans have utterly spotty records of their early history, in fact
they had to invent a science to go back and piece together the fragments that
managed to survive!  Then there\'s that bit with the European Dark Ages, the
African and native American "forgetfullness" in leaving behind written records.
The distressing Imperial Chinese propensity to rewrite history to justify
current trends.  And look at the one organization that does last for millenia,
the Christians have this terrible habit of burning and destroying priceless
historical and other records to justify illogical bits of their belief system.
    Then they get into to space and the first of their governments to achieve
the most "Firsts" (Soviets) disappears with a few decades of doing them!  And
the whole sorry story keeps going on.  They roar out to beat up and destroy the
Zira Sirka, only to replace it with an Empire that barely manages to survive
four hundred years before collapsing!

    With all this in mind, I suspect that the Solomani are looked apon as only
slightly less chaotic than the Vargr by everyone else.  Thoughts?

You know, everything seemed a little strange until the second day. Steve
invited me into his office, and then he had me sit down in this funny chair
and put this icky grey thing on my neck. Since then, everything has been
absolutely wonderful, and the stuff that seemed weird at first (the incubators
in the basement, the unmarked trucks coming and going at odd hours, the funny
smells from the warehouse) now make perfect sense.

Well, I can see why they were irked.  The _Travelers_ Aid Society has been

  While a Jumpboat actually did get past the editors without a powerplant,

  Can anyone remember where the reference is regards to how much energy one
can find in a storage device for CT ships?  I recall that in general there
was supposed to be something like 1d6 days of power available once a
Powerplant went down.  However, this may have been a "house rule" rather
than a real rule.

  Also  on the note of house rules...

  Can anyone tell me why HG chose to make jump drives cost 3.0 (or is it
4?) Mcr despite the average costs of jump drives in BOOK 2 of the classic
set seeminly pegging them at half that price?  Currently, I am using the
idea of making those drives 1/2 the cost for designs.  While this won\'t
affect ship costs for the larger ships all that much, it will affect the
"commercial" costs for things such as Small traders and such.

Ships in general operations probably run all their waste-heat radiators at
moderate temperatures. In combat it makes more sense to run a few radiators
at much higher temperatures (which strains the radiators but reduces 
detection probability.) So a military ship will divert all waste heat to a
few radiators - and, if it has any idea where the enemy might be coming
from, it\'ll "roll to mask radiators" - turning so those face away from the
enemy. Ships with advanced masking are also able to cool the metal of their
hulls down to reduce their thermal signature still further, so they\'ll 
start cooling the hull down.

a) and b) are definite on waships.  On merchants your milage may vary
(ymmv) but every player group I have run has done this.

Explosive decompression can have severe effects on stuff in general, as
well as the sturctural integrity of a ship.  Of course, if you\'re at that
point your probably in Troube anyway...

Also remember that in most combat systems Traveller has had, a combat round
in space is a long time, like 30 minutes, and even disregarding that, most
systems allow ships to know "someone" is "out there" well before the lasers
start flying.  Hence the time factor is pretty irrelevant.

No opinion on this. (Suprise!)

I hadn\'t thought about this one either.  I guess its just as good an idea
as (b).  With everyone strapped in there\'s no effect on crew performance,
but it will quickly reveal anything that isn\'t strapped down properly, and
probably make a mess of everyone\'s cabins too.

OTOH, it will make damage control a problem, since crew required to move
around will need to be zero-G qualified, but this is a minor issue.

The program is available on the Pan-Imperia webpage (see address

can\'t guarantee when a bug-free (as much as software gets) version
will ever be available (as Real Life(tm) gets Real Busy quite often);

The original poster was looking for a justification for the high cost per
person every two weeks of life support.  2KCr/week is very, very high,
unless each passenger gets a quart jar of diamonds as a souvenir.

Given this desire, your suggestions of insurance is a good one for some of
the money, but I do not think this is large enough to cover the
astronomical figure.  In my universe, this is just not the case - life
support costs are pretty trivial compared to other fees.

Only the Frontier Wars were minor blips on the Imperial scale.  They only

This is a standard with me.  Why risk losing a critical system to a blown
piece of debris when you can minmize the [problem by sucking all the air
out.  Also eleiminates the chance of fires.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Partly for cinematic reasons, I don\'t have a suit up/decompress/zero G standard IMTU. Also, it fits most of the artwork from Traveller stuff showing ship crews in action.

We make up for it with compartmentalization, housekeeping discipline, emergency equipment close at hand, and lots and lots of Vacc suit drills.

Vacc Suit Drills: Considering the time duration of many "General Quarters" situations, it would be a major performance loss to have the crew in cumbersome vacc suits for six, eight, twelve hours. I have damage control parties suited up (or in Engineering Armor), but even they would have open faceplates. One of their first jobs would be to enter a breached section and grab the crewmen who couldn\'t get to their suits and had to hop in a rescue ball instead. Rescue balls, of course, will be in convenient compartments all over the place - one under each workstation chair (like lifejackets on a passenger airplane) would be a good place to start.

Compartmentalization - bulkheads and iris valves instead of partitions and privacy doors. Not everywhere, but around every area where people work during a General Quarters situation. This should serve to limit the atmosphere loss from a penetrating strike. Realize, as well, that with proper compartmentalization there won\'t be much of a problem with decompression: if you were close enough to the penetrating strike to lose air, you were probably close enough to get killed by it anyway. Also, design all ships so that there is more than one path of pressure-tight compartments between every critical area - Bridge to Sick Bay, Sick Bay to Engineering, Engineering to Main Avionics, etc. Yes, it makes the ship harder to defend when repelling boarders (a rare occurance), but it simplifies the work of Damage Control parties and should make the ship more battle-worthy.  Look at how (wet)Navy submarines handle this problem - you don\'t see US Navy Sub Crewmen on duty wearing SCUBA gear, do!
 you?

Housekeeping Discipline - there\'s a reason the Marine Drill Sergeant yelled at you to keep your area neat and clean. "Shipshape" is a term used, among other things, for an area where everything is properly put away. When things are locked up in sufficiently sturdy lockers, debris doesn\'t blow around during a hull breach incident. Or an inertial dampener failure. Or a bumpy ride from nearby meson blasts...

As for Zero-G, I think I agree with Douglas - these artificial gravity and inertial compensators must be very reliable, perhaps to the point that everything else would fail first. I recall, during the Solomani Rim War, an Azhanti High Lightning Cruiser was lost (Bard Echo? slips my mind...) - anyway, while the powerless, blasted hulk of the cruiser was spiralling downwards in a decaying orbit, Solomani Marines tried to board it for possible salvage. Even though the ship was in this hopeless state, the artificial gravity was still working just fine (ref: GDW\'s _Azhanti High Lightning_ game).


In sub-1000tn ships and civilian ships some different protocols apply. Some of these vessels will have only one pressure tight compartment, or have extensive multi-use pressure compartments. Some may have no inertial compensators at all. Many passengers may have never put on a Vacc suit before, much less be able to don one in an emergency. These vessels may well be forced to use protocols similar to those mentioned previously - Vacc suits, strapped in etc. Fightercraft and other small-craft gunboats will have Vacc (or G-?) suits as a matter of course anyway.

The _Space Shuttle Operators Manual_ had some interesting bits on damage control and emergency procedures - fire/smoke in the cabin, pressure loss, etc. Some of the emergency procedures seemed a little odd, though - the manual told you what to do if you crash-landed in the middle of the wilderness. Why do I get the feeling that if the Shuttle came down in the middle of the Australian Outback, there would still be people waiting for it?

Both of these are canon military procedure.  They were first described in
CT Book 2, (under "Procedures", IIRC), but I don\'t remember if they made
it into TTB (which is strage, because I own TTB but not Book 2).  I also
don\'t know if they got into the SOM.  But they do come straight from The
Man Himself.

It follows that anyone with common sense would emulate the behavior of
military personnel when in a combat situation. 

It\'s a perfectly logical procedure.  A beam could pass right thorugh the
compartment and not completely disable it if the compartment is in vacuum,
but with decompression, the compartment is history.

Those costs would be covered by the passage and freight income.  We\'re 
just trying to isolate what is covered in the 2000cr/person/jump fee.

I have always seen DC crews (and other crewmen, for that matter) using powered

    'body' => 'The T4 version of Fire, Fusion & Steel has some nice bits about food 
and life support.

Standard life support costs Cr 5,600 per 100T of ship and has (my 
estimate) a running cost of Cr4,200 per two weeks [p78 and Table 
208 on p111]

Standard Food Supply costs 819 cr per person and is for two weeks food 
plus one weeks emergency rations [Table 211 on p111].

If we assume an "average" shp that PCs will be using, crew + passengers 
is around 1 per 25 T.

Thus, we have 1050 cr life support + 819 Cr food = 1869 Cr for two 
weeks ... pretty close to the summary value of Cr 2000.

[handwave = on]

Imperial law requires you to carry two weeks food + one weeks emergency 
rations - to allow for delays, jumping in a long way from the 
destination and "emergencies".  Due to the shelf life of normal food, 
you are assumed to throw away any that is not consumed.  Although 
e-rations have a long shelf life (TL years), only the most 
cost-concious captains (or stewards on the make) would fail to keep the 
e-rations up to date at every opportunity.

Similarly, to allow a safety buffer, the life support filters should be 
replaced after each trip ... you could run with half-used filters, but 
if anything went wrong, the Imperial inspector would be most 
displeased!

[handwave = off]

OK, we can reasonable reproduce the Cr 2000 life support cots, byt FFS 
gives us cheaper alternatives.  If we install type IV (extended) life 
support, it costs us a little on the ship\'s purchase but saves on 
long-term running costs:

Type IV = Cr 22,400 per 100 T of ship but lasts forever and uses up 
just under 1 T of cargo space.  So with type IV life support you save 
4,200 Cr per trip and lose 1 T of cargo profit ... is that Cr 1,000 or 
Cr 4,200 for an average speculative cargo?  I\'ll let you choose!

If we scrimp on food and reply our e-rations once per year we can save 
210 Cr/trip.  If we only carry less fresh food and more e-ratios we can 
get our food costs down to 252 Cr per person (one week only).

So the minimum life support cost per person is
252 cr (food)
0.25 T of cargo space
12 cr (annula replacement of 2 weeks of e-rations)

total = 264 Cr + 0.25 T of cargo space.

Of course, you can save even more by using lower quality food:

meagre (airline food):
75 cr + 0.25 T of cargo

normal (frozen microwave meals - minimum quality of middle passage)
117 cr + 0.25T of cargo


If you want to use the exra detail in FFS, you can run your ship for a 
lot less money, or you can follow Imperial regs and spend Cr 2,000 per 
person per trip (and let the PC steward figure out his "take" for 
cooking the books instead of the food!) 


Note: where did I get that 4,200 Cr/two weeks running cost from?  p78 
of FFS says that you can extend the duration of type III life support 
by two weeks for 75% of the installed cost - I take this to be the cost 
of extra filters, scrubbing chemicals, oxygen, etc and therefore 
represents the running cost.

I have no real problem with the Imperium retaining the jump-4 X-boat
network once it was in place, since I can imagine the enormous lobbying
the X-boat manufacturers must have done to keep it, but it is not such
an obvious thing. It\'s true that no one would scrap a brand new jump-4
X-boat and buy a jump-5 instead just because jump-5 boats have just
become possible. But at any given time some 2.5% of the X-boats are 
about to be replaced and in another 40 years all of them will have been
up for replacements. So you could start by adding a few jump-5 legs
where the astrography makes it efficient. Say you have two important
worlds 10 parsecs away. The present system handles that by three X-boats
that all jump short. Now you can replace them with two jump-5 boats and
shift the jump-4 boats to someplace else. You\'d propably keep buying
new jump-4 boats for legs that are exactly 4 parsecs long (Frankly, IMTU
short legs are handled by jump-1, -2, and -3 Xboats; I don\'t believe that
the saving from standardization outweighs the added cost of the ship for
the short legs, but that by the way), but in a century or so the network
could easily have been improved to the point where the major spokes were
jump-5. The same process could have been employed when jump-6 became
available.

However, it is established canon that it wasn\'t, and I don\'t think that\'s
a problem. As I said, that\'s a political decision, and who ever said a
political decision had to make sense?

(A suggestion: Let\'s use the word X-boat for the maneuver-less boats that
need tenders and use courier for independent starships.)

Yes, that was in the TNS bulletin about drop tanks, c. 1105. Note that
there is a slight continuity problem there: Since the ship design system
was changed from CT (and MT? I forget) it is now possible to have a 100 T
jump-6 ship, which actually makes two jump-6 X-boats cheaper than three
jump-4 boats...

Anyway, one of the two big problems with the "Norris got the news before
everybody else" notion is that it is extremely unlikely that there wouldn\'t
be more than the two jump-6 networks that we already know of (Naval and
Imperiallines) (Incidentally, those two networks alone makes at least seven
people other than Norris that would have the news, the sector dukes for
Deneb, Trojan Reach and Reft (and wasn\'t Duchess Delphine the sector duke
of Spinward Marches?) and the sector admirals for the four sectors. Plus
whatever code clerks and flag captains and flag lieutenants and secretaries
and confidential advisers that learned of it along the way).

Information is valuable, especially prior information. Just imagine how
useful it would be for a megacorporation to have information a few months
in advance of everybody else. Then imagine how big a DISadvantage it would
be for a megacorporation NOT to have such information when some other
megacorporation did. To me that spells out a minimum of 14 more jump-6
networks (Or possibly one shared one). Oh, not nearly as extensive as the
X-boat network, but I bet the Regional managers for Deneb and the Spinward
Marches would have a courier link to Capital. That makes at least 28 more
people who would know (42 or 56 if Trojan Reach and Reft have separate
regional managers) ...plus whatever people they told. We\'re getting into
the hundreds of people now. Just how likely is it that none of them would
leak it to the press? (For that matter, imagine how valuable a courier link
would be to a sector-wide news network; the odds are that there is at least
one such). How likely is it that Norris would assume that none of these
people would leak it?

Then there are the Domain nobles who happen to be on Capital when the
balloon goes up. They get stuck there for some days because the port is
closed, and they lose additional days refuelling on the way back, but
any of them who have jump-6 yachts will still outrun the X-boat network.

But the second problem is the clincher: Even if Norris was the only one
to get the advance warning, he would know that the official news would
get there eventually, and people can count. Anyone who knew of the
secret network or of the navy couriers would be able to count back and
KNOW that Norris\' elevation had been announced after HE got the news of
the assasination.

Actually, the second problem may serve to explain the first. There were
propably a lot who at least suspected that Norris\' elevation was bogus,
but they either didn\'t want to or didn\'t dare to challenge him. And
Norris was canny enough to know that no one would dare to, or at least
that it was a good bet, so he went ahead and did it despite knowing
full well that a lot of people would suspect. So his big, dark secret
is really not such a secret at all, but people pretend that it is.

Another is to have 8-10 X-boats for each leg, at least on the major spokes.
That would allow for daily jumps, with an occasional day missed when the
jump durations combine to mess up the schedule, but that would only
happen rarely. I can\'t off-hand recall that it is explicitly stated
anywhere that the X-boat service is weekly. Can anybody supply such a
reference?

You\'d have a shuttle fetch back the used drop tanks for reuse. They are
easily worth the cost.

	Furthermore, all of the above expenses, with the exception of
registration and insurance, are already paid separately. The 2kCr per
week is stated as life support, etc. for that passenger. Filters,
oxygen, food, cleaning, etc.  And 2kCr is probably fairly high. FF&S2
gives more specific details about food requirements, but I don\'t
believe it addresses the cost of other consumables.

with some additions to the accomodations table.  While they are intended for

Republic using them in their ship designs).  Basic staterooms, etc. are
included for comparison:

Remember that x-boats jump precisely once per week, since data is almost
instantly relayed to the next waiting boat, for a travel rate of 0.6
parsecs per day. A jump-6 boat can only spend two days per jump refuelling
to keep up with this - which is barely adequate unless you\'ve made initial
arrangements all along the route, and also gets pretty tiring for the crew
very quickly. Most jump-6 yachts will arrive later than the jump-4 xboat
news, even along major routes. 

Note also that you need a *lot* of ships to maintain something competetive
with the x-boat network (let alone the secret jump-6 network); saving those
1-3 days of refuelling time makes a big difference in travel time for news.
An x-boat style system needs perhaps ~10 ships per system on the network
to keep delays down to 1 day per system or less and allow for refuelling and
maintenance. A network with maneuver-capable ships that refuell and jump
requires less, obviously, but begins to suffer from the issue of how much
time it takes to refuel.

Thats hilarious!  They obviously didn\'t understand anything about trademark law.
Now if FFE, GDW, etc., were to try to sell such products to those in the market for

Unless your hull was really, really thin - and I\'ve seen some arguments (from the Cyberpunk 2020 role playing game\'s space supplements) that say go all the way one way or the other - either have a hull several meters thick, or have one you could almost put your hand through. It seems medium-thickness hulls have this tendency to turn harmless cosmic rays into slightly less-than harmless radiations.

If you are including power costs and maintenance costs, those numbers are
included in your maintenance rules.  Power is essentially free, and the
payment for that power is subsumed in the monthly mortgage costs (ie, you
are paying for th initial capital investment via your mortgage).

How did you get the 1050 value?  Also, assuming that 1 credit is worth
maybe 2.5 american dollars (was worth 2 dollars in 1994 according to Marc
Miller in THE TRAVELLER CHRONICLE 2 oct/nov/dec 1993, page 49), we get a
two week cost value of approximately $5,000.  I very seriously doubt that
food costs will be worth $2,048 for two weeks, when a month\'s grocery
bills today is worth about what, maybe $400 for a family of 3 or 4?

  Ok, let\'s look at what goes into life support.  If anyone has ideas of
what should be on this list, feel free to add to it:

Filters for air
Filters for water
Possibly fuel for heat sources
replacement parts for crucial components such as fans and such (but this
   rightfully belongs in the maintenance section...)
Food: fresh and frozen along with vacuum sealed packages.
Water
Consumables such as toiletries
Consumables such as toliet paper
If using "airline prepackaged food trays" maybe the price for food would
   be higher...
I am drawing a blank on anythings else...

  I suspect that the costs should not be at the 2000 credits mark, but
related to the cost of passengers and lifestyle maintenance.  In other
words, High passage ticket holders might expect somewhat better food,
along with the service... and people who have to live on the ship
constantly would need some "luxeries" to help with their lifestyles.  It
is one thing that I have noted about personality types for spacers that
either they want to stretch their legs after being cooped up in what would
be a "bedroom" by todays standard for at least 168 hours, or be the type
that says "I like the comfort of having walls I can touch and not see the
horizon".

Theoretically, the emergency rats should be hoarded until approximately 1
week of their expiration date.  Thus, if there was only one person to
survive a ship crash, and there was enough rations for 20 weeks - ie
originally the ship carried rations for 10 people for 2 weeks, then the
max before expiration date that anyone needs for those rations is 20
weeks.  I seriously doubt that exchanging emergency rats would be worth
considering as a major cost in "upkeep".

I see what you did now.  Ok.  Question is: is that the extra cost for
extra capacity vie equiment, or via consumables?  I don\'t think oxygen is
going to be a factor in cost here.  What is to keep a ship from opening
it\'s ports and letting out the internal air, and taking in fresh?  What is
to keep compressors from taking native air and compressing it for the
ships "reserve" air in case of accidental decompression?  When you
evacuate the air for a hold, where does that air go to?  I think you get
my drift here.  Scrubbing chemicals might be expensive, that I don\'t know
- - which is what the original intent was of this post - what could possibly
cost close to $5000 American, for one week\'s habitation?  Even if we use
each credit equals $2 per, we end up with approximately $4000 per week\'s
worth of habitation, and that my friend, is approximately $500 per day!
Granted, living in open atmosphere is easier than in an enclosed
environment, but do you realize the implications here?  At $500 per day of
lifesupport costs, a protected environment such as a biobubble would be on
the same order of costs, and even at $100 per day, it would cost $36,500
per year to maintain a person in such an environment.  Thus, in Traveller,
people living on Airless worlds should be paying a minimum of $3500 per
week plus living expenses...


> 
> Simon
> 
> 

  In summation, I thing it would be best to assume a more moderate
approach to the costs (assuming you want to be realistic here).  A
standard cost of normal weekly expenses for a planet bound person, plus
maybe a fee equal to about 1% of the cost for life support that you
originally paid for the life support system.  Note, the 1% is ten times
the normal "maintenance" costs for ship systems as per classic rules...

  Also, can anyone tell me the answer to this?  On page 79, it states that
good meals cost 12 credits.  A full two weeks worth is 504 credits.  A
week\'s worth of emergency rations is 210 credits.  This totals to 714
credits... not 819 listed in the book.  Is this an errata that needs to be
addressed, or am I barking up the wrong tree?  Also, why is it 2 week\'s
worth of food?  Ship puts down on landing apron.  Crew find lodging in a
spacer hotel or stay on board ship.  Passengers leave.  Crew work at minor
maintenance and upon unloading cargo.  Crew take liberty and/or look for
new cargo etc...  Captain decides where his next port of call is.  Files a
departure date, and tentative flight plan.  Crew then load their new cargo
on board, load new passengers, who don\'t embark until the last possible
minute.  Ship takes off, and reaches 100 planetary diameters - jumping
into jumpspace.  Ship then exits after the week, and then travels to the
planet of destination.
  How much time are we talking about here?  At most, what, 8 days?  That
means there will be some 6 days worth of meals not consumed...

  It is my contention that for a commercial concern, some of these
"figures" are not where I would expect them to be.  Perhaps my
expectations are off (which is why I am detailing my thoughts, for people
to spot the errors and point them out <Grin>), but unless some people can
come up with a good reason to maintain a 2 Kcr cost for lifesupport of
staterooms, I will be dropping it to at least half that.  Remember, the
two week turn around time for ship travel isn\'t time spent in space, it
includes time spent in port, time prepping for take offs, and time spent
landing at ports etc...

4g is the limit for *sustained* acceleration. They mention higher
levels being possible in acceleration tanks.

18 g is the limit for "muscular control" In other words, above 18 g,
forget being able to manipulate controls.

83g was the highest accel they put anyone thru.

But from the above, this means that for vehicles such as fighters, you
can run them at 4g above the g-comp essentially *indefinitely*! Ships
can only do this if there\'s no need for the crew to move *and* they are
taking the acceleration "lying down".

The 18g limit would mean that if you could afford the drive to do so, a
fighter could to occasional dodging manevuers at 18g above g-comp.

And the 83g limit would apply to things like escape pods or ejection
seats that only apply an acceleration for a (very!) few seconds.

Thios should make a *big* difference in fighter design. In M0 with 3g
of compensation, this means that you design a fighter for a *minimum*
of 7g. , and consider adding the capability of brief 21g "sprints".

I\'d suggest that g tolerance limits be developed for Aslan, Hivers,
Vargyr, K\'Kree, and the other non-human races. I\'d expect K\'kree to
have fairly low tolerances due to their body plan and sheer size. And
Hivers look like they\'d be able to handle more acceleration than most.

The trick is that without an atmosphere ice is *not* stable except at
*very* low temps. That means that it can\'t be in the "life zone".
Jupiter is on the edge. Europa almost certainly *does* have a thin
atmosphere of water vapor. 

By the time you get to Saturn, *small* chunks of ice (the rings) are stable.

In the US Navy, sailers go to General Quarters with lifejackets folded up
in a \'fanny-pack\' type thing, a gas mask in a bag on the hip, long sleeve
shirts totally buttoned up, and pant legs tucked into socks.  They now also
where flashgear that consists of lightwieght gloves that have elastic
sealing them past the elbows, and a flashhood that almost totally covers
the head.  This is the bare minimum, damage control parties wear a lot
more.  This would almost be the equivelent of a vacc suit, and is far from
comfortable.

This would probably be based on the situation.

This makes since to me, as a real danger could be a temporary loose of
gravity.  When the gravity came back on people could really get slammed
around.

Fraid not.  Win CE is using some wierd non-Intel processor.  Interesting
question though, I\'ve no idea what it requires or how hard it would be.
While it\'s a shame about the Newton the word is they\'re working on a
version of "MacOS Lite" that will run on a Next generation Newton/E-pad.
This sounds preferable, since you would undoubtably be able to recompile
your MacOS code as long as you aren\'t using any high-end features that
wouldn\'t be supported.

There is an article on Win32 / CE development and software compatibility
in this month\'s issue of Dr. Dobb\'s Journal (the "Algorithms" issue).  I
give my take on the upshots below (ObTrav at bottom).

On Thu, 5 Mar 1998, Rob Prior wrote:

Eeeeeeevil!!!  :)

Windows CE is a tiny little version of desktop Windows with a truncated
API, 240 x 480 max resolution and 4 colors.

It also depends on whether you\'re talking v1 or v2 (there\'s a box on that
in the article).

None, AFAIK.

> If I write Windows 95 software, will it run on CE? 

Very, very doubtful.  Software *will* migrate in the other direction
though.

Depends on how you\'re interfacing with the API.  If you\'re using
somebody\'s application framework, and there\'s a CE version of the
framework available, it shouldn\'t be too bad.

> I currently have CodeWarrior, which claims to write Windows 95/NT

Erg.  Nothing about MetroWerks stuff in the article.  Everything the
author had to say was in relation to MSVC++ (v5 IIRC).

The article seems to imply that you need a special linker package to put
CE software together (although the executables will run on desktop), and
then proceeded to go through a *long* list of headaches involved in this
process.  Apparently, Microsoft markets a special version / extension of
MSVC++ for the purpose of developing CE software.  There are conditional
compilation flags and special libraries to consider.  CE development is
done on a desktop; there is a simulation environment of some kind
available for early tests.  After that, you put your executable in the
palmtop via serial cable, then test. 

> and can I get one for free
> anywhere?

I don\'t know, but I doubt it.  We are talking about Microsoft, after all,
and the tech is not very old yet.  Best of luck, though. 

ObTrav:  This is kind of related to that discussion I had with Leonard a
couple of months ago about ROM pack distribution of software.  Palmtops
are a technology where ROM packs really are used to distribute software. 
The point was raised in the discussion that a special development platform
would be required.  Wouldn\'t it be nasty if someone hacked into the LAN of
some development house and put a date-triggered trojan horse into a
production run of palmtop ROM packs?  Bankruptcy!

Well, that\'s my shot at an ObTrav remark, anyway.  :)

Ooops -- you\'re right.  There is an x86 emulator available though,
somehow, somewhere.  There is a simulation environment available for your
desktop that allows you to test CE programs without having to deal with
the palmtop until absolutely necessary.

Like in _Mote in God\'s Eye_, the Navy could but usually didn\'t, the
merchants only did about 1G, because they didn\'t have the acceleration
couches, etc for sustained high-G maneuvering.

But unless the acceleration is constant from only one direction they\'re
probably going to be unconcious by then.

IIRC an old friend who worked as an armourer for the Air Force siad that
old ejection seats did rather more than that.

Other ships would also benefit, of course - large ships would be at
comp+4Gs for combat.

I find that kind of scary, but totally consistent with the behavior of the
military in the 1950s.  I went back and calculated something: 

If my car goes from a velocity of 100 kph to 0 kph in 0.1 seconds (typical
high-speed accident), my body is pressed against the seat belts with force
roughly corresponding to 28 G.  83 G is almost triple that. 

Assuming that I\'m snug in a couch with solid support under every bone, and
the acceleration was forcing me into the support, I might be able to take
it, but I expect that 83 G will kill an older person.  Their tissues just
can\'t take the strain. 

How were these tests conducted?

Yikes.  18/28 * 100 = 64 kph to 0 kph in 0.1 seconds.  Still not fun.  It
probably works though, since acceleration is always exactly forward.  The
body must be well supported.

The sprints might work with a big array of little EPlaC (sp?) charges on
the back of the ship.

I agree, but have no applicable knowledge.  I\'d like to see the results if
somebody else does it, though.

	I wouldn\'t want to depend on the reflexes or judgement of anybody
flying at 4g sustained ... even though it\'s physiologically possible,
it\'s *tiring*. Even breathing requires more effort than normal. How
did they define limit? Subject managed to remain conscious and
coherent? Was it wearing a g-suit or performing a g-strain maneuver?
What kind of activities did they have the subject perform while at
4gs?

	I seriously mistrust the idea of +4g *sustained*--for a few minutes,
as part of a combat maneuver, yes. IIRC, manned space launches are in
that region (Shuttle at ~3, Saturn a bit higher?). But as for running
for hours at +4 ...

I believe that since the wording contained the phrase "confirmed", Strephon
simply used the rebellion as an excuse for the paperwork being delayed, and
supported Norris\' move all the way back to 1116.

Thanks.

Could you tell me what the _oldest_ version of the compiler I need to use
to write CE software? (Assuming that the article says.) One of my students
can get outdated (one version old) Microsoft products really cheaply (he
has a friend who works at Microsoft, I think) - genuine shrink-wrapped
software with serial numbers and everything.

Our Metrowerks license is "academic", which I think means we have to pay
for updates. I can\'t justify that for the school when it\'s only my
computer that needs the update, and I can\'t afford to upgrade the school\'s
50-unit lab pack myself.

ObTrav: Well, any software I write will be Traveller software.  If You can
migrate CE-to-95/NT without much trouble, then you lot might be getting
your Windows Metator a _lot_ quicker than you thought. Or I thought,
either. These palmtop computers are really the way to go for game-aid
software (as opposed to game-preparation software.)

ecause the purpose of the x-boat networks is not *just* to deliver mail
from core to the fringe. It is to *distribute* information *throughout*
the empire. 

Such deep space links might be used in places where there aren\'t any
nearby worlds that are worthy of notice. But in most cases, the "relay"
points will be places where data is not only passed on, but also picked
up and dropped *locally*.

Oh yeah, one other thing. Barring some sort of "magic" technology, it
will actually be *faster* to *physically* link the two xboats for the
data transfer. The bandwidth required for the transfer is just too high
to be done practically over a "beam" type link. 

Expect the cable for the link to be several *dozen* optical fibers
running at terabit rates. You\'d be lucky to get a tight beam link to
run as fast as *one* fiber. And you can\'t use multiple "beams" at any
sort of range worth mentioning. The physical link also helps preserve
security

So I see the Xboat jumping in, and making contact with the tender. The
"public" info ("newspaper" equivalent) will be sent over an unsecure
link at a high rate while the tender rendevous with the X-boat. As soon
as the boat is "docked" the data cables are hooked up. The data is
dumped to the tender and the portions addressed for farther along the
route get passed to the appropriate waiting xboat(s). 

Meanwhile the public stuff is relayed to the planet from the tender
over a comm link. As soon as the download is finished, a courier boat
physically transports the private data to the planet. Medium security
data may get sent by comm link, but the fact is, tthe bandwidth of
phsyically transported high density data storage media is *always* in
excess of the rate at which you can transport it over a comm link.

Right now it\'s quicker to ship a box of CD-R media via FedEx than to
send it over a T-3 link. And it was faster to ship record books than to
send the data over a telegraph line back when we first got the ability
to seperate data transport from physical transport. And it\'s been true
ever since. There\'s no reason to expect this to change in the future.

Still, this makes only a minor difference in the setup of the X-boat
service. The tenders just hang out outside the 100-diameter limit. I
assume that they get relieved often. Major hubs may have an xboat
*station* outside the limit. The tenders would be reduced to mere tugs.

The broadcasting of news leads many people to *assume* that the
private mail is also broadcast. But both security and practical
considerations prevent this.

It has been awhile but here is what I remember:

1. General quarters(Weapons Tight Normally) The Birds on the Rail, arming
pins pulled and two tuned to fire.
2. Reduced Level of GQ but all stations manned by a reduced crew members. 
For me it was called *Chow to Chow* because I was at my weapons console
from breakfast to lunch, off watch until supper(read working), on watch
after supper until Mid Rats (Midnight Rations)(Read Leftovers), sleep until
breakfast, then back on watch. Yes If I was lucky I got 3.5 hours sleep a
day. This I did in the IO(Indian Ocean) for 122 days straight.
3. Normal At Sea Cruising
4. In Harbor or At Anchor, with one quarter of the ship\'s company on board
at any given time. So the ship could get underway/fight if needed. This is
thanks to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

Doug,

Now that I think about it, I rather suspect that mass detectors being
based on gravity *differential*, probably work on an inverse cube law,
just like tidal forces. That means that the sun is a *really* weak
source. But that\'s just a guess.

Bad news. "Independent invention" is *not* a valid defense for patent
infringement. On the other hand, all you did was *describe* it, not
build it, so you are safe.

  LOL!  Hope you don\'t mind, but I\'ve got to tell this story to my trademark law

I don\'t see any reason for a "hard" schedule. A courier jumps from one
system and whenever it arrives in-system, an x-boat or xboats jumps out
along the next links. 

Given the cross-connections on the network, this works much link the
way news propogates over the internet. Whichever link is fastest gets
thru first. It\'s possible that a "longer" route will deliver first,
simply because the xboats on that route all got quick jumps. 

That\'s the way "general" info (ie not destined for a specific
destination) would travel. Any time an xboat\'s news has been received
already via another route, it\'ll just get dropped, just like
"duplicated" news postings.

"Addressed" info would travel over more "deterministic" routes. And
thus sometimes be slower, sometimes faster.

Actually, there\'s a bigger problem. The phone companies *are* putting
in fiber. They just wait until they need to replace or upgrade the
copper in an area, and then put in fiber.

The Imperium has a much worse problem. Because the "optimum" layout for
J5 or J6 xboat routes is *not* the same as for J-4. So you can\'t just
replace on a link by link basis. You have to replace the entire *system*.
And the boundary between the old system and the new system is going to
be a *mess*. Jumps of all sorts of odd lengths and in odd directions.

As I pointed out in another message, you have to keep in mind that the
network does *not* exist to get data from one end to the other at
maximum speed. It exists to transport data to all the points *in* the
network. 

So end-to-end speed may take a second place to minimizing jumps between
strategic points such as subsector capitals. 

Just as the "travelling salesman" routing problem is important to
current theory and practice, the Imperium may have a similar problem
dealing with determining the "optimum" network layout. That\'s not
something I\'d care to be in charge of modelling!

I suspect that like a lot of things it started out as a
military/government only thing. So they wanted the max capability. But
as time went by more and more "special interests" got granted the right
to use it until it was finally made public.

Consider the Global positioning system. It started out military with
"limited" civilian access. Tere are even provisions for eliminating
civilian access in wartime by scrambling the signal. However, it\'s
pentrated so far into things that it\'s doubtful that they\'ll ever use
the scramble option.

Alas, "asteroid fields" or "belts" such as seen in Star Wars and Star
Trek do not and *cannot* exist. If you put that much material that
close together it\'d collect into *thousands* of planets in months at
the most.

The average distance between bodies in a real asteroid belt will be
tens of thousands of km. You have to be incredibly unlucky, or else
*decide* to intercept an asteroid.

In a planetary ring system, you\'ll have smaller particles, closer
together. These can be dense enough to be a hazard. Check the data from
the Voyage missions. One of them went thru a gap in Saturn\'s rings, and
collected some data on their composition.

True but this scenario was probably set up this way only because playing
it in zero G would have been a hastle.

I would hope that artificial gravity and inertial compensators must be
very reliable for safety reasons but the scenario may not be enough
evidence that they are.

Another point to consider is that artificial gravity and inertial
compensators use a lot of power.  There may well be ships whose
artificail gravity and inertial compensators still work fine after the
ship has received battle dammage who have to turn them off anyway
because they can not afford the power since they need it for life
support instead.

[snip lots of good stuff, thanks]

This whole idea is just too useful.  Isn\'t it likely that even the Sylean
Federation would have a diplomatic courier system, similar to the xboats at Jump
2?  In fact, I think this might be even more important in a federation, since it
arguably has a higher potential for fragmentation and miscommunication - not to
mention potential problems like WWI showed).  This allows them to short cut a lot
of loops and arcs in the Sylean main (which I just mapped recently - it goes all
the way to Massilia).

The only real comment I have about the J-4 routes overall, is that they

  It does occur to me as well, that there can be "official" X-boats and

IIRC, CT Traders & Gunboats mentioned that the average jump performed
by X-Boats was only a little over Jump-3 - that is, the route would have the
occaisional Jump-4 but would be mostly Jump-3\'s.

It isn\'t the Jump rating that makes the X-Boat system so fast, btw - it\'s the
turnaround. A merchant ship carrying mail, it jumps in-system, refuels, 
transits to the Starport, unloads cargo, etc.etc.etc - it may spend a week or 
two between jumps.

An X-Boat, on the other hand, hands off it\'s messages as soon as it arrives 
in-system, to another X-Boat that may be leaving within the HOUR. 
Even if both the merchant and the X-Boat are only doing 2-parsec jumps, 
the X-Boat is still twice as fast.

Back to the Jump-4 routes - it may be that efficiency was compromised in return for
cost savings and availability of support facilities. There may also have been any amount
of political wrangling - imagine the economic benefits of being directly on an X-Boat
route. Starport upgrades, information services, heightened interest from commercial
concerns - these prizes would lead many members of the nobility or other planetary leaders
to twist a few arms.

I wouldn\'t be surprised of SuSAG or Hortalez et Cie had their own couriers, with their own
information routes. Some of them might even be Jump-6...

HrHmm..."4 couriers?"..."Once a week?" Son, you can\'t run an empire once a
week, they need this data in Mora within 28 months, not 50!

The following is IMNSHO, IMTU, etc.

The X-Boat system is used for communicating *across the Imperium*, not just
to the next world down the line.  It is maintained by the Imperium kind of
like the U.S. Mail before it became (theoretically) self sufficient, and
probably mail is charged a fee that will pay most of the cost of operation.

The X-Boat system will be enormous and hideously expensive (making a J-6
\'secret\' route harder and harder to believe, but hey! it\'s only a game!),
but it is deemed a necessity and therefore will be maintained at any cost.

Each Station with two Xboat "legs" will maintain at any time the following;

- -45 X-Boats (about 22.5 per destination + as many as the stationhead can
scrounge)
- -6 Tenders (3 per destination)
- -A few dozen personnel and cargo shuttles
- -"Enough" 1000-ton Refueling Boats, assuming wilderness refueling is
available to keep the fleet in fuel (or "spare" tenders, modified for this
purpose).
- -A full service Scout "Yard" for maintenance and repairs.  Not to be
confused with a Way Station which can construct and do major repairs, or a
scout "Base" which can house & maintain (and build) less specialized
vessels for the other duties of the Scout Service.
- -A goodly number of Scout/Courier type ships to service the off-route
destinations, number based on population and quantity of surrounding
planets and density of other xboat routes, but always guaranteeing one
Scout/Courier per week at each destination (for this reason I feel there
must be jump-2 and jump-3 scout/couriers out there we haven\'t seen
reference to).

A given Xboat will follow this schedule;
Day
001  Delivered to jump point by tender, Jump on command one hour after
incoming xboat arrives or 1800hrs Imp.
002-008 In Jump
008 Arrive destination system, picked up by Tender.  Crew is given a day
off and put on the next outbound x-boat back as crew.
009 Arrive at scout station
010-017 Maintenance cycle (assumes 7 days)
018 Begin again from other end.

Any "lag" caused by late jumps are absorbed in the maintanence cycle.
being a random variation, there will be times when maintanence is behind
and generating employee overtime, and times when it is ahead, which is when
\'annual maintanence\' is performed on the ships closest to needing it.

An Xboat station will have two xboats ready to jump for each leg at all
times.  One boat will leave each day under any circumstances, sometimes two
will leave on the same day if an incoming boat arrives late enough.  A boat
will always depart either when a boat comes in, or at a minimum, once per
day.

Boats do not depart on a fixed schedule, except that a boat is guaranteed
to leave by the end of the Imperial business day (1800 hours Standard
Imperial Time) whether an incoming boat has arrived or not.  A Boat will
always leave one hour after the arrival of an incoming boat, even if a boat
has left that day already.

This gets quite complicated on multileg \'hubs\'.  If you have three legs at
a system, two ships are waiting at each leg\'s jumppoint (call the Legs \'A\',
\'B\', and \'C\').  A boat arrives from leg \'A\', prompting the other two legs
(\'B\' and \'C\') to each send off a boat.  While tenders scramble to deliver
two more xboats, a boat arrives from \'B\' leg, prompting the departure of
\'A\' and \'C\' Boats.  Now \'C\' has no boats left.  It is quite possible that,
within a few hours, another boat will arrive from either \'A\' or \'B\' leaving
\'C\' with no boats to respond.

To make life even more complicated, there are places along the x-boat route
where there is one destination (for ex.) 2 parsecs down the line and one
destination 4 parsecs away along the same line.  This would require one
more "set" of boats to service both legs, after all you wouldn\'t expect
data from Roup (Spinward Marches 2007) to be required to stop at Feri (SM
2005) en route to Boughene (SM 1904) right?

The same boat that takes your stuff to your neighbor becomes "their" boat
for the return leg.  In this way we can count from the date that a boat
becomes "ready" for another leg rather than the round-trip time, and come
up with an estimate of the minimum number of xboats we need.

Since *one xboat per day* (more or less) arrives and departs from *every*
xboat station, and one travel cycle is 18 days, each leg of the xboat route
needs *18* X-Boats plus spares for refit/extraordinary
maintanence/replacement of worn out equipment.  This is a huge expense, but
its worth it, and supported by Canon which brings news from the Core to the
Spinward marches according to this route\'s fastest j-4 speed (with a little
reduction for places where there are J-3 rather than J-4 gaps.

[I can see a J-6 network geared for specific destinations, such as sector
capitals and depots, rather than the whole xboat route, being significantly
more efficient at delivering information to those with access to it now
that I think about it.  The message to Norris probably was carried right
across the great rift, for example, and where there is no planet at the J-6
point in regular space, the expense of a deep-space depot would be
reasonable, and probably necessary.]

Going back to the example where there are only two "legs" into a system,
assuming the station \'owns\' 45 boats, and jumps take about 6-8 days there
will be on any given day;

4 poised waiting to jump

12 to 16 actually in jump (I am assuming the station "owns" only the
outbound ones)

2 to 6 arriving and/or or being carried back from jump point

12 to 16 in routine maintenance cycle

4 to 5 "downchecked" for repairs (assuming 10% failure rate).

The rest (from 11 to 0) are spares.  With the above numbers and a worst
case scenario, its actually possible to be two boats \'short\', that\'s when
the technician overtime gets piled on and maintenance shortcuts are
implemented.  On average there should be 5 boats surplus.  In practice, I
would expect Scout Techs to turn around boats on maintenance faster than 7
days, but a good Station Chief will not admit to this too often or will
find her/himself short a few boats next quarter.

One way to bring costs and time down is to have the xboat station orbit the
primary at or outside the jump point.  There is no real reason a station
has to even be anywhere near the mainworld of a system, except for crew
recreation.  This is especially helpful, if not critical, in systems where
the star is large enough to be the 100 diameter limiter - where the jump
point can be *days* of travel from the mainworld.

In fact, with the station at jump point, the X-boats could be tube launched
from the station instead of being dropped off by a tender.  They\'d still
need pickup, of course, but getting them "100 diameters" from the station
(or outside the station\'s equivalent gravity well, if you prefer) would be
trivial, and the ships could be left ready but unmanned until actual
departure time (rather than, as I imagined, sitting in empty space doing
nothing for a few hours or a day or two, or being carried around by a
tender).

Also note that you can have the xboat for one leg substitute for another
leg\'s xboat at any time.  Their positions are not relevant, only the fact
that they are outside the jump limit.

I seem to recall that Xboats *do* carry a small amount of cargo.  Probably
mostly legal documents or somesuch.  These occasional special items make
good adventure hooks ("They paid xboat cargo rates for this?", "Yeah, they
even got the stationmaster to hold jump for a full twenty minutes!")

You\'d have a tender hanging around to pick up the drop tanks.

Without (as much) tankage the ships would have more space for more computer
storage and bigger drives, but depending on your view of the technlogy, you
could just have a "hose" from the tender feed the xboat fuel just before
jump, or even just feed it energy for the "capacitors".  Of course, this is
all only applicable if you accept \'drop tanks\' as possible.

is 1400 tons.  Further suppose that food and such, along with spare parts
and so on, require another 50 tons of cargo per week.  Would not a tanker,
plus one normal freighter handle the needs of the space station in deep
space?  Now, add in a few "scout ships" with the ability to jump in, get
the mail, and jump back to nearby planetary systems, and you have your
mail route taken care of.  Essentially, the nearby worlds may not get
their mail as rapidly as they may have had the Emperor situated the xboat
site around a planet, but then again, if the emperor sites his X boat
routes with deep space sites, maybe there are those worlds where they are
getting their date *months* not just weeks, but *months* ahead of time.
If there are 4 "c" like routes between the emperor and the end of the
line, each taking normally 3 jumps to manage, but  a deep space station
cuts it down to two such jumps, then at the end of the line, the time
saved is 1 month total.

  Ok, I have been talking about the concepts of a deep space X-boat route.
WHat I haven\'t mentioned yet, is the possibility of "vulnerability".  If
an enemy of any kind appears, or by some mysterious accident the fuel at a
deep space location is destroyed - ships that jump to a fuelless location
will be lost.

  So how do we protect the deep space station?  How do we keep it from
turning into a major vulnerable situation?  Hmmm, how about a mobile
station?  Maybe a "lab" ship could be converted into a mobile x-boat
station...  Hmmmm

 Your listing was a good one, and I intend to keep it in my mailbox marked
Traveller.  However, I would like to ask one question...

1) the size of a bedroom in a house is what, 10 feet by 12 feet by maybe 8
feet?  This works out to roughly 960 cubic feet. With roughly 35 cubic
feet to a cubic meter, we are looking at 27 cubic meters.  Ironically
enough, this is exactly equal to the volume of 2 Displacement tons in
Traveller.  The remaing 2 Dtons is going to be used for such things as
common area\'s along with corridor space.  Now, if you take a corridor, and
it is 8\'x 5\'x 24.5\' we wind up being able to have two adjacent suits on
both sides of the corridor.  This leaves us with 6 Dtons to use as common
area.

 Based upon what I wrote above, how much "partying" is going to be going
on for maybe 7 passengers on a 200 ton freighter?

  Also, as long as the entertainment tapes are not used as a means for
revenue generation, I suspect that it would not be difficult to obtain
privately owned material that can be part of an overall "library" and
permitted to the passengers for their own use. 

  In all, while those items used to disinfect surfaces etc are good
mentions, if they were anywhere near expensive, Hotels would not be able
to clean their bedrooms for the prices they do.

  In short, a lot of the stuff you listed are viable expenses, and do
belong on the list of "consumables", they still don\'t show how the prices
go overboard to the tune of $4000 american over a period of days roughly 8
days in duration.

That\'s not High Passage.  That price is for crews and passengers.

OK. One HP tank can hold 24 man hours of air on recycle (from PLSS data). Tanks
cost 10 credits to refill.  So that\'s 70 credits/man-week for fresh air.

Food costs in Restaurants running 30% earns the managers some major butt
chewing.  They\'d really prefer around 20%. Somebody quoted good meals at 12
credits. Assuming a good Steward, food costs would be around 20% that\'s about 50
credits per man week.

> Dont forget that this money pays the Stewards wages too

No, it doesn\'t.  Stewards get 500 cr/ Service Skill above 1.

Summary: (Cr1000 per man-week)
Fresh Water:   Cr100 / ton (14000 liters). People use about 20 liters/day
(mostly for baths and toilets). about 140 liters/week, or Cr1 / man-week
Air: Cr70 /man week (in HP containers using recycle)
Food: Cr50 / man week (assuming a full galley and steward)

Total: 131 = 13% of weekly expenses.
Assuming prepared food (airline style) we could quintuple the price of food,
eliminating the need for stewards.  That  comes to Cr250 per man-week. bringing
the total to a third of the estimate.

Maybe there\'s exit visa type paperwork. And shuttles from the surface.  But Low
Passage only has Cr100 overhead / man-week.

So what? You can just start with the obvious places, those where two
jumps-5 can replace 3 jumps-4 and replace each link one at a time.
And all the links that happens to be precisely 4 parsecs long never
do get replaced.

There\'s no real reason why all X-boats have to be the same capacity.
Sure, it\'s a nice, useful feature, but it dosen\'t outweigh the savings
you get from using jump-1 ships on a 1-parsec link. Nor is there much
reason why an X-boat should ever be employed on more than one leg,
going back and forth between the same two stations for all its service
life.

Actually, it should have both goals. Which is why it should consist of
major links going as fast as possible and lesser branches distributing
along the way.

All this _may_ get the expenses up to Cr2000 per jump (I especially
appreciate the 50 assorted imported miniatures)  --  I don\'t think so,
but I don\'t want to argue the point  --  but this is completely out
of proportion when you consider that we\'re talking about life support
for passengers _AND CREW_ of a tramp liner.

You can spend any amount you care on food if you go to extremes like using
Beluga caviar and cigars handrolled by certified virgins, but again you
come up against the same two problems: The cost is the same for crew and
for passengers and the cost is the same for 9 days consumption and for
14 days consumption. It\'s silly enough to postulate that passengers on a
tramp liner, even High passengers, would get that kind of treatment, but
it gets beyond silly to imagine that the crew of same would get 25
complimentary imported miniatures per week.
 
Let me put it this way: Say you are the captain of a Free Trader and your
crew is serving on a share of profit basis. You hold a Ship\'s Meeting and
unanimous decide to cut back on the the pickled tree-rat tounges and the
skymelon brandy and stick to basic food. Eschewing fancy long-term-fresh
food you all agree to rough it, so you install a deep freezer and buy
frozen and canned food. Any passengers who apply are informed beforehand
of the food situation and if they don\'t like it they don\'t have to travel
with you. (I hope you agree with me that a Referee ought to have the option
of letting some of his ship captains run things that way).

According to the rules Cr400 per month buys you average food. That\'s Cr200
per forthnight. Now, given all this, how much does everything ELSE cost?

   Agreed.  Actually in TNE this is not a problem, since the ship\'s internal
structure is rated according to the number of Gs it can take.  Exceed that
and well...

   A lot of these G tests are merely reflections of how many positive or
negative Gs some one can take *in a straight line*.  Add lots of lateral
motion (like you would have in a dogfight) and the number of Gs you can take
drops significantly.

But all you need is the travel time from jump limit to surface and back
again if you are in a system without a fuel station at the limit and a
lot less in systems with such stations. That\'s less than 24 hours in
almost all cases if you avoid systems that require wilderness
refuelling.

>and also gets pretty tiring for the crew very quickly.

What, with 7-8 days out of every 9 spent in jump? They are a lot more likely
to get bored out of their skulls than tired out.

>Note also that you need a *lot* of ships to maintain something competetive
>with the x-boat network

You\'d need one courier per link, though it\'s more likely that you\'d spring
two per.

>(let alone the secret jump-6 network);

Something competitive with the secret jump-6 network would be a duplicate
of it, except that you would use 400 T couriers which ship for ship would
be a lot cheaper than the 2000 T ships of the secret network.

>saving those
>1-3 days of refuelling time makes a big difference in travel time for news.

Right, which is why you have a courier standing by in the next system.
When you arrive you transfer the news to it. It jumps in a matter of
minutes and you refuel and is ready to jump back again. This system will
give you a weekly update through in the shortest possible time and will
do for most messages. For those rare situations when you really need to
get a message through so fast that even hours count, you have secret
prepositioned deep space fuel depots spaced exactly six parsecs apart.
That will allow you to refuel in hours (This may not work if you have
rules about minimum times to service the jump drive, but AFAIK there are
no official rules about this).

If this is an invariant cost it should be included in the general

Average food costs Cr400 per month. Cr800 per forthnight would be 4 times
that. I suppose you can argue that food that can keep fresh and palatable
for 14 days are more expensive than food that you buy at the supermarket
every day, but a factor 4? Not even by TL 8 food preservation techniques
and I would say certainly not by those of higher TLs.

What happens if the crew and passenger use double occupancy? Does the
per-100 T life support cost double too?

>Thus, we have 1050 cr life support + 819 Cr food = 1869 Cr for two 
>weeks ... pretty close to the summary value of Cr 2000.

But passengers don\'t spend 14 days aboard a ship. They only spend 9 days
on the average. So if life support costs reflect supplies consumed, 
passengers ought to be about 30% cheaper than crewmembers. And for a
ship with a decent number of passengers that can run into significant
savings.

The shelf life of fresh food at TL 8 is often almost a month; for frozen
and canned food it can be much longer, and if you choose your ingredients
and meals carefully only an epicure would be able to tell the difference.
Goodness knows just how long fresh food will be able to keep at TLs 9 and
above. It\'s certainly not going to be less than today.

And what if the captain ewants to run with the filters until they were
almost used up but carry several sets of spares? Shouldn\'t the rules
allow for that? Shouldn\'t they allow PCs to run whatever risks they chose?

I way to save the rediculously high "lifesupport" costs in Traveller is
stating that this cost include an mandatory insurance for the
passenger/crew. If he gets sick, hurt, etc and the person or relatives try
suing the ass off the shipowner the insurance cover it (or parts of it).
The relatively low price for LowPssg life support covers only funeral
expenses and whatnot when the unlucky customer buys it.

OK?

Wrong.  *Every* crewman\'s salary comes from revenue generated by the
ship... including paying passengers.

As for the difference between Middle and High Passage prices, you need look
no further than the difference between 1st and 2nd/3rd class on today\'s
airlines.  The last time I checked, the difference was between +200% and
+500%!

High Passage is a status symbol, just like 1st class is today.  You do not
necessarily get anything "substantial" over those lower paying passengers,
except the recognition that you\'ve got money to burn.  If you want people
to think you\'re rich/famous/powerful/influencal/etc. by travelling 1st
class, it costs MONEY.

express boat lines.  I used the routes from MTJ #1 for the Marches and 
most of Deneb sector, TD #2 for Atsah subsector (Deneb-H), TD #3 for 
Corridor, and _Vilani and Vargr_ for Vland.

The assumption was made that nodes on the route could be bypassed if there
was a world farther down the route that was still in jump-4 range.  (That
is, the Mora-Vland message can skip intermediate worlds on the route as
long as it always moves at jump-4 or less, and always between two worlds
on an xboat route.)

Mora to Vland (29 weeks):
  Mora to Vincennes, Deneb:             4 weeks
  Vincennes to Deneb:                   3 weeks
  Deneb to Erlu, Corridor:              5 weeks 
  Erlu to Antiquity                     2 weeks

  Depot to Lemish                       1 week
  Lemish to Vland                      11 weeks

The message passes through a number of important worlds en route, and 
I\'ve used those to make this list more manageable; notable are Deneb
and Depot.  Kaasu (Corridor 1209, sector capital) is out of the way.
Remember that this is at xboat speeds; a trader will take about twice
as long on this route at jump-4.

I\'d have to drag out my map to look, but the distance traveled from
Mora to Vland on the route is something slightly over 100 parsecs.
At 29 weeks, that\'s an average speed of jump-3.5.  At 39, that\'s a
speed of about jump-2.6.

I believe the relevant sources claimed the fastest transfer on record
was seven minutes.  I also seem to recall that xboats were scheduled
to leave roughly once every four hours, but I could be wrong.

To get a good feel for the flow of the official xboat routes, you 
have to look at sector scale or wider.  The most obviously planned
GDW route is the Solomani Rim, where a trunk from Core runs to a hub
around Dingir, with cross connects running to rimward and spinward
across the sector and, as I recall, way stations in reasonable places.
The DGP-designed routes (Deneb, Corridor, Vland) seem to flow fairly
well, although they tended to mess up way station locations royally.

If the X-boats are maneuverless, then the drop tanks would have very
little velocity, only that from their release.  As mentioned on other
posts, the tenders that go and pick up x-boats, refuel etc, would likely
pick up any drop tanks encountered.  Particularly if they were
positioning an x-boat at a jump point...

I don\'t think Europa\'s atmosphere contributes to its stability particularly;
I would suspect (without doing any research) that the atmosphere is being
stripped away and replaced by newly-sublimated ice (which is evidence of 
Leonards point, I suppose, but the timescales are really really really long.)

The 2000cr  is a full fare rate and there would be discount rates available in

People in business to make money are obviously going to charge more than it

Yes but this system could still be used for a swarm of planetesimals.
(hmmm are 300+ mountain sized rocks called a swarm?)
IIRC the leading Trojan group of Jupiter has 315 documented members,
admittedly much small than a STAR ???? whatever belt but it might still
make for an interesting game session.

I have to admit I\'m not clear on how the orbital mechanics work,

As I said, I assumed that the +75% cost for x2 duration reflected only the

If you buy Type IV life support then you do not need to buy oxygen - you 
have all the compressors and regenerable recycling equipment.  If you have 
type III life support then you have not installed those compressors and you 
need to spend money on buying oxygen filters, absorbents etc each trip.


At the end of the day, if you think that life suppport should be less, then 
make it less in your games.  I was pointing out that the cost of pre-packed 
meals in FFS was not completely unreasonable and that the life support 
consumables were of similar value to the cargo space they freed-up ... 
meaning that Cr 2000 per jump is consistent (from my point of view) with a 
more detailed analysis.  Cr 2,000 is just a way of making the bookkeeping 
easy.  Imagine the alternative:

[Ref rolls dice]
This is an Ag world so food is only 1 cr per meal for re-supply.
The "compressors-R-us" franchise will refill you oxygen for only Cr 200 
using local air.
CO2 filters are hard to come by - they have to be imported - so cost Cr 500 
per person.  You have to pay as you\'ll die without them.
[spends 5 mins with a calculator], that\'s a total of 571 Cr per person


[next world]
This is an As worlds, everything is imported.
blah, blah loadsamoney

.. and so on as they encounter tainted worlds, barren worlds with no food, 
worlds where the local food in inedible for humans.

IMTU I intend to claim that type IV life support is installed, let the 
captain determine how many meals (at 1.5 litres each) are carried and let 
the steward PC handle re-stocking, buying local produce, tracking inventory 
and so on.  If they get bored of bookkeeping I shall say "standard life 
support cost is <random figure> per person per week."

I would say that Mars is "trace" - it has an atmosphere with measurable
effects, but there\'s no way to breath it without a pressure suit. The
moon (and Europa) are vacuum - their "atmospheres" are matters of scientific
curiosity rather than having any practical effects.

I suppose you could, but consider the "political" ramifications. Someone
earlier on mentioned the commercial benefits and prestige that a world
receives as an x-boat stop. If you change the routes, you\'d get a lot of
political pressure from the planets that would lose out.

I\'m not sure I agree with this. I think you would save significantly
more in simplified logistics, starship purchase volume discounts,
standardized/interchangable parts and simplified operating procedures.

Since rapid turnaround is of primary importance, I don\'t think you\'d see
the same x-boat on the same leg for its entire service life. Given the
slight variability of jump duration, and periodic maintenance/equipment
failures, I can\'t see the x-boat system being efficient enough unless
each x-boat is fully interchangeable with every other one. That way, you
can maintain a "pool" of x-boats ready to be used where needed as
needed.

I feel that if the passengers are getting exotic foods then to prevent

Yep the GM can charge any price he feels like (via NPCs) however to keep
things
simple the 2000 cr a jump is there to cover most eventualities.  If you have
a passenger whose stateroom needs a refit so they can breath amonia or some
other strange atmosphere the fee covers that.

 It could be 250 of weekly expenses actual cost price, however if you are
purchasing
these supplies from service providers at starports they may have some form of
monopoly.  Perhaps they charge a set fee for everything, even if you do not
need
half of the things.  There could be export duties and certification fees
involved along
with the resellers mark up which on average pushes the bill to approx 2000cr.

 Someone has to pay the capital costs of each starport being constructed
and it 
would not be covered by the 100cr berthing fees.

Wrong.  *Every* crewman\'s salary comes from revenue generated by the
ship... including paying passengers.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Life support isn\'t a revenue, it\'s an expense. The Steward\'s salary is one expense (2000Cr/month d.o.e.), life support is another, annual maintenance, bank payment, etc - all in the "expenses" column.

The "Revenue" column is where you find the money the passengers pay in...of the 10000Cr a High Passenger pays, 2000Cr goes to life support, 125Cr goes to the Steward (one-sixtienth of a Steward\'s salary, as that\'s how many High Passengers he can service per month) and the rest (7875Cr) goes towards other expenses and the ship\'s profit margin. Life Support and Steward\'s Salary are clearly distinguished from each other as separate line items - while it is true that part of what the High Passenger pays out pays the Steward, it\'s impossible for part of the life support expense to be Steward\'s Salary - unless, again, your Steward has been cooking the books...

One thing you have to keep in mind here is, as always, economics. As Marc Miller himself stated at the beginning of this thread, Xboat routes typically run between fairly important worlds.

Bypassing almost any world that\'s been on the Xboat network for centuries will have severe economic consequences for that world.

Rerouting the network could dramatically alter the economic situation in a local region, as speculators begin to buy businesses and real estate on the new node planets, while stock exchange panic will be the result on the old nodes.

The result will be economic collapse, as the old worlds will be drained of capital with ensuing unemployment, depression etc. The new worlds will experience skyrocketing exchange rates, stock rates and property values without the industrial or technological base to support it. Here, the result will be an overheated economy which could collapse in as short time as five to ten years.

So, noone would win. Worlds would know this in advance and would massively protest against rerouting. If enough worlds were affected, you might actually experience a local uprising.

From an economic viewpoint, rerouting the Xboat network wouldn\'t be a good idea, IMHO, IMTU, etc.

<cut of analysis about the number of people who would have known that Norris cheated>

I couldn\'t agree more with Hans with regards to megacorporations having their own
high-speed courier routes as well. They certainly have IMTU.

Reason will then have it, at Hans writes, that at least several hundred people in the Domain of Deneb knows that Norris cheated. Why didn\'t they tell?

Upon first receiving these news about Strephon\'s assassination, any high-power politician (that being noble, naval or corporate) will recognize the need to keep this information secret.

Anyone who knows this is in a very powerful position - telling will reduce that power. So we can pretty much assume that if everyone acts reasonably rational (i know that\'s a big \'if\'), the information will stay secret.

When Norris then announces his elevation to archduke, a quick analysis will show that going public with the fact that it could be a fraud would only destabilize the domain, as contenders to the position would come forward. A mini civil war might even take place.

Also, there\'s the fact that noone with the advance knowledge can be certain that the appointment to archduke isn\'t real. They can only suspect that very much.

Thus, among those who know in advance, it\'s in noones interest to publicize the secret - not even the Duchess Delphine, who is described as somewhat opposed to Norris\' politics, but a very pragmatic leader.

DEXTERITY
Tester holds a 12" ruler a few inches above subject\'s hand. Drop the ruler
three times in between the subject\'s fingers for the subject to catch.
Record the result each time, then ignore the highest and lowest number for
the subject\'s Dexterity.  Subtract this number from 15.  The result is the
subjects DEX.

 Is it just me or are all the TL\'s missing from the vehicles listed in
"Emperors Vehicles" ???And if the are the does anyone have the official or
even non-official TL\'s for the vehicles? I mean I can guess that a Grav Tank

I think it probably used TL 13 munitions because 13 = 1 + 3 = 4 which
is, as we all know, highly significant.

So do you think that they are sickly because of systemic opportunistic
infections caused by their cannibalistic diets ?

Is this the one that they advertise on TV as the Psychic Friends Network
(which despite its name is _not_ a Quaker organization) ?  If yes does
this prove that Yaskodrays network is up and running on contemporary
Earth ?

Did this point generation sytem use hexadecimal numbering and math ?

> What about the half-dice?

I am glad you asked because this gives me a chance to explain why
starship life support costs are so high.  In the Third Imperium it is
traditional (que Fiddler on the Roof background Music) for people
travelling on spaceships to randomly determine their diet using special
6 sided dice numbered 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3.  These dice are manufactured by
Sharusid (under their technology patent) to rigourous standards.  They
cost Cr 1 each and each die may be used only once.  Rolling to see what
fork should be used, rolling to see if you will have the groat or the
recycled low passenger who did not make it last trip, rolling to see if
you will have the white wine or the red, etc. are required.  Naturally
those who travel on starhips are symbolically unclean for several days
after the transit and have to continue using the dice.  Thus Imperial
law requires that each passenger and crew person be provided with 1500
of these nonreusable dice at each jump (at Cr 1 each = Cr1500 in life
support expenses).

The answer given for this question (9^9^9=1.962271x10^77) may not actually
be correct.  Since no base system was specified, and if we reasonably
restrict ourselves to accepted base systems currently in use, then the
correct answer is F^F^F (hex) =4.173816x10^264.

  Thanks for pointing out that particular fact <grin>.  As I suspect you
can tell, I tend to think more from the familiar pathway of CT, but point
is well taken.  After noting that the HG rules mandate a required
Powerplant to match the jump drive level, it made me wonder what the Jump-6
boat would look like.  The smallest I could get it to be was a 200 ton
combo, ie Body was 100 Dtons while the jump tank held 100 tons fuel.  I
kept it cannon with the computer taking an ungodly amount of space.  I will
post the varient using my house rule that Computers only take 1 ton
regardless of type (so as to keep with the fact that computers seem to be
getting more complex and better able without getting bigger).
  Then, once I get over my "phobia" with the FF&S2 rules, I will try to
create a similar ship for use with the newer incarnation...

How much *does* that equipment cost (per dt), anyway?  I don\'t want to

And the big one...even if you suspect it greatly, no one has _any_ proof
to the contrary. Norris could well have gotten a private advance notice
months ago from Strephon: 

"Norris, 

Old boy, get yourself ready for more work and a fancier uniform.
I\'m going to appoint you Archduke next XXX day. 

Yrs Strephon"

There\'s no reason that anyone would have seen this as out of the
ordinary, other than it was a strictly eyes-only message for Norris from
Strephon.

So despite anyones suspicion that Norris elevated himself, without proof,
imposible to get proof, at that, a rational person isn\'t going to make
accusations against the ruling Archduke, particularly in times of
war...lesse now...is that sedition, or treason? Or both?

It is probable that megacorporations adopted an unofficial x-boat sytem
as well in order to move company directives etc. at high speed to branch
operations. The system wouldn\'t have been so elaborate, but IMO equally
as efficient.

Yes. And as I read it, if a jump-1 was necessary to get an urgent
message to a system not on the x-boat route, a scout courier would be
despatched ASAP to facilitate (Supp 9, pg 11, line 4). Remember that the
x-boat system and courier services were both field operations under the
general control of the Communications branch and indirectly the
operations branch of the Imperial scouts. The x-boat only required 1
crew (but had 2 staterooms to be able to carry a VIP if necessary), and
IMO that crew person would have been highly screened and tested to make
sure he was absolutely and inalterably loyal to the head of state,
government of the day, and the esprit de corp of the scout organization,
and would be trusted to deliver, un-opened, VI messages (Oh, the hooks
of counter-espionage).

supp 7, pg 8 says \'relays messages to the station on arrival, and then
waits to be picked up by the tender, to be refuelled and sent on its
way  with a new load of messages\' (which are received, encoded and
transmitted to the tender by the (mainworld) station for further
transfer to the appropriate x-boat or scout courier as necessary.)

Yep. I agree again. With their probable monetary and political clout, I
don\'t see that it would have been too hard to supply some of the needed
capital to produce the x-boats in whatever configuration, in exchange
for the ability to be able to use the scout tender facilities for
dispatch and retrieval.  Tender como specialist "Captain, we have a MX
off starboard fully serviced. It is a SuSag boat and we do have an
urgent message for ............ Should I contact them to see if we can
use it, and if they have any data that is going to the same place."

   In Traveller terms probably somewhere between trace and very thin.  The
Traveller definition is that if you could breathe the air with a compressor,
its very thin.  I don\'t know that any man-portable device could make the air
breathable on Mars, so I would say \'Trace\' for that reason.

   The game sidesteps the issue by having a terraforming project underway
that makes Mars\' atmosphere solidly very thin, approaching thin (I recall
some technician in a TNS item talking about hoping to see a genuine
thunderstorm on Mars during her lifetime).

>The moon (and Europa) are vacuum - their "atmospheres" are matters of 
>scientific curiosity rather than having any practical effects.

   In Traveller terms, the Moon (Luna) is a true vacuum "world".  As for
Europa (which I\'m recalling also had oxygen in its "air" due to photo
disassociation of water molecules) would probably be counted as \'Trace\', as
would Io\'s atmosphere.  It\'s a tough call really, since I don\'t even think
World Builder\'s Handbook put a lower limit on what should be labelled
\'Trace\' (I am prepared to be wrong since I don\'t have it sitting in front of
me at the moment).  In game terms \'Trace\' versus \'Vacuum\' really doesn\'t
have any effects good or bad either way, so you could flip a coin to decide
and still be OK.

As modern day goes, I seem to recall that insurance is strictly a passenger
option, not a carrier option - meaning that the passenger must pay the
costs if he desires to be covered.  It also doesn\'t explain why the crew
members must also pay for the same "benefits".  But your response means you

This would only indicate precognition.

For mind reading:  have a several different people look at a playing card and
concentrate on the card.  The number or correct guesses would correlate to
telepathy / read surface thoughts.

For teleportation:  have someone shout "Jump!"  If they don\'t immediately move
fast in some direction, they don\'t have that discipline.

  As idle speculation, suppose the port authorities and Imperial
authorities mandate that starship arrivals and departures are included
with the daily information packets that are to be sent via X-boat routes.
Said information is to be forwarded to maybe a Scout base as a means for
collecting the data, and refining it.  Anomalies are to be sent further
down the line to Naval Intelligence and Law enforcement officials.  Really
important stuff is to be sent to the capital of the sector, or even to the
Emperor himself...
  In this manner, all that is needed for the information flow is:

Departures at a world...

Location:
Departure date:
Destination:
Ship name:
Ship registry ID:


Arrivals at a world...

Location:
Arrival date:
Ship name:
Ship registry ID:

  Anyone who has a need for that information applies at the office and can
get it as an Archived piece of information presuming of course, that the
information is available.  However, if the data is being sent in secure
data cartidges, then download into data retrieval systems should be
minimal.

  The biggest problem overall is then...  How does one store all this
information, and how long is the data to be preserved before it is purged
so as to make room for other incoming information?  

  In any case, to get back to your original comment.  Suppose Ship A is
leaving port in 3 days.  It has filed a flight plan that it will be
arriving at Planet Destination in 10 days.  You as a shipper, might send
mail via normal mail packet, to your destination now, indicating that Ship
A is scheduled to arrive in 10 days, please notify if said ship does not
arrive within 1 day of schedule.  At Planet Destination, they wait for the
ship to arrive.  It doesn\'t show.  They send mail complaining it did not
show.  You get either confirmation that it did not arrive on time, within
7 days of the expected arrival... 
  In the mean time...
  Ship A absconded with the cargo, and is in the process of dodging the
bank payments.  It jumped to Planet Other.  Before the Jump, the crew
memebers jimmied the transponder, and rigged up false identity documents.
They jump in system, and identify themselves as the fake ship.  The data
of their ship\'s ID is fed into the "net" and sent down the line.  However
<grin>, there are no planets within range of planet Other, with
information regarding the "fake" Id.  Thus, we have an arrival without a
departure co-tag.  Consequently, the computer picks it out as an anomaly,
and the information is sent down the line.  Eventually, this information
is sent via X-boat route, via the "paper" trail left by the ship, and a
"plot" is made as to the general heading... and those planets are warned
to be on the lookout for ships that match the description of...

  Now, to be really nasty as a GM?  Require that all flight plans be filed
1 day prior to actual jumps, or said ship will not be allowed to lift from
the hiport/lowport.  Information is sent in advance to the destination.
The destination port then places that ship\'s ID in the "expected arrival
list".  Ships that arrive in port without being on the "expected arrival
list" are automatically suspect, and intensely scrutinized...

  As you can see, requiring flight plans in advance as part of the
"normal" routine of civilized space, can make things difficult for
adventurers further down the line.  Every time a PC captain wants to
arrive at a planet without having filed a flight plan, he runs the risk of
being very carefully looked over by the authorities.  Sooner or later,
some X-boat will arrive ahead of him with HOLD orders, and his goose will
be cooked.

  And lest people say "but the ship doesn\'t have to land at port, it can
refuel at a gas Giant", let me remind you that it isn\'t difficult to have
a patrol near a gas Giant along with orders to automatically note arriving
ships, take down their Transponder ID, and check it against the
"authorized arrival" list. <Grin>.

Not quite true, in my opinion, though you may have better information than
I do.  Today, the differences between first and coach classes are pretty
minor, if you look only at air travel.  Given the relatively cheap price of
air travel, it dies a great deal of people movement, and thus other
transportation systems have had their total passenger range crimped down
tremendously.  In Traveller, starships take over what most of us would
consider the roles of ships, trains, and planes, and thus there is easily a
lot of room for different classes.

Take a look at the luxury portrayed in Titanic, for a better example.  I
was recently looking at the luxury levels in the QE2, and the levels are
quite close together, since people do not cruise on that vessel for a
simple, cheap Atlantic crossing nowadays, so it does not even have an
equivalent of steerage/third class passage.  Back just sixty years, there
was a world of difference between steerage and first class, in meals,
services, space per passenger, and so on.  Having your own private
promenade deck, which six cabins on the QE2 do, is quite a luxury.  These
promenades are, if my sources are accurate, about half the size of the kind
that would have been on a top flight vessel of sixty years ago.
Further, the ratio of crew to passengers is much, much higher in the higher
classes, because higher class tickets involve much more running about.
This is something that is not true today, because first class tickets and
coach are only being bought for flights that may hit 14 hours, and usually
are 2-6.  In the present day, there just is not that much difference,
because how much more trouble can someone be when they are not permitted to
move around much, and they will be off the plane in three hours.  When you
have to put up with them for 9 days, they can be a problem.

I do not argue that the primary benefit of first class may well be the
ability to flash that expensive ticket, but I think the secondary benefits
can loom quite large given the amount of time people stay on board.  I
have, though, scarfed the idea, and raises the price on my own first class
passengers.

On my ships, the default ceiling height is 2.4 meters, with a 0.6 meter
deck space.  (Usually, the 0.6 meter \'tween deck space becomes a bulkhead a
few cm. thick, and an access way perhaps 1.1 meters high every other deck,
but other arrangements are possible.)

IMTU, I am thinking of the following sizes:

High - the lap of luxury, including many dedicated human/robot servitors,
as well as private promenades and suites, and all sorts of other goodies.
This is how nobles and TAS members travel, and it is far outside the
experience of normal people.

Luxury - Luxurious travel, which involves the same amenities as Middle
travel, but gives a single occupancy large double room.


Middle - Comfortable travel, which involves either large double rooms or
small single rooms.

Low - Acceptable travel, usually implemented as double occupancy small
staterooms.  Military officers expect this.  Typical civilian officers and
enlisted expect this as well.

Steerage - Not very luxurious travel, usually involving four to a small
stateroom in bunks, but with reasonable common areas.  Military enlisted
travel this way.

I am VERY open to argument on these sizes, as they are rather off the cuff.

Space is in m^3
Crew - the number of passengers per crew member
SR - stateroom space per person
CA - common area space per person
WS - Waste space per person
Cargo - cargo allotment
Total - space used on board for the vessel as a whole for a single
passenger of this class

Class		Cost	Crew	SR		CA		WS		CR		Total
Cargo		20		-		-		-		-
Frozen:	50		50		1.9		-		-		0.1		2
Steerage:	250		50		3.5		4.5		1		1		10
Low:		500		25		7		9		2		2		20
Middle:	1KCr	10		14		18		4		4		40
Luxury	2KCr	10		28		36		8		8		80
High:		10KCr	5		56		72		16		16		160

Note 1: crew salaries are based on the assumption that the average starship
crew member makes between 10KCr and 30KCr, as the very wealthy usually did
not become that way by serving drinks on a starship, thus even luxury class
adds only 15KCr/25 trips, or ~60Cr/trip.

Note 2: The profit margin on virtually all passenger traffic is roughly
20%, not counting life support, crew costs, and so on, above the use of the
space as pure cargo.  This covers the risk of having to pay a steward and
having to commit to a schedule.

Note 3: High passage tickets are more profitable, in that they cost roughly
3200 to the ship for lost cargo space, plus another few hundred for
salaries, and perhaps another few hundred for meals, yet bring in 10KCr.
This is compensated for by the difficulty of filling those high passage
staterooms.

Note 4: I have vastly more common area than the usual traveller rules
indicate.  This represents my take on the somewhat more communal feel of
the 3I.

Example: Lord Froederich is moving from one world to another.  He is
bringing his wife, his two children, their two servants, and their
nursemaid.  While the servants are technically Low tickets, the space they
occupy is likely part of Froederich\'s suite.  Thus, they pay 41,500Cr for
their tickets.  They occupy a 245 cubic meter (~81 m^2, or 735 square foot)
space, and have access to a 288 M^3 common area, thus if there are a dozen
such suites, they have more than enough room for a ballroom and observation
deck.  The servants have access to 13.5 m^3 of common space, shared with
other low tickets.

    Last night my players and I squeezed in an extra session and durring on of
the breaks one of my two Lady Players, who\'s hard science background is
functionally nil.  Made the connection between force and moving things and then
asked if a big enough "BANG" could make the Earth shift in it\'s orbit, or the
Moon for that matter.  Obvious, OC it would if the "BANG" overcomes the
planetary inertia.  <SIGH> Then she asked us how MUCH of a "BANG" would be
required to do it.

    Not having figures handy at that moment, and I\'m not at all certain how an
atmosphere would effect this, I begged off answering until the next session.
But this obviously has implications to Traveller, and given the joy so many on
this list take in blowing things up already... <GRIN> I thought I\'d pass the
question along and see how the experts would answer it!

    Perhaps, but given their propensity to, err... Crash, spectacularly in a
socitial kind of way.  Not to mention that love of uncontrolled, unhindered,
unchecked technological growth.  Nevermind the strange and downright Kinky

    Not all Solomani are in the Solomani Sphere of influence. ;) They\'re

    'body' => 'Hello Folks,
  Before I undertook to re-organize the X-boat routes, I decided to create
the boat/ships themselves.

  As was already noted, CT mandates that a powerplant equal in value or
better must be on board the ship for it to be jump capable, which rules
out the first Jump-6 100 ton ship example that was sent in.  Since then, I
have revised my "engineering call" for the smallest x-boat ships based
upon the best technology has to offer at the time of design.
Consequently, the following paramters were in effect:

Ton of cargo space allocated for carrying mail:    1
Tons allocated to bridge:                         20
Tons allocated to  stateroom:                      4
Totals for minimum mandated allocation:           25 tons.

Then the next minimum requirement to be met is the Computer.  For those
who use the full Classic rules of Computers takeing up progressively
larger volume, the volumes required would be either 4,5, or 7 tons for
computers rated at 4,5, or 6 (required in order to run Jump 4, jump 5, or
jump 6 programs).  Thus:

Jump 6 minimum requirements are 32 tons
Jump 5 minimum requirements are 30 tons
Jump 4 minimum requirements are 29 tons

This leaves me with the task of designing the ships outright.  Ok, before
I unveil my "designs" via HG rules, I would like to point out one "short
cut" that while legal, was probably not given much thought.  According to
the High Guard rules, the fuel calculations for powerplants is based upon
4 weeks duration.  Thus, a powerplant 4 would require .04 times the ship\'s
volume for fuel that would last 4 weeks.  I chose to cut that down to a
duration of 2 weeks.  Reason?  According to JTAS (don\'t recall what issue
exactly), there was a rule that ships could powerdown and operate at a
level 1 powerplant rating despite the powerplant rating be a 4.  In short,
this ruling pointed out the logical assumptions that fuel consumptions can
be taylored to need.  Thus, a Jump 4 powerplant may be required to power
up at level 4 for an entire week while in Jumpspace, but if the ship is
only cruising at 1 G manuever, it wouldn\'t need the full output of the
level 4 powerplant, just at level 1.  Having said that, I only used half
the volume of fuel suggested by HIGH GUARD.

  Now, on with the analysis.  The Minimum required volume for a jump drive
at Jump 6 is .07 Ship\'s volume.  Power is equal to powerplant of 6 times
.01 (or .06) of the ship\'s volume.  Last but not least.  Fuel required is
equal to Jump times .1 times ship\'s volume plus powerplant value times .01
times volume divided by 2 (for only two weeks operation of fuel).  A
maneuver drive rated at 1G will add an additional .02 times ship\'s volume.
Grand total?  The Jump-6 ship requires that 78% of the ship be allocated
to Jump-6 equipment plus 32 tons for the minimum required statistics.

Using similar math on the other ships, I arrived at the following:

Jump 6 ships:  78%   jump related + 32 tons
Jump 5 ships:  70.5% jump related + 30 tons
Jump 4 ships:  57%   jump related + 29 tons

  As a result, I created a 150 ton jump 6 ship
                           105 ton jump 5 ship
                           100 ton jump 4 ship

Please note that these ships can either be built as 100 ton ships with the
remaining volume required as Drop tank volume, or they can be built as
150, 105, and 100 ton hulls.  I prefer the latter option, because it
permits the x-boats to function without need of the drop tanks, and be
less vulnerable to lack of drop tanks etc.

  I didn\'t bother to give these ships class names, nor did I bother to
upgrade the internals of the Jump 4 X-boat.  As far as I am concerned, one
could easily place another 3 staterooms in there and still have cargo
space of 3 tons for the mail.  Also, this ship could easily be left as it
is, and become a small freighter carrier and be used as a muster out
benefit for the scout service.  Since I detailed the proceedure I used for
creating these class ships, I will leave you, the reader, to design what I
consider a vital intermediary route Jump 3 X-boat.  The reason I think
such a ship would be a viable addition to the Scout/courier system?  Every
Jump Ship 6 that exists, would likely require "feeder" ships that can
reach planets that are exactly 1/2 the distance to a nearby X-boat
depot...

   Hope you enjoy this.  If I can work up the enthusiasm for creating
similar stats for Megatraveller Rules, I will so do.  If I may?  Perhaps
people can create the T4.1 versions of these ships.
  By the way, by including the manuever drives in these ships, the 1000
ton X-boat Tender is no longer a viable option.  Much as I suspect you
would hate me for saying this, but since the original X-boat ships were
illegal by even the rules of Book 2 starships, the X-boat Tenders really
should not exist as a class.

  Just a few thoughts that were prompted by the fellow who made a nice
analysis of the different levels of passage...

  Suppose you have a captain on board a ship.  Further suppose he has to
live on board that ship.  Further speculate that he never lives at a Hotel
or whatnot unless the ship is in Maintenance for two weeks.  Just how much
space is he really going to want versus need for his "living" quarters?
Assume that the average number of jumps said captain makes is 25 per year.
Further assume that each jump is actually 8 days spent on board the ship.
This equates to 200 days staring at a room that is roughly 10 x 12 x 8
(when he\'s not busy elsewhere like the bridge or other parts of the ship)!
How would you arrange that room?  What would you want in it?  How likely
could you survive living in that room for 200 or so days.  Those 200 days
are days he can\'t get away from the ship.  Groundside, he can at least
head out side for his entertainment/socialization needs, but what about
his enforced time inside?
  Just trying to get into the mindset of such a man... I almost suspect
that maybe a Captain\'s cabin on a free tramp would be 1.5 or even 2 times
larger than a normal stateroom...

How would this change for a 20lb barbell (don\'t have a 8lb. one handy).Plus, I would
think that for such a small weight, these times really measure endurance (at least how
fast your muscles react to anerobic activity and lactic acid build up).

So, what makes you think anybody says it to a Solo\'s face?  Behind their
backs and to each other whenever the "jumped up", inbred, psycho Solomani
scum aren\'t around the Vilini probably say that and much worse. Who says
there isn\'t any racism in the Imperium?

Assuming late 20th century North American standards of personal living
space, and how one uses it, are carried forward into the 5Xth century, I
agree.  On the other hand, there\'s no compelling reason why they should.
Personal living space is not intrinsically desireable.  I don\'t have any
problem at all with career ship crews regarding 10x12 foot cabins as normal
and "just right" -- it\'s more than I had growing up most of the time, and
would still suit me fine now.

No, no, no.  That view really isn\'t tenable when examined in the light of
the cold, hard facts.

I\'m right now putting the final daring swirls and curliques of logic onto

planet humans call "Lair"), the chilling truth behind the Santa Claus

nude pictures of the Five Sisters (hubba hubba!), and evidence that
Hitler\'s brain is alive and well and controls both SolSec and SuSAG

My character is the captain in our PBEM game.  She\'s got a study and a large
stateroom to herself.   However, she spends a great deal of time scrubbing
decks and cooking for the crew.  She isn\'t a flight crew type captain, she
just makes sure she\'s got the experts where they\'re needed and makes sure
everyone is well fed. I\'ve been planning on adding a jacuzzi in the stateroom,
but right now she\'s got lots of momentos from her previous ship.  We\'ve got a
nice holodisplay on the bridge, but "officially" that\'s not for entertainment.
She does landfall at most systems to talk with the officials.   But due to her
background, she\'s more comfortable on her own ship (She was in cold sleep for
a thousand years and suffers from severe Temporal Displacement Syndrome).
Jumps make her horny, but that\'s another story :-)

Pretty much ALL legal captains must file flight plans with appropriate
bodies.  Military vessels would file flight plans with appropriate bases
(not necessarilly at every system). Merchants should file flight plans at
starports with Legal codes above Low.  Pirates wouldn\'t file flight plans.

  Actually, I\'m working on a similar situation.  In our game we\'re using subspace
travel and gravity well projectors for maneuver drives.  The problem is that the
"Hyperdrive" is extremely dangerous inside a gravity well, its magnified
tremendously.  Obviously we have to use thrusters in hyperspace... But...

In a nearby system, we got reports that the binary star system had a primary
stellar class M8-V... which obviously can\'t support life.  In our current system
the local scout base says it was a clerical error and its actually an M1-V star.
But we\'ve already gotten two reports that its M8... So... I\'m  thinking, 12 years
ago (4 parsecs, 12 light years) it WAS M1... but for some reason in the last 12
years it decayed to M8.  The locals of said system are kidnapping women... So I\'m
thinking their women have radiation poisoning making them sterile and they need
fresh women for reproduction.  I\'m trying to solve their problem...

If I can  get the other star in the system to collide with the primary at JUST the
right speed, they\'ll merge and form a star with the collective mass of the two.
Approximately a K2 star.  This has a nice comfortable zone... unfortunately, their
planet would become a hot house... Which is fine because I\'d need to use their
planet to carry off the rotational inertia from the two suns...  Now if there\'s a
planet in the appropriate zone, it could be terraformed and voila! fresh new planet
for the population.

So, how do I do it?  Plot a course between the two suns and activate the hyperdrive
and gravity well projector.  If JUST enough of the secondary\'s orbital speed can be
reduced, it will be drawn into the primary.  Then you do the same to the original
planet to carry away the excess rotational inertia.

Or, I could just nuke the planet from orbit until they return the kidnapped
women... I haven\'t decided yet.

Cecil Adams, (a fountain of useful wisdom, BTW) I discover that the most
common phosphor in glow in the dark keyrings and such is calcium sulfide
"activated" (whatever the h#ll that means -- can one of you chem majors
explain for the benefit of those of who last had chemistry in high school) by
bismuth, usually with traces of copper, silver or lead. As previously
explained, light kicks electrons into higher energy orbits, then the electrons
slowly fall into lower energy orbits, releasing photons as they do so. Some
phospors in things like watch faces, Adams goes on to say, are activated by
alpha radiation, ususlly zinc sulphide with one or two ppm of radium. No
mention is made of other compounds, although the implication is that there are
several of varying lethalities, of which calcium sulfide is used because it is
relatively innocuous when incorporated into a plastic skull ring or keychain.

I recall reading something about the US army using instruments that used
tritium as a glow-in-the-dark activator ( I think inthe Bradley IFV manuals
GDW had), but my memory is beginning to fail.

    'body' => 'Hello Seth,
  With regards to your question about the Asteroid Hull...

1) off hand, the price for the hull is cheaper, but the "volume" of the
ship needs to be higher to account for the "waste space" involved.

2) while cheaper for sure hull wise, and believe me, for a 150 ton hull, a
savings of some 17 million is nice, I am not sure the advantages are quite
worth it.  Just for the jump drive alone, increasing a the size of the
planetoid body needs to be 187.5 tons (to account for a 20% wastespace
problem).  Bear in mind that the 187.5 ton ship needs more volume for the
fuel etc above and beyond what was allocated for the 150 ton ship, lets
just pretend that we don\'t need to take into account the increased
requirements for a ship that masses 37.5 tons more.  37.5 x .07 for the
extra Jump 6 engine will result in an added size of 2.625 tons of jump
drive.  This adds 10.5 Mcr to the price tag.  The powerplant then becomes
+2.25 tons larger, and this increases the price of the ship by 6.75 Mcr.
Already, the attempt to shave off 18 Mcr has cost us 17.25 Mcr, not to
mention the fact that the ship needs a larger volume for the fuel and so
forth, so already, we have passed the 18 Mcr we would have saved by going
planetoid.

  Another reason I decided to use wedge in the original design, is the
fact that the design is streamlined.  This will permit the X-boats to land
on a planetary surface regardless of atmosphere or not.  With any luck,
this will permit X-boats in need of repair, the ability to be repaired at
any normal facility.  I postulate, that if these boats are Imperium owned,
and are that valuable to it\'s economic and politcal well being, that these
craft have a high priority repair ticket (ie they can commandere drydock
space at will).

  If we want to get cheaper yet, we could use the dispersed strcture to
knock off 9 million in price.  Better yet, to retain atmospheric
maneuverability, we could use a flattened sphere.  This would knock off 6
million from the price tag.  Using the flattened sphere option, the new
Jump 6 vessel would cost 141.75 Mcr singly, or 113.4 with class discounts.

  If we assume that the Imperium has about 100 xboat routes in a major
sector (just pulling numbers at random folks <Grin>) and each route has an
average of 10 ships per, we are looking at 1000 such ships.  By knocking
the price down from the original 118.2 Mcr to the 113.4, we end up with
approximately 42 x-boats more than we would have had for the same price.

  Good point Seth!

They don\'t say. They just give the limits. But do recall that this is
"flat on your back" type acceleration, so g-suits and "g-straining"
don\'t have a significant effect.

Also remember that we are talking about people in good health. And
given the 18g limit for "muscular control", I\'d have to assume that 
there\'s no major impairment of the ability to control things.

The sentence in the article is "The same source gives 18g\'s as the
level at which movements become too difficult to control and 4 g\'s as a
limit for sustained long-term acceleration." (p.65) Note the use of
*long-term*.

Invalid analogy. If a sub takes on enough water for scuba gear to be
needed, it\'s *dead*. There\'s no way it\'ll get pumped out enough to keep
from going to the bottom. And the depth is such that scuba gear is a
bad idea anyway. 300 feet is extreme depth for scuba, and fairly
shallow for subs.  The gear needed for the depths subs routine operate
at is a lot different. And you *can\'t* just go from "room air" to using
the gear.

Don\'t count on it. They can\'t track it that well. If it goes down in
some out of the way place, the best info control will have about the
landing site will be the pilot\'s message telling them where he intended
to *try* for. There just plain *isn\'t* the sort of global radar
coverage that\'d be needed to spot the landing site in many places. Dig
up a copy of "Shuttle Down" by Lee Correy (G. Harry Stine) for a
description of an unplanned emergency landing.

Well, as I recall, they used volunteers. And the guy who set the 83g
"record" was the the officer *running* the study (Col. Stapp). It was a
rocket sled run.

I recall reading about some of the other tests they ran on the limits
of endurance. The one for high temp had the menn in a room heated to 500
degrees F for an hour. They were naked, and sweated like crazy. The
only ones to suffer any damage were a couple wearing sweatbands. They
got blistering under the band because ther sweat couldn\'t evaporate
fast enough.

Yep. I figure it\'d be used for things like dodging missiles on an
intercept vector. Wait until it\'s "committed", then hit the
afterburners so it\'ll pass astern.

I figure that the K\'kree will have *real* g-tolerance problems because
they don\'t *have* a "flat on the back" position *possible*. So their
heads will *always* be about a meter higher than their bodies. Add in
the problems of body weight on *top* of their lungs, and they\'ll have
real problems.

Actually, it seems that the Space Shuttle uses a gizmo that is probably
related to a catalytic converter to oxidize the various trace

Many pistols use tritium sights, that is little dots of paint that

This brings up one of the points I find most interesting about the US
constitution:

Treason is specifically defined therein, unlike some places (such as the
Imperium), where it is whatever the government says it is.

Maybe. I seen a few captain\'s quarters on seagoing ships, and they didn\'t
strike me as especially spacious. Anything is possible, however.

That\'s why I assigned them the nickname "pig-boats" but it didn\'t catch on.
WWII subs were called such, and the WWI ones were worse.

Decompressing the ship before battle would have detrimental effects on
cargo, incidentals, and personal items on board. It\'s difficult to ensure
everything on board is vacuum-safe.

I don\'t think that the 8 lb. barbell tests that either, because I\'m not at

to get a STR of 8-9 using the 8 lb. weight. Maybe if Endurance was split up

In the TNS entries prior to the FFW there is a passing reference to a
number of traders being overdue, from which I think you can infer that
flight plans are logged somewhere (at least by commercial lines).

Given a culture where gender modesty exists and the crews are mixed, I
would think something like this would be thinkable: 

- - The fresher could be a place where some things are not mentally
  acknowledged, symbols make do where actual physical privacy is
  impossible, not totally unlike what is done some pleces in India. The
  women wash themselves by the men, but do not completely remove their
  saris. The thin cloth doesn\'t hide much, but it is enough to keep mental
  privacy for both sexes. 
- - People "turn off" gender modesty when on duty, and turn it back on when
  dirtside and in bigger ships. Real life example: A woman a friend of
  mine knows has worked posing nude for art classes, one time when she got
  dressed after a class or something like that, a student happened to walk
  into her wardrobe by accident. She quickly covered herself and "asked"
  the student who already had looked away and was getting out of the room
  as quickly as possible to get out. This was one the students who had
  been drawing her in the previous class. One of the better examples I
  know of that modesty can be turned on and off.

A small idea on personal privacy...

- - Some place(s) on the ship could be termed "sanctuaries" of some kind,
  you never enter if you see that the door is closed or something like
  that. This needn\'t be much bigger than your average ship\'s locker,
  though with a window. A scheme like this has been used in present day
  space stations, and the astronauts appreciated the system.

Well, one of my players constantly accuses me of being far too fond of
blowing things up, so I could try to say some words on it.

To start with, I would totally ignore the effects of any atmosphere, with
the energies you would need here, I strongly doubt a typical atmosphere
makes any difference.

The easiest way of doing this kind of calculations is considering
energies:

To change a planet\'s, or moon\'s, orbit you would need to change it\'s
potential "gravitational" energy, for the system Earth-Sun this is:

E = -GmM/r = - (6.7e-11 * 6.0e24 * 2.0e30 / 1.5e11 )J = -5.4e33J

(E is the energy, G is Newton\'s gravitational constant, m is the mass of
Earth, M is the mass of the Sun and r the mean distance between their
centers of mass.)

Thus, to change the orbit of the Earth to be 1% closer to the Sun,
you would need to change the potential energy by:

| D*E |  = | -GmM/r2 - -GmM/r1 | = 5.4e31J

Or 1.35e16 megatons.

To shift the Moon 1% closer to the Earth:

| D*E |  = | -GmM/r2 - -GmM/r1 | = 7.9e26J

Or 2.0e11 megatons.

Hope this helped.

I was on a couple of different war ship and if memory serves, the crew all
had bunks that folded up into a wall recess.  When folded down there were
curtains that could be pulled for privacy and a reading lamp.  You lifted up
the mattress and had storage space underneath for "personal" items.  Most
guys had pictures taped to the wall (inside the recess) inside their private
area.  You can expand this further by having a fold down writing tray with
built in cup holder, bunks that allow you to raise your head and legs/knees
(ala hospitol beds) a wall outlet for your personal electrical devices, fold
down computer terminals for writing letters, traveller stories, etc.  The
recess was about a foot deep and the bunks stuck out about six inches when
folded up.  This is of course at TL 8/9 so we should be able to do tons more
at TL 12.  I think that a personal holo display in each privacy area would
be nice.  Oh yea, they all had small lockers at the end of their bunks and a
hook to hang their sea bags (work clothes went in these with a seperate
compartment for dirty stuff).

The junior officers (company grade, 01-03) shared a small (read that very
small) stateroom.  They shared a small writing desk, but had individual beds
and lockers.  They had storage cabinets over their bunks and drawers
underneath.  This gave them a tremendous amount of personal storage over
the enlisted men.  Having said that, the ships Chief Petty Officers (senior
enlisted, E7-E9) had an identical configuration.

Senior officers (field grade, 04-06) had small individual staterooms and you
can extrapolate from the previous descriptions as how they were probably
configured.  The ship\'s senior enlisted man also got a private stateroom.
You could easily put fold down chairs and a table in the walls like the pull
down bunks.

This leaves us the Captain, he had a large reception room where he could do
some minor entertaining and have informal discussions with the crew.  Most
formal discussions were held in the "war room" very near the bridge.

Now this was what would be available on say 400 dton ships and larger.
The bunks could line both sides of a long corridor or something like that.
A special note on the sizes of the staterooms (this is a swag of course):
double  = 8x8
single    = 8x5

You could draw a possible parallel from a SSBN captain...min patrol time on
these vessels is 60 days, IIRC.  And I am sure he doesn\'t have much room to
spread out  :-)

Look at Core sector - they seem to be everywhere that the Sylean Federation
isn\'t.
They\'re detailed most fully in Long Way Home Part 1, which I don\'t happen to
have anymore.  My general recollection is that they were short (approx 1
meter) bipeds with arms derived from wings.  The ones in Long Way Home weren\'t
particularly bright.  But I don\'t know if thats from their circumstances or a
racial thing.  I think there\'s a website somewhere, but IIRC, if didn\'t have
scads of info.  (The more I think, the more I seem to remember that I had a
problem (delay) with the pages loading).

A more detailed description and Chargen stats would be interesting, especially
given the frequency of their habitations in Core.

I get STR 8 with the 20lb barbell :-)Braggin aside, if I multiply the time held
by the weight differential, I\'d have STR 15 or something (ridiculous IMHO).  I
know its all in fun, but I\'d be interested in getting a more accurate estimate.
Perhaps something like J-Man\'s post in reverse.

BTW:  I get the following UPP with the Gen-Con Test (although I\'m guestimating
strength since I only have the 20lb barbell).

AA7BBA-A
A little generous, but not too far from my off hand estimate of
A969B8-A

Not IMTU ... do you have  a "canon" source for this assumption,  I 
assume that the only compressors are associated with each air lock, and 
these only recover half the air before equalising pressure and opening 
to vacuum.

If you have type IV life support, then you will have the high speed 
compressors required to evacuate the air into high pressure tanks.  My 
reading of FFS makes this distinction quite clear (at last!).

I notice that a lot of the THUDD ships use small staterooms for middle
passengers. I don\'t think this is reasonable; it makes middle passengers
more profitable that high passengers because you can fit twice as many in
and mid passage tickets are more than half the price of high passage. Canon
says high passengers can bump middle passengers, and this is impossible if
their cabins are different. Moreover, even a full stateroom is pretty small
for civilians to stay in for weeks at a time, especially for families.

If you want an 8lb weight get three 1.5 litre plastic soft drink bottles,
fill two up anf half fill the third. Put them all in a plastic carry bag,
and lo! an 8lb weight.

definition, you can buy stuff with Imperial credits that you just cant buy
with US dollars.

For example, imagine we have an Imperial megacredit. Being smart cookies,
we charter a small starship (a type S scout would be perfect), and buy 4
tons of anti-gravity modules at another system and ship it to Earth (lack
of regularily scheduled trade services and all that means we can\'t just
book the space on a freighter).

Now, how much would any Earth government pay for this ? 4 tons of
anti-gravity would let, say, Venezuala, become the dominant space power.

Therefore the Imperial megacredit could be turned into bloody heaps of US
dollars, Rembrandt paintings, the rights to the entire Beatles collection,
or pretty much anything else we wanted.

OK. This shows up the profits to be made on recontact.

Now, imagine that Earth does have a regularily scheduled Makhadurin
merchant service. The stuff we buy off Makhadurin would have to balance the
stuff they bought off us (assumning no-one was willing to write IOUs).

We want to buy a lot of stuff off them. They want to buy relativly less
stuff off us (the DM per TL on the selling price table). Therefore we will
have to cut the prices of the stuff they are vaguely interested in, in
order to earn the hard currency to buy what we really want.

I dont know how low the Earth currency would have to go to balance out our
TL7/8 exports vs TL 12 imports, but I suspect it would be a lot lower than
2 US dollars to one Imperial credit.

yeah what about it? 

i was hopeing that i could just listen in on this one. i like hearing how
landlovers think about how we do the six month cruises.  

Here\'s what its like on a carrier:

enlisted (E1 to E5) are kept in open bay berthings.  bunks are stacked three
high, and in sets of six each.  a total of bunks number around 18 to 60 bunks
per bay.  

senoir enlisted (E6) are alike this as well, but are kept form around 18 to 30
bunks per bay.  

Cheif Petty Officers (E7 to E9) are in berths identicle to that of the Frist
Class Petty Officers, just with nicer bunks (read- a real mattress and not an
inch think matt) and a really kick butt lounge and their own mess decks.

officers are the only ones who actually have staterooms

junior (Ens and Lt,Jg) officers are asigned to 6 per state room, their bunks
are stacked only two high. senior officers (Lts and LCmdrs) are 3 or 4 to a
stateroom, more senoir officers (Department Heads, Execs) are in a single
occupancy stateroom (the Exec has a small office area as part of his
stateroom) and the Captian and Admiral of a ship are given a singel occupancy
state room with an entertaining area (the so-called "In Port" stateroom) and
the captain also has a single occupancy stateroom off the bridge (the "at Sea"
Stateroom) that contains only a bunk, and several changes of clothes and a
private head.  

Smaller Vessels operate much diffrent than this. All enlisted are kept in
simular (yet seperate Berths), officers have smaller staterooms that are
between 6 to 12 per stateroom.  COs and Execs have private staterooms.

For a good look at what the Commanding officers stateroom would look like go
watch "Under Seige" and standard officer stateroomms look to "Navy Seals" and
for the enlisted berths go watch Star Trek the Undiscovered Country (i know...
but it\'s as close as i could think of at a moments notice- and its fairly
close enough for this comparision).

as for how i feel about women on combat ships. dont get me started. they (teh
women on board) have a major double standard. males cant cross through their
berths even in General Quarters, but they can (and do) go through our berths
regularly...  

have you ever steped out of the shower to meet face to face with an entire
gaggle of female squids? its not nice. if a male was to make the kind of
commmets i heard that day... can we say "Tailhook" boys and girls? I know you
can.

now i do beleive in the addage "Equal Rights for Equal Risks"...  but i also
feel that women should have to train on our level, not us training on their
level (watering down our training only gets more people killed).  

I saw people get killed and die when their training was harder and more strict
than most whould handle it.  the way things are going now more people will die
if the training isnt brought up to a decent standard.  haveing women in combat
who can\'t lift a streacher, or carry their own combat loads are a liablity. 

\'nuff said on that one.

a former squid who misses the oceans he has traveled, and all the foriegn
lands he has visisted... but not the bloodshed he has seen.

_or_ we could ask some of the surviving Soviet female tank crewmembers from
WWII, who served in mixed crews, on the Leningrad front anyway (saw an
interesting interview with a couple of them recently -- the toilet
arrangements inside tanks were "use a shell casing and toss it out the
hatch"). Soviets had women fighter pilots in the GPW as well, and I don\' t
think they were in sex-segregated units either. On the other hand, the WWII
Soviets did have sex-segregated infantry units (Frank knows more about this
than I do), and I think MP and engineers. I\'m not sure what they did about
"extracurricular activities," but I can guess...

In one of the Franz Joseph Star Trek books from the late 70s (collector\'s
items now, I think), there is a statement in one of the footnotes to the
effect that Star Fleet regulations abolish sex as a limitation on quarters
assignments without violating Federation standards of decorum. What this says
about Federation standards of decorum is open to interpretation.

Prior to the X-Boat network, the only Imperium-wide
courier and messaging systems were specialized
"internal use only" arrangements, such as naval
or megacorporate couriers. 

General-use systems were the assortment of 
local subsidized mail routes, which might 
be thought of as driving across the USA
_BEFORE_ the interstate highway system:
rough going where some secions are slow
from excessive traffic, while others are
slow because they don\'t get enough traffic
to be worth maintaining properly.

A little thrust can keep the station stationary.  Thus the xboats can
have EXACT coordiates for the station, thus bringing them within minutes

day turn around, maybe even an hour (and thus the same day).
Theoretically, the cheaper xboat allows you to have many, enough for
daily jumps for sure.

There was an interesting passae in one of Brian Daley\'s (sic?) Alacrity
FitzHugh novels discribing a free trader. In essences every available space
on the ship, barring the Drive room and the cockpit was filled with cargo.
Too the extent that the characters were forced to crawl in passage ways that
could normally been walked through. I\'ve often though we give too much ree
space over in Trav. IMTU I\'ve had occation to fill unoccupied state rooms
with cargo, mostly speculative type stuff, wines and other luxury goods.
When I saw a similar show on WWI submarines it looked much the way I
pictured a Free Trader operating, using all the available space for that
"just in case" small item that might be a treasure to some "native".  Of
course I see the subsidized and Corp. ships really looking down on the "poor
slobs" for this.

This is done all the time on Aslan ships for what is called "the shrine
of heroes" which ostensibly has a "religious" sognificance.  On larger
ships they even have seperate passenger and crew shrines.  Allegedly
Aslan will not enter the shrine if someone else is already in it. 
Perhaps they need privacy sometimes to cool off from their harsh
culturally demanded norms.  The shrines may be a stress relief point
that is not actually "religious" in nature at all, except perhaps in
the  "God I need some privacy" sense.

  By the way, I ran the numbers.  Due to minimum jump drive size of 2 Kl,
the jump 4 xboat ended up being 40 Kl.  After all essentials, there\'s still
about 17 Kl of space left for mail.  Cost for a combined ship and module
came in at about 5 Mcr, 4 of which is the module computer.  Here\'s the cool
part, it fits neatly inside a standardized 54 Kl cargo container.

40 Kl... about 3 dtons.  That was based on the minimum jump drive size... 2 Kl.
This is by TNE FFS rules.  I don\'t know if that got changed in T4. I couldn\'t
find any reference to 100 dTon limit of Starships, although I think I saw
something like that in a previous version.

T4 FFS 2 has a minimum size on page 12, " The smallest hull that can safely
enter jump space is 1400 cubic meters." I beleive this was written to
coincide with the CT (High Guard?) minimum of 100 sdt. Of course this all
depends on your version of the Trav. Universe. GDW broke the rules
themselves with the infamous jump torps in Leviathan. I\'m not sure about FFS
1 (TNE), I have it around here somewhere but haven\'t looked at it recently.

I beg to differ, Starships at least had a working design system, EV is not
much more than a collection of pretty pictures.

However if you\'re looking for a good collection of vehicles for T4, check
out Rob Priors website at:

<http://www.interlog.com/~dmci104/GamingClub/Traveller/traveller.html>

Or better yet buy Infini-V from him (a very good product at a reasonable
price). You can also find a number of useful designs at most Traveller web
sites (I\'ve got six low tech vehicle at mine and I\'m adding more).

- ---->Allow me to also pile on: There\'s no data on the weapons mounted
on some of those vehicles included in the book and the mysterious "structure
point" item required for combat is also ignored. Get the Central Suppply
Catalog and check its vehicle construction section at the back. Much better.

Like I said, FFS 1 just has a minimum jump drive size of 2 Kl. If we assume this
to be a typo, and it should be 2 dTons, then the 100 ton jump 1 ship would have
2 dTons of jump drives.  Of course, the key word there is "safely".  Safe for
who?  the ship? or the passengers?  Since there\'s no passengers, we could
violate this rule without much of a handwave.

Hello Simon and List,
  One problem with the succession of Traveller ship building systems, is
that the original system "BOOK 2" wasn\'t all that capable of creating naval
warships larger than the limits of something like 5000 tons (IIRC).  Then
HIGH GUARD came out, and overturned some of the assumptions in Book 2.
Then Megatraveller came out and over turned HG, and so on.

  However, if you note, neither CT or HG had life support systems mentioned
in the rules.  Also, Bridges took a minimum of 20 displacement tons that
current FF&S do not adhere to.  In short, the systems are not compatible
with each other.

  It should be pointed out, that despite there being no mention of life
support, one does not assume that there were none, just that it was part of
the engineering section.  Likewise, CT and HG made the assumptions that a
ship could depressurize.  This cannot be done unless you have a compressor
to do it with.  With the advent of the newer ship building rules, more
detail was added in.  Consequently, looking at something and demanding that
it be "in writing" before you accept it as canon is kind of problematical...

  As I have stated, I am not familiar with T4 FF&S for the simple reason
that it does not really jive well with the CT system of ship building.  I
have an unwillingness to learn to use the newer system of ship building if
I won\'t ever use it.  I still protest the concept of ablative armor.  For
me, a level 1 armor should be proof against a level 1 attack.  A level 2
armor should be proof against a level 1 or 2 attack, and so forth.  In
short, it is not a system that I like.  I won\'t say it\'s a bad system mind
you, but not one that I like, and hence will not really try to learn to use
it - unless I wanted to enter a THUDD competition or something.

  But getting back to my original statement purpose.  When arguing a point
regarding what is or is not rational for the Traveller universe, both you
and I need to remember that there are exactly 4 separate Traveller universe
systems out there and try to keep the "arguments" down to a minimum as to
what is right and what is wrong.  I concede that compressors have to be
accounted for in the ship design via TNE or T4.0 and T4.1.  But, when
talking about "canon" sources, remember that CT was there first <Grin>.
And finally:
  When talking about what can and cannot be discussed between ship design
systems, any "constant" that exists between all systems is fair game to be
discussed using "all" system rules.  As such, the "life support costs"
thread is fair game, as is the "minimum size of jump drives" thread.  Every
system I have seen as a "complete" system states that 100 displacement tons
is the *law*.  Anything else is a violation of "cannon". 

   With that last statement comes my final comment:  Nothing says you have
to use the rules as written...

Of course if a Vilanni starship showed up tommorow filled with TL 11
goodies, they\'d be able to name their price; but I think the point was
converting everyday items to Credits so Referees can quickly allow the
players to do some shopping, and give them an idea of how much money they
have.

For example, a few months back my group needed to buy camoflague fatigues
and climbing equipment.  I went to the US Cavalry catalog, found the
equipment, and cut the price in half to convert to credits.

They didn\'t totally.  Several instances of a woman or two with an otherwise
all-male squadron.  But they eventually created a squadron called "The Night
Witches" that was almost women only.  It had one male pilot who flew with 2
aluminum legs.

Absolute necessity:
Marc Miller\'s Traveller (errata available on the net).

Very useful but not indispensable:

Central Supply Catalogue
Emperor\'s Arsenal
(these both save lots of time in outfitting characters or when the
performance quality of some item becomes important - however, if you\'ve
already got similar stuff in you materials already, you can live without
these).

Very helfpful for running big intersteller campaign:

Pocket Empires  (if contemplating small non-Imperial intersteller empires
and/or generally interested in economic information, etc.)

Imperial Squadrons (if interested in quickly creating squadrons and quickly
resolving space battles).

Milieu 0-Hardcover (allegedly fixes many errata in Milieu 0 and First Survey
- - this is great if you\'re interested in a campaign set in year 0-200.

Only if you have a specific need / interest:

Alien Archives (a great book you could use with any sci-fi RPG, it has minor
alien races that you can place anywhere/when you want - I guess they\'re minor
because they aren\'t a real threat to continued dominance of humaniti - really
a cool book  - I love those "controlled" - if nothing else, this could book
will let you quickly and easily add color and diversity to you traveller
universe).

Fire Fusion and Steel (if you\'re interested in design the ventilation system
of starship liner or need to make a slingshot - errata available on the net -
calculator required).

Psionic Institutes

Avoid at all costs:
Starships (with apologies to its creators who might be on TML :-)  (The only
real value I found in it is the floor plans, but if that is what you need
Naval Architect\'s Manual is much more useful IMHO).

Exactly what I\'ve been doing, though at $3..NZ to Crimp 1.00, which is
roughly the same. I chose this ratio because its what the currency value
table from TNE, Striker, etc gives for TL8 & starport D vs TL15 & \'A\'.
Thechnicaly if you\'re running M:0 you should use a different ratio if
you\'re using this method.

  I\'ll bite - what\'s in the number two slot? Number one is fairly,
obvious, and I still haven\'t been able to trade it away...

  BTW, is there anyone on the list who is in the Netherlands?

  Also, for Mr. Spieker, did you get my mail about the figures?

Frank tells me a great story, one of those things where you wish they\'d had a
camera present. German fighter tangles with a Soviet fighter, and after a long
dog-fight gets shot down. He bails out and lands near the fighter base, and
while they are debriefing him he compliments his opponent and asks to meet
him. The Soviets laugh and bring _her_ in. He refuses to believe it -- some
kind of joke. Then the woman starts going through this moment by moment
account, telling exactly what he did, and exactly what she did. According to
witnesses, the look on the German\'s face was priceless as he realized he had
really been shot down by the tiny little woman standing before him. 

Nice moment, one that deserves some aviation artist to memorialize it...

Ob Trav: This has almost nothing to do with Traveller, except that to
illustrate that people are capable of great things regardless of gender, a
point which Traveller has tried to make repeatedly over the years..

actually, it\'s BOTH that are left out, though the X boat is a book 2 
design;
not a high guard one. Their is no room in the engine compartment for a 
power
plant and a manuever drive as well as a Jump 4 drive. This probably 
explains
the 3 day post jump life support (as opposed to 4 weeks (minimum) with a 
power

I agree about Starships. The worst Traveller product has to be "The

IG broke the rules (surprise surprise!) in "Missions of State" in \'All the

message torpedo. There again, the first two scenarios in that book break
canon liberally. Some of them are excellent though...

I have never pronounced Droyne with the final "e". Always with one syllable.

How is Solomani pronounced?

I will try to explain my way and a friends way.

If you can cope with the LBBs until Marc is finished T4.1 (the revised
rules), I\'d recommend waiting on the rulebook.  (Failing that I have an
extra signed copy, we could work something out.)

If you like designing vehicles get "Fire Fusion & Steel". For all the
typesetting errors, it is a good book and the errata are available. If you
don\'t like designing vehicles, planes, spaceships, etc then don\'t buy this
book.

You will almost certainly like "Central Supply Catalogue". It is a
collection of equipment, with a vehicle design sequence thrown in.
Unfortunately the sequence isn\'t compatible with FFS, and breaks down at
low tech levels, and doesn\'t require crews for even really large engines,
but it\'s still pretty decent. (What this means is that you as a referee
have to exercise some dicretion about what designs are valid in your game,
that\'s all.)

For background, I would recommend either "Milieu 0" or "Milieu 0
Campaign". M0 is a sourcebook about the early Imperium, with all the dirt.
M0C is M0 plus the maps from "First Survey", plus a few extra pages. As I
can\'t really recommend "First Survey", I suggest looking at both products
and deciding whether you would use the maps or not.

Although it\'s a bit heavy on the number crunching, "Pocket Empires" is
invaluable if you want to run adventures where the players are able to
make decisions affecting whole worlds. If your game is at a smaller scale
then you don\'t need this book (unless you really like working out the
economics of your own setting).

"Starships" is mostly an abomination. The ship design sequence is nice,
but the ships in the book are not necessarily designed using any sequence,
and it is overpriced. The deckplans are poorly drawn.  Besides, if you
have FFS you can already design ships.

If you want nicer deckplans, get "Naval Architects Manual". Personally I
find the designs a bit spacious, but they do make great setting for
firefights. This is definately a read-before-buying one though.

"Imperial Squadrons" is great if you are into naval battles and
operations, otherwise fairly useless. Depends on what your campaign is
like.

"Anomalies" is not very good, and contains inconsistencies with other
published material.

"Emperor\'s Vehicles" can be missed. The designs are missing basic
information (tech level, passenger capabilities...).

"Psionic Institutes" would be handy if you plan to use psionics in your
campaign, otherwise give it a miss. (It\'s a good book, but focused.)

"Emperor\'s Arsenal" is pretty good, for a weapons catalogue. I would have
liked to see a design sequence for the weapons, mind you. Also, if your
gamers don\'t shop for firearms then you could put this one low down on the
list.

Finally, the two adventures ("Long Way Home" and "Gateway") are available
as a single book from CORE. The CORE edition has the drawing printed
correctly, so I recommend you get the CORE edition rather than the two IG
editions.

Low tech worlds still depend on technology, and the people who keep it
functioning. A housewife who\'s pot has sprung a leak cannot repair it on
her own; a farmer with a broken plowshare needs a blacksmith to weld the
pieces together. Small settlements cannot support dedicated workers, and
so rely on travelling technicians.

The tinker\'s cart is simply an enclosed box containing a small workshop
and space for personal effects. The driver\'s seat is outside, sheltered
from the elements by a small awning. The cart isn\'t fast, but neither is
the pace of life.

The Sumar chariot is typical of many early wheeled vehicles. The driver

No food is carried, the donkeys grazing whenever they stop.

The Sumar can be outrun by a man of foot, making it more a symbol than an
effective fighting machine.

Considering the speed the shuttle has on touchdown, if it isn\'t landing on the

no?

Unless those road-train highways in the Australian Outback have really straight

Where there\'s smoke, there\'s reporters. With the Reuters news van, any
media organization has all the resources it needs to cover any story. 

The Reuter\'s roomy interior includes a mini-studio (the lab), supported by
a rating-2 computer system. Additionally, the manipulator arm mounts a
remote-operated camera and the extensive sensor suite is integrated into
the media production system to further enhance media productions.

With roomy seating for up to five passengers, sanitary facilities, a wet
bar, grav compensation and full life support, the Reuter is extremely
popular with its crews.

Timely medical attention can be the difference between life and death. The
Hyland, a thicker-skinned varient of the Hippocrates licensed for orbital
use, is typical of purpose-built emergency medical vehicles. It is fast
enough to quickly arrive at an emergency site, and equipped with a two-way
radio so that the attending medics can remain in constant contact with
distant experts. 

Internal facilities provide for two patients and an attending medic in
addition to the driver (who is frequently also a trained medic). (The
"recreation space" is actually working space for the medics.) The small
on-board medical lab is specialized for trauma care.

Slow and lumbering, the Bagrii is none-the-less fast enough to keep up
with an infantry advance; unlike most seige engines, which must be
dismantled and reassembled each time they are moved. While this mobility
is of little use in conventional seiges, it is very useful against heavy
infantry units who lack cavalry screens. 

Extra ammunition is carried in a separate cart.

Most urban areas have a niche for slow-but-spacious delivery vehicles. The
Belsan fills that niche, having room for over 6 kL of cargo. Its slow
maximum speed is rarely an issue for two reasons. First, most of its cargo
is lighter than the design rating, so it can often travel faster. More
importantly, most urban regions have speed restrictions or traffic
patterns that preclude faster travel.

Raw speed. Sometimes nothing else will do. The Baxzat Speeder is built for
speed and nothing else. The ultralight structurecomp chassis is reinforced
for 4G maneuvers, while pilot and passenger are protected by 1G grav
compensators and a windscreen. Roadgrid and active radar provide
electronic assistance to the pilot. Complete SmartCoat coverage lets the
Baxzat reflect its owner\'s every mood.

Lumbering and impractical, this is one of the strangest creations to grace
a battlefield. Born in the fevered imagination of an early inventor,
possibly inspired by stories of high-tech warfare, this early tank pushes
past the limits of practical technology. 

A wheeled large box, armoured in stout ironwood and driven by
muscle-power, the Davincii serves as a mobile artillery platform. Although
it is impervious to small-arms fire, it cannot avoid even heavy infantry
and so must be guarded at all times.

Loren, that is almost a verbatim rendering of the write up of that incident

TRAVELLER
	Traveller was initially published in June, 1977 and within the first 12
months sold more than 10,000 sets.
	Classic Traveller was published between 1977 and 1988 and accounted for more
than 250,000 rules sets. During that time, the basic background for the game
was established.
MegaTraveller shook up the universe by revealing the Rebellion and its
upheaval. The MegaTraveller rules set was published between 1988 and 1991.
	In 1991, Game Designers Workshop undertook a revision in order to emphasize
the military/ mercenary aspects of the game universe. The result was Traveller
New Era, which appeared between 1992 and 1995. 
Traveller 4 (the latest edition of the game system) appeared in 1996.
	A revision of T4 is currently being drafted.

Marc, do you really have one or more of these available?  It\'s unclear
from your list whether you\'re only offering the ones with prices listed or
not.  (Or are you, as the copyright holder, offering photocopies?)  JTAS
#2 is the only Classic Traveller product I lack, and I\'ve been looking for
a copy for a long time.  I am primarily interested in it for the
information, not so much as a collector.  Can you quote me a price?  (From
other Traveller sales and auctions, a good-quality original might end up
in the $30 or more range, I would guess).

If you really have such, let me know and I\'ll add the $3 shipping and get
a check out to you ASAP.

My main point: 1st class on most airlines cost 3-5 times as much as coach
(during a 6-12 hour flight), but you don\'t really get your money\'s worth if
all you are interested in are the various goods and services that go along
with sitting in those nice big chairs.  Since the free slippers and alcohol
cannot possibly make up the difference between 1st class and coach, you can
pretty much explain it away as a status symbol (ie: "we\'re better than
those clowns back in coach.  More caviar, daaaarling?").  And we\'re only
talking about a 10-hour trip, here, not a seven day journey.

There\'s supposed to be a *huge* difference between 1st class and steerage.
This thread began based on the differences between High and Middle Passage.

Good points all.  But in Traveller, High Passage is only an extra 25% of
the cost of a Middle Passage.  A few list members felt that that was too
great a difference (ie: "what do you get for that extra Cr2,000?").  Hence
my the reasoning behind my previous post :)

It was not a typo... at least not for TNE according to Dave Nilsen.  Funny how
this silly "rule" keeps getting broken (in CT:Leviathan and T4:Missions of
State,too ... i\'d be surprised if there\'s not an MT "typo" too...).  That
means 3 out of 4 Traveller versions allow exceptions to the "rule."

Think in terms of the Captain\'s qtrs on an 18th-19th century sailing
ship...  Ship was home to crew for LONG time - Captain\'s qtrs weren\'t
altogether luxurious, but were MUCH preferable to crews\' or officers\' qtrs,
the former living in common and the latter in closets or wardrooms...

"Fteirle".  I\'m not sure of the source of this -- I don\'t think it\'s from
the CT period, but maybe from DGP\'s Solomani & Aslan.  Which I haven\'t
read... I arranged to buy a copy from someone over the net, but I think

I doubt that -- though no probably there\'s a certain element that regards,
say, long-haired and short-haired, or pointy-eared vs. rounded-eared Vargr
to be distinct species, just as today there\'s a certain segment of American
society that regards our inherited 19th-century racial classifications as
representing natural species boundaries.

The issue is that there\'s no single Vargr language, or even a widespread
Vargr "language of wider communication", so there\'s no single autoethnonym.
Each of the (presumably) gajillions of separate Vargr languages will have
their own terminology...  I\'d just make up something differently wheezy and
slobbery-sounding each time someone asks, and go with that ;)

>3. Is the final \'e\' on \'Droyne\' pronounced?

If one assumes that it\'s a Galanglic word, or an older loan fully
assimilated into Galanglic phonology, I\'d say no -- rhyme it with "coin".
If one takes the point of view that it\'s an Oynprith word, in the Droynes\'
own language, then the final "e" should be pronounced -- same vowel as in
Engl. "get" (according to the CT alien module on the wee scaly minions of
the Great Old One.)

Couldn\'t one compare in terms of basic needs?  Move away from buying
antimatter and space ships, and take a look at what, say, an average
Imperial citizen might make and what portion of that income might be spent
on food, housing, etc., then look at similar incomes and outgoes for, say,
a US citizen...  I suspect that if a middle-class salary-earner of the
Imperium makes, say, Cr8000 per year, and spends, say, Cr3000 on food and
shelter, one could compare that to average middle-class US food and housing
costs...  Somebody properly grounded in econ would likely make much more
sense than I do, but I think there ARE grounds for comparison...

If it lands in the Northern Territory outside the boundaries of a town, it
wont get a speeding ticket. The Northern Territory has a speed limit of
"yes" outside town boundaries.

Now, the Nullabor Highway is sealed (*) and has straight sections of around
100 km at a time. Unofortunatly, it is in Western or South Australia, so
there is a speed limit of 110 km/h, so the pilot may get booked for speeding.

The Nullabor Highway is also on a couple of lanes, so it will take some
fancy driving to land the Shuttle there.

Ian Whitchurch

(*) Being an unsealed road does not disqualify a road from being called a
highway in Australia.

I suspect that crew either get more time between runs, or else they get
frequent vacations.

Slight problem. It can take more than an hour to transfer the data from
the incoming boat to the outgoing one.

Alas, if you are in the accretion disk of a black hole, you are *dead*.
The radiation levels are *far* above fatal, and the magnetic fields
will fry anything electrical, much less electronic.

It\'s effectively impossible. The force required to cause a *noticeable*
change in a planet\'s orbit far exceeds the *strength* of the planet.
If the force is concentrated on a small area, whatever is generating it
would push itself through the planet.  If the force is spread over a
wider area, it may break the planet into pieces. 

An explosion *won\'t* do it, because the blast has so many directions to
expand in. And again, by the time iot got near the required energy,
it\'d ruin the planet in a big way.

The "Space:1999" trick with the moon was *completely* out of the
question. If there\'s enough acceleration to *feel (much less enough to
plaster folks to the floor the way they showed, then the back side of
the moon would effectively be a sheet of rock hanging unsupported over
nothing with that same force pushing *down* on it. In which case it\'d
fall apart. 

Just to get the idea across, the mass of the earth is 6e24 kg (that\'s a
6 followed by 24 zeroes). To give it a velocity of 1 m/sec (added to or
subtracted from its existing velocities) would take an impulse of 6e24
newton-seconds (ie 1 newton for 6e24 seconds, 2 newtons for 3e24
seconds, etc). The energy required is 3e24 joules. That\'s the energy
generated by converting 33,333 1/3 *metric tons* of matter to energy.
Or 714 *million* megatons of TNT. 

Compare this with the sun\'s output of 4e26 joules/sec. (133 1/3 times
as much)

And for all that, it\'d take 74 *days* for the Earth\'s position to be
different by one radius from what it would have been if you had done
nothing.

Slight problem. It still depends on the relative velocity of the stars.

Well, as I noted, anything *approaching* the densities shown on TV and
in the movies would rapidly condense it semisolid bodies, as well as
grind the larger bodies down into smaller ones.

I\'ll have to find out if anyone has an estimate for the volume those
300 bodies are spread through. I expect they will still be at least
*miles* apart, if not *hundreds* of miles.

The relative velocities are going to be *really* low.

What makes you think it\'ll be erased at all? Port records from the 1600s
are still around. And I suspect that much airline schedule info is
still around even after years. Bureaucracies don\'t throw away info. And
in any case, this sort of thing doesn\'t take up all that much space. 

I suggest checking into historical data from back when ships where the
fastest means of communication. It\'ll show you what *was* done.

Technically "digit" with no modifier applies *only* to base 10.

Cargo containers will be air-tight, just as current ones can handle a
*lot* of exposure to salt water. It\'s not a good idea to assume that
your cargo *won\'t* be exposed to vacuum. And as I pointed in posts a
while back, cargo containers may be "stored" in vacuum rather often.

For personal gear, I rather suspect that most will either be "vacuum
safe" or be kept in a "pressure tight" section of your locker. Given
the range of pressure on worlds where you can breathe without anything
more than a filter mask, a lot of items we are used to may not be as
common. Pressurized spray cans for one. And containers for liquids and
"volatile" solids may be different as well.

The one *big* argument against "general" decompression is that it will
deterimentally affect all but the crudest life support systems.

Apologies for missing the prior post.  I don\'t think that formulation works.
The range of results is close (15-1) but the values aren\'t evenly distributed.
15-0=15
14-1=13
13-2=11
12-3=9
11-4=7
10-5=5
9-6=3
8-7=1
(and then back up the scale).
The 1 value is an additional problem, since you can\'t get this with 2 dice
Perhaps it should be treated as PSI 0.

Wouldn\'t 15-number incorrect work better?  or 0+number correct? (as is
originally suggested)?

That\'s precisely what I have done in my Traveller Universe. Or rather, many
years ago I worked out a system (inspired by Jack Vance) for my own RPG
system where generic wages and prices were expressed in terms of hourly,
daily, monthly and yearly wages for an unskilled manual laborer (BUSHIDO
did something similar, except it was in terms of minimum food rations). It
worked out very well for my fantasy campaign (of course, for specific
countries I worked out more evokative names for the currencies, but the
silver denarius of the Gardic Empire (1 daily wage) just happened to have
the same weight and buying power as the silver mark of Neuland, etc.).
When I tried to convert that system for use in my Traveller campaign some
years ago I made the happy discovery that 1 credit turned out to be pretty
close to my hourly wage unit. Now, there\'s serendipity for you! (The same
turns out to be the case for the GURPS $, btw.)

By my calculations the average income in Traveller comes to Cr9,600, which
I rounded up to Cr10,000 for convenience. The thing is, if you use the PE
formula for generating Resource Units, you get a figure that you can use
for converting the credits of one planet for the credits of another. (I\'m
just not sure that the use of TL as multiplier for the RUs produced
adequately express the difference between various TLs. I suspect that TL
squared will be a better approximation).

It appears that either you or I have misunderstood something. IIRC the
original question was about what you get for the Cr2000 (on the average)
that the starship captain (or purser) has to plunk down for each occupied
stateroom, regardless of whether it is occupied by a crewmember, a Middle
or a High passenger. I believe that you\'ve been misled by the fact that
the two figures are both Cr2000.

It\'s true that the Cr8000 for a Middle passenger is too much for a jump-1
and jump-2 passage and too little for any higher jump, but that\'s a
different matter (and one that partly depends on the true costs of life
support (but only partly, since even at the (IMO) grossly inflated
figure of Cr2000/jump life support account for much less than 50% of
the total expenses)).

Well, the solar sail would be REALLY expensive. We are after all trying to
keep a station at bay. Still, the assumption is that you\'re in micro gravity
as far as planetary bodies and stars are concerned.  So, compared to a
starship maneuvering, you don\'t need much thrust at all.

How far do they move (relatively) in the course of a week? Assuming they move
at a predictable rate, this can be accounted for in the astronomics test.

Actually, none of this matters since jumps bring you insystem at 100
diameters.  Since you\'re jumping into a gravitationally empty space, you
should be able to end your jump at essentially zero distance from the station.

It\'s interesting that it took this long. Either Imperial biotechnology
is astonishingly primitive (no DNA testing/sequencing capability), or 
the Coyne ritual actually alters DNA (as opposed to just selecting what
gets expressed from information already coded into the DNA) and chripers 
really are genetically different from adult Dryone.

life support for all passengers and crew.  Since that\'s kCr 2 per trip,
that comes out to something like kCr 50 per year, right?

A small stateroom costs kCr 40, and half of a large stateroom costs 
kCr 50.  The argument could be made that some of this "life-support"
expense goes into replacing fittings for the staterooms that get too
worn out, as well as for food, recharging air systems, starport fees
for discharging effluvia from the system, replacing towels that have
been stolen as "souvenirs", licensing fees to ISCAP for the ship\'s
entertainment systems, liability insurance (in case you get sued),
safety equipment (how much do rescue balls, survival kits, fire
extinguishers, medical supplies and all that cost to keep up?), the
cleaning supplies, and so on.

Another sink for some of the money might be for temporarily replacing
stateroom fittings to suit non-human passengers.  Good design would
help some, but you aren\'t going to carry furniture that works for
everyone, and then cleaning the smell of sulfur dioxide taint out of
the carpet could get expensive.

Anyone have other ideas?

This is coming out of the starship design rules for T4 (at least QSDS),
which state that a middle passenger requires "at least a small stateroom"
while high passengers require a large stateroom.  Obviously, the THUDDD
competitors figured out that kCr 8/2 tons is more than kCr 10/5 tons (I\'m
including the ton of cargo high passengers get).

In twenty tons, you can carry
  ten middle passage, small-single or large-double   (kCr 80 - 20)
  five middle passage, large staterooms (single)     (kCr 40 - 10)
  four high passage, four tons baggage               (kCr 40 - 8)
 
The best return is on middle passengers in double-occupancy large cabins
or single-occupancy small staterooms.  I\'m sure the THUDDD competitors
went with small staterooms based on the fact that they\'re both cheaper
and by ruling that small staterooms prevented bumping (and a halving of
their potential revenue).

For argument\'s sake, let\'s say that the first option is outlawed.  Then
it looks to me that most ships would outfit cabins based on the third
option; four large staterooms and four tons baggage space.  Carrying high
passengers is barely more economical due to savings in life-support,
even after adding in half of a steward.  Reductions in the cost of life
support might flip the balance the other way, although the steward also
adds value by attracting more passengers to the ship (keeping staterooms
full), which may tip the balance back toward outfitting for high passage
travelers if the reductions aren\'t too great.

On the other hand, I\'m not sure I want to be arguing for abolition of 
the double-occupancy middle passage tickets.  Perhaps one reason why
ships carry high passengers anyway is that despite the fact that they
are less profitable than two middle passengers, there\'s only so many
people who want to travel middle passage.  Thoughts?

Thruster-plates are a much better solution, and also (compared to other

That\'s a valid point, Leonard.  However, I\'d argue that, since the
base system you use is dead (except among archeologists studiing that
culture) and the base system I propose is in wide use, my solution
is more like to fly than is yours. :^)

Conceiveably, since no base system was specified in the question, one
could presumably invent one on the spot with an arbitrarily large
number of individual digit characters and produce a truly *huge*
result.  Given that the base system I chose was so commonly recognized
(within the field of computer science, at least), I didn\'t consider
it cheating, but rather taken advantage of a loophole in the rules.
As always, YMMV. :^)

  },
  {
    'body' => 'Each Passenger has a Standard Vacc Suit allocated to
their personal use, and it is used during standard safety
procedure training prior to departure.

Each Vacc suit is packaged in a tamper proof container,
prior to issue bearing the certification of the Imperial
Stellar Safety Office.  

Upon receipt of the Vacc suit the passenger will need to
sign form ISSO form 1023 to acknowledge that the Vacc suit
has been received in full working order - as per the 
certification tags on the suit container.

There follows a standard Vacc Suit drill in which all 
passengers must either undertake or sign ISSO waiver form
number 1911.  Following the Vacc Suit drill each person
will be given a duplicate of form ISSO 2112 which details
their instruction.  

Legal note - once the form ISSO 1023 has been signed the
Vacc Suit and its maintenance is the responsibility of the
passenger, so any damage to the suit is the liability and risk
of the passenger.  Should a suit fail due to negligence of the
passenger, then a replacement suit may be sought from the 
estate of the passenger.

Form ISSO 1713 is used in the event that the passenger or crewmember
wishes to use their own Vacc Suit instead of the one that they 
have been issued.


All forms completed are scanned into the data of the responder/
black box and also transmitted to the nearest star base by radio
and or laser comm.


Part of the expenses per passenger is for the certification and
maintenance of each Vacc Suit carried by star faring ships.

Each Vacc suit must be replaced after 26 issues of not more than
two weeks to satisfy ISSO regulations.

If not used in two months the suit must be checked and certified.

Each Vacc suit must be inspected and maintained after each issue
lasting not more than two weeks.



Costs

Per Issue 			400 cr     (assumes Vacc Suit is replaced in 1 year)
Per Certification		 50 cr     (Includes ISSO form pack with the suits
serial number)
Maintenance 		100 cr     (replacement seals, repackaging, cleansing)


These costs are paid out of the 2000cr per passenger and crew for
life support.  It may be that some Captains can reduce the costs
and perhaps offer incentives for crew and passengers to sign form
ISSO 1713.

The TAS advises members to have their Vacc suits certified to ISSO
standards by members of the Institute of Vacc Suit Technicians.

The IVST are a professional body certified jointly by the Jump Space
Institute and the TAS.  It may be noted that members of TAS may 
obtain a 20% discount by using a IVST member for certification and
maintenance of their Vacc Suits.


Starship Expenses

Assume that on average 550cr will be spent per passenger and crewmember
in relation to Vacc Suit maintenance and certification.  This may be
much less if standards are compromised.

>Sure, but my point was that you\'d *still* have to serve the places

Agreed...

  That is why I am trying to resolve this as both a time issue and as a
service issue.  To date, I am working on identifying the current routes in
Spinward marches, and using the older HG rules, create a series of ships
that would be used in X-boat service.  The next step for me is to determine
times of travel to each of the current locations and eliminate as much
slack time as is possible.
  One problem I see with the X-boat routes is that they include in some
places, jump two distances.  This would be handled by a scout ship courier.
 Think about it...

Suppose you had a line that was linear, with a jump 4 to get to point A,
Jump 2 to get to point B, and Jump 4 to get to point C.  Under the old
system, we use a total of 3 weeks to get to point C.  Under the new system,
we only take 2 weeks to get to point C, while Point B takes 3 weeks to get
the information it used to get in only 2.  However, for every situation
where this time savings occurs, the data/mail gets to the  outer limits
that much sooner.  If this happens at least 6 times between the Capital of
the Imperium and the outermost limits of it\'s borders - then we will have
shaved off a considerable amount of time.  

  The other advantage of having "short cuts" is that you don\'t require the
information that is location specific to travel through locations that are
not important to it.  If you are trying to create an Express train route,
you don\'t route it through every train stop do you?  You route it through
the least distance possible with the least time required.

  All in all, I saying that the Express routes are not *express*.  If the
key limitation to how large an Imperium can get is based upon
communications, Rapid communications, then the *X-boat* routes need to be
maximized, because the government *needs* to have it that way.

Not to mention their own video library!

<<<<Officers are the only ones who actually have staterooms....

Richard>>>>>

Let me give the Marine Officer viewpoint from deploying on an LHA (a
large troop carrier with flight deck and well deck).  The ship has
berthing spaces and facilities for the Marine unit afloat (office space,
war room, etc.).  For messing (eating), working out, etc., we were part
of the ship\'s company and "mixed in" with the Navy crew...

Marine enlisted:  As Richard described.  NCO\'s may have a separate
berthing area, but just as cramped.  Benefit is that they are all of the
same ranks (Cpl/Sgt)

Staff NCO\'s:  (SSgt for the Marine Corps)  Did not rate being in the
Chief\'s berthing because in the Navy, E7 and above is considered a
SNCO.  SSgts were given their own berthing area, and as much room as
could be spared.  After all, the Corps is built on the NCOs and SNCOs.

GySgts and above:  Racked in the Chief\'s berthing.  They became part of
the Chief\'s mess...

Junior officers (WO - 02):  We were billeted 4 to a room.  Two sets of
bunk beds, two little desks (built into the lockers on the wall), etc. 
No space to really do anything, but could sit in your rack to read. 
(that was our assigned place of duty in General Quarters, BTW).

Captains/Majors/LtCol (03 - 05):  2 to a room.  If there had been a
spare stateroom, the majors would have had their own.  We were too
cramped for that.  XO (major) had his own room with office attached.  CO
(LtCol) had a bigger room with bigger office attached.  For a bigger
unit, a Col (O6) would have bigger yet, perhaps a suit.  

O6 and above were part of the Flag Mess, where he ate with the CO of the
ship, the Admiral and assorted others.  The rest of us lowlifes were
part of the wardroom where we chowed with the ship\'s officers.  The XO
of the ship (O6) was the president of the mess.

The CO (of USN ships) have awesome quarters (as a general rule).  That
stems in part from their being a representative of the US wherever they
go, and often they would entertain local government officials, etc.  

I remember a time earlier (when I was a kid) staying in the CO\'s
quarters.  We were being evacuated by the 6th Fleet from Cyprus and
being taken to Beruit (of all places!)  We (my mom, younger bro and I)
stayed in the CO\'s suite.  Someone else was in the sleeping quarters,
but the carpet was an inch thick, the walls panelled in oak, original
oil paintings on the wall, beautiful leather couches/chairs, color
TV...  And the dining area had a walnut table, china cabinets, chairs,
etc.  He also put his two valets at our disposal to give us anything we
needed to include breakfast, whenever we woke up...made to order.  

I NEVER got that treatment when I was on active duty!

Got longer than I thought.  Sorry.

If you want to be consitent with the Traveller background, you
really need to presume that even in jump space, you need a conscious
pilot.  Otherwise the space lanes would be full of automatic

    'body' => '	I am contemplating making a supplement for Traveller that is similar to
the Core/BITS 101 books.  What I am proposing initially is a 111
Mercenaries supplement.  In the supplement, I see a \'casual encounter\'
description of the NPC/Character as well as military awards, multiple
notable battles and achievements based on  different \'mileu\' for use in any
traveller genre.  The NPC would include items of interest such as, the
NPC\'s usual demeanor, likely places to be encountered, likely equipment
selections, etc. as well as a \'genre-neutral\' detailed background to help
explain some of the character\'s history and accomplishments.  I foresee the
book being broken down into several sections with several characters to
each section.  With the sections being devoted to the different branches of
the military services such as: Navy, Marine, Army, Scouts, and Special
Ops/IRIS/Ine Gvar/Covert commando types.

	Would this booklet have any type of market?  What would something like
this be worth to the general traveller fan?  What other types of 111 type
books would be sought after?  (i.e. 111 Diplomats, 111
Robots/Androids/Cyborgs, 111 Ultra-Technologies, 111 Ancient Sites, etc.)

Any input will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

My suggestion would be to try and get as much bcakground material as
possible, ie MT library data etc. This is harder to do than I suggest,
but any campaign you run or enter will be based on your or their
preference and may not necessarily be \'current\'.  My preference is to
try and blend all versions together using designer\'s licence. I have to
put my tongue in cheek on several canon rules but I have fun.

This is one (two?) to get.  Night of Conquest has the players trapped in a
large, TL4 city being invaded.  A fairly freeform adventure, the push is
trying to get back their ship, which can easily defeat the invaders,
securing liberty, justice, and fat trading contracts.  Divine Intervention
has the characters infiltrating the grav palace of a theocratic ruler to
deliver a message from God.  Good sneak\'n\'peak, not good for those who
think subtlety is only firing single shots as opposed to full auto.

Tarsus is and Agricultural world in district 268.  Well done overall, but I
found it to be fairly thin.  Beltstrike does the same for an Asteroid Belt,
with simil;ar results.  If you are a completeness fanatic, go for it.

    But OC you silly stupid ignorant MAN, don\'t you know that woman are
incapable of discrimination? <sigh> I\'ve actually had many Femminist here in
Sodom on the Potomac (Washington DC) say this too me with a straight face and
they BELIEVE IT! <shakes head>

    I heard a story once about one of the first women to graduate West Point.
She put in for Infantry and failed something like 80% of all the physical
tests.  The training sargeant took her aside, showed her the scores and
politely asked her to pull out before he had to fail her.  She told him that he
was mistaken and that the test scores had best allow her to pass, when he told
her that he would not change the scores for her...  He was reassigned before
the next day of class and she passed.
    I must admit that at first I discounted that as sour grapes.  Unfortunately
I\'ve since had the chance to talk to a number of training personel in the
various services and they\'ve all said pretty much the same thing.  And before
someone asks how I talked to them... I was working up on Capital Hill at the
time, before the realities of Government disillusioned me and made me more
cynical then I already was. :(

    Out in California about two years back a videotape got out of the Final
Physical Tests required of Firefighters, I "think" this for San Francisco but
I\'m not at all certain.  Anyway this is a pass/fail test, you can\'t do the
basic physical work, after eight/twelve weeks of training I might add, you\'re
not supposed to become a Firefighter.  Anyway this tape showed the women
failing EVERY test, it wasn\'t staged, someone had brought along a camcorder
just for the heck of it.  The two scenes that stuck out in my mind were the one
with a woman in gear collapsing as a standard hose rig was lowered on her
shoulder - she was supposed to carry it something like two hundred feet or some
such.  The other was raising the ladder, individually the women simply could
not work the ladder into position, they had to have the instructors help them
and in one case the ladder fell on the woman and knocked her out cold!
    Yet none of the women taking that test were listed as failing and all
should still be serving as front line Firefighters.

    I heard recently that one of the major network news organizations had put
together an "expose" piece about this sort of thing and worse.  The Reporter, a
woman actually, had done a piece of Navy ships and used extra footage gathered
on that for a more honest look.  When it hit the Story Review Committe, the
three women editors blew their stacks, one even called up NOW and got presure
brought to bear from that quarter to kill the story.  They fired the woman who
did the report too, she ended up in some midwest market struggling to climb
back up the "ladder" of market stations.
    Amazing how we never hear about this sort of thing isn\'t it? <sigh> I
suspect we\'re going to have to have our asses handed to us here in the US.
REPEATEDLY, before it dawns on the collective political establishment just how
bad things have gotten. <SIGH> I\'m not against women or their rights per se,
but as I\'ve said to others.  Women\'s Rights is inherently discriminatory, HUMAN
RIGHTS are not. ;)

    OB Traveller; this sort of thing HAS to have popped up on the Imperium.
Probably with every new planet they contact, so what would the Imperial Policy
on it be I wonder?

   Chirpers appear to be Droyne children (not that this is generally 
known even in 1100).  So they look similar to small Droyne, but 
without any of the caste adaptations, and less intelligent.  They 
have limited social organization, living in small groups largely as 
gatherers.

   I don\'t know if they are covered in current supplements; my 
information comes from Alien Module 5 and Research Station Gamma.  I 
can type up what they have as Library Data entries if you like.

Absolutely.

Seriously, I\'d just treat it as a loanword from Oynprith, in which the
pronunciation changed to match Galanglic (i.e., 20th century English)
spelling pronunciations.  Overeducated and/or pretentious characters can
pronounce it in the authentic Droy-neh fashion, n\'est ce pas?  (Don\'t you
think that Droyne would look really great in berets, smoking Galloises and
talking about poststructuralism and auteur theory?)

Quickie essentialist language explanation:  Oynprith is essentially Pig
Latin spoken by bumblebees with forked tongues.

I wonder why she bothered to apply for Infantry when that MOS is blocked
for women (directly combat related.)  She wouldn\'t have been able to even
ask for it.  I\'ve heard the same story about a female cadet asking for
Armor, or a middie wanting to go into the Marine infantry.  I beleive this
one is an Urban Legend.

This one I know about, because two firefighters were fired over it.  It was
in Oakland (just across the Bay), and the video was of a run through
*early* in the program.  It was done to show them "this is how far you have
to go"

The firefighters, who were opposed to women serving in "their" department,
leaked the tape to local media and told them it was of the final exam.

Ob. Trav:  On a world where political correctness is the rule, the players
might be tripped up by being forced to hire a completely incompetent
driver/guide/whatever, simply because he\'s "opressed."

S\'truth, milord. With my own eyes I have seen passenger lists for vessels from
Germany docking in Philadelphia going as far back as 1740. Useful for
geneologists, doncha know.

I expect Lloyds have records that go back farther than that. A lot of this
stuff is spotty, the further back in time you get (Gawd, what I wouldn\'t give
to have the publication rights to one intact Roman census).

I suppose the mainstream theory pre-1000 (since it\'s pretty obvious that chirpers/
droyne are at least somewhat related) is that chirpers
are "Droyne monkeys" - a vaguely related not-quite-sentient ancestor 
species. Since every time someone gets a bunch of the little chirper weasels
together for some basic biological experimentation the researcher forgets
where he put them, it\'s not wholly surprising research didn\'t progress any
further.      

It still does imply (as lots of other things do) that there\'s much less
pure research-for-research\'s sake in the third Imperium - there\'s no money
in calculating genetic divergence between ape species, but people do it 
anyway.

Using chirpers for twisted psionic experiments leading towards FTL comm, on
the other hand, there\'s plenty of funding for.

Heh. Actually, there was even a book written about the guy... 

(He lost his legs after crashing in a forest, crawled back to base 
and got prosthetic ones... And they wouldn\'t let him fly again. But 
he, as a true communist, attained his goal. ;>>>)

WAY TOO many filters at that price.  I could maybe see a filter that
expensive covering a whole ship for a day.

ARE YOU NUTS!?   Again, WAY TOO expensive.  You can get water purification
tablets for 5 cr per 250 litres.

Huh?  Parts that wear out fall under Maintenance, NOT stateroom overhead.

> Food            30 meals @ Cr10         Cr 300

I won\'t really argue this if you\'re using prepacked meals, but if you\'ve
got a steward and a galley, food cost drops to 25-30%

> Reserve Water   40l @ Cr5               Cr 200

Correct me if I\'m wrong but isn\'t unrefined fuel water?  Isn\'t that 100 Cr
per 14000 liters?

> O2/N Tanks      8 @ Cr50                Cr 400

One TL 12 HP tank holds enough air for 24 man-hours if you recycle the air
(see filters above).  Recharging them cost 10 Cr.  2 weeks = 170 Cr

> Toiletries      Cr100                   Cr 100

Just how much soap do you go through in two weeks?  Outside 10 Credits
Maybe.

> Cleaning/etc    Cr100                   Cr 100

This would be cleaning materials since labor is covered under crew salary.
That\'s WAY expensive too.

In theory it can land on a pretty "normal" runway. It just needs to be
paved, and long enough. The fun part is if there *isn\'t* a convenient
runway. 

The Shuttle could possibly *land* on a reasonably flat piece of ground.
It\'d likely not be salvageable, but there crew would have a decent
chance of surviving.

This reminds me vaguely of the different alien types in David Brin\'s Sundiver
books.  There are two main division\'s between species: oxygen breathers and
hydrogen breathers, and neither understands the other at all.  Hydrogen breathers
are mysterious and unfathomable to Oxygen breathers and there is very little
interaction between the two because they aren\'t interested in the same planets
(and I think there is a notion that their brains don\'t work the same way).

They do.  Their records were the basis of one of what-his-name\'s Connections

There was a WWI French pilot that had the same happen to him.  Can\'t remember the name,
but was treated like royalty when captured by the Germans.  THey even made him a new set
of legs. Reminds me of the film The Grand Illusion.

I\'ve been toying with borrowing some ideas/effects from Cherryh\'s 
work.  

IMTU, possiblymaybeperhaps, the jump will take one week in 
real-space, but only a fraction of that time passes for the ship.  
The jump is uncomfortable and draining to the people on the ship 
(some races requiring drugs to make the jump), and you\'d normally 
need food and rest between jumps.  It also takes time recover your 
senses from the jump-transition, so a ship is quite vulnerable at 
this time.  These lead to fully-crewed ships having two shifts, the 
second taking over immediately after the jump.

No, it\'s really true.  In fact, a woman friend of mine told me so, and she

destroying America\'s combat-readiness and force-projection ability.

Nice try... Commie pinko devil worshipping \'Frisco-dwelling spin-doctor,

completely incompetent clerks, technicians, waiters, guides, lawyers,
brokers, and police, simply because they\'re the ones who were born on lucky

I would suggest that Low Passengers do not need to be supplied with a Vacc
Suit
and that they may either be supplied with survival bubbles and or one use
emergency
Vacc Suits.

I would guess that Low Passengers would be safer staying in the Low Berths,
assuming
that each low berth has an internal power supply for emergencies that last
upto 
one month.

Low Passengers are asked that should they anticipate the use of a Vacc Suit
that
they supply their own.

Ok, folks what is 9^99? 

But that\'s not *nearly* as large as 9^(9^9)!

You can play the same tricks with hexidecimal if you are oriented that way
as well...F^(F^F) is a pretty large number, sort of reminds me of the USA\'s
national debt. ;-p

But, let\'s be serious here...I\'d give 9^9^9 the full two points, wouldn\'t
you?

Um, Leonard, *what* is invisible unless one is Illuminated?

Does anybody really run an Illuminated Traveller?  We\'ve talked about the
Templars, Hiver manipulations, and subtle influences from Granddad, but is
anybody actually applying any of this in a game?

The best single secondary source for things like this is a French historian
by the name of Fernand Braudel (aka God).

He is chock-a-block full of great stuff, exquisitly referenced and footnoted. 

For distances, speeds and so on, you really cant go past pp 355-379 of \'The
Meditteranean in the time of Philip II\'.

Finally, Lloyds wont have records going a lot further back than the 1700s,
because maritime insurance was based in Genoa and Holland before this.
Loren, what you want is the Securitatum register in AdS, Genoa. See around
p620, op cit.  

People interested in piracy issues should check out p299-312 of the same
book too.

the former statements seem to agree with what everyone else feels and I
guess can be accepted as normal routine. The last part leaves me
wondering if SDB\'s are possibly a lot more active in dealing with
illegal traffic than with actual system defenses.

I hadn\'t really thought of the article as being that impotant, and
wouldn\'t a guarded convoy draw more attention from pirates or marauders
than an unguarded tramp freighter, even though the latter would, in most
instances, be easier to take.

Kenji, let me know for sure where you are campaigning so that I can

This is what I believe would be standard practice, if only to know what
one should be receiving. Where the system might fall down is between
competing empires, where there is little if any trust between them.
Since there seems to be a lack of definative rules, we could assume that
the Imperial authorities/Scouts negotiated xboat priveleges with the
proviso that they would be exempt from military action (ie like the red
cross is/was treated in wars past)

Yes, and what I read about the x-boat system was that a branch of the
Imperial Scouts had that duty as one of their main functions.

and possibly the \'new\' cargo manifesto, it being assumed that anything
new was added at this port, anything missing was bartered and should be
locatable dirtside or in a warehouse.

I would presume that such information would be very hard to come by, at
first, unless it was government/military requested, and would carry a
strict/costly information retrieval method involving lots of red tape
for the casual inquirer. Information that is out-dated (3+ months or so)
would be a lot easier to recover. I base my presumption on the need to
keep certain information (especially new inventions, current medical
discoveries, government thinking) out of the hands of \'ordinary\' people
until it is proven, certain or agreed upon by those in power.

I suppose a ship could be posted at or near a gas giant to *note
arriving ships* but it seems to me that space is a very, very, VERY
large place and 1 small ship on the opposite side of even a small GG
could quite easily be lost to detection, IF the captain is trying to
*get away with something*.

Hey, I just wanted to point out that it was Robert that jacked up the
prices, not me!  ;->

I still think the numbers I gave were a little high.  Things like purifying
water and oxygen shouldn\'t be much of a problem with all that power from
the fusion engines, so I think filters have to be all that high-tech. 
Pulling toxic chemicals out of the air is something we can do now...or Mir
would already be a tomb.  A few cubic meters of water can provide all the
back up oxygen you need when you crack it, and your passengers are likely
to put more water into the life system than you need with a good closed
system to collect it, crack it, pull off the hydrogen and oxygen and then
recombine them.

The food prices I quoted were what you\'d pay to eat in a restaurant.  I
figure they are high, but in the ballpark.  Through in a few extra weeks of
prepackaged food, just in case, amortized over 6 months or so.

I think something like 700 per week for normal life support is reasonable. 
High passengers might be charged a premium for fancy food, bottled water,
scented air, fresh sheets every day, but an extra 300 per week would be
pushing it.

Finally, remember I don\'t have an compunction about breaking canon.  ;->

    I\'m relying on my memory here, but didn\'t the Zhodani have lot\'s of contact
with Chirpers and Droyne fairly early on?  For the conspiracy minded it\'s quite
possible that the Zhodani used/protected them to some extant?  And that\'s
something the Imperial Intelligence services would have noticed...  Not to
mention that this IS something that the Scouts should be investigating...  i
wonder if certain elements within the Imperium\'s military establishment knew
Exactly what Chirpers were fairly early on and it took the civilian research
establishment centuries to catch on.
    Another thing, I remember reading in the Zhodani AM that they valued both
Chirpers and Droyne for their ability to teach Psionics.  I wonder if the
Imperial Psionic\'s establishment didn\'t covertly use them in the same way.

I am, sort of.  My campaign with my brother and a friend is just starting.
They\'ll become aware of, and possibly invited into, a secret order roughly
based on such ideas.  I haven\'t worked out all the details because they\'re not
very far along yet.  Its in Milieu 0, which I think gives a wealth of
opportunities.

I\'ll save any further details because (1) I may be recruiting some more PBEM
players in the near future, and (2) I\'m sure I know what I\'m talking about.

I studied mathematics through advanced calculus and although much of it escapes
me now, I have never seen a double exponent x^y^z.  So, at first glance, this
answer loses points in my book, because it seems foolish.  If however it is an
actual system used in higher math, then I\'ll give an extra point to EDU, maybe,
if you make successful bribery task.

>Subject: Info needed

These are *very* broad subjects, but I\'ll do my best to give a brief
precises (heavy emphasis on the brief bit).

>Can anybody please tell me about the following:

>	1)	Pocket Universes.

Covered in Adventure 12 - Secret of the Ancients. Basically, a pocket
universe is exactly what it sounds like, a universe in a pocket. Take a
section of the regular universe and "pinch" it off so that it no longer
connects with it. Its never mentioned if they can occur naturally or if
they need to be created, IMTU they can occur naturally as by products
from a singularity. Creation of a pocket universe is TL30+ at minimum.

>	2)	Portals.

A conection between the regular universe and a pocket universe (also
covered in Adventure 12). Basically they are tied to a particular
pocket universe, which "follows" a master portal around. I don\'t have
Adventure 12 here at the moment, but from memory they can function in
one of two ways. Either as a gateway from our universe to the pocket
universe, or as a teleportation system, allowing transit between two
portals (using the pocket universe as an energy sink). Creation of
portals is TL25.

>	3)	The Ancients.

Where to begin? The Ancients are an enigmatic race who achieved mind
boggling technology (TL30+) some 300,000 years before the foundation
of the 3rd Imperium, before wiping themselves out in a 2000yr long
fratracidal war; leaving only shattered remnants of their glories. They
are resposible for: scattering Humans to the stars, uplifting the Vargr
to sentience, a very large number of asteriod belts (byproducts of the
Final War), and doing generally bizzare things. Covered in detail in
Adventures 2, 3, and 12; Alien Modules 4 (Zhodani) and 5 (Droyne).
Most common distinguishing feature of Ancient sites is inconsitancy.
Artifacts found within a site will be consistant with other found
within the site (usually) but only very rarely with those from other
sites. There\'s a lot of data on them scattered around the web. Check
the AAB site and somewhere there\'s a list of all "canon" Ancient sites
(I can\'t recall the URL\'s for either of these sites sorry).

>	4)	Traveller News Service reports from around 1106 to 1125.

Check the not-the-Imperiumgames Web site. It has all the articles from
1105 to 1125. (I\'m sorry I don\'t have it\'s URL handy).

Sorry I can\'t remember the URL\'s, but they are all on the Traveller Web
Ring and the AAB site is listed on the Imperiumgames links page.

Try pricing HEPA filters... While I admit that his prices seem a bit

And if you use those in a closed environment, you\'ll poison everyone in
short order. They are based on chlorine or iodine, and onboard ship,
you can\'t just let the active ingredient diffuse into the atmosphere.
There isn\'t all that much atmosphere.

Unrefined fuel is liquid hydrogen. A far cry from water.

James Burke did the Connections series.

Also, we have _accurate_, if disjointed, written records dating back
thousands of years to just above TL0. How many Sumerian cuneiform tablets
have we uncovered? They date back almost 6000 years. 

Of course, those _are_ the ancient traces of our former Vilani overlords,
but I digress... ;-)

Unless it\'s embarasing to someone.

Hm. Plot idea. Gaps in old records indicate something\'s up. Why would
there be no record of this ship? We know that it sailed, we have
eye-witnesses. What was its real cargo? Why have the file access logs been
security sealed for that year only?

Alternately, the plotters forgot to erase the port registry backup tapes.

She\'s a practising paramedic, and HATES separate standards, because
several times her life has depended on partners/firefighters being able to

Mind you, she also supports requalification testing so that once you\'re in

Just remember that the Cr2000 per person carried are all consumables
(Unless you go with the insurance fee/government tax idea). You don\'t
have to pay it on trips where the stateroom is empty. That means things
like rescure balls, survival kits, fire extinguishers, and everything
else that usually isn\'t actually used during a trip, but just has to be
replaced periodically dosen\'t come out of this figure, and it also means
that crew members ought to cost about 50% more than passengers (since
they strain the life support system for 14 days out of 14 while the
average passenger only stretch it for 9 days out of 14). And, finally,
it also means that it is a lot cheaper to restock on some planets than
on others. For instance, if you get your supplies at a Class B, TL 9 
starport it would be about three times cheaper than getting them at a
Class A, TL 15 starport.

You don\'t think much of high technology, do you? You completely miss the
point that if it is a true expense (ie. not just someone with a monopoly
jacking up the price unconciously) then the same apply for artificial
environments everywhere, and it suddenly become more than 15 times as
expensive to live on an airless world or in space as it does on a world
with a breathable atmosphere. Which agrees rather badly with a lot of
background details.

And if the food isn\'t used it can be served to the next passenger.

OK. so it is someone taking advantage of a monopoly to jack up the
price way beyond what is reasonable. well enough. I have no quarrel with
that, or with any other dodge used to increase the cost artificially (IMTU
I use "misjump insurance" to explain the high cost). But here again you
miss the point. This is a campaign-specific feature and certainly dosen\'t
apply to all Traveller universes and most certainly not to all empires in
all TUs (I don\'t even think it belongs in the Imperium of the Official
Traveller Universe; it simply dosen\'t fit with the impression of the free
trade principles I have of the Imperium. I can\'t back it up with any
definitive quotes, so I don\'t want to argue that point). But tell me, do
you really think that something like the ASMS would exist in all the
different interstellar empires of the OTU? I don\'t. Whereas I do believe
that people have to eat and breathe no matter where they are in the 
universe). So shouldn\'t the rules allow the Referee to distinguish between
hard, unavoidable, applies-everywhere-in-the-univers costs like food and
air and artificially inflated costs, so that he can easily adapt the rules
to his own specifications?

require the use and frequent replacement of a vacc suit per passenger and

Others have proposed other ways to inflate the costs of consumables spent on
a starship jump. But all this is besides the point. There\'s no question that
it is _possible_ to spend the equivalent of S$2000/week on the ingredients
for food alone. The point is that they all require some highly artificial
conditions: The monopoly of a galaxy-wide union of starport chandlers or the
use of ultra-luxury food or a government fee (OK, so perhaps they aren\'t all
highly artificial; this one is quite likely with some types of government,
but I still maintain that it is not equally likely with all types of
government). Anyway, the point is the artificiality of it. No one has
proposed any way to account for this cost that cannot be avoided in specific
circumstances. So the rules should allow the Referee to take such specific
circumstances into account and to assess the possible consequenses for the
players. And those circumstance, and the risks involved in circumventing
them, differ markedly according to which pescific explanation there is for
the inflated price (Monopoly: Sneak into town and buy from independent
suppliers; luxury food: tell crew and prospective passengers to eat meat
loaf and like it; insurance: go without; mandatory insurance: cheat on
passenger manifests; mandatory security equipment: bribe the inspector;
government tax: cheat on tax returns, etc. As you can see, it makes a big
difference just what the reason is).

my thinking on passenger carriage a bit.

Originally, both middle and high passengers required single occupancy
in a four-ton stateroom.  Small staterooms or double occupancy could
be used in a few cases:

  * passenger space for insystem trips over a day long on small craft
  * crew space, including working passage; commercial ships were
    encouraged not to do this, but it wasn\'t required (and some of
    the official designs packed crew in this tightly)
  * military personnel, either crew or troops

So routine use of small staterooms for middle passengers wasn\'t allowed
under most circumstances; and high and middle passengers had the same
size staterooms.  Then, as I said yesterday, you can carry five middle
passengers or four high passengers and baggage in twenty disp-tons, and
the life-support cost difference makes outfitting for high passengers
somewhat more attractive.

In addition, low berths only displaced half a ton, not a full ton; and
emergency (livestock) low berths displaced a ton, not two.  This would
explain why low berths are ever used; you can make more money with one
than by hauling freight (kCr (2 - 0.2) versus kCr 1 per ton).  When
was the displacement of low berths changed?

In order for the economic numbers to work, I\'d think that we need to
reduce low berth displacement back to classic Traveller volumes, and
disallow use of small staterooms for middle passengers except when
allowed for high passengers as well.

Random chance says that the number of  right  and  wrong  guesses
should  be  equal  (statistical  flukes  not  withstanding).  PSI
ability would skew this ratio in favour of  more  right  guesses,
the higher the ability the more the ratio is skewed.  But if  the
test subject guesses _wrong_ in all 15 trials what should we take
this to mean?

- - A high PSI ability which is shorting-out somehow  (and  if  so,
  why?)
- - A high negative PSI ability (what is neg-PSI?)
- - Something else (what?)

PS; When I was in the NYCPD academy in 86\' we had blatant sexual

could not. I was harassed about my weight (I was over the charts at 170-175lbs
at 5\'8", but my body fat% was OK) and the women were not. I remember that one
woman could not pull the trigger of her service revolver because of lack of
hand strength. They just gave her a rubber ball to squeeze, and bent over
backwards to get her to pass. This was all part of a settlement with the
Justice Department to increase minority and woman numbers (a laudable goal,
but a terrible way to do it). This of course led to the men having comtempt

BZZZT... What about Low Passengers.  They\'d need the same suit provisions, but their
overhead is only 100cr
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Maybe they wouldn\'t need vacc suits. If I\'m reading the T4 Naval Architecht\'s Manual correctly, Rescue Bays (an emergency airlock intended
for rapid ship evacuation or accepting survivors from another ship) are 
designed with "low berth pass-throughs". There was a CT-era reference 
that escapes me about low-berth passengers being loaded as cargo, and
the low berths shown in the Naval Architecht\'s Manual look very much like
movable sarcophagi. Low berths on the CT 600-tn Subsidized Liner from
_Signal GK_ look the same, as do the berths aboard _Azhanti High Lightning_,
but the berths on a Beowulf Free Trader (DGP\'s Starship Operator\'s Manual)
are shown as built-in bunks...it may depend on tech level or design custom.

These design features seem to indicate that in an emergency situation the
crew will not wake the low berth passengers - they\'re probably safer inside the berths and can be rescued as any vital cargo could be. And in evacuation situations, it\'s probably faster to switch the low berths over to internal batteries and move them out as-is...the alternative is to wake all the sleepers and help
their hibernation-groggy keisters into vacc suits, then help them off the ship.

But flipping a coin isn\'t random, merely difficult to calculate.And the
\'heads\' side of US coins causes them to land head-side down more often than
not due to the additional weight on that side.

And ask it the other way:  what does it mean if subject gets 15 of 15
right?
- - Able to correct predict the outcome?
- - Able to manipulate the outcome psionically?
- - Just damn lucky?
- - Or really good at controlling the flip (especially if you catch it and
slap it on the arm - how do you think I got 10 for 15 when I tried this :-)

In my current CORPS: Traveller game, set in the Lunion subsector in 1106,
the players are starting to get hints of what\'s really going on.  Right
now, they\'ve got a nearly catatonic telepath that they are trying to

Can we scan in the LBB\'s and trade them that way?

Would anyone be willing to scan their books and make them available? There
are a lot of us that are only interested in the contents and not the
collectability. I for one, would be happy with a photocopy version of the
entire LBB series. It is probably the only way I will ever see them.

This would eliminate the need for a CD of the old books.

Also, they could be saved in a PDF format or a GIF format, whatever is
easier. I\'m not sure how well an OCR program would work, but it may work
well. This is what TSR has done with their out-of-print work. They made it
available on their web site.

You mean more than some of the scout \'pilots\' that are roaming around out
there??  There is something seriously twisted about people who get so involved
with their ships that the service prefers to give them to \'em, rather than
separate the team when they retire!  :)

I saw them as working for two weeks (+/-) straight then getting a week or
so off at their "home" planet, or perhaps working the "day shift" 3-4 days
before the next run.  In any case it was a detail that seemed unimportant.

Think so?  Why?  I can\'t remember any CT books that said so, but that\'s not
unusual.

Also, I figure that\'s one area that the X-Boat has the corner on.  You can
use a big-bandwidth laser communicator if you\'re afraid of eavesdroppers,
and zap a few Gazillion Jacobytes of data in no time at all.  (note my
intentional nonuse of real numerical description, I figure the available
technology will keep up with the desired capacity as time goes by).

I\'m sure this is one of those subjects that is not discussed around the
customers....

Frankly,  I would tend to say that when push comes to shove, the corpsicles may
get the short end of the stick.

Consider - the pirate ship has given you 15 minutes to evacuate the ship, 10 of
which you spend convincing the Baroness Liphia that perhaps packing for this
trip is not exactly a necessary thing...are you going to a) get in the shuttle
and live or b) go start the revivification process for the low passengers
and...?

Consider - you have come out of misjump about 400 AUs from the Distant companion
to the target system.  The computer calculates that it will take you 40 days to
transit in normal space - best case lifesupport for you and your passengers is
15 days.  Now, as you look around at the 15 faces of your friends (crewmates)
and the various economically well off merchants and nobles who are your
passengers, you think of the 20 low berths that are, albeit already occupied,
down in steerage...

  Isn\'t resolving the above issue going to be the normal modus operandi
for any J-6 hiusehold ship conducting a mission? Also, rather than have
a noble or NI op try and conduct or arrange the "correction", they would
probably have an automatic, invisible record-adjusting method.

  So, if your Imperial Standard (IISS?) starport traffic control and
records software (I wonder how big that package will be...) detects
an anomaly for a specific, pre-listed ships ID, it may have a routine
to eliminate the anomaly, while perhaps sending a message back to the
sector head office of the relevant concern. Or such a procedure could
be put on hold waiting for a reply from the authorized center, in 
which case the anomaly might have to be concealed by a supposed "glitch"
if someone should look for it too soon.

  Most likely the internal tampering would need to be immediate to avoid
hassles with duplicate records being compared at a later date.

  Actually, NI or the IN may very well have a similar mechanism for
concealing occasions when Intel operatives or Q-ships have to jump
around faster than their public identities are capable of.

  This was another one of my pet peeves regarding the newer ship rules for
traveller universes after CT.  In almost every instance - the revenue
generating volumes were made smaller and smaller (compare Jump 1 Free
traders from system to system by cargo volume, number of staterooms and
cost of ships...).  As the revenue production got smaller, ships that were
marginally economically feasible, no longer were feasible.
  Also, as I tried to tell GDW once upon a time...

  Design a jump 1 ship, a jump 2 ship, and a jump 3 ship - all for the
purpose of creating some free traders.  Then, use the traveller rules as
they are in any incarnation.  I suspect that you will not find any jump 3
ships that will be viable (although with the rules regarding trade with
high tech planets - if there are two planets within jump 3 of each other,
with the rest of the nearest planets being low tech, perhaps the jump 3 can
survive).  All in all, if I may challenge the list to make me eat my words
(and I hope someone can!) prove that a jump 2 or jump 3 ship can compete.

Guidelines:

1) the starship purchaser cannot put down more than 20% as down payment.
2) players must use "Standard" rules, not Home brew rules.
3) the circumstances must not be "unique" based on two specific worlds - in
other       words, the ships must be able to compete Universe wide, not
niche wide.

  Currently, in my universe - revenue is based on both distance and on
time.  A jump 3 ship not only gets the full distance rate, but a time
bonus.  To put it better, a jump 3 ship can jump 3 parsecs in one week,
while a freighter jump 1 has to do it in at least 3 weeks plus refueling
times.  The income generated per cubic meter of volume should not be the
same for both the jump 3 as well as the jump 1 ships.
  In any case, those who do try this "test", good luck in proving me wrong

Are Andor and Candory the Droyne worlds in the Marches?

Wasn\'t there some reference to a march Droyne world (red-zone) being blockaded
by battleships? Makes one wonder what a non-starflight world full of flying
lizards has done to require major fleet combatants overhead...

Dear Diary,

Flicked off the transponder in jump to Treece.  Good pickings 
there, because it\'s near Inthe, which is up-and-coming but
doesn\'t really control its border worlds much.

Some of the liners\' ships have built-in transponders that blink
out an identification string, which can be indexed to a databank
of flight plan histories (if the starport has them).  Must be
quite a string!  Also, some of these new gizmos allows remote
access to the ship\'s central computers, allowing traffic control
to reprogram or even fly in the ships.  They say it\'s for high-
traffic ports and emergencies, but it smells like a military 
thing to me.  At least the Imperium doesn\'t mandate transponders 
at all.

Take Treece.  It gets a few shipments and some cross traffic,
but if nobody blinks Treece Down, nobody cares.  Now Inthe is
a different story.  A little while ago, when the Xboat route
began to go up there, they started up with these transponder
rules and flight regulations, claiming that traffic would get
too dense to be manageable without at least "hello world"
transponders.  And so it goes, with bigger ports having more
restrictions.  If you want to trade at Inthe but don\'t have
a transponder, they make you wait out there at the 100d limit
while service ships manhandle your goods.  That can get
expensive, as well as dangerous for pirates like me.

Then there\'s those military ships.  Sheesh, they broadcast
more information than anybody else, except maybe corporate
ships.  But you can\'t listen in, because it\'s all encrypted
in some funny way.

Me, I\'m happy with a simple blinker.  If I want them to know
I\'m here, I blink.  They can scan me if they\'re really 
interested in my ship, but there are so many small-time
traders just trying to make a living that they don\'t have
time to ping every one of us.  And that\'s why I still have
a job.

Dear Diary,

Did some reading for my First Imperium Impact correspondence 
course.  Apparently they liked nothing better than to sow a
colorful mythology on border worlds.  Take Terra for example:
they apparently planted a colony in Mesopotamia to infiltrate
and influence the natives, who created a pantheon from the
Vilani family names represented by the colonists.  Gilgamesh
himself purportedly visited Ishnapushtim, a minor Vilani
noble who was somehow confused with Deucalion or Noah.  The
records state that Gilgamesh had to proceed through a maze of
TL 1 bureaucracy to even find Ishnapushtim.  And don\'t even
ask about Enkidu or Humbaba!

Dear Diary,

Boy, the groat-feces some people try to fling at me, an honest
pirate, just because I don\'t follow their rules.

Welcome to the 3rd Imperium, the universe\'s greatest interstellar
empire.  As a mega-honking feudal state that can sidestep physics
with things like the Jump drive, they have the power to reduce all
costs of everything to zero if we just redistribute the wealth
evenly and place production in the able hands of the Stewards of
the People.  Heh.

However, this not being a perfect universe.  We have here the
market-run feudal system, complete with with regulation, bureaucracy, 
economics, industrialization, and information systems all mashed
together.

What with all the safety overheads, regulations, purgings, recyclings,
rechargings and refurbishings, running passengers can get pretty
expensive.  Luckily for us pirates, scrimping isn\'t illegal if
you can get away with it, and we can charge a lot less than the
certified traders.  Sure the food\'s a little old, and the water\'s
a little tepid.  The staterooms smell lived-in;  but heck, ye gets
what ye pays for.

Look, the way I see it, I\'m the master of my own game; if I want to
run a cheaper operation, that\'s my problem.  I figure the potential
consequences are worth the risk.  So I sits meself down and decide
what I can, er, cut corners on.  I don\'t tell nobody how to run
their ship;  and I don\'t have to take others\' advice.  Some of us
don\'t go by the rulebook; what can I say?  It\'s always been the case.
That\'s what makes the universe human-habitable: we\'re able to break 
the rules.  Maybe it\'ll catch up with us, or maybe we can outrun it.

Ah, this First Imperium correspondence course is making me wax
philisophic.  Time to pillage!

What I know about the Droyne is that they have wings, and also that they
spread  the human species out through most of the galaxy. That\'s about it.

Could someone please give me a quick explanation of how Droyne (and
Chirpers) look (physically), how they act/think and how their caste system
works?

Since none of my players are TMLers, I\'ll spill the beans.

Andor is the site of the machine that creates the Net and allows jump to
occur.  Buried deep within the planet, the complex maintains the Net
without maitence, although there is a Droyne cult/secret society that tries
to figure out the Machine.

One unintended side effect of the Net is a Siren song drawing sentients
towards the Five Sisters Subsector.  This call, which was first noticed
almost 200,000 years ago, devastated several psionic races living in the
Core.   30,000 years ago, they sent a reply.  The Empress Wave.  The
Templars are aware of the wave\'s approach (there is a Templar telepath on
the Zhodani Core Expidition), and are trying to accelerate their search for
the Ancient Homeworld.

"Vargr", in at least one language.  It\'s pronounceable by them.
There\'s one or two proverbs in DGP\'s _Vilani_and_Vargr_ that
makes this pretty clear.  Coincidentally, it\'s the same word as
"Wolf" in one of the Terran Scandinavian tongues.

dip into\' this book, it doesn\'t draw you in as it looks like a financial
report without the excitement of tables.

1 The Trial. Doug Stewart

Canon breaking effects are minimal ( a confused reference to the Long Night
happening to the 1st Imperium). The scenario is interesting and lets your
players be attorneys/barristers. Not bad at all, but possibly hard to run
on a couple of the players. I like this one\'s idea - different...

2 All the Universe\'s a Stage. 	Doug Stewart

Interesting read, based around the players as a covert ops team on
freighter, posing as entertainers. Unfortunately, it jumps up and down on
canon and rips it up and throws it in the bin...

Problems
- - refers to Ancients as the Droyne - a fact unknown until M1100
- - Set in a sector below Massilia ie Old Expanses ie beyond the limit to
expansion set by Cleon.. but this could be handwaved.
- - Briefly describes a triage system for conquering worlds that seems to
contradict M0\'s economic absorption...
- - The Vrast have FTL coms using Psionics. These are nominally limited to
one light year but there is nothing that prevents a chain of them being set
up. Additionally, the author seems to have confused 1 LY with 1 parsec.
- - The Vrast are noted as being on too much of an equal footing with the
Imperium to absorb.
- - Jump Torpedoes p24 - Say no more.
- - Implication that it takes about two days total  for the torpedo to jump
to the enemy fleet, and for them to return to rescue their scout.
- - Ship control card is messed up in filling out.

Conclusion - The scenario is very weak with respect to canon, but could be
fixed with a few mods. (eg replace the jump torpedo with a message torpedo,
move the sector the adventure is set in to trailing not rimward, have the
fleet in the outer system, make the Vrast a small PE and introduce a
lightspeed delay to Psionics). It\'d be a great scenario then, as the
players get to play actors.

3. The 13th Corban (Doug Stewart)

This is a generally okay adventure, but has more of a Star Wars feel than
Traveller\'s classic and MT material. I\'ve continuing doubts about the
author\'s understanding of Traveller Technology (he refers to adjusting
ship\'s weapons and jump capabilities dependent on the character\'s levels),
but I\'m probably switched on to more minor things thanks to the gaffes in
\'All the Universe\'s a Stage". The other potential canon mistake is a
discussion of \'when Cleon sent archeologists to the ancient ruined palace
of the First Imperium" and inscriptions apparently about a ZS emperor that
are all olde medieval style. Not necessarily impossible but it jars with
everything I\'ve read about the Vilani and leads me to question whether the
author has read M0, even.

Anyway, the plot centres around some precious stones (the Corbans) of great
value that Cleon has become obsessed with. So obsessed with that he has
sent a Baron out to search for it threatening his wife and three daughters
if he doesn\'t find it (just for once it would have been nice to have sent
out the Countess....?) This image of Cleon jars - he\'s absolute ruler of
the 3I yet he doesn\'t send out the Scout service or some military/BIA
agents to get it?

The ship (the Ransom) departs with a really clever device on it - a
tracking beacon that allows the vessel to be followed anywhere by the navy.
Hmm. Can you say FTL commo? Or even the Millenium Falcon leaving the Death
Star? They arrive at the system that the Corban is supposed to be at, and
find the station abandoned, and reports of a liner (wandering the Rim!!!!!)
that may have been destroyed. Anyway friction occurs with up to two other
searching groups and then the scenario moves to the planet below. Anyway,
the players have to find the stone, solve the mystery of the liner and get
back to Sylea alive.

Summary - Space Opera that doesn\'t understand the history or technology of
Traveller.

4. Retian and Juenaire. (Doug Stewart)

I really like this, even though it\'s just Romeo and Juliette in M0. It
plays with honour (do the players help the lovers, or ensure that the
arranged marriage goes ahead?) and gives a nice feudal feel, something that
I feel is more related  to M0. One of the best scenarios in the book. I
can\'t say much more without ruining it.

Summary - Romeo and Juliette in M0 (Swords and Honour).

5. The Princess Clone (Doug Stewart)

This adventure involves the clone of a noblewoman, and the original\'s
attempt to regain her birthrights from an evil and nasty Duke. The scenario
includes a space battle and then a covert approach to a planet (somewhat
unfeasible but very dramatic). It\'s all very exciting, and then comes the
killer blow TL12 (I assume) teleport systems as a key plot device. Exit
Canon stage right. Anyway, the plot races to a conclusion in the depths of
the secret complex...

Summary - It was so much good fun until the teleport systems appeared. I
suspect you could work them out of this scenario, but it\'s a shame no one
resolved this.

6. A Piece of the Action (Doug Stewart)

This adventure is set in the Crab Nebula, which lies somewhere in the M0
Imperium. It involves the Emperor sending the players to investigate tax
losses from the Oasis system,  which stem from a second system hidden in
the nebula, identical to the first but an exact opposite. (Hurrah magic!
Seas where the other system has continents etc). Anyway, apparently all the
players need to do is a 360 deg (!) scan out for 1.5 Light years to find
the system. As Oasis is an Imperial system you\'d think that the Scouts may
have done this previously... Anyway, faced with perils the players get the
opportunity to find the information that Cleon needs to act against the
system and have to escape.

Summary: the exact mirrored systems really blows holes in Traveller\'s
reputation as a hard SF game. And the meeting with Mr LeRoi (Cleon) blows
the mystique. Not good. Saveable with a major rewrite but why spend the
money on a prepackaged adventure?

7. The Gauntlet Cruise (James M Ward)

I approached this with trepidation after the unmitigated rubbish of the
Annililik Run. Unfortunately, justified IMO. The scnario is an AD&D
dungeon. The players are summoned to Hallen World as they are all long lost
relatives of the royal house. They get to carouse with the rest of the
nobility and then run the gauntlet decks (basically something like a SF
Deathtrap Dungeon). Like the Annililik Run, death comes easily.

Summary: The worst scenario in the book. D&D in space.

8. The Khiidkar Incident (MJ Dougherty and NA Frier)

This is the outstanding adventure of the book for me, and the longest (14
pages). It combines politicking, social graces and honour with a murder and
kidnapping plot. The adventure gives a very feudal feeling and the authors
liking of blade weapons comes out in the text ;-) There are detailed npcs,
and the plot is described and clearly outlined. If it suffers from anything
it is that the layout doesn\'t help make the adventure easy to follow if
dipping in quickly for reference. It could be a hard work for a less
skilled npc.

Summary: Politics, honour and intrigue - excellent.

9. Reverse Assimilation (Joseph E Walsh)

This is what happens when you let one of the M0 authors loose in the period
they wrote. You get a dark picture of how the Imperium expands and takes
the problem worlds bypassed until the end of the first century (this is one
of the first supplements to date in line with T4.1\'s draft). The players
have an opportunity to find out (possibly fatally) just how the Imperium
can abuse its position to absorb bypassed, content worlds. The scenario
describes the world and culture in depth, but once again is aimed at the
more experienced referee as there is no real linear plot to lead the
players. There are several detailed npcs. I really like this one two, and
the Khiidkar Incident only just beat this to be my favourite.

Summary - excellent background and plot which could be expanded to be a
campaign on a world. May be hard for a starting referee.

*Summary For Missions of State*

3 good adventures. The rest are average to poor with one dreadful one and
frequent breaches of canon. Coherent presentation but layout makes the book
unattractive to read. 5/10 overall.

The book demonstrates the need for a TL table in T4.1 like the one in the
MT refs companion.

thought I decided that this couldn\'t be done unless the Imperium was bound

metallicity matter (the rest have no planets)  you can make a case that the
effective thickness of the galactic disk is, IIRC, about a 100 parsecs
thick.

This is too think to simply move the existing stars up and down as the
Imperium becomes too narrow side to side.  So that leaves us with the
following possibilities....

1) You come up with some reason why only stars within a disk about 10
parsecs thick have planets.  This is arbitrary, but then all you have to do
is scatter the stars over the 3rd dimension and pull the lateral dimensions
in a bit (and/or add some systems) to keep travel times to the frontier and
system spacing the same.

2) Assume that the disk is 100 parsecs high, but there is a rift above and
below the Imperium (or just on one side if you can put the Imperium at the
top or the bottom of the disk and still have Sol in the right place).

3) Just expand the third dimension to 100 parsecs, keep the distance to the
frontier the same, and expand the number of systems to keep the distance
between systems the same.  The would up the number worlds in the Imperium
by a couple of orders of magnitude.

I\'m curious what people think about these approaches?  Which is better?
Are they an improvement over a 2D background?

The Double Eagle is a highly unusual two-chamber configuration plasma

from the hassles associated with tangled power cords).  The frame is
additionally bulked up to reduce recoil to a manageable level.  Ideally,
the Double Eagle can be fired twice per 5 second combat turn-as a

Dunno. But I can still imagine a starship having some low berths, even at
Cr900 net revenue, if it can normally fill the low berths but normally cant
get enough freight for the space the low berths take up. But thats a pretty
marginal case ...

No, to make the passenger economics rules work we need to allow more
classes (first, second, economy, steerage and frozen) and relate the cost
of the ticket to both class and the distance travelled.

Cargo rates also have to be related to distance, maybe with a fudge factor
for time- or environment-sensitive cargo.

You\'ve obviously never lived in a port city. Go down to the library and
go to the section where they have the newspapers from other cities.
Check the paper for any port city. There\'ll be a section listing ships
arriving, ships departing, and ships in port. 

It\'d *very* hard to supress *that* info. The "newspaper" will have
spread too far, either as physical copies, as printouts, or as stored
data in someone\'s database. 

BTW, I note in other messages where folks are talking about cargo
manifests being part of the "official" data. I think that any such data
will be pretty vague. And speculative cargo (unless it\'s the majority
of the load) likely *won\'t* be listed. 

What the port records will have is what went thru *customs* in both
directions (ie cargo consigned from the ship to the planet, and cargo
from the planet to the ship). They *may* have records of what gets
transferred between ships in the extrality area. But this may be
limited to "4 type-1 cargo containers serial numbers WWW, XXX, YYY and
ZZZ". 

Consider that since the port *is* extra-territorial, any data regarding
transfers between ships will be limited to those the *ships* want to
have on record. There will be a fair amount of that, since it\'ll help
both sides of the transaction *prove* that they turned a specific
container over with seals intact. That\'s important when handing over a
cargo consigned to someplace farther down the line.

But skippers trading speculative cargo will examine the contents of the
container inside the ship that they are getting it from, then put their
seal on it. And not *want* records floating around as that makes it
harder for competitors to figure out what they are carrying (and thus,
what they might have to offer in a deal).

Note that having an unsealed container brought aboard and *then*
inspecting it is considered a dumb thing. You don\'t know *what* might
be in it. 

I\'m assuming that the seals will incorporate something like public kety
technology, so you can be sure that the seal from XYZ shipping on Vland
really *is* their seal, not a fake.

The cargos on the big bulk carriers and megacorp ships will be general
knowledge. Most free traders will be listed as "general cargo".

I suspect that ships will file a flight plan that covers their course
out to wherever they plan to jump from, and then just list where they
are jumping to. 

Due to the variance in jump duration, it won\'t be *that* unusual for a
ship to arrive before word that it was coming. Even on an x-boat route.
Remember, there are going to be ships jumping to worlds *off* the main
routes. They may be the only traffic between those two systems that
*month* or even that *year* for the lower class ports.

Just as in our history it won\'t be *that* hard for a ship to claim to
have been making a run to some out of the way world and actually have
been going elsewhere.

Faking destinations has problems. With A or B ports on the ends of the
run, it\'s pretty much impossible. But the lower the class of the port
the less Imperial contact it has, and the less often its records get
compared with other ports. 

But the big problem is that if you aren\'t really going where you claim,
you don\'t dare advertise for passengers. Which makes you pretty
conspicuous.

I really don\'t see a lot of effort going into reconciling claimed jumps
with actual jumps. It\'ll happen almost by accident between high class
ports on xboat routes. And decline as you move away from the routes, or
the port class goes down.

I resemble that last. More than Once I\'ve had the pleasure of winning
when some jerk tried to pull the "heads I win, tails you lose" bit.
With a quarter, it\'s quite easy to catch the coin in such a way that
when you slap your hand on your arm, it goes *between* the fingers.
That makes it "on edge" and you win.:-)

Good grief, the effects on climate *alone*. And the "slight problems"
with how the heck you get the tectonic plates to move that way...

If it wasn\'t for the fact that I don\'t want to move, I\'d consider
asking for a job as "continuity editor" at IG. Of course, since they
aren\'t going to be producing anything any time soon, they wouldn\'t hire
one.

But a job like that, staffed by someone as knowledgable as we are *and*
a "writer\'s bible" for both the traveller universe and for the
individual Milieus is *obviously* going to be needed before any future
materials are produced.

I\'m sorry, but most of those adventures should never have been
*submitted* with those errors, and if submitted, should have been
returned with explicit instructions to fix the various canon and
science problems.

Back when they still planned to fly some missions from Vandenburg AFB

Please note that it\'s *easier* to do life support for a large station
than for a ship. And even easier for a large colony. Not only do
economies of scale apply, but the sheer *size* of the "biosphere"

You aren\'t going to get away with serving "canned food" to High
passengers. You\'ll be serving them fresh food. Which you can\'t count on
being able to use next trip.

This isn\'t an airliner. It\'s an ocean liner. And that means things like
fresh food for the "first class" passengers. (I just saw an episode of
"Victory Garden" on PBS where for some reason they took a tour of a
cruise ship\'s foood storage. Most impressive.)

When we were working on FF&S2, I tried putting together some info on

As I noted elsewhere the "transmission" technology has *never* matched
the bandwidth of transporting physical media. Be it telegraph versus
shipping ledger books, or a OC-3 link versus Fed-Exing a box of CD-ROMs.

There\'s a *hard* limit on what you can send over that laser link. One
set by phsyical laws, not by technology. And frankly, with *current*
storage systems we could store more than an hour\'s worth of data at
that rate in the space available on an X-boat.  (consider the data that
can be stored on one displacement ton of CD-ROMs!)

You can try using several lasers at different frequencies, but that\'s
limited by various factors. On the other hand, with an optical fiber,
due to media characteristics, you can get a slightly higher data rate
*and* avoid interference between the multiple frequencies. Add in the
ability to use several *dozen* fibers in parallel and you\'ve got the
laser link beat.

So as I said in another post, the laser link/radio link/whatever will
be used to send the equivalent of newspapers and news programs. The
more private stuff will get sent over a multi-fiber cable once the boat
is docked.

    In my campaign, X-boat "pilots" are a bit like lighthouse keepers. The
turnaround time is sufficiently small that allowing for personel transfer
would impact on their efficiency. They only transfer personnel during their
semi-annual maintenence (It is done twice a year since the ships are in
continual use). Then they can get a month off.
    Of course they also collect big bonuses for the duty. Since they are
always short of volunteers there are big cash-incentives for taking on the
duty, cumulative for the number of terms served. Naturally x-boat pilots
tend to be a bit stir crazy, especially when having just come off of duty.
Those who have taken successive terms can sometimes find difficulty
readjusting to reality and become career X-boat pilots. They are mainly
known for their legacies. They make wagaloads of money as the bonuses
cumulate but never use it since they don\'t mix with society. When they
eventually die, having no heirs, they tend to leave their money to a rather
strange unexpected groups.
    I ran a whole group through basic training in the Scout Service. The
big drive during it all was that if you did very well you got assigned into
exploration. If you did not do very well, you got assigned to the X-Boats.
Boy were they motivated.

    One of the background elements of my campaign was an "Immortal" (best
explained in another message) who didn\'t do well enough in Scout training
and got assigned to the X-boats. Becoming terminally bored she played with
the safeties on the emergency low berth and started spending her jump time
in the deep freeze. This, of course, blew all operational and safety
regulations, but she was lucky and didn\'t suffer a fatal thaw before she
was caught. After being repremanded she was sent back for another tour of
X-boat duty. But her body and mind had become so adjusted to the
freeze-thaw cycle that she found she could slip into suspended animation in
jumpspace without the aid of the low berth (the way low berths work is only
party physical in my campaign).
    As her end-of-assignment options come up she keeps selecting "re-enlist
in X-Boat" because it has the biggest cash tag and she feels she could
handle "just one more" tour. Similarly she opts out of down-time for the
cash bonus because she doesn\'t feel she really needs it. Occasionally, when
transferring between ships at maintenence time, she reads her e-mail and
keeps in contact with some friends she graduated with. Eventually she
decides to take time off to attend a get-together party they are planning.
    Only when she arrives at the bar does she realise that 30 years have
passed. At first she doesn\'t believe it, (they think it is a joke, at
first) but checking her bank balance brings her unquestionably back to
reality.

   Cheers,
                       Jo

      Back in the early 80\'s RPI lowered admissions standards for females.
  The loudest screams came from the women already on campus.  They got to
the point of quizing incoming female freshmen about their test scores.

	In Traveller, the point is moot.  Character generation does not make
gender modifications.  
One way to wandwave this (if you feel the need), is minor gene mods.  This
could have been fairly standard for Solomani during their expansion period.
 Make everybody a little tougher, a little stronger.

hand-frigging all sorts of things you are not going to get rifts of any
special significance. They will always be easy enough to get around or jump
through. This is mainly because you can reach a whole lot more jump points
if you are jumping in 3D rather than 2D.

*Indefensible Borders. Again, for the same reasons it is easy to jump
through most low density regions, it is hard to blocade a 3D border (or 2D,
actually :-). It is bad enough in normal 2D traveller with jump-4 ships,
who can jump over your line, but it gets several magnitudes worse in 3D.
Border politics become more of building defended bases you can raid outward
from.

*No sector mains. Even a jump-1 ships has a lot more routes to choose from.
You can get from almost anywhere to anywhere via jump one. You have to
really zap the density way down to stop this happening.

*Related to the above two is that individual words are not that important.
There are almost no pivotal places where important routes, or defenses go
through just one world. There are always alternatives.

*Space is big, really big. There are _lots_ of stars. My players spent
several years (real time) in a less than 5x5x5 cube.

*Anything you want, you got it. Say you are looking for a high tech, low
law planet. Odds are you can find one within 3 or four jumps. Because the
number of systems is so much higher in 3D you can find almost anything you
want right on your doorstep.

Oddly enough, one of the non-problems, that is frequently mentioned as a
problem, was player confusion. My players are some of the most
non-technical around. But, with a chunky text-based software viewer, they
had no problem working where to go, etc, etc. Now they also seldom thought
more than one jump ahead, but...

>I\'m curious what people think about these approaches?  Which is better?
All of them suffer from, more or less, just making the Imperium 2D in a 3D
substrate. There really isn\'t much point in that. When I did it, I kept the
general Imperial history, but dropped the actual details. Since they never
wanted to leave their little 5x5x5 cube, those sort of macro-features
didn\'t matter much.

The fundamental problem with 3D is that, as your jump range increases, you
can get to a whole lot more worlds. One approach to take that I haven\'t
tried is to directly combat this. On a flat world, Jump-1 is one parsec and
reaches 6 other worlds. Jump-2 is two parsecs and reaches 17 worlds (?).
What you could do is define a different jump-metric for your 3D mechanics.
Jump-1 is, say, less that 1 parsec, such that it only reaches the positions
where 6 worlds can be. Jump-2 is 1.something parsecs such that it can only
reach 17 worlds. The distance per jump-factor will cease to be linear, but
there are a lot of physical things like that.
If you want perfect compliance, you probably need to change the planetary
locations to fractions of parsecs.

Cheers,
Jo

Then  perhaps  the  test  at  GenCon   was   being   administered
incorrectly.  Lets say for the sake of argument that you  have  a
\'balanced\' coin being flipped by a disinterested third party.

Evidence of psionic ability.

Again, evidence of psionic ability.

Statistical fluke ... further testing required.

:-)

Incorrectly administered test.



If the test subject has no abilty then he or she will receive  an
even ratio of rights and wrongs (assuming  a  little  statistical
fiction about averages).  Psi rating near zero.

If the test subject has ability then he or  she  will  recieve  a
favourable ratio of rights and wrongs.  Psi ratio above zero.

So does this mean that there is such a thing as negative ability?
(I know its not cannon.)



Possible light-hearted adventure idea:

A number of \'loosers\' and klutzs start to go missing in the local
startown.   A  paranoid  businessman  is  kidnapping   them   and
surrounding himself with  these  people.  He  believes  they  are
unwitting victims of negative Psi and is attempting  to  creating
an anti-psi shield.  One such klutz is the daughter of a visiting
minor noble.  Said noble hires the PCs to  find  and  rescue  his
missing daughter.  (And such a rescue will be  plagued  by  minor
accidents, mishaps, and slap-stick humour!)

Which software are you using?  I found TextBridge did not crash, but was

Obviously greater realism and less of a burden on Suspension of
Disbelief.  That is the main problem with the 10 parsec disk, but
having an arbitrary limit it still has some unrealistic elements.
Even 10 parsec high is a long way from a 2D universe on the
individual system scale.  It is only 2D in the general shape
of the Imperium as a whole.

Doesn\'t getting around depend on the 3rd demension of the rift?  It
if is as high as it is wide, then it won\'t be any easier to get
around.  As to getting through, if the density is almost zero, I
don\'t see why there will be ways through.  Or is it that a density
that low seems unrealistic?

I raises the number of worlds you have to defend.  But the %age
of worlds within certain distance of the border is unchanged
(unless you are pulling in the lateral dimensions of the
Imperium).  I would say that this is more a an arguement
for "filling in" world so that you have the resources to defend
the border area.

This would be if you simply added layers above an below the
existing one (each with the same density of the original
one), right?  If you expanded the vertical, and just moved
the existing stars over the new dimension, the number of
jump 1 routes would decrease.

I think individual worlds are already more important for their

IIRC, the TNE version of Fire, Fusion, and Steel had solar sails as an
alternative sublight drive technology.  I don\'t know if the T4 version
kept those articles or not.  It\'s been a log time since I paged through
it, but Hard Times (MegaTraveller, Digest Group) might also have some
rules for them.  I can dig it up if you\'d like.

I won\'t argue with your figure for the \'effective\' thickness of the

Such a rift would already be detected by Earth astronomers if it existed.

In preparation to move to a 3D universe I did as much reading as I could on
our best guesses for density of habitable planets in our part of the
galaxy. I came to the conclusion that they\'re about 1/10 as common as
Traveller suggests in 2 dimensions: a Traveller Sector (80 x 100 parsecs =
8,000 square parsecs) contains 450-650 habitable systems, but a 20 parsec
cube (8,000 cubic parsecs) should contain only 45-65 AFAIC. There are also
about 300-500 junk systems: multiple stars, red dwarfs, giants etc, that
are are going to be hard up for habitable planets, but are still mostly OK
for wilderness refuelling.

Similarly the average distance between habitable systems in 2D Traveller is
slightly less than 2 parsecs in this part of the galaxy, but I make it just
slightly less than 7 in a 3D one. There will be junk systems in between for
refuelling, but the time to travel from one habited planet to the next
increases markedly. (In fact I wimped out here and increased the ranges for
jump drives, but this is another story).

Why did I do it? Because I have always liked Traveller\'s emphasis on the
hardness of its science. OK so it contains magical devices like jump drives
and gravitics, but it deals with these in a rational, sensible and
\'scientific\' fashion. For me the problem has always been the 2D hex-based
mapping system: I\'ve never been able to reconcile hard science with
interstellar maps you can play \'Ogre\' on (and yes, I was drunk at the
time). 3D mapping is time-consuming and relatively more complicated, but
for me, the results were definitely worthwhile.

    'body' => 'Hi
This makes me sad..
Really does. I am sure everybody remembers when Marc told us all on ther
list that no more products were going to be produced by IG without him
reading them and checking them first. Apparently, he didn´t see Missions
of State either. Now, i must say i didn´t buy the book and probably
won´t now i read the review, as i feel that this poor job in
Canon-Research shouldn´t be rewarded. However i am disappointed that
things like these still happen despite Marc´s promise that they won´t.
Was the Writers List consulted about this book? I think not.

Marc should really start to take charge of the game and supervise IG´s
work. He should take care of stuff like this and send it back to the
writers for reworking until it is right. Mistakes like these ruin the
game for those of us who notice these mistakes (all old-timers, everyone
on the TML, etc.) Some newcomers probably won´t notice, but do we truly
want to see them learning to play Traveller, Imperial Background with
some of these abominations? They will think of FTL-commo as possible,
Ultra-High-TL items as beint TL 12, the Droyne as known as the ancients,
or even exterminated (Anomalies), Jump Torps as possible, Star Wars like
jump travel, among others. In  the end, the Traveller background will be
so inconsistent, it will be no more fun.

I find it a pity that this has happened again and urge marc to fulfill
his promise to control the work of IG or whoever comes after IG. Please
do not let this happen again.

Finally, I must say that i find it a pity that the good adventures
included in the book can´t be had seperately. Had this book been
published in electronic form, one could have read the review and picked
the ones to buy and the ones to forget about. This way, the book will
remain unbought, and the good adventures which Dom mentioned and which I
really would like to see and read and play, will remain unnoticed. I
will not buy the book just for the pearls if the rest is crap.
Period!

I have read that some Psi researchers postulate such negative abilities. It is
an explanation for why the results go _way_ down if a skeptic (someone who
doeas not believe in psi abilities) is involved in the testing.

a lot more work than is warranted, and you will find as I have that it
cannot be done successfully. There are just too many fudges you have to
make. Having said that, if you are willing to make the compromises,
then  by all means go for it.

As has been pointed out to me, defending a border is nigh impossible as
now an enemy has a mutitude of directions to come at you from.

this is a must, and you must be willing to try it as a gaming method in

If I have intepreted this correctly, I would be interested in an outline

In case no one else has answered.

TNE - FF&S (1993 - Mk1, Mod 1 (January 1994)) - page 74, item 7 under
alternate technologies.

The pressure of sunlight on the sail inside the habitable zone of a star
system generates 0.5 kg (0.0005 tonnes)thrust per sq klm of sail. A sq
klm of sail with rigging weighs 0.5 tonnes. The thrust is constant and
free, but you can\'t be in a hurry.

To calculate G-hours thrust generated: divide total mass of spacecraft
including the sail by sail\'s thrust (sg klm area of sail x 0.0005):
gives acceleration needed to achieve 1 G-hour acceleration.
Multiply thrust x 10 if in inner zone, by 0.01 if in outer zone.

TL	Mass	MCr	TL:Tech level of first availability

What fudges? What compromises? The only one I considered important was
losing consistency with the \'geographical\' aspects of the Traveller canon.
And now my campaign setting seems even more \'realistic\' than it did. A fair
trade.

It really depends how you define \'border\'. Certainly even in 2D space, the
border can not possibly be a fortified, bolded hex-edge line with units
stacked up along it. It\'s a kill-zone consisting of isolated stellar
systems floating in space, broader than the ability of the invader to cross
with a single Jump. The invader must establish a bridgehead at at least one
of the border systems to continue the invasion. You meet them at definitie
points on the curve.

A 3D setting merely increases the complexity of the problem, rather than
making it impossible. OK, so you have more border to defend (being
proportional to the square of your radius, rather than to the first power).
But unless your enemy is significantly bigger than you are (in which case
you should really avoid a war with them anyway), they are going to be
restricted in the number of different ways they can come at you. If their
supply lines get too long, you can cut them off at the roots.

The way it works is that launching into an orbit with an inclination
*greater* than your latitude is easy. Going for a lower inclination
requires an inclination change burn, and those are *expensive*.

The limits we run into in the real world are that you also have to
launch in the right *direction* unless you want to make one of those
inclination change burns. And the directions you can launch are limited
by range safety concerns. Cape Kennedy can\'t launch except on paths
that pass over the "cleared" range areas, and that prevents north and
south launch paths. North would go right up the east coast of the US,
*way* too built up to risk anything falling on it. South goes over too
many caribbean islands. 

Vandenberg *can* launch due south. And the Soviet sites have cleared
north or south "downrange" areas.

Because they are *paying* for an individual stateroom. That\'s likely
part of the *legal* definition of High and Middle passages. If you can
get the people in question to agree to share a stateroom, they\'ll want
a *big* cut in the price.

Actually, distance doesn\'t matter as much for jump travel as it does
for other types of travel. What matters is the *cost* of transport,
which varies in a non-linear way with distance. 

You *can* get away with charging a premium for speedier delivery. But a
jump costs much the same regardless of distance. If the destination is
4 parsecs away, a ship with jump 4 or greater can deliver it in one
jump, saving time for the shipper (and the ship!) and one cost. 

For a ship with jump 2 or three, it\'ll take *two* jumps, which means
it\'ll take about 3 times as long, and you\'ll have the cost of *two*
jumps, enough though they may be a bit cheaper. And for a jump 1 ship,
it takes 4 jumps, and 7 weeks (assuming the usual week in jump, week in
port)

So I see prices being more related to the number of jumps required than
the actual distance. And yes, this puts ships with lower jump numbers
at a disadvantage. But it\'s *reasonable* that they\'d be at that sort of
disadvantage.

I expect the advantage to be *partially* compensated for by the faster
ships charging more for their longer jumps. After all the alternative
to paying for one "expensive" jump 4 is 2 jumps with a J2 or J3 ship,
or *four* jumps with a J1 ship.

	I second the recommendation. IIRC correctly, *NASA* took the book

	I ran my brother and some of his friends through this once. They
stopped when they saw the first guard and spent about 45 minutes of
REAL time arguing about what to do next. Getting frustrated (he had
to leave in about 20 minutes), his character stepped out in the hall,
shot at the guard with the stun rifle ... and missed. By the time the
night was over, the party was all badly wounded, but the palace was
leaning way too far to one side, leaking smoke, and losing altitude.

	SSDS was based on FF&S1, before FF&S2. The biggest change from FF&S1
to FF&S2 as far as spacecraft was in the area of hull design. The
configuration factors in FF&S1 were corrected, expanded, and cleaned
up. Structural value modeling was improved, and the speed regime and

spacecraft, aircraft, and grav vehicles.

Sure. No problem. Two people sharing a small stateroom is what I would call
"Coach" travel (or Third Class). Yes, it would be cheaper - at a guess,
around Cr 5-6 000 per ticket, as opposed to Cr8 000 for Middle.

Two people sharing a bunk (aka Steerage or Fourth Class) would be cheaper
yet - around Cr 3500-Cr 4000 per ticket, as opposed to Cr 8000 for a Middle
Passage.

This numbers include the grossly unreasonable (and easily evadeable, using
FFS2) cost of Cr 2000 per jump for "life support". If you reduce it to a
far more reasonable Cr 500, then you get Fourth Class costs down to
Cr2000-2500, and real stress placed on the economic viability of low berths.

Now, take a buisinessman travelling a Jump-1. He earns triple avaerage
wages on his world (i.e. Cr 60 000 a year). The saving on travelling Coach
vs Middle Passage is still about Cr 2500, or two weeks income for this
quite wealthy individual.

Incidentally, the rort you use to evade any legal impediments to offering
Third and Fouth class travel is to sign the person on "working passage" as
Second Assistant Drive Engineer (unqualified). They sleep in a shared
stateroom (legal because they are crew and *nods to Kenji* un-unionised),
and kick back the Cr 4000 to the purser, who shares it out.

Under free market conditions, price will stabilise at the cheapest someone
can do it, given ruling technology, rate of interest and so on. 

The exception is if you have, say, Jump-3 technology monopolised by a
certain group - in this case, freight charges will be based on what it
costs a jump-2 ship to do it, and the owners of jump-3 starships will make
super-profits.

I *think* Hans crunched out the numbers, and found for long-distance trade
jump-3 or -4 was optimal.

Jump-1 freighters get relegated to jumping between adjacent planets.

A side effect of this is the economic effects of jump-1 mains are
negligible, because the vast majority of trade is carried by jump-3 and -4
ships.

Certainly. The price for shipping should be based around the most effecient
solution. If you cant achieve that solution because your equipment isnt up
to it, then you are going to go broke, or accept a radical devaluation in
the book value of your capital equipment.

that is a fudge in my book, and to fit MTU I\'ll have to make similar

Very true, and you were only talking 1 hex, which has potentially 6
sides to be attacked from, albeit limited by the enemy J factor and
surrounding star/world location. A one front assault may be your way,
but if I was so inclined, I think I may feign a frontal attack and kick

muster. I hate losing even to greater odds so am most careful who I pick

I agree again, but if your reference is to circumference, then you are
still in 2D. You have to be concerned for the total area surrounding
the  sphereical volume. Here again the angle of your view to the horizon
throughout 360 dg (less any overlap) will determine how many
observation  points you will require to watch all of the surrounding
space.

You brute you. It sounds as if you only pick on the little guy. Never
understimate your enemy. And if they are larger than you, you would have
to be able to get out of the hex, to be able to get behind, to be able
to cut the lines, all without being noticed ??? In 3D this may be
possible, but in 2D nigh (near) impossible as I said in my post.
 
I say again, it will depend on the DM and his gaming style. I like what

Is it really, though?

I have some problems with this, as it\'s usually used as a handwave to
justify the Imperium sticking to a single TL for centuries while Terra blew
through a couple of them in a matter of about a century.  Note, I\'m not
saying that this is what you\'re doing, just saying that this is part of the
idea that bugs me.

Anyway, in the Aliens draft, it states that about 50% of all humans in the
Imperium are from various minor human races, but it doesn\'t give the
breakdown on Vilani vs. Solomani, but the Vilani obviously have far greater
numbers.  But, in the span of time since the fall of the First Imperium, a
heck of alot can change.  Basically, if you\'re playing as of the start of
the Third Imperium, you\'ve got over 2000 years since the Ziru Sirka fell. 
Furthermore, if you\'re playing as of the late Imperium, then you have 3300
years since the Vilani fell.  In addition, you\'ve had the Long Night, which
served to further distance the Vilani descendants from their original way
of thinking.

It is stated in the entry under the Vilani ("Library Data: N-Z") that
Vilani is now more of a "cultural" labelling given to those who still
retain some of the old ways...

After all, the Solomani, though small in number, have influenced the
Imperium greatly.  The dating system and the language are both Terran in
origin...

However, I disagree with the above statement.  If you use a jump 4 engine
in a ship, and a jump 2 engine in the same ship, it will still get you to
the Jump 2 desitination.  However, the cost of the engines along with the
volume they take up, is not the same as the Jump 2.  As a consequence, to
my way of thinking, this makes the jump more expensive.  To wit, the
revenue generating volume is diminished.  As a result, it drives up the
cost per cubic meter - in direct contradiction to your statement that the
jump costs the same regardless of distance.

By your example, if I understand correctly, that if you have two aircraft,
one designed to fly from San Fransisco to New York in one hop, and the
other one that needs to land at Chicago, refuel, and fly to New York -
that commercial traffic would be expected to charge the exact same price
for air fare regardless of either plane?  This despite the fact that more
of the faster plane\'s internal volume is aviation fuel tanks, larger wing
structure etc?  This despite the fact that the faster plane can carry
fewer passengers than the slower version?

  I strongly disagree with your assessment.  Again, I offer you the gentle
challenge to create three ships, a Jump 1 ship, a jump 2 ship, and a Jump
3 ship.  Presume that you could only raise 20% of the down payment as per
the normal financing rules of TRAVELLER.  From there, prove that the ships
can survive in most "normal" areas of the Traveller imperium, rather than
specialized financially rich "niche" markets.  Ships must be the same
sized, and have the same equipment as each other but for the differing
jump engine, energy plant, and fuel tankage requirements.  I think even
you would have to admit it cannot be done.

  About the only way a faster ship, with the more volume intensive
requirements can survive in an Imperium\'s markets is by charging by
distance with an additional "speed bonus" added on.  The bonus is
essential in order to make the slower jump-1 ships economically viable for
the new "distance" valued commerce rather than time valued commerce...

I reckon that you\'ve got to scratch that by the late 3I, because otherwise
it\'s impossible to justify the TL advantage the 3I has over all its
neighbours. If the 3I was so Vilani in its outlook they wouldn\'t have kept
their TL advantage after the Solomani Rim War. Mind you IM(heretical)O it\'s
quite hard to justify anyway.

Seems as if that would lead to very high PSI Levels by predicting always

>Doesn\'t getting around depend on the 3rd demension of the rift?
    Unless you are going to have areas that you arbitrarily put a density
of 0 to it doesn\'t matter. It depends on how much handwaving you want to
do. For me, I just came up with a continuous, random 3D density function
with various peaks and troughs. Even at a low density (3%) there were still
enough stars that a jump-2 ship could make it through. If you lower it to
1% you can still get through with jump-3.
    If you want Traveller like rifts you just have to say "there are no
stars in the following areas" and define fairly long, high, and moderately
deep areas. It ends up looking quite arbitrary (not that the rifts in
Traveller don\'t look arbitrary! it just sits better in 2D).
    But don\'t take my word for it, try it yourself.

>It raises the number of worlds you have to defend.
It _squares_ the number of worlds you have to defend. Big difference. It
gets worse.
    Imagine a battle between land and sea creatures. The creatures of the
land march up and set a picket up along the shoreline. The creatures of the
sea march up and try for a breakthrough, or to establish a beachhead. In
this sort of area the defenders fall slightly back to create a crescent.
This increases the % of them ships to the enemy (I\'m in the SCA, we do this
in bridge battles with foot soldiers). If the sea creatures are stronger
than the increased defensive force they can break through and hold a bit.
Now they have a segment that they hold but have to defend on three sides.
Heavy going. They have to be 3 times as powerful as their enemy to keep it.
So they try for another beach-head nearby. If they succeed they now
surround the enemy on three sides and can, hopefully close the gap and gain
defenable territory.
  Now, change this to a battle between sea creatures and _air_ creatures.
The border is not the shoreline, but rather the whole surface. True there
is a lot of sea and each bit of the surface has a lot of deep beneath it
that can bubble up troops in support.  All seems the same. But go through a
beachhead scenario as above. When the sea creatures mount their offensive
the air creatures back off to create a dome, the 3D equivalent of a
crescent. But, a dome creates a higher % of attackers to defenders than a
crescent because of 3D mathematics. It will be much harder for the sea
creatures to create a break through. But, say they are really good and do
so. Now they have their little bubble they have captured. But, they are
surrounded on 5 sides, not 3. They have to be _five_ times as powerful as
their enemy to keep it. It gets worse. In the 2D case in order to
consolidate their gain they only had to create a 2nd beachhead and join it.
In the 3D case they must create an addition 3 beachheads (the corners of a
square) and join them all to create defensible territory.
    Now the above though experiment is just done using cubes. If you used
triangles you would get slightly better odds, for true odds you have to
move to spheres. But the math gets too torturous for a Thursday morning and
the end result is the same. Warfare in 3D is MUCH different than in 2D.
    Imperial wise you can pretty much throw away the existing background
for the frontier border wards. Sure you can have the 1st through 5th
frontier war, but none of the material relating to troop movements, etc,
will make sense.

>>*No sector mains.
>If you expanded the vertical, and just moved

You would be flooring your density to almost zero. A very dense area in
Traveller has 50% of the hexes filled. Dragging the same number of stars
over 10 parsecs vertically brings this down to 5%, close to the traveller
density for rift (3%?). That\'s majority playing with the background. I
thought you wanted to avoid that. In any event, traveller is a bit high in
density compared to the real world, but this would be putting way below the
density in the real world. ChView, 3D star viewing program has the latest
released database of stars in it (http://members.nova.org/~sol/chview,
right next to CORE). The most complete data is in the 25LY sphere around
Earth, with 214 stars. It is too early in the morning for me to work out
the average number of stars per cubic parsec that equates to, but someone
out there will work it out. I strongly suspect it is way higher than 5%
which is what your _dense_ areas of the Imperium will become if you do
this.
  In any event, that will reduce _all_ jump routes. Effectively the
Imperium, which is dependant on trade, will fall about because no one can
get anywhere with out  a jump 6 ship. You lose your effective background
again. If you try to correct this by upping the jump distance, you get back
to the position of no sector mains, which is what you set out to get rid
of.

  I have run two 3D campaigns with non-technical players. The first one I
mentioned before. It was Traveller in 3D, using SYSGEN. Roughly the same
densities, linear jump distances. The background was only implemented on
the ground level. I.e. the grav-car and gauss rifle level. The Imperium, in
this setting was this huge, vast empire. No one was really sure how large
it was. The frontier was at least a year from the core and that is one HELL
of a volume. There was another empire (The Holy Terran Confederacy, vaguely
like the Solomani). The border between the two was rather nebulous and
there were frequent minor skirmishes. It was more that in the border region
there was a density function on both sides as they diffused into each
other.
  The second campaign was Bughunters, set in the Real Universe using ChView
and its near-earth database of stars. But starships in Bughunters aren\'t
jump based, they just move through interstellar space like normal space. If
you want to go further, you just bring more provisions and take longer.
Different engines determine speed. This was rather interesting as they were
playing with real stars in real analog 3D (sysgen was still just cubes).
    Anyway, I suggest that you have to give in on your ideals some respect.
Either only make vague use of standard background, or constrain your 3D to
be almost 2D.
    On the other hand, if your desire for 3D is only because there is no
logical explanation for why space is 2D you can always just explain that.
The best reason I\'ve herd on the list in the past 5 years is the one that
says that _jumpspace_ is 2D. The maps we see are not of real space, but
rather of jump space. These stars are really scattered over 3 dimensions
but there is no point mapping it that way because no one travels through
real space interstellar wise.
    If you accept this logic, there are a number of interesting plot
devices you can use. For example, there might be a binary star system where
the two stars are only a few weeks apart at _maneuver_ 6, but are many many
jumps away at _jump_ 6. This gives you a "wormhole" like affect. It would
introduce interesting twists to your communication net. Such places would
be rather rare (to maintain the normal background) but interesting.

But for whoever still is interested in some physical chemistry -

There are two mechanisms that produce a glow-light from special colors:
Phosphorescence and Fluorescence.

Fluorescence is the effect of substances taking light (storing it with the
electrons, as Loren wrote correctly) and emitting it again after chenging
the frequencies via some internal energy conversion. As this happens very
fast, it is only visible when the substance is under light. There is a
special case of UV fluorescence which means that UV light is absorbed and
transformed into visible light. They seem to glow in the dark because our
eyes cannot see all the light, only the fluoresced. You know these paint 
as \'neon inks\' sometimes used at discos. The effect of white clothes
glowing blue in this light also is caused by this.

But now to the second effect, phosphorescence. It works quite like the
first one, but on a larger time scale, i.e. the light is emitted more
slowly, even if the outer light source is removed. This makes a poor light
yield, so there is not even enough light to see any other things than the
painted ones. 

Don\'t confuse this with chemoluminescence, an other mechanism, which is
based in a chemical reaction that produces light instead of heat - refer
to the luciferin and luciferase of fireflies.

I do not know practical examples by now, but if someone is interested, I
could research.

I may be wrong, but I think that submission of this book will have predated
the Writer\'s Lists\' existance. Remember it is one of the books that was
stuck in Canada over Christmas, and the Writers List came online
end-November 97.

I agree that it would have been nice to have had it proof read by someone
who knows Traveller. <terrible feeling of deja vu>

Summary:

Asteroid found on near miss course with  Earth.  Designated  1997
XF11, it should pass  just  under  30,000  miles  from  Earth  on
October 26, 2028.  However, the estimate has a margin of error of
more than 180,000 miles!  The chance of an  actual  collision  is
small, but one is not entirely  out  of  the  question.

An asteroid the size of 1997 XF11 colliding  with  the  Earth  at
more than 17,000 miles an hour would explode with  an  energy  of
about 320,000 megatons of dynamite.  That equals almost 2 million
Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs.

Such an asteroid hitting the ocean  would  create  a  tidal  wave
hundreds of feet high, causing extreme flooding  along  thousands
of miles of coastline.  Where cities stood, there would  be  only
mudflats.

If it struck land it would blast a crater 20 miles across and  so
clog the sky with dust and vapor that the sun would  be  darkened
for weeks, if not months.

Just remeber that this is estimated from a 88-days arc and further
observations are critical. There will be a close encounter, not as close
as in 2028, with the asteroid in 2002, and at this time many telescopes
around the world will be pointing towards it. This should give us a good
estimate for its close approach, and should it come to close there will be
plenty of time for countermeasures.

If the high prices are due to mandatory insurance for
accident/medical/pirates/kidnapping/allergies whatever and that you\'re
required to have them if you want to use the Imperium wide High/Mid/Low
passage system then traders that don\'t pay them will perhaps pay 100 Cr a
week instead (10 Cr / week for LowPssg) but have a real hard time finding
passengers.

I don\'t really see what is wrong with this idea.

No they\'re not. Those taking jump-2 trips are paying slighly more than the
cost of an individual stateroom, those travelling jump-1 is paying far too
much, those travelling jump-3 is paying a bit too little and those
travelling by higher jumps are paying far too little.

Especially since the true cost of a Low Berth is closer to Cr1500 and that
"Fast Berth" costs only slightly more than Low Berth and is completely
safe...

Jump-3 is best followed by jump-2 (_provided_ the route does not require

*Assuming the route is an exact multiple of the jump rating.

Note 1: The prices above was arrived at by designing a number of 600 T ships
(with QSDS1.5) each dedicated to one kind of passengers, ie. a ship with 1 T
of cargo space per passenger and 1 steward per 8 passengers for High
Passengers, another ship with negligible cargo space and 1 steward per 50
passengers for Middle Passengers, a ship with small staterooms for Economy
Passengers, a ship with Low Berths and 1 medic per 20 berths for Low
Passengers, and a ship with bunks only for Steerage Passengers, plus a ship
with cargo hold only for freight. In all cases, except the ships for Steerage
passengers, the design included emergency medical low berths enough to
accomodate a full complement of crew and passengers.

Note 2: I\'ve used my own rules for life support costs and introduced a
"misjump insurance" based on the value of the ship to compensate. As a
result passenger rates are a bit lower and freight rates a bit higher
than official rules would get you.

Jump-1 freighters get relegated to jumping between adjacent planets.

What if a large number of the Jump-1 ships have been completely paid off?
Remember that in TNE, many starships over a century old are still running
*without* access to regular and proper maintenance. If the lost-in-service rate
was low enough for all those Free and Far Traders out there (not to mention
the aging but reliable jump-1 superfreighters) then you might have some
economic viability for low-jump ships. 

Let\'s say you\'re moving lanthanum ore from a low-pop planet to a high-pop
planet. The mines can produce one shipload of ore a week. You have 
enough jump-1 bulk freighters on your paid-off list to have a ship show up
at the mines once a week, and move the lanthanum along a jump-1 main
to the high-pop planet. Once you have the pipeline started, you will have a 
cargo arrive at the high-pop world once a week. Yes, you could do it with
half (or less) as many high-jump freighters, but as long as the item isn\'t
perishable or time-sensitive these slowpokes will be much cheaper.
It would also be less attractive to pirates - they might grab a jump-3 ship
for the drives, would they bother with a jump-1 ship? Not to mention trade
route reliability - lose one of two slow ships, your trade slows down. Lose one
of one fast ships, your trade _stops_.

There\'s a reason coal mines ship their product by train and freighter instead
of by next-day air.

Today\'s Rocky Mountain News, on page 2, has an article from a NY Times
writer discussing an asteroid (1997 XF11) that will probably pass REALLY
close to the earth on Thursday, Oct 26, 2028.  According to the article,
the rock is one mile in diameter (in estimate).  It was discovered in early
December by James Scotti at Kitt Peak.  Refinements of its orbit done
around 3-4 March refined the proximity of its encounter to 30000.  Of
course, the scientists involved stress that these are all estimates right
now, that the asteroid may pass well outside the Moon\'s orbit, or it could
hit Earth.

I suppose relating it to Traveller isn\'t a good idea, since the thread has
been hashed out repeatedly.

Very poor.  SJG\'s Cardboard Heroes, although a neat product, are too 
expensive to produce for the profit generated.  I\'m sure Loren would 
be able to tell you the same.  One thing that is under consideration 
is placng on the SJG website files of cardboard hero artwork, 
collected in 8"x11" sheets. Download, print to cardstock, and cut 
out.  Perhaps we can ask Loren to push for this?

The figures above do not include the 320-ton LHyd drop tankage.  If
drop tanks aren\'t released, her displacement is 1120 tons LHyd (15680
cubic meters), and she is size 9, jump-2 (112 Std/Pc fuel), 1G maneuver, 
and 1.4 power plant.  Jump-3 or higher requires dropping the tankage, 
and the ship may not jump again until the drop tanks are replaced.  
Estimated price of the drop tankage is MCr 0.33 (QSDS has no drop tank 
rules; estimate based on _High Guard_.)

 ----
 
The use of drop tanks for jump fuel was not possible for commercial 
vessels until late in the 1080s.  Prior to that, ships entering jump
were forced to discharge their jump capacitors immediately, or risk 
catastrophic spontaneous discharge similar to black globe overload.
The brief period of safety before discharge and jump entrance were
forced didn\'t allow the ejected tankage to reach enough distance for
the ship to avoid misjump.

Fundamental breakthroughs in long-duration jump capacitor technology
were made in conjunction with Imperial black globe research.  After
the Fourth Frontier War, this technology was declassified and began
to see use in commercial construction at tech levels as low as 13.

Commercial vehicles using drop tanks could be built with smaller and
cheaper jump drives, as those ships did not need to haul empty fuel
tankage through jumpspace.  Tukera Lines immediately saw the economic
advantages possible on their established core routes, and their first
drop tank equipped ships began entering service in the early 1090s.
These ships must operate in well-developed regions due to their need
for drop tank replacement after jumps of over two parsecs.

The "Trimkhana-Brilliance" and her sister ships exemplify the high
capacity passenger liners Tukera operates along the xboat routes.
Up to 200 passengers and 24 crew can be carried in normal operation,
allowing transport of as many as 5000 passengers per year.  In quiet
regions, the ship may be assigned a "line representative".  This is
an extra crew slot filled by Tukera to provide special expertise for
the captain or to be used as a training position for new employees. 

Normally, the ship\'s four socket weapon mounts are installed with
observation bubbles for the recreational use of the passengers.  In 
potentially hazardous areas, they may be replaced with defensive 
armament.  In that case the line representative is replaced with a 
second Command officer, and four gunners are assigned in place of 
middle passengers.  The necessary control equipment is pre-installed 
on the ship\'s bridge.

The "Trimkhana-Brilliance" herself was lost in early 1106 due to a
defective drop tank manufactured by General Products.  She was in the
process of making a three-parsec jump from Regina/Regina to Roup/Regina
with a nearly full load of passengers, when the release mechanism and
emergency explosive bolts on her port inboard tank failed to operate.  
Despite frantic efforts by the crew, they were unable to eject the tank 
before catastrophic failure of the jump capacitors.  One crewmember and 
three passengers out of a complement of 221 survived the explosion.  In
the aftermath, Tukera suspended all high-capacity passenger service to
the Regina subsector until after the Fifth Frontier War.  Service did
continue in the interior, using drop tanks not manufactured by General.

 ----
 
Designer\'s notes.

If you reverse-engineer the ship, you may find it doesn\'t quite add up.
I built it giving all passengers, the Command officer, and the line
representative large staterooms, the rest of the crew small staterooms, 
and by making the assumption that low berths displace 0.5 tons, not 1 ton 
as in QSDS.  If you want strict adherence to QSDS, you get equivalent 
results if the low berths displace one ton and twenty middle passengers
are stuck with small staterooms.  Only enough cargo space is provided 
for high passenger baggage space.

The ship has a full-size bridge, not a flight deck, as would be required
when operating with two Command crew.  All that\'s required to arm the 
liner is the installation of turret sockets; gunner workstations are in 
place.  The large jump drive\'s power requirement means that 218.6 MW are
available for weaponry. 

Economic analysis follows.  It seems doubtful that players could scrape
up enough passengers to keep this ship full, but Tukera Lines is a major
shipping line (and an NPC) and isn\'t necessarily bound by the same rules
as a player\'s tramp freighter.  The somewhat unfair assumption was made
that Tukera can provide drop liners with refined fuel at unrefined cost
by placing a ground-based fuel refinery with the drop tank refurbishment 
facility; these costs aren\'t included, but are probably minor.  (Another
alternative is to reduce middle passengers by two and let the ship have
a 3 ton per hour refinery, but the first arrangement seems more likely.)

I\'d pay for some 25mm heros. (I used to use 15mm, but most of my figure

Anyone out there artistic?  I have (relatively) cheap access to colour

Not sure I agree with these ...

According  to  the  CT  Zhodani  alien  module:  "Zhodani"  is  a
Galanglic  word  meaning  humans   from   Zhdant   (the   Zhodani
homeworld).  It is composed  of  a  contraction  of  the  Zhodani
"Zhdant" and the Galanglic "-ani" suffix.  The "-ani"  suffix  is
"ah-n\' + ee",  but  the  "Zhod"  root   should   follow   Zhodani
pronounciation rules.  "Zh" is pronounced  as  "s"  is  "measure"
(short "sh" sound),  thus  "Zho"  is  pronounced  not  "zoe"  but
"show".  The "a" in "Zhdant"  is  pronounced  like  the  "oc"  in
"lock" ... thus  "Zhdant"  is  pronounced  "sh-don-t".  Therefore
"Zhodani" should be  pronounced  "show darn + ee"  (or  sometimes
"show don + ee").   Zhdant  is  sometimes  written  "Zhodane"  in
Galanglic texts and therefore would be pronounced "show dane".

(I believe this is cannon, but my phonetic use of "-",  "\'",  and
"+" is probably wrong.  Read what I mean, not what I say.)

What is the density in current Traveller rifts?  In the end
mandating near zero density may not be the best possible
solution, but I see it is more realistic than a 2D Galaxy.

Acutally, the difference in what we are talking about
is that you are talking about a sphere.  Since the
Imperium is going to need to be bounded on top and
bottom, I am talking about essetially adding in new layers
bordering on the edge, all of which have the same %age
of border worlds, so the the total %age of border worlds
stays the same.  Since the Imperium is bound top and bottom,
they don\'t have any enemies in that direction.

That is, as far as I can see, the main problem.  You
can\'t move the Imerpiums neighbors into sphere without
changing how they border each other and if you leave the
top and the bottom without neighbors, but with systems,
then you have the problem of why they didn\'t expand
in that direction.  Therefore you need some reason that
the Imperium sits in a disk of available systems that
is of the same general size, or less, as the Imperium.
If you invoke high metalicity stars, this is about a
100 parsec disk.

I\'m not sure that the background is explicitly dependent on the
density (nor would I necessarily go all the way to 5%).  It depends
mostly on the average distance between stars, the travel time
to the border, and the current arrangement of foes without
the ability to expand upward or downward.

Matching what one can see from the Earth is a problem, but
clearly one that a 2D background doesn\'t handle as well.
Either you decide that it is simply a small suspension of
disbelief to ignore matching the current known stars
around Sol than it is to look at the galaxy as 2D or
you invoke limited number planets and assume that most
stars don\'t have planets (either gas giants or ones with
water).

I\'m not sure this doesn\'t have as many holes and you get just making
things 3D....

Don\'t you know?  Piracy can\'t happen in the Traveller Universe.  It has
been proven Conclusivly that there are too many military ships around with
nothing to do but chase down pirates, all of whom know that the pirates are
pirates, and that have the ability to know when the pirate is making his
move, and have such great sensors that they can tell when the pirate
captain is scratching his butt (though the hull of course).  Thus, the
anti-piracy insuarance is a hoax perpetrated by insuarance companies.

  But in a more serious tone:  Manditory insuarance wouldn\'t take into
account whether the stateroom is occupied or not, it would be one fee for
the entire vessel - possibly volume related, but more likely "value"
related.  A 100 displacement tons ship with Jump 4 ship will likely cost
more insurance wise, than a 100 displacement ton jump 1 ship.
  To the best of my knowledge, Modern transportation does not require
medical insurance for it\'s passengers, and even if the Imperium did mandate
it?  It would likely be a cost that would be transfered to the costumer.  

  All in all - I personally would favor the following approach to Economics
for Traveller:

1) figure out the cost to run the ship.  This will be the entire "expenses"
side of the ship\'s operation including the mortgage payments, mandated
imperial expenses, etc...

2) figure out the ship\'s expected revenue generation ability for that
particular planet.  Thus, if you have one star surrounded by 6 stars, but
traffic looks like this:

Star 1: 100% cargo capacity
star 2:  90% cargo capacity
star 3:  10% cargo capacity
star 4:  50% cargo capacity
star 5:  25% cargo capacity
star 6:  33% cargo capacity

 and the ship\'s expenses are such that it costs 800 credits per revenue
generating displacement ton and the ship\'s owner wants to make a 5% profit
over the costs...

Star 1:  840 cr per ton
star 2:  934 cr per ton
star 3: 8400 cr per ton
star 4: 1680 cr per ton
star 5: 3360 cr per ton
star 6: 2520 cr per ton

  As you can see from the above table, the revenue generated from the cargo
must be such that the trade can be sustained or else the ship loses
profitability, and goes bankrupt - which, if there are no other "cargo
carriers" around, would force the shippers to pile up the cargo without
anyone to carry it.
  The corrolary to this "system" is that the value of the cargo must be at
least the cost of the shipping, or must be something that absolutely must
be had at the other end.  An example of this would be foodstuffs.  If star
3 could not grow their own food for some reason, they have no choice but to
buy the food, and ship it at 8400 cr per displacement ton.  Assuming that
there are some 13.5 cubic meters to a displacement ton, we are looking at
an additional (assuming 1 credit equals $2 US) 623 cr cost per cubic meter.
 Thus, if, under the example above, something costs maybe 2 cr per unit,
and you can fit in 100 units per cubic meter - the final cost for that unit
probably should be around 650 cr per unit - which is a 3250% mark up over
it\'s value! (note, I added in another 25 cr cost for things such as local
planetary shipping, warehousing, and retailing)

  Well, this is just a series of "thoughts" unconnected to making such a
system work for Traveller... <grin>

Okay, I\'ll try and explain my comment.

I think that it is fair to assume that most of the minor races within the
bounds of the Ziru Sirka were culturally Vilani, if not genetically. The
Vilani imposed their culture on the worlds absorbed for over 3200 years
before the Terrans tipped them over the precipice and brought the whole
house down in less than 400 years. 3200 years doesn\'t disappear that
quickly. Many of the worlds that survived the Long Night within the bounds
of the old ZS will have fallen back into the old ways (IMO!).

Bear in mind the ZS was bigger than the 3I with a lower technology.
Controlled cultural attitudes held the empire together.

I think that M0 implies that Vilani culture hasn\'t changed significantly,
as does Vilani and Vargr. In addition, most of the early finance for the 3I
will be Vilani, as they have the only megacorp finance house (except for
Zhunastu?).

I agree that the culture will differ from the old ZS (especially with the
Solomani influence) but in the core of the 3I the culture will be Vilani in
much the same way that much of Europe (and argueably North America) has a
legal and cultural framework owing much to the Romans (a mere 1500 years
ago!). The Vilani were around longer, and actively sought an integrated
culture.

>It is stated in the entry under the Vilani ("Library Data: N-Z") that

Yes. And it was the \'cultural\' aspects that I was refering to.

>After all, the Solomani, though small in number, have influenced the

I agree. But not necessarily as deeply as they would like, especially in
the Imperial core. However, I suspect by the Civil War much of the Vilani
influence has gone, except for the region around Vland.

Ok, I thought a really big baseball glove would be the way to go, but then
my friend Douglas thought something in the line of a LaCrosse raquet would
be better, or perhaps a tennis raquet.

[or, we build a *huge* rabbit... Then when they take it inside...no, no
that won\'t work.]

Or, this could all be a big Hiver Plot to see how we, The Human Race, react
under pressure to perform (not very well is probably the correct
conclusion).

Oh, wait, humans came up with Hivers didn\'t they.  That\'s probably not it
then.  I think my reality meter is broken.

Wasn\'t there a whole thread about near c rocks on this list at some point?
Maybe the Pentagon would be interested...

101 Technolgically Elevated Dictators
101 Single Celled Animals

101 TL4- Vacuum Worlds

and so on.

I\'m sure they\'ll be others voluteered without my suggesting it, which I

 You know...if God is about to drop a rock on us - Las "sin city" Vegas may not
necessarily be the best place to be!  :)

Seriously, the timing on this is kinda strange, what with \'asteroid\' (or
whatever it is called) due out shortly.  I imagine there will be a lot of public

Of course it would be passed on to the costumer.  How else do they get

How did you get 20K as the average income?  I have been getting roughly
10K, based on PE and TCS.

Admittedly, we could define a TL 12 hi tech ind planet as the norm, but it
seems like we might be better off with a something a bit more representative.

(IMTU, planets all tend to gravitate within a century to within three tech
levels of the biggest power nearby.  Much more, and the big power scents
competition, while much lower indicates darn little worth sending.)

What it does, is essence, is it makes your universe a lot bigger and/or
everything in it a lot closer together. Is it worth doing? I guess that
depends on what kind of game you\'re looking for. If you\'re satisfied
with flat-maps, stick with them. They\'re a lot easier to conceptualize
and deal with. If you want that hard-science feel, however, then 3d
may be a step worth taking. Jim Cooper recently plugged my 3d-starmap

You can get this from http://members.aol.com/jimvassila in the rpg-software
section of my homepage. The program includes:

   * A real-data starmap of stars within about 50 light years of Earth.
     This is taken from Gliese\'s 3rd catalogue of near stars (with some
     filler added for where the observations seem to drop off, this is
     all documented in help\\fillgal.txt for those who are interested).
     For those who remember the starmap in Traveller-2300, that was based
     on Gliese\'s 2nd catalogue. Hence, the starmap in this program should
     be even more accurate.

   * Extensive discussions on the formulation of a brand new SF-RPG
     universe including a political background, several alien races,
     and even a brief story to help set the stage. This is still very
     much a work-in-progress, and I hope to begin expanding it once
     the new version of Galactic is ready for release. There is even
     a mailing list set up for discussion if you are really interested.
     Email me for further info.

   * As with Galactic, you can attach campaign notes to the various
     star systems on the map. Likewise, you can also attach star system
     maps and world maps.

   * The map scrolls around you as you crawl around it, using the arrow
     keys to move along the x/y-axes and the pgup/pgdn keys to move along
     the z-axis. Hitting the F3 key will allow you to enter a subprogram
     where you can rotate the local vicinity that you are looking at in
     three dimensions, looking at it from any angle you like. Hitting
     the "?" key from just about any map will show you a list of help
     options.

   * Someone asked me if the program can be used to create entirely new
     starmaps. Yes, it can do this. You can create one off-the-cuff,
     telling the program to supply random data, or you can use the
     data file (data\\fillgal\\stars.dat) that was used to create the
     sample map already included with the package, or you can even
     create your own data file and use that instead. You want to
     recreate the Traveller-2300 universe? It wouldn\'t be all that
     difficult (incidentally, Anders Sandberg typed in this data
     a few years back, and I think I still have a copy lurking about
     if anybody wants it).

   * All data files are flat text for easy manual editing. The source
     code for the program and all its subprograms is provided. And, last
     but not least, it\'s public domain. You can mess with it and
     redistribute it however you like. I would ask that you not charge
     money for it, but since it\'s public domain now, I can\'t even stop
     you from doing that. Basically, I\'m relying on people\'s individual
     honesty here.

If you have trouble getting it from my homepage, let me know and I\'ll
send you a copy via email. It\'s also available from Winchell Chung\'s
3d starmapping homepage (http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html).
There you will find lots of other 3d starmapping tools including Jo
Grant\'s ChView (http://members.nova.org/~sol/chview) mentioned here
recently. Aside from Jo\'s code-smithing, this package also contains
some excellent star data courtesy of Ben Lin, who really went to town
when devising this dataset. I also have a really cool proggie called
PC-Space where you basically fly around in 3d. I can email a copy of
this to anyone who\'s interested. Lots of stuff to choose from. Hope
you find the time to check it out... jimv@empirenet.com

Again, I agree. It\'s a matter of what you decide is important. And this
thread has been good for one thing: it\'s made me think harder about 3D
strategy. My campaign is set in a volume which is pretty easy to cross as
there are a preponderance of routes through junk systems. At first glance
this suggests keeping the balance of sector forces in reserve, scattering
SDBs as harrassment forces everywhere, and playing submarines with your war
fleets. Any other ideas?

This would be a *great* idea!  I would hope that SJG would give
permission for individuals to post their own designs to the web like
they currently do for Car Wars Chits.  Villains & Vigilantes (perhaps my
own personal all-time favorite RPG despite some its problems - probably
because of Jeff Dee\'s great artwork) had a similar setup.  Man I love
those things.

Heck, my brother and his best friend are good computer artists and have
created lots of Car Wars chits.  I\'ll ask them about it.  Does anyone
know what the exact dimensions of those cardboard heroes are?  Height,
Width, base size?

Okay, I\'ll try and explain my comment.

I think that it is fair to assume that most of the minor races within the
bounds of the Ziru Sirka were culturally Vilani, if not genetically. The
Vilani imposed their culture on the worlds absorbed for over 3200 years
before the Terrans tipped them over the precipice and brought the whole
house down in less than 400 years. 3200 years doesn\'t disappear that
quickly. Many of the worlds that survived the Long Night within the bounds
of the old ZS will have fallen back into the old ways (IMO!).

Bear in mind the ZS was bigger than the 3I with a lower technology.
Controlled cultural attitudes held the empire together.

I think that M0 implies that Vilani culture hasn\'t changed significantly,
as does Vilani and Vargr. In addition, most of the early finance for the 3I
will be Vilani, as they have the only megacorp finance house (except for
Zhunastu?).

I agree that the culture will differ from the old ZS (especially with the
Solomani influence) but in the core of the 3I the culture will be Vilani in
much the same way that much of Europe (and argueably North America) has a
legal and cultural framework owing much to the Romans (a mere 1500 years
ago!). The Vilani were around longer, and actively sought an integrated
culture.

>It is stated in the entry under the Vilani ("Library Data: N-Z") that

Yes. And it was the \'cultural\' aspects that I was refering to.

I agree. But not necessarily as deeply as they would like, especially in
the Imperial core. However, I suspect by the Civil War much of the Vilani
influence has gone, except for the region around Vland.

2 films soon to be released:

Armagedon:  Bruce Willis and friends fly two shuttles up to mile wide asteroid.
They plan to first drill a hold into asteroid\'s center, then fill it with enough
nuclear weapons to atomize it.  Comes out July 4.

Deep Impact:  A huge asteroid actually impacts (hitting the ocean I think) and
hilarity ensues.  Sometime this summer.

I looked at the Gliese 3 data, about 3,500 stars in 2,500 systems within 25
parsecs of Sol. I think this works out to be a tad less than one star per
40 cubic parsecs. It\'s possible to get around it with J2 but tedious, and
you\'d better lay in a copy of \'War and Peace\' at J1.

Seriously, I don\'t expect that the basic T4.1 will have a vehicle design
system in it... just a set of vehicle cards with statistics, etc. When I get
closer, I will find some way of getting those vehicle stats, perhaps from one
of the availabel systems based on FF&S II.

The decision is not yet made.

	This would save 12+ bytes for most worlds.  The remaining
	worlds would have the additional data as usual.  No biggie.

5. Remove the pesky spaces between PBG and Alliance data.
6. For that matter, remove pesky spaces from Stellar data too.

In summary, if you can reduce world data size by around 25% you\'ve 
reduced your file size by around 25%.

Not that I\'m about to do that, at least now...

In fact, not many people realize this, but Doug actually _is_ the server
for the TML.  Every piece of mail on this list is routed through the phony
MPGN front directly into Doug\'s brain, where it\'s checked for orthodixical
rigor and subliminal messages are implanted to keep the rest of us
performing according to the Plan, and then uploaded back to the \'net.

Leroy Guatney is merely a recurring glitch in the paranoid psychosis
suppression modules.  Likewise, Marc Miller and Loren Wiseman actually

Note that Emperor Zhukov broke the Solomani power at Court by marrying a
Vilanni noblewoman in 666, IIRC.  This indicates that the Imperium up to
that point was dominated by Solomani desended nobility.

This is extremely frightening considering the amount of Dilantin I take

I route several hundred pieces of email a week!)

No offense, but I seriously doubt you pronounce the "s" in "measure" and
and the "sh" in "show" identically.  In every English dialect I\'ve ever
heard or heard about, the former is voiced, and the latter is voiceless.
If you really do pronounce "show" with a voiced initial, please report to
the nearest university department of linguistics and become immortalized in
a long series of academic footnotes and conference papers <G>

Convention Notice and BITS Attendance

British Isles Traveller Support will be running a small stand at
Conpulsion 98 held in Edinburgh, Scotland (details below)

Gm\'s are in short supply and BITS would like to run as many games as
possible.  Although no official tournament is planned we would like to
run demo games of T4 as well as other versions of Traveller

Anyway if you are in the area and can come along to support BITS either
as a player or GM please do so. I can even smile for you as well (A hard
feat even for myself :)) Conpulsion is a fairly new convention so i cant
promise huge attendance but the more the merrier!!!!(hint)

We will also be selling a few copies of the BITS 101 books if you have
trouble getting hold of them.

If would like to join BITS please email the Coordinator Andy Lilly at
A.S.LILLY@NORTEL.CO.UK

Please do not contact me for membership details.  

Please check the attached http for convention details or contact myself
if you plan to turn up to GM.

Hmmm... "Lucifer\'s Hammer", anyone?

it hitting the Baltic Sea? There are bigger seas on this globe, after

I *wanted* to participate in this discussion, but have been having
problems getting to it..if you know what I mean. ;->  Anyway, I agree
with Jim (among others) that shifting from 2d to 3d is going to have a
*big* effect on the game.  Such a big effect, I decided to forgo trying.
I use the "jump map doesn\'t correspond to real space" approach.  

I\'ve been thinking about a tramline style system (Alderman
Drive-Pournelle and Niven). You could use that in a 3d universe and
still keep the number of accessable systems down and have the equivilant
of rifts, chokepoints, mains, etc. I don\'t know how you would *map* this
though, not like the standard Trav map I don\'t think. Any ideas?

   Top Ten Spots I\'d Like to See the Asteroid Hit If It Were Coming *Tomorrow*

10) My ex-boss\' house.

9)  Iraq (defy these sanctions Sadaam!)

8)  EuroDisney (once again, I must apologize...)

7)  New York City (setting up that classic Charlton Heston scene in "Planet
of the Apes" with the Statue of Liberty)

6)  Anywhere within 5 ft. of Bill Clinton, preferably while he is "training"
a new intern.

5)  Moscow, Bejing or Paris (negotiate with Sadaam, right!)

4)  Dennis Rodman\'s house (he would turn it into a fashion statement)

3)  The "parallel Earth" depicted in bad 1950s sci-fi movies

2)  Bill Gates\' house (he would turn it into a design feature)

1)  Los Angeles (for more reasons than I can count, ideally with Beverly
Hills as "ground zero"...)

Very poor.  SJG\'s Cardboard Heroes, although a neat product, are too 
expensive to produce for the profit generated.  I\'m sure Loren would 
be able to tell you the same.  One thing that is under consideration 
is placng on the SJG website files of cardboard hero artwork, 
collected in 8"x11" sheets. Download, print to cardstock, and cut 
out.  Perhaps we can ask Loren to push for this?

	"Hard Times" mentioned that it was standard in the wilds to

	a ship launches or exits jump space. Exeptions are the "kickback"

Glenn Hoppe is the V.C.P. in question; last I remember hearing, the font
was up on his website:
   <http:\\\\www.geocities.com\\Area51\\8275\\Bilanidin.sit> (Mac TrueType)
   <http:\\\\www.geocities.com\\Area51\\8275\\bilani.zip> (PC TrueType)

I don\'t know if this is still current... the versions above were _drafts_,
not final editions; IIRC they had only symbol assignments for the lowercase
letters a-z.  We discussed on TravLang a bit about how to use it to write
Vilani, as opposed to Galanglic words... I\'m not sure where further work on
the script has progressed.  And I\'m not sure I\'d tell a blatant robot clone
imposter, either... not that I\'m pointing any fingers at anyone.

	Ghostscript is also available for MacWinDummies, so give it a try

Apparently, not. I have tried the above address, and then followed a
painstaking route to Glenn\'s home page, but no luck. The server just
blinked at me and the site contains no link to a font file that I could
see. Glenn are you out there?

<Sounds of general agreement.>

With that excellent review, I have decided to act upon one of my desires
for the Not-the-IG Website.
I would like to add comments and reviews of IG products.  For each
product, a page of comments from the TML about the products strengths,
weaknesses, usefulness, and compatibility with canon, as well as a general
rating (from *must have* to *avoid like the plague*.)

Why open such a can of worms?

One reason:
1) To provide a resource for people new to Traveller or T4.  

A series of reviews/ratings of the IG products would give new players an
idea of which books they might need or want, and would also prepare them
for those products that give you that not-so-fresh feeling.

What I would like:

More things like the review above!  If you would like to write a review,
or just rate the IG products that you have, please email me with your
thoughts.  

Thanks!

According to MT\'s _Imperial Encyclopedia_ it was in 679. Note that Terra
had been incorporated in 588, and the Solomani Confederation was
established in 871. They were reintergrated into the Imperium in 950. The
Solomani Rim War started in 990 and finished in 1002.

IMO Solomani influence dates from the joining of Terra and the 3I.

Yep, these are fully printable versions. I have no problem printing them on a HP
DJ-670c (my 660c died the other week, but it printed on them, too). If any pages
do not print for *your*, I can even fiddle with the illustrations and see if I
can get them to ... or simply mail a copy of the offending page.

Sure. I see this as the point that the political power of the Solomani
nobles was broken. IMO [and being a pro-Solomani Activist doesn\'t mean I
like it ;-) ] the underlying Imperial culture was Vilani in a lot of the M0
core regions. The Solomani were a distinct group, mixed in better in some
areas than others.

   Top Ten Spots I\'d Like to See the Asteroid Hit If It Were Coming *Tomorrow*

10) My ex-boss\' house.

9)  Iraq (defy these sanctions Sadaam!)

8)  EuroDisney (once again, I must apologize...)

7)  New York City (setting up that classic Charlton Heston scene in "Planet
of the Apes" with the Statue of Liberty)

6)  Anywhere within 5 ft. of Bill Clinton, preferably while he is "training"
a new intern.

5)  Moscow, Bejing or Paris (negotiate with Sadaam, right!)

4)  Dennis Rodman\'s house (he would turn it into a fashion statement)

3)  The "parallel Earth" depicted in bad 1950s sci-fi movies

2)  Bill Gates\' house (he would turn it into a design feature)

1)  Los Angeles (for more reasons than I can count, ideally with Beverly
Hills as "ground zero"...)

Jump-1 freighters get relegated to jumping between adjacent planets.

What if a large number of the Jump-1 ships have been completely paid off?
Remember that in TNE, many starships over a century old are still running
*without* access to regular and proper maintenance. If the lost-in-service rate
was low enough for all those Free and Far Traders out there (not to mention
the aging but reliable jump-1 superfreighters) then you might have some
economic viability for low-jump ships. 

Let\'s say you\'re moving lanthanum ore from a low-pop planet to a high-pop
planet. The mines can produce one shipload of ore a week. You have 
enough jump-1 bulk freighters on your paid-off list to have a ship show up
at the mines once a week, and move the lanthanum along a jump-1 main
to the high-pop planet. Once you have the pipeline started, you will have a 
cargo arrive at the high-pop world once a week. Yes, you could do it with
half (or less) as many high-jump freighters, but as long as the item isn\'t
perishable or time-sensitive these slowpokes will be much cheaper.
It would also be less attractive to pirates - they might grab a jump-3 ship
for the drives, would they bother with a jump-1 ship? Not to mention trade
route reliability - lose one of two slow ships, your trade slows down. Lose one
of one fast ships, your trade _stops_.

There\'s a reason coal mines ship their product by train and freighter instead
of by next-day air.

Hmmmm... I remember that the Zhodani in the Frontier Wars were called the
\'Joes\' by Imperial People. (TNE Source, \'Reasons to hate the Joes\').

Okay Loren.. but I got this direct from Steve himself while working 
the booth at GenCon last year (TOLD you I was a MiB).  The Cardboard 
Heroes, and the Car Wars City Blocks, while neat, aren\'t profitable 
enough per unit. thus, while not officially permanently out of print, 
they are not likely to be printed again. 

However, with the proliferation of Colour laser and inkjet printers, 
it should be possible to produce sheets of the original Cardboard 
Heroes, and possibly new ones as PDF or GIF files.  Such files could 
be provided as a free download to subscribers to the electronic 
version of Pyramid, and as a download for pay to all other users. 

The cost of setting up the new sheets would be art and layout only, 
no printing. Reprint sheets would have only the cost of layout. 
Costs of distribution and printing are borne directly by the 
customer, thanks to the net.  Indeed, if available to download from 
the pages of Pyramid Online, they\'re the direct descendant of the 
black and white Cardboard Heroes that were included as a bonus on the 
counter-weight to the subscripion card in two issues of the Space 
Gamer.

This might be a way both to get Cardboard heroes back into 
circulation, and a sales tool for Pyramid Online. Something that the 
paper version of Pyramid cannot, and will not, have.

Actually, Imperial epithets for Zhodani  include  "zho",  "joes",
"donny", "lank", and "punks".  Also "sike" or "psike".
(Source: JTAS9)

I always thought the "Joes" term was like the US  military  slang
"Charlie" for the VC in the Vietnam War.  (But you may be right.)

Wot you mean?  I speak real proper I do!  :-^

Okay, okay ... but cannon is the the Zhodani pronounce "Zh"  like
the "s" in "measure" (however you say that!), they pronounce  "o"
like the "o" in "lock", and they pronounce the "d" like  the  "d"
in "doll".  (Source: CT Alien Module 4)  This gives you ...

Zhodani: mea"s"ure + l"o"ck + "d"oll + "ah-n\' + ee"

Now how do you represent the "s" in "measure" in ASCII?

Its been a while.  Is 25mm scale 1 meter = 25 mm?

Bloo

25mm scale means a figure representing an "average human"
will be 25mm tall. Most of the "25mm" figures on the market today 
(especially Games Workshop\'s Warhammer/Warhammer 40K stuff)
call themselves 25mm but are actually closer to 28mm or 30mm - it made
the Warhammer stuff look more impressive compared to other people\'s
stuff on game tables.

No, it indicates that the power elite were Solomani. The masses of the 
Imperium would have been mostly Vilani. There was a lot of intermariage 
and some Vilani families even changed their names and lifestyles to
become "Solomani-ized". But given that the Vilani lifespan is easily 
50% longer than the Solomani lifespan, that they\'ve been breeding
across hundreds of worlds for thouands opf years longer than the 
Solomani and that we\'ve no data to tell us that their birth rates
are any lower than Solomani birth rates (ever wonder what drove the
Vilani to the stars? 50% longer lifespan with the same birth rate
might just do it), I think it\'s a safe bet that in M0 almost everyone
is of possibly mixed) Vilani descent and that that remains true up until
the late 3I.

It was probably a situation similar to Europe in the late 19th Century.  A
small group (the various interelated royal families) ruled over much larger
populations with who they had very little in common.  Didn\'t England have a
King (one of the Georges?) who couldn\'t speak English?

An aggresive, Solomani dominated nobility might have resited the retaking
of Terra out of a simple fear that the homeworld might upstage their
standing.

Just to let you know, I\'m changing my bookmarks to direct people to the

I went out there the other day, and somebody is still doing work on some

What the hell is going on with these people?  From what i can tell, they

In the two most commonly used ASCII adaptations of the IPA, the character
used for your voiced alveopalatal grooved fricative phoneme is Z.  Vowels
are tricky cross-dialectically in English, but the "o" seems to be a sort
of open mid back rounded critter -- O in ASCII IPA.  Hence, something like
/ZOdani/.

IIRC, there\'s a link to one ASCII IPA chart on the Travlang website:
 <http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Chamber/2662/TLDL.html> under "RESOURCES"

Paul Roser was working on analyzing/cooking up the phonologies of K\'kree,
Trokh, and "Common Vargr", but I don\'t know how far he got...  before
insanity set in, or the Templars got him.

I\'m concidering them as more of a genaric product at this point, not just
Traveller specific.

In most cases there would be 4+ sheets of plans in the package, printed on
11 x 17, 20 lb. (maybe slightly heavier) paper, a discription sheet, a
visual

stand up very well if covered with clear lamination (you know the stick back

Is it perhaps possible that NASA already knows it\'s likely to hit Earth...and
is suppressing the info to avoid panic?  I remember many long discussions on
the subject of evacuating cities in the event of nuclear war...there were
proponents for evacuating and against it; both sides had legitimate points.

just keeping the info secret?  Someone call Oliver Stone...:-)

 hmmm...

The asteroid is reported by independant sources, with the caveat that more
precise orbital information will require a longer period of study...

The JPL comes out later that same day and reports the \'roid will not hit
Earth...

Last week it was reported that significant water does indeed exist on the moon -
renewed interest in Lunar colonies after *supposedly* ignoring the moon for 25
years...

The Martian Explorer mission declared officially over weeks after the last
*reported* contact with the probe...

 But will the TML be satisfied with anything less than a direct hit on Redmond?

Not entirely true.  If 50% of the citizens of the Third Imperium are
members of minor human races, then the majority would not be Vilani, at
least not racially, and probably not culturally.  Remember, there was a
Second Imperium and a Long Night between the Ziru Sirka and Cleon\'s
Imperium.  In some cases, the Vilani-influenced cultures would branch and
change, in other cases they\'d probably go back to living with their own,
old, submerged culture.

By the time of the Third Imperium, you\'d have all kinds of zany cultures
and situations around, and the homogeny of the Ziru Sirka will all but have
vanished.

As Dom said, I believe, the roots of the Western mode of thinking can be
traced back to the Romans, but nobody in the west lives exactly as the
Romans did.  Various cultures have branched off and exist and the
differences in the cultures can be downright amazing.  And that\'s only on
one planet!

The Grand Empire of the Stars takes to the stars, they deposit people on a
number of planets, and find people on others.  Vilani culture is imposed on
them, whether they like it or not.  The Ziru Sirka collapses, and the
Terrans now rule.  They impose their own cultural ideals over the ancient
Vilani ones.  Now, the Ramshackle Empire collapses, and interstellar trade
and travel begins to trickle to almost nothing.  Pocket Empires, with their
own agendas and cultural ideals spring up, some planets are left to
themselves, some worlds die off entirely.  Then you have the Third
Imperium, with a "hands off" policy towards individual member worlds.  That
is to say, they force very few Imperial standards on the populations of
their member worlds.

What this means:  The further out from Vland, the less likely that the
citizens will act like Vilani.  It doesn\'t mean that they\'ll act like
Solomani, just means that they\'ll act less and less like Vilani.  Their
language will possibly have Vilani roots, but, it will probably sound
considerably different.  Individual worlds will be different, and mostly
unique.  The cornerstone of Vilani culture, the shugili, will be no longer
as strongly needed, or the role will change considerably.  Child rearing
and family situations may be similar, but many worlds will have
differences, some subtle, and some drastic.

By the time of the late Imperium (for the sake of argument) a certain
amount of standardization has taken place as a result of trade throughout
the Imperium.  The Third Imperium will use the Office of Calendar
Compliance to set certain standards (power cords, data interchange formats,
etc.) so that general efficiency is increased.  Megacorporations will
create other standards, culturally and technologically. Individual member
worlds will still have their own cultures and quirks, but they will be set
against a backdrop of homogenized Impie culture.

   Did it prevent a war, or merely delay it, ensuring that when it does
happen, it will be even bigger and nastier than it would have been otherwise?  

   I\'m also unclear when the best time would be to stop Sadaam, before or
after some his his minions use biological weapons on a major city (perhaps
even in Europe), killing hundreds of thousands or even millions...

   No, the governments of France, Russia and the People\'s Republic of China
are merely trying to keep a good customer around by advocating appeasement.
Were it not for Sadaam\'s various purchases from these countries (many since
the Gulf War), they could care less if Iraq were turned into a glass parking
lot by the US.

Ken Whitman.. Formerly with Imperium Games. Who also requested that
customers pre-order their products.

Imperium Games is now "catching their breath" from publishing so many
traveller products in such a short while. However, many of the writers
who did work for their magazine, cancelled afer two issues, are being
asked to take payment of 10% of what was originally to be paid to
them.   Many Imperium Games customers were chaged for product long
before it shipped to them.  Some were billed for proucts that never
arrived, or, indeed, have not yet been printed.

Just a note. It\'s illegal to process a credit card order for a product
unless it is immediately shipped. In short, Archangel\'s plan to
process before the product ships by 30 days is against the law.

There were a lot of complaints about Imperium Games\' business
practices with respect to credit cards.. and now it looks like Ken is
repeating the cycle with Archangel.

I begin to feel very uncomfortable with this "offer" and suggest that
you wait until the product is Shipping to purchase it.

Nah!  NASA probably already knows it *won\'t* hit Earth and is suppressing
that info.  Why?  Just think of the boost in funding if enough taxpayers
get worried about rocks falling on their heads and start complaining about
itto their Congresscritters!  NASA will do just about anything to keep the
green milk flowing from the government\'s tit. ;->

Say, did you hear the arguement yesterday between NASA and the DOD over who
would be in charge of "doing something about the asteriod."  A DOD
spokes-dweeb said is was NASA\'s responsibility because it was in space and
a NASA flack replied that while they would study and investigate the
phenomenon a mile wide rock striking the Earth was surely a Defense matter.
Hee! Hee!

I think it would be a good idea, but rather than print them out they would
be, IMO, more useful as electronic publications. Say as .pdf files on 3.5"
disks if not over the net. Less overhead for you too (which, theoretically
at least, means a higher profit margin). Of course, there is that piracy
thing -- but if people really want to pirate them, they could just scan the
images to replicate them anyay.

The example concerned a darn rich, late-Empire world. For worlds with ICr
5-8 000 (far more \'normal\'), our businessman would have to be even more
wealthy, relativly speaking (an income of 60 000 a year implies wealth of
around MCr 2, assuming a 3% rate of interest).

That\'s really looooong range planning -- thirty years ahead is way far
in the future for an American organization.  Who knows how technology
will change in thirty years, anyway -- this might not be a real problem
by then.  Anyway, I\'ll be 70 years old by Halloween 2028, so whatever
with the rock.

OK. What we are talking about is the second thing I said - you would get a
reduction in the "book value" of the ships. Rather than saying "Dammit,
this ship cost us MCr60, so thats what it\'s worth", you say "Ah well. This
ship cost us MCr 60, but it takes three times as long to carry the cargo to
the marketworld, so it only makes 15 runs a year, so it is really worth
MCr20. We need to notify the shareholders of the MCr 40 markdown in our net
worth".

The core guy to read on this sort of stuff IMO is Sraffa, incidentally.

Will it be cheaper to use, say, three Jump-1 ships rather than one jump-3
ship that does the run in one-third the time ?

Certainly, if you are using obsolete ships you already own, but over time
these will fall apart and be replaced by more modern, high-jump ships. Once
this happens, and you have to outlay hard cash for a new ship, I think the
economically sensible thing is to bite the bullet and buy a fast freighter.

The piracy issue is IMO very very marginal - for a start, piracy will be
about as common in the 3I as it is today. For seconds, the bigger power
plant required by the jump-3 drive gives you a nice big chunky power
surplus over what your 1G drive requires, which can easily be used for
weapons. Jump-1/1G ships have a less impressive power curve, and thus have
to either dedicate space and mass to batteries to provide combat power, or
purchase a bigger power plant than required.

Thats related to the radically lower cost of rail and sea freight vis a vis
air freight. The cost differential between jump-1 and jump-4 ships isnt
anywhere near as extreme.

No one can tell for sure, but one thing we do see over here in europe,
is that the US government was a bit over the top here. I don´t know what
your "news" said, but the danger wasn´t seen as big over here. The
general opinion was that the palaces were probably no hideaways for
chemical weapons, or couldn´t be and that if Saddam had any, they would
be someplace else. Rather the general feeling was that this was just a
pretext. Now i won´t say that your president was trigger-happy, but it
did seem a tad too convenient, didn´t it? Just when he has problems at
home, distract the public. Most Europeans felt that this crisis wasn´t
about Saddam H., but about pres. Clintons inability to secure his
homefront otherwise. As i recall, even a large part of the US-public
felt that way (see: CNN/US Govt - PR-Disaster).

Why? Just because he has the weapons doesn´t necessarily mean he´ll use
them. You have weapons like these, even worse, as well. So what? Do we
need to strike down upon the US to force them to destroy those weapons?

Or they are just trying to promote peace, or at least let the diplomats
have a go first, which proved to work, at least for now. UN-demands were
fulfilled, so there was no reason for a strike anymore. Period!

Nope. The US cares less. We are practically neigbours, we have an
imminent desire for peace in that region, for increased turmoil will
worsen the refugee situation and cause trouble for us. You won´t fell
much of that, but we will. We also can´t risk Saddam becoming a martyr
for the fundamentalists, because that would mean even more danger for
our interests. When you were planning the strike, Iran and Iraq started
to find their similarities and started to form a relationship. THAT
scared the shit out of us! An attack by the US (and it would have been a
US-operation, no matter what they would have claimed) would have
worsened that situation as well.

Would reducing the scale to 15mm (as some have suggested) solve this
problem?

IMO,
I might pay for pre-printed deck plans, depending on their cost and quality.
However, with printing costs what they are these days, I am afraid the items
would be priced at more than I would be willing to spend. I just cannot
force myself to shell out $20+ US for Emperor\'s Arsenal, for example (I have
not bought any IG products, even the reportedly good stuff, because of their
pricing).

Anyway, I like the idea of electronic deck plans because with Illustrator or
Photoshop I can resize them or alter them any way I want. But that\'s just my
\'ferinstance. :-)

Again, I agree. It\'s a matter of what you decide is important. And this
thread has been good for one thing: it\'s made me think harder about 3D
strategy. My campaign is set in a volume which is pretty easy to cross as
there are a preponderance of routes through junk systems. At first glance
this suggests keeping the balance of sector forces in reserve, scattering
SDBs as harrassment forces everywhere, and playing submarines with your war
fleets. Any other ideas?

Volker, 
     
     Have you any evidence that the US has ever used a biological agent
against anyone?  Saddam Hussien has repeatedly...and against his own people,
at that.  
Over here, we don\'t generally let convicted felons carry guns...which doesn\'t
aways stop them from doing so, granted;  but the penalties are very harsh
indeed for doing so.  Saddam has demonstrated he can\'t be trusted to play
nice...so it\'s time to take his toys away from him and send him to his room
(Iraq) until he can be a good boy.

I know that and wasn´t implying any similarities (Although you did use
nukes, napalm, and other anti-civilian weapons in your time, but leave
that out for now).
However this wasn´t about guns or chem-weaps. It was about the Prez´s
private bedroom manners, and that is what stank about this affair. There
was no prrof that he had his weapons in these buildings, yet the US were
willing to go to war over that.

Better letting him have his toys than having a new martyr. The lesser of
two evils is still an evil, but better than a worse one.
Anyway this isn´t about playing nice, this is about power. The us has
the power to make iraq regret anything they do, they´d be stupid to try
anything. On the other hand, nothing is done when in china, peaceful
protestors are rolled down by tanks, no liberation forces try to free
tibet. You are using one measurement here and another there. Hussein was
one of the closest allies to the us not 15 years back, with the very
same proactices on his side. Only then, it was in the US´s interest to
keep him in power. You build him up, but you can´t destroy him. 
Anything you try against Saddam will only hurt the civilian population,
in the long run. That is why war is no real solution to this problem,
but diplomacy was!
I am not defending Hussein here, i am just saying that France and Russia
were right in favoring a peaceful settlement.

Yes; but you\'ll notice that the list didn\'t "mysteriously crash" again when
I posted it, and then come back up with certain list members showing
peculiar _changes_...

You all realize, of course, that it\'s not the Templars or NASA or the
Gnomes of Zurich who are actually manipulating Terran history towards
eventual interstellar dominance -- it\'s the International Phonetic Alphabet
cabal.  For the last 120 years the best minds in the Western world have
been fine-tuning a qabbalistic reactionless jump-drive-based form of Virus,
disguised as a phonological notation system... also handy for teaching
loathsome diabolical chants and incantations to naive aliens...

worried that there was place where people could actually answer that question

of the wackier stuff we do around here.  I figure to disillusion her gently
STS!  But onto the subject...!

    I just saw that film, "The Advocate" is the title I believe, about the
lawyer in Dark Ages France who has to defend a pig in a court of law.  That
first scene where they\'re about to hang a man and a cow and the villagers get
the cow off and they go ahead and hang the man is going to be appearing in my
campaign shortly!  But I thought I\'d ask the lawyers on the list if they know
when the practice of holding animals liable before the law ended?  And what the
legal justification for it was?

    In Traveller it makes a strange kind of sense because any low tech society
with a spaceport on the planet is going to have a fair number of aliens passing
through to astound the locals.  You can just imagine the impact of a couple of
K\'kree passing through on a herding culture.  Especially in the herdsmen got an
earful of the K\'kree on meat eaters!  You can just imagine the suspicion and
paranoia such a visit would have culturally on these folks the next time they
took a look at their herds!
    But this sort of thing would make for some great local color if someone
wants to use it.  After all it\'s Traveller!  The next planet over is supposed
to be strangely different. ;)

related topics.  The moment we get into Politics and/or religion, we are
straying from the topic matter, and wandering into emotionally divisive
grounds.

  Personally, I find comments regarding CNN\'s existance as a propoganda
organ for the United states offensive.  However, the people of this list
are entitled to their own opinions, so I won\'t argue that.  However, I do
ask that others refrain from continually pressing on with this kind of

because it has the potential to stir up some ugly feelings, and *that* is

  With respect towards dealing with patrolling 3D, one thought that occurs
to me is to place the crew in low berths or on FAST drug, and then
powering down.  Have the main patrol craft stand patrol, or even have an
automated system do the "patroling".  Then, the semi-mothballed ships with
crews on them, can come to life and start to nail enemy ships at times
that are advantageous.  This would reduce the cost of patroling perhaps?

My email address is linked to that website as \'Trav Chat

from people who can\'t connect to IG\'s Chat Server. Unfortunately, I 
never hear from them again after I politely explain that we\'ve moved

maps to the Sol Rim. Has anyone done write-ups for any of the worlds? I
can\'t find much information on the Vegan\'s.

I am thinking about making a spy/espionage type campaign. The characters may
be ISS agents (Imperial Secret Service) (if you\'ve never heard about the
ISS, then their doing their job well)  :)  The characters may be independent
agents working for the imperial government. Missions would include
excursions into Solomani Space.

Anything would be helpful. I\'m not sure what is in the Alien Module:
Solomani. Is there anything interesting I might in there? Anyone have this

If the insurance is mandatory, then it is required by the *government*.
Which means that those traders not paying are breaking the law. And in
a quite obvious manner, as the payments would have to be registered
*before* the ship left. 

Mind you, this would also require *far* too much tracking of
passengers. 

On the other hand, it\'s also possible that the insurance is mandatory,
but as with mandatory collision insurance here, you can get away with
skipping it as long as you don\'t have an accident. If you *do* have an
accident and you\'ve skipped insurance, you could easily lose the ship!

This may be valid Traveller maths, but it\'s crap real world economics

For instance, I currently earn over 60K a year, but my assets are nowhere

Decmpression is standard practice in Air Force bombers
even in an atmosphere. However, again, it might to much of
an inconvenience on any large ship, especialy for medical teams

Anything up to destroyer, I\'d expect to decompress, or at least lower
pressure a great deal,

Screens up may be considered a sign of aggressive intent,
and would likely badly interfere with your detection capabilities

As long as you can get the screens up faster than a missile can travel
a couple of thousand klicks, I\'d expect them to be left off
until combat was certain. 

(General quarters does not neccessarily imply combat)

Other than the fact that they\'ll likely be using the grav gear to
compensate for accelerations,  I agree. People should be strapped in
anyway, unless their job specifically requires them to be mobile
during combat

Saves power too.

Hell, why don\'t we all make our own ?

Take a few good photos, or stills from movie magazines,
like, say the cast of Aliens and Predator, shrink them to appropriate
size, put them in a preapred table, and print them.

For that matter, I\'ve probably still got a couple of full sheets
of Cardboard Heroes somewhere, (I know I still have the vehicles
sheet from JG\'s Tancred), I could scan and print them as well,
that way preserving the originals.

BTW, I\'ve just scanned and formatted as an MS Word document
the first half of "Ciitizens", and am starting on "Trader\'s & Gunboats".
so if the guy that wanted to do an e-version of CT needs a hand
he should give me a yell.

Next step is to convert to HTML and throw in few hyperlinks,
then the little black books can go into careful storage
and not get anymore worn,

These new HP scanners that scan straight to Word are great !

We\'ve already reproduced the reference cards from games such as
Necromundia in full colour, they came out well.

The next thing on the agenda is to do a full colour version of the
deck plans from the Naval Architect\'s Manual, and get them on
cardboard, ( and at the same time use them to assemble complete
blueprints of ships, using a drawing program. )

The alternative is to produce rooms and corridors that can be printed
stuck to cardboard, and arranged for whatever deckplan you\'re
recreating. I\'m currently doing this with the Naval Architect\'s manual,
combined with some cut-up copies of old FASA deck plans, and the
"Legions of Steel", "Necromundia", and "Space Hulk",  deck pieces

BTW, Necromundia and other WH40K figures when carefully selected
and equiped, can look reasonable as Traveler figures

And the dreadnaughts and assasin droids from Space Hulk are
great for representing Virus ground troops

Pronouncing it sew-low-mahn-ee, as you suggest above, does
not appropriately emphasize the "Sol" part of the word
which really should have the accent being the root of the word.

Personally, I don\'t think it\'s going to come anywhere near
Earth. This is just a clever PR job to drum up more budget support for
NASAs space capability, which has lacked public interest for some time.

Not that that\'s a bad thing.

One thing to not get caught out on is so called "15mm" scale deck
plans use a square grid that looks like 15mm by 15mm squares  ...
but they are not.  They are half inch by half inch  squares.  And
so called "25mm" scale uses 1 inch by 1 inch  squares.  In  CT/MT
each square was "15mm" scale and represented 1.5m by 1.5m ...  in
TNE each square was  "25mm"  scale  and  represented  2m  by  2m.
Striker II says its for use with 25mm minatures but uses a  scale
of 1:1000 ... and says that 1 inch equals 25m.

Er ... now I\'m confused!

When I was first introduced to traveller the referee pronounced words
incorrectly. Unfortunately I am stuck with these mispronouncing.

I like the above pronouncement: Soll + oh + m-ah-n\' + ee
I\'ve tried to pronounce "Solomon" in reference to King Solomon and then
adding the "ee"  (pronounced Sahl + oh + m-ah-n + ee)
In my old Traveller universe Solomani was pronounced S-uh + l-ah-m + n-eye.
I argued this pronunciation but I still find my self saying it like this.

Oh well...

Given the fractured nature of the modern (1100s) Solomani Confederation, I
think it\'s perfectly reasonable that Earth might have had a slight
technological edge.  I picture Earth as becoming *very* isolationist after
the fall of the RoM, suffering greatly in the death spasms.  This
isolationism lasts the entire Long Night, and as the Imperium gets started,
various Solomani pocket empires also begin expanding.

The small states would covet Earth, and spend many resources trying to
bring the Motherworld into their fold to gain legitimacy as *the* human
empire.

Hmmm... Interesting setting I\'ve just described.. where\'s my copy of Pocket
Empires...

Politics is a dirty business and I suspect that we should avoid this at all
costs. I do however wish to observe that we (ie the west) are quite happy
to threaten Iraq (which militarily is something we can do quite effectively
following Desert Storm) as it is something we can do with standoff weapons
and without launching a ground offensive. I\'d also observe that for the
fortnight before the current Serbian actions in Kosovo we saw the warning
signs of more ethnic cleansing on the way, yet weren\'t willing to do
anything.

Why? IMO because it involves committing ground forces and the whole area is
a potential powder keg. And maybe there is no oil around there. Principles
and politics? I don\'t think so. Seen much happening about the genocide in
Bosnia apart from one case? Iraq is a nice clean \'goodies and baddies\'
fight, and easy to put a spin on politically. The Balkans are messy and
peacekeeping/intervention is hard to justify to a public back home when
people die.

ObTrav: I suspect that the Imperium will only become involved in a \'local
dispute\' when it threatens trade or the military integrity of the Imperium
or politics is involved. Does the local subsector Duke order in forces to
raise his political standing?

Paul, I\'m not sure where you are in the world and what law governs that
place, but this law you\'re talking about is probably waivable, i.e., if you
understand that you are pre-ordering, then it is not illegal.  Also,
there\'s a significant question of what law is applicable, the law of the
place where you are or the law of the place where the seller is.  Since you
make the call or use the net to access the seller, the contract will
generally be governed by the law of the place where the seller is.

  Cut to the chase and call the FBI.  Postmaster General is for Mail Fraud, but
FBI has jurisdiction over both.  Assuming, of course, that it is indeed an illegal

He was a weak king who was easily controled by his barons and vassals and
manipulated by his enemies (chiefly Phillip of France).

Ob trav...  Have any the of the Emperors of the 3I been pawns of their
vassals.  I can see powerful Archdukes but from canon, i kind of doubt it.
Course this could play in w/ the Solomani domination versus teh Vilani one and
Emperor Zhakirov. Probably lots of intrigue going on...

	Then general opinion is probably misinformed. Not that the truth is
any more palatable. Useable quantities of chem/bio materials can be
hidden in apartments, houses, and just about everywhere else.
Inspecting the palaces probably won\'t find anything unless Hussein is
an idiot. At most, you might locate records, or possibly *delivery*
systems (i.e. missile technology, etc.). 


ObTrav: Here\'s a frightening plot. Joe Martyr infects himself (or is
infected by his Beloved Leader) with a highly contagious, highly
fatal disease with a fairly long incubation period. Then he goes and
wanders around a major Class A starport, maybe gets on a large
passenger liner and goes to another major world. Everybody who comes
in close proximity with him takes the disease with them, to other
worlds and starports where they spread it as well, to other people
... The players are employed by an intelligence organization that has
gotten some inkling of this plot and wants to investigate further;
when the players discover the true nature, what do they do?

Why frightening? Substitute "Class A" starport with Heathrow, JFK, or
Charles de Gaulle. How many people does the average traveller come
into contact with, and how many places are those people going? I
vaguely recall hearing of a government experiment many years ago,
where people getting on the subway in NY at one station were secretly
dusted with a fluorescent powder. The idea was to see how quickly and
how far a biological agent could be spread from a single point by
terrorists. Answer: frighteningly fast to everywhere in NY.

Nope, if you are earning 60K a year, you do have a single asset worth a lot
more than half a mil - you, or more accuratly the value of your future
earnings stream. If you could capitilise that (which, generally speaking,
you cant, slavery being illegal), then that would be your million-dollar
asset.

Just as an example, see what your insurance company values your
income-earning ability at.

But since Latin vowels (at least in the Continental system) are pronounced
"purely", you should have

	reh + gee + nah

All of which is moot, since CT Book 6 claims the world and other bodies in
the system are named after a St. Regina (of whom I\'ve never heard -- and
the other names seem to imply a made-up literary reference from the future
history).  Anyone know the true story?

No prob making your own foldy-fellows, but please don\'t use copyrighted
artwork. Use something that\'s public domain, dress your friends and roommates
in costumes and take photos of them, draw your own, etc. Remember, these
things are going to end up an inch high -- the art doesn\'t have to be _great_
to make a good looking figure. 

Scan in some clip art (which is by definition public domain) and draw in some
guns, sonic screwdrivers, or whatever. I did it years ago, when the
soft/hardware was much more primitive, and got OK results (never used
them...I\'m a lead pusher at heart, and it seems less trouble to me to make my
own out of Sculpy(tm)).

Don\'t be. Figure scale and ground scale do not always match in games. Don\'t
get the TML started on figure scale again -- the subject is confusing enough
for those of us in the trade.

I thought it was Plantaganet?  (Could be an \'e\' after the g though).

You\'re probably correct here.  "ViewAskew" productions (Kevin Smith\'s
(Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Good Will Hunting) is a major outfit and
they have "pre-orders" of a fashion.  Many products are available signed by
Kevin Smith himself, but, at the moment he is hard at work on the set of
his newest film.  People who order stuff signed by him are "backordered"
until he gets done working on it.  Now, "ViewAskew" is, as I said, a major
outfit and is legally on the level as far as I can tell.  It seems as if
this may be a situation where the credit card purchase can be waived.  I
mean, what happens in the case of backorders and such?  At the jewelry
company where I used to work, it was routine for a credit card order to be
shipped with some of the items, with other items backordered until the full
order can be filled.  And it is typical for bookstores, video-game stores,
and record stores (both mail-order and walk-in) to allow pre-purchases on
items that are expected to become hot.

Snootches, bootches!

I\'m not sure they\'d consider themselves "major" but they do good work.  I was
impressed that they got Troops Part 5 so early.

Ob traveller:  Download Troops: the COPS paradoy of Star Wars - its a day in
the life of an Agent / Soldier of the Empire.
(If you haven\'t seen COPS, its a show that follows Policemen around as they do
they work. blurring the faces to protect the \'innocent\' - it usually involves
domestic squabbles at trailer parks with subliterate folks.  TROOPS is similar
in the Star Wars Universe.  Jawas get rousted, Luke\'s aunt and uncle cause a
scene, etc.  The downloads are large though - 5 parts in 9,4,18,27, and 20 MB
respectively.)

Let\'s see...  Mallrats\' massive budget (Smith\'s _pay_ alone was 6.5 mil),
two critical successes that Smith wrote and directed (Clerks and Chasing
Amy), and both a critical and commercial success that ViewAskew produced
(Good Will Hunting)!!!

Plus a series of commercials (plus a special) on MTV, (possible) writer\'s
credit on the upcoming Tim Burton Superman movie...  and a possible Clerks
animated series.  Sounds pretty major to me  when all is said and done!!!

Oh, and that\'s not to mention the upcoming "Dogma" with Alan Rickman, Chris
Rock, Linda Fiorintino and several other big pay actor types...

I\'d like to see a headcount of people who would be interested, either in

One color screening on a high quality all-cotton Tee with front and (and on
some) back designs.  The basic ideas I have are: Imperial Starburst (yellow
on black shirt), Imperial Starburst (dark grey on black shirt, much more
subtle), and IISS "Poni Express" Logo (black, beige, or light grey on green
or brown).

I need some serious soul-searching here.  The shirts would be under 20
bucks, basically enough for me to cover the licensing, royalties,
equipment, and a small profit for the labor.  If you\'d be seriously willing
to buy a shirt _please_ respond!  Don\'t just let everyone else respond for
you.  And only respond if you\'re serious (or at least tell me that you\'re
half serious).  If I get enough people who\'d like to buy them, I\'ll run off
a few and put them on my (upcoming webpage) for review.

Please consider carefully!!!

So, at last the plot is laid bare.  Cleon is building his path to the
stars on the backs of underpaid garment workers.  For shame!

Alderson, actually.  Alderman drives work by interacting with the
fundmental forces of local government. :)  Alderson\'s a real guy; besides
providing SF tech to N&P, he was responsible for planning the Voyager
grand-tour grav assists.  I once spent three mind-bogglingly wonderful
hours talking to him.  Toward the end we were handwaving a galactic-scale
diskworld, with stars on hundred-million-mile lampposts, or arcing up and
down through holes in the surface...

Just map it as a network, nodes and lines between them, no attempt to
mirror physical location.  As I recall, most stars have 1-3 Alderson
transfer points to other nearby stars, so the net should be sparse enough
to draw legibly.

The main problem is, of course, that it\'s hard to glance at such a map and
tell what is near to what; the lines can be of any length to join nodes,
yet the line length is physically meaningless.  Perhaps a JimV-style 3d
viewer with tramlines superimposed is as good as you can do, even though
it ties viewing to the computer.  Or you can show only relevant parts of
the network, thus minimizing distortions.

To the tune of Randy Newman\'s "I Love LA"...

  Hate nickel-iron, it\'s dense and it\'s hard
  It seems the air just won\'t deflect it;
  Let\'s leave the Basin for the weekend --
  Impacts are rough, and we expect it...

Rolling down Imperial Highway
5 trillion tons of rock coming down
Blast waves blowing in from above
Think we\'ll toast, or drown?

Crank up the windows, and start to scream
That was the river; now it\'s live steam
We\'re gonna die and it ain\'t San Andreas fault...

  From the South Bay, to the Valley
  From the Westside, to the Eastside,
  Everybody\'s very panicked
  Cause big one\'s on the way...
  Looks like our final perfect day
  I love LA!

There go the mountains, here comes the sea,
Great big tsunami gonna wash over me;
Look at that crater, ain\'t nothin\' like it nowhere...

  Victory Boulevard?  It\'s rubble!
  Century Boulevard?  It\'s rubble!
  Santa Monica Boulevard?  It\'s rubble!
  Sixth Street?  It\'s rubble!  It\'s rubble!  aaaaaAAAAAH!

I love LA!

I know, I know.  I\'m a big fan and a View-Askew lurker/occasional poster.  I\'m
just saying that I don\'t think they\'d call themselves \'major\' especially with
respect to the Hollywood establishment.  Which is all the more to their credit.

I don\'t know about the Pony Express, but a black T-shirt having across the top
the thin red line and "Traveller" across it in italics, just like the LBB.  Now
that would be very, very cool!  Put the Free Trade Beowulf Dialogue on the
back.  I\'ll take 2.I\'m getting goose pimples thinking about it.  If you walked
around GenCon with one of these on, you\'d get a lot of attention, and
hopefully, a lot of sales.

In modern French, the spelling is "Richard Coeur de Lion", but I\'m not
fluent in 12th century French, so I can\'t quote the exact spelling at
that time.

Actually it was a military coup.  His massive incompetence in the Third

of course, they found him cowering in his bathroom.

Gee.. woukd I like yet another Traveller t-shirt?  Of course!

A suggestion.. make use of the Bilandin font in some way.. nothing attracts
attention like an unusual script.  (Perhaps put the Mayday call in that font.)

I tried this last year. Here\'s the results I got then:

Most people would be amenable to deck plans, with the list evenly split
between 25mm and 15mm scales. (25mm has more miniatures, 15mm fits tables
better). No one was willing to pay what good colour plans would cost for a
small run ($2 per large sheet), and a large print run (with smaller unit
costs) would have required a substantial investment. At either scale, most
Traveller ships would require several sheets.

Seeker did starship blueprints, which has furnishings but no colour. They
didn\'t sell very well at most games shops (much lower turnover than
books).

I\'m not sure that the 3I won, however. If the Solomani \'crust\' defence
strategy was flawed the way the Imperial histories read the 3I shuld have
beaten them more easily. IMO the 3I couldn\'t have pushed on much further
without paying far too high a price. The way the history reads to me is
that the 3I didn\'t stop with Terra because that was \'good enough\' but
because they\'d become just as exhausted as the (much smaller) Solomanis and
didn\'t want to risk a major stuff-up that would\'ve let the Solomani push
back the other way.

Client state, previously armed (in a series of cycles) by the Imperium,

 The political situation among the client mixed states is complex and 
the Iranian Pocket Empire, so long a supporter of the Imperium, has 
switched to religious fundamentalism and treatened the stability of the 
region.  The Imperium "advisors" in the area saw the Iraq pocket Empire 
as the ideal tool with which to contain the Iraninas, but eneded up 
creating a monster.

Meanwhile, ArchDuke Norris is concerned that Santanocheev and his 
allies have found out (or are asking embarassing questions) about the 
use of Imperial Stationery to promote himself.  To deflect attention 
away from this, the growing skirmish in the client states seems the 
only useful option.  Norris\' advisors have been scanning the reports 
and believe that a claim that the Iraq Empire has bio-weapons (against 
the Imperial Rules of War) could be used as justification for sending a 
large task force (including Santanocheev\'s allies) away for several 
years until the Emperor\'s proclamation arrives to confirm Norris\' 
elevation.

Norris never expected that the force would initiate combat, so when 
reports of combat started to flood in, he needed to re-think his 
strategies ....

Dave,

You haven\'t by chance been reading \'Executive Order\' by Tom Clancy, have
you.  It deals, very realistically
with just this sort of thing.  I won\'t give the book away, but be very
leary of people carrying cans of shaving

True. Saskatchewan also has a city called Saskatoon (where I grew up),

Guess what design _I_ proposed?

Oh, god yes!  I saw that with an LA audience, and everybody was cheering

device has a penetration rating of 33 (and it could be worse if it had been
made at a higher tech level per FFS),   The round generates enough energy to
blast through that much armour ( the side of an APC, but does sod all-damage
to the occupant of someone in a combat environment suit, (which at higher
ctech levels is probably proof againts burst damage).  Interestingly, if the
round did penetrate a thinly armoured vehicle, it vwould probably cause a
major damage, and seriously injure two crew.  Certainly current 40mm HE
rounds that I have used are about as dangerous as rocks, but if you actually
get it into conbtact?  I think that the problem lies in the calculation of
the concussion damage in FF&S for small calibre HE/HEAP rounds.  By the way
I have always taken it that personal armour provides protection sometimes
against fragments, but not concussion, is this correct.  What do you think?

Back to my previous post that LS cost is mostly medical/accident insurance
required for Imperial starships. IMTU all ships MUST file flightplans one
jump at a time and these are forwarded through x-boats and couriers to
subsector capitals. Failure to file flightplans forfeits your insurance
collection ability as well as any rescue attempts. All ports have
transponders just as ships (even E-ports) so you have to be sneaky to get
around.

As flightplans are secret and should be so for business competitional
reasons a major part of adventuring IMTU is bribing/stealing/deducting
flightplans and avoiding/falsifying/tampering the same.

Sorry about my choice of words. All sensors BUT mass det get a huge
reduction of sensitivity when staring at the sun. You might be right about
mass detectors being inverse cube based which is nice; they could be really
sensitive up close (to the point of mapping out the interiors of ships at
close range) and drop off somewhat faster than passives but much slower
than actives. Hmm need to think about what that\'ll do to my canon.

I knew it.  I think a companion set of both would be ideal.  One simply has the
CT Traveller logo and red line with the Free Trader Beowulf dialogue (from the
Beowulf\'s point of view).  The other has Gurps:Traveller logo on the front, and
the companion dialogue broadcast to the Beowulf.  T-Shirt Bookends.

You\'ll let me know if y\'all could use this Yankee-educated Texan and beta

Absolutely nothing, except that such expenses depend very much on local
conditions and should be explicit so that the Referee can take them into
account if (no, make that \'when\') the players try to get around them. 
Also, it is not unimportant just what version of the handwave you chose
(for instance, if it is a government tax, then it is a criminal act to
avoid it, but OTOH it does not necessarily apply everywhere; if it is
insurance then it might merely be a stupid act to avoid it; if it is
accidence insurance, then it might vary with the age of the ship; etc.)

If you can find people who will risk a 3% chance of death in order to
save Cr7,000, then I rather think you could find people willing to ride
without insurance to save Cr1000...

>What if a large number of the Jump-1 ships have been completely paid off?

Then either operating expenses and the risks of breakdowns for a 40 year old
ship are no greater than those for a brand new ship, in which case the
company who paid off the mortgage would be crazy to sell them, or operating
expenses and risks of breakdowns are big enough to make it a better deal to
sell it and buy a new ship, in which case it is _more_ expensive to run the
old ship.

(What happens is, IMO, that an old ship is cheaper to operate as long as no
major breakdowns occur, thus allowing freetraders to survive on marginal
routes until the day when the major breakdown does happen. Then they
usually go bankrupt and have to sell the ship to some other optimist. In
effect, the owner of an old ship is betting that he can save up enough
money to pay the inevitable repairs before they become necessary. Those
who win that gamble may grow rich; the rest goes bankrupt.)

No one has claimed that there will not be any use for jump-1 ships, merely
that they won\'t be used on long hauls. For a 1 parsec route a jump-1 ship
beats a higher-jump ship any day.

But equally old jump-3 ships will be still cheaper.

Since even an old jump-1 ship can be worth 10-15 megacredits, I\'d say the
answer is yes (assuming for purposes of arguments that there is a pirate
in the first place). Of course, a jump-3 ship will be more valuable, so it
would be more attractive. But not to the point where the pirate couldn\'t
be bothered to capture the jump-1 ship.

OK. Point taken.

I could give you an argument about that (in fact, I\'m going to; see below),
but that\'s exactly one of the reasons I find the rule very implausible: the
life support cost is exactly the same for crewmembers, Middle, and High
passengers. Now, does that really make sense to you?

>You\'ll be serving them fresh food. Which you can\'t count on
>being able to use next trip.

That very much depends on your choice of food. Even TL 8 food preservation
techniques allow you to store some food for a long time with no appreciable
loss of quality. You may not get away with it for real fanatic epicures, but
otherwise you could. At higher TLs food preservation techniques can only get
better. And besides:
 
>This isn\'t an airliner. It\'s an ocean liner.

It appears to be everything from the QE2 to a brokendown Panamanian tramp
freighter. So how realistic is a uniform life support figure that covers
the food served on ships of so widely varying quality?

>And that means things like fresh food for the "first class" passengers.

_And_ the second class _and_ the crew...

The other day, I was watching a local sports show which was previewing the
season for our two local Major League teams (The San Francisco Giants and
the Oakland A\'s.)  The commentator, who is new to the area, made the remark
that a World Series meeting between the two teams wasn\'t impossible, and
that such a meeting would "rock the bay."  Embarrassed silence from
everybody else on the set.

The last time the Giants and the A\'s face each other in the Series, we had
a 7.1 earthquake just before game 3.

The Travellers\' Digest, issue 9, page 20.  In the article on the Imperial
Guard it says:

"The Guard remained free of politics until 989 when senior Guard commanders
under General Nicolai Dienne forced the abdication of Emperor Styryx in
favor of Emperor Gavin, his eldest son.  This palace coup was supported by
the Imperial General Staff and by most of the Imperial Armed Forces because
of Styryx\'s bungling in the conduct and settlement of the Third Frontier
War.  The coup was not bloodless.  Styryx\'s IISS bodyguard remained loyal
to him and were killed during a brief firefight with the Aslan Guard.
Styryx was found cowering in his personal fresher and was forced to sign
his abdication at the point of General Dienne\'s gauss pistol."

I imagine the first thing Dienne did after Gavin\'s coronation was submit
his resigination.  Even if his acts were the right thing to do, he did
violate his oath to the emperor.

Heh.  When I was 14, I had a Traveller T-shirt made at a local custom shirt
shop.  I wore it so much, and tread Traveller constantly, that a guy at
school stopped trying to remember my name and just called me "Traveller."

The next year, I had a Tavrchedle shirt done.  The clerk asked me if it was
obscene, saying he couldn\'t do obscene messages.  The shirt he had just

Those TMLers fortunate enough to visit Roskilde festival may have noticed
our 1m x 2m Imperial starburst flag. It\'s black with a red starburst single
sheet double sided ie a real flag.

People asking us which bands logo we carry are replied "This is the banner
for the third Imperium and if you do not know what that means we wont tell
you".

Can we get this jerk* removed from the mailing list *please*?

Thank you

*I wouldn\'t call him a jerk; he\'s obviously been signed up for the list 
by someone else. But his damn auto-reply is spamming the list, and *that*

 It seems to me I\'ve seen his name around the TML before.  He may have just
started a filter and doesn\'t realize what has happened.  I\'ve forwarded a
message to the postmaster at Netcom with a request to notify him of the problem.

1.  Based on the information in the T4 main rulebook, what year should

2.  Is there some reason why there are worlds only two parsecs away from 
the Imperium that have not been contacted in hundreds of years, as 
indicated in the back of the main rulebook?  Why?

3.  Does the Imperium encompass more worlds than are indicated in the 
back of the rulebook (ie. in the subsectors above Core and to the left)?

If someone would answer these questions for me, or point me in the 
direction to find my own answers, I would greatly appreciate it.

In MTU, we (the PC\'s) are not involved in world politics perse. That is
not to say that we cannot or will not become involved, but whatever
involvement we do have is on a much smaller scale (espionage activities,
snatch and grab, extraction, investigate and report, I think you get the
idea). This is easier for me to control and allows me to keep the party
small(er). My (our) ship carries variously from 55 to 65 multi-talented
characters and aliens. We have 3 main PC\'s and variably 3 to 9 NPC\'s
who, because of circumstance change from episode to episode. Some of the
NPC\'s are added as a result of episodes we have, and any NPC can become
a PC if the game needs the talents of that particular NPC. This gives my
players a chance to role-play many or various alien type\'s. The minimum
required to operate the ship (last resort) would be possibly 26-30 so as
crews are lost for whatever reason, we are forced to locate
replacements, which means visiting and interacting with whatever is
dirtside. The band as a whole are a roving bunch of you name it,
galivanting around in space, getting into and out all sorts of mischief,
and generally having a blast.
 
I like the 3D idea. I like the traveller game in all its forms, good or
bad, and I will try to adapt my game to fit (in my way or what I
consider someone else\'s better way), if that\'s what the players ask for.

It might not be appropriate to suggest this (since you\'re asking about
TNE), but Striker 1 had a personnel damage system that was scaled entirely
by weapon penetration (damage dice were not used).  Let me know if you
want more info; it\'s a very simple system (2 TNE penetration pts = 1 cm of
hard steel, used in Striker 1 for armor and pen ratings).  Striker 2 (the
TNE version) handles personnel damage in an aggregate fashion, so not much
help there.

I don\'t know how to fix the TNE system, sorry.

    There is no US national interest in that, no. It\'s enlightened self-
interest at best and that\'s the way it should be when considering the lives of
our personnel.  Especially when it would start the biggest mother of a war
that\'s possible right now.   If you\'re itching to fight China... go right

ob Trav...  Is there any instance of Precollapse societies ever committing

The TW:2000 fix was to apply either the penetration or double the
concussion in dice to the target. TNE seems to sort of do this by adding
the \'contact\' concussion rule, which didn\'t exist in TW:2000, but as has
been mentioned that isn\'t very much in the case of little rounds.

Welcome.  Make sure you read the FAQ for this newsgroup.  I\'m not ashamed to
admit that I don\'t know what is being discussed here half the time as I only
have access to T4 materials (woe is me).

Get the Milieu 0: Campaign Hardcover.  Start your campaign somewhere between
Year -5 or so and Year 200.  I\'ve started mine at Year 0.  New Emperor, New
Imperium, all kinds of new problems.  Although the T4 book should be good
for any era.  BTW, make sure to get the T4 errata book.

I would ignore that.  Its not accurate with regard to anything else that I
am aware of.  Unless of course you want to start your own universe.

Same as above.  And yes.  More than a few.  If you get the Milieu 0:
Campaign, there\'s a set of charts that documents expansion of the Imperium
in terms of percentages of a sector\'s systems integrated, independent,
contacted and not-contacted.

 There is a lot of debate over the vitality of IG...

M:0 is the current release - that consists of the period immediately after the
founding of the Imperium.

Hmmm, Well Colin, in my own game I would say that if one were directly hit
by a 40mm RAM HEAP grenade outside of Battle Dress your friends would be
picking up little pieces of you from the floor and ceiling, walls, etc.
Inside Battle Dress the mess would be reduced, but the results (on a
penetrating hit that is) would be the same.

But you seem to favor a more \'gamey\' solution, ok.

I see a couple of options.  The damage for that grenade was intended to be
applied to folk in the blast radius which, being a directed blast, can be
considered pretty minimal.  HEAP grenades are generally fired at something
other than a person (except, possibly, when in Battle Dress or equiv.).  So
I think the damage applied was for the person standing next to the actual
target but within the blast radius.  Fair enough.

If a person were within the penetrating cone of superheated plasma that is
generated by a HEAP warhead (40mm or not), that energy would go into their
body directly, and likely out the other side, leaving a hole which may be
inconvenient to continued internal organ operation.  Apply damage as though
the target were hit by a laser rifle at close range.

If the individual were wearing armor the effects are probably even worse.
A HEAP grenade is specifically designed to cause \'spalling\' or flying
fragments on the inside of the vehicle being hit.  Applying this principle
to, say, battle dress, on a penetrating hit I would say that there were a
number of small fragments of armor bouncing around within the armored torso
of the target, causing considerable discomfort.  I guess the equivalent of
a shotgun blast in damage to the target (as though unarmored) at close
range would approximate the result.

In either case, and even if the shot does not penetrate, there should be a
considerable amount of kinetic energy involved, blowing the target in the
direction of travel of the grenade several meters (like, 2-4 and into any
intervening obstacles).  That character, if alive, should then be stunned
for at least a round, and be suffering from bruises and possible broken
ribs etc.

Now, one thing to remember is that launched grenades tend to have an arming
mechanism that depends on rotation.  The fuse arms after taking a certain
number of rotations after leaving the barrel.  This means you need a few
meters (anyone know how many? I would guess at least 5 meters) before the
grenade is armed.  I suppose someone with the appropriate skill could
modify them to allow quicker arming, but then again a person with that
skill may be too smart to do so.  In any case the upshot is that a RAM HEAP
grenade is *not* a good close in weapon.  Once you\'re no longer \'close in\'
hitting a man-sized fast-moving object with a rocket propelled grenade
directly should be significantly harder to do (barring suprise, of course).

I had a character (Gregory MacGregor - and roll those R\'s) who spent whole
adventures carring nothing but a magazine fed 40mm grenade launcher (an M79
with a clip, basically).  Other characters reacted very quickly when he
said "duck".

Current United States protocol is to address superior officers according to
gender.  "Sir" for a male senior officer or "Ma\'am" for a female.  As a
rule (in the Army at least) calling a senior by their rank is something of
an insult in casual conversation.

On the other hand, the Star Trek series seems to have occassions where
female officers were addressed as "Sir."  Of course, it took Star Trek
twenty years to even show us enlisted personal, so I can\'t really truet
them.

 Well, since the message has changed, obviously he has been notified by the

All the woman ever did was carry Kirk\'s clipboard!  That and get mauled by
him on occasion.  (Hmmm.. I see Ken Starr\'s descendents won\'t want for work
in the Federation...)

My biggest problem with this came in ST:6.  The enterprise has crew of
several hundred people.  And the two most qualified to make modifications
to a photon torpedo in the middle of a desperate battle are..  The Science
Officer, and the Ship\'s DOCTOR!?!   Who were on the bridge?!  There wasn\'t
a single Torpedo Tech/3 standing around who could swap homing packages?

Sorry for the rant, but ST ticks me off.. Thank Ghu it\'s almost time for B5.

Implemented in the data are:

Sylean Federation Worlds hilighted, data from CT used
Santry and Cordova placed useing Jo Grant\'s TML suggeestions.
Barren Worlds hilighted in grey, and are not included in any polity
Barren worlds which had a Scout base upgraded to D clss starport, given
1d3 population and 1d6 pop multi. Scout bases are only present on world
with type \'D\' or better starports according to the rules.

The worlds selected for the CK and IC are based on worlds mentioned by
Volker, which in turn were refrenced from Traveller Digests, and by the
M:0 information.  The Ck had up to 25 worlds, the IC 32.  Most worlds
follow a main.  Barren worlds were not included.

In all a rather decent sector.  And its a compatible Gal2.3 directory.

Go to my new FTP site.  http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx/ftp  the file is
year0.zip.  Download and unzip it. place the year0 directory in your
Gal2.3 directory.  You will have to edit the gal.lst file to include the
year0 directory.  Once thats done, you have the whole of core sector
ready for play.

Enjoy! :)

We can hope that Rob does so soon.

I am planning on giving Netcom a call, and trying to hit the asshole with
the wrath of God.  If that fails, well, I will just have to remember the
son of a bitch.  Keep his name in a VERY special place reserved for the
owners of Cyberpromo.

In New Zealand all female officers in any service are addressed as \'Ma\'am\'
or by rank (if your rank is only a little lower or is higher, or the
situation is relatively informal).

I don\'t know how accurate the movies are, but we always used to laugh at US
privates having to call their NCOs \'Sir\'. If we did that the laest you\'d
get was "Don\'t insult me like that again - I work for my pay. Give me 30!
(press-ups)".

I don\'t disagree with you.  If you are not an officer in TOS, you are something

is EXACTLY what your fate would be.  Poor red shirts....

Welcome!

Milieu 0 runs from 0 to 200. IIRC T4.1\'s base date is 98 Imperial (eg
Missions of State adventures). Somewhere around 98 would be best for future
material compatibility. If you want a more mature Imperium have a look at
the News articles at http://www.stl-online.net/vanya/default.html which
cover 1105 to 1120-something, a more mature Imperium ranging to TL15
(covered in MegaTraveller and Classic Traveller). Milieu 0 is a damn good
supplement (asides from the Core map).

>2.  Is there some reason why there are worlds only two parsecs away from

>indicated in the back of the main rulebook?  Why?

The map in the main rulebook is wrong - it is superceded by the material in
M0 (Campaign and in M0/First Survey). Unfortunately, M0/FS and M0
Campaign\'s data is flawed (although the hardback does give a solution to
the problem of Law Levels = Govt Levels) and some worlds have too high a
population. M0 is very useful all the same.

Why? A lack of proof reading and understanding of Traveller\'s background.
M0 was wriiten with one set of sector data and the First Survey data was
substituted without the authors seeing it. First Survey is available
electronically at http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/ but it is only
the text file, not the maps themselves.

>3.  Does the Imperium encompass more worlds than are indicated in the
>back of the rulebook (ie. in the subsectors above Core and to the left)?

Yes. By 100 the Imperium covers several sectors. There are crude maps
covering the expansion at http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/ as
well. The map data probably is more the kind of data available commercially
, maybe from -30ish. IMO of course.

Above and to the left of Sylea (in the M0/FS Map) was the Interstellar
Confederacy (a major rival to Spinward of the Imperium defeated around 0
Imperial). Below (Rimward) of the Imperium was the Chanestin Kingdom,
defeated soon after the IC. Santry and Cordova are misplaced on the map too.

I have episodes running in mine at year 0, year 15, and year 19.

>2.  Is there some reason why there are worlds only two parsecs away from 
>the Imperium that have not been contacted in hundreds of years, as 
>indicated in the back of the main rulebook?  Why?

Yes - someone was a dingleberry when they proofed and continuity checked
this section of the rulebook and M0.  The M0 authors were told they could
alter the sector somewhat for good sense, and then it was changed back at
the last minute to match the fatally crippled and flawed First Survey data.

Now, the way I am playing it is a tad different.  IMTU, Sylea expanded
roughly equally in all directions, adding worlds as they could, and trying
very hard not to leave any behind.  IMTU, the Y0 Imperium owned the old
Sylean Federation worlds, Vland and a dozen worlds near it by treaty, and
had an extent of three parsecs from Sylea and two from Shudusham.

By Y10, they had filled in the gaps, and started to expand to spinward and
antispinward, such that it did not look like a dumbbell, but the Imperium
was still essentially Sylea with Shudushamese influence.  They also had
recently conquered the Chanestin kingdom, but had not taken it over.

Y20 brought integration of the former Chanestin territory, as well as a mad
push to try expanding towards Lishun and Vland.  Core pacification was
formulated as policy, but not well acted on because of the large number of
recently acquired worlds.

Y50 brought massive internal development, a stall of expansion, and a
dramatic rise in population and technology to the member systems.  During
this time, opponents in Core were clearly identified, isolated, and sweet
talked.  A massive Naval buildup took place, putting serious firepower
right near anyone in Core and near environs who might say "boo!"

Y70 was an expansionary time.  Core was completely pacified in a series of
lightning moves, which then opportunistically expanded the young Imperium
into Massilia, Lishun, Dagadushag, and Vland.

Note - this is very different from classical canon on the rate of
expansion, but I do not see the young Imperium being able to expand its
border that fast, and I do not see trade taking place more then 3-8 parsecs
from the Imperial border easily.

>3.  Does the Imperium encompass more worlds than are indicated in the 
>back of the rulebook (ie. in the subsectors above Core and to the left)?

Many, many more.  In the early years, that is about the right size, but by
a few hundred, it is sectors and sectors in size.

You too? I thought it was just me. They were mailed straight to me, so I
assumed it was my fault, but then I realised that my messages were getting

	sorry flight plans are not secret ;-( MT Knight Fall :

	worlds law level is 8 or 9, a permit is neede. Application

Depends on the culture.  

IMTU, all Officers are honorary "Sirs", and are addressed as such, as in
"Yes, Sir!  Aye, aye Sir!"

Informally, Junior Officers are refered to as "Mr", as in "Check with Mr
Robinson."

Senior Officers and in formal situations Junior Officers are refered to by
Rank, as in "Ensign Pulver, contact Major Marie and Commander Jones."

Very informally, Officers may be refered to by certain nicknames as long as
respect is clearly being shown, as in "Yes Ma\'am, I\'ve got a message from
the XO, he says the Skipper will be late for her meeting with the Chief."

IYTU, do it however you like. ;->

>The main character is a female captain of a destroyer (equal
>opportunity in the future!).

Sure thing!  In *some* cultures.  ;-> If the culture is truely equal
opportunity, then it might not matter whether Sir or Ma\'am is used.  In a
culture that professes equality, but isn\'t really there, it would probably
matter more.

 True. Saskatchewan also has a city called Saskatoon (where I grew up),
 which is also a planet in the Solomani Rim. I figured it was named by some
 homesick grasshopper during one of the Interstellar Wars.

Somewhere one of the books tells us the names of the gas giant which Regina

Good question. I know that corporately it\'s best to keep the "best face" on
things and not rule out the possibility of a full recovery. However, it is
most definitely my opinion that Imperium Games will not produce any future
Traveller products, and you can quote me on that if you like.

Well, in Twilight: 2000, we ... Ah, Rupert has already answered for me, I see.
I had a game once where a guy was hit by a 122mm tank round, and argued with
me about the damage he took, claiming he was too close for the round to have
armed, and that it therefore did not go off. I ruled that he had a 122mm hole
in his -- (rattle-rattle) -- abdomen. When I told him that was just under five
inches, he gave up and starting rolling his new character

Arming distance for a US 40mm GL is about 30 yards, I think. Been a long time
since I had to know. I would want it designed so that it is just beyond the
burst radius...: )

When in the Army (as a Lance Corporal) I would never have said "come here"
to any officer, because it sounds like an order. "Could you take a look at
this, Sir" or "Over here!" in the field perhaps, though there were some
idiot officers who seemed to think that while snipers would see rank badges
or salutes they would hear or understand "Sir". Of course \'Sir\' is a
wonderfully insulting word when part of a career NSO\'s vocabulary.

IIRC this was the correct form of address for Midshipmen and Warrant

I liked the way it was a sign in Brin\'s _The Uplift War_ that you were out
in the boonies when women were addressed with "Ma\'am" as opposed to the
equal opportunity "Ser".

Now it appears that some one has subbed you without your knowledge. Okay
that\'s not your fault. Neither is it the fault of the several hundred
subscribers of the TML. So please could you simply send the following
email message to:

traveller-request@mgpn.com

and include in the body of the message:

unsubscribe travaller
end

It is the polite thing to do. I hope you act according to common decency.

Thank you.

  Admittedly, it only works with very junior officers, or if you have some power/pull in your unit.  But it is entertaining as hell..

  Just as a side-note on this, USMC does not condone calling Lieutenants "LT".  Apparently that\'s an Army thing only..

That reminds me of the Good Old Days of Aftermath! and TW:2000 which I
haven\'t played since TNE came out, um how many years ago? 5? FIVE! Good lord!

Of course, by the time one achieves a truly egalitarian, "equal

fallen out of use, being the uselessly hierarchical fripperies that they

Regina orbits a gas giant called Assiniboia (pronounced to ryme with "luxury
yacht," another connection with Saskatchewan?), which is the fourth world out
from the star Lusor (_not_ pronounced Loser).

WRT addressing officers:

I have heard tell of a very senior Marine NCO who liked to call newly minted
junior LTs "skippie" and reserved "skipper" for officers he liked, regardless
of rank.


Totally unrelated USMC DI story I tell because I feel like it: 

WWII training camp, DI stands in front of the mob just off the bus and
announces that if any man thinks he can take him, to step forward. The bus, as
it happens, was filled with very large, corn-fed, Minnesota Lutheran farmboys
of Viking descent, all of whom looked at each other, and nodded, and all
stepped forward. Noticing that there were 40 of them and not feeling up to
clobbering more than 20 or so, the DI announced that these were just the raw
material that the Corps was looking for, and he would take great pleasure in
turning them into Marines.

Now here\'s what I\'d like to see:  a battle between the red-shirted lackeys
from ST:TOS and the Stormtroopers from Star Wars.

By law the red shirts must die, but, by law the Stormtroopers can\'t hit the
broadside of a barn...  It would be a long, boring, drawn out battle ending
in a stalemate.

  Typo! The orbit number for Lashir is not properly indented. It is really

I doubt it, or myself and a lot of other people on the list wouldn\'t have
been annoyed by this nonsense.

Personally after looking at the headers and seeing that the messages were
sent using Eudora Pro 3 for Windows, I suspect either the spamming of the
list was on purpose or this idiot has the most ridiculous set of filters in
place ever.

In the modern US Army Warrant Officers are called Mister So-and-so, and are
entitled to salutes.  They confused the hell ot of most of us, so we
avoided them.  Easy to do as a grunt.

Odd, in my time, our Platoon Leader was the LT, every other O-1/O-2 was a
generic Lieutenant.  Even then, the officer had to earn our trust before we
started calling him LT to his face.  Even then, it was mostly a field sort
of thing.

I\'m hoping that this will reach the mailing list administrator by copying
